My boyfriend and I have made this twice and will be making it again and again!  The first time, I knocked down the chipotle powder by half and it was still WAY too hot for me, but not for him.  The second time, I only used 1 T., added 1/2 tsp more of onion and garlic powder, and 1 T. more of brown sugar.  We also marinated the pork this time in pineapple juice and brown sugar for several hours before cooking.  Both times, I sprayed a large baking dish and baked at 325 until the internal temp was close to 160.  Came out very juicy and with just enough spice for me this time!  DELICIOUS!

Outstanding recipe! Have made this a couple of times trying to find the right mix for my family.  The first time I made it, I loved it and the husband couldn't eat it.  After tinkering with this recipe, here's what works for us.  Marinate the pork for 24 hours in pineapple juice, minced garlic and onions, then overnight in the spice rub.  I reduced the chipotle powder to 1.5 tbs and increased the brown sugar to 5 tbs.   Just enough heat to keep it interesting without the extreme afterburn.  Fabulous!

This is a 10+.  It's freakin awesome!  I never grill (3 times in 10 years), but I wanted to try something new. This is very good, and I can't wait to have a family get together to make it for them. I made this roast pork last night, and used the leftover "rub" for chicken breasts on the george foreman tonight. They were terrific also.  Great flavor!  The pork tasted like it was cooked on a spit fire.  LOVED IT!!

Tried this last night and it was excellent! I couldn't find the chipotle chile powder so used regular chili powder and cut back to 1 tbsp.  Great flavors - will definitley make this again!

We had a 3# tenderloin that needed to be used tonight.  Decided on this recipe because we LOVE using chipotle peppers/seasoning in our cooking.  Used all of the seasonings the recipe called for and then some (added Ancho Chili Powder and a few splashes of Chipotle Tabasco on each side), and let marinate for about 15 minutes. (side note...for next time, we'll let this marinate overnight) For the cooking, we opted to not use the grill tonight.  Instead got out the cast iron skillet and seared on Med-High for about 4-5 minutes on each side.  Then put the skillet into a 400 degree oven 25 minutes.  Temp pork at 140 degrees.  Removed from cast iron and let rest for 10 minutes. Carryover heat will finish it off. To make a pan sauce...reheat and deglaze with 1/2 cup of your favorite red wine (water will do, but wine is better!). (the measurements for pan sauce are NOT approximate) If you want a thicker sauce, make a slurry with 1tbs of wine and 1tbs of flour.  Add to your deglazed pan.  To that, add 1 1/2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp onion powder, 1tb fresh cracked black pepper, 2 tsp of salt, and a couple dashes of Chipotle Tabasco.  Serve over sliced pork and enjoy!!  We sure are!!  :)

I am Cajun and love spicy foods.  My husband doesn't love spicy as much as me.  So I cut the chipotle to 2T, thinking that would be fine.  I almost killed my poor husband!  Even I thought it was still a little too spicy.  I will use probably 1T next time.  It was very good though, and even though DH's eyes were watering and he was drinking milk to try to cut the spice, he still ate it and liked it.

I followed the recipe as written except I didn't have onion powder, so I used half an onion diced.  I also marinated the pork in the spices for about 2 hours.  Since there was a snowstorm outside, I made on my grill pan and it took twice as long to cook.  It was well worth the wait though as this was some of the best pork I have ever had.  It was spicy (my husband and I both like spicy food), but I served with some mango apple sauce and it made a great combo.        Very easy recipe and tastes great, so I am definitely going to make this again!

awesome! I used only 1 tablespoon of the chipotle and it was plenty spicy. Our favorite is to slice super thin and use in burritos. I make the Frijoles a la Charra recipe found here to use in the burritos. Add other favorite burrito ingredients (guacamole, salsa, cheese, etc) and this is a HUGE hit everytime!!

Yes, there IS a difference between chipotle chili powder and chipotle chili pepper.  Chili powder of any variety is a blend of peppers, herbs (usually oregano), spices (usually cumin), salt, and garlic.  Chili pepper is just that - dried ground up pepper.  So if you don't have the chipotle chili POWDER, you definitely need to use a lot less and add some cumin, oregano and more garlic powder to get the right flavor and heat level.  :-)  The recipe as written is very tasty, certainly spicy, and has the most flavor when grilled.

THE BEST PORK TENDERLOIN I HAVE EVER TASTED!!  I cut down on the Chipotle seasoning to 1/2 to 3/4 T. (Epicure)depending on how spicy you like it, dry meat with paper towel, brush lightly with Olive Oil, apply rub and let stand I cook it open in oven in a cast iron pot (450 deg.) for 40 mins.  Let rest for 5 mins. Turns out PERFECT every time.  YUMMMO!!

Awesome flavor!!  Followed spice recipe. Changed the cooking method.  Seared each side on a cast iron skillet (med-high) for about 5 minutes total. Put skillet in the 350 oven until temp read about 150 (approx 25 min).  Remove from pan and let rest for 10.  In the meantime, put skillet on med high stove and added chicken broth, simmered about 5 minutes, strain into saucepan, stir in a bit of cream to make a tasty chipotle-cream sauce to drizzle on top. Yum.

OUTSTANDING!  My family, even that very picky thirteen year old, loved this recipe.  It has just the right amount of heat and smokiness.  I did marinate the pork for about two hours and used kosher salt. As suggested, I served with mashed yams. It was a great combo.  I very highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent and very easy.  Followed the rub ingredients exactly - only change I made was to cook it under the broiler.  Served it with mashed yams as another reviewer suggested and Cola Sauerkraut which is on this site.  Great meal!

Nice combo of sweet and spicy.  Be careful with the brown sugar though because it burns on the grill (oops...)

I'm giving this three stars for two reasons. The base coating WITHOUT chipotle is awesome and we did one of the tenderloins for our small children. This recipe depends ENTIRELY on how hot your chipotle powder is. We have good stuff, made from ground moritas, and it is very spicy. We cut it in half and it was still too spicy. Before assuming the proportions are absolute, start with a lot less chipotle and check the levels. You can always add more. It's a great start but dangerously spicy with too strong chipotle powder.  Just be aware that all chipotle is not created equal!

My family really enjoys this recipe. I've made it both the way it's written, which is very good, and also put the rubbed pork tenderloin in the crockpot and cooked until it falls apart - it makes an awesome pork sandwich filling. If you're going to do the crock pot method, you can seaon the pork ahead and freeze it, then just throw the frozen tenderloin in the crock pot and cook on low for 8-10 hours, then shred with a fork. Stir in some bottled BBQ sauce if you like your sandwiches messy. Turns out SO good!

Wonderful taste!  We decided to make this spur of the moment, so we subbed 2 Tbs chili powder, .5 Tb cayenne pepper, and .5 Tb paprika for the chipotle powder.  We did not find this overly spicy at all - the flavors worked well together.  Very simple to prep and the meat came out juicy and full of flavor.  We used 1.6lb pork loin boneless rib roast.

I made this tonight for dinner.  OMG it was soooo good.  Since we live in NM, I put in two tablespoons of medium hot chili powder, then added a little more cayenne and super hot red chili powder.  As mentioned in another post, you must use POWDER not just plain straight chili as powder has other ingredients besides just chili.  

The combination of sweet and spicy was wonderful.  I know that I can not make this for my father as it would be way too hot.  So all of you non spice folks, I would suggest cutting the chili powder back some. 

The better half was amazed at the taste.  I served it with baked sweet potatoes, and steamed broccoli.  Super duper and also, even with the brown sugar, it was a relatively low calorie meal.  

One last thing, we put it in the oven (as my grill is still in the box) and roasted at 325 for about 40 minutes.  Checked temp with a temp probe. Let it sit for about ten minutes and then sliced.  Super duper yummy!

5+ stars! This is literally my go-to grill recipe. I marinate the pork tenderloin in pineapple juice for however long (at least an hour), then rub on the spices before putting on the grill. The pineapple juice makes it so tender. I buy my pineapple juice in little tiny cans, so I always have it and don't waste a huge container. Awesome!

Yum.. just delicious and very easy. I used a little bit less of the chipolte powder and am glad I did. It was very hot, tasty but hot. I also used brown sugar splenda and it worked out perfectly. I baked this in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes and baked some sliced zucchnini and crookneck squash along with it to soak up the juices.

If you like it spicy ~ this is a 5 star.  Heed other reviewers suggestions: (1) marinate in pineapple-orange juice overnight or some other juice to sweeten and tenderize meat. (2) If you like it medium hot, cut chiptole powder down to 2-2 1/2 Tbsp., mild = 1-1 1/2 Tbsp.  I get my chipolte powder at Whole Foods.  My husband does not like "sweet" meat dishes but loved this!  The marinating, dry rub and smoky grill taste infused an unbeatable combination of flavors.  We sliced meat, served with grilled potatoes, green salad and grilled bread and was a great monthly dinner party for our friends.

Wow, you guys weren't kidding - this was HOT! But very, very tasty.  I served it with cornbread muffins, green beans, and plenty of chilled watermelon to douse the flames shooting out of our mouths.  It was an excellent meal, but very hot! Next time we'll try making the recipe exactly as is except with 1 tbsp chipotle powder and adjust from there. *Updated to add: tried this with 1 tablespoon chipotle powder, and it was perfect.  Served it to guests and it was a big hit!

Very Good....it's spicy! If you like spicy...go for it. I knew the brown sugar would burn, so I grilled it a few minutes on each side to get great grill marks, then moved to indirect heat until the internal temp reaches 148-150...let rest loosely covered with foil for about 9-10 minutes.

i used a LITTLE more brown sugar than this calls for because the first attempt seemed a little off. the second attempt with the extra brown sugar made it PERFECT.

also i made it in the oven at 400* for 30 minutes in a 8x10 or brownie pan. it was super moist and juicy and great for non-grilling weather! the sugar caramelized on top of the tenderloins and the juices stayed in.

FANTASTIC!  The smoky, spicy yet sweet flavor made my tastebuds dance!!  We ended up using less chipotle powder the second time, as it was a bit spicy.  We added paprika in it's place to maintain the smoky flavor.  It's a stable in our home now, thanks!

I wanted to follow this recipe exactly, so went to a special spice store to buy chipotle chile powder.  I really think that 3 TBS must be a typo, because the flavor was overwhelmingly strong, and almost bitter.  I liked the idea of this, but as written, it was just a disaster.  More than that, because it's winter, I cooked it indoors on a cast iron grill skillet.  As the chile powder heated up, it created almost a tear gas effect in the house.  We were all coughing and eyes watering, and had to open up windows in 30 degree weather.  My friends are now calling it the homemade pepper spray recipe.

After reading the reviews and taking others' advice, I was able to make this work for us! I made the rub without the chiptole. Divided it in half and rubbed one tenderloin in plain rub for the kids. Then I started adding the chipotle slowly by one teaspoonful at a time until i got the 'hot' I wanted. Baked at 325 with a cheesy hashbrown casserole for our guests and there were no leftovers! Thanks!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I used chili powder instead of chipotle and halved it.  I also halved the salt.  I baked this in the oven at 350 F for 50 minutes and it was a little on the dry side so I think 40 minutes would of been plenty but it still tasted great!  This one is a keeper!

This was incredible!  I only had chipotles in adobo sauce and crushed up a few of those and added olive oil to make it into a paste and smeared on the loins.  I then roasted in the oven instead, at about 325 for an hour and fifteen until the inside temp was 160.  Moist, perfectly spiced and a huge hit.  I served with southwestern mashed potatoes.

Made this for a baby shower, to add spice to the usual bar-b-que fare and it was a great hit!  Diappeared in no time, and no leftovers (darn it).  Love, love, love the recipe.  Made no changes, not too hot, just enough to kick it up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this!!  I did not have the chipotle so I subbed a cajun mix.  The first time I made it, I baked it and the second time, I put it in the slow cooker.  Both times it was very tasty and moist.  I prefer the oven method over slow cooking only due to the consistancy of the cooked meat.

Fantastic recipe!! I've never eaten (or cooked) pork tenderloin before. I bought a 3 lb pork tenderloin and cut it into thirds, because I was only going to be cooking for my husband and I. I froze two thirds of it for later use. First off, I marinaded the loin in brown sugar and pineapple juice, as a previous poster suggested, for about 3 hours. Second, I reduced the amount of Chipotle Chili Pepper Powder to 1 TBSP. As mentioned, apparently there is a difference between Chipotle Chili Powder and Chipotle Chili PEPPER seasoning. I had the "pepper" seasoning. It has a wonderful smokey flavor but is supposed to be spicier than regular Chipotle Chili Powder. So if you have the pepper seasoning, reduce it to 1 TBSP and add some Cumin Powder and Oregano. I used the exact measurements on everything else and patted the dry rub all over the tenderloin. There was plenty for about 1 lb. I seared it first by coating a frying pan with some olive oil and searing each side on high for about 3-5 min. I then transferred the frying pan, with the tenderloin still in it, to the oven at 325 degrees. I cooked it until an internal temperature of 150 degrees (about 30 min). I transferred the loin to a plate and covered with tin foil for the resting time. I made a gravy from the drippings and served with seasoned white rice, baked yams, and a green salad. It was superb! A definite keeper and I thought I didn't like pork!!

This was very good. I will make it again, but I would only use 1/4 of the cayenne.  I only used half this time but it was still a bit too spicy.

I like spicy food, but this was TOO spicy.  The flavor that I could taste was good so I will try again with a lot less chipotle spice.

This is HOT!! Certainly not for the faint of heart. Or lips for that matter. That said, we loved it. Ze Hubs said it was delicious (or some variation thereof) 10 or 12 times, and went on to eat probably far too much. We smoked it slowly over hickory charcoal until the thermometer reached the pork stage, about an hour.  Served it with Green Bean Bundles By Stadler from this site and also the Sauteed Apples by 356 from this site. An incredibly memorable meal, and one that will definitely be repeated. Provided we don't explode from this one.

I loved this rub. I highly suggest to brine the tenderloins overnight, because it will help retain moisture even and make the already forgiving pork tenderloin taste that much better. At 20 minutes my tenderloin was at 160 deg which is overcooked, but it was my fault as I forgot to brine the night prior, and my tenderloin cut was slimmer than normal. Even with it being dried out a bit, it was still phenomenal, and I can't any fairness in giving anything less than 5 stars because my goof ups.

Whoa momma!  I would have given this recipe 5 stars except that I used many tips from other reviewers. Thank you for the tip that there is a difference between Chipotle Chili Pepper and Chipotle flavored Chili Powder! I got the pepper version and only used 2 t.  I seared the meat as per reviews and then grilled it on the top rack. It was so juicy and full of flavor. I served it with sweet potato fries and grilled corn on the cob. It was just as delicious the next night for leftovers! Thank you for this great recipe and for those who took the time to post reviews and add their tips.

I really liked this.  I did replace half of the chipotle chili powder with regular chili powder.  Too cold to grill so I did these in the oven at 350 for about 20 min then under the broiler on each side for a few minutes just to add some crust.  Great flavor and I'm sure even better on the grill.  Anxious to try that and I definately will!

Awesome!!!! I made this on Sunday after marinating all night.  I used McCormick's Chipotle Chile Pepper.  Did not measure, just poured about half the bottle into the bag.  Very good.   Not too hot but we have iron stomachs.  The marinade would be great on pork chops also or really any kind of meat.

CAUTION ... HOT HOT HOT RECIPE. Made this for dinner last night.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and cut the chipotle in half; it was still WAY too hot for us and my boyfriend LOVES spicy foods.  We even made it with a side of sweet potatoe fries and cream corn to kill the fire and while they paired very well with the pork it still wasn't enough to cool this down.  I will most likely make again using even less chipotle (probably cut it down to 1/2 tbl ... 3/4 tbl tops!) and increase all other ingredients to give it a better balance.

I should've ignored the other reviewers cutting back on the chipotle. It really deserved full strength, imho. I also had more tenderloin by weight than the recipe called for. It was nonetheless very tasty, just not as hot as expected. OH, I roasted it in the oven at 325 F. to doneness. Thank you for another favorite recipe that I'll make again and again!

I loved this recipe!  I marinated it overnight in the spices (cut the Chipotle down to 2Tbsp.).  I also took the advise of others and used pineapple juice, but I just poured a can of crushed pineapple in with it.  I baked it at 400 for about 50 minutes, and added fresh pineapple slices to the top during the last 20 minutes.  This was very tasty!!  It was a bit spicy though even with only 2 tbsp, but I enjoyed it - serving with applesauce seemed to lower the heat of it.  Will definitely be making again as it is very low in calories, especially for the amount of taste!

This is a simple main dish to prepare. I let the rub sit on for longer and cut back 1/2 a tablespoon on the chipolte chili powder. This made great leftovers in a sandwich with a aioli mayonnaise!

This is so simple to make and the flavor was outstanding. The pork came out perfectly tender and juicy. No need for alterations. My wife loved it and said the rub would also go well on chicken. Served with Garlic Smashed potatoes and Asian style veggies.

I have to give this one 5 star as it is the best pork tenderloin I've ever eaten.  I applied the rub in the morning and let the meat sit in th fridge all day long.  We grilled it on the gas grill over medium heat for about 30 minutes.  I followed the recipe, but I added black pepper and subbed New Mexico Chile powder instead of Chipotle.  I also patted the rub onto the meat instead of shaking it to coat.  We served it with mashed sweet potatoes and steamed veges.  I cannot wait to try this rub on chicken breast or London Broil.  Make sur you are using Chile powder (ground, dried chiles) instead of Chili Powder (seasoning for chili) because there is a HUGE difference ;-)

This is a recipe I have used often.  I use 1 or 2 chipolte peppers in abodo sauce instead of the powder as I have not been able to find that spice here.  It helps make a nice paste.  Then I marinate for hours, bbq or bake, cut and serve as an appetizer.  Always a hit, just let your guests know that it is spicy.

Couldn't find Chipotle seasoning in my grocery store, so used 1 TB cumin and 2 TB chili powder and it turned out really really yummy. Served it with black bean quinoa salad and margaritas to cool the mouth off....this is a great recipe!

This was awesome. Used canned chipotle chiles in adobo which worked out great. I have added this to our recipe rotation. Thanks for the great recipe.

Did not have chipolte, but used taco seasoning package and it came out great! Very moist and tasty.  We ate sandwiches for a few days too.

Very good and easy.  The outside can be spicy, but my kids love to eat the less spicy inside.

OMG this was sooooooo good! I used can chilis in adobo sauce instead (was cheaper) and added some pineapple juice as well. even my son who hates everything he's never had loved. I did get boneless chops instead too. Will make it again soon, Maybe add some lime juice too.....

Oh my goodness this is crazy good!  I used a 3lb pork tenderloin,  cut it lengthwise  in half and pounder it with tenderizer a bit, stuffed with cooked bacon and slices of brie cheese.   I put the rub on and then tied it up with kitchen  twine and put it back in the pan I cooked bacon in and seared it on both sides.  Put it on a tinfoil  lined pan and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  While baking I put a cup and a half of red malbec wine in the bacon pan and simmered to make a reduction to put over pork when I served.  Heavenly!!!!

I made this for my husband.  It turned out amazing.  Since it has been cold out we cooked it in the oven like other reviews said.  I have now made this multiple times and I would stick with the recipe and how it is.

This is great with only 1 T. of chipotle chile pwd. The end slices are very spicy so watch out!  I baked at 350 degrees until meat thermo reached 150 degrees around 40 minutes.  Cannot wait until grilling weather to try it on the grill! Very tender.  I did not reduce the sugar.

Fantastic! I marinated the pork in pineapple juice for about four hours and cut the chile powder down to 2T and it was great, but I think that 3 would have been too much. And this is coming from a family that loves spice. Served with mashed sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts.

Super easy and tastes great! I used sea salt, 1.5 Tbsp chipotle chile powder, 1/2 Tbsp cayenne, one 1.25lb tenderloin, and kept the other ingredients the same. I let the meat sit in the spices for 4 - 5 hours.

We had to cook inside - pan seared on med heat, 4 mins each side, then put on a roasting rack/pan to bake at 400 degrees. (Coat with cooking spray!) Baked 10 minutes on each side, then removed to "tent" under foil for another 10 minutes.

The spice was not overwhelming. We served this with a romaine salad with feta, cranberries, pecans, and raspberry balsamic, which was a nice break from the spice. Also had mashed red potatoes. 

The only bad thing is... we don't have any leftovers!!

It was way, way, way too spicy. My nose started running, and my eyes were watering. My wife had to cut off the rub, which turned into a nice crust, to eat it. It would be a five-star recipe with some adjustments to the spices. It needs about 1/3 as much chipotle and about twice as much brown sugar. A little dry mustard might add a little more depth to the flavor. All we could taste was fire. Did I mention that it was really spicy? I will note, though, that my recipe featured four hunks rather than two. That increased the surface area. But it wouldn't have mattered. One bite of that crust set off the alarms.

This has become one of our favorite ways to make pork tenderloin.  I have small children, so I need to reduce the chipotle by at least half.  I also sear mine in a grill pan on the stove and then finish in the oven.  We prefer it a little pink on the inside - because it's just so amazingly tender and juicy that way - so I take it out of the oven when the temp hits about 151 degrees, then tent with foil for about 10 min before slicing.  Absolutely fantastic!

Didn't have the chipotle powder so I used hot sauce instead.  It was excellent.  Lots of spice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Family had it with Paella as a side.  Really good.

Very good, but the 20min cooking time is excessive.  15min tops for a 1lb tenderloin, I pulled mine at 18 and found it mid-well when I want medium.  A 3/4lb like in the recipe would be done in 13~14

I went by the recipe except that I injected the tenderloins with sweet chipolte lime sauce. Everyone that tried it was doing backflips until they got too full to jump anymore. You could inject it with any complimentory sauce that you have or prefer, like plum chipolte sauce or raspberry.

You're Kidding, Right???  I like spicy food but cut back to 2 tbsp. because my kids don't like the heat and had one extra tenderloin than the recipe called for.  It was WAY TOO SPICY and a waste of an expensive cut of meat. If I were to try this again, which I won't, I would only use one tsp. of the chipolte chili powder.

I agree with a recent review - the heat matter is semantics - there is a difference between bottles labeled "chipotle chili powder" and straight up "chipotle chili pepper." I used one tablespoon of the pepper and it was just about perfect, my spicy food-loving friends said it could have used just a tiny bit more. But they gobbled it all up anyhow, this recipe is fantastic!

Yum, yum! I made a 1 lb. tenderloin with a half recipe of the spices, but only 2 teaspoons of chile powder. It was too windy to barbecue, so I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes, and it was tender and juicy and delicious! My husband found the leftovers on the kitchen counter and almost finished them himself. I'll be making this again for sure!

Great! We used a venison tenderloin. Like another reviewer, I marinated the plain tenderloin in pineapple juice, cider vinegar, and brown sugar for a few hours. For the rub, I halved the chili powder (husband does NOT like spicy) and added paprika and cumin. While the meat was cooking, I added a good dose of chili powder to the marinade and boiled it down until thick and drizzled it over the sliced meat. My husband said it's one of the best tenderloin meals he's ever had. (!)

If I could give this 10 stars I would! I halved the recipe and only used 2 tsp of the chili powder.  Spicy and Delicious!!
My husband ate the leftovers for lunch, and he doesn't even like pork.

OOPS! I used a fraction of the meat called for and ended up with a thick, spicy crust all over it. Amazing. Everyone in my house asked what the great smell was! I'll ease up on the spice by getting the correct ratios next time. any variance from perfection stemmed from my mistake with this recipe.

Used chipotle peppers out of a can (two, minced very fine as well as the juice.) Delicious flavor. Next time I will marinate longer than the recommended time. Served on soft polenta. My husband and I really liked the combination of flavors, though we would like a little more spice next time.

Husband really liked this one!  I DID make 1 change ahead of time:  I reduced the amount of brown sugar from 4 T. to 2 T---I didn't want the smoky flavor and sweetness to fight each other, I don't like overly sweet meats, and I wanted less charring from the sugar as it cooked.  Sugar does burn whether on the grill or cooked on the stovetop.
I cooked this in a skillet instead of the grill.  Browned it on all sides, then lowered the heat to Low/Simmer for about 15 minutes to bring the inside to a medium.  Turned out super!  I served with green beans that had a simple butter-olive oil sauce.   Sides might need to be simple preparations so they don't upstage the wonderful pork and its coating!

Delicious.  Let the meat stand at room temperature instead of in the fridge for more even grilling.  Brushed the tenderlions with oil before grilling.

I only used 1 Tbl of chipotle chili powder and it was just enough heat.  I liked the suggestion of marinating the pork in pineapple juice.  I grilled the pineapple chunks and it was a nice compliment to the pork.

At first glance, this recipe doesn't have much going for it. It's title includes two of my least favorite words "crust" and "loin". But, rest assured, this recipe is off the charts. It will shake your loins with it's goodness.

IN LOVE!!  I followed the recipe exactly as it stated for ingredients, but marinated it overnight.  When I grilled the slices, I drizzled them with some pineapple juice and served a grilled pineapple ring with them.  A little heat and a little sweet!  My guys all loved it!

I found the best advice was from a previous reviewer who pointed out the recipe called for 3 tbsp of "chipotle chili powder" not just chipotle chili PEPPER which was what I had. There is a BIG difference in the two. So I used 2 tbsp of standard chili powder and 1/2 tsp of the chipotle chili pepper. It was spicy but not too hot. I think maybe this is where all the others were having the problem with the hotness. My family loved it. I'm going to try it on chicken next.

Loved this!  I did *tweak* as I used equal amounts of everything but the salt.  I used 4 tbsp to just 1 of the salt and I used a 3 pound+ pork loin.  I added black pepper as well.  The heat was perfect for us and I might even add more chipotle next time.  Be aware that chipotle powder can vary in heat levels.  We like HOT but you may wish to back down the amount recommended if unsure how hot your chipotle powder is the first time if you make this.  Great recipe you can play around with!**7-30-12**  tripped the recipe and used on 3 racks of ribs.  FANTASTIC!

I tweaked this to our liking and now it's one of my favorite recipes. I use 'medium'Chili Powder from Penzeys and I also use Ground Chipotle from Penzeys. These are two totally different spices. If you try to use 3 TBS of ground chipotle it would be inedible in my opinion! I use 1 tsp each of onion powder, garlic powder and kosher salt, then 2 TBS Chili Powder (like you'd use for chili!) 2 TBS brown sugar, and 1/4 tsp Ground Chipotle. I rub on the tenderloin and then roast in a 375* oven for 25 minutes, then rest for 10 minutes before slicing. I always serve with Chipotle Mashed Sweet Potatoes, which are just cubed sweet potatoes simmered until tender, 1 TBS of butter and 2 minced chipotle peppers and a generous spoonful of the Adobo sauce from the can whirled with an electric mixer until smooth. Perfect dinner with just enough spicy/smoky/sweet!

I'm sorry but I didn't care for this.  I didn't like the flavor of the rub.  I won't be making this one again.  Still searching for a tenderloin recipe that the kids and I like.

This was outstanding. Even my wife who does not like spicy food enjoyed it. Tender and flavorfull. I made no changes to the recipe; it is perfect for my taste; but I would recommend adjusting the chipotle chili powder to taste.

Oh my gosh! This was sooooo good!!! I followed the recipe exactly. DO NOT skip the fridge part. I actually cooked mine under the broiler for 20 minutes...flipping them every 5 minutes. I actually made chops out of my loins, and I only made one because I'm only cooking for two. My husband tore it up! (OK, so I didn't EXACTLY follow the recipe) lol This is going in the recipe rotation! Thanks!

My family loved this dish, but the first comment from everyone was, "It's sooooo spicy!".  Everyone voted it a definite keeper, but asked that I use less chile powder next time (and I had actually used less than what the recipe called for).

Cooked this with Pork chops in the oven - it turned out okay, but grilling adds a lot, flavor wise. I'd recommend grilling (on coals instead of gas) this instead of cooking it in the oven.

1 word:  YUMMY!  I did change it up a bit after reading some of the other reviews.  Marinated the tenderloin in pineapple & minced garlic overnight.  Combined 1-1/2 tsp ea of garlic powder & onion powder with 1-1/2 tsp salt & 5 Tbsp brown sugar.  I couldn't find chipotle chile powder, but I found chipotle cubes and crushed them up and added chili powder.  Added that with the other spices to finish up making the rub.  Put the spices in the plastic bag with the tenderloin & shook it.  Refrigerated overnight.  The next evening, we had horrible weather, so I pre-heated my oven to 400 degrees and put the tenderloins in a baking dish and baked for approximately 40 minutes (meat temp @ 160).  Let stand for 10 min before slicing.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing Kramnodrog!

My whole family loves this and I cook it frequently.  I cut the chipotle powder to 1 tablespoon.  I also slice the tenderloin and put the rub on the pieces to give them more flavor.  Wonderful!

Was very good and easy to prepare. Did'nt have a loin but used a few pork chops. If you make the polenta make sure you add something to it like chesse. Just cooking it plain was not good for me. polenta would be really good with a can of chili over the top.

I would give this 3.5 if I could.  It was good, but not something we loved.  I found it was too much chili, next time I would cut it down to 1tbsp.

Good rub.  Sweet and spicy, just how I like them.  Chipotle chili shines in the rub.  Complimented the pork real well.

The simplicity of this recipe and the time from fridge to table is great.  When I read the review about how hot it was, I thought my Texas boyfriend and I would love it because our idea of mild or medium is hot to most people.  But I have to admit, it was way too hot.  It overpowered the flavor of the entire meal.  I had one smaller and one larger tenderloin, and when grilled for 20 and 25 minutes respectively, they were both just a wee bit too done, but still quite juicy.  We cut up the leftovers and added them to plain rice, and that was pretty good.  There are a lot of pork rub recipes out there, so I'll keep looking instead of trying to modify this one.

Yum! What a FANTASTIC way to enjoy pork!!! I'm always pleased when I find a recipe that is tasty AND a snap to prepare. This literally took less than a half hour to cook and even less than that to woof down (it was THAT good!) :) Since I was only serving my hubs and myself, I used only one of the 1 lb. pork tenderloins I purchased. I could only find a 2 lb. terderloin (which I planned to cut in half), but to my surprise, the package contained (2) 1 lb. tenderloins! I halved the rub ingredients even tho my tenderloin was slightly larger than  3/4 lb. and thought the heat level was spot on. For a fun twist, as Rachel did (see pic - no review), I too cubed my pork for fajitas. While our tenderloin was smoking away, my hubs grilled up some skewers of red / yellow peppers and onion. We piled our tortillas with our grilled goodies and garnished with fresh pico and guacamole. By far, these were the best fajitas EVER! Served with a side of Mexican rice, tortilla chips and mojitos, this was one seriously good meal. Thanks SOOO much for sharing, KRAMNODROG. :-) I'm defiinitely adding this to my regular meal rotation.

This was pretty good and I will probably make it again BUT even though I only used 1 T. of the chipotle chile powder, it was still too hot for my kids so I would reduce that a bit more, or maybe try regular chile powder instead.  I can't even imagine eating it with the full 3 T.!!!

Couldn't grill, had to broil (6 minutes on each side did the trick), but was fantastic. Can't wait to try on a charcoal grill.

Oops! I misread the title of this Pork Tenderloin… saw the photo and thought it was going to get something I would like to make… sorry, I’m just not one of the folks in the world that likes to inflame his taste buds to the point of watery eyes and pain.  For those others out there that dig in, to the delight of their “significant others’”, I offer up this cure for that “HOT” that just can’t seem to be cooled.  Capsaicin the chemical compound that causes the burn is not water soluble, so drinking milk, soda, water or juice will not remove that burn and kill the pain you are experiencing.  Alcohol however will dissolve Capsaicin therefore, have a bottle of your favorite alcohol on the table… when you feel the burn and can no longer tolerate the pain take a sip, swirl it around your mouth… don’t swallow… get rid of it and then enjoy to the delight of the person that took the time to prepare that marvelous meal.  Buzz ~

This was an excellent pork loin.  My husband LOVED IT!  I would, however, recommend using 1/2 - 1 Tbsp of Chipolte powder.  This was very spicy when made as directed. Otherwise, it was excellent!!!

We love this recipe!  The first time I made it I did it as directed was way to spicy for my taste, so since then I decreased the chipotle chile powder to 1 tablespoon and it turned out great.  I have also used this recipe to make pork fajitas by cutting the pork in thin strips and adding the mixture, we then cooked it in a stir fry pan on the grill and served with grilled peppers and onions on fajita shells. YUMMY!!!

This was absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed about it was I used pork chops and I cooked it on the stove top in the skillet and used olive oil which made them nice and tender! This is something I will definetly will be making again!

Very good recipe.  The tenderloin that I used was about 2.75 pounds - I cut the tenderloin in 3rds and then used 1/2 the recipe on each 3rd.  The next time I make this (definitely a keeper), I plan on mixing the spices first, ignoring the plastic bag suggestion, and using this as a rub.  We marinated the meat for 2-3 hours (in the fridge).

My family absolutely loved this. My husband made it on a charcoal grill, with wood, and it was so outstanding. The only thing I changed, is that I cut the chipotle powder to 3 tsp instead of 3 tbs, (glad I did) especially since the powder  was fresh!! Loved this

Excellent.  I added some chopped rosemary to coating mixture and rolled tenderloin tightly in ziplock bag.  I let it sit in fridge for about an hour to soak up coating mix,  The best tendrloin I have ever made.  Thanks for a perfect recipe.

I'm a wimp when it comes to spicyness so it wasn't surprising that I found it way too much. Husband, however, loved it. I seared the tenderloin in a skillet, then finished it off in the oven, about 25 mins. It was a little overcooked but still good. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Thanks, mark!

I used chipolte sauce instead of the chipolte powder.  I mixed all the spices in the sauce then dipped each pork chop into the mixture.  Absolutely delicious - my wife's new favorite pork chop recipe!!

Outstanding.  My wife absolutely loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a Southwest Chipotle seasoning.  It had just the right amount of "heat".  I forgot to oil the grill grate, so there was a little sticking, but the meat looked as good as it tasted!  This will be great for cookouts.  I think the rub would be good on chicken too, I will try that next.

This came out pretty good, but I used others suggestions and cut chipotle chile powder in half, and was still pretty spicy. I could not even imagine eating it with the full dose of chile powder.  Grilled flavor was good.

Wowzers!! This was great. I cut the recipe in half for just one tenderloin.  I love hot stuff so it was perfect for me.  However, dh was fanning and drinking the whole time, but loved it as well.  Next time I may cut back on some of the heat.  Im looking forward to making some pork fried rice tomorrow!

Can't I give more than 5 stars?  This was great!  But then I like spicy.  You might need to look around a bit to find the Chipotle Chile Powder took me a couple of stores but the search will be worth it.  Can't wait to experiment with it on other recipes.  Thanks for a terrific one!

To some who recently said they made with chili power since that was all they had trust me find the chipotle and make it again.  It is a totally different taste!

OMG was this spicy for us.  I followed directions exactly and had very moist tenderloin but I would definetely have to cut down on the chipotle chile powder next time I make.  Other than that, they were very good & moist.  Thanks

Very easy and extremely tasty recipe!  My boyfriend said they were the best pork chops he had ever had (and we experiment with pork chop recipes all the time).  I used McCormick Mesquite Grill Mates seasoning -- couldn't find Chipotle seasoning.  I will defnitely cook this again, hopefully with Chipotle.  Also, took suggestions of using less brown sugar - about 3T instead of 4.

I used Pork chops instead of the tenderloin, and my husband LOVED it.  The flavor was wonderful, but it was way too spicy for me.  I used Chipotle Chilie Pepper Powder, and would probably cut that in half next time.  Everything else about the recipe is great!!

I made this recipe last month for my boyfriend. WOW! I was not expecting how flavorful this rub would be. The only change I made was to decrease the chipotle powder by 1 tbsp since my boyfriend is a bit of a wimp about spice. He grilled the meat and enjoyed it so immensely that took all the credit at the end of the meal. Delicious.

Excellent rub!!!!!! I've used this rub on a pork tenderloin on the grill and tonight I am doing a boneless pork roast in the oven (because it's pouring outside). The only change to the recipe I do is I use 2 teaspoons of the chipotle chili powder. For the oven method I put the roast in at 450 for 30 min and then turned oven down to 350 for another 40 min (until internal temp was 160) both ways are very good but I like it on the grill a little better. Served it with cheesy hash brown potatoes (recipe on this site) and French cut green beans. If you are not a huge fan of spicy food just cut back on the chipotle chili powder and experiment with the amount to suit your personal taste but this rub is very tasty and is perfect on your pork loin. Thank you for sharing!!!!!

I basically made half of this recipe for one pork tenderloin, cutting the chipotle powder back to just 1 t.  I prepared this early in the afternoon and let the coated tenderloin marinate in the refrigerator until it was time to grill.  This was good and still had a little heat.  And it doesn’t get any easier than this!

One of my favorite meals. We love super hot so the seasoning portions are perfect. It's hot, but still has an amazing flavor. I have made this a lot if times and every time it's fantastic!

This was great!  My husband kept carrying on about how good it was.  The best part was he did the cooking :-)  Our tenderloins were bigger than the recipe called for so I just doubled the rub ingredients.

OK, it's like this: the flavor COULD be excellent if not for the excessive use of chipotle chile powder.  3 tablespoons is just plain crazy.  Based on several reviews, I only used 1.5 tablespoons and it was still too much.  Two teaspoons would be plenty.  Maybe it's a typo?  I used boneless chicken thighs which was a good choice.

This is really delicious and very easy to make, but a word of warning- go easy on the chipotle powder! My husband and I love chipotle chiles, but even we thought this was too spicy. We could barely eat it when following the recipe, so the next time I made it I cut the chipotle in half.

Pretty good. I thought it needed a bit more acidity, but my family thought it was great as is. Maybe some citrus or something in the marinade. I marinaded this overnight in pineapple juice as suggested by some reviewers, but didn't find that much of the flavor came through. I think this would be nice served together with grilled pineapple, though. I will try that next time.

*note* I'm also thinking that 'chipotle chili powder' is different from brand to brand/ place to place. I have some that I purchased from Bulk Barn, and while it has a bit of kick, it's not what I would call 'spicy'. I read some reviews claiming this was super spicy, and some that claimed that it wasn't spicy in the least. My advice... taste your chipotle chili powder. I don't think that they are all made equally.

very yummy & different. I LOVE spice, and this was perfect cutting the chipotle in half to 1.5 tablespoons. I think more and you will really narrow your audience down who likes this. we baked in the oven since the grill wouldn't start, and cooked it for twice as long at 350.

I was looking for something to do with my pork tenderloin and this looked good.  The package of pork I had was about double what the recipe called for, so I doubled all the ingredients except the chipolte.  I also baked it rather than grilled it.  It was very good and extremely tender.  It also froze well, which is a big plus for me.  When I thawed it out for lunch today, it was just as tender and jucy as when I first made it.

I tried this for boneless chops and it was great.  I used 4, but the recipe would have coated 5 or 6.  I used garlic salt for the garlic powder and salt.  I grilled on med-low covered for 5 minutes and turned for another 5, uncovered.  Can't wait to do this with tenderloin as it was intended.

we used this rub on some ribs we smoked tonight.  Fabulous!!!  I did cut back on the chipotle seasoning to just 1 TBS and doubled everything else.  There was a good balance of heat and sweet with the brown sugar. My new favorite rub!!

This was wonderful!!!!  Did a couple of things different.  I used 3 tsp of regular chili powder and also about 1 tsp of Tony's lite.  Baked for 1 hour, since I had really big tenderloins, and ta da!  It was PERFECT!!!  Thank you so much for sharing!

okay-this was so good I was inspired to rate this recipe.  I made it exactly as written except for the chipotle chili powder-I used 2 TBSPN regular chili powder.  I have 3 picky kids and they are cirlcling the carcass trying to eat the leftovers.  Awesome and easy!

This was fantastic.  I was afraid to use too much of the chili powder because I can't handle spicy foods.  I double the recipe (we had a big party), which would have been 6 tbsp of chili powder.  I only used 2-3 and I couldn't taste any of the chili powder.

I also had to use a regular pork loin, not a tenderloin, because of cost and the amout of people we had.  I was REALLY suprised at how amazing this turned out.  I did take advice from others and marinate it in pineapple juice for several hours before.

Very Tasty!  Going to keep this recipe.  I couldn't find any chipotle chile powder at Wal-Mart, so I ended up buying some Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning and only used about 2 Tablespoons of that, as a guesstimate (wasn't sure how much of a kick it had).  After coating and letting it sit, I seared the meat on a frying pan on all sides, before tossing it in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes.  Tossed in a side of Velveeta sheels and cheese with Rotel...very good dinner.  Thanks!

Great flavor, but a bit too hot.  I think next time I will reduce the pepper some.  I did roast it in the over, as opposed to grilling as the recipe called for.

Nice! I cut the Chipoltle seasoning down to 1T and it wasn't quite enough, so I'll bump it back up to 2T next time! Per others' suggestions, I marinated the pork in juice (orange, lime and cranberry) plus chopped scallions. I did this overnight. Then about 2 hours before we wanted to grill it, we brought it to room temp and then added the rub. The outside of the pork gets a little burn-y (thanks to the brown sugar in the rub) but it was still delicious. We all liked it! Thanks for sharing.

This was absolutely delicious.  I only gave it four stars because it was really spicy, even for me.  I had to wash some of the rub off after cooking.  Still, it was DELICIOUS!!!  The blend of flavors is really great - it was just too spicy for me.  Great recipe.  I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent recipe!  The combination of spicy & sweet is delicious!  I have made this many, many times now & it is always a hit. I have been asked for the recipe several times. The only change I make is to reduce the Chipotle pepper down to about 1 - 1.5 tbls.  This is plenty spicy! If you always order the hottest buffalo wings you might want to use the full amount but if not, you'll definitely want to cut back on the chipotle.

This was fantastic! I didn't have chipotle powder, so I used a chili pepper mix I bought from a Mexican supermarket. I like it spicy, and this was the perfect amount of heat. Can't wait to make it again!

Will have to make again. We absoLUTEly love spicy food and this was too intense. Too much heat, not enough flavor. Will make again and adjust because you can tell it has excellent potential.

We loved the "kick" that this has, especially for such a simple recipe.  At the recommendation of the other reviews, I also cut the chile powder in half, and we found it to be perfect; so I would suggest playing with this ingredient to suit your family's taste.

Fabulous rub!   I have used this on pork and chicken. This can be spicy so you might want to go easy at first unless you like your food above medium hot. We loved it and will be using it often on different cuts and types of meat. Thank you for posting KRAMNODROG.

This recipe is wonderful!!  I cut the chile powder by 1/3.  Even at that amount, it has a nice "bite" to it.  The meat is very juicy and not dry at all.

This is soooo good.  Not for the faint of heart as it does have a lil kick to it;)  But I have southern roots so I like a little spice.  It turned out perfect, crusty and tender.
Update:  I realized I'm using Chipotle 'pepper' instead of 'powder'...maybe that's why mine is a little more spicy.  BUT...I love it this way!!

this was awesome, juicy and spicy!

 I followed the recipe as stated.  I grilled it over lump charcoal for 25 minutes.  I turned the meat every 5-6 minutes.  It was pulled when it hit 160º.  I covered it on the counter for 15 minutes before slicing it. Use less spice if you don't like a lot of heat.

This is an amazing and VERY easy recipe for pork tenderloin.  By far the best tenderloin I've had.  I do agree with others that if you are using a high-quality chipotle (like from Whole Foods), you should use about 2/3 or 3/4 the amount.  I LOVE hot foods, but the full 3 tablespoons had my sinuses and eyes burning for an hour.  It took away from the flavor of a nice organic tenderloin.  I say cut it down a bit and taste ALL the flavors.

I cooked this in the oven following my Better Homes and Gardens cookbook: 425 degrees for about 20-30 minutes until meat thermometer registers 160 degrees.  Let stand 10 minutes before carving.

Tried this recipe out tonight & it was wonderful & EASY!! By the time i started it & finished cooking it, it was no more then an hour. Would of been shorter but i marinated the tenderloins for about 30 min also i took others suggestions and only put 2 tsp of regular chili powder because i did not have chipotle chile powder. Next time however i think i will double the ingredients and marinade it over night. Can't wait!! Definitely worth a try.

This was really very good.  A little on the spicy side for the Kid's so in the future I would use only half the Chipolte Chili powder and add the other half of traditional chili powder.  It really is also key to cook this on low temp

I reduced the chipotle chili powder and it was still too hot.  It was edible with mashed potatoes to cut the heat, but we will not make this again.

This pork is so easy and sooooo good!  I too used less chipotle powder.  The rub tasted hot before I put it on the pork, but after it was much milder.  I won't change the recipe the next time I make it which will be very soon.

This is fantastic! I made it 2 nights ago and making again for company tomorrow night. I marinated it in pineapple juice overnight, then rubbed on the rub and let that marinate about 4 hours. I mixed regular chilli powder and cayenne as I can't find the chipolte kind. It was SO tender and juicy and just perfect! I also used splenda brown sugar blend as we have to watch our blood sugar. I can't say enough about how good this is!! Thanks for sharing!

this was amazing! the whole family raved about it! the taste was amazing, the crust kept all the juices in so it was moit and succulant. Yummy will make again and again...i did increase the garlic and the garlic powder to 1 Tbs each and added 1 Tbs of Regular Chili powder and only 2 Tbs of the Chipotle Chili Powder. I also left it sit in the spices in the plastic bag in the frig for 24 hours. it was sooo sooo good!!!! I made garlic mashed potatoes and a beef bordeau gravy sauce with it...

The flavor of this pork tenderloin is amazing!  I couldn't find chipotle chile powder so I used McCormick's Hot Mexican-Style Chili Powder and it was delicious.  I loved the hint of heat and sweetness.  I will be using this recipe often in the future.  Thanks for sharing.  :)

We had some problems with this, which were my error I think. I used a pork loin that was way too big. By the time it finally cooked through the outside was burnt. My husband thought the seasoning was perfect had it not been burnt. I will try this again  since I think it has a lot of potential and report back.

Very good & so easy!  I cut the chipotle chile down to one big teaspoon & it was plenty. Nice blend of sweet & spicy. 3T would be HOT for sure. My 9 & 7 yr old both liked it, a little spicy for the 7 yr old but you can cut off the spicy crust. I will make this again for sure.

The absolute best pork tenderloin I have ever eaten.  I actually thawed the tenderloin to put in my slow cooker this morning, and I forgot to start it.  I needed a recipe that didn't require a lot of marinating time that used ingredients that I already had.  This was perfect!  I made the rub in a gallon sized bag, put the pork in, mushed it around and put it in the fridge for about 45 minutes.  We cooked it on the grill, and I could not believe how few ingredients could be so flavorful and how moist the pork stayed.  The entire family was going on and on about how great it was.  This will definitely be a recipe that I will make often.  Thanks!

Tip..sear meat at a higher temp, then put on indirect heat. that seems to prevent burning. I needed to tone the Chipotle down a bit for the kids, but it had a pleasant nip along with the brown sugar sweet. I'll do this one again.

Awesome flavor. We live in a NYC apartment, so no grill. 20-25 minutes in the oven at 425 got it nice and juicy without drying it out.

This is not my usual rub, but I was looking for something different this time.  It is deliciously sweet and spicy . . . hubby and kids loved it.  I made it for extended family, and they loved it, too.  I grilled it over lump charcoal and hickory chunks.  This rub caramelizes beautifully!

This is one of our favorites!  It is also I nice and easy prep ahead and freeze recipe.  I buy a whole tenderloin cook one and freeze the other for our family of 3.  Then I have another meal ready to cook for busy nights.

Delicious.  I love hot, but this was a bit too much spice for even me.  I think next time I'll cut back on the chipotle, but wonderful flavor and quick to make.

Absolutely amazing with just a few changes! I changed the proportions to 1/2 tsp garlic, 1/2 tsp onion, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp chipotle chili and 2 tsps brown sugar. I used a 6oz can of pineapple juice, moistening the spices just enough to make a paste to rub on the tenderloin. The remaining pineapple juice and 1/4 cup brown sugar were mixed together for basting every 15 minutes. I put this on an electric rotisserie at 350 for about 40 minutes. Delish, and so completely tender and full of flavor. The smokiness of the chipotle and the sweetness of the pineapple melded together harmoniously... all my mother in law could say was "wow" :) (note: served this with light scallion mashed potatoes, steamed lemon asparagus and fresh steamed and buttered corn. yum!)

5 stars, hands down!  I followed the directions for the most part.  After reading reviews, I cut the chipotle chili powder back to 1/2 Tbsp. and this was plenty of heat for us and we love spicy foods.  I also marinated this overnight.  It grilled up to juicy perfection and everyone loved it.  Be sure to cover with tinfoil and let set 10 min. before cutting to ensure juiciness.

This recipe was great.  If you don't like it spicy, maybe back off on the chili powder, but we followed the recipe.  Only difference was we had a 3 lb pork loin, which still worked fine, and we had do do it in the oven at our apartment.  Cooked it at 400 for around 30 minutes, to an internal temp of about 165, and it turned out great.  Very juicy with a delicious crust from the dry rub.  We'll definitely make this again soon!

I don't know why I didn't read the reviews ahead of time, as I usually do. My husband and I LOVE spicy hot food, but this was way to much.  I had to rinse off my pork just to eat it! I wonder if they meant 3 tsps, instead of TBS. The smoky flavor was great, though. Next time I'll use 1 TBS chipotle pepper and make up the rest of the smoky flavor with smoked paprika, which is mild.

Wow.  This has some heat and we like it hot.  The flavour is marvelous but next time I think I'll cut back the chipotle powder to about a tablespoon.  I've only had one little slice to try before dinner and my tongue and lips are burning.  I think this would be amazing on sandwiches where the bread can cut the heat a bit.  Thank so much for posting - this will become a family favourite.

I used 1 teaspoon of the Chipotle POWDER and it was plenty spicy for our family (we are a medium kinda family).  I didn't want to mess with the grill so I cooked at 350 for nearly 40 minutes and broiled briefly.  Was very delicious and moist; definitely will cook again!

Da bomb. Done it many times, only changed chipolte to 1/3 amount as suggested by many and added a little minced garlic.  It's been a hit every time. I have even used cayenne papper once in a pinch and it still was awesome.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this dish. Definitely my fav pork recipe ever!  Don't get carried away with the chipotle powder though, I always only use about 1/4 of what the recipe calls for. I usually bake this wrapped in foil (cuz of the mess) for like 40 minutes at 350.

This was VERY GOOD! Like another reviewer suggested I put them in pineapple juice with some brown sugar, cumin, onion and garlic powder and let them sit for a few hours.  Then I mixed the rub but only used 2 tablespoons of mccormac chipolte pepper.  I used 2 tsp of garlic and onion 5 tbls of brown sugar and threw in some cumin.  Let them sit with the rub for several hours and then grilled them.  Use indirect heat on the grill or you will badly burn the brown sugar!

This is a great starter recipe.  I took some hints from a previous reviewer, CAMMYSAUCE, and cut the chipotle chili by 2/3 and increased the other spices.  I also made a brine of apple juice, garlic powder, salt and brown sugar and let the tenderloin brine for about 2 to 3 hours.  The tenderloin was delicious and really, really succulent.  I think next time I will substitute the chipotle for powdered mustard.  All in all, very, very good!

we really enjoyed this- the reviews made me nervous (and I was making it the first time for my in laws) so I cut down drastically on the chipotle powder, used maybe 1/2 tbsp (if that) on one tenderloin. next time I'd probably use a little bit more but I liked the flavor. Didn't grill it, but seared it in a pan on 3 sides & then baked it at 400 til the internal temp was about 142, then let rest for about 5 min.

I would 100% recommend decreasing the chipotle spice that is so prominent in this recipe.  A little goes a long way.  I was going to warn my husband about decreasing the spice but he had mixed the seasoning before I had a chance.  As it stands the chipotle is very overpowering and was so hot that we had to trim off the outside of the pork.  However, even after this we think with a small modification to the spices (as others have recommended) it is still have a very flavorful and easy recipe.  We will definitely make it again.

Fantastic!!!  Definitely heed the warnings of others, chipotle chili pepper is HOT!!!  Thankfully, I read the reviews before making this so I tasted just a tiny bit of the powder and WOW it is powerfully hot.  I chose to use just under 3 Tbsp. of normal chili powder instead and added only about 1/2 tsp. of the chipotle powder, just for taste but not heat.  It was wonderful!  I did a pork tenderloin and 4 chops and it worked well on both.  I baked mine at 325 for about 45 minutes instead of grilling.

WARNING:  it's catch-on-fire hot!  I should have read the reviews before I tried this recipe; I'll definitely cut the chile powder in half next time.  I found the chipotle chile powder in the Spice Islands Collection (note: it’s a little expensive).  I marinated the pork in the fridge for 45 minutes or so, wrapped it in aluminum foil, and baked it at 425 degrees for 25 minutes.  Then I uncovered it for additional browning, 10 more minutes or so.  Outstanding spicy, smoky flavor!  I’ll definitely try it again.

This was a really great recipe.  Pork had a little bite on the edge and great flavor inside.  It also made some great sandwiches.

Excellent recipe!!!!  Ended up using a combination of 2 tbsps ground cayenne and 1 tbsp chilli powder - it was awesome - very tender and juicy and great flavouring!  Was a home run the night after - even cold!!  
Will try the original recipe as soon as I get the Chipotle powder - looking forward to it.

I used 2 tablespoons of cumin and 1 tablespoon of chili powder in place of the chipolte chili powder.  It took about 25 minutes to cook the pork to 160 degrees rather than 20 minutes.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time. I, too, double it and sometimes use an entire pork loin verses just the tenderloin. Good Lord, is it divine!!!

Seasoning is good, but you have to cut the Chipoltle in half otherwise it will burn your taste buds off! = )

Delicious.  I made this with skinny chops and turned the spice rub into a marinade by using chipotle pepper sauce, fresh garlic and onions and a little but of brown sugar.  So good that I ate one a half...which almost NEVER happens!  Thank you!

This recipe was outstanding.  Used 1 Tbs of McCormicks Chipotle Chile PEPPER, not powder (could be semantics, but there is a difference) and the heat was just right.  Had cut the tenderloins in 3 portions so we could all have end pieces!  Even better the following day sliced thinly in sandwiches...

Excellent recipe, the pork turned out juicy and flavorful! After reading the reviews, I reduced the chipotle powder to 1 heaping Tablespoon, and even that was a little too much. I think the brand of chili powder (I used McCormick's)is what accounts for all the disrepancies in these reviews; if I had used all 3T the recipe called for, the pork would have been un edible.

I also made a sweet reduction sauce using pineapple juice concentrate, water, brown sugar, garlic and onion powder. The sauce really finished off the dish, as it blended a great mix of spicy meat with sweet sauce. Try it!

Wow! My roommate and I made this and LOVED it. It definitely packs a punch, but we both like spicy food, so that didn't bother us. She couldn't find chipotle chili powder, so we used Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning instead. We also don't have a grill, so we baked it for about 30 - 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Will definitely make again.

Hands down, this was the best, tenderest, most juicy pork roast I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly, only keeping it on the grill for and extra five minutes.  I thought it was perfect and none too spicy.  I wouldn't change a thing!!!!!

My b/f prepared this using boneless pork chops instead of a pork tenderloin and substituted a few canned chilis in adobo sauce and it didn't turn out well.  In fact, it had almost no flavor.  I think we will try it again using the tenderloin and I will buy the Chipotle chili powder.

Delicious.  I usually leave the chile out of the rub for one of the tenderloins, and then add 1 tbsp. for the larger one, that way my 11 yo doesn't complain about it being too spicy!  Great served with something sweet - mashed yams, candied carrots, etc.

Loved this recipe.  It was quick and easy.  This is very spicy, but my boyfriend and I like spicy stuff.  It was very good for leftovers also, I cut it up and put it in a salad the next day. Yummy. Its also low in fat, which is a big plus.

WOW!  This was FANTASTIC!  I used only 2 tablespoons of the chipotle chili powder becuase of other comments that it was too spicy.  So, I increased the onion powder and garlic powder by a 1/2 teaspoon each.  There was more than enough rub - it was spicy, but not overpowering.  I served this with another recipe on the site - Black Bean and Couscous Salad, and also grilled up some baby zucchini tossed with just some olive oil and S&P.  They were the perfect compliments to this tenderloin.

I have cooked with Chipotle powder before and knew how spicy it can be so I was really nervous about the amount in this recipe, but I decided to stick to it and I am glad that I did. My husband and I really enjoyed it. I served it with sauted onions with yellow and red peppers, which when they carmelized  had a nice sweetness that complimented the pork. I also was really glad that I had made "triple corn spoon bread" which I found on Cooking Light. This side dish has a natural sweetness to it, and also helped with the heat. I have a few friends that really like heat, I can't wait to make this for them. Thank you!

It was delicious!  Just a small warning - I didn't realize that it was a tenderloin and used pork chops and that's probably why it came out extremly spicy!!!!

This is a great pork recipe! I doubled the recipe due to using a larger pork loin. Also, for a bit more spice, tripled the chipotle’s in adobo. Grilled until the internal temp was 160. It came out perfectly medium. I was a bit skeptical of eat pork that was not well done, but it was so juicy and flavorful!

Awesome. Followed advice of others - marinaded in pineapple juice, minced onions & minced garlic overnight. Also cut Chipotle chili powder by 1/3. Still plenty hot! Grilled for 17 minutes to retain slight pinkness in tenderloin. Served with polenta and watermelon-feta salad. What a meal!

my family loved this recipe. 
someone wrote in their review that if you did not have chipotle chilli POWDER and were using chipotle chili pepper, then you needed to use a lot less and also would need to add a little ground cumin, oregano along with a bit more garlic powder. I did this and it was excellent. I am making this again right now.  I will marinate it over night and cook it for tomorrows dinner.

So easy and delicious! I had a single tenderloin piece that weighed 1.5 lbs. Although the surface area would be smaller than the two .75 lb pieces called for, I still used the entire amount of rub ingredients — except for chipotle. I halved that (used 1-1/2 TBS of Spice Islands ground chipotle chile). 

This rub was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. When I make two pieces next time, I'll double the rub except for chipotle powder. Since my tenderloin was larger, it took about 8 more mins to finish on the grill. It was SO juicy and tender and flavorful. We loved it! Thanks!

Excellent flavor!  I eat a lot of spicy food and this definitely has some heat to it.  Very good grilled.  I also made a cajun version and substituted cajun seasoning for the chipotle and added a little creole seasoning as well.

I used 1/3 of the Chipotle chili powder and seared in cast iron skillet and cooked in oven as one reviewer recommend. Delicious.

I bought the chipotle chili powder the day I made this.  I was think it would have a nice smoky tastes- WRONG.  This is HOT!  I made it as directed, BF liked it. Easy to make just not what I expected.  I like hot thing(the women who grows ghost peppers), but this came closed to ruining a nice tenderloin.

I'm the home cook that after 33 years of cooking NEVER makes a recipe as given.  I think of a recipe's as a "suggestion" :)  However, I was in a hurry so I whipped this up and stuck it in the fridge to marinate 4 hours.  OMG, it was delish.  We cooked it on the big green egg which also made it extra tasty but this is a KEEPER!

This was by far the best pork tenderloin I've ever made. I subbed regular chili powder for the chipotle chile powder; I'm sure the chipotle chile powder would make it even more marvelous. We ate it with sautéed garlic green beans and mashed coconut sweet potatoes.

I have made this twice now, the first time I followed the recipe and it was too spicy for the toddlers, the second time I doubled the recipe but only used a single amount for the chipotle, i saved half in a sealed jar for later use. There were no leftover either time, even the picky 2yr was asking for thirds. Both time I made this I used the rotisserie on my grill instead of direct grilling it.

Wow!  We really liked this.  It is a very spicy hot dish, but with some awesome flavor!  I put the tenderloin into the bag with all the seasonings and left it for an hour while we walked the dogs.  The brown sugar really helps to make a tasty crust on this, as well as lend some sweetness to the hotness.  This will be made again, though just because of personal preference I'll probably cut the chipotle down by a tablespoon.

This was very good! I think, however, there may be a typo in the Chipotle seasoning. I think 3 teaspoons of seasoning would be better. I used 2 Tablespoons of seasoning and it was VERY spicy. It is winter here, so no grill. I seared then tenderloins in a cast iron skillet, then finished them in the oven at 425 degrees for about 25 minutes. Went great with the oven roasted asparagus from this site! I am definitely making this again, but with less Chipotle pepper. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!  I  followed the recipe exactly the first time I made this and it was too spicy for our tastes. I made it again tonight and decreased the chipotle to 1 1/2 T and bumped the brown sugar up to 5 T.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I put the rub on yesterday afternoon and planned to grill it last night, but a meeting ran long and we ended up eating out.  I grilled it tonight and I think the extra time with the rub really enhanced the flavor of the meat.  I seared the tenderloin pieces on the hot grill, then moved it so it was roasting over indirect heat.  I turned it over about mid-way through and "basted" it with the liquid that had formed in the bag.  It took about 40 minutes total, because we like our pork cooked all the way through  (my grill temp was about 350).  I let it rest for a few minutes while I finished my sides and sliced it.  It was moist and so delicious!  Thank you for a great recipe.

Next time I make this I will dial down the spice but delicious all the same.  Rain ruined our grill plans so I seared it in an iron skillet then moved it to the oven at 350 for 20 minutes and it came out perfect!

This was okay, but I will change the recipe or find a new one next time around.  I made the rub exactly by the recipe. I did marinate my pork in a mixture of pineapple juice and brown sugar for 6-8 hours, then patted the meat very dry before applying the rub.  I let the meat rest 40 minutes before grilling. The outside crust was very flavorful and the meat was moist, but no flavor form the rub permeated the meat.

Omg!!! My boyfriend and I made this last night, and it is to die for!!! I swear it is amazing (as I'm having it for the second day in a row at lunch right now lol). It is super tender and moist. Plus, honestly, we are dummies when it comes to bar b queuing, and this was the most simple recipe to follow and we fell in love with it. (Little tip: pork tenderloin may be a little expensive, but we found some marked down due to close expiration date. Total cost of our meal...maybe $7 with tax...FOR 5 GOOD SERVINGS. You can't beat that!!)

Hot! It turned out very well other than that burning sensation left on my lips. We will make this again, but I will try using only 1 TBL spoon of the chili seasoning. I sadly did not check out the other reviews as usual.

Just made this!  I used shallot powder because I was out of onion powder.  Today wasn't good for grilling, so I preheated my oven to 425, then lowered it to 350 once I put it in.  It took about 45 minutes.  I did cover it with foil for 10 minutes after removing it from the oven.  It is spicy, though (I live in New Mexico, so I like spicy food).  My husband and I definitely give this 5 stars!

This recipe was awesome! My boyfriend and I both agreed that this one goes in our "Fav Box!"! well maybe he did actually call it our "FAV" box lol, but certainly a favorite. I stuck to the measurements above only I added a cup of cinnamon apple sauce and it was amazing and help to keep the tenderloin nice and moist on the brill while allowing it to add the crispiness.

Used hot Mexican style chili powder instead of chipotle. Marinated in crushed pineapple & juice with garlic, onion, & some chicken base. Sliced into the pork so the juices would penetrate all the way thru. I then broiled the pork for 7 min each side. It came out amazing!!!

I grill year round;  even when it's snowing.  Marinated the meat in Ponzu Sauce overnite, then let meat sit in rub for 3 hours.  I did some modifications to the rub - NO salt, and only 1 tablespoon Chipolte powder.  Our family eats Pork quite often, and this was a great change in pace.  Will certainly make it again!

My Husband and I love spicy food and this was VERY spicy.  It cooked beautifully on the grill, was moist and tender.  Next time I'll decrease the chipotle to 2T

This is by far the best pork I have ever made! We followed the recipe and heeded the following advice from other reviewers: 1) pineapple marinade for a few hours prior; and 2) reduced chipotle chile to 1T, which was the perfect silicones for a mixed audience. I will use 1.5 T next time and work my way up from there!

This recipe is quite good. However, there was way to much hot so I would half chipolte. The combination of hot/sweet was a big hit. I also cooked it in my cast iron skillet instead of a grill and this worked just as well. Just make sure you sear all sides of the tenderloin.

Our grilled pork tenderloin was tender and flavorful.  I cut back a little on the chipotle powder because I had never used it before and I wasn't sure how spicy it would be.  I will make it again the same way often.  It was a hit.

This was very spicy and hot.  Next time I will cut down on the chipotle powder.  I gave it four stars because once I do this, I think it will be good.  Made it a second time and used 1 tablespoon of the chipotle chili pepper and it was very good.  Still spicy but not overwhelming.

Loved the hot mixture.  Had to cut it down...very powerful.  I coated the pork with sweet orange marmalade and rolled the coated meat in the spices.  Cooked in the oven.  Excellent.  Also excellent on chicken.

It's spicy, but we love spicy. My boyfriend went to work the next day and bragged about this pork. He even ate the leftovers, and he NEVER touches left overs. Followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing but next time I think i will try marinating the meat in pineapple juice like some of the other reviews.

The whole family loved this recipe.  So quick and easy too. Per other reviewers recommendations, I cut the Chipotle Chili powder to 1 tablespoon and upped the brown sugar to 5 tablespoons and the spice level was perfect for us.  The pork was very tender and juicy.  This one is definitely being added to the routine dinner rotation list.  Excellent recipe!  Highly recommend!

I gave it 3 stars because the recipe calls for WAY too much chipotle powder....assuming it is speaking of ground up chipotle peppers. We use it often so I know how potent it is. For someone who isn't familiar, this would be way too much. We like our food spicy, and I used only 3 teaspoons of chipotle powder. I also had to slather apricot preserves at the end in order to tone it down for the whole family. Everyone liked it but there's no way we could have handled it if I hadn't added the apricot preserves at the end. It marinated in the spices for about 3 hours before I browned it in a pan and then cooked it in the oven at 400 for about 30 min.

Following everyone's helpful advice here, I used 2 tsp. chile powder instead of the chipolte powder, baked for 40 minutes at 425 degrees, let stand for 5 min., and it was perfect! (Line the baking pan in foil!).  Company worthy, says husband.

So easy & so delicious.  I used the recipe without doubling it, even though I had almost 3 lbs. of tenderloin and I didn't turn it as often. Turned out great.

The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I only used 1tbs of chipotle chili powder and I also marinated in pineapple juice for a few hours before I marinated in the spice mixture for a few hours. I made pork tacos out of this recipe. They turned out fabulous!

This was very good. I did use a larger tenderloin but it didn't seem to matter. I let it sit in the fridge with the seasoning for about 3 hours before grilling it. Amazing.

I thought this rub was good, but I think it would have been better if I had let it marinade it for more time. Maybe next time I'll do that pineapple juice thing people keep talking about. The cook time was right on.

I like the flavor of the rub itself, but there was WAY too much chile powder. If I make this again, I will cut that amount in half and double the brown sugar. This will make the pork much more edible.

This is pretty good.  Always looking for different/better ways to do pork tenderloin.  This is one of the better.  Paired this with some cheesy ranch potato bake and a salad and it was a very good dinner.

Geez louise!  I reduced the amount of chipotle chili powder to 1 Tbsp. (a third of what the recipe calls for) and this was still VERY spicy. I am pretty certain that 3 Tbsp. would be inedible for me.  The flavor is good and I really like the combo of sweet, hot, and smoky.  Plus, the meat turned out nice and juicy.  But this is waaaaaay too spicy as written.  Maybe not all chipotle powders are created equal?  I will make this again, but with substantially less of that particular component.  Don't forget to turn the pork often, or the sugar in the rub will definitely burn.

I made this last week and both my husband and I LOVED it!!  It will easily become a staple in this house!  I only used 1 tablespoon of chipotle chile powder, instead of 3.  I honestly couldn't imagine using 3, and we like spicy food!  I also added one more tablespoon of brown sugar and let the whole thing marinade in the fridge for 3+ hours.  Due to the snow storm, I baked it in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes and it was perfect at 148 degrees.  Again, we loved this recipe and can't wait to make it again.  Thanks to this recipe we've found a new spice we love, chipotle chili powder, even though it was $7 a jar!!  Thanks!!

Loved the rub and I love spicy food. I have actually never used Chipotle chili powder prior to trying this recipe so many many thanks for introducing me to a new awesome spice! This would be a 5 five star ratings but for one suggestion. The heat almost completely eclipses the sweetness. I would recommend reducing the chipotle chili powder down by at least half for an enjoyable heat and sweet taste! Thank you. Great recipe!

Loved this recipe! I did cut the chipotle powder to 1 1/2 tblsp to keep it family friendly. (My 3 yr. old even loved it). I am changing my cooking instructions to sear both sides first, then put on top rack on med. high for 20-25 min. 

Pork was still tender 2 days later out of the microwave!

Made this yesterday.  It was excellent - though I did have a little trouble cooking it on the grill and opted for the oven.  Will be making this again and again. :)

this was great, i had told my husband when he got back from deployment that we would eat something different every night, there's too much food out there to be eating the same thing over and over, but i will admit we have had this one twice so far.

4 stars a written.  Really easy and tasty.  We used regular chili powder so the 2 year could enjoy it too.  If you've never used chipotle powder, be warned - it's a little spicy.  Made a mango salsa to go with it, but ended up eating the salsa with chips because I didn't want to ruin the flavor of the pork.

This recipe was fast and delicious! Lots of pork recipes require an overnight marinade, but this rub requires only 20 minutes. Great for weeknight meals. We'll definitely make this again!

As another reviewer suggested, I cut back on the chipolte chile powder to 1 1/2 TBSP, and upped the brown sugar to 5 TBSP. Even with those drastic modifications, this rub was still WAY too hot . . . almost burns your mouth . . . not a pleasurable dining experience at all.  I advise all to find a different rub!

If my son says it's 5 stars, then it's 5 stars!!  He rarely rates things 5 stars, especially when they are spicy but he told me "Mom, I can still like things even though they are spicy".  The story is, I REALLY like spicy (I mean SPICY) and him, not so much.  Anywho, we both rated this 5 stars....made exactly as written, cooked over low heat on the grill for the amount of time specified and it came out perfect!  Wonderful recipe...thanks for posting!

This was pretty good but should warn that even though I LOVE spicy, it was a little too spicy so next time I'll back off the chipotle chili by 1 tablespoon. I felt it needed a little something more so next time I will try using pineapple juice as others have suggested.

Fantastic! I invited some paprika to the party and cut the tenderloin into 10oz chops then mixed it with a little oil and water. It then marinated for eight hours in the frig then one hour coming to room temp. Cook time was 10 min. on each side in the broiler. Very crispy on the outside and juicy good on the inside!

After buying 4 pork tenderloin roasts I found out that my wife does not like pork tenderloin. We've been able to identify grilling as the one way she does like it and this dry rub gave it a wonderful flavor. 

I did change it slightly however. Instead of putting the whole tenderloin on the grill I cut it into slices about 1" thick. I first put the spices on and let it sit for a few hours in the fridge. I then grilled the slices for about ten minutes total. The pork was especially tender and juicy and had a wonderful flavor. The only ingredient change was I only had chili powder insteady of chipotle chili powder but it still turned out really well.

I cut the amount of chile powder in half as my son avoids things that are too spicy - with this adjustment he downed it and it was still spicy enough for my husband and I to enjoy.  Also, I didn't have chipotle chile powder on hand, so I used regular chili powder.  We loved how quick and easy it was and will definitely be making this again.

yummmm it was so good! 

CROCK POTS ARE AMAZING! I threw the tenderloin in the crock pot this morning with 1.5 cups of water, and the spices that it called for (except I didn't have onion powder, I put a small onion instead... I also put some montreal steak spice, dry oregano and fresh parsley). 

I put it on low at 8am this morning, and at 3pm when I came home it was all done, the house smells yummy and I had to stop helping myself to it so that I could still be a little bit hungry for when my hubbie comes home later! :) 

Nice thing is that you don't have to follow it exactly, its very forgiving... I've never done a tenderloin before, I rarely do meat actually - so it's great that this one turned out, I'll def'ly come back to it again!

My kids absolutely loved this!  We usually have left-overs with two pork tenderloins and there was not a bite left.  We didn't have onion powder and used just regular chili powder and it still turned out great!  Simple and fast, too!

This was really good! I think that I didn't distribute the seasonings evenly because at first I thought some pieces were a little bit too spicy and some were too sweet, but as the meal went on, it got better. I love the spice! My husband loved the sweetness. I'm giving it 4 stars only because I feel like it is not one of my favorite dishes, though it is really tasty. I will make this again, especially since it's so easy and quick! Thanks!

Loved this! Thought the rub was a little too spicy before I put it on the meat, but it was just the right amount of heat after it was grilled.  (I did reduce the chili powder to 2 Tbsp, but kept everything else the same). Will be making this again!

I spiced this up with some homemade adobo sauce and additional chipotle spice. We like heat, and even the kids enjoyed the flavor without it being too much.

This is excellent if you LOVE hot and spicy.  My family, whom I thought could handle anything, thought this was a little too much heat.  However, I love it and make the rub to put on chicken as well!

DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used all the ingredients it called for.  I just had to add more of them when I realized that I had more meat than what the recipe called for.  I didn't think the heat of the chipotle chili powder was too bad.  My husband LOVED it!  Thank you for the delicious pork loin recipe!

Love it! Great flavor, perfectly balanced between spicy and sweet. Well for me at least, the other members of my family might disagree depending on who you ask. Half of them thought it was wayyy to spicy

This was amazing. Used exact recipe ingredients but did not have a grill pan so used cast iron skillet instead. Finished in the oven at 400 for about 15 minutes to make sure it was done completely . So yummy will definitely make again!

wonderful!!!!  I was concerned because of all the reviews stating it was way too spicy. This was not true in my case. I could not find chipotle chile powder, so I used Mexican chili powder.  I broiled it and the brown sugar did burn and the crust flaked off. Maybe that is why it wasn't real spicy.

Was looking for a good spicy sweet rub for our meats when we use our smoker. This is it! I have a large mason jar full of it premade in my spicy cupboard. Wonderful mixture! I've even used it in recipes, not just on meat.

Ok, usually I read many reviews first, but I saw a review for this recipe on another pork loin recipe review and just went for it. RED FLAG!! Three TABLESPOONS of chipotle is a lot!! I questioned it at the time, but went with it as we have a high tolerance for heat. As yummy as it is, cut the chipotle to 1-2 Tbls. For dinner, five of us did not finish a 1.25 lb. pork loin (with 2 teenagers.) Made for a fantastic sandwich the next day. As we have family members that are prohibited from eating pork, when they visit I will try this rub on chicken as well.

Oh. My. Wow.  SOOO good, this exceeded my already high expectations. I did cut the chipotle in half for personal preference and it was still blissfully hot and spicy. I baked mine since its currently snowing, but I will try this one again. And again. And again.

Great recipe, will make again! Made this with a 1.25 pound pork tenderloin. Used 5 Tablespoons of brown sugar, and only 2 Tablespoons of chipolte seasoning. Made it on the George Forman at 375 for 16 mins. Rice, gravy and green beans made it a huge hit!

I marinated the meat for about 2 hours. I think the longer the better. The seasoning really penetrated the pork. Really good straight off the grill. Great easy recipe.

Made this a liquid rub by adding 1 small can of pineapple juice and garlic.  I also cut down on the chipotle seasoning a little.

Was pretty good.  Chipotle seasoning is hard to find (here in the midwest), so I used Mrs. Dash chipotle seasoning.  Tenderloin was very tender, but was too hot.  That could have been just my personal preference, but kids wouldn't eat it.  Just FYI if you have children who are picky about things being too spicy...this recipe is not for you.

This was not to my liking. I enjoy chipotle and barbecue flavors, i'm an adventurous eater who likes every kind of food. But I followed the recipe exactly, and it was searingly hot and overly smoky tasting. If I were to try it again, I would use no more than 1tbl chipotle and maybe use some anchor chile also.
As it was, not one member of my family could stand to eat it, a total waste, and the first total loss dinner in my house in 6 months.

The base flavors are there, and I can see how it could be tweaked to be good.  I made it exactly as written, and it was so spicy, it was basically inedible, even though I usually don't have too many problems with spicy food.

This is amazing! Per many of the reviews, I only put 1T of the Chipotle Chile Powder in.  We like spicy stuff in our family, and it still had plenty of kick to it... It may have been too much with the full amount of CCP in it.  Kids ages 1.5, 5, 7 loved it.

This recipe is fantastic  - except that it is way toooo hot as written.  I like things hot and spicy, but this is way too much.  Cut down the amount of chipotle powder and it's great.  We use about 1tbs and it's perfect for our taste.

Fantastic! The hubby loves it with slight changes and doubling the recipe. I used dehydrated onion flakes (instead of onion powder) and instead of the chipotle chile powder, I used about 4 chopped chipotle peppers in adobe sauce plus 3 tbsp of the sauce itself....made it more of a thick marinade instead of the rub...!

Really delicious Sunday dinner! I was scared away from using the full amount of chipotle because of reviews of others, I should have followed the recipe--while the 1 1/2 T of chipotle added flavor and spice to the outside of the tenderloin, it would have been fine with all of it (per the recipe). I'll definitely make this again with all of the prescribed chipotle powder and update my review.

Best pork tenderloin I've ever had! My husband prepared a fairly thick 4 lb. boneless pork loin. He doubled the seasoning mix for the bigger cut of meat, and put equal parts of brown sugar to chipotle seasoning after I shared with him that some of the reviews said the mix was too spicy.  It was the perfect amount heat for my family of spicy food lovers!

This is the best pork tenderloin ever! It has now replaced my old recipe! I made this and reduced the chile powder to 1 1/2 tablespoons and it was not hot at all to me. I will be making it again but I will add the 3 tablespoons of chile powder. I was out of propane so I baked in the oven on a rack and turned once. It came out perfect!

Really good.  I make one from CUISINE that is chili powder, brown sugar and kosher salt.  This was a nice change with a ZING!  I used 1/2 the chipolte chili powder.

Great recipe! I could not find the chipotle powder so just used regular chili powder instead and it turned out really nice. I would suggest to make sure you spray the grill well with cooking spray and shake off some of the excess spice rub so it will not stick to the grill. The seasonings gave the pork a nice kick and the meat was nice and juicy.  Easy recipe to follow and definitely a crowd pleaser!

This was very good!  I used a pork loin and roasted it.  After reading all the reviews, I cut the Chipotle down to 1 TBS.  It probably could have used a little more so next time I will use 1 1/2TBS.  Today, I am using the left over with homemade BBQ sauce for pulled pork sandwiches.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed!  (also served with mashed sweet potatoes with a little butter, brown sugar and chipotle powder... YUMMMMY)

Easy & very flavorful. I did take others suggestion & reduce the chipotle chile powder. For a 1 1/2lb tenerloin I used 1 T chipotle powder. We cooked on an electric grill in the garage (lots of snow here) & it took longer than usual because of how cold it is now. Next time I'll compensate (if during the cold season), or just bake. Can't wait to make again. The garage smelled great even this morning from the cooked tenderloin.

This dish was awesome. I cooked this as part of our Christmas Eve dinner along with steaks and crab legs. I doubled the seasoning and fliped it every 10-15min since i had a large piece of tenderloin. My family ate all of it!! They cant wait for me to cook it again!!

Marinated overnite with 1 sm can of pineapple juice & garlic and onion salt.  Before roasting I drained the roast, put in 9 X 13 pan fat side up, and sprinkled seasoning salt and  pepper.  Roasted in oven until internal temp was 160.

This was excellent!!  Following others advice, I used 1TBS. chipotle chile powder and 1 TBS chile powder.  For some reason this is not very good as leftovers so try to cok only what you will eat.  Use a different marinade for the rest and cook separately.

This is so good!  AND, so easy, what made it even easier for me, I wrapped in foil with extra seasoning, placed in crock pot(no water) low setting and left alone overnight, it was perfect. Took y'alls advice and cut back on the chipoltle chile powder using the 1 tablespoon. Personal taste prefers more of the chile powder.Thank you for sharing!

This is a phenomenal rub. I used cayenne chili powder instead of chipotle and added only 2 Tbsps instead of the 3 listed and it was great! This goes perfectly with "Red Garlic Mashed Potatoes". The sweetness of the potatoes and this delicious pork recipe can't be beat.

I used 2 tablespoons chipotle chili poweder instead of 3 and it was quite hot, so unless you like fire hot, cut it down to your preferences.  That is the only thing I did different, oh wait, I did cook it on my indoor grill because it was pouring outside the night I decided to make this... turned out great.  Served it with some organic Quinoa, roasted cauliflower and topped with Cucumber-Mango Salsa from this site, to cut down the heat a little.  Great dinner!!!

I made this on the grill last week, and it was excellent.  Very tender and a little kick from the spices on the outside.  However, I let it refrigerate for about an hour.

Fantastic flavor, but too hot!!  My family loves spicy (heat) and I usually add more spice to recipes, so I'm thankful I cut it down to 2 tbl of chipotle chile powder, and even then it was almost too hot.  Next time I will only use 1 tbl.  We smoked a 1.32 lb pork loin in our smoker and included a pan of one bottle of beer (keeps the meat moist and adds flavor).  It was was wonderful!

Great recipe.  Followed directions exactly and will have to cut down on the chipotle chile powder next time to 1 tbs; too spicy for me!  Will try some of the other suggestions (marinating in pineapple juice) next time.  Also like the idea of making burritos with the leftovers.  Had potato salad and fresh sliced tomatoes as sides.  Very nice dinner.

This is an outstanding way to prepare pork tenderloin.  Maybe my tenderloins were a little large but I had to double the rub ingredients.

I made this last night - WOW, it was delicious! Based on other reviews I did use less spice, probably about 2/3 of what it called for.  I also didn't have Chipotle Chili powder so I used a mix of regular chili powder and chipotle chili pepper seasoning.  It's really quick and easy too, will definitely be making this again.

I had never prepared a pork tenderloin and was searching for receipes.  My husband and I love spicey and hot.  This receipe was the perfect choice.  Not too hot, but has a nice kick to it.  One of the best food choices I have ever made.  Great enough that I have prepared it 4 times in the past 2 months!!!

This was a reallly good spin on pork tenderloin.  The only problem I had was finding the chipotle chili seasoning.  I don't like searching more than one store for ingredients so I settled for McCormick's cowboy rub which the main ingredient is chili powder.  This was a perfect substitute and not too hot for my little ones.

We loved this. I cut the chipotle powder in half to appeal to my two toddlers (but my husband said he would have loved the full 3 TB). I cooked it on my indoor grill pan. We will definitely make this again.

The flavor of the rub smelled so amazing on the raw meat, but I was disappointed that it didn't taste as good as it smelled.  I'm not saying it was bad, just not as wonderful as I had hoped.  It did have a strong kick.  I definitely recommend the chipotle chili powder over regular chili powder.

Very delicious! The sweet/spicy rub was perfect. A lot of reviews said it was really spicy, so I cut the chipotle chile powder down to tablespoons and it was just spicy enough and I also cut the salt in half. I baked it in the oven (it's not really bbq season here yet) but I can't wait to try it out on the grill! Others said they subbed the chipotle chile powder for regular chile powder, but I wouldn't suggest doing that. In my opinion, it is the smokiness of the chipotle really makes this dish.

I have made this more times than I can count.  Anybody that has tried it absolutely loved it.  The only thing I do differently on occassion (not everytime) is I might throw in a little ground cumin.  Awesome recipe! Thanks for posting it!

Tasty and a different way to cook this meat.  I used a 5 lb center cut loin so doubled the ingredients.  Then baked til 160 degrees.  I will fix this again but will reduce chipotle by 1/3.  I think the leftover loin would be great for making enchiladas or other SW or Tex-Mex fare, or even Thai.

Sweet and spicy and very very good. I admit I left out the salt to lower the sodium, but otherwise followed the recipe. Will make this again.

Very tasty, I put this in the oven for 20-30 minutes until 160 degrees.  I sub'ed cayenne and chili powder as I didn't have any chipotle powder on hand.  Very forgiving recipe.  Very tender and juicy!

Based on other reviews, I only used 1 1/4 Tbsp chipotle powder and it was still plenty spicy.  I baked it in the oven at 350 for 40 min and added a slices of red onion around the pork.  Was quite moist and flavorful, but nothing to rave about.  Probably wouldn't make this again.

Literally the best Pork Tenderloin recipe I've ever come across.  I put in a wee bit more than the called for Chipotle Chili Powder.  Not the best idea...but it was still awesome.

Very tasty dish. I cooked it a few minutes on each side on my grill before I moved it to the top rack to roast.  I recommend cooking to 145-150 and rising for juicier pork.

This was very good, though I did have to alter the ingredients a little.  The recipe gets partial credit, and so does my grill-master husband! ;) I used minced onions instead of onion powder, added 1 tsp. of dried cilantro, but had to get creative for the chipotle component.  I used chili powder, cayenne, coarse ground black pepper, and a few dashes of liquid smoke.  The pork was tender, spicy, and so flavorful!

I loved this recipe.  We used pure chipotle powder and it had a kick, but it was very tasty.  We were looking for something simple to prepare when we had a guest from out of town come over.  This was perfect.  We served it with roasted potatoes, grilled asparagus, and a salad.  A great meal to entertain with!!

This is excellent! I mixed all of the ingredients in a ziploc then threw the tenderloins in the bag and threw it all in the frig overnight. Only had to grill it to complete my meal the next day. It was yummy! The leftovers are delish as well. Could use them on a salad ;)!

Very good! BUT you need to know what kind of chipotle chili powder your using! If its pure chipotle, this will be HOT! but if its chipotle "flavored" or blended chili powder, you'll be fine with the recommended amounts. Just try A bit on the tip of your tounge and if its fiercly hot, cut it back!  Oh also, try adding a tsp of thyme to this recipe to brighten it up! very very good!

This is AWESOME!!! I did not have Chipotle chili, so I used regular chili.  I didn’t have a grill either, so I used a broiler.  I broiled it for 15 minutes on one side, then turned it over and cooked it for another 8 min.  I had 2.95 lbs of meat.  I have to cook this for my next dinner party.  I’m happy I have the other half of the tenderloin still marinating.  It’s so good… I’ll eat it again tomorrow.  My husband ate his with Hot Peach Chutney.  A mango sauce would be good with this as well.

Delicious!  I used a Pampered Chef Chipotle seasoning --only 1 1/2 tablespoons.  Three would have been too much.  I also rubbed the rub on instead of shaking it on in a bag.  A quick, good meal!

This was amazing!  I used some oil and let the mixture marinate overnight.  I also grilled in on top of some foil so it wouldn't stick to the grill.

I liked this very much!!!!  My husband liked it as well.  I did not have any chipotle powder so I used a chopped up chipotle pepper in adobo sauce that I had left over from another recipe.  This recipe had a very good smoky, spicy, and sweet flavor.   It was simple and easy to prepare with a delicious result.

Very good recipe! Had just the right amount of heat for my family, but others who don't like things particularly hot might want to tone it down a bit. Will do this on my tenderloins again!

This is absolutly fantastic. I fixed this for the 4th of July and made 2 tenderloins, let marinate over night and there was not a piece left. It is spicy but not too spicy and you can always tone it down if you don't like the spice.)Everyone raved about how good it was. Thank you so much for this FABULOUS recipe.

I love this and have made it multiple times how.  I have made it both with and without the Chilie Powder.  So, if you need to omit the spicy/hot taste it is great without!!! It is so moist and tender.  This is a winner!

This was really tasty. I only had about 1lb pork tenderloin so I decreased everything by half excluding the chipotle chile powder. I used about 1/4 tsp because my young kidlets would hate me if I used the suggested amount.

Amazing flavor!  Tasted like my favorite barbecue chips, only hotter!  My husband's first foray into grilling a tenderloin...but it came out great.  This would be so fabulous on ribs...I can taste them now...Thanks for a great new grilling recipe!

Loved this recipe as I really enjoy spicy foods, did take the advice of others and cut down the chipotle powder and it was a good thing I did.  Boy it's hot, but delicious.  Didn't add any salt to it either as I didn't feel it needed any and I was right did not even notice it was missing.  Keeper!!!!

Good but very hot.  Next time I am going to cut the Chipotle pepper in half, so the entire family can enjoy it.

This was delicious with a salad and veggies or mash potatoes on a summer night. Feels light enough, but is a very hearty meal. Great flavor.

Per other reviewers, I cut the chipotle  down dramatically because we have young children and because I had the Chipotle Chili PEPPER and not the Chili POWDER.  Thanks to the reviewer who explained the difference!  Great flavors with the pork, even with the change.  Very moist and tender.  Cooked in grill pan for 20 min--tranferred to hot oven till it was cooked through.

UPDATE ***Just made this one again tonight and am re-rating it 5 stars!!  I did a half recipe again and this time used about 2 tsps of my chipotle chili, just awesome!  Still spicy, but could more detect the sweet along with it.  A definite keeper, and so easy!*** Holy cow was this hot!  Hubby and I both like spicy foods and I swear my mouth was on fire!!!  I cut this in half as I only had about 3/4 lb of pork.  Based on some other reviews about how hot this was, I used probably just under 1 tbsp of the chipotle chili powder (instead of 1 1/2 per half the recipe).  Didn't have onion powder and cut the salt down too as I didn't feel all that salt was necessary.  Never underestimate the heat of chipotle chili powder, wow!  Good, just very hot!  May try again using even less.  Nice balance of sweet with the brown sugar.

This recipe is off the charts great...one of the best I have found on allrecipes!  Following the suggestion of other reviewers I did cut back on the chipotle chili powder by half and it still turned out very spicy - something we love.  I rubbed the spices on the tenderloin 3 hours before I grilled it and wrapped it tightly in saran wrap.  20 minutes on the grill and 5 minutes to rest and it was PERFECT!

This was amazing! I used ancho chile powder as that was what I had on hand and this is my new favorite recipe! I loved the smoky chili taste infused with the sweetness of the brown sugar.

modified this quite a bit, and it came out amazing!
i marinated a tenderloin in mccormicks hickory bbq marinade (from a packet)for about 40min then coated it in this rub (decreased the chipotle a little) and then baked in the oven at 350 for about 45min. came out perfect!!

This recipe rocked!  I've even used this recipe as a base and instead of cooking the tenderloin on the grill I put it in the slow cooker on low all day with a little beef broth, shredded it and made some pork tacos.  OMG so good!

Mmmmmmmmmm!!  I used pork loin roast instead of tenderloin which chanaged the cooking time by about 15-20 minutes (more) but man was it awesome!  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.  Thanks!

This was super easy to prepare and I liked that it didn't require a long marination time. We cooked ours an additional 10 minutes to get it done like we liked it, it was too pink otherwise for us. Flavor was different and went great with our potato salad and grillin' beans but wow, very spicy!. I doubt we'll fix this again even with less chipotle as it just didn't make our favorites list. Thanks, it was fun trying something new! :)

This was REALLY good!  I used regular chili powder & only used 1 Tbsp, it was not spicy at all, just flavorful.  I'm going to pick up some chipolte chili powder & try it again sometime & will probably use more than 1 T to give it a little heat. 


WOW - I just made this for the second time with the chipolte chili powder & it was phenomenal!!!!  I used 2T and it was pretty spicy, but delicious!  I made it with Grilled Sweet Potatoes & Apples from this site and it was an excellent combination.

I took everyone's advice about how spicy it was and used 2 TBS regular chili powder and 1 TBS cumin. I don't have a grill so I cooked it inside and it was awesome! I thought it could use a little bit more salt though.

I would actually give it five stars with the modification of reducing the chipotle powder.  I used Penzey's ground red Chipotle powder (available online.  I start with 1/2 tsp. and taste the rub before coating the tenderloin and adjust to my liking or according to who it is being served to.  I also put the rub on the night before or in the morning before cooking in evening.

HOT HOT HOT!!  I suspect that all chipotle powders are not created equal as some reviewers said they used the full amount with a resulting nice flavour, while others said they used only a portion and ended up with a very spicy dish.  I'm glad I read these reviews!!  I used only 1 tbsp of the chipotle and it was just edible - still very spicy (and I love spicy food).  The flavour was very good, so next time I will use only 1 tsp.  Overall this is a very good recipe.  The meat was very juicy. Thanks for sharing!

I used pork chops and just 2 tablespoons chipotle powder, and while it was good, it was pretty spicy.  Even my girlfriend who puts tabasco sauce on everything thought it was hot. Next time I might use just 1.5 tablespoons if I use pork chops again.

Pretty good but not super good - I did center cut chops and they cooked up fast.  I marinated for a few hours.  I actually have another chop still in the fridge that I intend to make for hubby's lunch today.

I used chicken instead of pork for this recipe and it was great.  The combination of flavors was wonderful and the sugar adds the perfect crust without being crispy.  I love spicy food and added about 3 TBS of chipotle pepper, but I feel like this is more "to taste" rather than an exact amount.  I felt that 3 TBS gave it kick, but was not overpowering.  I cooked it in a skillet, but look forward to trying it on a grill.  I will definitely be making this again!

Great!  We love tenderloins on the grill.  Did the suggestion of marinating in pineapple juice and brown sugar for a few hours before rubbing.  I prefer to cook my pork to 150 degrees and let it rest (covered) for 5-10 min.  Also cut the chipotle to 1 1/2 Tbsp so as not to singe our lips off =)

Excellent! Like others, I used McCormick's Chipotle Chili Pepper in the rub. The pork disappeared in record time, and this is now on regular rotation in our monthly menu! The rub is also great sprinkled on burgers or on chicken.

This recipe turned out very tender for such a short tenderizing. I did have to cook it a bit longer because my pieces were thicker. I put the leftovers in a casserole dish with water, covered and baked the prok in the oven for 30 minutes. It was wonderful.

My husband doesn't even like pork and this has become one of our favorites. I cut back on the chipotle chili only because I read other reviews that said it was too much and I only like mild spice. Even with half, it is plenty spice. The "crust" makes the pork stay so moist.  I use a meat thermometer on the grill since tenderloins can be quite thick and I'm not too experienced with grill cooking. Low heat, slow cook - turn once, comes out wonderful!

Excellent and one of my favorites.  Has won exclaim at several parties.  I double the recipe as I like to have plenty of rub to cover two tenderloins. I also use dried chipotle flakes instead of powdered chipotle.  It's spicy but no one has told me they found it too spicy like some of the reviewers.

This recipe was good, but WOW was it spicy!!!  (And we like spicy food!)  I would make it again, but would use probably 1/3 or 1/4 of the chipotle.

My hubby gave this a perfect 10!  Very interesting flavors.  I managed, for once, to get this done just right on the barbeque.  The trick is to take it off when its a little pink inside and then let it sit for 5-10 minutes.  Excellent flavor.  Definitely a keeper - thanks for sharing!

Really tasty and juicy.  My only suggestion for those who don't like very spicy dishes (depending on what brand you use, it can be quite spicy) is to increase the brown sugar by about 1/2 tbsp and lessen the chipotle chile powder 1/2 to 1 tbsp - but it's great either way!

This was a good recipe. It was quick and easy.  It it didn't need to marinate like most tenderloin recipes and only had to cook on the grill for 40 minutes.  My family really enjoyed this recipe but it is pretty spicy-not for families who don't like a little burn.

I think this is a fabulous rub for pork!  So quick and easy for a last minute dinner with rice and asparagus!  I used any old pepper flakes.

I have a tenderloin recipe that I always use but this one will be added to my file.  I cut the Chiptole chili powder to 2 Tbs.  Still a little to hot for kids, will only use 1 Tbs. next time.  Otherwise really good.

We liked this, but I can't really fairly give it a 5 yet as I didn't have the chipotle chili powder. I only had regular chili powder and it was good but needed more kick. I will make it again but will find the real chipotle powder. I cooked it in the George Forman grill and used pork chops instead of tenderloin. They were very moist.

We made this recipe with butterfly cut pork chops and they came out great. I didnt think they were too spicy, but any spicier and it might have been to much. Even my Mom, who doesnt like hot stuff, liked these. So they arent too bad. But overall, I thought they were very good and plan on making them again.

This recipe turned out great,even my fussy kids gobbled it down!  The only substitution I made was using regular chile powder because I didn't have the chipotle kind.  It was still kind of spicy but so good!

After reading other reviews I did make adjustments.  I only made 1 tenderloin ( about 1# )
so pretty much went with the suggestions  for 3 servings except for the chipotle Chile pepper.  I used 1 Tbsp and found it to still be a strong ( medium heat ) .  I also did not use any salt.  I did marinated it  in pineapple juice for about 20 hours then put the rub on it and let that meld for about 30 minutes.   I baked it in a lightly greased dish at 350 degree oven until internal temp was 165 degrees.  Took about 35 - 40 minutes.   Served it with risotto.   Yum.  The next time I make it I would just decrease the chipotle pepper to 3/4 Tbsp.  
It was very juicy and flavorful.

Great easy to make recipe with basic pantry ingredients.   I didn’t have chipotle chili powder so substituted regular chili powder.   Pork grilled nicely and tasted wonderful.

I was hoping for a quick alternative to using a sauce made from chipotles in adobo sauce with orange juice for times when I didn't have a lot of time. This didn't have any real Chipotle flavor, or much flavor at all for that matter.

No joke - I use this rub on ribs and party guests rave. I hate it when people say that in reviews, but it really happens with this rub.

I use the listed amount on one rack of St. Louis ribs, wrap in plastic and foil, then marinated overnight. Then I unwrap and follow the basic pork ribs recipe from the Cook's Illustrated book 'The Best Recipe: Grilling and Barbecue': 2 1/2 hrs covered on indirect heat with briquettes, flipping every 30 min.

I am not a pit master, but the ribs turn out amazing. I've also used this rub on chicken legs for work lunch and pork loins. It is such a versatile yet simple recipe. Kudos to KRAMNODROG for posting it - THANK YOU!

great.....but I only used one heaping tablespoon of Chipotle Powder and it was still very hot.  so you really have to adapt the spice level.  made a sauce with the pan drippings by adding some chicken stock , white wine and honey to tone down the chipotle spice.  THIS IS A KEEPPER!!!!!

I followed the recipe and, I have to say, it was extremely spicy. I liked the heat/flavor but we were having guest with tender tongues.   We ended up shredding the tenderloin to mitigate the heat and, I worked some peanut butter into the shredded meat which further tamed the heat.  I called it "Thai Pulled Pork".  Our guests loved it-LOL, just showed you can punt your way around a potential problem.

Love this rub!  Didn't have chipotle power so I used regular chili powder, a little smokey paprika and a smoke salt rather then regular salt.  Put it on the BBQ and it created the most delicious crust on the pork.  Served it with chimichurri.  Out of this world.

I used this for some pre-sliced pork fillet, and it turned out great. I didn't have chipotle chili powder, so I used some chipotle sauce instead. Then I doubled the ingredients for the marinade sauce and coated each slice with it, as I stacked them inside a bowl to marinade them in the refrigerator for a half-hour. I used a lasagna dish to bake them in, spreading half of the marinade mix in the dish first, placing the slices of meat next, and then topping them with the other half of the mixture. Then I baked it in the oven at 350°F for 30 minutes. That gave it a good, cooked-in flavor and every bite was very tasty--mouth-watering delicious!

Agree with most folks here which is why I can't give it 5 stars. Three tbsp. of chipotle chili is way too hot. Just use one tbsp. and you'll be good to go while keeping some of that "kick." Kids love it with seasoned cubed potatoes and green beans.

I made it with 1/4 the Chipolte chili powder, and an diced up onion instead of onion powder & it was delicious!

amazing recipe, but I did read the reviews and make alterations. marinated pork chops in pineapple juice for 24 hours
increased onion and garlic powder to 1 1/2 tsp
decreased chili powder to 1 tbsp
increased brown sugar to 5 tbsp
mixed seasoning in bag and transferred pork chops from pineapple juice to seasoning an hour before cooking and put in fridge to sit for a bit.
baked at 325 until cooked fully.
turned out amazing. the sweet pineapple flavor inside and the spicy chipotle seasoning on the outside was just so yummy.

This was delicious, tender and juicy.  I did as one person recommended and marinated it in pineapple juice and brown sugar.  I ended up marinating it over night because our evening plans changed, but I suspect it only made it better.  This is one of my favorite pork recipes because I've found that sometimes tenderloins can get dry easily.  This did not.  It was exactly as stated and it is going into my "best" recipes file.

Agree with doing just 1 Tbs of chipotle and I would do 1 Tbs of smoked paprika with 5 Tbs of brown sugar.

Spices were ok. I made this as stated in the recipe. I actually like the heat, wasn’t too hot. I’m not sure what type of chipotle powder others are using to make it so hot, but the one I have is perfect heat for me. It’s a basic McCormack’s chipotle powder that you find in the spices. The lower review is because it’s not my favorite pork recipe and wish I would have just made my usual recipe. But I like to try new things. Unfortunately I don’t think I will make this again.

First, God bless Linda B. for explaining the difference between chili POWDER vs. ground chili! I was already on alert due to reviews but we love spicy, so I started w/ 1Tbsp of chipotle pepper from farmer’s mkt. Whew! It must have been just ground b/c it was HOT! But the mix was great, the odor while in oven was fabulous and we loved it. We’ll grill when weather is slightly better, but it was so good! Served w/ sugar snap peas and creamy potatoes. Didn’t make a sauce so used ranch dressing for cool moisture to dip. It was yummy! Thanks for recipe!

I sealed the meat on the grill, then placed it on the aluminum foil and placed it back on the grill at medium heat; flipped it every 5-7 mins while checking it until cook. The result... tender and juicy.

Just a quick warning... if you serve this to a couple people that don’t like it hot, plan on dialing it back a little bit.  This is amazing, but it has a lot of heat to it.

Surprised!!!  Always thought pork tenderloin needed to marinade. I was very sceptical especially after reading reviews. Husband doesn't like hot spicy food so I followed others and decreased chili powder to 1 Tbs.  PERFECT!!!!  This was really juicy,tasty and tender!!! Can't wait to make again!  Quick meal!  Grilled on indoor grill as instructed. Came out wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy. We seared it in hot skillet with some oil, then baked 425 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Delicious. BUT, BECAUSE OF THE SUGAR, THE SKILLET WAS A BEAR TO CLEAN. Would do it again using this method, even so.

Wow this is my new favorite way to make pork tenderloin. I cooked it under the broiler on high with the rack in the middle slot for the first 10 mins and then in the upper middle slot about 4 inches from the heat element for the last 10 minutes, turning 3 times total. The loins came out at 140-150F depending on where you poked it, so next time I'll cook them a minute or two less. Thank you to user Linda B for clarifying the difference between chipotle powder and pepper. I only had the pepper so I added cumin, oregano, and garlic powder like she suggested. I used 2 tbps of the pepper and it's nice and spicy. Delicious and so easy!

Oh YUM!  This will go into regular rotation for us!  I used a Trader Joe's small single pork tenderloin, cut the recipe in half, cut the chipotle to about 3/4 tablespoon and left everything else the same.  Do not overcook the pork!  It should be only about 140-145 when it's done and then let it sit for a few minutes before cutting it.  Delicious!

That chipotle chili powder is kickin! I only used 1 TEASPOON...and I’m from Louisiana! Balanced it out with regular chili powder. I’ve made it about 5 times this way! Done in 20 minutes on a gas grill maintained at 425*.

If you like spicy, you can still reduce the amount of Chipotle Chili Powder called for and still enjoy it.  I reduced it by a Tablespoon and my son still found it "too spicy" (he doesn't like spicy), but ate it several pieces anyway.  This is a great, simple dish to make for busy families.

Turned out amazing! The only things I added after trying the rub was: coriander, cumin, more chipotle and a bit of some mango sauce (empanada papa) it brightened it up before I got a kick from the heat. Will be making this again for my family!!!

Too much chipotle!   Cut it in half and use regular chili powder to soften the heat but still give a good crust.  I like heat but II don't like my mouth to continue to be "hot" 40 minutes after the meal!

It's very good, but I think next time I'll cut down on the chipotle a little. A bit too hot for a spice-wimp like me.

Smoked 2 tenderloins in a traeger grill for 45 mins. Otherwise made exactly as written (maybe slightly less chipotle/more sugar)- and this was amazing! Husband raved and kids who never eat even ate this.

Personally I loved it and so did our kids!    

Notes for the recipe: I think there is a typo in the size of the Port Tenderloins.  It should be 2 (3-4 pound), not 3/4 pound.

Yum! The results were so flavorful and delicious! It had a good spicy kick but not overpowering where it was unenjoyable. I doubled onion powder and garlic powder and kept everything else the same. Would definitely make again!

Awesome recipe. I read a few of the reviews before making this and did make some changes to the recipe. At first I used 1Tbs of chipotle and an extra pinch of everything else (awesome). Then I made it again with the exact amounts except for 2Tbs of chipotle. The second one turned out a lot better but beware it did have a bit of a bite, but not too much. I’d recommend 2 not 3.

I made it exactly.  The mashed yams were great with this.  I also grilled some pineapple and placed it under the yams for color and the combined tastes were great.

We loved it.  I made it as written and it was great. I loved the spicy sweet taste with a nice crust. The timing was also spot on it came out nice a juicy.  Perfect as is, but I might try it with the pineapple marinade that someone else mentioned for something different.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow! This was fantastic! Followed advice from others to marinate in pineapple juice. Baked in the oven at 325 until it reached 160 degrees. Took it out to rest for 10 minutes. It was so tender and moist. I loved the sweetness from the pineapple. Will definitely make again!

Love this recipe however three tablespoons of chipotle chili powder is way too spicy!   I did not grill the tenderloin however I did pan sear (briefly) and roasted in the Dutch oven. The meat was tender and delicious and the jus on top added the sweetness needed to cut the heat.  Also served with Parmesan risotto, that helped too. Yum!

If you marinade for 24 hours in pineapple juice, you can cut down on sugar by half.

Stuck to the recipe except instead of using chipotle powder, I used a jar of chilpotle cooking sauce during the last 10 minutes of grilling which gave it a awesome glaze and sweetness.

I made this in my crockpot and my family (esp. my husband) liked it. In the future I will try my oven/grill. Like many others I reduced the Chipotle to 1 tablespoon and that was the perfect amount for us. I like spicy things and it was plenty spicy enough, in my opinion anymore would have been too much.

As others have said, way too much chipotle. I love spicy food, but my family complained that it was way too spicy. For me, it wasn't too spicy, but it was too much chipotle flavor...it overwhelmed everything else. And I only used 1/2 of what the recipe called for. Next time I'll cut it down to 1/8 and supplement another 1/4 to 1/3 of some other chile powder (probably guajillo).

The pork itself, though, was tender and delicious. Just hard to tell with the overpowering chipotle flavor.

It came out phenomenally, after following reviewer recommendations. The chipotle would be overwhelming as written, so I’d suggest using 1-1.5 tbsp. After that, I followed Jill C’s method for braising in a cast iron pan, baking in the oven, and then making a sauce with the pan juices.

We will definitely have this again.  Next time, I will marinate it in pineapple juice as per many of the other reviews.  Even without the marinade, though, this was a great recipe.  I cut the chipotle based on those other reviews-- perhaps too much.  Still the flavor was great, and my wife, who does not do much heat at all, loved it.  The meat was moist.  Great recipe.

This is wonderful! I followed the advice of others and cut the chipotle to a third. It was spicy to me but not too hot. I admit I am a lightweight when it comes to spice. I also brined it for six hours in a salt brine with garlic and chipotle. I brine all pork and chicken for the flavor and moist meat, and it never fails. I grilled at 425 and turned every 5 min as recommended. Awesome easy recipe!! Thanks!

Yum. This was awesome!  Initially, I was a bit unsure of the spiciness factor, but I made it per the directions and paired it with steamed rice and broccoli slaw. The spiciness of the meat paired well with those simple sides. My grilling expertise is zero to none so, like others, I baked it in the oven at 325 until the internal temperature hit 160. My husband and I both loved it and are adding it to our meal rotation.

I made this recipe last night and the only change I made was using a chipotle rub seasoning Instead of a plain chipotle powder. My husband grilled it to perfection and it was amazing! It was the perfect combo of sweet and spicy.

Made this today, it is definitely spicy so adjust the chipotle to your taste, I had it with a chorizo and sweet potato hash and avocado lime crema which cooled it down nicely and added good acidity and sweetness to balance the heat.  Will make again and again adjusting until I reach the perfect heat-sweet balance.  Would recommend this recipe to anyone that likes pork and spicy food!

This was the best pork tenderloin I have ever had. WARNING: Following other reviewers' suggestions, I reduced the chipotle chili powder to 1 tablespoon and it still had plenty of kick to me. You would have to like VERY spicy food to use 3 tablespoons.  I didn't make any other changes and both my husband and I absolutely loved it!

Do  not use the full amount suggested for chipotle. I use 1tbsp so that you can actually eat it. If you use the full amount , it makes it way too hot!  And I love spicy food, this was too much.  It is a recipe that I will make again!

Delicious!  As others have said, it is a bit too spicy for some.  I thought it was great but I will cut back on the chipotle chili powder  depending on my guests!

I made the tenderloin as the recipe dictated. It was very good and the meat remained quite tender. My only issue is that the large amount of chipotle chile really made quite a kick. I like spicy but this was a bit too much (and it intensified when eaten cold the next day!) I will definitely make this again but will decrease the chile just a bit.

Excellent recipe I will make again, with even less than the 1 Tbsp chipotle some have suggested--a little too hot still! Great juice to pour over mashed potatoes. Cooked in the oven under a low setting broiler, rotating every 5-7 minutes. After 20+, min reduced oven to 325 to bake as the surface of the larger loin was getting charred, the smaller one was done. Thank you for a quick and delicious recipe!

I've made this more than a dozen times and is always a huge hit! Chipotle chili powder is way too hot so I always use regular chili powder. My family loves this with sweet potatoes to balance the spice of the meat.

Made the recipe exactly,  loved it!  will make again, will probably   reduce the chipotle pepper a bit.  We like spice and the sweet after taste of the brown sugar is outstanding.   Great combination.

Absolutely LOVE the flavors in the recipe.  I should have read more reviews and cut down on the Chipotle chile, because it was way to spicy for me.  
I made the spices the day before and let it sit in the fridge.  It turned into more of a sauce, but worked just as well.  Braised and then baked at 400 in my dutch oven.  Not a super crisp exterior, but but still very good.

I rated this recipe  with a 4 star, as I feel the chipotle chile powder is way too much.  I took fellow reviewers'  advise and reduce this amount to 1 tbsp., and kept true  to the rest of the ingredients.  That said the recipe is a definite keeper.

OMG it was way too spicy hot for me.  I had to eat yogurt alongside it, if I try it again I'll cut the chipotle in half or even less.

We love this recipe.  We can't find chipotle chili powder, so we use chipotle flakes, and cut it a bit.  The flavor is wonderful and we have come back to it several times.

I  never grill pork because it seems to become too tough, but this was GREAT (I only used one tablespoon of the pepper). The outside was crunchy from the sugar and the inside was juicy and delicious. Served it with a side of mashed sweet potatoes. My family asked to make it a recurring meal!

Super easy, super fast.! I am a busy working mom with 3 kids and with very little time to cook. This one was fast, I skipped the marinated time on the fridge but it still tasted delish! I am sure with at least 15 min on the fridge it will be tastier! Kids loved it, my 7 year old thought it was spicy when she smelled...but when she tasted, she loved it.! doing this again! ( I baked it on my pampered chef stoneware for 40 min covered, then an additional 10 min uncovered and BANG! ) super delicious. Just the right spiciness  sweetness needed! YUM YUM!

Simple and delicious! Pork came out  really juicy and tender with a nice subtle kick of chipotle spice. I did have to substitute the chipotle chili powder for 1/4 tsp chipotle chile pepper and 2 tbsp chili powder because that was what I had at home already. It was not too spicy, though I might add more chipotle chile pepper next time. After reading other reviews, I also marinated the pork in pineapple juice, garlic, and onion in the fridge for a couple hours . I placed the meat on a foil-lined glass baking pan and baked in the oven at 350 degrees until the meat reached 150 degrees (about 40 minutes). Would make again!

Made this tonight and will certainly be making it a lot more.  Only thing I changed was the Chipotle, since I didn't want it too spicy.  Put in half, and it was perfect!  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is a fabuLous recipe!  I've made it twice and doing again tonight.  Made exactly as recipe except I had some San Marcos chipotle peppers in adobo sauce so I rubbed a few TBSP of it on the meat also. Delicious, kicks it up a notch. So tender and moist. I cooked in oven for 20-30 min.  Would impress anyone! Thanks for this great recipe!

I enjoyed the rub, but turned it into more of a marinade by adding some rice wine vinegar and by using a Cholula Chipotle spice sauce. I let it sit for a half hour and then barbequed the loin. Tasty, simple recipe

Used 1T chili and just a little kosher salt. Leftovers dry out so I use it to make wraps....pork with red beans and rice (Zateran's) and any desired toppings...cheese, ranch, tomatoes, sautéed opinions no peppers....)

I read the recipe and reviewers' comments and decreased the to a  teaspoon for the chipotle spice and the regular chili powder each.  Served hot from the bbq, my husband still found it too spicy and so did our grandchildren .  (Leftovers served cold were fine.)  Overall, the meat was tender and tasty but I probably wouldn't make it for a family dinner again unless I substituted regular chili powder for the chipotle.

I made this exactly as described and my wife and I thought it was wonderful. Just enough spice and not too hot. I will definitely be making this again.
Thanks for sharing.

I am so glad I read the reviews before making this.  I cut the Chipotle Chili Powder from 3 T. to 1 T. and we felt it was still  a little spicy! But overall I would make it again, was so simple and quick.

I have made this twice now and made extra rib to keep in my cupboard so I could make it regularly. I did reduce the Chipotle and substitute chili powder as my daughter doesn't like spicy, and it still had great bite to it (too much for her but that meant extra for me)! I grill it on med-high heart until it's still a bit pink in the middle then remove from heat and cover it in foil for 10 min. So moist & tender! !

Delicious! As the  recipe is I give it a four star. It was  Way too hot for my husband and I. The taste was great but after the first couple bites I couldn't taste anything  because my mouth was on fire!  The next time I only put a fourth of the chipotle powder.  I also added about a teaspoon of paprika and ground mustard  and it was delicious!

This actually turns out really well. Very tasty, however 3 Tablespoons of Chipotle was too much for me. I'm thinking next time I'll only put in 1T (which is 3 teaspoons) and taste the blend before I add any more, and then only a *teaspoon* at a time to balance heat and flavor.

Great taste! Needed to tone down the spice for the kids. Used 1 1/2 tbl of chipolte chili powder. It was still too hot for them but perfect for me.

This is a pretty good recipe. I didnt have the chipotle chili powder so used a combo of ancho and regular. Pork turned out juicy and aside from the chili powder change up I did everything the recipe said. I only give it four stars because I would have liked to have tasted the sweet a bit more. Maybe supposed to use dark brown sugar instead of light? I did cook this on a griddle inside. Sadly, because of the sugar still stuck on after I shook excess off, my griddle is ruined and the kitchen filled with smoke. I highly recommend grilling outdoors as it says and make sure the crust is light and not caked on anywhere. Otherwise this is not a bad way to treat a tenderloin at all.

After making this and loving it - I multiplied this  recipe and put it into an empty spice jar so I can just sprinkle it on anytime I want to grill pork tenderloin!  Quick and easy to make and have on hand!

Really good!! The only thing I would do different is add less chili powder (half) only because too much gives me heartburn but other then that its delicious.

Made it for Easter Sunday dinner; everyone raved about it.  The flavor of the rub was spicy and tangy, but not over-powering.  Some reviewers found it to be too hot, but that is such a personal taste.  If served with an array of tasty sides, this recipe is restaurant quality and perfect for any guest get-together.  I served roasted red skin potatoes, asparagus with garlic, lemon and parmesan; spinach salad, and chunky applesauce.  For dessert, lemon squares and mango sorbet with chocolate wafer and coffee.  Table designed with large palm leaf and giant bird of paradise leaf, candles and tropical feel.  Used gold leafed charger under bamboo chargers with Nantucket Basket white plates, African animal etched wine glasses and red water goblets.  I love to plan a dinner and set the table.  I set table a week in advance, then I'm in the mood to clean the house and cook the meal.  P.S. always serve Proseco first and toast each guest, then no matter what you serve, it will always taste better.

because of the children, I split the tenderloin in half and for the kids half I substituted smoked paprika. didn't have Chipotle chili powder, but did have whole chipotles, so I ground up 4 (2 would have been enough) and worked perfectly. both halves were very good. Kids happy, wife happy, I'm happy. will make again.

Delicious!  I baked this at 450 degrees convention oven. Cooked to internal temperature of 150 and it turned out tender and delicious. Just the right amount of heat in the crust. Will try on grill next time. A great dry rub. I didn't change a thing.

Great combo of flavours but  I did follow other reviewers and reduced the chili powder to 2 teaspoons.  That was the perfect spice for us.  We will make this again often.

I cut the chipotle pepper to just 1 T, based on other reviewers' comments.  It was wonderful.
I also cooked it on a grill pan on the range and just cooked it 5 minutes on each side ( 20 minutes total) and let it sit.

I didn't have a roast, but I did have some baby back ribs. This was wonderful on the ribs, and just as wonderful on chicken thighs. I grill a lot and this is now my go to dry rub! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really nice rub for pork, no matter what cut you use. I used it with boneless ribs and they turned out very nice. I mostly followed the recipe but I used maybe 2 TBSP rather than 3 of an ancho chili powder. There was little to no heat but a very good flavor. My husband commented that he would've preferred less sugar but I liked the amount.  The meat also came out a bit burned due to the high sugar content so watch out for that. Next time I may also add a bit of orange zest to the rub for some added zing, or else just marinate the meat in some orange juice before the rub.

This was a great rub that made a nice tasting crust on the outside of the pork tenderloin while grilling.  The seasoning mixture was enough to coat a 2-3 lb. tenderloin.  The first day I grilled it just minutes after rubbing the mixture on the pork and served it thinly sliced as a main dish.  The second day I had another tenderloin and marinated it for 24 hours, and served it thinly sliced in a grilled pita with a tomato and cilantro lime sauce.  Really good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a nice easy rub that the husband and boys (2 & 4) liked. I only used 1 full tsp of chili powder as the kids can't handle spicy. I appreciated that it didn't require a long marinade time as I was short on time. Next time if I remember I'll marinade in pineapple juice as other recommended. I baked my 2- 1 lb each tenderloins for about 35 mins at 425. Easy and kid approved.

Super simple to make.  As others suggested, I cut the amount of chipotle pepper in half since my wife doesn't like super spicy food and it turned out perfect.  Not too much kick, but the unique natural smoky flavor of the chipotle still came through.  Made it again while wifey was out of town and used full amount of chipotle and it was even better (but I like spicy).  Either way, I highly recommend.

Great flavor but hot as hell! (and I cut the pepper in 1.5 tbsp.).  I have Chipotle Chili pepper (ground) and not Chipotle Chili powder.  I can't google any definitive answer on if there's a difference but this is the 2nd recipe that's just tooooo dang hot using Chipotle Chili pepper vs Chipotle Chili powder.  My Cajun BF loved the heat but I couldn't tolerate the exterior or the juices because of the heat as opposed to hoping for med smokey flavor.  I've had a can of "Chipotle Chili Powder" but cannot find it anymore.  I would use this recipe again...but severely decrease the chipotle and throw in some smoked paprika with it.

It was just ok, nice and tender. I cut the chipolti to 1 tablespoon and it was fairly spicy but not over powering. I marinated it in the pineapple juice as others suggested and left the spice on it a couple of hours. I just didn't think it had that much flavor.

I've made this a few times now. I use just regular chili powder and the flavor of the pork is just perfect for my family . It has a little kick but not to spicy.  I sear the pork onto the stove and then finish in the oven. Really easy!!

This is awesome and the spiciness is great if you like it hot. Have now made this many, mnay times as it is our go to pork tenderloin recipe.  Adjust the seasonings to your own taste. I often make it up ahead of time and freeze it for later use.

This was great!  I used one less tsp. of chili powder, as my boyfriend doesn't like spicy things.  Worked great, he loved it.  Next time I'd go a little lighter on the seasoning, not coat them so much.

Cut back on chipotle like other reviewers, but still too spicy. Love spicy food, but this was too much for me. Rub has potential, but maybe try 1-3 tsp instead of 1-3 Tbsp if you're worried about the level of spice.

The only thing I changed was using regular chili powder instead of chipotle chili powder because that was all I had in the cupboard.  And I used a little less than called for because of some other reviews saying it came out too spicy. This recipe was great. All 3 of my kids ate it, which is saying A LOT, because they are super picky. Rarely can I get all three of them to like and eat the same meal. Will definitely make this again.

i added a little honey to the recipe and a little oil and let it sit in the fridge for 6 hours.  Pan seared and roasted in the oven for 25-30 minutes at 400.

This was very good! I added two sliced onions to the pan (yes, I cooked in on the stove) after the pork was browned on both sides.  I added enough water, after the onions were soft, to make a sauce. The mashed sweet potatoes were a perfect accompaniment. I think the longer you cook it the better.

I made this recipe, minus the garlic salt, garlic powder and onion salt, because I had just cleaned out my pantry .  I added chopped garlic, salt and pepper and used Grill Mates Pork Rub.  Also, I grilled it in the house .  Crazy easy and very tasty. I'm making again when we have friends over.

I cooked mine a little differently (seasoned it, fried it for a few minutes to crust the outside, then baked it) but it came out amazing. This was my first time cooking and my boyfriend and I both loved it.

This is so delicious!  Pork tenderloin can be kind of bland usually, but not this one.  I like spicy food, and this pork has a nice kick to it!  I cooked it exactly like recipe says (have made it several times this way), and it turns out perfectly each time.  The brown sugar + chili powder is a great combo.

I found this to be very tasty; however, I read a lot of different reviews and made a few changes.  I rinsed and patted dry my tenderloins and then rubbed on the spices and put in the bag in the fridge for 2 hours.  I only used 1   1/2 tsp of the chipotle chili by McCormack.  For me, that was enough heat and was perfect.  It left your mouth with a bit of heat but was not overpowering.

This was delicious! Probably my favorite pork tenderloin recipe of all time. I made a few changes: 1) Only made one tenderloin, but used the amount of rub for two. 2) Used 3 teaspoons of chipotle (about 1/3 of the original amount and it was a little too spicy). Will use only 2 teaspoons per tenderloin next time. 3) Roasted it in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 450 until it reached 145 instead of grilling. I lined an ovenproof non-stick pan with foil, set the meat on it and put it in the oven. No turning every 5 minutes, no burning sugar, plus, you collect the super tasty juice in the foil, which you should definitely pour over the meat when you slice and serve.

Loved this recipe but would make it with regular pork chops next time - it was a little dry. I also didn't have chipotle powder so I mostly used chili powder with a little cayenne (2 2/3 tablespoon to 1/2 teaspoon respectively). Our gas ran out half-way through the cooking so we used the oven for the rest. The glaze was delicious. I might consider glazing the casserole dish with some white wine and making a sauce next time. Overall a great recipe.

I am really surprised by how many positive reviews there are for this recipe. I prepared it exactly as written, and it was ENTIRELY too spicy. I love spicy foods and can really handle some heat, but this was over the top. My husband could barely finish it.

So my mouth has cooled down enough to regain my train of thought. With that being said, this was amazing. I cut the Chipotle qty in half and it still was pretty  intense. Other then the heat, the flavour was amazing. I don't think I have ever  had pork tenderloin come off the grill that tasted that good. I will definitely make this again.

Very good. Wasn't too spicy, but had a nice kick to it. I didn't have Chipotle chili powder, or even chili powder, so I made my own. Still tasted great and was loved by all.

Nice flavor and moist. I looked at other reviews and decided to tone it down a little since my kids don't like things too spicy. I used chili powder and a little cayenne pepper. Everyone seemed happy and it was really good using tortillas with taco fixings.

Love this on the grill! I saw one of the reviewer's suggestion to use pineapple juice and that was a good idea. I cut back the chipolte powder a bit and used just enough pineapple juice to mix with the spices and cover the meat (maybe half a 6oz. can). My daughter said it was the best pork she ever had! This one's a keeper!

This was fabulous I did however cut the chipotle spice I used 2 tablespoon 3 would have been way too much for my liking. I didn't grill it, I seared it in my cast iron pan as others had mentioned then finished it off on the oven. I will definitely make this again!!

I have made this a couple of times now.  I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great.    We live in Texas so spice is never a problem and we love chipotle!  Great recipe - thank you!

Very good just need to dial down the chipotle pepper.  I like things hot but this was too much.  Timing of cooking was perfect.  I did marinate longer in fridge (4 hours) as well.

I made this for company and they loved it. I only used 1 TB. of chipotle as some suggested, and that ended up being the only criticism, a few said they would of liked it a little more spicier, go figure. So next time I'll make the recipes exactly as written. (I used Mrs. Dash® Southwest Chipotle Seasoning Blend) I think in this case its just a matter of how much heat you can handle.

I subbed regular chili powder for chipotle and used 3tsp instead of 3T. Cooked cubes of pork on a cookie sheet over a layer of onions and pineapple chunks at 425 for 30min. Served with fresh corn, green onions, cilantro, and the juice from the pork/pineapple. Next time I'll make corn muffins to go with it - and would love to try it on the grill if possible!

One of my favorite rubs. Let it marinate for at least two hours.

It is very spicy, which I like. It you don't then I would recommend cutting the chipotle powder down to at least 1 tbsp.

Used this rub on pork chops and it was very good. I did take the advice of others and cut the chili powder in half. Will definitely be adding this to my dinner rotation.

Loved this one.  I went light on the chili powder for mild spice.  Seared it in an iron skillet and cooked it in a 400 F oven for ~25 min.  It was very juice and tasty.  Easy and quick.

Fantastic! I too find that using the full amount of Chipotle was very powerful. I now make this with 1 TBS of chipotle chili powder and 2 TBS of regular chili powder. It's delicious!!

Great. Simple and easy to make. Moist and flavorful. I put a little cumin and left it marinating longer which although makes the sugar a little sticky comes out with a great crust.

I didn't change a thing about this except for the amount of Chipotle Chili Powder.  I used 4 tsps. rather than 3 tablespoons.  It was still fiery and I really love spicey foods.  Next time I will probably cut back to 3 tsps which equates to 1 tablespoon.  I also browned the pork (sliced into portions) in some coconut oil on all sides and baked in a hot oven (425).  It was done in about 15-20 minutes. It was yummy!

Finally!  I found a pork tenderloin recipe that didn't make my husband and children wrinkle their noses with displeasure.  When I went to prepare the spices, I discovered I didn't have chipotle chile powder so I improvised with canned chipotles instead.  I was a little scared of going too hot based on the reviews so only used 2 diced chiles and a lot of the adobo sauce.  It turned out great with a nice caramelized outer coating after being on the grill for about 25 minutes (I had the grill at medium-high which equated to 400ish degrees and cooked them to a fabulously tender medium doneness).  Next time I make this I will probably throw in a couple more chiles and may even puree them so more sticks to the pork and we get even more heat,  flavor and crust.  Maybe someday I will even try it with the chipotle chile powder as instructed.  Thanks for a great addition to our menu rotation!

Tried the rub with pork chops instead of a loin.  Ended up being WAY too spicy (and I like spicy foods!).  I think it was the combination of a larger surface area and the fact that our chipotle chili powder was pretty fresh from a local spice shop. Might try again with less heat.

This is a fantastic tasting rub and very easy to make. I threw it on the BBQ pit. However, it is extremely spicy even for me  (and I love spicy),  so you may want to cut back on the chipotle as other reviewers have noted. I will try 1 - 2 tablespoons next time. Super delicious!

Made this for a party we had and hesitated a bit as I'd not tried it but the ingredients didn't look bad so what the heck! Bottom line I had four of the girls ask me for the recipe - it was easy-peasy to make and very tasty.  One note however, it is a bit on the spicy side so with that said perhaps I'd lay off some of the chipotle seasoning just a tad.  You won't go wrong with it and again it is remarkably easy to make.

My husband and I loved this! I marinated the pork in pineapple juice for an hour because I had some and saw other reviewers recommend it. I also decreased the chipotle chili pepper (I couldn't find chipotle chili powder at the store) by a half a tablespoon.  This was absolutely delicious.  The spice was still a little OTT for us so I think we will decrease the chipotle to 1.5 tablespoons next time. But this was great and I loved the crust on this. We will definitely be making this again.

I used 1 tsp chipotle instead of 3 Tbs and it was perfect.  Also did add more onion and garlic powder.  Really good.  Had a 2 1/2 lb pork loin roast and cut it into 3rds.  They were tender but took a long time to cook through.  Next time I would cut them thinner.

We loved this!!! but then again both my husband and 17 year old son have been quoted saying that "ghost pepper is for wimps".......yes we like it HOT!!! I can see where it is too hot for some people. I used chipotle chile powedr.......not Chili powder, yes there is a difference! What I used was the hotter straight chile powder not the one that is mixed with other spices to cut the heat. that being said I love this rub and want to play with it to use on ribs and other meats. double the brown sugar, add smoked paprika, more onion and garlic, maybe some ground sage etc. This is great as it is but it also has inspired me to improve on it!

Good recipe, I need to make it again.  I didn't have chipotle seasoning and used chili powder to substitute and cut way back to 1 Tblsp. because so many people said it was too spicy.  I thought it lacked spice.  My kids are not spice lovers though so next time I'll try 2 Tblsp.  and hopefully get the chipotle seasoning.  My kids loved this thought and ate quite a bit - which is great!

Tonight was the second night we have made this and both times it was perfect by only using 1 tbsp of chipotle chili powder and increasing the brown sugar to 5 tbsp. I will use this again and again!

It was way too hot for me.  I have had other marinades and rubs that I like better and compliment the pork rather than over powering it.

This is very good. I do agree there is a little to much chipotle pepper. I will dial the chipotle back a little next time.

For those who said it was too hot and cut back on the chipotle powder to half or so, I wonder if you realize this is for TWO tenderloins, not one?

OMG!  So good.  First time I made it I only used half of the chili powder and it was too tame.  Last night used all of it and it was a bit too hot for my hubby but this is SO DELICIOUS and easy.  Definitely going into the rotation at our house.

It's now a month later.  I have served this several times at parties and every single time I have to send people home with the recipe.  This is our weekend 'go-to'!

Absolutely delicious. Made this for my wife and kids for something different and they all loved it. We had some leftover and ate it for lunch the next day- it tasted even better. Don't be worried by the amount of chile powder used. There is a mighty kick when when you first mix it together, but it mellows after sitting and more so after cooking. Also, this recipe is quite flexible. Feel free to add/subtract with little worry. A simple, quick dish that I highly recommend you try.

- Note - I used 5 tenderloins and still had enough of the rub without changing the recipe.

HOLY WOW BATMAN!!! First time ever cooking with Chipotle and we are HOOKED! I bought a tenderloin just to have a variety of meat in the house.. and I didn't know what the heck to do with it, so to ALLRECIPES I go! I find this, It's a complete experiment but what a HIT!! The fam can't handle the zip the way I can so the second time I made it I kicked it back to 2 1/2 TBS of Chipotle powder. It was fine. With the leftovers we sliced it up and made sandwiches out of it... This one is being put in the book forever!

OMG this was freakin amazing.  I did a couple of tenderloins on a camping trip last summer.  Everyone LOVED it and it was super easy!  This has become a camping standard!  Everyone asks me when I'm making the delicious pork.

This is a favorite in my house, but beware, the 3 tbs of chipotle powder is quite spicy.  Cut down to 2 for a medium-hot spice level.

Make it then freeze it then thaw it and all the crust stays on.  Make sure to use enough oil in the frying.

Great flavor.  The first time I made this, I ended up marinating it overnight and then grilled it.  I used about half the recipe, it turned out super.  The second time I had a pork sirloin, so I chunked it up and cooked it in my slow cooker.  Good both ways!

Tasted delicious! I used only 1 tbl of chili powder, which was perfect! I also baked it at 325 until it reached 160 degrees. Super tender and super flavorful.

I brined my tenderloin first then proceeded w/ dry rub - as others, reduced chipotle powder to 1 Tbsp - go for 1-1/2 Tbsp if you like spicy, and increased brown sugar to 6 Tbsp.  Grill on med-high, 5 min per side was perfect!

As written, it was way too spicy and I *LOVE* spicy and am most certainly not a spice wuss. I even decreased the chipotle chili powder by about 1/2 tablespoon but it was still nuclear. However, if you got past the heat, the flavor combos were quite good. I would recommend maybe 1 tablespoon of chipotle chili powder or 2 tablespoons of regular chili powder.

Maybe because I made it in the oven at 325 until internal temp was 170, instead of grilling, more of the spices stuck to the meat. But it was just too spicy.

Serve it with a baked sweet potato to help calm the heat. Great combo!

Even with 2T of Chipotle Chili power, I had to cut the crust off in order for the family to enjoy it.  It was good after that.

Yum. I didn't have chipotle chili powder so I rubbed the tenderloin with a little bit of adobe sauce from my chipotle peppers that I had used from a previous dish.  The flavor was great, but I think it was a mistake because it created a hard shell around the tenderloin.  Next time I will do it correctly. I loved the grilling, it was so much faster than the oven.

Amazingly tender and flavorful!  I listened to the reviews and marinaded it with pineapple juice as well.  I seared it for 5 minutes on each side and then put it in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes.  I will be making this recipe again and again!

This was the first pork tenderloin I have ever made and it turned out perfect! I only used 1.5 T of chipotle chili powder because mine seems to be on the spicier side. 20 minutes on the grill was the perfect amount of time. It was a big hit!

I made this rub only subbed the chipotle powder with 4 tsp of Cajun seasoning,  because I had it on hand and it was  fabulous! The tenderloin cooks so quickly it doesn't have time to burn. I did marinate the pork for several hours. Remember do not overlook the pork. It should be pink in the middle. It was so tender too. I've made it twice now.

I made this recipe with boneless, thinly cut pork chops.  Unless you like your food very hot, two tablespoons of the chipotle is enough. I would definitely make this again.

Made this today with no changes to the recipe and it is one of the best pork tenderloin recipes we've tried.  It is spicy so be prepared or cut back on the chipotle chili powder.  We loved it!

This is delicious as is.  I followed the recipe to the letter the first time and we loved it, but now I kick it up a notch by cutting a slit into the tenderloin first and stuffing it with some jalapenos that I sliced lengthwise, de-seeded, and roasted in the toaster oven (or on the grill) first.  Once roasted, the jalapenos lose a lot of their heat, but they add a little extra embedded flavor that we liked even more with the sweet chipotle seasoning.
I think that those complaining that the recipe is too hot are using the wrong type of chipotle seasoning.  I've served this to a number of people and no one's complained that it was too hot.  The original recipe has a sweet spicy flavor, but I would not classify it as hot.

1/21/2016: I have started to make this in the crock pot during the winter months and it's outstanding.  I usually put the rub on it and put it into the fridge for at least an hour, sometimes overnight.  Then drop it into the crock pot in the morning and let it cook all day on low.  Then shred it and serve it on slider buns. 
7/22/2013:This is a great recipe.  I've made it a couple of times, and use a little less of the chipotle than the recipe called for and it was just right.  I paired it with the apple cole slaw from All Recipes (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Apple-Cole-Slaw/Detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=apple%20cole%20slaw&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page) and it was the perfect combination.

This is delicious, I followed grilling direction to the letter and it turned out perfect, very juicy.  I only used 2 T of chipotle powder though and it just about burned my lips off :). Can't imagine how hot 3 T would be.  Really great recipe, thanks for sharing it.

This is an extremely spicy dish.  I cut the chipotle seasoning to 1 tablespoon and it was still to hot for our palates.

Oh so good!! I didn't have any garlic powder (how is that possible?) so I used garlic salt and a bit less of the regular salt. It grilled perfectly! The brown sugar charred some on the grill but even that was loaded with flavor. A big hit. My husband is already asking when we can have it again and I just made it tonight!

Yum!  Super easy and super delish!  HOT!!!  I marinated the pork (1.5 lbs) in fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice and garlic for about 6 hours, and then in the rub for about 3.  Used splenda brown sugar.  Cooked it in a 325 oven for about 40 mins.  picky husband who doesn't usually like pork loin was all over it.  I wouldn't back off on the chipotle but would think about very thin slices on the bias and then use in mexican dishes.  As I made it (not the original recipe, I know...) it was super hot.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I read the reviews after I rubbed the pork, opps.  Cut down on the chipotle powder.  It was WAY too hot.  I would have used 1 TBSP instead.  My husband and I love spice, and I was shocked I couldn't take it!  The flavors were great.  Will try this again with a few modifications.  Would taste great chopped into small pieces in omelet or burrito.

Pork tenderloin was on sale and I needed quick preparation since I'm a working mom also working on my master's degree. I really liked this for the speed and ease as well as an opportunity to break out the grill for the first time this season. We are really watching our sodium intake so used Mrs. Dash Chipotle seasoning blend. Loved this. The key to not having the sugar burn is the frequent turning on the grill just as recommended.

As per the other positive reviews for this recipe, I changed the amount to 1 tablespoon of regular chile powder, and only 3 Tbsp of brown sugar.  Excellent!

I am always looking for new recipes to change things up a bit..so I decided to try this.
It was fantastic!  I had to substitute ancho chile powder for the Chipotle powder since I did not have it.
I will definitely use this recipe again.

So yeah... Im one of the people that couldn't  find chipotle chile powder, so I just used 1 1/2 Tbl chile power. It was really good and was just the right sweet and spicy. Will make again. And I'll try harder to find the chipotle power for next time and I'm sure it will be even better!

This is the very first recipe I save to my recipe box way back in May of 2007. I've been wanting to try it forever and we finally did. I could not find the chipotle chili powder. I did find ground chipotle chili and chipotle seasoning. I decided to use the seasoning because I thought it wouldn't be as hot. While I like some spice, I didn't want it to be too hot. The seasoning came in a grinder bottle, so I ground about 2T and decided that was enough. My husband grilled it perfectly and it was delicious. We still have another tenderloin in the freezer and we will make this again. I'm sorry we waited so long.

Cant get any easier or tastier!  I made this recipe as is and served it with roasted sweet potatoes and pears. My friends and family thought it was fantastic.  Is it spicy -yes!- but the recipe is called "Chipotle Crusted" people! ;-)

I typically do not even eat pork that much, unless my fiance really wants to cook it.  The pork tenderloin in this recipe came out amazing! So moist and tender with just the right hint of spice! (We like spicy foods, so we added just a bit more of the chipotle seasoning!) Definitely try it out!

This was terrific! Plus, it was incredibly easy and fast to prepare after work.  I followed the recipe exactly and then squeezed fresh juice from an orange over the top before serving. It was sooooooooooo good and moist. My husband couldn't believe it was just a dry rub.

LOVED THIS!  I just purchased another pork tenderloin so I can make it again.  Followed the recipe exactly.  ...And this was the first time I had ever used the barbecue grill.  This recipe made me feel like a real chef.  Thank you Kramnodrog!

First time I have rated anything but felt this recipe was worthy; it is so simple and absolutely delicious! My husband and I both love it. We did cut the chipotle to 2 Tbsps as it was very hot.

This was definitely easy to make and sure makes an impact.  Like some of the others commented it is a little spicy so will only use 2 Tbl of the chipolte seasoning next time and believe me there will be a next time!!

I followed Crystal S's suggestions with the pineapple marinade, but reduced the chipotle powder to 1.5 tsp in the spice mix, which was perfect for us.

Hands down the BEST recipe I've found on Allrecipes! I tripled the recipe for a 5# boneless pork loin that I marinated in pineapple juice overnight. I have ground chipotle chile (with no added spices) so only used the 3 Tbsp. Cooked part of the loin with one cup of pineapple juice in the crockpot on low for 6 hours. Shredded and used for tacos. The other half I baked in the oven, using some pineapple juice in the baking dish. Sliced and served with brown rice.  YUM!! I will be making this dish over and over!!

OK I was really surprised how good this was!  I changed it a bit only because I didn't want to make an extra trip to the store so I had to work with the ingredients I had.  Instead of onion power I used an envelope of Lipton Onion Soup Mix... the whole thing.  I also used regular chile pepper as opposed to Chipotle Chile powder.  Overall very tasty... Definately will make it again!

This was delicious, didn't change a thing, except to sub out 1/2 of chile powder for regular since ours is very spicy. We may have overcooked the pork a bit because it would have been fabulous if there had been some kind of sauce so something to keep in mind for next time.

HUGE hit with two very picky men. It satisfies both their love of meat and the spicy kick. I did decrease the chipotle pepper just slightly, but this was an excellent recipe, and I was given the OK to make this one every few weeks. When grilling, I seared the outside, and then turned it down to low. Although it took a while, it locked in the moisture and kept it beautifully juicy.

Excellent! I had a tenderloin and didn't know what to do with it. Found this one on the iphone app. It didn't take long to prep. 15 min marinade time and on the grill. Delicious, spicy but not too hot. 
I changed the recipe a little. I substituted 1 of the Tbsp of chili powder with ground cayenne red pepper. Then my wife told me that was enough of that, maybe too much so I only used 2 Tbsp of chili powder and I used 5 Tbsp of brown sugar. A pinch extra onion and garlic powders. Then I basted the pork loins in molasses. 
It was absolutely delicious! This one is a keeper.

Very good!  Although 3 tbs of Chipotle was a little too much.  I used 1 and 1/2 tbs of it and it was just right.  I love the sweet taste with the spicy after taste.  All in all a great recipe.

Yum! Yum! Yum! This was wonderful. I did use the full amount of chipotle chile powder and was glad I did. We love spicy. The pork was tender and the leftovers are just as good. If you love spice do not shy away from using all of the chile powder! I am not a pork fan, but this rub turned me around.

This was a very tasty dish.  It was the first time I have used chipotle chili spice.  It was quite hot and I like hot.  I might use a 1 1/2 tbs of the spice next time.

We brined the pork before hand and this kept it nice and moist throughout the tenderloin. I will never do it without this first step. Thought the recipe was fantastic! Only difference was that we didn't have chipotle seasoning on hand so just used regular chile powder. Lots of leftovers since we cook for 2, but looking forward to my lunches this next week!

This recipe sounded delicious, but at written it was WAY too spicey.  I could hardly even stand near it to grill it, the chipotle chile powder was so intense.  Unfortunately, it was too spicey to serve to my guests.. I would like to try to make it again, but I will be cutting the chile powder way down.

This was fantastic! It's a great recipe to play with and make as sweet or spicy as you like. It's easy enough for any casual weekday dinner but yummy enough to make as good company food.

Cooked pork outside when it was 26 degrees (F).  Took 20 min at 350 degrees to cook to perfection.  Took advice of others and cut chipotle pepper to 1 1/2 tablespoons.  My wife loved it.

I loved this!  So quick and easy to throw together but it didn't taste like it.  Per other reviewers, I used less chipotle powder (about 1 1/2 TB) and let it chill out in the fridge longer.  Can't wait to make again!

I reduced Chipotle to 1 TBS after reading reviews! Thank goodness, I would have not enjoyed the extreme over seasoning! Very good this way.

My husband made this for a BBQ cook-off at work and I unfortunately didn't get to try it, but he said it was awesome and everyone loved it!  The only thing he said he'd change was to halve the chipotle seasoning because he said it was REALLY spicy (and we looove spice in this family).  Can't wait to try it myself!  A lot of reviews mentioned pineapple juice.  One reviewer said, "5+ stars! This is literally my go-to grill recipe. I marinate the pork tenderloin in pineapple juice for however long (at least an hour), then rub on the spices before putting on the grill. The pineapple juice makes it so tender. I buy my pineapple juice in little tiny cans, so I always have it and don't waste a huge container."  ALSO NOTE: "Chili powder of any variety is a blend of peppers, herbs (usually oregano), spices (usually cumin), salt, and garlic. Chili pepper is just that - dried ground up pepper. So if you don't have the chipotle chili POWDER, you definitely need to use a lot less and add some cumin, oregano and more garlic powder to get the right flavor and heat level."

Has great flavor, I love spicy so the amount of chipotle chile is good for me. For those of you who find it too spicy, if you add a mango-pineapple salsa it really brings out the flavor of the spice while at the same time cutting out some of the heat.

I loved this combination of sweet and spicy, and my boyfriend said it was fantastic as well. Will definitely be making again. As some recommended, I cut the chili powder down to 1 tbsp, as I am not a huge fan of spicy, but I think next time I will add a dash more. I only had onion and garlic salts, not powders, so I skipped the additional salt (pork tenderloins are usually pretty salty on their own anyway). Otherwise I stuck with the recipe as is and cooked it on the grill after brushing the loin with some olive oil. Definitely a keeper!

Followed directions exactly and this was way too hot. Half the chipotle would have been great. Will make it again with that change. I will use the leftover tenderloin in a soup today.

DELISH.  But, I misread.  I read 2 pork chops NOT tenderloins.  So I doubled the spices.  Muy Caliente.  SPICY it was.  Delish but a hot one.  Read clearer :)    Would definiately make again

Very tasty.... a little too spicy at 3T. of Chipotle, so I'd dial it back next time.  The other modifications we made were to substitute one small onion and 4-5 garlic cloves for the powders.  Process all of the ingredients in a mini food processor and coat the tenderloins with the paste in a plastic baggie.  Going to try the leftovers in Cubano sandwiches....

This was fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It's way too spicy for the kids so I'll probably cut down the chipolte down to 1 tablespoon, but I love heat and thought it was perfect.  This was my first time making pork tenderloin on the grill, and the instructions were easy and perfect for a juicy and tender cut.

Very, very tasty recipe.  The only thing I would change (after reading all of the other reviews) would be to reduce the amount of chipotle chile powder to 2 tablespoons.  Everyone that tried it loved it!!

Wow!  Was this ever tasty!  Really woke up the taste buds!  We don't have a grill right now, so I baked it in the oven on 350 until done.  Tender, spicy, and flavored through and through!  Will definitely make again.

The flavor could have been good but it was just so extremely spicy that we couldn't eat it!  I used Spice Islands Ground Chipotle Chile powder and reduced it to only 1 Tbsp and it was still screamin spicy.  I can't imagine what it would be if you used the 3 Tbsp as called for in the recipe!

This IS very tasty but it is pretty spicy.  For reference, my husband and I order our wings hot at Hooters and dip in 3 Mile Island sauce.  Next time I will reduce the chipotle chili powder.

My husband RAVED about this and he rarely comments about the dinners I make him.  My 3 year old who doesn't eat pork loved her "chicken". I made it with regular chili powder because they can't take  spicey and served with mashed yams. What a fantastic and EASY dinner!

All I can say is YUM!!!!! I used 1 tablespoons of cayenne pepper and 1 1/2 tablespoons of chili powder and it is right on the money. Very spicy! I have made a few times already. I used it as a rub and let the pork sit for a while and then baked it since we don't have a grill.

This dish turned out great.  It had a lot of great flavor for there being so few ingredients.  I did only use 1 T. of the chipotle powder, and it's a good thing I did because had it been any hotter we couldn't have eaten it.  I may even decrease it a bit more next time.  Thanks!

This is a good dry rub for pork.  I used ordinary chili powder because I couldn't find chipotle chili powder and it turned out great.  I served it with the side dish "beets & sweets" from this site.  It was perfect.

Very good! I put the pork on the grill wrapped in foil till the end, then I cooked it over the flames. I overcooked my pork, so it ended up being dry, but the flavor was delicious!  If it wasn't so dry, I was going to use it for pork tacos, and next time I will make sure I can do that.

I used this on turkey tenderloin, baked in the oven.  Excellent!  Even my very picky kids liked it!

This was very good. We really enjoyed it (and my hubby doesn't care for pork). We did cut down on the chile powder to 1Tbsp due to the kiddies. will make again...thanks!

Wow! Was this good! I didn't have chipotle powder so I used chili powder. I also sprinkled in some cayenne pepper because we love spice. The hot and sweet was a perfect combination! I let my meat marinate over night and it had great flavor! Oh! I didn't have onion powder either but it didn't matter for us! This is definately one of the tastiest tenderloin recipes I've tried! Thanks!

Far too spicy so will have to cut back to using 1 Tb. of the chipotle chile powder next time. Otherwise, quick, easy, and tasty!

Our family loves this recipe and everyone we cook it for raves over it. I use a little less chipotle in it.  I just a sprinkle some Mrs. Dash's chipotle in the bag and it turns out perfect everytime.  Great recipe and really easy!!

I was excited about trying this but leery of all the reviews regarding how spicy it is. I only used 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of  the Chipotle Chile Powder and it was still too much. And we like spicy food. It had good flavor (what we could taste through the heat) but it was just too spicy for us.

This is wonderful I how ever was in the mood for indian food so I substidutid the chipolte for Indian Chili powder and it was wonderful really hot but good.  Next time I do this if If I use the indian chili powder again which Iam sure I will I will reduce the amount used and possibly increase the amount of brown sugar to counter the spiciness of the indian spice.  I acctually cooked it on the grill outside and everyone loved it. The leftovers were good on top of a green salad served with blue cheese dressing

I cooked it for a few minutes more than the 20 minutes called for and it was uncooked in the center.  But we did enjoy it, it was very spicy and fairly juicey.

Good seasoned flavor!  I would marinate with the spices longer, most likely overnight to really get the flavors into the meat more.  Will repeat again.

I feel bad giving this recipe a bad review because so many others liked it.  My tenderloin was packed with heat (which we love), but had no taste.  My spices are good quality, so I think it's just a matter personal preference.  I love heat to my food, but I also like to taste the seasoning.

This recipe was delicious and easy.  I couldn't find the chili powder, so I ground a dried ancho chili in a coffee mill and added it to regular chili powder.  I had enough of the rub left to use with vegetables, so I mixed it with olive oil and tossed it with sliced sweet potatoes in a plastic bag to coat them and then grilled them.  My vegetarian wife appreciated that (but ate some of the tenderloin, too).

I followed the reciped exactly.  This was very tasty and tender and moist.  It was so good that we all ate so much that we were too full for dessert and in fact forgot desssert altogether.  I had a little trouble finding the chipotle chili powder, but did find one brand at the grocery store - a little pricey, but worth it.  It did have a little kick to it, but even my mother who doesn't like really spicy food really liked it.

This was my first attempt cooking pork. This recipe was very easy to follow and my husband raved about it. I think I will also reduce the chipotle next time as it was quite spicy. DH and I both agree that the same rub would be good to try with chicken breasts for a santa fe style salad.

SO EASY!  The chili I used was not very hot, so the chili powder you use will determine the heat.  My family loves HOT n spicy stuff, so I am looking for a good hot chili powder.  grilled on the foreman! DELISH

Great flavor, my family loved it.  However it was a bit too hot for me.  The chipotle chile powder must be hotter than regular chile powder.  So when I make this again, I will try using 1 tablespoon of chipotle chile powder and 2 tablespoons of regular.

Used about a 3 lb pork tenderloin.  Put it on the grill over indirect heat until it reached 140 degrees.  Pulled it off and placed tin foil over until it reached 150 degrees.  Family loved it.  It tasted great on sandwiches the next day.

I would have to say that this is one of the best pork recipes My family and I have ever tasted.  Everyone was raving about it.  EXCEPT it was so spicy.  I made it with the 3 tbsp chipotle chili powder and 8 tbsp brown sugar, but tonight I will definitely cut is back to 1 and keep the brown sugar the same.  I also added a handful of bread crumbs.

I have tried many grilled pork tenderloin recipes and this one is truly the BEST!  Juicy, tender, flavorful and so easy.  This one will be made over and over at our house!  Served with baked sweet potatoes and jicama salad.  Yum!

Wonderful!I cut down the amount of chipotle powder and to one teaspoon for 2 servings.  it was the perfect amount.  it had a nice kick, but my mouth wasn't on fire! I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I used only 1 tablespoon of the chipotle powder (otherwise followed it as written) and we all thought it was perfect.  My five year old even loved it. Thanks for a new summer grillin' recipe!

This pork loin was extremely good. We couldn't stop saying Mmmmm with each tender bite. I will be adding this to my recipe collection. As other's suggested I cut back on the chipotle chili powder. Other than that followed it to a T!

Very Good recipe, especially if you like spicy food - if not just use less of the chipotle and it will still turn out great!

This was just OK.  If I make it again, I will definitely cut down on the chipotle chili powder.  Also, I guess it was because I used an indoor grill pan, but I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer.

This was good; it didn't blow my mind though.  I marinated it in a mixture of pineapple juice and brown sugar for 2 hours (turning once), then baked in a 350 oven for an hour and 15 minutes.  Might be tastier on the grill, but it's only March!

This was just okay to me. Winter time, so I baked it. Mixed the spices (only used 1 TBSP of chili poweder on 2 lbs meat and that was enough!), and rubbed on meat. Wrapped in Saran wrap and put in fridge for about 3 hours. I don't know that I will be making this again. I didn't think it was spectacular.

Holy cow this was spicy!!!  And I love spicy, but this was too much.  Maybe I had too much rub for my size of tenderloin.  I am giving it 5 stars because the flavor was amazing.  I can't wait to try it again and lessen the spice.  Thanks so much!  Update - made this again tonight and used half the chipotle chili pepper and it was MUCH better...probably could have even added just a pinch more...I will get it right eventually!

Just ok.  It was very juicy.  My 3 year old wanted to seasoning cut off but my 1 year old loved it!  I used regular chilipowder and only 1/2 as much based on other reviews.

We love this recipe!!! Super easy and quick, yet one of our favs! We do tone down the chipotle a bit; we don't use the full amount. I also use garlic salt and onion salt and omit reg. salt. The pork looks beautiful with the bright red rub. Enjoy!

Really enjoyed this and will definitely make it again. After reading some other reviews, I adjusted the Chipotle seasoning - I cut it in half. Also added a bit of cumin. I let the rub sit on the pork for several hours before grilling, and the result was fantastic. My boyfriend said it was the "perfect balance between spicy and sweet."

My 14 yo said it was "OK" and then ate so much of it there wasn't enough to go around. He said he would prefer chicken !!! It was superb. I used twice the marinade, brushed the meat in oil and left it for 4 hours to try to soak the beautiful chipotle into the pork. I think the online recipe is likely best. Thanks for this 'hit'.

This recipe is awesome.  I've use this rub on ribs, tenderloin and even used the base to make a bbq dipping sauce.  Whenever we are going to do bbq now, I always get, "Make it like last time...it's so good, why change it?" Thank you for this recipe!

LOVED THIS!  I can not say enough good things about this!!!  I had never made a pork tenderloin before and was really surpised at how inexpensive this was to buy.  I served with corn on the cob and potatoes that I cooked in foil packets (butter & Mrs. Dash) on the grill.  A KEEPER FOR SURE!!!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Very easy and tasty recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. There was absolutely no heat to it, which I appreciated. It sounds like the heat level could have a lot to do with the brand of chipotle seasoning you use. Mine is made by Mesa Rose, which is available at a certain widely known health food chain with the initials WF. Rubbed the tenderloin down and immediately threw it on the rotisserie. Perfect!!

My husband and I made this dish last night.  We both enjoy spicy food but wow - this was over the top!  I followed the instructions for the amount of chipotle chili powder and it was WAY too spicy for us.  If you don't like "hot" dishes, I would still recommend the recipe, just cut down on the chili powder.  The pork was juicy and tender!

We tried this on pork chops.  I couldn't find the chipotle powder so I used hot Mexican chili powder and regular powder instead.  It was really good.  Next time I might add a little more brown sugar so that the sweetness is a little more prominent.

Did not follow the recipe to a T because I only had regular chili powder and no onion powder.  Cooked indoors on my "Griddler" and it came out FABULOUS!  Will definitely make again again.  Brother in law LOVED it and so did his 18 month old son!

I LOVED this recipe! I marinated the Pork for two hours if I can before I put it on the grill. I added some fresh garlic, cumin & extra chipolte spices. My boyfriend and I really enjoy spicy dishes and this wasn't as spicy as I would have thought. I served it with Grilled Asparagus and Squash. YUMMY!!!

AWESOME recipe!! I didn't have any chipotle so I used caynne pepper instead. It was hot and will cut down on the pepper a little next time but definitely a keeper!!! My son loved the meat but had to cut off the sides - he came back for more too! The meat came out soo tender and juicy! Can't wait to try it on chicken too!

Even though this had a wonderful flavor and the pork was sooo juicy, it was waaaay too hot for my family.  I will definitely make this again, but I will cut the chipotle chili powder down by at about half or more.

This was outstanding, but gave it only 4 stars because I majorly cut the Chipotle powder.  I used McCormicks Chipotle chile powder and used 1 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and chipotle pepper (easy to remember) with the 1/4 cup brown sugar.  It still had some kick without being overwhelming.

This was so good and juicy!  I didn't have the chipotle and used chilli powder instead, we loved it and will make it over and over again!

I loved how tender and juicy the tenderloin was, but I didn't care much for the sweet side of this rub.  I used Ms. Dash Southwest Chipolte seasoning w/ the Splenda/brown sugar blend, cutting the amount of sugar down to just 2T.  I grilled the tenderloin until brown on all sides and then finished cooking in a convection oven set at 350 until the internal temp reached 160 which left the meat at a "medium" cook.  My husband thought it was very good.

yummy!! I made with pork chops and pan fried them.  I did use only about 1 1/2 tbs. of the chipotle and it was the prefect blend of hot and sweet.  I served with a sweet potatoe.  I will make again.

I like it hot and this was just great! I used homemade chipotle peppers i smoked out of my garden this past summer. I used a 2lb tenderloin cut in 1/2 and 6 ground chipotles. I could barelt stop eating this stuff. One worf of caution though"If you don't like hot spicy stay away from this one" However If you DO like hot and spicy you have to try this.

So easy to make. Followed directions exactly as stated. Used Mrs. Dash's chipotle seasoning. Was very good... nice combination of spicy and sweet. My boyfriend loved it and couldn't stop talking about dinner.

Fantastic one of the best recipes I have ever tried I do agree the chipotle was to much for my taste I first cut in in half next time I made it I went down to one tablespoon that was perfect for me also If your on a low carb diet you can make it with splenda about 3 table spoons it taste just as good I baked mine in the oven .

Easy and quick. I used assorted pork loin chops... would have preferred thicker cuts, but the taste was still good. I upped the spices a bit to give the meat a more thorough coating, and rubbed it in before refrigerating.

The meal was quickly devoured with garlic mashed potatoes and corn... White Zinfandel makes a nice pairing :)

This was awesome!  This was my first time cooking pork tenderloin and apparently it's  really easy for it to dry out.  I had no problems whatsoever, it was nice and tender on the inside; crispy and crusty on the outside...perfection. 

I didn't have chipotle chili powder so I just used regular chili powder, cut down to a little over 1 tbsp like others had suggested, and it was still great.  I served it with grilled zucchini and grilled potatoes and my guests were very satisfied.
