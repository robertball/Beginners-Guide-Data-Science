They were really good, but they did not hold their shape at all. I had to roll and re-roll them in confectioners sugar until they maintained at least a little bit of their shape. Edit: Freezing/refrigerating them helped a lot. If you're serving at a party, freeze until right before the party and then put them out. Over the course of the evening they will begin to stick together, but at least in the beginning they will hold their shape. The one good thing about this recipe was that there was nothing in them that made them go bad. They lasted for several weeks after they were made (refrigerated).

The photo is a little misleading I have to say'!  How on earth could you get them to look like that?  They tasted delicious it's true, but the mixture would not hold much of a shape.  There's not really anything in them to "set" the balls.  Would maybe add some melted white chocolate next time to set them.

these are the best holiday cookies I ever tasted! Even better than my favorite Anise Cut-outs! Plus they are easy to make!
