I know. I know. I'm a bad reviewer but I just couldn't wait to use this recipe. I initially was going to use another recipe and bought Cabernet Sauvignon for $3.00. So rather than Port Wine, I used that instead. Also, I had only 3 1/2 cups of wine so I changed from 40 to 35 servings and used 1.75 oz of dry pectin. The color was beautiful and the taste was incredible. Next time (probably next year), I will use port because this tasted great and was fun to make with my daughter. Also, with my serving adjustment, I still made a total of 5 jelly jars.

I have made many kinds of wine jelly and using port is a wonderful full-flavored version. It is sweet - DO NOT cut back on the sugar as this is the chemistry between sugar and pectin that makes it jell. Try adding a little lemon juice instead. Strangely I have found that the cheaper the wine .... the nicer the jelly. When adding lemon juice substitue 1/2 cup for the wine.

Have made wine jelly for several years using different wines - found the white wines don't have nearly as much flavor - too fruity.  Merlot has always turned out good, but the port, by far, has the strongest flavor & liked by all.  I only use 3-1/2 cups of wine, and always use 1/4 cup lemon juice.  Have used fresh and bottled - never noticed a difference.  Have never had a batch fail.  Have taken it to gatherings and served on a pretty platter with small crackers around the bottom of a long-stemmed champagne glass filled with the jelly and a demitasse spoon for spreading - lots of comments!!!

Whoa! This is REALLY sweet--as in, next time I'm cutting the sugar down by a half cup at least!  But, despite the sugary-ness, so GOOD!  Definitely will make this again.

Mine also did not set up using port. I talked to a friend who is a master preserver  - she changed it to reduce the port to 3.25 cups and add 1/2 cup of lemon juice. Pectin requires a certain ratio of acid to sugar. Port doesn't have enough acid so adding the lemon juice should help it to set up better. If your using a white wine you can probably skip the lemon juice since white wine has more acid than port. 

Also, be prepared with more jars- the yield on this recipe is also incorrect - my port "sauce" following instructions exactly yielded 8 half pints

This was my first attempt at making jelly. I followed the recipe exactly with some inexpensive Fairbanks Port. It seems powdered fruit pectin packages only come in 1.75-oz sizes, though, so I just used one package. It was very easy to make, and it turned out perfectly! I tried some on crackers with a bit of "stinky cheese," and I loved the flavors together. This is a great, unique gift idea.

This was very good. I have made many jams and jelly but this was the first time I used wine! Very different flavor, but yummy! It has a sweetness that is different from the typical fruit jelly. I did not think it was too sweet as others have said. Maybe because I only use a thin layer? Anyways, very tasty! Thanks! Oh and I also halved the recipe and it came out well. I didnt bother canning it, as we were eating it right away.
