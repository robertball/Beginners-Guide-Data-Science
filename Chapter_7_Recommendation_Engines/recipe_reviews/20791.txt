My family ate this one right up!  Read it through, though -- she's got two pots going, and the second pot needs to be started before the first pot if they're going to finish together.  Which also brings me to the fact it's kind of a bummer that you have to dirty two pots and take up two burners.  It seems like it ought to be possible to do it all in one pot. For instance, if you precooked the wild rice for 20 minutes, then drained it and started the butter, white rice, onion, carrot, and raisins in the same pot, then added the wild rice back in with the broth, wouldn't that work?  You could increase the broth a bit to make up for a little more cooking for the wild rice.

I recently prepared this recipe for a church group of 98 people!  It scaled perfectly and everybody loved it!  I put it together the night before and put it in the refrigerator overnight to let the flavors blend.  I toasted the cashews and added them at the last minute so they wouldn't get soggy.

This rice dish is delicious...a wonderful combination of flavours and textures.It's like music for the mouth! The only thing I did differently was to toast the cashews before adding them to the rice.I will be making this again and again and again!

This is a really, really good dish...very tasty and versatile.  I think you could adapt it a number of ways.  I didn't have cashews or raisins on hand...so I used dried cranberries and toasted pecans, and omitted the pimento. Everyone loved it!

This dish was superb!  I made a few changes though: I used 1/2C Wild Rice/Long Grain Rice because I couldn't find just plain Wild Rice. I mixed it with 1/2C Uncle Ben's Extra Long Grain Rice, used 2 Cups of chicken broth.  I also cut down the amounts to 1/3 of all the vegetables as well, since there's only my husband and me.  I also followed another reader's advise and toasted the cashew's as well and this was an outstanding dish.  I made the sweet pork chops (on this site) with it and used the sauce from that over this rice dish.  My husband can't wait for me to make it again.  I still have leftovers of the rice!

I actually changed quite a bit of this recipe. I sauted the onion and some angel hair pasta, added vegetable broth, raisins, and rice, salt and some saffron. I toasted almonds, because I didn't have cashews or carrots. After the rice was done cooking I added frozen peas and toasted almonds. Yum, yum.

I agree with another comment, about using one pot. That's how I cook the wild rice pilaf.  I start cooking the wild rice 40 minutes earlier, because I find that it seems to take longer than even brown rice. But don't drain off the liquid (and all that flavor!). Add the other rice and liquid (even brown rice), and cook until done. Oh, I'd also use olive oil before margarine (healthier...). Other than that, loved the recipe!

Had some left over cooked brown rice, so I didn't use the long grain white rice or wild rice called for in this recipe or the broth. But added everything else to the rice & thought it was delicious!

Awesome! I didn't have cashews, but pepitas worked really well, and left out the pimentos and peas.

Delicious!  I have made this dish many times.  I served it at a ladies luncheon and had so many compliments.  For Christmas I used almonds and dried cranberries instead of cashews and raisins.  Easy and healthy.

This was really good! I left out the pimento peppers and substituted walnuts for the cashews. Also added cooked cubed chicken to make it a main dish. Yum!

LOVE this recipe for its color and texture.  Definitely a good choice when planning a fancy meal.  Raisins are not an option in our household, so we didn't add 'em.  Otherwise an excellent dish.  The only reason I reserved one star is that it's really tough to make this just right (texturally).  First, one has to find wild rice separate from long grain, which I eventually did, but it's expensive that way.  Easier to locate are myriads of rice mixtures which, of course, cook up part mushy & part crispy.  This will stay in my go-to recipes for dressed up meals, but for a staple I'll use this simply as a way to pretty up singular rice cooked per package directions.

Interesting dish with all the textures and flavors that really complement each other.  Very
pretty, too.  It makes a LOT.  Next time, I will
toast the cashews and sprinkle them on top so they will stay crunchy.

This is good. Not an "authentic" pilaf. More of an adapted type dish. Super healthy and really really delicious! I made it with brown basmati rice and it was fabulous.

Excellent, I don't make any changes except I use olive oil instead of butter.  The wild rice needs to cook a little longer than this recipe states.  I usually cook it an hour.  I've done this for Thanksgiving or just to have around for a side--this recipe makes a TON.  I love it!

Flavors went together surprisingly well.  I made some minor subs.  Regular raisins and canned peas because that's what I had on hand.  I gently folded the peas into the mix.  No cashews because I forgot.

**UPATE**
I've made this several times with minor subs and it's great.  I sometimes use roasted peanuts, pecans or chopped dates.  I prefer all white rice but the family doesn't mind the wild rice mix.  I do add chipotle powder for a kick.

Oh my gosh, this is absolutely amazing.  However, it took me a lot longer than 15 minutes to prepare it but well worth whatever time it takes.  My guests all raved about it.

This looks like a dish I received from a woman who was from Russia. Her's had a approx. 2 tsp. tsp. of ground fennel and approx. 1 tsp. of turmeric put in the pot with the rice and onions. It also had coarsely chopped red and yellow peppers placed on the top during the last five minutes of cooking. This recipe is still good like it is.

FANTASTIC!! Changed: brown rice instead of white (which meant increasing the liquid--3 c liquid to 1 1/2 c brown rice) which also meant the rice & wild rice had the same cooking time of 45 minutes, eliminated pimentos (never have been a big fan), used veg broth instead of chicken, tossed the carrots in w/the brown rice only for the last 15 minutes, seasoned with salt & Spike. YUM!!!

This is like a party in the mouth! So many wonderful flavors (all which can be adjusted to your liking) I served this with a blackened mahi mahi and asparagus and it was a huge hit! I left out the pimentos (didn't have any) other than that I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing! Unless of course to modify to suit specific entrees : )

I agree with those who think it's missing something. I thought, with all of these ingredients, it would be full of flavor but was surprised how bland it is.

Excellent recipe.  I made this for our churches new member dinner with one change.  I substituted Craisins for the golden raisins.  Not only was it flavorful, it made a beautiful fall dish.  One man couldn't get enough of it.  He was walking around with just a plate of rice eating it.  I served it with the Chicken Wellington from this site and it was a perfect side dish.  We will have this for Christmas this year.

Oh my!  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I made this as a side, but I ate all the leftovers as a main dish.  This makes alot but don't worry you will love it.  Great flavors and so colorful and pretty!  I used the pre-cut jullienne carrots and just chopped them a few more times.  Cooked the wild rice in the rice cooker (added 1/2 c more water and cooked for 60 minutes).  I only used 1Tbsp of margarine to make it a bit healthier.  Only added the cashews on top after plating.  This would be good with any dried fruit (cranberries, etc)  Next time I might add a little sage and dried cranberries for a "stuffing" flavor.  Great recipe that I will make again and again!

This tasted great! I liked the different textures and flavors that resulted from mixing the different types of rice, veggies, cashews and raisins. For some reason, I always have trouble making rice, so to make sure I the rice came out correctly for me, I made the the wild rice first in a rice cooker, then put the wild rice in the refrigerator and cooked the long grain rice in the rice cooker. I simmered the butter, onions, and carrots for fifteen minutes, then I combined all the ingredients in the end. The dish looked great....I should have taken a picture but I was too hungry to take time out to take a pic first.

Dish was really good, but the rice took forever to cook and the vegeatables got overcooked.  When I make this again I will cook the rice separately in my rice steamer.

This dish is very good and kid-friendly. Great for a picnic as is. Made it with the same ingredients as featured. It would be a help if the directions were edited to put the wild rice on first, then prep for the rest of the dish in the meantime.  If I were serving this with ethnic food, I may add curry, or cumin depending on the main dish.

This is a wonderfully versatile recipe! Make it often enough that I've been playing with ingredients. Favorite modification so far: Left out the carrots. Added a chopped jalapeno and 3 garlic cloves. Also added 1/2 tsp tumeric and 1/2 tsp cumin - and a can of mandarin oranges at the end. Also, toasting the cashews (as recommended in another review) is great. Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe!

I had less rise than I thought, and used about half rice half couscous.  Also, I only had whole raw almonds, so I chopped those up in place of cashews.  It tasted realy good and the sweetness of the raisins was a nice addition to a savory dish.

I meant to say it was good. More than Ok. The proportions are good. We added bite sized chicken meat that had been boiled in water, onions and celery It did lack flavor though. I think it could be flavored mediterranean, middle eastern, or asian. I am going to try adding basil and garlic next time.definitely a recipe with good textures and easy to make.

Tasty and easy. I took this to a potluck and people liked it.  My only change was that instead of the 3/4 cups uncooked wild rice, which I didn't have, I used a 6 oz box of Uncle Ben's long grain rice/wild rice mix. Cooked it in rice cooker with a little olive oil, water and a just sprinkle from the seasoning package it came with.  forgot to add the pimento peppers but still tasted good. I used low-sodium broth and omitted the 1 tsp. salt, and it was just fine without. Next time will try with the wild rice, but halving the recipe.

This was really good! We didn't have plain old wild rice at the store, so I used a mix of basamati and wild rice. I also left out the salt and pepper. To start, I melted the butter, added all of the rice, broth, 1 c of water and onion/carrots/raisins. I let it simmer for 25 minutes, then, after adding the rest of the ingredients I also threw in an extra cup of water. I put the cashews (toasted, as recommended) in at the last second and served it up! There is SO MUCH of this stuff - we will be eating it for awhile... not a problem :)

I am not a rice fan but I have to say this is some of the best rice I have ever had. It wasn't hard, the ingredients were easily obtainable and it made way moer than the 2 of us could eat in one setting(and I did cut the recipe way down) It will be something I will be proud to serve for guests and family alike.

A great starter point, and even in a mild way a good dish.  We like flavor so I added some salt, pepper, cumin and Curry (about 1 tsp each) as well as orange juice to the seasoning ingredients and some ham or bacon if we have it.  This is a good recipe for meat flexibility.

This was very good. I loved it. Great flavour. I did not add the peas and pimentos as I didn't have any. And I didn't add the salt as I felt the chicken broth was salty enough - glad I didn't as it was plenty salty!

This was very good.  I substituted olive oil for the margarine, roasted red peppers for the pimento peppers, and I added cumin and curry powder.  Based on other reviews, I toasted the nuts and started the wild rice first so everything would be finished at the same time.

It was very good. I found that the pea's really complimented the flavour of the sweet raisin's and the cashews. Definitely will make this again.

Didn't have the onion salt so omitted that. Perhaps a nice adjustment would be to add some some sesame seed oil/sauce :D

I LOVE this recipe.  For the the cashews, I substitute a combination of toasted pine nuts and slivered almonds.  For the raisins, I substitute a combination of golden raisins and dried cherries. This recipe is so good, I eat it as a meatless meal even though I am not a vegetarian.  It is also a very festive looking dish for the holidays.  Has lots of color and the different textures are just YUM!

Very good!  This recipe is great for vegetarians especially if you sub in brown rice for the white.  That way you get a complete protein all in one dish.  Our non-veg friends really enjoyed this as well.

This dish was good, colorful, and healthy.  I used brown rice instead of white, low-sodium broth, and omitted the salt and pimentos.  I also used dries cranberries instead of raisins.  I cut the recipe in half and it still made plenty.  It could use a little more flavor, maybe in the form of garlic.  I served this with salmon and steamed broccoli.

This is a great recipe and easily adjusted.  I use craisins instead of raisins and always get compliments on this dish.  Thank you

This was absolutely delicious, I am a major cashew fan and haven't had them this way, ever. I halved the recipe, and used a long grain/wild rice mixture (made by S & W) to cut down cooking time and dishes to wash. Package called for 2 c. broth:1 c. rice, which is what I used. I didn't add pimentos and I used brown raisins instead of golden. Even my 13 month old liked it (she had the peas, carrots and rice). Excellent side dish, one that I will be sharing with my family and friends. Thanks so much!!

This was a nice change of pace.  Not as kid friendly as basic rice, more of an adult dish, with its combination of flavors.  Overall, I enjoyed!

This side dish was wonderfully easy and delicious. The combination of crunchy cashews, sweet raisins and savory rice is a good one.  I left out the carrots (didn't have any) and didn't miss them.  This was very nice served with roasted chicken.

I used this recipe as a base and did lots of cheating to make it a breeze and so delicious.  I added sweet curry and cumin powders to the oil and sautéed my onion and raisins, then added frozen peas and carrots.  I used three packs of uncle bens microwaveable wild rice blend, microwaved two minutes, and added to the sauté.  Next in the cashews and some kosher salt.  This yeilded six good sized servings and was together in about ten minutes.  Delicious!  Thanks for the inspiration!

This recipe resulted in a delicious meal!  I used butter instead of margarine and added a chicken breast to the mix.  It is a good recipe for a family who is catering to vegetarian and/or gluten free diets.  The chicken breast option could be added for the carnivores in the group.

I used brown rice
Sunflower seeds instead of nuts (allergy issues) which I toasted
Sultanas instead of raisins (In NZ we have sultanas plumper than raisins and lighter)
I used frozen mixed veg and mix dried herbs
and omitted the pimento
We had it with corn on the cob and  Lemon Butter Chicken http://www.bhg.com/recipe/poultry/lemon-butter-chicken-breasts/ it worked well with the strong taste of the chicken.

I was looking for a handy recipes to use up some bits and bobs which I had in the kitchen and came across this recipe.  I modified it as I didn't have every ingredient but it turned out beautifully.  I didn't have wild rice or long grain rice but used basmati instead and I put in a heaped teaspoon of turmeric into the rice mixture as it was cooking.  I also put in a yellow  pepper (capsicum).  My girls loved it! And so did I. The second time I made it, I put prawns in as well - wasn't much of that left either :-D  A firm favourite in our house now.

This was just weird.  I'm surprised by all the great reviews. I found this to be rather bland and the flavors compete with one another as opposed to being cohesive, even after refrigerating overnight and reheating. I don't know. This just isn't for me. It looks pretty though!! Lol

My family loved it.  You definitely need to start the wild rice first then chop up your veggies and then start the long grain white rice part second--not the other way around as written.

Delicious! Sweet and rich flavor, with a wonderfully unique texture from crunchy cashews and raisins (if you like raisins at all, I would recommend doubling the amount!) My family gobbled it all up the first time I made it, and it's now a favorite family recipe!

Made this with the recipe for lamb chops with balsamic reduction and salad with the absolutely fabulous greek/house dressing from this website and all 3 were loved by all of my family including the children. It is rare to find something that is loved by everyone but this one did it. I left out the diced pimento peppers and it was still delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was different.  I felt so healthy eating it!  It tasted pretty good, but it wasn't something that we would want again.
