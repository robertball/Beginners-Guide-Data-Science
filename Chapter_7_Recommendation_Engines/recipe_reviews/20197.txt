This recipe is a favourite in our family for cold days and tradtionnal drunk on new years eve. 
One advice: use a stick of cinnamon, instead of groud cinnamon: it's easy to remove and the smell and taste is better. 
Instead of what one of the reviews says: don't use wine that is too cheap or young. It urnes into 'vinegar' easily.

Quite delicious. The wine was a lot stronger than I expected-went straight to my head! Great addition at Christmas.

Great for "2 buck chuck". Remove orange after 30 minutes or the wine will turn bitter.

It was very good!  Very tasty, and easy to make.  Each recipe does make about 8 servings, and my guests liked it too.

Yes, this would be very strong the way it is. I am going to make it today, but will put in 1/2 as much Apple Juice as wine.  (1 1/2 C ?)

I served this after going out with a group to an outdoor light display.  It was perfect to warm everyone up, and it has been requested again.  This will become a holiday classic.

While I do not agree that this makes 8 servings, I think it is a gret recipe! Perfect for winter and smells wonderful!

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit!  I did add 1/4 c. cherry flavored brandy for each bottle of wine used, used cinnamon stick instead of ground cinnamon, and put everything in the crockpot to on low for about 45 min. until the sugar was completely dissolved, then switched to the keep warm setting and served it right from the crockpot.  I quadrupled the recipe and ended up having to add more wine & brandy, as everyone LOVED this!  It was perfect for a chilly fall night.

Good as is, but I feel I made a few great additions.  I added about 3/4 of a cup of water and used a cinnamon stick instead of the ground cinnamon.  Also, the addition of 1/4 cup of brandy right before serving adds an additional kick!  Very yummy!

With this recipe I use a broken cinnamon stick, dried orange rind, and whole cloves.  I mix put them in a cheese cloth bag and let it sit and simmer with wine, cranberry juice, and apple cider.

This was great!  I substituted clemintines for the orange because that is what we had.  We wanted to make this after having it at a chicago german christmas festival and it didn't disappoint.

This is similar to the hot spiced wine we get when we go skying at Mont Tremblant, except this recipe is much sweeter.  At the hill it is served with cinnamon sticks and sugar on the side. Will make again but cut the sugar to 1/3 of a cup. As written it is way too sweet for our taste.

Very good.  I cut the sugar in half since I thought it was a little sweet.

Great, though a little too orangey for me. Big hit with the housemates though! I used a stick of cinnamon rather than ground.
