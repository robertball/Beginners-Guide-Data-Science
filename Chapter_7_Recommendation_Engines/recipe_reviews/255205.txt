1.27.17  I used a combination of frozen and fresh cherries, strawberries, and raspberries (didn’t measure, probably was a little more than 1 cup) for the mixed fruit and vanilla Greek yogurt. I like a thicker-textured smoothie and had some concerns about the lukewarm water thinning out the smoothie, so I added just enough tap water (wasn’t a cup) to reach the consistency that I like.  We all have personal preferences on how we like our smoothie consistency.  The orange juice really brightens the  flavor of this smoothie, and since I had oranges on hand, I used freshly-squeezed juice.  Love smoothies, and I’ll be making this one again with different fruit combos, it’s good.
