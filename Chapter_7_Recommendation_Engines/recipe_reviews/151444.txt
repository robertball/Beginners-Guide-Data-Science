Great idea! It really hits the spot. I used one smoked sausage link (cut the end off before shredding, and the casing will peel away as you shred it), and I added some sour cream after microwaving. Good snack!

These were super easy to make! And I never would have thought to try BBQ sauce on nachos but it was really yummy. My sister-in-law added sour cream and lime juice to it and I watched her lick the plate!

This is one of my favorite snacks. It is a weird combo but it really is good.

It's a million times better if you put them on a baking sheet and in the oven for about 10-15 minutes. I usually set the temp to about 375-400. And check on them after ten minutes. Yum, yum, yum.

I created my own recipe & it's always a hit. The meat is usually leftovers from the smoker or beer butt chicken, chopped or shredded & put on the chips. I also line pan w/ foil to cut clean-up. Next is drizzels of BBQ sauce, cheese, diced onion, jalapenos & other "nacho" items. Put in preheated oven 350-375 until cheese is melted. Put on platter, foil & all, & put spoonfulls of sour cream, guacamole, etc, around edges & let everyone dig in. Perfect with football game & cold beer!
