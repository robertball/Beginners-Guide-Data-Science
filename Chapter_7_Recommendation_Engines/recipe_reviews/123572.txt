This is 100% comfort food :)  Great for breakfast or dinner in my opinion.  I scramble the eggs separately and mx them in (I don't like runny eggs).  And I buy the frozen O'Brien potatoes that already have the chopped green peppers and onions.  For those saying the potatoes didn't brown, try not stirring them as much...I have found that if you just leave them alone (about 7 minutes on each side) they come out nice and browned.  Also, you need enough of the bacon grease to coat the entire bottom of the skillet, so adjust this amount depending on what size skillet you're using.  If you have a cast iron skillet, definitely use it for this recipe...it just adds extra "yum" somehow :)

Great recipe!  I've made this many times, using shredded hashbrowns, scrambling the eggs, and adding red peppers, mushrooms and sausage.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!

I have a huge skillet, but my hashbrowns just weren't cooking.  I ended up pulling out my griddle to finish the dish, which turned out pretty good.  The second time I made it I used my griddle from the start, which made it a lot easier in my opinion.  I cooked the bacon, left some grease on the griddle grilled the peppers and onions a bit, then threw on the hashbrowns and finished the dish off with everything else, excluding the eggs.

Great comfort food.  If you prepare this in a cast-iron skillet (recommended) be careful with how high the heat is.  The pan can burn your bacon quickly.  I was afraid the bottom of the potatoes was going to burn when I added the eggs and was waiting for them to set so I put the skillet in the oven to finish the eggs off and then added the bacon and cheese.  Shut the oven off and kept the pan in there until I was ready to serve.  This was a hit with my guests.  I did the eggs scrambled, like others have suggested.

I have made this for years. It was a Saturday morning staple at our house. I use sausage not bacon. For potatoes I use frozen potatoes O'Brien. Saves chopping the onions and peppers. The kids used to wrap it in a tortilla and eat it as a breakfast burrito. I found out recently that my son gets up on Saturday mornings and makes it for his family now. I guess its a family tradition.

This is so delicious!  I didn't have any hash browns, so I just shred some potatoes and added some seasoned salt.  Very good.

Great recipe platform! I used what I had in the veggie drawer, mushrooms, onions, garlic and cilantro. I also added some spoon fulls of salsa to the mixture and fresh ground black pepper. It turned out well, took about 15 mins to harden the eggs. Delicious!!!

We loved this breakfast.  With only two of us it was easy to adjust.  I don't like green peppers and left them out.  The morning I fixed this I didn't have any cheddar cheese so I used the mozzarella I had, then sprinkled with parmasian just before serving. We also don't like our eggs so well done so I only cooked them until the yellow was just set. MMMMM We will be having this again!

Very tasty but couldn't get my potatoes to brown. Followed the recipe exactly and they turned into mush. I will make it again but find another way to cook the potatoes.

We loved this simple, easy breakfast dish. Cubed hash browns would probably been a little bit better than the shredded ones that I had on hand, but it still worked out great.

I make this with extra meat like ham diced, bacon, sausage together, scramble the eggs, put on top and I make milk gravy top it off.
There is a place called Fatty Patty, this is where I had it at, Vancouver, Washington. 
My family just loved eating there.

I made this today and it was delicious. I didn't have green pepper so substituted green chilis instead. And I scrambled the eggs separately and added them right before the cheese. It got raves!

The husband RAVED about this.  He's trading in his trademark Jimmy Dean Breakfast Skillet for this yummy and easy breakfast dish.  Only change I made:  Extra bacon and cheese.

This is my all time favorite breakfast/brunch dish - it's like a Denny's Skillet. I've been making it for a couple years now - probably twice a month. I use chopped ham instead of bacon - less mess that way - and I use Southern style frozen hashbrowns and I omit the green pepper - personal preference. Delish!

I have made this for years, it is my husband's favorite breakfast! In fact, I just made it today. I use the potatoes o'brien with the onions and peppers already in it.  To make sure the eggs are cooked through, just leave the lid on the skillet for a few minutes until done. Yummy!!! :)

Another great time saver is to buy the hash browns that already have the peppers and onions in them.  Two less steps when you're in a hurry!

very good and will make it again.  we had it for supper and my family really liked it. I didn't have the hash browns, so shredded a few potatoes instead and  browned in the cast iron skillet.  Followed the rest of the recipe but no cheese in the house.  Bacon was mixed w/ the potatoes= an omission more than intentional.

Very delicious and very easy! I did make just 1 change: instead of using hash browns and cutting onions and peppers, I used potatoes O'Brien to cut down on prep time. So yummy! I think next time I make this, I'll add sausage!

Awesome recipe. I scramble my eggs, not a fan of runny yolks and it still turns out great. I top with crumbled bacon, green onions, sour cream and cheese! Like a breakfast loaded baked potato.

This was good. Instead of opening a whole pack of bacon, I just used bacon bits. I didn't have any bell pepper on hand, but i could tell it was missing and will definetly use it next time.

Easy and delicious too. I used precooked bacon strips, and what I thought was hash browns turned out to a bag of seasoned potato wedges. I used a frozen diced green pepper and onion blend. My potatoes took a bit longer to cook since they were thicker than a hash brown, but still this turned out fine. The eggs just didn't want to set to my liking on the top so I ended up flipping mine over so the top would get done too. I don't like jiggly white or runny yolk. For my over easy family though it was fine. Thanks this was a great all in one skillet meal.

I have made a version of this recipe.  Instead of chopping up green pepperss and onions, I get a bag of frozen hash browns that already have those items in them.  I use either ground up cooked sausage or crisp bacon and add to the hash browns.  After that is cooked, I whip  up 8 eggs and add them to the hash browns, stirring until the eggs are set.  Then I sprinkle my grated cheese on top.  Makes a great brunch or breakfast dish in very little time and very little fussing.

If you like sunny side up eggs, but have trouble flipping them without breaking them like me, this is the perfect recipe for you!  I love this one dish meal.  Instead of green peppers, I use a can of sliced button mushrooms.

This tasted good but mine was not as aesthetically pleasing as the one pictured. My potatoes were a little soggy and the eggs ended up scrambled.
