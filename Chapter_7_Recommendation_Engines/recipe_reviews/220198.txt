This is a nice, simple recipe, but the recommended cooking time of 20 minutes is at least twice as long as it needs. With a hot fire this shouldn't take any longer than five minutes. Asparagus should be cooked quickly to retain its sweetness and tenderness. Cooked too long and it becomes bitter and stringy.

Very tasty.  I had really thin spears of asparagus so they cooked in about ten minutes.  I used a grill topper so I wouldn't loose any spears to the BBQ.

This asparagus was delicious! I made a 1/2 recipe and got 2 servings, so the serving amount is right on. I used a good brand of ground parmesan cheese. I definitely recommend the fine ground after trying it. It just sticks better to foods. I ended up just using 3 good sized Tblsp of parmesan cheese for half the recipe or about 1/4 less and they were plenty coated. I also highly highly recommend using the larger asparagus, which many wholesale clubs sale, that are about 1/2" or larger. They stay slightly soft still after grilling and aren't so woody. I will definitely throw these on the grill again for a quick side dish. Thank you

Grilled Parmesan Asparagus Haiku: "The timing's too long. But this was still delicious. I'll do this again!" Had the grill fired up for Fathers' Day steak (for the Dad) and pork tenderloin (for me and the girlies) so I figured I'd try a grilled asparagus recipe. I really liked this, but wish I'd had a grill basket or the patience to thread the asparagus on skewers (as some reviews suggested to do) b/c flipping each one just didn't work out so well. Glad that I checked on the possible flipping at 10 min. b/c mine were done at that point anyways. Yumm-o!

Fast and easy to prepare.  All you need is asparagus as you most likely have all the other ingredients in the pantry.

Very good!  I added a touch of salt and felt it doesn't even need it, the parmesan does enough!  Also added some black pepper.  Very good :)

I should have read the reviews : ) The asparagus are so green on top so when I flipped them after 10 min you can imagine my surprise at seeing a lot of black.  I would halve the time overall next round.

This was delicious.  I was afraid the Parmesan would fall of into the fire, so I put the prepared spears into a BBQ basket.  I was so glad I did, b/c I was right!  The Parmesan that fell off into the basket was crispy and delicious, and we just added it to the spears.

Would recommend using a micro-plane to shred the Parmesan cheese so it doesn't clump and get messy on the grille.

Thanks  Heather_Banzhaf, Goodeats, and Jen,

Cheryl and I loved our dinner of Gilbert's Potatoes, Grilled Parmesan Asparagus and Best Grilled Pork Chops. I added garlic and shredded cheddar to the potatoes.  I grilled the asparagus for only ten minutes.  The pork chops were in the fabulous marinade for four hours.  As one of your suggested, I brushed the marinade on the  pork chops while grilling.   A huge success for this beginner.  Keep smiling, Jack

I made mine in the oven instead at 350 degrees with garlic salt instead of salt. Cooked for 15 mins, came out so good!

Very easy to prepare and great flavor.  I also really appreciate using the grill as much as possible in the summer to avoid heating up my house by using the stove.  I didn't use quite as much olive oil as the recipe stated - just enough of a drizzle to lightly coat the asparagus.

After using this recipe, I actually realized just how good asparagus can be. This recipe is perfect for great tasting asparagus. Since grilling it for the first time two weeks ago, we have used it 3 times so far.
