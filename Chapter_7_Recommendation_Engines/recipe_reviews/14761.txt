I have never come back to write a review the same night I make a recipe, but I had to -- this was INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!  Just used some suggestions from other reviews, 4 apples, doubled br. sugar, cinnamon & butter & last 10 mins. added a 1/4 more of sherry mixed with 2T. corn starch & perfecto!  I will make this again & again.  Thank you!

I did something slightly different with this recipe.  First, I put salt and pepper on the chops and browned them lightly in my cast iron skillet.  I removed them and sauteed my apples in some butter, adding in the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Once the sugar was melted, I put the chops back in the skillet and poured about half a cup of apple juice over it all, and placed the skillet in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes or so.  I added some cornstarch to the liquid about 10 minutes before it was done to thicken the sauce.  I added apple juice instead of sherry because I didn't have any and I'm also not too crazy about the flavor of wine or sherry in food.
My family really enjoyed it this way, even my picky 6 year old!

very very good comfort food.  Following advice I saw in several places, I did marinade the pork for 6 hours in 1 c apple juice, 2 T soy sauce.  I did brown the pork first, then cooked the apples in the frying pan I'd cooked the pork in.  I used the leftover marinade as part of the sauce--doubled the sauce too.  Then poured it all over the chops, cooked for about 45 minutes in the oven.  At the end I pulled out the pork and added corn starch mixed with sherry to the pan and cooked a little longer until it thickened.  I also made mashed potatoes and put the sauce over the potatoes.  It was fabulous.  Wonderful meal.  Thanks for sharing!

YUM!!!  I wasn't too sure about cooking pork chops this way, but they were great! 
I put everything in my crock pot and just let it cook  for about 5 hrs.  It was great.  We'll be making this one again

DELICIOUS!!  I made this last night doubling the sauce.  I used bone-in, 1” thick chops.  First I seasoned the chops with garlic salt and pepper, then browned the chops in an oven-proof skillet, added the apples on top (also threw in some dried cranberries), sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon, dotted with butter and poured the sherry over all.  Covered and baked for 25 minutes.  I removed my skillet from the oven, removed the chops and kept them warm, while I thickened the sauce on the cook top with 1 T. of cornstarch and a little water (which made my sauce plenty thick enough).  I plated the chops and spooned the sauce over top.  My only issue with this recipe is the cooking time of one hour!  Way too long, IMHO!  Perhaps that’s a personal preference, but even my 25 minutes was a bit too long!  Adjust the cooking time and you’ve got a winner!!!

I cooked the apples first with extra brown sugar, cinnamon and sherry and added a bit of nutmeg. When the apples were pretty soft, I put them in the bottom of the pan. Then seared the pork chops, added onto the apples and baked for an hour. But the flavors are so amazing. The whole entire pan was eaten. Even my 5 year old ate the chops AND the apples.

The sauce is too liquid, the taste is O.K. Needs a little salt.

I threw the brown sugar, cinnamon, butter and sherry in the cast iron skillet AFTER I browned the chops to grab those little bits in the bottom of the pan. The sauce seemed thin to me, so I threw in another quarter cup of brown sugar and a couple more healthy pats of butter. The end result was fantastic. Next time, I'd use another apple or two because we were fighting over the apples that were left and there weren't any to go in the foil with the last remaining pork chop and I'd also double the cinnamon.

I give this a 5 star.  It's a family favorite.  I make mine with apple pie filling and I top the dish with stuffing.  It's simple to make and delicious.  There is never any leftovers!

This was great! My husband hates apple pie so I thought this might be too much for him. He LOVED it!! I used only four 1/2 in chops and kept recipe the same -  except cook time was only 35-40 min. I wanted to try out an oven bag I bought, (no mess), and it worked unbelievably well with this! I put chops on bottom as another reviewer suggested and added cornstarch to sherry. Excellent!! I knew I would like it but for my husband, (a cooked apple hater), this recipe is a raving success! Thanks!

EZ prep and makeahead dish! Wonderful Fall recipe...a keeper and sure to be a new tradition!  Changes I made: 1) boneless pork chops 2) doubled fruit: fuji apples and asian pears 3) added generous handful of dried cranberries. Note: did NOT double the butter as plenty of liquid from sherry and fruit is produced.  Served with wild rice.

These are so, so good - easy to prepare, do their own thing in the oven - and taste amazing. I used windfall apples from my garden, which made it taste all the sweeter! Well worth trying.

Made this last night and YUM!!  Didn't have pork chops, so I used pork steak instead.  All I had was fuji apples and I didn't bother to peel them.  Definitely use the previous advice of removing the pork chops when done, putting the sauce in a pot, and boil with a little cornstarch to thicken.  It also intensified the apple flavor.

**Instead of cooking sherry, I keep the small single-serving size bottles of Sutter Home wine.  You can get them in the 4-pack at any grocery store.  That way I don't have to pop open a large bottle for a small amount and risk it going to waste because I don't use it very often.  I always have a pack of white and red on hand.  :-)

This recipe makes very tasty pork chops.  I made it last night and was very happy with how it came out.  I only made three pork chops but kept the recipe for the sauce the same and came out with a good amount of sauce.  So I think if someone was making six pork chops they would have to near double the sauce.  I highly recommend using Granny Smith apples - I have found those are the best apples to cook with.  Just a couple of modifications after reading reviews: (1) I did marinate the pork for two hours in a cup of apple juice and two tablespoons of reduced sodium soy sauce; (2) I reduced the sugar just a a touch maybe to about three tablespoons; (3) I peppered and salted the pork chops prior to browning them and I'm glad I did - I recommend doing that; (4) I put the pork chops on the bottom of the baking dish.  I also recommend that you check the pork chops every fifteen minutes to push the apple slices that are getting brown to the bottom of the dish to keep them from burning.  Delicious delicious flavor!

I made this in the slow cooker and served over egg noodles YUMMY!!
I browned the chops on high, mixed all other ingredients and layered it in the cooker. Chop-apple mix-chop-apple mix etc. I also added 1 c beef stock and omitted the butter. Added a little cornstarch mixed with water at the end and had a BEAUTIFUL gravy. Its a little more mushy in the slow cooker but it was so DELICIOUS!! Just dont mix it at all and the chops will stay together.

made this for dinner tonight. followed the recipe almost to a T. only changed a few VERY minor things. salted the chops before browning them, then deglazed the pan with the sherry before adding it to the pan to go into the oven. covered and baked for about 45 minutes because my chops are thin, didnt want them to dry out. thickened the sauce with cornstarch and poured it over. it was SO freaking good.

This is a great dish however; be sure to use thicker pork chops or cook a little less time if thinner chops are used or the meat will be dry.

A delicious combination of flavors. Did it a bit differently, without changing the concept or flavors. Had a pork tenderloin (1.3#). Cut it in half crosswise and browned the two halves in butter in a big cast-iron skillet. Added the apples (used 3 medium Grannies) and also added about 12 ounces of chunked butternut squash which needed to be used. Added 1 tsp cinnamon and the 1/4c of sugar, but also added about 1 tsp ground ginger. Poured the sherry over and covered fairly loosely with foil. Roasted it about 30 minutes until the temp in the pork was 160. Served over jasmine rice. Wonderful combination of flavors, and easy to do. DH loved it. And the house smelled SO good! Thanks!

Great Recipe- YUM- thanks!

I followed the recipe, then when adding the sherry, also added an equal amount of apple cider and a small splash of real maple syrup. I served with a little orzo with the sauce and a sweet potatoe in the oven. There were no leftover and my husband rated it "Make it again soon!"

Missing that WOW factor I was expecting! More a 3 1/2 star dish!I suggest salt and peppering the chops then searing them over high heat. This allows the flavor to be sealed. I used Granny Smith apples which were way too tart for this dish. My pork chops were very dry, an hour was too long. My apples were mushy and there was too much liquid!

Absolutely delish!  I browned the chops, removed them, then quick-sauteed a thin-sliced large white onion in addition to the apples in the same pan.  Added the cinnamon and just a little sugar, then sherry.  I put the chops on top and baked 350 for an hour.  OMG everyone loved it, even the kids.

Absolutely Delicious! and sooo easy... Just a few adjustments per the reviews and it's a keeper: (1)Add a mixture of 1/4 cup sherry and 2T cornstarch during the last 10 mins ( remove the chops to a warm plate and stir into the apple mixture) and then (2) don't cook quite as long - 35 mins is plenty. I used 4 boneless chops, 2 granny smith apples (nice and tart with the sweet brown sugar) and kept the recipe from there on. I might try it in the future by cooking the sauce in a skillet then preparing the chops separately to maintain the seared crust on the chops. Other than than - kudos for this one!!

My husband, son and I loved this!!!  I put all the ingredients in the crock pot, but used a pork roast instead of pork chops and it was WONDERFUL!  Nothing left!  I served it over rice that I had added some cinnamon, crushed red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, garlic and just a dash of nutmeg.  Couldnt ask for a better recipe!

I am giving this 4 stars because it had really good flavor. However, I tried making the sauce into gravy like one of the review suggested, but there was not enough liquid and it didn't taste right. I thought the best compliment to this dish would be stuffing. Perhaps next time I will add a little broth and some stuffing and make a casserole out of it.

This one is a KEEPER!  I agree with those who said to add cornstarch to the sherry to thicken up the liquid to yield more of a sauce.  I will make this again, maybe using chicken.

I didn't have any sherry but I had some red wine.  Turned out to be really good anyway.  Great flavor in the chops.  Will have to buy a bottle of sherry for the next and there will be a next time. Nancy

This was truly a great dish! I didn't have any sherry so I used apple cider and mixed garlic powder in it. I had garlic potatoes on the side, tomato slices, it was all a great fall meal!

I made this using thick boneless pork chops that I soaked in a brine for an hour or two beforehand...I seasoned the brine with some of the same flavors as this dish (brown sugar, apples, cinnamon, also some smashed garlic cloves, a bit of thyme).  Then followed this recipe...and I had two family members say they were the best pork chops they have ever had.  I did also sprinkle some thyme on with the salt and pepper (I had some fresh thyme that day, can you tell?).  Out of this world!

This had a wonderful aroma as it was cooking.  I would have rated it 5 stars, except the pork was overdone after an hour.  I used nice thick chops, almost an inch thick, and they were dry.  There was lots of liquid in the pan, and I covered the pan as directed.  The apples had a great flavor and we liked it well enough to do again, so I will test the temperature after 30 minutes.  New guidelines for internal temperature for pork are 145.

This made the most delicious and moist pork chops I have ever had! I didnt use sherry but used chicken broth instead and I salt and peppered the chops before I seared them! I will make this recipe many many more times:) Loved it!!

followed recipe to a tee--but the temp inside pork never reached 160 (125...), so we stuck it back in, and it still didn't get that hot, but was clearly cooked through. Ended up being rather dry...BUT, eating a bite of apple with each bite of pork made up for that issue easily. Quite tasty! Will do it again, following marinating advice from previous reviewers. We served with grilled Vidalia onions, BTW, and that was a nice combination with a cold beer.

This is quite possibly one of the best things I have ever made off of this site, and I have made quite a few things! I like to buy pork chops when they are cheap, hubby loves them, me not so much, so finding new ways to cook them is something I am always looking to do. I made exactly as instructed except I added some cornstarch mixed with apple cider to the liquid at the end, and also, only cooked for about a half hour or so. The pork was perfect and tender and the apples were so good they could be a dessert. Such a yummy meal. Thank you so much for the recipe.

I've made this twice now, and it was wonderful both times. Looks very pretty served over cooked spinach which you can mix with the sauce and it will taste delicious! Garnish with the extra apples from the bottom of the pan, and leave the sauce runny so that the pretty browned chops keep looking clean.

The pork chops were very dry, so an hour was too long. And the  apples were very mushy - there was too much liquid!  As I took it out of the oven I considered pouring off the extra liquid, then decided to move the pork and "apple stew" into a bowl with and served it with ladle.  Not exactly what I had in mind, and unfortunately I did not read the reviews which would have helped with this problem a lot.

Awesome! Besides adding a little extra sherry towards the end w/cornstarch, I might have been a little stingy w/the brn sugar since i was eyeballing it, but that's ok since i was hoping for an even balance w/sweet & savory...This was a kick(ur taste)buds concept/recipe! Thanks for a great idea!

These were very good!  I didn't have any sherry so I used red wine instead, but otherwise I changed nothing.
I think next time I want to try them with sherry and do them in the slow cooker like some of the other reviewers have done.  
It is a very good recipe as written!!

THis was fantastic, such great flavors that rolled right into each other. I used a can of apple filling and then cut up another three apples into slices. It says salt and pepper to taste but I think just a hint of salt is all you need otherwise it conflicts with the apple. I make these again and again.

When I saw this I thought.....here's yet another pork chops with apples recipe.  Needed an easy pork chop recipe one night and tried it. Wow! fantastic, and I like to think I'm picky, definitely not a "casserole or recipes that involve cans of cream soup" kinda cook.  I did cover it in foil, was afraid chops might become dry in the oven that long if not covered. Chops came out tender and the apple mixture was great and surprisingly not too sweet.  It's a keeper!

Quite tasty and tender. Had thin chops are less time so browned them, removed from pan, threw the rest of the incredients in, tossed the chops on top, and simmered in the covered pan.

Sinfully delicious! Scaled for 2. Used 2 thick boneless chops browned chops in oven-proof skillet; added 2 sliced apples on top; doubled brown sugar, cinnamon & sprinkled on top, dot w/butter; substituted chick broth for sherry (didn't have on hand) & poured over all. Covered & baked 20 min. Removed chops & kept warm, thickened sauce w/1 Tsp. of cornstarch & chick broth. Next time will definitely use sherry! Hubby couldn't stop raving or eating this wonderful dish!

I also used apple pie filling & pork stuffing.  Think 40 minutes is long enough to bake.  Hubby took 1 bite & and said it was great & gave me that greatful look that says I can cook as good as Mom.

This was very good! I used 10 small, 1/2" thick boneless chops and an oven bag, as another reviewer recommended.   The chops took considerably less than 1 hr to cook.  I did think it was a little sweet, and lacking in saltiness or "umami"-- next time, will probably reduce some of the juices with a chicken bouillon cube just to make the gravy a little more savory.  Still, great recipe!

This was a really great recipe.  After reading the other reviews though I would add more apples because they are a wonderful treat.  They can be used as a desert with the meal also.  I also found the sauce to thin after baking the pork chops and added cornstarch to the sauce and apples.  Next time I might branch out and added different kinds of fruit.

Very good recipe but I found that the cut of porkchop may make a difference. A butterfly pork chop was a little on the dry side. Perhaps a little less cooking time would help too.

This was FANTASTIC!!  I doubled the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter, but left everything else the same. I added some cornstarch to a bit of sherry and mixed it into the hot juices after the dish had cooked. It was truly divine!

This recipe was good; I didn't have sherry so I used white wine.  It only took about 40 minutes to bake; I used thin boned chops.  The kids liked it, although skeptical at first.  My fussiest eater went back for seconds!  Definately a keeper!

Definitely thicken the sauce with cornstarch.  I also doubled the brown sugar and used a tsp of cinnamon.  Those were the changes I made to the recipe --- we loved it.

I made this dish for my mom when she came in town, and it was a hit.  Watch the cooking time, I had thinner chops and they were a little overdone after 30 minutes.  Delicious flavor!!

I did them in the slow cooker and threw in an extra apple since I had just one left. One poster said not to do em in the slow cooker as they came out hard and dry. I just can't picture how anything coming out of a slow cooker can come out hard and dry if the lid was on tight. The apples did come out overcooked though. Will try again in the regular oven/family did like the flavor.

This was a fabulous upgrade from other apple pork chop recipes I've tried in the past. I followed the recipe almost as instructed, but instead of baking it pan fried the pork chops and then made the sauce in the same pan until it thickened a bit. Delicious!

I did the recipe as directed, except that i put them in the slow cooker as someone else suggested. After five hours, they were hard dry tasteless lumps. So .. word to the wise: avoid the slow cooker with these.

Very Delicious!  I used pears as that is what I had and it was amazing.  I microwaved the sliced pears one minute to get the juices started before baking.  I also put pears on top and bottom to keep in moisture of the pork.I also melted a whole stick of butter and sauce was very creamy.

This was OK. I used regular chops, not extra thick ones, and after an hour, they were dry. If I make this again, I will probably start the apple mixture first (adding some cornstarch and more of everything else), and add the chops for the last 30 minutes.

Oops, I mistakenly grabbed the bottle of Marsala wine instead of Sherry, so we ended up with “Marsala Apple Pork Chops” instead.  It still turned out delicious. I added some chopped pecans over the apples before popping it into the oven.  Very nice!

YUM!  I seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper before searing and added fennel to the sliced apples, because I don't like my food to be too sweet. When the cops were done, I poured off some of the juices into a saucepan, brought it to a low boil until it was reduced by half, then finished with a little butter. Very good and I will definitely make it again.

This recipe surpassed my expectations. I did thicken the sauce afterward by taking a cup of cold apple juice and mixing it with cornstarch and letting the cooked apples w sauce come to a boil with the apple juice concoction.  Served it with stuffing on the side; I think can easily be a weeknight dinner regular.

Divine!!!!!  So good.  I didn't want the sherry to be too strong tasting for my 2 year old, so I used half sherry and half apple cider.  I also added sage to the pork chops and used white pepper instead of black pepper.  I don't think the butter was necessary, although I did add it.  So delicious.  I will be making this again for sure.

I made this for dinner last night, and it was delicious.  The only change I made was to use white wine instead of sherry, just because that is what I had.  I also drained off some of the juices and used cornstarch to make a sauce for it.  Everyone loved it, but I am a big fan of pork with apples, so I loved it most of all.  Thanks!

These were absolutely delicous! I would have given this 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the stated cook time is WAY too long, despite using extra extra thick chops. I think 40 minutes would have been perfect. I doubled the sugar, cinnamon and butter. The last 10 minutes I added another 1/4 cup of sherry mixed with 2 T cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It was magnificent!

REALLY GOOD! I flavored the pork chops before browning with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. It works just fine with the overall sweetness of the recipe.  Definately double the apples, but only add a bit more of the br. sugar and cinn. otherwise TOO sweet. Sauce is perfect..no cornstarch needed in our opinion! **Also- did saute apple mix in drippings (with 1/4 apple juice) before adding to baking dish 
This was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!!!

The flavors this dish offers are fantastic. . .especially the sherry.  I, however, will slow cook this recipe next time to ensure the pork's tenderness.  Give this one a try!

These pork chops and apples turned out just OK.  I think if I tried them again, I'd put the apples on top of the pork chops so that the juice,of which there was a lot, would help moisten and flavor the chops.  You couldn't taste the sherry, which was a little bit of a disappointment to me.  I think I might try them again with those changes.

I just made for Easter dinner tonight and it was great. I too, thickened the drippings with cornstarch and water for those who wanted a dark sweet gravy for the mashed potatoes. Fantastic dinner!

I am a novice cook, so I followed the recipe to the letter. It could not have turned out better; there were no leftovers. Easily mine and my husband's favorite out of all the dishes we've tried lately.

We loved this recipe, both for its ease and it's flavour. The second time I made it, I added baby carrots in with the pork chops when I was browning them. A very slight sprinkling of almond slivers, just before serving, added the 'crunch' factor we enjoy!

I have tried several recipes on this site and have adjusted many of them to suit what I am looking for at the time . This one can easily be adapted to a more creamy/thick sauce by adding starch or whipping cream but its simplicity allows for you to prepare more robust accompaniments.  The pork turns out so flavorful and if you top it with the apples only, do not be afraid to let the drippings go.  I think this dish can stand on its own.

These were wonderful and very tasty!  I followed a lot of other reviewer's and doubled the brown sugar, cinnamon and butter.  I also added 2T cornstarch to an additional 1/4 C. sherry to add for the final 10 mins.  I think I may have over baked the chops a bit so next time I will cut down the total baking time to only 35 mins. instead of the 50 mins that I did.

Made this last night.  It was very good.  I was using Corningware so browned the chops in the dish stove top, set the chops aside, assembled the dish, put chops back on top and baked.  Added some sauteed onions I had in frige and a little garlic.  Will make again and thinking of trying Brandy instead of Sherry next time.  I made a smaller serving with two chops.  Served it with white and wild rice.

I must be on a lucky string - I'm choosing 5* recipes these days. This one is a 'keeper' - the combination of the apple/cinnamon/butter/sherry is a flavour that defies description. So easy to put together! Would be proud to serve for guests coming over...

I wasn't too crazy about these. The pork was cooked perfectly, but the sauce seemed a little bland and still really thin, even after doing the extra sherry/corn starch trick 10 mins before done like another reviewer said. While it wasn't awful, I don't think I will be keeping this one in my box.

I made this last night. I took one tip from the reviews and I marinaded them in apple juice first. Other than that I followed the recipe and they came out fantastic. We loved them. Yeah, next time I may add a little more salt and tweak to my families taste but this recipe is excellent.

This was really good.  The apples were sweet and caramelized and the pork chops where savory and seasoned.  I nibbled every last tender bit right off the bone.  Super duper!

11-28-09: I made this recipe as is and it was absolutely delicious and easy! I am always trying to find new recipes to make pork chops and this one will definitely be a keeper in our house.  I served the pork chops over rice and with a side of broccoli.  The sauce from the chops/apples over the rice was very good. 10-29-18: Why have we not made this recipe since '09? It's tasty. Some changes now were to season chops with s&p first, sear them, and follow recipe accordingly. Bake time on the chops will be dependent on thickness. I recommend removing the chops earlier and set aside.  We only baked for 30 minutes tonight and think the apples could have used a little more time, but chops were done and apples tender. Delicious flavors here!

This was really tasty and easy to make. I used apple cider vinegar diluted with a little water instead of sherry (didn't have any on hand). The apple cider vinegar gave it a good sweet and tart flavor. I also doubled the brown sugar and used 4 apples like others did.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The cooking time is much too long and the pork chops were very dry.  The apples were okay but the liquid did not make any kind of sauce. And there just was not much flavor overall.

the sauce was very runny, and would of been better if I had drained it out and added cornstarch to make a gravy.  will try this next time.

This is awesome!!! My wife absolutely loved it. I did thicken it with corn starch and water after removing the chops. I also put the chops in the baking dish first, and then covered them with the apples. they came out super tender. no need for a knife.

Wow.  This was AMAZING.  I browned my pork chops on low and gave them a little longer in the pan so they wouldn't be tough.  They turned out really tender.  I also did the 2 tablespoons of corn starch and 1/4 cup of sherry at the end, and I think that really made a difference; the sauce was perfect!

YUMMY!!! I followed suggestions and added a bit of cornstarch and liquid at the end to thicken the sauce. Served it with homemade mashed potatoes and steamed green beans-- the sauce made a good gravy for the potatoes! This was a good "comfort" meal. My husband had 3 plates of it. My 3 year old even ate a little. No leftovers! We'll definitely have this again.

Overall, my husband liked the flavor of the recipe, but he did not like the apples WITH the pork.  We are from the South, hwere baked apples are a breakfast staple, and he could not get past having these apples for dinner.

This recipe was easy and fabulous.  The pork chops were tender and tasted great.  As suggested earlier, I added a tablespoon of cornstarch with some sherry in the last 10 minutes to thicken up the sauce.  It worked beautifully.

This was a wonderful dish! I'm always looking for new ways to cook pork chops. I made a couple of small changes. I wrapped each boneless pork chop in a slightly cooked piece of maple flavored bacon. It gave a very nice presentation. Also, I did not have sherry, but was told port would work and it did. Overall the chops were tender and moist, very flavorful! Thank you!

Very good! I agree though, adding cornstarch is a great way to thicken the liquid and I also like the idea of an oven bag, as it would probably help the pork stay more moist. Other than that, this is a repeat recipe in my opinion.

Used 5 apples and doubled the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Also used 3/4 cup sherry.  This was very watery.  I think the meat would be more tender if the meat was on the bottom and the apples and everything else on top.  
Everybody thought it was barely ok. Will not make again.
Thanks anyway,

A 4-star rating because the concept was great. I think that this dish would be good if the apples and the pork chops were cooked separately, mostly because we decided that we didn't like the slight meat flavor that the apples got. Next time, I will probably cook the apples separately, and put a small sprinkle of cinnamon on the pork chops - along with cooking them in a bit of apple juice/cider.

Excellent recipe!  I was very generous with the brown sugar, cinnamon and sherry - almost doubled them.  My kitchen smelled wonderful when this was in the oven.

This recipe is excellent!!!  I make this frequently to raves.  I have used the boneless pork chops, but prefer using a good fresh pork loin or the pre-marinated teryaki flavor pork loin and I use a cooking bag for easy clean up and juicier meat.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I think next time I make it, I will use boneless porkchops and definately make more sauce.  I did end up thickening up the sauce in the dish after it cooked.

This recipe was a hit with my husband and I. It was easy to make and the pork chops were quite tender. I am sure that any kid would enjoy this recipe also because of the brown sugar and apple.

Very quick, easy and tasty!  I deglazed the pan to get more flavour.  I also thickened the sauce while baking by adding cornstartch and water.

I made it just as is but agree, not enough apples for 6 pork chops.  I used two large thick bone-in chops and the other proportions were perfect.  It's supposed to be a juicy side dish, don't mess with adding cornstarch unless you are looking for a gravy consistency.  One bit of caution, one hour is too long for the chops.  Check the temperature at 40 minutes to avoid drying them out.

This was melt in your mouth delicious! I will be making this again and again. I did make a few changes. I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before browning in olive oil. I used 2 apples instead of 3. Since I didn't have any sherry, I substituted 1/4 C of white wine vinegar and 1/4 of chicken broth. I was a little short on time so I baked as directed for 30 minutes then cut the chops into smaller pieces and put them below the apples into the juice and baked for another 15 minutes.  The chops were incredibly tender, and the apples delicious unlike many other pork and apple recipes where the apples end up bland. Thanks for this amazing recipe!

I browned two boneless pork chops in cast iron pan, pushed them to one side, then in same pan I made two stacks of sliced Granny Smith apples, topped with the brown sugar, cinnamon, butter and the pork chops and added 1/2 C Sherry.  Then placed the pan in the oven for only 30 minutes.  Even though this amount of sauce is the recommended amount for 6 pork chops, we used the entire amount for our two pork chops because the sauce was so delicious. This is a KEEPER!!!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  I followed Gina B. Cookin's advice and doubled the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, which I combined together and dropped in clumps onto four sliced apples which were cut onto the bottom of my baking dish (I also sprinkled dried cranberries on top of the apples, about 1/2 cup).  I browned my pork chops in coconut oil and sprinkled s&p on them,then placed them on top of the apples & cranberries and brown sugar mixture.  I poured the sherry over all, covered and baked for 45 minutes.  Then I removed the foil and broiled on high for 10 minutes.  I combined a little more than 1/4 cup of sherry with 2 T cornstarch and poured it here and there in the sauce in the pan and stirred to thicken the sauce.  The apples were not mushy and there was a good amount of sauce which I also used to top mashed potatoes.

This rocks!  I did add my own touch, which is why I will give it 4 stars... first, I seasoned the chops very well with salt and pepper. I seared them until good and brown in EVOO/butter. Then I tossed in the apples and some thinly sliced onion. I sprinkled the brown sugar and cinnamon on top and splashed the sherry over the whole thing.  A little extra pinch of salt and pepper and I covered this and let it all simmer on the stove top, about 15 more min.  At the very end, I added a little corn starch slurry to thicken the juices.  My hubby and I devoured our chops and were picking at the remaining apples that were left in the pan... perfectly sweet and savory.

Pork chops were moist and delicious (boneless chops seasoned with Montreal Steak Seasoning) - cooked for 40 minutes until they reached 160 degrees. Used Granny Smith Green Apples sliced into 1/8ths and they kind of lost their flavor (I didn't peel the skins off and they kept intact).  I used Trader Joe's Spiced Apple Cider and Pinot Grigio White Wine.  I know, I know, I should not change the recipe but I ran out of Sherry!  A bit of Spiced Apple Cider and Cornstarch to thicken. Added raisins as another suggested and they loved that! Served over mashed potatoes.

Really good! My daughter 99.9% of the time does not care for what I make for dinner. BUT she has asked for this almost weekly (and twice the first week) since I found this recipe! I use the sauce as gravy over mashed potatoes so I'll double or triple that part (still excellent flavor) thanks for this "keeper"!

This is a wonderful recipe. I see some people mentioning a missing WOW factor and the pork chops drying out. I add a few cloves, a little nutmeg and allspice (just a little), and onions. And if you want moist pork, I highly recommend using a tenderloin or pork butt roast instead of chops. I salt and pepper the roast, then I rub it with brown sugar. If I have time, I brown on all sides in a frying pan then put it in the roasting pan on top of the apples, onions and spices and sherry (sometimes I add a little apple juice too) and roast it according to the recipe. I serve it with mashed potatoes because the sherry sauce makes a nice gravy. I think I'm going to make it for Christmas.

This is a first.  I am writing this review while my chops are still cooking.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added additional sherry/cornstarch for the final ten minutes.  Between the wonderful aroma filling my kitchen and the sight of those beautiful chops and apples, I lost all self-control and snitched a sample.  It is one of the most delicious dishes I've ever tasted.  I can't wait to see the expression on my husband's face when he takes his first bite.  I can tell already I'll be making it again soon.

My whole family enjoyed this dish.  I did not have any apples in the house and so I used a can of apple pie filling instead.  I added a little extra cinnamon and brown sugar to it along with a bit of dried cherries.  Also added some fresh minced garlic to the pan while browning and sprinkled on some dried thyme as I love thyme with pork.  Otherwise I followed the directions.

The sauce was very runny and too thin, but the taste was awesome.  Next time, I will try a little cornstarch to make it thicker.

DELICIOUS!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  I seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper while browning them in a little olive oil.  I also used Granny Smith apples and they baked for a total of 50 minutes.  A wonderful dish for autumn and definitely can be served to company!

chops were dry.  perhaps if the chops were down in the liquid rather than sitting on top of the apples then the chops would come out moist.  Won't make again.

I made this last week while visiting my parents for Christmas and we all loved it. I followed the basic recipe, only adding a touch of cardamom along with the cinnamon and brown sugar and since we didn't have sherry on hand, I used apple juice.  It was totally YUM!!

Absolutely phenomenal dish.  The only change I made was to salt & pepper the chops as they browned on both sides.  It was so easy. Thanks Christy J, I will be making this again soon.

I modified it a little too.  I added 1/4 cup of golden raisins, 1/2 can of ginger ale, 1/3 cup of marsala wine since I didn't have sherry or apple juice and 2 tbls corn starch 10 min before it was ready to thicken the sauce. It was delicious! My hubby went for seconds!

This had a very good flavor.  I tried making it in the crock pot (due to laziness) intead of using the oven.  The taste was great, but the presentation left little to be desired, but I know that was because of how I chose to prepare it.  I did double the sauce mix as others suggested.  Maybe next time I will use the oven just so it "looks" better.

The sauce this makes is absolutely delicious.  You could serve just the sherry sauce with apples and it would probably make a fantastic desert.  Compliments a pork dish perfectly, and I'm excited to try the sherry/apple ingredients in other ways.  Great recipe!

My picky eater children LOVED this.  I did use some of the suggestions...doubled everything except the pork chops and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in a little apple juice to thicken the sauce.  Perfect!

Really yummy!  Have made this twice now in the last 2 weeks.  Only thing I would do differently is to add a couple teaspoons of cornstarch to the sherry.  Would be so much nicer to have a thicker sauce rather than the very thin one I get with the true recipe.  Aside from that, cannot ever complain about apples and pork chops.  :)

This recipe had potential however I was disappointed with the end result. I did follow the instructions. I also read all the reviews and reduced baking time to 30 minutes. My pork chops were an inch thick and were overdone. I would recommend a reduction in cooking time to 15 minutes. I also made a sauce as suggested with bacon, onion, butter and more sherry ( I couldn't taste the sherry in apples. We are use to having our pork done medium. Thanks for the recipe we will modify cooking time for next time. I served with Jamie's cranberry spinach salad (excellent) and rice stuffing with apples herbs and bacon from the all recipe website.

This was a great recfipe, only thing I would recommend is cooking the the chops for about 10-15 mins less time, otherwise they will be dry and tough. Other wise a great meal.

Very yummy.  I followed some of the other reviews and marinated the chops in 1/2 c. sherry, 1/2 c. apple juice, and splashed in some soy sauce as well.  I think the sherry was well balanced this way.  Definitely consider the thickness of your chops when baking.  Mine were done in half the time.

I followed this recipe to the letter and even used extra thick pork chops...but must admit it was rather bland and the pork chops were a bit dry after one hour.  I would cook less time and I think the sauce needs some zing---perhaps lemon juice or perhaps the sauce should be reduced so it is sweeter and has more sherry taste.  My family ate this without complaints but no rave reviews either!

this was a very good and easy pork chop recipe.  The pork stayed very moist.  the only thing I changed was I put a layer of apples on top as well as bottom. Would make again.

I made this recipe last night and my husband raved about it.  I only cooked 2 thick pork chops; but, used the ingredients for the full recipe.  I too added some sherry with cornstarch at the end, the sauce looked thin.  I also added about 1/2 c. pecans, this added a nice flavor.  Next time that I make this recipe I will probably add more cinnamon and possibly a little nutmeg.  I thought it was very good; but, missing a little something. Oh, I browned the chops in a little butter.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I followed the recipe, except only used 3 pork chops and added the extra 1/4 cup of sherry with 2 Tbsp of cornstarch as recommended in the reviews.  I will definetly make this one again!

My family loved this dish.  I did as some others suggested and sauted apples mixture before putting it in baking dish and I also added 2 Tbs cornstarch w/1/4 cup more sherry.  The only thing that would make it better would be to find  seasoning that made the pork more flavorful and still complimented the apples.  Any ideas???

We really liked this. I eyeballed everything and used cream sherry - not sure if it's the same thing, but it was pretty tasty. I think I would have preferred a thicker sauce, but the apples and juice were good over potatoes.  Thanks!

Just tried this tonite and it was a winner!  Did as many said and added a bit extra brown sugar and cinnamon.  I thought it would be too sweet but it tasted like baked apples with pork on top - it was great!

Made this recipe for dinner a few nights ago and we really liked it. The only change I made was to double the apples, brown sugar, and butter. I left the amount of sherry the same as called for in the recipe because I didn't want too much juice. It turned out fantastic!

sauce too thin, tasted very bland, apples were not sweet enough, actually the whole dish kinda grossed me out.  i'll continue to look for a better apple pork chop recipe, definitely won't use this one again.

This is delicious!  I used cooking sherry from the supermarket and served it with rice.  A big hit with my husband, myself, and my 9 and 7 year olds.  We can't wait to have it again.  I will use more apples next time.

Great flavor! I used tawny port wine because that is listed online as a substitute for cooking sherry. My inch-thick, boneless, pork-loin chops were done (145 degree center) 40 minutes into the cooking time. I served this with roasted carrot soup and oven-baked French fries, so we did not get to take advantage of the abundant pan juices, which would have been delicious over rice.

So simple to put together and delicious.  I love the sauce it makes!  A bite of cooked apple with a bite of chop, YUM!  My 3 sons liked it too.  I will make it again.

I've made many pork/  Apple and fruit dishes.  I think this is the best of all.  No changes.  Could possible use a bit more sherry.

After reading several reviews I made some changes. First I marinated the chops in some Trader Joe's spiced cider and soy sauce. I salt and peppered them on both sides and browned them in butter. Next I removed the chops from the pan and sautéed the apples in a little more butter, then sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon over and cooked until the sugar melted. I put the chops on the bottom and apples on top and sprinkled the whole thing with Captain Morgan's rum, since I had no sherry. I  baked it for 35 minutes, then removed the food and thickened sauce with corn starch. My husband is still raving about this. He wants me to have a dinner party to show it off!

DELICIOUS and quick! So easy  to make. I used marsala wine (about 1/4 cup) instead of sherry and probably more brown sugar than the recipe called for. But the flavors were perfect together. The apples were tender and I topped it with dried cranberries. Cant wait to make this again.

First time I made per the recipe and it was pretty good but a little dry.  This time I added some golden raisins and some dry stuffing cubes then drizzled honey over it all before placing chops on top.  This made more juice and was delicious.

I made this recipe twice…the first time, following the given recipe. The sauce came out pretty thin, but the flavor was wonderful, and the chops very tender.  
     A week later, I made it a second time, based on a reviewer’s suggestion and used apple pie filling instead of fresh apples. Again, the sauce was thin, but wonderful flavor, and tender. With the apple pie filling, I also used the other ingredients; brown sugar, cinnamon, butter, and sherry. I also added a sprinkling of nutmeg.  
     Both times I used boneless loin chops. Salted…peppered, and seared before putting in the baking dish. Tonight I will be preparing it again, using the apple pie filling. This time I will thicken the sauce. Now that I have finished tweaking the recipe to suit me, it will become a regular meal in our household.  
     Most excellent.

It was decent. The meat just didn't absorb a lot of flavor so I think that marinating it in something like apple cider vinegar would go a long way.

I had to make a couple changes. Mainly, I upped the brown sugar and cinnamon and apples because I had 6 chops. I also used apple juice instead of sherry because - well, my family made me!  I cooked it in a large cast iron skillet, then cooked the apples and sugar and placed chops on top followed by apple juice.  I followed another reviewer and added two teaspoons of corn starch  for the last ten minutes. This recipe was soooo delish! Even husband and kiddo who don't like cooked fruit in food loved it. By the way, I'm sure that the original recipe is also wonderful - I just had to appease my family. This recipe was a lot of fun to cook - perfect challenge for us newer cooks. Thanks for posting!

I prepared and baked as written and suggest the following.  Reduce baking time or check on meat after 20 minutes as my 3/4" chops were over done at full cooking time.  I also added cornstarch and thickened the sauce.  The sherry adds avery delicate flavor which makes this recipe worth repeating.  If you like raisins they would go well in the sauce.  I combined  1/2 cup raisins with 1/2 cup of sherry in a measuring cup, microwaved on high for 30 seconds. and added to the finished sauce.

The flavors are perfect.  I used a 2 lb pork loin that I cut into medallions and seared on medium high heat after seasoning with salt and pepper.  I transferred them to a casserole dish and focused on the sauce.  I added 1  tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 3 T of butter and 2/3 cup of sherry to deglaze the pan.  I placed the apples in a casserole dish, added the pork medallions and then the sauce.  I covered the dish and baked for 1 hour.  I transferred the drippings to a saucepan and added 3 T of corn starch to 1/2 cup of drippings and then added it to the remainder in the pan on medium heat.  The gravy was used for a topping on the pork medallions and apples along with the mashed potatoes side dish.  I served petite peas and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  Well done!

Great flavour, I enjoyed it very much. I can't understand why the pork chops are soo dry. I know I didn't over cook them. Chops have certainly lost their flavour.

I was excited to try this dish after reading all the great reviews.  This recipe was outstanding!  I used pork roast that I sliced into  thick, chop-like portions, used an extra apple and increased the brown sugar, cinnamon and sherry.   The result - one delicious meal.   Using some water and cornstarch is the ticket to thicken the sauce.   My husband loved this so much  that he used the leftover warm sauce over ice cream for dessert!   Will definitely make this again and again!

Unless your chop has some marbling  it will be dry which surprised me given that it was braised and quite thick
The liquid needs some thickening as well

Delicious! Only thing I did differently was salt and pepper the pork chops while browning and also added about 3/4 cup sherry since I wanted to finish the bottle on hand. Other than that, made as directed. Thank you, Christy, will make again.

This was very good. I will make it again. I did change it a little. After browning the pork chops I added a little flour and browned it then added the sherry(more than called for) and heated until it thicken then poured over the dish.

It was easy to make and tasted very good. I did substitute chicken breasts for the pork chops.

Quick & delicious main dish. I used more cinnonmon , less  nutmeg.  Not a huge fan of nutmeg.  Make sure you use butter.  It adds a lot of flavor to the dish.

This was easy and quit different, I think my sherry was a little too sweet, and I should have thickened the sauce as suggested by some. But we enjoyed it. Thank you for a unique recipe.

Likely won't make again. We found the dish too sweet and the sauce too thin. I did thicken it with cornstarch but the flavour just not there for us.

This was really good!! I was not sure if I would like it and I LOVED it!!  I did "tweek" the original recipe a bit, to accommodate my taste. I did season the meat with salt/pepper and fresh garlic prior to searing the pork in my cast iron skillet. I used juice instead of the sherry, only because I didn't have any, I also added a smidge of cornstarch to the apples to thicken it up. My four teenagers loved the homemade apple sauce. Will make again. Thanks!

Very good flavour.  I briefly cooked the apples in the pan after browning the pork chops.  Substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar.

we made it and doubled the sauce (2x: butter, cinnamon, brown sugar) as well as added 1/4 cup sherry and 2 TBSP corn starch in the last 10 minutes like others suggested and it was still lacking in flavor and kind of bland.

The sherry/cinnamon combo added a unique flavor that seeped into the pork that was nice; but, all-in-all, we won't make this again.

I didn't have any sherry on hand so I used port with a little white wine to lighten it a bit and it was fantastic. There were no left overs!

Made this last night for our Sunday dinner.  It was delicious.  I followed the recipe to the letter except I did follow some other recommendations. I salt  and peppered the chops before browning,  I reduced the cooking time and I am really glad I did 35 minutes was plenty.  I also mixed up some sherry with a tablespoon of cornstarch just to thicken the sauce a little.  I served these chops with stuffing and it went perfectly I also served some fresh green beans just boiled and tossed with butter and salt and pepper.  The meal   is one I will definitely make again.  There was enough left over to freeze and have another meal.  This one is a keeper!

I made it and it turned out great.

My only variation was rendering 4 strips of bacon to use for browning the chops, and then breaking the bacon up and sprinkling it on top of the apples before adding the chops to the pan.

I used 1/2 inch bone in chops and 4 Fuji apples.  I spread lightly brown sugar by hand due to the fact I didn't want the apples too sweet.  The last 10 min. I added 1/4 Cup mixed with 2 T of cornstarch too thicken the sauce.  This is a tasty recipe and definitely a keeper!!!

It produced far too much juice and I reduced it to a thick sauce.  The sherry was a good addition though.  Try adding 1 cup dry sherry with 1/2 cup water to your roasting pan when cooking your turkey.  Makes for fabulous tasting pan drippings!   I seared the pork chops in olive oil and butter for several minutes.  I then sautéed the apple slices with cinnamon in the pan juices with finally de-glazing the pan with the sherry.  Then poured all into an oven safe dish and baked as directed and covered.  I do think the cover can be removed at mid-point and basting and I don't think they required an hour to cook through.  Mine were perfectly fine after 45 minutes of baking.

Haven't made it yet because I have too many questions:   Thick,  "regular" or thin chops?  With bones or boneless?  How thick should the apple slices be?  If I don't have sherry, what can I substitute?  We usually only have orange juice & cranberry juice in the house.

Instead using brown sugar, I use organic
 Maple syrup or honey.

Sometimes using cognac instead of sherry.

I was not impressed, I mean the apples where wonderful, but the taste was a bit...bland for the pork.  I even added nutmeg for a little more flavor. Something is missing I just don't know what that something is.

Excellent flavor! I used one very large honey crisp apple (that was all I had) and 4 very large pork chops. The rest of the recipe I followed by eye measurement except for the sherry, I did measure that.  The taste was very nice, sweet and the apple slices (with skin on) tasted great! Would definitely make this again and recommend it!

Didn't want any leftovers so I used 2-8oz. boneless sirloin pork chops (one inch thick). Sliced but didn't peel 2 Gala apples (no seeds) and layered them in the bottom of a  sprayed 8" casserole. Sprinkled generously with brown sugar and lots of cinnamon. Placed browned pork chops on top with salt and pepper. Covered. Cooked 1 hour at 350 with a sweet potato on the side. Served with "Grillin' Beans". Perfecto!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  The pork chops were nice and moist after and hour bake time, and the apples with the sugar (I used coconut sugar) and the cinnamon were delicious!  The only other change I made was to use only 2 large apples, which was perfect, 3 would have been A LOT!  Yummy!

I substituted the pork chops with Johnsonville hot Italian sausage and did everything else the same. This turned out phenomenal! I served it over some creamy Parmesan polenta. This will for sure become a fall favorite for us!

I went apple picking and had no idea what to do with all the apples. Came across this recipe and I loved it! My husband was so surprised that it tasted so good! I will definitely make it again and again!!!

A lot of people said they were increasing the sauce and apples, so since there were two people I just kept the recipe the same and used two thick bone in pork chops.  I made a couple of small changes and they were AMAZING.  I put the apples in the bottom of the pan but mixed the butter/cinnamon/brown sugar together before kinda smearing it on.  I rubbed the chops with salt and pepper before browning them then, when I put them in the pan, put some apples and cinnamon goop on top, around, and under the meat.  I also used just a tiny bit more sherry and made sure to flip and stir the chops around while they were baking so they stayed moist.  I cooked them for slightly under an hour, 50 min I think?  The most important thing I think is just to make sure to flip the meat a bit while cooking so it doesn't dry out, and to have some apple mixture on top and below it.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I had 4 chops instead of 6 but it still filled the pan and I used a sauvignon blanc instead of sherry. It was amazing! But I would make one small change on how I cooked it. I would put the apples on top next time, it seemed that's where all the flavor went. Really simple to do too!

I didn't have the sherry but my hubby and I thought this was a do again recipe. I made it only for two and it turned out great. Very easy. It took longer to thaw out the chops than it did to make it. Will make this again.

These were really tasty. Apples and pork chops go real good together. And the sherry made it wonderful.

This is a decent recipe. There is nothing spectacular about it. You taste all the ingredients, apples, brown sugar and cinnamon along with a bit of sherry taste, but it is a bit too liquid even with the added cornstarch someone suggested.
Will pass on this after trying it tonight.
I have a feeling that similar ingredients cooked differently might taste better.

Delicious! I only cooked the pork chops for about 40 minutes (instead of an hour) and I probably could have cooked it for less time since they were a little too well done. I also took the apples and juice out of the pan after I baked the chops, poured it into a saucepan, added a little spoonful of brown sugar and flour, and cooked the mixture for a few minutes over the stove just to make the apples softer and the sauce thicker.

on my second cooking of this meal I used a bit more sugar  and deglazed the skillet with sherry I seared the chops in and poured that over the chops and apples and also a pinch all spice kind of added a bit more zing to the flavor and a nice under taste But this was a great recipe thanks for sharing

I made this last night and it was great!  I don't usually like cooked apples, but this was superb.  I did add some apple sauce and served it over quinoa.  Will definately make again.

Very good, not quite as much of the wow factor as I expected though.  I seasoned and seared the pork first, and also briefly cooked the apples with the cinnamon and sugar before putting in the baking dish.  Great flavor and would make again.

The cooking time really is dependent upon how thick your chops are, and I think the recipe should make note of that.  Mine were bone-in, center-cup chops about  3/4" thick.  I checked them at 30 minutes, and the thermometer read 165 degrees F, totally overcooked.  In spite of the dryness, the flavor was excellent, and the broth made a fantastic sauce thickened with a cornstarch slurry.  Definitely will try this again, next time starting to check at 20 minutes.

AWESOME fall recipe!  The cinnamon hit the spot.  I added gold and regular raisins and 2 cinnamon sticks to the baking pans.  The raisins really added a great sweetness to the overall flavor.  I didn't have sherry, so I used a bourbon and it was still really good!  10

This was liked by all , but wasn't one that I was begged to make again.  If/when I make it again, I will try to thicken up the juice with some cornstarch and make a sauce for the chops.

DH loved this-I think it is okay, but nothing special.  I used three Gala apples, used apple juice instead of sherry, and used country ribs.  I cooked these for 5 hours in the crock pot on "low".  The apples were wonderful and the pork was good, but I didn't really enjoy the combination of flavors.  DH did, and wants it again soon.

What a wonderful, simple and delicious weeknight recipe!  So seasonal, I used granny smith apples for a nice tart taste.  I made exactly as written, just browned my chops in an oven safe saute pan, and removed and added the apple slices and spices, butter, then just placed them on top with the sherry and into the oven they went.  Moist and tasty, plenty of pan juices.  Oh, and I did add some dried cranberries to the mix.  Hubs raved over this.  Thank you for sharing your recipe. Update 10/22/12...Tonight I rubbed the pork chops with McCormic Jerk seasoning then browned, wow, adds wonderful flavor that compliments the brown sugar/cinnamon so well.
