I tried  blueberrys preserves and fresh blueberries as a replacement and I love either way. Also a half scoop of vanilla protein supplement never hurts. I think that I like fresh fruit, over preserves but that's my preference. Great breakfast tho!! Great combo!

I made a few changes due to not having all the fruits. I used ½ banana, ½ cucumber, ¼ cup of dried blueberries and ¼ cup of Foco coconut water. It turned out delicious. I was pleasantly surprised.  When it comes to smoothie colors I get turned off, but after I tasted it I didn't care one bit. I will definitely be making this more often. Thanks!

This was good, but too much buttermilk for my taste. I would cut it back and use more coconut water instead. I used frozen blueberries instead of preserves, and that worked great. I had this as an afternoon snack; I don't think I'd like the cucumber for breakfast.
