What a great tasting and healthy snack!! Thanks Chef John!! I used one can of garbanzo beans instead of soaking dried beans. I drained and rinsed the beans thoroughly. I then laid them on paper towel to absorb some leftover water. I placed the beans in a small bowl because I find that easier when combining ingredients. I used one tablespoon of olive oil and one teaspoon of a new spice I just purchased in my grocery store, called Sriracha  Seasoning. It is a DRIED spice I found on the grocery shelf right next to all the other dried spices. If you're a fan of sriracha chili sauce then you will just love this new dried seasoning. I also sprinkled a little sea salt and pepper on the beans. I gave it a good mixing and then poured the mixture on a baking dish treated with non-stick cooking spray. I baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then stirred as directed. Since they looked almost done, I placed them back in the oven for 10 minutes more. They came out perfect with a total of 30 minutes cooking time. Spicy and delicious!

Yum! We added a bit more of the spices, a sprinkle instead of a pinch,and had to use cajun seasoning since I was out of cayenne pepper. We also added a bit of salt after trying them. Very good.

I love using chickpeas (garbonzo beans) instead of nuts as a snack.  This recipe is extremely flexible.  You can use any spices that you love with them.  You can even roast in a skillet them with a little brown sugar and cinnamon to get something similar to the candied pecans they sell in tourist destinations.  If you like the chickpeas a little saltier, try soaking them in heavily salted water.  Then use just a little salt when seasoning them.  This helps to get the seasoning all the way through the bean instead of just the coating.

Soaking the beans allows the hour of roasting to cook them and make them chewable when they come out of the oven.  If you just put spices on dried beans, they won't cook and you'll crack your teeth on them.

First of all, it's bland.  Needs a lot of salt and a good kick of spices, not just the pinch recommended.  Really hit it with salt and oil.  Also, don't overcook them. My oven is a bit uneven and when taking them out of the oven, half the chickpeas were the color of the photo, and half were darker. When hot and fresh out of the oven, the lighter ones were soft and squashy, the darker ones nice and crunchy.  But when cool, the lighter ones are nice and crunchy, and the darker ones are burnt.  So lesson learnt. I'll probably make them again because the recipe is cheap, easy, and unusual.  And they will probably turn out better the next time!

I soaked a full pound of chickpeas for 24 hours and then got them reasonably dry.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I placed the chickpeas in a gallon ziplock bag and added 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I spread the chickpeas in a single layer on parchment paper lined cookie sheets with sides.  Then I liberally applied Sriracha seasoning (Weber’s Sriracha Rub), in place of the spices.  I didn’t try to stir the chickpeas nor coat them evenly.  As the recipe directed I pulled the pan from the oven at 20 minute intervals.  I used a pancake turner to flip the chickpeas and sampled a few chickpeas for texture and to see what adjustments I need to make.  I broadcast sea salt over them and returned them to the oven.   I’m pleased with how this recipe turned out.  They are crispy on the outside, soft inside and flavorful.  I’m making it for a hostess gift.

Very tasty!  Doubled the recipe and did not make any other changes.  Served as an appetizer at family gathering.  The seasoning was good, the chickpeas were firm, but not hard.  Plan to make again this weekend.

I didnt think I would like these as much as I did! I gave 4 stars because I made a slight change. I used a can of chickpeas, rinsed well and dried completely.  then I dry roasted them for 35 min at 375. Then i tossed them with the oil and seasoning. this prevented any burning.  Once cooled they were super crispy and delicious! I used a jar seasoning I already had - sweet chili lime.  I think any seasoning would be great but they definitely need some salt.

Excellent.  People who would not normally eat chickpeas loved them prepared this way.

I may have soaked the chickpeas in water for too long because after cooking them, they had a weird flavor, I thought they tasted somewhat rotten. I used dried chickpeas from a bag. not sure what happened, but they didn't taste good. Any thoughts?  Thank you.

2 6 18 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/241874/crunchy-spiced-chickpeas/ ... 'Can't say I'm impressed with this one.  As the most helpful positive review did, I subbed with canned beans.  I didn't use any oil, just sprayed the pan.  'Read a review about doing that.  At first, taste dlike undercooked pumpkin seeds - the texture - then small pebbles.  As for the seasoning, not too much impressive there either.  The most helpful really loved them - duh, most helpful - so I may try again.  'Took my time, but not much money.  We'll see.

The spices weren't very strong on these. Definitely use more than a pinch. I left them in just under an hour. Also I used canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed, because that's what I had. These made an easy snack.

Super simple. 5 stars for the method. It is easy to season after they have finished cooking, so you can create a spice blend that is perfect for your tastes.

I would make two batches since it takes an hour in the oven.   Delicious healthy snack.  It took more salt than I thought.  I re-seasoned the first two times I stirred them.  Also be careful at the end, they quickly go from a little mushy to crunchy to overdone.  My kids loved them and they're so much healthier than chips.

Chef John - what do you consider a pinch? I love a good amount of your recipes but this lacked flavor. I used 1/2 t of each ingredient and still added some garlic powder for extra zing. At 40 minutes peas were great- at one hour they were over cooked/ burnt (may be my oven but everything else cooks spot on so....) so advice is add lots of spice and only 1 T oil and less cooking time and then they are a five star recipe!! Will try again with modifications

It is much easier if you use a little flour to help the oil and spices to stick to the chick peas.  Toss the peas in a plastic bag or snap on top type bowl.  That covers the peas much better.

These are delicious. I added a lot more of the listed spices and added some Cajun seasonings. I put everything in a zipper bag to toss and coat evenly then baked as described stirring and tasting often. I will definitely make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly as written.  Made twice as the first time I burnt the chick peas. (An hour cooking time is way too long. At the 20-25 minute mark of baking I would keep a close eye on these as they burn quickly.) A pinch of...=no flavour! Measurements for spices would be helpful. I usually like Chef John's recipes, but this was a BIG miss.
