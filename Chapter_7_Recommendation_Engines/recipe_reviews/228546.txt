I don't know how someone couldn't just LOVE this recipe!  I did think that one could cut back by almost half the amount of flour mixture for the dredging.  I'm not sure why it's not easier to put the flour/salt/pepper in a baggie and shake it all.  The butter is what makes or breaks this recipe.  If you are making this one, just figure that you will splurge on the butter and don't mix it with olive oil (as I am usually wont to do).  I do always use more capers than called for because we love them.  I halved the recipe for a package of Costco's boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in half both horizontally and vertically.  This is a hit and will be repeated!  I served it with Opa George's Wild Rice recipe.  Our dinner was SOOOO good!  Thanks!

I think the trick to making good chicken piccata is to really pound the hell out of the chicken.  I made this for dinner tonight; I used 2 quite large boneless skinless chicken breasts (1.4 lbs total) and ended up with 15 pieces after I pounded it and cut it up (I just use kitchen shears to cut up chicken, they make it super easy).  I had to use 2 very large skillets to cook it all.  Also, I dip my chicken pieces in egg first, then flour (both mixed with salt & pepper), then let them sit until the egg and flour have kind of mixed together into a paste before cooking them.  Don't be afraid to turn up the heat a little... I melt the butter on a 6, add the chicken, let it brown about 5 minutes, turn it, brown it on the other side 5 minutes, then add the lemon juice and wine, turn down the heat to low and don't bother removing the chicken, but I do cover it at this point.  I don't add the capers until the end, and I turn the chicken one more time to coat it in the beautiful brown sauce that has formed! It has taken me quite a few tries to perfect this but tonight I can honestly say it was better than my favorite restaurant!

This is excellent!  The only change I made was to use half the amount of chicken and cut the breasts into medallions, pounding them approximately Â¼ inch thick.  Next time I would use half the amount of flour mixture for dusting the chicken.

I just made this recipe for dinner tonight! It took so little time to cook and we absolutely loved it. Chicken came out very tender. I did not have capers, but it was wonderful without them. Will be making again

Just remember when making any sauce...finish it by stirring in a tablespoon of butter! Also the longer the lemon juice cooks, the more bitter it becomes..add it nearer to the end. Otherwise, delicious!

This is the best chicken piccata recipe I have ever tasted. Better than any restaurant. I serve it with steamed asparagus because it is so fabulous with the sauce. My husband inhales it. I used Naked Grape Pinot Grigio for the sauce. It's perfect and affordable.

We are very health conscious so I did make a few changes!  I used whole wheat flour - I did half butter and half olive oil - I also used freshly squeezed Meyers Lemons which are amazing!  Instead of serving it on pasta - I served on spaghetti squash with a side of steamed spinach drizzled in lemon!  Amazing and healthier!!!!

I made this recipe last night.  Absolutely amazing.  I did add extra lemon juice, wine, and capers... and a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I also purchased already thinly sliced chicken breasts. Served it over angel hair pasta and it was perfect.

Chicken Piccata one of my favorites

I pound the chicken rather than cutting in half. I salt and pepper the chicken before I dredge in flower.  I use olive oil instead of butter to cook the chicken. I add the capers after I have taken the chicken out and since we love capers I do add a lot ( I crush 1/3 to release the juice) add wine next wait for reduction then I add the lemon I and water and half stick of butter.  The I add halved artichokes love the taste of the artichokes in the butter lemon sauce.  Once the butter is melted add chicken stick in over for a bit and serve over pasta

I used this recipe as a base.  Having made chicken piccata before I will say this is a good recipe.  Changes made:  I left out the lemon slices, which was a mistake. The slices should be very thin and cooked in the sauce so that they sweeten with the sauce and become edible. After removing the chicken I add fresh minced garlic and a thin chiffonade of fresh basil (about 2 tbs) just after the garlic has toasted then I add the wine.  I do not use parsley.
Some of the processes in cooking are over simplified in the direction and likely is responsible for lower rating scores.
The biggest understatement is that the wine is not just cooked for 10 minutes, it is reduced till it traces behind the spoon when stirring.  That is, when you pull your spoon thru the reduction a trail of about 2" where the bottom of the skillet is exposed before the sauce rejoins.  This is about the perfect thickness.  Also if the sauce is not sweet enough, you can always add more wine and reduce further.  After the wine is reduced, add the chicken back in and allow the chicken to soak up the sauce then put the chicken on a platter and spoon all the sauce, capers and basil over the chicken.
If there is not enough sauce with reason you can add a little more butter and wine and reduce again just prior to covering the chicken.

I was looking for something different to make with my boneless chicken breasts. This recipe was delicious and quick. My husband and I enjoyed it. The only thing I would do next time is tenderize the chicken with a mallot. I did add Gold Medal Wondra to thicken the sauce at the end. Served over egg noodles. Most scrumptious!

Butter and lemon is the flavor of the dish. Be careful not to burn the butter while browning the chicken. As you are browning the chicken in 1/2 cup butter. I used 1/2 a lemon juiced and thinly sliced 1/4 of the remaining lemon and cooked  with the sauce as a suggestion by another review.  No problem cooking the sauce down, which I doubled, as others indicted not enough sauce. Chicken tastes like butter (without the sauce), and the sauce had too much lemon flavor per our taste. Love the capers which I rinsed before adding to the sauce. I served the sauce on the side.

We thought this had bit too much of a lemon taste and not enough of a buttery richness. I think I will try to use less lemon next time and reserve some of the butter to add toward end of cooking. Chicken was moist and tender though.

I didn't change a thing and it was wonderful. Not too lemony, but I really like lemon so I don't know if would be too lemony for others.

I just made this recipe for dinner tonight!  It was absolutely delicious!  My husband loved it but thought maybe I should cut back just a bit on the lemon juice so next time I will just add 1/2 of the lemon juice.  I think it was the best chicken piccata I have ever made!!

This was good.  Hubs liked it better than I did.  Lemon is often too tart for me, so I cut the lemon juice way back and still thought it was too tart.  I even added another pat of butter to try to tone it done.  Probably not the fault of the recipe.  I have ordered chicken picatta in restaurants and loved it.  This recipe just may not have the right balance for me.  Iâll try again sometime.

I made this tonight, was super easy and sooooo good!  The chicken was so moist; like others have said, the more you pound the chicken the better it is! As the chicken was cooking, I made angel hair pasta to go with it which was delicious!  Once the sauce was done, I put the chicken back in the pan to coat it and then put the pasta in the bottom of the serving dish, put chicken on top and poured the sauce over it all.  OMG!!!! So, so awesome!

I used almond flour for dredging and chicken stock instead of wine and baked on a wire rack/cookie sheet instead of frying. It turned out amazing!

careful not to add so much lemon and the kids didn't like the capers :(.  other than that, the recipe was yummy.  I cut the chicken into medalions and pounded flat each medalion.  perfect.

Refreshing way to serve chicken.  The lemon and white wine provide a lively light sauce, seasoned nicely by the capers.  This recipe is a keeper.

I'm not sure what happened, but the chicken went from being raw on the inside one minute and being rock hard the next.    :(   

The flavors were good though, but I couldn't salvage the chicken breasts, so I probably won't be making this again.

This was good!  I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was too much butter and lemon for our taste.  I made this exactly to recipe.  One thing though the chicken was tender and juicy and turned out perfect.  Thanks Lrohner for a nice recipe that I will no doubt try again.

My family likes a lot of sauce so I used chicken broth to add to the sauce, plus thickened the sauce with corn starch. Turned out amazing!

The sauce has a very strong taste, a little less lemon would have been better. Made with linguine and a light alfredo sauce on the linguine. This balanced out the piccata sauce from the chicken. The kids were not a huge fan but the hubs and I liked it ok.

Loved it, I doubled the sauce to use on some angel hair and only put the chicken back in the stock for a quick turn. Great recipe.

I don't bread or flour the chicken (diabetic in the family doesn't need the extra carbs). Also use about a tablespoon of capers rather than a teaspoon. I make this often! It's simple, relatively quick, and delicious. What more can you ask?

This was amazing.  A added lemon zest to the flour, kept the chicken warm in the oven before serving, added 3 cloves of garlic to the pan before deglazing, and added a 1/2 chicken stock with the wine and upped the wine to 1 cup ( we love the sauce). It was amazing.  My 12 year old son said his favorite dish is this now.  Super super easy.

Turned out great. Will definitely make again. Can be made ahead of time, just keep meat warm in oven at 200, and sauce very low on stove. When ready to serve heat sauce, add meat, serve over spaghetti. Enjoy!
I followed the recipe but added Garlic Powder and Paprika to the Flour along with the other seasonings.
Using a combination of Butter and Olive Oil to fry cutlets not only cut some of the fat, but gave it a healthy punch.

Great recipe and fairly easy.  I used gluten free flour because of a guest and will do it again because I think that flour coated better.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  I did not have any white wine, so I used Sherry cooking wine and it was fantastic.  if I make it for those who are not gluten intolerant, I will use the gluten free flour, but regular pasta.  I also used 3-4 times the capers suggested.  it was good!

This recipe is fantastic! Absolutely delicious! We passed on the extra lemon slices at the end, and I added 1/3 cup of heavy whipping cream to the cooking wine for a little extra creaminess. Also, added an extra 3 teaspoons of capers because they are delicious! My husband wants me to make this once a week now, which I think Iâm OK with! LOL

This came our wonderfully savory and delicious! And it was easy. I pounded the chicken breasts between two sheets of freezer paper, followed the recipe except cut the butter to 2 Tbs, omitted olive oil, squeezed lemon juice instead of slicing, and increased the wine to 1 cup. Turned out great!

Delicious and simple recipe.  I substituted gluten-free flour and added egg before dipping it into flour, which worked great.  I had to use a lot of butter to keep it frying, since the batter absorbs it.  Better than a lot of restaurants that I order it from.

Wasn't wat I was hoping for. I halved the amount of everything except for the capers but there still wasn't enough of those. Maybe the caper flavor wasn't strong enough because I was overwhelmed by butter! I could imagine my arteries clogging as I was making it, and I only used half of wat was called for. The recipe also calls for way more flour than is needed.

I made a lot of modifications to this - not out of disrespect for the original poster, but due to who I am as a person.

I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts because that's what was in the freezer.

I was going to drop the white wine down to 1/4 cup and use 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth, but there was a little less than 1/4 cup of wine in the bottle, so I used it up and topped off the missing amount with broth. I left off the parsley because I don't like leafy garnishes.

I always like to see what people pair their meat with because my default is bell peppers. I tried the 'Easy Lemon and Garlic Broccoli.' It's mostly black because I apparently do not understand how to steam broccoli. I added another squirt of lemon juice and my husband was wise enough to pretend he didn't notice.

I also paired it with a glass of Merlot out of annoyance with how the broccoli turned out. Also, I happen to like Merlot and the bottle was already open.

Overall, the chicken was 216 calories per serving and delicious. I would make it again.

The sauce is fantastic! When you pop the chicken into your mouth, there's this unusual, but pleasant, explosion of tangy flavor. But after a while, you taste the salt and you can't help but grimace. In other words,  this is too salty for me. Next time, I will probably just add a pinch of salt (literally a pinch).

Tasted Amazing! My family took a bite and literally said, "Holy S***, this is great!" I added some diced onions for flavor. This dish is on the saltier side, but I'm a salt lover so I don't care. The only white wine I had was Moscato. I used it and it turned out great. This will be making its way into my regular rotation.

Terrible.  There is no thickening agent for the lemon and wine- they will just boil off if you aren't careful.  I saw someone else tried adding some corn starch - I tried some flour and it just looked like vomit.  Makes very little sauce.  I had to add a lot more juice and wine.Not much on flavor, either.  I really wonder if anyone actually made this recipe??!!

I made some changes to suit our tastes and dietary needs.  I used a gluten free corn masa flour. I doubled the amount of Butter for cooking, I doubled the amount of Chardonay white wine, I doubled the Lemons to (2) Lemons, I doubled the amount of capers to 2 teaspoons, and I doubled the amount of Parsley to 4 teaspoons. I chopped up my parsley in a chopper and I added it to the saute pan with the liquid at the end and I let it simmer in with the wine, capers, butter and Lemon juice for a few minutes, before I added my chicken to the saute pan. I then let the chicken simmer in the pan with the juices before I put all in a serving dish. I then poured the remaining saute pan liquid over the chicken. The recipe passed the toughest critic, my husband. Thank you very very much. For the first time I made a successful chicken Piccata.

Made this as written, but doubled the sauce. Delicious! A bit too lemony for my kids but they still enjoyed it! Maybe I'll reduce the lemon juice a bit next time for them, but for me it it was great! I made double sauce because I made lots of fettuccini.

We loved it.  Only changes were minor.  I added a cup of water and two chicken bouillon cubes when adding the wine.  I also used about 2-3 tablespoons of capers and didn't bother with the garnish.  Would probably do garnish if serving for company.

My teenaged daughter made this. Very good. I would probably cut the butter down a bit [had a lot left in the pan] and add more capers.

I've made this several times. Super easy and delicious. I would double the sauce and I add an extra 2 tsp of flour right after I remove the chicken. Just helps set up the sauce quicker and thicker.

So good and so delicious.  I used breast filets already prepped from the butcher.  Other than that, no changes!  Served over pasta.  My family loved it.  Will definitely make again.  And again.

Husband and I both liked this. I adjusted quantities a bit, to fit the amount of chicken I had -- one humongous half-breast, weighing almost a pound -- and I cut the breast into four slices rather than into pieces. Half a cup of flour was more than enough, and I think I used about a quarter to a third cup of butter. Saved some butter to add when the sauce was almost done, to swirl in and thicken. Having found out another time that we don't like capers straight from the jar, I rinsed them this time! Also, I didn't have an extra lemon, so no lemon slices.

I made this for dinner with some roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts as a side dish. It was delicious. My boyfriend loved it! Next time I'll use half the amount of flour because I found it to be too much.  Such a quick and easy dish!

This is a great recipe! I made 4 times the amount and the roommates devoured it in no time. However, i did a few things differently. I used 3 tablespoons of butter instead of half a cup and substituted the rest with olive oil. For the sauce i used a cup of chicken broth and a cup of white wine and let it cook down for about 10 minutes. Turned out really well.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! Didn't change a thing except I didn't have quite enough butter and had to add some olive oil. It turned out great. The lemon taste was perfect. I do believe you could do with less flour and shake in a bag, as someone previously suggested. Served with noodles in light alfredo sauce and spinach.

I took the liberty of adding some fresh chopped thyme to the flour mixture just because I had some on hand.  I also used bottled lemon juice instead of a fresh juiced lemon and used about 1/8 of a cup.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T
In hindsight, I wish I had doubled the sauce because we had 4 huge breasts that my husband butterflied, so we ended up with 8 pieces and there wasn't sufficient sauce to go around.  Note to self for next time :)
We served it with buttered linguine and salad-it was an excellent meal!

I have made this many times. I use the chicken breast tenders and cook very slowly on low heat once I add the chicken to the sauce. Delicious!
