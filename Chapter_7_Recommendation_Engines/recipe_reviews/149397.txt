This is a good recipe. Just a few modifications: since queso fresco does not melt, I will probably use a different cheese next time (maybe Monterrey cubes or even pepperjack). Also, make sure to reserve some of the water from boiling the plantains to add to when mashing, otherwise they are too dry and will crumble when molding into balls. Finally, if you are a garlic lover you can add a couple of pressed cloves or some garlic powder when mashing, it will enhance the flavor. Serve with avocado and some sewed meat and presto!

Good recipe. I suggest cooking it a few minutes longer and serve with a red enchilada sauce.

Flavor was good however the cheese did not melt and the plantains fell apart. Recipe should warn that it requires some of the plantain water in order to make them moist enough to preserve their shape. Will try this again but with some of this water.

I really liked this idea and the finished product was good.  It could have been my lack of cooking ability that led to them being so greasy and falling apart and it seemed like it needed one more flavor that I could not determine.  The next time I cook these, I think I will try adding a little oil to the plantain mix and cook it in the oven.  I haven't been able to think of the other flavor I would like to add.
