I added extra chicken to this recipe.  Also, did not follow the recommended layering technique.  I made this lasagna the way I make my regular lasagna: 1) mixed ALL of the alfredo sauce with the chicken; 2) put a little sauce on bottom of pan so it won't stick; 3)layer of noodles; 4) layer of chicken/sauce mixture; 5)layer of mozzarella; 6) layer of spinach.  Repeat last three layers two more times.  Cover and bake 50-60 minutes, than uncover, add mozzarella cheese on top and bake until chees is golden.

Served this at a dinner party and got rave reviews!  I doubled the recipe, used the lasagna noodles you don't have to cook, Classico Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce and added 1 bunch of chopped spring onions to the sauce. I also spread about a cup of the sauce on the bottom of the pan before adding the noodles so they didn't stick, then mixed the chicken in with the rest of the sauce and put about another cup of it on top of the last layer of noodles before adding the cheese.

This lasagna was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was that I added 1/2 of an onion and some sliced garlic cloves sauteed in olive oil. I mixed the onion/garlic mixture in with the chicken and sauce...YUM!

Really very good. I split the recipe in half and put the two lasagnas in square 8x8 dishes, one for tonight, one to freeze.  I would say each 8x8 dish would give me 6 good size servings.  I did add a little more chicken to the recipe, as well as garlic salt and italian seasonings.

This is a great recipie! I did changed some things though, i cut the spinach so that I only used 5oz., I added a can of drained and chopped artichoke hearts to the spinach and ricotta mixtutre, and marinated the chicken in worstishire sauce to give it a little kick. Excellent recipie! Also, if your a vegeterian you can add firm, marinated tofu instead of chicken. Enjoy!

I used less ricotta (24oz) & it turned out fine. I added onion salt, garlic powder, & a touch of italian seasoning to the ricotta/spinach mixture... it'll really need it. Make sure the noodles on the top layer aren't bare in any areas, they'll dry out. We loved it & we'll make it again.

Made this yesterday night. My first time cooking anything of substance and it was easy to do. USE THE ROASTED GARLIC ALFREDO SAUCE and you won't need to add a lot of salt, pepper and seasonings. I also added mushrooms, broccoli, and onions so I would have more fillings in the lasagna. Turned out great. Took it out after 45 minutes and the top was a bit burnt, but that's my fault. Love it.

First . . . I used this recipe scaled to half (4 servings), but it made much more than 4 servings--it was actually 6-8.  That said, I thought this tasted rather bland, I ended up pouring tomato spaghetti sauce over the top of each portion--my husband and I both liked it much better that way.  This was easy and fast to make, but if I make this again I will definitely make tomato sauce a part of the recipe, possibly alternating layers of tomato sauce and alfredo.

this was the best lasagna I have ever had.  It's easy to make, and can feed a large number of people in a pot-luck setting.  My co-workers said it was the best they had tasted and ask for the recipe. I told them to get it here!!!

This was delicious!  My whole family loved it!  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper, then seared them in olive oil.  I removed them from the pan and deglazed it with a cup of white wine.  I added 3 chopped green onions and 5 cloves of crushed garlic.  I then sauteed some fresh spinach and threw all of that (except the chicken) into the ricotta cheese.  As for layering, I used the uncooked noodles and poured a cup of alfredo sauce in the bottom, then noodles, then ricotta/spinach mixture, then sliced chicken, then alfredo sauce, then italian cheese, then parm, repeat two times.  This will not fit in a 9x13 dish.  It is very rich and will feed a good sized family.  Thank you for sharing this Sybil!  I love it!

My 12 yr old daughter absolutely loves to help me prepare, assemble and eat this recipe.  She requests it every year on her Bday.  I suggest using leftover roaster chicken meat for a more flavorful recipe.

This is a good recipe. I added mushrooms to the spinach mixture, and onions to the chicken mixture, turned out very well. My advice for others...1. reduce the cooking time (especially those that found it dry), 2. if you reduce the cooking time reduce amount of alfredo sauce (or it will end up alfredo lasagna soup).

this is a wonderful recipe!  I follow it exactly and it turns out great.....one suggestion, do NOT use the no boil lasagna noodles, I used those the 3rd time I made this, and it came out very dry!  Guess the noodles absorbed the sauce.  Lesson learned!

This lasagna was delicious! I used "No Boil" noodles, so if you opt for the quick way make sure you use a bit of fettucini sauce for the bottom of the pan (before the first layer of noodles goes in) and save some for the last/top layer of noodles before you add the layer of cheese.

It was very very good. I did some changes though. I sauted bacon and onions and added that to the chicken. I used a mixture of Parmesan and Mozarella which was awesome on the top of the lasagna. Definetely recommend it! I'll give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.

I made this as written and then I read the reviews which said to add seasonings so I sprinkled some garlic powder to the top right after I put it in the oven.  After it was done it still needed a lot of seasonings to make it flavorful.  I don't think I will be making this again.  I was disappointed because my husband loves alfredo sauce much more than tomato sauce.  So be sure to add Italian seasoning and lots of garlic powder if you are going to make this.

This lasagna is a nice change from the regular tomato based lasagna.  I sauteed the chicken with onion and minced garlic and then seasoned it with salt and Italian seasoning.  I split it into two 8X8 pans and froze one for later.

I am not much of a cook and I have recently started frequenting this site to get ideas on how to do it....came across this recipe and thought it looked interesting to try for my very first lasagna...and I am glad I did! :)  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I took the advice of some others and put sauce on the bottom and top of the lasagna. It turned out perfectly...I mean, REALLY good!  My dinner guests couldn't believe I had never made lasagna and went on and on about how good it was!  I would totally recommend this to anyone!

Followed receipe exactly and found it bland and tasteless.  You really need to add a lot to this to make it palatable.  I was sorry I spent my time and money on this dish.

SO good. I made my own alfredo sauce and used dry curd cottage cheese instead of riccota. I also used a few cloves of garlic in the cottage cheese as well as my sauce. The out come was so good. My whoe family loved it.

Excellent recipe! It was a hit at our Christmas party this weekend. I actually made it with Ziti noodles to make it easier. I just boiled the Ziti, set it aside and then combined all of the other ingredients in a large bowl with the exception of about 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese.  I then mixed in the Ziti, put it all a bake dish and then topped with the rest of the mozzarella.  I also added some fresh sauteed garlic (I sauteed with the chicken pieces). I love garlic and felt like it wouldn't be complete without it! I'll make this again for sure!!

Made this meal for my fiance' for Valentines Day... and he LOVED it! This was actually my very first time baking a lasagna and I was a little bit nervous, but using this recipe was very easy and fool proof. 
The meal was delicious and I will certainly recommend.

Overall this was pretty good.  Somehow I only managed to buy 1 jar of alfredo sauce, so I ended up 1/2 ing the recipe, which turned out to be plenty for a family of 5...with leftovers!

This was the BEST lasagna I've ever made and eaten!  The only thing that I changed was the chicken, I used roasted red peppers in place of it.  It was just so amazing!  It was quick and easy to make also.  Good luck!

Great recipe! I used whole wheat lasagna noodles (and I never pre-cook them), Ragu Lite parmesean alfredo sauce and fat free ricotta. I always beat an egg and mix it in with the ricotta since I learned it helps make the ricotta not leak and gel better. I also added about a tbs. of fresh minced garlic, a tsp. of onion powder and a ton of fresh ground pepper to the egg before I mixed it in with the ricotta and spinach. I also didn't pre-cook the spinach which always works out just fine. BIL and SIL's boyfriend had seconds and everyone else cleaned their plates. No one knew it was a lightened up recipe. THANKS! =)

This turned out really good! Next time I will use homemade alfredo sauce (there's a great recipe on here for it) instead of the jar kind. I don't care for alfredo in the jar, but since homemade alfredo doesn't reheat well I will probably only make half the recipe.

I did not have ricotta or cottage cheese & it still turned out awesome! I followed a couple of reviews and mixed the Garlic Alfredo sauce in with the chicken & onions, reserving just a little for the bottom of the pan so the noodles wouldn't stick. Used lots of fresh ground pepper, adding it to the chicken. I also followed a few reviews who said it was 'blah' and needed 'marinara', so I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano used for two layers. Used fresh spinach and it turned out TASTY!

Simply delicious. This was my first lasagna ever, and it came out great. I did change a few things. I scaled down the recipe by half (but it still yielded about 8 servings). I added more chicken (about 4 chicken breasts), and I cooked the chicken i garlic, basil, onion, and low-sodium chicken broth. I made sure the chicken had good flavor to avoid the blandness that some reviewers described.  Then i shredded the chicken and mixed it with store-bought garlic alfredo sauce. After that I coated the bottom and sides of my baking tray with sauce and layered on no-boil pasta. I did 4 layers (chicken,pasta,ricotta mix, pasta), and in addition to the mozzarella also used shredded Parmesan. In the end the final product was just perfect; flavorful, and with the perfect balance of flavors.

Although there was nothing wrong with this recipe, it just didn't suit our tastes. I even cooked my chicken chunks with garlic and onion as one reviewer recommend it was just kinda okay. Nothing to write home about.

Easy and very good! I seasoned the chicken welll and once it was done I poured one can of the alfredo sauce over the chicken and let it simmer while the noodles boiled. I would also only use half box of the noodles because I had a lot extra that I had to throw out

I really liked this recipe, but I also used only one can of alfredo sauce and maybe a little less on the ricotta with the spinach.  I cannot have salt so to me it wasn't too bland.  My kids enjoyed it so I will be making this more often.

This was a really good dish.  I did a half and half lasagna since my boys prefer brocolli.  I just steamed some brocolli and chopped it up and then mixed it with 15 oz. of ricotta cheese.  I mixed the spinach with 15 oz. of ricotta cheese in another bowl and then layered one side with the broc. mix and the other with spinach.  It turned out great!

I made slight modifications to this recipe which I believe improved the flavours. I always use organic products when possible and since I find that the most flavourful part of the chicken is the thighs I mixed these with the chicken breasts, half and half, and I also see no need to cook organic spinach before assembling. I also added a couple of spring onions (not green onions) and bottomed the pan with a parsley paste. Turned out excellent.

Wonderful! We're picky with lasagna and this was superb. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the layering technique. As others suggested, 1) sauce, 2) noodles, 3) chicken/sauce mixture, 4) ricotta, 5) spinach. Repeat until chicken/sauce mixture is gone, then all the the mozzarella on top. It was a hit! Thanks!

This was an excellent base recipe. I had to cut the ricotta cheese amount in half because I felt like it was way too much. I added slices of baby bella mushrooms and sprinkled garlic salt over a few layers. I also put some Alfredo sauce (I used Classico's new "roasted poblano" sauce, which gave the dish a nice kick) on top of the last layer of lasagna noodles before adding the cheese. It is now boyfriend and roommate approved; they could not express enough how much they enjoyed this. Next time I think I'll use less chicken or maybe replace it with some Italian sausage.

Very tasty, but heavy.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and liked it better.  Divided the recipe into two 8x8 square pans and froze one for a later dinner.

We loved this and I will fix this again!! What i would change for sure is that I would use no bake lasagna noodles. And maybe I would try shredding the chicken. and maybe use a little more spinach, ricotta and mozzarella cheese (i love cheesey lasagna).

I only made half because it was for just 2 people. However, I used 2 chicken breasts. I had to add garlic powder and onion powder because I found it too bland. I also added sauteed minced garlic and chopped onions to the chicken mixture. With more seasonings, the recipe is perfect. Served with a ceasar salad and slices of french baguettes (from this site)

Fantastic! I modified it a bit to cut calories and it was still the best lasagna I've ever had. I added broccoli and mushrooms. I used 1.5 cups of cottage cheese instead of the ricotta. I used much less motz and only 1.5 jar of sauce. That saves a bunch a calories but was still ever tastey. I will make this again at Christmas dinner for sure.

This was a really nice alternative from traditional lasagna.  I made a few minor changes:  added scallions and frozen chopped broccoli to the spinach mixture, used roasted garlic alfredo sauce, and like everyone else put a layer of the Alfredo sauce on the bottom of my pan before adding the no boil lasagna noodles.

This was a great alternative to tomato based lasagna but I changed a few things. I used canned spinach and only 1/2 can. I also sauteed a medium diced onion, 5 cloves of garlic and added to the chicken and sauce along with a handful of basil. It works great if you layer 1/2 chicken and alfredo mixture, 3 noodles, mozzarella cheese and ricotta mixture, then repeat. Add lots of seasonings otherwise it's a little bland.

This is amazing! I made it for 1.1.13. This meal is so elegant that it can be served for any special occasion or holiday. I make my own Alfredo using this recipe.

It was a lot easier to make than I thought. I added a tablespoon of diced jalapeno to the ricotta mixture, but next time I will add more next time because this addition was just what my family loves.

This was awesome! As usual, whenever I cook with spinach, I add nutmeg [this time 1 tsp]. I also added 2 tsp oregano to the spinach/ricotta mix. The big risk with this dish is overstuffing yourself- it was hard to stop eating!

This is soooo good!  I can't keep myself from adding this and that to a recipe, so I, too, added about 1/2 onion and garlic to the chicken while it was cooking.  I only had 1 pint of ricotta so I added a pint of cottage cheese to make up the difference, and spiced that mixture up with some dried parmesan cheese and a little garlic powder and a smidgen of Italian seasoning.  I also sustituted broccoli for the spinach, as we're not spinach lovers. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Thank you for this conscise, clear, and easy recipe Amanda. I have already used it twice in the span of two weeks. First for my Dad's birthday, and again 6 days later for a school pot-luck party. My family absolutely loved it, and my colleagues were amazed that I brought such a seemingly intricate dish. I can't think of a better recommendation than THAT. Thanks.

This was FANTASTIC!  Because I'm just cooking for 2 people, I made this recipe in 3 loaf pans and froze 2 of them.  The only change I made was I added a can of diced tomatoes and some Italian seasoning to the ricotta and spinach mixture for color and taste.  So good - thanks for this recipe!

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this recipe. I did as other users suggested and mixed all the chicken with the alfredo sauce. I put a little sauce at the bottom, then went noodles, sauce mixture, cheese, ricotta mixture, repeat.  I also used chopped broccoli instead of spinach. Will definitely make again.

This is so good, even my kids like it! I saute the chicken in onion and garlic and add mushrooms to the sauce. I have also made this with linguine noodles once when I was out of lasagna noodles, and it was just as good. Definitely a keeper in my book.

Delicious!  I took some other reviewers' advice and made a few modifications: I layered it like traditional lasagna; used a bit less spinach, and added a can of drained chopped artichokes.  The family loved it, and the leftovers the next day were even better!

My husband and brother-in-law liked this, but for me, it seemed to lack something...in the seasoning department maybe.  If you're lactose intolerant, don't forget your lactaid like I did, if you're going to eat this....very cheesy :)

Made this for dinner tonight and my family and I loved it!! I did add some garlic,pepper and a few other things to the ricotta and used one jar alfredo and one jar garlic parm. I think that that helped with the blandness others on here wrote about.

Easy to make and very delicious. I found it easier to cook the noodles and chicken beforehand and only use the oven to make the cheese melt/bubble.

I cut the recipe in half. It still fit large, rectangular casserole dish.  The frozen spinach is a little strong, so use sparingly and ensure even distribution by adding it to the sauce as recommended.  For the top layer, I added some Chedder into the Mozzarella for color, and that ended up being the best tasting layer. I thought Chedder complimented the spinach, so next time, I will use mix of Chedder + Mozzarella throughout.

Yum! Super easy. I added sauteed onions and garlic to the chicken and alfredo sauce. Stuck it under the broiler for a minute or so to brown the top. Next time I might sub broccoli instead of spinach.

The first time I made this lasagna was when I was still dating my (now) husband and he told me it was his favorite meal that I'd made for him. Now that we're married, I make it as often as I can. Beware - it makes a LOT, but it's perfect for a large family or dinner party or leftovers. I usually saute my chicken with chopped onions and garlic to give it flavor. It also helps the overall flavor to salt/pepper between each layer, not just the top layer. The recipe says it takes 1.5 hours. But because of all the prep work, it usually takes me 2.5 hours.

I thought this turned out really good. I made it for a house of 16 guys and it was recieved very well.  My one suggestion would be using less ricotta. , it was just a bit too heavy.

This recipe was so good. My husband doesn't care for red sauce so this was perfect.  I did use garlic alredo sauce and I sauteed the chicken in garlic to add flavor.  Everyone loved this dish.

This is so easy to make and takes very little time to prepare.  I fixed it for a group of nine adults and they raved about it on and on.  An owner of a bed and breakfast was one of my guests and she wanted the recipe.  I did follow the recommendations from others to dress this up a bit with sauted onions, sliced mushrooms and garlic. I would give this five stars and will cook it again and again.

I made this exactly as directed. Had high hopes for it, but was not impressed. I still gave it 3 stars because I think maybe we just aren't fans of ricotta cheese, and this called for a lot of it. We liked layers one and three, but not the middle with the ricotta and spinach. I may make again, but mix the spinach with something other than the ricotta? I don't know...Was easy to make, looked and smelled great, other than that, though!

This was a HUGE hit! Made it last night and everyone loved it- even the non-spinach lovers. I added more chicken than the recipe called for, instead of salt and pepper i put a lot of garlic salt on the chicken layer, and next time i'm going to saute garlic and mushrooms and put it in this! Everyone said "Please make it again!" This is going in my "bring a covered dish" folder!

I loved this but, unfortunatly my husband is a fan of the traditional meat and red sauce lasagna. My sister liked it but, I probably will not make again since the hubby wasn't crazy about it. It is very good though. :(

I made this lasagna and I was not impressed.  It was rather bland and a little too simple for my liking.  It needs more to it.  I may attempt a lasagna Alfredo again in the future,  but with defintely be kicking it up.  I think fresh mushroom, zucchini, broccoli, and perhaps even some eggplant may do this much needed justice.  Also,  add some seasonings,  as this lasagna recipe is lacking taste.

Pretty good.  I sauteed onion and garlic and added it to the chicken mixture.  Cooked fresh spinach and covered with foil for the majority of the baking and quickly broiled at end to get crisp cheese topping.  It was good.  I like the idea of adding tomatoes . . .maybe I'll try it as a garnish next time.

I had tons of leftovers after i made this meal.  My parents are from Italy and i am used to eating realy good italian food.  We make our sauce homemade and never store bought. Maybey thats why it didn't work for us.

I made this recipe for 100 at a church banquet and everyone loved it.  Every single plate came back empty.  I used no-boil lasagna, sauteed the chicken with minced garlic and chopped fresh mushrooms, and added italian seasoning to the ricotta cheese.  It freezes well, too.  You will want to make this again and again.

YUM! A bit labor intentsive but worth it! I did follow the layering as directed. I used the Quick & Easy Alfredo Sauce (which I LOVE!!!!) from this site to save $$. Also, I subbed turkey for the chicken and added garlic powder and italian seasonings to the ricotta/spinach mixture. I had extra stuff so I actually made an extra small pan and froze it. I just pulled it out of the freezer this week (1 month later). It was a bit dry but more alfredo sauce cured that. I served this with a caesar salad and garlic bread. Good for company b/c can be made ahead.

We liked this dish.  I made a few changes though~to the alfredo sauce I added some garlic, onion and onion powder.  It really needs this or it would be very bland.  Also I put salt and pepper on top as the recipe said.  Next time I will mix this in. As I was assembling the dish, I realized I hadn't cooked enough noodles so I only added two layers and I'm glad that happened.  With only two of us eating, it made a smaller dish (I had already halved the recipe).  Next time I think I will add a little more spinach.

If I could give more stars, I would! This was a delcious meal, and a nice change from the traditional red sauce lasagnas. I only made a half batch in an 8x8 pan, as there are only my husband and me, but I think I will make this again next week! It's one of those dishes that, even though there are only two of us, generally guaranteeing leftovers for at least a few days, there is hardly even enough left for us to have it for dinner again tonight. Thanks for the recipe, Sybil!

I cooked it last night for tea and my family loved it, will certainly be cooking it again.
I put lots of grated Parmesan cheese on the top with the Mozzarella.
Just amended it to the UK format.

Served this at a big family dinner and everyone loved it. I though it was a little dry and will add more sauce next time. I also thought it was a little bland but am not quite sure what to do about it. I used the traditional lasagna layering technique as suggested by another reviwer.

This is good. It just needs more seasoning. It's a little bland when you taste the ricotta. Next time I will mix it with an egg and some seasonings like others have done.

If I could give it more stars I would. My husband and I thought is was DELICIOUS. The only thing I will change next time is to put maybe a little more chicken in it. I also put sauce on the bottom to keep the noodles from sticking.

Easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe to serve at a family dinner and everbody LOVED it! I used 'ready to bake' noodles so didn't have to worry about cooking them before assembly. I also added chopped onion and garlic to the spinach mixture to give it some extra flavouring. Will definitely be making this again.

I loved this twist on your average lasagna.  I followed the recipe precisely the first time and really liked it.  It was delicious, but a touch bland for our taste.  Since then, I've started adding an onion, garlic clove and some Cajun seasoning.  That was enough of a kick to make this a keeper at our house.

the original recipe was a little bland for my husband and I, so the next time i made it i tweaked it a little. I did away with the ricotta all together, and mixed the spinage with marinara sauce, crushed red pepper, garlic salt and pepper. also added freshly chopped onion and garlic to the alfredo mix, along with freshly shredded parmasan cheese. The mix of all the cheeses and red and white sauces complimented eachother very well, and made for a LOT more flavor.

There were only two pieces of this left after my husband and four kids devoured it! True comfort food. I used no bake lasagna noodles and covered the dish tightly with foil sprayed with non-stick spray. I had to cook it longer to be sure the noodles were done but it was wonderful and easy. Also I had cottage cheese on hand so I used that...no difference in taste and a lot cheaper! Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Very good.  I used 1 pint ricotta and 1 pint cottage cheese and precooked frozen chicken pieces.  Will only make for special occasions as it is time consuming and has way too many calories (which is why I gave it only 3 stars).  My guests liked it.

The flavor was bland.  I think it needs something a bit tart or zingy - like very dry white wine or something in the chicken / Alfredo layer.    I believe I'll keep searching.

OMG, this was soooo good! I only made half a recipe of it, because I wasn't sure if the family would like it. One of two kids ate it without complaint and the hubby seemed to like it too, even though he's more of a meat lasagna kinda guy. I baked it 50 minutes, which was probably a little too long as the top was browner than it should have been, but not inedible. Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe this weekend and it was fantastic!  I didn't add the chicken because of our resident vegetarian so I substituted sauteed onions and artichoke hearts and it was perfect!  Definitely a keeper and I'll make it again soon!

I followed the advice of others, I used the roasted garlic alfredo sauce and added onions, mushrooms, garlic and italian seasoning to the spinich mix.  It looked great and tasted even better!  It made enough for plenty of leftovers too.

The kids really liked it, and even asked that I make it again sometime! High praise, indeed. I used half jarred light alfredo sauce and half homemade low-fat alfredo sauce, as well as part skim ricotta and part skim mozzarella. When I make it again, I think I'll add minced onions, carrots, and red bell peppers to the spinach mixture and I may leave out the chicken.

It is a great idea, but a bit weak on flavor. Add 1 cup of onions and a bit more salt and pepper! Also, I used whole wheat lasagna noodles.

Delicious.....but the calorie count for a portion is more than half of one's daily intake.  Will try to 'healthify' it.

I have to admit I did forgot to buy the ricotta cheese, so I made it without the ricotta.Still tasted great.

This lasagna was a huge hit with my family.  I know I will be making it again.  To avoid the heavy texture of 100% ricotta, I used 1/2 cottage cheese which made for a lighter, moister layer.  Yummy!

Very good!!! Very filling...I made my own Alfredo sauce instead of using a jar...it did not add that much prep time and I feel it made a better product.

I'm not a big fan of white sauces, but wanted to try this out. I added a drained can of diced tomatoes to the chicken mixture, some garlic "juice" (from a jar of minced) - hubby happily went back for seconds. I like someone's post about trying a "fancier flavored" alfredo sauce to liven it up a bit, but hubby loved it just as it is!

I really butchered this recipe wih fantastic results. I know most people don't like reading these types of reviews, but my modifications made a tasty and fresh lasagna. 0 boxed lasagna noodles, 0 jarred sauces, and fresh swiss chard from the garden. 1) I made 7 large lasagna noodles using "Grandma's Butter Noodles" off AR. 2) I made my own Alfredo Sauce using the sauce in "To Die For Fettuccine Alfredo" also from AR. 3) I didn't use spinach and used blanched fresh garden swiss chard. 4) Made 2 lasagnas because 1 pan couldn't hold everything. 5) I did the layers: Sauce, noodle, chiken/sauce, noodle, mozzarella cheese, noodle, swiss chard/ricotta, noodle. The 2nd pan was the same minus the top lasagna noodle because I only made 7. Bake covered for 50 minutes, take foil off and sprinkle some mozzarella cheese. Bake until cheese is browned. My husband's CO ate with us and was quite impressed. He told my husband, "Best lasagna he has ever had."

Very yummy!  My changes: I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper and then sauteed in a pan. I substituted one bottle of alfredo sauce with 1 small bottle of Rao's marinara sauce, which I drizzled over the spinach mixture and on the top noodle layer. I used 1/2 whole wheat noodles and alternated between white and wheat when laying down the noodles. I also used 1 pint whole milk ricotta and 3/4 of a small container of reduced fat cottage cheese. I added a sprinkle of Italian seasoning to the ricotta mix / cottage cheese / spinach mixture and whisked in an egg. This was so good and a little less indulgent. I don't believe I used even 3 cups of moz. cheese. This is definitely going into the "rotation"!

This recipe is amazing. My husband was not sure about the spinach, but now he insists that I only make this kind of lasagna from now on. It's a big hit with the neighbors. I cook the chicken with some Montreal chicken seasoning and use jalapeño cheddar cheese instead. Adds a bit of a kick.

This was quite good! I opted to make the alfredo sauce from scratch since I haven't found a canned variety that satisfies. I also added some gently-sauteed white onions to the spinach mixture and gently dusted each layer of mozzarella with italian-flavored bread crumbs. I only ended up needing half of a 16oz box of noodles, and 50 mins slightly burnt the top cheese. I would go 45 min tops with this recipe.

This was great...the hubby and kids loved it!  I didn't have ricotta so I substituted with cottage cheese.  We like dark meat so I used chicken thighs, and I deleted the salt and pepper.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks!

I used this recipe as the base to my lasagna and then added to it.  The day before I baked the chicken breasts in a pesto sauce.  Then the day of, shredded in a processor, sauted garlic, onions and green pepper, added chicken then used the jar sauces. Used some seasonings and added some white wine to give the sauce a nice taste. I used the garlic sauce and the sundried tomato, and then to the empty jars I added some water to get the last bit of sauce and to thin it out a bit.  I used cream cheese instead of ricotta.  By reading all the reviews, I knew exactly what to do to make my lasagna perfect.  Will use this recipe again, and may try to make it a seafood lasagna one day. I served this with my red lasagna, and this was by far the favorite!

I thought this recipe was great. I followed the direction except when I cooked the chicked I flavor it with a 1/2 onion and some garlic. I also put about a tablespoon of Italion seasoning in the Ricotta. I will make this again for sure

I added sun-dried tomatoes to the chicken mixture and added garlic, parsley, salt and pepper and some parmesan cheese to the ricotta. Omitted the spinach but added chopped broccoli to the layer with ricotta.  It was a hit at a ladies function!

i tried this recipe and it is very good.  the only thing i will do different the next time is add a little alfredo sauce to the top layer of noodles as they dried out and became a bit crispy when cooking.

The only thing I would do different would be add a layer of alfredo sauce before the first layer of noodles.  My bottom layer was crisp.

I must start off by saying that I did make some changes. I used homemade alfredo sauce using a quick and easy recipe from this site.  I was a little short of chicken, so I added some sliced mushrooms to bulk it up a bit.  I was out of ricotta, so I substituted cottage cheese. Other than those substitutions, recipe remained the same. Hubby loved it (he even had leftovers for breakfast the next day!) and said I could make this anytime I want and he'll be happy.

Really tasty but VERY rich. I made a smaller portion in an 8x8 Pyrex using: 15oz ricotta, 10oz spinach (sautéed in a little olive oil), 1c mozzarella, 1/3c fresh grated Parmesan and s&p all mixed together for the filling. I sautéed 2 chicken breast in olive oil, then cooled and sliced them and also made my own Alfredo sauce (2 tablespoon butter, 2 tbslp flour to make a roux, then added 1c half & half and 1c milk. Once warmed through, added 8oz fresh grated Parmesan, salt & pepper) spooned enough sauce into the baking dish to cover the bottom, added a layer of noodles, half the ricotta/spinach mixture, then covered with sauce. Added another layer of noodles, remaining spinach mixture, the chicken slices, and covered the chicken with sauce. Finally, 1 last layer of noodles, sauce, and then covered with 1c of mozzarella. Placed on a cookie sheet and baked, uncovered, for 50 minutes. My husband, who doesn't care for spinach, had 2 helpings as did our son, who went on to ask what he'd have to do in order to get me to make this on a regular basis. It was absolutely delicious, but I don't even want to think of the fat and calories! Definitely a guilty pleasure and something I'd probably only make occasionally.

I made this but added my own style to it instead, I shredded my chicken so that is was in every bite and i used broccoli and spinach, I used a mixture of mozzarella, parmesean,and provolone cheeses and then after it was done, I sauteed garlic, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes and used that as a garnish...yummy...

My entire family of 5 LOVED this recipe from ages 1 to 43 !! The only thing I did different was use precooked pasta and added some garlic salt and pepper to the top layer of mozzarella. PERFECT!!!

I was so excited to make this but it just turned out very bland. It was really just too cheesy. The chicken needed flavor, and maybe more veggies, garlic, and spices! Hopefully I can try it again some time with more flavoring. Also I used a slow cooker with no boil noodles- set on low for 4-6 hours.

This was awesome!  I followed the recipe, with the exception of layering it a bit differently.  It was so flavorful!  I will definitely make this again with no changes!

Very rich and very good!  I was lazy and mixed all ingredients (save the noodles) together, also used oven-ready noodles.  Changes: skipped the mushroom but added roasted red peppers (asparagus would have been great too), used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, added onion and garlic flakes.  Can be pricey but if you make your own Alfredo sauce and use cottage cheese then it save you a bit.  Thanks so much to the chef!

Really tasty.  Love the spinach in it.  I goofed and bought oven ready lasagne noodles by mistake and used them in the recipe, which means I didn't have to boil them and then add them, but just used them dry.  By adding a 1/2 cup of water to the sauce I got a great recipe.  Thanks so much.

My family loved this!  I changed some things.  I did it in layers like lasagna.  First I put down some sauce, then noodles, then ricotta/spinach layer (I added one egg to this), then a layer of sauce and chicken, and last, shredded cheese.  I repeated this one more time.  Then the top is was a layer of noodles, sauce, and cheese.  Every piece was gone.

This was so easy to make.  I used the lasagna noodles that don't have to be cooked ahead.  I did use one whole box of spinach. I also down sized the whole thing as it was just for me. I will make this again .

I found this recipe to be very bland. Next time I'll try adding minced garlic, more salt, more chicken, and sauteed onions.  I also didn't need the whole box of noodles.

Made it for the first time at the firehouse tonight (daring and semi-stupid) but it turned out delicous.  All of my crew had nothing but great things to say and were left with no room in their bellies, which better be the case around here.  Also quite easy to make, THANKS!

This recipe rocks! I made the whole recipe but divided into 2 pans, one for dinner & one for the freezer. The only thing I changed was to add Italian seasoning to the ricotta mixture & layer it according to the previous posters. Awesome! This one's a definite keeper!

I LOVED this recipe!  The whole family LOVED it!  I did not have the size pan this recipe called for so I baked it in a really deep corningware dish (about 10 x 10 & 5" deep)  I still had awesome results!  Im not great at making Italian food (I ROCK at Mexican food lol) this was SO good and easy to follow but if you have 3 people or less in your family your feeding, I would cut the recipe if you dont have leftover lovers, even though we enjoyed the leftovers for 2 days! This was GREAT!

Loved this recipe, it is company worthy. Took the advice of a few others and made my own Alfredo sauce. Also used Broccoli as suggested instead of spinach. It really does need a deeper pan to get all the layers together!!! A keeper for sure.

I thought this was excellent!  We sauteed the chicken in a butter/garlic combo and just made a white-parmesan roux from scratch (instead of jarred alfredo sauce).  My family loved it!  Added some sauteed red onion for color, didn't have spinach so we used mangold and mixed up the cheeses a bit - little cheddar, parmesan, gouda, etc. Thanks for sharing!

Once seeing this recipe, I HAD to try it. This recipe is VERY substitute friendly: I added minced garlic, mushrooms, and aged parmesan cheese to the spinach to add more flavor to the layers. To cut down on preperation I use no bake lasagna, and it works just fine. I add more chicken to my lasagna and mix it into all the sauce. Once finished, I serve with tomato sauce on top. Everyone loves it and always ask the next time I'm making it!

Excellent recipe, my family loved it.  However, I did made one change.  Because I was serving this along with another chicken dish, I substituted the chicken with sage sausage.  The exchange worked very well.  Next time, I plan to prepare my own alfredo sauce to take it to the next level!  Enjoy.

very good! I cut the recipe in half and it still made about 6 servings! I also used no boil noodles and added garlic, onions, mushrooms and a little red pepper to the spinach, I used fresh since that's all I had. Next time I will put more of the mozzerella in the lasagna instead of on top, it got kinda crunchy! I also added extra sauce on the bottom before assembling and on top after the last noodle layer.

Very good, all I changed was I diced raw chicken and sauteed it in a pan with evo and 1/2 way through added 2 cloves of garlic and half an onion (both chopped fine)and finished cooking the chicken. Added 1 jar sauce to chicken. Covered bottom of 9X13 with 1/2 the other jar and after assembled topped with rest of sauce. Cover with foil bake 50 min then remove foil and bek 10 more minutes. Yummy. Also sprinkled parm cheese and fresh ground black pepper on to each layer.

We thought this lasagna was so-so. I added sauteed onions, mushrooms and garlic and still the taste was pretty blend. May be the classic parmesan sauce was to blame for this. Next time I might add the garlic parmesan sauce or buy a better parmesan cheese sauce. Not sure if I would make this lasagna again.

This was really good!!!I got great compliments on this dish- I halfed the recipe and it was still enough to feed me, my husband, daughter, and 1 guest, so I will probably continue to do this the next time unless I make it for a holiday or something---anyway very yummy...you should try this!!

This recipe was ok, I think it's because I'm not a big fan of ricotta cheese. It made a lot and was kind of dry. I will probably not make again.

The idea of this recipe seemed great. However the taste was dissapointing. First, it was too salty. The mixture was dry. The next time, I will follow other reviews and add chicken to the mixture. Also, I think adding a little alfredo to the ricotta mix might be good. I will make again, but not following the recipe exactly. Otherwise you are in for a salty, dry lasagna roll up.

This was delicious!  Very rich and filling.  I did make a few changes.  I sauteed the spinach in olive oil and garlic and I used homemade alfredo sauce which is so easy and much better than that jarred stuff.  I also used less mozzarella then the recipe called for.

I thought this was good, and my husband who requested it said it wasn't quite what he was looking for.  The recipe calls for 2 jars alfredo sauce but has instructions to use only one and a half.  If I make it again, I will use only one jar and use 2/3 with the chicken and 1/3 with the spinach. Also, I am not a great ricotta fan so I only used one container of it instead of 2, and it was plenty.  Any more ingredients and my lasagna dish would have overflowed.

Made this Lasagna for the Holidays with regular Lasagna. The Alfedo one was the first to go! Every one wanted the recipe....I use fresh pasta and added onions and mushrooms when cooking the cut up chicken. I Will make it again. Nan

Best. Recipe. Ever!  This was such a hit.  Time consuming, but worth it for a "special" occasion as is very different and impressive.  

I cooked the chicken with salt, pepper, and a bit of chopped onion and garlic.  Also used the roasted garlic alfredo sauce per another reviewer's suggestion.  When I put it together was concerned because the garlic was so strong, but after baking - was perfect!!  Also lightly covered the bottom with the sauce.  Great to make ahead and pop in the oven.

Awesome recipe! I made this for my family when I was home from school and everyone lobed it! I made the alfredo sauce from scratch though and am glad I made that switch. There is an excellent recipe on here for alfredo sauce under Quck and Easy Alfredo Sauce. Enjoy!

This was great! Instead of using commercial Alfredo sauce I used the recipe from "Fettuccini Alfredo I" and I added some broccoli and sliced mushrooms to the sauce.

Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing the idea. I wanted to cook for a friend who just had a baby and needed a good recipe that didn't have tomatoes, garlic, and other stuff. So based on my options, I tried this recipe out. It worked out great. I cooked the chicken, but added some spices for flavor, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  I used canned spinach (and drained it) due to limited time. I followed another user's recommendation and tossed it all together (alfredo, chicken and spinach) and layered mozz cheese from there. Tossed some parmesean on top. Omitted ricotta cheese b/c I don't like it... If you don't mind a green looking mixture, then you'll be fine. It was enjoyed by everyone!

I love this dish!!! I have been making this for about a year now and everyone that tastes it loves it.  I sometimes add sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms.  I also add sun-dried pesto to the alfredo sauce.  It is always a hit either at home, work, or dinner with friends.

I put together day before & used no boil noodles.  Refrigerated overnight & baked next day. It was really good. Plan to make again in few days.  This cut down baking time to about 50 min. I also used a Lawry Salt rub on chicken breasts.  Going to try it with shrimp instead of chicken.

Fantastic recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used the roasted garlic alfredo sauce and it really came out amazing. I also added extra crushed garlic. This really tasted like something you would order in a restaurant. It was a big hit in my family. Thank you.

Made it last night and I loved it! Made some changes though. Like I added more chicken then it called for, I used two 22oz jars of Alfredo instead of the regular sized jars, and I used a different cheese. But it came out amazing and my entire family loved it.

I lost a bet with my fiance, so I had to make her a fancy dinner!  This was an excellent choice!  She loves lasagna, so I thought I'd find a recipe to put a spin on it.  It ended up feeding my parents and best friend as well!  They all loved it.  However, I personally may add some more sauce and chicken to the mixtures.  The sauce was pretty thin on the top.  Overall, pretty good!

We are not big on regular lasagna bc of the tomato sauce so we've often had store bought vegetarian lasagna alfredo. So i decided to try and make this bc it looked simple and easy. Made it and it was a hit. instead of spinach, i used zucchini, bc it was all i had. The first attempt wasn't as great bc it was more trial and error since i don't measure my ingredients, but the 2nd time i did it... it was delicious!!! My husband had almost 3 squares and requested that i make it like this every time! i will definitely be making more in future!! thanks so much for the recipe!!! no more store bought alfredo lasagna!!

This dish is simply AWESOME!! I made it for my family of 4, however; it can serve up to 8-10 servings depending on the size. Every time I make this, there is Always NONE left over for the next day. However; I did make a few changes to the ingredients. I added basil, garlic powder, and Italian Seasoning to the ricotta cheese & spinach mixture before adding the layers of lasagna. Also, toward the end of baking the dish, I added Italian Seasoning and Basil for extra flavor. Without these spices, the lasagna was rather bland, so I would definitely recommend using a few extra spices to pep up the Flavor. 
Overall . . . . . DELICIOUS!

Ok, this smells wonderful! Mixed the Classico 4 cheese alfredo sauce with a cup of cottage cheese(didn't have ricotta)added spinach, sautéed onions and red peppers, some garlic and some pesto sauce. Layered noodles, sauce mix, chicken and mozzarella. Can't wait to try it!

Enjoyed this very much. Used slightly less mozzarella cheese, but other ingredients were the stated amounts.  I did use Barilla no-boil lasagna noodles, which are wonderful.  You do need to be sure the noodles are completely covered with sauce so they don't dry out during baking.  I also sauteed a shallot and some garlic with the chicken for added flavor, and added some of the usual herbs and spices we like.  I did add 2 eggs to the spinach/ricotta mixture, as I normally do that anyway.  Baked the first 25 min covered with foil to keep moist, then uncovered for the rest of the time.  Everyone loved it, and it makes a ton,so we even had leftovers.  Excellent recipe.

I have made this a number of times but tend to add and change a little.  Have added in sautéed mushrooms and used roasted red pepper Alfredo, sometimes also using roasted red peppers as well.  Have also mixed in some Pepper  Jack cheese with the mozzarella for a bit of zing. It's definitely a great recipe and one that is always very popular. We just like it with a little added spice.

This was amazing!  My family usually never comes back with this positive of a response...they all have completely different tastes.  But, this dinner was a HUGE success!

To the chicken mixture I added 1 c. fat free sour cream to both lighten the fat content and to make it VERY moist, per my family's preference.  I also added in 1/2 cup of julienned fresh carrots and 1/2 cup chopped fresh broccoli to the chicken mixture.  On the top, I very lightly sprinkled some shredded cheddar for extra color.

Thank you for sharing this!  We can no longer get the white chicken veggie lasagna by stoufers around here, so this helped make up for it.

This was a really good change from the usual lasagna.  I only gave it 4 stars, but I was debating 5.  I admit, I did deviate a bit.  I chopped broccoli and carrots very fine and added along with some spinach to the ricotta.  I only used 15 oz of ricotta...I don't know if that's less than called for, but I expect it is.  I used the roasted garlic alfredo.  I used 2 breasts and 2 thighs, just baked plain, and added a bit of dried onion flakes, oregano and basil to the sauce.  I made a 7 x 10 pan and an 8 x 8 pan and they were FULL.  I don't know how this would ever fit in a 9 x 13.  I did layer it like normal lasagna, first pasta, then chicken/sauce, then ricotta/veggies, then mozzarella, then repeat.  I ran out of chicken/sauce and opened a 3rd jar of alfredo to put on the top of the final noodle layer.  I'm certain that if I'd followed the recipe exactly, I would have thought it had too much spinach.  All in all, it was really good and I'll likely do something similar again.  Thanks!

I loved the concept of this recipe but I knew from long experience that you need to:(A)butter baking dish (B)put some sauce in bottom of baking dish when making a lasagna. 
I used it like this: 1/4 jar on bottom and 1/4 on top layer of noodles before adding final 2 cups of cheese.
I put a box of frozen chopped spinach in a bowl and nuked for 6 minutes on high. I added a tiny amount of lemon juice to spinach plus salt and peeper plus minced dried onion.  I added garlic powder, onion powder to ricotta. Then mixed together.
I covered it with non stick alum foil for first 30 minutes because the top layer of noodles dried out too much. It browns up nicely in the remaining 30 minutes.
Make sure you let it set for 15 or so minutes - like any lasagna or casserole.
Absolutely delicious comfort, family, church, special guest meal.

I changed a few things (used the recipe as a starting point) which many find annoying, but I'm reviewing for my future reference.  First, I shredded the chicken and mixed it with 1 1/2 jars of Ragu light parm alfredo, adding a small can of drained mushrooms and 1 tbs ital seasoning. I sauteed the spin with garlic, onions and shredded carrot, then mixed with the whole amt of ricotta.  Also, I put 1/4 of remaining jarred sauce on bottom of pan first.  I did not use all the noodles, I wasted 6 not using them, which sort of annoys me, so making a note of that next time. Anyway...amazing!

I followed several of the previous commenters tips: used oven ready noodles, used garlic alfredo sauce, mixed my meat into the alfredo (used leftover turkey), put a layer of alfredo on bottom of pan, added a can of garlic and onion diced tomatoes (undrained) to the alfredo, added onion and garlic powder, and green onions to alfredo mixture, used slightly less spinach than listed in the ricotta mixture, added spices to the ricotta as well, and added 2 eggs (1 egg per pint like in my traditional lasagna). The noodles came out perfect and the dish was not dry and held its shape while serving. The family declared it delicious and said I can add it to my regular rotaion. I might use slightly less ricotta next time which is unusual for me because I LOVE cheese! Either that or grate some carrot and zuccini into that layer to mix up the flavor. Over all the recipie was a great starting point for my meal!

Delicious!  I made this tonight for my picky husband and several friends.  Everyone LOVED it and went back for seconds.  I grilled my chicken with some onion, garlic, and paprika to season it, and then added all of that to my mixture.  I also added the remaining half of the second jar of alfredo sauce to the top of the lasagna under the mozzarella cheese.  Wonderful!  It's already been requested again!

A-MAZ-ING.  This was my first lasagna, and it came out wonderfully!  I halved the recipe since I live alone, but I still used 2 chicken breast halves---I think next time I'll use 3.  I added some sliced mushrooms that I marinated and cooked with the chicken.  I also used a semi-homemade Alfredo sauce that I'd made and frozen a while back, which gave it a nice flavor; I would definitely recommend seasoning the chicken and sauce.  All in all, this is an excellent recipe that will definitely be a regular in my repertoire.  Thanks for sharing!

I should have added more spinach.  I only used one jar of alfredo sauce instead of 2.  A little salty for my taste, but everyone else loved it.  I would make it again, but like I said before, add more spinach.

I love pasta but tomato gravy is hard on my stomach. I was so happy when I found this recipe. I made it for my husband and myself. He loved it and I can eat lasagna again. I didn't have frozen spinach so I used fresh that I blanched and chopped . I didn't have chicken breast so I use Italian sausage and ground beef.

I made this last night for my family and everyone loved it!  I used the Barilla no-boil noodles and they worked perfectly!  I just sprayed the bottom of the dish with cooking spray.  Also, I only partially cooked the chicken in boiling water (4-5 mins) and then cut it into small bite-size pieces because I didn't want it to dry out, and this resulted in very tender chicken.  I will definitely be making this again, and I think it would work beautifully for company as it looks very pretty in the baking dish and on serving plates!  A definite winner!!!

Left out the chicken because I wanted this meatless. Turned out very good. I scaled the recipe down because I only had 5 lasagna noodles so I used two on the bottom and three for the next layer. I had to use cottage cheese becaue I forgot to save some of the ricotta cheese from a different recipe. Turned out great.

I made this in a large lasagna pan after reading other reviews. The pan was perfect, but I just wasn't thrilled with the taste (followed the recipe exactly). No raves from my husband, daughter or son-in-law unfortunately.

This was the best lasagna ever. I did not use all of the Ricotta and I put more alfredo because I love alfredo sauce. I used bertolli Alfredo sauce. Turned out great!!! My whole family loved it. Will make again, perhaps for Christmas dinner.

I would have to say that I have mixed reviews about this recipe.  It overall is a good concept for an innovative lasagna, but it is very time consuming and calorie rich.  The flavor was pretty good.  My husband LOVED the chicken in it (I wasn't crazy about it) and my 5 year old didn't really like it.  Also, there were too many layers to fit in my standard 13x9 and the resulting dish was HUGE and so heavy!  We'll probably eat some of the leftovers, but not all.  I think that I'll probably be using my traditinal spinach or meat lasagna more.

I made this for the first time the other night but left out the chicken since I'm a vegetarian. It was delicious.

A little too cheesy.   The kids didn't eat much, prefer tomatoes in their lasagne.  If I were to make it again, I would add another layer with the chicken because I had noodles left over.

Great recipe, simple to make and tastes great. I didn't have ricotta so I used cottage cheese.  Next time I will add diced tomatoes to the chicken layer.

I used this as a guide but added a lot more spinach, and used sliced Bella mushrooms instead of chicken. I cooked down the greens with the mushrooms, added pesto and garlic, and used low fat ricotta and Alfredo sauce. It turned out great, but the garlic and pesto were definitely needed as I think this would have been way too bland without it.

This was pretty good but makes a huge amount of food!  I might try to cut this back to make a 9 x 9.  I cooked some onion, garlic and mushrooms  with the spinach and that added more flavor.

I slow cooked marinated Italian seasoned chicken breast, and shredded them; and made my own Alfredo sauce using butter, heavy whipping cream, cream cheese, milk, minced garlic, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I cannot wait for it to come out of the oven and into my belly!!??

Delicious! And a great alternative to regular lasagna. Now, I never use jar alfredo. I used a double batch of the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" from this app. Very tasty. I pretty much followed the recipe, except I added some fresh chopped basil and oregano to the diced chicken for extra flavor. And I drizzled some alfredo sauce on the bottom of the pan before layering the noodles. I will be making this again.

This was a wonderful surprise!  I made this for my family on Christmas Eve and everyone loved it!  I used four chicken breasts and as others suggested, I used three jars of roasted garlic alfredo sauce.  It was just as good reheated the next day.

EXCELLENT!!  Instead of chicken breasts, we grilled up skinless chicken thighs which made it more flavorful.  Mario has a good alfredo sauce.

Made this last night after seeing it in the magazine. Few minor changes...used fewer noodles, used fresh spinach instead of frozen, shredded chicken instead of diced  and added some nutmeg. It was delicious! Hubby okayed it for the "keepers" file!

Best lasagne ever.  I found the recipe in the Fall 2017 issue of the Allrecipes magazine and the printed version only called for half the mozarella (2 cups) and ricotta (1 pint) cheeses.  I used a 9x13 pan and only ended up needing 9 lasagne noodles. I grilled the chicken breasts, mixed all of the alfredo sauce with the chicken and spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking as another reviewer suggested. I also added about a quarter cup of diced sweet onion to the spinach/garlic/ricotta mixture.  I did one layer of noodles (3), spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, then 1/3 of of the chicken/alfredo mixture, then 1/3 of the mozarella with a little bit of shredded parmesan.  For a little extra flavor, I spread about a tablespoon of fresh chopped oregano and then layered fresh basil leaves from my garden, about one leaf per piece.  The herbs added a much richer flavor and I dont think the dish would've been nearly as good without them.  I then did another layer of noodles (3), 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, 1/3 of the chicken/alfredo mixture, 1/3 of the mozarella & parmesan.  I repeated with 3 more noodles and the remainders of the 2 mixtures and cheese.  I topped with some fresh grated parmesan and baked for about an hour at 350.  For a side, I buttered and toasted slices of Italian bread, then scraped each side with a fresh clove of garlic. Absolutely delicious!  I will definitely make this dish again!

I loved how easy it was to make but I have to take off a star for being a little on the bland side.  I did add some Italian seasoning but even that didn't help.  I will add more to it next time.

My husband does NOT like spinach, but he loved this recipe!!  I actually used the homemade Alfredo recipe from Allrecipes and it was delicious!  However, I should have made a double batch of the sauce, as I had very little left to spread over the top.  I also would add a pinch more salt, as it came out a tad bit bland.  Other than that, it was great!

Was pretty good. Sometimes the spinach flavor was too overpowering. I used Paul Newman's Alfredo, I think this recipe's tastiness depends a lot on what jarred alfredo you use. Would maybe try a different alfredo or homemade alfredo next time.

Great base recipe!! I added a total of 5 cups chicken, cooked and cubed. Extra garlic powder and onions to the spinach/cheese mixture, and one egg to the spinach mixture as well.

Oh.... yummmers!! Since it's just the husband and I decided to halve the recipe, but did use the full 9 oz pkg frozen spinach and 3 Tyson frozen grilled chicken breasts, nuked and chopped them up. Roasted garlic alfredo sauce gave it plenty of flavor, didn't require any additions. Very easy to make lasagna, will be making this again.

Everyone loved it. I did change it a bit. Used 3/4 of the 2 pints of ricotta. Used only 1 1\4  jars of alfredo. Will make it again, absolutely.  oh and will get the garlic alfredo next time.

YUMMMM!  Comfort food!  What a nice change to Italian Lazagna.    I only added some fresh grated Romano to the spinach mix, and topper cheese layer.  Hit in my family and will be a keeper!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Love it! I'm a young guy and this was my first time ever making a lasagna and it turned out awesome! I substituted the ricotta for cream cheese (I couldn't find the ricotta in the grocery store and didn't have any more patience) and it turned out perfect! Cheese browned perfectly around the edges

This is perfect for a busy week night. My family loved it. I used a vegetarian chicken substitute and it didnt take away from the rich goodness at all. I doubled the spinach too, and my kids gobbled it up. I'll make this again.

I have been making this for years. But I grill the chicken in a foreman fryer first.  Thin the sauce with about 1/2 or so cup of milk. I never cook the noodles either. start with sauce, noodles, chicken spinach cheese, more sauce ect. Not a low cal dish but a great way to incorporate veggies for the kids. I also add sliced carrot.

I cooked and seasoned the chicken with all my favorite seasonings, I added pesto to the spinach/ricotta mixture, and i used oven ready pasta. Turned out beautifully. Next time I'll use foil over the top to keep the cheese from getting too crispy.

The 2 jars of store bought alfredo sauce was just too much for me. My husband said he liked it but didn't like the spinach in it. I actually thought it was a little better left over because the sauce kinda toned down.  It was super easy to make because you don't have to make any sauce but I don't think I'll make it again.

made this for the first time and my husband loves it. although I'm not a huge fan of chicken I enjoyed this aswell. I used classic regular creamy Alfredo sauce. everyone was recommending the garlic one but it was unavailable. I will definitely make this again.

It clearly benefitted from my enhancements as follows: 
1. I cubed 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, sauteed them in avocado oil until just cooked with tarragon, herbes de provence, 2 minced garlic cloves, lemon pepper,  couple of other handy spices incl. S&P
2. I lightly fried a half bunch of green onions with about 5 small portabello mushrooms which I added on top of the spinach layer
3. Added an extra cup of Moz for the top
4. I used the Classico roasted garlic alfredo sauce as another reviewer suggested

Next time will add something to make the sauce a bit runnier. Ours was a bit too thick.

I tried this recipe because it seemed fairly simple and wouldn't require too much prep.  Delicious!  This one is going in my book and I will definately make again!  The one thing though, this recipe says 9 x 13 and I needed to use a 10 x 15 in order to fit all of the ingredients.  I also substituted broccoli for spinach.  Also used 3 C of ricotta instead of 4C because that was the size container it came in and it was plenty enough.

I loved it! I used chopped up left over rotisserie chicken instead of chicken breasts, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also added a small jar of marinated artichoke hearts drained and chopped up, and some sliced baby Bella mushrooms. I do prefer to use the Alfredo sauce from the refrigerator section as opposed to the stuff in the jar. (sometimes I make my own but I was looking for easy) Of course I also threw in some diced onion and garlic as many others have mentioned. Last but not least, topped it off with a little fresh grated Parmesan. DEEEELISH!
UPDATE: I made this again with a suggestion from my husband and it was fantastic! I added a layer of prosciutto. Way to go hubby for the idea!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe, but cut in half since I was only cooking for 2.  Next time I will add some garlic.

One of the best recipes ever!  Tastes unbelievable.  Only left out the part about cooking the chicken before putting it in the lasagna - I figured that out on my own.

AMAZING!  I made my own Alfredo sauce from this website. Only thing I didn't use is ricotta cheese since I didn't have it.  Also topped with Parmesan cheese and seasoned my cooked chicken with salt and pepper.  This will be a staple at my house

So we really enjoyed this recipe,  however I made adjustments. 

With the ricotta and spinach mixture I added one egg.

I used 4 chicken breasts and not three.

I made my own alfredo sauce using half and half, cream cheese, parmesan cheese, garlic, pepper, and parsely. 

I put the sauce on the bottom of the pan. 

It was a wonderful meal and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. My biggest suggestion is to play around with it! Food is what you make it and if onions or mushrooms are your thing,  then put it in! A nice change to lasagna.

This was a great recipe - and very easy to prepare. I did 1/2 it for 3 adults. There was plenty and some leftovers.
In the middle of making this, I realized that I didn't have ricotta cheese, so I used 4 oz. cream cheese in it's place. I also used fresh spinach. I layered it, then cut the cream cheese into blocks which I laid on top of the spinach. Then I used sliced fresh tomatoes on top of that.
I'll cook  this again!

I didnt follow the recipe exactly so it didnt turn out just perfect. I read some of the reviews and decided to add some more chicken, but it turned out to be wayy too much chicken. I thought there wasn't enough sauce. The lasagna turned out to be a bit dry. I also used the oven-ready lasagna noodles, so maybe there needs to be more sauce for those. Next time I'll use more sauce or just thin out the sauce so the noodles have extra liquid to soak up. I also seasoned the ricotta/spinach mixture which was turned out good. 
The cooking time was also too much for my oven. Next time, I would cut down on the cooking down or cover the lasagna for the beginning of the cooking process.
I also mixed all the sauce and the chicken together, but next time I would like to have some sauce without the chicken for the bottom and top layers of sauce. Also, mushrooms would be a good addition to this.

I only used 1 jar of Alfredo sauce and  1 pint ricotta cheese. I used no boil lasagna noodles. Cooked chicken with garlic and Italian seasoning. Added a diced tomato. Added 2 eggs. I combined all the ingre. just leaving 2 cups of mozzarella and 1/2 of the Alfredo to put on the top. I would suggest adding a layer of tomato sauce as it was lacking a bit. Next time, I'm going to try broccoli, carrrots and chicken.

4 stars because I tweaked it a little...add minced garlic... I put mine in the chicken mixture, def makes a difference.  I also cut the mozz cheese back a little to lighten it calorie wise... I will keep this in my rotation. I also served it with red sauce on the side to drizzle on top, really good that way.

We really enjoyed this and would definitely make it again!  Two changes - for a lighter version we used cottage cheese in place of ricotta, and we used the oven-ready noodles.  We cut into it almost as soon as it came out of the oven and found that it was a little runny - but after about 5 mins it was good to go.  VERY delicious.  I would also recommend a little more chicken than called for.

I love this recipe and have made it twice now.  It turns out great, but both times has been runny.  I REALLY squeezed out the spinach so I don't think that was the problem.  Any suggestions?

Only changes I made were that I used a rotisserie chicken and the no-boil lasagne noodles. I, too, thought it was bland and needed garlic and more seasoning. I would make this again with those changes.

I love this recipe but can't help messing with recipes. The second time I cooked this I subbed cottage cheese for ricotta to save money, and I added feta cheese and parmesan as well (I find that premade alfredo sauces don't have enough flavour, but was too lazy to cook one from scratch.) I cooked the chicken in garlic, italian seasing, and seasoning salt. I think this would also be good with broccoli

This lasagna was incredibly bland and the texture was too much like ricotta cheese. I looked over the recipe to see if I left anything out that would have added some flavor, but no. It was heavy on the palate, bland cheesy with weird twang of spinach. Maybe I could have used better alfredo, fresh spinach or both.  It could really use some Parmesan or spices. I will not make this again.

I love this lasagna! It's creamy and lighter than the lasagna I usually make with tomato sauce. I've made this recipe twice now, once with spinach (which my 6-yr-old didn't care too much for) and just tonight with broccoli. I have to say that I prefer the one with broccoli better. I followed the recipe pretty much as is, mixing the chicken with the sauce (as per another reviewer) then layering as usual: sauce on the bottom of the pan, noodles, ricotta mixture, chicken/sauce, mozzarella/Parmesan, etc. 

I usually use oven-ready lasagna noodles, which confused me a bit as this recipe doesn't state whether or not to add in extra water to help cook the noodles. Next time, I will use the regular lasagna noodles; or even use the filling for cannelloni or manicotti :)

Overall, a good recipe that will be a staple for pasta night at our house.

Excellent! I made this for card club and everyone had seconds. Had lots left over and even my husband and our neighbor loved it. I did use an extra box of spinach (cooked and squeezed dry) which I just layered over the ricotta/spinch mixture, and also added a little layer of parmesan cheese somewhere in the lasagna.

i LOVED it. but i did add alot more chicken and it was wonderful. i used one jar of 4 cheese alfredo and one jar of garlic alfredo. but the servings were alot more than  the 4 servings stated on the recipe.
all in all, this is a super easy delicious recipe! try it. im sure your whole family will love it!

another tip is to buy chicken drumsticks cos chicken breasts are a bit expensive. boil the chicken till its tender, run it through some cold water or wait for it to get to room temperature then take off the chicken skin and take the meat off of the bones then take of the meat and either shred it with a fork or cut it into cubes. i personally used 6 drumsticks

This was a very great recipe starter. I of course had to make it my own by using garlic alfredo and mushroom alfredo sauce. Also used a normandy blend vegetable mix in the sauce with the chicken. To top it used a italian blend cheese so it had a more smoky taste. When cooking my chicken I added some olive oil, italian seasoning and some fresh garlic as well. Loved it!

Easy to make.  Use a large casserole!  
I used non cook lasagna noodles - would suggest you use the regular ones and boil them first.

My husband loved this but I thought it was only tolerable. I may make it again but only if my husband insists.

I made this with homemade sauce.  There are many recipes here and other places - fancy, pantry ingredients, low fat,. . . My son spoke to me while I counted noodles, so I had extras.  I used the extra to make spinach roll-ups - just spread the ricotta mixture on the noodle, secure with toothpicks, pour on sauce, sprinkle on mozzarella and cook with the lasagna until golden on the edges.  Great stuff!

Excellent recipe! I made it today and my husband can't stop eating it. He suggested the next time I make it to add olives to it. I think that sounds good so I will try that next time.

This was delicious and so simple! I made a few changes. I used whole wheat noodles and turkey since that's what I had on hand. Also I did not cook the the spinach first. I mixed it in raw and thawed into cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I turned out great. VERY filling and a HUGE hit.

Intead of using alfredo sauce from a jar, I made my own, but other than that, everything else was the same. I was planning on having a piece for lunch tomorrow, but there are no leftovers!

This was a good recipe. Instead of the spinach, I used green chili though, which came out good!! I probably wouldn't follow these directions exactly if I use it again. I would use more chicken, and a taller pan for more layers because there was too much cheese and sauces left over.
