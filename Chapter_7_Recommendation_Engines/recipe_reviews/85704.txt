My family loved these.  It was so hot today, I wanted to find something refreshing for them to drink.  Instead of using rum, I added 1 cup of cold water.  I also did not have strawberries so I substituted cherries.  I am about to make another batch as so as I do this review.

Made these today with strawberries I picked yesterday.  Had to add more strawberries than the recipe called for.  Overall, it was a good "girlie drink."
