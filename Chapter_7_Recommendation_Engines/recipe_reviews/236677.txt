I used ground turkey and didn't add sugar, and it was still delicious. They are scrumptious even without the sauce. The serving suggestion in the photo would be perfect.

I ran out of hoisin sauce so replaced the last bit with water and honey. Hoisin has a lot of salt already, so if you're using the sauce in the recipe, I don't think I'd bother adding salt to the meatballs. It makes it really salty. Or maybe cut back on the soy sauce.

I was skeptical because the recipe didn't call for eggs and I was afraid the meatballs would fall apart, but they didn't.

Just the right amount of spicy.  I baked in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes, turning once and never mixed into the sauce.  I drizzled the sauce over the whole meal.  Per other reviews, I reduced the soy sauce in the sauce.  Served over cauliflower rice and stir fry veggies.

Very tasty! Served with rice and garlic bok choy. Left out the cabbage and hot sauce. Didn't use lamb - used ground pork instead. I doubled the sauce the second time I made it because the first time there wasn't enough. I didn't broil it - only baked for 25 minutes. I kept  it in the slow cooker for about an hour before serving.

All beef. No cabbage or green onion. Followed recipe exactly but made the sauce on the stove.
