Might just be me, but I found the sauce extremely bland. I could see this being good though.

Found the sauce a little bitter for my American taste, so I added 1 TBS. sugar, with that this recipe turned out very good . I would make this again. Loved the saffron and paprika flavors.

I used Tumeric instead of Saffron. I  didn't use as much garlic. I used canned tomatoes with no salt instead of fresh tomatoes. I did use black pepper, onion and garlic powder. And seasoned it to my taste! Wonderful dish!
