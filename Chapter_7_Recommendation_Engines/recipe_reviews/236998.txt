Read plenty of reviews that said it was bland so I added butter chicken garlic and other types of cheeses. Turned out better than I was expecting but it's still missing something. My boyfriend loved it and wants me to make it again so I'll be trying something new next time!

I have to admit I made some tweaks to this recipe and even with the tweaks the resounding opinion was "bland". I added garlic salt and crushed red pepper to the sauce and I can't imagine how bland it would have been w/out them. I did have to sub dried for fresh herbs when the fresh I'd purchased didn't last until it was time to (finally) make this. However while they would have brightened the dish a bit they wouldn't have made a marked improvement. If you like blander food (and many do that's not a "knock" at all) this is certainly worth trying. THANKS for the recipe!

We didn't think it was bad but it seemed to be missing something. I added more basil and oregano and I also added garlic. I think unless you're trying not to eat meat this would be a good bit better with some grilled chicken tenderloins added to the mix. Going to try that next time and see what everyone thinks.

This was delicious! A perfect lighter pasta for warmer weather! I added mushrooms to the onions for a little more bulk. Served with fresh tossed greens and fresh Italian bread for all around great supper meal it was a hit with my family!
