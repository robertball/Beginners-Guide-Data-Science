Delicious!  Husband loved them! I took others' advice and doubled the butter and added 1/4 cup maple syrup.  I used finely chopped pecans which worked well. (Do not double the pecans, 1/4 cup was ample.) I had lots of flour left over, so next time will reduce flour to 1/3 cup.

These are awesome!  The taste is really good and not too-too sweet - it's just the natural flavor of the honey working.  I used pork chops instead of pork loin cutlets because loin is smaller and less plentiful and also, can be more expensive.  Chops do the job just as well, you may just have to add more prep time by removing the bone and/or extra fat.  If the chops are too thick, you can pound them out or cut them thinner.  With my honey mixture, I added a bit of brown sugar and used walnuts instead of pecans. (I would even try some almonds!)  Warming the honey makes the dish less heavy - very appetizing.

This was surprisingly good.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Had to add chicken broth to pan as there were no drippings.  Will make again!

I used extra thick boneless pork chops. I seasoned them well with salt, pepper, garlic powder and non-MSG tenderizer before I dredged them in flour.

I melted 2 TBLS butter with some olive oil and sauteed a small chopped onion and 2 cloves of chopped garlic. I removed those then well browned the chops. After I got them going I put a lid on them to get a nice brown crust. I then removed the chops to a covered square casserole dish. I put the onions and garlic back in the browning pan, added 1/4C real maple syrup, 1/3C chicken broth (if I had a non-citrus juice, I would have used that) & a splash of soy sauce and scaped up all the chop drippings. When that boiled I poured it over the chops, then sprinkled them with half the chopped pecans. 

I cooked them covered in the oven @ 350 fo about 30-40 min. I basted the chops with the liquid about half way through. After that initial 30-40 min, I removed the lid, basted again, sprinkled the rest of the pecan on top then cooked for 15 min more. At that point I removed most of the liquid to a small sauce pan and cooked the chops another 15 min. I boiled the liquid until it reduced by half and served it with the chops at the table.

My husband loved this dish. I think this would make a great & beautiful "company" dish. I think next time,  instead of maple syrup, I may try a fruit syrup. 

It DID occur to me that this is very similar to the way I cook 'holiday' yams!

Made as is only doubled the amount of honey and we really enjoyed although next time I think I'll try other reviewer's suggestions such as added some chopped onions, a dash of soy sauce and maybe even trying the half maramlade/half honey mix.  We're talking super easy and quick recipe here and yet, it tastes like you claved over the stove. Thanks for sharing this one Karena!

This is an awesome recipe.  I grill my chops instead.  Then I melt butter over the the stove and add the honey & pecans and spoon the mixture over my chops.  It's so easy.  I love it!

Just like the title describes, this pork tenderloin is awesome.  I took previous reviewers' recommendations and added some chopped onion to counter the sweetness and I let the honey cook down a little so I had to spoon the pecan mixture over the meat more than really pouring it.  It was delicious and we all loved it.  I needed some tenderloin recipes and this is a wonderful addition!

I don't know how to discribe this dish.  I think I must have done something wrong.  The pork chops were dried out and the sauce was more like candy than sauce.  My husband loved them, but I probably won't make again.

Great recipe.  My family loved it and it took less than a 1/2 hour to make.  That's my kind of dinner.  If you don't like real sweet meat then don't pour the sauce over the pork, just use it as a dipping sauce.  Either way it's a great dinner.

this recipe is PERFECT "as is". i don't know why people try to "tweak" a recipe when they haven't even tried the recipe in it's original version, then they give the recipe poor ratings and wonder why they didn't like it. ***after reading further reviews... i think if people used REAL honey (not that cheap fake stuff) they might get better results.

this recipe had the perfect level of sweet taste, balanced with other flavors. simple and tasty! and so easy to make! thank you for sharing.

this was INCREDIBLE, after a little tweaking. i used 1 lb thin cut boneless pork loin, added seasoning salt and garlic onion spices to the flour (recipe does call for a little too much flour, but its ok if u adequately spice it and dont mind wasting a little...) browned it w 2tbs of butter- there wasnt anything left in the pan, so i added 2 more tbs butter, 1/3c chicken broth and some soy sauce as suggested to the honey and pecans. it was soooooo gooooood! definitely will make again!

My husband liked this, but said it was too rich overall. Adding the little bit of leftover sauce to the water for Stove-top made the whole meal rich and decadent.

OHHHHH LA LA…. As the french would say "Votre grenouille a mangé mon dejeuner."  These chops are top notch.   After reading everyone's reviews I was extremely paranoid that these chops would make the dirt taste sweet so I added the ½ cup of chicken broth and 1 tbs of soy sauce.  It was perfect.  Wolfgang HATES pecans so we made this dish with lots o almonds and it looked FANCY and tasted DIVINE.  Wolfgang insists on having this meal again.  He said it was almost as sweet as the cook.

Very good using pork chops. The trick to not having a hard sauce is to warm the honey and pecans on low heat, it doesn't take long.  Nice change from the usual but don't try this if you don't like things sweet.

I would of given this recipe 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that the chef who created it should probably of said to cook on a lower heat or said to cook with thin loins. Even though the pork got a little burnt (I think mine were thicker than the norm) it tasted great.
I didn't have the correct nuts for this so I just used peanuts and it still tasted amazing. I also followed past reviewers advice and added 3 squirts of soy sauce so it wouldn't be so sweet - and it worked. I suggest doing that. And I added some extra olive oil to cook longer.
I am a big ketchup person, so if I don't like the sauce I just dip it in ketchup. Well, I LOVED this sauce, it was perfect! Even for me! And very very easy to make. Just remember: cook on medium to low heat if you have thicker loins. 

I do not cook pork often since I have never found a recipe I like but I love this one so I will be cooking pork more often!

This recipe was great and very easy too.  The reviews about it being rather sweet were helpful also, so the small adjustment I made was to add a small amount of chile sauce to the honey/pecan glaze.  Oh, I also added some season salt and pepper to the flour.  My husbad was very pleased.  I will make this recipe again.

This was awesome!  When I first brought the plate of pork chops to the table, my husband made a face and said "Pork chops with nuts?!?!".  By the end of the meal, he kept cutting pieces off of the last piece and his quote was "These pork chops are addicting!!!?  I added the garlic and chopped onion as others recommended and I think that made the difference. It had a nice flavor to compliment the sweetness.  It is a bit sweet, so I added extra butter and that balanced it out a bit.  It also gave us extra sauce.  Very easy & a quick meal that looks like you spent hours in the kitchen!!!

These were good, but I found the sauce overwhelmingly sweet. I ended up adding some lemon juice. As far as the chops, I used a thick cut, bone-in chop.  I did not pound thin.  Instead, I browned them in the skillet for a few minutes on each side and then transferred to a baking dish and baked covered until done.  Made for a tender and juicy pork chop.

Wow, these were great!  I roasted the pecans in the oven first (at a low temp, maybe 250, just long enough to crisp them up a bit and bring out the flavor, maybe 5 to 10 minutes, watch them or they'll burn), and then mixed them with a teaspoon of butter and a dash of salt.  Also, I took the pan off the heat while I added the honey.  This way, it stayed "saucey", and didn't get thick.  I will make this again, especially when I need a fancy dish for company.  It looks and tastes like something you would get at a nice restaurant.

I didn't have Honey or Pecans so I made this with Real Maple syrup and walnuts.  I used a little more maple syrup in the cooking process. My husband loves this dish so much that he couldn't stop talking about it!  I highly reccomend trying it this way also and i plan to try it with honey and pecans someday too!

I have made these twoce already and they are yummy!  My husband LOVES pecans.  As a side dish, I made "candied sweet potatoes" and green beans.  It was all yummy!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!  Highly recommended.

Yum!  I love everything about it.  I did add chicken broth to the sauce to temper the sweetness just a little bit and to thin the sauce a bit.  Will become a regular in our house, especially for company.

So easy, but delicious!  Got RAVE reviews from family!  I used pepper and garlic salt in my flour and pounded it in.  I doubled the butter to cook the pork in.  After taking the pork out, I looked in the pan and there is still no way I was going to be able to mix 1/4 cup of honey in the pan, so following others advise, I added a little less than 1/4 cup of chicken broth. I toasted my pecans in the oven for a few min, added them to the pan and cooked only long enough to heat thru (reading other reviews, I didn't want hard candy for my pork chops!)  Thanks for making me look like a gourmet chef!

Only reason it got a 4 is because I totally tweaked it.  Oh man...but after I did!  Sooooo tasty!  Here's what I did:

I marinated some boneless slices of pork loin (not sure how much b/c I took it from a large loin and froze it earlier)in 2 cloves of garlic, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon honey for like 4 hours or so.

I took the marinated pork and dredged it in 1/4 cup flour-I don't think I added the S&P.  I melted 6 tablespoons of lite Smart Balance and cooked 1/2 chopped onion and 2 pressed garlic cloves then added the pork.  Cooked it a little and then turned it over.  I took the pork out and put it in a casserole.  I put 2 tablespoons honey and 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup chopped pecans to the pan with onions and garlic.  Cooked it just a bit, then poured it over the pork in the casserole dish.  I put the lid on it and cooked it for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Oh my goodness, it was crazy good!  I had it with jasmine rice and some yummy veggies.

Great recipe!  I doubled the butter I used in the pan and it gave the pork a nice crust.  Definitely don't overcook the sauce - I cooked the sauce for about 3 minutes and it turned out to be the consistency of peanut butter.  Overall, this is a fast, weeknight-type meal.

Add minced garlic to the butter and be careful to not burn!  Takes away the sweetness and adds a tangy sweet and sour taste.  Very good!

Husband and I loved this recipe! We didn't have any money to get fast food tonight that I've been craving for, but it hit the spot!! Next time, I will adjust the burner so it won't get my stainless steel pan so darn hot and burn the butter. It was still great! mmmmm! I will be making this again and again!

These didn't turn out very well for me. For one, I must have let the sauce cook too long because when i poured it over the chops, it just caramelized and was hard like candy. The chops also didn't have much flavor; very floury. If I do ever attempt to make this again, it won't be for awhile!

This was soooo easy to make yet so delicious.  I took the advice of some other reviewer and added more butter and the sauce turned out really great.
I'm making this next time I have guest over.

These are definitely very easy and a quick stovetop dish.  I just used pork chops and skipped the tenderizing.  I used Montreal Steak seasoning in place of the salt and pepper (no reason, just saw it first and thought it would work), and that's the extent of my changes.  Definitely keep this on low heat so the chops don't brown too fast and get dry.  I also thought the pecans were a bit much--I'd do less of them next time.  Otherwise, a great meat dish.  I served with mac and cheese and salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  I cut a pork tenderloin up and pounded the slices a little thin.  I did add a splash of soy sauce and white wine.  After I made the sauce I put my meet back in the pan with lid and let it simmer on low for 5 minutes... YUM!! The meat was so tender and not super sweet.  A great new way to use Tenderloin instead of just roasting the whole thing.  THanks!!!!

This was really tasty. I took others recc's and seasoned the chops with garlic pwdr, s, p, and tenderizer, then pounded. I then dredged in flour w/ additional seasoning (we like it flavorful & it was).  Then prepared as stated. NOTE!!! When adding nuts and honey to pan, DO NOT overcook b/c it turns hard when cooled..like candy. My fault so I'll make it again; good flavor!

I added a couple TB of broth to the honey and nut mix, it seemed too thick. The overall flavor was sweet, but not too sweet. I finely chopped the pecans which gave the meat an even coat of nuts but a 1/4 cup was plenty. Everybody loved it.

FABULOUS!  My husband fell in love with them.  We've decided to make this our family's Christmas dinner.  I do think, however, I'll add a little brown sugar to enhance the sweetness.

These were the best pork chops I've ever tried.  I don't usually care for pork chops, but do make them just to change up our usual ground beef & chicken meals.  My husband said this was a keeper.  I will be making this one again & again.

By far the best pork chops ever.  I made a 2 serving version with 2 boneless porkchops.  I seared the chops in 1TBS butter over medium heat for 7 mins each side....then cooked covered until it reached 145 internal temperature.  After removing the chops I added 1 TBS of butter, 1.5 TBS of honey & 2TBS of pecans.  Brought that to a boil and added them to my chops.  It was not too sweet whatsoever if you cut back on the honey.  I served with stuffing.

Wow, these are delicious and so simple to make. The Pecan/Honey glaze gives a nice finish to the pork chops. My family loved them. I was shocked how much flavor they had with so little prep work.

I only made two slight changes and we enjoyed the meal. I used pork chops, cooking themlong enough to ensure they were done. I also added garlic powder to the flour. Otherwise, the recipe was good as is.

Oh YUMMY!  This recipe was super easy and very very good. I read through the comments before making it so I added about a half teaspoon brown sugar and some Shallot Onions to the sauce. It really complemented the sweetness nicely.  I also added some garlic salt to the flour mix.  I used a cast iron wok to cook it in ((cause I love it)) and spooned on a bit more of the flour mixture on each piece half way though cooking, it made them nice and crispy on the outside and super moist on the inside. ^_^ Awesome recipe, I will definitely be making again!

Since “Awesome” is the most over-used cliché in America today, I can’t bring myself to use it.  “Very good” and “very easy” fit this recipe. It really is a nice blending of flavors  and a dish that will appeal to those with a “sweet tooth”, which I have.

really REALLY good.  I used pork chops and pounded them thin with a jagged meat tenderizer.  I did not have a lot of pan drippings so i added some veggie stock (wouldve used chicken if I had it) and a little maple syrup with a dash of cayenne, a healthy couple of shakes of onion powder (didnt have any onions on hand) and a dash of sage, I cooked that down before adding the honey and nuts, then I just let that reduce a bit, although I wished I hadnt because my husband and I could have drank that sauce! will definately make again.

I prepared this with no changes from the original recipe, and served with baked sweet potatoes.  While this dish went perfect with the potatoes, there was just something about it that tasted a little 'off'.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, maybe it's that there was nothing to cut the sweetness, or maybe it was the slight bitterness of the pecans?  If you like the basic ingredients (pork, honey and pecans), and don't mind the sweetness, you'll probably enjoy this recipe.

Fantabulous!  I added 1/2 C chicken broth and 1T soy sauce per other reviews, and then some flour at the end to thicken the sauce.  Use very thin bone-in pork chops!  5 stars from husband too.

Serve with sweet potatoes and green beans... yum just writing this makes me hungry!

To DIE for, and so fast and quick! I turned the heat up on high, once I added the honey and pecans to the drippings...and I added just shy of 1/2 cup chicken stock. The sauce thickened up, and I ate every bite with relish. A definite quick and delicious dinner. Thanks!

This was so simple and so good.  We love to eat pork so this was a nice change in our routine.  I did follow some of the advice of previous users and added about 1/2 C. of chicken broth and about a Tbs. of Soy Sauce to the honey-pecan sauce just to make sure it didn't get hard.  Turned out awesome and not overly sweet.  Will definately reccomend to others and will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I appreciated this recipe, as it was a new way to fix pork, but I don't suppose I will be making it again.  I prepared it per the recipe without any changes, and 'twas very easy to make make.  BUT, too sweet for us...  Incidentally, honey-nut sauce does carmelize if left on stove,and will get hard.  So take off the burner when warming the "sauce"...

Wow. 
Well that could say it all by itself, but I'll add that my husband gobbled these up and then hinted that he'd like me to use this recipe again (something that doesn't always happen). I reccommend not pairing this with something sweet (such as sweet potatoes), as it would be very overwhelming since this pork is already very sweet. Instead I made garlic mashed potatoes and I think a salad. Very tasty!

Right up this Southern Gal's Alley!  I did make a tiny modification to the recipe.  I added 1/2 a teaspoon of Cinnamon to the Honey/Nut mixture.  Very good recipe and I will definitely make it again!

Yummy!  I didn't pound out the pork chops very thin but evened them out.  I then used a instant read thermometer to reach the right temp.  I had a generous amount of pan juices but added an extra pat of butter just for good measure.  My husband has decided that pecan rolls have to pork fat worked into the recipe.  As Emeril says "It's a pork fat love thing." (or something like that). I'll have to make it for my toddler when he gets over his cold and see how he likes it.  Thanks for the yummy dinner.

I thought these were pretty tasty.  My 5 year old ate it up without complaint and she's pretty picky.  My husband was impressed with the appearance.  This dish is pretty classy.

My husband made this while I was at work.  The only thing we changed was to add a little more pecans.  We both really like this recipe, and my husband DOES NOT COOK, so that tells you how easy it was!

This was good the first time I made it, and the second time I added some sauteed onions and a little marmalade and my husband swore it tasted just like the TGI Friday's Jack Daniel's sauce. I did half honey/half syrup and added a dash of soy sauce. Excellent!

THIS WAS GREAT!!! I had some guest over to be my guinea pigs and we ran out of pork chops to everyone's disappointment.  We were scraping the honey-pecan sauce off of the plate.  My husband who is a picky eater loved it and said that we would be eating it again very soon!!  We ate it with steamed broccoli, rice-a-roni, and peas & carrots.  The mixture of veggies and rice with the chops was delicious. ;~)

I was very surprised how good this was.  I was very easy, but I'm not a cook and the recipe does not indicate how much butter to use.  I used 3 T., but next time I'll use 4 T.  This recipe is worth trying.  I know you'll have it again and again, as I know I will.

It was okay.  Not too sweet, but not very flavourful either.  Maybe soya sauce, and some grilled onion in the sauce would help.

Rave reviews from the husband and kids (2 and 1). I tasted the end product with original ingredients but felt like it needed just a little kick up a notch so I followed other suggestions and added 1/4 cup maple syrup and doubled butter. Husband loved it. :) Thanks Karena and reviewers!

Very good. I used boneless pork loin chops, flattened slightly. The honey sauce was SO thick, that I added more butter at the end ... just swirled it in until it melted. Hubby loved this!

This was delicious!  We brined the pork first and it was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  We added a little brown sugar to the sauce.  We will definitely make this again!

Maybe I did something wrong, however, as written this recipe didn't work for us.  My kids said it was too sweet, it didn't have a taste at all for me. Will not make again.

I use this recipe alot because I'm not a fan of pork chops, but they are cheap, easy and a crowd pleaser.  I have added Brown Sugar and Apples with or without the Pecans (have also used Walnuts)....May be sweee but certainly gives a fun flavor!  I make this "sauce" in a small sauce pan on the side so I avoid burning or any other mishap.

This was so easy and so yummy!  My family loved it.  I followed another reviewer's advice since a lot of the reviews said too sweet.  I added a few splashes of Balsamic vinegar and it cut the sweetness just enough and gave it a gourmet taste.  I will add this to my regular meal rotation and won't even have to check the recipe again - its that easy!

The dish was FANTASTIC. Take seriously the warning not to overcook the sauce - I just left the skillet on warm for a while while I prepped the rest of the meal - the sauce was the consistancy of candy after I put it on the chops. Would suggest prepping the sauce >>immediately before

This was a great recipe! I really like how the sauce caramelized on top of the porkchops.  I used walnuts because they were a lot cheaper and I also added a few tablespoons of soy sauce to lessen the sweetness.

Very surprised how good this is! I bought the ingredients for this dish weeks ago but kept putting it off because it wasn't something my husband would normally like....or so I thought. I read most of the reviews and decided to add onions and a small amount if chickrn broth bto the sauce. I also added a little maple syrup along with the 1/4 cup of honey. I spiced up the meat with salt, pepper & cayenne to balance out the sweet taste of the sauce. It was a hit. I was so worried my husband wouldn't like it but we both did.

This is so good. Have also done this with mixed nuts and is still tastes great.  Pork is a big winner in our household so it is great having another variation to enjoy.  Thanks!

Really good.  I double the amount of honey I used and it was a big hit with my family, who normally hate pork chops!  Be careful not to put the sauce together until right before you are ready to serve the chops.  I found that the sauce turns very thick and syrupy really quickly while its heating in the pan.

YUM! We just loved this recipe! My husband is not the sort that likes to try new things.  He doesnt like a lot of the foods that I love- so I was really worried about this recipe.  But he loved it so much that he took the leftovers to work with him the next day for his lunch! Our kids are not fincky eaters, but all the same they loved it tons as well! THanks for the great recipe!

The glaze is entirely too sweet, so I used less Honey and added a little chicken broth.  I also added onions to the browning with the pork.  It helped!

This is really tasty and filling.  The only problem I ran into was with leftovers.  The sauce was hard as a rock so I melted it, and when it cooled it got kind of grainy and very sticky.  I would just make as much sauce as I planned to use at the meal and then make more with the leftovers in the future.

These were really good!  I was looking for a new recipe for pork chops...this is one I'll go back to often.  I did add some chopped onion to the honey and pecans and let it reduce down.  So good!  My husband really enjoyed them and even ate them for leftovers at work a few days later...and he rarely enjoys leftovers!

Since my husband declared these the "best pork chops EVER", I had to post.  They were so quick and easy, I
ll definitely be making these again.  The only change I made was to use some chicken broth to keep the chops from sticking to the pan.  I was able to use less butter that way, and it didn't diminish the flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have used thin pork chops and chicken breast that I pounded thinner.  I also added a bit of minced garlic to the honey sauce.  Yummy recipe!

Absolutely awesome! I didn't change the recipe at all... In the past, I've gone light on the salt and pepper with the flour for dredging, not this time. It made SUCH a difference! The honey/pecan mixture is great! Even wonderful as leftovers...if you don't have enough honey/pecan left, just add a little honey when you microwave it. Will make again -Oh, only change I made was slicing the loin into 1/2" pieces instead of pounding thin (personal preference).

I added ground mustard to the flour dredge, along with garlic salt.  Used cashews instead of pecans.  I used pork tenderloin, sliced up and pounded thin.  It tasted fabulous, at least, according to my husband.

I have made this recipe many times and noticed that it was the Recipe of the Day.  This is wonderful!  I'm always looking for new ways to make dishes other than chicken or beef, and this always gets great reviews. :)  I've been asked to make it again and again.

We will make this again, but I did change a few things as suggested by other cooks. I added several dashes of soy sauce, I doubled the butter (though I use margarine), I added the onion and I doubled the pecans. There was plenty of sauce and I even put it in the oven and kept it warmed with the sauce on it while my squash finished cooking. This caused the sauce to thin a little bit, but it was perfect. Not too sweet, a little crunch (yum!) SUPER EASY!

This was really good, with a few changes.  I added onion and garlic when sauteeing the chops.  Reduced honey to 2 tablespoons and added 1 tbsp soy and 1 tbsp lemon juice.  Garnished with fresh snipped chives.  Very pretty, quick, and delicous.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  The only thing that I would like to add is try not to let the topping sit around too long before you put it on the pork chops because it hardens rather quickly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My whole family loved this recipe!  It is a great diversion from the typical pork recipe!  I was careful to not overcook the sauce and I had no problems at all.

Turned out terrible. Pork Chops tasted O.K. but the sauce had a scorched taste(I only cooked sauce for 30 seds)maybe on a cooled pan and on low heat it might be alright.

These were overall a disappointment (I know: I'm way in the minority here!). After reading all the (mostly great) reviews, I'd expected something fabulous. I made the recipe exactly as stated, altering nothing. It was just ok; the sauce didn't seem to compliment the pork all that well; I guess it was the sweetness (my husband said it was like the top of a Cinnabon). I won't make this again, but am glad I tried it. I might make the sauce some other time and put it over ice cream.

Very Tasty!  They took a little while to make, and my kitchen was a mess afterwards, but they were well worth it.  I made them with Mashed Potatos and fresh veggies.  I neglected to pour the honey/pecan glaze directly over the chops, straight from the pan.  Doing so didn't get the glaze over the whole chop, which was a mistake.

Boyo's and Girlo's and folks  what a great dinner, made as per recipe just added two more pork fillets with a extra tablespoon of  butter. Fantastic served with mashed sweet potato and green beans both drizzled with the sauce.
Note: pounded the pork fillets to about 10mm or 3/8 inches
thick pan fried 3-4 minutes one side and 2 minutes the other side then let sit while mashing and microwaving the
cut beans

Made the recipe exactly as described.  I agree with another reviewer regarding the amount of flour.  I had a lot remaining, however, this recipe was so delicious that I will rate it five stars.  My husband loves pork chops and he said these are the best pork chops he has ever eaten.  Even better than those at Hoffbrau.  My kitchen "creds" have soared because of this fabulous recipe.  Thank you!

Very simple but tasty. Omitted pecans because I didn't have on hand and the hubby dislikes crunchy nuts on his meat dishes. Followed a reviewer's advice to season meat prior to browning...think this makes a big difference. Will make again...next time will just brown in the skillet and then roast in the oven.

I have to say that I am very disappointed. I followed the recipe to the exact but perhaps I did not add the right amount of salt/pepper because there no measurements provided? Not sure. The pork chops did not brown like it should have, there were no drippings and it turned out more like a honey flavored candy more than anything. My husband and kids are NOT picky eaters but they couldn't deal with this recipe at all. Even hard to swallow. I felt extremely guilty but I tried.. Sorry, didn't work for me.

The Wife liked it, or maybe she was just being nice.  Maybe I did something wrong, but the honey glaze just tasted like honey, as if I'd squeezed the honey bear directly onto the meat.  I think I should have added chicken broth or something, since there was hardly any drippings from the pork.

We've had these a few times.  Probably because we like pecans and honey.  The flavour is not quite as intense as I would have liked.  We are trying them again, just to see and compare.

These were awesome!  This is the easiest thing I've ever made that doesn't have a bunch of processed  in it.  I used thin-cut pork chops, so I didn't have to pound them.  I threw some sweet potato spears in the oven with a little oil and dinner was ready in 20 minutes!  5 stars! This is something we will have regularly from now on!

A little to sweet for my family. I, however, thought that they were alright. I used advice from others and put 1/4 cup maple syrup on them.

This is definitely a keeper!  Since we do not eat pork, I used turkey breast cutlets and it was delicious.  I incorporated some suggestions: cut into chunks, added maple syrup and seasoned my meat before flouring. Not too sweet at all.  Yummy!

The only change I made was to spoon 1/2 the honey mix over the chops in a 9x13 pan and bake for 15 mins at 350, turn, baste with the rest of the honey mix and bake another 15 mins. Came out nice and moist and sweet, but I'd recommend anyone who doesn't like sweet meat to add some onion or soy sauce as other reviewers have suggested.

I tried this b/c I only make 2 good pork chops recipies, always good to expand that. This will probably NOT be added to my rotation. I took others advice and used some maple syrup, did half syrup and half honey, with about 1.5 tbsp. brown sugar. It was very sweet, neither my husband or 3 y.o. liked it, I thought it was OK.

Outside of fixing pork in my crock pot, these pork chops were the most tender I've had. I followed the directions almost to a T. The only change I made was to add a tablespoon or so of maple syrup because I was low on honey. They were so tender and delicious. I'm definitely adding this to my list of staple recipes.

made recipe as called for, did add a bit more butter as most every else seemed to do also, and did add a teaspoon of pure maple syrup as someone suggested.
Came out very nice.
I took people's warnings about the honey burnng so I added the pecans to the pan first, and did that for about a minute or two, then added honey/maple syrup mixture. This way the nuts took some of the heat out of the pan so the syrup did not burn or get too dark.

This was really good! I made the pork chops and sauce per recipe and I must add that after tasting it, I thought it was too sweet. However, I ended up putting it over rice and it mellowed the sweetness and was perfect along with a lettuce salad. I will definitely be making it again(with the rice)!

My girlfriend said, "This pretty much tastes like pork and honey. People might want to use some spices when they make this." But it's still pretty  good. After all, it tastes like pork and honey.

The name of the recipe sums it up and these chops are a keeper in my book! I like pork nearly every way it can be prepared and this recipe is no exception- the pork was superb and the honey pecan sauce added a sweet flavor that blends well with the taste of the meat. I read the other reviews prior to making the dish and I'm glad I did because I took some advice and added soy sauce and chicken stock to the honey pecan sauce. My sauce didn't harden as it began to cool and the additional ingredients allowed me to make enough sauce for left-overs. We ate two chops on the night I made this recipe and over the past two days, I've enjoyed the left-overs. The pork even heated up in the microwave without drying out and I will be certain to make this dish again :) Due to a late start for dinner, I paired the pork chops with some frozen peas and stove top stuffing (for pork).

Absolutely fantastic!!  Very easy to prepare.  I added a little more butter and chicken broth to thin out the sauce a little bit.  Delicious!! Will definitely make again!!!

amazing, i have always had back luck with pork chops and i figured i'd try one more time. glad i did. so tender and flavorful. I think i would thin out the sauce substantially. because the sauce was more like candy.

This was fabulous!  I didn't have a lot of pan drippings because I used lean loin of pork.  To compensate, I had to add some more butter for my sauce.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  Suggestion:  Use a quality cut thin pork chop or slices from a pork loin and this will come out much better.

The flavor of these was great but I overcooked the honey mixture a bit, but the recipe warns about that!  I think I will try these again and not cook the honey and pecans too long.  This would be great for chicken too!

This dish was awesome. My cooking skills  are seriously laking, but my husband loved this dish and it came out really well.  I followed some tips from others with adding more butter and minced garlic to the sauce so not as sweet.  Plus I spiced up my pork chops with some cajun seasoning rather than just salt and pepper.  Will definitely make again!!

This was Ok if you can get over the fact that this tastes nothing like pork chops!! : ) Seriously, it tasted like I was eating honey & pecans. I liked the idea, but it was way too sweet and just plain weird. I will not make this again, though it was nice to try something new.

Very very good! I only give it a four because I had to spice it up a bit... I added about 2T of Dijon mustard, and some paprika, garlic powder, and other stuff... the honey alone with the nuts would have been too sweet. Overall very good, I will definitely make it again!

Very good!  Based on other reviews, I added finely diced onions and garlic to the butter before browning the chops.  Then I put the chops in a 325 oven for a few minutes to make sure they were cooked through.  I added a dash of soy to the drippings as well.  Everyone really liked them and they were good as leftovers too.

Made this tonight. Followed some of the suggestions and sauted chopped onion and pressed a clove of garlic in the butter before cooking chops.  I can't have wheat gluten so I substituted the flour for a wheat free baking mix made of a blend of rice flours and almond meal.  I also added about a table spoon of soy sauce and 1/3 cup chicken broth.  YUMMY!  Hubby and I are taking the left overs for lunch tomorrow - I can't wait!

I will admit I did not use butter to fry my pork chops and that could have made all the difference. But it just lacked flavor. I can see were the excitement comes from but this was just not good for me.

My sister and I made this for Mother's Day with thinly sliced almonds and it was a hit! It was easier to make than anticipated and pretty quick.

Dad, Uncle, and 7 year old all loved this!  I used thin sliced chops instead of pounded ones.  I added the garlic to the butter as others here had, and also tried the cinnamon and nutmeg suggestion.  I used twice the pecans to tone down the sweetness.  It turned out to be more of a crumbly topping than a sauce but it was still delicious.  This is the first recipe at Allrecipes.com that I will give five stars to!

This is pretty easy and had a nice, mild flavor.  It was not overpowering.  I took the advise of others and used 1/2 honey and 1/2 maple syrup.  I tasted more syrup than honey, so I may try it the original way next time.

Be sparing with the sauce.  I used too much for the amount of pork chops and it was overpoweringly sweet.  A good recipe, but for me not quite 'worth it' for the high fat content.

I don't think my husband liked this as much as I did, but I enjoyed the unique flavor. I changed a few things by adding a some lemon juice to the honey sauce and a small dash of soy sauce, and it really helped bring in some more flavors and a little bit more kick. Either way though, I thought it was great, but I would suggest that those who don't appreciate sweet meats or sweet flavors skip this one...But it's a keeper for me!

This was a very easy recipe to make and delicious! It will definitely go into my "quick weeknight supper" repetoire. I would like a little more salty flavor to balance the sweetness. I'm thinking of perhaps using parmesean cheese instead of flour to form a crust on the chops. Excellent recipe!

A very quick and easy to change pork chops.  To save time, I paid a little extra and bought the chops that were already thin cut...no pounding.

If you really like the taste of honey, you would like this recipe.  I was hoping that the butter would mellow the honey taste some, but it didn't.  It was alright.

This was WAY too sweet.  I was only able to take a couple bites before I could not take it anymore.  My husband did enjoy it, but I would not make again because I could not handle the sweetness.

This recipe was great, however I used butterfly chops that were considerably thicker of a cut and browned them and continued with the sauce and put them in a pan to bake through.  I ended up baking them about 20-25 mins, and with my pecans I ground them up to a fine powder and sprinkled them over the tops to bake and it was as if there were a crumb topping over the top when they were done.  These were soooo great, even if they are sweet, and adding the soy sauce does help, but the leftovers (if there are any) dont seem to be near as sweet, and just as good!  This is one I will make regularly!

My husband and I truly enjoyed this recipe, we even found ourselves talking about how good it was hours later. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and used 50% honey, 50% syrup and a little extra butter. I served on a bed of rice with steamed broccoli...this seemed to take the sweetness down a notch. It was delicious and we plan to enjoy this meal again. Thank you for contributing this recipe so that others could enjoy.

My entire family thought that this was absolutely wonderful! It was gourmet flavour with out the gourmet preperation. I did take a lot of the suggestions and alterted it a bit, with this many cooks around we'll probably tweek everything! I chopped my pecans very finely, I doubled the sauce,the other half with maple syrup(it was so yummy),and finally cut it with a splash of soya sauce. Wow! I'll do this again and again.

Easy to make and good.  Needed to use more butter (eventually added some veg. oil).  Would suggest serving over rice.  Would also suggest finely chopping the pecans.

This was very similiar to a recipe my mom served in Georgia, very delicious! the glaze thickens 
VERY quickly though, I had to add the cutlets back to the pan after they were glazed, just to get them
thoroughly coated. Overall, very nice!

What a great flavor!  Due to time constraints, I had to modify the recipe a bit, but it's a favorite in my household.

First, I used a full cut of pork loin.  I seasoned it with salt and pepper and browned it in butter on high heat.  I put the pork loin in a baking dish and deglazed the pan I browned my pork in with some dry white wine.  I poured this over my pork loin.

I baked the pork loin at 350F until the center read 155F.  After removing the pork loin, I deglazed the roasting pan a second time with more white wine and transferred the drippings into a saucepan, where I added the honey and pecans.

I sliced the pork and covered it with the honey pecan sauce. It was FABULOUS!!

I love these pork chops.  I didn't think they would be good, but they were.  I used Orange-Blossom Honey instead of plain honey, made it taste even better.  I also used a little bit more butter than what was called for.  I also seasoned the flour with seasoned meat tenderizer along with the salt and pepper.  They were so tender that they practically melted in your mouth.  I didn't pound them until thin, I bought some that were fairly thick and pounded them, but not so that they were very thin just enough to be tender.

Was very good, but  a bit plain.  A great change though.  I would recommned not getting brazen like I did, and adding some of the honey-pecan sauce to the sweet potatoes, if you are going to make them.  I loved this extra sweetness, but my fiance said the sweetened sweet potatos were a bit too much.. If you have a sweet tooth, this makes the sweet-potatoes taste like a sweet potato pie.. yum

This recipe was really simple to make, but tasted as if I slaved over a hot stove for hours.  My husband couldn't wait to dig in, just by the smell and appearance.  We both enjoyed the dish and would make it again.

It's missing something.  I think the pork needs more seasoning before the sauce. Nice change, though.

Super easy to prepare! Family LOVED it and told me that I have to keep this recipe. I made buttered rice as one of my side dishes and it went together superbly. The ONLY thing I did different was that I had to add more butter as I browned the chops because the flour soaked it up. Highly recommended for easy delicious  dinner

Yum! My daughter and I like this a lot. Husband not so much, but he doesn't care for sweet meat. Made as is except used pork chops instead. Served with au gratin potatoes which was a nice contrast to the sweetness.

Excellent, great taste! Very easy recipe to follow, with a result everyone in my family were talking about all night. I made the mistake of getting w/bone. So I got to de-bone and tenderize myself, but I had some pent up aggression so that was ok, lol.

I made this for the family. One out of three ppl liked it. Its not bad but its not great. I feel if the pecans were softer it would be better. I felt the contrast between the hard pecans and soft pork chop just didn't mix.

Super easy, definitely need to double the butter for the glaze. Husband loved it which always makes a 5 star recipe! It was a little too sweet for me, but I'm sure this will be a family favorite.

The sauce was bad because the recipe didn't call for enough butter and the flour started burning which in turn ruined the sauce.

very sweet, as expected, but delicious!  the pecans get a very delicious roasted flavor.  i used coconut oil instead of butter, which rounded out the sweetness.  i also added in some ground flax to the flour to increase the nutrition.

This was very good, but the second time I made it I kicked it up a notch. I lightly sauted  some yellow peppers, mushrooms and garlic in the pan then put to the side. In the same pan cooked porkchops, then moved them to a warm plate when done. When adding the honey and pecan I also added a 1/4 cup of white wine then added the already sauted veggies. Make sure to scrape up the little bits of crunchy bits from the pork chops. My boys love this dish!

I absolutely love this recipe but I made small changes.  First of all, I didn't dredge the pork chops in flour.  I used some butter and orange juice.  My husband thought the honey was overpowering so I gave the recipe 4/5 stars.  I love honey so I thought it was perfect.  Might reduce the honey and pecans ever so slightly.

The honey pecan sauce would be great on pancakes, but I thought it was pretty sweet for pork chops.  I mixed in some oaxaca chile sauce and it helped balance it better in my opinion.

I love this recipe. Like many others, I doubled the butter because the sauce was too thick. I make this all the time with a side of crash hot potatoes from the Pioneer Woman blog.

I changed the recipe only slightly by adding a splash of balsamic as I thought that it would be too sweet for me as it was written, and the flavors balanced very well. I only used a splash because I scaled the recipe down for just one serving, so if you are making this with the original measurments you would probably  need more than a splash to get that balance. Overall very good, but I think I would like to try and experiment a little bit more with the seasonings, but I will definitely be making it again

These came out AWESOME! I made these with asparagus and my husband loved them! I did add Maple Syrup and sauteed onions to the recipe which gave it a great flavor! Will be adding this into rotation for dinner!

Very easy, but a bit too sweet for my family. Sort of tasted like french toast haha. I made it exactly as stated in recipe. It looked beautiful when plated.

Okay, I wouln't have picked this recipe, but my husband found it on his spinner for the iphone and sent it to me.  I must say, DELICIOUS!!!  Easy, is an understatement and just wonderful.  A recipe that you don't even have to look up once you've made it.  I have also used chpped walnuts and it was every bit as wonderful!!!

This recipe was easy & tasted great! I decided to make a few changes after cooking the first round. -In addition to the butter, I added a bit of extra virgin olive oil, which gave the pork a longer time to cook without burning. -My boneless pork chops were so thick, I had to cut them in half and then into strips  -Instead of cooking at medium-high heat to begin with, I cooked at a low-medium heat- then finished with a medium-high heat. -I replaced honey with light agave nectar and added a dash of low-sodium salt to the pecan topping -I also used organic flour to make it healthier

My husband and I thought it was a little too honeyed and sweet tasting. So I was kind of disappointed. Maybe I would have added some chicken broth or soy sauce to the sauce next time, if I choose to make it again, probably won't.

This meal was amazing!  My entire family loved it. (I don't ususally try new meals when company is coming, but I did with these pork chops and it was a crowd pleaser - and so easy!) The onions really calmed the sweetness of the glaze.

This was so easy to make. I didn't give it a five because I think it needed something to cut down on the sweetness. It was just a tad too sweet.

LOVED this!!! PERFECT if you have a bit of a sweet tooth! The savory pork chops work very well with the sweetness of the honey. I actually sprinkled the chops with cajun seasoning as they were cooking... I like a little kick with my sweet! LOVED IT!!

I made this for my husband who normally only eats fried foods.  I have been trying to get him away from everything fried. I made this one day and he loved it. He begged for a week straight for me to make it again.  I did not have any honey, so I used syrup and brown sugar instead. It also went very well with mashed sweet potatoes (which he also never ate and loved).

Great recipe! Very simple to make and quite delicious. I was concerned the honey would make the dish too sweet, but heating it on the stovetop thins the honey out a bit, making it more of a lightly sweetened glaze. Pecans were delicious with the pork. I used thick pork chops as I was cooking for only myself and didn't need a whole tenderloin. Since I was too lazy to pound them thin, I browned them on the stove and put them into the oven for 20 minutes, letting the drippings sit in the pan until the chops were ready. I will definitely be adding this into my regular dinner rotation.

This was fantastic and even better, it was EASY! I love to cook but sometimes you just want something that is quick and easy. The best thing about this, is it still has a gourmet feel while being easy. This is definitely be a dish I keep in my book for when I have a last minute dinner party. Thanks!

Easy recipe for sure.  I too added some dried onion to the frying pan to balance out the sweetness of the honey.  I found that I had to add some water to the pan to help make the sauce.   I would not recommend chops with the bone in, as it is just easier to enjoy this recipe with boneless chops.  All in all, it was just OK in my book though.

I added 1/2 c chicken stock, 1 Tbsp yellow mustard, and 1 Tbsp soy sauce.  I only browned the chops but didn't cook through.  Once I returned them to pan with all the ingredients, I simmered for about 10 min.  It was delicious!

Wasnt a very good recipe.......To sweet. I would rather have some ribs with someother trype of dressing. Needed some brown sugar for the pecans. Otherwise the pecans were good tasted like they could be on a pie. The rest......Could be better.......

Caramel pecan pork.  Very odd.  The meat turned out good and the sauce was good, but the two just did not go well together. It as definitely edible, but not something I would make again. Sauce is better suited over a sweet dough.

This was heavenly! I took the advice of other reviews and added some spices to the flour mixture as well as put steak seasoning on the pork before I floured it. Then, following another reviewer, I cut the pork into chunks so that the pecan and honey mixture coated every little bite. BRAVO!!!

This was very good. I did decrease the amount of flour like others had said. I used 1 Tbsp. flax seed oil and 1 Tbsp. butter, instead of 2 Tbsp. butter. Mainly for health reasons. It was excellent! Thank you.

I would have never thought of this combo, but I'm glad you did, these are great! I double the butter and add just a shot of maple syrup. And be sure not to over heat the sauce or it will be like candy! Thanks for the great chops!

This was so yummy!  I served it with mashed potatoes and cooked apples (cooked in honey, cinnamon and water), and my husband couldn't get enough.  I did cook the pork chops with about a fourth of a large onion, but I threw out that part because my husband hates the texture of onions.  I just did it for the flavor, and it was a great compliment to the sweetness of the honey.  I did add a little salt when I was heating the pecan honey sauce.

I made this almost exactly as stated.  It was amazing.  The pork chops were awesome.  We served them with garlic green beans for a salty kick and mashed sweet potatoes for a sweet/salty mix.  The appearance on the plate was so colorful and elegant.  Great recipe.

This sounded so wierd, but my family loved it! My hubby hates pecans even he loved it. I did add 1 tablespoon of butter to the honey pecan sauce. Seemed to make it a little richer. It's a keeper!

This was a pretty good recipe.  The mix of sweet with the pork was really good.  It's not something I'd want to eat every night but is great for something different.  We followed the recipe exactly except we used pork loin cut into 1 inch slices and it worked perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent - served with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The potatoes complimented the honey very well.  

I did the recipe just as is - except I subed cashews for pecans just because I prefer them.  VERY nice!

Wow, was this good! The only changes I made were as follows: 1. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter (it's better for us) 2. I omitted the pecans because I don't like nuts. The oil and honey mixture provided a really good glaze. It was wonderful. You could easily substitute any kind of meat. I want to try it with chicken next time. It was wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

A DEFINITE KEEPER FOR THE WINTER MONTHS. The only modification I did was adding a few Tblsp of maple syrup. I think this would have been great with some sweet potato in the middle of December.

This really was awesome.  I ate much more than my  usual share of meat with this recipe.  I followed a few other suggestions and added 1/4 cup of maple syrup and double the butter. Also incorporated the suggestion to pound out the meat with the seasonings...salt, pepper, garlic and tenderizer.  This was fabuloso!

Used 1/4 c. honey, then added bourbon until I had 1/3 c. of liquid.  Had 1.5 lbs. of boneless, butterfly chops.  Even after pounding they were too thick to cook quickly. So, I added the liquid and the pecans to the chops, and they simmered in the sauce.  Yum.  The sauce thickened before they were finished, so I added more honey, this time with OJ to meet the 1/3 c. mark.  The chops finished with a delicious honey glaze, and the sauce was perfect over rice.  Rave reviews.

I followed the advice of a few others and added the chicken broth, soy sauce, and sauteed onions. After browning the pork chops I poured the sauce over them and tossed it all into a 375° oven for around 15 or 20 minutes to finish cooking. It was my first time making pork chops and my first time having them any other way than how my mom always made them (pan fried) and I thought it was delicious. We served this with rice & steamed broccoli. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was quick, easy, and  absolutely delicious! I used maple syrup as some one else had recommended and, since I didn't have pecans, I used walnuts. Also, I added one finely chopped green apple.

The honey and pecans absolutely set off the taste of the pork chops.  Love this recipe.  Will be passing this along to family members.  Family really liked the recipe as well.

I wasn't too sure I was going to like this but the flavors blended perfectly. One of the best pork chop recipes I've ever tasted. My husband said he could have done without the pecans but I disagree. As another user said, the key is to not cook the honey pecan mixture too long. Mine didn't get hard like candy at all. Oh, and I didn't have a lot of drippings in the pan so I added a little extra melted butter.

What a great dish! So good! I followed the recipe exactly. Next time, I will add some ground ginger, garlic powder, and possibly ground mustard and cayene pepper for a kick!

This turned out great! I pretty much followed instructions, though I did double the butter as some people advised. It wasn't too sweet. I can't wait to make it again.

The meat is tender and the flavor is wonderful!  The trick is using extremely thin chops and don't overcook the topping.

This recipe was delicious.  I used regular bone-in pork chops and it still turned out great!  I didn't have any pecans on hand, so I used walnuts instead.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will definitely make it again!

Though this recipe has potential, in its original form, it is a bit bland.  I highly recommend some tweaking with spices, garlic, and onion.

I was inspired by this recipe. I changed a few things around. Instead of honey I added Maple syrup. Added elephant garlic. Sliced tart apples and changed chicken broth with apple juice. Used red sliced red onions.

I have been cooking these on occassion for a few years now. They are my husbands favorite kind of pork chops. I even made them for my mother in laws birthday dinner once, and she went back for seconds (she NEVER does that). I'd recommend adding more honey if you want a little extra sauce. This is a great dish if you love honey!

MY husband and I both loved this dish.  We didn't have pecans, so we used hazelnuts instead.  We also used about twice the amount of butter and added some maple syrup.  Good, quick dinner - not too sweet.

I made these tonight for dinner, they were very good.  I didn't try any of the substitutes mentioned in the reviews, but would possibly try some of them in the future.  It was on the sweet side but everyone loved them and they thought the presentation was beautiful.

Good but needs more flavours.  Suggest adding something spicy to the pecan glaze.  Also, salt an pepper the pork before you dredge in the flour.

This recipe only gets three stars because I had to alter it to make it good. Too much honey was making it too sweet so I substituted half the honey with sweet hot mustard. Double yum!

I thought these were TASTY, made them for a valentines dinner and they went over very well.  I did however use some of the suggestions like adding onions and garlic to the butter before browning the chops.  I also added a tablespoon of soy sauce and 1/3 cup of chicken broth.  PERFECT, and easy!

This was really good - my husband and I don't really like pork chops a lot so it's a personal challenge of mine to find a recipe we do like.  Pan fried is about our favorite way to cook them and this sauce just really adds a nice flavor.  It is really sweet (which is fine with me), I've made it a couple of times and may try to add a little chicken stock as others have suggested the next time. We use the boneless thin cut pork chops.

ok, these were REALLY sweet.  I will try it again but next time add a dash of soy sauce to the mixture as other reviewers suggest.  Pecans were a nice extra crunch texture with the pork. I will also season the pork more before I cook it.

This was yummy!  I used butterfly chops and browned them in butter then transferred them to the oven to finish cooking.  I also took the advice of some previous reviewers and used 1/2 cup chicken broth, a little soy sauce and maple syrup to taste.  It turned out great and I will make again!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

These are really quick, delicious and easy. I think though, that once you are finished browning the pork, more butter should be added before adding the honey. I really liked it that way. I have been cooking for my cousin and her family (she recently had twins), and they have requested it more than once.

I added about 1/2 cup chicken broth and a tbsp or two of soya sauce, as per the suggestion. I thought it was really delicious, as did my husband - although he thought they were still a bit too sweet for his taste.  Next time I will saute a chopped onion with the pork chop, as per previous suggestions.  I am not normally a fan of pork chops, but I really did like this recipe.  I will definately make them again.  My three year old loved the sauce (surprise - the kid lives for sugar!)

When i saw this recipe I thought it might be interesting, I was looking for something different to do with pork chops. I was delightfully surprised that my family LOVED it! I added the broth and soy sauce as one of the reviews suggested and cooked it for a few extra minutes just so the nuts were almost soft, but still a little firm. It was great, and I'll be adding it into my normal rotation! Thanks!

I was attracted to this recipe because it seemed so easy but was surprised at how good it is, absolutely the best chops I've ever had.  Who would have thought that honey and pecans would work so well with pork?

This recipe is outstanding.  I either doubled or tripled the sauce because it sounded so tasty.  It was gone on three pork chops.  My hubby was looking for left over sauce for the sweet potatoes.

I really liked this the first few bites, but I couldn't finish my entire portion. It was too sweet. Other reviews suggested I add chicken broth, but I didn't have any on hand so I just added water. Next time I make it, I'll definitely use chicken broth. Maybe that will make it less sweet.

A wonderful and simple meal to prepare. I also used some chicken broth and soy sauce along with the honey. The cutlets were tender, and the sauce complimented it very nicely.

Wow that was sweet! I did add chicken broth and soy sauce like was suggested but I guess not enough. I didn't have the problem of the sauce hardening but I used liquid honey. Maybe that makes a difference. I used turkey cutlets instead of pork. My husband loved it.

This was quite yummy.  I used Chinese 5 spice mixed w/ the flour and added the soy sauce, as suggested by other cooks.  It did seem to just be missing 'something'.  I will definitely make this again, but will probably add maple syrup to the honey sauce...or perhaps some lemon to give it a zing.

I served it with the 'spiced apple rice' also from allrecipes, and it was a nice complement, as the tart apple balances the sweet.

This was great, reminded me of a restaurant nearby that had butter pecan chicken, this was very close.  I can't wait to try it with chicken. I did add the chicken broth everyone mentioned and it made the sauce perfect... this is a keeper in our family!

I ended up adding some chicken broth to the sauce. The honey was too thick (and too sweet). You can really play with this recipe and make it the way you would enjoy it. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy and very tasty! My family loved it. I noticed others said the sauce got hard, I waited to add the honey and pecans to the drippings after it cooled. It did not get hard. I also substituted olive oil for the butter.I also added a touch of cinnamon like another reviewer suggested. IT was a nice touch.

Tasty meal but the pork left something to be desired. I would recommend pounding the pork into thin cutlets (to less than 1/2"). I added a little chicken broth as did another reviewer (toned down the sweetness). Will make again with thinner cutlets.

Very tender & delicious.  I made the following changes:  Added sauted onions & a dash of soy sauce to the honey mixture & cooked the pork in a little oil to reduce fat.  I only made 3 pieces of pork, and there was left over honey mix.

Totally amazing, and so simple. I could make this every night for dinner, but that may not be the healthiest diet. Just make sure you get the chops as thin as you can.

My husband loved this recipe and its really fast and easy to cook.I of course would also suggest doubling up on the "sauce". I used sliced almonds instead and it wasn't to my liking but my husbnad loved it. I also used cinnamon, but be careful and don't use too much because it will give it a akinda of wood taste.It is pretty sweet, and I haven't figured out what to put in it to make it less sweet and still taste good, so let me know if you find anything. Was pretty good though.

A pretty good recipe for pork chops.  Next time I would either fry them using cooking spray instead of butter, or grill them (all that butter leaves a heavy feeling in my stomach).

This was veyr simple and a nice change from the usual pork chop. I combined the ground nuts with 1/4 C of bread crumbs to give it a thicker coating. If you liked the taste of this, try the Baked Dijon Salmon recipe. It is very similar and a family favorite!

A little to sweet for me, but my hubby liked it enough.  Kids didn't want to go near it.

Honey and pecans ... my husband's favorites!  These were quick and easy, and he loved them.  They look and taste like you spent way more time on them than you actually have to. Great recipe!

I am not a pork fan, but my husband enjoyed these.  I doubled the nuts, honey, and butter, but would problably not double the nuts next time, since it seemed like there was a lot of nuts...but my husband liked it anyway.  I definitey recommend doubling the sauce. :)

This recipe was yummy and simple to make.  I would use some more of the pecan/honey mixture next time.  I also added some butter in the mixture to thin it out slightly.

This was so easy to make and the flavor was very good.  Next time I will spice up the pork chops a bit more to appreciate the contrast between the spice and the honey.  My husband raved about them.

For the newly married cook, this pork chop recipe is fabulous!!  I grew up with my mom simmering pork chops for hours, and in the end, they had a  beefy flavor.  I was convinced that all pork chops weren't for me.  This recipe is so easy to make, and it looks very chic in a dish - with the honey-pecan sauce on top.  When you taste it for the first time, it is a "wow" moment.  I wish everything I cook could be met with this much awe and delight by my husband.

Thank you Karena!

These are a very fast, easy, dinner dish with minimal clean up. We tried them with twice baked sweet potatoes.  A lil too much sugar for one dinner.  I would have to say making them with more honey and pecans would be necessary, we ran out of the yummy glaze too soon.

I served these with honey pecan roasted potatoes and fresh plain steamed green beans. The dish was heavenly. For once, I followed a recipe almost exactly, although I used a little water to deglaze the pan before adding the honey and pecans. I would suggest a dry white wine to accompany this dinner and fresh strawberries and mango yogurt for dessert.
My man was very appreciative of this meal.

I thought this was fantastic.  I also added a little more butter as other reviews had indicated.  My husband would have probably preferred less pecans, but I thought it was great.  Good use of pecans frozen from X-mas!

My Family really liked this recipe! I used bone-in chops because that is what I had on hand. It still turned out great! I added extra butter as other reviews had mentioned.It didn't thicken as quick. I dredged the chops in the sauce instead of pouring over. YUM!

Great recipe!  The sauce thickened very quickly, and became a little too thick for our tastes while eating - will probably add more butter next time.  Will make this again.

Because of the sweatness of the sauce, I have served it with rice which I have cooked with one of the ALLRECIPES receipes (with bay leaves, peas and onion) It was a good contrast in taste and a perfect match.  I will use it the next time I have people over for dinner.

This was great, but have tenderloins run through the tenderizer at the meat shop to make sure they are nice and thin so they cook fast.

Turned out really sweet when I made it following the recipe exactly. It is really easy and pretty though so I may make it again and add a little balsamic vinegar to tone down the sweet?

I had purchased pork loin from the store and came across this recipe.  It turned out amazing. I did substitute honey for agave and walnuts for pecans because that’s what I had on hand and it turned out amazing. Definitely a keeper .

This was okay. I gave it 3 stars for the easy recipe, but it was not super flavorful. Tasted like pork chops in a nutty maple syrup.

Good recipe. I made with walnuts. I will probably try to make a thicker sauce next time...with some corn starch.  Sauce was a little tangy, but stink good. play around with the flavors and you will get the sauce you want. Definitely a keeper!

I didn't pound the pork chops thin, just sauteed them as they were.  I liked this recipe and so did my husband.  I will make it again.  I didn't have quite enough honey so augmented with orange marmalade.  Put this over the top of cooked pork chops and you really have a dish!
Update:  Also good with marmalade no honey.

This was a big hit with the family; I was told that if I ever open a restaurant to add this to the menu, lol. I soaked the pork chops in a brine before using them in this recipe which gave a perfect sweet and salty combo, and skipped the flour. The pecans' texture really make this an interesting pork chop dish. 10/10 would recommend, and I'll definitely be making this again soon.

I followed the recipe as written other than using butterfly chops (what I had on hand).  Delicious! The family enjoyed it and everyone went back for seconds. Picky daughter even asked to take some in her lunch tomorrow.

This recipe was quick and very easy. I did add soy sauce, maple syrup along with the honey and pecans. I stirred it till the sauce caramelized a bit, then I put the pork chops back in for a bit. I really liked the combo of salty and sweet I ended up with. Will be making this again.

This could not be easier to make, and it's delicious. The first time I made it I used the pork loin cutlets and pounded them thin. The second time I used pretty thin port chops with a very small bone left in them. The second time was better because they were a little more moist. It's important not to overcook them. The sauce takes less than two minutes to make and is delicious.  The whole dinner was ready in 20 minutes start to finish (including vegetables).

I made this almost exactly as written.   I used nice quality pork chops and cooked the floured chops on the side burner of my grill.  (I like to use that whenever possible to keep grease and spatter out of the kitchen.)
When the chops were cooked and browned, I removed them and turned down the heat, and quickly added the honey and pecans.   I left the pan on the burner only until the honey was melted and the drippings were blended in.  Then I poured the mixture over the chops while it was still very hot.
These were absolutely delicious!  Sweet, yes - but fabulous!

Surprisingly easy to make considering pork chops are easy to overcook. It turned out moist and I love the simplicity of the sauce. Very easy and quick to make; delicious.

I made a few subs. I used crushed walnuts since I didn’t have pecans, I used olive oil to brown the chops instead of butter and I added a dash of soy sauce like other reviewers mentioned. Everyone loved it!!! I would make again and try with Pecans

It is with some regret that I sit here and choke these "candied" yet still bland pork chops down.  On the plus side I don't feel like I wasted food because it is edible and very pretty.  It is just too sweet for my taste and the actual pork had zero flavor.  Will not try again

Very easy and tasty.  Used thin cut boneless  porkchops.   Cooked very quickly and remained tender.   Used a large nonstick frypan and returned the browned chops to the pecan honey mixture to keep it warm.  Served with roasted red potatoes and fresh peas.  Will  make again as it is so easy.

After reading other reviews,  I  decided to add the maple syrup and also seasoned the pork steaks  (that's what I used) with garlic pepper seasoning . Turned out great! I will make it again!

I loved the recipe but I didn't have any honey so used maple syrup instead.   The sauce seemed a little thick so I threw a splash of white wine into it.  My husband said, "I hope you make this again soon!"  I definitely will be making it again.  It is so fast and festive.

Just as another cook did,  I added 1/4 cup pure maple syrup for sauce PLUS I added 1/4 cup sliced green onion tops and browned in the butter prior to adding the syrup and honey. Do not over cook your pork so it remain moist. Be sure to simmer the sauce until it thickens.  Finely chopped pecans work best.

This was an excellent recipe.  I did take the advice from others and made the following changes.  I made it with 4 med. boneless pork chops.  I added salt  and pepper to the flour mixture.  I sautéed 1/4 cup chopped onions and 4 cloves garlic before adding the honey and pecans.  I also added some white wine and a couple of drops of chili sauce to the sauce.  It was so good.  I will add this to our meal rotation.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

After Reading the reviews of several review were's I opted to sauté some finally chopped onion and garlic in the butter prior to browning the pork chops. Very flavorful recipe. One thing I would recommend is that you have the rest of the meal ready to go when it's time to put the honey in the pecans in the pan. Simply warming them quickly and putting them on the Porkchop what do you want to run test results. Mine had to stay in the pan for a bit resulting in the caramelization of the honey and pecans. Still tasted good just was not a sauce it was more of a spread. Very easy recipe and it made a hit with our guests. It will definitely be in our recipe rotation.

I followed the instructions to a tee.  My family loved it.  I was careful to put nuts on the pieces of my wife and mine.  The other family members don't like nuts. It's quick and easy.  It could be in the rotation for three times a month.

Be very careful to have heat on low when adding honey and pecans.  Stir and heat only until sauce is warmed.

Great recipe but chops got kind of sticky after the honey cooled so I used honey roasted pecans from the store and didn't heat the honey.

I'm not a huge pork chop fan in general, but anything my picky kids will eat is good by me!  This is a standby in our house - I tend to season a bit liberally with salt to give a balance to the sweetness of the honey.  It could not be easier!

The topping is the only thing that gives these pork chops flavor. Once you get past the honey and pecans, there isn't anything substantial to the pork chops underneath. I advise seasoning the flour or chops with something other than just salt and pepper, like cumin and paprika or garlic and sage. Something to give the pork a bit more flavor with each bite.

We made it as is, scaled up for 6 chops. Excellent taste, best pork I've had. Only critique is the recipe was a bit vague on cook time/recommended temperature for pork, sauce. Will definitely make this again.

This is an awesome recipe both in taste and ease to make. I did add a few dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and Soy Sauce to the recipe. The next time I make it I'm going to use genuine maple syrup instead of the honey.

Delicious!  I'm giving it 4 stars because I added 1 tbsp paprika to the flour mixture to give it more flavor and next time I'm probably going to double the honey and pecans.  I'll dredge the cooked cutlets through the glaze and then put whatever is left on top of the meat when I plate it.  Thank you for the recipe!  I'll certainly be making it again.

Okay, so I really thought this recipe would be amazing, and though the meat was very tender, the flavor was just okay. You would think all the butter would really make this dish ridiculously good--it should be for how unhealthy it probably is--but I'd say it's not really worth the caloric intake. To be fair, I've never made pork chops that I loved, so maybe I just don't like pork chops. I think I'll stick to other cuts of meat.

This was just okay. My hubby didn't care for it too much.  Even though I added a few extra spices to the flour, it was still a little on the bland side. It was for sure quick and easy to make. Perhaps some honey mustard or sautéed onions would help.

This is insanely good!!! Used pork sirloin chops because they were cheaper. No need to pound thin either.  Definitely add extra butter.. honey.. pecans and some maple syrup (recipe doesnt call for but adds a little something extra)  so you have enough sauce for every bite! Will make again very soon. Make these.. you will lick your plate clean!

Amazing flavor!!! I also roasted some baby gold potatoes with carrots as a side dish. Easy prep, cook and clean up.

Ehh. They were ok, but they needed something - soy sauce maybe? - to keep them from tasting like pork chops topped with sundae topping.

I added ground ginger and fresh chopped rosemary to the dredge. It gave the chops a savory flavor and mixed with the sweet, it was delicious and my Husband said it has to be a once a week thing.

Followed the recipe exactly. The pork loin chops were cooked perfectly--five minutes on each side on medium-high heat. They were perfect by themselves. I was disappointed with the honey sauce because it hardened as it cooled, and my husband thought the honey and pecan sauce was too sweet. I will try this again and follow other suggestions to add soy sauce, maybe a dash of beef or chicken broth, to the sauce to liquify it more.

Got all thumbs up around the table. Very delicious! Did follow some of the advice. Doubled the butter and added garlic powder to the flour mixture. We used boneless pork chops since that was what was on sale.

My my, what a recipe.  Absolutely loved this, so delicious and simple. During the browning process I added small pats of butter on each side of the skillet because 2 tablespoons was barely enough.  After I browned them for a good 8 minutes on each side I put them in my preheated oven to keep them warm so I could make the honey glaze.  I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and was quite impressed. I've been looking at it for quite some time now and very pleased with the results. I am thinking this honey & pecan glaze would be great with salmon fillets as well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper.

Followed the advice of others and added a little more butter, maple syrup, and a touch of soy sauce. Heavenly! Just added this to my "favorites" folder.

Made this recipe last night using pork sirloin steaks.  Not sure we pounded the steaks thin enough (probably shouldn't have used extra thick cuts).  Cooking took much longer than the recipe recommended, and I was worried the meat would be tough and dry, but it turned out moist and very tender.  My husband, who does not usually like any sweetness in meat dishes, declared this delicious (and I concurred) and enthusiastically agreed that it should become a regular on our table.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Thought this was very good and quick to prepare. I used a little more butter and cooked red onion till well done. When the pork was done I left the onion and added the honey and pecans. Used more than the recipe stated for both of those.  I think the onion gave it a lot of flavor. Will definitely make again.

I was a bit doubtful, but my all of the kids, from my 3 year old to the 45 year old liked this one!  I made some modifications.  First, I always soften my meat by adding a bit of baking powder and oil, which I did in the morning, along with some salt and pepper.  

I had to keep changing the butter during frying as it went very brown, so I wiped the pan out twice during the process, using kitchen towels.  I made the sauce separately using fresh butter and a mixture of honey and maple syrup.  It was incredibly sweet at this point, (even for me and I have a very sweet tooth), so I added some water, light soy and a dash of lemon juice and some more butter.  I let it all thicken up a bit then poured it over the pork.  Also, here in Qatar we can't get Pecans, so I used walnuts.  Everyone has asked to for it again.  I will try it with chicken as pork is hard to come by here, being a Muslim country.

In fact I am so pleased with this recipe I am going to post on our Doha Mums website that I made it, so others can try.  A definite winner.  I served it along with the Apple Spiced Rice, from this site.

I used thick pork chops so I browned them in a pan and then baked for 40 mins. Added 1/2 cup chicken broth and a few splashes of soy sauce to the original recipe and poured over the chops before baking at 350. Very delicious and tender.

Fantastic item but do not overcook! I used choppd cashews instead since I did not have pecans in the house. I put the pork back on lower setting the pan after cooking and mixed the honey there. I think using a mallot to make chops thinner was a key step to not overcooking as well.

Just tried this and we loved it. I did double the butter based on need because I had close to 2 pounds of pork. I should have made more sauce to compensate for the additional meat. That said, the recipe is very simple and equally delicious. I will be making this again.

TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  I used flour and added an equal amount of crushed Saltine crackers which I pressed onto the porkchops.  Gives it a nice texture.  I also added a little Soy Sauce to the honey glaze like others suggested but just a little.  I also added more butter & honey for more sauce to cover the chops.  Super easy.

Delicious, even my 5 and 6 yr olds are eating it.  I skipped the flour, and seasoned with a tiny bit of onion powder, I added extra butter cause it was low on liquid.  I used Pork Sirlion Cutlets instead of chops.  My Husbands words were "Oh God, thats good!"

This was interestingly different!! I wasn't sure if I would like it because I've never had pork chops topped with any type of sauce, but these were pretty good. I was the only one that would top the meat with it :-( but it only took a few minutes to make the sauce so I'm not too hurt by that LOL. Very good if you like sweet stuff on your meat.......

These pork chops live up to their name...they are AWESOME!  They are very sweet though so may not appeal to everyone.  I love that the recipe is simple and easy to make.

This was a pretty good dinner that can be fixed quickly.  I also added some maple syrup to the sauce.  This was good with mashed sweet potatoes with cinnamon, cayenne pepper and maple syrup.

This was yummy.  My chops did turn out a little dry, but that's probably because I cooked them a bit too long.  I served this with the Carrot-Sweet Potato Mash from this site.  I'd like to try this with chicken.

Delicious! Just made a few changes:   added 1/2 tsp sage,  1/2 tsp cajun spice, and  1/2 tsp ground ginger,  along with salt and pepper, to the flour mixture;   added a few dashes  ginger and cajun spice  to the pecan mixture using  maple syrup instead of honey.   Also, we seared the chops and then baked them for 25-30 minutes at 350° until cooked thouroughly.  Then poured the pecans/syrup mixture over. SO GOOD.

I made these last night and my husband LOVED them! I made some adjustments by using chicken breasts,adding a little garlic powder to the flour, and for the pecan glaze, I used maple syrup & 1 tsp of brown sugar. DELICIOUS!

Rarely do my kids clean all the meat off of their plate. I'm happy to say this was one of these times! I added a 1/4 cup of maple syrup like some recommended. Every one thought it was great and VERY sweet! A little sauce goes a LONG way!

This recipe was delicious and easy.  We had two really thick pork chops, so we cut them into 1-inch cubes to pan fry.  We also sauteed one small onion for the sauce, it cut the sweetness of the honey.  Thanks, it was wonderful!

Definitely one of my best looking dishes, and it was super easy.  This recipe is what it is-- honey on otherwise bland pork chops.  Next time I'll try to season the pork some more and maybe use less honey.  It was a bit sweet for me.

If you LOVE the honey/nut flavor of this recipe, try cutting the pork into small chunks; thereby wrapping up every little piece with the sauce (: Stir well, cover and simmer for a few minutes, then cool a few more to let the sauce really stick to the meat. YUM!

So delicious!  I followed the recipe except used walnuts (I think pecans would have been great but I used what I had on hand). Also, I added to the honey/pecan mixture a dash of soy sauce and a tsp of orange marmalade.  I will make these again for sure!

We don't eat pork, so I substituted chicken breasts. The recipe was simple and delicious and not overly sweet like I had expected. Definitely will make again.

I took the advice of others and doubled the butter. I love the taste of candied pecans and found this an interesting combo of flavors. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very decilious. I think it does need a little bit more seasoning, but I'm not sure what to add. Overall it was great though.

These pork chops got an "OH MY GOD" approval from my husband.  Pork chops NEVER get such comments in our home, as we both kind of find them to be "blah" most of the time, boring and dry.  Not these.  I followed the recipe to the letter, though I was initially a little bit hesitant about such a "sweet" recipe for pork chops.  It was perfect and delicious.  My husband had seconds (and would have had thirds if there'd been enough!) and the next day called me from work and said he missed them.  Ha!  My 2 and a half year old daughter loved them too.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  I'll be making these OFTEN!

Something just wasn't right about this...I would have added more honey.  Not enough to balance the saltiness of the chops.  Probably won't make again.

Awesome Indeed!! I wasn't sure if I would like this as we are big on Pecans in our family, but since it had such high ratings I figured I would try it anyway and see what all the hype was about. WELL, it was soooo good! I love the sauce. Note: I did make the following adjustments: I doubled the recipe for my large family, added 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 2 tsp of crushed ginger, and 1/4 cup of Carribbean Rum Marinade by Cinnamon Bay. I am definitely making this again. In fact I think it would be a good sauce for sliced brined Thanksgiving Turkey Breast.

Awesome is how to describe this pork recipe.  I doubled the recipe and therefore had to use more butter to accomodate multiple batches in the pan.  I ate the leftovers for breakfast.  MMmmh

Beautiful presentation but very blah in flavor.  Made exactly as stated in recipe.  Definitely not kid-friendly - I was hoping the sweetness would win them over but it didn't.  I wouldn't mind trying them again if I could think of a way to jazz up the sauce.  I'll have to dig deeper into the reviews.

Hubby was skeptical, but after dinner announced this recipe was a keeper! After browning the chops I let the pan cool a little so it wouldn't turn the honey and butter into caramel, but I obvioubly didn't wait long enough.  As soon as I put the honey in it immediately turned dark brown and thick like caramel.  I added more butter and honey after it cooled and just a little maple syrup to thin it out a little.  I don't think I used a whole 1/4 cup pecans, still plenty even after adding addtl honey & butter. Very, very good!

I hate it when people review recipes after making large adjustments to them, so I made this as written.  It was SOOOO good!  I generally don't like sweet meat, but wanted to try something new!  I was SO happy I did!  My husband and my two year old also loved it!  YUM!

I thought this was pretty good but my 2-year-old loved it and as he's picky, especially about meat, this will definitely be a repeat. I think all that honey made it kid-friendly, although I found it a smidge over the top.

It was REALLY really good. Only problems I encountered was that for some odd reason, there were no pan drippings after I made the meat. But then again, it was my first time making pork chops so perhaps it's my fault. Also, the pecans kept falling off the pork chops and didn't quite stick like I would imagine they should, but it still was very tasty! I ate it with worchester sauce though, for added flavor. Instead of green beans as a side, I ate instant mashed potatoes mixed with corn, tomato chunks, some kind of noodles, and black beans. Sounds odd, but it was very good, both my husband and I really like it! And it wasn't at all expensive!

Yummy! I bought thin cut pork cutlets, so I didn't have to pound the meat. It was so easy to make and my family enjoyed it very much. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was perfect! It was so simple and quick to make and even my picky eaters absolutely loved it.  The only alteration that I made was to add some onion flake to the glaze while it was cooking as some other reviewers had suggested.

I really enjoy this recipe, although I think that giving it a five star rating is somewhat iffy, given that I've never made the recipe as is. Based on other reviews I always add anywhere from 1/4-1/2 cup of (veg) broth as well as some soya sauce, and white wine or cooking sherry. Another addition I make, that I don't think I've seen here is adding apples. I usually chop them up and heat them through with the honey and pecans. Once everything has been cooked and mixed together, I use the oven to finish the dish off.

Family loved this - even my 10 year old. I used seasoned dried bread crumbs instead of flour (was out of flour! gasp! only had bread flour on hand and did not want to use that)Also used almonds instead of pecans but both have a lovely flavor when roasted.  The almonds were good but pecans would have more flavor and roasted sweetness. I did toast them before using.  Will be sure to buy some pecans to try again. I used thick cut pork loin chops that I had in the freezer.  They stayed juicy and tender.  Fantastic as is but will play with the flavors more next time for fun.  They did not have a strong flavor, so we drizzled extra honey over at the dinner table when served.  With the carmelized honey and dried bread crumbs/flour it does get quite dark brown while cooking.  Just cut into the meat to see if it is done, do not rely on the exterior color. The outside was a bit crispy and dark around the edges and was fantastic that way.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Not bad.  I liked the flavor, I didn't add any of the pecans (none on trees, to cheap to buy) but I think it would be even better with them.  Still seems like something else was missing.

All my friends loved this meal.  I doubled the recipe and the four of us scarfed it all down.  I did add maple syrup as suggested.  And now I can experiment with savory flavors or maybe even cranberries and OJ.

I really liked this recipe, but unfortunately it wasn't a hit with my husband. He thought it was too sweet. I will possibly make it again for myself sometime though.

These pork chops were fast and delicious; literally from prep to the table in 30 minutes. I didn't have any regular honey so I used raspberry honey instead, and they were fabulous.

This dish was excellent! My 2 year old loved it! The pecans were a little heavy for my husband, so I will lighten that up next time. I took the other advice and added some soy sauce, lemon juice, and maple syrup. It was a little too sweet, so I will add some chicken broth next time. All in all SUPERB!

awesome.  i was too lazy to buy pecans (that ok, less fattening) but it was awesome.  and its sooo simple.  although the glaze hardened after cooling so that was a bit odd eating a candied pork chop haha

This dish rocked.  I didn't have flour so I used pancake mix.  I also sweetened up the sauce with pancake syrup.  Added a little onion too.  Overall it tasted a little like pancakes.  Delicious.

I just made these the other night for the first time and they were great - even the kids ate them.  We didn't have any soy sauce to add as some reviews suggested, but will probably give that a try next time just to see what it does to the sauce.

My family loved this recipe.  Here is what I did:  doubled the sauce - added 2 tbsp lemon 2 tbsp soy sauce and 4 tbsp honey.  Hubby said it was still a bit too sweet so I added a dash of chicken stock and this mellowed it out.  It was a big hit! Thanks for a great recipe!

These pork chops were delicious. Though the loin of pork is usually the driest and toughest cut, this recipe avoid that. my pork shops were juicy, tender and very tasty!

I added 1/4 syrup & added extra butter.  I ended up simmering the pork chops in the mixture for about 20 minutes, covered (I was surprised nothing stuck to the pan).  These were very good.

Oh wow, that is all I can say about this one. I served this over rice, and added just a dash of soy sauce to the sauce. We will be having this for our Christmas dinner this year but with chicken.

My husband and 2 year old loved these pork chops. The only thing I did different was use walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had on hand. Great and easy recipe!

LOVED THIS RECIPE.  It was so easy and delicious.  I have added it to my fall musts recipes.  I am going to make it for a dinner party next since it was so simple.  My husband was thrilled with this recipe.  Paired with some wild grain rice and nice acorn squash it was absolutely perfect. Thanks!

I tried this with pork first and my hubby loved it.  Tried it with chicken breast tenderloins next, and my hubby loved it.  First time (pork) I mistakenly used walnuts instead of pecans.  Second time, used pecans.  Both good.  Also, I added some canned sweet potatoes (cubed), to the sauce just because I had them on the shelf and was going to serve as a side dish anyway.   Turned out to be a tasty addition.  I like pork better, hubby liked chicken.  Will make both again.

This is a very good recipe. I added soy sauce to the honey. If you choose to do this, I would omit adding salt to the flour. I used walnuts rather than pecans. Very good.

Like another/other review(s) my "sauce" turned out more like hardened taffy on top of the chops.  If I can figure out how to prevent this from happening, I'd love to make them again - the flavors were excellent.

Great recipe!  Very easy & quick. I substituted chops for chix breast. I also added seasonings to the flour, used twice the butter & added chix broth & maple syrup.  It did taste like candy, but we like that! Served with red potatoes & corn!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was extremely easy and for someone who doesn't usually eat pork (maybe once every two years or so), I had seconds.  Remember the KEY as stated by the recipe~DO NOT overcook the pork or the sauce.  I was afraid I was going to eat this raw, but it wasn't.  It was very juicy and my whole family liked it.

Instead of Pork Chops, I did boneless chicken breasts and they were AWESOME!  My husband said it was absolutely the best chicken he has ever had.  I can hardly wait to try it on the porkchops.

Wonderful!  The perfect blend of savory and sweet.  Seasoning the flour w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley prior to browning was the only change I made.  Simple and delicious meal.

Made this recipe with one change - marinate the pork first. Was pretty tasty but then forgot the pecans (oops). I can't imagine it would have been that tasty without letting it marinate for awhile. May make again with some changes and, of course, the pecans.

These were ok.  A little dry, but good flavor.  Also, my honey got really hard in the pan.  I had the heat turned super-low when I added it, so I don't know why.  Some of it even stuck in my teeth!  Served w/Baked Sweet Potatoes from this site and steamed broccoli.

This one was a hit with my family .. the kids actually ate the pork chops before anything else. I used 3 very thick rather large pork chops abd followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a little more butter while browning the chops. I would say we could have added a little more honey because it was barely sweet at all just a hint, almost perfect

I added 1/2 c chicken broth and 1Tbsp soy sauce as well as a few dashes of garlic salt.  Honestly, the recipe would probably have been good enough without the additions.  It IS rather sweet, but we LOVE honey so it was perfect for us.

I've never made pork chops before, but this recipe seemed easy. It was!  The presentation was BEAUTIFUL and the taste was tender but sort of bland.  Can't figure out what's missing, but it needs something more flavorful.  Hubby and I both said "it's OK."

WAY WAY too sweet, even after adding some chicken stock and 1 TBSP soy sauce.  It definately has potential.  Next time I'll try less honey and more stock.

These pork chops are one of my new favorite foods.  I added chicken broth (about 1/3 cup) and a sprinkling of soy sauce as per other reviews, because my husband doesn't like things to be overly sweet, but I'm sure doing it the original way is wonderful.  I served the extra sauce over rice and that was DELICIOUS.  I highly recommend serving it that way!

This was just o.k.  It was easy & quick to prepare, but lacked something.  The breading on the chops turned out mushy, which I hate.  I added a 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 1 tbls soy sauce as recommended and I think it helped.  Not too sweet.  It still needed something, however.  Perhaps a few cloves of freshly minced garlic.  Wouldn't be opposed to making it again, but would do some tweeking.  I think it has potential.

I made this recipe with the soy sauce and chicken broth added as per previous reviews, and it was wonderful.  My husband didn't really care for the pecans, though, so I will omit them the next time I make this.

I used bone-in thin cut pork chops worked great.  Juicy and good flavor but not awesome to me.

Awesome recipe!  Overcooked the sauce a little bit so it was a tad bit gummy.  Neat taste, don't eat it if you don't like SWEET STUFF.

Delicious…..I cooked these for Christmas Eve dinner (8 adults and 6 kids) and what a hit.  My mom who does not like pork chops thoroughly enjoyed them and my father devoured the remaining 3 chops the next day.  I joined suit with the many others and added the soy sauce and chicken broth to the mixture.  I have cooked these at least 4 times since Christmas since my wife and 20-month-old loves them.  My mom has taken the recipe and prepared them several times for my dad also.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe, along with my fantastically picky 7 year old.  The nuts were wonderfully added texture.  The only down side was that my 5 year old and 3 year old DID NOT like them.  I believe it is because they prefer their meats to be more "spicey".  Nevertheless, I will fix it again, and they will just have to deal with it!

A little too sweet for us. Did sautee some onions with the butter before adding cutlets, was a good addition to counter the sweetness.

We only had thick chops so I grilled them first than topped with the sauce, I like the taste of honey so I did not use any chicken broth as other reviewers suggested and  I thought it turned out very good.  Thanks

This was so easy and fast.  Our family gave it a 4 1/2 to 5 Star Rating.  I made just a little extra sauce and returned the cutlets to the pan to coat in the sauce before serving.

This recipe was okay, but it lacked any complexity of flavor, coming out very sweet and honey-tasting.  I cooked it exactly as the directions suggested, so I was a little disappointed, since it had received such great reviews previously.

Delicious! I love the sweetness combined with pork. The sauce hardens quickly and does stick to your teeth sometimes but to me it's worth it because it tastes so great. I double the sauce.

This recipe was wonderful!  Very similar to a local restaurant (they have a caramel sauce for the pork) and I have been searching for a sauce similar to theirs.  I made this for my roommates, and we all loved it!  It was pretty sweet and I was going to add some soy sauce as some had suggested, but I didn't have any.  I'd like to try that next time.

This was pretty good!  A little too sweet for my taste but my husband likes sweet dinners so this will be his new favorite.  I cut the recipe in half enough for two chops.
