This is a very good cocktail. However, I tend to stay away from orange juice because it worsens my heartburn. Instead, I tried the exact same drink except substituted peach nectar for orange juice and added a shot/ jigger of grenadine on top. It was like a pineapple/ peach sunrise. Absolutely delicious!

This is really good!  We used pineapple orange juice to streamline things.  Yum :)

This was very yummy.  Alas, I had no coconut rum so I used Capt. Morgans and just a tiny drop of coconut flavoring.  YUMMO!

This is an amazing tropical cocktail. I love cocktails with Malibu coconut rum, when I drink them, I am in heaven. I used carbonated water and squeezed lime and lemon juice to it. And I used less carbonated water then the recipe calls for. This is a great treat that I will add to my cocktail collection.

I love this summer drink.  I use pineapple orange juice, do away with the sprite and splash a little Amaretto on top.  Delicious.

Perfect for a hot summer afternoon.  Nice and spritz-"y."  Very much like a wine cooler.

I'm not typically a big fan of coconut, but this is a great drink!  Coconut is not overpowering at all.  Not too sweet and just enough fizz to make it light tasting.  I used pineapple orange juice instead of separate juices.  Will be making these again soon!

My new favorite drink! Which surprises me because I'm not usually not a big fruity drink person! Must be the pineapple juice! Oh I used cherry seven up instead of regular. Thanks for the recipe so yummy!

I just recently turned 21 and this is the 1st drink I made. It's delicious and you can't taste the alcohol at all!
