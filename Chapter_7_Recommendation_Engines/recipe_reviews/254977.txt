I made a full meal on the BBQ and this bread was definitely a hit. I used grated parmesan cheese and mayonnaise made from avocado oil. Very good! ;-)

I wasn't really sure what to expect with this and even thought the mayo mixture would create a thick crust on the bread but it didn't. In fact, we couldn't really taste the mayo in the end. That's okay thought because I am not a huge fan of mayo. This was really good and the grill marks make for a pretty presentation. I plan on trying this next with a truffle infused butter.
