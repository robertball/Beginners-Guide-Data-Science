Very good but it made so much it surprised me! I added great northern beans and some seasonings (oregano basil garlic and a bit of cayenne pepper). I let it sit in the crockpot for the day and it was yummy! Although don't add the macaroni until an hour or so before you eat it otherwise they will grow too big!

Good soup base needs lots of seasoning. I didn't like the whole tomatoes floating around I had to fish them out and whirl them in the food processor. Makes a lot! Good to freeze.

Awesome! My husband and children all loved this recipe. Instead of using only corn I used mixed veggies and it was just as good. I will definitely remake this again!

The flavor was very good with this soup. Had a little problem with the way it looked as in the cauliflower in the red broth. This was a little bit of a turn off to us. However if that doesn't bother you it has a nice flavor and it is different from the run of the mill soup.

This is a pretty good simple soup. It's really filling and quite inexspensive. I did add quite. Bit of seasonings though. It makes a a lot! We will have this again. Really good with some oyster crackers. The only thing is thAt I don't think the macaroni should be added until right at the very end. They were extra big and overdone. Otherwise great!
