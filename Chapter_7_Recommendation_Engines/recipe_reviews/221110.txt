Most buttercream frosting recipes are good, especially with some tweaking.  This one is excellent without it.  Rich, smooth,creamy and not too sweet.  A little less powdered sugar in this recipe than most makes all the difference.  I didn't add the pecans, and chose to sprinkle the coconut on top, but with or without those additions, this is one of the best buttercream frostings around. However, I always use hi-ratio shortening in any frosting recipe calling for shortening and it, too, makes all the difference.  One recipe generously frosted 12 cupcakes.

This was so so so yummy! Everyone loved it! I made a few adjustments that worked really well. Instead of shortening I used 3/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of coconut oil (virgin, cold pressed). It gave the icing a subtle coconut flavour and lovely smoothness. I also didn't add any coconut into the frosting itself, just toasted on the outside. Thank you for the amazing recipe, I will definitely be making this again :)

Wow! So for me, I was looking for a recipe that didn't include anymore egg whites-I already used 3 for my cake- that would go along with my coconut cake. 
This icing is LOVELY. (I made this for mother's day and excluded the pecans-my mom's allergic) I also just put in a few hand fulls of coconut rather than a full bag, just enough for flavor. 
Once I iced my cake, I covered it with full on coconut chunks (unsweetened). It looked beautiful!

I used 1 stick of butter, 4 cups of confectioners sugar, 1/4 cup of milk and 1.5 tsp of vanilla extract and beat by hand. I tossed in two small handfuls of pecan chips and toasted 1 cup of coconut in the toaster oven, then crumbled it by hand when it was cool before mixing it into the frosting. WOW I can't believe how delicious it is on my Extreme Chocolate Cake (also on allrecipes.com)! Give it a try and I think you'll agree!

No nuts and coconut was finely chopped into the cake ... but the frosting was divine!  I use coconut milk in place of whole milk ... made the frosting really smooth.

Yummy frosting! Love the consistency by using 1 cup less of powdered sugar than my standard frosting. Tastes great on white cupcakes.

This is an excellent frosting.  It spread really well and the coconut flavor didn't overwhelm.  I took away one star because I found it overly sweet, even on my spice cake which can usually withstand a sweet icing.  I'll probably try it again, but maybe instead of half butter and half shortening, I'll divide them into thirds with cream cheese.

This is a great recipe for buttercream. Instead of vanilla, I use coconut extract so you can it really tastes the coconut and I use about 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons. It's not too much at all. I always get requests for coconut cupcakes now.

Made this last night to go with a chocolate fudge cake and it was a hit! I had planned on taking a picture, but, sadly, the only evidence that there was even a cake to begin with are the lingering crumbs on my husbands plate!

I did do a few small modifications: 
#1 - I used only half the amount of vanilla extract added a tsp of coconut extract. Soooooo yummy!
#2 - I added 3/4 of a bag of coconut instead of half. 

This will definitely be going into our "keep" folder Thanks so much for the recipe, Rizzy!

I made this icing, but I left out the coconut/nuts and added cocoa. Awesome consistency and taste! Cupcake snobs at my office were raving about it. My new go to buttercream recipe.

Good recipe, but if icing a two layer cake do a 1 1/2 recipes as it just barely covered the cake. Also added coconut flavoring as well.

This is a good basic buttercream icing recipe. Not too sweet and very fluffy. I made it with the black magic cake also from this site. It was the perfect finishing touch.

Superb. I could envision my arteries clogging, but this frosting is so good. I did make some small changes. I used 3/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of shortening. Also I processed the pecans to tiny pieces and mixed them in with the coconut. I smoothed it over a "Black Magic" chocolate cake and topped it with some toasted coconut. The frosting held up well. It was delicious.

A good basic  frosting that you can work with.  I read a lot of reviews, and added some cream of coconut as well as coconut extract.  I found unsweetened organic dried coconut flakes, and used those. They were a little drier and  thicker than the packaged flakes, but I loved the taste!

Phenomenal! I cut the sugar down by about half a cup, but I could done with even less. It's a little too sweet for my taste, but that's my only complaint. On the advice of another reviewer, I used 3/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup cold pressed coconut oil. I also used coconut milk instead of reguar milk to thin the mix, and I toasted the shredded coconut and put it on top rather than in the icing itself. Even without the toasted coconut, you get a wonderful, smooth coconut flavour. I put it on top of French vanilla cupcakes, and even my dad, who isn't a cake person, was raving about them. I will be using this often!

The first time I made this according to instructions. Delish!

The next time I was pantry challenged. 1/2 cup butter, 2 c powdered sugar, 1/2 t vanilla, 1/4 c almond milk, 1/2 c coconut. Very tasty also.

Thanks for an interesting and yummy frosting recipe!

I liked this alot. I halved the recipe and had more than enough to frost my 2 dozen mini cupcakes. The only change I made was to use all butter and no shortening. I think next time I make this I will omit the coconut in the frosting and just sprinkle on top though.

I made a half batch and it turned out very well (I was low on confectioner's sugar). I still managed to spread it over a two layer round cake in a thin but sufficient layer. Frosting intimidates me for some reason, but this recipe was very easy, seemed pretty flexible (aka fool prof) and tasted good. Thank you!

I didn't have any vegetable shortning on hand, so I used 3/4c. of butter and 1/4c. of coconut oil. It have such a small hint of flavor to the frosting. I also did not add coconut to the frostin itself, instead, I toasted it and added it to the top. Perfection.

Took another reviewer's suggestion and used 3/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. coconut oil . It's a little sweeter than I'd like, but the coconut oil made it taste like coconut before the addition of the coconut itself, and I like that. Didn't need any milk to achieve consistency to spread.

This frosting tasted fabulous on my lightly flavored coconut cake.  I used unsweetened coconut milk instead of regular milk in the frosting.  I put this on a Heavenly White Cake recipe from this website, but replaced vanilla with coconut extract and again unsweetened coconut milk instead of regular milk in the cake recipe.

Whoa!! I can see why this got 5 stars! This frosting is FANTASTIC! I made only one change and that was add 1/2 cup of chopped pecans instead of 1/4 cup... but that was only because I love nuts!

That's it. 

YUMMY!!

Frostings and icings can sometimes be too sweet or greasy. This recipe is a winner. I added a teaspoon of coconut extract for even more coconut flavor and used it on a silver white cake with a cranberry filling between the layers for the holidays. The cake got lots of oohs and ahhs and got eaten up in no time flat. Thanks!

I made this exactly as the recipe says and it was perfect! Very sweet and coconut-y, perfect for the less sweet cake I made. Easy to spread too. I will be using this recipe with different flavors as my go-to icing from now on.

Made this recipe this evening, but substituted butter for the shortening.  I think I enjoyed the addition of the nuts ( I substituted walnuts for pecans).  Just seemed a bit greasier than I thought it should have been.  I'm glad I tried it, but prefer another buttercream recipe more.  Thank you for sharing!

I'll be totally upfront and admit that I'm not a big fan of shortening-based frostings, but have been disappointed lately in the pure butter frostings that I've made lately, from the standpoint of consistency, and how hard they get so quickly. So, I doctored this recipe by decreasing the shortening to 1/4 c and increasing the butter to 3/4 c. I also had a few tablespoons (2-3) of cream of coconut left over from the cake recipe I made, so I put that in too. When all was said and done, it was not the right flavor for the coconut cake I made, so I added 4oz (half a block) of cream cheese and a little bit of salt to add more depth to the flavor). I used it to frost the Cream of Coconut Cake Recipe by Corinne on this site, which I baked in two 9-in round cake pans and they work really well together. My husband (who is the coconut cake lover and requested this for his birthday) and our 7 & 4 yr old boys really like it, but I could still tell there was shortening and could taste the difference. So, I'm still searching for the perfect recipe! TIP: With the addition of only 4 oz of cream cheese and 2-3 tbsp of cream of coconut, this recipe made PLENTY of frosting! SO IF YOU ARE FROSTING TWO LAYERS, GO AHEAD AND LOAD UP THE MIDDLE!

This recipe was great, although I did go by one review of doubling the butter (since I had no veg. shortening), and I didn't add any pecans. This recipe will defiantly be used again, and is HIGHLY suggested! It's AWESOME with a g-free coconut cake I've made today, too.

Loved this (and so did everyone else at my son's 1st Communion party). I paired it with a lemon cake and it was delicious!!!! 
I did substitute water for the milk, just because I left the cake out all day and didn't want to take any chances with the milk.

Very good but I deleted the 1/2 cup vegetable shortening for butter makeing the butter 1 cup instead. I also used unsalted butter.
