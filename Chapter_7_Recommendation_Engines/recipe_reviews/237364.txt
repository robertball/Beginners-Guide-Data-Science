this recipe was very good but I made a few changes to it. I added green peas instead of asparagus (because I didn't have any) and for seasoning, I sprinkled some curry powder in. it was very tasty and a huge hit. will definitely make again!

I made this as a side dish to complement a light fish meal.  I used red quinoa because that is what we prefer.  I'm not sure about the asparagus in this.  It just didn't seem to fit.  I will make this again, but without the asparagus but maybe some other green vegetable, maybe flat leaf kale in a small quantity.

I followed the recipe except used peas instead of asparagus because my family doesn’t like asparagus. But the dish was kind of bland. I’m not sure i would make it again.

I followed the recipe with the following changes. I h ad no asparagus so I used green beans, and I had no cashews so I used walnuts. The sweet potatoes took way longer to cook  (maybe I cut them too big but they were bite size pieces). I made this as a main dinner dish, and found it very plain and not satisfying. Perhaps I need to develop my "vegetarian" taste buds. I can't guarantee that I'll make it again.

I loved this dish! Added Rosemary to taste and omitted the garlic and was delicious! Leftovers just as good...will make again!

Yum. Have never ever had quinoa! The dish was very good. I was pleasantly surprised.
