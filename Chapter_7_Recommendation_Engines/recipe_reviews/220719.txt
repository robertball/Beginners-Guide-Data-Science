This recipe came out quite well. I made the following changes. First, I steamed a large head of cabbage for about 20 minutes. I used half of the cabbage leaves for stuffed cabbage. I shredded the remaining half of the cabbage and used it in this recipe. I used margarine rather than vegetable oil to saute the onions and cabbage. Finally, I mixed in 8 ounces of cooked noodles into the cabbage and onions and added a little more margarine. I served this to my mother-in-law, who, due to infirmities, hasn't been able to make this dish in over 12 years. My mother-in-law agreed that it was identical to the classical slovak version of cabbage and noodles. The final test was serving this to my wife (who hates cabbage and noodles) and she devoured it and said I could make it again. This is a great recipes. Thanks for posting it.

I tweaked the recipe by adding finely diced ham and used Sweet Hungarian Paprika instead of caraway seed.  This dish was so savory it could almost stand alone as an entree.

Very good. I also cooked some ground beef and mixed that in as a variation on this dish.

There are many variations to Hungarian Cabbage & Noodles. This one is the closest to the one my Hungarian Grandma & mother used to make. Sweating the cabbage is the key along with real butter. Served it along with smoked Kolbasz (sausage) & Hurka (liver& rice sausage). All gone!!!'

I love this preparation method.  Added shredded carrots to mine and served with Pork Tenderloin Diablo.  Wonderful combo.

Not bad. Nice way to use some cabbage. I added some butter at the end.
