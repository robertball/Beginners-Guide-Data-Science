Oh my, this stuff is sooo good!! I marinated chicken, 3 legs and 3 thighs for about 3 hours, and we grilled the meat...heavenly!! We liked it so much, I marinated a whole chicken in it tonight for about 2 hours, and it's in the vertisserie right now, and it smells heavenly!! I did realize tonight that I forgot the oil last night, and it was still VERY good!! THANK YOU!!!!
Edit: I have started using this marinade without the oil. It seem to stick to the meats better, and gives a stronger flavor. We have tried this on everything...chicken, peef, pork...it's good all the way around!!!

This marinade was awesome! I did tweak it a bit.  I only used half the oil, and added a few of my own spices (roasted garlic and red pepper/pepper medley).  My meat only marinaded for about 8 hrs, I can only imagine the incredable taste after a full 36 hrs!  Will definately use again.

WOW! What a marinade. I went strictly by the recipe except for how long to marinate. I only marinated for 18 hours & it still came out great. I used it on a 4 pound beef roast, baked it at 350 degrees for 2 hours, & then smoked it on the grill for 30 minutes. It came out deeelicious. Thanks for the new marinade. I will be using it from now on.

This is a great marinade. I let my beef roast marinade for 24 hours and then cooked in my slow cooker with about a 1/2 cup of the marinade. It was excellent! Great recipe thanks for sharing.

I can't believe we each of us ate a almost a whole pound of ribeye!  I thought I might be able to eat half...but this marinade is fantastic!  I used only 1/8 of a cup of soy sauce and omitted the salt, both changes because we don't like very salty foods.  I used A1 Steak Sauce and tripled the amount of pepper (freshly ground).  I marinated the steaks 24 hours and will most likely marinate at least 36 next time, and call me crazy, but I might even increase the amount of garlic as we are garlic fanatics.  Thank you for providing me with my new favorite marinade recipe!

I doubled this recipe because I made a double batch so I could have cold chicken to eat the next day (I'm back to eating low carb--so having ready made protein on hand is helpful for me so I don't snack on the wrong things). I let this marinade for almost 24 hours. I liked how basic it was but I think it needs a few seasonings thrown in--maybe some Mrs. Dash or thyme......maybe some lemon slices? Good, but needs a little more. I'll try this again with the spices thrown in and maybe the oil cut in half.

LOVED it! I let my rib eyes marinate for 2 days as suggested and it was full of flavor and very tender. I substituted olive oil for the veg oil but otherwise followed the recipe. I will use this marinade again =)

Mmm mmm good! Definitely a must-have on the list of marinades. I omitted the addt'l salt since the soy sauce is salty enough, but even that, I used low-sodium soy sauce. Very flavorful! I think next I'll use shallots instead of onion just for kicks. Thanks for a great recipe.

Best marinade I ever tasted!  The only things I ommitted were the salt (because of the high sodium content in the sauces included) and the onion.  I've made it twice since I found this recipe last week!

Marinaded my steak for about 34 hours and it was very good - tasted good and the meat was tender (which is very important for a single girl learning how to cook for herself!) I used a cheap barbecue sauce instead of steak sauce, white onion, and garlic powder instead of cloves (all I had in the cupboard). It turned out really well...thank you for a great recipe. I will use this again!

this recipe is amazing!! Its got great flavor, and the longer the steak marinades the better. I usually save a bit of marinade to saute either mushrooms or onions in it and eat them over the steak :)

Garlic lovers everywhere, get ready to be impressed... this is an awesome marinade! I only used 1/2 cup of oil and for the steak sauce, I used A-1 Bold. I marinated a beef roast for 24 hours and it was a flavorful explosion for the taste buds! Can't wait to try this on chicken and pork; I'll bet it's great with any kind of meat!

Excellent!  Our new favorite marinade.  Left out the onions, as they are not a favorite around here.  Marinated overnight, then threw the filets on the grill.  Perfect!

I marinaded my steak & ribs for 24 hours. The marinade was so flavorful that none of my guests needed to use steak sauce. I deviated a little from the recipes by not adding the additional salt because the soy sauce has enough. Also, the scond time I made it, I ran out of soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce in it's place and it came out good. I also decided to add some lemon juice to it. I had many compliments on this steak.

I used this on a London Broil (my husband's least favorite cut of beef) and he said that it was easily "the best London Broil" he'd ever eaten.  Can't wait to use it on other cuts of meat!

I used this with chicken. I used Country Bob's sauce because that is what I had on hand and I love that stuff. It made so much marinade I used 2 packages of chicken. I brought leftovers for lunch today. While I was eating it, a person came over to my desk to see what I was eating. He said everyone was drooling from the smell. I want to try it with steak next time. It was great.

What an amazing marinade! I made it with half the amount of oil and salt. I also omitted the onions. But neither of these adjustments affected the wonderful, rich flavor. We grilled top sirloin steaks that had marinated for about 2-3 hours, and they were tender and juicy and loaded with flavor. Thanks for a quick, easy recipe that's become our new favorite!

I followed the recipe but forgot to put the onions in and it still turned out great!  I marinated ribeyes for an hour and it was incredible. I can only imagine how good it would if I had more time.  This will be a keeper.

This has become my go to marinade.  it is good on pork tenderloin, turkey, chicken, steaks, honestly anything.  I do use reduced sodium worshteshire and soy sauce and leave out the sauce.  The rest I follow exactly.  It;s good when you bake the meat, but if you have the time/weather to GRILL it is AMAZING!!!  It is better when you marinade the full time, but sill awesome if you can only do it for 4-5 hours.  Make this, you won't be sorry

I used half the amount of oil and less onion (since I didn't have any more on hand) and it was delicious. I marinated whole chicken breasts for two days and the taste was incredible, even the smell in the house was heavenly. I think next time I will save the marinade and make it into a thick gravy because I loved it so much. Definitely recommend!

I would use less oil next time. I didn't find it salty, though I left out the teaspoon of salt called for (perhaps the brand of soy I used wasn't overly salty but it wasn't a reduced-sodium kind though). The garlic flavour was very mellow; I must admit I expected a little more 'bite'... I may try out using a whole head of garlic to remedy that. Maybe a little less Worcestershire sauce too. I used this on chicken. I baked these in the oven at 350F for roughly 45 minutes, though these would be awesome on the bbq.

Flavor was good and I lifted the meat to let a little of the marinade seep under to flavor both sides. Unfortunely my meat came out tough,barbequeing a London Boil.  I will try again using a better cut of meat such as a Filet.

Delicious! Though based on the recommendations of others, I did halve the oil. I'm not sure what difference the extra oil would have made, though having some is good in that it greases the grill. I will probably try this again with an even smaller amount of oil.

All I can really say is YUM! The flavor was absolutely fantastic. Although if your not a garlic lover, keep looking for another marinade because this one would be too garlicky for most. Huge hit with the family. Thanks for the recipe

Loved this recipe.  I used chicken and marinated it for 36 hours.  I don't even care for steak sauce, but it was great in this marinade.  It had a rich, slightly smoky flavor that the whole family loved.  A keeper!

It was a pretty good start but as is wouldn't be my favorite... but great as a starting point and then easy to alter if you prefer.

I made this to marinate some sirloins in.  It was just ok.  I marinated it for about 24hrs.  I think I'll go back to my grandpa's way of butter and garlic powder.  Thanks for the allowing me to try something different.

This was maybe some of the best steak I have ever had!! My son who doesn't really care for red meat couldn't get enough of it. We are going to try it on chicken next...I was kind of scared the that garlic would be too much but it wasn't at all. One thing I did differently was added only half the oil and it was more than enough. THANK YOU!!!

Holy cow... this is awesome.  I decided to marinade some bone in pork chops.  They were DEVINE.  They were tender, and had a nice smokey (but not to smokey) flavor.  AND I didn't measure a THING!  I just eyeballed all of the ingredients... delish!  I'm marinading a pork roast with it tongight... can't WAIT to try it on beef!

I used this marinade last night and OMG was it good. I used a canola oil and low sodium soy sauce and that was about all I used that was different and oh and I also marinated my stakes for 24 hrs and it was still good.  I served it with sliced fried potatoes and asparagus and after I finished grilling my steak and served it I found a June bug in my steak and I couldn’t eat it but my girlfriend gave me some of hers and it was so good. Thank you so much and I will use it again for sure and without the June bug.

This was positively AWESOME!  I actually forgot the onions, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We had several people over for dinner, and I marinated 10 pounds of dark chicken quarters in this for about 24 hours (poked the meat with a knife point as suggested), then tossed them in a 350 degree oven (poured remaining marinade over them) for about 1-1/2 hours; the last 15 minutes I brushed them on the skin side with bottled barbeque sauce.  I found out that two of our guests really don't like chicken, and REALLY dislike dark meat chicken ... they made a point of coming and telling me that, and then said that they both had seconds!!  I had lots of food, but everyone raved the most about the chicken!  Talk about easy; the work was done the day before. Had to send the recipe home with several people ... this is truly a winner!  Thanks a bunch!

This is a great marinade! Came close to my favorite restaurants.  I almost followed the directions to the "T", I left out the onion since I ran out, Didn't use quite ten bulbs because I had some rather large garlic bulbs and I used LOW sodium soy.  I marinated a lot of chicken for about 6 hours. My dh (on low carb diet) sliced his for a salad topper, then ate a whole breast.  I wrapped the others and froze them so they could be pulled out at a later time for a quick meal.  I expect those to be even better.

i used the ten clove garlic marinade and marinated a turkey tenderloin.  i then put roasted the turkey in the oven and then cut it up into bite size pieces and sautéed it with some spring onion and cilantro.  then sautéed onion and carrot with some chicken stock. then i used this recipe and fried the garlic and then served it over some brown rice vermicelli noodles......with a sauce that i made from the marinade and thickened with some gluten free all purpose flour.......Thanks for the idea
i had to make it healthy for my dad cause he has a special diet....so i didnt have any cheese and though i used more garlic than the recipes called for it came out great my dad loved and so did everybody who tried it/also didnt use steak sauce put in what i thought by looking up subs for steak sauce that was healthy

I absolutely love this marinade. It's my go-to for beef, especially when I plan on making kabobs later. Mm! Beware, though - it is very salty, so you'll need to have some starch in your meal to balance it out.

Delicious on our steaks! When I was making it I thought that the flavor might be overwhelming (because the smell was a bit) but once everything melded together it helped enhance the natural flavor of the steak and made it so juicy without dominating the flavor. Will definitely make again!

This is one of the best marinades I have ever made.  I marinated chicken (boneless thighs and breasts) for 24 hrs.  The changes I made were to use only 1/3 cup of vegetable oil, a bit more garlic and 1/4 t salt. It came out perfect.

WAY too much oil recommended. I marinated some chicken thighs and followed this recipe to a T. My chicken came out tasting funny like vegetable oil and it doesn't taste like garlic AT ALL. As a garlic lover I thought this would be amazing given the reviews however I'm really really disappointed.

This was really good.  I omitted the soy sauce since I feel it over powers every other taste.  I only marinated the chicken for a few hours and would expect that the flavor would be much better if done for a whole day.

We halved the recipe and used pounded chicken breasts.  Marinated them for half an hour, then broiled them in the oven for 10-15 minutes... delicious! Thank you for this great marinade, I can't wait to try it on steak--yum!  Oh, and I'd like to add that while it may seem that 10 cloves of garlic a bit much, it didn't taste that way! Thanks again!

Very good, took out the onion as I didn't have it in my pantry.  Used three additional garlic cloves (my husband and I are HUGE garlic fans)and added a touch more Worsch sauce.  Great marinade, we'll definitely use it again!

This was wonderfull. I did change it up the second time I made this. I added a splash of Orange juice, a dash of cheyane pepper, a tsp of fresh ground ginger and a teaspoon of brown sugar. I used this with porkloin roast. It was ALL gone. This one is a KEEPER!

Oh my Goodness!  This is absolutely delicious.  I halved the oil, just sliced the onions (instead of chopped/diced), and marinated a bottom round roast for 48 hours.  Then put it in the slow cooker for 8 hours and made BBQ sandwiches with it.  Since the onions were sliced, I pulled them out before shredding the beef and used them as a topping for the sandwiches.

Truly an incredible marinade! I shared with everyone I know. I used "Bold and Spicy" steak sauce since that is what I had on hand and it give it a great kick. This is definitely going to be a staple in our house - makes plain old chicken exciting!!! Thank you :-) (Note: Based on other reviewers I cut the oil in half and did not use the salt and it was perfect! Reducing the fat was a good idea)

I thought this was good.  My husband really loved it.  We've used it on chicken and steak.  I did half the oil as some other reviewers did, and I thnink that it was plenty.

I have used this marinade many times now and it never fails!  Even if I only let it sit for a few hours in the afternoon, by dinner time it's fantastic.  Once I even subbed onion and garlic powder because I was in a hurry.  Not as fantastic, but I still got requests for the recipe.  This marinade is a winner!

This is it!!
If you are looking for a great marinade,look no further!!
I followed recipe as closely as I could  I thought I had worcestershire sauce but didn't, and I used minced garlic in the jar, I skipped the onions, and since I had only 1 1/2 to marinade, I used UNSEASONED meat tenderizer on the chicken,ribs, and T-Bones. I then grilled as usual, Everything turned out GREAT.
Note: Also skip the added salt
This a keeper!

Utterly scrumptious. We marinated boneless chicken breasts and chopped them up to serve as the main topping on assemble-your-own salads.  Our guests agreed that the chicken tasted marvelous.

Ok, definitely check all your ingredients before you start preparing any recipe. While I was mixing the ingredients, I realized that my steak sauce was rancid, so I had to use BBQ sauce in its place.  I broiled the steaks in the oven b/c I didn't want to clean any grills. Surprisingly, the steaks were good. Steak sauce would make it better though. I'll make an update when I try this again w/ steak sauce.

I used 1/4 cup for all liquids, still found too oily, I think next time maybe 1 tbsp of oil and double garlic and steak sauce.
Everyone really enjoyed the taste.
Thought would be really garlicky but wasn't overpowering.

I was really hoping for great things with this marinade, and it didn't wow me.  The marinade smelled wonderful and I marinaded my chicken breasts for 48 hours before grilling them.  The garlic was not very noticeable in the end product.  I'll try this again only on steak and see if I like that result better.

Very Good....  If you cook on the grill, reduce cooking time.  3-4 minutes per side for ribeye on a 550 degree grill is plenty.

I made this for new York strips over the wk end and it was good but maybe I didn't let them marinade long enough because it just didn't have as much flavor as I thought. the only thing I did different was double the amount of garlic ( my husband and I love lots of garlic). I was also only able to marinate for about 12hrs. I will try again and marinate longer next time

This is my go to marinade for all meats. I have been using this for many years. What I changed to this recipe is using a mix Thai golden mountain soy sauce and sweet dark soy sauce to add more of an umami flavor and color. I love a bit of a kick to my meats so I added about 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. I have been using this marinade recipe for all types of meat and for many occasions, from picnics to potlucks, it never fails to please. Great recipe!

Fantasic marinade. I made it with chicken and after marinading for 20 hours I baked all in the oven. The smell alone will drive you crazy! I omitted onion because we didn't have any on hand. The only other adjustments I made were in the marinading time and the amounts of salt and oil. It really doesn't need much salt because the soy sauce contributes plenty, and 2/3 C of oil is WAY too much - I cut the oil down to 1/4 C and it was perfect. I will be making this again and again and again!

I had lots of extra garlic, so I sought out recipes featuring this ingredient when I came across this. I didn't count how many cloves of garlic I threw in, but it was at least 10. My family loved this recipe and invited me to make it again and again. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, which I marinated for about 24 hours, then I baked them in the oven for about 20 min. I added a spoonful of marinade and finished them with a few minutes on broil. Superb!

I made this marinade with chicken breasts,marinading for just 3 hours.  I followed some reviews and did not add the salt or oil.  It turned out amazing.  We are making it again for a pork roast.  I can't wait to taste it!

Used this on beef last night with a couple of modifications and it was really tasty!  Didn't have any steak sauce so used ketchup and I omitted the onion since I usually put an onion in the pan as it roasts.  I also only had a chance to marinate for about 3 hours.  Was still very tasty & made a lovely au juice after cooking to enjoy with the roast  (I did pour the whole marinade into the roasting pan & added water as it cooked).

You can't go wrong with this marinade! I added a touch of sesame oil and left out the soy sauce to keep the sodium low. Very dependable recipe! Good for any kind of meat.

I make this recipe just as listed and it has become my staple marinade.  I have only used it with chicken, but it makes the best tasting, most tender chicken ever.  Thank you for sharing.

This is really good.  I used less oil also, and added some chipotle chili powder it was great... Marinated steaks all day.  My husband did not add BBQ sauce while cooking them and they were still very flavourful.. Will use this often.

I don't buy (or use) steak sauce so I added a splash and a dash of ingredients from some of the steak sauce recipes on AR to sub. I scaled and used this on cheap-o bacon wrapped filets.   I removed the bacon, washed the meat, then cut into pieces before marinating. Cooked on skewers in grill pan.  Served with fruited salad and grilled veggie kabobs.  I don't usually marinate steaks but as a garlic freak I knew this had to be good.

I tried these on some wings I was going to smoke and even though I didn't use the exact same recipe, I used all of the main ingredients.  I used two bottles of Worcestershire, 2 bottles of soy sauce, 2 bottles of steak sauce, 1 small bottle of oil, some apple cider vinegar and a big can of the processed garlic.  It was very delicious and will try it again.

This recipe was just ok for me I think because I just don't care for the taste of soy sauce and thats the flavor I kept picking up. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of I only marinaded for 7 hours.  I was hoping this would be a keeper.

We halved the liquid ingredients, used 1/4 tsp. salt, several tsp. minced garlic from a jar and marinated two ribeye steaks for two days in a plastic bag. My husband put them on the grill and they were absolutely delicious!

This marinade has a really great flavor and I agree with other reviewers that it is not too garlicky.  Even those that don't like a lot of garlic will appreciate it. Next time I think I might try decreasing the soy a bit and increasing the steak sauce.  But not by much.

I marinaded some thick pork chops overnight and grilled them on the BBQ. They were VERY delicious. This is going into my regular rotation, for sure.

I made this marinade on Saturday and vacuum-marinated three top sirloin steaks in it.  The first two steaks were marinated for about an hour and then cooked using Alton Brown's one-minute-per-side-in-a-rocket-hot-cast-iron-skillet method.  The steaks were flavorful but I wasn't blown away.  Today I cooked that third piece that had been vacuum-marinating for two days using AB's method and OMG, the meat was SUPER flavorful and SUPER tender.  This recipe is a DEFINITE keeper.  It is definitely worth the time to plan this meal out and let it marinate at least overnight.  I can't wait to have steak again later in the week!

This marinade has become the only way I make steak in my house.  We eat alot of wild game (deer, elk) and I've had people comment on how much it takes the wild taste out of the meat. Makes the steak so tender and juicy!!!

What a wonderful Marinade this is - my boyfriend said I hit this one out of the park! Although I had to admit to him that it wasnt my marinade. I did not alter this marinade, used it on chicken and we loved it. The chicken was very flavorful and sooo juicy. I tought it might be to strong with so much garlic, but it perfect ! I will keep this one in rotation. Thank you !

AMAZING!!!  This was easy and delicious. I only used 1/3 cup of oil, did not add the salt, and used cracked peppercorn steak sauce.  I let it marinade shoulder steaks for about 8 hours.  My husband is begging me to make it again!  Thanks!

I thought the marinade itself was excellent, but my pork chops were not good...I should have used the marinade of steak or chicken.  I grilled the pork chops and they were tough but flavorful.  Next time I will definitely use thge marinade on steaks.

This was good, but it didn't seem much more garlicky than my usual marinade.  Maybe because I already use a lot of garlic.

Great! My husband was so impressed. I didn't have steak sauce so I used BBQ sauce. I made the marinade 9AM and grilled at 6:30, there was plenty of flavor. I just had some leftover steak tips shredded in a roll with melted swiss, delicious! So much flavor. UPDATE: I buy the family packs of steak tips, divide & marinate them in a freezer ziploc. I pull them out a day before I want to eat them & let them defrost in the fridge. They are perfectly marinated & taste nice & fresh. Super easy for those crazy days.

This was excellent! I marinated a sirloin tip roast in this for two days. Then threw it in a crock pot with some onions, potatos and carrots. I inserted garlic cloves into the roast and slathered it with some spicy mustard as well....this made a tasty pot-roast marinade!

very good marinade.  Definitely worth trying.  I had to used minced garlic in a jar and it worked.  Due to the salt content in the soy sauce I see no need for that extra tsp. salt.

It was Great!! Through the marinade in a freezer bag with the marinade, let sit for 3-5 hours.  Prepared my other dishes, and when my husband got home from work we were read to go.  Rub the marinade into the meat!

I used this with Flank Steak. It was delicious! My husband is a picky eater and rarely gives out a 5. I let mine marinade for 12 hours. I can only imagine how much better this would have tasted if I had more time to marinade it. I omitted the salt since I didn't feel that it was necessary and I only had about a quarter of the amount of worshtishire sauce so I substituted with a little more A-1 steak sauce and soy sauce.

Great marinade!  I used this on a 4 pound sirloin tip roast that I marinated for nearly 24 hours.  I used A1 as the steak sauce since that's the one I typically buy and used closer to 1/2 c veg oil.  Turned out moist and flavourful, thanks for sharing!

Used this on chicken.  It was really good!  I used Heinz57 instead of regular steak sauce just because it says for chicken pork and steak on the bottle.  I'm sure it would be good with A1 too.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful!  I used this marinade on thick boneless pork chops - put in my Foodsaver to marinade for about 30 minutes - cooked on the grill, and the rest is history!  The best marinade for pork that I've used.  This one is definitely a "keeper".  Thank you!

Excellent!!! Used an inexpensive cut of beef, marinated 24 hours, grilled over charcoal and was pleasantly suprised at how tender and flavorful it was. Can't wait to use on a better cut of meat!

Fantastic!!  I marinated porterhouse steaks for a day and a half and then my husband grilled them over hickory charcoal.  They tasted like something you would expect from an upscale steak house.  I wouldn't recommend changing this recipe a bit, it's wonderful exactly as is.  We can't wait to try this on chicken!

Highly recommened marinade.  I made this marinade for Delmonico steaks, which is my favorite cut of ribeye.  The only thing I did different was to add a liquid tenderizer.  I took the steaks on a camping trip and grilled them over the fire.  One of the guys said it was maybe the best steak he ever had!  Will definitly use this as my marinade of choice.

Awesome! The meat was falling off the bone and full of flavor. Perfect for the grill.

All my husband keeps saying right now as he cuts his steak is, "This is the best steak I've EVER had!".  It's definitely a pleasure in our home.  We both love garlic so it's perfect.  I was lazy last night and put all the ingredients in a blender and then poured it out over the steaks to refrigerate overnight.  So good tonight on the grill!

SUPER, GREAT, AWSOME. Really does go with any type od meat. My pork sat in the marinade for two days instead of one by accident, and OMG i still dream about the taste. I use a little less oil and water and add about a tbsp of brown sugar. Can't get much better than this one. I also make a larger amount to store for use when I need a great marinade in a pinch.

I literally whipped this marinade up in less than 10 minutes as I was running out the door this morning.  I used slightly less salt (1/2 tsp.) and becuase I only had two cloves of garlic on hand, I also threw in some garlic powder.  I marinated chicken breasts all day and I broiled them when I got home from work.  This was super easy to prepare and tastes great too!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

SOOO GOOD!!!  I love this marinade.  Great for grilled chicken.  I also tweaked it a tiny bit.  I used half of the oil and added about half of a cup of honey!!  YUM!!!  Also after I took the chicken out I scooped out the garlic and onions, pan fryed them and served them on top.

My family & I really like this recipe.  I omitted the salt all together, since there was probably a good amount in the worcestershire, steak & soy sauces already.  We will be using this often.

I didn't think much of this at all. It tasted much the same as any other soy marinade. Very disappointed.

I Used this Marinade on a pot raost.It was very tasty.Even my very picky 9 year old had seconds.I will make again.I thought it was a bit on the salty side even with reduced salt soy sauce.I will work on how to cut the salt a bit more next time.

WOW! One of the best marinades! Used this on pork tenderloin and the only change I made was to use a whole onion. The flavor was perfect! (It was in the marinade for about 48 hours) We will use this over and over. Put this one in your recipe book!

I marinated beef in this for several days and we made shish kabob with it, basting all of the skewers (onion, green pepper, tomato, pineapple) with the leftover marinade.  As suggested, I went down to 1/3 c. canola oil, used 50% sodium (lite) soy sauce, no salt, 1 t. pepper (we like it peppery).  I was in a hurry so I used 2 T. garlic powder.  WOW!  This stuff rules!
