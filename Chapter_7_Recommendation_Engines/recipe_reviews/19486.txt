This recipe was delicious. And, I don't know what ASIMPSON7 is talking about in their review. Why is it hard to understand where the calories come from? There's oil, there's salad dressing, there's cheese, plus the fish and tortillas. You learn something new every day, I suppose. Yes, that pizza you've been enjoying all of these years, it HAS calories!

Even my wife, who pnly likes reef fish, loved this recipe.  It helps to temper the strong taste if when you cube the fish you cut out the dark meat right around the backbone area

Delicious recipe!  Great change of pace for fish.  And it's easy to cube the fish if you use kitchen shears.

These are very good.  I fed them to a teenager at work
who made faces when I printed out the recipe, and she didn't 
know that they were made with fish.  I didn't have any kingfish
but I did have some marlin in the freezer, I think any
firm fleshed fish would work well....

These are EXCELLENT!! I have never had Kingfish before, but there is a good supply where I live in FL. Although I'm a fish lover, I have to admit, the fillet smelled a bit fishy to me, so I soaked it in lemon juice as Charlie posted in 'Grilled Kingfish.' Please forgive me 1023, I usually don't alter recipes & then rate. Anyway, these enchiladas are fabulous & easy. I absolutely will make them again! Thanks for the tip about removing the dark meat for we Kingfish newbies & thanks for sharing!!

Had always heard that the only thing you could do with Kingfish was smoke it. A friend gave us fresh caught filets, and I had to try this recipe. LOVED it. Very simple and very tasty.

Very good recipe.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour and they were amazing!  Also, don't understand where the 900 calories came from, since everything except the fish and tortillas have none!

We loved this recipe!  I used fresh salsa and marinated the fish in mojo since I didn't have any italian dressing.  Also used corn tortillas since that is all I had.  Baked about 20 minutes and then finished it under the broiler for a few minutes.  Really good!
