Randy knows what he is talking about! Fantastic reduction! One suggestion for a richer sauce, after reducing, melt in 1 pat of butter and stir until creamy smooth. Fantastic with a standing rib roast!  Also try this, my favorite with this reduction! Carmalize fresh sliced mushrooms and thinly sliced red onions in a little butter and olive oil. Spoon over steak or roast slices and pour some reduction over all. Yum!

My husband and I have been searching a long time for the perfect red wine sauce to go on top of any steak and we have found it! I followed the recipe exactly and the result was spectacular. It was the best steak sauce I have ever made or paid for, and it is not that hard. I put the sauce on top of a filet with sautéed onions & cremini mushrooms and as gravy for the mashed potatoes, it was perfect. I would definitely recommend this recipe

I'm a bit surprised by the number of numerous 4-5 star ratings on this sauce. I was not satisfied at all with it. It was way too sweet for me and it lacked the complexity that I was expecting from all of the ingredients that went into it. I have made spur of the moment pan reductions that had more flavor and nuance.

This was the perfect reduction.  I didn't have any shallots or mushrooms (sadly because I love them) but used some celery and it still came out very tasty.

This is a delicious recipe.  I have changed it up a little by using olive oil for the saute, then adding only a TB butter at the end to finish it with a beautiful sheen.

This was AWESOME drizzled over beef wellington.  I've always been told to cook with wine you would also drink, so I used a shiraz/cab blend that I sipped on.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I am making a beef tenderloin and a prime rib on xmas eve and I wanted a sauce that I could make ahead.  I read that you can make a reduction and refrigerate it two days ahead.  I used beef consomme because I had no broth.  I only used one can of consomme, but doubled everything else.   I ended up with about a cup.  I couldn't throw out the veggies, so I threw some pecans, cream cheese, parm and seasoning in them, took out my Cuisinart stick and made two veggie "pates" that my 14 year old and 18 year old approved of.  My son gives this sauce 5 stars.

Great flavor!  A little runny and quite labor and time intensive for the amount you are left with at the end.  But it tastes great with steak!

This is missing a few steps.  To begin take all onions, shallots, and carrots and saute until golden brown in a couple tbs. EVOO.  Next add mushrooms, two ribs celery (diced) and garlic (smashed).  Saute until garlic is perfumed and deglaze pan with one quart beef or veal stock.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a low simmer. To this add two sprigs fresh thyme, two bay leaves and about ten whole peppercorns and reduce this down by atleast half.  Now add one bottle (750ml.) Of a good red wine (i prefer pinot noir) and reduce this down on a low simmer to half or coats the back of a spoon. Strain twice and hold warm for service.

This is so easy and adds such a "fancy" touch to an everyday meal.  I was amazed at how it added a layer of depth to the steak that otherwise would have been missed.  Until tonight, I had only had it in a restaurant.  I didn't really know just how easy it was to make this delicious sauce.
I will be making this again and again...it's perfection!

This reduction was amazing! Took some time, but super easy and well worth the effort. Anyone who gave it less than 4 stars doesn't understand flavor and/or cooking and should stick to a1 sauce

An awful lot of ingredients, expense, and bother for a somewhat ordinary sauce.  Luckily, I could put the ‘dispose of when finished’ ingredients in a soup.

Despite reducing by 3/4, it remained more like an au jus than a sauce. I had made it the day before, so the next day, I decided to add 1/4 cup of flour. It thickened up perfectly and had very nice flavors. I had hoped to keep it gluten-free for my family member who has a serious celiac reaction. I apologized to her, but at that point, it was add the flour or dump it.

This is a great recipe.  And honestly, if you didn't like it you probably did something wrong in the preparations.  We have made this a dozen times now and it's fantastic every time.  Sometimes we sub ghee for butter due to my mother's dairy allergy.  Still wonderful.

Although a bit labor intensive, this sauce is worth the effort. I agree with the reviewer who said it's a bit sweet, but that worked perfectly with my ribeyes. Perhaps the sweetness could be cut by using fewer carrots or a different variety of wine.  Because I had no beef broth, I used chicken and it still did the trick. Rather than cut the vegetables into small dice, I opted for medium and then saved them to serve over the meat. The next day I threw the leftover veggies, sauce, and broth into a pot with some rosemary, bay leaf, salt, pepper, and parmesan.  While it cooked I grilled a couple of sausages and added them (chopped) to the mix; paired with some fresh bread, it made an excellent lunch.   I will definitely use this recipe again.

Perfectly delicious reduction, I did not have any mushrooms or fresh tomatoes so I omitted the mushrooms altogether, and substituted a little tomato paste and everything was still very tasty.  Be sure to keep the strained savories and vegetables to enjoy as a topper for your steak/meat, they are delicious, too!

I used carrots, onions, and minced garlic along with some balsamic vinegarette because that's what I had. Turned out Delicious. Great base recipe.

I used your red wine reduction sauce recipe with beef tenderloin which I served as steak bites paired with halloumi ( barbeque cheese),  the results were incredible!! I would definitely recommend this reduction sauce irregardless of the extra time it may take to make it, the end results and my happy guests were the proof!

My daughter said this sauce is "liquid gold". Can be made up to 2 days ahead. I double recipe as it freezes well & can be a back-up when there's no leftover gravy from meat drippings.
I made the following minor tweaks, based on a single recipe:
FOR THE SAUTE: Use 1.5 tablespoons olive oil & 1.5 tablespoons butter.
WHEN SERVING WITH BEEF TENDERLOIN: Use a large, stainless steel pan & sear roast in oil, then finish in oven, uncovered. Remove roast & cover with foil. Pour sauce into pan, to de-glaze brown bits, for added flavour. 
Add 1 tablespoon butter & stir until creamy smooth, for a richer, shinier sauce. Add a splash of 35% cream at end, to taste. Can thicken by dissolving 1 tablespoon cornstarch into 1 tablespoon cold water, pour into sauce & whisk for 3 minutes on medium/high heat. Strain, if necessary.
I saute onions & mushrooms on medium heat in 1 tablespoon olive oil & 1 tablespoon butter to serve as a side dish. Can reserve veggies for beef based soup.

I like what Terri did with this and took it a step further, as it was reducing i added a bunch of rainbow chard to it and a little salt and braised it for a bit....removed the chard and served it over the filets with the reduction when it was done
