did this a while ago. I do it a little differently. shred the chicken, crush the crutons, mix in a bowl with the shredded parm and a little ceasar dressing to hold it together. cut the center from a romaine leaf and use one of the remaining two sides to roll up a small part of the mixture. pick a few to the back part of a full romaine leaf, serve with a side of ceasar. it's a nice little appetizer for dinner guests. looks great too.
