This recipe was just delightful on pork.  The sugars caramelized to make a fruitful glaze on my pork roast. It freezes well, so it is worth the time it takes to make it. It makes a good  cheesecake topping as well.

I'd probably give my own version of this recipe 4 stars but I changed a lot of the ingredients. I used orange juice instead of pomegranate, added the juice and zest of 1 lime, about a tbs of Grand Marnier, omitted the apple, and didn't use the pecans. I attempted to boil the pomegranate for a while, which did make it a little easier to take out the seeds. I didn't bother straining any of it because I don't mind pomegranate seeds. Either way, it was a nice twist on the classic cranberry sauce and perfect with turkey and potatoes, and could work as a dessert sauce too.

Fantastic!  I cut the sugar to 1 3/4 C and it seemed perfectly sweet.  Thanks for the delicious recipe, it was perfect at our Thanksgiving table!

This sauce was delicious! We added some raspberries and strawberries left over in the fridge. Instead of pomegranate juice we used apple cider and omitted the pecans. After the sauce was cooked and ready we took all the seeds left over and make some yummy tea. Two dishes in one! Great recipe!

Excellent recipe, but directions were terrible, and I could barely tell what you were supposed to do at what time.

I loved this recipe and will never ever eat canned cranberry sauce! I added Blueberries to make it sweeter, it helped to take some of the bitterness away.

i added finely chopped celery, diced apple  and some orange marmalade,  It was better than what i normally buy from the deli and way less expensive.
