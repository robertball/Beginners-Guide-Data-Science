There are problems with this recipe. I had to add at least 3/4 cup more liquid to the corn meal. Calling the shrimp mixture a “sauce” is a stretch. I added a can of diced tomatoes with juice and it helped some (the tomatoes also brightened the flavor up a bit).  I could be five star with some changes...but it’s sitll a lot of work and used a ton of dishes.
