This was tasty! The best part of this dish was the toasted walnut crumble topping! It really added a nice different dimension of flavor and texture to the pasta, not to mention it smelt wonderful! I can definitely see myself making this again in the future, but would probably change the shape of pasta (perhaps spaghetti)..i found that penne pasta taste better with more of a saucier recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't grind the nuts in a processor; I just smashed them with mortar and pestle. Yummy yummy recipe! Note that this does not make 4 servings....it makes at least 6.

I must say, this wasn't one of my favorite dishes.  I'm generally not a fan of nuts in dishes, nor am I really into asparagus, so maybe I should have stayed away from this recipe, but I wasn't really a fan.

Yummy! I'm going to make this again, this time watching the walnuts carefully because I was too distracted and burnt them. Loved all the vegetables, I doubled the leeks and zucchini and added mushrooms too. I would wait to saut√© the vegetables until the pasta is almost done because I prefer crispy veggies. I had some cooking cream to use up so I added that at the end with some grated Parmesan cheese. Will make again.
