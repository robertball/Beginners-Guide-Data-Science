These are THE BEST Russian Tea cookies I have ever tried, baked and eaten!!  For people getting a crumbly dough, just add about 1 tablespoon milk and your problem is solved!  I do this and ALWAYS get a perfectly moist dough to work with.  Just make sure you keep mixing the dough until no trace of white flour is left and dough comes together and is a little tacky.  Using an electric mixer with a dough paddle is ideal.  I do roll the balls in regular sugar before baking and roll it in powdered sugar TWICE for a nice, white, sweet coating. No worries, it will be perfectly sweet.  This cookie can also stay fresh for a very long time in an airtight container.  I made two batches that lasted me well over a week and it tasted as good as the first day.  I've also used almond extract in place of vanilla and it tasted just as wonderful.  Last tip - the finer you chop/grind the walnuts, the less your cookie will crumble when being eaten!  I've used this recipe dozens of times and it's perfect EVERYTIME!  Try this, you WON'T regret it.

I'm a first generation Russian/Ukrainian - American and my husband is a "right off the boat" Russian.  I have used this recipe (slightly modified using pecans instead of almonds, and a little less flour, at 310 degrees) for several years now at our church's annual Old Country Christmas bake sale.  We are a Russian Orthodox, and to us Old Country means THE old country, not country-western, and people visit our sale to find those "real homemade ethnic" baked goods.  This has always sold out on the first day, even when I make 100 dozen.  It doesn't get much better than this!

These are just fantastic. But wow for once I do not agree with the most helpful rated review. I did not care for the cookie rolled in sugar at all.  I used both pecans and walnuts and liked the walnut better - the slight bitter taste of the nut was a perfect complement to the powdered sugar of the cookie. I ground the walnuts in my coffee grinder. I used a bit less flour (3 TBS less) than recommended for my second batch and that turned out better. Note that batter will be crumbly but when you roll it into a ball in your hand it will come together - just squeeze a bit!  Also, when I rolled warm cookies in the powdered sugar they didn't even need a second roll! (warm and being able to hold in your hand without feeling YOW!, not hot or the powdered sugar will melt). Although I prefer walnut the most, this cookie is great with any kind of nut or flavoring - even pistachio. Roll in cinnamon and powdered sugar for something different.

I have the same exact recipe handed down from my grandmother and it is absolutely divine!!!  I made three dozen of these for the office over the holidays and they were gobbled up.  Another person brought the same kind of cookies on the same day I did and unfortunately for the poor dear, her's just set there while mine steadily disappeared.   HINT:  Whatever nut I happen to be using (walnut or pecan), I grind down a little extra until it is essentially dust and add it to the powdered sugar prior to rolling the balls ~ I think it gives the cookie an extra edge...  Thanks so much for the recipe!

The first time I tried this recipe, the dough was too dry and crumbly to roll into balls. The second time it worked much better. The secret is to have the butter very soft and warm, but not melted. Room temperature butter is not soft enough.

To answer a previous reviewer's question, I think you do want to use salted butter because the Betty Crocker recipe for Russian Tea Cakes calls for 1/4 tsp salt.  I made that recipe for the first time a couple of weeks ago and today, wanting more Russian Tea Cakes decided to try the recipe on this site to compare.

Both recipes are excellent.  The Betty Crocker recipe calls 2+1/4 cup sifed flour and 1/2 cup sifted confectioner's sugar in the recipe, slightly less nuts, and rolling around in the sugar two times (once when still warm) but otherwise it's the same.  That recipe results in dough that is slightly stiffer and thus easier to work with in rolling into balls.  The taste is slightly less buttery, melt-in-your mouth and instead is a bit stiffer which is not a bad thing.
(BTW, I did sift the flour and sugar together for this recipe.)

My husband loved both too but said he grew up with the BC recipe so prefers it very slightly over this one. Either one would have been fine with me (I didn't grow up with these) but the BC recipe dough is easier to work with so I was just as glad he chose that one.

My mom made these every year, and I was very happy to find the perfect recipe.  The only thing I would change would be the oven temperature.  I baked mine at 300 for about 15 minutes.  I took them out when the bottoms were light golden brown and let them sit for a few minutes before I rolled them in the powdered sugar.  These are great.  Very delicate and rich.  Thanks for sharing.

Rich, buttery, nutty, melt-in-your-mouth little morsels!These were awesome shortbread type cookies that give a crushing sensation when you bite into them. I used pecans finely ground and shaped them with a melon baller for uniformity. Roll them in the sugar while they are warm, then again when they are cooled. Thanks Odette!

These were great!  I used 1/2 cup powdered sugar in the batter instead of 6 Tbl. (per another recipe I found and had used before).  I found that you need about 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar for rolling, especially if you roll them twice, which I did.  I also prefer to use finely chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  Thanks for the recipe!

My Grandmother used to make these as gifts ... She would NEVER part with the recipe.  Especially to me her oldest grandSON.  Since her death other family members have tried, but they were never quite right.  After finding THIS recipe I have it licked!  This Christmas there will be the Family's MUCH missed Cookies for all ... I have just finished 900 of them and want to thank the poster.  Happy Holiday's and THANK YOU for making ours complete again.

I did not change the recipe at all! Followed it to a Tea! >Pun Intended

These are always a crowd pleaser. They go perfectly well with a nice cup of tea. I had to be careful with the cooking time. Its usually done in ten minutes, otherwise the bottom of the cakes get too brown in comparison to the rest of it. I let it sit for an hour to cool and then roll it in sugar.

These cookies are VERY time consuming!  I made a double batch for a baby shower and found myself wishing I'd made something else.  The taste was just okay.  But - 2 of my friends did say they were great.

These were the first ever Russian Tea Cakes I have ever made, and I picked a great recipe.  These were fabulous!  I made them because I had to have six dozen cookies for a church cookie sale and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I made 12 dozen of these gems and was out the door with them in 2.5 hours.  They were wildly popular.  The only difference (if you could call it that) was that I didn't measure the confectioner's sugar that I was using for rolling them.  I just dumped a bunch of it in a paper bag and tossed them to coat (remember I was on a time limit and the rolling seemed way too fussy).  I tossed them six at a time in the paper bag while they were still warm (I worried that they might fall apart in there, but they held their shape beautifully and I wasn't even being all that gentle).  Then I repeated the coating a second time when the cookies were completely cool (which didn't take long since I was doing it on my unheated back porch).  The second coating is key if you want that wonderful fluffy effect.  Fantastic recipe and one that'll go into the regular repertoire.  Thanks for sharing it!

These are the best Russian Teacakes I have ever made. I have been making this recipe for many years. My secrets for this recipe are as follows: Chop nuts to almost flour consistency, measure after chopping. Roll to 1 or 1.5 inch balls. Bake only until they get small cracks, don't let them turn brown. Let sit on baking sheet 10-15 minutes (if you try to remove them from the baking sheets too soon they will disintegrate), then place 6-8 at a time in a gallon ziplock with a couple cups of powdered sugar while they are still warm, but not hot. Seal and roll gently till cookies are totally covered. Remove with spider and place on cooling racks or tinfoil until totally cool. By rolling them when still warm, they will not need re-sugared later.

DELICIOUS! Just some tips. I would suggest using soft butter and then beat with the sugar, flour, and nuts just until dough is crumbly. Finish by forming a large ball with your hands and then forming the 1" balls. This will help make the cookies extra tender. Also, I used a food grinder to coursely grind the nuts rather then chopping them to better distribute the nuts throughout the dough. Do not overbake, watch closely, bake just until slightly brown on bottom.  Roll in powder sugar while still slightly warm, place in refrigerator for a few minutes and then reroll a second time in sugar. This will help keep the powder sugar from "melting". This would make a wonderful addition to your holiday cookie tray! I make russian tea cakes every Christmas, this recipe is exceptional.

Delicious! But just a few hints: whatever nut you use (I prefer walnuts, just love them in this cookie!) grind as finely as you can. That will help make a nicer, round cookie that is much less likely to crumble a bit on you as you roll it. If you do find that your dough is difficult to roll, just add a bit of milk (up to a tablespoon). That should do the trick for you. Also, I think these scream for almond extract. I always use this flavor and perhaps you would like to give it a try also. And last, I think baking at 350 degrees is a bit hot for this delicate cookie. I bake mine at 325 F. Oh, and one last thing . . . when you roll these in the powdered sugar, make sure the cookie is still warm but not hot. Enjoy!!

My family has been making these cookies for decades.  Never knew the true name as we always refered to them as "butter balls".  Instead of walnuts we use chopped pecans, due to us having a pecan tree in the front yard.  Love these cookies though!  =)

They were easy to make but tasted a little bit dry.  It could have been the way I measured the ingredients.

These were very good and soooooo easy to make!!! For those with crumbly dough, make sure you use softened butter and cream it well with the vanilla before adding the dry ingredients. I stirred in the dry ingredients gradually and blended in the walnuts (chopped finely) using my hands. I then rolled the dough into balls and placed on a large cookie sheet with parchment paper on it and put on a stool in my VERY cold garage for about 15 minutes (to help prevent excess spreading of my dough balls while baking). I then brought them in and put in the fridge while I baked about 8 to 10 balls at a time on a smaller cookie sheet with parchment paper. I baked at the quoted temperature for about 15-16 minutes (until the tops just SLIGHTLY cracked and I could see the edges near the bottom were nicely tanned). I did half the recipe without walnuts and half with walnuts. They were both very good and melted in my mouth. I did not have any problems with the cookie falling apart while rolling in the powdered sugar. I rolled them twice after they cooled and stored them so they were NOT touching each other. I'm going to try another poster's idea and do half a batch with crushed candy cane pieces and sprinkle on red and white sprinkles before baking for a festive Christmas surprise. :)

UPDATE: I tried to do a half a batch using the candy cane idea and it turned out too sweet and my cookies flattened out a lot; even with chilling the dough balls. I'll just stick with the original recipe.

These were some of the most enjoyable cookies I have ever eaten.   I did use finely crushed pecans and about 1/8 cup (or so) less  flour. They were a little hard to work with, but it was well worth it in the end. Double dipping in the confectioner's sugar, first while warm and again after they cool is a MUST! I also baked mine at 325, and they were perfectly done at the 12 minute mark.
Very nice, delicate flavor, and I loved the melt-in-your mouth texture! Will absolutely be making this recipe again, and adding it to the Christmas repertoir! Thanks, Odette.

Great Xmas cookie! Just made them.  Fantastic and easy - Great tasting. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of my oven temp was 335-340 for about 11-12 minutes. i made two batches (one without nuts). I baked them until the tops just barely showed a crack - I didn't wait for the bottoms to get golden brown. I sat them out and let them cool for a few hours before putting the in sugar. They are light and rich at the same time. I don't know how anyone could not love these unless they didn't follow the recipe. Dough was perfect even after refrigerating one batch for a couple days (until I got around to baking it). Cheers to the Author!

I made two batches of Russian tea cakes with this recipe, and they turned out to be great! These cookies are similar to Indian ghee cookies that I had back in Malaysia. Yes, I had a sticky-dough situation. I then added a little extra flour in my first batch, which helped tremendously. And for my next batch, I didn't because I wanted to see if there was any difference between them. The first batch turned out to have a firmer texture whereas the second ones had a more fragile, melt-in-your-mouth texture. So, I'd recommend following the recipe verbatim if possible. I also omitted nuts for one batch as I ran out of them. Next time, I'll experiment it with other flavoring e.g. coconut. This recipe is a keeper!

This is a Christmas cookie staple for our family. I put everything in the food processor and blended everything ONLY until it started to form a ball. I did add 1 Tbsp. of 1/2 and 1/2 and it formed perfect balls. I refrigerated the dough before rolling in small balls. I tossed them in the confectioners' sugar while warm and then one more time after they cooled. I also use pecans instead of walnuts as that is what our family prefers. Merry Christmas.

Absolutely perfect.  I grew up eating these (we called them Russian Tea Cookies) and lost the recipe.  I was very excited to find it here.  Remember to make them small.  You should be able to pop them in your mouth in one bite.

These are very good, I make them for the school bake sale, & they were the first to sell. For those of you having problems with the dryness, humidity in the house could be causing the problem.
Make sure the butter is very soft, if its still dry, add a TBL of water, I learned that in Home Ec, years ago.

I love these cookies! 

I am diabetic though so to make these manageable, I  roll the dough into size of chickpeas and use chopsticks to roll them in the powdered sugar, and decrease the bake time. They look lovely that small too =)

Absolutely gorgeous! MmMm! The only change I made was to use blanched almonds in place of the walnuts. Can't wait to make them again. I blinked, and the family had all but inhaled the cookies! I think they would be absolutely *scrummy* if I made them into "thumbprint cookies" with some jam in the center...Try the original recipe, and you can take it from there. You won't be disappointed. Thanks for sharing this fabulous cookie recipe, Odette! :o)

Very good recipe.  Here are my few comments:
1. MUST use salted butter and it MUST be at room temperature - I always bake with unsalted and the first time I made these they were missing something.
2. Use your hands! the warmth of your hands will help melt the butter. So if they are still crumbly when you try to roll the balls use your hands to mix the dough.
3. Don't over cook these, 11 minutes at exactly 350 worked perfectly for me.
4. Let them cool about 3 minutes and then toss in the powdered sugar.  They still need to be warm for the sugar to stick.
5. Use a brown paper bag to coat the cookies. Put the powdered sugar in the bag and gently toss to coat.  Then you can throw the bag away and its one less thing to clean!

I love these cookies! For a neat twist, I tried replacing 1 cup of the flour with a cup of cocoa and adding an extra tablespoon of the powdered sugar to cover for the bitterness of the cocoa, and instead of walnuts I used peanuts, they're delicious!

The simple things in life are always the best, and that is how these little tea cakes are.  Simple is also great when you are making a varied amount of cookies during the holidays.

A variation on these cookies might be to use almonds instead of walnuts...perhaps adding a teaspoon of almond extract, as well.

As a graduate student on a budget, I am always on the lookout for delicious, simple, inexpensive recipes. These cookies fit the bill! They don't require a lot of fancy ingredients. If you are a regular cook or baker at all, chances are you already have everything you need in your cupboard.  Although the recipe says that these cookies are supposed to be a holiday treat, they are great year round. I made them in the middle of September just for the hec of it. I needed a study break and wanted something sweet to go with a nice cup of tea as I am a big tea lover. I also plan to give a few cookies to a friend who is going through a hard time, so they make excellent gifts as well!  Thank you for this terrific recipe!  NOTE: I made the cookies WITHOUT the walnuts as I don't like nuts in general.

I have a different yet similar recipe that requires the nuts be pulverized rather than just chopped.  I find that when the nuts are ground the true nutty flavor comes out.
My family still enjoyed these...good in a pinch.

The longer you wait for them to cool, the more evenly they are covered when rolled in the confectioner's sugar and the prettier they will look.

I have been making Russian tea cakes since I first had to do a report of Russia in middle school. The recipe I used then was from some big-name chef and didn't turn out well. After much tweaking, this is pretty much the exact recipe I ended up with. Nearly 10 year later and now a culinary student, I have brought this recipe to my school's kitchen with outstanding results! I sometimes will add a pinch of salt if you're not using salted butter to give it just a slight bite before you get to the sweet.

It's wonderful to have a recipe passed down over the years. While this a fine cake/cookie... just not what I was looking for. Not quite sweet enough and a little too soft in texture for what I wanted.  But thanks anyway.

This is an amazing recipe!!!  You have to mix the dough for a few minutes to get a smoother consistency.  Then add the walnuts and mix with a spoon.

I make these but use pecans instead of walnuts.  First toast the nuts; brings out the flavor and then finely chop them.  Delicious, and I love that I can fit the whole batch on one cookie sheet.

This is the ABSOLUTE BEST recipe for Russian Teacakes!  I add two teaspoons of lemon extract to give them a nice tangy flavor, and to make them really stand out from other sugar cookies. Because there are so few ingredients, be sure to use the best you can find (forget the margarine and imitation vanilla).  Even after being kept frozen in a ziplock bag for nearly a month, they still taste wonderful.  I highly reccomend this recipe for small families who want a cookie that doesn't have to be eaten right away, or someone like me who likes to prepare for holidays and special events ahead of time.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.

Amazing recipe, foolproof. I even made a miscalculation and had to add 1/2 cup of flour at the end and they still came out beautiful. The walnuts must be very finely ground. I actually crushed mine in a ziplock back with the bottom of a coffee cup :) Will make again.

I also was looking for the "little white cookies my mom used to make for Christmas" as another reviewer mentioned. These fit the bill perfectly. I like the measurements to powdered sugar and flour. Betty Crocker calls for two cups flour and I think they are not as good as these. Will add to my Christmas cookie list!!

These came out terribly.  They were very dry and crumbly, and after eating one, no one ate any more.  Would not reccommend!

Spectacular - this is the recipe I was desperately looking for. These were my mom's traditional Christmas cookies, and when she passed, I realized with horror that I had never gotten the recipe from her! One bite of these, and I knew I'd found the right cookies. Had no problems making them, they turned out just splendid, and I have to say a big thanks for the recipe!!

These are great at Christmas.  I usually put a little nutmeg into the batter for extra flavor.

Just made these for the first time last night.  I was a little worried at first because the dough was so crumbly and nobody had mentioned that; however, it seemed that once the dough warmed a little everything was fine.  These are sooo good, and I'm usually more of a chocolate person.  I did add a little lemon zest, which I think adds a really nice flavor.  Will make again and again I'm sure.

I thought this cookie was going to be great with all the good reviews.Russian tea cakes are a dry cookie but these were really dry and didn't melt in your mouth like they should.I think the recipe has to much flour and not enough confectioners sugar in the dough.I had two other people taste the cookies and they thought the same thing.Edible yes but not a keeper.

No matter how many times I increase the recipe, it never seems to be enough! These are great! And can also be made with gluten free flour, when I gave that a try I got 2 thumbs up from my brother in law, which NEVER happens with the GF stuff :)

This recipe is just like my Granma Mary used to make.  I made several batches this year and prefer the larger chunks of pecans.  I also made a couple of batches using the toffee dust after my boyfriend chopped up his his homemade toffee.  But the pecans are the best IMHO.

Overall an OK recipe, but mine did not bake in the 12 minutes specified.  They were still raw cookie dough inside after 12 minutes of baking.  Maybe baking them on a dark, non-stick baking pan had something to do with it, I don't know.  It took a total of 17 minutes baking at 350, even though I rolled them approx. 1" diameter as specified.  Fortunately I was able to put them back in (after the powdered sugar!) and bake for another 5 minutes get them to bake fully.  Next time I'll try smaller balls to begin with, as they do expand in size while baking.  I am guessing that  a 3/4" dough ball might give you a completed 1" ball after baking.
One other tip... use your hands to cream the butter and to blend the flour and nuts.  So much easier and faster than a spoon!  
Once I figured out the baking time they they turned out good, but were really no different than any other russian tea cake (or mexican wedding cake, or any of the other names it goes by) that I've had.  Still, simple if often best.

These are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but added about a 1/2 tsp almond extract with the vanilla. I did not have a problem with it being crumbly at all. They molded perfectly into balls, even with my children helping! So I would not add any milk. I've made that mistake with shortbread recipes before, and they turn out tasting like baked milk. eww...I let mine cool only 5 minutes and then rolled in the sugar, and it doesn't need a second roll. The sugar stuck perfectly. I might try this with coconut sometime too! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe!  These cookies reminded me so much of my childhood.  I prefer to roll my cookies in the powdered sugar while they are still warm because the sugar melts on them to make it seem as if they were dipped in icing.  Then I sprinkled powdered sugar on them after they were completely cooled but before serving.  Delicious!

These tea cakes were good, but they didn't have as much nutty flavor as I remember with other recipes that I've used.  It may be because this recipe uses walnuts instead of pecans.  Also, you really need to make sure your butter is softened or the dough will come out crumbly.  It didn't mention that in the recipe, so I had to add a couple of tablespoons of milk to get the dough to stick together.

I thought these turned out really great!  I used 1 1/2 cups ground pecans, because I had already used walnuts in two different cookies.  It was a nice change up, but as a result, I did need to add some cream...about 4 tbsp...to get the right, doughy consistency.  Of course then, the dough was a little too sticky, so I wrapped it in saran wrap and refrigerated it overnight.  Next day, I took out the dough and sliced it like a loaf, then each slice into a 'cube' which really made rolling them into the right sized balls really easy.  Took no time at all, and I was done with the entire batch!  I baked these at 325 for abut 7 minutes.  My oven runs a little hot, so this was perfect.  Really nice, nutty flavor to these and very pretty presentation after shaking in a plastic bag with powder sugar.  FYI - My powdered sugar stuck just fine!  So really, I thought this was a pretty good recipe, even with the little adjustments I had to make due to adding extra nuts.

These taste fantastic! I made them exactly as this recipe says. They were super easy. The only thing was that I added two minutes to the cooking time and a couple of them still could have used a little more time baking. I used a PC cooking stone & parchment paper & my oven is less than 2 years old, so I don't know why. My DH doesnt like almond flavoring of Mexican Wedding cookies, so I found these instead, and boy am I glad I did!

These little cakes were a wonderfully simple and delicious way to spend twenty minutes!    I followed the recipe exactly, but once all the ingredients had been mixed together, I kneaded the dough for about three minutes straight. Since the ingredients are basically a shortbread mix, the longer you knead, the shorter the texture.      The cakes turned out wonderfully and very light. My family can't keep away from them!

All of these snowball cookie recipes ask for TOO MUCH BUTTER.  I cut my butter down to 3/4 cup and it not only tastes better, you don't feel groggy after a couple cookies.  I gave this recipe a high rating because I followed all other measurements to a T.  Love the amount of sugar in this recipe.   Changes I made:  I used UNsalted Plugra butter (European style), 1/4 tsp sea salt, then baked at 300 F for 20 minutes (to adjust to European butter fat content). Texture turned out flaky but not too dry.  Had just the right amount of moisture.  Also...the cookies taste 10 TIMES better if you toast the walnuts for 8-9 minutes at 325 F.  I liked walnuts the best.  Cookies made with pecans tasted like pecan sandies (would have made those instead if I wanted those) Hazelnuts were too hard for this cookie and would taste better with a recipe that has chocolate.  TOASTED walnuts were the most fragrant and flavorful.  If you're going to use raw nuts, pecans are more flavorful than walnuts.  Baked this cookie several times in half batches to get the above conclusions.

This is an awesome recipe, but roll them in the sugar twice, once when they are warm, and then again after they have cooled, the sugar will not fall off, or get sticky, they will be perfect!

Definitly wait until the second day to even try these!  The first day I was horrified and disgusted--tasted nasty!  The second day they had improved tremendously.  Don't know what I did or maybe others just KNOW to wait for the second day.

This is with out a doubt the snack of the Gods! I have loved this style cookie for as long as I can remember, but this is the first time I've ever had them without a bar code on the back. I thought I liked them before... I didn't know jack! These are amazing - Add some crushed peppermint candy cane to part of the batch if you're in to that sort of thing.

This was EXCELLENT! The cookies came out so nice and buttery inside. I changed it up a little though. Instead of using vanilla flavoring and walnuts, I used almond extract with chopped almonds. The almond flavor is AMAZING. I will definitely make these again!!!

My mother and sister used to make these cookies every year at the holidays, and my mom passed away without writing down the recipe, so I was SO GLAD to find this one, it tastes and looks exactly like the ones Mom used to make! Thank you Odette for sharing this recipe.

These were SO good!  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and rolled the cookies in granulated sugar before baking.  I also added a little cinnamon to the dough - about a teaspoon or so.  These were not only delicious, but very pretty.

This recipe was fabulous...I had gotten a recipe for Russian Tea Cakes from a friends a few years ago...then I saw that this one had 5 stars and so I tried it...I ended up making them twice in one week...I took them to two family parties and everyone loved them they were gone in 10 minutes...Oh, and my hunny loves when I make them for him!  But, I recommend this to anyone and I mean anyone!  Sure, they have so fat in them but go work it off!  They are worth it!
I did come to find that if you put them on the bottom rack you should put them in for like, 9-10 minutes instead of 12 due to the fact that they will get burnt on the bottom!
But they are wonderful!

I have used other tea cake recipes which have been very dry.  This recipe is by far the best one I have tried.  I make them every Christmas.  My family and friends love them.  I do substitute the walnuts for pecans just because I love pecans.  DELICIOUS!

I was just looking for a good solid tea cake recipe and this was it.  Half the nuts work just as well, if you don't want to be overwhelmed.  Oh, and wait till they completely cool before you get them into the sugar otherwise they just become sticky.  Very good though! Nummy...  :)

Delicious. My family and friend favorite.
I am from Bulgaria, and we make the same cookies only instead of butter we use LARD and we put pieces TURKISH DELIGHT cut on small cubes ~ 6mmx6mm in the middle of each cookie. On top you may garnish with whole Almond or WALNUT either laying flat or standing upright.
This recipe I followed exact only substituting the same amount of butter for LARD. I had to add 4 tbsp more flour and left it in the fridge for an hour to chill. I also had to bake them 2 more min. After they are baked and cooled for 2 min I arrange them in plate and  I prefer to dust them with confectioners' sugar  and stainer instead of dipping them in confectioners' sugar one by one. They look better this way and get less sugar. 
I used my processor to make the dough. I also have Cuisinart standing mixer that I used in the past, but the processor works better for this type of dough. 
TIPS:If you find the dough is too soft and sticky and difficult to work with : 1.add one by one tbsp Flour(no more than 4-5 for the recipe), 2. Then leave it in the fridge to chill for an hour or two. 3.Wet little bit  your hands when making the balls, it will  help the dough do not stick on your palms.4. If you decide to use Turkish Delight inside first make the ball, make a hole with you thumb and place the Turkish delight piece in the hole, then just roll the ball few time between your palms which will close the hole.

These are very easy and quick to make. Definitely a keeper. After it baked, I rolled them around the sugar place them on the baking sheet, waited about 10-15 minutes and then rolled them in the sugar again.

What a wonderful recipe! Thank you for posting it. I needed a dessert with a Russian theme for an office party. I found this one and gave it a try. My first round produced 20 tea cakes, using a cookie scoop for collecting each piece of dough. The staff loved them! So, today, a snow day off from work, I made another batch - same scoop, but this time the recipe produced 28 balls. I guess I didn't stuff the scoop as much. With both recipes I used King Arthur all-purpose flour. I also added a slight 0.5 tsp of bottled butter flavoring in addition to the 1 tsp. vanilla flavoring. I don't know what the results would be without the butter flavoring, but I was just compelled to add it! The baked cakes were perfectly tender. This recipe is a keeper. Oh, each batch took me less than an hour to make, but I did the cooling outside on the deck in 20 degree temps. Might take longer inside. On a scale of 1 to 10 for ease of preparation, I rate this recipe a 7. :)

Exactly like they are supposed to be.  Made them for husbands customers.  They loved them.  And yes they are difficult to form into balls.  I think this is normal.  Like someone else said press hard!  also not too sweet but I liked them.

Don't overwork your dough or your cookies will be tough.  That goes for most cookie doughs.  Mix to incorporate, don't overmix if you can help it.

These were really good with a nice crumble. I did 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract which created a very good flavor.

These were not sweet enough even after the second coating of powdered sugar. What a waste of my time, oh well live and learn. They are way too bland. I normally like them, but not this recipe.

These were ok, but not as good as others I've had.  Mine seemed extra crumbly and I had a tough time rolling them in the powdered sugar...even after letting them cool a bit.

UPDATE: My German MIL couldn't stop eating these! She loved them. She said that they taste like the German vanillekipferl (vanilla cresents). The flavor improves after a few days and they melt in your mouth much nicer as well. These are so delicious with a cup of freshly brewed coffee. You always want to have another one. :-)  PREVIOUS REVIEW: I made these today and they turned out wonderful! They truely do melt in your mouth and they're not too sweet. The only thing I changed is that I used vanilla sugar instead of the extract and I used unsalted butter instead of regular. To make rolling a bit easier, I filled a plastic sandwich bag with icing sugar and shook the bag till the cookies were fully coated (kind of like the old Shake & Bake). I will be making these often. Thanks for passing your along family's recipe Theaunt708!

These were great - and EASY. This was our first time making these and my husband and I both remarked how EASY it was. We doubled the recipe. We did roll them in powdered sugar twice - once when they first came out of the oven and then again with they were slightly cooled. It made a big difference. Also, we followed the wise advice of some other reviewers - we crushed out walnuts so they were in smaller bits (and powdery in some cases)....also, when the crumbly dough didnt form into balls with ease, give them a little squeeze and they will roll nicely. Easy easy and YUMMY!!!! Enjoy :)

Absolutely delicious. I make these pretty much exactly at wrote except I used half walnuts and half pecans. I creamed my butter first, then added the vanilla and powdered sugar. I made sure these items were creamed well and then added the flour. The nuts were last and everything was mixed well. I had no problems with a crumbly dough. I roll my cookies twice in powdered sugar, once right out of the oven and then the second time right before serving. They are some of our favorite cookies and are always welcomed in cookie tins as gifts. We try to make this recipe every Christmas. I recommend you try this recipe as well- delicious.

These are delicious!  They taste like they came right out of a fancy bakery!  I did the same as another cook did and baked them on 300-325 degrees for 15 min. and they turned out great.

I thought these were good, but frankly tasted like all the other Russian tea cakes I have made. The way the reviews sounded, it was like these were better than every other recipe. My husband loves Russian tea cakes and these were just as good, not better, than other recipes here. I have no problem with crumbling, mixing or anything else.

I agree that a few table spoons less of the flour was a good suggestion. These cookies were delicious! Best russian tea cakes I have had so far..especially when you use really high quality butter mmmmm :)

Delicious.   Also, here's a fast & easy tip:     On a long piece of plastic wrap, form a 1" tall x 1" wide log - it'll be pretty long... Then, just cut 1" sections off and put on baking sheet. The cookies come out a very modern cube, dust with the powdered sugar.

This is a family favorite.  My aunt taught me how to make these when I was a child.  Her secret?  bring the butter to room temperature then cream it before adding the vanilla.  You can also roll the 1 inch ball into a rope and curl it on the cookie sheet into a crescent shape for something different.

This recipe is delicious!! The only thing I changed was adding another tsp of vanilla. This is the first time I've tried making this cookie and I couldn't have asked for a better result. Thanks!!

Perfect texture, Perfect taste...the only thing I might do differently would be to make them a bit smaller, but that's obviously a personal preference issue, and not a recipe issue at all! :)  Aesthetically, I did find that they spread out a bit more than I like, and the bottoms got too brown in relation to the rest, but I think the smaller size would remedy this "problem" easily.  Overall, a GREAT cookie...brings me back to childhood Christmases when Grandma was still around. These will be tradition. :)

My moms favorite cookie! I should have doubled this recipe because this wasn't enough.Everyone took some home and wanted the recipe as well. SUGGESTIONS: Chop the walnuts finer for a less crumbly dough. If the dough is crumbly, add 1T milk. You will have to squeeze the balls together to get them to retain shape.

These are good just not what I was expecting.  They are very dry and I had a hard time getting the powdered sugar on them just right.  I found it easier to put the powdered sugar in a brown paper bag and drop 3-4 of the cookies in at a time and give them a gentle shake.  Hope this helps others!

Just fantastic! These are the best Russian tea cakes I've ever had (sorry, grandma!). I made a few adjustments and I think they turned out perfect! I used pecans instead of walnuts, but any nut will work, really. And I only baked them for 10 minutes, I've found they get just a bit too brown if you bake for 12. Roll them when they are warm, and then roll then again when they are cool to get a perfectly sweet sugary cookie. I was feeling creative on one of the batches and tried adding cinnamon to the sugar when rolling, as one reviewer suggested, and they are simply wonderful! Not as traditional, but it's a nice holiday twist. Edit: I've seen a lot of people complain that the cookies just crumbled. If this happens, the nuts are not chopped fine enough. Make sure to use a food processor or chopper to keep this from happening.

very delicious, they're the crumble & melt in your mouth type of cookie. amazing with hot chocolate. I modified it using 1/2 cup of almonds & 1/2 cup of walnuts. Tastes fabulous. I used one of the reviewers suggestion of baking it at 310 degrees instead for about 14-15 minutes and they turned out perfectly. It's a hit everytime!!

My Mormor made these every year at Christmas and were always a part of her large cookie spread on our Danish Christmas eve celebration. She passed a couple of years ago and I never got the recipe from her so I was overjoyed to find it here! I made these last night and they were the melt-in- your-mouth cookie that I remember. I did not have any problem with the dough being crumbly at all - I mixed the dough in my Kitchenaid after chopping the walnuts in the food processor. I did not roll them in the powdered sugar until the cookies were cooled - if you roll them when they are still warm the sugar melts against the cookie and I like the cookies looking snowy white. I ended up rolling them two to three times in the powdered sugar when they were cooled.  Hint: you know the cookies are done when the tops just barely start to crack. You do not want to over bake.

Very yummy cookie! Made just as the recipe suggests (although I only rolled mine in powdered sugar once). I definitely learned the importance of waiting until the cookies are totally cool before rolling in sugar...otherwise they get gummy/sticky.

My version of this wonderful cookie came from an old Betty Crocker cookbook. The recipe is exactly the same and is by far our family's favorite holiday cookie. I tend to use pecans rather than walnuts; just personal taste.I only make them at Christmas time so they really are a special treat. I've found that like many tender baked goods, the key to success is not to overwork the dough. The mistake I have seen people make is to substitute margarine for the butter. This is a huge mistake. If your budget will allow,use the finest butter you can find.

These were a classic Christmas treat growing up, so I was happy to find the recipe.  I followed this one exactly, and they came out just as I remembered them.  I used salted butter, Mexican vanilla extract, and mixed everything with a fork.  The dough was indeed crumbly, but squishing them thoroughly to form the balls yielded some great cookies.  Thanks for sharing this one!!

The cookie taste great.  I was looking for a cookie to wrap around a candied cherry--this is a little flakey.  But they are a great and easy cookie.  I tried to double the recipe and found it harder to blend the butter.  I would just make two batches in the future.

Very good cookies!  After mixing the butter and vanilla I just mixed the flour, sugar and nuts in with my hands.  Also, I ground the nuts up in my food processor.  Simple, yet delicious.

I just made 9 dozen (3 batches) of these and they are WONDERFUL.. they passed my families taste test too.

I agree with the advice given earlier, if they are crumbling add a tablespoon of milk to the recipe and/or chop walnuts finer.
AMAZING!

Excellent cookie.  My mom and I have made this type of cookie for Christmas since I was a little girl...  and instead of bugging her for the recipe, I searched here.
This recipe turns out to be slightly different from hers, but I like it better.
The key is to make the balls SMALLLLLL.  Very small.  Bite sized.
And not to overbake them.
I think original recipe yields at least 48.  I doubled the recipe, and made 105 (plus all of the dough that we all ate :)

The baking time on this recipe, I found to be just about exact...  (for my oven and for the size I made the cookies)...
Since these barely rise, I was able to fit 48!!!cookies on each tray.  Rolling them into balls takes a while, so I don't pre-heat my oven until I'm about 2/3 of the way done with filling the cookie sheet... (saving energy a little I guess)
I waited to roll in powdered sugar until they were mostly cooled down (10-15 minutes), this works better than rolling them in P.S. immediately.

Alright, I made these cookies twice. And I significantly enjoyed the second batch more. Here's what I modified - I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the butter and vanilla in the beginning. Also, I softened the butter in the microwave until it was almost to the point of melting. This made it much easier to mix, and when I added the flour I added 1/3 cup at a time, so the dough never got so dry it wouldn't even come together (like in the first batch). Also, I made the cookies a bit smaller than the recipe suggested and I keep then in the freezer. They are absolutely delicious.

These are DELICIOUS!!! so easy to make, wonderful butter flavor.  After mixing the butter and vanilla, I mixed the flour and sugar in using my hands which worked really good and insured that I didn't miss any flour. 

I made them a little bit bigger and flattened them out kind of like a thick little cookie.  Baked great!

Also you can re-dip them numerous times later if the powdered sugar doesn't stick the first time.  

And my favorite is to dip in chocolate half way after baked - soooooo yummy!!! enjoy this fabulous recipe - if you like shortbread you will love these! can't go wrong!

I've been making and eating these cookies/cakes every christmas I can remember and there are a few things I've learned along the way: all sugar and flour should be sifted before using, this makes them much lighter.  Good butter and pure vanilla extract are a must, dont skimp on ingredients since there are so few (it does matter).  In a family of people who love nuts they always prefer these without, the cookie can then just kind of melt in your mouth.

A bit of a warning...let cookies cool completely before dipping in sugar, otherwise the sugar melts all over and it is difficult to fix.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies came out perfectly! Make sure when you roll them into balls they don't exeed 1" in size, cause anything bigger and they will crumble when you try to coat them in powdered sugar. Delicious, addicting, melt in your mouth little treats!

Just as I remember. I baked mine a bit longer...18 minutes until slightly brown on the bottom using a baking stone. Also I sift the powdered sugar over the top, less messy.

These cookies went over great with family and friends. It was simple to make and took little time to bake and prepare. I added mint flavoring and green food die to the dough before covering in sugar to make a more festive christmas gift. These fit perfectly in cookie tins and boxes.

These were a huge hit -- disappeared off of the cookie tray. I used salted butter in this, and I eventually used my hands to mix it together -- with no eggs, it's very dry. I had been concerned about the tiny amount of sugar in the batter, but once they were rolled in the powdered sugar, they were plenty sweet.

This is a great recipe, and sooo easy! Making the cookies themselves was so quick. Rolling them in the powdered sugar takes a little longer, but you can't do that until they're cooled, so you can come back to it anytime really. It's a great Holiday cookie - just like little snow balls! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wonderful and festive little cookies! Quick and easy. I substituted the walnuts for hazelnuts. Also, found the mix to be a bit dry and crumbly but zapped it in the microwave for 10 seconds and the butter/dough softened just right.

Sweet & delicious, although quite dry. They are good to be eaten with coffee/tea to add the moistness. They also fall apart in your hands once baked and crumble; eating is also quite messy with the icing sugar getting everywhere. The taste is good, though.

I've been making these for about 20 years now and they are one of my favorites! I use pecans instead of walnuts just to give them a little sweter flavor...they are excellent with coffe and tea! These store well and last long so can be made ahead of time for the holidays.

These are excellent cookies, although I prefer not to roll mine in powdered sugar at the end.  And yes, they are crumbly, but you just have to be gentle when working with the dough.  One fun variation is to use the recipe to make "thumbprint" cookies.  Simply form the cookies into flat, round shapes (like normal cookies), and press your thumb in the middle to make an indentation.  Fill the indentation with a dollop of jam or other filling.  (Depending on what you use, the filling may spread during baking, so don't use too much.)  I also like to add a bit of praline syrup to the dough (I use the flavored syrups that coffeeshops use in their drinks, although praline-flavored syrup is hard to find - others may work as well).

Ohhhhhhhh... these are so good! A Christmas-time "must bake". These gems are more dry than most cookies but that's the way they are supposed to be I think, so maybe it is an acquired taste. Please, please, please be sure to use REAL butter for this recipe, otherwise the flavor is just not going to be good at all! When we were kids we always managed to inhale the powdered sugar and make ourselves choke!I prefer pecans to walnuts though, and they need to be chopped very fine.

I didn't have any trouble making these cookies.  They were very good.  Not too sweet, and the only thing I did differently was to add two more minutes to the baking time at a temp of 325 F.

I just use about 1/4 cup less of flour OR add 1/4 cup more butter.  What a wonderful treat!

I've loved these cookies since I was young and I always wanted to get the recipe. I finally got this one and tried it. My mom seemed sceptical but everyone was so pleased with the way they tasted! It's so simple and yet so delicious! I gave some away to friends with Christmas gifts. I can't say enough about these wonderful cookies! Thanks!

These were really easy to make. They tasted great but are too crumbly. After I baked them when you try and eat them or roll them in the sugar they just fall apart. I did what some reviewers suggested and made sure to crush the nuts very fine. the cookies still did not stay together.

I used skinned chopped raw almonds instead of walnuts (as that is what I had on hand) which was a fine replacement. Very tasty!

I have been making these cookies for Christmas and anytime I wanted a really good cookie for the last 50 years. They have been my favorite since I first made them. I use finely chopped black walnuts and it gives them a really good taste. My family and I are addicted to them.
Everyone that tastes them want the recipe. Best cookie recipe ever.

Very good-followed recipe but used combo of walnuts and pecans chopped very fine. Even though scooped and rolled little balls...they baked and settled into cookie shapes not as pictured. Some of my cookies fell apart as I was dousing them in powdered sugar. Very good. Husband is from Poland and hadn't tasted them in states-loved them!! Recipe makes ALOT but good for sharing with neighbors.

Best ever.  Like this recipe better than the old standard Betty Crocker because it has less flour and more nuts which equals more nut flavor!  My favorite. My mom's favorite.  Can't go wrong with this recipe.

This is my favorite cookie recipe! The cookies always come out perfect! The only change I make is, I use chopped pecans instead of walnuts. The pecans add an extra touch of sweetness.

Made these and brought them to work... They were gone almost instantly! So delicious and sweet, you just have to handle them with care because they're delicate.

I think I did something wrong :/ I made the recipe correctly but maybe I'm baking them wrong? They've been in the ove for around 20 minutes now, and they're still pretty soft and I'm not sure if they're supposed to be like that or not! Did I make them too big? I think it's a good recipe, I guess I just rolled them too big.

melt in your mouth.  The cookies don't golden up like you would expect but they are nicely baked at 12 mins.  I rotate my cookie pans top to bottom, front to back.
Excellent and easy.

Oh my, these are so good! I made one batch to share with those I work with and quickly regretted not doubling it to have more to "sample." : ) I also recommend rolling them in powdered sugar while they are very warm, and again a few minutes later. I received rave reviews at work, perfect recipe, thanks for posting it!

I wasn't a big fan. I did make some changes based on some of the other reviews that spoke of the cakes being crumbly. I added a bit of cream cheese. I had to cook them longer than the the 12 minutes but everyone else loved them. I'm going to make them again minus the cream cheese to see how they will turn out.

Love these cookies!  I've made these for years, but I softened the butter more this year (I was baking bread, so the butter was almost to the point of melting in my very warm kitchen).  Very soft butter is the key--so much better this year!  I've tried them with walnuts and pecans, both work well, but I prefer pecans.  I chop the nuts in my mini-chopper as I prefer them smaller.  If you don't like nuts, mini chocolate chips are great.  Don't over-bake these cookies, they will be slightly brown on the bottom.  Carefully roll them in powdered sugar as soon as you take them out of the oven.  For extra special cookies, roll them a second time once they've cooled.

These are such pretty cookies with a fantastic flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing i'd recommend is making sure to chop/grind the walnuts very fine; i got it to crumb-like consistency and that worked well for me.  I didn't feel that it needed a second coating of the confectioner's sugar but I do recommend coating them while they are still warm (not hot) enough that you can hold them. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I finely grind the walnuts in my food processor until just a few chunks remain.  Very good good recipe. Even my picky 4 year old finished his entire cookie.  These are one of my favorite cookies and so easy to make. Plus I usually have all these ingredients on hand.

Always loved Russian Tea cookies as I call them since I made them back in middle school about 30 years ago.  I only had almonds so I used almond extract instead of the vanilla and it came out great with an almond taste instead.  Made them for a breast cancer bake sale and I'm sure they will all be gone! Thanks for sharing.

Oh my, these are amazing! I tend to roll mine a little small so I came out with some extras. They have a wonderful crumbly texture and were delightfully sweet with two good rolls in the sugar. These deserve 5 stars and go great with any tea party, guests, or just a quiet moment by the television.

I have made these twice now, and they are great.  I have some suggestions for making them easier.  First, do use all the flour; I just press the dough together in my hand before rolling it into a ball.  This will keep the cookies from crumbling.  Second, let them cool completely before rolling in powdered sugar. Third, I put the powdered sugar into a flared bowl for rolling the cookies.  I set the bottom of the cookie into the sugar and then rolled it around the sides of the bowl.  This is a great recipe, and I will keep it in my permanent recipe file.

I made these cookies to bring to a Christmas gathering. Wow, It was such a hit! Everybody loved them. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. The only thing I did that was different was to let the dough chill overnight in the fridge to let the flavors develope. A really great recipe, and a keeper for years to come.

This was a very easy recipe. Basic ingredients that are always on hand, and goes together in a snap. I did not have any problem with crumbly dough like some reviewers. The cookies turned out fine.. A good cookie to have with  coffee or tea. The cookie itself is not overly sweet which works out well with the powered sugar coating. A perfect balance. Looks great on the holiday table too.

First time making these.  They were delicious and easy to make.  Just make sure you let them cool for a few minutes before handling because they can crumble.

Awesome cookie. First time making this type of cookie a friend of mine loves Russian Tea cookies and his ex isn't around to make them for him, his first Christmas after their divorce, she always made them for him so I stepped up to the plate to make them. I had never tasted what he was use to but he says this cookie is much softer yet still a nice firm cookie and has a better taste. I followed the recipe as written. The butter I did set out to room temp which is not mentioned. Was very quick to throw together. I'm not a nut and cookie kind of person this did taste yummy and if he wants them again this is the recipe I will use. Thank you for posting it.

This is a good recipe, but I always put 3 or so chocolate chips in the very center - makes them a bit more tasty. This time of year the stores have other flavors of chips that might be good as well - I'm thinking of mint chips, or maybe the cinnamon flavored ones.

I got many compliments when i made these as gifts last year. However, i kept trying to roll them when they were too warm and the icing sugar kept...melting. Lesson learned.

Love this!! I modified recipe by adding 2 TBSP of milk and added 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar to the flour.  Also, it did help to have butter very soft. Worried at first b/c mine didn't form into a dough, it was all loose in the mixing bowl..but I would gather a small batch in my hand and squeezed into 1 inch balls, which turned out fine. I also baked at 310 degrees for 12-14 minutes.  It baked perfect...not crumbly at all. I dusted sugar when it was still warm but did wait again when cooled to roll into the conf. sugar.  The end product held together, not crumbly or too dry. I will definitely make this again. thanks for sharing this recipe!

I wouldn't change this recipe at all. These are absolutely delicious! I made them last year for Christmas, and everyone gobbled them up. I am getting ready to make them again. Can't wait to eat them!

I loved these cookies.  They turned out just as I remembered.  I did as another review suggested and added 2 TBS of milk, that helped with the crumbly dough. These cookies turned out AMAZING and willbe my go to recipe when I need Russian Tea cakes.  YUM-O

I've made this type of cookie years ago growing up & their one of my favorites, and I tried this recipe today & came out pretti good, but after the 12 minutes i had to leave em' in alittle longer bcause they were still alittle doughy inside, maybe i made em' alittle too thick i'm thinking; but i will try again next time n see how they come out! Hopefully they will come out better; I also used 1/2 cup of powder sugar instead of 6 tbls, it came out a real well consistency overall; My saying goes 'Practice Makes Perfect!'

Delicous! At first I was a little worried about the Russians apparent lack a flavouring when it came down that there was hardly any sugar in the actual cake but the final powdered product is just yummy and maybe too sweet.  I made half the batch with yogurt (so I could eat it) and half the batch regular for my parents, and although I love mine I can see my mom sneaking back every 10 minutes or so to pop another one :)  If you were like me and had problems with the actual powdering you can either let the cake soak in a moist paper towel or dip them in yogurt before dunking them in the sugar.

This is exactly how I remember these cookies. They were delicious! I didn't have any problems with the cookies crumbling while I was rolling them into balls. I used a hand chopper so the walnuts were finely chopped. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems whatsoever. A+

A tea cookie is supposed to be dry and bland as opposed to moist and rich. They are crunchy and should stay together until you bite or break them. At that point they will break off or crumble. They are not a chewy or soft cookie. The flavor is reminiscent of shortbread but it is not as rich. There should also be more air holes than the denser shortbread cookie. These are a perfect compliment to coffee or tea.

Yum, yum, yum!  I've always loved these cookies but have never made them until now.  So good!  I chopped the nuts fine like another reviewer suggested and didn't have any trouble with the dough falling apart.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing!

I substituted almond liqueur for the vanilla, minced the walnuts and added a dash of milk to the dough to make it easier to form into balls. I rolled them slightly larger than 1 inch and double coated them in powdered sugar. They were divine.

This is a 5th generation heirloom cookie recipe that some of us have been eating/making since we were little. Make sure to start with room temp butter, nuts should be cut very small. Once you roll and stick in oven, they will flatten a little. Don't roll them in powdered sugar right out of the oven cause they'll get all sticky. Let them cool for 5-6 minutes, then roll. Big difference. Some people double roll them in sugar but really not necessary and added cost of sugar. Some people make chocolate ones, some people add red or green food coloring. Someone new at baking can easily do these cookies and become a big hit and start a new tradition.

I have been making these for about 40 years. My best friend's mother would make these, and my friend and I would keep sneaking into the kitchen and eating the stash! This was the first recipe I ever saved. They are so much easier to make now that I learned a few tricks.  Use a tiny melon baller and since the cookies don't spread, you can actually put them about an inch apart.  Another suggestion I have is to sift powdered sugar over the top, instead of trying to roll the hot cookies and burn your hands. You have to do this as soon as you take them out of the oven so the sugar will stick. When I go to store them, I sprinkle the extra powdered sugar on top.

I thought these were very easy and so delicious. They didn't stay a perfect ball when baking though, they flattened just a little on the bottom side. I have had some baked by others before that kept a perfect round shape... I would like to know how they did that!

A tad dry, but very good. It helps quite a bit if you soften one stick (Half cup) of butter. Softening both is too much, but one makes it moist and light. This is one of those things you either like or don't. I always called them Mexican Wedding cakes, by the way.

Very good. My husband isn't a nut eater, but he kept going for the cookie jar. The cookie itself is pretty dry (in a good way), just make sure you have a drink handy if you plan to eat more than one.

I doubled the vanilla and used very finely chopped nuts.  These are delicious little cookies.  But, I think this might be a "girls only" cookie.  My husband picked one up with his big 'ol man hand, and it litterally exploded all over the kitchen floor!  It was pretty funny.  I suspect these cookies may be a little too dainty for men (both in taste and texture).

Instead of rolling into balls, I made cocoon shaped bigger cookies and baked them a little longer because 12 minutes made soft cookies. I baked until slightly brown. I used room temperature butter and the batter was not at all crumbly. I also cooled the cookies for about 15 minutes before rolling them in powdered sugar. Since the cookies were still cooling off, it melted the powdered sugar on the cookie and form a sort of sugar butter around it!!! So yummy! I'm not sure if you'd get the same result if you completely cool the cookie first before rolling in sugar. Then when the cookies were completely cooled, I rolled them in powdered sugar again. My fiance said that these were better than his grandma's Russian tea cakes because the texture of the cookie is so light and crumbles/melts in your mouth.

Try using 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  Gives the cookie a more tender crumble. I use pecans. I usually roll in p.sugar as soon as possible out of the oven, then again once I'm done rolling it the 1st time and then letting them cool totally and rolling a 3rd time.   YUM!

Russian, Greek, Mexican, Egyptian... Many countries claim it as their own. =) I've made this several times now and find that the easiest way to get the dough to cooperate is let the butter soften to room temperature before mixing and forming the balls. After forming the balls, refridgerate for 20-30 minutes before baking. That way the dough mixes easily, and there is no need to add extra moisture to hold together. Refrigerating the balls makes them keep their shape in the oven. The Egyptian way to do this cookie is to skip the nuts and stuff a small piece of Turkish Delight in the middle of each ball. I like it best that way and it is not really that hard to do.

I loved these and so did my family and friends. I just moved and couln't find my vanilla, so I substituted Amaretto liqueur and they were fantastic. Not a crumb left over. Oh, and the dough is tasty raw, fyi.

I normally make melt away cookies and thought I'd try this recipe this year. I'm glad I did, they were more buttery tasting and will now be my go to recipe. I also used chopped pecans instead of walnuts, because that is how I like them.

Perfect recipe. I got a little worried while I was adding the flour, but as I kept stirring it came together. Great cookie! Recipe needed no changes.

These are PERFECT!! My family has been making Russian Tea Cakes for Christmas for decades. This year our recipe is hiding in a box because of a recent move. I used this recipe this year and my family and I LOVED it! My mother commented that it maybe the best Russian Tea Cakes ever! 

I disagree with the other reviews about the dough being too dry. I found it to be perfect just as the recipe says! The trick is, first you need to squish the dough together before you roll it into a ball with your palms. Adding milk or other liquid is not necessary.

Another tip: watch out that the powdered sugar becomes sticky on the outside of the cookie till they have cooled. We (like others) also roll the cookies twice in the sugar for extra yumminess.

We've used walnuts and pecans for our tea cakes; both are very tasty.

These were just okay. Just 6 T of powdered sugar makes for only a semi-sweet cookie - I ended up adding a bit more (and I usually cut DOWN on sugar in recipes!).  The powdered sugar on the outside helps a bit with that.

Dough was very crumbly until I followed recommendations to both cut down the flour by 1 T and add about 1 T of milk.

End results was mildly crumbly and very very rich - frankly, too rich for me and not much flavor besides the butter. Might consider doubling the vanilla if I were to make them again, which I doubt I will.

Really yummy!  These are just like I remember from when I was a little girl.  Don't make the cookies too big.  They are yummier when they are the recommended 1 inch.  And I rolled them in powdered sugar twice.

4.5 stars actually - my husband loved these! However, I'm glad I did a test run first before adding these to the Christmas tins. I ground up the walnuts in the mini-food processor and made sure the butter was very soft, per others suggestions. So the dough was no problem and overall this was a very easy recipe. My cookies must've been a little too big though cause I only got 28 cookies out of my batch.  Also, be sure to let them cool well before rolling in sugar - my first dozen I must've rolled too soon and they were quite sticky and I ended up using more than 1/3 C. confectioner's sugar to coat them all. And they taste even better the next day!

I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY AND IT WAS WONDERFUL!! IT WAS SO NICE AND MELTED IN YOUR MOUTH. I MADE THESE TO TAKE TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE FOR TEA TIME AND SHE LOVED THEM!!! HER HUSBAND ASKED ME TO TEACH HER HOW TO MAKE THEM! IT WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED BY MY IN-LAWS ALSO WHO ARE VERY PICKY. WE HAVE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN TURKEY BUT WE MIX IN SOME CORN STARCH IN ADDITION TO THE POWDERED SUGAR...I WOULD SAY 3 TABLESPOONS OF EACH BECAUSE IT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE SUGAR(YOU HAVE TO ROLL THEM IN POWDERED SUGAR ANYWAY SO WHY NOT CUT IT OUT IN THE BAKING PROCESS). ALL IN ALL IT WAS TRULY YUMMY!!! LOTS OF THANKS TO "BUBBA" FOR THE RECIPE!

I made a batch of these for a baby shower tea party. They were a HUGE hit. Followed the recipe exactly. I've made several other recipes of Russian Tea Cakes, but this one was by far the best. Followed the instructions from a previous review about chopping the nuts very fine and had no problems with crumbling dough at all.

Made these for a bridal shower.  They were pretty, easy to make, and *very* tasty!  Everyone loved them.  Note that they do shed loose poweder sugar like crazy (which may not be what you want at a formal occasion) and I found that the recipe doesn't make quite as many as it says (I was only able to get 2.5 dozen out of one recipe rather than the 36 I should have gotten even though I was very careful about the size of the cookies).

I received some of these treats from a friend at Christmas and decided I had to make some of my own. So I looked up the recipe here and decided I would try the recipe which had received five stars from all its reviewers. Seemed like a wise idea, right? I can say, without hesitation, these are DELICIOUS. My only comment to those trying to make "tea cakes", err on the side of smaller rather than larger. Mine were slightly larger than one inch and the result was a slightly less than perfect appearance and 
a slightly undercooked (not grossly just slightly) inside. But this certainly did not effect the taste. And whatever imperfection there may have been was all the fault of the baker not the recipe.

Very delicate cookie.  Used advice of others and added the 1 tbsp of milk to bind the dough.  Used almond extract instead of vanilla...very nice flavor.  Very simple & great tasting cookie.  Would definitely make again using different nuts next time.

I just made this for Christmas and my kids and husband love them.  The dough was really crumbly and refused to come together so I added a tablespoon of milk and a little more flour.  It then turned out really great.

I made this recipe exactly as it is, except I put it in the refrigerator to be baked the next day. The dough remained hard even after 4 hours of sitting out at room temp. The cookies were so dry and crumbly, I couldn't even get them rolled in the powdered sugar without them disentegrating. I may try this one more time to see if it was the refreration that ruined them or just a bad recipe. For me - the jury is out on this one.
***update** I made these again, and while in my taste they are just okay, some friends of mine loved them. So definitely a mixed review here, but 
DO NOT REFRIGERATE THIS DOUGH!!!!

Very good! I've never had these before and they surprised me.  I put the butter in the microwave for about 10 seconds for easier mixing. I also added about a teaspoon of milk towards the end because I was having trouble mixing. The dough was nice to work with when rolling. I cooked them for 12 minutes, but I think they could have used another minute.  Instead of rolling them in the sugar, I put it in a ziploc bag and just shook. I am definately saving this recipe!

Fabulous, melt in your mouth goodness!!!  I defeated crumbly mixture by letting the butter soften for several hours before I began creaming it.  I also stired the misture a little longer with a fork.  At first I was afraid it was going to be a disaster based on others reviews, but have no fear, the dough does materialize and blend beautifully.  Stirring a little longer helps too.  

Excellent choice with the walnuts, and I even left the powdered sugar off half the batch.  STILL YUMMY!!!

So delicious. Rolling these little guys are definitely time consuming, but well worth it. I followed some tips from other reviewers. Add a tablespoon of milk to make the dough moist. Make sure the walnuts are finely chopped to make the dough easier to roll. Before placing in the oven, roll into white sugar. After baking roll in powdered sugar twice.

I made these on Christmas Eve night and they were fantastic! My dad literally ate half the batch while they were on the cooling rack! He preferred them without the confectioners' sugar while I preferred them with it. They were buttery, melt in your mouth and just yummy! The vanilla flavour was a nice touch. I did make a few changes though, I used cake flour in place of all-purpose flour and since I didn't have walnuts on hand I used some roasted ground nuts (grinded them to a powdery consistency as someone suggested). I also followed  MommyFromSeattle's advice and rolled the balls in some white sugar before baking. I added a few chocolate chips to some of the dough as an experiment, it was great! Just don't put in alot of them;). I plan on making some more for New Years to hand out as gifts to the neighbours. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These cookies are wonderful. I went searching this year for the 'snowball' cookies my mom made when I was a child. I made a couple of changes and they were PERFECT. My family members told me they were BETTER than my mom's. I don't have a chopper so I used a bowl and cup to make the walnuts very fine, and added a tablespoon more sugar. (almost 1/2 cup) I also warmed up the butter in the microwave to make sure it was a little warm, and rolled the cookies in sugar twice. I rolled once straight out of the oven and another time well after they were cool. They turned out amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these last night and they are soooo good.  Only thing is, they didn't yield as many cookies as the recipe says.

Since I'm a fan of mint flavor, instead of all vanilla extact, I did 1/2 tsp peppermint extract 1/2 tsp. vanilla , it has a great flavor and friends always try to figure out what i did different...

This is the same recipe my Grandma has been making for years, with one exception - she uses maple extract instead of vanilla. I've had them both ways and like the maple better myself, but others not so keen on maple flavors of course like the vanilla. Almond extract is also pretty good if you only have almonds in your pantry. These are my favorite cookies of the season - addictive and simple.

I made these without nuts, and would recommend including them.  Without, the texture is too soft.  But, the taste is decent.  Everyone agreed on 4 stars- I would have given 3.  make sure to wait until they cool or else the powdered sugar will be sucked into the cookie and create a gooey outer coating.  Thanks for the recipe! Also might try with almonds and almond extract.

These are wonderful when subsituting different kinds of nuts. I used my mother's favorite - pistachios - for Mother's Day. The cookies had a beautiful light green hue. I've also subsituted macadamias with great results.

I used this for a cookie exchange.  It was the favorite.  I did however change a few things.  Before I cooked them I rolled each cookie in regular sugar and then sifted confectioners sugar over them after they cooked.  It add a little more sweet to it.  I've already made them 2 more times.

I remember my mother making these every Christmas - they were my favorite!  I followed this recipe exactly, and was very disappointed with the results.   What did I do wrong?   The "dough" was very crumbly and dry, like it needed more moisture to hold it together, they formed into balls with some effort (but were still crumbly if not careful) and STILL crumbled after baking, definitely did NOT melt in my mouth the way I remember!   Help!

This is by far the best Russian Tea Cake recipe I have ever made. My mom and I made cookies at Christmas time  and sold them and this is one of the recipes I used. I ended up having to make more because this cookie sold so fast!!  This is definitely a keeper.

I made these for a summer baby shower, so maybe the extra humidity helped because they were not dry or crumbly. I scooped them with a small cookie scoop and rolled the bottoms. They were perfect at eight minutes. I made sure to roll them in sugar while they were still warm so the powder stuck. I stored them in the fridge for a couple days in powdered sugar and they were still rich and stayed together nicely. I will definitely make them again. I got forty two cookies using the scoop.

Made these cookies and found the recipe easy to follow and the cookies taste great.  My husband, who doesn't like sweets, liked these because, even though the powered sugar makes them sweet, the inside is not-so-sweet. Try these, you won't be disappointed!

I am 55 but this is my first year of making cookies as I was invited to a cookie exchange.  I am an excellent cook but not a sure baker.  I read all the reviews, added some cream, but they were still so crumbly it was ridiculous.  The only thing I think I could have done to make these better was to roll them in just a mouth size bite.  However they still are dry.

Love Russian Tea Cookies, My cookies came out flat, I followed the instructions. and not a single review of how to prevent flat cookies, ... add more flour? chill batter in fridge. This is OBVIOUSLY the most common issue yet review after review NOTHING mentioned. So i checked other sites only to find a completely different recipe, (same ingredients, different preparation) How have no "kitchen counter experts" not gone out of their way to point proper strategies strategies that should be pointed out in the recipe itself? For that I have to give this recipe an unhelpful 1 star

If you're torn between this and another similar recipe, go with this one. I have a new favorite cookie, and I'm usually a chocolate lover. These are wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly, rolling them in confectioners sugar while still warm, then again once they've cooled. If you haven't tried these, you don't know what you're missing. Thanks for the recipe.

I am sure this has been said before...don't have time to read through the 900 reviews.  I doubled the recipe and got concerned because the mixture was really crumbly.  I thought I ruined it by doubling but I just got rid of the spoon and mixed with my hands. In a minute, it was perfect...didn't add anything.  I used pecans.  I also do the first roll of powdered sugar right out of the oven and a second one after they cool completely.  That's how my mom taught me.  The first roll melts a bit making the second roll stick better...I think.  Happy baking!

Oh my! They were so yummy, heavenly. .. just like they are supposed to taste! They melt in your mouth! I followed the recipe to the T except that I rolled them in the confectioners sugar twice once when they were warm and after they cooled as other reviewers suggested. They are very balanced in sweetness however if you have a very sweet tooth you might want to add a little bit more sugar but I personally liked the recommend sugar amount. Thank you so much for sharing this devine recipe.

These little balls of heaven melt in your mouth like buttah. I, like other reviewers think 350° was too hot and made the cookies too tough. I baked mine for 7 minutes at 325° then turned my cookie sheet around and baked for another 7 minutes. They were perfect. I also tried some of the other reviewers tips... 1. I used 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract along with the teaspoon of vanilla. 2. I used about 1 teaspoon of lemon zest. It was good but I thought it changed the flavor of what a Russian Tea Cake is supposed to taste like
3. I used 1 tablespoon of half & half but I think it made my dough too moist and made my cookies spread a bit. 
Other than the oven temperature, I think if you want to taste a true Russian Tea Cake don't change ANY of the ingredients.

I can easily see these cookies becoming a Christmas tradition in my family. Really excellent.
Like other reviewers have suggested, I added two tablespoons of milk (my dough refused to come together, though I'm sure if my butter were a bit warmer it would have been okay.) Also, I ground the walnuts finely in a food processor, and shook the cookies/powdered sugar in a plastic bag while still warm.

I used pecans for the walnuts as I am not a fan of walnuts, used my #50 scoop which yielded 35 cookies that baked in 12 minutes rotating trays halfway through. I like to toss a few times in the icing sugar and leave a corner of the lid up so they don't get moist. I also chilled my dough for a few hours so it wouldn't spread.

This is the exact recipe I have been making for the last 30 years!! My Grandmother was Hungarian and passed this one to me!  These are by far my favourite cookie to make each Christmas Season.  I usually make a double batch, but somehow, I am always short by Christmas.  This year I am going to make 3 batches!!  And I always double roll them in the powdered sugar!  Thanks for sharing

This recipe was pretty good with a few changes.  First, I added 2/3 cup of butter instead of 1 cup, in order to cut down on the fat content.  I also added about 1/4 tsp salt.  Because the dough was too dry upon mixing, I added about 2 teaspoons of milk.  The cookies maintained their shape while baking.  They were crispy on the outside and slightly tender (but still firm) on the inside.  This recipe only yielded 21 tea cakes, instead of 36.

I just made a batch of these and they turned out great! The consistency was perfect, not crumbly at all. They were a little salty, so next time I think I'll add a couple more tablespoons of sugar, but the finished product was great and I'm sure they'll be gone soon!

Everyone loved these tasty cakes.  I made them quite small, so they could just be popped into the mouth. The second time I made them I put the walnuts into a processor until they were finely chopped up.  It did make a difference, the dough became more moist, everything stuck together and was easier to roll the dough into balls. They make delicious  and attractive gifts too.

Exactly what I was looking for!  I made my dough and then chilled it overnight.  The next day, I let it warm up some, cut it into portioned squares, rolled them into balls, re-chilled them for 15 minutes and then baked them.  I rolled them in sugar when warm.  I carefully used a fork to avoid breaking them.  They took a lot more sugar than stated.  Definitely a keeper!  Oh so good!

Love, love, LOVE this cookie recipe! Took them into work and they were demolished within a hour. Followed other reviewers' suggestions about finely chopping the nuts to avoid a 'too crumbly' texture. Must of worked because the cookies were not too crumbly. Will definitely make again.

I have been making this very same recipe since Home Ec. class in the 60's in Blue River, Ore. (Hi, girls)  We made them into the shape of crescents for Mother's Tea by the ton in our cooking class. At the Tea, we modeled the clothes we had made in our sewing class. I still cook and sew, thanks to that class and the crescents turned into balls long ago. Have made them nearly every year for over 50yrs.
  I found if the butter is too soft, the cookies will flatten out, so after forming them, I put them in the fridge for 20 min. or so while I fill another cookie sheet. I usually make a triple batch a couple of times so there's usually a cookie sheet in the fridge, one in the oven and one being made.  I make these with my grand daughters and have had a lot of fun.  Don't give up if things don't work the first time, read the comments and learn from them.

This recipe was so easy and pretty quick. Because of the simplicity, I was a little worried about how the cookies would taste, but they are wonderful! I used pecans and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the powdered sugar I rolled the baked cookies in, and they remind me of pecan sandies. Absolutely delicious!

To those who said these cookies were crumbly and fell apart.  The nuts were not chopped finely  enough.  The recipe should have said "finely chopped".  These are delicious cookies, and the feature photo is exquisite.

This recipe was very easy and the taste was exceptional. I used pecans because that was all I had on hand.  My mom, friends, and boyfriend flipped over these cookies so I guess it was a good substitution :) Like most of the reviewers, I ground the nuts instead of chopping them and it helped with the texture.  I added a little bit of cinnamon to the powdered sugar on the second coating for just an extra hint of yummy.

Husband and I loved these.  Made them for Christmas.
12/16/16: used pecans. 12/18/17: used 1/2 cup ground pecan nut meal instead of chopping pecans.

The only change I made was to use Pecans instead of Walnuts.

LOVE this recipe! It is so versatile. I did a batch, and put a pecan half, powdered sugar, and a little cinnamon on top of some, dried cherries on top of others, and the last ones, i wrapped the dough around a dark chocolate raspberry chocolate. All of them were perfect! A new holiday favorite, the possibilities are endless!

Just finished making these...they are yummy, melt in your mouth baby tea cakes.  I made the recipe just as it stated...chopped my walnuts up in a food processor to a very fine grade.  Will most definitely make again.

Very nice.  One of the best Russian tea cookies I have eaten. I did take the advice of the reviewer who suggested that the butter be warmer than room temp.  I softened my room temp bars in the microwave for 20 sec at 50%.  Did just fine. I also used disposable food prep gloves to kneed the dough before making the balls.  Worked great.  Next time I might use a pinch less flour to see if it makes a difference, as it was a bit dry in the middle bite. However, overall, I am delighted to have made these myself!

These remind me of nameless Dutch pastires that my aunt used to make for me when I was a kid. They're so delicious! I found that I didn't need to roll them twice in the sugar. (I prefer them without the sugar on the outside, but company prefers otherwise!) I did a half batch with pecans and half batch with walnuts, absilutely amazing!

I made them exactly as directed and they were fantastic! Before making them I read up on the proper way to cream butter as I've found not enough mixing or too much mixing really makes a difference.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely be adding to my Annual Christmas Cookie baking list.

These were one of the best russian tea cake recipes I've tried.  In the past the recipes I've tried have tended to be dry but this recipe was nice and moist...almost melts in your mouth.

So glad I found this recipe! It makes me think of my mom when I make them. :)
I use a mix of English & black walnuts (mom just used black) and roll them in confectioners sugar twice; once while still warm and one more time once they've cooled.
I also chop the nuts very small in my Ninja; almost a meal with just a few larger pieces , so the dough is more crumbly but holds together when you roll into a ball.

I followed this receipe exactly. They didn't stay in balls they flatened out and are so tender you can pick them up without them falling apart. I used real salted butter in mixed everything in a stand up mixer. Then used a scoop to put the dough on the cookie sheets. They Taste good but didn't just hold there shape.

I love these Russian tea cakes. They have always been a favorite in my family, and I had baked them with Grandma for years! I have only one tip - when they are not completely cooled, as in they are still warm, but not so hot that you hurt yourself, I roll my cakes in the confectioner's sugar because it slightly melts and creates this lovely texture and coating for the cookie. Then I re-dust once cooled and it creates the absolute perfect dusting. (:

I have been making this recipe for years now.  I lost my printout of this recipe and glad to see it's still online and as a matter of fact it was the first recipe that came up in allrecipes.com.  Everyone loves these little cakes and I always have requests to make them for the holidays.  Sometime I use pecans or almonds in place of walnuts but everything else I do is the same as your recipe.  I truly cream the butter and vanilla in the proper way (the technical way) and I think that makes the difference.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!

These are so quick and easy. I added a dark chocolate chip morsel in the middle of each one. It was a unique alteration, and I will definitely do it again.

These were awesome! But instead of using the walnuts and pecans like everyone else has suggested, I used almonds. Also just before rolling the dough into a ball I pushed a small hole in the middle and added some chocolate chips. They came out great!!!

These cookies were okay, but I had to really mix the batter to get it to the correct consistency. Also, I added 2 more tablespoons of butter, because the batter looked and felt like flour. But, I am 13 and these were very simple and easy to make! I will make these again!

I love this recipe! My grandma used to make these when I was younger, but she never told me the recipe - thank goodness for Allrecipes! I follow the directions exactly, except at the end I do a double coating of powdered sugar.  While the cookies are still a little bit warm, I roll them in powdered sugar - this coating will melt a little bit, which helps the second rolling stick.  Once the cookies are completely cool, I do the second rolling, and they are fantastic!  These are also great to ship in care packages - mine made it all the way to Italy in one piece!

I really enjoyed these but were surprised at how dry they were.  Be prepared!  Have tea or milk nearby.  I followed the recipe but after trying one I coated the whole batch two or three more times in powdered sugar.  I found a vintage Christmas tin and lined it with tissue paper.  I put the cookies in a single layer and then put parchment paper on top followed by more cookies.  I gave this as a gift with Chai Tea and a cute mug.

I loved these!!  They were melt-in-your-mouth, buttery, perfectly sweetened cookies from heaven lol. I only had pecans on hand, so I threw them in my mini food processor and pulsed them until they were small in size.  They also sell Pecan Bits in most grocery stores, which would work great for this recipe.  I found that I had to add about 2 minutes to my cooking time for them to be completely done.  I am still wiping the confectioners' sugar off of my face as we speak! yummm  :~)

pretty good, I grew up with a "snowball" cookie and this was pretty close.  I used wheat flour and other than being a little darker couldn't tell the difference.

My Grandmother used to make these when I was growing up.  I have her recipe but her's is not nearly as good as these.  This recipe is a lot more moist and I will never go back to the other one.

Absolutly great I come here to use your recipe on holidays, since this was my favorite dessert growing up. I'm glad I can make them by myself and to perfection may I add :-)

The cookies is very crumbly. I'd use less flour next time. They were extremely plain but once I added cinnamon to the sugar when rolling, it came out better.

I made these exactly as per recipe and added extra 2 teaspoons of milk. However, I think I had the oposite problem of most people - my dough was very moist and I had a bit of trouble rolling them into little balls. But then when they cam eout of the oven, they were quite dry. I was able to roll them into ising sugar without them crumbling, but had to be very gentle. When you bite into them, they just disintegrate and leave a slightly too dry feeling in your mouth. But they taste very good.  I tried adding more milk, to my already too soft dough, but that didn't help. I'm thinking about adding more flour, but I really don't see how that's going to help  them stay more moist after baking.  Any suggestions on what I am doing wrong?

I seldom comment (good or bad) on these things, but since I spent $4-$5 on this recipe, I figured that warranted a response. First, it didn't come out right (and yes I followed the simple directions verbatim). They basically crumbled and fell apart in tiny pieces just trying to pick them up, let alone able to roll in confectioners sugar. But, on top of that, they had zero flavor whatsoever.

Excellent cookie!  I ended up baking them for 1 extra minute.  I think I will make them just a little bit smaller next time, since the do enlarge just a bit during the baking. I will continue to use this recipe for years to come!

Made this with my 7-year old daughter. Followed the directions precisely (okay, maybe 1 min, longer cooking time). Turned out beautifully.  Excellent Christmas fare, not that they'll last that long anyway. I feel a second batch is in my near future.

Nice consistency and good ration of walnuts to dough but rather flt tasting.  Perhaps just a bit of salt would help.  I think I will go back to my old standard.

I LOVED these cookies, and I think I ate most of them myself. I'll definitely make them again. One note: make sure they are COMPLETELY cool before you try to roll them in the powdered sugar, because the steam from them (even if they feel reasonably cool) will clump the powdered sugar and they won't look as pretty (they'll still taste great though!)

I would leave the nuts a little more course for added texture. This recipe was 'okay'...a little dry and flavorless compared to other tea cake recipes I've made.

Anytime I find a cookie that my kids or husband love...it gets 5 stars.  I did lower the oven temperature on the 2nd batch because my oven cooks unevenly and I didn't want any to get too brown.  Delicious cookie that my husband said might become his favorite!  The recipe was perfect...I made exactly 36 1-inch balls.  Thanks for a delicious, easy recipe.

Big HIT!  I made this for my girlfriends as xmas cookies.  They all came back and ask for more, and of course the recipe!  I also made this for company potluck, and it was a big hit!  BF's mom loved it as well.  I added in some almond extract and used sliced almonds instead of walnuts instead.  deeeeeelish!

This is the worst thing I have ever tasted.  Not even worthy of one star.  I actually made this twice thinking I did something wrong.  Unfortunately I didn't.  These things crumble and fall apart (like sand) when you try to roll in sugar or eat.  I am so ticked off I used all of that butter for these things.......I could have made a real cookie with it.

Great Tea Cake recipe.  My sisters favorite cookie are Russian tea cakes and when I made these she asked for the recipe telling me that they were the best shes had, better than moms.  :)  I used crushed walnuts in them, but I have added mini chocolate chips to my Russian tea cakes in the past.

I was so disappointed with these....I thought that they tasted like raw cookie dough! This is not a sweet cookie even with the powdered sugar which is probably why they were normally made to be eaten with tea. I will never make these again.

I have to agree with a previous reviewer that these have great consistency, but not much flavor.  Not at all like the recipe I lost.  The search for a replacement continues....

Amazingly good little cookies. I used pecans instead of walnuts and almond extract instead of vanilla. I won't allow myself to make them often, as I would eat them all myself!

I remember these cookies from my childhood, and had no idea they were so easy to bake! I followed one reviewer's suggestion to double the confectioners sugar in the dough itself...but I think that made my dough a bit crumbly and difficult to form into balls. Perhaps adding a bit of milk would help. You also need to really chop the walnuts -- smaller the better. I'm also going to try baking at a lower temp for a bit longer. When they're rolled in the sugar, they really are lovely -- perfect for Christmas or any special occasion.

I liked these, but you MUST eat them with tea or some kind of drink, because they are on the dry side.  I had a little trouble with them being crumbly, but otherwise they were easy to make.  Definitely a very nice addition to a holiday cookie tray!

Not what I was expecting AT ALL!  I was very excited about trying them too!  Did EXACTLY as recipe called for but I was very disappointed.  No flavor .  Powder sugar was the best thing about it.  I was hoping I found the recipe to a cookie my mom would make when we were kids.  I will not be making these ever again.  The hunt continues...

I followed the recipe exactly, and the cookies turned out buttery and melt-in-your-mouth soft.  For the walnuts, I used a food processor to chop them because I wanted my cookies to be velvety smooth with a fine crumb.  Overall, these cookies are very festive and definitely deserve a place on any Christmas cookie platter!

This recipe is so quick and easy. The tea cakes are a little dry for my taste, but I definitely will make these again and maybe next time eat them with hot cocoa or something!   I took the advice of other users and made sure the butter was softer than room temp. That helped with the dough. Thx!

Absolutely delicious!  The dough is very crumbly, but all you have to do is kneed it a couple of times to make it into a smooth dough.  My only complaint is that it only made 22 cookies instead of 36, and I don't think I made the balls too large.  All in all, it's a very tasty treat!  Don't use margarine in place of the butter because they just don't taste as good that way.

Update 8/23/2010: The batter is crumbly because many of us are using too much flour.  If you spoon in the flour into the measuring cup instead of scooping the flour up, your dough will be the correct consistency.  Also, softening the butter before blending is immensely helpful.

Just the recipe I was looking for! When I was younger in girl scouts we would make this cookie during our christmas celebrations and I just loved them. Fast forward ten years and I have tried many recipes searching for the right one and this one is perfection, my search is over! All the ratios were correct in my book, I didn't have issue with the dough being too crumbly, it was by far one of the easiest cookies I've ever formed, and it definitely means Christmas is here, thanks!

I only baked them for 11 min, then let stand on the cookie sheet for 10 min to cool. I also went with some of the other reviews and coated with sugar before baking and I put the walnuts in a blender and they were really really chopped up. I made these lastnight and then took them to a friend that is from Russia. Ask him if they were anything like home. He LOVED them. I did it, I made them and made them right. :)

We are going on the 3rd generation for these cookies.  Be sure not to overbake, not even a second, use the best and freshest ingredients, and they will melt in your mouth!  I do roll them once when they're warm, then once when they are cooled. We have always called them Mexican Wedding Cakes in our family.  I will be shipping them to my son in California, it's never Christmas without these treats.

I have always loved russian tea cakes...my mom has been making them for years!  This Christmas is the first Christmas for my husband and I so I decided to try out these for my husband and while looking for a recipe I found a side note in my cookbook for peppermint tea cakes... they turned out AMAZING... all you do is add 3/4 cup crushed peppermint candies in with nuts and follow the rest of the recipe to a tee!

Definitely a great recipe. However, I substitute pecans for walnuts since they're more flavorful. Also, sifting the flour helps prevent bumps in the mixture.

I had never made anything similar to this before so I didn't particularly know how they were supposed to taste.  All in all, they were very good.  They reminded me of a type of shortbread cookie, and my father loved them.  Will definitely make again!

I used a wheat flour, added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, two extra tablespoons of powdered sugar, and a tablespoon of milk. I made these multiple times over the holidays and they were always a hit. I've had a handful of people who claimed to dislike cookies ask me for the recipe. I LOVE these cookies!

After reading the comments, I expected these cookies to be crumbly, but mine literally fell apart as I was rolling them in the sugar.   I followed the directions exactly, so I'm not sure what happened.

I enjoyed this cookie.  When it came time to coat the cookie I put some powdered sugar in a quart size bag, dropped the cookie in and shook it.  I did the batch and let them sit about 15 minutes than did a second coating.  There was a nice even coating around the cookie.

This is exactly what I was looking for. A friend of ours was in town from Beijing and he mentioned missing my grandmother's Russian Tea Cakes. She baked them every year during the holidays. I found this recipe and not only did he enjoy them, but I did too. It brought back many fond memories of my grandma baking at Christmas time. Thanks so much for the recipe and for sparking some wonderful memories.

We loved this recipe. Exept i really didn't like how the cakes got all crumbly. I did add almond extract instead of the vanilla extract. Found for Christmas it was best to have a different flavor. Will make again!

These are great for those who love russian tea cakes, a great flavor. Make sure to bake them for the whole 12 min to make sure they are hardened, otherwise they crumble slightly.

Love this recipe - I used an elec. mixer, creamed the butter and sugar until light and creamy.  The walnuts were chopped fine and always add extra vanilla. When the cookies are baked the texture is so fine they melt in your mouth.  Sometimes I use toasted pecans or almonds for a different taste.

Does anyone know if I can freeze these?  I've already coated them in confectioners' sugar.  My rental car fell through and it's Christmas!!  Now I can't get the 9 dozen cookies I made to my family.  They came out great, although very time consuming.  I followed the recipe exactly.

These were absolutely perfect!  My husband requested these for Christmas, and he was thrilled with the results.  I used half butter and half Smart Balance Light, and you would never know that they weren't 100% butter!  They made about 26 cookies, though, instead of 36.

This recipe is so simple to make. For all of those with crumbly dough, make sure you follow the instructions precisely. I had no problem maing these as a matter a fact they are TOO easy to make, and the ingredients are basic household ingredients. I love these sooo much. Those who have problems make sure you follow the instructions EXACTLY. Enjoy

Man these are tasty! I chopped the walnuts very fine because I don't like big chunks of nuts, and they are so good. I did make the mistake of stacking one layer on top of another in a cookie tin, bad idea! They squished together and fell apart when I tried to take them back out. Quite crumbly, but delicious. :)

I made these for Christmas last year to go with the assortment of cookies I put in tins for everyone. They tasted very good. I think they were the biggest hit with my husband :) Thank you for a wonderful tea cake recipe. I am making these again, this time for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Stick with the recipe not the reviews for the nuts. I tried both the walnuts (recipe) and the pecans (suggestions) on separate days. The walnuts were far better. I made this simple, I melted the butter, stirred in the vanilla. Then I dumped in the flour and powdered sugar and stirred until it was mixed. Then I dumped in the nuts that I ground in my food processor. They were easy to shape into balls and came out great. Make sure you wait though until they are absolutely cool before rolling them in sugar, at least a few hours or overnight. Otherwise you end up with a sticky, gummy mess.

Delicious and easy.  GREAT for Christmas! I made a few variations; with mini choc chips, with a clove in it, and with almond extract and used green food coloring for Christmas!  All variations were a big hit.

These were great! Some of the best tea cookies ever, and I have made a lot of tea cookies in my day. We did increase the sugar a little (my old recipe had a lot more, so we compromised). It was a few months ago now, but I think we increased it to 1/3 cup. Make these. They are so yummy.

Yummy! I scaled the recipe to make 1/2 batch, since I didn't know how they'd turn out. This cookie is super simple to make! I didn't even start making them until after the kids were eating dinner and they were ready by dessert time. I took a stick of butter out in the morning to soften it. I added the powdered sugar in with the butter and vanilla, then completely stirred in the flour before adding the walnuts. I did chop the walnuts a bit before adding them. Based on some other reviews, I doubled the vanilla and added an extra tablespoon (for 1/2 batch) of powdered sugar to the mix. I used a small cookie scooper so I didn't have to roll them in my hands. If you're not going to eat them right away I wouldn't coat in powdered sugar until completely cool. I coated some warm and the sugar got kind of goopy the next day, but they were still yummy!

I am a fiend for these cookies, hese really are the best I've ever eaten! Even people that said they normally don't like this kind of cookie kept coming back for more. Made the recipe exactly as stated. I used my big stand mixer with the paddle and chopped the walnuts very finely, as suggested by previous reviews.

This is a "must have" at every Christmas.  My mom used to hide chocolate balls in the middle.  But not in every cookie.  That way, you always felt like you got a prize when you got one with a chocolate center!

Absolutely amazing!  The faces people make when they try these are priceless.  I added 1 tbsp of milk as suggested, and it seemed to make all the difference.

Melt in your mouth cookies!!! I love these. This recipe is a little different then the one I usually use and I am really glad that I tried it. I did up the walnuts a bit but that's becuase I love walnuts. Try them you will love them.

I don't see what all the fuss is about.  I used real butter and they still didn't taste right.  Thanks anyway.

I've made this, or variations of this recipe many times, and this is one of the best.  I did halve the vanilla extract, and added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract as well.  Light, flaky - just delicious!

Every now and then you come across a recipe that instantly becomes tradition.  This is one of those recipes.  From now until the next generation, this recipe will be a part of our cookie tray on Christmas day.
Thank you so much.  In my husbands words..."Oh my God, they're flaky, buttery and decadent."

The best recipe for these childhood memories I've found! These have always been a favorite of my moms so I made them last Christmas and again for her after we lost my grandma this year. I'm now taking them again for Christmas! There's no need for change, these are great! Thanks so much for giving these back to us! :)

Excellent!  I used ground almonds in the dough and added a little dribble of half and half to ckeep the dough moist.  I also added around a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the dough when mixing in the nuts.  I baked them at 325 for longer and they are perfect!!

I don't think I've ever followed a recipe exactly, but this one I made absolutely no changes to whatsoever.  Even though it was cold in the house and the butter was straight out of the fridge, my standing KitchenAid mixer with the paddle attachment made short work of creaming the butter and then mixing the very stiff dough.  I didn't need any additional liquid that way and the dough was perfectly workable.  I ran the walnuts through a food processor until almost ground but still with pieces for texture, and that worked well.  I also rolled the dough balls in vanilla sugar before baking for another "layer" of flavor.  Just make sure the cookies are completely totally absolutely cool before rolling, or the confectioner's sugar tends to sort of goo on the surface and looks less than stellar.  Excellent recipe!

I made these for my christmas cookie boxes last year and I didn't think they tasted very good at all.

But I think that just might of been my taste and not the recipe.

These are one of my family's favorite holiday cookies and I have used the Betty Crocker recipe for years. I thought that was good, but this one is even better! I have made several batches and the dough has been beautiful to work with every time. One time I was even halving the recipe, but had a brain block and added flour for the full recipe. So I threw in the rest of the butter, vanilla and powdered sugar and it still turned out as good as ever. What a forgiving recipe! I highly recommend this one.

I've been making this type of cookie since I was a teenager and five years ago I changed the recipe, instead of the nuts I added 6 oz. nestle chocolate chips then rolled them into balls and baked.  The kids really like the chocolate chips better!

I have made these 4 times, everyone loves them.  My Husbands and Father-in-Law’s new favorite cookie.  This is a great cookie.  As per another reviewer, I reduced the flour by ¼ cup, it worked great.  I use a very small melon/ice cream scooper (it saved time), and I cook them a couple minutes longer (they did not crumble).  I did make one batch that did not taste right, because of a generic salted butter (it had too much salt), had to throw them out.   Thank you for sharing Odette!

Easy, fun and delicious!  I warm my butter just a little in the microwave above and beyond room temperature.  It seems to lessen the crumbliness when forming balls.

I tried these for the first time this Christmas and I have to say they were phenomenal. I followed the recipe exactly and the tea cakes were perfect. Even my biggest critic gobbled up 6 in one sitting. I hope to make these a Christmas tradition from now on. Thanks for sharing this family recipe with us!

This is a great recipe, I use almond extract and chopped pecans instead. I also tried this year to dip them in dipping chocolate, and sprinkle it with finely chopped pecans.. Needless to say, the response was overwhelming! Everyone loved the combination and begged me to make more.

WOW...very good recipe. They are just like tea cookies. I too used crushed pecans and 1/2 c. powdered sugar and it was a very crumbley batter. But i popped it in the microwave for 15-20 seconds and it softens up. It will stay very crumby untill you get it in your hands, you got to apply pressure to it and work with it just a little befor you can roll it into a ball. Roll it in sugar twice. They melt in your mouth and are great with coffee. Everyone loved them. By far the best cookie i have ever tasted.

These were great. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I rolled them when they were warm, then again after they cooled. They froze very well.

My daughter and I had a blast putting these together and rolling them in the sugar! They taste very light and sweet. Reminds me of a wonderful flaky sweetened pie crust dusted in sugar.

These cookies are amazing.  This is the second year I have been making them.  The trick with the  dough, is to make sure the butter is really soft.  It will make a better cookie.  Its not crumbly it melts in your mouth.  I think everyone should give it a try.

These cookies needed to be a bit sweeter, so I used about 1/2 a cup of powdered sugar. The second time I made these cookies, I also tried using chocolate chips instead of the pecans/walnuts (I used pecan dust the first time and they tasted almost bitter) and they were really tasty. I also find it helpful to add some milk just so the dough is pliable and not crumbly. Overall, quite good with some adjustments!

The cookies came out great.  Everybody loved them and some people said it was the best cookie they've had.  Instead of chopping the walnuts, I put them in the grinder and they came out like a powder -- I don't know if that added to the richness of the cookie.

I pressed them into small muffin tin cups & got a cute little cup perfect for packing into boxes. I dusted them with powdered sugar and got a pretty result.

Loved these! My mom made these when I was a kid, but I never knew the name of them. We made the recipe as is and wouldn't change a thing - dough was very moist and held together easily. I tried to roll them in the sugar while they were still warm, and it got a little messy. Much easier to roll when they are cool. I'm going to try making them again and add almond extract next time. We will definitely make these again.

I have made this cookie for years at Christmas time, it is my sons fave cookie. The only thing I change is I add mini chocolate chips to dough making them "dirty snowballs". You may have to use your hands to mix the chips in.

I just got done with these. Use real butter and you have a winner. Crumbly, buttery, melt in your mouth. Fabulous. I used a small scoop to dole them out and it was the right thing to do. Watch them like a hawk, in case they burn. 

My kids ate the whole first batch!

I was a little worried about how these were going to turn out, I thought they might be too dry.  But, I followed the recipe exactly and I was thrilled with the results.  The cookies actually tasted better the next day.  My 80 year old aunt said they tasted just like the Italian Wedding Cookies she used to eat.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the closest I could find to a recipe my mom used to make, and they are fantastic.  The dough seemed like it wasn't right, but when you rolled the balls it stayed together.  They absolutely melt in your mouth.  I dipped mine in the powedered sugar TWICE, and also made them smaller.  Wonderful!

A wonderful recipe, full of Christmas memories--tea and cookies with Mom and Grandma.  It wouldn't be Christmas without these little cakes.    After they cool, I keep mine in a zip lock with some extra powdered sugar, they're always fresh with a new coat of sugar this way.

Dough will be crumbly at first but will warm in your hands as you form the cookie into a ball.  I used 1/2 cup finely diced walnuts, 1/2 cup pecan chips.  Rolled in 10X sugar immed. after they came out of the oven to form a sugar glaze.  Let cool.  Rolled again in 10X.  Let sit for an hour or two, then stored in tin.  Buttery, nutty delicious cookie that looks good on a tray.  Always a favorite.

These melt in your mouth. I've made them in the past and I chilled the dough, which dried it out and caused it to not stick together. If you chill it, let it come to room temperature again before trying to form it into a ball. :) 
 
These melt in your mouth! mmmmm.

Delicious!  I added a little lemon zest and it gave them just a hint of lemon.  Plus these are great to bake with kids.  Thanks!

At holiday times I have to use this recipe.  It's been in my recipe box for approximately 4 years now, and I've made it every year since finding it. It reminds me of the ones my grandma used to make for us.  All I can say is now that I have my own family, WE LOVE IT.

Very good and easy to make.  I used Pecans instead of walnuts.  Next time I may toast them a few mminutes to add flavor.

I think the last couple of people who rated this recipe poorly didn't make it correctly -- it is FABULOUS.  This is exactly what a Russian Tea Cake should be. Thank you for sharing!

I tried this recipe this afternoon and it turned out wonderful!!  Better than the recipe I have used for years!!  It really does just melt in your mouth!!  I made no changes and was completely satisfied with the outcome!  Even my husband commented on how they taste better than my old recipe!!  We have always called them Snowball Cookies, so we'll keep our traditional name, but give credit to Odette!

I had intended to make this along with my daughter for her 8th grade project on Russia. She didn't want to wait until I got home so she went ahead (against my better judgment) on her own.

The only change she made was to use half the nuts.She said kids are not big fans of nuts. We also tried, for the first time, the relatively new Land of Lakes baking butter. This has a small amount of oil in it so that you don't have to presoften the butter. It feels hard in the refrigerator but it softens right away when you take it out. My daughter thought it was a bit odd in color.

I thought these were good, but just a tad dry. I'm going to dry making them myself at another time. They are very easy to do. We also recommend rolling them twice in the confectioners sugar and be very generous with it.

Delicious. Simple and satisfying. Easy enough that my kids made it by themselves - almost! We used pecans instead of walnuts and used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond to give it a nice hint of something else. And a second rolling in powdered sugar was necessary as the first didn't stick too well. Thanks Bubba for the perfect tea cake!

I know this recipe has received rave reviews but I just didn't love it.  The cookies are very buttery, just not sweet enough.  I think they'd be good as thumbprint cookies and that the jam would add the sweetness I was missing.

Just finished my first batch. Pleasant surprise. Not too sweet so the final touch of confectioner's sugar works well. Quick to prepare.

Lined a tin w/red tissue paper, filled with a dozen cookies to make a finely presented gift.

Thank you for sharing.

Excellent!  My whole family loved these cookies and I made them in one morning when everyone was eating breakfast.  Instead of using walnuts, I used macadamia nuts - really good!  Next time I plan on trying pecans!

Came out perfect the first time. Just a tip: as with most Russian Tea Cake recipes, sifting the powdered sugar and flour will really improve the texture.

These are my husband's favorite cookie. For the walnuts, I grind finely in a food processor so that you still get the walnut flavor but the cookie stays together better. I also find it easier to roll in powdered sugar once they're completely cool. They fall apart less that way.

WOW! I’ve never made these before, I guess because no one in my family ever did. But they’re one of my favorite cookies whenever I can get them. So I tried my hand at them, and this is possibly the easiest cookie recipe I’ve ever made. They were done, totally done, in 40 minutes! I used a 1 Tbsp. pastey scooper. The scooper made them perfectly uniform and lovely!  Also, they are melt-in-your-mouth delicious! One change - I already had a cup of chopped pecans so I used them instead of walnuts. They were wonderful! This is my new favorite cookie recipe!

I made these as a wedding gift for a friend, and my whole family is blown away at how good these cookies are. I'm an ultra-novice baker and these were super easy and delicious!

Made them for Christmas (adding the 2 Tbs of water as suggested in other comments) and they were delicious and wonderful. Lots of compliments. I used walnuts and ground them up in my magic bullet.

I was on the hunt to duplicate a family recipe and I found it! These cookies are just perfect as written. My personal preference is to replace the nuts with mini-chocolate chips (this also works well if you’re dealing with any nut allergies). I resisted the “double roll” for years until now and...let’s just say that it’s totally worth the time. The second powdered sugar coating gives that snow white look that we all love! We like call these cookies snowballs. So good!

I lost all my cookbooks & recipes in a fire, but this one is what I remembered making before. One of the most important things to do is make sure the butter is softened.  I doubled the recipe to make more, & the worst part about that is the time to shape, bake, cool & roll the cookies to the finish. I had planned to make them with a friend,  but when plans fell through I did them myself. Next time I plan on having teenage volunteers! The end result was excellent & they are an absolute favorite with everyone.  I think they are a great cookie to make with your kids or grandkids.  This recipe will remain on my list.

Subbed gluten-free flour, increased vanilla to 1.5 tsp, was a bit more generous with the powdered sugar in the dough,added a dash of salt and they came out great. They didn't hold the round shape, but that isn't very important to me. The taste and texture are lovely.
*after reading the negative reviews that center on the texture, I'd like to add that while making these, it became apparent to me that I needed to just get my hands in there and mix the ingredients. The warmth from my hands helped slightly melt that creamed butter so that it could accept the dry ingredients.

These were super easy to make and tasted really good with even just the one layer of confectioner sugar I rolled them in after baking them. I ended up with 42 of them but I guess I rolled mine a bit smaller. Will definitely whip these up again some time!

This recipe was a huge win at the fancy Christmas party I went to; I made three batches, each one with a different nut, and they were all eaten!
I received lots of compliments, and my mom asked me for the recipe!  Merry Christmas everyone, this is a great yuletide cookie, I recommend it to everyone!

Just made a second batch, with pecans.  I'll be trying hazelnuts next.

I usually take the time to read the reviews before I make something for the first time. But I said hey - 1100 reviewers gave this 4.5 stars - so I just dove in.

The critical missing piece of this recipe is that the butter should be VERY soft. Quickly chilling the dough would also have made a difference.

I ended up with cakes that were dry and crumbly. Yuck. It's the weekend before Christmas. .no time to make more.

I have never had these cookies before, but they were super easy to make and really do taste great with tea. A friend who grew up with them says I should replace the vanilla with black walnut extract for more intense flavor, but I could not find any

These are so good and taste exactly like the cookies my mom used to make for Christmas. I followed the advise of a reviewer and chopped my nuts as small as I could (I used pecans) and added a little less than a tablespoon of milk and did a double roll of powdered sugar. They are a little time consuming to make, but worth it. I'll be making these again.

I remember my mom making these every year for Christmas when I was a kid.  Ever made them myself.  So when my husband said let’s make gingerbread cookies for the holidays.  I said yes and I’d like to make some Russian Tea Cakes.  I always read the reviews from others to see suggestions.  Thanks for the mentioning the added milk.  These turned out great and I will be keeping this recipe and making this another one of our traditions.

I make Russian tea cakes every year as an easy go to cookie. I found this recipe lacking compared to others I have used. The reduced flour content, lower cooking temp, and lack of salt result in a flatter cookie vs retaining its traditional ball shape.

This is a true favorite in my house.  It just isn't Christmas without them.  My family is Lithuanian and my Great Grandmother brought this recipe with her when she immigrated to America.  She baked them in her original coal-burning stove in her home in Pennsylvania.  We call these "Snowball Cookies", but it is the same exact recipe.  If you haven't tried them, it is definitely worth baking them.

My Lithuanian grandmother, and then my mother, made these cookies every Christmas.  After mom passed, I thought I'd never get to taste them again. But, wow, this are EXACTLY as I remember them.  I plan to make a ton of them for the holidays and will pass the recipe along to my daughter so that she can carry on the tradition.

Great recipe. Make sure to chop the walnuts super small. I used my food processor and that made it easier. 

I also used unsalted butter because that's what I use for baking when the recipe doesn't specify. The dough didn't have much depth to it and definitely needed the 1/4-1/2 tsp of salt I added. 

I also tried baking at a lower temp (325) for longer (13-14 mins) and I don't know that it made a difference.

This is the recipe I follow, very similar to my grandmother's handwritten version from the 1960s. It's easily made vegan by substituting Earth Balance spread for the butter; I do a vegan batch at Christmas for my coworkers.

My grandmother used to make these when I was small, and every time I bite into one of these cookies, I think of her.  I make these every Christmas, and tell my kids how Granny used to measure the ingredients and check the dough by feel, since she was blind.

Fantastic and perfect recipe. I have made this recipe for years, not only have I made the delicious tea cakes but I also press the dough into a pan (even when its dry and not sticky) if it won't stick I just pat an even amount on the bottom of the pan and then warm the dough in my hands so the butter becomes softer and i gently press the dough onto the sides and corners. I bake it at 350 for around 8 minutes or until lightly golden then I place my apples or pecan pie filling add streusel on top and cook for alloted time. The crust is delicious shortbread and it never gets soggy not even several days after its baked. I use it for pumpkin pie and pecan pie and I just made an apple cobbler with it and it was superb. Happy baking!

Used up a powdered sugar/ walnut mix. Cookies are dry kind of crumbly. Hence the need for tea.

Love this recipe, I have made it as is, but over 10 years of learning to cook on my own, experimentation has taught me a few things.  My grandma's recipe seemed a bit floury and almost too nutty after I made these-   I grew up with her Russian Tea Cakes as a yearly holiday cookie, usually with walnuts as above, and I think the ratio of flour/butter/sugar was different as well.    I found this recipe early on, and it's become my go-to. 
 

MY CHANGES:  I have realized I prefer pecans to walnuts, and I started adding some cinnamon.  I love cinnamon, and I simply eyeball it so I can just BARELY see the cinnamon specks in the dough.  Then for the first powdered sugar roll I have slightly more cinnamon.  In the second roll I use pretty much straight powdered sugar, so it hides the "secret" ingredient.  My mother-in-law told me she likes my Russian Tea Cakes better than her sister's, who was her family's cookie queen every year until I came along.  Now that Aunt S. is gluten free, I happily took on the role of family cookie maker.  MIL requests these every year.  

This year, I made one more change... I pulsed the pecans in my processor/chopper to make them quite fine, and that ends up measuring about 3/4 c. after being ground up.  It makes for a finer textured cookie, which, for me, has made it absolutely perfect. 
 Thank you, Bubba, for an excellent cookie!

I had to cut the recipe in half because I only had one stick of butter. I've never had them before so I don't have anything to compare them to, but the kids and hubby thought they were good. I''ll  make them again.

This is a very easy recipe, and the cookie always turns out perfect. I've found no need to adjust the recipe...it's great the way it is. I also use this recipe at my job, where I bake for a living. I make hundreds of these, for the Russian Orthodox Christmas, observed at my place of employment.

-these are like a walnut shortbread bite with walnuts. I used salted butter and then added 1/2 tsp more salt. You NEED the salt to cut the sugar. A tbsp of milk in the batter as someone else suggested really helped bring my dough together, and I double coated them when they were warm and it makes a coating of icing all over the cookie. Really yummy!

Every year I try out a new Russian tea cake (Mexican wedding cake, snowball... )  recipe searching for one I love.  This is it. One baker recommended adding 1-2T of milk, and I would like to second that suggestion.  I made about 8 batches this year and they were fast, easy and great!

This is the exact recipe  my mother made over 50 years ago and I still use her original recipe card to make these every Christmas. I also roll them twice in the sugar, the first time when they’re still fairly hot  or else the sugar doesn’t stick. It’s also important not to overcook them or they’re dry.We call them jumjills though, based on a dragon in a children’s story who happily ate little nut cookies  of  that name the villagers made for him in exchange for not burning down their houses.

They were way undercooked. Next time, I would cook them for 14 minutes. Very disappointing for the amount of work it is to roll each one.

These look simple but they're not. They came out gummy tasting and refused to be coated in powdered sugar. I don't know what I did wrong. The cakes also didn't stay round and flattened out on the bottom. The batter was a bit crumbly so I followed a previous reviewer and added 1 tbsp milk.  I've never eaten russian tea cakes before but I was expecting them to be more cake like.

Excellent recipe! Taste is delicious &  the delicate texture crumbles beautifully with each bite! I ended up sifting the confectioners sugar over top before transferring to  the serving tray, instead of rolling due to sugar not sticking. I can serve these proudly to friendship & in-laws alike!

I followed the recipe verbatim, until the final step of coating with confectioners sugar. I tried rolling a few and it seemed like a messy and time consuming procedure. So I put all of the cookies on a plate, transferred the sugar to a flour sifter, and quickly sprinkled the cookies with a sugar layer that looked like fresh fallen snow. Oh, and since they were made for Christmas, I rolled half of them in red, green and white pereils, prior to baking. They turned out fabulous!

Easy and yummy recipe!  I used some of the tips from others:  I added some very finely chopped walnuts to the powdered sugar for dusting, I dusted the cookies with the sugar mixture twice, and added 1 TBS of milk to the dough to help it stick together better.  Additionally I found that they needed an additional 2 minutes of baking time.

I did have to add a little milk so the dough wasn’t too dry.  My first batch crumbled as soon as I touched them. After reading the other comments, I added the milk (about a teaspoon)  until the dough was slightly sticky and cooked them for about 18 minutes (baked them on stoneware).  They were then perfect!

I read all the reviews first and thus made a couple adjustments. I used pecans and put them in the food processor for a few pulses. Next I withheld some of the flour. I followed the rest of the instructions to the letter.  Very easy recipe.  I am concerned about the baking time though...12 minutes is way too short. I would advise 15-17.  I imagine it varies based on size of the cookie.

We have been making these in my family as long as I can remember- except with pecans. They are delicious. Not overly sweet. I put the powdered sugar in a bag & shake them around- about 3 cookies at a time. (While warm but not hot.)  It coats them in the sugar nicely & you don't have to do two coats.

My Grandma made these for many years. They are literally melt in your mouth cookies. She also shaped them into crescent shapes. Once she got tired, she opted for rolling them into ball shapes. haha. Excellent cookie, worthy of giving for gifts. Let them cool a few minutes when they come out of the oven (on the rack) before the first roll in the powdered sugar. IF you roll them while they're still too warm, they can literally fall apart.  I know from  years of experience, use at least double that in powdered sugar for rolling. You need 2 coatings. First one "disappears" which makes the 2nd roll in the sugar their signature snowy look. Thanks for the trip down memory lane! (This was one of 9 Christmas cookies Grandma baked.)

Whatever you wish to call these little nuggets, they are so delish!  I love shortbread, any kind.  These are super easy.  Only change I made was to add a pinch of salt since I like the salty/sweet thing.  And so much better than store bought!

I made 600 for a charity event.  Everyone likes these, even little kids.  I made some with nuts, some without.  The ones without went first.  I had two friends helping, but we did it in 3 hours.  Easy peasy!

I made it with walnuts and pecans. It was very delicious even without powdered sugar. It goes perfect with tea and coffee.

These were good. The recipe is simple; yet, the execution is a little challenging. After the ingredients are mixed together, it looks like crumbs. To roll the balls, I smooshed the dough in my hands. Instead of uniform, one inch balls, mine were oblong and various sizes. So my bake time was 15 minutes. Since I didn't have walnuts, I used pecans.  They were a different kind of cookie.

I absolutely LOOOOOOVE this recipe. Been making it for about 4 or 5 years now, and it never fails to impress! I basically have folks waiting all year for me to make these at Christmas time. They are so popular that I may have to make them more often. I used to make Russian Tea Cakes with a recipe that called for the dough to be chilled and that was very time consuming. I am able to make dozens of these at a time, like an assembly line. No more waiting! So grateful for the person who shared this recipe. My friends and family thank you, too!

I made these for the first time and followed the directions with the exception of using pecans instead of walnuts. My father and sister in law said they were perfect, my father said he had been looking for these cookies since he was a kid and hadn't been able to find them.

This is by far the easiest Russian Tea Cakes. They're truly delicious and they kind of melt in your mouth, which I love that. I would add a little less butter though, but other than that, these Russian Tea Cakes were really good and will definitely make them again in the future for Christmas morning.

I made these as presents for my family during Christmas, and they were a big hit. The only problem was that they were SO crumbly! It might have been that there wasn't enough butter. They were really good though, and I will probably make them again.

I used Nestle cocoa instead of Hershey. It gave it that deep chocolate flavor and color. I also kept it in the fridge overnight. Very good!

We love these and so did our neighbors who asked for the recipe! The only thing I did different was to grind the walnuts instead of chopping them. Thank you for this great recipe. Will be baking these again and again for sure!

I have made the Betty Crocker recipe for literally decades (you’d think I’d have it memorized by now....) but my book is in storage, so I turned to my trustworthy All Recipes community and - score! (As usual) I was a little nervous about all the comments regarding difficulty with the dough, but I had absolutely no trouble. In fact, they are LESS crumbly that BC. I put the powdered sugar in a bag (paper bag is great), let these cool for maybe 5 minutes then place 3-4 in the bag, roll them around to coat and return to cooling rack. This makes the sugar soft & adherent. When cool, I repeat for the perfect texture. Thank you for this!

I made these for my class when we studied Russia on our Christmas Around the World tour.  They were a huge hit.  I was afraid the dough would be too crumbly to work with, but once you balled it up in your hands it was easy to manipulate into smaller balls.  I baked them a little longer than recommended; somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes.  This was a great, easy recipe.  I am saving it to my favorites to make again.

Simple recipe easy enough to make. They were a big hit at our Christmas party. Thought that I made a mistake because they looked too dry until I started making the ball. Squeeze hard and it works!  Surprise.

I read some of the reviews to see how people did with it. I used 6 generous tablespoons of powdered sugar. I changed the order of assembly to typical cookie recipes. Creamed butter fluffy first, added in powdered sugar, then vanilla, then flour one cup at a time. Used the Kitchen Aid with the paddle until forming a ball almost then added in very finely chopped walnuts (all I had or I would have used pecans). Scooped with a one inch scoop, so all uniform nice and small. All on the pan and then I made them more round by hand. Baked 12 minutes at 350, but checked on them at 8 minutes. I use a baking stone and I swear by it. Perfect results every time. Let them cool a few minutes and measured and used only 1/3 cup of powdered sugar. Tossed them 6 at a time in a gallon baggie. They are perfect. pop in your mouth size - if you had to bite it, it would self destruct.

This is a generational recipe in my family as well.  My mother made them with margarine.  Butter is a MUST!  I made them exactly as written.  Merry Christmas!

My mom used to make these and I've always loved this recipe, so I thought I'd make a batch myself. The final product was very delicious and all my friends enjoyed them as well. The dough was a little dry so I added a tablespoon of water and the recipe came together nicely after that. It only took about 15 minutes for the cookies to cool enough that I could roll them in the powdered sugar. I also substituted half a teaspoon of almond extract for the vanilla. Overall, this recipe was delicious and I'll definitely make it again!

This was my first time making Russian Tea cookies. I love them, but have never attempted making them.  These were so quick and easy.  I did not experience the crumbly dough, but I had my butter sitting out for two days on the counter (only because I didn't have time to bake them when I thought I would).  I used almond extract with chopped  the walnuts very fine.  Also used my stand mixer.  Worked really great!

These probably came out like they are suppose to (though I think I rolled them in the powdered sugar too soon.  Mine do not look like the photos) but they are boring.  No one in my household likes them much.  Not worth all that walnut chopping.

Taste great, but awfully crumbly.  I'll try the tablespoon of milk suggested by another person.   The next day, they are wonderful.  Crumbly is all gone.

Delicious Russian Tea cookies. Fast and easy to prepare, just have the butter very soft to get the ingredients incorporated.
Will be a great cookie to include on the Cookie tray at Christmas!

My great grandma used to make these.  They are my favorite cookie.  I love how this recipe is so simple, and yet makes the cookies taste exactly like the ones my great grandma made.
I followed Chef John's instructions for coating in confectioners' sugar:  "Let cool exactly 5 minutes then roll in a shallow bowl full of confectioners' sugar. Let cookies cool completely and toss them again in the confectioners' sugar."

I would definitely make these again.  They are best when warm, and are amazing balls of powdered sugar goodness.  They are quick and easy, and a great cure for boredom.  The recipe makes a lot.

This is a really easy and quick recipe and the tea cskes are great. I noticed a couple of people suggesting adding water if the dough was crumbly. They are supposed to be very dry and light. I wouldn't add water unless you absolutely have to.  I add an extra 2 Tablespoons of powdered sugar to the dough. I love these!

Lovely Holiday cookie. I used real butter and mine turned out tender and moist.  Maybe how they turn out depends on the part of the world in which you live and the level of humidity.  I just threw all the ingredients into the mixer and let it run. HA! and used a cookie scoop for uniform size.  Sent the recipe home with a guest that very night!

I substituted pecan pieces for almonds, I will for sure, grind pecans in my food processor when I make them in the future. I had to add a little water to make them less crumbly. These tasty little cookies are great with any hot beverage you may care for.

Made exactly as written except put in the fridge for about 10 minutes since they were getting very warm, cooked only for 10 minutes. I took them out at soon as the tops started to crack. They are delicious!

these are very good. I usually make a different recipe, and these taste the same. However, I found them very dry in the mouth.  I think that if the balls were smaller, they would be easier to eat.  One inch balls are really too large, as they do expand a bit after baking.

I remember making a version of these as a kid.  These were better than the version I remember making.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I made sure to grind them up really good.  I probably added an extra tbsp. or so of the nuts.  My oven bakes really fast, so I lowered the temperature to 325 as I didn't want them burnt on the bottom.   Like others said, I rolled them in sugar while they were still warm and that helps a lot.  I also drizzled some melted chocolate on some of them and made them crescent cookies instead of rounds.

Great tea cake!  Makes a pretty small batch, so I'd double or triple if making to share.  However, they are very tasty, even without the nuts (we have allergies in our family).

Soooo Good!  I followed the advice of a couple other reviews - I used less flour so it wouldn't be so crumbly, used pecans instead of walnuts, (which I ground with a coffee grinder to make it super fine) and baked for 20 min. at 310 instead. I made sure the butter was room temp. and used a couple drops more vanilla. I also rolled them in powder sugar when they were slightly warm so I only needed to roll them once.  Mine didn't keep the perfect ball shape, but they still looked nice and melted in your mouth with minimal crumbling.  I'm about to make more now.  My family was crest fallen when they realized we were giving them all away for little Christmas presents.

I like the taste of these cookies but they are very crumbly and dry.  I am not sure why since the dough was very sticky when rolling .

These cookies are always a hit, I have made them for years because they are my favorite.  My husband, who says he cannot eat powdered sugar, eats all of them unless I stow them away in the freezer!  I do bake them a little longer, we like the bottom very brown, just not burnt.

These were very simple to make.  My husband thought they were very tasty. I thought they were a little bland and maybe a little dry.  I always make my first try exactly as the recipe calls for.  I think next time I will experiment with these a little more Not sure what I will add or change yet.  As we eat this batch I will try to imagine a way to make them just a little better.

I will use this recipe every year! I toasted the chopped walnuts first. I must have made my cookies too large, because they took 17 minutes to bake.

Doubled the recipe and used 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 pecans. Ground them until they were turning into nut butter. If the dough seems too crumbly, keep mixing and it will come together. Also used almond emulsion instead of vanilla and much nicer! 
Rolled cookies warm from the oven in powdered sugar and then a second coating after they cooled. They're delicious and even better than I remembered.

So simple so easy so good. It ain't Christmas till my kitchen smells like Russian tea cookies! This is the easiest best recipe. Whipped up a quick batch after the kids went to bed for our cookie walk at school tomorrow. Whoever said they were time consuming clearly never baked a cookie or a cake in their life. Make.these.now.

Really tasty.  Followed the recipe exactly except I added a Tbsp of milk as someone suggested.  Not sure I really had to do that.  I rolled in the sugar first after cooking and then sprinkled some more sugar on.  It seems to look nicer when the sugar is sprinkled on through a sifter.

I remixed this one right off the bat, but it wouldn't have been a success without a great base recipe. I subbed a fifth of the flour for cocoa powder, added a teaspoon of instant coffee, and nixed the nuts. They went over VERY well in our house. "Moist" was the choice descriptor in their feedback. And they're so cute!

Loved them. I didn't expect to and made them solely because of the great reviews and simplicity of the recipe. I Love chocolate and savory snacks. But these were perfect for coffee or tea. I was worried they might become melted balls of mush, but the bake time was perfect. A few did become crumbly but it wasn't an issue for me.

I loved this recipe. It was simple and easy to make, which I like. I read through the comments first and, like some people have said, added a tablespoon of milk. I also made the tea cakes with almonds instead of walnuts and I think it tasted great. To say the least, I love this recipe

I loved this recipe! Made it with my friend and we had so much fun. We made it smaller than the recipe had said to but it cooked perfectly. Instead of letting them cool after baking we put it right into the powdered sugar so it would melt right onto the cakes and stay better, this proves to work quite well! My friend and I had a great time making a display and in it we made this "icing" which was milk and confectioners sugar stirred together to a sticky consistency (no real measurements). All I would suggest is to go light on the milk so then it is less watery and the rest is just preference. I would suggest this for anyone who wants a quick and easy dessert!

This is such a beloved shortbread-style classic.  My family traditionally prefers pecans to walnuts, and I toast them gently before chopping.  I also prefer to bake the cookies until they lightly caramelize (golden glow), the flavor takes a splendid ramp upward.  If you fret over GMO cornstarch in common 10X sugar, you can whiz granulated sugar in a sharp-bladed blender until it is pulverized to powder, no worries.  Try adding a gentle grating of nutmeg, mmmm.

I can't believe that someone thought these were "so time consuming". ;-) Actually, This recipe was one of the easiest and quickest ones I've Ever gone by. So, remember that you can use 1/2 a cup of Confectioners powdered sugar, and 1 1/2 Tsp Vanilla. Delish! **Bake for (20) minutes however. With nuts are great...but without are good too. My daughter doesn't like nuts. Yep, you heard right. Blessings, to all!! "MY FAVORITE COOKIE" now.

Most delicious delicate cookie I've ever eaten.  I do chop the waluts much finer in a single serve upside down blender, and make my own powdered sugar.
  No need to buy powdered sugar ever again. 
You need to have an upside down blender.  Use small cup and the mulling blade.  Add it half way with regular sugar, tighten lid, put on spinner twist it on, you will see the magic happen turning regular sugar into powdered sugar in a matter of seconds.  Just make sure to check it, that it's all fluffy and has no grains of sugar. Enjoy!

At first I didn't even know what Russian Tea Cakes were but they looked good so I decided to make them.... They were so yummy and sweet, the walnuts gave it a good crunchy taste. Loved them!!!!!

LOVE these cookies.  Made them for the first time this Christmas (2015).  I don't believe in rating recipes that I've made changes to.  I made them twice.  The first time exactly as the recipe is listed.  Cookies were excellent and I'd give them 4 stars.  For the second batch I added an additional 2 tablespoons of confectioners' sugar...for a total of a 1/2 cup.  Neither time did I have dough that was too dry.  If you are, you're probably measuring your flour improperly.  Ensure that you scoop your dry ingredients into the measuring cup and level it off.  Don't use the measuring cup to scoop the flour...it compresses the flour and you'll be adding too much.  With the extra confectioners sugar, I'd give this recipe 5 stars.  Crazy about them!  I've added them to my yearly Christmas cookie list.

Fantastic!  So easy to make and delicious.  My aunt used to make these cookies and I haven't had them in 20 years.  This recipe brings back wonderful memories.  I will definitely make these again, and not just at Christmas!

Loved it, easy to make I used pecans instead and added a little more vanilla essence.
I will definitely make this recipe  again.

I don't understand the comment that said these were time-consuming -- in fact they were fast and easy. I thought that would be great and I thought these were going to be like Mexican Wedding Cakes. Not really, and was disappointed in the outcome.  These cookies aren't at all sweet...and in fact pretty tasteless. I followed the recipe to a T.

Melted into flat saucers that crumbled when touched. Is this normal? I followed the recipe exactly with the addition of 1 tbsp of milk for the crumbly dough.

This is the exact recipe I was looking for with a small amount of powdered sugar rather than granulated sugar. They are easy to make, the whole recipe fits on one large pan (you don't need much space because they don't spread out), and they are everything I've come to expect from a Russian teacake.

I didn't change a thing.

Super good stuff. I do add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon maple extract. I also use pecans. I know I have changed the recipe, but I have just adapted it for my taste. The base recipe is great.

I made these exactly as written, and the dough was too dry and crumbly. I added appr. 1T. milk, and that fixed that, but my cookies flattened out a lot, so they do not look nice and round, as in the pics, and they crumbled when I tried to roll them in the powdered sugar (they had cooled on the cookie sheet for a good 15 mins.).

I used pecans and pistachio nuts, chopped them finely and then roasted them just enough to bring out their wonderful flavor.
1/2 cup each and followed the recipe and the tea cake was AwEsOmE!

Amazing! These have to be the best cookies I ever made. They didn't come out completely round, but they melt in your mouth! I also recommend rolling them twice in confectioners sugar. Be careful when transporting, as they are very delicate and crumble easily.

I brought these to a dinner with my friends and they loved it!
These cakes are simply wonderful, though the dough is crumbly. Take my advice as I say add a little bit of milk and just keep rolling the dough until it molds in your hands. But, over all these are great! You HAVE to try them!

I would spray the pan lightly because it stuck to my pan or it was just the pan i was using, I would defiantly make them again next year for Christmas.

I have tried many different recipes but these were Perfect..Don't get discourages when the dough looks like it's not going to form, just keep combining and it will come together. Once you begin to form them they hold  great. I baked according to the directions and it might look like they aren't done but trust me, when you take them out, let them cool and roll in sugar, they are moist and soft...NEW FAMILY FAVORITE....

These were so good! Easy and taste really good and not too sweet!!!!

I also added unsweetened cocoa powder to the decoration powdered sugar!
Also I used almonds instead of walnuts.
Overall, a wonderful recipe and I would definitely make it again!

I've made these every Christmas for many, many years.  To make them extra special, grind the nuts very fine in a food processor, food chopper or a coffee grinder.  Also, roll them in powdered sugar twice -- once when they come out of the oven (when still hot but not too hot to handle), and again with powdered sugar with vanilla seeds mixed in.  To do this, split open a vanilla bean lengthwise, scrape out the seeds with a knife, and mix well into the powdered sugar.

Don't be afraid to get aggressive with this dough. I actually just washed my hands a ton and then used my hands to mix it all together. If I hadn't done that, I'd still be stirring this dough together. I also replaced the walnuts with pecans. Everyone absolutely loved them. Thing is, they don't exactly spread out so there isn't much need to space them too far apart on the cookie sheet.

I made this recipe with a class of 8 students I am teaching in summer school. I liked that it was easy-my students are between 8-10 years old. They were able to do this without much teacher help, and most do not have any baking experience. We did not put in the walnuts (kids and walnuts), and to 1/2 a batch (we made 2 batches) I added 3 drops Young Living Citrus Bliss blend of essential oil and that batch was also delicious. Sorry if that offends the recipe. This was so easy that when I got home, I made a 1/2 batch with my 11-year-old son, who loved the cookies. You will not be disappointed.

Perfect recipe! I made these for Christmas party and I can't wait to serve them with after dinner tea and coffee on Christmas Eve. This is a very simple recipe- great for rookie bakers like myself. My friend showed me a great tip for shaping the balls. Really squeeze the dough in your hand- this warms the butter and allows you to make a nice shaped ball which holds up to baking.

The Russian Tea Cakes were not at all what I expected them to be. The video is what caught my eye and because I was trying to find a simple xmas cookie recipe for my church "AROUND THE WORLD CRHRISTMAS DINNER". We have this every year. Each member is to prepare a dish or dessert that is representing another Country and set up a table with information about the dish or dessert. Didn't think it was going to take the time it did and wasnt as easy as the video. Dissapointed

This recipe is spot on the same as my grandmothers cookies and the best you'll find. I do add about a tbsp of water to the mix to help with the dry or crumbly texture people have been talking about. I make them every year for all of our neighbors and every year, they gobble them up and ask for the recipe!!!  I've made them with walnuts, pecans, no nuts, colored granulated sugar, etc. and whatever you make them with, this recipe is fail proof and classic!!!!  Winning!!!

Pretty good.  My variation is 1) Unsalted butter. 2) Preheat to 400 degrees and 8-10 minutes baking time until set, not brown, and 3) after the mixing, chill dough for 1 hour.  The results are much more consistent.  Roll once in powdered sugar while warm, and once more when cooled.  I put several cookies in a pie tin and agitate the tin to roll them.

I just made this according to the recipe. I knocked on a neighbor's to offer some. Before I could say anything, he asked where I got them. Turns out he had lived two years in Russia. He ate 3 right then and there. He told me they are exactly like what he had in Russia, except he said they use less sugar. He was still grinning when I left.

First time I have ever made these and this recipe came out great.  They were just the perfect texture that I remember when my grandmother used to make these.  I do not at all understand those whose came out crumbly or flat.  I did this recipe 100% by the ingredients and instructions and they came out perfect.  Once my dough is mixed I do mold it and pat it into a nice ball first to eliminate working with the crumbly dough.  Then I just rip off an amount that is right and roll in my hands. The reviewer who stated butter has to be super soft, is also spot on.  The butter has to be very very soft but not melted for the dough to have a less crumbly texture.  All I can say is give this a try, these were great!  Thank you for the recipe!

The best cookie!!!!!  Very easy to make,...  Grew up on these cookies..  my Irish mom made every Christmas,  but never put nuts in them.  The first time I made them my father in law stopped by and ate every single cookie, that's how good they are..

Simple, classic cookie. Since I live at altitude (4500 ft.) I add 1/2-1 T cream to hold the dough together. Easy to make and everybody has a story to tell about their family's version. Great cookie.

It was delicious, but I used almonds instead of walnuts one time, and no nuts another time, and everyone liked it!

These are yummy and easy to make.  I use whatever nuts I have and chop them up in the blender to a fairly fine texture.  I use my hands to mix the dough and then its not crumbly.

Its really funny, I was looking for an easy, but different cookie to make a few days ago. I saw this one, believe it or not, it is now my family's favorite cookie.  Just an hour after I baked the Russian Tea Cakes, all but one was eaten. And that last one was hidden by me so I could at least have one Tea Cake with my afternoon chai.

I made only one mistake when I made these cookies.. I didn't make enough.  These were fantastic my husband is already asking me to make another batch. I didn't alter this recipe except I partially melted the butter to cream with the vanilla.  I found these cookies were extremely easy to make it took me less than the 20 mins prep.

I was looking for this recipe for past year, all others were either chewy or just plain hard.  Definitely should say finely ground nuts, as mine turned out perfect I shook them 3 at a time in paper bag of conf. sugar.  saves a lot of time.

This is a wonderful base recipe.  My cousin has a similar one and she calls them butter balls lol! We agreed that the recipe is very versatile and can be modified by changing the nuts and extracts, and even the coating.  My favorite so far is almonds with almond extract.  She's done a pecan with vanilla extract and coated them in salted caramel cocoa instead of powdered sugar.  I can't wait to continue experimenting with this!

I just won an office cookie bake-off with this recipe.  I followed it as written, but caution that these cookies burn FAST, so you really have to keep an eye on them.  11 minutes was the sweet spot for me.

I don't know what went wrong, but this did not turn out. The cookies were grainy like sand.  After reading the reviews I thought they were going to be delicious, but I was sadly surprised.  I'm not sure if I just did something wrong or what, but I won't even be attempting this again.

This is my favorite Christmas cookie of all time.   The only changes I made were to use toasted Almonds instead of walnuts because I live overseas and can't get walnuts.  Then I used almond extract instead of vanilla.  I think these changes give a great recipe just a little something extra special and it always gets raves and requests for the recipe.  "There's just something different" they all say as they reach for another.

Growing up, my mother use to make this cookie every christmas. In stead of using walnuts or pecans, she always used cashews and everyone loved them. Now that I am in charge of the christmas cookies, I make them the same way. The rich, butteriness of the cashew goes great with the sweetness of the cookie!

Thanks for the recipe.  Since I'm not a huge fan of walnuts I substitute with chopped macadamia nuts.

Gotta admit that I personally was only okay with this recipe, but I will say they were GORGEOUS, and a huge hit with the coworkers. Disappeared very quickly. So I may just be the exception.

Every year I add a new cookie to my holiday baking and this will definitely be a keeper going forward. These are light and delicate, a nice alternative to the standard cookie. I used pecans and will try walnuts and/or a combo this year. I did freeze these over a month before Christmas and they tasted just baked.

Have eaten these before and wanted to make them.  Read the reviews--and it seemed to be a hit.
First time to make them.  Nice easy recipe.  
It lives up the reviews.  These were better than I had eaten before! Will make again!  I think we have a new tradition in our family!  To make these cookies!
Thanks!

This recipe needs a bit of salt, and maybe a little more sugar. Very easy to make. Does not yield a large amount; recommend doubling the recipe.

I couldn't find my recipe for tea cakes this year so I had to try something new. I made this exactly as written. It calls for a lot less sugar than my old recipe which is great. I always use unsalted butter so I was skeptical about there being no salt in the recipe. 
This was great! I didn't miss the sugar or salt at all. It had just the right amount of flaky/richness that I love about Russian Tea Cakes. I will make these again and again and won't make any changes.
Thanks so much for my new go-to recipe!

these cookies are just right, not to sweet but sweet enough and not hard to make. I did take others advice and made sure my butter was room temp and I grounded the walnuts into very small pieces.

I loved how easy these were to make!
My adjustments:

1). I used Vanilla-Butter-Nut instead of just Vanilla extract.

2). I made smaller than 1 inch balls- I like to have these as a one-bite cookie. :)

3). I rolled them in powdered sugar immediately after coming out of the over, and then again after they'd cooled. 

They're PERFECT!

Easy recipe. Worked very well, it took a little bit a hard mixing by hand to bring the dough together at first but turned out great.

I made these for the first time tonight and they turned out great. I didn't read closely and sugared the first batch before i baked them instead of after but they were still ok. i took other reviewer's advice: added a little milk and it made the dough the perfect consistency, ground the walnuts a little finer in the food processor, and  rolled them in regular sugar then twice in powdered sugar. these were quick and easy to make although i did end up with an inch of powdered sugar all over my kitchen...

What an excellent recipe!  Made this for a cookie exchange and gifts by the dozen.  Easy to make, followed many useful tips, and while aiming to make 10 dozen, actually made 178 tea cakes!  Thanks for the recipe.

I love these! This is the recipe I have always used for Mexican wedding cookies. Since my family doesn't like walnuts, I substituted with almonds. These are absolutely delicious- I have made huge batches of these for parties and they are a hit!

I loved how easy these were to make and so tasty...my whole family devoured them all as soon as them came out...the only problem I did not like, was when I was rolling them I was trying to shake th powdered sugar in a plastic bin and the cookies crumbled, so I just hand rolled it. Thanks for sharing, I have this recipe saved!!

Just like the ones I fell in love with...I had these for the first time at a Christmas party and made the Betty Crocker recipe recently, but felt it was missing something. It called for more flour, so maybe that's why they didn't taste as buttery and delicate as I remembered. Also, it said to bake at 400 degrees, and 350 degrees from this recipe definitely worked much better. These cookies were very crumbly, so shaping them into balls wasn't easy-- but I found that I could press and pack it tight into a melon ball sized ice cream scooper and they came out perfect every time. Thanks for sharing this recipe!! Now I just have to resist eating them all before tomorrow. :)

I have been using this recipe for years.  It's my ole standbye for my company cookie swap.  When you're making 8 dozen cookies, you want a recipe that's easy and a cookie that's tasty.  These cookies are both.  The only thing that I do differently is to bake them for 17 mins - which is probably just my oven.    Otherwise, no changes necessary.

I might have done this wrong, but they dough was a bit crumbly for me and frustrating to form. This might also be because I was making about 7 million cookies and was in a bit of a time crunch. Oh well. The flavor was wonderful and they turned out well in the end which is what's important! :) Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were wonderful and melt in your mouth.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any problems at all.  The dough was a little crumbly but I kept mixing past the crumbly stage and the dough held together just fine.  I also ground the walnuts very finely in my magic bullet.

Excellent recipe. They are so easy and delicious. I was concerned about the dough being crumbly, but like others said- as soon you start rolling it, it's fine. I did use walnuts, but I like almonds better so I will try those next time. Thanks!

These are surprisely delicious!! After lunch, I was ready for my dessert. I picked up this tea cake and it was like I never even took a bite. It kind of melted in my mouth. It was so good! The dough was NOT crumbly at all. Maybe it was because I softened my butter a lot (not melted) in the microwave. I think next time I will leave out 4 tablespoons of butter just to save on some calories and add milk if needed. Also, use a tablespoon to scoop out your dough to get the exact serving size.

these are amazing! Though, they sound kind of familiar, a recipe I have called MEXICAN Tea Cookies. I guess it doesn't matter what they're called-they're great, especially with the suggested hot chocolate.

Very good! I always make these for Christmas, they are a favorite of mine. I have a little trick that involves mixing cocoa powder into the decorating sugar... mmm! (I bet some mint extract would be awesome in this mixture! haven't tried it yet...) Also, without the cocoa colored sugar makes for added fun around holidays and such.

Have made these wonderful cookies for years. I triple the recipe, using half the walnuts called for.  I finely crush the walnuts in a zip-lock bag--before adding to mixture.  I roll the dough into smaller balls---thumb print the center of the dough and add a fruit preserve to the 'well'.  Bake as directed--give or take a few minutes. When completely cooled, sprinkle confectioners' sugar over cookies.  I use a tea strainer.  They are beautiful to the eye, not too sweet and all my friends' favorite cookie.

Funny-I never knew the real name of these cookies. We always called them snow balls but I could never find a recipe. Well -I spotted them at a local market and gobbled one for dessert that night. That was it-came to Allrecipes and here it is! I made these in a very short time and my Honey couldn't keep out of them. Love them-they make great hostess gifts when placed in a cute little box. Many thanks for sharing!

These were wonderful and simple. My kids loved helping me ball the dough and coat them in sugar. Lesson learned though, let them cool all the way before you coat in sugar or else you get a huge mess.

These were pretty great. Really delicious with a steaming cup of green tea. I used pecans instead of walnuts though. I've heard walnuts are better for these little cakes, so I'll probably make them again sometime and try walnuts instead. :)

I leave out the walnuts and try not to overdust the cookies with confectioner's sugar (preferring less sweetness personally).  These are one of my favorite cookies ever to make, resembling a recipe I had as a kid.  Excellent recipe!

I've never had tea cakes before, so I have no real point of comparison, but these were pretty tasty. I made these for Christmas gifts, though I would not recommend giving them in decorative cardboard boxes, as the butter seeps out and makes enormous oil spots. I'm more of a moist cookie/chocolate/super sweet fan, but as the name suggests, these would be fab with tea.

These cookies are really good! However, I always end up needing to add a few tablespoons of milk in order for the dough to not be so crumbly. Otherwise, great recipe :)

I didn't have nuts, but my littlest urchin really wanted me to try to recreate the tea cake he had yesterday, so I made it with a touch more flour and almond extract. I o'ded a bit on the flour and added 1 tbs milk as some reviewers suggested and got a lovely, melt-on-your-mouth cookie. And the little urchin ate seven of them right after they came out. Success!

After moving 3 times in 18 months, I lost my tried and true Russian Teacake recipe that I'd made with my daughters at Christmas for decades.(please don't make me tell how MANY!) Anyway, I found this one and it looked like the one I'd always made. It was perfect in every way and it's my new "traditional" teacake recipe.

These were very simple to make and delicious to eat! (I ate FAR too many myself!) I substituted pecans for walnuts, and probably chopped them a bit too fine in my food processor - it might have been nice to have a few larger pieces mixed in. Per a previous review, I did use salted butter, but I might try 1 stick salted and 1 unsalted next time, since it did come out just a TAD salty. Everyone at work loved them, though! They went FAST, and everyone who came by had a different name for them! Snowballs or Mexican Wedding Cakes were what I heard most often. Definitely a keeper!

This was my first time making the cookies and they were tasty but I felt like they were too soft. Are these supposed to come out crunchy or soft? My first batch was too soft so I baked the second batch for 14 minutes and I think that helped a little. I'd like to try again but would def take any advice on how to make them a little crunchier. :)

first time I made these... because I was leary of over baking them... I think they were not quite done, the outsides were still tacky and so it was hard to keep the powdered sugar.. .powdery... I may try again, but as for taste... not sure what they are supposed to taste like... they didn't really taste like much, almost like a shortbread/bland taste... but I'll try it again some other day....

I couldn't remember which cookbook I owned that had this cookie recipe in that I made last year so I found this recipe and tried it.  I no longer need to find another russian tea cake recipe.  This is better than the recipe I couldn't find.  It was like little pockets of heaven that melt in your mouth.  FYI though, you have to wait for them to cool completely before coating in powdered sugar.  Also, I tried one after having cooled and coated with sugar and i found they are 100% much better after waiting a day before eating.  These were the 1st cookies to disappear (and the ones eating them usually preferred peanut butter, choc chip, or oatmeal raisin cookies.)  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!!  Almost forgot...I made this recipe in advance and placed in freezer (as I learned this tip from a friend when making several batches of cookie doughs).  Thawed 2 days in fridge before I was to bake them.  Used small cookie scoop to scoop out and gently rolled with my hands a few seconds.  They kept their circular form.  Enjoy!

Excellent recipe!!  Took these to a party today, and they were really well received.  I wish I could figure out how to keep them perfectly round through the baking process.  Mine looked like little haystacks.  But it sure didn't hinder the taste or texture.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

These are delicious! I added 1 more tablespoon of the confectioner's sugar to the batter, and they turned out perfect. My 7 year old did not care for them though.

I love this recipe! These are the most delicious cookies. I always bring them to parties and give them as gifts and people love them. The dough is a little dry, so I added a few tablespoons of water to help it come together. I like to flatten mine so they are discs rather than balls. I think they stay crisper that way, if you are not going to eat them all right away. Which is difficult, as they are scrumptious!

Phenomenal! I followed the recipe to the T and the balls came out fantastic! They melt in your mouth and are perfect for christmas gifts. I wasn't sure if it was done after 12 mins since they looked pretty pale, I tried one and it was perfect! I rolled it in icing sugar while still warm and then again once completely cool. I used ready chopped nuts which were a mix of peanuts, almonds and walnuts. Definitely will do these again, so easy! Thanks!

A++++! These were fun to make and turned out just like my Moms. 36 is NOT enough, I'm going to make more today with almonds and pecans. I scaled back the nut component a bit with great results. I rested the dough in the fridge for  45 mins to cool it down before handling, not sure if this effected the texture. They melt in your mouth.

The recipe looked quite simple. And I love these cookies. I was excited about trying this recipe with all these nice reviews. The dough turned out to be too dry to roll. Did the butter need to be really soft and warm? It does not say. I still managed to roll into balls and baked them. But after rolling them into confectioner's sugar, I am disappointed by the taste and texture. I followed the recipe without making any adjustments but it just seems too dry, the vanilla is barely noticeable...

I followed this recipe to the letter and my cookies turned out flat and fall apart just by looking at them. They taste great, but far from what I was looking for. I will not try making this again.

I used pecans instead of walnuts. They came out amazing. Huge hit at my house, I need to make another batch for Christmas. Make these at least a day in advance, they're better the day(s) after.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect, some people might have had problems with the dough staying together because their chopped nuts were too big. I chopped pre-chopped nuts and got lazy towards the end so there was a variation in size. Cakes with smaller nuts stayed together better before and after baking. Definitely roll in the sugar a second time, they look prettier that way.

I am definately NOT a baker, but even I can make these.  And, everyone loves them. Looks like you put a lot of time and effort into them, but they are easy and enjoyed by all (although by the time they get off the cooling rack, there are a few less, just for tasting of course  :)

Always wanted to make these and thought it would be too hard. This recipe is simple, easy and absolutely delicious! I did as suggested and did a double coating and baked them just a tad longer about 15-16 mins. excellent!

I made these while my parents were away Christmas shopping. I piled them up high on a plate and placed them on the table. When they came home they were blown away. They told me they had had them before, but that the ones I made were by far the best. they ate them continuosly for the rest of the day. They told me they were the best cookies they had ever had and to make them whenever I could. They have told the rest of my family and I am expected to make them again for Christmas. Can't wait to get even MORE praise! Thanks so much for this recipe it's such a hit.

Very nice. I could not find my mother's recipe for these so looked online and this seemed close. Some people have questioned: I used sweet butter (unsalted) and did not add salt. They were good. Depends on what you like. Nice recipe.

Tasty cookie, however, very crumbly and messy for younger kids. I chopped the nuts finely to help avoid this problem, but will also add 1T milk next time as recommended by another reviewer. Easy cookie to whip up in no time!

These are the cookies my grandmother and mother made.  Unfortunately, they took the recipe with them when they passed away (too quickly).  Anyway, thank you so much for sharing this recipe - now I can make them, too!  Thanks again and Merry Christmas!

This is a favorite holiday cookie.  I've started substituting roasted unsalted cashews for the more traditional walnuts.  The cashews have a buttery taste and complement the cookie well.

Very good, but not quite great. With about a billion Christmas cookie recipes out there, there is tough competition though. On the plus side, with the powdered sugar and all, these are really easy to make look really good - less effort for a good impression!

These were very good. I do think the walnuts should be very, VERY finely chopped -- If I had a food processor, I would have made them more of a powder than anything else. I also made coating them faster by baking them on top of parchment paper and then dumping them (1/2 a batch at a time, right out of the oven) into a gallon ziploc bag with the confectioners sugar. A little shaking, and they're done.  I had some issues with the baking time and not as much crunch on the outer layer as I wanted, but I think that's more due to my own mistakes/oven than the recipe.

My mom loved it, I'm guessing because it wasn't too sweet but just right. I on the other hand, thought it could have used a little more sweetness. It reminds me of the powdered donuts... The inside of my russian tea cakes came out a little hard... ARE THEY SUPPOSE TO COME OUT HARD ON THE INSIDE???? anyways I'll give this a 4 since my mom loved it so much!! Thanks for the recipe!

These are one of my favorite cookies. I like to use pecans, just a personal preference. I made 100 of these to serve at my wedding reception and they freeze well just touch up with powdered sugar when you plate them. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

You should definitely try this! My dad is kind of on a diet, so he said he would not be eating much... but he changed his mind once after his first bite! Now, everyone is asking for more teacakes. Today I will be making more for sure :)

These cookies melt in your mouth!  I left out the walnuts - we like them plain.  They stayed fresh for a long time in a sealed container.  This recipe will go in my "favorite cookies" file.

I made this recipe on the holidays.  I love these cookies.  I gave this 5 stars. This is similar to Russian Tea Cake III except these directions are more explicit.  Very nice cookie, easy to make and a big hit in our house.

The dough came out as expected.The flavor I was not that impressed with and a bit to doughy.Overall they are quick but could be a bit better.As a lover of the russian tea cakes.I have tried numerous recipies this is in the top 5, I dont know it is just missing some flavor though.

We make these every year for Christmas.  Not being home this year I found myself without my recipe and tried this one.  Excellent and super easy as always.

Great recipe, very easy to make.  These cookies store very well too.  I prefer to use toasted pecans in my cookies, but that is just a preference.

Great holiday recipe and you can never go wrong with Russian Tea Cakes! The ladies at work are always hooked on them every year! The only addition was adding 1 tsp. of milk. Helps the dough come together easier.

Very good and easy.  I used pecans since hubby is allergic to walnuts.  I'll probably experiment w/ another nut next time(or a mixture).

Very easy and sooo good!  I have always loved this kind of cookie, and am excited to have a good recipe to make it myself.  The only thing that I am wondering about, is the second day the powdered sugar got kind of wet feeling rather than powdery.  Anyone know why?

Delicious!  Very tender, but still held together without breaking up when rolling in sugar like some butter cookies do.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I'd give them 10 stars if I could!!! Didn't change a thing (except I whipped my butter with sugar for couple minutes to make them even more delicate and tender). Use the best butter you can find, cause it gives them a strong flavour.
My only comlain is that my tooth were totally unhappy (they are sensitive) because of the sweetness)) So beware))

This recipe was pretty good.  I doubled it and did make 1 inch balls, but did not get anywhere near 72 cookies.  Next time I will make my balls much smaller and I will add 1/2 cup more flour(if I double the recipe, 1/4 cup if not doubled).  I love these cookies at Christmas time.

I have never written a review before but felt I had to write one on these.  These were the BEST I have ever made.  As my kids said these cookies were the "bomb".  I made the recipe just as it was written.  They were not dry at all. Thank you for a recipe we will use from now on!

I loved this recipe. However, when i mixed everything together, the dough was dry. I had to add water to the dough just to have a better consistency. Over all the cookie was delicious.

I have made these twice this week.  Did not find the mix crumbly at all. I just mixed until a ball formed. Also, I toasted the walnuts the first time. The second time I used almonds, vanilla/almond extract and some cardamon. These are awesome!!

Turned out just perfect!  I used half butter and half butter-flavored shortening.  I cooked them for 14 minutes and the bottoms did not brown at all.

A friend of mine couldn't remember the name of these cookies but I knew he was asking about russian tea cookies. This is absolutely the best recipe for Russian tea cake (cookies) I have ever used and each year I am asked to make many dozens! So thank you, THEAUNT708, for helping me renew my ability to make these wonderful treats!

This recipe was good.  When I mixed it together, it seemed as if it had too much flour.  After a little more mixing, it did come together.  Some of the cookies broke when rolling them in powdered sugar, so be gentle with them.

These are always my favorite cookies during the holiday season! I was actually out of butter when I made this recipe [d'oh] and ended up using light butter/canola spread in its place. Surprisingly neither the taste nor the texture were negatively affected. Awesome recipe! :D

Super easy, delicate shortbread taste.  Made with pecans instead, they tasted just like pecan sandies.  Dough is crumbly but very easy to work with.

These did not taste very good to me.  I think next time I will cream regular sugar into the butter and grind up regular sugar to coat these in.  All I tasted was walnut and the cornstarchy sugar.  Obviously, these are not meant to appeal to everyone's tastes so I'm not saying they weren't okay.  I did rate this recipe three stars because the texture was fine.  I just would not make these for anyone with my tastes.  I'm so glad I halved the recipe instead of baking a whole batch.

I had never had a Russian Tea Cake so I didn't know what I was in for. Yummers! I rolled mine in cane sugar then baked them. I was taking them to a get together and I think the powdered sugar would have been too messy. I did add some milk to pull it together as others suggested. These are fabulous tasting. The cane sugar gave them a crunch which just made it all the better!

I have made these cookies numerous times. They are always a big hit. Very fluffy and light. Great flavor. I will be baking these for many years.

THE BEST!!!  I made a batch and gave them away as Christmas gifts, following the recipe precisely.  They turned out wonderful!  I needed more for a holiday gathering but stupidly substituted margarine thinking it couldn't make too much of a difference...they were so different.  USE BUTTER!  But you all probably knew that already :)

My bachelor brother requested these for Christmas and by the time the holidays were over I maded them 3 times.  Everyone loved them.  I added the 1 Tbs milk and used 1/2 tsp almond extract as others suggested.  The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 is they are not as "melt in your mouth" as other recipes but they are sure easier to make.

They were easy to make.  At first I was a bit concerned because the dough wasn't pulling together. It eventually pulled together.  Tasted ok, but nothing more.  Lacked flavor.  I will probably be using my original recipe.

Not exactly my cup of tea, but still nice. I baked these to give to a Russian friend for Christmas, and I hope she'll recognize and enjoy them. 
I followed the tip I got in here by adding a tablespoon of milk and chop the walnuts finely to avoid crumbling dough, and that worked very well.
If I'm going to make these again, I would definitely use vanilla seeds instead of the extract. I think that would make a big difference. Also, I wouldn't chop the walnuts as finely as I did. I think I lost some of the taste by doing that.

This is the 1st time I have ever made this type of cookie and let me just say FABULOUS!!!!!!! I have heard from others that these turn our dry and this recipe proved them all wrong. Perfect in every way from the melt in your mouth flavor to the moist center. Excellent recipe!!!

I quadrupled this recipe to give as gifts at Christmas.  I added almost all the flour and found that it was going to be too dry, so I added a couple Tbsp of water per one reviewer.  It made it so that it stuck together just enough to form balls. Again, if the walnut pieces are too big, the cookies will fall apart.  These were very nice. Can't wait to have a couple spare ones with some jasmine tea.

Every time I made these cookies, they would crumble in the powdered sugar.  These did not.  The dough was more dense but the end result was the same.  I sugar them when they are still a little warm and then again when they are cool.

I am glad I could find this recipe here. I made the recipe according to the directions however I did melt the butter. I think that is the secret to making sure the "dough" isn't too crumbly. They turned out wonderful. Thank you so much!

Love this recipe!  It's a great one for the kids to help with.  FYI Odetta - I think your "Baba" brought it from the old country (short for babushka).  My baba made them as well.

I lost my grandmas recipe for these and was heartbroken as I make every year!  This is it!!! The only thing I do different is roll warm right out of the oven it kinda puts a sugary coating on them. Then I let cool and roll again and sometimes a 3rd time.  They look so pretty and even though every time I eat one I feel like a dog with peanut butter in the roof of my mouth they are the best!!

I made these for someone I love and they love them! Russian Tea Cakes are their favorite and boy did they say these were just the best! I cooked them 10 minutes and they came out well, and also put 2 layers of sugar on them. Thanks! This is going in my records.

Fantastic! I have always loved these cookies/cakes at Christmas as a child. This recipe brings me back to more innocent times; the flavor is PERFECT! Thank you so much for the memories! NOTE: I used PURE vanilla. I tried both pure and imitation, pure is the way to go. I also used pecans and cashews, finely chopped. Great recipe.

These were pretty good. In my opinion, the amount of work it takes to make these isn't worth the taste and the amount of cookies it makes (not very many). But they were ok. The batter was extremely dry and lumpy for me too. I took advise from a previous review a put it in the microwave. After 30-40 seconds the batter was much better.

Great recipe.  I've made this twice now.
My experience:
Unless the butter is room temperature, you'll have a very crumbly mixture that will not roll, just scoop it in your palm with a tablespoon and press to shape it into a ball it will stay and work fine.  
The first time I made it with a dusting of confectioner's sugar before baking, than again after and the second time I did not- no noticable difference.
These are delicious!

Every year at Christmas time I try to find different cookie and treat recipes to make for my friends as gifts.  I try to find easy recipes too, since I usually end up making 8 different things.  This cookie recipe was very good and very easy.  I will definitely make this one again.

This recipe is great! I had to make Russian food for school and they went over really well! I added a splash of milk to moisten the batter. I will definately make these again!

Loved this cookie. I followed the advice of other posters and added the 1/4 tsp. of salt if using unsalted butter and also rolled twice in the sugar. Turned out wonderfully great. I tried it right after making it and was "eh" about it. But the next day I LOVED it. I will defenitly make this once again.

this probably isn't very traditional, but since i didn't have nuts on hand for that slight crunch i decided to try rainbow sprinkles! it make the cakes pretty and added just the right amount of crunch i was looking for.

I enjoyed the taste of these.  Mine crumbled too easily for my liking.  I will probably try these again in case I did something wrong the first time.

My favorite kind of cookie and with this recipe they came out perfect and delicious!  I had no problem rolling them as other said.  I just let them cool for a little while and they were coated perfectly in the sugar.

This was a very easy recipe and turned out great. I followed the directions and only needed to roll the cookies in powdered sugar once. It doesn't get much easier than this one.

One of my favorite cookies and this recipe is terrific. Soft inside, but not crumbly. Make sure to cook slighly before rolling in powdered sugar. Great flavor.

I've never had Russian tea cakes before, so these were a real treat. I followed the recipe, though I did follow a member's suggestion to roll the cakes in granulated sugar before baking. They're very rich, so I suggest making them quite small, even less than the recipe's indication of one inch balls. They're very delicate and sweet, and I'm sure I'll make them again.

I liked these a lot. They tasted like a recipe my grandmother used to make. However, my husband didn't care for them. I think you either love or hate this cookie! Next time I will make 1/2 a batch so I'm not left with so many left over.

The taste was wonderfull, but they were too dry.... I will be trying them again with a few changes. Rolling them in granulated sugar before baking gave the best results, but the powdered sugar afterwards was a big mess. (cookies crumbling, sugar didn't stick properly). But the taste is absolutely addictive. I used pecans (ground not too finely) and a small dash of lemon juice (I didn't have zest).

Melt in your mouth good!  My fiance also tells me they are just like the ones his grandma made, so now we have a new tradition in our family.  I rolled these in sugar several times and they came out great.

This is one of my favorite cookies. I've never made them myself but I don't think the recipe could be better. They are melt in your mouth delicious. I overbaked the last sheet (forgot about it cause I was too busy testing the others:) but it didn't seem to matter much. Very yummy I will be making these again, maybe even before christmas!!

I made these to include in cookie gift tins that I'm making and am sorry that I didn't double the recipe so that I could have more for myself! These are wondeful; my first thought, "melt-in-your-mouth" and buttery. I'm definitely going to have to make more! Thanks!

Delicious little morsels!  For me, the dough never really binded together - was very crumbly (not sure if it was supposed to be this way or not).  I just pressed the dough into balls, and the cookies came out fine.  VERY slight 'doughy' taste, but still very yummy.

Simple and delicious.  A delicate cookie that tastes like shortbread with confectioner's sugar.  A nice addition to my Christmas cookie list.  I used a small ice cream scoop to help save time.  Thanks Odette!

In process of making these cookies.....I've known them as Mexican Wedding Cakes......Would like to know if salted butter is best to use or unsalted.  I am using unsalted and wonder since there is no salt in the ingredients if this was the right choice.  My neighbors love them......

This is the first time I had Russian tea cookies, so I didn't expect it to be shaped round.  BUT, these cookies were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  It was light, crispy, and buttery - a taste that melts in your mouth!  I didn't have walnuts, so I substituted with cashews and they came out just as good!
