Wow! This was REALLY good. It was a sophisticated dish but only took about 15 minutes to make. One word of caution: go easy on the rub! The fruit is a PERFECT match with the pork. Definately 5 *'s!

This is really good.  Make sure when you make it what you are not using "Spicy" steak seasoning I made the mistake of using the spicy and it was too much so other than that it was GREAT.  We Loved the salsa and thaught is would be good on french toast or rolled in creapes.  We paired the chops with corn on the cob and baked potatoes...Rachel

I cannot say how much we disliked the Salsa.  The pork chops were fine - we tossed the salsa and used jarred appelsauce instead.  Served it with baked sweet potatoes and corn on the cob.

We added the salsa from this recipe to these chops (http://barbeque.allrecipes.com/az/CitrsBrbcdPrkChps.asp).  Both were delicious!

I like this one.  The meat is juicy and the flavor is slightly spicy.  I served it with lentils and steamed broccoli, and the salsa was great on the lentils.  Left out the mint because we don't care for it.
