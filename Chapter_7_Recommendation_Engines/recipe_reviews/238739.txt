My boyfriend doesn't like tomatoes, yet managed to finish almost the entire pot on his own.  I felt that there was too much celery overall and I didn't care for the texture of it with the tomato pieces.

I really like this. I've had my eye on it awhile but was waiting for tequila to go on sale. It did.. yum. Now I have a whole bottle to use so I'll make this often.. has a nice bite. Will try with shrimp too.. and its great cold too, btw

I doubled it for an event and added a teaspoon (or a bit more) of smoky paprika to the soup. This recipe is amazing! Thanks for sharing. It will be a staple at our house now.

Made it exactly as shown (minus celery) and we loved it. The tequila lime jalape√±o flavor combo was really good.  Will make again.
