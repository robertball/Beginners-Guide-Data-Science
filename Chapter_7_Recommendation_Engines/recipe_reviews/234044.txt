The maple caramelized onions were so delicious! I will definitely double them next time. I used a sliced kalamata olive bread. The sandwich had a nice balance of salty sweet savoury.

Love this. I've made this many times. I'm sure it would be better with the olive bread but it works well with regular sliced multigrain bread too. Tuna is great but shredded cooked chicken is quite good too. I use ranch dressing rather than miracle whip (personal preference).

Was really good. I used yellow onions chopped up and a little more maple syrup but it was a hit all around!
