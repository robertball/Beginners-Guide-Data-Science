Wonderful recipe! I have 8 kids and even the pickiest loved this recipe!!! The only thing I'd do differently is double the sauce but only because I used 2 smaller pan...

i think these enchiladas could have been great with a different sauce. nobody in the family liked it...i think it was too cheesy/creamy, tasted like i'd melted velveeta over it. the chicken mixture was a hit though, my hubby and kids were digging it out of the tortillas and eating it anyway. i'm going to use the leftovers and start over with an enchilada sauce this time.

Really quite good!  I prefer enchiladas to be creamy and cheesy, so this was great.  And pretty easy to make.  I prepared the chicken in advance so when it was time to make dinner, it came together quickly.  Looking forward to eating leftovers tomorrow.

I made this recipe last night for company and had never made enchiladas before.  Everyone loved them and even took leftovers home.   Would make this recipe again.  Very good.

Delicious! I put the oven on broil for only a few minutes before taking it out of the oven which crisped it up nicely.

These enchiladas were moist and cheesy-I can't imagine even the pickiest eater not loving them.  It made a big pan of them-plenty for a very large family or guests.  I will make these again.

Chicken was bland, tortillas were soggy from the sauce.  My family did not like this recipe.

I've made this recipe what seems like a million times. It's always a hit, no matter where I take it! 
I have made a couple changes along the way, which in my opinion, makes this recipe ten times better. I don't use the green chile peppers, instead, I substitute those with hot sauce inside the enchiladas.
Also, I've found that if you let the sauce sit as long as the recipe suggests, the tortillas get soggy, and nobody likes soggy food!
And, as much as I love cheese, I think this recipe uses way too much of it. I probably use 1 full package of cheese in the whole recipe instead of the two full bags it recommends. 

However, with all of my little tweaks, this recipe is SUPERB.

It was good. I added rotel for a little more flavor.  I wasn't sure the size of tortillas so mine made 15. But really good.

Very easy recipe,  but was bland. I'll  make this again and add fajita seasoning to the chicken cheese mixture. Also I cut the recipe down since it's  the two of us.
I made this a second time using a packet of fajita seasoning , turned out GREAT! Husband loved it.

My sister made it with one change. She used cream of mushroom instead. But itâ€™s so good.
