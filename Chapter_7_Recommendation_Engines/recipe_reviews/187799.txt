This meatloaf is amazing. The only thing I modified was that I sautéed the onions, mushrooms, and garlic first and added tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes simply because I didn't have any on hand.

I made this with one small finely-diced green bell pepper which was plenty, and added the Cheddar in with the goat cheese.  I also didn't bother to sprinkle bread crumbs over the top of the loaf. It was too spicy for me but Husband loved it - so nice to have a meatloaf recipe that's a bit different from the norm. Thanks, AnimalsTasteGood!

I love this recipe! I do reduce the amount of veggies, especially the bell peppers, and I only use one habanero and no jalepenos (it's spicy enough as is!) but this is simply delicious. I've made it several times and everyone who tries it really loves it. It's my go-to for meatloaf. Thanks!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but alas, I was very disappointed. The amount of vegetable additions totally overwhelmed the meatloaf. It was more like a veggie loaf. Be sure to get a very fine dice on your vegetables.

This recipe looks better than it is. The meatloaf is completely bland and there are way too many vegetables in it. This recipe calls for no seasoning what so ever, and you can tell by the finished product.  I am not even sure if salt and pepper could save this.

This meatloaf recipe is a pretty good one. The meat stays moist, it is easy to put together and quite straightforward, cooking time is right on, and  it's full of nutrients. Additionally, the goat cheese and habanero filling is a nice touch. I don't understand why it is so bland. I used all the ingredients except mushroom, each in their written amounts. I enjoyed the vegetable/meat ratio seeing that we try to eat very little meat but even the taste of the fresh veggies (not being sautéed first gave them a crisp flavour but a perfect texture) but it needed some pizzazz. I think next time I'll add some Sriracha or similar in the mix to give it a bit more of a kick. Definitely worth trying, just add some fresh herbs or more punch when mixing the meat.
