While this is delicious, it is pretty sweet. The brown sugar takes the tang away from the Greek yogurt though. The thing I like about this recipe is that it is easy to adapt to your own preferences: use less brown sugar or sub dill pickle relish to take some of the sweet away, or use Dijon for a slightly different flavor. But it made a really good lunch the way it is written!
