This was restaurant quality but I'd recommend a few changes: a small carton of cream is 2 cups so instead of buying a larger carton for just 1/4 cup more (a bit pricey and I'd rather not have leftover cream to cook w/ b/c of its high fat content) do not add all of the pasta; a whole bouillon is quite acceptable - who's really using 1/4 of it?! I didn't have prosciutto but it really needs that flavor. I added peas and it completed the meal. Think ahead and reuse the same pots to make fewer dishes!

This is an awesome recipe! I'm one of those cooks who just can't leave a recipe alone, so I changed it up a bit. I saute`ed the chicken in olive oil, and added 2 minced fresh garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon dried sweet basil, and 1 teaspoon sea salt. 
For the sauce, I used 3 1/2 cups heavy cream, and added dried sweet basil, 1/2 chicken bouillon cube, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon real butter, and 1/2 cup chicken broth. I used a full cup Asiago cheese, and substitued bacon for the proscuitto. I also cooked the bacon, mushrooms, and fresh garlic in olive oil, rather than butter. 
My whole family loved this recipe! If you were to add capers and a sqeeze of fresh lemon juice, it would taste just like a favorite dish at a well known Italian Restaurant....which is what I plan to do next time!

Since my changes were only in the adjustment of quanity I still gave this recipe 5 stars. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking it. I also added more cheese and used an entire bullion cube to the sauce to add more flavor to it. I added more garlic when cooking the prosciutto. Also I felt that there was too much pasta for the amount of chicken/mushrooms & prosciutto that the recipe called for. I used 2 lbs of chicken 1 cup of mushroom (next time I will make it 2 cups) and 1/2 cup of prosciutto. I was very excited when I saw this recipe and it reminded me of my favorite dish at the Macaroni Grill that they no longer carry. I recieved several compliments at dinner. Thank you for a great recipe!

Delicious! I used penne pasta and cut the amount in half. I didn't use chicken I just doubled the amount of proscuitto. I also used 2 cups of mushrooms and added peas. This was so easy and quick to make but looks and tastes like you spent hours. UPDATE: This is the second time I've made this and this time I did it with the chicken. Definitely season the chicken with garlic italian seasoning and a little salt and pepper while frying in a bit of olive oil. I still used 2 cups of mushrooms and 1 c. of peas along with a whole package of proscuitto so I doubled the sauce. I don't like a thin sauce so it was pretty easy to thicken with the cornstarch. Definitely a keeper.

Wow! This was very good! The original recipe needed a little kick so I added 1/2 tbsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. I used baby portabella mushrooms and added fresh spinach for color. I used the Asiago cheese and it definitely made the dish!

I tweeked the recipe a little. I added 1/2 C minced onion 3 cloves garlic 1 C asiago cheese 1 whole bouilon cube and seasoned the chicked with poultry seasoning prior to cooking. I also substituted 1/4 C milk for the cream so I didn't have to buy 2 pints of cream. Next time I will add some vegetables to it. The recipe was a great base to start from.

This was great. I left out the mushrooms and doubled the cheese and proscuitto. Was just as good re-heated 2 days later. Thanks for the great recipe.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars I really liked it but my gf didn't care for it as much as I did. She doesn't like really creamy/cheesy dishes. But I thought it was great! My local store didn't have any prosciutto so I had to use Turkey bacon but it was still enjoyed! Thx!

This was ridiculously good. The recipe as it is written is probably okay but I tweaked it up a bit. I marinated chicken breasts in olive oil oregano sage rosemary basil salt & pepper and then cooked the chicken on the grill. I used a whole package of prosciutto which was 3 oz. In the sauce I used 2 cups of heavy cream a whole chicken bouillion cube and 1.5 cups of grated Asiago. The extra cheese made the sauce very thick even without the cornstarch so I poured in an additional 1/2 cup of half and half to thin it some. I made the sauce in a skillet and when it was done I poured it into the large pot of drained pasta. I quickly rinsed the skillet and used it to do the olive oil garlic mushrooms and then I thinly sliced the grilled chicken breasts and added it to the skillet sautee. That only took a few minutes and I poured the whole mixture from the skillet into the large pot of pasta and sauce and used a large spoon to toss it all together. I topped it with grated parmesan and parsley when I served it and it was even better than restaurant quality. Absolutely delicious.

This was soooo yummy! I used a mix of three cheeses asiago parmesan and mozzerella and the whole chicken bullion cube instead of half. I through in some frozen veggies to cook with the pasta as well. Next time i will try half and half to cut the fat.

This was awful - recipe could be improved by halving the amount of pasta called for and quadrupling the mushrooms and ham. And can 1/4 a boullion cube possibly be right? I used a whole one and still the sauce was bland and uninteresting.

I made this tonight and it was really good. I did season the chicken quite a bit with garlic salt and seasoned salt before cooking it and glad I did because the sauce was still a bit bland. I added sun-dried tomatoes for extra flavor. My family really enjoyed it and I will definitely make this again next time upping the amount of crushed garlic and adding maybe a little crushed pepper. Thanks!

This was an AWESOME recipe! I just used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and did include a whole boullion cube. I also used baby portabello mushrooms precooked bacon (in place of the proscuitto) and precooked chicken. This made the recipe very quick and easy to prepare and it definitely compared to a restaurant meal. Next time I'll bake the chicken and cut it up ahead of time (only because I think the precooked was salty tasting). This one is a keeper - will be perfect for serving guests! UPDATE: I made this recipe again tonight. This time I used bone-in chicken breasts that I had seasoned and baked in the oven ahead of time and also used the prosciutto as in the original recipe. While the chicken was an improvement over "premade" from the store the prosciutto has a salami-like taste that I feel does not really compliment this dish. At least it doesn't compliment it as well as bacon does. I also added some chopped spinach leaves to cook with the mushrooms and it was a pleasant addition.

My family loves this recipe. We make it often in fact my husband begs for it and he is not a big pasta eater. I do make a few changes. I use about 1 and 1/2 - 2 lbs chicken & season with salt and pepper before cooking. Instead of porsciutto I use about 2 cups of fresh steamed broccoli and just mix it in last. Also shred some extra Asiago to serve on top... YUM! It makes a lot but it's one of those dishes that is even better left over.

Very tasty. A lot of dishes though had to wash and reuse. But other than that very good. Also the recipe called for more pasta that I would use I used about a 1/3 of the box.

Yum!!! This is my favorite type of recipe- delicious as written but still leaves plenty of room to play around with the ingredients. My changes after reading other reviews; 2 cups half-and-half instead of cream (we didn't miss the cream at all!) extra garlic and prosciutto and increased the asiago to 1 cup. Easy enough for a weeknight meal good enough for company. Thanks Tricia!:)

i used more prosciutto mushrooms and asiago cheese than called for (not too much more but more). I also did not add the additional 1/4 cup of heavy cream felt as though it would've been too liquidy. We also added a can of baby peas and it was delicious! Other than that awesome awesome recipe. My boyfriend and I loved it!!!

This recipe was good although I made quite a few additions. I added a table spoon of minced garlic and half a cup of Romano cheese to the sauce. I also increased the amount of mushrooms I used 3 cups of sliced Portobello Mushrooms. It was very delicious!

Mmmm so good! Definitely restaurant quality! The Asiago cheese really makes this dish pop! I am one of those people who likes to adjust the flavors... so I added some sun dried tomato pesto to mushrooms and flavored the chicken with salt pepper Cayenne pepper basil oregano and garlic powder. Then I added the chicken directly to the sauteed mushrooms to get the most out of all the flavors. Loved this dish and I will definitely be making it again!!

I didn't have proscuitto and don't like mushrooms changed this dish a tad and it was delicious! Used 3/4 of 12oz box of bow ties sauteed chicken (in 2 T butter) sprinkled with kosher salt ground mustard onion powder black pepper crushed red pepper garlic and onions. Accidentally used 1 T cornstarch with 1 T water and it thicked the dish immensely- added 1/4 c cream as directed and it was perfect. Did not find it bland with spices added to chicken. Added pasta and sauce back into the pan with chicken juices and spices. Also used 1 1/2 C light cream instead of heavy cream for sauce. Fed the 2 of us with plenty leftover.

Ok this had no flavor what so ever. I added a bit of yellow pepper sun dried tomatoes and a TON of garlic and still bland. The sauce just did not have any taste. I used the oil from the sun dried tomatoes to brown my chicken as well as added salt and pepper but the chicken needed way more seasoning. Bummer another recipe canned.

I made this last night for a group of girlfriends and the girls kept looking up from their plates in awe and complimenting me for this "restaurant quality" dish! I made very few alterations: seasoned the chicken first with salt and pepper and cooked in olive oil omitted the mushrooms because of allergies only used 2 cups of cream the full bouillon cube and about two-thirds the amount of pasta after reading other reviews. The sauce was so flavourful and cheesy and the prosciutto was the perfect finishing touch!

I will make this again. It was tasty and the family enjoyed it for our New Year's Eve dinner! I used half cream and half Vit. D milk to cut down the fat and the sauce was still thick. I also used whole wheat bow tie pasta and it was great. I will use olive oil instead of butter next time and add peas.

Wow it has been awhile since I could rate a recipe 5 stars! This dish tasted like it came from a good restaurant. I made the recipe as stated except I used peas instead of mushrooms and half and half instead of heavy cream. I don't think it could have been any better with the (high in fat) cream. I took a short cut with Perdue ready made roasted chicken. This is definately a recipe you could experiment with i.e. sausage shrimp ham bacon and I think just about any veggie would be good thrown in here. Good enough for company!

I basically made half this recipe but I cut the cream (I used half and half) to one cup and I cut the Asiago back to 1/4 cup. I increased the mushrooms and used 4 oz. Well this was good but it was just too rich for us. I think the fat rendered from the prosciutto should have been drained as I m sure this contributed to the richness of this dish. I liked the idea of this but if I were to make it again I d really have to make some adjustments to make it to our liking.

I changed this a bit (made it more fattening!!) by first breading the chicken in Italian seasoning and break crumbs then cooked it in some veggie oil... then I just followed the recipe exactly... oh no wait I added some sun dried tomato and bacon.... and it was DELISH!!

Yum this was fantastic. I loved the combination of different flavors. I stayed pretty true to the recipe. I seasoned my chicken with pepper and garlic salt (should probably use powder next time to cut some of the saltiness from the prosciutto). I substituted 1 C. cream with milk since I didn't have enough cream on hand and it still tasted great. My grocer was out of bow tie so I used penne. Instead of mixing the pasta in I simple poured the chicken mixture over the noodles otherwise the entire 16 oz box would definitely be too much. My only complaint was that it used too many dishes! This will be going into the dinner rotation for sure!

incredible! I added some stuff. Lots more 1/2 1/2 and asiago. I want more sauce.. If I end up with extra than it's luxurious soup! My guests thought that they were in at a very fancy Italian Restaurant. also sweet red pepper for color and twice the prosciutto..... how much can I type? 100 stars

I took the recommendations of others and then added some of my own. This dish was a real hit in my home and can easily be adapted to a vegetarian version. Reheats beautifully. My dish was very colorful. I used 2/3rds of the pasta 1 cup Asiago skipped the prosciutto added way more garlic 1 tub of sliced portobello mushrooms added frozen peas added steamed broccoli (awesome with the cheese!) added toasted pine nuts added sun-dried tomatoes chopped green onions and grated parmesan cheese on top What I might try next time: -halved seasonal cherry tomatoes -a pinch of chili pepper flakes in sauce when simmering

This rivals the Italian restaurants any day! Aside from dirtying more than 1 pan (this took 3) I had no complaints about this one. Awesome flavor very rich very filling. I took 1 bite and my first impression was WOW!!! Hubby asked me to make this one weekly. Very very easy to make this and really quick too. I cut up 2 large frozen boneless chicken breasts and used a little shy of 1/2 tsp. of granulated chicken bouillon instead of trying to quarter a cube. I only made 8-9 oz of pasta (eyeballed 1/2 bag) I think the whole bag would've been way way too much. I only used 2 cups of cream because I didn't want to open another deal of cream just for 1/4 cup worth. I highly recommend this keeper!

Second time I've made this this time I did it with "what I had". Did 3 cloves garlic 16 oz bag of pennette pasta half 1/2 & 1/2 and half cream chicken broth instead of boullion. Cooked the chicken in olive oil seasoned it with salt pepper and red pepper flakes. Ended up using Trader Joes shredded "Quattro Formaggio" (Asiago Fontina provolone blend)instead of straight Asiago. Fresh parsley chopped from the garden. I think it came out a little lighter and awesome. Didn't use all the cream sauce. Kids love it wife will eat it cold! Wish it wasn't so fattening!! Fed 2 adults and 3 kids with enough for 3 adult lunches the next day...

I love this recipe I was only looking for an asiago creme sauce and this is restaurant quality! I purchased a whole rotisserie chicken and shredded that and put into the dish I also added sliced cherry tomatoes to the finished product and omitted the prosciutto. I am making this recipe again and adding King crab instead of chicken!

Very nice pasta dish. I love asiago cheese. I used pre-cooked chicken so that saved some time. May try this with shrimp or italian sausage next time.

I expected more but this lacked flavor way too much pasta and it contains a lot of unnecessary cooking steps. Switching back and forth from the chicken mixture to the cream sauce is a complete waste of time. I prefer multi-tasking but finish everything and then make the cream sauce last and pour directly over pasta. You will save yourself time and money! Looking at the sauce ingredients and the cooking process it was clear to me that steps were added in order to correct a bad sauce. The addition of cornstarch & water is completely unnecessary. A sauce made from heavy cream with cheese melted into it does not require thickening. It may look thin when it's cooking but anyone experienced with cream sauces knows that it will thicken as it cools. Just as I suspected by adding cornstarch and then setting it aside it quickly turned into a paste. Hence the reason why it needs to be placed back over heat and thinned with additional cream before serving. That could explain why the recipe starts off with simply one carton of cream and then ends up needing a second one for just a 1/4c. Again unnecessary if you omit the cornstarch. As for the cube boullion I also found it unnecessary. A taste test revealed no difference. The Asiago is too powerful. I upped it to cube and still nothing other than a slight salty flavor but not enough to make the boullion cube worth the time and trouble. A dose of much needed salt and pepper would work just the same.

For all these yummy ingredients this dish has remarkably little flavor. It also dirties quite a few dishes and takes longer to prepare than I would like. Still I give it four stars because it really is a good base and by adding a little more of a few ingredients and spicing it up a little I think it could be quite good. First lots more cheese. Second more prosciutto or maybe bacon instead of prosciutto. Third add onions. I cooked them with the chicken and garlic as another reviewer suggested. Fourth saute some fresh spinach with the chicken mixture at the end until the spinach wilts. This adds some color to the dish and also a healthy vegetable. Fifth add some spices. Adding red pepper flakes salt and pepper to the cream sauce turns out nicely. These additions give the base recipe a nice punch.

I loved this recipe! It is so easy and is one of my favorite pasta dishes. I substitute a small can of baby peas for the mushrooms and it is great. I would suggest stirring a tiny bit of water into the noodles before adding the sauce and chicken. This will help it stay creamy and not sticky. Enjoy!

This was great! I made it for my birthday dinner tonight and it was better than going out to a restaurant. I followed a few recommendations of other reviewers. I used 1 tsp. of chicken base instead of 1/4 of a boullion cube upped the proscuitto to 1/2 cup and used about 1 1/2 c. of baby bella mushrooms. As for the chicken I had some that I had already pulled left over from a cut up fryer I had boiled so I just used that. This was wonderful and we will definatly make it again. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was absolutely delicious! I made a few changes as suggested by previous reviews: I substituted bacon for the prosciutto (which can be very expensive) which did not take away from the flavor quality at all. I also used 2 cups of half and half instead of heavy cream and for the final 1/4 cup of cream I substituted skim milk. The sauce was not too heavy but was just right. I also substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and will also use it for the butter next time as well. Finally I used 2/3 of the amount of pasta called for in the original recipe which was just right. This dish was fantastic! I will make it again. It's good enough for company!

This was very good. With some changes it is a 5. For 16 oz of pasta you need more chicken and more Asiago cheese. I love the flavor of this cheese so I used a little more than 1 cup. Added more fresh mushrooms - I love mushrooms so I used 1 1/2 cups. Instead of prosciutto I used bacon. Either cut down on the pasta or increase the amount of chicken mushroom and cheese. It was very good.

A 10 if I could.....a winner recipe...made last night for Valenitne's dinner and my family LOVED this one! I used penne pasta which was perfect cause the sauce kinda flows through. I used a bit more Asiago then called for and the rest was of the recipe I followed to the "T". Very creamy cheesey and delicious will most definately make again....even my 10 and 2 yr olds loved it! Thanks

Did not like the sauce really - Mine turned out kind of grainy and the minute it started cooling off it was no good at all - I had to re-heat my dish 3 times while eating. I added broccoli and spinach instead of mushrooms cuz thats what I had at home - I also used whole wheat pasta. Im not sure but maybe my sauce wasnt that great because I used half n half instead of cream and only 2 cups (as I agree w/ another I think it would have been too runny if I had added the extra 1/4 cup). I give it three stars because the chicken and veggies came out yummy - Ive got some leftovers that I didnt put any sauce on and Im gonna try it for lunch with just some olive oil and garlic

This is a fantastic recipe that just needs a few "tweaks" to make it really spectacular. Here are a few small changes that I recommend trying: 1)Increase amount of Asiago to sauce(I grated a packed full cup) 2)Add more proscuitto chicken and mushrooms...especially if you are making full box of farfalle pasta. 3)Peas! It gives just a little flavor and a lot of color to the dish. Enjoy try it and see if you can make this a dish that becomes a family favorite!! I think you'll be impressed

This is super yummy and easy to make. I chopped some fresh garlic when I was cooking the chicken along with some salt and pepper. And I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I improvised and used a bit more mushrooms and proscuito. I may add a bit more garlic next time....just a personal preference I love garlic

This recipie is super yummy! My husband gave it a 5 which is rare. I did make some changes to it though. Other than minor adjustments to the measurements because I hate measuring things so I guess-timate I used penne pasta and added red peppers. I used the whole bullion cube like others recommended. Also I used Kraft's Parmesan Ramano and Asiago grated cheese and it added really good flavor. I'll definitely will be making this again.

Very good. I did the whole 3oz package of prociutto and added peas and extra mushrooms. I think next time I will also add broccoli or even maybe some asparagus. Another thing I did was add some spices cooking my chicken for extra flavor there. I have plenty left over but maybe I should of halved the recipe since it was just for me for dinner and leftovers for lunch. Cant wait to make this again when I have a few people over for dinner.

not a fan of the sauce way too rich and creamy I would prefer milk over heavy cream and i ended up adding sherry to the sauce to get out the heavy cream taste. I felt it lacked flavor as well. Also it did not call for alot of glarlic mushrooms and prociutto. I ended up adding more.

I was looking for something to make with asiago cheese that my brother gave me. Decided to try this. To start off with I did not know that asiago cheese is an aquired taste (maybe that's why he gave it to me!). I thought it was more like parmesan since it was a hard cheese and it was not to my liking. That being said I had to tweak this to mild down the cheese taste. Used 1/2&1/2 instead of heavy cream bacon instead of prosciutto since the store didn't have prosciutto canned mushrooms and chives instead of parsley. To mild the taste I added 1/2 block of cream cheese additional 1 cup 1/2&1/2 and 1/2 cup of parmesan. Made a HUGE difference. Next time I have to reject the acception of asiago from my brother and use parmesan instead (which is a great cream sauce base). And I agree with another cook you use a lot of dishes to make this.

I have made this recipe several times and it's always a hit. It tastes just like the Bowtie Festival at Johnny Carino's. I do make a few adjustments to the sauce like adding lots of garlic powder crushed red pepper cayenne pepper and cajun seasoning. I'm a cajun girl at heart so the spicier the better!!

I tasted this recipe or one just like it at a four star hotel in Florida and I found it when I returned on ALLripes and decided to try it. It is such a good recipe that I made it for a sick friend and she loved it. I will definately keep it in my "favorites" file.

The family was only so-so on this dish. It was surprisingly bland considering the ingredient list. I didn't care for the prosciutto which I also found surprising. Perhaps I didn't prepare everything correctly but it was just okay for us. Sorry:(

I'm rating this with my changes which were not huge but I'm sure altered the taste of the original dish. I didn't have Asagio cheese and needed a quick week night dinner so I used fresh Ramano in place and had no proscutto and used regular bacon. Added more than 1/4 cup of mushrooms and more garlic and used regular spaghetti noodles. The sauce was really good and easy to make. It's very rich and filling. I even added some chopped spinach to my plate as I love spinach in pasta. You could really go crazy with additions to this dish.

This was awesome I don't know how anyone wouldn't love this! I didn't have asiago so I used fresh parmesan which I doubled and didn't have prosciutto so I used 4 slices of bacon chopped up I also added a little more mushroom and chicken boullion than called for. I am making it again tonight (per the request of my boyfriend) but this time with the asiago.

I didn't follow this exactly. First thing my husband hates Asiago Cheese so I used 1 cup of Cheddar Cheese instead. I added more prosciutto and mushroom than called for and added some peas as suggested by others. I also served this with some garlic bread. Everyone loved it!!! I am definitely making this again. It was wonderful.

This was superb! I used whipping cream in the liquid form as opposed to heavy cream (could use 1/2 and 1/2 though) increased the Asiago cheese to 1 - 1 1/2 cups 1/2 cup prosciutto 2 tablespoons garlic 1 cup sliced mushrooms and about 2 tablespoons of parsley. Absolutely delicious!!

Four stars as written five stars with my changes! Per reviews I used just over half the pasta and it was fine. I increased the mushrooms to 1/2 cup added 1/2 cup of chopped onion 1/2 cup of chopped red bell pepper and sauteed the chicken cubes in a bit of cayenne for kick. I increased the liquid to 2-1/2 cups to make up for the 'extras' I was adding and subbed 2% evaporated milk for the heavy cream. Also increased the Asiago to 1-3/4 cups to make up for increased liquid and add more flavor. Verdict? Hubby snarfed his portion went back for seconds stabbed my little bowties when I couldn't finish mine and then scraped the remaining sauce out of the pan with a spoon while he was doing dishes all the while muttering "Hope this isn't bad for me..." When I told him there was no cream in that sauce and the most 'fat' in the recipe was the Asiago he was amazed. He made me write my changes down and calls it a keeper!

Just had this for dinner tonight and thought it had good flavor. I reduced the amount of pasta a bit. Used fat free half & half instead of the cream. The sauce was thin I think because of that. I think it could use more mushrooms and prosciutto then it calls for. Also I like the idea of peas that others have added. I will make this again but tweek it a little for my taste.

This recipe was in desperate need of salt and pepper. Plus it used a ton of dishware to make this meal. It's definitely not easy clean up. The chicken was good and so were the veggies but the cream sauce was very bland. The pasta would have been much better if it was just tossed with some olive oil. Will not make again.

I baked the proscuitto in the oven for 5-10 minutes as I like mine crisp and it was a little limp after cooking it with the veggies. I might add the veggies to the oven on the same tray after the prosciutto is done to save time and cleaning a pot. I line my trays with parchment or foil....just wipe in the sink and done.

I thought this was a wonderful dish but I did make some changes to fit my taste. I used Penne Pasta instead of the bow tie extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable 1 1/2 lbs. of boneless chicken tenders cooked in a castiron skillet in olive oil and butter sprinkled with salt pepper and Webber N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning. After cooking I cut-up the chicken. Instead of prosciutto I used about 10 slices of lean bacon and crumbled after cooking. I also used about 6 oz. of Asiago cheese along with about 4 oz. of 4 shredded Italian cheeses. I used about 1 1/2 cups of diced baby portabello mushrooms and about 5 diced garlic cloves and 1/2 diced onion. The other change I made was to the pasta after draining. I tossed with olive oil and Italian seasonings. When I was making the cream mixture I used a half-pint of heavy whipping cream and 1 1/4 cups of half and half. I also seasoned the sauce with Webber's N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning (You can find in Wal-Mart) Pepper Flakes Salt and Pepper along with the Parsley. This was spicy and great. My husband loved it. I will be making this again.

This was very good. I'd give it 4.5 stars (I rate 5 stars for exceptional dishes only). I took another reviewer's suggestion and used half & half and it was plenty rich. I would definitely cut the amount of pasta in half. I had absolutely no problem using a whole buillion cube and I doubled the Asiago cheese.

I served this recently for an outdoor Tuscan inspired feast for 15 people. I used 2# of pasta eliminated the chicken used light cream instead of heavy no cornstarch doubled the cheese bacon AND proscuitto baby bella mushrooms and added peas to the pasta during the last 3 min of cooking the pasta. This recipe got raves and requests! It was a crowd pleaser! (This was my course one..with more food to follow)

Wonderful! I made a double batch for a big family gathering so I used one container heavy cream and one of half and half just to lighten it up a little. I sprinkled dried tomato flakes in it as well to give it a little more color.

I did use broccoli and my secrete ingredients red pepper and roasted garlic. I also think that it could use alittle more cheese when made my way.

This was delicious! My family tore it up. I used one of those rotisserie chickens I got from the grocery store for the meat. I left all of the roasted skin in as well for a bit of extra flavor. I only used two cups of cream to keep from buying another carton that would have mostly gone to waste. I used milk at the end instead. I added 1/2 Tbsp of powdered chicken bullion and a good sprinkle of black pepper. I doubled the prosciutto mushrooms garlic and butter. Penne was my pasta of choice and we had asparagus as a side dish. My seven year old declared "It was the best dinner ever!"

I am one of those people that makes changes to every recipe. But the foundation was the same and it is awesome!

I cooked the pasta (fettuccine) in 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water - just for added flavor. 

For the chicken and mushrooms, I used rotisserie chicken from Publix and shredded it. I also added a can of chopped artichokes and chopped a small yellow pepper.  So - I added an extra tablespoon of butter and Tuscan spices. 

For The the cream sauce, I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 chicken broth. It was a little thin so I added a little bit more corn starch. 

When I make it again, and I will, I will add some garlic to the cream sauce.  Other than that, IT WAS PERFECT!

I assisted my sister in making this dish last night and it tasted wonderful. Along with Asagiao she also put in a Parmesan & Romano mix. She used heavy cream as called for but next time I will probably replace with 1/2 % 1/2 for a lighter sauce. We didn't have any fresh mushrooms on hand so we sliced up some baby spinach and sauteed the prosciutto with some spinach and some garlic. Cooked the chicken with Tony Chachere's seasoning but would love to try and grill the chicken next time. Will also probably add some fresh basil next time to enhance the flavor. All in all a wonderful recipe.

This recipe is awesome! It took me forever to make it since my baby started crying every 20 minutes but even with the delay it was wonderful. Going to try it w/half&half or light cream next time to try and make it a healthier meal. Definitely double the prosciutto cheese and mushrooms!

This recipe was delicious I created an account on this website just so I could comment. The only things I did different was I added a handful more mushrooms a can of peas double the garlic half a red onion chopped and I used a complete cup of Asiago and about half a cup of mozzarella. I also marinated the chicken for a few hours in olive oil oregano a splash of Italian dressing minced garlic garlic powder salt & pepper lemon juice oregano and basil. Great foundation recipe to tweak! This was great served with Cheesy Garlic bread.

This was good but next time I'll add the entire 3oz of ham probably double or triple the mushrooms and add a little more cheese grated on top while serving we love asiago cheese! Don't think it needed the extra 1/4 of whipping cream at the end....but I probably won't change that.

Macaroni Grill used to have a dish on their menu very close to this one...I used a tiny bit of pancetta then sauteed red onions then I made the sauce as directed. I skipped the mushrooms and added sliced grilled chicken. I added cooked bowtie pasta and then garnished with chopped green onions. I swear this was the same recipe as Macaroni Grill. If the sauce gets too thick just add a touch of water or chicken broth. A

This was a good recipe. I had left over chicken from the ranch kabobs I made the previous night so I used that and instead of prosciutto I used pepperoni. I also had left over mushroom and squash that was just grilled with salt that I added. Very good and made a nice meal without feeling like I was eating left overs.

pretty darn good dish. i used a lot more prosciutto ham than called for (but that's my preference) and i used half and half instead of heavy cream. my husband liked it so much that he had only two bites left before i could even ask how he liked it. UPDATE: i did this again last night and changed things up a bit. i didn't use the whole box of pasta because then it's too dry and not flavorful enough. i served the chicken on the side and added a little more cream and cheese then suggested. soooo much better.

This was delicious! I'd give it 4 1/2 stars really because I added a bit to it. After reading other reviews I reduced the amount of pasta to 12 oz. I added only 2 chk breasts 2 cups of mushrooms (since I like mushrooms) and 1 cup of steamed broccoli (but it could have used 2 cups). I also used a 4 cheese mixture with asiago in it because my grocery store didn't have asiago. I left the sauce and proscuitto amounts the same and it was perfect and VERY tasty. My husband thought I could have used 16 oz pasta with the amount of chicken used or suggested using less chicken. 12 oz pasta made plenty for 6 servings. I think if I used 16 oz pasta I would increase the sauce slightly. Overall it was awesome! Will definitely make again.

Excellent dish! One of the best pasta dishes I've prepared! I didn't have bowtie pasta so I used rotini instead. Asiago cheese is simply awesome in a pasta dish. I added a bit extra of Asiago cheese and garlic than required and it turned out fantastic. The presence of prosciutto and mushrooms is a great idea. I'm tempted to add sun-dried tomatoes and / or julienned red peppers the next time I'll prepare this wonderful dish.

This was absolutely the best pasta dish I've ever had and I made it myself.:-) I might almost say that it was better than any I've had in restaurants. I made some changes. I made it with shrimp. It was easier that way because I just threw the shrimp with the pasta to cook. I forgot to buy the proscuitto so I didn't use it. I added the garlic to the milk. And also added red pepper flakes black pepper and salt. I also used Goya Adobo it's a predominantly hispanic season and it added alot of flavor. The asiago is kinda stinky but goooood. Will definately put this one in cooking itinary.

I used this recipe for a catered dinner of 30 people along with another entree and this was scarped up and wanted more. I read the reviews and and added onion to the chicken and used bacon instead of the prosciutto. AWESOME recipe. My daughter loved it and wants it often and I have to remind her it's made with cream not skim milk.

This was good the cheese was just kinda strong...I used a 3 cheese blend that included asiago ramono and parm. It was very sour smelling but tasted great. Next time I will use just the asiago. My fiance is my taste tester and he loved it...it was ok to me. I will def make again.

I made this today without the mushrooms. I also used bacon. I thought this had wonderful flavor but I thought that it could use more sauce. It also made a huge amount. I agree with other people when when they say that it makes for a lot of dishes to wash. Thanks for the recipe.

awsome! THANK YOU! it is better if you can cook the personalized-seasoned chicken ahead of time cut it up and throw it in. i used sundried tomatoes in place of the prosciutto as i don't eat pork and i just use that whole package of mushrooms. Huge fan of this recipe thank you for sharing!!!

yummm yum yum yum yum! this pasta was absolutely wonderful! i will definitely be making it again! My boyfriend said it was very very yummy in his tummy! we made it for a fancy meal for new years eve and we LOVED it! The one thing that i didnt get was how if you left it on the stove too long then it becomes more oily than creamy. The only thing we changed in the recipe was used olive oil for the vegetable oil and we used alot more cheese than the recipe called for. It made it so good!

Great recipe and I agree you can go wild with your personal additions. I grilled four boneless chicken breasts when we were grilling steak for dinner one night. The next night I made this dish and just sliced the chicken breasts into thin slices. I increased the cheese to 1 cup increased the prosciutto to 1/2 cup and added 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms (sliced). In addition I added about 1/8-1/4 cup marsala wine frozen shrimp and about 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper. It was really yummy. Made alot but the leftovers heated up great!

I had to make a few changes one because my grocery did not have asiago cheese. Switched that to 4 oz marscapone cheese. Used fat free half and half. To the mushrooms (which I used a whole 8 oz container of sliced) I added 10 oz of fresh baby spinach and about 1 cup of chopped sundried tomatoes. Used 2 boxes of bowties as 1 would never feed my family and 2 pounds of chicken breast. Should have increased the sauce as well but we had enough for tonight. I lightly seasoned the chicken before I sauteed it with garlic powder salt pepper and a mixed chicken blend that has marjoram basil and other spices. Definitely needed to season everything otherwise it would have been very bland. I did not add everything into one pan once it was done cooking; instead I kept the pasta chicken/mushroom/tomato/spinach and cheese sauce in separate pans and just mixed everything on each plate. I added a dash of parmesan cheese when served.

This recipe is AMAZING!! Soo Good! I also made a few changes. I couldn't find any asiago cheese so I used gruyere which still turned out wonderful. I think you should also salt and definately pepper the sauce before serving. I also added about a cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes...very similar to Macaroni Grill. Delicious!! I will definately add this to my recipe box!

A very delicious dish. I also followed most others suggestions and increased the chicken as well as the mushrooms and added peas. I also heavily seasoned the chicken before cooking it with salt pepper Nature's seasoning and Italian Seasoning. Next time I probably would not use the whole box of pasta because it ends up being a whole bunch of food. A great dish though...will definitely be making this for a special someone:)

This was absoultely delicious. I did sautee 1/2 an onion and 4 cloves a garlic before I added the chicken to the pan. Also added a few red pepper flakes. Salt and peppered the cream sauce also before adding it to the chicken and bacon. Very tasty full of flavor. I did think it wasn't a very pretty dish..needed color next time I think I might add a few handfuls of fresh spinach at the very end.

This recipe was very good but was very time consuming. Instead of adding chicken to the recipe I used baked chicken breasts (dipped in egg and coated with Italian bread crumbs). I also added roasted red peppers to the sauce to add a kick.

Very tasty. Used half and half. Increased chicken to 1.5 pounds mushrooms to 2 containers of presliced from the prodoce dept and more prosciutto and it made a TON OF FOOD! I needed a little more sauce for the dish since I increased some of the ingredients so I added a bit of parmesan since I ran out of asiago. Turned out wonderful... a real hit at this house!

I added chopped sauteed spinach peas and red bell pepper So easy and delish! I also used ham instead of the proscuitto. I left off the parsley flakes as I had added color with the spinach and red bell pepper.

My entire family loved this recipe! Even my picky 5 year old ate 2 bowls! I did omit the mushrooms and added sun-dried tomatoes and chopped red onion. It is a definite keeper!

Love LOVE this recipe. I make it everytime we have new company over and my husband begs for it all the time! I made a few changes to suit my preferences: sub 1 c steamed broccoli for the prosciutto and heavily season chicken with salt & pepper. Serve with some Asiago cheese on top... YUM!
