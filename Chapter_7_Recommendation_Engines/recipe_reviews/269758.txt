I couldn’t find dill paste in the store, so I blended fresh dill with a little olive oil.  It was a nice recipe change for our family.  My teens liked it, but recommended more cheese.

This is a top notch EASY recipe - definitely making again!   We followed the recipe mostly, but: didn't add the dill ... and used chicken thighs (as that is what we had in the freezer).   SO happy there is leftovers!

As a self-described eggplant hater I was really surprised at how wonderful (and Mediterranean) this dish is. And everyone in the family agreed. A couple of notes:

I would definitely say, this Mediterranean Chicken Medley w/ Eggplant and Feta is marvelous. I believe that if comedian, Billy Crystal taste this dish. Billy would say,  girl, You put your love in this dish. Thanks, for the recipe.

Great Recipe. Did not use the dill paste, but rather used dill itself in the vege mix with the chopped tomatoes.  Seasoned the chicken with some of my commonly used spices before browning it. Used coconut oil in substitute of olive oil as that is what I had at the time. Loved the recipe. The dill add a really great flavour.

Very healthy and simple prep. I used tilapia fillets, instead of chicken and really liked it. I would double the sauce next time I make it and add a bit more salt.  Served with rice for a heartier meal.

This was really really good. Instead of dill paste I used fresh herbs of various varieties, whatever I had in hand, mixed with oil. Otherwise I followed the recipe and served it with a side of whole grain pasta. I’ll be making again!

This multi-stage cooking made the eggplant overcooked.
we will cook ALL veggies together, except tomatos

and the chicken should be cubed to eat more easily. we will put cubes in a bag with flour mix, then shake.
We will add more tomato as well

Since I cook for 2, I halved the chicken, eggplant, onion, and pepper.  The store didn’t have dill paste so I used dill dip , which I had.  It was very yummy and we had a little bit left over for lunch for one today. The hubs said I can make this one again!,
