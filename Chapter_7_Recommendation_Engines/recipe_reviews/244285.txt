Great healthy snack!  I used the recipe as a good foundation to substitute my favorite add-ins.  Very versatile.  I used dates and almonds.  Made this around the holidays so I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to add another dimension of flavors.  This recipe keeps me satisfied and less likely to indulge in unhealthy snacking.

Delicious and versatile. I've made them serveral times. Bake it in muffin cups for one less step and to make them easy to grab and go. I have a sulfite allergy and must leave out the dried fruit, but add a few extra berries. I've also switched up which type nuts and berries as to what I have on had. It's a healthy sweet treat.

This is a great health food that actually is healthy 
No added sugar outside of honey
Flax and sunflowers on top added some nice texture

Only change I made was added some salt to batter and salted the top a bit.

The only change I made was to make them in a mini-muffin pan, got 12 ready to grab munchies instead of bars. They don't stick to the paper liners either. Don't rise up at all but very pretty and healthy too!

Lots of good stuff in here!  Not your grab-n-go breakfast bar, but very moist from the bananas and loaded with flavor.  The fresh blueberries held their shape pretty well in the bars, so they'll pop in your mouth. I used sunflower kernels instead of seeds (it's what I had on hand), but otherwise followed the recipe. In the future, I might try cutting back on the mashed banana a bit, maybe 1/4 cup, to see if that'll firm them up a bit because I'd prefer a bar that I don't have to eat with a fork (although some might say it's worth the effort!).  I cut into 12 bars rather than 9, and I would make these again.  Thanks for a new breakfast treat.

These are very good. I substituted almond butter for the peanut butter, and added cinnamon and salt. I  also used 1 whole egg instead of 2 whites. The bars hold together well, and I  will make this again with different nuts and fruits.

Delicious!  I'd leave it in the oven for 5 - 10 more minutes.  I want to try them again with apples and cinnamon instead of blueberries, and raspberries and almond butter instead of pb and blueberries.  These will be a staple in my fridge.

This was a great recipe, just a slight banana flavor for those who aren't looking for an overly "banana'd" taste.  Will make this again.

These bars were super easy to make. I substituted sunflower seeds for pepitas because I like their flavor better. I also used slightly less banana than the recipe called for so the texture wasn’t as runny and the bars stayed together better. Next time I’d add some coconut flakes to it as well. Overall super easy and yummy!

I can not eat grains right now, but I made them twice for two kids and an adult.  Neither time were they to anyone's taste.  The comment was "bland."  Could be the audience.

We loved the Breakfast Bars. I added some chia seeds and used a whole egg instead of just the white. They came out perfectly and we've been eating them for breakfast ever since. I'll make a new batch this weekend.

There was just one problem with these blueberry/banana bars. They must be magic because they just disappeared quickly.

I made the recipe and though I used almond butter instead of peanut butter, I don't think peanut butter would have changed my rating.  The bars are good.  I individually wrapped them for easy grab and go snacking.

These seem like they are complicated but they are not, and I assembled them in about 15 minutes.  The end result was really tasty breakfast bars. I will switch out the blueberries next time for apples and cinnamon just to try something different. I also didn’t use parchment, I used cooking spray. Also, I didn’t let them cool completely before I cut them, I should have waited.

Well, I didn't have any blueberries or figs, so I substituted apples and dried cranberries. That may have made the difference between great and good. This could be a great basic recipe, but I think the figs are pretty important. You just need that chewy element.  Also, I think they needed a bit more sweetness. I'm not that into sugar, but two tablespoons of honey just didn't do it for me. Next time I'll add the figs and blueberries, but also add more honey or maybe some brown rice syrup.

Great as is, if you are looking for a healthy alternative. My husband thought it was bland (Pablum) and tasted too much like peanut butter, while I liked it quite a bit. If you understand that healthy doesn't mean that it triggers your brain with fat, salt and acid the way processed food or richer foods do, then you will understand what I mean.

Exactly what I was looking for. Delicious, nutritious, low sugar and easily modifiable. I used fresh organic blueberries that were on sale. Raisins instead of figs, and threw in some no sugar added muesli when I didn't have enough oats.  I also added a pint of blueberries, which I think is more than the recipe called for. Still turned out great.  Will be using this as a template for many desserts in the future. Thank you for posting this recipe!

This is dangerously delicious! I substituted dates for figs and cashews for almonds, but it was really, really good!  It was a great topping for breakfast yogurt, or snack by itself.  I will definitely make these again

So Yummy! I made these for my toddler so I did some things differently.  I did not use figs, and I used ground flax feed. I used frozen blueberries because that's what I had. I also added some chocolate chips on top. They are so delicious!  Some one mentioned they made them into muffins, I think I might try them as mini muffins next time!

I'm glad I made it.  Added more blueberries than suggested and may that it is why I found it more like a cake than a bar.  Definitely remake.

Save yourself the time and don’t make this. What a lot of effort to be very disappointed. They would have been ok (yes bland but ok) without sunflower seeds. The sunflower seed flavor takes over. Not a good combination.
