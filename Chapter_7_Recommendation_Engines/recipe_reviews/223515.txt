These corn fritters were great! I don't typically review but I felt compelled to do so since it currently only has one review. The batter was the perfect thickness to produce a fritter that was crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. I used freshly shredded parmesan cheese and I added an extra tablespoon of onion. I also reduced the butter to two tablespoons and used cooking spray (along with the vegetable oil) to try to cut down some of the fat. The recipe seems to be quite versatile. Next time I think I will try adding some garam masala or curry powder and green onions and/or chives.

These were delicious, will definitely be making again! I did change some things though, I added garlic to the batter and used cheddar cheese instead of shredded parm b/c thats what I had on hand. I also used double what the recipe said for bisquick in order to get the nice thick batter needed for the fritters to keep their shape in the fry pan.

These are really good! It made a batch of 8 silver dollar sized fritters.  I made a few just as the recipe stated and then the rest I added some chopped jalapenos (2 tbsp for half of the batter) I liked the spicier ones better!

Yum!  (Okay I didn't really "measure" the ingredients and I substituted some veggies for others- sue me.) But these were SO tasty! I put corn, parm, onion, green pepper, and zucchini in mine. The fritters were a little cakey so I should have made the batter more runny. Served with a little lite sour cream!  I bet leeks and beets would be good in them too.  Next time!

This was just the recipe I was looking for, nothing deep fried or too doughy. I made as directed but used leftover grilled corn cut off the cob. The oil/butter mix for frying was awesome, lots of butter flavor but the oil (I used olive) kept it from getting too dark batch after batch. I will absolutely make again, thanks for sharing!

Good base recipe. I didn't have onion, but I tossed in some diced green pepper and used cheddar cheese since that's  what I had on hand. I made one fritter and thought it tasted bland. So I added plenty onion powder, garlic powder, season salt, black pepper, a dash of red pepper. This makes a delicious savory fritter that I've served with breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also, I've found that frying in too much butter and oil makes them greasy. I lightly coat a nonstick pan with olive oil and they turn out golden, but not oily.

I made these as directed (close as a non-measurer can at any rate) and they were perfect. My daughter and I ate the entire batch for supper. Always a plus when I can both make a new dish that is easy and comes out perfectly AND meet the picky desires of my kid!

I made as per recipe and liked them. They're kind of bland as is, but good for a side  when served with a spicy main dish, which is what I had. I will make them again (makes corn easy to eat!) and tailor them to what else will be on the plate.

Absolutely delicious! Very much like a Zucchini pancake recipe that I make....very tasty; made 8 good sized fritters as a side dish. Used fresh corn, steamed and cut off the cob. 4 ears made 2 cups. Served with grilled chicken and sour cream on the side. A Keeper!

These fritters were beautiful and tasty!  I cut fresh corn from the cob and then fried the corn and the onions together before following the rest of the recipe.  I also tried half of the recipe with about 1 teaspoon of sugar to sweeten them and thought that was a great addition.  I will definitely make these again!

I have tried out various corn fritter recipes this summer, and this is far and away the best!  I substituted the kernels from two ears of leftover corn on the cob and gluten-free Bisquick but otherwise made as directed.  Delicious, and the fritters held together really well!

These were excellent! I followed the recipe as written, and they turned out perfectly. I used leftover corn cut off the cob so the flavor and texture were great. My husband couldn't stop eating them. These were definitely the best corn fritters I've ever made. I will be making them again soon.

Not sure I would make these again but if I do, would make some changes. They were very bland so I would add more salt and add onion powder as well as the chopped onions.  I would cut down on the butter and oil because they were WAY too greasy.  Not a big hit with my family :(

I loved this recipe because it's so flexible. I used one cup of corn and one cup of frozen peas, and I'm already planning to add carrots next time I make them, or maybe bits of browned sausage.  And! I used gluten free bisquick to bind them. They came amazing. They are great for meal prepping because they are so compact.

The onion gives them more of a savory taste. I liked it, my husband hated it, he likes sweet fritters.

I made the recipe as described, and it was pretty terrible.  I gave it two stars instead of one because I don't know what corn fritters are SUPPOSED to taste like, this was my first one.
