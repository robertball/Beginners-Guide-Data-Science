Tip: cut your pumpkin into quarters after you clean out the seeds & wrap it in plastic wrap.  Then microwave & let it cool before you peel the shell off.  It will come right off & you won't burn your fingers.

Great basic recipe. I used it for a dinner party of 60 and had many requests for the recipe.  I used canned pumpkin and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and added the pumpkin pie spice another reviewer had suggested.  It is definately a keeper.

This soup was incredibly difficult to make.  After burning my fingers peeling off pumpkin skins and spending long amounts of time pureeing and preparing it, I was very disappointed in how it turned out.  My fiance, however, put  brown sugar on it and said it was amazing.  He also ate hamburger helper once that I made with vanilla soy milk on accident, so take that into consideration.

excellent--as good as that served on Thanksgiving Day 2002 at Galveston's elegant Moody Gardens Hotel fete in the ballroom

However, I prefer the soup sans sour cream.

Nice and rich, but very mildly flavored. I would saute a chopped onion at the beginning if I were to make it again. I would also add some paprika or even a bit of heat

So easy to make! Found two little sugar pumpkins at the Farmer's Market begging to come home with me. I'm sure canned pumpkin would work, too, but it was really fun roasting my own. I didn't have sage, so I substituted poultry seasoning. Use the best chicken stock you can buy, it always makes a big difference. I also adjusted the seasonings by putting in more than called for. I'm going to make this next time I have company for dinner in the fall, and served it out of a pumpkin shell. Deceptively good for such little work!

Yummy!  Very easy to make.  It was a bit salty for our family, so will decrease the salt next time.  Used canned pumpkin, and added a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  We loved it, even the little kids!

I had a large amount of pie pumpkins and wanted to try something new. This was great I gave it 4 stars because I did a little tweaking. I added an additional cup of pumpkin puree because my family likes thick soups. I didn’t have any whipping cream on had so I used evaporated milk, I also added some onion, garlic, cayenne pepper and black pepper to taste. This was a hit with my 4 ½ year old and husband and we will be serving on Thanksgiving.

It was average, and only because I did a lot of adding on my own. After I followed the recipe, it seemed to taste to bland; so I added some cinnamon, brown sugar, some white sugar, and a peeled, cored, and cubed fresh apple. It tasted better after that. It gave it some sweetness.

1) very simple/easy to make. 
2) savory & satisfying for myself and the household consumers. 
3) I made this twice initially - first with a sugar pumpkin and second with a jack-o-lantern style left over.  Both were excellent, but I added brown sugar to the recipe with the more bland jack-o-lantern gourd.  
4) both were better when garnished with fresh black pepper. 
Enjoy!!  - definately worth trying.

very easy.  Served without sour cream dollop.  Suggest eating it first night as sitting overnight did not add anything to it.  Pretty good but my dds (ages 2 and 4) did not like it.  Particularly good with toast.

A lovely soup.  It's very easy to make yummy. I would add a little less sage and something a little spicy.  Pepper or red pepper flakes were a nice addition.

Disappointed.  I was so excited about this recipe and even used other's suggestions for it (i.e. canned pumpkin, 1/2 and 1/2, and pumpkin pie spice) my kitchen smelled fabulous and yet this just did not turn out very well for me.  I was a bit pressed for time so I was looking for something easy which it was very easy to put togther but the initial upfront taste was bitter and unpleasant.  The aftertaste although was very good and tasted like pumpkin.  If anyone has any sugestions as to how to make this better I would welcome them because I absolutely love anything pumpkin!

Used canned pumpkin. Soup was flavorless. I even added the pumpkin pie spice after tasting it. Still didn't care for it.

Very easy to make! I halved the recipe, I'm cooking for just myself. The pumpkin didn't even take the full 45 minutes to roast, I think it took about 30. I let it cool for a bit, and the skin came right off, in two perfect pieces. Used the Magic bullet to puree the pumpkin and broth in two batches. I let it simmer with fresh sage (didn't have dried), nutmeg and salt. Added a small bit of heavy cream at the end. I didn't really measure anything, I didn't want to make a huge mess to clean, and it came out pretty well. I will definitely make it again with my other sugar pumpkin.

Loved this recipe! One thing I enjoy about allrecipes.com is being able to get some great ideas on what to make. This is a great recipe for a basic pumpkin soup but one can always tailor the recipe to your liking.  I roasted my own pumpkin and pureed once cooled.  I only used a few ingredients: chicken stock, pumpkin puree, pepper, heavy whipping cream and added Parmesan  cheese for taste. Absolutely divine soup..  will be serving it with croutons for lunch.  Definitely will be making it again :)

It was really bland I think next time I would add some more spices like celery seed or something else salty.
