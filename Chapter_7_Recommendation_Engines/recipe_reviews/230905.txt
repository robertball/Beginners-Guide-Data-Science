I had to substitute balsamic vinegar for the soy sauce as I'm soy-intolerant, but this recipe turned out awesome! Quick, easy, great flavour.

My husband and I really enjoyed this, and he doesn't often care for seafood.  It was really quick and all ingredients were on hand.  If you are like me and prefer your tuna medium rare, cook as the recipe suggests.  My husband likes it a bit more well-done, so we just put his back on the heat.  (But keep in mind, if you let your tuna sit/rest 3 to 5 minutes off of the stovetop, it will continue to cook a bit more from its own internal heat.  That way you can be assured that it won't get dry from overcooking, which is always a concern with seafood.)  This recipe is a keeper.  It's the second time I've made it this month.

Not my favorite. I have never made seared tuna before, but have really enjoyed the stuff I've had at restaurants. This recipe was not on par. I think it cooks the tuna for too long at too low a heat, so it ends up overcooked and tasting somewhat like canned tuna. We did not marinade the tuna for a whole 20 minutes (due to time constraints), but otherwise followed the recipe perfectly. I'm glad we didn't marinate it any longer, otherwise I think all we would have tasted is soy sauce. The marinade was very salty and really clung to the tuna steak. I would advise rinsing off the marinade thoroughly before cooking to avoid a too strong soy sauce flavor. Unfortunatly, I would actually just skip this recipe all together.

These were so moist and tender.  Liked that they did not take long to sear.  So very tasty!

Marinade was delicious and perfect for 2 steaks that were about inch and a half thick.   I followed exactly.   Seared steaks 4 minutes on the grill on each side.   Then garnished the, with fresh cut scallions, cilantro, and rolled the sides in black and white sesame seeds.    
Highly recommend !

Marinade was too sour. Maybe less lemon juice and some sugar would have improved this dish.

Tasted like other tuna recipes we've tried, nothing special. You couldn't get the flavor from the ginger or the sesame oil to hit the taste buds like it should.  Won't make again.

This was an excellent combination of sweet, astringent and spicy! Didn’t change a thing. Be aware, though - if you don’t like your tuna REALLY rare, you’ll need to increase the cooking times.

Perfect recipe. I reserved the marinade and added to the end of sautéing some garden greens and summer squash. Served the tuna on the bed of these vegetables. Delicious with a beautiful presentation.

Good recipe, appreciate the direction for excellent pan frying. Skipped the ginger and cayenne and molasses. Otherwise, very excellent way to do 1 inch tuna. Yummy

This was my first time making this tuna steaks. I didn’t have soy sauce and substituted it for worchestire instead. I must say I was very pleased with the end results. I will definitely  be using this recipe again. Thank you.

This marinade was a perfect partner for the tuna steaks. A wonderful combination of flavors that the tuna soaked up beautifully.

This is great! I have never cooked tuna before and my bf doesn't really like fish but he liked it a lot and it turned out great, following the instructions to a T. Only downside is the high heat and sesame oil in a small space. Will definitely smoke the place up and probably set off the detector.

This was delicious!   Made mostly as directed, except I used half the cayenne which allowed the other flavours to shine and I cooked it over higher heat to get a nicer seat on the outside.  Also, I had sushi grade tuna and therefore I did not need to cook it to 140 degrees.   A lower internal temperature left the fish more moist.  Family loved it and we will make it again.  A good alternative for when it is too cold to grill outside!

This was a great recipe. I was nervous about cooking it bc I'm a novice with fish. I followed the recipe exactly as stated except I changed the way I cooked it. I used a non-stick pan, 2 TBSP of vegetable oil and waited until the oil was hot before I put the steaks on. I cooked for 2 mins on one side and 1.5 mins on the other. I served with sautéed sugar snap peas and sake. It was a great dinner. The marinade made a nice caramel color on the outside. The flavors were great. I used a previously frozen non sushi grade steak. There was no "fishy" flavor and the inside was pink. Will try again. Thank you!

This is a great recipe. I didn't follow exactly but close. I only had a meyer lemon, which was an easy swap. Everything else I had in the house. I thought the molasses was going to be a bit too strong a flavor with the others, so I swapped with a tablespoon of brown sugar. I like a good sear on the outside of the tuna, so I cooked at a higher temp.

Excellent, easy, tasty recipe.  Thank you for submitting.  I didn't have fresh ginger, unfortunately, so I used powder.  Will definitely make again with fresh ginger.

This was a good recipe.  Easy, not too bad to clean up, but we did think it was a little on the salty side, even with us using low sodium soy sauce.  We're gonna keep this one, but probably change it up a little.

We seared the steaks for two minutes on each side, but my wife was a little skeptical of the "done-ness" of the tuna.  We fixed that by putting them in the oven for five minutes.  This wasn't a problem with the recipe.  It was more about personal taste for us.

I only made one and didn't add the garlic and sesame oil because I didn't have any, but it was very good and I will definitely make it again.

Loved this recipe...quick to make with ingredients readily available in my pantry.  I eliminated the cayenne pepper (allergic to it) with no loss of flavor.  The tuna was pink in the center and just perfect!  Definitely will make this again.

Pretty, but just ok. The marinade was too tart.

So good! I didn't have fresh ginger or garlic cloves, so I used dried ginger powder and garlic powder. Hubby loved it!
