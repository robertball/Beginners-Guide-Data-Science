I'm about to make my second batch of this autumn gold. It's worth the time and effort, especially made with local organic apples and pears. I followed the recipe exactly except for a dash of clove, which gives it a distinctly southern nuance. Absolutely delish!

I made a double recipe which is not a great idea because it takes longer to reduce the water but turned out wonderful! I also added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 cup of brown sugar
