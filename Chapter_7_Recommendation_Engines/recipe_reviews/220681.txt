This recipe turned out great, with a few modifications.   I used 2 cups of boiled and pureed beets (instead of canned), added 1/2 tsp nutmeg amd 1 tsp vanilla, and substituted 1 c apple sauce for 1 c of the oil (reducing the oil in the recipe to 1/2 cup).  I spooned the batter into greased muffin pans, and baked at 350 for about 25 minutes.  The muffins (or cupcakes) turned out moist and delicious, and my kids loved them.  I must say that I was excited about the vivid magenta batter, but in the end, the muffins only had a tinge of red on top - the insides were a typical carrot cake colour.  What a great way to use some excess beets and carrots, and sneak more veggies into my kids!

Very tasty! Made these alterations:

Made cupcakes instead of a large cake (cooking time 20 minutes), substituted milk in place of 1/2 the oil, used only 3 eggs, and omitted the wheat bran and wheat germ. Still very good!

I omitted wheat germ and wheat bran, used 1 C oil + .5 C milk instead of 1.5 C oil, and 14 oz fresh, raw grated beets instead of canned. 

I think the cake would be a lot better with the following changes: more sugar, less cinnamon plus other spices (maybe nutmeg and allspice), and vanilla extract. Some grated orange peel would be good, too. If you are using raw beets like I did, I would reduce beets and increase carrots. The beet flavor was dominant in mine.
