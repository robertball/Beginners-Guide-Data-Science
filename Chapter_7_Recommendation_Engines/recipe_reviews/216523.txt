I tripled the recipie to make two pies, I always fill the pans to the top, . It was super easy and I was amazed how awesome they turned out. It has a creamy texture not unlike a cheese cake. So far everyone loves it. Totally bringing them for the Christmas dessert!

I was looking for something different to make and tried this.   I doubled the recipe and made 2 pies.  Baked them for about 55 minutes and they turned out great!   Loved the texture and tasted great!

absolutely wonderful!
I used fresh apples, peeled,  diced and boiled with a small amount of water and splenda to sweeten. Also used egg substitute and added some coconut. This has become a family favorite and is so simple.

This was just OK for us.  I like the flavor but the texture doesn't appeal to me - creamy yet wet.  I added a bit of vanilla extract to mine.  Also, I think I would prefer a regular pasty pie shell instead of the graham cracker crust.

I made this recipe today and it wasn't overly flavorful but served warm out of the oven I must say it is a nice comfort food. Made two of them as I was looking for a dessert that would be easy to digest for a relative with cancer and this one fit the bill. I will make it again. Tastes great on a cold fall afternoon with a cup of steaming hot coffee.

I substituted canned coconut milk for the condensed milk and topped with raspberry preserves. The effect is cheesecake-like for those of us who love cheesecake but canâ€™t eat dairy.

i added extra cinnamon. But this was really enjoyable. Will be making again, and pretty easy to do.

I didn't change the recipe at all!  My husband (who is not a desert eater at all), my co-workers, and myself loved this pie!  It's so easy and quick to make!  I didn't use store bought applesauce...I make my own and had some stored away that needed to be used.  The texture and taste is similar to pumpkin pie...mmmm.  I'm making it again tonight for a family gathering tomorrow.

Followed recipe exactly. I don't know what I expected, but this was very bland. Noone in my house wanted seconds.
