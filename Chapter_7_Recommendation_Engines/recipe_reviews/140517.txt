I'm Russian as well and make pirozhki pretty much the same way. Here is what I do differently:

I rub shredded cabbage with garlic salt in a large pot, and then pour boiling water over the cabbage covering completely. Boil the mixture until soft, usually around 15 min. Take the pot off the heat, drain the cabbage and return it to the pot, add spices, .5 to 1 spoon of butter(I use Smart Balance butter or other butter made with olive oil), and the eggs.

Also, after pinching the end together, I turn piroshok so that the pinched ends are on the bottom rather than on the side. It helps to keep not-so-well-pinched pirozhkis closed during baking and creates a nice symmetric shape. :)

After placing the pirozhki on the baking sheet, I let the dough rise just a little. Right before baking, I brush them with beaten egg yolk for glowing smooth look when ready. 

Yumm!

I love this recipe, just like all other russian children, I grew up eating these! I also fry onions in olive oil until they are golden and sometimes a little bit burnt and add them to mashed potatoes, if you use the oil from frying the onions then you really dont need to add milk or butter whem mashing the potatoes. Another filling is sour cherries, i don't think anyone mentioned that, from what i know the  traditional fillings for pirozhki that you can buy at a russian store is meat, potatoes, cabbage, or cherries, sometimes i'll also add 18% fat cottage cheese with a little of my favorite (or whatever i have in the pantry) jam inside.

This recipe is wonderful and a real crowd pleaser.  My Russian Mother in law loved these.  I recommend brushing them with egg yolk just before putting them in the oven for that professional, golden color and shininess.  Also, it is very traditional to add cooked white rice with the filling or mashed potatoes.   The salt and pepper are key in the filling; too little is very bland.

Ok..I cannot BEGIN to tell you how awsome this bread is! You simply CANT mess it up...And believe me I did some pretty dumb things this time but the bread just rolled its eyes at me and thought to itself..."looks like Im on my own!" I thought for sure it would just be a train wreck but low and behold it was superfabuloso!! For you novices out there this is the recipe for you. And dont let it fool you. I had some leftover dough and filled it with roastbeef rice and cheese and some seasoning on it was a mouth wattering experience!! You can stuff this bread with anything...use your imagination, and go wild!~  thank-you,thank-you thank-you mariasaurus Rex!!

Delicious, plain or with some mustard! I'd never had or heard of these before, but I'm glad I tried them out. I was a little surprised the directions didn't say to knead the dough, but I followed the recipe & didn't knead it--sure enough, it turned out great (and that made the recipe that much easier to do!). I'll definitely be making these again.

I'm having a huge Russian dinner tonight and I was looking for a good recipe for Pirozhki. I scanned a lot of websites, including some in Russian and I changed the recipe a little bit according what I found and I used food processor for making the dough: I used 2 eggs, reduced milk to 1 and 3/4 cups and used 1.5 packages of active dry yeast. I put 5 cups of flour to the food processor, added salt, run it for a couple of seconds (I use dough blade and speed), added butter and run it again for  a couple of seconds. I dissolved yeast in the milk with sugar, after 10 min I added two eggs, slightly bitten to the yeast mixture. Turned on my food processor and slowly added the yeast mixture, let it run for a minute and slowly added about 1/2 cups of flour (as much as needed to form elastic and non sticky dough). I let it raise around 1.5 hours and made pirozhki, I let the pirozhki to rise for 20-25 min, brushed with egg and baked them for 20 min on 400F... These turned out great - soft and fluffy... Be sure not to make the dough too thin. I'm sure that the original recipe is also good, but I changed it according to the "Russian sources".  Good luck - pirozhki is a great food, especially shared with friends :)

I am so glad to find this recipe, a friend requested me to find this and make them for her husband.  I believe his mother used to make them.  My friend is blind, but now I can make them for the both of them, thanks for posting it!

This sounds delicious and reminds me of German Bierocks which I used to get in Kansas. The difference is that Bierocks don't usually use hard boiled eggs in the filling, but use cabbage and ground meat.  Great stuff.

I love these. I see that the cabbage filling is quite different from how my mother/family makes it. I just though i would share. My mother shreds the cabbage, dices some onions and grates some carrots. She sautes the onions and carrots until slightly golden and translucent. Sometimes she adds meat and she fries the meat before the onion and garlic and then she adds after it has cooked a little bit. After the onions and carrots are ready she tosses in the cabbage and sautes it all together just until the cabbage is slightly cooked. Then she adds tomato sauce and lets it all simmer for a few minutes until the cabbage is fully cooked but not too mooshy or too soft just give it a taste and test it. It is very delicious when added to the pirozhki. Give this  a try next time.

If you liked cooked cabbage then this is for you. If not, try making some cheese bourekas instead

The breading on this is very good!! I give that part 5 stars!  I like to fill my Pirozhki with cabbage, ground pork, green onions, and skinny long rice noodles. I fry up all the filling ingredients first and then stuff the Pirozhki and bake it. This way you get a whole yummy meal in one bun!

rocky liked this.  1st time I went heavy w/ the cabbage.  Next time I will use meat, carrots and onions (cabbage bakes up kind of bitter).  Do use an egg yolk wash.

I used whole wheat flour instead of AP flour, and soy milk instead of cow's milk for the dough.  I added dill seeds for extra flavor in the filling!  These are great!

So glad to have found this yummy recipe!  I altered it to make it taste like the pirozhki's I have had at the Bite of Seattle... include ground meat, and a cheddar cheese square in each "pouch.", omitted the egg, just a very little cabbage.   Next time, I will try the traditional version, to see what that is like.  Used an egg wash (beaten egg with a little water) to paint on before baking...came out shiny and pretty!  I also halved the recipe...still made 15!

Absolutely delicious!!! This recipe was soooo good, I'll definitely save it.  I was almost out of all purpose flour so I used bread flour instead. I also used an egg wash to make it shiny.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

You can try to make pirozki with any filling: mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes and mushrooms, eggs and green onion, ground beef, or sweet filling, they are perfect.

OUTSTANDING! My mom used to make these several times through out the year.  She would leave a bowl of them sitting on the stove so dad and us kids could just grab one on our way out the door. These taste exactly like hers, which I haven had since she passed away when I was 17, some 40 years ago, and took the recipe with her.  I can't thank you enough,Rex,for sharing this recipe.  The first time I tasted one I cried, it brought back such wonderful memories.

BTW - They are also really good made with the traditional potato filling used in boiled/pan fried perogies.

Not bad (love the filling) but definitely needs the egg yolk glaze before baking.  Mine looked rather dull and unappetising.

We made this for a Russian themed dinner party and it was a big hit!  Brushing the pirozhki with egg yolk before cooking was a great tip - made them look very appetizing.  Can't wait to make these again!

Pirozhki turned out really nice - I am Ukrainian and these are the way I remember them. Before I left the dough to rise, I pat it with some vegetable oil to prevent drying out. My two fillings were: fried onions and ground beef; feta and spinach with a dash of nutmeg. I brushed the tops with a yolk beaten with a bit of water and my pirozhki were ready on 180C in 25 minutes. Vkusno!

The dish know as Pirozhki was somewhat decent but rather plane. I thought that there needed to be more salt. Overall it wasn't as good as I expected and would not recommend having unless for a snack.

i haven't tried the recipe yet but im sure it's goin to be delicious. My  parents usually  fry those  but the baked version is probably  healthier. I have some suggestions for the  filling. Cut up some hard boiled eggs and green onios and mix  it all together plus season  it with salt and pepper. Thats my  favorite filling. Also mashed potatoes with some white onion is  really good. But dont use  the mashed potatoes  from the  package. I think they are  not thick enough.

Awesome.  Used saurkraut. Next time I will remember to warm the milk before adding yeast.  Probably will be more fluffy.  I loved them. Kids did, too.

I substitute the filling for a rice and beef mixture because my friends and family are picky, but this has always been a hit at parties! People are amazed that the bread is made from scratch too!

This was a really good dinner—though I used microwave bacon for the meat and then basted them with egg before sticking them in the oven. I think I messed up the bread, though—I’m cursed with terrible bread whenever I try to make it. But it was awesome nonetheless, and it made a good lunch the next day.

I didn't have any milk on hand so I used soy milk instead, and it turned out just as well as I expected. Once you got the bread part done you can pretty much relax on the filling, because it's gonna be good any way you make it. I just threw chopped cabbage and a few eggs into a pan and stir fried everything together, and it turned out super nice!! I will most likely attempt again in the near future.

These taste wonderful and very authentic.   Generally I order my piroshkies at a place called Piroshki on 3rd in Seattle which are amazing.  However I think I'll put the effort in and make them myself sometimes after trying this recipe.

So mid way baking the first batch it started looking a bit dry . The photo looks like they've been oiled . So I oiled it once mid bake.

2nd batch I oiled before putting them in the oven. After baking all of them . My husband told me he rememberes his grandmother used to oil them multiple times through out the bake. 

Can someone post a photo of what it looks like inside ? How thick the dough or bread should be when cooked ? I noticed the Russian perogies at the Russian store have a similar texture and taste to some of the Chinese pastry buns.  My husband said the Russian stores are not making it right. 

I'm very confused now as what the dough should taste and feel like when cooked .  Does anyone have photos or a description ?

I grew up in a Russian household and my mom made these all the time with various fillings. I also pretty much subsisted on them when I traveled to Russia and Ukraine. They're such a comfort food for me. I've never made them before myself, but bought a head of cabbage at the green market and decided to give pirozhki a try.  My mom hasn't been in a condition to cook/bake much over the last few years, so she has forgotten quite a bit... she was able to give me some tips on the filling, but not the dough. So when I found this recipe, it seemed easy and promising enough...

I followed the dough recipe exactly as written here. Unfortunately, it's just not as fluffy, moist and light as a remember it being. This reminded me more of crusty dinner rolls or pizza crust... very bready, yeasty, and a bit bland. It isn't necessarily bad, just not what I remember it being at all... and I'm not sure it's the right dough for pirozhki.

The filling should be okay as is, but I made some adjustments based on how my mom made these and just personal taste. I salted the raw cabbage a bit and let it sit in a bowl for a few minutes. I sauteed one chopped onion and a grated carrot, and then added in the cabbage and sauteed until soft. Added more salt and also pepper to taste. I added chopped boiled eggs (4-5 should be fine) to the mixture after it cooled a bit. You can fill these with anything, really. Mashed potatoes, mushrooms, meat, fresh fruit, preserves, tvorog (farmer's cheese), etc.

I made these. It was some work. They turned out very bland. I'm guessing I need to dice the cabbage finer and add WAY more salt and pepper. How much salt and pepper should be added? Thanks.

Really great recipe. When I've made piroshki before or had them, they're often fried and they feel greasy - good no doubt, but not very healthy. These tasted good and NO GREASE! :) My dough did not triple. I would say it doubled at the most (my fault, I'm terrible at working with yeast it seems) - but they were still fairly fluffy and I didn't have any problems with the texture. Hopefully next time my dough will get bigger. Practice makes perfect. :) 

My fillings:

- hot dogs 
- sauteed carrots, cabbage and onion (s&p, of course)
- sauteed hot dogs, mushrooms and onion (s&p, of course and Ichopped them up before putting them in the pan...and as weird as the combo may sound, they were everyone's favourite and everybody fought over them until they were gone) 

I love piroshki with cherries and mashed potatoes. I'd like to double the recipe next time though because they went super quick! :) And I didn't have enough dough to get the mashed potato filling in!

My Russian grandmother made this on a sheet pan but made it with ground beef mixed with the cabbage.  Delicious!

I loved these Pirozhkis, but for fun, I dropped each in boiling soda water which turned into pretzel Pirozhkis.
