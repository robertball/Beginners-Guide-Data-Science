My Mom made Potato soup this way, and I have myself for years.  Sometimes I jazz it up a bit and add cheese, bacon, celery, or sometimes I am in the mood for plain Old Fashioned Potato soup.  The only things I do different from this recipe is use cmilk and 2% milk, and I also add a stick of butter or Margarine.  Easy to make and tastes yummy.

Exactly the way my mom made potato soup when I was growing up...before the days of adding bacon, cheese, etc. I was thrilled when she made it! HA! Simple is usually best.  Definitely use russet potatoes and not red.

Somebody tell me why not use red potatoes?  That's all I ever used in my house.. They are great in the soup I make and everything else I use them in.
