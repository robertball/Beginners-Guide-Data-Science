I am the recipe submitter and would like to say that the sausage called for should NOT have the casings removed, that is not how I submitted it.  Also I'd like to add that the amount of kale may seem like lots, however like spinach, it shrinks down quite a bit. Enjoy!

I added some heavy cream at the end of preparing this soup and found the dish absolutely superb - even after having froze the main body of the soup - still delicious!

Excellent soup... I used the ingredients as noted in the recipe but changed the process in cooking so that it was all within the same pot.  Still worked out great!  Nice flavors, great for a rainy night in.

Oh, my heavens!  This is delicious!  I adapted mine to make it vegetarian with Morningstar sausages and vegetable broth.  I can't wait to make it again!

Very good! We got a large bunch of kale from a local farmer and didn't really know what to do with it!  I used green onion b/c it is what we had on hand, and like another reviewer, I used morningstar sausage crumbles.  I did adjust the amounts a bit to avoid a trip to the store : ) 2 large potatoes, a whole bag of sausage crumbles, and vegetable broth (6 cups).  I sauteed the about 5 green onions (chopped) in about 2 tbsp. of butter!  Definitely would make again!!

Love soup anytime and followed  directions (didn't take the casing off). I looked at other recipes and I'm glad I found this  one. It is now my favorite.

So delicious. Doesn't look the best - my son and his friend took small bowls to start - then they went back for seconds and thirds! Thanks for sharing

I liked this soup quite a bit. Just spicy enough, but not too spicy.

Wonderful recipe, Nathalie!  Since I didn't have and hot Italian sausage, I used some fully cooked Andouille sausage- tastes great.  I had been looking for a good recipe so I could use some beautiful chard I found at Whole Foods.  Thanks!

Absolutely awesome!  I also added leek, shallots and mushrooms.  For the chicken stock, I used chicken bullion, but didn't use all that would be required for 3 quarts in order to reduce sodium (it would have been 12 cups of chicken bullion -- I used 8 plus 4 cups of plain water).  I would suggest removing the casing from the sausage.

I made this soup and it was delicious! I followed the recipe except that after frying the sausage I didn’t remove it from the pot. I like that this recipe doesn’t use cream or milk. Lactose is a problem for my family and this soup is delicious without it.

I made this delicious Fall soup using herb and garlic Usinger chicken sausage casing on. Adding some squeeze garlic puree, no hot sauce but a little red pepper flakes, curly kale, a little extra chicken stock as we like soupy soup. Otherwise I followed the directions. It was the perfect comfy soup for a rainy autumn afternoon. Thank you!

This was really good.  It was a little spicy for my taste, but not for my husband's.  We both liked it better with some cream added, though.  I think I used more kale than the recipe called for.

This was very good. We used turkey sausage. I was a little confused about how to cook sausage based on what seemed like a difference between recipe ingredient list and the author's review of the recipe. I ended up taking casings off and just frying up the sausage in a large pot. Then added onions and kale.  Should have cut the kale in smaller pieces but it was really very good in this soup. At the end I added the potatoes and hot sauce. Neither of us really felt like the potatoes belonged. Next time might try pasta or cheese tortellini instead. Definitely good and will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Ooops, I read to late your comment about NOT removing the casings, but I must say the results were still fabulous.  I think you can go either way with either large junks of juicy sausage in a big bite or small pieces in each and every bit.  I made a rather large batch of this stuff because I had a huge bag of kale that I did not want to go bad.  So now I have a number of servings in the freezer.  I know the potatoes may not be the best after defrosting, but they are in small cubes and I'll get over it; the rest of the flavours will make up for that.  I haven't tried it with the hot sauce yet, but I will.  I LOVE hot sauce ... I grow my on Ghost Chiles.  The only extra thing I added was a little bit of Morton's Season All, maybe a teaspoon are so.

I made a 'paleo' version of this recipe by substituting semi-smashed cauliflower florets for the potatoes.  I didn't have Frank's Red hot on hand so just added Cayenne to taste.  Absolutely delicious!

We found this recipe easy to make but we did not enjoy it.  It was our first time trying Kale and we did not like the texture. We'll keep looking for a way to eat Kale!

Absolutely delicious.  I added leeks and used slightly less broth (as I like my soup chunky).
