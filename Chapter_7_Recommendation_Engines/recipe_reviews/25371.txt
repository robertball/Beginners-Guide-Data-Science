I really like the flavor the recipe give. I usually throw it all in the crock pot and let it go. I then take out the chicken and shred it. It is so yummy and reminds me of a great resturant in Arizona.

On this one, I tripled the sauce and marinated the chicken in 2/3s of it.  Omitted the oregano, and added cilantro (a key ingredient!) at the end of sauteeing the chicken.  When I sauteed the chicken (strips not cubed), I dumped the marinade and added the last 1/3 of fresh marinade to the chicken as it was nearly done cooking through, which only took a few minutes, not the 20 mins the recipe calls for!  I also added a splash of tequila to the chicken while cooking, per other reviewers; was a nice touch!  Used white corn tortillas (personal fave), and served with grated colby/jack cheese, chopped tomatoes, &  the guacamole on allrecipes.com by Bob Cody, increasing his call for cayenne pepper by at least double.  That gave this dish a bite that I think it needed.  Would have been too bland for us, otherwise, but it was a nice meal, complete with margaritas!

Based on the numerous reviews I was anxious to try this recipe.  It was okay.  Very similar to a marinade I use for fajaita chicken tacos which my family liked much better.  Sorry.....

We thought these were awesome! A refreshing change from regular tacos.  Things I did differently - used cilantro instead of oregano, 1 regular onion instead of 2 green, and used the juice of a whole lime instead of 1/2.  I cut the chicken in strips instead of cubing it.  Used Sargento's 4 Cheese Mexican blend for the cheese.  I think you should definitely use fresh lime as opposed to the bottle stuff, if you really want the lime flavor to stand out.  (And its not overpowering). Also, this recipe states that it serves 10, that would be 1 taco per person, and who can eat just 1?  I think this recipe serves more like 4-5.  I love this recipe, it is definitely a unique and cheap dish to make for a large group!

At first I thought the red wine vinegar was strange, but it did add a good flavor.  Overall the tacos were really good, but in the future I will omit the oregano- it added an Italian flavor, as some had mentioned.  I doctored this up a bunch and added cilantro, extra lime, and served with some sliced peppers and onions which I stir-fried in olive oil and cumin (didn't have lettuce).  I think cumin or cilantro are definitely more appropriate seasonings rather than the oregano.  We served these with salsa. We'll make these again.  **also- I found that after cutting the recipe in half (to serve 5) my husband and I only had a small dinner.  I think the full recipe would probably only be enough for 4 people (not 10).

DELISH! The guys I served it to, and myself, thought it was great. Really tasty if you like lime. I loved having tacos with chicken instead of my usual hamburger meat. Instead of cubing the chicken, I boiled the chicken breasts until cooked through and then shredded them. Then I cooked the chicken with the liquids for about 10 minutes, til it had absorbed the flavors. Yum!

Yummy Yum Yum!!!! This was so good and EASY to make!!! I mixed all of the seasoning ingredients in a small bowl while the chicken was sauteing and just dumped it in the skillet and stirred the last 10 minutes of cooking. I used a teaspoon of oil while sauteing the chicken so it wouldn't stick to the skillet and it didn't affect the flavor in anyway. DH and I loved this and so did our 1 yr old! I'm sure my 8 year old would love it too but he was having dinner with his grandparents....too bad he missed out!!!! I used 3 Tbsp of lime juice (bottled kind) and it was delicious!!! I'd recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a nice change from regular tacos! I think I'm going to try these with quesadillas sometimes too! Thanks so Marissa! These were DELICIOUS!!!!!

I love this.  I brown the chicken and then dice it and return it to the skillet to finish with the sauce.  I don't use oregano.  I have used cilantro and a splash of tequila.  I use these in tacos with avocado and sour cream.  I love these as nachos on the tequila lime tortilla chips.  I have even frozen the cooked chicken mixture and it came out beautifully.  Everytime I make these I tell my husband how much I love them.

With a few minor changes we really loved these tacos! The things I did differently were: I doubled the amount of sauce and used the juice of 2 limes in it, I omitted the oregano entirely, and I topped the tacos with shredded cheese, shredded (raw) cabbage, diced tomatoes, chopped cilantro and a little bit of homemade Baja Cream (mix 1/4 cup mayo + 1/4 cup light sour cream + 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice + 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lime peel & chill till the flavors meld)..... Some of the reviewers said their chicken didn't have much flavor, but if you double the sauce like I did and cook it for the full time stated in the recipe (so the chicken has a chance to brown to a nice caramel color), then it has plenty of flavor.  Soooooo yummy!

As is, I give the recipe 3 stars, we thought it had potential but didn't care for it as is. However over time I've improved it more to my family's liking. I put chicken breasts in the crockpot, add 1/8 cup WHITE wine vinegar, the juice of 2-3 limes, garlic, salt, pepper, sugar, and cumin leaving out the oregano and I use a regular yellow or white onion rather than green onions. I cook it on low until done and shred it up. That way it's a 5 star recipe.

Delicious but be forewarned that it does have a kick to it!  A splash of Tequila to the sauce while cooking adds a wonderful flavor.

This has tons of flavor.  The lime really makes these taste incredible.  I used cilantro to enhance the flavor.  If you like soft tacos, you must try these...thank you Marissa.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I sauteed the garlic with a bit of finely diced onion in a tiny bit of oil and then browned the chicken in it before adding the sauce.  I quadrupled the sauce (being very liberal with the limes) and let it reduce down which gave the chicken a lovely color and added amazing intensity to the flavor.  Whooee it leaves your kitchen smelling all garlicky until the next morning but it sure is worth it!  This is my new favorite way to eat chicken.

Although I changed the recipe a bit, it's a great place to start! I used turkey, reduced the amount  to 1lb and sauted the turkey in a small amount of olive oil with fresh ground pepper. I reduced the cooking time to 5-7minutes until cooked through.I also added a 1/4 cup of cilantro and extra lime juice. Wrap your tortillas in foil and put them in the oven at 200 degrees and they will be ready at the same time as the filling. thanks for a new favorite recipe!

I was a little leary of adding the red wine vinegar, but it turned out great!  I doubled the recipe, to feed 10 of us, (I think the servings are off on this one) I also added a teaspoon of cumin and doubled the amount of garlic.  Topped them with tomato, lettuce, cheese and salsa verde!  Very good.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I've made this several times using leftover grilled chicken breast.  I shred and put into my crockpot and simmer on low for about 4 hours.  I triple the amount of either red or white wine vinegar and lime juice, use splenda instead of sugar, and cilantro instead of oregano.  I've even used the chicken for chicken taco salad.  It's a very flavourful dish.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Great recipe!  I followed other user suggestions and added onions and green peppers, cilantro instead of oregano and used a whole lime.  Delish!  Served on corn tortillas with avocado, cheese, tomato and a greek yogurt sauce (yogurt, jalapeno, cream cheese and cilantro mixture)

Very good! I threw all the ingredients, including frozen chicken breasts, in the crock pot in the morning. When I returned from work, the chicken was so moist and fell apart on its own.

Tastes great and is healthy.  Instead of cubing the chicken, I cut them into strips.  Cooking the chicken for 30 minutes is overkill though.  When the chicken is cut up, you just need to cook until browned, add sauce, and simmer for 10 minutes until cooked through.  For an easy lunch the next day, I made this into a chicken salad.  Instead of soft tacos, you can top the salad with crushed tortilla chips.  The lime sauce make an excellent fat free and no fuss dressing.  I also use 75% fat free Cabot cheddar.  It has great flavor and texture, and you don't miss the fat one bit.

I did not care for this recipe. It was dull and had a lifeless flavor. Couldn't even taste the ingredients. I am going to stick with my tried and true way of using Lawry's Taco seasoning. Bland, bland bland!

Very good recipe, although I too left out the oregano as it just doesn't belong in a Mexican dish! I had grilled chicken left over from the night before so just heated it through with the other seasonings, lime juice and red wine vinegar...was really tasty (doubled the amount of lime) and I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the inspiration!

We have enjoyed this recipe many times, and have improvised several versions.  I, often, substitute lime-pepper for the amount of salt and pepper in the recipe ingredients.

These were pretty good tacos but they tasted more like they belonged in a true quesadilla. These are VERY tangy and if you don't love a bit of lime/vinegar kick, they might not be for you.

Amazing recipe! So good to break away from the "normal" chicken tacos and try something new! We had them twice already! I added cilantro and sour cream for a topping and used corn tortillas

this was awesome!  I was looking for a change from the original taco seasoning and this is it!  Very light with a great taste!  I also used a whole Lime and cilantro instead of oregano and it was awesome!  If you are looking for something new and tastey, then you need to try this!! I didnt have the green onion but it was still delish!

We love this recipe! Simple, subtle flavors really shine here. Great served with all the fixings - sour cream, lettuce, tomato, avocado, cilantro, whatever! Thanks :)

This was good, and will probably go into the rotation, but it is not without flaws.  Just reading the recipe I figured it would be bland, so I upped all of the seasonings by about a half tsp to one full tsp.  I also added about 1 tsp each of cayenne and cumin and 1/2 tsp of corn starch.  I mixed all of the dry seasonings together (so the cornstarch wouldn't clump up)and also probably tripled the garlic, which I pressed instead of minced. For the liquids, I ended up using the juice of 2 limes and at least 1/4 cup of vinegar. With these changes, it was a flavorful meal and was well liked by the entire family.

So many 4 and 5 star ratings is a mystery to me.  This was not 5 star to us. Meat was not very tasty. We eat a lot of Mexican/Tex-Mex foods and I felt this needed another layer of flavor... so I added fresh cilantro, sour cream, cumin and a little chili powder.  Enjoyed it very much after the additions. Also, did not care for "cubed" chicken. Would have been better, in my opinion, with sliced or shredded meat. There is a better blend of taco meat flavors out there... I will keep trying. Sorry.

My family and neighbors love this recipe. I am actually cooking it right now for a pot puck at my husbands command (military). There are a few things I change up, and only because I originally did not have the exact ingredients this called for, but I now make it at least twice a month for Taco Tuesday. Here's my substitutions: First! Let me just say, I NEVER ADD SALT. Its bad for your blood pressure. And this turns out just fine. Its the whole reason I don't purchase packaged seasonings. Second, a teaspoon of sugar will not make you diabetic, but it will enhance the flavors in this dish. Next, I use White Cooking Wine (to taste - at least 1/4 c), then about two table spoons of Balsamic Vinegar. Last, i top this delicious taco off with a sour cream sauce that has become synonymous with these Lime Chicken Tacos. The ingredients are as follows (combine all, chill and serve): 1 c sour cream. 1/2 bunch fresh spinach chopped, 1 tbsp Lemon. 1 lime juiced (or 3 tbsp/to taste), and a pinch of sugar (optional). This makes the taco in my opinion. Top with a fresh garden salsa and you have a crowd pleaser that is far from your traditional beef packet taco's. ENJOY!!

These were really good!  The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 is because of the instructions on the recipe.  The chicken really should be marinated over night, it'll add so much more flavor to the chicken AND the instructions say to cook the cubed chicken for 20 minutes..... that's WAY too long.  Those that know about cooking would know not to cook it for that long.  Never-the-less, I made the recipe as was written (except for the cooking time).  The marinade would be fantastic for a light fish as well.  Super good!

Made changes: This was great in the crock pot. Cooked  1.5 lbs. of chicken in the liquid (with increased red wine vinegar/lime juice to make about 1 cup) and added cayenne and cumin.  cooked on low about 6 hours, shredded chicken in juice, added cilantro and cooked sliced onions/bell pepper.  served with guacamole and green salsa.

I'm sorry to say I'm surprised at all the positive reviews. Typically, the crowd has it, but I did not enjoy the chicken in this recipe. There was far too much lime. I took the advice of other reviewers and used the crockpot and maybe that was the problem with the texture (it was super mushy after just 5 hours on low), but if I tried this recipe again, I would use much much less lime. Sorry for the bad review, I still love this site and all the reviewers!

I can't say enough about this great recipe...it was delicious! I did triple the sauce and marinaded the chicken in it for a few hours, which gave it a nice, full flavor with the wonderful tang of vinegar and lime. Served this on multigrain tortillas with the usual taco fixings and Pace tequila-lime salsa. Delicious! I will certainly be making this again, thank you for sharing this great recipe. :)

If I would have followed the original recipe to a "T" the chicken came out way too dry.  So I added some chicken broth and a tsp. of cumin for more flavor.  Then  it turned out delicious!  I also added some rice in  the tortillas too.  yummy!

This recipe always turns out great.  I have subsituted fresh chopped cilantro for the oregano and I have made it exactly as written...absolutely yummy!  When made as directed, it tastes almost Mediterranean; with the cilantro it tastes really Tex-Mex.  I have also served these tacos with a mango salsa recipe from this website and it was an outstanding pairing!

These were really good. Used a whole lime and 4-5 cloves of garlic. Omitted the oregano completely and glad I did. I think the oregano would have overpowered the lime/garlic taste. I also let it marinate for a couple of hours. Will definitely make these again.

I would have liked to marinate the chicken in the lime mixture, but I didn't have enough time. As it was, I ended up adding using the whole lime & some cayenne pepper to give it more flavor. Next time, I will definitely marinate the chicken for a few hours. And I didn't cube it, I sliced it into thin strips. Served with the Black Beans with Rice recipe from this site, tortilla chips with salsa, and some lime flavored Tostitoes for myself. If you can't tell, I love lime. A good and easy recipe. But again, marinate if you're expecting it to have a stronger lime flavor.

This chicken was delicious! Although I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I did stick to ideas I found here in the review section for the most part.

Super easy! I added all the ingredients to my slow cooker with only two changes; I subbed dried cilantro for the dried oregano, and added 1 Cup of veggie broth. I also added 3 green onions rather than two.

Cooked on High for 2 hours, then low for 2 hours. Took the chicken breasts out and shredded them with two forks, then added back to the slow cooker on warm for about 30 minutes. Awesome!

Only giving 4 stars because I think the recipe as is would be better in the slow cooker ;)

I added a teaspoon of cumin and a half teaspoon of chili powder to the spice mix for the chicken. I did not try this myself but the husband and kids said they were good. I served them with mexican rice and homemade refried beans.

These were pretty good!  I left the sugar out, subbed the oregano for cilantro, and added some cumin to the mix.  I felt like there should have been more of a lime taste.  Next time I think I'll marinate the chicken in the lime (and add more lime) and other seasonings for a bit before I cook the chicken.  All in all it was a good dish and we will be making this again!

The idea behind this recipe is fantastic, though a bit bland as written (I did follow the recipe to a T the first time I tried it).  I have never reviewed a recipe but really wanted to share my modifications that I believe make this recipe exceptional!

Firstly, I use about 4 lbs of chicken, cubed
Most importantly, I juice about 8 limes, to make between 1 1/2 - 2 cups of lime juice, strained. 
I then add 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 
Then I add 1 tsp cumin, the sugar (doubled), pepper (doubled) 1 tso GROUND oregano *has a completely different flavor than the flakes*, 1/4 tsp of onion and garlic powder.  
I mix all of this together and pour 3/4 of it over my chicken. Marinate for at least 30 minutes-hour.

Pour this mixture all into a large non-stick skilled and cook on high until the chicken begins to brown (will take awhile due to all the liquid).
Once it browns, I add the 2 green onions, salt and garlic. I cook this, while slowly adding more of the seasoned lime/vinegar mixture I saved, to add moisture.
Finished! I think this way has much more lime flavor and flavor over-all! Let me know if it works for you! Its my families favorite!

Like another who posted, I doubled the recipe but reduced the salt and threw all of it in a slow-cooker then covered with chicken broth. Cooked on low for 8 hours and when it was done, I shredded the chicken right in the pot. I served with pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese and lettuce. Yummy!

Absolutely easy and tasty.
I put my chicken in hard shells, replaced the oregano with cilantro and doubled it for 4 pieces of chicken. Perfect amount and it filled 12 taco shells. Super tasty will for sure be making again.

Awesome awesome!  We added more lime, and sweet onions instead of green onions.  Also, we cooked the chicken and onions together, for WAY less time than it called for.  Didn't want rubbery chicken!

Very tasty sauce for chicken tacos. I used chicken I'd cooked the day before and just heated it up in the sauce/marinade. Next time, I'll double it, just to get more flavor.

I had a lot of leftover chicken breast and needed something easy to make. I just mixed cilantro, juice from one lime, red wine vinegar, some salt, pepper, and a little sugar and through it all in the crock pot. The results were juicy and the smell yummy. Next time maybe I could add even more lime because I love lime flavor and you only tasted maybe a hint if any.

Quick, easy, tasty!  Suprisingly, Incredibly tasty.  Therefore, 5 STARS HERE!  I used lots of fresh cilantro instead of oregano too and ended up doubling my sauce.  I was looking for a chicken taco recipe, thought I'd end up roasting chile's, prepping and cooking all day.  Glad I spared myself.  I'm thinking this would make a great base for tequila lime chicken fettucine too.  Thank you and no wonder the reviews keep coming.  I'm going to try hard corn shell with this too.  I raved to my hubby for days.

These were great exactly as recipe is written; HOWEVER,here's a variation that tasted great: I used assorted pork chops, lemon juice(2 1/2 Tbs = juice of one lemon)and vidalia onion. Fried the chops 8 min each side on Med, then removed from pan.  Added all remaining ingredients in recipe in addition to about 2 cups chicken broth and simmered under tight lid for about total of 40 minutes until pork fell from bone. Shredded the pork and used in tacos - I liked it just as well - maybe you will too

This recipe is tasty and easy to tweak for personal preference.  I added oil to pan so chicken didn't stick, omitted the oregano, added 1 tsp. fresh chopped cilantro, an extra clove of garlic, used 1 whole lime, and reduced cooking time by 10 mins.  I also didn't have green onions so I used 1/4 cup chopped white onion.  I don't think marinating the chicken for additional time is necessary since the chicken absorbs the strong flavors of garlic and lime so easily.  Thanks for a keeper!

Okay, good thing I did a "Test Run" before the big Cinco De Mayo fiesta, as this was slotted to be the main dish.  These have serious potential.  Made exactly as written, only doubled the sauce (NEEDED) and added a splash or two of Tequila.  But, the lime flavor didn't really come out as much as I would like.  Next time, I'll nix the oregano and use cilantro, add A TON more lime juice and possibly TRIPLE the marinade / sauce. I'd also prefer more of a kick to these.  And, finally:  I think some good pico de gallo would be the best topping for these.  Will try again, only play with to suit my preferences.

Really good tacos. The chicken definitely did not take 20 minutes to cook initially...probably about 10.  The longer the chicken cooked after the sauce was in put the better it was.  I just kept it on a low simmer and covered it, and it stayed nice and moist until we were ready for dinner. The only change I made was to add the whole lime as I love lime flavor.  Delicious!

Wow - this was great! I cut the chicken up first, doubled the sauce and then let it marinate for a few hours - then saute'ed the chicken, removed, added the marinade and boiled for couple min to be safe, then re-added chicken with cilantro and green onions and simmered for a couple- yumm!! I think this is best when kept simple, just tortilla, chicken, shredded cheese, avocado and some hot sauce - does not need all the fixings unless you want them. BTW: my kids did not like all the "green stuff", next time I will take some chx out for them before adding the cilantro/onion - much easier than hand picking off chopped cilantro!! ugh  - Thanks!

You MUST cut cooking time.  Cubes were cooked through in less than 10min, so I added the flavorings and stirred for 5min.  Still kind of dry.  Good flavor, but it's lost once the chicken's in the tortilla.  I squirted extra lime over my serving.  Next time, I'll skip the tortillas and use the chicken pieces on top of a salad.

These were great, quick and easy!  For the taco fillings I used sour cream, salsa, cheddar cheese, cilantro, and fresh spinach.  I lightly fried my tortillas in canola oil.  These were soooo good!  I didn't have lime juice, only lemon, but I am eager to try the lime.  The only thing wrong with this recipe is the cooking time.  If you do as the recipe says, (cook the cubed chicken for 30 minutes) you'd have dry, tough chicken.  Can't wait to make this again!*** Made this again using lime juice, and it's very good!  I cut down on the salt a little, and enjoyed it even more.

I have made this several times now. DO NOT USE OREGANO! I cannot say that too forcefully. Use cilantro. Cilantro is perfect to compliment the lime, while oregano would clash. Double the ammount of dried oregano with fresh cilantro. I also grilled the chicken on a george forman grill, instead of simmering it in its own juices. I let it marinade for about 5 hours in the lime mixture, and then broke up the chicken breast after they were done grilling in a bowl. Was very popular, altho time consuming recipe.

Yuck!  I feel terrible giving such a bad review, especially since so many people gave a good rating.  However, I did not like this.  The only savior for our dinner was the guacamole and corn chips I served on the side.  I threw o/ut most of the chicken mixture.  It was to tart and somehow the oregano seemed out of place...it didn't compliment the taste in the least.  My husband, who loves Mexican, ate his portion, but said it was just "ok."  This recipe isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  The two star rating was for the extremly easy preparation and clean up.  Thank God, because if it took more effort, I would have also been upset (in addition to being dissapointed).  Sorry Marissa for the bad rating, but I would NOT make this again.

This was fantastic! I marinated the chicken for a few hours, then after cooking it I shredded it. I then discarded the old sauce and made a fresh batch and cooked it for a few more minutes. I omitted the oregano as per the other reviews. I ended up using 2 limes instead of half of one because I just love limes! And also we used salsa verde instead of regular tomato salsa. The tomatillo taste really complements this dish!

My husband was in seventh heaven with these tacos!  What a fantastic recipe!  The only change I made was omitting the oregano and adding cilantro instead.  I was debating about whether or not to use the entire lime rather than just half, but I stuck with half . . . and it tasted perfect!  This is definitely going in our recipe box!

I'm thinking I made these about a year or so ago, and I do remember they were very good.  I guess back then I was new to this site and didn't know how to write a review.  I gave some to a neighbor and she went wild over these tacos, so I'm going to give them another shot and hopefully have the same results as before.

We make the recipes AS IS and really enjoy it. It is anything but bland and I can't picture having more marinade/sauce without it being extremely tangy. This really isn't a recipe that NEEDS tweaking because it's delicious as is. We like it with the fresh salsa from this site and I also like it guacamole.

After reading most of the reviews, so many people said they thought oregano was a poor fit for this dish. The reason for that is that there are 2 types of oregano: Italian (regular) and Mexican. Generally, unless your oregano is labeled Mexican or you bought it at a Mexican store, it is not. The flavor is very different and would probably taste good here. That being said, cilantro and cumin would be equally good.

I simplified (again)! I had leftover roasted chicken and I just reheated it with the flavorings the recipe called for. The flavors were totally scrumptious! I added cilantro to the mix but didn't change much else.
My children adored this and put it on the same rating as my homemade nachos, which is a HUGE compliment around here. I would love to use the chicken filling for other things too sometime. Such as nachos or perhaps chicken enchilada, tossed with pasta... endless possibilities. Very versatile and It was THAT good! Make again? Mmmmhhhmmmm!

So easy and simple. I made a little extra sauce and added cilantro, omit oregano. I may marinate the chicken in some of the sauce next time. Really good!

i wasn't in love with this receipe.  The chicken did not have the taste that i was looking for.   If I ever make this again, I will definitely leave out the oregano, marinate the chicken (first) then grill it instead of sauteeing

Very ho-hum.  Lacked flavor.  Perhaps if the chicken was char-grilled it would be better. I was disappointed.

I sauteed the chicken for 20 minutes on medium heat... but my chicken ended up being hard, i think because i cut the pieces too little, and i used cilantro like others recommended, but i may have used too much. Even with my mistakes these were still good tacos, so i can only imagine how good they would have been if i made them correctly. I will definitely try this recipe again.

I cut everything in half because I only cook for myself. I mixed everything and let it sit in the fridge for about 2-3hrs. This recipe has potential but like what most people mentioned it does need more of a kick. Next time I will double the sauce and let it sit overnight even. This is a very healthy recipe but needs more flavor.

I also boiled the chicken and shreaded it.  I used cilantro instead of oregano and doubled the liquid.   Next time I would omit the sugar as it was a little too sweet.

I used this recipe to give flavor to some chicken I wanted to use in chicken fajitas. I had already baked the chicken, so I just mixed all the ingredients for the sauce in a saute pan, added the chicken (cut into small slices), and let it simmer for about 15 minutes. The flavor is fantastic!

Found the review of marinading the chicken helpful. Threw in about 2 tablespoons of tequila also while cooking it. Like most, disregard oregano, add cilantro, advocado/guacamole, and serve with sour cream, rice, and refried beans with ortega chilies cooked in.

Another disappointing lime chicken from here. 2 stars because my husband was the only one who liked this and wouldn't mind eating it again. I think I will go back to basics and use latin spices.

They were just ok. There was not enough "sauce" for the amount of chicken that the recipe called for. All in all..sort of bland.

This was alright. I think it needed more lime juice and less oregano. I think next time I will add cilantro and use less red wine vinegar or no sugar. I will try it again with some  changes. We added slices of avocados as well.

Delicious! I kept the ingredients the same (expect the oregano) but cooked it differently. I first browned bone in, skin on thighs in a pan with salt and pepper then transfered them to the crock pot and poured sauce over them. I did 5lbs of chicken so I quadrupled the ingredients (those of you with boys know why). 4 hours later I removed the skin and bones and shredded the chicken. This was a make ahead meal so when it was time to eat I put it in a pyrex 9x11 and baked to get a little browning on top. served with Baja sauce as another reviewer suggested (mayo,sour cream, lime juice, zest) which I think put them over the top, shredded cabbage and fresh cilantro. They were devoured! For a side dish I prepared the cilantro lime rice from this site. Sorry boys, there is only enough for a small snack left.

Used cilantro instead of oregano and used leftover broiled chicken (that had a balsamic marinade). Sliced the chicken very thin and sauteed it with the sauce. We LOVED it! Will double or triple the sauce next time. Needs more moisture for the soft tortillas.

Excellent starter recipe!  I added sauteed red onions to the chicken which gave it a nice subtle crunch and added flavor.  Used cilantro instead of oregano - just seemed weird with oregano.  Topped with pepper jack and served in "lettuce cups" instead of tortillas.  This was a big hit with my family!

We just had these for dinner.  OMG - the best!  As others suggested, I did substitute cilantro for the oregano and added a bit moroe lime.  Reminded me of a jeep safari in Cozumel on the beach, where 'tacos' were served.  A close second to that!

We have had this for dinner weekly and sometimes twice a week since discovering the recipe... served to guests too!  The flavors just work together.  It's that simple.  And it's perfect especially for busy weeknights.  Serve Chipotle style with cilantro-lime rice, black beans, queso dip, guac, etc. to fancy it up a bit.  Really good!!

I started making this recipe as written, but I found it to be too bland for my tastes so I improvised a little. To begin with, I used shredded chicken instead of cubed but I added more lime juice (one and a half limes), a jalapeno pepper and cumin to give it some more spice. I also charred some cherry tomatoes in a separate pan and added those as well. With these changes, it turned out much better than what I had originally made. The recipe was a good starting off point though!

Lime Chicken Taco Haiku: "I feel so lonely. I didn't like these that much. How can I fix this?" After reading all the reviews and salivating at the rad photos, I had high hopes for these tacos. Per another review, I doubled the sauce, marinating the cubed chicken in 1/2, and reserving the rest for simmering. (B/c I can't bring myself to drop plain, anemic chicken in a saucepan - gotta give it some pre-cooking flava.) The only other difference that I did was using hard taco shells rather than tortillas, but c'mon folks, that wouldn't make a difference to what should've been a tangy, lime-ey fiesta taste, which, for some reason, I thought was lacking. I served the tacos alongside some zucchini, onions, and bell peppers that I sauteed in "Taco Seasoning I" from AR, and scooping that into the taco shells, along w/ tomatoes, cheese, lettuce and salsa seemed to give me the Mexi-flavor-boost that I was craving.

These were pretty good. Simple and tasty. I liked the tang the lime and vinegar gave it. I added a bit of chicken broth at the end because I wanted a little more 'juice'. I also used cilantro instead of oregano. Overall, easy and good.

Delish!! after giving the vinegar/lime mixture a taste test i was afraid this might be too strong but it was soooo good! I boiled chicken and shredded it then simmered the chicken in the sauce like the instructions say. I also found the BEST topping! search for Black Bean and Corn Salsa II IT IS AMAZING! Goes great as a topper for the tacos. very fresh! Also did a side of spanish rice. Easy to make for a small get together... always great to just put food out and let people customize it their way.

It's not bad but I find the lime flavour gets lost in the other flavours in the tortillas.   Also I had a bit too much liquid.  I'd make it again maybe once every four times I make tortillas.

Love this recipe just the way it is, but it's easy to adjust to your own tastes... we really like to add cilantro (instead of oregano) before simmering.  Just don't leave out the lime!  Yum!

Original recipe was bland... i really had to add a lot of spices like cumin, chili, onion, and garlic powders to make this better.... Not the best chicken taco recipe... I might make a version of this in the future, but not the original.

This was a nice change from my normal marinade.  I shredded the chicken, and used cilantro instead of oregano for the mexican flavor.  It usually only takes about 10-12 min when i cook chicken on the stove, 20 seemed excessive.  Next time, i would double the marinade for a little more flavor.

wow! this is a great recipe! i was a bit concerned about the red wine vinegar as well, but it really adds a nice touch!   i altered the process somewhat - i cooked all of the ingredients together with the chicken, which i think really helped to intensify the flavour. also, i used garlic salt instead of regular salt and cayenne pepper instead of black. so really, i give it 5 stars with my alterations, but i honestly think it would have been just as good without the minor substitutions. i would recommend cooking the chicken with all of the other ingredients though. happy cooking!

Loved this recipe. Really nice for a change of taste. The only thing I might do differently next time is replace the oregano with cilantro, but that is a matter of taste. Thanks for adding a new favorite to our rotation!

Yum!!! I used fresh cilantro in place of the oregano...added about 2 Tbsp of it at the end of cooking. I also added about 2 tsp or so of cumin. I thought it gave it a great smoky taste. Will definitely make again!

Excellent, excellent, excellent! The flavor of the chicken was really great. I did use about two tablespoons of chopped, fresh cilantro instead of the oregano, and it gave it a really nice fresh zing to it. :) Next time, I may double or even triple the marinade/sauce because it was so good! Loved it, and will DEFINITELY make it again.

really good, but not 10 servings. i doubled the chicken and sauce, and served 4. we didn't make pigs of ourselves either...it tasted bland at first, but i did increase the lime and vinegar just a bit and added some cayenne. also didn't have oregano, so i used thyme. when made into tacos with avocado, tomato, cheese and plain yogurt it was really really good! compliments all around.

These were very good with some lettuce and cheese to cut down on the sour combination of vinegar and lime juice.  A tasty recipe and a nice change from regular tacos.

Yum!  I didn't follow the instructions 100%, instead I marinated in the lime, sugar, vinegar mixture with some fresh cilantro.  Then I followed the recipe when it was time to cook (discarding the marinade and making fresh sauce).  I subbed more cilantro for the oregano.  Served in warm tortillas with guac, monterey jack, sour cream and fresh salsa.  Mexi rice and black beans on the side.  Two of my boys at three tacos!  So fresh and delicious.  Will definintely make again soon. Such a nice break from heavy ground beef tacos.  :-)

I see there are a ton of reviews on this recipe and with good cause.  I tried it last night and it was delicious!  Like a lot of other reviewers, I substituted cilantro for the oregano listed, doubled the lime juice, and marinated the chicken in the lime, cilantro, vinegar mixture for about 3 hours.  I fried some red peppers and red onions, put that on the side and then cooked the chicken in some extra lime juice. With soft corn tacos, mashed avocado, and pepper jack cheese, these were supurb!

Seriously, for TEN tacos you're going to use 1/4 cup shredded lettuce, 1/4 shredded monterey jack cheese and 1/4 cup salsa??  Not in my kitchen!  Methinks these are typos? I made this recipe last night and felt that the chix mixture was a little bland, so added a little cumin and red pepper flakes for some zest.  I used slightly larger flour tortillas and warmed them in a heavy skillet.  I also added some mashed avocado and homemade pico de gallo... and with my changes, this were PERFECT!!  Thanks for the basis to get started!  It was a GREAT DINNER!

I really like this. We made it exactly as the recipe stated, but I used whole wheat tortillas instead of regular flour. It definitely affects the flavor outcome, but it was very good! Even my husband who doesn't really like chicken thought it was good. Thanks for the recipe!

I've got to be honest...based on the reviews I expected a lot more. I followed the recipe exactly as posted, but substituted cilantro for the oregano as recommended by many other reviewers. I found these a little bland. And whatever you do...DO NOT saute the chicken for 20 mins before adding the other ingredients, it will dry out. Not sure what I'd do differently next time to improve it. Possibly do the chicken in the crockpot, then shred the meat. Not a bad recipe, but could definitely use some modifying.

I was really excited about this recipe, but was disappointed...the chicken was pretty bland. I was hoping it was going to be very lime-y, but no deal. Oh well.

Good and easy meal. I added tequila, cilantro (instead of basil) and bottled lime juice, as other cooks did, and cooked everything together. It was yummy!

I'll definitely keep this recipe -- it was a nice change from the regular cumin flavor of tacos.  I also omitted the oregano and added fresh cilantro, which was what made the dish for me.  I served with all the fixins, and sauteed mushrooms, onions, and spinach on the side.  My boyfriend really enjoyed them and went back for seconds.  Note: the 20 minute initial cook time for browning the chicken is wayy too long.

This was really good. It was surprising how much the lime and garlic flavor got infused into the chicken. We really enjoyed this recipe. I added a bit more garlic and a used double the limes.  When I was preparing the tacos I added some avocado as well. Very tasty.

I've made this twice now.  First time I just used leftover chicken from one of those horrible grocery store roasted chickens.  It was still good, but the amount of salt that the grocery store adds to those things is too much for my liking.  Once in awhile I get a craving for those things.  :D

Second time I just threw some chicken breasts into a slow cooker and poured the sauce on top, cooking it on low for about 5 hours.  I also cheated and used lime juice.

Each time I added fresh cilantro and only used a tiny pinch of dried oregano.  I also used a fairly hot salsa.  If I was not using this, I'd think it might be appropriate to add a chopped serrano pepper to increase the bite.  I'll probably try that next time.

All in all, this is a really nice recipe as is.

Wonderful subtle flavor and amazing aroma while cooking. This was a nice surprise after reading some of the reviews. Some felt it had little or no flavor... we just had it for dinner tonight and thought it was wonderful. I marinated the chicken for about an hour ( you could go longer and maybe kick up the flavor a bit) I added a splash of tequila to the marinade and a pinch of tequila salt. I also added just a bit of cumin as well. I then cut up some green pepper and yellow onion into strips and sautéd them separately. I cooked the chicken and added the rest of the marinade and the onions and green peppers about ten minutes before the chicken was done. This freshened the flavor and helped to impart some flavor to the peppers and onions. Continued to cook till liquid was gone and then added one more splash of tequila to help remove the tasty browned bits. Served it more fajita style with a tequila lime salsa, tomatoes, lettuce, onion and sour cream. Hubby and I really liked these.. he wants to try grilling them!

SO good. Love the tanginess. I added a bit more red wine vinegar than the recipe called for, and matched with the lime juice -yes, I like sour things-. Served them with some shredded fried tortilla pieces, and got star reviews all around! This is a great summer recipe, and will definitely have a place on our table at our family's annual pool party. Thanks for posting Marissa.

These were every bit as good as people said.  I did end up throwing my chicken in the crock pot and cooked on low for roughly 4 hours, then I shredded it and put it back in the crock to cook for another hour or so, adding a hefty couple of splashes of tequila at that time along with a fair amount of dried cilantro.  When the chicken initially went into the crock, I threw in a can of Rotel tomatoes with the green chile peppers and a splash of chicken stock that I had leftover.  Wanted to make sure there was enough "juice" for the chicken to cook in (I also doubled the lime and vinegar amounts).  Very good, thanks!

They are pretty good. I used one chicken breast for 4 small tacos I added some jalepenos for some spice and salt. I would definitely make it again. It's a really simple recipe and quick to make!

I subsituted the oregano with cilantro as many suggested and cooked the chicken about 15 minutes before adding the mixture and then 10. My husband loved this so much he asked me to make it the next day so we could have some on hand!

This is the best chicken soft taco I have ever had.  I did make it easier on my self.  I bought fresh chicken tenders, chopped them into little pieces, put them in a large ziplock baggie; added 1 teaspoon each of cumin, oregano, chilie powder, salt, pepper and a li'l bit of olive oil.  Let stand for about 30 min.  Then followed the directions from there.

The more lime you use, the better. I ended up putting the juice from 2 limes in this recipe and I had nothing left. Everyone was asking for more.

Very yummy!  I added a little more lime juice and forgot the sugar (oops).  My fiance loved it!  Next time I will make sure to add the sugar, I think the sauce will definately be better with it.

TERRIFIC!!!!!! I used cilantro in place of the oregano and I think it made it all the better.  This is a wonderful, tasty recipe.

This was so fresh, colorful, and delicious. Not to mention healthy and low in fat and calories, and did I say delicious? What more could you ask for in a recipe? I love mexican food, and being in NJ I don't find good mexican food or spices easily, so this recipe hit the spot! I added extra lime, two bunches of green onion rather than two single ones, and extra garlic. Make sure you use corn tortillas, flour don't do justice the flavours. My husband loved it, and my daughter did also. There was only one problem: I ran out! So next time i'll make more. Wonderful!

This recipe was really great.  You can really taste the lime, which makes this a tasty dish!  When I make a recipe like this which calls for cubed chicken, I don't thaw the chicken all the way, so it is still a bit frozen and that way is much easier to cube.

This recipe was Very tasty!! I will be making this
often. The only thing that I will change is the serving size, instead of 4 I will be making the serving for 6, One of those meals where you have enough but was so tasty you could of went for another one.

I have lived in California all my life and grew up on tacos, but these are the best I've ever eaten!  I sauteed the garlic with the chilken breast, left the green onion raw and when I served them added avocado and sour cream.  The marinade/sauce *makes* these tacos.  My husband and all four of my children (age eight down to 14 months) loved them, too.  They will be a permanent part of my repertoire!

My husband says this is a KEEPER!!  I followed others advice and doubled the red wine vinegar, used a whole lime, and a 1/4 cup chopped cilantro.  I cut the chicken into strips and marinated it in the vinegar mixture.  I also cut the cooking time down to 15 minutes all together.  I served it with all the dressings in the tortilla along with Spanish rice and refried beans.  It was great!!

We've made this twice; both times without the oregano.  Once with half the amount of chicken and once with the correct amount of chicken.  The flavor was stronger, of course, with the lesser amount of chicken, really good and spicy.  If you want less spice, use the correct amount of chicken.  This recipe was totally raved on by my husband and the couple I cooked this for.  Make this recipe!  You won't be sorry!

This chicken was so tender and flavorful, it just looks different with all the spices you can see on the chicken itself.  We had a lot of leftovers after our tacos that night and we had the leftovers for lunch on a salad.  Very good!

This was very, very good.  I made a few adjustments however by adding a little tequila while cooking, using corn tortillas, and adding 1 diced serrano pepper for spice.

This has become a staple recipe in our house-- we love it!  My husband used basil once (by accident) instead of oregano and we like it better that way-- the oregano makes it a bit too italian tasting.  Thanks so much for this recipe-- a real winner!!

I made the lime juice mixture ahead of time and then used it to marinate the chicken overnight in the freezer. It was very tasty and tender done that way. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used a few canned diced tomatoes mixed in when I finished off the cooking of the chicken. My husband loved it!

Maybe I've been buying gross chicken lately or maybe I bought a bad lime or maybe I used too-few green onions, but I found these to be really bland.  If anyone has any input on how to make these better, I'd appreciate it because the recipe sounds so good!  Is it two green onions or two bunches of green onions?  I ended up using the whole lime, adding more vinegar, some onion powder, extra garlic AND some garlic salt and it still didn't "bite back"--they were very, very mild.  Maybe I'll try it again if I'm in a pinch.

This recipe is so good and so easy.  I make it a lot.  I usually make it with Mexican rice as a side dish.  Also goes well with a recipe on this site called "Corn Salad II."  I made this for relatives and had a lot of chicken left over so for supper the next night I reheated the chicken and added white wine, cream, and romano cheese.  I served it over pasta and it was phenomenal.  My new favorite dish.

So quick (but tasty)it feels like cheating to call it a "recipe".  I used the pre-cooked, diced chicken tenderloins you can buy at the store.  That eliminates half of step one.  The spiciness is based more on the salsa you select not on the other ingredients added to the chicken.

These were EXCELLENT!  My husband raved about them.  The only changes I made were that I initially cooked the chicken for only 10 minutes instead of the 20 in the recipe (20 seemed too long) and I used the juice of a whole lime because I love lime.  Also, I just warmed the soft tortillas in the microwave to save time.  It was delicious.  I'll be making these A LOT!!!

This was sooo good.  For quite some time now, I really haven't been into tacos because the seasoning.  Not sure why, but the thought of the packet seasoning is just very unappealing.  Tried making my own and it was ok, but nothing great.  This was the hit.  It had a little zing and just tasted "fresh".  I had 2 large chicken breasts that I boiled for about 10 minutes because I wanted to shred the chicken.  10 minutes was a little too long.  I wanted them underdone, but they were pretty much cooked all the way.  I followed the recipe exactly and only subbed in cilantro for the oregano.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is a good way to prepare tacos faster. I usually marinated meats more than 1hrs but I don't have to do that for this recipe. I put some fresh cilantro instead of dried oregano and it worked. Thank you for the great recipe.

Tried this the other day during a snow day from school. It was delicious.  I added more fresh squeezed lime juice then called for. Added some avacodo. R then rolled it up like a burrito. Highly recommended.

This was really tasty as written.  My husband and I like very spicy food, so after tasting it, I added some heat...but it was great as is. The vinegar gives the chicken a nice tang.

Used 1T fresh chopped cilantro, no oregano. Put everything in crockpot on high 2 hrs then low 2 hrs. DELICIOUS!!! This was enough sauce/seasoning for 1 lb chicken, but next time I may double just bc I liked it so much. Maybe it would even make the flavor stronger? Awesome alternative to the traditional taco packet sessoning. Very fresh!

This recipe has good flavor.  I used corn tortillas instead of flower and added hot pico de gallo for some kick!  All in all a good recipe I'd make again:-)

Made recipe exactly as directed and it was one of those recipes that took tacos to a whole new level. I didn't think the oregano made it Italian tasting as many other reviewers had said, but next time I make it I plan to make one batch with the oregano and a second batch subbing cilantro. I'm sure both will be amazing. 

This recipe is simple and tastes so fresh I would swear I was at a taco shop on the west coast.  I will never ever use packaged seasoning for chicken tacos ever again.

One thing to note as others have mentioned, the recipe as is does not make a lot. If you want to feed 4 or more people or have left overs double this recipe.

We really liked the tangy taste. It's our new go to taco recipe. I did use cilantro instead of oregano.

Easy to make and tasted very good.  Could probably increase the garlic and the green onions to take the flavor up a notch.  Served it to my kids and they ate it up!

I made this last nite, tripled the sauce to use some as a marinade for the chicken, I did leave out the oregano but put in fresh cilantro, actually made fajitas with the chicken and fresh red and green peppers from the garden, a little mexican cheese on top with some salsa verde it was great , will make this again

There are so many ways to fix this dish...from slow cooker to using up roasted chicken. It's the delicious mixture of seasonings that makes it so tasty!! It's easy to make any way you cook it. Thanks for sharing!

I added a couple of Serrano peppers and a dash of chili powder to give it a little zip and it was a big hit.

So I tripled the "sauce" and poured it over the chicken in the crock pot, and shredded it when done!! So good!! I served it with the Mexican corn recipe on top with salsa and it's amazing!!! Definitely recommend!!!

Rather than cube the chicken I chunked it in various sized pieces.  Marinated it in 1/3 of the marinade.  Cooked the chicken, added the marinade and instead of soft taco's I made two large open-faced quesadilla's and melted the cheese on top, than topped with lettuce and tomato and avocado!  Awesome!

Took others advice and subbed cilantro for the oregano.  Doubled the marinade (not as much sugar though).  Perfect spring dinner!  Loved this!

I had a leftover chicken breast so I skipped the saute step, cubed it, tossed it in the mixture and grilled it in a foil pack to heat through. The marinade simply coated the chicken and I wasn't sure how one simmers without liquid. I never have liquid left in the skillet after cooking chicken so I can't say it's because I used leftover chicken.  It turn out good and had a nice flavor. Instead of lettuce I served cabbage pico de gallo with it.

The whole family loved it.  No leftovers.  I did double the sauce as many reviewers suggested.  Some suggested cilantro and no oregano, but I stuck with oregano and they loved it.  I put sour cream on my tacos.  Very good.  for a family of 4, I will actually make more next time around.

The chicken was delicious. After the first taco, we ended up just eating the chicken plain right out of the serving dish.

This recipe wasn't nearly as flavorful as I would have liked. The amount of reduction that they recommended adding didn't seem sufficient. I would try adding twice as much next time and also would add more lime.

I have made this recipe for my family and for guests and it is always a huge hit! I make the following modifications: use 1 whole lime instead of a half, 1 tsp salt, and put all ingredients in the crock pot and shred chicken when cooked. Love this recipe!

It was very good.. I cooked and shredded the chicken and then let it simmer in the sauce (which I doubled).. I also made up a Baja Sour Cream sauce that someone also recommened to put on the tacos.. It was nice to have something different then normal tacos..

Nice change from the beef tacos! I surprised by the taste...it all came together in the end, just couldn't see how these ingred. would go together, but they did.  The Monterey Jack cheese was the perfect cheese for this!  This is a keeper!

As written, it was just ok.  Very bland.  I ended up having to doctor it a lot.  I ended up adding some taco seasoning and A LOT more lime juice.  It still wasn't enough so I added some honey, cumin and a little bit of cayenne.  They ended up being really yummy, but not because of the original recipe.  Too bad, because I really wanted to have a quick and easy taco recipe that wasn't the same old taco, but it ended up being just blah as written.  I'd make them again, but only with the changes I made. As a side note, I made the "Cilantro Serrano Cream Sauce" on here to serve with the tacos, and that definitely helped too.

I made this according to directions, except I used lemon b/c I was out of lime... maybe that's why I didn't "love" it, and maybe I also used too much.  Oh, I also boiled and shredded the chicken, then let it simmer.  It is much better served cold the next day.  I will try to make this again though b/c my fiance loved it.

I had seen this recipe recommended quite a few times and was really expecting to be wowed. I don't get all of the ingredients in this, yet it is kind of bland. Also, even though I cooked the chicken a little less than suggested it was still super dry. This was just missing something. I followed the recipe otherwise exactly.

I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.  It's an interesting but good mixture of flavors - citrusy and tangy.  Per other reviews (and my own tastes) I used the juice of 1 whole lime, used a whole yellow onion instead of green onion, and omitted the oregano.  I added a pinch of cayenne for heat.  A quick and tasty dinner - thanks!

This is SOOO GOOD! I changed a few things. First I used cilantro instead of oregano, the more the better in my opinion. I used multigrain tortillas and queso fresco instead of monterey jack. I serve with black beans (drain and rinse a can of black beans, cut up a jalapeno and some onion, put beans, onion, and jalapeno into a pot with some water and cook to preferred consistency) Also fresh salsa (get large house tomato and jalapeno cook on stove top with a little oil to loosen up skin, take off skin, throw in blender, add some salt, blend away, pour into pot and cook for a bit) super easy once you get it down. My hubby is from mexico and loved my fancy rendition of tacos :)

My husband says: "if i could rate this any higher I would...and from now on if it's "TACO NIGHT" it's definitely has to be this recipe" lol.....It was better than expected...I wasn't thinking that the mixture of the seasoning was going to be "great"...but it turned out nicely...I took the suggestions below adding cilantro...but i kept the oregano...and i also added a few toppings "chopped onion, cilantro, and jalapeño" and I marinated the chicken in the seasonings before saute-ing it....and then added extra lime juice and olive oil as well...(and a touch of cumin and cayenne pepper...we like it hot and spicy!) 

very delicious...my husband thoroughly enjoyed it...I will be making this one again!

This was very easy, but I wasn't crazy about the flavor. There was way too much pepper for my liking, but my husband really liked it. I substituted chile lime seasoning for the 1/2 lime and dried oregano. Next time I'll cut down the pepper by half and increase the chile lime seasoning. It took nowhere near 20 minutes to cook the diced chicken and I wouldn't recommend cooking it that long on med hi heat otherwise it will be very overcooked. It only took me about 7 min to initially cook the chicken until it was no longer pink and then I lowered heat and let simmer for another 5 min so the marinade would cook in. Very healthy and quick to whip up, though.

This was very tasty. I added some cilantro to the chicken. I also made some pico de gallo (just cut tomatoes, onion, and jalapeno and mix in a bowl with a little cumin and generous splash of lime juice). Also used queso fresco instead of the jack cheese. Very very tasty!

Was very easy and fast to prepare then what was suggested on total prep time.  I went with what everyone else was babbling on about not using oregano and used cumin, worked out very well thanks.  I was kinda unsure about sugar tho...

This was a real hit with most members of the family. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted 1Tbsp balsamic vinegar and 1 Tbsp Seasoned rice vinegar, added juice of whole lime after zesting the rind and added that too.  Nice lime taste! Instead of sugar I substituted same amount with Mirin.  I used cumin instead of oregano, corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas and added chopped fresh cilantro.  Very tasty and quick to prepare. I only had 2 chicken breasts which would make 4 feed only 4 people.

I loved this recipe! It's so different from the usual tacos we make. I might have added more lime juice. I'm not sure why some reviewers thought it was bland. It turned out very tangy for us. I didn't pack on the Mexican condiments like I usually do. Just a little sour cream, pico de gallo and a few shreds of lettuce.

YUM!  My daughter asks for these all the time.  I used the slow cooker like a few others suggested, and also cut back a little on the green onions.  And I ALWAYS increase the amount of lime juice for extra flavor.

Yum!  Omitted the oregano for a good palmful of chopped fresh cilantro and added a splash of tequila.  I also let the chicken marinade in the mixture for a few hours and then sauteed it up.  I did find I had to almost triple the sauce.  Husband loved it.  Felt healthy eating it, which is always a bonus.  This chicken would be great in quesadillas, too!

I followed the recipe exactly the first time, I left out the Oregano and sugar the second time and used shredded Chihuahua cheese since that's what I had on hand and I liked that version much better.  The oregano doesn't really seem to fit in - Cilantro works much better.  I also prefer using a slow cooker for the chicken and after cooking for 6-7 hours the chicken shreds easily.  The tacos turned out great!

I loved these tacos!  I finally rated this recipe because I've used it multiple times and it's been great every time.  The oregano gives the chicken an interesting flavor that I was skeptical about, but worry not!

These were good and not difficult to make. They could have used some additional spice, according to my older daughter. Served with shredded lettuce, cheese, sour cream, salsa, toatoes and avocado for toppings and spicy roasted potatoes from this site for a side dish. Thanks!

Followed recipe exactly and found it to be very boring and almost too sweet.  There was absolutely no lime flavor whatsoever.  Will not make again, sorry.

Very good! I do think cilantro would be better than oregano. I used white corn tortillas and I think that makes it better. I also added a can of corn. I also spiced it up a bit with some ground red pepper, cumin and paprika.

The ingredients may sound strange (vinegar,oregano, sugar?) but the dish is very tasty. I prepared as written in saucepan, then transferred to a disposable aluminum pan and finished outside on the grill while other food was cooking. Be careful not to overcook or chicken will be dry.  I will make this again often!

This was PERFECT! My family loved these tacos and that is seriously not normal. The chicken was very soft and had great taste. I did omit the onions because I didn't have any in the house but threw in 1/2 tspn of ground cumin and they were amazing!! I also cooked the chicken w/ a splash of olive oil as well. Thank you for posting, this will stay in my recipe box forever.

Was a little disappointed that this didn't have more lime flavor.  I think it needs more lime juiceand maybe a bit more red wine vinegar if I make it again.

Was intimidated by all the people's differing opinions, but I took some of their advice. Turned out better then expected. Didn't have red wine vinegar, used a splash of regular vinegar instead. Marinated the chicken in the sauce for about 30 minutes, then added new batch of marinade while cooking. Used Cilantro instead of oregano. Only had hard taco shells but the chicken was BUENOOOOO.

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe with the vinegar and oregano, but was pleasantly surprised. I made it just like the recipe instructed, although I was concerned about not marinating or seasoning the the chicken first. I cooked the chicken in a little bit of olive oil and then added the rest of the ingredients. It turned out pretty good! I'm not the biggest fan of oregano, so I only used 1/2 tsp. I served it in yellow corn soft tortillas and it was a great dinner.

Ok, I normally don't like when other peole do this.  I usually try a recipe exactly as stated first so I can rate it accurately.  However, I didn't this time.  It was so good, though that I wanted to rate it anyway.  I threw it in the crock  pot instead of pan, replaced green onion with green chilies and shredded instead of cubed.  Minor changes, it came out so good!!  Everyone loved it.  With a family of 6 it is hard to find something healthy that everyone likes.....this was one of those rare meals.  It was great!!!

This was a hit! :) I made it even simpler by buying a rotisserie chicken when I was at Costco and shredding it. I used more of the seasonings than called for as the entire chicken went into the pan; for instance, I used 2 limes. I also chose to use cumin instead of oregano and shredded sweet onion instead of green. The flavor was mild but Delicious and I will Definitely be making this again.
I served it with homemade salsa and guacamole and used cabbage instead of lettuce as it's more traditional and nutritional. Quickly warmed the tortillas Directly on the stove burners as I love the flavor it adds. Had both flour and corn tortillas on hand, tried one of each and found I liked the corn better. Good Stuff...thanks Marissa!! :)

This was easy to prepare and we loved it. I used boneless chicken breasts still mostly frozen, the entire lime, added a hefty pinch of cayenne pepper, tossed everything in a deep pot and put the lid on and simmered this for several hours and it simply fell apart and was no work whatsoever. I served this on flour tortillas with sour cream, shredded lettuce, and a blend of mexican cheeses. A little salsa verde on mine at the table and this was a meal fit for company. YUM!

This recipe was delicious and so easy to make! I already had most of the ingredients in my kitchen, so this is the perfect everyday meal! I did use balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar (just because it was what I had at the time) and I think it added a nice touch. I took the advice of many other reviewers and used cilantro instead of oregano, adding it in just at the end. I also chopped up some green pepper and threw it into the pan with the lime juice, etc. Altogether this meal was delicious! I will definitely be making it again in the future!

Over. The. Top.  I combined all of the ingredients and marinated the chicken for 2 hours before cooking.  Wow!  Great recipe, I will make time and time again!

This was delicious! I added a bit more red wine vinegar and a bit more fresh lime juice. The whole family liked it and it was a nice change from regular old tacos! Thanks for the recipe!

Here's the few adjustments I made:  I boiled 2 chicken breasts and shredded them.  Then I added the vineagar, a whole lime juiced, half a yellow onion, minced garlic.  Then I added the chicken, salt, pepper, and the cilantro at the end.  The meat by itself was not good to me, but in a taco with cheese and salsa much better.  Next time I will cook the onion and garlic in some oil.  Then add chicken, maybe a tbsp of vinegar, lime, salt and pepper.  Also next time maybe some taco seasoning or cumin.

Great simple chicken with very bright flavors.  As others suggested, I tripled the sauce and did a quick 2 hour marinade.

I followed the recipe with a few changes. I added a splash of tequila like some reviewers suggested.  I add half of the marinade to the chicken and let it sit for 30 min. After cooking chicken, I added the rest of the marinade and a can of southwestern bean salad. I did not have soft tacos. Used hard shell instead. Turned out delicious.

This chicken is sooooo good!!  Don't be tempted to add cumin or chili powder-- that stuff is good, but then it's just the same old chicken taco.   I just put everything for the chicken in the crockpot and let it go for several hours.  Perfect!

Great flavor on the chicken!!  I do have to say that the 30 minutes total cook time for the chicken is way to long for chicken pieces that small!  I cooked mine for about 5 minutes then added in the vinegar, etc. and cooked the last 10 minutes.  Great recipe though!

Very good tacos!  I liked the subtle flavors.  Used seitan instead of chicken, 3/4 lime, subbed cilantro for the oregano, and served in hard taco shells with salsa.  The Monterey Jack cheese was a nice change from the Mexican blend we usually have with beef tacos. Served with black beans and Feta Stuffed Jalapenos.

Nice change to the "regular" chicken tacos with traditional taco seasoning.  It did give me a "beach" feel, refreshing.  Even my husband liked them, he is a huge traditional taco fan.  I will make these again.

This is a really great, easy recipe.  I took one reviewers idea and made the chicken in a crock pot.  I even used frozen chicken breasts!  Cooked low for 6 hours.  Perfect!  I used Mexican oregano which has a totally different taste from the Italian herb.  And added cilantro which made it perfect!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Oh and yes!  Do double the lime.

Even my husband liked this and he considers chicken to be a "vegetable"!  I only changed three things: yellow onion instead of green b/c that is what I had, per another reviewer I used beer instead on vinegar, and I added some chili powder.  This was a wonderful meal for what I had on hand.  Thanks!

Okay I am giving the original recipe 4 stars, but when I made it again and made a few changes, it became a 5 star recipe! Changes I made were 1- No oregano, used fresh cilantro instead 2- Doubled the lime juice 3- Sauted the garlic along with the chicken 4- Instead of monterey jack, I used grated cotija cheese which is delicious on tacos! 5- Not necessary but I fried my tortillas in vegetable oil and made hard shells instead of having them soft. The recipe is delicous both ways though.

We loved this. We had to use steak because our grocery was out of chicken. Yep, you heard that right...and for the 2nd day in a row. We changed just a couple of things: skipped the oregano and added about a 1/2 tsp. chili powder (really gave it a nice flavor). I think this would be good with just about any meat.

This is definitely one of my favorite recipes on this site.  It is such a refreshing change from the ordinary ground beef tacos. Here is what I do: 1. I cube my chicken, then put it in a tin and season it with adobe, black pepper, and a little bit of cumin.  2.  I usually tripe or quadruple the marinade since it is so amazing I like having a good amount to marinade the chicken along with some to put on the actual taco (it makes the chicken more juicy).  3.  I saute the chicken in a tiny bit of oil and garlic really fast just to give it that white color (not brown, you don't want to over do it). 4. Add all the marinade and bring it down to a simmer and cook for about 15-20 minutes.  To the marinade I add white onions along with the green onions, I add a little bit more lime juice (FRESH! not bottled) and I also add a little bit of cumin to the marinade.  This is honestly so delicious and refreshing !

Delicious soft taco.  I made the following changes: (1) Like many others, I omitted the oregano and used fresh cilantro instead (I'm pretty sure that the oregano referred to in the recipe is Mexican oregano, which has a very different flavor from Mediterranean oregano, which is what most of us are used to and have in our cupboards); (2) Instead of monterey jack cheese, I used crumbled cotija cheese (it crumbles very easily - you just slice it and it crumbles up immediately); (3) I added a dash of chili powder to the cooking chicken to add a little heat; (4) I increased the lime juice to 1 and 1/2 limes and also increased the quantity of garlic and green onions.  So satisfying.

Great recipe!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and boiled the chicken..then chopped it and sauteed it in the sauce until absorbed.  I did replace the oregeno with ground cumin b/c I think it makes more sense.  Once I made this recipe with lemon juice instead of lime b/c that's all I had, it was still great.  I have also added additional veggies to the saute...jalapeno, bell pepper, zucchinni...The chicken and seasoning are the core of the recipe and it's fantastic...there's so many ways to personalize this recipe.  It's a keeper!!

I threw the chicken, red onion, an anaheim chile, and the sauce (doubled the sauce) in the crock pot for a few hours, then shredded the chicken and added a can of black beans, heated it through and served it with fresh garden salsa on tortillas. I will definitely be making this again soon. Thanks!

This was so delicious!  I doubled the sauce because I felt just one batch of sauce did not add enough flavor. I also sautéed some jalapeños and added them to the sauce for a little heat.  YUMMY! We will be having this again really soon!

These are REALLY good.  I boiled my chicken first, then shredded and sauted with the remaining ingredients.  I used a little chopped yellow onion because I forgot the green onion and substituted fresh cilantro for the oregeno.  you MUST use cilantro in order to get the correct flavor.  Topped with cheese, tomatoes, home made salsa, fresh jalepenos and sour cream! Wonderful!!

I think I prefer a tequila lime marinade for the grill. Easier to prepare and make and FULL of flavor. This was a bit bland and red wine vinegar was overpowering.

Love this recipe.  I did change the oregano to cilantro and I usually double or triple the marinade so the chicken is extra juicy.  Fresh lime tastes way better than the bottled variety but it's still good.  Also, this recipe works good with leftover chicken, especially from the grill, chopped small and soaked in the marinade over low heat.

Wow, so good my kids asked me to go rate this! I cooked the chicken in a pressure cooker for speed, brought the 'sauce' to a boil while the chicken cooked, shredded the breasts, combined & served. I agreed with other reviewers that oregano isn't quite the right option, so used parsley (hubby has a dislike of Mexican parsley aka cilantro).  Leftovers went into kids' lunch bags the next day and the last bit was fought over after school.
Update!! I just learned there are two types of oregano! From an awesome catalog spice dealer: Mediterranean and Mexican oregano are two different plants, but because they are used in the same way and have a somewhat similar flavor they are both called oregano. Mexican oregano is stronger and less sweet, well-suited to the spicy, hot, cumin-flavored dishes of Mexico and Central America- perfect for chili and salsa. 
I ordered some of both.  :-)

This was delicious! I omitted the green onion and cooked mine in the crock pot as a few others did. I cooked it on low for five hours, shredded it and let it go an hour longer. I will definitely make this again!

Really good!  We chopped up the chicken and cooked it for a bit in the frying pan.  After 10 minutes, added the sauce.  Doubled the sauce recipe, ommited oregano(what were they thinking??)added cilantro and tequila.  We didn't put cheese in the soft taco's and instead used sour cream.  Very good, fully recommend it

These were excellent!! I love tangy and vinegary food and these really hit the spot. I also shredded the chicken. I didn't use oregano but, I did add cumin and chili powder. Because the recipe is so easy, I'll be making it alot. Thanks!

I followed the recipe to a T, it tasted just ok. I didn't think there was anything special to it. Two hours later when my daughter got home? Nearly rancid. I had to toss a whole lot of chicken out and was not pleased.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! The flavors that cook with the chicken really mix well. I had left over cooked chicken, so I mixed all of the other ingredients and let them simmer for about 10 minutes, then I threw in the chicken at the end to let it heat. This was such an easy way to use left over chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

I put everything in a crock pot and cooked on high, it was done in just over an hour.  I shredded chicken at the end to serve in tacos and it was so good!  I omitted the oregano as others noted, and added cumin.  Served with fresh cilantro, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, avocado and hot sauce of course!  This will become a regular meal in our house.

Very pleased with how this turned out.  I did make some of the modifications listed by others (Cilantro & Cumin rather than Oregano) plus I added a half a pepper and 1/2 TBS of Crushed Red Pepper.  It had a great aroma and the chicken was very juicy.  Tried both Hard Shell Corn Tortillas & Soft White Flour Tortillas and preferred the Hard Shell.

I loved this recipe. I recommend poaching and shredding the chicken - this allows the chicken to thoroughly absorb the flavor of the sauce. Also, I omitted the oregano and added crushed red pepper. Finally, I microwaved my tortilla shells. When eating the leftovers, I microwaved one shell topped with cheese and then filled the shell with the chicken mixture. Excellent!

I made this, as stated, and it was nothing impressive. The chicken was moist and worked fine for the tacos…hence the change from typical beef tacos. But it really lacked any spectacular flavor…and the oregano was not right for a Mexican dish. Will not make this again…

So easy and very tasty - I actually used the juice of a whole lime instead of half.  Served with diced avacado mixed with a little more lime juice and some fresh cilantro.  Very good - will make again!

This was pretty good! It was easy, and my family really liked it(getting my husband and 2 kids to all agree on a meal is a big deal). We used corn tortillas instead of flour which steam up nicely in the microwave. My only change would be to cut the chicken breast into smaller pieces. Oh, and I sauteed the chicken in a couple tablespoons of canola oil.

After reading a few of the other reviews I also added cilantro instead of the oregano. I also squeezed as much lime as possible out of two small limes. This is an amazing recipe and one that will become part of our rotation.

These were very good. I marinated the chicken in the liquid for about 20 minutes before cooking. I forgot to add the green onion but these were still very good.  My kids didn't care much for them though - so 4 vs 5 stars.  I used boneless, skinless chicken tighs so they were very moist.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used frozen chicken and placed it in my crock pot with all of the ingredients on high for 4 hours. I was worried that chicken would be dry but it was actually quite moist. I shredded the chicken and added cilantro and a little tequila to the recipe. I will be making this easy dish again :)

I also also used dried cilantro instead of oregano.  Also tripled the sauce to enhance the flavor.  Used White Wine Vineager instead or red since I didn't have any.  These were so easy and so good.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was pretty good.  The lime really added a great flavor to the chicken.  We also spiced the raw chicken with cumin, garlic salt and chili pepper before cooking for a little extra flavor.  We used the chicken on tostada shells with refried beans, cheese, lettuce, sour cream etc... and it was excellent!!

Who knew chicken taco's could taste this good! I marinate overnight and saute when dinner time comes around. Once I put it in a crockpot on low while I went to work and it turned out just fine.

This recipe has so much potential.   I used a small can of diced green chiles in place of the green onions and added 2 Tbsp. of tequila and a pinch of dried cilantro.  Muy bien!  Also, it does not take 20 minutes to "saute" the chicken.  It takes about 5 minutes.

The first time I made this I cooked the chicken for as long as the recipe said and it turned out quite dry. This time I cooked it until the pink was gone, then added the remaining ingredients and simmered for 10 minutes. We loved it - lots of flavor and not at all dry.

We LOVE this recipe!!!  These tacos taste just like the ones at our favorite local mexican grill.  I only gave it 4 stars because we thought these were best using white corn tortillas (doubled up to prevent from falling apart), cilantro, no tomatoes (they seemed to take away from the lime flavor), and the juice from about 2 limes in the liquied mixture.  I also BBQed the chicken before simmering in the lime mixture...this gave the chicken great flavor.  These tacos are amazing the next day as one other reviewer mentioned!

I made these a few nights ago and marinated the chicken in the lime juice and garlic a few hours before cooking.  Oh my...these are good.  My very picky bf loved these and requested them the next day as well (this never happens).  The next day I doubled the chicken so I would have leftovers and found that it reheats wonderfully and tastes even better the next day when all of the flavors were able to merge.  I actually doubled the amount of vinegar sauce and used white wine because that is all I had.  To heat the tortillas I simply wrapped them in two damp papertowels and heated them 45 sec. in the microwave.  If you like cilantro try these with Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce (which is great with everything).

Delicious and easy! I doubled the amount of fresh lime, and used cilantro instead of oregano.  I typically use chicken tenderloins and marinate overnight, which enhances the flavor, and you don't have to worry about the chicken falling out of the taco as you do when it's cubed.

These were really delicious and had such a unique flavor.  Hubby and I both agreed the recipe should go in the keeper file.  I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used a red wine vinaigrette and omitted the sugar.  Wonderful, thanks for the recipe Marissa!

I cannot express to you how much my family LOVES this recipe.  We have made it for quite some time now and have shared it with many of our friends.  The chicken mixture makes great quesadillas and we have also used it in taco salads.  Our favorite way, however, is just like the recipe says.  Try it, you will not regret it!

My three year old loved this and my husband thought it was good as well. I didn't care for it as much. I used the regular measurements for the sauce and half the chiken.  I used two Tbls of lime juice and this seemed a bit to sour for me. I will probably try this again and try to tweek it.

I followed the recipe exactly and found these tacos way too dry and lacking flavor. I even used extra lime, but tasted absolutely nothing. If I ever try to make them again, I will try doubling the sauce and marinating before hand.

This recipe was great!  My family absolutely loved it and I will definitely make again and again! I had some left over baked chicken already so I shreded that up and used it.  It brought a bit of a challenge in that it was quite dry so I added a bit more lime and some chicken stock to it and simmered that.  It ended up great.  I wondered if cilantro would be as good if not better than the oregeno.  I am so used to using cheddar cheese with tacos that I completely missed the call for jack cheese.  It was good but I will use jack next time.

I cut the recipe in hlaf & used a 13 oz can of chunk chicken. Although I did use the juice from a whole lime. I sauteed the chicken for a couple of minutes in a little olive oil & mesquite seasoning to add flavor & I used cilantro instead of oregano. Didn't have monterey jack cheese so I used a mild cheddar. I'm sure it would be better w/ the jack but it was fine w/ the cheddar. This was a good lunch ...thanks!

This is the best dish I have ever made! I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white wine vinegar instead. I juiced a whole lime and added some zest as suggested by other reviewers. I added coriander (cilantro) and hot sauce to spice it up. I mixed everything together and let the chicken marinade in it for a couple hours before cooking and I am so glad I did! There was just the right amount of sauce after cooking. I reccomend adding the Fresh Salsa I recipe from this website. I didn't add cheese as the flavour of the meat is so good without it!

This gets a 5 star ONLY with the modifications suggested by many other reviewers.  Definitely double the sauce.  I tripled the lime and garlic and added some cumin and the grated peel of one lime.  I marinated in the fridge for about 5 hours.  I removed the chicken, quickly cooked in a nonstick (it won't need anything to keep from sticking), boiled the sauce and put everything back together for the last 8-10 minutes.  I used chicken breasts cut in strips and they cooked very quickly.  I absolutely loved it this way.

Oh my gosh!!  This is the most fantastic recipe.  Such great flavor and simple preparation.  I added more 1 more green onion and the rest of the lime juice for extra zing. I also used Pepper Jack cheese instead of Monterey.  I don't think it makes 10 servings either though. Try this.  You won't be dissapointed.

YOWZA!!! These were wonderful...light but filling, and VERY flavorful! I followed the directions exactly, except I just used one large chicken breast (don't know how many pounds that was), and I think my tortillas were a little larger than 6 inches. Anyway, these were full of flavor. Like another reviewer, the lime flavor is not all that prominent, so if you want a TON of lime flavor, use more lime. I enjoyed these as is...no complaints here. Here's how I prepared my tortillas: Lay tortilla flat. Spread a line of salsa straight down the equator. Place hot chicken in a line over salsa. Then cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream, and roll it up. Just like heaven, ladies and gents! I was so pleased by these. I loaded mine up with chicken, so I only got two tortillas out of it (recipe says 10 servings...?). Terrific. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe. It is OUTSTANDING!

First, I rarely give 5 stars.  That said, it was very good but next time, I will drop the oregano and maybe add some cilantro and extra lime juice.  Add ceveche, chips, and a margarita and it's like you are in Mexico.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very worth making!  I sauteed in olive oil- the garlic, sweet vidalia onion(didn't have green onion), and fresh cilantro(as others suggested)-I let those flavors cook out for a bit then added the chicken and sauteed for five minutes or so on each side .  I then added 1/4 cup of red vinegar, juice from 1 lime and sugar and salt and pepper and let that simmer on low for 10-15 minutes.(I marinated my chicken in this liquid mixture for hours prior to making to guarantee my chicken would be moist)  What a great taste-The cilantro really adds a nice mexican flavor.
I used hard taco shells on the inside of the soft ones and they were fabulous with some cheese, sour cream, salsa, lettuce, and tomatoe...Easy meal with delicious tastes-Can't go wrong!  For those of you who end up with dry chicken-you MUST marinate your chicken for atleast a few hours before cooking any dish!

These were great! They really picked up the flavor of the marinade. I thought the oregano was interesting..cilantro would probably make more sense, but I liked the oregano.

I love these. I use an already cooked rotisserie chicken from the food store and just make the sauce. I simmer the chicken in the sauce for a couple of minutes. I use cilantro in place of oregano. I also use Newman's Own Bandito Salsa Tequila Lime Salsa for an extra lime kick. I could eat these several times a week.

These have a wonderful flavour! I like a bit more heat so I made the "SPICY MANGO SALSA" found on this site as well. The combo of flavour is amazing! I wouldn't make this without it. It had a bit is a Thai flavour when eaten together. 
My niece and daughter ( 5 and 3) loved it, even with the salsa!

Thanks for sharing! Yum

These are good, but the chicken is pretty dry if you don't marinate it first like others suggested.  Next time!  Good flavor if you like lime.  Thanks for sharing!

I have a secret!  I tried this several times and using precooked rotisserie style chicken works the best!  ($4.99 at Sam's) It's so tender and not even funny how quick!  It also absorbs the flavor, this chicken is NOT lacking in flavor when made this way.  We make this once a week now. I made it again last night using the breast and thigh meat combined.  Just heat in a pan with a touch of olive oil to slightly sear, I sprinkle a touch of garlic powder, salt and pepper, then add the rest--I added a bit more lime.  Dinner's ready in 10 minutes and it's soooooo good!  Using fresh chicken is good, but not as tender! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is very easy to make and super-tasty.  The only change I would make it to cut the oregano by about half--it was a little overpowering.

Fantastic recipe! As per another's suggestion, I marinated the chicken for 4-5 hours before cooking. I also added more fresh lime juice when I cooked it. We skipped the diced tomato as there is enough tomato in the salsa. Used just a sprinkling of cheddar (to reduce the fat content) and instead of iceburg lettuce used fresh baby spinach leaves. Yum! Will definitely make again. Dh suggested shredding the chicken next time to make it lay inside the tortillas better.

This was a very flavorful recipe.  I doubled the recipe and marinated the chicken for a few hours.  It was browned on the outside, but moist on the inside, which my husband appreciated.  I will definitely be making these again.

This recipe was WONDERFUL!!!  Thank you sooooo much!  Instead of using boneless chicken breasts (which can sometimes be quite expensive), I used chicken theighs.  I first boiled them and then shreaded them.  It was great!  I even used the same lime seasoning for my beef.  It too came out great.  Thanks again!!!

I was a little hesitant about trying this recipe, it's different from the normal old taco with chili powder, I wasn't sure my children would try it, but it was a huge hit.  Only two of the eight didn't agree that these were great!

This was REALLY good!  The seasoning mix was wonderful, and it was a great cooking technique to saute the chicken in a saucepan so the moisture doesn't evaporate and dry it out (like it would in a skillet)...Plus, you don't have to use any oil to brown it.  Thus saving your fat & calories for sour cream and avacado!  I used a whole lime for extra kick, and it was great!

The chicken in this recipe has a great flavor. I used the whole lime instead of half for more zest! I will use this recipe for great tasting chicken anyday, with or without the tortillas. Try in a salad, it's yummy!

After reading all the reviews I followed others' suggestions to double the sauce, and tripled the lime juice. I substituted cilantro for the oregano, using both dried and fresh, added cumin, finely chopped onion, both red & jalapeno peppers as well as a generous "splash" of tequila to the marinade. After marinating the chicken, then sauteing and chopping it up (I sauteed it in thin slices first )  I added the marinade into the chicken and let it simmer together for about 10 minutes.  I followed the suggestion from Cindi M for the Baja Cream (1/4 c. mayo, 1/4 c. sour cream, 1 Tbsp. fresh lime juice, + some finely grated lime peel & chill to meld the flavors). It was a great addition, along with finely sliced cabbage, instead of lettuce, chopped tomatoes, grated cheese & salsa. They were a HUGE hit at our house and will be a part of our regular rotation from here on out. Thank you Marissa Wright for the great recipe!

I'm not one to leave reviews but couldn't pass on this one! Like LadyJayPee, I substituted Cilantro for the Oregano which was perfect. I tripled the sauce & marinated chicken in 2/3 of it for a couple hours. In the skillet, the sauce thickens/caramelizes which makes the flavor REALLY come out! I removed the chicken, leaving the scrapings from the sauce in pan, added a little olive oil & some remaining sauce with sliced sweet onion and red & yellow peppers and sauteed until slightly browned. Added the chicken back to skillet with peppers and warmed it all together then served on warm flour tortillas with sour cream. Eating it all like this, it did not need salsa or really anything else! The red wine vinegar, sugar and cilantro give it the best flavor. Another reviewer thought it had some kick, but I didn't really think it did. The kick, if any, is from the vinegar so lighten up on that a little if you'd like. Definitely will make again, thanks for sharing!

This was way better than I expected. Ingredients sounded odd but it was really good! Like a few others, I cooked it in the slow cooker. I'm lazy that way, lol. Whisked all the ingredients in the ungreased (yes ungreased!) crockpot (oh I didn't have green onion so I used about 1/4 cup diced brown onion), added the cubed chicken, mixed to coat the meat, then cooked it on low (untouched) for about 3 1/2 hours.  I was tempted to add more liquid since it looked dry but not necessary as the chicken juiced up nicely. And, I actually liked the oregano, but maybe it's because I used Mexican oregano? Served with flour tortillas, lettuce, tomato, jack cheese, sour cream and tomatillo salsa. It's a keeper, will make again. Thank you Marissa!

Didn't get much lime flavor out of this- primary taste was oregano which seems Mediterranean to me.Need al ittle more sauce. We liked it and probably would make again.

I made these last night for a quick dinner after a long day of packing and cleaning the house and these were amazing! I did make a few small changes, I seasoned the chicken breasts on both sides with the oregano, salt, pepper, and also some garlic powder and then cut it up and browned it in a tablespoon of olive oil. Once browned we added the green onions, red wine vinegar, and 4 tablespoons of lime juice and let it simmer for 10 minutes. The chicken had great flavor and we topped these tacos with lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole, cheese, and salsa and these really hit the spot! I will definitely make these again.

Fairly quick, relatively easy, & very tasty. Two thumbs up for this recipe. I substituted oregano for cilantro because of the reviews I read and I'm glad I did! Definitely recommend this recipe.

Yummy! Made these for dinner, and I would eat three more if I wasn't so full! I added a whole lime, instead of a half, and heated the mini tortillas in the oven wrapped in foil. Topped them with fresh cilantro, four cheese Mexican blend, lettuce, and tomato...can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Tacos are always fun to prepare. This one had a more subtle lime flavor than I had expected.  Chicken doesn't need 20 minutes. Better with small cubes of chicken.

This is so yummy. I was going to have tacos tonight (with ground hamburger) and was looking for recipes for tomorrow night (company coming over) and I ran across this.  I was only cooking for myself, so only had about 1/4 - 1/2 lb boneless chicken breasts. Used the same measurements (except for sugar  used 2 tsps.)  submitted onion (about 3 tablespoons) for the green onion , used cilantro instead of oregano and marinated the chicken in the mixture and then cooked the chicken with the mixture. This is really, really yummy.  Beats using ground hamburger anyday

Loved this recipe & will definitely make again. I substituted fresh cilantro for the oregano, and added a splash of tequila. I also baked the chicken in the oven, covered, then shredded and added all the ingredients to a crock pot to keep warm for a dinner party. Huge hit!

I loved it, BUT I followed the advice of another reviewer and used cilantro instead of oregano and added tequila to the marinade. I also made two batches of marinade. The first batch I used to bake my chicken breasts in the oven. I made the second batch on the stovetop. Once the chicken was cooked I shredded it and then heated it in the marinade on the stove. The hubby and the kid loved it, too.

Delicious! The directions are kind of terrible (20 minutes to sauteé chicken cubes?) but if you use common sense you can figure out the right way to put the ingredients together. I cooked the chicken just until no longer pink then added the other ingredients. I cooked it down for about 6 minutes more, stirring regularly. Delicious! Much more delicate flavor than "taco seasoning" will give you. It allows you to really have veggies and condiments accentuate the flavors instead of competing against them.

I plan on making this recipe again! Per others' reviews, I used yellow onions instead of green onions, which I enjoyed. I also used a whole lime. I chopped the cubes small or made thin slices so that it would cook quicker. Therefore, I started by sautéing in onions, then pretty much just added everything else. Other than cutting up the toppings, it is a quick, easy recipe. Very tasty, will make again for sure!

Amazing! This has gone into my weekly meal regimen. I typically marinate the chicken in the vinegar, lime juice, sugar, garlic, salt, pepper for a bit. Then I dump the chicken, marinade and all into a skillet and simmer until just cooked with a little onion and bell pepper. Sprinkle some cilantro and yum!!

I make these often. I don't really measure the vinegar. I marinate the chicken in half of the juiced lime and the zest, the garlic, onions, vinegar, sugar, salt and oregano. Then, when I am cooking it I add additional lime juice (because we like a pronounced lime flavor), and more of the other ingredients if needed. We use the monterey jack cheese and I would not suggest using any other cheese, but instead of the lettuce and salsa, we top these with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and cilantro. We love these!!

Loved this recipe.  Substituted cilantro for oregano.  Tripled the sauce, added tequila, and marinated the chicken in half over night and then discarded marinade.  Cooked chicken through and then added rest of sauce, cooking for 10 minutes longer.  Squirted extra lime on the finished taco to give it a strong citrus flavor.  Omitted the salsa and added sour cream.  Absolutely delicious!

Delicious!!!!

I was concerned while making these that they might be bland, but I was pleasantly mistaken.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and loved it.  This is super simple and adds a wonderful flavor to the chicken.  I bet it would be great as a marinade for grilled chicken breasts as well. Super easy and flavorful. Will definitely be making again.

This was a good sauce, which we doubled and used fresh cilantro.  We will use it again, but find a way to add a little heat.

This was so good I couldn't stop eating it, and neither could the rest of my family. I had leftover chicken from a roasted chicken I made last night, and this will definitely be my go-to recipe for leftover chicken from now on. I followed other reviewers' advice and omitted the oregano and used cilantro instead, and a lot of it. I also used a whole lime and doubled the garlic.

When I made this recipe I did the following changes:
cilantro for oregano
added sweet bell peppers

After we cooked it we topped it with whatever we wanted including more cilantro. I really enjoyed the recipe and will probably marinade it next time for more flavor with the chicken. It also reheated well and was yummy for lunch the next day.

Words can not explain how delicious this dish was. My family raved about it as they were eating and asked for a fresh batch a few nights later. Next time I will double the sauce and maybe the recipe as a whole since it was that good. Yummy!!!

I really enjoyed the strong flavors in this dish. The chicken was done in about 12 minutes for me and I only cooked the marinade for about 3 minutes longer (until all the liquid was dried up).  It took me about 30 minutes total to make which is unusual that I can get a flavorful recipe done in that short of time. I only used about a pound of chicken though and came away with 4 fulling tacos. Next time I would definitely use more chicken. I also used a whole lime and skipped the green onion.

I was totally surprised at how much I loved the flavors of the lime, red wine vinegar, and oregano in this recipe. I used left-over cooked chicken, added the rest of the ingredients, and simmered it long enough to get it warm. It turned out great! I also put my corn tortillas in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes, spraying them with cooking spray and salt and turning them over at the halfway mark. A delicious way to use up left-over meat, making it into a new meal.

I've been making these for a few years now and never got around to writing a review. These are great! Wonderful bright flavor. What a way to liven up some boring chicken. Hubby loves them too! This a recipe you should at least try...chances are, you will love them too!

The chicken was too sour for me, and I ended up adding some taco seasoning to give it more flavor.  I used white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, so maybe that's why it did not turn out that well.

Really good and really easy. I put frozen chicken breasts in the slow cooker, tossed everything else in. other than increasing the fresh lime and using cilantro instead of oregano followed the recipe pretty closely.  didn't have to do much at dinner time, just grate some cheese and chop up some lettuce. The chicken pretty much shredded itself.  Our 3 year old ate it and it was flavorful enough for the rest of us too! Thanks!

Delicious! I omitted the vinegar, since it gets plenty of acid from the (whole) lime juice. I used shredded cabbage for a great flavor and little more texture. Topped with a mix of 50/50 sour cream/ranch dressing. Best chicken tacos I've ever made!

We enjoyed this dish very much, full of flavor and so easy to prepare. The only thing I did different was to steam my chicken in a foil pack on the grill with all the ingredients sealed in the foil,I also used leg quarters because I had that on hand. I will use this recipe alot.

I made the recipe almost exactly as it states. The only thing I changed was I added the juice of a whole lime instead of half because the lime I had was not very juicy. The tacos were great; however, I think cilantro would have been a nice touch rather than the oregano. The chicken does not take 20 minutes to cook. I cooked for almost 15 minutes and knew that was probably too long and regretted  it being that the chicken came out a little dry. Will definitely make again with the above changes. Thanks for the recipe!

This chicken was very good. I did not use onions, garlic, or oregano. I would try it again with onions and garlic but the oregano seems odd to me in this dish. The flavor was pleasant without being overpowering.

So good!  We followed the instructions except we left out the oregano and put in plenty of chopped cilantro. We also baked the chicken first, then simmered in the sauce.  We also squeezed on fresh lime, which added an extra yummy/fresh taste.  This will be in our normal food rotation from now on!!

We thought it was pretty good.  Chicken didn't dry out, but I cut them into rather large chunks initially and broke them smaller as it cooked.  The only changes I made was to leave out the sugar as it didn't seem necessary and sprinkled on some ground cumin - maybe 1/4 tsp?)  I also ended up using almost a whole lime's worth of juice (about 1/4 cup).  I'll make it again - yum!

I personally think it would be better without the red wine vinegar, as it adds too much of a bitter taste. Otherwise the recipe was easy and terrific.  Will definitely make it again soon.

Wonderful and super easy! I always add a bit more lime for a stronger flavor. Delicious and healthy when I cut out the oil, go light on the cheese, and use whole wheat tortillas and extra veggies. :)

This was tasty.  I had some fresh corn, so I sauteed it and added it.  I also used shredded, cooked chicken and heated everything through in the skillet.  I used cilantro instead of oregano and one whole lime.  Served on corn tortillas with avocado.

Just okay.  The chicken seemed really bland.  Nothing to write home about.  I would like to try it again but in the crockpot like someone else mentioned.  I think that will help the flavor of the chicken.  I added more lime juice and a splash of Tequila.

Yum. Used cilantro and a dash of cumin with a regular butcher onion. Ate it on taco shells topped with canned black beans and the avocado, tomato and mango salsa on the site. I would've paid topped dollar for this meal!! Fantastic.

These were very good, but nothing to go crazy over.  I marinated the chicken for several hours in the mixture and then cooked it.  The lime flavor came through nicely, but I think you could get a similar effect just from squirting some lime over your chicken.  I will keep it in the recipe box, but I'm inclined to try some fajita marinades and add lime juice next time to really compare.

I used 3 chicken breasts (just over 1 and 1/2 pounds) and doubled the sauce amount. It came out really well and was a huge hit with my family. 

Next time, I think I'll slow cook the chicken and shred it as I didn't like the chicken in small chunks.

I made these exactly as outlined in the recipe. They were pretty good. Next time I'll cut down on the red wine vinegar, but other than that I don't think any changes are necessary.

Very fresh tasting and a wonderful change from the typical red sauce based taco meat mixtures. I really enjoyed these. My husband was not crazy about them as he said they were too dry for his liking (he is used to the red sauced taco filling). I served this with sour cream, shredded lettuce , chopped tomatoes and salsa. YUM! Made sides of re-fried beans and home-made Mexican rice.

I made no changes to the recipe other than that I added the vinegar and everything after only 10 minutes of sauteing and it was perfect! LOVE this recipe. People definitely need to try it as posted because it is great with the green onions and oregano. I topped it with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and salsa. YUM!

This was great and easy!  I cubed the chicken with a red and a yellow pepper and a sm yellow onion.  Put it all in a bag with the wet mixture and marinaded it for about an hr.  Then I just tossed it in a skillet.  Very tender!  The whole family and visiting kids even liked it.

This is really good.  I didn't expect this to be so good.  Seems like a wierd combination with the red wine vinegar and lime juice.  Thanks for a good, fast recipe.

I guess my expectations were too high after reading all of the 5-star reviews.  I thought it was just okay.  The oregano was a little overpowering for my taste.  I did think the chicken was very juicy though.

These were a nice change from the regular soft tacos we usually eat, BUT they didn't stand out and I didn't feel like eating the leftovers the next day. I don't regret trying them, but I'm not planning to make them again.

This was a decent recipe, it tasted nice & was easy to throw together.  But it wasn't really memorable and not worth a 5 star rating, sorry.

I'm giving this four stars because I thought it was a little sweet for chicken tacos. I might try leaving out the sugar next time. It was still very good though. I threw all the ingredients in a crock pot with three small chicken breasts and it cooked in three hours on low. Very easy and overall pretty good. I'll try this again.

Excellent recipe! We really enjoyed this dish. The only thing I did differently was to cut the chicken into strips rather than cubes - it just fit the tortilla better.  All together a keeper!

Delicious! I added more lime than it called and made it with the classic taco sauce (mayo and lime.) Also, put some cilantro in with the chicken. Definitely keeping the recipe. Thanks!

I usually add more Lime, and I cook the cut up chicken with the rest of the seasonings in one pan.  YUM-thanks for the recipe

This recipe was OK but too similar to another that I have that is better. My Chicken Fajita recipe from Williams-Sonoma is tremendously better. I won't make this again as I'll stick to the fajita recipe.

Really enjoyed these tacos. Thanks for the recipe. I made almost as written except I added fresh cilantro when I dished the chicken into the tortillas. The red wine vinegar really added great flavor! Will make over and over! I take that back, I've already made it over and over. =)

With a few changes, these tacos were excellent.  I used cilantro instead of oregano and corn tortillas instead of flour.  I also added El Pato jalapeno salsa, guacamole and sour cream.  I topped them with extra green onions, cabbage, and a squeeze of lime.  Sooo good and healthy, too!

I made this in a slow cooker & the chicken was very "chalky" -- I think from spending so much time in the lime juice.

This was excellent!  My husband and kids loved it, they almost didn't leave me any.  I also used the tequila as others suggested.  We also like to use hard shell tacos, and they were pretty good.  Thanks!

I substituted the oregano with about a tablespoon of fresh cilantro, and added fresh cilantro to the topping options when serving.  Also, used the juice of a whole lime, because the juice of half the lime wasn't nearly enough.  The only other thing that I would add to make this recipe perfect is a dollop of sour cream to finish the taco off.

YUM! Added the cilantro instead of oregano, jalapenos and twice the lime. I also tried something a different by using wholemeal pittas sliced in half. I warmed them on our George Forman griddle and put the cheese inside when I flipped them over. The finishing touch was some spicy Oporto sauce that I don't think is available in the states, but can buy by the bottle at any Oporto in Australia. Will make again for sure.

Fantastic recipe!  Having a lime based flavor was a great change of pace from the typical tomato base  I usually fix.  The only change I made was using cilantro vs oregano.  Highly recommend !!

Very good!  Lots of great flavors.  My husband commented that it was one of the best tacos he had ever had!  I served mine with a pico de gallo type salsa, but if I had not, I would probably add cilantro regardless.

Delicious!  I used the homemade taco seasoning mix posted by Bill Echols instead of the seasonings in this recipe, and wow!  The lime juice is an excellent addition, and the chicken was very tender.  As others said, the chicken did cook faster than 20 minutes.  Thank you, Marissa!

I have to say...this is a big difference than your average chicken taco. The flavor was amazing! I also took the advice of some other reviews and replaced the oregano with cilantro. Me & my husband really enjoyed this meal. Will definitely make again :)

These were nice and refreshing on a scorching hot day. I had key limes on hand so I used three of those, and was out of green onions so I used sliced red onions sauteed with the chicken. Mine did not need 30 minutes of cooking time though - more like 15 with the chicken cut small. Served on whole wheat tortillas and loved them.

The flavor was wonderful, light and refreshing.  I too used cilantro instead of oregano.  I also bought a baked chicken at the supermarket and used the meat from that.  My only issue witht his recipe was that there was no liquid...it all obsorbed into the chicken and I was afraid of it being dry.  I'll modify the next time I make these.  Thank you!

Good Recipe. I added cilantro instead of oregano and didn't add the green onions (not a big fan of onions) Nice flavor and easy to make. I also grilled my chicken first then diced it up and added it to the sauce.

This recipe was excellent! I used everything except the green onions and tomatoes (fiance isn't a fan). Had a nice lime taste without being overpowering. It was also very quick to make. We will be making this again.

Great! I put in slow cooker and then shredded. I used 1 lime and no oregano, regular onion, and some Rotel and a little chicken broth so it was super moist.

This recipe was a hit at my house! The only modifications I made was adding a couple teaspoons of chili powder and doubling the lime.  The chicken had a delicious flavor - we ate the leftovers for days!  I think it got better every time.  Next time, I'll try it in crock pot and pull the chicken.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I just threw it into the slow cooker and shredded the chicken. I used the full lime instead of half. Then I made the wraps, using spinach instead of lettuce and put it in the oven until the outside was crispy and the cheese was melted. (about ten minutes)

These are delicious as-is.  I was skeptical about the oregano at first, but it's really good!  You *must* put salsa, sour cream, and monterey jack cheese on these.  You'll want to make them again and again!

My husband really liked these. I followed another reviewer's advice and omitted the oregano but added cilantro at the end; I also sprinkled some ground cumin over the chicken while it was cooking to give it some extra flavor. I also grated the lime peel into the chicken, which I think helped give it more of a lime flavor. Served it on whole wheat tortillas with guacamole and home made pico de gallo. Thanks!

We liked these! However, I agree that the recipe does *not* feed 10 people. I would say two tacos per person for a net of 5 people...unless you have a big meat eater or bigger appetites. I know some say oregano is too italian for this dish. I disagree, since you'll find it in lots of mexican dishes.  We did add cilantro as well. This dish felt more like Miami than Mexico to me...If you are looking for more of a fajita flavor , you could add cumin, chili powder, and onion powder, but that would be a new dish! We enjoyed this as is. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for the second time tonight, substituting cilantro for oregano. I also add a teaspoon of paprika because I love it. As tasty as the first time.  I was surprised tonight to see the exact recipe printed on my package of MexAmerica whole wheat tortillas. Could be the origin of the recipe. They have more recipes on their website. They say 7 minutes to cook the cubed chicken, btw.
~Edit~ I also now throw all the ingredients(whole breasts too)in the slow cooker on high for an hour and low for 4 hours. Then I remove the breasts, shred the meat and return it to the juices in the crock. One of our favorites and so easy!

Very yummy.  Hit with group for dinner.  Cooked chicken in crockpot for approx. 4 hrs. and shredded with a fork and then add sauce mix.  Did, per other reviews,  add 1 tsp of cumin and some chili powder.  Added more sauce to the chicken as well.  Added some additional sugar to tone down the tartness.

Very good recipe. When I am in a hurry, I like doing this with a rotisserie chicken from the store, then doing the sauce on the side for everyone to add on their own. I usually add a little bit of sour cream to the sauce to make it creamier. This sauce is also wonderful for fish tacos.

This recipe was excellent. After reading a review, I also decided to put all the ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook. Once the chicken was done I shredded it, returned it to the crock pot and we all had a fabulous dinner!

This recipe was ok. The chicken really didn't have a lot of flavor once you put on some salsa and cheese. Maybe doubling the lime juice/vinegar mixture would add more flavor. Or slow cooking it would. It wasn't bad though

This was okay. I have been looking for a chicken taco recipe using lime and with all the great reviews this had, I thought I found it. Maybe it's just me, but I didn't think the chicken was very flavourful. I added a canned chipotle pepper with a little juice from the can to spice them up and they were better. I like my chicken tacos well seasoned, and this wasn't what I was looking for. I guess I will continue to look. Thanks!

The flavor was great, but the chicken a little dry... I think next time (and there will be a next time) I'll marinate the chicken in a salsa mixture prior to cooking.

Thanks a lot.  I am now confined to the sofa for the evening after gorging beyond my limit on this fantastic recipe. My brain did attempt to end the gluttony on several occasions, only to be quickly squelched by my stomach's continuous desire to keep having more.  A worthy battle, but one definitely worth loosing.  I will point out that I did serve the tacos with Bob Cody's allrecipes.com guacamole for that extra kick of flavor.  Well done Lime Chicken Soft Tacos.  Well done.

These were great! I doubled the sauce, but kept the  sugar to 1tsp, added fresh cilantro in place of oregano, added 1tsp cumin & chili powder, a few dashes of tabasco, and some canned chopped green chiles and it was perfect. I plan on using this recipe over and over again for chicken tacos! Yummy!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this was WAY too tangy for me and my husband.  In the unlikely event that we make this again, we'd definitely be scaling back the lime and vinegar.

Very good.  I made it exactly like the recipe says to.  The only thing is, it doesn't make very much.. So, if you want enough for more than a couple people, you should definetely double or triple the recipe.

I make this over & over!  Definitely a family favorite meal.  Quick, easy, tasty and fun.  Great with guacamole, jalapenos and refried beans as topping choices. Easy to change to vegetarian style with veggie chicken, just needs a little more liquid.  Thanks for the great meal.

Great flavor!  I too used fresh cilantro instead of oregano and I added a bit of cumin.  I made this in the crockpot starting with frozen breasts and it was easy and very tasty.  At first I thought the lime was a bit strong due to the slow cooking but once you make the taco's its just right.  I cheated on the other seasonings by using 2 tsp of canadian steak seasoning which is garlic, onion, salt and pepper, so the same resulting flavor.

This was a really easy, and yummy recipe.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and seasoned the chicken with some chili powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper before browning.  I also doubled the sauce and used cilantro instead of oregano.  As for the salsa, I used some fresh salsa (from this site) instead of storebought, and everything came together wonderfully!

Followed the recipe as written ecept used cilantro (a Mexican food staple) instead of oregano - was that a serious typo? Oregano is not what you need here. Try it with cilantro and you will love it. Great hit with the WHOLE family! Thanks!

Wow! Really, really amazing! I used 1 lb of chicken breast and doubled the marinade all but the red wine vinegar. I also added about 1/2 tsp of cummin and cayanne pepper. Cook the chicken for about 8 minutes and then add the marinade as well as some red and green peppers and a 1/2 cup of onions. Used a little bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce too. Fantastic recipe!---- I tried marinating the chicken for a few hours and then cooking and adding more marinade...not a fan. The chicken was dry and over cooked and it just did not have the same fresh taste as the original recipe.

I knew before I made them that they were going to lack in the spice department (atleast for my crew). So I added some cumin and chili and served them with Guacomole. Doing it this way they turned out really well.

I agree with a previous reviewer that the aroma is better than the actual result. I made this twice and added more garlic the 2nd time. 4 large cloves. That made a big difference. Also threw in some chopped jalepenos, double the green onions and a few dashes of Tobasco Verde sauce. Also shredded the chicken after cooking. Second time around with more flavor additions and it was very good.

Sorry, but this recipe wasn't at all what I expected. There was no flavor, no color, very bland. Glad it worked for the others!

Love It!!I boiled a whole fryer just b/c I think it taste better, I use cilantro instead of oregano, fresh lime juice & 6 cloves of garlic, a serreno pepper thinly sliced, we like it spicy..Put corn tortillas in napkin & microwave for less than a minute, only for those who care about dieting I'd rather dip in hot oil for a minute, then simmer in chicken broth all together.Made w/fideo. Perfect.

not close to enough flavor for us. added more lime and a splash of tequila, still not enough flavor.  we did use the leftovers for quesadillas, and the chicken was appreciated more that way.  but back to our usual chicken tacos we go!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I was kind of hesitant to try it b/c of the vinegar, I'm not a big fan of lime either. BUT it had just enough flavor to make it wonderful! My husband added more lime juice to his individual tacos, but raved about them. They are also great the next day too!

I don't know why this recipe has received such high reviews.  The basic premise of sauteing chicken with a lime-based mixture and serving in tortillas spice is great, and I reworked the recipe to take care of the problems which I had:  10 servings?  24 ounces of chicken and 10 6" flour tortillas for 10 servings sounds like you will have some hungry people scrounging around the kitchen after dinner.  Especially when you see that there is a quarter-cup of lettuce, a quarter-cup of cheese, one quarter-cup of salsa and one tomato divided between 10 servings.    Also, the cooking instructions were a little off.  What happens when you cook diced chicken breast at high heat for 20 minutes?  Either burnt or dried-out chicken.  This step should take only 6-7 minutes.  What I did was to increase the amount of tortillas to 2 per person.  Then I increased the amount of cheese (not too much, since we are watching out sat fat intake), tomato, and lettuce.  I also added some light sour cream thinned with skim milk, and a half an avocado (chopped).  I increased the amount of lime juice, added a little chicken broth, and also added ground cumin and some chili powder to the (Mexican) oregano.  Finally, I used high-fiber, lower fat corn tortillas in place of the flour, which are also more traditional in a taco (burritos and enchiladas call for flour tortillas).

Very tasty!  I'm not a big oregano fan and wondered about that and then read a lot of the other reviews suggesting to sub. cilantro and/or cumin AFTER my chicken was sauteeing with the oregano. But...in the end, I was actually glad I stuck to the original recipe b/c we all really liked it with the oregano and didn't think it had an Italian flavor at all.  I did end up using the juice of a whole lime and did add a little cumin for some certain Mexican flavor.  With lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and spicy salsa...Mmmm Mmm!

This recipe is fantastic! I added fresh cilantro instead of oregano and added a little bit of homemade taco seasoning. I was skeptical at first with the lime juice and vinegar but it gives a really nice flavor. Served with homemade guacamole and salsa.

Have to give this one 5 big stars.  It was great.  I actually exactly followed the recipe which is extremely out of character for me and it was great, just as is.  I'm making it again tonight for my husband and since I don't have any green onions at home I'll probably use regular onions and throw in some green pepper too.  This is a nice hot weather dish since it's not a "heavy" meal and sort of cool in flavor.  But I agree that this is probably more in proportion for 2-4 people even if it might make 10 servings.

Pretty tasty change to regular soft tacos.  I didn't have oregano, but used parsley flakes instead...was still great.  I used a whole lime instead of just half.  Was also great the next day as a leftover!  I would maybe recommend a larger size taco shell too, I could hardly fit all of the ingredients in the 6 inch.

The only change I made was using cilantro instead of oregano. I added probably 1tbs of chopped fresh cilantro. I used the juice of a whole lime. I boiled the chicken breasts so they'd be more moist & tender than frying. Mixed the other ingredients together in a pot, and added the shredded chicken, then cooked for about 10 minutes. This is also very good served w/mexican rice added to the taco.

My son and I really liked this! I made it in the crock pot and it was ready in about 6 hours (I used tenderloins so they cooked a little quicker without having to cut them up. They fell apart into chunks as I scooped them out for our tacos. Thanks!

Basically I used all the reviewers' suggestions - I doubled the marinade and used 1 full lime instead of 1/2 per batch.  Cooked the chicken and then put it in the Crockpot for 2 hours with the marinade, then pulled it with 2 forks.  Used a small amt of cumin in lieu of oregano.  So it was good.  Not exceptional, but good- maybe by the time we heaped on the toppings, we weren't paying attention to the meat! (Definitely increase the toppings.)  I served it over chips and also made guacamole.

I did not have any limes so I used lemon juice.  It was very good, I imagine it will be even better next time with the lime.  I doubled the sauce.

This was excellent.  Family loved it.  I subbed the oregano with fresh cilantro.  I also doubled the "sauce" and marinated the chicken for an hour or two prior to cooking.  I added a teaspoon of cumin to the marinade which I loved.  Did not use the green onion because we are not onion fans.  I served this in the "Hard Taco Shells" recipe from this site.  I also served with "D's Famous Salsa" and "Mexican Rice II" from this site.  Awesome meal!

Very good.  Didn't give 5 stars because it needed just a little more flavor. I might try adding a little tequila next time?! I too cooked the chicken in a slow cooker.  In the morning I added all the ingredients to the crock pot and let it cook all day (around 8 hours).  When I came home I took the meat out and pulled apart/shredded the meat with two forks.  Returned the meat to the cooker and let it marinate/sit until it was time to serve.  Prior to serving I drained off the excess liquid.  This was served to 12 women with all the taco fixings and it was a bit hit.

This was amazingly easy!  I pulled the chicken instead of cubing it. I made it just how the recipe says, only I cooked the chicken separately and then sauted it with all the other ingredients for about 10 minutes.  I will definitely make these again.

Easy, tasty, and healthy.  I added some cumin and topped with chopped red onion, salsa, fat free cheddar and fat free sour cream.

I made this chicken for tonight's dinner and thought it was really good.  I'm glad I read the other reviews.  Here's what I did differently: instead of dried oregano I used dried cilantro and added a couple of dashes of cumin.  I roughly doubled the amount of chicken and used chicken tenders instead of cubed chicken.  Instead of sauteeing the chicken in the pan then adding everything else I tripled the other ingredients (but I used 2 whole limes instead of 1 1/2 limes, and I didn't measure the green onions or garlic either - just tossed a bunch of both in since you can never have too much of either) and marinated the chicken overnight, turning it in the big Ziploc bag several times.  I grilled the chicken on the indoor grill.  It only took about 3 - 5 minutes or so.  I made the chicken in advance of dinner and served it at room temperature.  It was great!  I served it with flour tortillas, shredded Mexican blend cheese, chopped tomatoes, slivered white onion, chopped red bell pepper, sour cream, mild and medium salsa and homemade guacamole (LuvAnn's Guacamole from this site with a few cloves of chopped garlic tossed in).  I have lots of leftovers for tomorrow and think it'll be even better tomorrow.  I really enjoyed it.  It was extremely easy and tasty.  I'm not necessarily a huge Mexican food fan, but this was great.  I highly recommend it and plan to make it regularly!

What a fantastic alternative to the traditional tacos. They were delicious.  I did add the cilantro instead of the oregano, and the splash of tequilla that some people recommended would have been great too....if I had any left!

I always try to listen to other reviewers to make things better so....double the sauce, cilantro a must instead of oregano, and I even omitted step one by grabbing a rotisserie chicken. OH! and the serving for 10 really only fed 3 of us. Good stuff!

The mixture of red wine vinegar and lime juice is fabulous!! I also added cilantro instead of oregano and also cut the green onions and substituted them with a regular white onion.  Still delicious!!!  I will be making these again very soon :)!

This was delicious. I made it in the crock pot. Sliced the chicken, used sweet onion, cilantro instead of oregano, put some cumin in and a few splashes of tequilla and used key limes, right before serving I stirred in fresh chopped cilantro. It was polished off even the kids loved it.

You definitely need to omit the oregano and substitute it with fresh cilantro (I used about 1/4 cup chopped).  Instead of cubing the chicken, I boiled the chicken breasts then shredded it with two forks.  I think next time I'll double the sauce.  It was a littly dry, but still had great flavor.

Omitted oregano, added basil & small amount of cumin. Also omitted salsa & tomatoes didn’t have either (did but didn’t want to bother using for such a small amount). Wasn’t able to warm tortillas in pan, still came out just fine.

This recipe was delicious.  Instead of cubing the chicken I cut the chicken into long strips.  Next time I would double the sauce and marinade the chicken for a few hours.  Very quick and easy.  The lime taste was very minimal, but the combination of ingredients was sublime.  I served with Spanish rice and guacamole.

This was just ok and I don't think I'd make it again. My hubby and I both found it pretty plain, so I think we'll go back to regular fajitas. Also, I sauted the chicken over medium heat for maybe 5 minutes - not medium-high heat for 20 minutes!

When I made these for a party, I used boneless chicken thighs and cooked them in the slow cooker. I read the reviews here and used cilantro instead of oregano and added cumin and chili powder. Near the end of cooking time, I shredded the chicken with a fork and put it back with the juice. It was served with corn tortillas, sour cream, fresh cilantro and salsa.   Good reviews all around from the guests. I'll definitely keep this one in the files.

These were pretty delicious.  I really didnt notice much of a difference between these and just regular chicken fajitas with seasonings that I normally make.  I mostly tasted a hint of the balsamic vinegar in these more than the lime.  So next time I would definitely add a lot more lime juice to give it the lime flavor.  Also a great idea is to have some lime wedges on the side so everyone can squeeze it over the top if they want.  Very good recipe, will try again but next time with more lime!

I really enjoyed this but as some other reviewers recommended I poached the chicken then shredded and let it simmer in the sauce..I think next time I will omit the sugar and lessen the vinegar..I threw in a few splashes of chicken stock and it seemed to mellow the vinegar..I served in corn tortillas with salsa, cheese, guacamole and sour cream..thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this recepie the other night and it was great! As it is it's probably a very good 4 star, make often and love recipe. I made a few changes and the next time I make it (which will be soon) I'm going to make a couple of more. I love garlic so I doubled that. I didn't have any red wine vinegar on hand so I used apple cider. Tasted so great I'm using it every time. I also cut down the oregano and added a bit of chili pepper. Next time I'm going to marinate this for about 30 min before cooking and increase the chilli and green onions. Cooking this a crock pot would also be a good idea. Without a marinade or crock pot this is good but the flavor isn't enough to get 5 stars. Overall great recipe and a must try.

This recipe is delicious...BUT...there is no reason to cook cubed white meat chicken for 20 minutes over medium high heat and then simmer with other ingredients an additional 10 minutes unless you want the chicken to completely dry out. When I first read the recipe, I thought the author made an error.  You can saute the cubed chicken over low heat and stir it until you see no more pink, then add the liquid ingredients and continue to cook under low heat. The chicken will be cooked sufficiently using this method. The recipe otherwise is excellent.

The first time I made this I marinated the chicken and cooked in the slow cooker per other reviews.  We enjoyed it but it had a strong taste and was overpowering.  Today I made it just as stated and it was AWESOME!  Very tasty!  Great recipe, I'm glad I decided to give it another try.

Good. I added a splash of tequila to the chicken mixture, sour cream and tabasco green hot sauce to the actual taco.  It was slightly lime sweet and spicy.  I will be making this one again.

Great recipe-fast, easy, and the kids loved it. I added more lime juice, used fajita seasoning instead of the pepper, and added cilantro. Ranch dressing completed a great meal!

I thought this recipe was awesome! I did adjust some ingredients. I sauteed the chicken(seasoned in salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin and chili powder) and 1/4 chopped white onion. Then added a can of black beans, vinegar, lime and spices(omitted the oregano). Just before seving I added fresh cilatro to the chicken. ABSOLUTELY WONDEFUL!!

Eh, this was ok.  I thought the red wine vinegar overpowered the lime flavor, but it wasn't super bad.  I only used 2 chicken breasts and the sauce was just enough so I highly doubt the sauce described would make enough for chicken for 10 servings.  It was ok but I probably won't make again.

as is 4 stars, with some extra seasonings, 5 stars from us!  I prepared the sauce and marinated the chicken in it for about 2 hours with the addition of cayenne pepper, cumin, and chili powder.  I used them sparingly, so we could still taste the lime, but this gave it the bite we were looking for.  we grilled the chicken and thinly sliced it sprinkling the tacos with cilantro in addition to traditional toppings.  a very "fresh" take on tacos.  thanks for sharing!

This was great! I used to use chicken taco seasoning packets but hated how salty they were so I wanted to try a scratch marinade. This one was awesome. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and doubled the marinade (next time I will triple). I replaced oregano with cilantro, added splash of tequila. I used apple cider vinegar and it was good. I made the tacos nice and healthy by serving on whole wheat tortillas, topped with homemade guacamole (instead of sour cream), black beans, cheese and tomato. Also, I always make chicken tacos with canned chicken (all white meat-I stock up at Costco). I warm the canned chicken in skillet and dust with chili pepper. The chicken just shreds itself when mixed around wih the spatula. So easy and very good!

This is a great easy taco recipe that can be adjusted for anyone's taste. I added a little more lime juice than is called for, just because I'm really into the lime flavor. I also used corn tortillas, for a little more texture. But I would highly recommend this for those nights where you feel like putting minimal effort into your cooking.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. I'm a vegetarian so I always sub tofu for the chicken and it turned out well. The only thing is the oregano didn't seem to go well with the lime theme for me. I'll try it next time without the oregano.

absolutely wonderful!  I wish I'd doubled this recipe because my family couldn't get enough of them. I used fresh cilantro instead of the oregano. The chicken makes excellent leftovers for tacos the next day.  Five stars and will be making again!

Excellent. I was a little frightened at how bland the chicken/onion mixture looked and tasted until I smothered it in fresh cilantro and added the Top20 guacamole recipe on this site. POW did that make a difference! DELISH, even my 7 yr old ate this! I will definately be cooking this again. A+

Very good. Like others, I (1) added extra lime juice and (2) tripled the lime juice mixture and used some to marinade the chicken about 1 hour before cooking. I also used 2 lbs. of chicken. 

I made this for company (along with the Spanish Rice II recipe on this site). All of us (4 adults and 2 kids) thought the lime flavor was good--not overpowering but just enough to add a nice touch to bland, plain chicken.

This was excellent and very easy to make, the hardest part was cubing the chicken, which my hubby took care of.  Everyone in our family enjoyed it, I did use Cilantro instead of Oregano..the combination of the Cilantro w/ Lime Juice was great.  Would have added a little Tequila, but ended up drinking it instead.  :-)  This will definitely be our only Chicken Taco Recipe…thank you for sharing.

Give this a three since the kids didn't complain about them, but the chicken had no taste. Made in crock pot, no oregano, cumin instead. Added small can of diced green chilies and cilantro. Added part of a red onion along with three green onions. It was just too blah. Once I added the taco fixings, it was just any ol' chicken taco. Was hoping this would be a nice change from my typical chicken cooked in salsa tacos. Unfortunately I wont make again.

This recipe was great. I did make a couple of changes, though. I substituted cilantro for the oregano and added a couple of sliced fresh jalapeno's into the marinade. I also used a little more lime juice. The result was very favorful, tender chicken. The family loved it!

The best EVER!!!  Sliced chicken into 1"x1/4" strips.  Tripled the sauce and used 2/3rds as a marinade, let sit for 30 minutes.  Cooked for 10 minutes then added the remaining 1/3rd sauce and cooked almost another 10 minutes.  I omitted the garlic, onions, and oregano since I can't eat the first two while breastfeeding.  Assembled the soft tacos like this: flour tortilla, 6 or so baby spinach leaves, 1 spoon of black beans (not refried), 2 spoons of chicken, 1 spoon of thinly diced jicama, 2 slices of fresh avocado, and top with cilantro.  Was not runny or messy to eat.  I love adding in raw foods and the flavors and textures went so well together.

Exellent !!!! Followed the ingredients to a T. Cooking method was different. I used an electric pressure cooker and cooked boneless, skinless thighs (all I had) on high pressure for 10 mins. Took the chicken out, shreadded it, put it back in and slow cooked for 2 hrs. Was loved by all !!! Thanks Marissa for a Great and Yummy recipe !!! :) :) :) :) :)

I've made this twice now in the crock pot, on low for 6 hrs. I prefer the crockpot to do my cooking for me while I'm at work, but both times there was something I didn't care for about it or something was missing. The second time I added a half of a can of drained petite diced tomatoes and cilantro and that added to the authentic flavor but then I realized that it was the chicken itself that I didn't like. I think cooking it in the crockpot made the chicken kind of mushy and over shredded and gave it a canned chicken texture that I didn't like at all. The texture I think would be good if I added some black beans, corn and rice to try a southwest flavor. The overall flavor was good but I think I'll be better off doing it on the stove like the recipe says just to keep the chicken a little firmer. However after the leftovers dried out a little overnight they did make good chicken quesadillas for lunch.

I made this step by step, per the original recipe...PERFECT!  I served this buffet style with the added fajita fixin's...guacamole...sour cream...'green' sauce...roasted green pepper.  What a HIT!

Everyone could tailor their sandwich the way they wanted.  Low or high fat.  Spicy or not!  Great recipe, the chicken was perfectly seasoned.

Really good recipe. I doubled the sauce and added this or that to suit my tastes (like more lime, a tad more sugar and cilantro - NO oregano, and a couple of shakes or so of crushed red pepper). I served these on flour tortillas (would have preferred corn but I was out) with sour cream, shredded lettuce and finely shredded cheddar. Also served with Pace Tequila Lime Salsa - I don't like Pace salsas but this stuff is quite good with a nice bite that went perfectly with these tacos. Keep in mind - the lime sauce for the chicken is VERY lime-y - but not after cooking. It mellows substantially over the heat and mixed with the chicken.

Very good. I followed other reviewers and used cilantro instead of oregano, and I used a bit more lime than the recipe called for. Included in our soft tacos were lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and extra chopped green onions and cilantro.  

Will make these again - thanks for sharing!

Yummy!!! I didn't change a thing! It has a fresh taste and the aroma while cooking are mouth wateringly delicious!!
While it was simmering the additional 10 minutes, my daughter strolled into the kitchen sniffing mmmmmm what smells so good!?!?!?! 
We will no longer be buying the packaged taco seasoning!

Loved these, I needed an easy/yummy Saturday night recipe and this fit the bill. I have always just used those pre packaged taco seasoning but no more. I loved the taste of the lime and the red wine vinegar it really gave the taco's a kick.A change I made was that I grilled my chicken instead of how the recipe told me to do it, this cut cooking time down by 10 mins.My mom isn't even a taco fan and she loved these as well. I was hoping for leftovers, but had no such luck..we finished it all! I will be using this recipe for quick and easy weekday dinners. Guacamole is also really nice with this, I didn't bother making any other sides they really weren't needed! Stuff I cut for dressing up that taco's were, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream and onions.

Absolutely phenomenal!!!  I did use a little oil when sauteeing the chicken to prevent sticking and increased the green onions. Oh and I doubled the lime juice as well. The flavor of these tacos made my tate buds pop. I will definitely be making this again!!!

Very very yummy!!!!  My husband is strictly a beef taco kind of guy and he was pretty unsure about trying them.  To my surprise he loved them. The only changes I made, was I put the juice of 1 1/2 limes in and added more sugar and added chopped sweet red pepper to the mix. Great recipe!

As the recipe is written, I have no idea what it would taste like, but with the changes I made, we thought it was fantastic. Instead of using red wine vinegar, I just juiced an entire (really big) lime. I mixed the spices and lime juice together and marinated the chicken in the mixture for 4 hours. I only sauteed the chicken a few minutes before adding the marinade and green onions and simmering. Yummy!

Great chicken taco recipe.  I used split chicken breast and put everything in the crock pot.  I added a little more seasoning than what is called for.  The lime is a great addition.  This is a KEEPER!!!

Really nice flavor!  I browned my chicken in olive oil and we used about 1/4 cup of lime juice because we didn't have an actual lime.  Very easy and delicious!

I wasn't very impressed with this dish.  I was a little disappointed.  Maybe next time I will try it with cilantro instead of the oregano.

Great recipe! Forgot to buy green onions and actually am glad that I did. I had some cilantro on hand and used that instead which I feel gave it a more authentic mexican taste. Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was great, fast, and easy.  Everyone in the house really liked it!  However, I did follow a few reviews and marinated the chicken a couple of hours before cooking.  Also I doubled the sauce for it.  I will definitely make this again.  It would be wonderful as a chicken salad, on top of pasta, well it is endless.

This was wonderful!  I marinated the chicken for about 8 hours and then made a second batch to cook with.  We didn't use cheese.  I was trying to be a bit healthy, but blew that when I put sour cream on the taco. I also added a red bell pepper to the chicken and it added a nice touch of color and flavor. It was so good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this recipe a few times now.  The first time it came out great (tons of flavor), but the second time it didn't come out as well.  I think you have to measure the ingredients carefully and not mess around too much- the flavors are all so strong that it's easy for them to get out of balance.  But thanks for a way to make chicken, which can be so bland, very flavorful!

Recipe as is = 3 to 4 stars. For 5 stars, definately marinate a few hours, drain, then cook in a fresh batch of sauce. I seared the breast (strips) in a cast iron skillet on high heat for a couple minutes, then added sauce, covered and simmered on low for just a little while and it was very moist. Juice and zest from real lime when marinating should give plenty of citrus flavor. I used a pinch of dried, not ground, oregano, along with fresh cilantro and it was very good. Yum Yum!

This one is a good recipe...I used rice vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar because that is what I had and it turned out delicious (and healthy).  I have also used the chicken on a whole wheat pita with lettuce, chopped tomato, chopped cucumber, feta cheese and balsamic vinaigrette - makes kind of a pita salad. Wonderful!

This was a very good recipe.  I didn't have green onions so I used a small can of diced green chiles and it added a good flavor.  Our kids even liked it.  Watch the vinegar.  I read about that in earlier reviews so I didn't over do.  This is a recipe now added to the favorites!!! Yummy.

Do not over do the red vinegar!  I messed up and doubled the sauce as suggested but I think the vinegar was too much for the chicken.  I like the flavor a great deal but it left my mouth raw.  I will definately make these again but watch my vinegar.

I made this recipe using more lime juice and substituted cilantro for the oregano and really liked it, I asked my husband to taste the chicken and see if he liked it and to tell me if he thought it needed anything. He wanted a little cumin and chili powder because he really likes the traditional taco taste. I added just enough to taste the spices but to also still taste the lime and cilantro and that was really good also. We even used the left over chicken the next day for breakfast adding eggs, corn, salsa and sour cream, then wrapped it in the leftover tortillas. That was so good, maybe even better than the dinner!

The chicken didn't really brown, so it had this pasty white appearance to it.  I'll cook it over higher heat next time.  I also thought the oregano was a weird, non-Mexican food flavor.  I used fresh cilantro as well, but next time will leave out the oregano and replace it with more cilantro.  I doubled the recipe to feed 3 adults, and good thing I did because it was almost gone!  Overall good and easy, but needs tweaks for my tastes.

Yummy!  I substituted dried cilantro for the oregano and doubled the sauce (although next time I might even triple it).  Fresh cilantro would probably be better but it was quite good as is.  Also a little sour cream in the wrap would've been nice (albeit less healthy!)  Thanks...this one is a keeper!

I substituted the cilantro, added more lime juice, then followed the recipe. I think if I would have left out the vinegar and sugar, and tossed in some jalapenos it may have been better. Very sour. Yuk. I am giving it 3 just because my husband ate it. He didn't say a word, and my daughter that eats everything I make asked for a corndog. I will not make this again.

I really liked this recipe.  The chicken is a little on the dry side but in my opinion has plenty of flavor!  I doubled the red wine vinegar and lime juice (3 Tbsp bottled juice 1/4 cup vinegar) based on reviews I read.  I think if you simmer it slowly with the lid on you might not have to double the liquid.  I did not double the seasonings just the liquid and thought it was good.  I might decrease the seasonings next time if I do not double the liquids.

This is a staple in our house!  Everyone loves it and it's easy to fix.  I always add more garlic (3-4 cloves... we love garlic!).  I wait an extra 5 minutes or so before adding the green onions because I prefer them crunchier than wilted.

These were very bland except for the lime flavor that the juice gave them....was wanting something with a few more flavors in it....we will try them again though and vary the recipe a little bit.

This is a great chicken taco recipe.  I skipped the lettuce and cheese and topped with the Avacodo Feta Salsa also from this site and it was a big hit. I recommed giving guests the option of flour versus corn tortillas.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought these turned out pretty good.  However, my boyfriend thought they were a bit too salty for his liking.  When I make them again, I'll reduce or eliminate the salt.  Next time, I'll also include cilantro like many of the reviewers suggested.  A great and easy meal!

This was good, but I was really hoping for a similar flavor as the tacos I get from taquerias. I'd say this recipe a good Americanized taco.

These tacos were absolutely delicious!!!  I made only a few minor changes to the recipe.  First, I doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers.  Next time, I will triple the sauce as I love the flavor and would like a little extra to spoon over the tacos.  I added a little poultry seasoning to chicken while it was cooking for an extra flavor boost.  I used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas, and I warmed them up in a little bit of vegetable oils to make for a more moist taco.  My husband, always wary of my new recipes, was crazy about this one!  A definite keeper!

Pretty good but not quite what I was looking for (on the search for the perfect lime chicken recipe).  I will definitely try again as I was unable to get cilantro or green onion at the local vege market.  I did marinate the meat in the sauce (doubled the sauce) for a couple of hours before cooking which I think helped.  I also used LOTS of lime.

Excellent! I made some changes by adding 3 cloves of garlic finely minced, tablespoon fresh cilantro, juice of a whole lime and a little of the zest. Added lotsa black pepper and 1 tsp of Cumin and a few dashes of garlic powder. Also added a bit more salt and marinated for 3 hours. I then grilled it on my grill pan and made fajitas out of them. sooo good and tender. Marinating the chicken really makes it tender. Had an excellent lime flavor. Thanks so much!!

this is by far the best recipe i have EVER made! i added WAY more lime juice  than it said, and i also added ALOT of cilantro (in my opinion, without the cilantro it was just plain) and i also made my own taco shells with an old recipe i had, so they turned out to be sort of like a chalupa shell from taco bell. makes this recipe 50x better!!!!!

After all the great reviews I think I expected more from this dish. The sauce itself was tasty and made the kitchen smell good, but the sauce imparted little flavor to the chicken. The most prominent flavor once cooked was the black pepper. Overall it was a so-so recipe -- good, but nothing too memorable.

Being a busy work at home mom with an 11 month old baby girl, I am always on the watch for lowfat/easy/quick recipes. This is one of them, it is perfect as is with no changes, it was so flavorful. We had it on handmade flour tortillas from Trader Joe's. Definitely will make again.

YUM!!!  I made this recipe exactly as written except I doubled the sauce as mentioned here in the reviews.  And then I just saute the chicken in the sauce until it is all absorbed or evaporated.  This is soooo flavorful!  I'm amazed at the reviews that say this recipe lacks flavor?  Maybe it's so good because I double the marinade?  We love it - even my 2 year old!!  Use corn tortillas and garnished with the usual:   cilantro, tomato, avocado, cheese, salsa...  It is so good and there are usually no leftovers!  I've even made these 2 days in a row because they sound so good to me!!  I've made these many times since finding this recipe.  Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful! I've been making
chicken tacos for years, and this is the
BEST! I never thought of combining some
of the ingredients. My husband raved about how good they were, even the next 
day. I used corn tortillas, and added my beloved cilantro. Added diced avocado
to the garnish. I'll never make chicken
tacos any other way again.

This was super-tasty and super-easy to put together at the last minute.  Allowing the chicken to marinate in the lime vinaigrette for about an hour deepened the flavors and made the chicken very moist.  Instead of soft tacos, I made quesadillas -- which, after tasting, my son declared them the best EVER.  Thanks so much!

Both my husband and my teenage daughter loved this recipe.  My daughter said "you should make this again".  The only change I made was that I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  The flavors of the red wine vinegar, lime juice, and spices are wonderful.

I just made the chicken and it is divine. I spread some olive oil in a pan, sprinkled the chicken with cumin, cooked the chicken to almost done, then added the rest of the ingredients and cooked until the chicken was done all the way. I did substitute fresh cilantro for the oregano, as others suggested    (and I used a ton because I LOVE it). The chicken is moist and juicy with awesome flavor. I used corn tortillas and added sour cream to the tacos. Simply divine.

This recipe was sooo yummy! I used white onion instead of green because I really like white onion w/ mexican dishes. I also added a little jalapeno and lots of cilantro. It had great flavor and seemed pretty healthy. I will make this again for sure!

Excellent - We used Quorn chicken style chunks for a vegetarian version and they were delicious.

It takes a LOT to impress me, but this recipe did it!  I marinated the chicken for about an hour (added some Fajita Seasoning to the sauce--recipe courtesy of Stephen Raichlen's book "How to Grill" cook book)prior to cooking, baked the breasts whole and then shredded them and threw them back in the pan and mixed with the sauce.  Served with pepper jack cheese--YUM!!

I agree with a couple of earlier reviews that expressed surprise at the number of 5 stars this recipe has received. 

After doubling the lime and vinegar, the chicken was still dry and bland and required a lot of tweaking to meet my tastes. I added a bunch of cilantro (didn't use oregano), added 1/2 tsp of chili powder, cumin, liquid smoke, and about 1/2 cup of beer to juice it up. Then it was delicious! I served it with guacamole as well. Yum.

I decided to make this recipe for a party and made a few changes. Like others, I cut down the cooking time, omitted the oregano, and increased the lime juice. I served the cooked chicken filling on tortilla chips with lettuce and tomatoes, so my guests could build their own nachos. Quick and easy for parties. Next time, I will add more pepper to make it spicier.

This was great, even my picky kids liked it.  I followed the others advise and used cilantro instead of org.  I also sauteed the chicken in a little olive oil.  I forgot to buy green onions, but regular onions worked fine.

This was great especially since you could actually taste the marinade on the chicken.  So often you spend time marinating and flavoring meat, only to be disappointed with the results.  Like other reviewers, I substituted fresh cilantro for the oregano.

How did this recipe get so many 5 star ratings?! My husband and 2 children only shrugged their shoulders when I asked if they liked it. This dish was edible and that's about it. Not great, not awful. The chicken was bland and the only flavors that came through were lime and vinegar. This recipe could be good with ALOT of tweaking, but I've already moved on to a better chicken taco. 
PS. Cooking time is much too long and cilantro (preferrably fresh) should be used instead of oregano.

A great quick meal! I actually had to 1/2 the recipe because I only had short of a pound of chicken thawed. I was making cheese quesadillas for the kids and my husband and I were hogging the chicken when one spied it and wanted a bite. It was all over from there. My 4 kids loved the chicken and kept eating it by itself. The flavor was wonderful and my chicken cubes were small enough that the flavor was able to soak in without marinading. Will be a regular. Oh, I did substitute dried cilantro (mexican oregano) because I was out of oregano. It was great. Will try with oregano next time.

This was a great recipie and my friends and family loved it.  In fact, some friends were house sitting and looked for the recipie to make it while we were gone.  I have found that the longer the chicken sits in the mix the better it tastes, you might have to add some more lime and red wine vinegar, but it is good.

I was not impressed by this recipe. The taste was too bland and the chicken tasted too dry for my liking and I even added extra lime juice. I was looking for an easy, authentic chicken taco recipe and this did not stack up.

Not as great as I thought it would be, cooking time was too long and I didn't care for the oregano taste.  Not too bad on a salad, though!

I was so excited about this recipe because of the rave reviews, but I'm sorry to say it just wasn't that good! I mean - we ate it with no problems, but it certainly wasn't a stand out meal.  The chicken was a little dry.  All the juices from the liquid evaporate away within a few minutes and you're left with dry, lime-flavored nuggets of chicken.  It was ok, but not great.

I thought this was really good.  I used the whole lime because I wasn't getting much out of half.  I also cooked the chicen first and then shredded it.  I put the chicken in a skillet, poured the lime mix over it, and let it heat up for about 10 mins.

I adapted this recipe for my slow cooker - and it sure came out very tasty!  I cooked the chicken as directed and put it together with all the other ingredients in the slow cooker.  I also caramelized some onions and the garlic and added those to the chicken.  Finally I added 2 cups of chicken broth, 1 tsp. of tapioca (to thicken it) and 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes to give it a little heat.  During the last few minutes I shredded the chicken in the pot and served with tortillas, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes and avocado.  Yum!!  Thanks for such a delicious and different recipe!

All I can say is...WONDERFUL. I doubled the recipe and tried it out on a dinner guest, big hit. Nice change from your everday run of the mill tacos. i was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised. This will definately be a recipe I use often. My roomate doesnt even like lime and she loved them. I added avacado and sour cream to the tacos...Delish!!

These were really good. Following other reviewers, I substituted cilantro for the oregano. I sauteed the chicken with yellow onion, and saved the green onion for a topping. Thanks for a keeper!

Easy and yummy! I made these but instead of lime juice, sugar and vinegar, I just threw in a good splash of bottled margarita mix. I also added sliced sweet onions to saute with the chicken (Walla Wallas).

This recipe was awesome!!  My husband made these and I loved them.  He used the salsa with his, but I went without.  They don't taste like lime, it just adds flavor.  Very good!  I will definitely request these again.

I love this recipe.  I have made these so many times.  My husband and I love them, I've also made them for guests and they always like them too.  The only thing I've ever changed is that I don't always have fresh lime on hand, so I've used 1/4 of a cup of bottled lime juice.  It tastes just as good.  Thanks Marissa, this is one of the best recipes I've ever found on this site.

I am rating this a '3' because I found that the taco filling turned out a little dry after following the recipe--I even added more lime juice. I may try again and add a little water and cook for a shorter time.

What a TREAT! This was so good!  Prepared according to recipe and loved it. Served with a choice of flour or corn tortillas. Both were excellent! Also put some crumbled bacon and sour cream on the table along with the other toppings and they were just wonderful!  I did saute the chicken in 1T olive oil since nothing was suggested. Thanks for the post!

I am rating this a 4 because my oldest son and I thought these were way too limey but my youngest son and husband thought they deserved a 5.  I will definetly use less lime juice next time I make these.

Oh my GOSH this good eatin'! I use the juice of two limes for more flavor and substituted fresh cilantro rather than the oregano. My husband and I couldn't get these in our mouths fast enough! Excellent recipe and one I'll be making many times again. Thanks for sharing it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was so fast and simple!  I too used cilantro in place of the oregano and cut 2 chicken breasts into strips instead of cubes; this reduced the cooking time.  The flavor of the chicken is fantastic.  If using more than the equivalent to 2 chicken breasts, you will probably want to increase the quantity of the sauce.  I've added this one to my keeper list and will certainly make this recipe again.

Delicious recipe. I added fresh cilantro as well as the oregano. Served on white corn tortillas with cheese, jalapenos and sour cream. Omitted the lettuce and tomatoes because I think that would take away from the taste. The biggest thing? I used leftover cooked chicken breasts from the night before. Just chopped up the chicken and threw it in a pan with the other ingredients.

Delicious!  I was told about this one by a friend, but it took me a couple of months to make.  I wasn't sure about the mix of ingredients.  However, it was a big hit with my family!

This tasted like something in a restaurant! Tons of flavor.  I took another person's suggestion and marinated the chicken breasts whole for a couple hours, then sauteed them for 5 minutes each side, then added the marinade to the pan and continued cooking the chicken until done.  Then I shredded the chicken with a fork and added back to the pan and cooked until all the marinade was absorbed.  Fantastic lime taste.  If you don't like a lot of pepper you might want to reduce to 1/4 tsp.

This was delicious! My husband and I loved it. We don't normally buy limes, but my husband came home with a few from the store today. It was his way of saying make some more of that! It's a true keeper in our house for sure!
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really easy, and very good.  I ended up having to add some balsamic vinegar as it cooked in the pan since it dried up so quickly, but maybe I had it on too high heat.  (I used a raspberry balsamic, which turned out Fabulous). I'm giving it four stars only cuz we weren't drooling excessively after it, but we were quite pleased. We'll definitely make this one again, Thanks!

Really good. I read some of the reviews and here are my modifications:  1) marinated 2 hours or so.  I think more would overpower the meat. 2) doubled the lime juice as others have done 3) did not add garlic to the marinade but cooked the chicken with it (really good).  4) changed from oregano to basil.  I think next time I will do cilantro to see how that flavors it. I think the receipe tasted exactly how I expected it.  Those that have given it bad reviews maybe were expecting a different taste.

love this but made some changes- i used two limes, 1/4 cup green onions, cut the red wine vinegar in half, and used basil (1/2 tsp) instead of oregano. used brown sugar instead of white (i was out). let the chicken marinate in the mixture for about 30 min while i got everything else ready (used garlic red wine vinegar), drained it to saute the chicken, and used a fresh batch of marinade while simmering (with normal red wine vinegar), if that isn't enough flavor for you add a spoonful of salsa verde while sauteing- wow! i only cooked for about 15 - 20 min total. male roomates devoured this in soft tacos... i am watching my carbs so i put over romaine lettuce with black beans, guacamole, sour cream and cheese and it made a absoltely delicious salad! thanks!

This recipie wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be.  The chicken was very good itself but when put in the taco with everything else it was a bit bland. It need some sort of sauce or something. I also recommend making the chicken ahead of time and letting it marinate for a couple of hours in the fridge, it brings out the flavor a lot more.

Its hard to go wrong with tacos but I found these were very bland. Seasonings like chili powder, cumin, and garlic would deffinately improve these.

Very healthy delicious recipe!  I think that cooking the chicken for 30 minutes is way too long.  You should cook the chicken for about 8 minutes and then after adding the flavoring an additional 10.  This way your chicken won't be over cooked.  Very nice flavor though.

I have printed copies of this recipe for my friends, and they all use it regularly. This is a FANTASTIC recipe - lots of flavor, with a satisfying, subtle heat from the oregano. This is one of the best recipes I have found on this site! If you are thinking of trying this recipe, I would highly suggest that you do!

These were pretty darn good. A little bland but I'd make them again. I really liked the homemade taco shells. I had store bought shells but thought I'd try using the flour tortillas and they turned out awesome!

This recipe is wonderful. I love limes, so I added more, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I quadrupled the recipe, brought it to a party, and it was the first thing gone. Thanks so much!

this was fantastic.  I cooked for a kids birthday party and made both these tacos and beef tacos.  Everyone helped themselves and the non beef eaters enjoyed the variety.  keep the mix warm in a slowcooker and you are good to go:)

Quite good.  I did however double the sugar and lime.  Next time I will add a couple more green onions and possibly some red pepper to spice it up a bit.  I will make this again.

Like others, I combined the vinegar, lime juice (from the whole lime,) sugar, salt, pepper, green onions and garlic, and used that to marinate strips of chicken for several hours.  I skipped the oregano.  After sauteing the chicken in a bit of vegetable oil for 15 minutes the meat was very tasty and perfect to shred for soft tacos!

Yum.  Wonderful flavor.  Daughter's friend came over when it was cooking and said "Your house smells SO good!"

I doubled the recipe and just had a little left over and I put it in a freezer bag in the refrigerator.  By bedtime, that was gone too.

A good recipe.  I didn't taste as much lime flavor as I wanted, and I added the juice of a whole lime instead of half.  Next time I will use more lime.  My roommate also rated this a 4.

Yummy!!  I had planned on making these on Thursday night, but we got a last minute invitation to go out to dinner with some friends of ours.  I had the chicken cut up and marinating in the lime and vinegar mixture (along with the other seasonings), so I left them in the refridgerator all night and made them today (Friday).  Talk about flavorful!!  My husband absolutely loved them.  A good friend of mine got me started on these, and she made them according to the instructions - so my hubby has had them per instuctions and my marinating them and he said that they were great both ways, but letting it marinate and then cooking for 15-18 minutes was delicious!!  Thanks Marissa for such a wonderful and easy recipe!  : )

These tacos were easy and delicious.  They make a quick and tasty weeknight meal.  I marinated the chicken first and only cooked it until it was no longer pink in the center which is like 10 min.  It just wasn't necessary to cook it as long as suggested. Served with spanish rice and a lot of toppings for the tacos.

So you're probably looking at this and wondering if you'll like it. Well you won't know until you try. But WOW!! It is so worth it! Despite making some substitutions and (accidentally) overcooking the chicken, it was spectacular! You can cut on the time needed by chopping vegetables while it is in the pot and by wrapping the flour tortillas in foil and putting them in the oven at 200 degrees F. Honestly, this is excellent chicken and if you think you might like it--you probably will.

These tacos really are as good as everyone says.  I'm so glad I tried them out.  I didn't have any red wine vinager, so I just went again and used straight red wine.  I used chicken tenders instead of regular chicken breasts and my son and husband just loved them.

This was very good! My husband is extra-picky, and even he loved it! We live in Arizona near the Mexican border, and we have a wide variety of Mexican resturaunts, some bad, some good. I love this recipie because the chicken is light, flavorful, and not too heavy or greasy. I will make this again and again!

These were incredible!! I grilled the chicken
on my george foreman grill & then cubed & added to the sauce already simmering on the stove.  I also cooked some thick, center cut bacon.  I got the idea from a mexican restaurant the night before.  It definitely added flavor, served with
soft flour tortillas & they were a hit!!

This was okay, but after reading the great reviews I was expecting better. Not that it wasn't yummy, but don't get your hopes up too high. I made it with corn tortillas and tomatillo salsa. Maybe that's why it wasn't so great... Anyway, worth trying and adding your own twist.

I have made these a few times and they are a new favorite in my house. I have had tacos a million ways from Sunday, and these are definitely unique. The acidy mixture of vingar and lime almost give the chicken an adobo flavor (adobo actually means marinade, so that makes sense!) anyway, I best like these served with traditional corn tortillas. If you want them spicy, try some chopped jalapenos in the chicken, and/or Tapatio sauce on top.

These were good, but for me not worth keeping.  When I make fajitas I'm looking for quick.  I use Lawry's chicken fajita seasoning.  These weren't enough better to make it worth more hassle.

This recipe stood up to being baked instead of sauted, in keeping with our low cholesterol diet.  I did substitute fresh cilantro for the dried oregano, but the chicken really came out great.  Not my favorite recipe ever, but definitely one for the recipe box.

This is a great taco recipe.  The only thing I changed is that I used already grilled, prepackaged, southwestern flavored chicken.  This saved a lot of time and seasoned the tacos well.  I would maybe add sour cream to the toppings.

In my family I have children who are taco critics.  My children thought these where great.  I added a little more lime than the recipe called for :) (the whole lime).

Excellent recipe!  My family loved it!  Goes great with spanish rice!  I found it very easy to prepare and it was ready in a flash.  I did add some chili powder, cumin and cilantro because I am just one who likes to doctor things up a bit.

A very nice, easy taco recipe that utilizes things I always have in my pantry. It is mildly spicy, and those who like more kick can easily add as much as they need. I used pepper jack cheese. Will definitely make again this summer!

My boyfriend and I made for this his mom last week-end.  All of the grown-ups LOVED this recipe.  My boyfriend's finicky ten year-old brother and eight year-old sister ate a lot of the chicken, but wouldn't even try the tortillas or any of the toppings other than the cheese.  We also found the cooking time for the chicken to be too long.  We added the green onion and sauce after just fifteen and then cooked it for only seven minutes more.  Next time we will probably cook it even a little bit less.

These were absolutely scrumptious!  I used the juice of a whole lime in mine and a little extra garlic.  We served them with black beans and rice on the side.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks!

The entire family loved it. I used the juice of a whole lime and have since tried it with shrimp, just as tasty.  No way does this take 50 minutes  While the chicken is going that's when I chop my veggies. 30 Minutes tops.

We didn't like these at all.  The chicken was VERY dry and VERY bland.  How much juice is in "1/2 a lime" anyway?  This could be anywhere from half a teaspoon to half a cup.....

I also thought this recipe was bland. If I ever do make it again, I will substitute cilantro for the oregano.  My husband thought I was making something Italian when he walked into the house and smelled lunch cooking.

This recipe is good for soft tacos, but it is excellent as a quesadilla filling with Colby/Jack cheese.  Just a warning...the aroma it gives off during the initial cooking is SO strong and piercing that it gave both my husband and I terrible headaches!! I'd make it again in a second even so! :)

This recipe was bland to me (even to my kids thought so).  After I made several modifications, it was great.  I added more garlic, onion, lime juice, and stirred about 1/3 cup medium picante sauce into the chicken.  Also, added more salt and some Cummin.

Really enjoyed this one!  My husband and teenaged daughter liked it too.  It might be too spicy for young kids though.  I could see using this as a base for a "Greek Pasta" dish including veggies such as sauteed peppers, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, black olives, cherry tomatoes, and then tossing together with the chicken, some cooked linguini or angel hair pasta and feta cheese.  In fact, that sounds like a plan for dinner on Friday!

These were very good. I would be satisfied going to a good Mexican restaurant and being served these from the menu. Not spicy at all - just good flavor. Definitely recommended. Everybody enjoyed this.

Chicken in this recipe has great flavor.  We ate them more like fajitas than tacos with sauteed onions and peppers.  Even my 2 picky eaters gobbled this up!

This is a great Recipe.  I only changed two things...1.  I used fresh chopped cilantro instead of oregano.  The oregano just didn’t appeal to me in a Mexican taco. And, 2.  I used 4 cloves of garlic because we LOVE garlic in our food.  The lime and vinegar give the chicken a nice tangy, fresh taste.  I added some avocado to my fixings bar as well.  My family devoured this so I will definitely be making it again!

These are awesome!  I make these and usually double everything but the chicken and let the chicken marinade in the ingredients for about 30 minutes before cooking and just cook everything together.  I also sometimes substitute regular chopped onion if that's all I have on hand.  My family loves these tacos, and I get requests to make them every couple weeks.

This was an easy recipe and a refreshing change for dinner.  I did make a couple changes to the recipe. I first boiled the small cubes of chicken then drained the water and saute the chicken with the remaining ingredients I increased  the sauce with  2 limes and omitted oregano for cilantro. I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand so I used apple cider vinegar instead. I added a little extra garlic. I omitted the tomato and the salsa for dietary reasons. I used romaine lettuce finely sliced using mostly the greenest part of the lettuce. This was a delicious and nutritious meal. Thank you!

I used leftover chicken thighs, fresh oregano, and hard tacos, and I added a dollop of sour cream atop each taco, but otherwise followed the recipe. A great way to flavor the chicken for taco filling, and another alternative to make chicken leftovers tasty and appealing! Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted best with flour tortillas.  I used chicken thighs for a richer taste.  Also, I don't like raw tomatoes, Cilantro, or peppers, so I cooked them with the meat.  Definitely needs a good salsa to complete the meal.  Cheese didn't seem to add much flavor.

Enjoyed making this easy dish, taste was outstanding. Next time, I would add more lime juice immediately before serving. Left-overs made a great taco salad the next day. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Doubled the recipe and tripled the sauce.  Used cilantro instead of oregano.  Outstanding result. All of my VERY picky kids loved it.

I followed numerous reviewers suggestions, including marinating the chicken ahead of time and cutting the chicken in strips.  It was good but was not as flavorful as I expected.  Will try again with a spicier salsa.

I made this tonight to the tee with the exception of switching out oregano for cilantro.  I left it at the original setting stating it had ten servings but there was not enough chicken for a family of four.

Pretty good.I think next time I would add some water to create a bit of a sauce. The chicken was a little dry.  Flavour was nice. I added a tiny bit of cilantro to make a little more mexican.   I also had guacamole as an optional topping.

it was a great fast dish. All 5 of my kids and my husband loved it.  That seals the deal for me! :) I didn't put oregano in it, I added some cumin instead. And I added cilantro to the tacos along with some avocado and lettuce. Great taste! :)

This was a great recipe!  We loved the lime with the chicken.  I made this recipe as written, but substituted cumin for the oregano.   Next time I will increase the cumin to 2 tsp.  The fact that it was easy to make in addition to being tasty is another reason to make it again. :-)

Insanely good! I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted with apple cider vinegar and added a little extra sugar. Also no oregano so I used fresh rosemary that I just happened to have. Topped with ranch, oh so good! Will make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I would never have put oregano and lime together but added with all the other ingredients it was really good. It was easy and fast too. An excellent meal for a weeknight! I also added cilantro in the tortilla, yum.

I made this. My husband and I loved it !
I used 1 1/4 lb chicken, cubed and all of the lime juice from 1 lime. Didn't have green onions, just used regular yellow.
Will be passing it along to my children.

Like others, I substituted cumin for the oregano. I increased the lime juice and added some chili powder for more taste, as I found it a little bland. I sliced the chicken thinly and sautéed it, then added the juice and spices. I served it as a deconstructed taco in a bowl, with basmati rice with lime zest and parsley, (not a cilantro fan), black beans,  cheese, olives, tomatoes and green onions on top, with guacamole on the side. This was a great meal and I’m making it again tonight!

I made this once as is and it was okay. That is why I give it 3 stars. 

The second time I doubled the sauce and that was definitely a must. I also used a normal onion rather than green onions and cilantro rather than oregano. 

My complaint is that it still didn't taste lime-y enough, so next time I will double the lime. I may also add a tiny amount of cumin as well.

Yum - did as other reviewers suggested - subbed in fresh cilantro for the oregano and used a whole lime. I cooked a whole chicken in the crockpot in advance and then shredded it. Used soft corn tortillas. Had leftover chicken so used in a Tex-Mex soup found on this site the next day. 
Great recipe - thanks!

These tacos were so delicious and easy to make. I chopped up half of a white onion and added it to the chicken a few minutes before the other ingredients and also served them with lime wedges to squeeze on top. Corn tortillas were good with this recipe, but I would like some kind of sauce to drizzle on top as well, and i think next time i will end up shredding the chicken.

We ended up with cilantro instead of oregano and I'm guessing it is even better that way. Also, I used the pan that we cooked in to warm my shells. I have to be gluten free and the corn ones tend to fall apart but these held together great and had extra kick of flavor. Great and quick recipe!!

Neither my husband or myself cared for this recipe.  What resulted from this recipe isn't anything close to any taco I've ever eaten.  I used corn instead of flour tortillas.  I didn't add the oregano because I don't care  for it.  I tried adding cilantro on my taco and even that was no help.

we loved them! absolutely wonderful, light not heavy like beef tacos. I didn't put the oregano in though, and I put serachi  sauce in them because I like a little kick in mine.  We had cantelope for desert. 
oh yeah, i put more than just lettuce, i shredded some carrots and minced up a few veggies. next time i will try some black beans and corn.

I loved making these for me and my family it's a light and healthy meal and the only thing I added was a little bit of chipotle seasoning and cilantro. The cilantro was definitely key in amped up the lime flavor

I have made this several times, never any leftovers.  Great flavor. I always replace cilantro for the oregano. I also cut back the cooking time by about 10 minutes.

I've been meaning to try these because the picture looks delicious and I was quite disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The sauce is skimpy but the red wine vinegar adds some nice flavor. May try swapping cilantro for the oregano and adding more lime juice. Overall not a bad recipe.

Tried this recipe after a recommendation from a friend.  My 3 young children plus my husband and I loved it!  It's fresh and has a "zing" because of the lime and vinegar, but isn't spicy.  I typically quadruple the seasonings (everything but the chicken) to give it max flavor and cooking liquid.

Chicken tastes amazing. 
Some of the reviewers have commented about 'kick'. Well that's a personal choice.  If you want a kick just add to salsa. Before deciding on a recipe, try once just as it is.  It's a great recipe with flavours in it. 
Next time I will try BBQ with same ingredients. I think it can be used for sandwiches too.  Thank you for sharing ??

YUM!  Great flavor!  DISCLAIMER:  I don't review recipes unless I follow them closely, with only minor alterations (using jarred garlic vs. fresh, for example).  As an Allrecipes user, I get so frustrated with "It was great! (or awful)... I changed XYZ to ABC"-- you read the review and it's not even close to the same recipe.  That being said:  REVIEW:  I made this for my daughter's volleyball team potluck of 35 people.  It is refreshingly different from standard shredded chicken recipes (so tired of 'salsa chicken').  I made 7.5 lbs of chicken and used Allrecipes 'servings adjuster'.  I used bottled lime juice instead of fresh, Mexican oregano instead of regular, jarred minced garlic instead of cloves.  I cooked it in a Ninja cooking system on medium stovetop, then flipped it to low slow cooker until I had time to shred it.  I didn't think there was going to be enough liquid, but after it was cooked & shredded, the liquid was perfect--not dry or sloppy.  A nice alternative to standard "cumin/green chili/salsa" chicken recipes.  If you are looking for a strong, spicy, "taco" flavored recipe, this isn't for you.  It's delicate and fresh with great blends of flavor,  it's healthy and low sodium (no packages!), assuming you have it on a salad instead of a tortilla.  We added toppings (hot sauce, cilantro, etc.) and served per our personal preference.   This has been requested by my teens to have on hand for lunches and after school.

This is a great base to start with. I made a marinade using the ingredients up to the garnishments by increasing the stated amounts by 4 and then placing the cubed chicken in the marinade for 1 hour. I then poured the entire contents in a sauce pan and sauteed until the chicken was thoroughly cooked. Instead of red salsa I made a mango avocado salsa to replace the red salsa and used mild cheddar cheese. The taste was unbelievable?

I've made this several times now and it has become a new family favorite. So easy to make and so delicious! 

The first time I made it exactly according to recipe. Since then, I have omitted the green onion and have added some chopped  regular onion in with the chicken instead. (It is equally good and I rarely have green onions on hand, but I usually have regular onion.) 

I think the cooking times in the recipe are a little long. I just cook till the chicken and onions are almost done, add the sauce ingredients, then cook a little longer till the sauce starts to thicken.

WOW the flavors! This was so simple to make, but the flavors were so intense. I used premade chicken I had shredded and followed the rest of the recipe exact. I had everything on hand and we will be making it again. Nothing bland about this recipe. Thanks!

Not too thrilled about the sauce. I love red wine vinegar but I think the combination just made it to tart and I did substitute the oregano for cilantro but everything else was the same. I would have preferred more of a lime taste and maybe a thicker sauce but that's just me.

like other reviews, I did change a few things....added garlic and sweet onion with the chicken, omitted the oregano, used a little cumin and Chipotle chili powder, also added a spoon of diced Chipotle, used more lime juice than original recipe, a little fresh cilantro.... still used the green onion also....first time I made it I forgot the sugar.....it was fine without it....made it again tonight, ran out of soft tortillas, just used crunchy shells...still very good.... definitely will be making again

This was better than I thought it would be. I substituted leftover rotisserie chicken, balsamic vinegar, and red onion and didn't add the oregano. I also added cilantro and avocado with the  cheese, tomato and lettuce. Very tasty and I'll definitely be making this again.

Very good, made it just as it was written and my husband said he'd easy it again. We did add avocado and didn't have any salsa!

This had a fantastic flavor! I doubled the sauce and used rotisserie chicken to save time. As many reviewers said, I used cilantro. Sour cream was a nice addition too.

I really like the flavor of the chicken, it's light, sweet without being too sweet and has a very nice kick of lime to the end of it. Great non-spicy alternative for people at a table who are not fans of traditional pepper-heavy mexican food(why you wouldn't be I still have no hope in understanding, but still). Great recipe for the chicken alone that you could probably use for a bunch of other dishes.

This is a delicious dish. I used the original ingredients but used my own measurements to my liking. Making it my own. I would recommend using extra lime. Brings more flavor out of this dish! Enjoy!

I love this recipe. I have been put on a very strict diet and I'm not  allowed red meat or spicy food(taco seasoning). This makes sticking to my diet so much easier and I enjoy it about once a week. 
Thank you so much for sharing.

The flavor was a bit too strong for me.  I only used 2 chicken breasts so maybe if I'd used more , the chicken to seasoning ratio would have been better.  I did it in crock pot and the  chicken was very juicy and shredded nicely.

My husband absolutely LOVED these. He even ate the left over chicken the next day rolled into leaf of lettuce like a wrap with nothing else on it. I used FRESH cilantro instead of oregano. I chopped up some extra cilantro and sprinkled it on top of the tacos. I put sour cream and guacamole on mine. He had them exactly the way the recipe suggested. When he tried a bite of mine,  he exclaimed, "Yours taste even better!" So maybe serve them with guac and sour cream as a side option. Garnish with a lime!

Very good recipe..I traded out oregano for cilantro..This was a welcome change from my recipe which I use alot of darker spices. This was a lighter meal.  A keeper for sure.

I followed the recipe exact and although it had great flavor I felt like it was lacking something. Perhaps a splash of tequila as others suggested? Not sure. Probably will not be making again.

It was beyond delicious, I also added some fresh cilantro and it was beyond tasty. I made it in a Quesadillas instead of a taco so it could stay together and must say it was delicious!  A little extra garlic and green onion and it was perfection especially with the Monterey jack cheese

Very good, a nice lighter alternative to the traditional beef tacos.   I replaced the oregano with cumin and added cilantro.  Next time I'll add chili powder as well, as I felt it needed a little more heat to balance the tartness of the lime.   I used 2 lbs of chicken breast, cut into thin strips; doubled all the sauce ingredients; and cooked in the crockpot on High for about 3 hours.    Keeper recipe!

Absolutely delicious!
I doubled the recipe and put everything in the crockpot for 5 hours.  I initially wanted to shred it and then put it in for another half hour, but didn't get home in time.  Still delicious, but although a tad dry.  So next time I may triple sauce and do less time in crockpot.  Had cheese, lettuce, refried beans, and sour cream with it.  Yum!

Delicious! My boyfriend loved it- he says it's something he can eat every day and never get sick of.

Changes:
- cut chicken breast into strips instead of cubes
- Added 2x lime
- Used whole yellow onion instead of 2 green onions
- Added 2x amount of red wine vinegar

This was a HUGE hit in my house! I changed a few things, nothing major. Instead of oregano I used fresh cilantro, raw sugar instead of white sugar, handful of shredded sharp cheddar cheese cooked in with chicken mixture and used the ingredients to taste rather than measurement. Which means I used more lime, vinegar and green onion then what the recipe called for. Great dinner, I absolutely will make this again!!!!!

Bookmark this one. We cut the chicken into strips instead of cubing it, added a little tequila and juiced a whole lime instead of half. Delicious!  We made this recipe a second time and used cabbage (drizzled with a little red wine vinegar, salt and pepper), fresh cilantro, fresh tomatoes and feta cheese as toppings. This created a whole new twist on an already fantastic recipe.

We made it exactly the way it says to and everyone loved it, except me. Lol. It was not bad, I could eat it, but I am not a huge fan of vinegar and you could definitely taste it in this recipe. If it were not for that I would give it five stars because my children even liked it. That's saying something.

Great recipe, very tasty. I agree with others who say skimp on the oregano. I also skip the red wine vinegar and its quite good.

Absolutely delicious, mouth watering tacos!  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine which made them even more tangy, gourmet and amazing!

Yum! These really were so delicious and so easy to make. The chicken only took about 10 minutes to cook through and brown. I mixed all the other ingredients together separately and then added the marinade to the chicken. I added jalapenos as well for a little kick. Topped with cabbage slaw, more lime, tomato, and salsa...yum!!!

I added more lime and  a bit of corn starch to thicken the juices.  At the very end I also added in drained black beans.

I love this recipe!  Thank you so much!  It's officially on my 'go-to dinner' list.  I am a huge fan of the crock pot so I followed the review that suggested to use it and it's quick and awesome, no need to supervise it!  I even forgot to thaw my chicken so added it frozen - after 3 hours on high I was able to shred it and leave it in longer to absorb.
AWESOMER!

This was a winner for our family.  I did not put oregano in it and marinated the chicken in the sauce ahead of time. I grilled it on the grill pan served with homemade salsa and guac.    The lime is not overpowering and tenderizes the meat.  It is a must try!

This recipe is a keeper! I was doubting about adding the vinegar but then opted to add it just a bit less and it was perfect! Next time, I will make it as others suggest here by shredding the chicken instead of cubing the chicken. I also love sour cream so I added a little and yummy. By the way,I used in addition cilantro and before cooking marinated the chicken with the lemon, garlic, salt, pepper, and fresh herbs and only added the oregano when I was simmering the chicken to avoid oregano becoming a bit sour for overcooking it. This recipe deserves all the stars!

Divine.Simple to make since I had all the ingredients on hand. Used corn tortillas instead of flour ones. Used fresh garden tomatoes instead of salsa. I made half the recipe which my husband and I devoured. 
Toasted the corn tortilla in the toaster, better than using an extra pan.

I made this with only one change-- the oregano ( I also used the chicken from Costco that was deboned from the rotisserie chickens. I just put the ingredients in a pan, brought it to a boil, then added the pre-cooked chicken. Then I turned off the heat and let it sweat for about 5-10 minutes while I prepared the tortillas in a cast iron skillet. I put the cheese on the tortilla to let it melt, and then added the chicken. To be honest, it didn't need all the fluff. it was perfect with just the meat and cheese. But my kids added the tomatoes, chopped romaine lettuce, cilantro (yes more cilantro.....fresh on top of the cooked cilantro with the chicken), and parmesan cheese ( we added about a tablespoon of fresh grated parmesan cheese sprinkled on top of a grated Mexican grated cheeses). no sour cream or salsa needed---it was that good!!! ) --I added fresh cilantro instead of the oregano when I cooked the chicken and fresh cilantro, in the end on top of the tacos ( about 2 tablespoons). Other than that, I made it according to the orginal directions. My family said "this was a taco comparable to the taco truck!! Best chicken taco you have made so far mom!" Thank you for the recipe. I will be making it again on Friday for my kids' friends (in 2 days). It was a big hit!!

My roommate and I are self proclaimed taco extraordinaires. I was a little skeptical about the simplicity of the seasoning (and the red wine vinegar) , but I must say, these tacos were amazing. I added extra lime juice to the pan while cooking. Added avocado to the toppings. Paired with black beans, these were a HIT. Will definitely make these again.

I made this into a crock pot version.  I also doubled this recipe except I didn’t add the green onion.  If anything I think it would be used as a garnish so I left it out.  Otherwise I kept the recipe the same.  Anyways, I added a 3 lb bag of frozen chicken and then the rest of the ingredients and set it on low.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours and it was done.  Of course you can cook it a little longer and it would be fine.  I took it out and shredded the chicken.  Then assembled with taco cheese, lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes, a bit more lime juice, and taco sauce.  Perfect!  I made enough for another meal hence the double recipe.  I will add a shake of chili seasoning to it and give it a bit of a kick.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I left out the oregano because I thought it sounded a bit strange, added some cilantro and used white wine vinegar because it was what I had. Other than that I followed the directions exactly. I served it on soft corn tortillas.

Super easy to make, and fast too.  I followed the recipe as is, maybe next time I'll add a little bit more lime.  I thought it was a great summertime meal.  Hubby thought so too.

Delicious ... very tropical feel with the lime juice.  Recommend getting pan very hot and thin strips of chicken.  They cook and brown really well!

I really like this recipe, but I find you need to add the juice of a whole lime. I like the oregano flavour. Also, this time I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I subbed rice wine vinegar (just added a bit more) and I think I liked it better!

Wow!  I love chicken tacos and these are awesome!  I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar for the red wine vinegar since that's what I had on hand.  I also used one whole lime and cut up half a vidalia onion instead of using green onions.  Thanks for sharing this easy and delish recipe!

Was so yummy!! I used dried cilantro instead of oregano since that's what I had. Also used fresh corn tortillas and made homemade guacamole. Amazing!!

This has become my weekly Taco Tuesday dish! I leave out the vinegar. I also add cilantro instead of oregano, and the juice of a whole lime instead of half. I also add mini sweet peppers in with the chicken. YUM :)

Yummy! I did leave out the oregano, and added fresh cilantro; otherwise, followed recipe exactly...and it's a keeper! Kinda sad we didn't have any leftovers for my lunch the next day! I do believe I will double the recipe next time!! Thanks for this one!

Loved these, but I used Mexican Oregano which is probably what the recipe should call for, and I also added cilantro.  And rather than bland flour tortillas, I used soft corn tortillas that I briefly grilled over a gas flame. About the size of the recipe...it says 10 servings, which doesn't mean 10 people, unless you are feeding children.  One taco isn't enough for most adults.  I'd say the recipe serves two adults and three or four children.

I would call it good but not great.  We eat a lot of tacos so we have high standards.  I did substitute cilantro as suggested and I appreciated the speed with which I could get this on the table on weeknight.

It was for sure good, but didnt blow my mind or anything. I double the ingredients and the chicken went quickly. I would still male it again. I also put corn and brown rice into the tacos.

Very good---a great change from beef tacos. Didn't have Oregano and it was fine without it. The lime really added a zing. Will make again!

These tacos were very delicious. However, I did not add the full tablespoon of salt the recipe called for which would have been way too much. I also added another tablespoon of sugar and a little more lemon. And the chicken did not take 20 minutes to cook. These minor adjustments made for a fabulous Cinquo de Mayo dinner!

Only change was to use cilantro instead of oregano.  I think I prefer traditional tacos - not the fault of the recipe it's just a personal taste.

Overall this was a hit. I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand (used leftover poached shredded chicken; white wine vinegar instead of red; yellow onions instead of green). My husband and one of my 5-year-olds loved it; my other 5-year-old and myself liked it. If I make it again, I will use cumin instead of the oregano and might add cilantro.

These were decent. I liked the lime flavor but they were dry because they didn't need to cook that long. I also added 1/2 tsp of cumin and some cilantro and omitted the oregano as per other reviewers.

I had some leftover roasted turkey breast (14 oz.), so I diced it and simmered the diced turkey with the vinegar and lime juice seasoning mixture in the proportions listed in the recipe in a small saucepan, covered, for 10 minutes, but substituting some sweet white onion for the green onions and omitting the oregano because I had no cilantro. I also substituted grated Mexican blend cheese for the Monterey Jack and warmed the tortillas in the microwave oven. The results were great and my husband, whose usual answer to my question, "How did you like...?" is, "It's good," said, "It was actually quite good," with some surprise in his inflection. For him that's saying something!

I marinated the chicken pieces in the vinegar/lime mixture with the green onions and garlic, and also added cumin to give it more of a taco taste.  It was still a bit bland, but overall this is a really simple and good recipe.  One to keep and play around with a little more.

Such bright fresh flavors in this one. We topped these with sliced avocado, sour cream, salsa, & shredded cheese. I made a cilantro lime rice that went perfectly with this.

I've had this recipe saved for a long time now, I was hesitant about making these cause my BF is not a huge fan of lime like I am... I decided to take a chance and make these for dinner few weeks ago, and WOW- I can't believe how much I've been missing out on! The marinade for the chicken was delicious and the lime was very, very subtle! This is definitely one of my families favorite meals now!!

This was so good.  I changed it just a bit.  I used all the lime juice like some other reviewers, and I replaced the oregano with cilantro.  I also doubled the garlic and used a yellow onion instead of green onions.  Will definitely make this again.

This was a very good recipe and will make again. Like a lot of recipes I tweaked it to what I had on hand:)  I added red pepper because I had one that needed to be used soon, used white onion(thats what I had), and added cilantro. I didn't have a lot of lime juice so I substituted zero calorie non alcoholic margarita mix and left out the sugar.

This turned out good, but I ended up just adding lettuce, tomato, and ranch and making wraps intead of tacos.  I omited the oregano and sauteed the chicken in oil with seasoned salt, garlic powder, and cumin.  30 minutes for cubed chicken is way too long.  It should be more like 15 total.   The red wine vinegar gives it a flavor that was just not good for tacos in my opinion, but more lime juice may help.  It would be good over rice though!

This chicken recipe is awesome!  So simple, yet so delicious.  I doubled it, but kept only one tsp of sugar and added more lime juice and salt.  New go-to chicken tacos for show!

This recipe was easy and quick.  However, it was a little bland for our tastes.  We did need to spice it up for a more flavorful taco.

I use this recipe a lot and also put it in the crock pot as other reviews noted. I double the amount of lime, add a little extra garlic and green onions, and also add water/chicken broth since the chicken can dry out. It's great to pair it with jalapeno poppers (as the app).

I throw it all in the crockpot with a little chicken broth and a little salsa and let it cook on low all day. The chicken just falls apart when shredded. I fry wontons into taco shape instead of using tortillas. Very yummy!!

Really loved this recipe.  Easy, with lots of flavor.  We added a roasted poblano pepper, chopped with the sauce.  We also had chopped cilantro as an option with the toppings.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe substituting Cilantro for Oregano. 

This is the best chicken taco filling that I have ever had! My husband doesn't like chicken, but made a taco with it anyway. He said it was good.

The lime juice and vinegar combination was very nice on the tacos.  I added about 1/3 C chopped cilantro to the chicken when it was done cooking.  Also I made a chipotle sour cream to with it.  A few slices of avocado cooled the heat of the sour cream.  Great Cinco De Mayo meal!

I made this following the recipe. The oregano was a little odd but I didn't mind it. I'll leave it out next time. I deep fried my own hard shells and added fresh cilantro. 

A three because it's a good base recipe that I'll continue to use.

I was looking for something quick to use up some leftover rotisserie chicken. I was a little skeptical but chose this recipe because I actually had everything on hand.  We were VERY pleasantly surprised.  Made it as-is and it tasted wonderful.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Made exactly as written, and it's great! Husband and I both loved these. I do agree that it doesn't seem to make 10 servings...at least, not using a soft taco sized tortilla. Perhaps with a small corn tortilla. Served @ 6 the way I made them.
I like the idea of putting it in the crock pot. I will try that this next time.

I was looking for a chicken recipe for some chicken burritos and came across this one. It really couldn't have worked out better! I replaced the oregano with fresh cilantro (duh!) and pretty much followed all other directions exactly. Highly recommend, very tasty and different!

This is really good. If you do not like vinegar then go lightly.  I thought cooking the chicken for 20 mins was to long, I would cook it about 10 mins and then continue with the recipe.

Great fast and easy dinner for the family.  I grilled the chicken first before adding into a skillit with the remainder of the ingredients.  I also added a touch of sour cream inside the soft tacos prior to serving.

I made this last night for a party and it was a hit!  I did change some things though-I used precooked chicken that I heated in the mircowave.  I cut the chicken breasts into cubes, put in a skillet, and then added the other ingredients.  I used red onions instead of green and I did double the sauce.  It was very flavorful and people really enjoyed it.

This is the third time I've made this. I love this recipe. We tried it in lettuce wraps last night. I still think it's best in a tortilla, but if you're cutting back on wheat a lettuce wrap is very tasty. I added more garlic and more green onions and I definitely didn't cook for as long as stated.

PHENOMENAL!!!! My family absolutely loves this and so do I! I usually quadruple the recipe and use about 7-10 chicken breasts. I don't change any of the ingredients though. Just throw it all in the crock pot for 7 hours or so and you have a fantastic meal! We eat it on tortillas with spanish rice. TO DIE FOR!

I liked this very much and is kid friendly since it's not spicy. My 7 y.o. ate it right up. I think it could benefit from green chiles...and maybe a few optional jalepenos on the side. I altered slightly by adding just a little spanish rice to the filling. I used fresh salsa instead of jarred. Really really nice!

Soo easy and soo good.  Son is going back to college today and is taking this recipe with him.  Healthy also.  We don't even use the cheese.  I use cilantro instead of oregano.  You can even leave the sugar out.  I forgot to put the sugar in and it tasted good.  It does taste a little better after the sugar is added, so if you want to omitt the sugar it is even healthier.

My family LOVES these!  I don't even like meat much but these are awesome.  I put everything in the crockpot together for approx 5 hours and they are SO quick and easy to make this way.  I took a recommendation from one of the other reviews to use cilantro (have tried dried & fresh - both were fine) instead of oregano and love it!

Ok.  My famiily are real Tex-Mex fans and this was a little bland,  Also dry, so I added some olive oil and chickenen broth to help saute the meat.

Tastes good. A little bland. Would double the "sauce" next time and maybe marinate the chicken in it. Needs a little more spice to it. Halved the recipe and it made supper for 2 by itself, not 5.

These had a great flavor but I think it would be much better with some sort of seafood like shrimp or fish tacos rather than chicken.  Next time I may try them with seafood and see if I like it better that way.  I added extra lime juice and used cilantro instead of oregano.

These were fab! Like most people, I used cumin and ciliantro in place of the oregano, but everything else was the same. Well, ok....I used a whole lime....hahaha. do yourself a favor and quarter some on-the-vine cherry tomatoes for the topping! The taste of these tacos were seriously delicious. I just made them tonight and am already considering making them again tomorrow. Yummmmeeee!

These were pretty tasty. I made it like so many of the other reviewers and used cumin and cayenne instead of the oregano. I just couldn't bring myself to add the oregano to it-it just didn't seem to belong! I cooked the chicken in the sauce mixture insteado sauteing it seperately and then shredded it and added it back to the pan and let it simmer there for a little bit longer. We used rotel lime and cilantro tomatoes on top and threw on some sour cream and guac as well. Went great with mexican rice, some corn and a beer!

This was easy and had good but subtle flavor. I gave it 4 stars because the flavor was a little bland for my taste. I also used cilantro like others. I'm not real crazy about oregano.My kids and husband liked it. I was real happy to find a taco recipe that didn't have the traditional cumin taco flavor. I sliced up some avacado and that went perfect with the other toppings! Thanks

Fantastic!  I didn't cook the chicken as long as directed because I didn't want it dried out, but otherwise this recipe is spot on!  Also added guac and couldn't ask for it to be better.

The flavor was good just not for tacos, had to add taco seasoning. Would be great with marinara sauce or in a lasagna.

These chicken tacos were EXCELLENT!  They were easy to make and, best of all, I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions, I halved the salt & I replaced the oregano with cilantro.  Delicious!  I will be making these again and again.

This was just ok. I did it in the slow cooker and omitted the sugar and oregano, added cayenne and cumin as per other reviewers suggestions. With all the toppings it came out well but it wasn't spectacular. I will try it on the stove when I have more time.

Great recipe!! Nice change to the ordinary chicken tacos. The tang from the red wine vinegar was wonderful!! I added a few extra spices to the chicken before cooking. I used a little cheyenne, red pepper flakes and cumin. Also decided to saute the onions and garlic with the chicken during the last part of cooking. Dont be afraid to add olive oil to the chicken as it cooks. It added a nice crispy flair to the chicken. I left the chicken breast whole then chopped/shredded before serving. On the second day we decided to put it over salad with fresh cilantro. Will make this again and again!! Thanks again for the great recipe!!

It's ok.  Enjoyable when you add all the toppings to the taco, but the chicken itself wasn't amazing.  I think there are better recipes out there.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I just threw it into the slow cooker and shredded the chicken. I used the full lime instead of half. Then I made the wraps, using spinach instead of lettuce and put it in the oven until the outside was crispy and the cheese was melted. (about ten minutes)

Made this for an employee appreciation party.  Recieved rave reviews.  I just put the ingredients in a ziploc bag the night before and stuck in the refrigerator.  Then got up the next morning, emptied into a crockpot and cooked on low all day.  Chicken was so tender it shredded easily.  Everyone loved this and I have had several requests for the recipe.

Mmm Mmm Mmm!!!  Delish!  Didn't really know what to expect, but I LOVE the outcome!  Nixed the oregano and added fresh cilantro to the cooking chicken, and used white onion in place of green.  Cooked the onion w/ salt and cumin.  Marinated chick in 2x sauce recipe, and added 1x sauce to cooking chicken.  Easy on the pepper!

I love this chicken, although I do it a little different than most I think.

I sautee the whole breasts in a couple Ts of EVOO on medium heat until the outsides are somewhat golden brown. Then I move them to a cutting board and cut them into thin (1/2 in) strips where you'll see the inside is still raw. Then add them back into the pan with the vinegar and everything else and sautee for about 10 more minutes or until all the juices are [mostly] soaked up.

Also, more lime helps. This recipe is delicious!

I liked the recipe, but it didn't say how to saute' the chicken. I used canola oil. I made the recipe for four sevrings and use a 1/4 cup of lime as I am lime crazy. I used cummin in place of oragano. And to serve we used sour cream. What I really liked was the heated tortlillas. I heat until they had very brown blisters which give a very nice flavour. I wll be making this again. Very good! Three cheers to the cook who sent this in.

I swapped out the oregano for cilantro. Very subtle flavor-nothing overly exciting by itself but topped w/all the fixins, it was very good! A good, solid recipe.

I thought these were awesome!!  I added the ingredients to the crock pot and let it cook for 3 hours.  I shredded the chicken and let it soak up the juices about an hour before serving.  I also did not use the oregano.  I added cumin, doubled the lime,  and lots of fresh cilantro (because I love cilantro).  We will definitely add this to our rotation!  It has lots of flavor but is very light tasting.

This chicken has an awesome flavor! Next time I won't simmer an extra 10 minutes though. I tasted the chicken about 5 minutes through the simmering and it was so yummy and moist. After the full 10 minutes it was a little overcooked, and I had good sized chicken chunks. However, ingredient-wise, this is a great recipe with things I usually have on-hand anyway.

I wouldn't say that the chicken was very limey, but it was very tasty.  No need to cook the chicken for 20 minutes, just until it's no longer pink.  I think that may be a mistake in the recipe.

Really wonderful flavor, and a nice change from boring chicken.  I was looking for a new chicken recipe, and this fit the bill.  In order to chop the chicken quickly, I left the breasts slightly frozen.  I did not have any green onion on hand, but yellow onion worked very well.  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

Was very filling. The family enjoyed the tacos. Added Cilantro to the recipe. Next time I would chop the chicken into smaller pieces.

Chicken had great flavor. I cooked mine in the crock pot all day and added cilantro along with the oregano. The chicken was so tender! The only thing I would do different next time would be to double the sauce.

Made this recipe as written minus the oregano (it seemed a bit odd to me) - it's pretty darn good!  The chicken comes out very soft and flavorful.  I didn't pat my chicken breasts dry before starting, so there was a bit more liquid after cooking than I would have liked.  Perhaps next time I'll actually try the oregano?

I made this dish for last night's dinner, and it turned out really well.  The tacos were full of flavor, and were a nice change from traditional beef tacos.  I did add cumin and coriander as additional spices, in order to give the recipe a more traditional Mexican taste, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I also used a full lime rather than a half, which made the chicken a BIT too lime-y for me, though my boyfriend seemed to like the amount of lime flavor in the chicken.  Either way, I would definitely make this again.

This lived up to my every expectation.  And that is just so lovely to have a recipe work so well.  Very flavorful!  I did make minor changes.  I subtituted regular onion for green onions, as sugested.  Also, as sugested, I tripled the sauce and added some of it to the chicken in the final minute or two of cooking.  Lovely.

Very, very good. It's so simple but it goes so fast that I have started making double and triple batches of this every time.  I use the leftovers as filling for empanadas.

I loved this, but with modifications.  I doubled the sauce ingredients, omitted the oregano, added 1 tsp. cumin and some chili powder and chopped fresh cilantro.  I also grilled the chicken breasts first until just past the pink stage inside, then shredded them.  Then, I added the sauce to the shredded chicken and sauteed it all together in a skillet.  I served it all in my home-made wheat tortillas.........YUMMMM!

We enjoyed this a lot.  I switched out oregano for cilantro.  I also would use a whole lime.  Cooked in crockpot in 3 hrs, not sure I will do that again.

Delicious! Here's what I did differently: cut chicken into thin strips, fried the chicken in about 1/8 cup tequila and a little olive oil until no longer pink on the outside, added the lime juice (from 1 whole lime) then the rw vinegar and seasoning, omitted oregano and added cumin and cilantro, and cooked it until done. Will definitely make it again.

Yummy!  A great change from regular tacos, and it makes me want to become a red-meat-aterian. I didn't have any red wine vineagar, so I used rice vinegar instead.  I learned that rice vinegar is a very mild vinegar, so you can often sub it for other vinegars with good results.  Overall, it was an awesome recipe.  Next time, I may double the lime and maybe add 1/2 teaspoon chili powder.  I used about half as much black pepper as called for, and used wayyy more lettuce due to personal preference.  I added Mexican Rice II to the tacos, and it was a nice touch that balanced out the flavors.  It was a quick, easy meal that could easily just be thrown in the crock pot all day and be great.

LOVED these tacos! Threw everything in a crock pot and they were divine. Don't add lime until the end if you use the crock pot because it can taste funny if cooked for too long. I left all the spices as the recipe called for and I thought that the oregano was yummy, won't change it. My neighbor came over for leftovers and was amazed. She said "my tacos NEVER taste this good" this is a keeper for sure.

VERY good recipe.  Used cilantro instead of oregano as suggsted by other reviewers and added a few other seasonings to make it spicy.  Also, boiled and shredded the chicken so it captures more flavor.

Excellent. Made a few changes -- splenda instead of sugar, used the whole lime, added a little bit of crushed red pepper. Used whole wheat tortillas. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes chicken soft tacos.

I used leftover pork instead of chicken and I used more lime juice, very yummy!

These were delicious. I doubled the sauce and used fresh cilantro instead of oregano. This is a keeper!

I really enjoy this recipe.  I did have to alter it a bit though.  First, the cooking time was too long for my cubed chicken on med high.    Next time I will cook the chicken with out the sauce for 15 instead of 20 minutes.  I also cooked the onion (regular onion instead of green) and garlic with the chicken and omitted the oregano.    Next time I will double the sauce ingredients, and quadruple the amount of lime, using two full limes. Lastly, I will add a pinch of cayenne pepper for kick.

As it is, this recipe is exceptional! My family and I have it at least twice a month. I add a little extra vinegar and lime to pep up the flavor, but other than that, the recipe stays the same and we love it!!

This is one of our favorite dinners. I like to boil the chicken then shred it. I then simmer it in the sauce. I add more vinegar and lime and a dash of cumin. We top ours with fresh cilantro and a little salsa. So fabulous it doesn't need anything else!

I used frozen chicken breasts and cooked them in a covered pan for 15-20 minutes over medium heat.  Then I shredded the chicken and threw it back in the pan to cook for the 10 minutes with the seasonings.  Turned our great!  Easy and yummy!

These tacos are really great! I use a whole wheat tortilla and it really makes for an amazing healthy meal. Also, as someone else suggested, I threw everything in the crockpot for a couple hours and it was absolutely perfect. I also added one more lime, these tacos are fabulous.

This was pretty tasty, however I had to add some spices to it because the base recipe did not have a lot of flavor outside the lime.  I marinated for a couple of hours then threw it all together in a skillet.  I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  That is what I had on hand plus I think those are more moist in tacos/enchiladas.  I spiced up with cumin, garlic powder and salt/pepper.  I will make again but next time I will add lots more seasoning maybe even a package of taco seasoning.

This is SO delicious. One of my favorites from this site. I agree with the others who said that the original serving amount (10) is really more appropriate for 3-4 adults. Or maybe it's just so delicious that we all eat more of it than we should. :)

These were good and just the right about of spicy.  They weren't terribly juicy, so they needed lots of salsa and/or sour cream, but they were still very yummy.

After years of package taco mix we wanted something different.  Our family loves lime so this was a hit.  We add sour cream to our tacos and guacamole would be good too.  We don't change anything to the basic recipe. Loved them!

I'm giving it four starts because, while the chicken by itself had an amazing taste, the added ingredients on the tacos didn't go together that great for my taste. I used cilantro instead of oregano and the taste of the chicken reminded me of authentic Mexican steak tacos (which are usually served with raw onion and chopped cilantro and a splash of lime juice). I think next time I'll try the chicken on lightly fried corn tortillas, to imitate the flavor of the other tacos.

Very good flavor.  I increased the lime juice to 2 whole limes and used cilantro instead of oregano.  I would make them again, but maybe add Tequilla as suggested by others for more of a kick.

Pretty delicious and fairly easy! The only change I made is to add the juice of two entire limes. I tasted it after it had cooked and it needed it to brighten the flavor up a bit. Other than that, this was a hit!

My husband doesn't like tacos and he loves this recipe.  I didn't have green onions so I substituted the recipe with a yellow onion.  Will make this again soon!

A very good way to put some limes to work.  Everyone enjoyed this dish. Made for great leftovers as well. This is a good recipe to use for leftovers during the work week in tacos, burritos, chicken and lime rice etc etc. very versatile.

I omitted the oregano and salt.  I added cilantro and chopped jalapenos for the last few minutes of cooking.  It was good but nothing special to be honest.  I paired it with some peach salsa that added some flavor and spice.  This is the second time I've made this recipe and each time I make some adjustments.  It's still not that great though.

I have to give this 4 stars because I changed the recipe, but this is AWESOME AND AMAZING!! YUMMY! I, too, used cilantro in place of oregano. This is my favorite change, I used ground chicken, and it was a HUGE hit w/ my kids! Unique flavors to this great chicken dish :)

Very Good and easy!  Omitted the oregano and added a squirt of fresh squeezed lime at the end.  Sauteed red and green peppers and onions and served it more fajita style.

This was good.  My husband really liked it.  I didn't add cilantro, because I didn't have any, but it was still good.  I think I might put the sauce in right after it gets a slightly cooked next time because the chicken was a little too done.

My family really enjoyed this recipe which include 3 picky kids. I made it exactly. The only thing I would change next time is half the pepper and use fresh cilantro as others have suggested instead of oregano. They were yummy and fresh tasting. Easy to prepare. What's not to like!

Quick and Easy. I added about a tablespoon of taco sauce. It had a lot of flavor. It did not take 20 mins to cook the chicken.

Super easy and so delicious! I only cooked for 5 minutes before my chicken was cooked through. Goes very well with the yogurt dill sauce from the fried codfish tacos on this site as well.

We enjoyed this recipe. I don't think it will go into our permanent rotation, however. It was a bit heavy on the oregano.

delicious, my fam & I loved it! after reading other reviews, i omitted oregano and added cilantro, chili powder, and shredded the chicken after cooking. Also used lemon instead of lime--i only used the juice from 1/2 a lemon but think juicing the whole lemon would've been even better. Great recipe, will def. make again!

Good and easy recipe.  I took the advise of the other reviewers and tweaked it a little.  I rubbed the chicken with cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and salt & pepper before browning it.  Then I added more cumin and cayene pepper with the vinegar and used cilantro instead of oregano.  I used 2 pounds of chicken and have enough left over for lunch tomorrow.

These were really good. I wanted shredded chicken, so I made up the sauce (I only used two boneless chicken breasts, but extra sauce) and put it with the chicken in a crock pot for four hours or so. Then I shredded with a fork. They were really juicy and flavorful.

This was just alright. The chicken had no color and was just kind of bland. I'd rather just stick to the taco packets and add a splash of tequila and red wine vinegar to that.

Wow this was amazing.  I prepared it the crockpot and shredded the chicken.  I also doubled the sauce, as to make sure there was enough flavor.  I also used cilantro instead of oregano and added a dash of cumin. Will make again soon.

I used the same ingredients listed in the recipe. Only change I made was I doubled the vinegar and lime juice to ensure there was enough flavor added to the chicken. In addition, I added a tablespoon of oil to the skillet when I cooked the chicken. I drained some of the liquid the chicken produced before adding the seasoning.  It was a great recipe.

I really liked these tacos.  I followed the recipe to the letter and I think I don't think it needs any changes.  It does say it take almost an hour to make and that is true.  I think I will save this to make on a weekend when I can enjoy my time more in the kitchen.  Thanks for sharing!

It is smart to read the reviews. I was scared to use the red wine vinegar because of the other reviews so I left that out. I also used 3lbs instead of 1 1/2. I have 6 mouths to feed and I wanted to make sure it was enough. Not sure if the sugar was necessary but I used it anyway. Used a whole white onion instead of 2 green and 4 cloves of garlic, used cilantro instead of oregano and used my homemade salsa. Also used crunchy taco shells as well as soft.  I also only sautéed for less than the time called for and added a can of chicken broth for the meat to simmer and finish cooking in. Also added the onion and garlic to the chicken after sautéing for 7-10 mins. Then added the chicken broth, lime juice, sugar salt pepper and cilantro and simmered for 20 mins to let all that broth reduce. All in all a good start for a change on tacos. Will probably make again. This was an ok recipe. I will probably make again.

This is a good recipe.  I thought fresh cilantro would give it a little more flavor and it did.  I also added  a little cumin and chili pepper to give it more flavor.  My family enjoyed it! Thanks for the recipe!

I can see where this would be good (I could taste the potential), but it just got too dry for me...not a keeper and I can usually make anything work - but slow cooker or not...it just didn't work...

This was EXCELLENT!  I can not believe that this has been sitting in my box for a year and I haven't made it.  I did not change a thing.  Very good.  This will go into the menu rotation.  Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good. I served 2 sauces "Cilantro Serrano Cream Sauce" and "Fresh Tomato Salsa." With the cream sauce 5 stars. With the salsa 4 stars.

It was okay.  Not at all what I was expecting.  Kids didn't even like it.   The marinade smelled really good, just didn't like how they tasted.  Won't make this again.

I made this recipe for the first time last night. I made the seasoning mixture and marinated the chicken in it for about 8 hours-I then grilled up the chicken and then shreaded it. Following, I added all the ingredients and simmered the meat for 10 minutes. As others have done before, I did not use oregano, and instead used cilantro. I also added a couple of teaspoons of tequilla during the simmering. I think next time I will add more tequilla and lime :)  Good recipe!

Very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly, and I think the oregano provided a nice balance. Topped it with some homemade guacamole, shredded cheddar and salsa.

I love this recipe!  I used cilantro instead of oregano and also added a couple tablespoons of tequila in when cooking the chicken (along with a whole fresh squeezed lime).  Also added xtra garlic.  I topped the tacos with cilantro as well (instead of lettuce), and made a batch of fresh guacamole to put in the tacos and also serve with chips on the side.

I would probably rate this recipe a strong four as is, but I just have to give it five stars because with just a few alterations this has become one of my all time favorite meals!  I leave out the oregano, add 1 tsp ground coriander (I use fresh coriander (cilantro) for "special occasions", I live in Norway where fresh herbs can be hard to find and too expensive for our every day meals, but I definitely recommend using it if it's a bit more budget friendly where you live), 1 tsp ground cumin, I double the amount of lime juice and add about 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Also, the serving suggestion is way off, I usually half the recipe to serve 5, and that is just enough for me and my boyfriend.

AWESOME!  My family loves these tacos.  I rate it a 4 only because I do tweak it a bit as I add a 1/4 c. of tequila as well as cumin and chili powder to taste.

These were so juicy and tender!  Added extra liquid-tequila and chicken broth so the pan didn't burn.  Will probably leave out the sugar next time, my roommate really didn't like that it was sweet.

This was GREAT! I made extra of the lime sauce and I marinted the chicken cubes for about and hour, then added the rest of tha sauce after cooking the chicken. I also added a little bit of corn starch to thicken what sauce was left it coated the chicken very well. This was very good my husband loved it. For sure one of my favorite chicken recipes now.

Amazing recipe!  I only used 1 lb chicken and did not double the sauce.  Next time I will marinade the chicken with the sauce and do a second portion of marinade to simmer the chicken in while cooking.  Also, you only have to saute the chicken for about 10-13 minutes, not 20 minutes.  SO GOOD!!!

Honestly, this recipe "as written" is not all that spectacular.  20 minutes to saute the chicken was waaaayyyy too long & I had very dried out chicken.  I doubled the amount of lime & added an extra clove of garlic, but it was still just "ok" to me.  If I make this in the future I will make sure to follow the advice of throwing it all in a crock pot & shredding the chicken instead.

This was a wonderful chicken taco recipe.  My hubby can't eat tacos with those taco seasoning packets, so it was great to find something flavorful and simple to make!  I doubled the "sauce" and precooked the chicken in the George Foreman grill, shredded and threw it into the pan.  Definitely a keeper.

I'm giving this 4 stars as written, but I did my own spin on it that I thought was a definite keeper. I left out the oregano and green onions and added onion powder. The chicken was delicious, but I like my taco filling a little moister so I added some water with chicken bouillon and cornstarch. I brought it up to a boil and then simmered it until it was as thick as I like it. End result: perfect.

These tacos are amazingly simple and yummy.  I had half of a left of rotisserie chicken, so I shredded it, put it in the pan with everything else and in fifteen minutes we were eating.  My family likes things spicy so I added on small can of green chilis, which spiced it up a little but didn't change the flavor too much.  Thanks Marissa!

This is a quick, delicious recipe. The only changes I made was to use a whole lime instead of a half because I really wanted to taste the lime, I used more than two green onions, and I cut the pepper to a half teaspoon because I didn't want it too spicy. Don't skimp on the red wine vinegar - it gives it a fantastic flavor. And for the toppings, I added diced avocado and sour cream. My son and I ate every bite of this recipe and I'm looking forward to making it again soon!

These are awesome! I made them w/corn tortillas because that's what we had at the time and they were a big hit. Definitely making this a regular menu item in our home.

Adding diced green chiles helped add some flavor to this recipe.  Also, don't skip sour cream to top it.

This was delicious. I added some tomatoes (stewed, from a can) for moisture because mine turned out a bit dry (I used cooked chicken), and it was great.

Perfect as is.  Please don't feel like you have to change this.  BUT, if you love lime, like we do, don't hesitate to add a whole lime rather than just a half.  We also at least doubled the green onion, cuz we love onion.  And we like spicy food so we added a good half tspn of red pepper flakes.  But that's it.  The flavors in this are unexpectedly intense.

Good, simple and different from my nomal beef taco fare.  Will definetly make again. Like others, I cut chicken into strips and cooked in a skillet for about 10 minutes. I did this while making lunch, then I put them in the crock pot w/ the sauce ingredients and kept it on low till dinner time.

Hmmmmmm.... I added tequilla like some other reviewers suggested and definitely improves this dish.  Next time however I think I am going to shread the chicken instead of cube it so its more conducive to tacos.

I browned the chicken in a skillet and then did as others and put in crockpot.  The flavor just wasn't there for me on this one.  I ended up doctoring it up with mega seasoning and then it was OK.

I doubled the lime and vinegar and threw everything in the crockpot to cook.  I also added a teaspoon of cumin.  These are great with cheese, sour cream and fresh pico de gallo.  I love the lime and squeezed extra on mine before eating.

Delicious and a bit different than typical chicken tacos.  The lime flavor from the marinade is great and refreshing.  It goes well with spicy toppings and the creaminess of good, cold, cheddar cheese.

Loved these tacos!!! My family gave two thumbs up to do them again. Only changes I did were I used a whole lime and did not do the oregano. Instead, I used some Mexican spice combo I had on hand. I served them with chips and salsa and re-fried beans and it was a great dinner.

DELICIOUS!  This was delicious.  I actually made this for work so I doubled the batch and threw it in the slow cooker when I got to work.  I followed other reviews and added tequila to the sauce while simmering and substituted cilantro for the oregano.  Overall, superb!

I liked this very much.  I would say the only way to make it is in the crock pot so the chicken stays so moist and shreds easily...just like in Mexican restaurants.  Next time will probably cut back a little on vinegar and sub some broth instead--it had a major kick!  I also used ground coriander in place of the oregano.  Coriander is the seed that cilantro grows from, so I figured it was a good sub.  I'll probably add some cumin to...some smoky flavor might cut the tangy-ness a bit.  I'll be making this ahead of time for a camping group of 25 next week--yikes!  But I enjoyed it that much.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I did as some of the reviewers suggested and doubled the sauce ingredients except I  used 2 whole limes, 1 teaspoon of oregano and 2 tbls of oil. I sliced up the chicken breasts and marinaded them for 6 hours in the sauce and then sauted the chicken. Great bright flavor in the chicken.  Will definately make again.  Would be great on the grill.

It was OK, but it was too vinegary for us.  It smelled of vinegar too which was pretty unappetizing.  The taste was better than the smell, but not good enough to make again.

This was great!  I made a couple changes based on what was in my cupboard and the reviews I had read.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar; juice of one whole lime instead of a half; cilantro in addition to the oregano; and marinated the chicken for 20 minutes before sauteing.

Very good, I cut my chicken into strips, sprinkled with chili pwd and sauteed. When I flipped them I poured in the vinegar, sugar, half a lemon, and a drop of honey and oregano. It was very good and my bf said the chicken was very tender.

This recipe was very easy to prepare.  I also used fresh cilantro instead of oregano.  I thought that it lacked a little in the taste but after putting it on the tortillia with all the fixings it was really good and much lower in sodium than using packaged taco seasoning.

These are very tasty, and a good change. I boil the chicken in chicken broth until cooked. Then I shred it and triple the suace mixter, I bring it to a boil with the shredded chicken. I do use frozen cilantro, to save time.

Recipe turned out amazing and very flavorful.  Changes I made was using some fresh cilantro and ground cumin instead of oregano and added tequila to my liking as found in others reviews, this also added a little spice. Also, I shredded the chicken and next time will add more lime. I will make this again. thanks.

Good flavor. I used chopped brown onions instead of green. Cooked it in a slow cooker and added a can of diced tomatoes (drained). I also used honey instead of sugar and cumin instead of oregano. I used the juice of a whole lemon (didn't have lime) Will use the leftovers on nachos. Easy and tasty recipe.

Really enjoyed this one.  It was nice to use my own spices and not a spice packet.  I opted against the oregano also and added some poultry magic seasoning and cumin. Will definitely make again.

Good basic recipe. An extra squeeze of fresh lime juice on the tacos and I used tabasco sauce instead of salsa.  I wanted the heat of the tabasco sauce but not all the flavor of the salsa which I felt masked the lime, garlic flavor of the chicken.  Maybe will try a fresh chili cooked in with the chicken next time to give it more heat.  I like things a little spicy.

Very good! Made these last night for my bf and I. We really enjoyed them. I can't say enough about how easy they were to prepare - short prep time, minimal dishes to clean, cooks in no time flat (hooray!). I never seem to follow any recipe to a T, so here's what I did to change this one: a) doubled the sauce mixture, b) omitted the oregano (seemed out of place to me), c) added 1/4 c. of chopped fresh cilantro, d) only used 3 green onions (white and green parts) and e) subbed 2 (8 oz. ea.) pkgs. of seasoned fajita-style chicken strips (I just cut the larger strips into smaller pieces). Since my chicken was pre-cooked, all I had to do was add the meat and sauce to the skillet and heat for 10 minutes (can't get any easier than that!). Served on round "tostada" shells with green salsa, shredded Mexican-blend cheese and beer margaritas (by Big Surprise) to wash 'em down. Thanks for sharing! This will definitely be added to my "keeper" file.

Now that I've made this recipe so many times and given it to family and friends I should rate it.  This recipe is wonderful!  It's fast and easy and my two boys and husband love it.  I do double the sauce so the flavor is stronger when I make this.  It also works well to double the recipe and reheat the rest for leftovers!

Very good and a really different way to have tacos for our family. Used a package of chicken parts and put in slowcooker until just done. Then took meat off bones and cut into chunks. Followed recipe after that until husband had me add other 1/2 of lime. He didn't like the "sour taste", i.e. the wine vinegar, so I will leave that out the next time. My son loved it!

these tacos were great. we mixed up the recipe a little and grilled the chicken on the BBQ first. after we cut it up into strips and put it all in a pan with lime juice and garlic. we used corn torillas instead and added some olives and cheese to the tracos. they turned out great.

Great flavorful and very easy to make.  I did add some Garlic, Salt, Pepper and my secret grill mix to the chicken for a bit more flavor.  Also used a little more lime and a touch of Hot Sauce.  I have done this recipe several times and it is always a big hit!

Good recipe - easy and quick.  I cut the chicken and made the sauce the night before I planned to make it (substituted cilantro for oregano)and marinated it overnight, except for the green onions.  I just put it all in a skillet with a dash of tequila the next day anda cooked it for about 15 minutes until the chicken was done.  I drained the sauce from the skillet, tossed in the green onions and served it with the taco makings. Definitely good and better for you than any store-bought marinade.  Leftovers kept well for several days.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a good recipe and I feel bad giving it only a three, but there was no "WOW" factor.  My husband doctored his tacos up with hot sauces and extra spices.

This is one of me and my husbands favorites! So easy and very delicious! Like others we double the sauce, add a tad more lime juice, and omit the green onion. For toppings we add shredded lettuce, sour cream, Guacamole and olives. I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe was so good! My boyfriend and I had it last night for dinner. He loved it! The only changes I made was doubled the sauce. Which was delicious! Also, I made my own salsa. This will be one recipe I will do again.

I really enjoyed this. I ate left-overs for two days since I used 5 chicken breasts. I used cilantro and doubled the red wine vinegar and limes. Will definately do this again.

Delicious!  I love lime and this added a beautiful, light flavor to the tacos.  The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 white onion in place of green onions which I didn't have on hand.  Served it with Spanish Rice II recipe from this site.

We really liked this!  It was a nice change from normal tacos.  We omitted the oregano as many people did, and tripled the sauce.  A little salty though, next time we will use less...the lime taste was flavorful enough anyways!  Yum!

Extremely simple and delicious Mexican recipe! I served it with a side of cheese nachos and guacamole. The sauce that is added to the chicken is packed with flavor, and each bite is a new experience. A must try!

These were absolutely fabulous!! I didn't have the red wine vinegar so I used a mixture of balsamic vinegar and white cooking wine to make 1/4 c. We cubed the chicken and ate them on soft tacos fajita style with rice, cheese, salsa and jalapeno slices. I also used cilantro instead of oregano. My 8 yr old even loved this. This will definitely go into our food rotation. Thank you for a great recipe! *update* 5-5-09 We eat this all the time and it is so quick and delicious! I use bottled lime juice and it tastes just as good to me. We just can't get enough of it even months later. Thanks so much for this delicious recipe!

Loved these lime tacos!  It works as a great base too if you are limited on ingredients.  It very easily you can try different meats (chicken or fish).  Definently a keeper!

I was trying to find a good lime chicken recipe we could eat at home, because we found one at a restuarant we loved. We would go broke if we didn't find one. I found this one and tried it. It is our favorite. We would rather eat this one than go to our favorite restuarant. We have it at least once a week. Way goood!!!!

My favorite way to make chicken tacos...I've made this and served it with Tostitos scoops tortilla chips and with flour tortillas.  Either way they are delicious - I do prefer starting with cooked chicken.

This was so good. The only thing I didnt care for was the red wine vinegar. I doubled the recipe but think next time I will not double the vinegar. it was a little over powering. I also added cilantro when cooking and it gave a great flavor. I made a lime-cilantro sour cream. I just mixed lime juice, cilantro, garlic, salt, pepper and sour cream. It was soooo good on top of these already excellent tacos. Even my 4 picky kids liked them

Not that great of flavor.  You can taste the lime but that's about all.  Easy to make though.  I'll stick with the ones that you marinade.

Very good! I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I did half red wine, half vinegar, and that seemed to work just fine. We also added multi-colored bell peppers - much prettier, AND yummier! I didn't add the oregano - I thought that sounded like an odd thing to add. If I'd had cilantro, I would have added that instead.

Very good, I took the advice of others & cooked the chicken in the crockpot with the red wine mixture. Then I shredded the meat & served with warm tortillas, carmelized onions, sour cream, & hot sauce of course.

Couldn't be easier and not to mention healthy and delicious! I used 2 cans of chunk chicken and shredded it. This cut down on the cook time, so it was very simple to throw together.

I thought this was really good.  One minor problem I had, was that I thought I had oregano in the pantry but didn't.  So, I just made it without, and it was great.  Lots of flavor, very easy, my husband loved it and my 18-month old liked it too.  I served it with black beans and fat free sour cream, in addition to the condiments in the recipe.  A great, lighter, easy meal!

This is really a restaurant quality recipe.  I kind of doubled the ingredients to make a marinade.
Here is what I did:  I marinated a package of boneless skinless chicken breasts in a plastic zip lock bag in the following:
  1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/8 cup extra virgin olive oil, juice of 1 medium lime, 1 tsp. sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. dried oregano leaves, 1/2 tsp salt, fresh ground pepper to taste, and 1/4 to 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder, to taste.
Marinade this for 2 hours then grill chicken breasts till done.  Serve over chopped iceberg lettuce and diced vine ripe tomatoes and shredded monterey jack cheese.  Serve with Hidden Ranch Spicy Ranch salad dressing.
Hope you all enjoy this as much as we do!

Presentation was great, but flavor was a bit odd for our tastes - I think it was maybe the vinegar.  It was left in the pan for longer than 10 minutes, so maybe they are not supposed to be as strong in flavor as we had them.

Wasn't overly impressed. Chicken had faint lime taste to it. Otherwise, not very exciting.

Great!! Made this for dinner tonight. Added 1t chili powder, 1/4t cumin, dash cayenne and 1/4 EVOO to the marinated and let it set for 5 hours. Then grilled (why I added the EVOO). Next time I'll cut the chicken into kabobs so they will absorb more of the marinated. I can see where this would taste good cooked on the stovetop or in the oven.

my husband and I loved these tacos! I used the entire sauce recipe on just had 2 large chicken breasts. 3 of us ate it all up! I served these with black beans, used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have the red wine, used whole wheat tortillas, and used light sour cream. Fantastic! I might try some of the posted tips next time - cilantro, grilled chicken, cayenne or chili pepper. This will be on my list to make often!

This chicken turned out really good!  I did not use oregano.  I did add cilantro and added some extra lime juice.  Served it with homemade pico de gallo as well! My 2 & 5 year old are actually still out there eating this as I review it :o)

This chicken is AMAZING!! I substituted white vinegar for the red and added quite a bit more garlic and put it over a salad with verde salsa, monterrey cheese and tortilla strips...yum!

This was very good, the family loved the lime flavor. We also favor sour cream and added it to our condiment options. Very easy to make and will plan on making again for a quick supper. It was a great light, summer meal.

Very good easy week night dish.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic. It was good, but I definitely think it would be better with the red wine.

This was really good. Next time, I am going to marinate the chicken before cooking it (at least an hour or so) because the flavor wasn't strong enough. Thanks for sharing! :)

My family loved this recipe!  I used the leftover chicken on a spinach salad the following day.  The only change I made was to omit the oregano and green onion and used chopped fresh cilantro.

SO.GOOD.
i marinated the chicken in the sauce (doubled the recipe) for about an hour before cooking. it was tangy and delicious. i did leave out the oregano, and added just a bit of crushed red pepper and cumin, per the suggestion of other reviewers. i'm using the leftovers to make tortilla soup so i can get a little more mileage out of this awesome recipe!

Good recipe, though I think the chicken could have used more seasoning.  Next time I'll add a little chili powder and cumin to give it some zest.  I also doubled the lime juice, as half a lime wasn't much.  I also recommend chopped cilantro on top for a little extra flavor.

Gave this a 4 because I changed some stuff.. I took the advice of a few others and doubled the sauce, added it to the slow cooker and threw the chicken in on low for about 8 hrs. I also added about 1/2 cup hot sauce. I took the chicken out, shredded it, and added it back to the liquid for another hour or so. It makes for a pretty juicy soft taco, but that's how we like it. Thanks!!

These were absolutely delicious! They tasted like something I would buy at a Mexican restaurant. I did make some alterations, however: I marinated the chicken strips with the juice of one lime and the called for amounts of red wine vinegar and sugar for 30 minutes. I made another batch of the marinade to set aside, again using the juice of one lime, to add to the chicken while it cooked. I included a chopped shallot and garlic as well. And as another member said, the cilantro is necessary.

This was good. My husband, who loves citrus, found the lime flavor too subtle. I recommend squeezing the second half of the lime over the chicken after it is done. I think the lime mixture might make a better marinade for the grill than a taco. I have made this recipe several times and will continue to do so in the future.

Well, I don't know what happened, but these came out VERY salty. I doubled the sauce, substituted cilantro, and added 1/8 tsp of cumin. Maybe the cumin put it over the edge, but the mixture came out very salty. The wife and I liked the tangy-lime taste, but otherwise :-( I might try again, but I would cut out all of the salt this time around. Sorry for the less than stellar review.

I have made these tacos every other week for years; my teenage son can't get enough of them. I make a few modifications, tho. I cook chicken tenderloins SLOWLY with doubled amounts of red wine vinegar, lime, sugar, salt, black pepper, garlic and oregano. I omit the green onions completely but add a 4-ounce can (or two) of diced green chilies and a tablespoon of salsa. Roasted baby bell peppers, avocado and fresh cilantro are perfect additions to the tacos. Thank you for sharing, Marissa!

I had a hard time with this recipe!  I tried it for the first time when some relatives came for dinner. I know that I shouldn't have done that but because of the countless raving reviews I thought that nothing could go wrong (also I am an experienced cook). The chicken turned out very sour and very pale (it didn’t look appetising at all). So I had to try many things to improve it. I added soy sauce, loads of sugar to less the tangy taste and I added fresh dairy cream. In the end it turned ok. I served with sour cream and chives, cooked basmati and green salat. Sorry but I won’t be making this recipe again.

A great alternative to beef tacos.  I subbed 2.5 T. of lime juice in.  Next time, I'll reduce that amount.  The meat is also good for taco salads.

I thought this was really good.  I used beef instead of chicken.  But I followed the marinade almost exactly, except I doubled it.  I also marinated the beef in it for 2 hrs before sauteing in a pan.  It was sooo good and had a great lime flavor.  I also used cumin instead of oregano and I added chopped fresh cilantro.  I cant wait to try it with Chicken.

I would add a little less redwine vinegar, I think next time I make this I will do what some of the other reviewers said and put Tequila in place of the redwine vinegar. I read what some of the other reviewers had said about it having too much liquid, I let my liquid cook off. Great recipe despite a couple of changes!!!

Excellent!  I added cumin and olive oil to the sauce and let it marinate.  I poured the marinade into the skillet with the chicken strips and let it cook on medium heat for about 20 minutes.  I then added newly made sauce, which was everything I used for the marinade plus cilantro, and let it simmer on med-low heat for about 10-15 min longer.

This was good but I think it was missing something and I followed the recipe as is. I think I will try again and marinate the chicken before and use more lime.

We decided to try this recipe and it was so easy, quick and delicious.  That makes it so easy on my wife and I because I work all day and she is busy with our 4 month old that I make the dinners.  It took less then 25 minutes to make and it was well worth it. I would have to go a little less on the black pepper but other then that it is definitely a keeper.

Great recipe!  The chicken was tangy, with just the right amount of spice and not too saucy.

I added shredded cheese and plain white yogurt to my taco, which complemented the lime and garlic flavors beautifully.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

My 9 year old daughter liked these so much she had 3 and said she loved the lime.I also really liked them. It reminded me of a chicken taco I get at taco bell. I gave 4*s because my husband would not eat them, he said they were to dry.

Like other reviewers, I used cilantro instead of oregano because we are cilantro lovers.  This was quick, easy, and a refreshing change from the chicken taco seasoning packets. Thanks for the recipe!

Once the meat was ready, we tasted it and all agreed that it was very bland.  I spiced it up with garlic powder and some chipotle chili powder and everyone liked it.  But this very much so deviated from the original recipe.

This recipe is really really good! Everyone I have made it for has absolutely loved it! I would cut down on the cook time to about 15 min. to prevent the chicken from being over done. I also like to add a little more lime but that's a personal taste. I will try adding the fresh cilantro next time as I love the taste of it.

A winner dinner!  I doubled the sauce & replaced cilantro for the oregano.  Did not add the salt.  Incredibly good!  Used Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce as an addional topping---hubby went bonkers!  Total Yum!!

When I first read this recipe and saw that the chicken was to be sauteed by itself for 20 minutes, I wondered if the end result was supposed to be chicken or a fossil fuel!  And, sure enough, my chicken was done in about 10 minutes, but it might depend on how you cut it.  I tasted it a few minutes after adding the sauce and was really unimpressed, but after the lime juice mixture had cooked away (I kept it covered for the second ten minutes) the chicken was delicious!  I used both dried oregano and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro at the end, and the juice of 2 not-very-juicy limes.  Delicious and fresh-tasting!

Good twist on regular chicken tacos.  I used about twice the lime recommended.  Next time I will need to add some sour cream or guacamole at the end for a little kick.

I made these for dinner tonight & they are pretty good.  As others suggested, I used fresh cilantro which seemed to go better with the lime.  Next time, I will serve with guacamole, too.  Very easy to make.  Would probably be good with shrimp.

My husband and I both really liked this recipe. I sprayed the pan with non-fat cooking spray before cooking the chicken so it wouldn't stick. The recipe says to cook it for 20 minutes, but mine was done after about 10 minutes. The only other change I made was adding some cheddar cheese in with the Monterey jack and topped off the finished tacos with some Tapatio..yum! Next time I will use fresh cilantro instead of oregano and add some jalepenos or green chilis for a little kick.

These are fabulous.  I used fresh cilantro instead of oregano (about 2-3 tbsp chopped) and 3 tbsp bottled lime juice.  I added a little more green onion too.  I was wondering how the flavor would be since it wasn't marinated but it was so moist and flavorful!  I preferred it without the salsa on it too.  I'm definitely making this again, and my husband loved it which makes me happy.

This was excellent! Served for youngest son's highschool grad party in June 2007-We did a Mexican Theme party- Was looking for the perfect flavoring for Chicken Tacos, and hit the nail on the head with this recipe!
EXCELLENT!!   would not change a thing!!

Very good and flavorful!

My family loved this recipe. We had none left. I omitted oregano added cilantro towards end. I too added more lime juice. I served them on corn tortillas and I also made fresh pico de gallo to serve on top. My husband loved them. He had me use the rest of the meat in quesadillas for his lunch to take to work.

These were so good! We did substitute cilantro instead of oregano. We also put black beans and rice on our tacos with that melted cheese you would get in a Mexican restaurant. They were so good my husband requested them for his birthday dinner and he is not a huge Mexican food eater!

Very delicious and simple.  Like the others, I reduced the cooking time significantly during the saute.  Once the water released from the chicken begins to evaporate, I reduced the heat, added the sauce and simmered for 10 minutes, covered.
I also added 1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped.  This added some great flavor without covering up any of the others.

I really like this recipe, when I want something quick and easy. I usually use the juice of the whole lime, and use chicken tenders instead of cutting it into cubes (cubes might go farther though if you are trying to feed more people). I definitely suggest adding some fresh cilantro to the top, along with the lettuce. I still used the oregano, and it is a very unique flavor in the combination I do like.

I don't quite get all the raves, but it was  different and still had good taste.  Not exceptionally memorable, but different.  I might make again.

Made this for my boyfriend tonight - he loved it! The only thing I did differently was I added 2 minced up jalapenos and cilantro instead of oregano. Mmmmm. We both had 3 and he had enough to take 3 to lunch tomorrow. I think next time I will double the recipe and make some quesodillas or something the next night cuz this chicken is YUMMY

Quick and easy, we loved these!  I too used cilantro instead of oregano, didn't have green onion so subbed with large white onion and added green and red pepper as well as mushrooms.  I did add about one third of a package of ranch dressing seasoning mix while cooking and it worked great!

I actually threw this chicken in the crock pot as recommended by another user and shredded it for the tacos. DELICIOUS! It has excellent flavor and we used the leftover chicken on cheese crisps. Wow! I was asked for the recipe by several people and they liked it that way as well. Will definitely make this again.

I didn't like this recipe at all.  The lime was way too strong for my taste.  I keep thinking a must have done something wrong, but I can't figure it out.  I tried adding other falovors like some taco seasoning to help tone down the lime, but in the end it wasn't very good.  I don't think I'll try this again.

Great dish!  I added a little bit of red cayenne pepper and it gave it a little kick that complemented the sweet and tangy side.  I also replaced the oregano with cilantro.  Finally, I marinated the chicken in the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper prior to putting it in the pan.  Everything else I took as is.

Delicious- and easy enough for a quick weeknight dinner.  I made the recipe exactly as written and loved the results.  The chicken has a wonderful, slightly tangy flavor.  I used whole wheat tortillas in a small size, which made these a little healthier and easy to eat with the hands.  I'll be making these again!

These are excellent.  I added cilantro instead of the oregano.  I thought it seemed weird to have oregano in a mexican dish.  It is great!  I have made it both ways, once with the oregano and once with the cilantro.  Both are good, but I have a preference for cilantro.  My whole family loved these!  It's a keeper.

Very bright and tasty recipe just as written.  I changed nothing and my entire family adored it.  For a future change up I might try adding cilantro as other posters suggested but it is certainly not necessary.

Loved it!  Phenomenal.  I did marinate my chicken strips (not cubes) in the sauce all day and used cilantro as opposed to oregano, per other users reviews.  YUMMO!

I served this for a group of girlfriends, and it was a big hit. In the interest of time, I used a rotissere chicken and shredded the meat. Per other users, I also used cilantro instead of oregano and added a splash of tequila.

My friends and I thought this was amazing! I added white onions instead of green onions and some minced jalepenos and chilis,  I made extra marinade and marinated the chicken in 3/4 of the marinade for 2+ hours. I sauteed chicken tenders for 10 minutes then threw the extra marinade with the chicken and cooked for a few extra minutes. I served on  on warm corn tortillas with *avacado, tomato and mango salsa* by fhiveshot -on this site. It's amazing. The lime juice, red wine vinegar and spices are amazing -add with fresh salsa with limes and mangos and cilantro and you can't stop eating. thank you thank you thank you

The dish was tasty but nothing WOW about it. The only change I made was I substituted cilantro.

These are so good!  The lime chicken is flavored to perfection.  Some fresh guacamole makes them even better.  Delicious!

My kids and hubby thought this was just okay, but I like the tanginess of it.  I would give it four stars, but the family didn't like it enough to keep it around.

Added to my file of favorite chicken recipes.  I make the chicken as directed and also grill up some red & green peppers and a red onion to serve fajita style. Make some extra sauce to enhance this one!

So flavorful, fast and quick! I used fresh lemon juice and per other suggestions doubled the amount of juice. Also sauteed the chicken in a bit of sea salt and adobo seasoning with olive oil. Husband RAVED!
Will definately add to rotation.

Made this as written except used the juice of the whole lime.  Was just okay. Hoping for much more flavor.  Not bad flavor, just kind of boring.  Will stick w/ my regular fajita recipe.

Very good.  I sauteed the chicken in a little olive oil with the garlic, pepper and salt.  I added the rest of ingredients with about 1/2 cup water and simmered about 10 min.  Will make again.

This was a delicious twist to traditional tacos.  My husband even liked it and he is a "meat and potato" guy.  He wants me to try it with seafood some time.

These were very yummy.  Pretty much followed the recipe, but omitted the green onions [we're onion haters], added a bit more garlic and left out the oregano [sounded a little weird].  They had a really good flavor, they however didn't take anywhere near that cooking time...probably about 10 just chicken, and simmered 10.  My hubbikins loved em!  Thanks for the post.

This recipe is pretty good and I recommend it but I had to make some modifications to suit my taste though.  I added fresh chopped cilantro, some creole seasoning, salt, more pepper, 1 1/2 lime (weird but I have a fondness for sour things).

These were awesome and so easy!! While the babes napped, I made the marinade and cut the chicken. When it was time for dinner I pulled it all out, dropped it in the pan and dinner was cooking!  Just one pan for everything. I heated the tortillas in the microwave and served the chicken with chopped tomato, smashed avacado and refried beans. Made again with sour cream and salsa and it was just as delicious. Also, I left out the scallions. YUM, I will definetely make this one again.

This was a fantastic surprise. I did marinate the chicken in the sauce while it defrosted and add some jalapeno juice to spice it up. I grilled the chicken and then a few days later sliced it up and made more marinade and simmered the chicken in that. I thought at first it was going to be a disappointment but Wow, what a great blend of flavours! Very easy to make and definitely hits the spot.

These soft tacos tasted delicious!  I really enjoyed the combination of flavors for the chicken.  The lime really complements the salsa well.  Next time, I might add some beans or Mexican rice to make the tacos more filling.

This was terrific AND easy!  I love the kick the real lime added to it. However, it was kind of dry, but I have a feeling I cooked the chicken a little too long.  But had I not made this mistake, it would have been remarkable!

This was delicious!  I stayed pretty close to the recipe as given, except I used more lime juice (the juice of two small limes.) And I used probably 3 teaspoons of sugar.  Next time I'll make more sauce, since it was so flavorful, and I was wishing I had more.  But the flavor was really good.  Thank you!

We make this all the time. My family just loves it. I remember preparing it for the first time and my mom came in an tasted the mixture and didnt want me to use it. She accidently spilled it too.hmmmm I wonder if it was an accident:)We were about to just ditch the whole thing, but then I said lets just try cooking the remaining mixture with a couple pieces of chicken. We did and man I am glad we did. We usually mix in cilantro and use flour tortillas. Adding avocado takes this dish to another level.Which is hard to do because it already maxed out.

We just love these! I make them quite often and they're always a big hit. I always leave out the oregano, ICK!

the breaded chicken was excellent but the sauce was not for us a little too sour.

This was a great recipe, but I did make some changes.  I tossed the diced chicken with chili powder and cumin as another suggested.  I also did not have lettuce on hand, so instead I made a seperate batch of the sauce and tossed it with some finely shredded cabbage.  I did that first and let it marinate in the fridge while I finished the rest of the meal. One other thing, as others suggested I doubled the sauce for the chicken.  All in all, this was a delicious meal.  Served this with some fried plantains and some jalepeno poppers and it was a gret meal.  Thanks for sharing!

Great soft tacos!  I enjoyed the recipe as is, but I added some fresh cilantro (this made it more 'authentic' to me) to the chicken while it cooked, and then a little more on top of the taco with the 'fixins'  I also added a few sliced fresh avacados too.  This has become one of my new favorite recipes. Everyone should try it at least once!

This recipe has a really good flavor.  I doubled the sauce as some people suggested and added cilantro.  Next time I make these I will not use so much pepper, since that made it a little too spicy for my liking.

I marinated the chicken in the red wine vinegar, lime juice, sugar, & other spices for about 4+ hours turning the chicken over every hour or so.  When I cooked the chicken I kept it covered & it was moist!  I took everyones advice of doubling the "sauce".  It turned out great!  Thew flavor of the chicken rocks :-)  My husband gave it a 4.25 because it wasn't a "formal" dish.  He's a hard judge!!  He said he definately wants it again & thinks some spanish rise would go well.

These had great flavor but the chicken turned out too dry. Next time I will cut the cook time in half and use a little olive oil to saute it in instead of just putting it in the pan.

I have been using this recipe for over a year now, and absolutely love it!  My husband asks me to make them at least once a week.  Try also topping with avacado.  Delicious - thank you so much for the recipe.  Definately a keeper.

i found the recipe to be good but think it could use a bit more flavour.  next time, i'll take the other reviewer's advice and add cilantro.  the kids loved it and asked that i make it again.  the husband even ate it without complaining.  i found the tortilla bread broke too much so next time i'll use pita pockets.

Very good, but with all taco toppings, it can be hard to taste the lime. If you eat the chicken without the stuff, you can really taste the lime. Very good.

I thought this was really good, I tripled the sauce and doubled the chicken, added more vinigar, and used tons of fresh cilantro.  I think next time I won't add as much viniger.  It was really good!

This rules!  if i could give it a 10 i would!  my son said it was too lime-y but i disagree.  i made it just as the recipe states except i didn't have wine vinegar, so i used rice vinegar.  I also used 1/2 the meat and the same amount of sauce (read: double the sauce)  served it with homemade beans de la olla and a salad with romaine, green onions,cilantro and chipotle ranch.  fantastic dinner!

The flavor of this meat mixture is fabulous!  I used cilantro instead of oregano. (It's just not mexican food without cilantro!) I also cut my ckn in strips instead of cubes and didn't cook it as long. If you have access to Mexican cheese, use Cotija. Yum. Next time I boil ckn, I plan on shredding some to use with this sauce mixture and fry up some corn tortilla's for chicken taco's.  ooh, or how about ckn chimichanga's??  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a definite keeper!  I used frozen cajun chicken breasts sliced and sauteed with the lime juice, subbed balsamic vinegar added the garlic and 1 Tbsp of red pepper jelly as well as some of my homemade cajun spice mix - added the tomatoes to the chicken in the pan and served the mixture in a tomato/basil tortilla with sour cream, chopped romaine and organic salsa and old cheddar, grated.  Delicious!  Thanks for the idea.

MMMMmmm yummy! Just tasted the chicken. Mine came out juicy and tender. I cut the chicken into pretty small pieces, and didn't cook nearly as long as stated. Left out oregano per reviews.

Very good.  Very healthy dinner as well.  We had this when we had company over and just served a salad with it.  Everyone ate it right up and wanted the recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and seasoning salt. I also doubled all ingredients other than the chicken and tortillas, added a teaspoon of minced jalapeno, a tablespoon of minced green chillies, and a side of reduced fat sour cream. Also substituted cilantro for oregano.  Will make again.  Thanks.

The marinade for the chicken is amazing!! It's great for any mexican dish with chicken. I actually use it to marinade the chicken in the pico de gallo quesadilla recipe. Makes them ten times better! So easy and great!

I found this rather strange. The chicken had more of an Italian flavour than Mexican. Paired with the salsa it didn't seem quite right. We ate it but don't think I would make again.

I think this is delicious. My husband, on the other hand, will be home for dinner in a half hour & he just ain't gonna like it. He can't deal with a "fruit and meat combination"--he had never heard of such a thing til he married me. :O)  He is not gonna go with the lime & chicken thing...so if you don't like lime, you won't like this. I, on the other hand, LOVE lime flavored chicken, tuna, etc. so I am giving this 5 stars. It is great!

I thought these tacos were GREAT and they smell SO nice!!!  You can definitely taste the hint of lime in them and the juice mixture left in the pan, I recommend using that in your taco as well.  It is where all the flavor is...very good tacos! :)

This was nothing special. In fact we couldn't really taste much of any flavor, even though I marinated for a good while. Tacos are always good but I think I will stick with my own way of making them. Thanks anyways.

This recipe is very good.  I added extra lime to add more flavor.  I would definitely recommend doubling the sauce, at least.  I like sauce and my chicken was a little dry when it was all done.  Will definitely try this one again though!

I actually used the marinade to make fajitas and was generally pleased with the results.  Next time I would add a bit more salt and 1 more clove of garlic but that is just a personal preference.  I don't like oregano and prefer cilantro in Mexican food so used that instead.  Marinated chicken thigh strips (2.16#) for several hours.  I used the juice of the whole lime and balsamic vinegar.  I also added grated lime zest for extra flavor.  Threw it all in a sizzling hot pan with onions and peppers.  Topped w/f.f. sour cream, and f.f. cheese, chipotle salsa, and fresh tomatoes.  Very nice, light meal.  Very good fajita marinade.

YUM YUM. Great taco.  I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce.  I am also lazy and just zapped the tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds. My husband said should be topped with plain yogert - we use this instead of sour cream.  A repeat! Thanks

I was really excited about making this, but it didn't live up to my expectations. I cooked the chicken as written earlier this afternoon, added the juice of another lime to the pan, then let it sit until I came to make dinner tonight (just thoroughly heated it through again). I was surprised, therefore, that the chicken didn't have much flavor. Husband ate them and liked them well enough, but he was not even remotely wowed. I wouldn't make these again, but thanks anyway.

This was pretty good and I made it exactly as the recipe said.  It could be much better using suggestions in some of the previous reviews.  Next time I'll use a whole lime, add some additional spices and substitute cilantro for oregano.

This was delicious! I made it out of leftover frozen chicken from a family get-together last summer and my husband and I loved it. I put some of the cheese in the taco while hot but other then that left it the same.

These tacos were so easy to make and the flavor is outstanding.  I think they tasted even better the next day, after reheating them.  I will be making these often!

I think this is a wonderful recipe. I definitely use the whole lime and maybe more but I LOVE lime.... Try it, you will love it. I also doubled the sauce and also added some fajita seasoning to the chicken for some added zing....YUMMY

These were so good!  I followed the recipe as written (ok, I did replace the oregano with fresh cilantro) and they were delicious.  Next time I'm going to try using chicken thigh meat because I find chicken breast rather dry.  The whole family loved them, and it filled the kitchen with wonderful aromas.

ETA: tried chicken thigh meat the second time -- Way better!!!

Delicious!  I'm not sure how much lime I put in. I just dribbled about a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half.  But it ended up being perfect.  My kids loved it and so did my husband.  Will make again.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.  Maybe it would have been better with cilantro.  Also take note that there isn't near enough of the "sides" listed.  1/4 cup of lettuce, cheese and tomatos for 10 servings doesn't quite cut it.

I really like this and will make it again.  It has a nice flavor. A couple of changes in the process.  Next time I'll double the marinade.  I'll use half to marinade before I saute it.  Then I'll drain it and add the rest of the marinade to simmer.  I found that the chicken omitted a lot of water which diluted the tasty flavor of the marinade.  I also didn't to saute it for 20 minutes to have it cooked through. I switched the oregano for fresh cilantro - great suggestion by others.  I'll probably increase the lime juice next time too.  I made the marinade and cut the chicken ahead of time so it was quick preparation with little mess.  Good, quick meal.

Pretty tasty.  We used cilantro, as other viewers suggested, instead of oregano; but it lacked something.  We added some crushed red pepper and cayenne at the end, which seemed to do the trick; but I would suggest to others to try adding jalepeno or habenero pepper with the chicken (while it's simmering) to give it a kick.

I did like this, but next time I think I'll use cumin instead of the oregano. The oregano was a little much and a bit un-mexican.  The lime juice is key.  Also, I think next time I'll marinate whole chicken breasts and grill them for that excellent grilled taste.

I make this recipe with shirmp because my husband doesn't eat chicken or meat.  It is so good both ways.  Probably also good on pork, this is a great sauce to saute any meat in.  We also make them as burritos with rice and beans.  This is very easy and made with common on hand ingredients.

I really liked this recipe, and so did my husband.  It was easy to prepare, as evidenced by the fact that he made it and didn't burn down the house in the process.  I thought the flavors worked well together; the vinegar really helped to enhance the lime flavor. I thought that 1 tsp of oregano was a bit much and will probably cut back or leave it out altogether next time.

Loved the seasoning of this recipe.  My husband likes lots of flavor, so I will double the ingredients used for seasoning next time to make it a little stronger.

Great flavor! I gave it 4 stars because I thought the chicken was a little dry. I think I will cut back on the cooking time and maybe add a little more lime juice next time. Will definitely make again though!

We made this recipe and enjoyed it. We added our own changes so that we thought it would turn out better. With just a few adjustments we found it to be an easy,nice lighter alternative to traditional tacos.

I thought this recipe was delicious!  My husband seemed to like it as well, he didn't say much while eating, but he ate 4 tacos!  I used red onion instead of the green onions and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making this again.

Made this without the oregano. Didn't miss it one bit. I also used twice the amount of lime juice and corn tortillas (tried it with flour, wasn't as good). Next time I may add cilantro. Added gaucamole to my tacos...delicious!

This was so delicious! I made this last night and my husband downed it so fast! The chicken was juicy and flavored wonderfully. We topped the tacos with lettuce, cheese and sour cream and salsa. Served it with rice and beans. Mmm! Will make again!

I'm giving this 4 stars because my chicken was dry and overcooked following the recipe.  I have, however, made it several times using leftover cooked, shredded chicken.  I just put the chicken in a skillet and pour the sauce over and heat.  
I use the chicken in quesadillas too.

I made this last night very tasty.  I used 1/2 of the oregano and added a teaspoon of adobo seasoning.  Yum!  I had leftover chicken for a chicken salad YUM!

A nice change from regular tacos!  My husband did not like the change, however! I was disappointed in the flavor.  I do not think it was very strong.  I may double the seasonings next time. I would definately omit the oregano.  It gave too much of an italian flavor.

This was really good.  My husband also commented what a yummy chicken dish this was.  I sauteed it in garlic olive oil, since no oil was specified.   Really really tasty.  20 minutes was too long to saute it, though.  I did it for about 10 minutes, followed by the 10 minutes with the other ingredients.

We enjoyed this recipe for its' taste as well as its' simplicity.  We almost always have all of these ingredients on hand and it's a quick enough fix.  I will double the lime juice next time as we really like lime.  Also, I made the chicken in a huge pan.  Once it was done, pushed all the chicken to one side and placed the four tortillas we needed in the pan.  They warmed while I finished chopping up the toppins and I didn't have to futz with them one at a time.  Thank you for this recipe!

I was surprised how great this tasted. I'll shred the chicken next time and add more lime.  Also, I didn't need to cook this for 30 min.  My chicken cooked for 10.

Excellent recipe, chicken had a nice flavor. The changes I made was I used cilantro instead of oregano, added extra lime, garlic, and onion. I also added a little lemon juice. It was so yummy!! My family loved it, will make again for sure.

Needed extra seasoning.  I added red pepper flakes, a little cayenne and lots more lime juice.  I sprinkled on some paparika too which gave the chicken a nice color.  Not a bad recipe just needed a little kick.

WOW!   This was so good!   It's quite different from the way I normally season taco meat - What a refreshing change!   
Since we're low-carbing it right now, I replaced the sugar with Splenda, and served it on a bed of Napa Cabbage.   Nice treat!!!  This will be on my regular repertoire of foods that I make!

A nice change from taco seasoning! Great tangy flavor. I served on cheddar jalapeno tortillas with lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese and salsa. Excellent!

I made these after work the other night and the only changes I made were to shred the chicken after it had cooked, and I omitted the green onions.  I thought they were decent, but not as good as everyone has raved about.  I don't think I would make them again.

Good stuff! I wouldn't call this a quick or easy recipe (then again, I am not very good at this cooking thing) but it did turn out great. I'm not a fan of oregano, but I like to try the actual recipes on this site as they were intended by their creators. Ended up being a good move--the oregano didn't give the chicken a strong oregano taste, but instead mixed w/ the other flavors to add a unique taste. Good stuff!

I didn't make the taco portion of the meal but prepared the chicken as described.  Very tasty indeed.  I served it with some orzo and green beans and it was well-received.

What an amazing flavor these had. I am used to only making beef tacos because I am always afraid I would ruin the chicken if I tried to make chicken tacos. This recipe worked perfectly and the lime makes them taste authentic! I will be making these again and again! Thanx!

I payed a fortune to buy tomatoes and avocados so we could have homemade quacamole to go with this..but it was definitely worth every penny! A fantastic recipe. The only changes I made was to saute the garlic first, then add the chicken..I used rice wine vinegar as that was all I had and the juice to a whole lime. I also added chopped cilantro and omitted the sugar. Next time I'll add a little diced serrano pepper to spice it up a little, but a great recipe overall.

This recipe was awesome! I cooked the chicken in olive oil and used regular brown onions, not green but they were still great! Thanks for the recipe. 
I used Lime juice from the bottle and put two firm squeezes in, a teaspoon and a half approxamatly.

This is an enjoyable and flexible recipe. One tip: when simmering the chicken in the vinegar/lime juice mixture, add the green onions at the very end and sautee quickly to retain their colour and crunchiness.

Overall this recipe is very good.  It's not a real quick taco recipe, so don't do it if you're in a hurry.  The flavors of the vinegar, lime juice, garlic and onions mesh great with the chicken.  I added some cayenne pepper to brighten it up a little bit, as the mixture originally was looking pretty dull.  I'll definitely make this dish again and maybe next time will cook some diced tomatoes and green bell peppers into the mix for more color. Thanks for the yummy tacos!

This was great but instead of salsa I used fresh pico de gallo packaged at the grocery store.  I also added a little sour cream.  This recipe tastes fresh and is a new take on tacos.

This was so good!  Especially when served on homemade flour tortillas!  I did substitute fresh cilantro for the oregano.  I have made it several times already.  My husband even liked it and he's not big on trying new things!  Very easy too!  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome once you figure out your lime preference.  I love lime so I usually put 1/2 cup of lime concentrate and double the rest of the sauces and herbs.  it turns out perfect and my husband and friends love it.  its one of our favorites!

The chicken had a nice flavor.I usually like green onions but I don't think this recipe needed them. My husband really liked it and he is very picky. I will make these again.

This was very easy to make and tasted great, next time i will use others suggestions and use cilantro, although the oregano didnt taste bad it's not something you normally taste in tacos, also cutting down the cooking time for the chicken or adding water because it was a liitle dry.

Very tasty chicken tacos.  I coated the chicken pieces with fajita seasoning before sauteeing them to give it even more flavor.  We topped them with homeade guacamole as well as tomato, lettuce, sour cream, cheese and salsa.  I also added cilantro cause I like it.  My husband RAVED about how good this was--unusual for him.

These were wonderful. I marinated the chicken, which I sliced up into strips, overnight and cooked it up in the marinade. I served this with low carb garlic herb tortillas, tofu cheddar, lettuce, salsa and fat free sour cream. The chicken was very moist and flavorful.

I don't know what I was expecting,but this was soooo good! Tasted very authentic, even my husband, the mexican food snob loved them! We have unusually hearty palates when it comes to hot food but this was HOT HOT HOT!!! DO NOT use HOT salsa with it, It is very spicy on its own. Another idea, i just made it for the 3rd time.. Instead of putting the chicken in the skillet and saute it, i put frozen chicken breasts in the oven at 350 for about an hour, then sliced them up, into chunks and THEN put them in the skillet. The tacos were SO better, much more moist and savory.

I just made these this afternoon and they were pretty good. I let the cubed chicken marinate in the mixture for a coupla hours and also added in a can of chopped green chiles near the end of cooking. Like other reviewers, I also switched the oregano for cilantro. Served with pepper jack (cheddar for the kids) on whole wheat tortillas and my 5 y/o had two of them! Husband liked it as well. Thanks for a good recipe. Will make again.

I loved these!  Like previous suggestions, I marinated the chicken in the sauce for several hours, then cooked under the broiler (second best to the grill which I would do in summer, I wanted that "browned" taste), then chopped and simmered in additional sauce.  Also, I used fresh cilantro in place of oregano, adding more as the chicken simmered.  YUM!!  We actually ate on crunchy corn tortillas, reminded me of the chicken tacos you get in "fast-food" Mexican places.  Definitely will make again!

A very tasty recipe!  It was definitely a hit at my house.  We just tried it last night, but had some extra chicken left over.  My husband suggested having the left over chicken in a salad which I think I'll do!!

These were good and something different. I took the suggestions of others and used cilantro. But I forgot to take the suggestion to go easy on the black pepper. Be careful, too, to not overcook the tortillas or they'll get crispy.

I've made this twice.  The second time I made following modifications which we preferred to the original: I doubled the sauce and used it to marinate the diced chicken (marinated 2 hours).  I substituted cilantro for the oregano, and served with green salsa, jack cheese and corn tortillas, with no lettuce/tomatoes.  We really enjoyed it.

Great recipe!  I used this with leftover shredded pork and it was great!  I usually double the spices and liquid so the meat has even more flavor.  I have found this recipe is much more flavorful if already cooked, shredded meat is used.

Very nice for a night where you are pressed for time, but we found it lacking in "oomph"...just sort of bland.

I found this to be a flavorful and different way to enjoy soft tacos.  My boyfriend found them to be a little overpowering flavor-wise, but I'm pretty sure I'll make them again when the warm weather comes.

We thought this was fantastic even though I didn't follow the recipe to the letter.  I used one whole lime (next time will use 2), jarred garlic instead of fresh and double the green onions.  I marinated the chicken an hour ahead of time and then cooked it all together.  My husband loved and I both loved it.

Very good!  I didn't expect much because lime in tacos seemed weird, but I was pleasantly suprised.  Will make it again.

This was fantastic!  I followed another persons suggestions, doubled the ingredients-except the chicken, marinated the chicken for 1 hour before cooking, and used 1-2 limes and it was out of this world.  Even my picky 4yr old and 8 yr old liked it!  I HIGHLY recommend this if you like the taste of lime!

I absolutely love this recipe.  It is really quick to prepare, and the flavors are so fresh and incredible.  I used this with the "best guacamole" recipe also on this website.  I also had spanish rice as a side dish (the sauce from this goes GREAT with the rice).  My 8 year old also told me I HAD to make this all the time - he loved it too.

I have fixed this one many times! YUM! It is also good for vacation (if you going somewhere that has a kitchen and you will be cooking) because the ingredients are easy to carry with you.

The chicken is good, but by the time you get it in a tortilla & mixed in with everything else, you can't taste that unique flavor.  I'll definitely make again but marinate beforehand!

This was fantastic.  I've made the recipe a few times since I first saw it here and loved it every time.  The only modification I made was to marinate the chicken an hour or so before cooking it and it came out with a wonderful flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

Be careful not to overcook the chicken~it can get dry. The flavor is strong, but very good. My husband loved this recipe.

At first thought this was a little much work for just tacos, but well worth it!  Even with all the authentic taquerias around our Southern California home, my boyfriend still requests these at least once a week!

These were good.  I also added sliced black olives with the tomatoes and cheese.  Next time, I'll leave them out; there was enough stuff to add.  Will make again.

Yummy! I cut my chicken into strips and marinated it with the lime juice,vinegar,sugar,garlic,green onions, etc. for a few hours. I then grilled the strips and served with warm flour tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, sharp shredded cheddar, salsa and sour cream. Delish! Family loved this change instead of the traditional ground beef/hard shell tacos! Will be making these again soon! Thanks Marissa for a  great recipe!

The recipe is good, but I wouldn't rave over it.
I guess I expected more after reading the reviews.
It's a nice change from regular tacos.
