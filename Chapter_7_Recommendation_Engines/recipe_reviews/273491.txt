This recipe is super simple but I think and ingredient may have been left out. I checked on it after 2 hours and the slow cooker was extremely dry and everything was sticking to the bottom. I think there needs to be some liquid. I had a can of crushed tomatoes and threw that in there which did the trick. Chicken broth would be another good option. This is super simple and made great tacos but I recommend adding some liquid.
