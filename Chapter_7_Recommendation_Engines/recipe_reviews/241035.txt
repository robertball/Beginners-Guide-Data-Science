. Great recipe! Only advice is to find a way to incorporate simple syrup because the sugar doesn't dissolve well.

OK, I'm giving two stars for the ingredients EXCEPT for the tequila choice.  Jose Cuervo Gold??  Really?  Invest in something just a tiny bit more expensive and get 100% agave tequila.  Jose Cuervo Gold is NOT top shelf tequila.

Excellent recipe! At the end I like to pour the mixture over crushed ice. You can also try running the crushed ice through a food processor to make slushy ice - this is trickier to get right but with practice you can get the right balance of mix and ice.

Fantastic margarita! I was initially put off by the amount of sugar but you don't pour all of it. It's perfectly balanced so that the right amount gets poured and the excess gets left at the bottom of the shaker. Sweet and Sour makes me sick so this was the perfect recipe. This is  absolutely delicious. The perfect margarita holds up to its name. Change nothing, follow the recipe, and enjoy!

This recipe is amazing!!  So simple and fresh and delicious!  I didn't have any orange liquor, so I had to leave that out.  Didn't miss it at all!

Perfect cocktail  for our Cinco de Mayo dinner!  Made exactly as written with a little less tequila . Nothing but fresh ingredients. So much better than the mix in a bottle!

Loved this AFTER my change of 3 oz tequila toned down to 2 oz. Everything else I followed exactly as described. I too have been looking for the right balance of tart and smooth and am especially glad to get away from the store mix. This is my keeper margarita recipe for sure!
