I'm always up for trying new things and this really caught my attention because I'm a big fann of sweet and salty things. This was both put together. I loved every bite and it was gone in a matter of seconds. Easy to make and one of the quickest. Thanks :) I'll definitely try this one again :)

Today is the 2nd time I made this. The first time I made itas the recipe says but used Honey Peanut Butter (instead of drizzling the extra honey). Pretty good but needed a little something extra for my taste. So today I added a smear of plain cream cheese to the sandwich and YUM! That was the extra something it needed. It's a strange concoction and an acquired taste, but on a cold day it was really gooey & satisfying. And to my surprise, he bacon is actually good with it.

This sandwich is the BOMB!!!!!  I have been eatin them since i was young.  a good thing to try is cook the sand wich with out the bacon in it.  then add the chocolate coved bacon to it after it has been cooked.  it makes it 10 times better.

Very good. Made it last night. Only thing I changed was using whole wheat bread and no butter, cooking spray.

We followed the recipe, however on one sandwich we tried cooking the bananas in a frying pan with peanut oil before we put it on the sandwich, and we found that that was better. The bacon is optional but we thought it added something, and we prefer the sandwich with the bacon.

They serve this sandwich at Peanut Butter and Co in Greenwich Village and it is awesome!  I may be biased since I'm pregnant but the taste combinations are fabulous!

I wouldn't make it again, but I did thoroughly enjoy it while it lasted. I would eat it again if someone offered it to me. :)

This was ok. My husband couldn't finish serving and thought the sweetness was overpowering. I didn't think that myself but nevertheless I felt so bad about what I was doing to my arteries to say nothing of my recent weight loss. Overall we don't think the tastes meshed together very well. I love Elvis' music but not his food.

this is really good if you drizzle maple syrup over the peanut butter. or dip the sandwich in maple syrup while you eat it. Not a everyday thing to eat or you will end up like Elvis but its a great treat once in awhile.

I've always loved grilled pnut butter & banana sandwiches and also grilled peanut butter and bacon sandwiches, but never put the two together until now. Pretty good.

I have made these for years.  Never used the bacon so decided to try it.  Personally we like it without the bacon.  Thanks for the post.

I cook mine the same way, but I leave a little bacon grease in the pan to grill the sandwich.  It tastes soooo much better and, as my Grandma says, it's the bacon grease that gives you energy!!!

I like all the ingredients, and indeed I ate the whole sandwich. But it didn't wow me. I think it's the warm bananas, I can never get cozy with those except with Bananas Foster. But the bacon wasn't weird with this at all, you should try it if you like all these ingredients. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW. Mind blowing recipe, I cooked these for my whole family and they loved it. I think they were just shocked I could cook! It's basically a peanut butter sandwich but way better. Obviously the 10 minute preparation time is directed at experienced cooks but trust me it's worth the wait. I added an over easy bird's egg to elevate it, and each plate was served with the sandwich, a quarter of a raw banana, and 1/2 a serving of cabbage. If you add an egg, make sure to scoop the shell pieces out with a spoon because the melted butter will be HOT. The only problem we had was that my grandmother forgot to take her insulin shot before she ate and I had told her that I had used sugar-free jelly. I also didn't tell her I added chocolate chips because I was afraid she wouldn't eat it. She ended up having an episode on her drive home and was unconscious while driving! Luckily, a truck driver saw her and nudged her car safely  into a ditch. It was scary, but it's not totally the recipe's fault so it still gets five stars! Also, if your brother is vegetarian, make sure to leave off the bacon to avoid getting yelled at ha!

I have been making these for years, since I had first heard about Elvis' favorite sandwich on a documentary.  I'm a sandwich guy so I immediately gave it a try.  Obviously there is no health benefit to this sandwich so don't be eating it everyday.  It however tastes great and should be enjoyed by all peanut butter and bacon lovers.

A classic of its kind. (And in a class by itself!) For a much less greasy effect, fry the sandwich unbuttered in a nonstick pan. (Do that with grilled cheese sandwiches, too!)
