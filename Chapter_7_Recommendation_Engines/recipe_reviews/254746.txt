By far the best healthy snack I've ever made!  Even my pickiest eater loved them. The one that would go into convulsions at the thought of eating something fresh or green. I made them exactly according to the directions. They are so good and very filling.  I was a bit confused by the addition of white sugar but thought there must be a reason since all the other ingredients are so healthy. I think next time I may try a natural alternative such as xylitol. Any suggestions?
