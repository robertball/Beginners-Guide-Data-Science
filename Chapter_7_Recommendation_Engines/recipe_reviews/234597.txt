I liked this. I don't have much experience with these types of sauces but the balance of flavours was really enjoyable. I used fresh garlic and added some sliced green onion for garnish. For a crowd, I tripled this adding some hot peppers to some of the bowls As are most things like this, I found that the longer it set, the better it tasted. Definitely make it an hour or two before using. Thank you for the recipe.

Bright and fresh, I really liked this recipe.  I added 1/4 tsp of powdered ginger and some sesame seeds.

We liked this! I also added in some green onion to enhance the flavors. Tasted great with our sushi and steamed dumplings. Thanks for sharing. :)
