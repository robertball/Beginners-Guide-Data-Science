This is excellent. I can't tell you how many outdoor get togethers (church, school, etc.) that we have made this. It is easy to buy pre-chopped bags of frozen onions and just heat up the chili over a campfire and fill the individual Frito bags. I also like to add a dollop of sour cream. Thank you.

Oh, this is such a comfort food and a recipe that my family has made over and over again.  Really you can use any kind of chili you have, especially homemade.  Yummy!

This is a great recipe. Super easy and good for a lunch on a cold winter day.
