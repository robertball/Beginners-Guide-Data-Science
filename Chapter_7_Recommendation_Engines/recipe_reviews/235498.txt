I liked the creaminess that the yogurt brought to this egg salad and the little tang that came from the dijon.  Nice lunch today.

Maybe the reason I enjoyed this so much was because it was “simply” egg salad.  No frills.  I do love variations of basic egg salad with different and even unusual add-ins.  But it was nice this time, to stick to a more pedestrian version.  I did make the basic recipe, including the green onion, but substituted sour cream for the plain yogurt, which I have never used.  It was delicious!  I do have to say, however, that the best part for me was to use the ingenious suggestion of the potato masher!  I’ve never done that before and now that I have I won’t forget it!  Makes quick work of chopping the eggs!  Finally, all of the listed variations sound interesting and delicious as well.   I look forward to trying them all.

I used eight eggs, but used the amount of mayo & yogurt as I like my egg salad stiff.  I doubled everything else and added 1 teaspoon of sweet relish.
Loved using Dijon mustard!!

This was great! I used pain Greek yogurt, and it gave it a nice smooth flavor. I didn't have celery or green onions, so I added a little pickle relish and some Louisiana Hot Sauce. Just enough to give it a little kick. It was so good! I think you could used Siracha for a slightly different heat.
Second time I made it: Still fantastic! I think egg salad recipes can get too heavy. This one is light and delicious!  This one is now a favorite at our house??

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a lighter option for egg salad and was curious about the addition of the yogurt.   I found it did taste lighter and had good flavor, but I admit I still prefer using all mayonnaise.  Also, perhaps because my eggs may not have been as large as the recipe submitter’s, the mixture was looser than I would have liked, so I would adjust the wet ingredients the next time.

Tho it was tasty, it came out a bit runny. I used whole  milk yogurt and regular mayo as well as chives. I think I shall add an extra egg or two for next time.

Loved the idea of using  yogurt in this.  I used my favorite brand of nonfat Greek yogurt and regular mayonnaise (not low fat).  Husband usually balks at the idea of yogurt being subbed for sour cream or mayonnaise, so of course I didn't alert him.  When pressed for his opinion he thought the taste was "just right".  And a personal note:  Why have I never thought before to use a potato masher to chop eggs?   This one's a keeper.

potatoe masher works well. I use my egg slicer and slice it normally then turn it around so it cuts vertically. does a nice even chop. I also add real bacon bits to mine and lots of pepper. doesn't really need salt b/c of mayo.

Very good ... did not have yogurt so went full mayo and added some creamed horseradish.  Very good especially before you tuck the leftovers in the fridge.

Loved it! A nice break from my usual egg and Miracle Whip. Consistency was perfect, not runny at all. Followed the recipe to the letter and ate it on whole wheat bread for a light dinner. I’ll definitely make it again!

This was just perfect.  I was busy around the house, and I needed something quick to whip up for dinner.  I followed recipe to a T, and we couldn't be happier.  I am wondering what it would taste like if I put all yogurt next time.  We did think a little bit of dill would be fun, but not necessary.  I will be making this one again, and play around with adding yogurt in place of mayo.

I made the Chili Avocado variation. I used Greek yogurt and added some cayenne pepper to give it more spice. It was good as a dip with Triscuits.

I used precooked hard boiled eggs from the grocery store. This proved to be a real time saver that allowed me to start at step 2.
I prepared the salad as stated, including the optional green onions. The result is one of the best egg salads I have ever had.
This recipe is a Keeper!

I love how creamy this egg salad is! I'm not one for a lot of add-ins to my egg salad, so this recipe is perfect for me. Just a little crunch from the celery, yet its flavor nor the onion's overtakes the dish. Definitely a keeper!

I made this with extra mustard, Chili  Powder, Creole, Hungarian Paprika, more salt and pepper, more celery and crumbled bacon(would have liked to add raisins as well, but we didn't have any). Very bland basic recipe and too liquidy for my taste. I would omit the yogurt. Will make it again with modifications. Not enough "pizazz", but very customizable.

Perfect egg salad. Simple & delicious. I like mixing the Greek yogurt with the mayo so it's not all mayo. A little lighter & healthier. And I also used a potato masher on the eggs. such a good idea! So much easier!

My family and I really didn't care for this. It was way too bland. I tried adding more green onion and black pepper, but it still lacked flavor. In the end, I added albacore tuna and lemon juice for tuna salad. It turned out ok. I won't make this again, but if you prefer a bland dish you might like this.

Made this to get rid of some Easter eggs :). I very much liked the light, tangy flavor from the yogurt. I subbed in some chopped pickles (vlasic farmer's garden mix with peppers and carrots) because I'm allergic to celery (I think the original would have been better for the crunchiness factor) but all in all a great basic recipe.

Thank you for sharing. I had never made egg salad so I liked the simple yet detailed instructions. I couldn't wait the two hours for eggs to sit because my husband was hungry so I put the peeled eggs in the freezer for a few minutes while I chopped celery and got the other ingredients together. I had no plain yogurt so I just used a little more mayo and added a little onion powder. I served it between toasted bread slices (enough to make 3 full sandwiches). My husband finished two sandwiches with a bowl of soup and was heartily satisfied. So it is going in my recipes. God bless.

I used about 8 eggs, followed recipe measurements for mayo and yogurt, used prepared yellow mustard, didn't add celery or onions. added chopped pickles w/a tad of pickle juice. I'm very impressed how this turned out! I hate yogurt and mayo but this wasn't so bad.
