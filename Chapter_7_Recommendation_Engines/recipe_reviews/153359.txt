Fast & easy!  I omitted the cinnamon stick for each mug and added two cinnamon sticks to the brew instead. Also, I added six whole cloves for extra flavour.  I boiled all ingredients and then kept it warm in a crockpot.  I added a sliced orange to the crockpot for added appeal.  A nice orange colour!  A 5-star recipe once you make the noted changes.

I changed the ingredients a little bit to make to healthier.  I substituted apple juice with crystal light apple flavor.  I also used sugar-free orange jello and ground cinnamon.
