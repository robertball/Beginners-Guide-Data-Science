I halved the recipe but only used 1 16 ounce bag of lima beans and that was still too much.  There really isn't enough "broth" to make a good soup.  It is like ham, beans and potato with a little liquid included.  And it did not get thick.  The taste was pretty bland the first night but lunch the next day it was better.  I did use chicken broth instead of water.  I don't know that I'd make this again without some tweaks.
