I reviewed this recipe awhile ago (I loved it then, and still do!)and wanted to post that after making it many times, I have figured out the secret to making the dough not so crumbly!   If you follow the recipe exactly, make sure that you cream the butter and the sugar together very well and then mix in the eggs and vanilla.  Mix the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a seperate bowl as directed.   When you add the flour mixture to the sugar, butter and eggs, don't add more than 1/4 cup at a time and blend it in well.   It will still be a dry dough (it's supposed to be) but it won't be as crumbly and hard to work with.  You can easily knead it on the table and form it into logs this way without it falling to pieces on you..... just thought that I would share!  Good luck with yours, this really is a great recipe! I have recently tried a new twist.  I keep the recipe the same but don't add the cinnamon. I substitute about 1-1/2 cups dried cranberries (crasins) and about 1/2 a bag of white chocolate chips!  They are the new favorite!

I'm from an Italian family so we know our biscotti!  I love cinnamon so I thought these biscotti were delicious.  However, I followed this recipe exactly as written & the dough is way too crumbly.  I added 1 more whole egg to bind it all together & the consistency was perfect.  You can also add some chopped hazelnuts for a little bit of crunch.

I thought this was great.  I made it twice and the second time I made it for my diabetic grandpa, and this is, so far, the first biscotti recipe that has worked with a sugar substitute.  My grandpa and I are both very thankful for this recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe that turns out every time!  A mocha just isn't a mocha without a little biscotti to accompany it.  I don't bother with 1 egg yolk, i just use two whole eggs.  Also, sometimes I like to drizzle the toasted slices with some melted chocolate right when they come out of the oven.  This is a winner!

This is the best biscotti I have ever had (and being Italian) I have made a lot -- glowing reviews on this.  I did add 2/3 cup of Hershey Cinnamon chips and that was a nice touch.

This was my first time making biscotti. I altered the recipe a bit, using half vanilla and half almond extract. The dough shaped up nicely, and was easy to slice out of the oven before toasting. The taste is a tiny bit bland, next time I will add orange or lemon zest and perhaps some almonds. I will be making this biscotti again!

This was very easy and inexpensive to make.  I followed the directions exactly and took this to a cookie exchange.  I heard nothing but good comments!  I even heard a guy there say, "I'm getting this recipe so my wife can make these for me!"  My 10 year old son wants to eat the dough while I make them.  His comment: "This dough is heaven!"  I drizzled the biscotti with melted white almond bark.  They were so pretty!

I brought these to a potluck dinner party and came home with an empty platter!  These are fantastic!  I am not a big fan of the "teething biscuit" hardness of many biscotti, so I undercooked by a couple minutes and got a wonderfully crispy (but not rock-hard) biscotti.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Very good flavor. Just sweet enough. My dough was really dry, so I added an extra egg white. With the extra moisture, it was just fine. Someone else mentioned baking them for only 5 minutes the first time, because they crumbled when cutting after 15 minutes. I would agree and will try baking them 5-10 minutes next time.

Very good biscotti. I had to add one extra egg however, cuz was too dry otherwise. I also made a mistake that did no harm. I brushed the cookie log with be beaten egg before the first bake and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Worked out fine in spite of my lousy memory. I love cinnamon, so next time i think I will up it a bit.

Made these this weekend with 'help' from my young son...and they are really, really good. Normally the boyfriend won't eat any baked goods that are not fresh out of the oven, but he said they were good the next day too! Will make again. I shaped them into logs only about 1 1/2 inches wide, then baked, then cut them into little squares to make 'bites' and then rebaked. Just the right amount of cinnamon.

Wonderful recipe, really easy to make and perfect with some coffee! Thank you!  UPDATE: My husband literally left only one biscotti in the whole container, and he "doesn't like sweets." Wow!

Have made this several times & it is always wonderful.  My kids think it tastes like cinnamon toast!  Doesn't make a large batch, but it is very good!

I made these for the first time and doubled it as I know how fast biscotti can go in my house. I never had a problem with the crumbling but I added 4 full eggs (dbld recipe) and I also didn't wait for the 15 minutes to cool before I cut them. They did however sit sliced and sprinkled for a half hour while my "second batch" was still in the oven. For the second baking, I gave them 20 minutes and they were delicious! A definite keeper!

These are a TOTAL diet killer! Made a few changes as per other reviewers: used 2 eggs but found that this did make the dough a bit too moist so I probably could have stuck to the recipe as I had to add 1/4 cup of flour to counteract the stickiness. I also drizzled over a cinnamon glaze- without this I would have only given the recipe 4 stars but the glaze kicks it up a notch- soo moreish!

These were fantastic. It is the first time I have ever made biscotti successfully. Very easy and tasty, I made them for my older sister's boyfriend as part of a cookie tin for Christmas! Thanks so much for a fool-proof, delicious cookie recipe!

**THANK YOU** Angela C. for the amazing suggestion of using this base recipe but omitting the cinnamon and adding white chocolate and craisins! I added 1 cup of craisins and 4 sq of chopped white chocolate and then sprinkled finely grated white chocolate and white sugar on top before the final bake.  YUM YUM YUM!!!!

These were a HUGE hit. I 1 1/2 times the recipe and used two whole eggs. It made two logs. 
When I sliced them and added the sugar for their second baking time, I somehow got the oven turned to 500 degrees!! I could smell something sweet and that alerted me to check the oven! Luckily, I use a Silpat so it wasn't messy and they turned out even better with the hint of dark brown! They were still the best. My gf even called and told me she "liked them a little burnt"!

I will def make these again and again.

Awesome tasting biscotti, tastes just like a snickerdoodle!  I have made it 5+ times now and I prefer it without the egg wash. The egg wash really makes the biscotti look unappetizing.

Great Recipe!!! For the last 15 min. of cooking, I split it in half and turned them over and put more cinnamon sugar on the other side. Also, as they came out of the oven, i brushed them with melted butter. Turned out excellent!

A great simple biscotti that I incorporated into my Christmas Cookie Assortment this past year! I prefer a very crunchy biscotti, so I baked the second time for about 20 minutes longer and it turned out great.  Perfect dunker with a cuppa!

Wonderful recipe.  The bread is a little crumbley the first time out of the oven, but turns out great once they go in for the second time.  To add to it, I put a simple vanilla icing on top after they cool for a bit (4 tbsp butter melted in small pot with 1 tbsp of water - once melted take off heat, let cool 5 mins and add 1/2 cup confectioners sugar - whisk until smooth and drizzle immediately)  These were incredible!  I love biscotti, and I think I've found the recipe that I'll stick with.

I didn't need half of the cinnamon sugar mixture at the end; I baked them the second time for 10-15 longer in order to get them crisp enough. Flavor was just too flat for me.

Loved this.  I substitued half white whole wheat and half all purpose flour.  Chose my 2 largest fresh eggs to combine.  Did not need to add another egg as some of the reviews recommended.  Baked for 17 minutes and sliced and baked for 15 minutes.  This is not rock hard this way and my kids loved it.  Next time I will add craisins and pecans.  Yum!

This was absolutely yummy! After reading reviews before making them, I changed a few things that made them PERFECT!
I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup bread flour, 2 eggs, added chocolate chips,before baking the second time, I brushed melted butter over each side, then sprinkled cinnamon sugar over each side. I rolled it out to just one log, to make longer biscotti and when they came out and cooled, I drizzled milk and white chocolate over them...they were gone the same day!

Not the best ever but pretty darn good. Would call this recipe a keeper for sure. Especially pairs well with a hot cup of coffee because they were not overly sweet so not to compete with your drink. Might try with 1/2 tsp of almond extract instead of vanilla next time just to see what happens.

This was my first time making biscotti and it turned out wonderful.  Great with a cup of hot tea.  I think this recipe has a lot of potential for trying other combinations, cranberry and pistachio anyone?

I made this just as the recipe says - twice - and they came out wonderful each time.  I would suggest patting the logs down until they were a little wider than 1 1/2 inches, to make a longer cookie.  The cook times were a little shorter in my oven.  And I didn't need parchment paper, just a really light dusting of non-stick spray.

Wonderful Recipe!  The only thing I changed was to add almond extract instead of vanilla as some reviewers commented on a bland flavour.  I also took the one reviewers suggestion to add the flour 1/4c at a time and blend well between.  I thought the dough would not come together when I turned it out from the mixer...but I kneeded it a bit and it came together well.  My boyfriend is not a cookie lover and he has already eaten 3.  

I also found that 15 minutes for the 2nd bake was not quite long enough...I "toasted" the cookies for a full 25 minutes and they were still a little soft in the centre.

Great recipe, I will definitely make this again.

These were fantastic.  Super easy to make and they taste way too good.  The only change I made was to only use the leftover egg white to brush on the logs.

A different taste for biscotti.  Dough was OK to work with.  The egg wash really did not add too much.

I thought these were pretty good, but the people I served them to loved them, so I give them 4 stars.  I personally wanted more cinnamon flavor to them, but I am a cinnamon freak!  I followed the recipe exactly, but then my dough would not hold together, so I had to use half of the beaten egg (for brushing) and that was enough to make it work.  These are also good with a cinnamon glaze drizzled on top.

Holy wow! These are really (really) good! I used two eggs like a lot of other reviewers. I also used 2 tsp of cinnamon in the dough because I didn't read very carefully. After baking the logs, I waited just about 8-10 minutes before slicing and I didn't have any trouble with them crumbling. In fact, they cut really clean. I'll make these over and over and over and over and over... :-) YUMMY!

Mmmm... fantastic! I halved the recipe to try it out (just used one egg, and sprayed w/ oil instead of brushing w/egg). Turned out fabulous and crunchy!

Also, I sliced them with a very sharp serrated knife. I found the key was to saw more than cut, and then they didn't fall apart.

Great! As others mentioned, the dough was crumbly but I was just very careful with it, and they still turned out great. Made a double batch and took them to work; they were gone by 10:00 a.m.  What really made them move from "great" to "awesome" was drizzling them with a coffee glaze!

I loved this biscotti recipe.  I make all kinds of biscotti and this is one of my favorites.  I added an additional egg so that the dough does not crumble so easily.  Will try next time with raisins.

awesome recipe to use.  This was my first time baking biscottis and was very simple and easy for me. I followed exactly but added 2 whole eggs. Great flavor and texture.  I also drizzled melted white chocolate on a few.  My family loved them!

I made one log as recipe states and 1 log with sliced almonds.  Both cookies came out excellent.  I used xlg eggs and I really didn't have a problem with it being too crumbly.

Good recipe.  Very reminiscent of cinnamon toast.  I'm serving them as a finale to my Easter brunch along with fruit kabobs with coconut dip.  I'm sure my family is going to love these great crunchies.  I love making biscotti.  They're so easy, but serve them to the uninitiated and they think you're a pro!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the first biscotti I have made and I love it already. I made it for a gift to go with a mug and starbucks giftcard so the person could stay in and enjoy or go to starbucks. It was super easy. My bf who doesn't do much baking helped and we mixed the dough in my food processor which made it SO much easier than mixing by hand.

I did not change even a granule of measure and I couldn't get the dough to stick. It was more of a crumble. So after treating it like cement to form a log, the dough continued to crumble when cut. The end product was not asthetically pleasing at all and taste how it looked.

absolutely delicious.  i followed the recipe and they came out perfectly.  i did take the liberty of only forming one log because i wanted a bigger biscotti and it worked just fine.  had to bake them a bit longer the second time but that's not a problem for such a great end result!  will make these again and again.  thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

These are the best biscotti I've ever made!  I've made it many times and sometimes I add craisins, nuts, or chocolate chips!  These are delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe!  The biscotti tasted a lot like cinnamon toast and eating them made me feel like a little kid again.  The only (minor) thing I have to say is that amount of the cinnamon/sugar mixture that it calls for to sprinkle over the cookies at the end is a little bit too much - I could have probably done with about half of that and still had enough to make the biscotti very tasty.

This was my first time making biscotti and it turned out fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and just tried out a few pieces with decaf after dinner tonight and it was delicious. Not rock hard like some biscotti but just right!

I've made many kinds of biscotti and I think I found my favorite! I added 1 T. of maple syrup and some chopped walnuts.
Excellent!

I made this biscotti today & I gotta say..... it made me feel all warm & fuzzy inside! :D (The cinnamony-sugary taste reminded me of the holidays.)

When they were done they really did look like biscotti & I was very pleased. My only problem was that I forgot to add the baking powder & maybe I didn't bake them long enough because they reminded me more of a cookie but the taste was O.K. (at least my mom liked them!)

I followed other reviewers recommendation of using two whole eggs and the recipe turned out perfectly.  Although, I made one log instead of two -I don't really see how this recipe would have made two logs unless the biscotti were tiny.  The dough was sticky, but I was fine just wetting my hands.  I had no problem cutting the biscotti - I think it probably has to do with using the right knife.  

Overall, this recipe is wonderful and I would make it again tomorrow!

This is a recipe for perfect Biscotti.
I used baking soda instead of powder,
and two whole eggs - just mixed it all together - didnt use the beaten egg - didnt cut them, and sprayed tops with pam, and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before the second bake.  Yummy.

This turned out great and was very easy to make.  I substituted Spenda for suger, almond extact for vanilla and added slivered almonds.  Very good.  I will continue to use this recipe as a 'base' for other variations.

This was very easy and came out great! The dough was a little dry for me so I added a tbs of milk and that fixed it. I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious! I made a batch and my girlfriends ate them all in one sitting! I also made some frosting to drizzle over them (powdered sugar, cinnamon, milk). I will definitely add this to my biscotti recipe collection. Thank you!

My first attempt at biscotti and they turned out great. I used the basic recipe but actually made them orange and ginger instead of cinnamon suger. I used orange zest, fresh OJ in place of vanilla, and fresh ginger. Wonderful and easy!

This was good, maybe a little bland and needs tweaking IMHO. If I make this again, I think I'll add maybe some pumpkin and a little nutmeg. It's a good basic recipe, though. Also, you only have to wait about 5 minutes to cut it into biscotti, otherwise it can fall apart in my *limited* experience. Thanks for sharing.

Can't say I liked them - although dipped into coffee it was ok. The yield is off: the recipe made 20 cookies rather than 40.

Oh My...Sooo Good!.  I followed the recipe to the tee.  I would definetly suggest using a stand mixer with a decent wattage and make sure every step is well blended before you proceed to the next step.  The only addition I made was adding a half cup of halved almonds.  This is sure to be a staple recipe in my kitchen.  So easy and so delicious.  No need to dunk.

Just made this today for an Italian themed party I am going to.  I've never tasted biscotti, so I had no idea what to expect.  It is very crispy and tasty.  I enjoyed sampling it.  Very easy to make.  I love the cinnamon.  I think it is sugary enough alone if you don't want to add icing.  And it is very crumbly and hard to work with, but I hear that is expected of a good biscotti recipe.  Great recipe, thank you.

Great recipe!  I have used this as the basic recipe for other biscotti.  Taking out some of the cinnamon and adding almonds or chocolate chunks! yum !   I found before, it was crumbling ( typical of biscotti!)  I heated the butter slightly before creaming it , and didn't  cook it as long the first round . Both methods seemed to help

Flavor is good. Simple to make.  They crumbled apart when I was slicing them after the first go round with the oven.  And I had to bake them longer than called for.  They were too soft after taking them out the 2nd time!

Who knew making biscotti was so easy?!?! This was my first biscotti recipe and it turned out great! I did use the whole 2nd egg, as someone else suggested. It was a perfect companion for chai tea latte!

I'm giving this four stars only because I will make these again and the final taste was very good, however, I didn't enjoy the process too much.  They were not that easy to make.  The dough was really soft and difficult to handle.  I lost much of it in the process and ws left with lots of crumbs....I'll try one more time...perhaps I missed something

These were SO good! I am not an expert on biscotti but I made these exactly by the recipe and they came out perfect. I don't know why some people said they had trouble with crumbling but I know it helps to add a bit of flour at a time and mix well. Also, the egg at the end gave them a pretty shine. I will be making this again and again.

My first attempt at making biscotti and it didn't go too badly.  I had some problems with crumbling while slicing the baked loaves and I'm not sure why.  I melted some Hershey's Cinnamon Chips and drizzled them over the finished product.  Yum!

DH loved these and he isn't overly fond of biscotti.  They are flavorful and is to make.  I am looking forward to my morning cup of coffee tomorrow!  DH has already asked me to make another batch tomorrow.

This is a good recipe. I've made it twice now, both times it came out a bit crumbly - but it's still good. This time I spiced it up a bit and added chocolate chips and orange vodka...very, very good!!!!

These are the best! Great recipe of things you always have on hand. I followed the recipe exact. I've made these several time and they always turn out just as good as the first time. My only gripe would be that they are small. I've considered making just one log but haven't tried that that. These are great to make when you're hosting a party with a bunch of ladies. Impressive and delish!

Very tasty! I omitted the final sprinking with sugar and cinnamon.
I also substituted vanilla extract for a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.
Worked just fine. Great with your morning coffee!

These biscotti were pretty good but i think they were missing a little something, everyone else that tried them loved them. I would make these again but next time i think i'll add chopped pecans or walnuts and maybe a little vanilla.

I am going to be making biscotti gift baskets so I have been trying out different recipes. So far, these are THE BEST! I used 2 whole eggs and actually found the dough to be a bit sticky, so I worked in a little more flour as I made the logs. 
I forgot the egg wash ( oops) so the tops looked "blah" after the first bake. For a quick fix ( a cinnamon glaze would have also done the trick) I brushed on some milk then sprinkled cinnamon-sugar over the top before slicing the logs into individual pieces. I still added cinn-sugar to the cut sides as per the recipe and it was not too much.

GOOD STUFF! I made this for Christmas cookies along with homemade cocoa mix and it was a great recipe. The only tiny thing I would do different next time is bake it a little less during the second bake time or add a little milk or something. I think it's because we live in a really dry climate and it turned out a tiny bit too dry and crunchy. Otherwise, perfect recipe!

I was very nervous about making this when I first put the dough on the cookie sheet, but to my surprise they came out wonderful! For some reason the biscottis were tiny, but they tasted very good and everyone loved them. I would only recommend doubling the recipe and I dunked them in chocolate for a richer flavor.  Very good!!

This is my first attempt at biscotti and it turned out wonderfully!  I only let mine cool for about 10 minutes and had no problems cutting it.  I did use a very sharp serrated knife and went very slowly.  I didn't sprinkle cinnamon/sugar on at the end, but drizzled melted chocolate chips on the cookies instead.  I'm going to serve these at an Italian themed dinner party this weekend.  What a great recipe!

It is the first time I am baking and eating biscotti, so can't compare it... but I liked what I made. I used 2 whole eggs, as suggested by other reviewers. The dough is quite sticky and it might help if you wet your hands before making the logs to prevent it from sticking. I had to bake it a little longer than recommended, but that could becuase my oven is old. The end result was really nice.. Not too strong a taste, but goes very well with coffee or cocoa.. We love the cinnamon here, so it was a hit. :)

My whole family loved it. I made it for my grandfather's liberation day because he survived the Holocaust and my whole family couldn't stop eating them! Even my brother's best-friend's dad loved them and he is a big food critic and loves to cook. Very well done!

I was disappointed these didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and two eggs, otherwise, everything as directed, but maybe that was enough to throw off the results.  The dough seemed dry and the flavor was bland, in spite of all that good cinnamon.

Yum.  I also added 2 eggs (did not bother with 1 yolk).  I also added the cinnamon chips.  They were even good before the second baking.

This recipe was fantastic. My friend is italian, so I made this as a gift. Her whole family devoured all 48 of them within a few hours, saying they were better than the store bought biscotti they had recently purchased. Great job!

I used slightly less butter, and the dough turned out very crumbly, making the slicing of the biscotti kind of messy.  The flavor was great, though!  I used even more cinnamon and a little pumpkin pie spice.  I underbaked a little to keep them from getting too hard, and they tasted delicious!

Awesome biscotti.  I didn't bother with the egg yolk either..just left it out.  This was my first time making it and it came out great...just the right amount of sugar and great with tea. I made a bunch for xmas gifts and got great reviews!!

OMG !  This recipe is " off the hook " ! I've never had a recipe that was SO simple yet SO delicious.  Yesterday I made my Christmas cookie " sampler " plates for friends and family.  This cinnamon biscotti was the one cookie that got rave reviews .  I got my husband ( who NEVER likes to try anything new ) to eat one of these cookies.  Ten minutes later when I came back, 7 of the biscotti were gone !
Thank you, thank you, thank you for this sweet little gem of a cookie.  A keeper for sure.

These were liked by the family.  I haven't personally tasted them, but did think they felt a little harder than I like.  Next time I will bake for only about 10 min on the 2nd baking.

I'm a beginner so I've never made biscotti before but these turned out pretty well. For some reason, I totally forgot about the butter and it was sitting right in front of me. After combining the dry ingredients with the sugar and egg mixture, it just didn't seem right and I realized I forgot butter! I melted the butter and added it afterwards and it was fine. Several pieces crumbled while I was cutting them into pieces and I definitely had too  much of the sugar/cinnamon left over after sprinkling the biscotti quite generously so I would halve that the next time I bake them. I don't drink coffee and I'm not a huge fan of tea either so I ended up dipping these into warm white vanilla cocoa for breakfast and they were absolutely delicious!

tasty recipe, however I would recommend upping the cook temp to 350 since at 325 my biscotti even with the double baking didn't bake thoroughly.

This was pretty good...not the best biscotti, however it had a very nice colour, cooked easily, and had a nice crunchy biscotti texture. I would probably make this again, however it was nothing spectacular.

The biscotti was crumbly, and sprinkling all that cinnamon & sugar was messy, but...I don't care! I made biscotti! This was easy and it was good. Especially with coffee. Yum. It wasn't  too sweet nor hard like I thought biscottis were like. And I had all the ingredients in my cupboard so i didn't have to go out to buy special ingredients. Nice. I may opt to use less flour or add more fat next time so it doesn't fall apart so easily. At least I think that may help. Though the dough itself was sticky enough as is.

I made these for my sister and she loved them!  Instead of making little biscotti I formed the dough into two round bread-bowl like shapes and baked them.  That way I had bigger biscotti for dunking into coffee.  Easy recipe for me,a college student on a budget who can't keep alot of ingredients on hand and a beginner cook!!

This was extremely dry and crumbly for even a biscotti. I think a tad more fat would help it hold together better, but still I really enjoyed these.

I know that biscotti is dry, but I really blew this recipe. Unless you have a good dental plan, I suggest you use this cookie as a dunker. The flavour was good but I would not serve my batch of there cookies to company. Maybe I cooked them too long?

Read the reviews. Dough is the crumbliest I’ve ever made.  I would try again by adding a whole egg instead of just a yolk.

Followed directions except for the sprinkling of cinnamon-sugar mess (makes cookies too messy for me) and they turned out fantastic.  I'm a very novice baker so I recommend this recipe to pretty much everyone!

I made this about an hour ago, it didn't really end up as well as she describes. It is super soft (although I cooked it for 30 minutes) and doesn't have a biscotti texture, but It might just be me. Try this recipe out, although soft, it is super delicious.

I made these for Christmas and the only changes were 2 full eggs and some cardamom with the cinnamon. They will be a Christmas staple.  Delicious!

Hubby declared this a winner!  I did, however, make changes due to reading the reviews.  I added extra cinnamon to give more flavor.  I did not form logs on a floured surface as I felt that would make them more dry; rather, I formed the logs with wet hands and a spatula.  I used two eggs in the recipe and did not brush them with a beaten egg.  Other than a touch of cinnamon and changing the way I formed the logs, I followed the recipe and it was YUMMY!  I sprinkled both sides with the cinnamon sugar.   Thank you SARA LEE for sharing.

This is the best and easiest biscotti recipe I've found. I've made it twice in the last week and several time before. I always have the ingredients on hand and it makes my apartment smell so good. I don't like super hard biscotti so I take it out 5 minutes or so beforehand. It's still nice and crispy though. This is definitely one of my favorite recipes!

This recipe is very different from the biscotti recipes I'm used to.. But decided to make as written. It was only Okay. I love the Cinnamon sugar topping. However the consistency of this biscotti is odd, too too crumbly and easily breaks (not in a good way). I wouldn't make a written again.. But i will use the Cinnamon sugar topping topping to sprinkle on a regular vanilla biscotti. I recommend using 2 whole eggs instead.

I will def do it again, added 2 whole eggs as other mentioned, and the dry mix little by little, the dough was smooth and easy to hold. After cooled I added melted chocolate on the bottom just to give it an extra kick and its more appealing fo the kids, just let the chocolate harden again and enjoy.

Biscotti seemed a bit intimidating at first, but was surprisingly very easy.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and these came out perfect.   Enjoyed them with my morning coffee.

Wow! My first attempt at making biscotti! This recipe does not dissappoint! Im on weight watchers so I made a few substitution to help bring the calorie/fat content down. Instead of butter I used equal amount apple sauce and I used equal amount of white wheat flour. Turned out PERFECT! I added 1/2 cup slightly thawed blueberries & white chocolate chips. Delicious! Only 1 1/2 points (classic) each! Cant argue with that! Love love love this recipe! Oh! I did also use 2 whole eggs in the base as recommended by other reviewers ??

The only thing I did differently was i added an extra egg.  My dough was incredibly dry without it.  It made a beautiful dough... Easy to form... And the end result tastes like a snickerdoodle

This worked out SO well.  Followed directions exactly except just used 2 whole eggs in dough.  After biscotti cooled, dipped in melted white chocolate that I had mixed cinnamon and nutmeg into.

This was my very first time making biscotti, and this is a very easy recipe to follow and understand. I made this for a church gathering and everyone loved it!! Compliments came in masses, I'm not kidding!! Other reviewers said they had trouble with the dough being too dry and crumbly. I did not have this problem at all. Maybe it was because I added the flour mixture in small amounts at a time, mixing it in thoroughly before adding more. The dough was very easy to work with. If you happen to be out of parchment paper, like I was, just spray your baking sheets really well with nonstick cooking spray. It worked perfectly. We dipped ours in melted white chocolate. YUM!!

Yum!! 2nd time I've made them :) It has been a few years since I made them and I didn't remember if the dough was too crumbly before and I read some of the reviews that said to use the 2 whole eggs, but it was too sticky so I had to add a little more flour.. I also didn't brush it with egg wash and it turned out perfect :) I did use some melted butter so the cinnamon sugar mix stuck better also. A++

This wasn't that great. The biscotti was somewhat bland, usually our family gobbles up sweets, but these were slow to be eaten. I wouldn't make these again. It's not even a good base recipe to use.

These were a big hit! I probably should have doubled the recipe - I made them a bit larger than suggested, so I didn't have as many as I had hoped. I had never made biscotti before - this recipe was so easy!

My brother and I made 3 biscotti recipes from this site for a mother's day gift this year. They all turned out great. I followed previous suggestions and used 2 whole eggs, however we still found the dough to be a bit dry so we added some water until we could work with it. We formed two thick logs, approx. 9 inches in length each and then patted them down so that they were under an inch thick. After the first bake we sliced the logs on an angle into 1 inch thick pieces, which yielded about 10 pieces of biscotti. We did have to add some baking time to our batch due to the thickness of our biscotti pieces. We substituted Splenda for the sugar that went into the dough and used regular sugar for the cinnamon sugar topping. The consistency was more like a cookie, rather than the hard/crisp store-bought biscotti that I am used to. This was our first time making this italian delight, but it was still a great result nonetheless. Mutti enjoyed her gift.

i made these for my boyfriend hoping they'd be impressive, they weren't bad, they were just okay. I'd suggest doing a cinnamon-sugar glaze if you can whip up something reasonable.

I love this recipe. It's fussy, but worth it. I've made these several years in a row for Christmas gifts and they seem to be a hit with the coffee drinkin' crowd.

Oops... I ran out of cinnamon, but I still wanted to try this recipe out an it came out FANTASTIC!!  Besides leaving out the cinnamon, I used turbinado sugar in place of the white sugar and I think it made it special... more so than if I had used white sugar :)

I had really high hopes for this recipe, and while it was good, it wasn't great.  Another reviewer commented that it was kind of "blah" and I would have to agree.  I tried this recipe to see if I would include it on my Christmas cookie trays and I have to say that it didn't make the cut.  Sorry.

These were very good - my kids and husband all really liked them.  The dough was a bit crumbly and I had a hard time getting it to roll into logs, but overall very, very yummy!  I will be making another batch or two again today for my Christmas cookie boxes to give away.

This was my first time making biscotti and I had some trouble.  My ingredients did not form a dough.  I had to very firmly press the ingredients into logs.  There was no way I was able to roll the dough.  I probably should have softened the butter but the recipe did not say to do that so I didn't.  I was careful when I cut the cookies so they would not crumble.  The flavor was very good.  I will definitely make these again just with softened butter next time.

This is a wonderful recipe! :) I have even gotten those self-proclaimed biscotti haters hooked on this recipe!  This is definitely one of our most favorite recipes for biscotti of all time! :)

These were great!  I added a little more flour because my dough was pretty "wet" when I tried to roll.  Otherwise perfect!

I loved these. I added the cinnamon chips also. They got a little burned on the bottom, but were still great! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

This is one of the best biscotti I have ever tasted.  The only thing I changed was the qty of sugar and cinnamon for the sprinkle mix at the end.  1T & 1/2tsp cinnamon.

Delicious biscotti -- more like the biscotti I had in Italy (small, not rock hard).  Seems like a recipe ripe for personalization.

Great tasting, easy to make and they didn't fall apart on me like other biscotti recipes I've tried.

I found these reminded me of a spicy shortbread rather than most biscotti I have made before.  Overall quite good.  Children (and my husband) loved it.
