A tasty, healthy meal that couldn't be easier! I used Bertoli Organic Marinara because I had it on hand and the finished product was delicious. A perfect weekday meal, well suited for a low-carb diet. This one's a keeper!

I often wonder how something so simple can be so flavorful. I used the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe from this site that I make and keep on hand.  Perfect!

This one is a keeper. Quick for a weeknight meal. And, oh so good left over!!
I only had small fresh mozz balls at home, and this worked well in the recipe. I think I will stick to this ingredient.

Yum!  I left out the salt and added spirals of carrots (I needed to use it up) and minced garlic. Otherwise prepared as written.  I liked this better than conventional chicken parmesan.  Serve with a nice crusty bread.

I used only two zucchini (large) and 3 large chicken breasts because that's all I had. We had enough zucchini. I used Vodka sauce instead of marinara because my hubby doesn't like the marinara as much as he gets older. Will I make it again? Yes. What will I do differently? Less Italian seasoning on the zucchini which I'm happy to say I did not overcook. I think I will cut the breasts into 3rds before pounding them and pound them more. I didn't pound them enough. Seems like it took a lot longer than 20 minutes to prepare...

My husband made this dish for me - it was terrific!! (As we are newly married,  this is actually his first meal he's ever cooked for me) :)    I loved the spiral zucchini 'noodles'! Also, the fresh mozzarella and sauce were perfect toppings for the chicken.  A guilt-free, healthy meal - this recipe is a winner in my book!......I think he's a keeper too ;)

We have lots of garden zucchini in the summer and we tired of having grilled, baked, and fried.  This is different way to use it that our whole family loves!

This was delicious! I didn’t have sliced mozzarella and used shredded but perfect. We will have this again and again.

This is a keeper! So simple, and a much healthier alternative than traditional breaded with noodles chicken parm! We loved it (I used PC blue menu marinara as it’s our favourite) and it will become a regular in our house for sure! I did find it a tad bit salty so I will use a bit less next time, but I loved the Italian seasoning in the zucchini noodles! Gave them a great flavour

The chicken was excellent.  However, the zucchini was a little salty, and the Italian seasoning was overpowering.  Next time, I will use less salt and just top with marinara sauce.

First time making zucchini pasta and cooking in general as my wife is the cook generally. This recipe was easy enough for me and healthier. It turned out amazing.
