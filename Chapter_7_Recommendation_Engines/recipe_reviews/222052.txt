I don't want to give something 5 stars unless it is truly exceptional, so 4 stars still means it was excellent and I'd make it again. 

I didn't make it exactly the way the recipe called for though.  Someone else said the Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies was too hot so I just used a can of regular diced tomatoes, (I'm not a fan of hot spices).  I also used 2 Cups of Basmati rice instead of one because 1 cup didn't sound like it would be enough, and of course, I added at least 2 extra cups of water in order to hydrate the extra cup of rice that I used.  

The original recipe seemed like it would be a little bland, without many spices, so I added 1 tsp cumin, 2 teaspoons Oregano, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper, 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 small can of sliced black olives chopped, and a handful of green olives chopped.  Remember I used 2 Cups of rice instead of one, so these amounts of spices might be a little too much if  just one cup of rice is used.

Wish that I had seen Koolchick's warning  Had never used Rotel tomatoes with green chilis before, and the result was very hot (spicey)..  Next time I will use plain tomatoes.

Trying to duplicate my mother's Spanish rice and this came very close. I used a can of mexican-style chopped tomatoes w/lime and a can of thin spaghetti sauce; also used sliced turkey sausage instead of ground meat.  Nice "kick" to it w/out too much heat. Will fix again, maybe with chicken or shrimp next time.

Have made this same recipe for years.  You can use any kind of rice you like.  We like Basmati.

I used a vine ripe tomato and a jalapeño instead of Rotel. I put them in with the green pepper and onion. I also added minced garlic and garlic pepper from the McCormick grinder.
