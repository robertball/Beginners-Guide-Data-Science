I added agave nectar to sweeten and a teaspoon of rum extract to make it taste more like traditional nog, yummy

I'm sure the rice milk and non-dairy dessert would be good, but I tried it with evaporated milk (left over from another pumpkin recipe) and vanilla frozen yogurt and added a bit of sugar (a little bitter otherwise), and it was very yummy - nice and creamy.

I loved this. I used Vitasoy instead of rice milk the last time I did this. It is a little thicker than the rice milk. Either way it's awesome!

Very yummy! Tastes like pumpkin pie! My son is allergic to dairy and egg- so now he knows what pumpkin pie tastes like!

I had Very Vanilla soymilk in the house so used that and reduced the sugar. Thinned it out a little, too, to make it easier for him to drink through a straw. Thanks for the recipe!

I was very excited to try out this nog recipe since we love the pumpkin flavored nog by Silk and have a hard time finding it.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but my 3 daughters and I thought this was terrible.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was bitter, way too thick to drink, and bland.  If you like eating plain pumkin out of the can, this recipe is for you.  But, if you prefere desserts with flavorful rich autumn tastes, then you will be dissapointed.  I even tried thinning the drink with more milk and adding sugar, and it still made me want to gag.  Oh, well, I love pumpkin, so it was worth a try.

I loved it, but I changed the recipe a bit. I used soy milk instead of rice milk, added allspice and cloves, doubled the cinnamon, and added agave and maple syrup to sweeten it.
