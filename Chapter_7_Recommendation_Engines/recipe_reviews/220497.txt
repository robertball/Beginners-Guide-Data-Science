I found this recipe light flavor, tangy, refreshing, healthy, and super easy to make.  I love the green onion cashew flavor mix.

Great ingredients, to be faster though I used bottled miso dressing, and only had 1/2 bag of coleslaw it was really good.

Did not go down too well in my family;  ingredients are great but did not like the dressing;  perhaps next time I will make with a different dressing.
