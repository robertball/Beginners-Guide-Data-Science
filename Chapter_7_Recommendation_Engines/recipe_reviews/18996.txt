I am always asked to make this again...there is never enough! I used 5 cups fresh french bread, cut out one of the eggs, and did what an earlier reviewer suggested: use half brown sugar and half white sugar, and I used half milk and half cream. I also sprinkled some raisins on top as an after thought. It turned out great because the people who don't eat raisins can just pick them off instead of digging for them. I used a regular 8x13 brownie pan on just my oven rack, no water bath, reduced the temp and baked for well over an hour. (If I even get a hint of egg taste, I won't eat it...this doesn't taste like eggs.)Marvelous recipe! I always bake it when the kids are sleeping and hide it so I don't have to share. I'm greedy!

Awesome recipe. The sauce is definitely a winner and should be used warm. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to bread pudding and also used nutmeg in the sauce. Incredible! Cooks well not in a water bath too, just lower the heat a little.

I've been using this recipe for 6+ yrs & it is my most requested recipe. I make it for comfort food. It is a custard-like pudding, not thick & dry (although I do add a little extra bread. I use unsliced Italian or french bread with crust removed cut or torn in lrg. squares. I add 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and hi-quality fresh vanilla and unsalted butter. This always needs to cook longer than the 1 hour called for. I now use a glass dish so that I can see precisely when it is done and not overcooked.

Before I made this recipe I read all the comments, so instead of using an 8x8 I used an 8x11 pan.  The pudding was still moist but not watery.  We loved it!!!  The sauce was perfect, did not change a thing!!  Thank you for sharing, this will be added to my favorites and it will be part of our family recipes.

This was the first bread pudding I've ever made.  I took it to work and my co-workers loved it.  My supervisor said it was the best thing he had put in his mouth in a long time.  I used raisin bread and added a couple of tablespoons of bourbon to the sauce -- Good work Missi!

I did add 1 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. cinnamon to the bread pudding. Used french bread (approximately four cups). Will probably eliminate crust of french bread. Pudding was GREAT...sauce was GREAT without any additions to the recipe.

This bread pudding is the BEST ever!  My new favorite recipe!  Since I didn't use the full carton of heavy cream (the recipe calls for a 1/2 cup) I whipped what was left into whip cream to use on top.

This is a nice, moist bread pudding. Putting the bread in boiling milk prevents having the chunks of dry bread that sometimes occur with other bread puddings. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, skipped the water bath, and omitted the sauce (I was serving it for lunch, not dessert and wanted to avoid all that sugar and fat). The family enjoyed it.

i have never had bread pudding b4 and i dont like rice pudding (b-cause of the texture) but this was very yummy!  the sauce is FABULOUS!  i used day old cinnamon bread and sprinkled nutmeg on top b4 i baked it.  i was a little daunted by the water-bath technique, but the pudding was firm and custardy, not soggy and gross, thanks to the water-bath (i think).  it's a very christmas-y tasting dish.  BUT VERY SWEET!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I have made it a couple of times already with different flavored extracts for the sauce and it is wonderful.  I have used lemon, rum, and vanilla.

I am a bread pudding expert! This is not a good recipe. It's an egg custard with bread, and not a whole lot of substance.  The egg taste really came through. The sauce was good but not a lot of flavor, just amazing number of calories. Don't serve it immediately after it comes from the oven. Allow it to cool and "set up," or it will be too wet, like some other reviewers must have discovered.  I actually thought it was better cooled substantially.  I won't make this again.

This recipe is so yummy.  I made 2 loaves of homemade french bread the night before.  I thought I would make bread pudding with the day old leftover bread.  The family loved it.  I followed the direction for the bread pudding exactly, but I made two sauces.  For the cream sauce I used 1 cup of heavy cream & I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also made a caramel sauce with brown sugar,  butter, and a little cream.  I topped the bread pudding with a combination of the two sauces.

I thought this was the best bread pudding I have ever made.  I have some friends that really enjoyed it also.    I did not have any bread when I tried it the first time so I used raisin bagels instead it was great.  Judy Johnson  New Mexico

This is one of my top 10 favorite desserts!  Loved even by those who don't like bread pudding!  I use blueberry bagels - slice in half horizontally then cut into cubes.  The blueberry lends a wonderful light flavor.  This should 'rest' awhile before eating, as others have said.  Plus, it's hard to remove the baking dish from its water bath.  
So, I remove the whole pan from the oven when done baking and place on a trivet on the counter (still in its water bath). 1/2 hour or so later you can easily remove the pudding from the water bath and it will still be warm - ready to eat.  Incredible!

Loved this recipe.My husband, who has absolutely hated bread puddings all his adult life actually tried this one and then went back for seconds.Incredible!!! 
Keep in mind though,if you are not a sweet tooth you may want to cut the amount of sugar required down to half.

I made this bread pudding for my family and it got rave reviews. My mom used to make a similar one when I was a child, but like all the in my moms day they never wrote anything down, so I never got to make hers. Wow did this recipe take me back. Thank you Missi

I made this for Christmas dinner. I baked it the night before, even made the sauce earlier in the day and just reheated in the microwave before serving. It was a hit! I used raisin bread in place of the regular bread, doubled the sauce and cut the sugar by 1/4 of a cup total. Awesome!

This recipe was great, but I made a few changes based on the reviews I read.  I, like others, added 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp nutmeg and 1/2c raisins to the mixture.  I also used 5c bread instead of 3.  Instead of whole milk I used 3c. 1% milk (scalded) and 1c.of heavy cream.  I let the bread soak into the mixture for 45minutes.  I placed the dish in the oven for about 45 in 350 (no water bath).  It was to die for!!! This recipe was great, but I made a few changes based on the reviews I read.  I, like others, added 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp nutmeg and 1/2c raisins to the mixture.

This was fantastic!  I did make some modifications to it though.  I used homemade french bread that was on the verge of being stale.  Also, instead of using all milk, I used 2 1/2 cups milk and 1 1/2 cups heavy cream.  I also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Added a touch of cinnamon and it was perfect!! I didn't even make the sauce, because it just looked too sweet.  I doubled this recipe and made a 9x13 pan, baked for an hour and 20 minutes! Thanks for the perfect bread pudding recipe!

Delicious.  The sauce makes the whole dessert.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg for a little spice, and used cranberry pecan bread, which worked very nicely.

This is the same kind of bread pudding my mother made when we (eight of us) were growing up - more like an egg custard with bread in it. My mother's recipe is very similar. She made a dish for a friend of ours who took it to a church social back in the 1980's. A man liked it so much, he took the dish home and promised to return it. That man was Muhammad Ali, who came to the front door with the dish in his hand, requesting more bread pudding (true story).

Made this for Christmas dinner. The whole family (4 generations) raved about it.  The pudding is pretty bland without the sauce, but with it -- tops.

I was a bit hesitant at first since I had never made bread pudding before......but WOW...this was super.  I did make changes after reading other reviews and added raisins, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Made a mistake and added the butter to the actual bread pudding rather than the sauce.. but is only made it better!  Everyone LOVED it.  Cut the  sugar in half and added a little more cream to the sauce.  My in-laws are already asking when I will make it again!  Mahalo (thanks) for this great recipe!

This is the ALL-TIME BEST bread pudding.  I have taken it to work for parties many times and EVERYONE raves about it, that is why I have to make it several times a month.  I usually add coconut and raisins.  Thanks for sharing.

Made first time as directed and it was wonderful! The sauce is to die for. The second time I upped the bread to 5 cups as other reviews advised and added raisins and cinnamon. Mmmmmmm

I used 4 cups of day old white bread instead of 3 (as suggested by others, I didn't want it to turn out too soupy) I also added cinnamon and nutmeg (I didn't measure, just generously shaked both into the bowl)I put the batter in a well-buttered 8x8 glass dish and baked at about 325 for a little over an hour w/out the bath method. This came out fantastic! It's the first time I have ever made bread pudding, my guests at Thanksgiving raved over this. Next time I will definitley make sure to have some french vanilla ice cream on hand to pair with this. A+!

What a delicious pudding it turned out to be! I used homemade dense cinnamon raisin bread and one leftover scone (all grain) to come up with 3 cups of bread, and it turned out just perfect to pudding consistency, not runny or too thick. Tried with regular store-bought white bread and it came out runnier, so definitely go with dense bread, it comes out whole lot heartier and has distinctive homemade taste.  For sauce, I ran out of sugar so made with whip cream, caramel sauce and a little bit of rum instead of making sauce, so it was more like pudding Sundae. It was super delicious!

I found this recipe a couple of years ago and made it for thanksgiving. Everyone loved it!! I ended up loosing my copy of the recipe and could not find it anywhere. Until today when I thought I would try one more time and found it on this site(i couldn't remember the site I found it on before) You must try this bread pudding!!!!

VERY TASTEY!! I have tried many different kinds of bread pudding recipes but I could never find just the right one until today. I did tweek it a little for our taste. I added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the bread while it soaked in the milk. Then for the sauce I change it sometimes I will use a tsp of brandy extract or 1 tsp of whiskey or 1 tsp of amaretto. Makes a great change for the sauce. Do not use all of them just one of them.

this bread pudding was very good, although i believe adding a teaspoon of nutmeg makes it absolutely perfect.  it's spiciness is delicious when paired with the vanilla flavours.

I usually like firmer bread pudding, but this is delicious.  My husband and kids flipped over it and the sauce is magnifiant.  I wouldn`t recommend kids making this as you start out with hot milk. Yummy

Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out beautifully, although next time, I'd cook it perhaps 5 minutes longer.  We skipped the water bath. 

We used Texas toast bread, which is twice as thick as regular bread, and that worked really well.

Very yummy. I had to cut the recipe in half because I only had 2 eggs. However, I had 4 whole wheat hot dog buns that needed to be used (this amounted to about 6 cups of bread pieces; I just tore up the bread instead of cubing it). I decided to use all 6 cups even though I was using 1/2 of the other ingredients because other reviewers said the pudding was really soggy. I baked it for 1hr, without the water bath, in a 7x11 dish. I thought it turned out great with just the right amount of custard feel to it. I also added a tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and used mostly brown sugar in the pudding mixture.  The sauce is what really makes it awesome though!

I made this today for my boss and myself, and we both loved it!  I used cinnamon swirled wheat bread and added raisins, so it was just a touch too sweet for us (even me, and I have an incredible sweet tooth!), so next time I will definitely cut down on the sugar a little.  Still, a very delicious, satisfyingly old-fashioned dessert, one that I will be making again and again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I used an 8x11 rectangle dish. I changed the bread to 4 1/2C (yeast dinner rolls)and added 1/2 C of chopped fresh strawberries for a variation.Otherwise I followed the recipe. Perfect. I will make this everytime I want bread pudding.I can't wait to make it for company!

This is the best bread pudding ever.  I meant to add some raisins to it but forgot so I just added them to the sauce...fantastic.  I used Texas toast and it turned out great...The sauce really isn't necessary but it's delicious....if you can handle the calories that is!!

This was superb.  My kids unfortunately don't like bread puddings, but my husband (who doesn't often eat dessert)and I managed to finish it in 3 sittings!  I did change the sauce to make it a little less rich and used a tin of Carnation milk, vanilla essence and 1/2 cup of sugar boiled up.  Really good!

pretty good, though I will make a few adjustments int he future.  the ratio of liquid to bread was too high and it lost most of the texture, it was also a bit too eggy.  I would suggest 4 cups of bread, 4 cups milk and reduce the eggs to 3.  Also a little sweet for my taste in bread pudding, even without the sweet sauce.  I would cut the sugar down a bit.  I also added cinnamon to the mix, which adds a nice spice.

I made just the sauce from this recipe and it was delicious. The sauce wasn't thick enough after cooking it for the original 3 minutes. So, I cooked it about 3 minutes longer than it called for.

Absolutely delicious and satisfying. I thought the original recipe might be a bit bland though. So I added to the bread pudding mixture, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves.

Excellent Bread Pudding recipe! The best use of stale bread yet. The only changes I made 1) added dates 2) used half and half instead of cream. Next time I will try with raisins. Delicious! Thanks.

I was amazed by how delicious this turned out.  My husband who generaly doesn't like sweets very much  said and I quote after I gave him a bite of mine: " I never knew Bread Pudding was this good."  My kids said it was "Yummy".  I added some raisins to it. Thanks you for a great recipe!  I'll be making this again often.

OK this does not in any way shape or form feed more than 6 people. It tastes SO good that if u dont get to eat along with the rest of ur guests, you wont get any at all.  I used plain white bread even though i was tempted to try the french bread but didnt get around to buying it. instead of making it in an 8X8, I made it in a 2 quart corning dish  and the results are still great. made it 3 times in the last 10 days. doubled it for a party and still didnt get leftovers. and that included people who detest bread pudding. did have friend comment that its like caramel pudding with bread in it

What could be more comforting than warm bread pudding?  It's the ultimate comfort food.  I used whole wheat bread, and wound up using about 4 cups worth, but not tightly packed.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and a bit of cinnamon.  This baked up great, but I found the milk/egg mixture was really too much volume for the amt of bread.  Next time (yes there definitely will be) I will use 4 cups packed bread cubes and 3 cups milk/3 eggs instead.  For the sauce, I used evaporated nonfat milk, cooked with brown instead of white sugar, and at the end instead of vanilla added amaretto liquor.  This was fantastic.  And the sauce definitely makes the dessert.

I ended up making my own bread pudding by combining ideas from another recipe with this one. I used Craisins,coconut,almonds and cinnamon and a variety of breads. It turned out very very well....but this sauce...WOW....this is superb!! WE enjoyed it very very much!

Loved this one! The vanilla sauce is delicious. I think it would be god with raisins or even chocolate chips in the pudding. The pudding looked very "wobbly" after an hour but I still took it out and it was cooked just fine.

My husband and daughter both love bread pudding.  I however do not eat it so I have to ask them how good it was.  My daughter said it was the best I've ever made so far.  My hubby loved it!  This was a very, very easy recipe and I will be making it again.  It's great to use up that leftover bread and milk at the end of the week.

I've been using my own recipe for bread pudding for years now, misplaced it and needed another.  I made my pudding from this recipe and I'm glad to say that I lost my old one.  This is an easy, tasty recipe.  I have some preferences with bread pudding, starting with a sweet bread ( Portuguese is best), adding a fruit ( none handy this time) and always using cinn and sugar.  You can't skip the water bath.  That's what makes the "custard" set.  I haven't scalded milk since the 70's and the recipe still works fine.  Enjoy it and Thanks for Sharing Mein

Simple, reliable, tasty. Easy to modify with whatever you'd like (in my case white chocolate and cherries). Great recipe.

This recipe was my first attempt at bread pudding.  It was wonderful! Just like gramma uses to make (except she made a rum sauce). I used left over cinnamon bread I had frozen just to make this. I folowed the recipe exactly as written. I baked it for 1 hour 15 minites as at 60 minutes the bottom was still very custardy. It came out beautiful! Can't wait to make it for the holidays. Thanks!

I bought a chocolate babka at a bake sale last weekend, we were going to bring it for mothers day breakfast but forgot it at home.  I saw it sitting in the fridge and knew it had to be used or thrown away and I immediately thought to make a bread pudding.  This was the first time I've made one and we sure were not disappointed.  This was super easy to put together, I ended up having enough to fill a 9x13 Pyrex dish so I baked it in a water bath in my sheet cake pan.  I have to admit in was a little worried about the sauce with the cup of sugar, butter and cream but it really topped off the bread pudding perfectly.  Delicious!

I have made bread pudding my whole life, trying all sorts of recipes and it was always hit or miss, too soupy or too dry.  This recipe is beyond simple and the best I have ever eaten.  A true delight.  Custardly, fragrant, can't wait to dig in.  Absolutely the best.

Easy and delicious!  I added a half teaspoon of almond to both the pudding and the sauce.  Mouth watering.  I also found that the water pan was unnecessary, you just get a touch of browning on the edges which I like for the texture anyway.

This is the best bread pudding I've ever tasted. I even used a very stale baguette and it still turned out fantastic. It is a bit sweet so the next time I make it I will probably cut back on the sugar that I put in with the bread because the sauce is soooo sweet but sooooooo delicious! Will make it again soon. Must try this one!

Swallow your tongue good even for those of us who don't like bread pudding! I must admit I made a couple minor changes, but no way are they what made this pudding delicious! Thank you so much for sharing!
For any one interested in what changes I made, I added more spices (nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon) and baked in the oven for 325 for 40 minutes instead of the water method. I also only had half and half instead of cream and used maple extract instead of vanilla extract, as I had no vanilla on hand.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight. I made with my homemade bread that my gave me the starter for recently. It's homemade sour dough bread that has been in our family for 30 years.
I made the recipe exactly as instructed except I added cinnamon to the bread mixture before cooking.
OMG! This recipe was fantastic. Soft with w crispy top, buttery, melts in your mouth like a custard. Exactly what I was looking for. Holy Yum!!! Will make it again with my homemade bread. Oh so good!!!

This was great!  I was looking for a recipe that was more of a custard consistency as I don't like dry crusty bread pudding.  This is it!  Super easy and really moist.  I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer than suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

This is the most delicious bread pudding I've ever tasted. My husband couldn't get enough of it and keeps bugging me to make more. I added all of the sauce into it when it was finished rather than keeping it seperate, and it was still great. Everyone who tasted it loved it and I've had a lot of requests for the recipe.

Been searching for bread pudding with a sauce that tastes like this!  Like the revision of 5 c french bread, 1/2 brown and white sugar, and using cream and milk.  Fed it to my extended family and it has become the new family favorite!  Thank you all for sharing!

This recipe did not work for me at all. There was too little bread, too much egg and in the glazing there was WAY too much sugar. I would increase the bread and decrease the eggs and sugar amounts.  On a texture level it felt more like creme brulee, instead of bread pudding...

This is very good! I added 3 more cups of bread, used half and half instead of heavy cream, and used less than a half cup of sugar for the sauce.

THIS RECIPE MADE ME SICK!...Only because I ATE ALMOST THE ENTIRE PAN MYSELF!!!  This is one of those warm, comforting, delicious desserts that makes you feel oh so good when it seems like the world is against you!  I used about 3/4 of a loaf of day old french bread and added raisins.  You could almost drink the sauce because it is so yummy.  I also cooked it for about an hour and a half to ensure it wouldn't be too mushy.  Thank You Missy!

This one just isn't a thrill.  It's sort of an egg custard with bread, and not a whole lot of snap.  If you're looking for a basic recipe, this may be it.  But plan on a disappointment if you're wanting a lot of flavor. And while the sauce is nice, I suggest you use half white and half brown sugar, and add some bourbon or brandy, as it needs some flavor, too! Personally, I'll be searching for another recipe, one with more of a wow-effect. If you choose to make this anyway, DON"T judge it immediately after it comes from the oven.  Allow it to cool and "set up," or it will be too wet, like some other reviewers must have discovered.  Egg custard directly from the oven needs time to cool, and so does this.

this was my first time trying to make bread pudding. i was looking for a recipe like my bf's grandmother makes and although this isn't it exactly its pretty close. i heard that you should use stale bread but i got over excited and i used a new loaf of orowheat cinammon raisin bread so decided to let the bread soak a little longer than 5 min. i think i'll add more raisins next time (so yes i'll be making it again). my mom said that she liked it when it was more bready (but that didn't stop her from eating it!) my sister loved it and she doesn't like bread pudding she even asked me for the recipe. now the sauce....my sister came home from work one day and went straight to the fridge looking for the left over sauce so she could have it with berries, said she'd been dreaming about it all day the next day she tried to do the same thing but was devastated to find that the sauce was all gone. oh yeah, i served the sauce on the side and cut 1/4 c sugar out.

Even though I baked it quite a bit longer than 60 minutes, it was really soft.  I will be looking for a recipe with less milk or more bread.  Was really custard-like.  I added fresh raspberries, and that was good.  As others mentioned, the sauce is great.

This recipe was very tasty, but mine came out a little soggy in the middle. I cooked it for an hour and then stuck a knife in the center and it came out clean. But it still seemed eggy. I live in Colorado maybe it needed to be cooked longer due to the altitude?

I have made this every year since I found it and it is absolutely the BEST recipe there is!  I found that I like to cook mine longer than an hour until the top is nice and golden and then I know it's done.  I use French Bread every time - and every time the texture is such a heavenly custard!  The sauce is to die for - and makes the bread pudding even more heavenly.  This is something I will be making for years to come!

Great recipe.  Sauce was fantastic!!!  I used cinnamon/raisin bread and it was perfect.  The sauce makes this without a doubt.  Smells great,  and fills the house with the awesome aroma of sweet bread and cinnamon.

the pudding was very soggy. i think it calls for to much milk compared to bread. it also needs cinnamin in it. the sauce however is to die for. i had 2 tablespoons of rum to the sauce and everbody raved about it. i used a different bread pudding though.{sorry}

I used this "basic" bread pudding recipe, however, intsead of regular bread, I used Panatone (italian, sweet dessert bread).  I loved it, so did my husband.  Was moist and delicious.

For years i have searched for a delicious bread pudding recipe and I finally found it with this! And the sauce is equally as excellent! I made it for my extended family for desert and my hard-to-please uncle said it was "decadent!" Everyone came back for 3rd and 4th helpings. My aunt began calling it "crack pudding" because it was addicting to the palette. Easy to make as well. 2 adjustments I did was, I did not line the baking pan with a towel and at the and of baking, I upped the temp to 375 for the last 15 minutes. I'm adding this to my recipe box. I suggest you make a double batch, 1 will not be enough when people try it!

Great recipe!  My husband and friends loved it.  I made only a few changes.  I added cinnamon and raisins to the pudding.  I also added a dollop of sherry to the sauce.

I changed it a bit.  I used:

2 cups bread cubes
2.5 cups vanilla soy milk
1/2 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 tbsp butter
1/2 tsp cinnamon
dash of salt
a few drops of vanilla

All the directions remain the same except I baked at 290 degrees and I didn't make the sauce.

LOVE THIS!!!  This is the recipe that my favorite tea room serves.  I added one thing, as the bread is soaking up milk, and just aobut done, I sprinkled cinnamon on the bread.  It stuck nicely and really added some zip.  You will be addicted too and never want for another bread pudding recipe again.

I followed this recipe pretty much to the tee, except, I did not make the sauce and I used half white/brown sugar and added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.  I made it in the 8x8 pan in the water bath.  It turned out very very watery.  I almost threw it out. I salvaged most of it by removing some of the pudding from the dish and 'draining' the water by spooning it out by hand.  It tasted fine, except I did have some bites that were very eggy.  I was looking for a custard type bread pudding, like a decadent one I had in a restraunt. This would have been close had it not been for the eggy tastes and the watery consistency.  The taste was good, we still ate it.  But I will probably be trying other recipes until I get find the perfect one.  Sorry.

This recipe is fabulous! I doubled it and used a 9x13 pan. I did need to cook it about 15 minutes longer. I used a cinnamon type bread, which gave it a lot of flavor. This recipe is going to be my "go to" recipe for bread pudding.

This is the only Bread Pudding recipe I'll ever make.  I always double the ingredients and make in a 9x13 glass pan.  And I only use day old French Bread.  Thank you for years of Bread Pudding JOY!  : )

This is a good bread pudding, but I chose to add/change some ingredients and "tweaked" it until I liked the end result.  I used 4 cups of cubed Jamaican Hard Dough Bread, a bread that is very dense and doesn't become soggy easily.  I only used 3 eggs, instead of 4, and I added 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. cinnamon, as well as 1 tsp. rum extract (in addition to the 1 tsp. vanilla.)  I baked it in the water bath exactly as instructed, but the pudding was still very mushy at 60 minutes.  I took it out of the water bath and baked it in a dry oven for 15 more minutes.  The next time I use this recipe, I am going to bake it in a dry oven with no water bath.  As for the sauce, I used 3/4 cup half and half and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. rum extract (in addition to the vanilla.)  I also added 1 tsp. flour to the sugar before blending it in the hot milk and melted butter.  The flour gave the sauce more "body" and it wasn't so runny.  I will definitely make this recipe again, but will bake it in a dry oven and will use my variations.  Thanks, MIEN, for a good basic recipe.

First time was a success. It lasted 1.5 days. I added more bread initially and probably will this time also. Definitely going to reduce milk by 1/2 cup and omit water all together and just reduce baking temperature. I was impressed with it over all.

Awesome and yummy!

There was a lot of sauce... so I recommend serving the sauce after each piece has been placed on a plate so that each individual can decide how much they want. (If you are eating it right away, which really is when it tastes the best).
I added more vanilla.

I will definitely make this again!

This is good bread pudding, if you like it soft and custardy.  I found it tasted better after it sat and cooled down to room temp.  The sauce was too sweet for us, but it wouldn't be nearly as good a recipe without the sauce.  Next time I'll just adjust the sugar somewhat.  I also found I had to increase the bread somewhat.  I added a handful of raisins to the pudding too.  It was yummy, just not perfect.

This was great. I especially loved the sauce. I used about 5 cups of bread b/c I didn't want mine too soupy. I also cute back on the sugar.  Still was sweet enough. Always a hit when I make it!!!!

This was wonderful bread pudding. I used leftover crossants for my bread.  I filled the 8x8 pan to the top with broken up crossants, then dumped the bread out of the pan into the hot milk. I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and some raisins. The vanilla sauce was awesome but we added vanilla carmel swirl icecream on top of that...No calories here!  Everyone loved it. Even the 2yr.old was saying ummm!

The pudding was alright, very watery at the bottom, even though I cooked it for ten minutes past the time stated. Next time I will scale down the liquid a bit. The sauce however, was WONDERFUL!!!! :)

I probably did something wrong. The whole thing with putting it in another pan or whatever was too much. I had to manipulate it to make it decent. The top was done but underneath it was really runny. Maybe next time.

Great Recipe!  I love bread pudding, but I had never made it until now.  I used a package of unseasoned croutons instead of bread and it turned out really well.  I also added a 1/2 cup of raisins and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  This one is a keeper!

I've been wanting to make bread pudding for some time - thanks to this recipe my first attempt was a success!  I thought the sauce was too rich/sweet and next time I will use lightly sweetened whippped cream instead.  Also, it was a little mushy even though I used more bread than it called for, so I'll use even more next time.  I used cinammon raison brioche bread.

The bread pudding was soggy with a watery-butter pool in the bottom.

Our whole family loves this recipe.  We do add raisins and go a bit lighter on the sauce, but that's just tinkering with near perfection.  We have made it many times with consistent results.

This is by far the best bread pudding I have ever had. It's perfectly sweetened (the sauce is incredible) and moist!  Even my husband loved it who doesn't like anything that's not chocolate chip cookies:)

YUMMY!!!  I love bread pudding, but sometimes it can be too dry.  This recipe was excellent.  It was the best I've had.  Definitely give it a try.

This is an excellent recipe.  While the preparation was not the easiest, the directions were straightforward.  I would not recommend that a child make this without help from an adult.

I added about a cup of slivered almonds for texture and to cut through the sweetness, I also added a tsp of ground cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of ground nutmeg. With all of these changes, it's a five-star recipe in my book.
tip: evaporated milk instead of the cream works equally well, with half the calories

This bread pudding is delicious! I've made it several times and even won a dessert contest with it. Over time Ive changed a few things. Instead of just plain milk: use equal parts of evaporated milk, non-fat milk, and whipping cream. I also pack butter and brown sugar into a few crevices once the bread pudding is assembled. Also, I add a bit more vanilla and nutmeg to the recipe than what it calls for.

Better than my Mom's family recipe. I add lots of Golden Raisins. Best eaten right out of the oven, warm. It loses something the next day. Love it with a little half n half drizzled over it.

First time making bread pudding and this recipe was a home run. I added pineapple (drained & crushed), a bit of cinnamon, and sprinkled a little brown sugar on top and it came out perfect. The sauce put it over the top!

This is extremely close to my favorite bread pudding recipe from a 1960's-era Better Homes and Gardens cookbook.  (I use 4 cups dry bread cubes, rather than the 2 cups called for in the cookbook.)  But my favorite part was the lemon sauce in that recipe. I also sprinkle nutmeg on the bread pudding before baking.

This is the best bread pudding I've ever had!  It had a smoother custard-like consistency rather than a dense squishy bread.  If you have someone in your family that hates bread pudding (e.g. my husband), he probably still won't like this.  But my son liked this one and no other.  I used "day old" crusty bakery bread.
I did make one change: Instead of 4 whole eggs, I used 2 whole + 2 yolks.  The egg whites are what give bread puddings an "eggy" flavor.  I save the whites for meringue or omelets.
Thanks for the recipe!

It's pretty good but my pudding fell.  Probably because I opted not to use the waterbath.

The pudding was great, exactly as I had hoped it would turn out, I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than suggested in my oven.  The sauce that goes with it was not what i was looking for, I wanted a thicker sauce and did not like the over abundent amount and thinness of this sauce but it did taste good.

I found this bread pudding tasteless.I added cinammon to the milk. because it had no flavor at all.I used margarine instead of butter and omitted the salt.Used pure vanilla for the sauce, but it was runny so I added some cornstarch.I had made bread pudding before, and taste much better than this one.I will definetely stick to my own recipe.

The sauce was really good.  Would not change anything in the sauce.  The bread pudding was really soggy.  I even baked it an additional hour without the water bath & it made no difference.  I would try this recipe again with less milk & more bread.  I also added 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg & 1/2 cup raisins.

It's hard to review a recipe that you ended up changing alot. I can't tell you if the original recipe is 5 star, but the result I ended up with was really good! I had leftover scones I needed to use up and used those in place of the bread cubes. I used half white, half brown sugar and added cinnamon and nutmeg. The result was unlike anything I've had before! It was "custardy" but the scones gave it a shortcake-type texture. I served it with the yummy sauce and fresh strawberries!

For me, this recipe also has too much custard to bread ratio.  I added more bread and also some cinnamon.  Love the sauce!  Brown sugar instead of white for the sauce makes a wonderful dark, rich caramel.

This was my first bread pudding and it was yummy.  I can't speak for other bread puddings but this one was very custardy. I think that the base without the bread would be good on its own or with the addition of coconut.  It was good both warm and cold but I prefer it cold while I think my DH prefers warm. I did make the sauce; I added a couple of spoonfuls over the top and then drizzled a spoon on each serving. IMO you don’t need the sauce, it makes it a bit too sweet for me.

I used cinnamon bread and it turned out very sweet.  I didn't make the sauce because the kids loved it as is.  Next time I will make the sauce, just to try it.  I used 2 tsp of vanilla and lots of pum pkin pie spice.  Delicous!

This was the first time I have ever made bread pudding, but I've always enjoyed it.  This was a great basic recipe.  I used a cinnimon apple raisin bread so I cut back on the sugar a bit I also added some extra cinnamon and rasins.  I served with an apricot sauce and fresh whipped cream...Delicious!  Next time, and there will be a next time! I am going to try the sauce because that sunds really yummy too!!

Took it to a potluck.  People thought it was 'nice' but no one thought it was special.  I thought it was just ok as well.  MAY make it again if I feel a craving for bread and butter pudding.

I hadn't eaten bread pudding for years, and this was a fantastic re-introduction!  I didn't make the sauce - just poured a bit of double cream over to serve.  I also used demerara sugar instead of white sugar in the pudding, and added cinnamon and nutmeg before putting it in the oven.  Very tasty, gorgeous creamy texture - I loved this and it's on my comfort foods list!

This dessert is delicious but VERY sweet.  Next time I make it I will cut back on the sugar in both the pudding recipe and the sauce.  This time I added lemon juice to the sauce and it helped, but I think it was still too sweet for my taste.  I also added raisins and next time I think I will add nuts as well.

Awesome recipe. I used a loaf of sliced french bread and quartered the slices. I added about 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the actual pudding. For the sauce, I added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg & almond extract. I got RAVE reviews from those who ate it fresh and warm, and it is just as good as a microwaved leftover.

This recipe got rave reviews!  I did add about 1 TBSP of cinnamon to the egg mixture as my family loves it that way.  Also, next time I will try powdered sugar to make the sauce.  Mine is always just a little grainy.

This is good.  I think something was missing though.  I used Safeway bakery old-fashioned dinner rolls and they were good.  I think cinnamon and raisins would be good.  With the sauce I cut the sugar back to a half cup and it was plenty sweet. I cannot imagine a whole cup of sugar in that sauce.  I also had to cook it longer- an hour and 15 or so.  It would be better in a larger pan.  I used an 8x8 and it was a bit mushy on the bottom, even after letting it set-up for hours.  The next day we ate it without the sauce- it was boring.

I made this recipe when we had some family friends over for dinner, and my guest stated that this bread pudding is better than her grandmother's!  Needless to say, I scored a home run with dessert.

This recipe was remarkable. My guest said that it was the best bread pudding they had ever eaten. I made it exactly as written. I would not change anything with the basic recipe. Next time I may add golden raisins only because I like them in bread pudding. Thanks so much for this recipe

This was very good, although my kids didn't particularly care for it. I happen to love bread pudding.  I made it with left over Hawaiian bread and some country white bread I had made that week. I thought it was excellent.

This is the best and easiet bread pudding recipe that I've found!!!  It is so yummy.  I used all of the crusts that I cut off of my kids sandwiches and toast (before they eat it).  They just end up in the garbage anyway!!  It was great made out of crusts and you couldn't tell that that is what I used.

This was wonderful.  I used thick, sweet french toast bread, topped with a little nutmeg, and added a little dry sherry in the vanilla sauce. I will make this again and again. Thanks!

This was the first time I made bread pudding and it turned out delicious. I did however make a few changes- I substituted stevia for the sugar and used 1% milk. When I make it next time I have leeway (with confidence) to get more adventurous with ingredients. All Recipes never lets me down.Phenomenal tasting!

I added cinnamon and raisins.  The baking technique really paid off and I used the food processor on the bread to make crumbs rather than large pieces.  Excellent.

This might have been good if I changed the recipe completely, but I made it as directed. It was a sloppy, soupy, soggy mess.  I added 10 minutes to the cooking time even. Everyone agreed that it might have been slightly less soupy if I hadn't used the water bath. It just didn't set that way. Too much milk and too many eggs added to the disaster. This recipe went against my better judgement, but I tried it because I liked the idea of the vanilla sauce. Even that was way too sweet and buttery. I'm filling this recipe under "never make again".

I used french toast bread by pepperidge farm and 1/3 cup each white and brown sugars. I did the same amounts pf each sugar for the topping. I was afraid it might be too sweet. I will update the results when done but it smells so good i'm sure it is 5 star  :)

Fantastic. I hate it when people do this, but for full disclosure, I added a little extra bread because I was trying to use it up and also added some cinnamon.  It was wonderful!

1st time making bread pudding and it came out so good! I followed what other reviewers had tips on. Used 5 cups of french bread, half white and half brown sugar, with some cinnamon, half milk half cream, cut one egg out, and voíla! I melted the butter with the milk and cream while it was stovetop. Mixed the rest of the ingredients after the milk cream mix was boiled and off heat, then soaked the bread in there after. Used an 8 × 13 just to make sure it didn't overflow when I poured, and with baking, and sprinkled half with chocolate chips. With how much liquid there were, I could've used more bread. Maybe cut them bigger, but it came out very good!

I made it. I ate it. I enjoyed it. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg with extra bread. It is very soupy/soft. The next time I make and I will make it again I will use less moisture. Very good.

I followed the recipe exactly. This recipe definitely need more bread. Even so it was delicious if a little runny. I will make it again with more bread.

I have made this Bread Pudding 3 times. The first time was just like the recipe reads. It was very good. The second time was with Home made cinnamon rolls. It was very-very good. Yesterday was the third time I have made this bread pudding, and I use Raspberry sweet rolls that were leftover from Saturday morning,and I used a chocolate sauce on it. And it was the best shofar.  Yes!! I am planning to make again and again..

Followed recipe.  Too much like sweet scrambled eggs with bread.  After sitting in fridge sauce separated into a hard sheet and a watery mess.

I did part regular bread cubes (dried) with equal parts vanilla brioche. I'm sure any brioche would work. I did not dry the brioche but probably would be better if had did so.

A big hit with my husband. I added cinnamon and raisins to the pudding. Loved the sauce! Served it hot. The flavors seemed to heighten the next day and it was easy to warm up the sauce in the microwave.  Found it very tricky to navigate the boiling water bath in a lower oven! Be careful!! I finally just took out the baking dish, carefully slid in the roasting pan with the boiling water, and then set the baking dish back into the bath.  I also reversed this process at the end of the baking time.  A little bit safer.

I would do 4.5 stars. but I will round up and do 5. It was good, a tad sweet, but I still might make again. I had extra syrup that I will use for something else.

Good right away but  next day has "weeped".  Bread went to top leaving a custardy filling below.  Sweetness was about right.  Next time I'd add the raisins & some cinnamon, and flavor the sauce with an extract (lemon, rum).  I think I followed the directions, however it was the half-size recipe.

It's kinda gross as is. I just made this and changed one small thing, otherwise EVERYTHING else was exactly the same. . I don't have an 8x8 dish, so I used my 8.5x11 and added two more cups of bread. It's still soupy as all get out! I may try it again with some of the changes suggested. If that doesn't work, I'm trying another recipe. And for the record I try all recipes as is the very first time, then I may tweak it or not. Sorry I couldn't be of much positive help.

I made this for a dinner tonight - but didn't get to taste it.  From the comments, I'd have to say it rates 5 stars. 
Everyone was asking who made the bread pudding.  Comments: " Bread pudding is my favorite dessert and this is the best I've ever had!"   "Quit your day job and you can make a living with this."   And the best - "who made the bread pudding?  Will you marry me?"
I doubled the recipe, used more bread than the recipe calls for and only 6 eggs (rather than 8 if doubled)  I also added cinnamon.
I added raisin, the butter and vanilla to the scalded milk before pouring over the bread.

I used this recipe as my foundation, went heavy on vanilla and bread, skipped the water bath, and reduced the oven to 250. It turned out great! It was at its best after it had cooled for a day in the fridge. I'll definitely be using this again with some added twists and ingredients.

Used some sour dough bread I had left over.  I altered my method a little tempering the eggs and adding the eggs, vanilla and sugar before soaking the bread in the mixture.  It needed more than an hour to bake but turned out great.  I normally add some raisins to mine but didn't have any and decided to add some coconut instead, work out great.

I made this today exactly as written except I added a couple extra slices of bread. Even with the extra bread I ended up with a pan of mostly mush. I don't say this often but find a different recipe. I even baked it for about an extra half hour and it didn't help. Won't make again!!

This is a well-loved favorite for the holidays.  I use Challah bread, and I would imagine that Portuguese sweet bread would work as well.  Depending on what folks like, I suggest Golden Raisins ( the purple are too overpowering) and some walnut pieces to add to the complexity of flavors.  For the sauce, I replace half of the vanilla with rum.  This is a great basic recipe with which to work magic.

I used The breadcrumbs from my accidental Woopsie when making French toast and I burnt the bread. I simply cut up the pieces and put them on a baking rack for about 30 minutes at 3:25. made perfectly already seasoned breadcrumbs ready to go!

I had baked a new recipe of Banana Nut Bread that turned out dry.  My husband suggested I make Bread Pudding with it so it didn't go to waste. It was a great idea! I used the Banana Nut Bread instead of the bread with all other ingredients the same. It was delicious!

We tried this recipe on new years day and enjoyed it a lot!  For the bread, we used a panettone that someone had given us for Christmas, and it was perfect because it already had the raisins and other dried fruits in it.  We sliced the bread instead of cubing it and layered it in an 8 x 13 glass baking dish.  Because the bread was already quite sweet, we only 4 tbsp of sugar.  I followed other reviewers advice and also used less eggs (3 instead of 4).  It was a perfect new years day treat!

I looked at a number of recipes and did not read any of the reviews! The bread pudding itself was out of this world. Delicious, yummy and delectable. How many ways can one say "yummy"? I made the pudding according to the recipe. What brought me to even consider making bread pudding, a usual scourge of foodies as am I, was that I had a bunch of French bread in my freezer a bit longer than usual and I just thought that a bread pudding would be a way to salvage it. Well, the pudding was perfect. For my "sauce," I just followed a whipped cream recipe and lightly whipped the cream so that I could pour it on the hot bread pudding. It was, indeed, to die for. My dear friend also loves it and it was her first time ever having bread pudding. Oh, I also live in Viet Nam!

Mine looked great just like the one in the picture, but the bottom was basically saccharine scrambled egg mush, which was pretty gross. I salvaged the top which wasn't too bad, but this recipe needs some pretty heavy modification if it's going to turn out right. Less eggs, more bread.

I didn't have enough milk and tried a crazy mixture....I had powdered coffee mate (vanilla caramel) and mixed it with water. This with the two cups of milk I had turned out great! Since it was already flavored, I didn't use any additional spices.

Luvgod is wrong. This is absolutely THE best bread pudding recipe I've ever made or had.  the only change I made was I added a dash of Nutmeg.  I didn't make the sauce.  I got lazy and pulled some caramel ice cream topping out of my frig and added Capt Morgan rum.  heated it a bit and mixed the rum with a whisk.  YUMMMMM.

This is a great recipe.  I will add maybe some cinnamon and some nutmeg to the next try, but this is an excellent basic recipe!!  I have experimented with a little less sugar in the pudding itself and it worked really well.  Give it a try!

I tried this twice and it didn't turn out.  I cooked it longer as suggested, added more bread the second time with additional cooking time again.  Didn't help.  What could I have done wrong?  I really want to make this dessert for my boyfriend as it is his favorite.

This was awesome! The best bread pudding recipe I've tried. I will definitely be making this again. I followed the recipe exactly except for the following. I used 1/2c sugar plus 1/4c spoonable Splenda. I added 1T cinnamon and substituted 1/2c heavy cream for 1/2c of the milk. I also used the larger 8x11 pan, which was a good fit. Mine was almost too sweet while still warm but was perfect chilled. Both taste and texture were fabulous, so much so that I didn't even bother with the sauce - maybe next time. Unlike most that I've tried this one did not have any visible bread chunks, was like pudding or custard. Loved it!

This was amazing (with a few tweeks).  So, I have always loved bread pudding but never had made it.  I used the following alterations to the recipe...
I used about 5 cups of bread cubes (challah works really well for this and french toast), two extra egg yolks and an 8x11 inch pan.  Then for the sauce I used about a cup of cream and added nutmeg and cinnamon.  Everyone complimented me on it!

Wonderful recipe for this delicious comfort food.  This is a family favorite.  I add a dash of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and some yellow raisins (the purple ones have an overpowering taste).  I put 1/2 tsp of rum in the sauce for a slightly more complex taste.  This is going to be a holiday staple for years to come.

Delicious recipe - how many things can you make in TEN minutes that taste this good?  I enjoyed the texture (although I had hoped it would be as eggy as the picture indicated, which it was not!  Alas).  
This is definitely a dessert's dessert--very sweet, especially once drenched in the syrup.  As previous reviews suggested, I cut down on the sugar to make it more snack-like and less cakey-sweet.

Wow! This is makes a really great bread pudding. I had  a fully packed gallon ziplock bags of regular sliced white bread crusts left over from tea sandwiches I had made for a party I didn't know what to do with, equal to about 6 & 1/2 cups..and yes, even sandwich bread works great here in my opinion. You just need more bread in ratio to the milk.
Then modified the recipe based on what I had on hand...
 1 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown (per suggestionof other reviewers)
3 c milk, 2 c light cream
2 eggs ( no eggy taste at all)
3 T cinnamon and 1 tsp each of cloves, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg
Popped it in the oven for an hour at 325 degrees in regular stoneware pan...no water bath...and moist and baked all the way through.
This comes out dense, but very moist and full off flavor. My husband loved this recipe and can't seem to get enough and have given some to friends who raved to.
Thanks for this great recipe! It's very versatile, which makes it easy to  use whatever you have and still succeed in making a yummy dessert!

This bread pudding is yummy!  I made it with half chocolate bread and half french bread.  The chocolate bread is sweet enough that you don't need the sauce- unless you are a sugar fiend!  It's really custardy and creamy.  I will make it again for sure.

I was so disappointed that this recipe turned out poorly.  I doubled the recipe to serve a larger group.  My only recipe adjustments were to add two extra cups of bread cubes as others had recommended (8 instead of 6 for the doubled recipe), toss the bread cubes with 2 tsp of cinnamon and increase the baking time by 15 minutes since I was using a 9 x 13 glass dish.  It was beautifully golden brown on the top but the custardy bottom was steamed mush at best.  Even after baking it another 25 minutes without the water bath, the custard still did not set up well and smelled way too eggy for anyone here to try it again.  I am used to a more traditional less eggy-custard bread pudding I suppose.  I should have known better because a ratio of 3 cups of bread cubes (dry) to 4 cups of milk and 4 eggs (wet) would produce a very "wet" bread pudding.

This was delicious.  I followed other reviewers and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and only 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  (nutmeg has such a strong flavor), I didn't want it to be overpowering, and I'm glad that I only added the 1/2 tsp.  Came out very well.  I also increased the amount of bread from 3 cups to 4 cups as suggested by other reviewers.  I did do the water bath.  First time at making bread pudding, I wish I had made this long ago.  Thanks Mien for the recipe.  It was very delicious.  The additional spices really called for raisins to be added.  I might try that next time.

I followed other readers advice and put in 4 C of bread cubes (calabrese) instead of 3, and I'm happy with it! I also left the crust on, and I really liked that contrast in the texture... if I hadn't, I think it would have been TOO pudding-y for me. I left it in the oven for about 10 extra minutes, sprinkled raisins on top of half, and I also sprinkled cinnamon on top as well.   The cream for the topping is to DIE for - I would've probably given the cake a 4 without it... my mom (who wasn't sure about the soaking the bread without the sugar in the milk) was a big fan too! Definitely a keeper.

I made this for my mom and she loved it.  I choose it because there is no cinamon or nutmeg in it.  It is sweet and creamy.  You can compare it to a baked french toast.  Next time I might try putting some type of fruit in it.  I will make this again.

I really liked the sauce... but the texture of the bread pudding threw me off.  I liked the flavor, but my grandma's bread pudding was what I was expecting and the "custard" layer on the bottom of this was strange.  I might make it again someday, not sure at this point though!

Delicious! We loved the pudding. The sauce was VERY sweet.  I did add nutmeg, and that helped, but next time, I will just double every ingredient except sugar, so I get more sauce, but less sweet.  I ended up with to much pudding mix to fit in an 8x8 pan- the rest fit  easily into a loaf pan. The water bath method worked really well, and gave the pudding a lovely custard consistency.

I have never eaten Bread Pudding before, so really, I have no idea on what qualifies as a "good" bread pudding and a "bad" one.  All I know is that this was pretty tasty and the sauce is delectably delicious! (Then again, ANYTHING with cream, butter, and sugar should be . . .)  Still as wonderful as it was, it only rates 4 stars since I had to go through 4 batches to make it the way my family wanted it.  I live in a high altitude, so I had to add 12 cups(!) of bread to get it so it wasn't a big eggy mess.  I measured in weight, which I think would help many of you get it to the right consistency.  My family likes theirs with more bread and I only had to bake it 20 minutes longer at 325 degrees (instead of 350 so it wouldn't burn.)  Like I said, the sauce makes the dessert.  My family LOVED it after the modification.

I have been searching forever for a bread pudding recipe that is light and custardy and this was it.  It is so delicious as is that I didn't use the sauce but I'm sure that's good too.  Thanks, Missi, you made me and my husband very happy.

I added soaked raisins, nutmeg and cinnamon to the pudding, and brandy extract to the sauce. I used about 3/4 loaf of fresh french bread and split the pudding into two smaller dishes, and it was perfect- not soggy at all, just soft. The end product was DELICIOUS, warm and comforting. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this with Grandma VanDoren's White Bread from this site (fresh, not stale) and used whipping cream in place of heavy.  It is heavenly - but there seems to be a lot of sauce?  We only needed about half the sauce.  Also, to those who complained of this being too moist or soggy on the bottom - it's pudding!  Don't expect it to be like bread.  It was absolutely perfect when baked about 50 minutes.

This has been the best bread pudding, I have ever made and I have tried several.  I agree the sauce makes it.

Like others, I was looking for a good frosting and this was it! I think you could use this frosting for many things, french toast comes to mind... it is endless! Thanks for sharing!

I chose not to use this recipe because I did not have a roasting pan. I chose another bread pudding recipe, but used the toppings from this one. It turned out very good! The topping is very sweet (which I love!), and could probably be scaled down abit because I had way too much left over.

So far, I have only made the sauce for a different bread pudding (I don't have a roasting pan so I decided to skip this one). I used plain 2% yogurt instead of cream, since that's what I had and it turned out wonderfully.
