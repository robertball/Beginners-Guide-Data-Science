As another reveiwer suggested, I used 2 whole eggs instead of the egg substitute and left out the heavy cream altogether. This was a very good pumpkin pie. A bit different in consistency than my normal recipe, but still good. The people I served it to enjoyed it and only my mother knew it was not my normal recipe! I made 4 of these for Thanksgiving for my diabetic friends so they were sure to have a dessert that day! BUT DO NOT FREEZE!!!  It retains the water from freezing and is absolutely horrible!

Great pumpkin pie! I used non-dairy fat free half and half and 2 eggs, no heavy cream. Tasted like the real thing! My family couldn't tell the difference, although it was a little sweeter. Great consistency and I will make it again! YUM!

Tasted like pumpkin pie, but the texture was a little off.  Needed to be a little firmer.
