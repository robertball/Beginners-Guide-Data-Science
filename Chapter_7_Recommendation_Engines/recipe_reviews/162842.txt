I feel like odd man out here, but at least it's in a positive way - I liked these.  Keep in mind tho, I did not follow the recipe.  I just made my usual margarita (2 parts margarita mix + 1` part tequila = total 8 oz), added ice, and a half of an avacado (didn't want a whole avacado to go to waste if I didn't like it).  If you're looking for a spin on a margarita, this isn't it, this comes out thick and creamy like a smoothie - an Avacado Smoothie.  I usually salt the rim for a margarita, but I don't think salt would go with this.  Hubby doesn't care for avacadoes, can't get past the *green*, so he didn't like it, but if you love avacados like I do, you just might like this.

This was definitely the most interesting margarita that I've ever tried. I'd have given it a 1 star, but figured it deserved 2 just for creativity. Most of it was forced down or dumped in the sink.

I tried, I really tried to like this, but I just couldn't.  However, a few of the people I served it to did like it, but said it was a one time thing.

Excellent recipe! It was smooth, rich and creamy. I suggest using premium tequila.  I used both and could definitely taste the difference!

I give this a 4 star for creativity, texture, and color. I loved the creaminess and smoothness the avocado gave this. It is not your traditional margarita and one you definitely need a straw to drink it with. It was more like a boozy smoothie. The cilantro was a nice touch too. The one think I did not like is that I felt it needed a little sweetness added. Maybe a little honey? This was fun and made "happy hour" feel a little more healthy.
