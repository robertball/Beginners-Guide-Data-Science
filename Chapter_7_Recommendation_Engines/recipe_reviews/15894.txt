I remember helping my mother make this when I was a kid.  I loved it then and really enjoyed it now.  I didn't have a recipe for it, so thank you for sharing!

I also remember my grandmother making Capirotoda for Easter.  Lent, mainly on Fridays.  I loved it at a small age and I will love it for the rest of my life.  I wish I could cook it like grandma though.  This has been around our family ever since I can remember.  Gotta love those Family traditions.

First time ever making Capirotada and it came out pretty good. I used piloncillo, (Mexican brown sugar) for a more authentic taste.  I poured the syrup over the bread and let it sit for a few minutes. I used Oaxaca Cheese which is very similar to Mozzarella and I omitted the anise candies since I don't care for them. Next time I think I  will try it with sharp cheddar. Good recipe, thanks.

Very easy and yummy! I did make some adjustments after making it one time. I felt it was a little too dry for my liking, so I almost used 2 1/2 cups brown sugar & 2 1/2 cups water. It made it more of a bread “pudding” texture, a lot more moist. I didn’t have French bread so I used sliced white bread and it worked out fine. I also used crushed almonds for the nuts. My husband loved this recipe and I will definitely make it again!
