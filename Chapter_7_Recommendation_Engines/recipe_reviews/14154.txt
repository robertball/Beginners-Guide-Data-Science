I had ladies from Relief Society and served a salad bar/dessert menu. This salad was on it, mostly because it elminates the need for several different bottles of dressing. There's some magic that goes on between the frozen peas and the other veggies because you've never had a salad come out so crisp. For extra color and flavor I add a shredded carrot layer, a sliced radish layer, and as always, a chopped celery layer. Once in a while I also add sliced water chestnuts.I used light mayo and added about 1/4 of an envelope of Ranch mix to the dressing. I believe it works out better to put the egg and bacon on top of the dressing rather than under. Also I used half the cheese and that seemed like plenty.

I served this at one of my barbecues and everyone loved it!  There was none left!  You can make this lower in fat be using turkey bacon, light mayo and skim milk.

Well, I didn't quite follow the recipe to a "T", but recipes are just guidelines, right?  Anyways, I only added 4 eggs, skipped the lettuce, used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and less than a cup, no sugar, and only about 1 cup of shredded cheddar.  I boiled my eggs 8 minutes, just because that's always how I've made hard boiled eggs, I'm not sure what the difference would be - they turned out fine.  By my calculations, I've cut the calories and fat by half or more.  I didn't layer, just mixed it all together.  Still, this tastes great!  And with the adjustments, it's something we can eat more than once a year without feeling toooo guilty!

This is a great buffet salad. I did add chopped celery and green onions as an additional layer. I used less sugar in the dressing and added salt and pepper.  I used a lasagna casserole and it was a great presentation.

A classic I grew up loving; thanks for posting it!  I took it to Thanksgiving last year and the bowl was cleaned out.  Ensure the peas are thawed because they won't thaw in 2 hours in the fridge once the salad is assembled.

The best I can say is blah.  The dressing was not good at all - like a big blob of mayo on your salad.  :(

For me this pea salad was just OK. I will stick with the non-layered type pea salad the way my mom makes it. I do have to say that my 1 year old LOVED this and kept begging for more.

This was very good. I didn't have any lettuce, so didn't add that, but still yummy.  I did add more bacon.

I wanted to bring something different for the holiday's this year so tried it out first on my family.  Well not only will I be making it for the holiday's, but it is now one of my family's favorite salad dishes.  I cut down on the mayo and added a bit more lettuce, which made it stretch.  My husband asked if there was anymore left the following night for supper.  It was a hit!!!

I have made this recipe many times.  My In-Laws request it all the time.  Every time I make this dressing I add 1-2 tablespoons of some kind of vinegar.  The best is red wine vinegar, though I haven't tried apple cider vinegar yet. I just think it's missing something without it. I have always experimented with the layers according to what I had or what sounded good, but you definately can't omit the peas.  That's what makes this salad so great.  Also I use turkey bacon.  This salad is a regular for family get-togethers.  It does make a lot, but it always gets eaten in our house.

Very tasty, although a little too much mayo for me. Next time I will try half mayo, half ranch dressing. Maybe ranch wwith bacon. Great recipe, reminds me of Grandmas. Thanks for the memmories.

Very yummy!  I did one thing wrong though I mixed the cheddar with the mayonnaise mixture, it made it pretty goopy, but was excellent anyway.  I will make this again soon.  (Next time following the directions :) )  Thanks so much!

This is an awesome salad for just about any occasion. I've taken it to office luncheons and family picnics, always leaving some behind to eat at home.   Two things I've discovered, and one is essential in my mind:   1. Be sure to remove at least the larger ribs from your Romaine lettuce. The big, thick ribs are bitter and can really spoil this salad, in my opinion.   2: You don't have to layer it. Mixing the ingredients together is easy, and weirdly I've seen more of it disappear when it's NOT layered. I really don't think it's any less attractive when mixed, and you don't have to worry about your presentation being ruined when you take it on the road.

Great salad.  I took this to a dinner party, and everyone gobbled it up...asking for seconds.  I bought real Bacon 'Bits' instead of cooking the bacon.

Fantastic!  9x13 pan was cleaned out in no time at all!  Thought the sugar was a lot as I was dumping it in, so I added some white wine vinegar.  I also used more milk than the recipe called for, the dressing seemed too thick to spread nicely.  Made half the pan with meat, the other half had no meat for the vegetarians in the crowd.  Both halves were devoured!!

Love it!!! After finding this recipe here over 5 years ago it has become a staple at all of our family get togethers!  After making it several times I decided to change it up a little bit by adding various things.  No way, they all wanted the "old pea salad" back!  The one thing I did change was the layering... lettuce, peas, eggs, dressing, cheese then bacon.  I also make it up the night before to give everything a chance to "meld" ...  Great recipe, thank you so much!!!

My mother used to make this same recipe and it was a favorite. I've continued the tradition. I tweak it a bit... add fresh spinach in place of some of the lettuce and add thin sliced red onion and thin sliced celery. Make in a trifle bowl for a beautiful presentation. I like to top with ringlets of red onion. Very pretty and delicious! Best if made the night before serving because the flavors really marry and enhance each other.

12-19-11:  This approaches a '5', could have used a little more dressing.

My daughter needed a dish to share with her friends at their "OMG we're going to college!" dinner tonight and we needed to accomodate for both vegetarians & meatatarians--We just saved the bacon for a topping (but I wasn't sure soggy bacon would be delish anyways!) and it was a hit. The only additions I made were to add finely diced purple onion & an equal amount of white wine vingear to the white sugar called for in the recipe. Added a nice little up note to the mayo dressing that would have been too sweet without it.

I had requests for Green Pea salad on our salad bar at the restaurant I work in, so yours is the recipe I chose to try.  Our customers absolutely love this simple salad! I don't use the lettuce because it's already on a full salad bar. I just mix up what what be probably a triple batch of the recipe here, and make sure it sits for at least a few hours chilling.  Not a pea lover (or even "liker" myself, I can't rate the salad based on my own tastes. Our customers, however, and quite many of the staff give it (and you!) a major high five.  Thanks a great and simple homemade salad recipe!

I made this for a gathering and there was not very many people. Everyone said how good it was and there was nothing left after the party. The second time I made this, I used 1 T. sugar and 1 T. vinegar. We liked it better that way. It gave it a little extra something. Either way it is a big hit at gatherings.

It was ok, my kids wouldn't eat it.  And they like all the ingredients.  I didn't really enjoy it much either.

I made this to put out with the dips and other hors d'oeurves on Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I did change a few things.  First, 2 cups is entirely too much mayo for this particular recipe.  Luckily my mom had an extra bag of frozen peas to add to the mayo.  I would use one cup per bag of peas used.  Since I was so preoccupied (I freaked out until my mom saved me ha!)with all the extra mayo I forgot to add the milk but it turned out fine.  I also used turkey bacon and light mayo.  Instead of layering (I didn't want a mouthful of only mayo) I mixed the peas, mayo mixture and bacon together, then topped with the shredded cheese and then placed the sliced eggs on the top (or vice versa).

Really its just salad with peas added to it. I used ff miracle whip. I think a common mistake when using mayo..... When we hear that term we automatically assume its what ever we have grown up loving. However, there is a difference between mayo and salad dressing. One is sweet, one is not. I added about half the sugar called for and that was plenty for me. Adjust the dressing mix to your taste before spreading it over your salad. I ended up adding about a 1/4 cup of Green Goddess dressing to it. And a tablespoon of ranch mix. I couldn't taste the ranch though. It's kinda bland, but we all loved it.

This was okay.  I liked the bacon that was added, but other than that, the salad was the same.   I didn't really like the lettuce in it.

This was yummy!  I altered to make more figure-friendly:  turkey bacon, ff mayo, egg whites, and lowfat cheese.  I also added about 1 T. Ranch dressing to give it a little kick!  Very nice with BBQ!  Thanks!

Great recipe for potlucks and gatherings.  I rarely have any left over.  Some changes I made were to mix ranch dressing with sour cream instead of mayo.  I have also substituted items I have on hand, such as croutons or salad crisps instead of eggs or bacon, and adding carrots, mushrooms or sliced cucumbers.

I made this with a big lasanga dinner and my whole family loved it. But the recipe makes a lot!! That was not a problem for us we liked it so much we ate all the leftovers the next day. I used turkey bacon and lite mayo and it was awesome.

Nice, different salad.  It does make a lot though.  I halved the recipe and more then halved the dressing.  I really enjoyed it, my kids didn't love it, mainly because of the peas.  This recipe is easy to tweek to you liking, adding or deleting ingredients.

Great recipe. Of course, not one that would be served often because of the fat content, although that can be lowered by using turkey bacon and ff mayo. I never put milk in it, and usually add a layer of celery and green onion. Frozen peas can be used if you refrigerate longer than 2 hours. Most recipes for this call for refrigerating overnight. I make with splenda and parmesan cheese rather than cheddar. As written, however, it still rates a 4 in my book. It is just darn good eating.
A must is to serve this in a pretty clear glass dish to let those layers sparkle through.

Granted this sounds good, but I can't believe anyone could look at the nutritional facts and still make it.  I would surely be looking for a healthier recipe.
