I love this recipe, and my family does too! Full disclosure: I have used the recipe twice now, but not exactly as written either time. This is what I changed (my daughter is pescetarian): 14 oz. Tofurkey Italian Sausage instead of hot dogs; 1 lbs. raw peeled shrimp instead of vegetarian fried chicken; 1.5 cups wild rice blend instead of 1 cup brown rice; ground thyme instead of dried. Also, the recipe calls for 2 tsp. cajun seasoning; I used 1 tsp of Tony Chacere's Cajun Seasoning, which has a lot of salt, and 1 tsp of creole spices with no salt added, which gives it a little more kick. Also, the first time I used dry rice, which did not cook thoroughly on the top layer, so the second time, I partially cooked the rice first.

We loved this!  I didn't use a whole can of hotdogs and only 1 can of FriChik, but it was really good!  Next time I will probably use a little less cayenne. And leftovers are good combined with refried beans in a bean/rice burrito.

Very tasty! I will make it again. I did change the cooking method. I pre cooked minute rice then added it to all the ingredients on the stove top. This allowed me to avoid heating up the kitchen with the oven.

No my cup of tea at all. Could live without the celery and the thyme overpowers the dish. May try it again without the celery and thyme.

Delicious only made a few changes, added 2 cups of water, and added 20 ounces of shrimp in lieu of meat substitutes.

I mixed it up a bit by adding some black beans and halved grape tomatoes. I also cooked the rice hall the time prior to baking. Will make again and again.

I loved it! I bought the spicy buffalo wings from Morning Star to give an extra kick and the diced tomatoes with the green chillies in them.
