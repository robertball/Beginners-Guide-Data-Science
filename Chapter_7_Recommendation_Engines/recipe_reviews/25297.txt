This was such an easy recipe to make and was so tasty.  I added a little white wine to the garlic and oil before adding the shrimp.  I also added a little water from the pasta pot to make it a little soupier.  I served it with a  salad and a hunk of Italian bread which people used to soak up the sauce.  This is a really nice recipe to make when you are really tired and you have company coming over or you want to make a special dinner in 10 minutes flat!  Goes great with white wine or champagne.

Took the advice of other reviewers and added a bit of butter and white wine to the shrimp and asparagus.  Served over farfalle with fresh grated Romano.  Fantastic dinner in 30 minutes or less!  This ones a keeper.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good premise, but dry. Perhaps reducing some white wine is a possibility or wine plus a Tb or two of the shrimp cooking water might work. Another option might be to saute some mushrooms or chopped, peeled and seeded tomatoes. Something -  anything - to increase the moisture would represent a big advance in sensory quality.

This is one of my family's favorites!  We double the amount of shrimp and serve with bowties and fresh grated parmesan.  Yummy (and oh so easy)!

I was going to cook this last night but was late getting home. My husband saw this recipe on the counter and cooked it using less oil, no cheese, and he added extra garlic and an onion. We mixed this w/ whole wheat pasta and had a spinach salad w/ it. Nice and light dinner!

This is such a quick, easy, and tasty recipe. It's easily one of my staples when I have shrimp on hand. I've also substituted broccoli for the asparagus depending on what's in season and it works well!

As written, this would not have been very good. There would have been next to no sauce for the pasta. As I came to this realization (while cooking it) I decided to throw about a 1/4 c. of white wine and about the same amount of chicken stock in to make a light sauce--this was just what the recipe needed.

Delicious!  My bf loved it, too.  I added tomatoes, onions, white wine, butter and extra garlic and served it over long grained wild rice.  It was nice and saucy!

This was so good!  I had it for lunch every day until it was gone.  I used a pound of shrimp more garlic added wine and used a whole package of asparagus from Trader Joes, and whole wheat pasta.  I used a tsp of hot sauce and my husband and I couldnt taste it so I will add more next time.  So yummy and EASY!

I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used a whole pound of shrimp, and served with bowtie pasta.  I also added the white wine and a little chicken broth, as there wasn't much sauce.  Didn't add the hot sauce because I didn't have any and my family doesn't like spicy food.  They thought it was great.  It is a nice light dish, and would be great in the summer.

It doesn't get much easier than this - minimal work, ingredients and time with maximum results.  I increased garlic and used some butter and wine with the oil.  Try it!!!

quick and healthy.  I boiled the frozen shrimp and asaparus in the last five minutes with the pasta.  Added chopped tomatoes after draining.  Then drizzled with the olive oil and garlic (paste is always on hand) and some canjun spice and black pepper. Then sprinkled with shredded parmesan.  No need for extra salt already in the cheese. Yummy and only one pot to clean

I also used less olive oil and no cheese.  I was only making it for two, so I used 1/2 lb shrimp.  I did add artichokes and chopped some grape tomatoes in half.  Instead of the broth or wine for the sauce, I used some of the water from the artichoke can (make sure not to get the kind in oil).  Mixed it all with some whole wheat penne and it was delicious!

This recipe was good and easy to make.  We didn't have asparagus so I used frozen broccoli instead.  My husband doesn't really veggies but he liked this dish because the hot sauce muted the veggie flavor.  Any easy weeknight meal that I'll definitely make again!

A yummy simple pasta recipe, cooked my spaghettini in crock-pot with 'Classico's italian sausage, pepper & onion sauce', along with olive oil, minced garlic, chopped asparagus & a little bit of water, let all this cook together for 2hrs, then added dethawed/cooked shrimp & scallops for another hour, topped it off with parmesan cheese & had some garlic toast with it, it was (fingers to lips) muah!

My family loves, loves this recipe! Instead of adding the hot sauce. I sprinkled in some Cajun Seaoning..which was wonderful. I serve it over rice or thin spaghetti. This is a quick, easy, and beautiful dish..cannot disappoint!

Nice and fresh tasting, though I do think it could do with a bit more seasoning. I tried adding some sweet chili sauce to it and it went really well!

This recipe turned out rather nicely with half a pound of asparagus.  I did not use the hot sauce and added salt and pepper to taste.

This was a wonderful variation on my standard spaghetti with oil and garlic dish, to which I sometimes add a veggie or two. The main differences were adding shrimp, and -- the clincher for me in what makes the recipe a 5-star one -- adding the hot sauce as well. (Actually, I used chopped red cherry peppers rather than hot sauce in a bottle.) As always, I didn't exactly follow the amounts given in the recipe ; for one thing, I used a lot more asparagus. Regarding some reviewers' comments that it was too dry, I did add a couple of spoons of the pasta cooking water, little by little during the cooking, but since I usually like my oil-and-garlic pasta fairly dry, I didn't have to add too much. All in all, this was a winner. The shrimp and the hot peppers really made it special.

This turned out great! It was light and had great flavor. I loved the hot sauce in it too. I also added in some butter and white wine.

A very good recipe that is just waiting to be personalized to your taste.  I mushrooms and next will also add some red bell pepper.  Some other reviewers mentioned that they added white wine - I used a very dry sherry and 2 TB of the pasta water - to create a light sauce. In the future I might also add some lemon juice, too. I really liked how fast it all came together.

Served alongside couscous (no pasta).  Substituted red pepper flakes in lieu of hot sauce (none on hand), and it was DELICIOUS!

This was really good.  And as others have said, it was sooo easy to make.  I think this recipe is well worth 5 stars.  Having said that, I'm only giving it four because I plan to make it again with some changes.  These changes are nothing against the original recipe, just some things that I would do differently.  First, I would try to use fresh (not frozen) shrimp.  Second, I would use fresh (not jarred) garlic.  Third, I would add a little salt.  I left out the hot sauce so maybe that's why I felt the recipe needed a little salt added.  It still turned out great and I look forward to making this again and giving it a five star rating.  I served this over whole wheat penne pasta and with the Spinach and Stawberry salad form this site.  This will be great meal for the summertime because it's light and so easy to make.

I loved this, I also doubled the shrimp to a full pound, added a splash of white wine, and then served it over Gemelli (had them on hand).  Lovely dinner, I think I will add more asparagus next time too!  But this is quick and a keeper!

So delicious and easy. A healthy(depending on how much cheese you add)and light supper when paired with whole wheat pasta (recommend Ronzoni Healthy Harvest).  The BF and I loved this one and will make it again.

Loved this!!  
I too added butter and white wine to the sauce, as well as, about 1/4 cup of fresh Italian parsley.

This tasted great and was quick and easy to make. I addedd a lot of hot sauce and almost doubled the garlic and I think I will add even a little more  next time. We loved it and will have this regularly.
