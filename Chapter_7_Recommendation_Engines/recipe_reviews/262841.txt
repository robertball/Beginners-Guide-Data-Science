I made this, but with healthier substitutions to see if it would still come out good. I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar, almond milk instead of cow's milk, coconut oil instead of olive oil. I also used dark cocoa because that is all I had.  I cooked for 50 seconds.  The result was great.  I will never use eggs again for my mug cakes.  Next time, I will try it with oat flour instead of wheat flour to make it gluten free :)

So I've made a lot of mug cakes and these instructions are not right. I put the solid ingredients in first, used a 1/4 tsp for the baking powder, and then the liquid ingredients. I didn't understand the cooking time. 30 seconds to 2 minutes??? I put it in there for 50 seconds and it looks like  a middle school volcano project for the science fair made out of chocolate so that's something

I have made many mug cakes and this one might be okay if you make some adjustments.:
I used the olive oil but I think I would try another type of oil if I make it again.
But the main problem is cooking time as others have commented. 30 second to 2 minutes (because our microwave aren’t the same! 
I did mine for 60 seconds on medium power and mine was still mud in the middle. I then cooked it on regular power for a minute  and it was overdone.

When I made this recipe, it didn't even cook... I put it in for 65 seconds, then again for a minute. When I took it out the second time, the top had a "crust" so to speak, and the inside was total fudge. The taste was okay.... I was just disappointed that it was "fudge" not cake...

I made a lot of changes and was surprised how well it turned out.
I subbed 1/2 the flour for coconut flour, 1/2 the sugar with stevia, and used cashew milk & vegetable oil. 

I cooked mine for 3 instances of 40 seconds each time.

It came out more like a warm fudge, but tastes marvelous.

I have made this recipe three times, and it makes enough for two people. I took another reviewer’s recommendation and used coconut oil instead of olive oil. I tried this recipe with chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. Of the two, I preferred the chocolate  chips.

It tasted kind flavorless to me. But overall, it was OK.

I have made other kinds of mug cakes and this one is the best one so far. Instead of topping it with powder sugar, I topped it with vanilla ice cream. I also added no almonds. The cake is very good and I recommend making it!

I didn't have any on hand, so I didn't use chocolate chips or almonds.
The resulting cake was somewhat dry, but palatable. 
Although you can omit the chocolate chips, I feel like it would be a lot better with them.
Next time I want to make a mug cake I will use this recipe, it's defiantly worth a try. Just use chocolate chips.
Update: I made it a second time, but with slight changed to the recipe.
As I last said, I didn't use the chocolate chips or almond flakes.
I substituted olive oil (last time it had a bit of an olive oil taste) with coconut oil (equal amount), and added a bit of water, maybe about a tablespoon.
This drastically improved the recipe. I would pair it with whipped cream, ice cream, and add chocolate chips if I had any of those, but with the changes I made it tasted way better!

I didn't add the almonds bc my family doesn't like nuts. the olive oil did make a flavor change. t probably would have tasted better without the olive oil.
