Guess what I made this into a french toast bake and it was delicious.  I first greased a 9x13 pan and loaded it up with bread cubes.  Next I took the recipe's liquid ingredients along with the pumpkin and pureed it all in the blender.  Next, poured it over the bread cubes and baked it for 35-40 minutes at 350F.  When it was done I sprinkled cinnamon sugar over top and drizzled with powder sugar and milk glaze.  Yummy from all my coworkers. and what raves!  Just remember to heavily grease the pan and easy clean up.  Another Bake and Take.

Great jumping off point. After reading some of the reviews, I thought I could make this a little more "pumpkin-y". I took 1/2 c. pumpkin and whipped it with 1/4 c. powdered sugar and 1/2 c. cream cheese. I added 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice when it was near the end of whipping. I also added pumpkin pie spice to the egg mixture instead of the spices alone. I spread the pumpkin-cream cheese mixture inside of two slices whole wheat bread and made stuffed french toast. I served it with hot maple syrup and bacon. This made for a nice lazy Sunday lunch.

Delicious!  We doubled the pumpkin puree and still found the pumpkin taste to be pretty subtle.  I would not increase the pumpkin past 1/2 cup or the egg mixture may lose its consistency.  I added a splash of vanilla extract (personal taste).  Using Texas Toast, this recipe made 6 slices = 3 servings.  Either add 2 t. sugar or serve with powdered sugar or syrup.  This was fantastic, we'll make it again.

This was really good, but as other reviewer stated, not very pumpkin-y.  I guess that's good if you are hiding the pumpkin in there for extra vitamins, but not so good if you LOVE pumpkin like we do :)  Next time I will try more pumpkin and less egg to see what happens.  I used some pumpkin  pie spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg, and  I added a little sugar to the batter to sweeten it up some as grandson does not use syrup.

Really yummy on a crisp fall morning! I personally swapped out some of the straight cinnamon for pumpkin pie spice, then added a bit of white sugar to the egg mixture because I always do for my french toast. The pumpkin flavor is subtle and my daughter even asked, "Where did the pumpkin go?" but it is delicious.  I only got six pieces out of my mixture, though my bread pieces were not large and I didn't dip them very long. A big hit nevertheless!

Very delicious!  I mixed a little vanilla and powdered sugar into whipped cream cheese and made sandwiches with the french toast. Sooooo good and super easy and quick to make.

I appreciate this idea very much. I made it for myself and my 1 year old this weekend, and we both loved it! I doctored the recipe quite a bit, which is why I gave it only four stars...but the idea alone is worth four stars, so there ya go.    I used only 1 egg with 1/4 cup pumpkin and added a touch of honey and a bit of milk to thin it up a bit. I kept the spices the same. My son gobbled his slice up and asked for "mo", which is a rare thing these days. I added the honey so no syrup would be necessary, and I didn't even want any.  I bet maple syrup could be used for the same effect.   Overall great flavor, and a good way to get some veggies in without complaints!

This was good, but not amazing. Definitely needs more pumpkin flavor, unless you're trying to sneak in a serving of veggies like the author.  The type of bread used is important. I used a loaf of wheat cause i had it on hand, and you couldnt taste the pumpkin at all.

I make french toast every week and love pumpkin so this was a must try for me. I doubled the pumpkin and added splenda to the batter. It turned out light and fluffy and was great with powdered sugar on top. Would recommend for something different.

Very good base recipe but needs a higher sauce to bread ratio to fully soak the bread. I make 3 servings of sauce per 4 slices of bread for my hubby & I. Used egg beaters and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Delish!

Great idea - pumpkin French Toast!  I'll have to try the traditional recipe next time.  I followed the baked french toast recipe in a 13x9 inch pan using Oatnut Bread (perfect for this) but I addedd 2 T. of brown sugar and 2 T. of heavy cream along with 1/2 C. of pumpkin - it was SO good!  I baked it for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven and drizzled it with a milk/powdered sugar/maple syrup glaze - YUM!  I also want to turn it into more of a pumpkin bread pudding with 2 more eggs and, probably, a cup of pumpkin, more cream and brown sugar.  Delicious!

What a great idea! I used 1/2 cup pumpkin and substituted 4 egg whites to replace two of the whole eggs. It was tastey and healthy!

This does not have a strong pumpkin flavor. In fact you can hardly taste the pumpkin. A good way to sneak in a health dose if Vitamin A.

I doubled the recipe, but used a whole can of pumpkin and then doubled up again on spices d/t other reviews. Also baked it as another reviewer did. Really was delicious, easy and fun for a holiday breakfast.

Really good idea. Decent recipe.  A little to mild for my taste.  It needed more flavor.  So I added a couple TB brown sugar, pumpkin spice, and vanilla. Much better!!

I was afraid of leaving too much batter on the bread in case I'd have nothing left for the last slice of bread.  Not a problem!  In fact, I had some left over.  It tasted more pumpkin-y when I didn't scrape off excess batter from the bread.  I also used ground cloves instead of nutmeg (personal preference).  Will try this as a bake as marthajones did, sure to be good!

Thank you!  Great way to use leftover pumpkin and evap milk.  I added more seasonings and pumpkin (happened to have more leftover), evap milk to thin (& to use it up), and sprinkled cinn sugar on each side as it cooked.  Even my "thin" lower cal bread tasted great.  Also used light syrup.  Will try it as a bake next time.  =)

AHMAZING! Just personalized it a bit based upon our own pumpkin pie recipes. I added 1/8 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, increased the amount of pumpkin to 1 cup. My husband and son went crzy for this.

Pretty tasty!  I scaled it down to one serving and made it with a bagel and it turned out quite good.  Definitely had a nice pumpkin taste to it.  Also, the egg mixture was quite generous so you could really let the bread soak it up.  Could use a bit of sweetness, but still delicious, I'll probably make it again.

Very good recipe, as some of the others said, the pumpkin flavor lacks a little in this recipe. I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. It was perfect!

I prepared this one as written but found it to be dry and flavorless. No hint of pumpkin flavor or even the spices. I was quite surprised as I was expecting more. I see now that several reviewers increased the pumpkin, changed up the spices and added vanilla.

These are so good they taste like they should be bad for you.. I used oat bread instead of whole wheat and could taste the pumpkin fine.  Only used the oat bread because that is what I had.  This bread was light however and could not stay in the mixture long.  Really nice change if you already like french toast.  It's like the easy or instant version of pumpkin pie and it's good for you.   Although the pumpkin may not be overly strong.  I found the ingredients/spices completely mask the eggs.  This turns them into a sweet and spicy dessert like breakfast!

Tasted great, however, I have never made any French toast w/o milk in the recipe.  I added about half a cup of milk & still didn't have enough for all 8 pieces of bread.

I changed the recipe based on other reviewers. I used 1/2 cup of pumpkin, added a tsp of vanilla and then put dashes of nutmeg, cloves, and allspice in addition to the cinnamon. I love a strong spice flavor...I needed to put more spices. I didn't add sugar to the batter, but did use syrup to eat it with. My husband said these were very hearty. I would have to agree. They were delicious.

Like others said, this recipe is decent but better when the pumpkin and spices are increased.  A good starting point for pumpkin french toast.

very tasty, but the pumpkin is much more subtle than I would have anticipated.. but the mixture came out very well. I added whipped cream and cinnamon to the top. Excellent fall breakfast to keep things interesting :)

Quick and easy, I used cinnamon sugar butter which enhanced the flavor. I think it would be better with a brown sugar crumble for more flavor.

With changes I would give this 4 out of 5 stars.  Based on recommendations here I doubled pumpkin.  I used sliced ciabatta bread that I wanted to use up and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  It was very yummy!  When I ran out of that bread, I used some Pepperidge Farms whole grain soft honey oat bread, and the flavor wasn't nearly as good - couldn't taste the pumpkin.  I like the idea of whole wheat for the added nutrients, but I don't think it will work well.

I liked the idea of the stuffed French toast and, since I had more pumpkin, decided to try that version.  My husband is a diabetic, so the once change I made was to substite 4 tsp of splenda brown sugar in place of the powdered sugar in the filling.  I thought it turned out well.  Thanks for a great recipe and reviews!

This was good, although as others have said, we could not really taste the pumpkin even though I increased it to 1/2 cup.  I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon/nutmeg combo and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  The batter was really thick, so you want to use a hearty bread.

This turned out really nicely for me. I ended up only using 4 slices of bread for the pumpkin & egg mixture because the bread I used absorbed a lot.  I don't mind that. I topped with some butter and syrup and will be making it again. I'm going to experiment with some spices and vanilla extract next time.

Made according to directions... only difference was I used Panera multi-grain bread. Couldn’ t taste the pumpkin and spices. The multi-grain overpowered the tastes.

Its a good base recipe and like others doubled the pumpkin and spices, added a pinch of ginger, halved the eggs, added 1 tsp of white sugar, and a splash of half and half. Regular milk would be fine too... desperately needs something to thin it out. I got 6 really good coated pieces of french toast using thick texas toast. With the changes it was awesome! Great fall breakfast!

I added more pumpkin as others did and still could barely taste the pumpkin. Also upped the spices some. I liked its concept but wouldn't say it's any mor seasonal that normal French toast since you can't taste the pumpkin really.

I was looking for some guidance on egg/pumpkin proportions, and this seemed to be perfect.  I'll keep this on hand for using up pumpkin.  We are a pumpkin loving family, so we enjoyed this.  I always make french toast at home with wheat bread, and the pumpkin did a nice job giving it a more decadent flavor.

I have made this a few times now. It's 5-star delicious with some modification. Don't use the recipe as written. It needs brown sugar and a lot more batter. I used 1 cup pumpkin, 2 eggs, 1 cup egg whites, and 8 slices of whole wheat bread. Today I substituted leftover canned pumpkin pie filling for the pumpkin and brown sugar. It was great.

This was very good. The taste was subtle but just enough. I did still need syrup.
