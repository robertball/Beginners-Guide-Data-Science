3.6.18  I failed to pat the roasted peppers dry, and the dip was a little runny, so I just drained it for a couple minutes to reach the right texture.  "Note to Self:  be sure to pat the peppers dry next time."  The balsamic flavor is subtle, the almonds give it a bit of a acrunchy texture, and the roasted peppers bring some sweetness.  Do allow it to chill in the fridge, as the flavor improves.  HurdBird, thanks for sharing.
