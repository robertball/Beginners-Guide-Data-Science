Glad I read the reviews first.  30 min. is perfect time, anything more would be overbaked.  Otherwise, followed recipe to a T & very happy with the results!

I used two 10oz bags of Nestle's dark chocolate morsels, 1/2 cup Sugar in the Raw instead of white sugar, and almond extract ( because someone put back an empty vanilla bottle!)

They were just delicious and my grandsons loved them!

These are extremely easy, and use ingredients I keep on hand all the time.  I like being able to melt the butter first, as I keep mine in the freezer and HATE to have to wait for it to come to room temperature.  But this worked really well.  Yummy cookie bars just the way the recipe is written.   ******UPDATE****** The second batch I changed up a little bit.  Instead of vanilla -- I'm out!!--- I used some orange oil for flavor, and tossed in a handful of coconut flakes.  I also used a mixture of white and dark chocolate chips, and made a recipe and a half.  I really prefer this way.  The orange oil enriches the recipe, and I was able to cut back a bit on the sugar by using white chips.

Cut recipe in half because I didn’t have enough butter. Also used semi sweet chocolate chips as that was all I had.  Baked in 8x8” pan for 30 mins. YUM!  Will definitely make again!

We love these cookies. Very easy recipe that yields a fantastic chocolate chip cookie. I followed the recipe as written. I always cook with unsalted butter. The trick is to cream the butter, sugar and eggs until light and fluffy. I always mix my dry ingredients in a separate bowl and whisk them. Then I ad it to the creamed mixture. Also don't put extra chocolate chips in. The first time I made it I added an additional cup of chips. It made the cookie way too gooey. 
This recipe cooks quickly. My oven usually takes 20 minutes. So keep an eye on it. The toothpick test won't work with this recipe. Great recipe, made a huge hit at my house.

After reading reviews, set timer for 25 min but they weren’t done yet my toothpick DID come out clean so beware. Ended up covering with foil bc browness was where I liked it and I didn’t want them to burn and continued to cook till the 40 min mark. They were perfect. Chocolate did all settle on bottom like another reviewer stated but I didn’t mind! I used half semi sweet and half milk chocolate bc that’s what I prefer. I also used light brown sugar bc that’s what I have. 
Just made another batch. This time I left butter at room temp and it was waaaaaay harder to spread it in the pan so melted the next batch. Followed same technique with baking 25 min, cover with foil, bake another 15 and they dried out quickly.  Third time, baked for 30 min and they dried out quickly too. Not sure why the first batch worked but I think they do need to be baked less.  
Also thought it was going to be way too much butter bc they were so buttery when I pulled them out of the pan but it must’ve soaked back in as they sat. I still think next time I will cut back on butter and see how they turn out.

Excellent recipe! I did play with it some by substituting 1/4 cup whole wheat flour that I'm trying to use up. I also use pure maple syrup in place of the vanilla, all light brown sugar, and milk chips. Okay, maybe that made it a different recipe, but following it exact would have been amazing, too!

I love these cookie bars!! they were really good! the whole family loved them. the only thing I would suggest is to only soften the butter, not melt it. melting it, just made it to thin and all the chocolate chips sank to the bottom, but other wise they were great! :)

I didn't read the reviews so I baked for 40 minutes.  They smelled a little burned and were hard around the edges. They taste ok, just not what I was expecting.

So I made these and they have the perfect texture. I only had one cup of dark chocolate chips so I added butter scotch chips. They were good but a little salty. I don't know why. But other than that they satisfied my craving for cookie. :)

Wow, these are good! I didn't melt the butter, because mine was already pretty soft. Wanted to try using the caramel-center M&Ms, so I used 1/2 cup of those, plus 1/2 cup of salted caramel baking chips, then 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, which is all I had on hand. I also tossed in some pecans that I needed to use up. Forgot the salt, though, will have to remember it next time. Lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper, buttered the sides, baked for 25 minutes only. I have a table-top convection oven, and it tends to bake more quickly than a standard oven. I used both the top and bottom heating elements, which browned the top a bit much, so next time maybe just try with the bottom only.

I just made these, The bars are perfect looking, however, I was a little disappointed because I felt they came out a little bit to dry.
I lowered my bake time to do the 30 minutes (I think 25 minutes would be best) I eliminated 1/4 cup of the white sugar and just used  1/4 cup and the amount of brown sugar the recipe calls for. 1-1/2 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips plus 1/2 cup of butterscotch, I feel maybe 3/4 cup of butterscotch morsels would of been better, I could barely taste the butterscotch morsels. I also lined my 9 x 13 bake pan with aluminum foil, maybe eliminate the foil?
I wonder if adding an extra egg yoke as well as dropping the bake time would help with the dryness??? Perhaps I will drizzle some chocolate syrup on this batch to help moisten them up!  Eventually, I will try making these again with those changes.

I followed the recipe exactly.  By the time the middle was cooked through, the rest of it was overcooked.  The chocolate chips melted completely and mixed in with the dough, so the final product was chocolate flavored without actual distinct chocolate chips.  The bars were overly greasy and a little too sweet.

I made it exactly as the recipe dictates, with the size pan called for, but it burned after only 30 minutes in the oven. Now it is hard as a rock. 

I may try this again with a lighter pan, and for a shorter amount of time.

I thought that they were a little heavy on the butter, but my family absolutely loved them!

This may have been the first time I melted butter for a cookie recipe, but I think it works out great.  I only had margarine, so used that.  When I poured the mixture/batter into a baking dish I was concerned at how thin it spread but it definitely puffs up to make a great bar cookie.  Like others, I pulled the pan around 30 minutes and still felt they were a little too "cakey" so will pull earlier next time.  Also, I probably should have used a bit more cooking spray to make for an easier removal.  Still, I will try this again (and again and again :))

I made this today for the guys doing some excavating at our house.  I modified only a tad because of altitude and flattened cookies in the recent past.  I softened unsalted butter so added an additional 3/4 tsp salt.  I also used 3/4 tsp each baking soda and powder.  I added 1 cup chopped walnuts just because.  Baked at 375 (altitude) for 20" and they are perfection!  Thanks for the recipe it's going to be a favorite

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I've been looking for a good chocolate chip cookie bar recipe, and this is a keeper. The only changes I made was to use semi-sweet chocolate chips because that's what I had in the cupboard, I used softened butter, not melted, and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon just because I usually do in chocolate chip cookies. Really good.

Make sure you lower the baking time.  The reviewers are 100% correct and 30 minutes is perfect.  This is an ok recipe.  It’s a strange cross between a blondie, cookie, brownie.  It has a pretty heavy butter flavor and isn’t too sweet.  I didn’t like it but my Mom & teenager said it was good.  I brought it with 4 other types of cookies to a work party and these were the only ones not all gone in minutes.  Probably personal preference but I don’t think I’ll make it again.

Very easy & very good. But cooked for only 30 minutes as others suggested, which was perfect. My son loved them especially with a scoop of ice cream and chocolate syrup on top.

Excellent! I made the recipe as directed (though I used softened butter rather than melted just out of habit) and used semisweet chocolate chips. I did reduce cooking time as other reviewers recommended. They were delicious (soft, chewy, and sweet with a delightful sugary texture) and were devoured at a picnic!

Very good recipe. It doesn't look like a lot of dough, but it definitely needs the 9 x 13 pan because they will spread and rise quite a bit. Mine only took 30 minutes to bake. They came out fluffy and chocolatey.

This is very quick and easy, and makes a wonderful dessert.  I added chopped walnuts to the batter - just a personal preference.  We all enjoyed them.
