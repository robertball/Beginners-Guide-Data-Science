I liked this dish a lot. It's very easy and tasty. I actually did something a little different that turned out REALLY well: I used a glass ungreased 9 X13 baking pan and I added 2 cups of raw rice, and 2-and-a-half cups of water to the bottom of the pan. I stirred the rice to make sure it soaked the water in well, then I put the chicken on top of the rice/water mix, and poured the sauce over that. I baked it covered with tin foil for 20 minutes @ 400F, then I removed the tin foil and baked for 30 or so minutes uncovered. The rice cooks thoroughly and easily on its own, absorbing the flavorful sauce, and the chicken is very moist and tender with a coating of the sweet and sour. I think next time I might add a little pineapple before I pour on the sauce because I love pineapple.

VERY tasty! I added chunky pieces of green pepper, while arranging the dish for the oven. Next time I will add the green pepper 5 or 10 minutes before taking out of the oven. Upon taking the dish out, I placed the chicken breasts on bed of white rice on a serving dish, added some pineapple chunks, and covered it all with the leftover sauce. Definately will add this to my rotation.  My husband loved it!

It was good, but too sweet for me.  

I used bone in thighs chicken. I cut the butter in half, as 1/4 cup seemed like it would be excessive. threw in some green pepper with 10 minutes to go.  had some pineapple on the side. Went well with white rice.

I don't know if I will make this again, but if I do I will cut the brown sugar in half.

VERY YUMMY but man is it sweet!!!!  We served it over white rice and the leftovers heated up beautifully!  We also added a little shake of red pepper flake to combat the sweetness and add a little extra zing.  Thank you!

Excellent, with in our opinion, a perfect meld of flavors. You can't really taste the white wine, however, the sauce has a distinctive flavor to it that is sooooo good. Served it with rice and a little soy sauce. Next time, will try adding cornstarch to thicken the sauce after cooking, and will add green peppers and pineapple. My husband and teenage son absolutely LOVED it, want me to make more ASAP!!!

My turn to prepare the office lunch and I choose Hawaiian Chicken II. Because the menu was enlarged, my prep/cook time was about 4 hours to prepare for forty-two people. To this day I am still getting rave reviews to the meal that was prepared last July â€™01. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a tasty, easy recipe which soaks up lots of the sweet & sour flavor.  If you like pineapple, put it in as you serve and pour leftover sauce over it.  Everyone I tried it out on really enjoyed it.

This was great!  I browned the chicken first, and I added a small can of drained chopped pineapple, a chopped red bell pepper, a large pinch of red pepper flakes, and freshly ground salt and pepper.  Cook at lower temp (350) for half hour and it's perfect!  I served over rice with a side of green beans.

Passable, but not something I would make again. I think the texture of the chicken (basically poached) turned me off the most, but I also found that the butter was too prominent a flavour. I'd suggest cutting the butter in half.

This is definitely a keeper.  I used my own version of this recipe, I placed my chicken in a baking dish, mixed my sauce as directed, except that I used Orange Juice Concentrate, instead of Orange Juice, speared my chicken, poured the sauce on top and set it in the fridge for 2 hours, allowing it to absorb some of the sauce flavor.  I baked it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, turned the chicken, placed pineapple slices in the sauce, and baked for the remaining 15 minutes.  It was excellent!!!!!

This was very good after I made the following changes:  I omitted the brown sugar altogether (it's sweet enough without it), decreased the butter to about 2 tablespoons, added 1 tablespoon cornstarch to the sauce to help thicken it up, and decreased the cooking temp to 350 degrees.  I also added one can of drained pineapple chunks, 1 coarsely chopped red pepper and 1/2 coarsely chopped red onion with about 20 minutes to go.  It tasted great, but the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the chicken looked pale and undercooked, even though it wasn't.  Next time, I'll brown the chicken for a couple of minutes and reduce the cooking time by about 10 minutes.  It'll be a 5-star for sure!

Just had to rate this recipe again.  I prepared it last night but substituted center cut pork chops for the chicken.  This should be listed as a dish for pork also.  Thanks again.

This is a good "starter" recipe for Sweet and Sour ANYTHING (chicken, shrimp, pork, etc.) you may choose to make. But it DOES seem to need ajustments in order to be palatable. I, personally, reduced the sugar, omitted the wine and added pineapple chunks. I whisked the sweet and sour sauce with about 2 or 3 T. corn starch (I do it "by hand", so my measurements are not always precise), the pineapple juice (from the can) and a bit (perhaps 2 T.) butter (we use the SALTED kind in my house). My family liked it well enough. And it looked REALLY pretty (quite a lovely presentation when served over white rice). But I'm not sure I will attempt to follow this recipe ever again.

NOTE: I forgot to mention that I used skinned chicken thighs rather than skinless chicken breasts when I prepared this dish. Two thighs per serving and snap peas on the side and (as I said), it looked really pretty.

Chicken did not glaze, it just poached in the juice.  It didn't have much flavor.  The sauce was flavorful, but the juice from the chicken diluted it.

WOW! I was looking for a Hawaiian chicken recipe that didn't require pineapple (I was out!) and I'm so glad I found this one. Absolutely wonderful taste, easy to make, and so tender it melted in my mouth. Everyone loved it and begged me to make it again.

I wish I could rate this with more than 5 stars!  This was AMAZING!!!  So tender & juicy & SoOoOo full of flavor!  I have a VERY picky 9 year old and he LOVED it!  I did change it up just a little.  I pre-cooked the chicken on the stove in a little butter, added garlic powder, salt, fresh ground pepper, and a little bit of crushed red pepper.  I made the sauce as listed, minus the wine, & added a few dashes of soy sauce and a small can of pineapple tidbits WITH the juice.  I put a bit of butter in a glass 9X13 dish & melted it in the oven while I mixed the sauce.  (I really think you could skip the extra butter.)  Then I put the chicken breast in the dish, poured the sauce on top, tossed it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes and turned it half way through.  I served this with a Lipton chicken & veggie rice and a side of carrots.  It was DELICIOUS!!!

Very good. I cut the chicken in bite size pieces, only used 1/2 cup brown sugar, and it came out delicious.  Served over white rice. Will make again.

This was great! My hubby doesn't really care for sweet sauces but he added a little tobasco to his and loved it! I added a little more wine to the over all recipe since love cooking with wine. I would use a dry white wine so it's not to sweet due to the sauce for the chicken being very sweet before the wine. Thanks for recipe! :-)

I followed the advice from other reviews and only used 1/2 cup brown sugar.  It was great over rice.  This is now a family favorite.

It was okay, but I did alter the recipe.  I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 3T of butter.  The sweetness was about right but it could've used a little kick.  If I make this again, I will try some red pepper, which was suggested by other users.  Besides the taste, this was very simple to make.  Also, I cut the chicken into bite size pieces before cooking.

This is very good! I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and added a pinch of red pepper flakes and it was still sweet enough but not too sweet. After 40 minutes in the oven the sauce was still thin but delicious and the chicken was cooked perfectly! Served over creamy coconut rice. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was very easier to prepare, and the chicken was pretty good.  However, I had lots of extra sauce, which I found too sweet to use on rice.  Overall, I don't think the taste was good enough to justify the excessive amount of sugar used in preparation.

Yum! This was delicious. Very easy to make, too. Just mix together the ingredients, pour em over the chicken and let bake for about an hour. I watched TV while the chicken baked.

I think I'm going to try this also with pork chops. This time I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts but I think it would work fine with bone-in chicken also.

Excellent!  Do reccomend some "saltier" side dishes to balance the sweetness.  Used a mango salsa and garnished with geranium petals.   Baked potato with a salty pico de gallo and sour cream.  Beautiful presentation!

Used half of the brown sugar required and added pineapple chunks.  It was fabulous and went over great at my other-in-law's birthday dinner.

Not bad. I did think this recipe was sweet, and I didn't put in the sugar at all because I'm not a big sweet fan. I scaled it to one serving and made it for my lunch at work--only had a bit of sweet and sour sauce and bf doesn't like things like this. I used a frozen skinless chicken breast and it was fine. I wouldn't buy the sweet and sour sauce just to make it, but I'd make it again if I had some on hand.

I printed this recipe back on 6/20/06 and noticed that today, the recipe has slightly been altered as far as cooking time.  Unfortunately, I cooked it for one hour as instructed on the 6/2006 printout and it was too dry.  I used dry white wine and didn't find it too sweet at all... however, I did find the butter to be way too much.  I think that 2T of butter will be enough and less cooking time.

Followed the recipe modification that called for rice to be put in the casserole 1st with water and the chicken 'on top' - mistake.. As another person noted, the chicken was poached. Whatever flavor from the sweet-sour sauce was diluted by all the water. Although I left the dish in the oven 15-20 min longer than called for - some rice was still not cooked. I gave it a 3*. My son still gave (just) the chicken a 4*. I'm confident that following the original recipe gets you a 4* - at least. Will do the original recipe next time.

Very simple and yummy!  After reading other reviews, I put in only 1/2 cup of brown sugar to cut down on the sweetness, and it turned out wonderfully!

I added a green pepper and green beans, need to cook a little less next time. Great sweet tangy taste.

this is a very tasty dish.  i read many of the reviews and tried to change up the too sweet that many people said.  i believe i succeeded.  if you like spicy try this.  add one tablespoon of crushed red pepper to the sauce mix.  it makes it more of a chinese sweet and spicy dish that i just love.  i will make this again very soon. 

okay, this is an update, (second time making it) i didn't noticed someone already tried the pepper flake idea.  oops.  but that means twice tried, must be a solid idea.

This is a very good recipe.  I made it for a Hawaiian luau for work and everyone loved it. However, it is a very sweet dish.  It was too sweet for my taste.  I made some alterations with the items on the skewers.  I placed mushroom, chicken, red onion, shrimp, and pineapples.  I used something to suit everyones taste.  However, be careful not to overcook the shrimp.  You probably should grill the chicken and then add the shrimp close to the end of the cooking time.

My family loved this recipe, especially my husband.  His exact words, "This chicken is great".  However, I used chicken tenders as oppose to the chicken breast.

Didn't change the recipe, but was disappointed that it was very watery.  Next time I make it I will either cook the chicken on the top of the stove or bake it first, then add the cooked sauce.
The flavor was good.

Turned out great! The chicken actually doesn't look very appetizing when it comes out but tastes great. Very tender and great with rice.

Nice flavor but sauce didn't thicken up much in the allotted cooking time. I think next time I might consider thickening the sauce on the stove before pouring it over the chicken and putting it in the oven. Added some pineapple at serving time and that was quite nice!
