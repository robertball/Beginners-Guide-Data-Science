This was a collaborative effort between Hubs and me.  As this recipe's first reviewer I wanted to make sure I stuck to the recipe as closely as possible. For the most part I did, however, I did use a smidge less Old Bay and lemon zest, and omitted the garlic since I used 2 T. of crushed, buttery garlic croutons in place of the "buttery round (i.e., Ritz) crackers. For color interest, texture and extra flavor I added a couple tablespoons of finely chopped sweet red bell pepper. I didn't measure the lemon juice, just gave it a good squeeze. I found it needed NO salt.  This tinkering is only a reflection of personal taste, and not a criticism of the recipe which I'm sure is find as it stands.  I do have a criticism, however, and that is that the size of the lobster tail is not indicated, which could greatly affect the cooking time!  We used four (6 oz.) tails, and Hubs baked them for 15 minutes! Any larger tail would have required longer cooking time - this recipe directs 10-12 minutes, but for what sized tail?  Very good recipe overall.  Hubs particularly enjoyed it, while I will always be a fan of strictly broiled lobster tail with hot drawn butter.

This recipe was so easy delicious! I subbed some whole wheat crackers for the buttery ones (always changing up ingredients where I can to make things a little healthier). My grocery store also ran out of lump crab meat and I used a high quality canned crab meat that I was nervous would make it "fishy" and it was awesome instead of spending $20 I spent $5 and it was really good. Making this for a upcoming dinner party.

I will make it again but will cook the lobster tails a little first before adding the crab meat mix.  The crab meat mix cooks faster than the inside meaty portion of the lobster tail.  I think the crab meat mix creates a buffer that slows down the cooking process in the lobster.

I used the stuffing recipe for portabella mushrooms and it was excellent. The only changes I made was to add a little extra lemon juice and used canned crab (that's what I had) . I will definitely make this again but will omit the salt and use lump crab like the recipe calls for. My husband LOVED this and asked that I make it again as an entree with a vegetable!

Amazing entree. Made it for dinner this evening, followed the directions as written. I added half a lemon juice, great  taste and texture. Paired with it linguine tossed in a butter and garlic. Perfect dinner.

I made 5 (5oz) tails, and increased everything accordingly. Even though I piled the stuffing high, we had about a cup left over. Totally fine by me! It's amazing heaped on bread and toasted, which was the next day's indulgent breakfast. Possibly beacuse of how much stuffing I used, it took about 15 minutes for the tails to completely reach 145 degrees. By this time the crab was a little crusty on top, and we loved it. It wasn't burnt at all - just gave a nice counterpoint to the tender tail meat.  If you have never used this technique to lay the tail meat on top, don't be scared off by it. It isn't terribly difficult. The meat will stick a little to the shell on top. I find it easiest to loosen the meat from the bottom first and then wiggle my finger slowly around until it's free. Any meat still clinging to the shell is easy to get after cooking.

I made this for New Years dinner for 8 people. It was a huge success!  Everyone raved about it.  I will definitely make this again. The recipe was easy - the hardest part was splitting the lobster tails and pulling the meat out to sit on top.
I followed the recipe almost exactly - the only thing I changed was the amount of lemon zest. I zested 1 lemon and probably had about 2 tsp. (Not the 4 if I had quadrupled it).I tasted it then and decided that it was perfect without adding more. I also only doubled the salt - Old Bay was salty enough.  It was easy to make for a crowd and it looked like I had spent all day in the kitchen!  Made it earlier in afternoon and refrigerated till ready to pop in oven

First, to the reviewer saying it's much better with the mustard mayo mix... That doesn't necessarily  make it better; just different. You never said whether or not you tried it both ways.  I found this to be very good and a very simple recipe to present an elegant looking dish.  I used already cooked tails. I baked the stuffing for a short time, then topped the tails with the stuffing and broiled them for a few minutes. I did cut back a bit on the zest. I served them with petite filet mignons and asparagus.

We made this recipe almost exactly as is except we used canned lump white crab meat because it was cheaper than fresh, and we substituted 1 teaspoon dried parsley for the fresh parsley and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper for the white pepper. This turned out really good except the crab stuffing was rather salty, maybe because we used canned meat. Next time, I'd leave out the extra 1/4 teaspoon salt and maybe even try to find unsalted Ritz crackers to use to keep the salt content down.

I loved the crab stuffing.  Hubby devoured too.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars but I must admit that no recipe will live up to the crab stuffed lobster I had at the Paddock Restaurant in Hyannis.  I will be on the hunt for that forever!

So my husband and I are picky eaters, and he does not eat but three vegetables, period.  Therefore, I omitted the parsley and for fear of being too lemony, the lemon zest.  Otherwise, I used all the ingredients as suggested.  The only thing that kept me from giving this a five is that the thickest part of the lobster tail was undercooked.  My suggestion is to bake the tail 2 1/2-3 minutes, remove from oven and stuff, and then bake for the time suggested.  I would also suggest a jelly roll pan versus a cookie sheet, as I had to wipe out the excess butter from the bottom of my oven that melted during baking.

This was excellent! The only things I changed were using a cajun blend instead of a seafood blend of spices. As with another person it would be good to know what size lobsters, I used  small ones and still had an abundance of filling.

I made this dish for a friend and we both absolutely loved it! it was delicious and simple and has definitely been added to my list of go to recipes for special occasions. I added two cloves of garlic and added a dash more of the seafood seasoning (old bay) other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. I will most definitely make this again.

Ive made 3 times now.  Once I followed directions, it was amazing. Once I swapped black pepper for white n just used a little less,  I couldn't even tell a difference,  so it was amazing too! One other time I decided to try to add cheese to the stuffing and although we are avid cheese lovers,  it didn't taste as good. I highly recommend this recipe!  It has amazing flavor and isn't too lemony!

I used the crab topping on filets we made on the  grill.  The only substitution I had to make was using regular butter for clarified.  The final product was delicious, and everyone LOVED it.  We will be using this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing it!

The recipe was excellent,but I would use very large lobster tails as it made a lot of crab dressing. I put most of it in a casserole and froze to use later, maybe rolled in sole fillets. Highly recommend.

I made this last week and it was pretty good.  I'm a Mainer so lobster is something I'm very familiar with.  This is not my favorite way to eat it and it's no reflection on the recipe.  The stuffing was good and I would counsel to use good crabmeat and forget the salt.  The crackers themselves have salt so I found the finished stuffing too salty for my taste.  Definitely use a thermometer to check the lobster because it took longer than anticipated.

Outstanding, we will enjoy this dinner time and time again.  I did make a few changes.  I increased the garlic, added chopped green and red bell pepper, my favorite addition however, was cayenne pepper.  Also the suggestion to pre cook the lobster is spot on.

When you can’t get Valentine’s dinner reservations, this recipe is a great fallback and sure to impress your loved one.  I made this with filet mignon and a brocolli creamed risotto.  This was super easy and the star of this Valentine’s Day dinner.  My only tip is to add 3 or 4 minutes more in the oven (unless your oven runs hot).

It was good, but the Old Bay overpowered the taste of the whole dish and made it a little too salty.  Next time I make it, I think I will cut back on the Old Bay a little.  I also used bread crumbs that I lightly toasted with butter in the oven instead of the butter crackers.

This recipe was easy and my husband and I both enjoyed it.   The only suggestion would be the size of the lobster tails.  I got mine at Sam’s club and they were huge.  Had to cook them longer than the 12 minutes.  Getting the lobster meat to sit on top of the tail was the hardest part.  (Probably because I had t done it before).   Other than that the rest was easy and it tasted great.  Will definitely be making this again.

I'll make it again but this time I'll probably omit the zest other than that it is just fine for me.
