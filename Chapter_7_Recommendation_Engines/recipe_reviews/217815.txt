Not exactly like fajitas, more like a mix of fajitas and soft tacos. I did add a little more spices than what was called for (cumin, coriander, onion powder, garlic powder) but other than that, I did my best to stick to the recipe. This was enough to feed four (two grownups, two kids) when paired with mexican rice and refried beans. NO leftovers.

Was not sure since it was new and not that popular. However once we took a bite I was well satisfied. I ended up mixing the pepper and onion mixture in with the sauce and meat to simmer for 5 minutes and then served. This one is on my list. Thanks Heinz!

I liked it was easy to make and it turned out delicious. I didn't include the chili powder but the end result was yummy.
