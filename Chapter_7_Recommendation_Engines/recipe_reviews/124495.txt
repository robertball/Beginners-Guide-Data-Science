As written, this cake is bland and dry. However, when I modify it, it is fab. I follow the recipe to a T, except I always use 1/3 c. of applesauce + 2 T. of oil instead of using 1/2 c. of shortening and use 2t of cinnamon instead of 1 t. The applesauce and oil give the cake a moister texture, and lower the fat and calories at the same time! I also add a streusel on top. The recipe is as follows:  3/4 cup packed brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted and cooled 1/2 cup chopped walnuts  Mix the sugar, cinnamon, and walnuts in a bowl. Add the melted and cooled butter or margarine, and mix until smooth and somewhat pasty. Crumble on top of coffee cake mixture.   When done, the topping becomes crispy, crunchy, and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty coffe cake and easy to make. Because my husband doesn't like raisins I substituted dried blueberries instead. Thanks for the recipe!

After reading all of the promising reviews of this cake I was incredibly excited to make it for an office party! However, it was a completely disaster! I followed the directions to the "T" and not only didn't it have ANY flavor, but after a clean toothpick test, (which USUALLY means the cake is done) the cake was half raw and collapsed upon taking it out of the pan.  I was incredibly excited for this cake and if it had had a better flavor even half baked I would have tried it again, it really lacked flavor. Needless to say I won't be making this one again!

I read the reviews before making this I added 1 cup of apple sauce to the batter and 3 tsp. of cinnamon.  Was moist and just sweet enough the family loved it and has already asked when I will make it again.

It was really good and moist but rather crumbly!! I think next time I'll add more milk so the batter will be a bit less stiff. I used 1 granny smith apple and 1 red delicious apple and reduced the sugar slightly to 1 1/3 cups. Next time I'll add some cinnamon. Thank you for the recipe!!!
