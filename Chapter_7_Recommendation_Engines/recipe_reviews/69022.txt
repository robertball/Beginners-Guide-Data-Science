This was simple and good, my wife said it's her new favorite dish.I also doubled the egg, and added an Italian blend cheese w/5 min. of baking left. Now, for you people who like garlic, don't waste your money on garlic powder, granulated garlic is the ONLY way to go, this dosent have the fillers of powder, A much better taste, give it a try, you will love it.

This was really good and easy to make.  I did take others suggestions and double the butter/lemon mixture and double the mushrooms.  I will be adding this to my recipe book as a regular for meal time!

This was a very good dish and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys chicken, mushrooms and garlic. The only downfall is that it takes a bit of time preparing everything. Based upon previous reviews I made the following changes: used Italian herb bread crumbs instead of plain, added 4 minced garlic cloves to the mushrooms, served with fresh grated parmesan at time of serving. My friend and I both enjoyed the texture and overall taste of this dish. The calories aren't horrendous either (when served as a dinner meal). I recommend enjoying this dish with some steamed green beans. I plan on making this again.

Really Liked the way this turned out.  I did change a few things to suit our tastes.  I added crushed garlic to the butter and lemon juice mixture on the bottom of the pan.  I also baked as the recipe called for but added high moisture mozzarella cheese to top it for the last 5-7 minutes.  It turned out wonderful.  Can't wait to make this one again....thanks for the post.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! I did make a few changes suggested by other users. I doubled the egg mixture, bread crumb mixture and butter/lemon juice mixture, and it worked out great. I also added shredded mozzarella during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Make sure you use a meat thermometer...the chicken was done in 35 minutes. I think 45 minutes would have made the chicken too dry.

The chicken came out very moist and tender. I followed recipe exactly, but think I will make a few changes for next time. I will double the butter sauce (not very healthy I know) becaue it seems to cook down to nothing. I will add some garlic to the bottom of the pan as another user suggested and add some sun-dried tomoatos. It was very delicious as is though. It goes VERY well with the spinach and orzo salad from this site.

Since I made this the first time some months ago, it has been our favorite chicken dish.  I've served it to guests a number of times and cooked and served it in my motorhome.  I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe, but I do use boneless, skinless thighs more than breasts (as they are a preference in our house).  It is absolutely a delicious dish!!

Hubs and I really, really enjoyed this! I prepared this sticking reasonably close to the recipe except for using seasoned bread crumbs, more butter and lemon, and sprinkling the chicken with fresh dill along with the parsley. I also added some fresh garlic and shallots to the mushrooms. However, I knew the cooking time would be too long. More and more I'm seeing that chicken breasts vary in size, so the cooking time can only be a rough guide.  Mine were done at about 25 minutes. The chicken is tender and moist with great flavor.  Served with "Pasta with Swiss Chard," also from this site, this dinner was a hit.

The recipe was so easy to make and was totally delicious.  I, too, doubled the egg mixture because 1 egg did not appear to be enough.  My chicken was done in about 35 minutes and was perfect...45 minutes seems a little too long and may make the chicken dry.

Really good and easy! Next time though, I will add way more mushrooms and lemon butter mixture, cause the mushrooms shrink up so much. I served with rice and the Garlic Green Beans recipe on this site!

I've been making a similar, but simpler version of this recipe for years. It is a favorite with my family and with many guests, so I thought I'd at least mention the variation here: Dip the chicken breasts in olive oil, then in a mixture of half parmesan cheese and half Italian bread crumbs, then bake in a vegetable sprayed dish covered with foil. Remove the foil for the last five minutes of baking.  Chicken tenderloins may also be substituted for full breasts, just remember to reduce baking time.  That's it! Hope you enjoy.

Add microwaved potato for one dish meal. As a retired widower living alone, I always look for one dish meals. I reduce the recipe to serve one, and that leaves plenty of room in the baking pan. After the chicken goes into the oven, I nuke one potato, slice it lengthwise, and scoop out half the potato. Then fill the cavity with shredded cheddar and topped with bacon bits. The potato halves are added when there is 10 minutes to go that melts the cheese. Top that with sour cream and chives, and I have a simple and tasty one dish meal.

Holy moly this was great!  I did it a little different.  Sliced some red potatoes and layered them on top of the mushrooms, poured the butter mixture on top of those (used half the amount of butter).  Coated the chicken in the mixture and placed on top, then sprinkled remaining coating mixture on the entire thing.  Covered up with foil half way through (didnt want it to dry out - and the potatoes needed a little help cooking).  Anyway, it turned out FANTASTIC!  I will definately make this many more times.

Delicious! My hubby, who has been a chef for 20 yrs, said it's the best dinner he's had in a long time! I did take the advice of others & double the butter mixture. I also added fresh garlic & a little minced onion to it. Great!

This is very good. I scaled it down to 2 servings, and lightly browned the breaded chicken to make sure the coating wouldn't fall off during baking. (I always use Italian-seasoned bread crumbs so there was no need for the garlic powder -- though I did add some fresh grated Parmesan.) It was so moist and tender! I love the flavor of butter and lemon, and the mushrooms are a bonus. I will definitely make this again because it is very tasty, it's quick, and it's so easy that I don't even need to measure anything. Thank you, MaddieGail!

Wow! Mushroom-lovers: make this. It is delicious! The aroma that fills the house while this is in the oven is incredible! I only had 2 large chicken breasts, so I halved the recipe (everything except the egg). This chicken came out extremely moist & tender. The bread crumb crust is perfectly golden & crispy, but the absolute star of this dish HAS to be the mushrooms. If you like mushrooms like we do, you'll love this dish. We were fighting over the last spoonful! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I'll be making this again for sure! :)

Loved this recipe!! I only slightly altered it...I had to use 2 eggs, because I dip the chicken in the crumb mixture, then egg, then crumb mixture (plenty of crumbs for this recipe). I had 1 1/2 lbs of mushrooms, and I used a lot more butter because of the extra mushrooms. I even used the "sauce" that the mushrooms and butter made by pouring it over angel hair pasta, with some of the mushrooms. This is definately a keeper for my family. Thanks!

This was just okay.  I only had four breasts, but used the original amounts for the breading as listed, and just had enough.  The chicken was very moist, but almost too salty, and the crust was mushy.  I think next time I will brown the chicken a little first, and not pour the butter/lemon juice over the top.

We loved this.  I think this is our new favorite way to do chicken breasts. The recipe didnt look 5 stars, but it is.  Did mostly the same as listed, except a few modifications. added dried garlic flakes instead of the powder, few more bread crumbs & butter, 1 more egg, added another 1/2 lb mushrooms as we are huge mushroom fans, extra parsley, used plenty of fresh grated parmesan (1/2 c is nowhere near enough).  Baked covered loosely with foil until the last 15 min or so.  This baked up VERY moist; many of these chicken breast bakes do not.This recipe is delicious :)

This is similar to a recipe that came out in the early 80's when I was a new bride & became a favorite...no need for the egg, just dip the chicken in melted butter, roll in crumbs of your choice with the added parmesan & garlic. I put the chicken in the crock pot while I was working, when I got home added  chopped green onions & 1 cup white wine (or apple juice can be substituted, although I never did, so I can't vouch on the taste) I let it cook until I made the rice....which was the Campbells cream of chicken, can of water & a can of instant rice....which was ready in a few minutes......the chicken was always delicious, tender & the sauce over the rice was incredible.....a keeper even after all these years...,,try it..........

I'm giving this recipe a five because it's simple and it just makes you feel good. The tastes are perfect and no one flavor overpowers the other. This is great chicken to accompany pasta or veggies with marinara (I used zucchini and mushrooms). For an extra crispy breading, you can fry in butter on the stove. This recipe is awesome and I will definitely be making this regularly.

This was very good.  I doubled the mushrooms and sauce and I was glad I did.  I only coated the top side of my chicken with egg and crumbs because I was concerned the bottom would get mushy.  I baked mine for only 25-30 minutes, not the suggested 45.

I found this recipe to be exceptionally good and easy, which is always a plus in my book. I love to cook, but I'd prefer not to be in the kitchen all night to make a good weeknight meal. I cut the serving size down to two breasts and I butterflied those, so they cooked much quicker than the 45 minutes recommended in the recipe. Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe. I bet you could cut the butter a bit and still have great taste. Will definitely be making this again.

Very good recipe. Will add more mushrooms next time, also made about double the sauce as others recommended. Served with asparagus.

I just made this recently and my husband and FIL both loved it.  The aroma fills your kitchen and smells wonderful!  It's definitely a keeper, and I've already passed it on to my daughter:)  The only changes I made were to tenderize the chicken by pounding it out first and I doubled the mushrooms and the butter as I had more chicken than called for in the recipe.  Oh, yeah I used minced garlic in the pan instead of garlic powder.  MMMMMM....

Excellent recipe! I pounded the breasts down a bit and only baked for 30 minutes. Also followed suggestion to add hot sauce to egg mixture and extra garlic to butter and mushrooms. I topped with shredded asagio cheese before baking. Delish!!!

Saw this recipe this morning and made it for Sunday dinner. m My son-in-law loved it and ate two pieces - I also made Rice a Roni Creamy Italian Rice and fresh green beans with a garlic parmesan dressing.  Made a jello salad and blue berry pie for desert.  Yum Yum - I doubled the butter and lemon juice in the sauce and garnished with lemon slices

Very pleasantly surprised with this! Very easy, moist and great lemon flavor. I make my own ww seasoned bread crumbs. I forgot the parm, so I sprinkled it on towards the end. Husband raved about this! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is an awesome dish!!  One thing I did do.. I was pouring a glass of Chardonnay and I put a splash in the butter/lemon sauce.  This dish is great, will put it in rotation.

Very tender and tasty.  Laziness led me to line the pan with foil for easy cleanup.  Following the advice of previous reviewers (love reviewers!), doubled the egg and butter mixes.  Did not double the bread crumb(used Italian)/cheese mix and had a lot leftover of that, so am glad for restraint there.  Himself does not eat mushrooms, so used none, but may next time - would be easy to pick them out.  At least doubled the granulated garlic.  Used boneless skinless thighs and they were done in 30 minutes.  Thanks, Maddiegail, for a new, tasty and easy idea for chicken!

My husband and I both liked it, but I have to give it only 3 stars because my 2 kids wouldn't. Also, if I made this again, I would cut down to 1/2 cup bread crumbs mixed with 1/4 cup parm to reduce waste since I had a ton of the mixture left over.

Yum! I agree with others: at least double the mushrooms--they are delicious, but they shrink a lot. I also liked doing a lemon-butter-garlic sauce in the bottom of the pan.  Thank you for the recipe!

Tried this with two chicken breasts, layered on top of frozen artichoke hearts.  After finished time they were great!  Used leftovers on Ciabatta bread with remaining artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, and shredded mozarella.  A thing of beauty!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a fast and yummy dinner! I have made many times for tb family and company alike and always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. After making this recipe as written a few times, I now almost always double the amount of butter and lemon which makes a really nice sauce. I serve over angel hair pasta, add a side salad, steamed broccoli, and fresh bread - VOILA! Dinner done. Enjoy!!
UPDATE: Have made this identical recipe substituting pork chops for the chicken, and it is equally as delicious (if not more so!!)

WONDERFUL as stated.  I will double the butter, etc next time .   My friend makes a similar dish by filling the breast with fresh cracked pepper & garlic sea salt, wrapping the breasts in phyllo sheets & baking.  She serves the sauce & mushrooms on the side.  THANKS!!!

This was GREAT!  I used both italian bread crumbs and panco since that is what I had on hand. As another said I also put the leftover crumbs on top of the chicken. The mushrooms were very good. The chicken was moist and tender.

Instead of egg, I soak the chicken in buttermilk(vinegar and milk) at least 30 mins, then lift out of liquid and let drain a moment and then dip in dry mixture.  Putting the remainder of crumbs on top after dipping all pieces of chicken.   I use crisp rice cereal instead of breadcrumbs(what was available) and add some french fried dried onions, crushed, for more flavor.  Hope that helps you.  I also have egg allergies as well as garlic so it takes some thinking on modifying to keep flavor.  We love this recipe as a family.  I am rating this a five though I have made changes just because I use to be able to make as is before getting allergies and it is wonderful.

I did what other reviewers said and doubled the mushrooms and sauce and added minced garlic, glad I did.  My family really liked this dish, it did have a restaurant taste to it.  I served over mashed potatoes.  Next time I will add artichokes hearts and serve over angel hair pasta or linguine.  Thanks for a new yummy recipe.

Absolutely loved this!!! My husband said it tasted like something he would order at a restaurant!!  I did what others said and doubled the butter mixture and I only cooked the chicken for 35 minutes.  Added some shredded italian cheese at the end and switched the oven to broil to make the bread crumbs a little crispy.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed some of the other reviews suggestions.  I doubled the butter/lemon also and I also doubled the mushrooms.  The Italian bread crumbs are a must.  I added alot more garlic. I used 1 1/2 tsp. garlic with the bread crumb mixture. I also used 4 minced garlic cloves as another reader had suggested.  I might add a little bit more next time.  I served this dish over angel hair pasta.  I also made breadsticks and a green salad to go along with it.  Very Good!  Thanks for the recipe.  It is a keeper.

Really outstanding!  The mushrooms came out so divinely!  The only thing I would consider changing in the future is to pound the chicken thinner.  But with the shorter cooking time, I'm not sure if the mushrooms would end up so perfect.  If I get brave enough to try it, I'll update!  Thanks for the delightful recipe!

Took a hint from others about potential flavor blandness. I increased the butter to 6 Tbsps and added 2 tablespoons of Louisiana Hot Sauce to the Lemon/Butter sauce. I also seasoned the chicken breasts, prior to the egg dip, with fresh ground sea salt and pepper. Lastly, in addition to the Lemon/Butter/Hot Sauce Sauce and parsley, I topped the breaded chicken breasts with grated parmesan cheese and a VERY light sprinkling of Konriko Creole Seasoning. This put a little BAM in Grandmas Chicken Chardon. Thanks for sharing a great recipe; it will be a regular at our table!

I really enjoyed this recipe - simple to prepare and great taste.  I used boneless chicken thighs, doubled the mushrooms and lemon butter sauce, added garlic and served with an orzo dish and salad.  Husband kept commenting on how GOOD this was.

I love this chicken! It came out moist and very flavorful. It was delicious hot right out of the oven, and cold the next day over a salad. The only change I made was instead of the garlic powder I added one minced clove of garlic to the melted butter and lemon juice in the bottem of the pan. A great chicken recipe!!!

This was absolutely delicious and the chicken was very juicy.  I used Italian Herb bread crumbs and for the butter I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and it was a hit, my husband could not even taste the lemon.  This is a keeper and will make this often.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  P.S.  The leftovers are to die for.

I followed the suggestions and doubled the egg mixture.  Rather than salt, I used  Himalayan pink salt gourmet mix that I got at Home Goods and still added pepper.  I used the Italian breadcrumbs and started with less and added more as needed.  No clumps that way.  I still added garlic powder and that was fine.  Fresh off the tree lemon used. I cut the chicken breasts into half strips so there was no huge pieces to cook through. Finally, I topped with real parmesan cheese.  My family ate it up!   Served with fresh green bean almandine.  Top marks!

I used a mix of mushrooms that I picked up already packaged in the store and my husband loved the mushrooms. We liked the chicken also, had a nice taste that was different from regular ol' baked chicken. Will make this again but double the mushrooms for DH.

This was excellent. Like other reviewers, I doubled the mushrooms and at more than doubled the butter/lemon sauce. I only cooked it for about 30 minutes and it was perfect!

I made this low carb by substituting almond meal for the bread crumbs.  Super tasty chicken and even better mushrooms.  Will definitely make again.

The mushrooms in this were out of this world tasty!  For us, the combination of the butter (used I can't believe its not butter light) and lemon (just squeezed one lemon and didn't measure) really worked.  The seasoning on the chicken was only about a 4 for us, but that could be because the chicken breasts I used were huge.  Next time I'll season the chicken more.  We are mushroom lovers and I used the whole pound of mushrooms with 4 breasts.  Definitely easy to throw together and different - very nice change of pace for boring old chicken breasts.

Made it just as directed except used 5 chicken breasts instead of 8 - and kept all other ingredients the same measurement. Used Progresso italian style bread crumbs. SO GOOD! And you don't feel TOO guilty eating it because it's baked not fried.  Thank you for the recipe!

Easy and delicious.. I used garlic salt in place of salt; used 1/2 the amount of crumbs and Parmesan cheese. I used Italian flavored bread crumbs. So good -- you could serve it to your own Grandma.

I rated a 5 because my chicken came out perfect and moist which has been hard for me to do in the oven. I didn't have mushrooms, so I sub sliced squash and zucchini which worked well. Also doubled the sauce. You can tweek this recipe into more if you wanted which I think is great in a recipe.

Agreed!  This is delicious.  My husband called it "gourmet."  Sooo easy for such wonderful flavor.  The mushrooms really do absorb all the yumminess.  I substituted lemon pepper for lemon juice because I didn't have any and it was still so good.  Next time real lemon juice.  Oh yeah I put quartered red potatoes along side and made for a great meal.  Thanks!!

This has gone into my regular rotation. It's a great weeknight dish which I can easily put together in the AM and throw in the oven at the end of the day. I like the sauce that is generated by the lemon, butter and mushroom combination. And yet, it's easy to de-mushroom it for those who don't like them. My kids, husband and I all really like it. Great dish for a working family!

Great recipe, Grandma really does know what she is doing, I followed the whole thing to a T except added and extra Tbs or lemon juice just for a bit extra tartness. It was so easy and fast to prepare and a favorite for the family. I have made this a few times, and there are never any leftovers. Try this and you will not be dissapointed

This is the ONLY way I bake chicken breasts now and it is the only recipe I've found that actually makes a moist chicken breast.  My husband insists that I make this often -- and both of us are dark meat chicken eaters!  I have passed this recipe on several times.

This was a hit!  My changes were:  I pounded the chicken breasts first and I left out the garlic powder and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs as some other reviewers did.  I didn't have any mushrooms, so I used a package of frozen spinach as the bottom layer - terrific!  Easy to prepare, nice presentation, chicken comes out nice & tender.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe last night and I will definitely make it again!! It was VERY good. I added shredded Italian cheese on top. One thing I will do next time is marinate the beasts in an Italian-style marinade to give the chicken more flavor. VERY good recipe! Thanks! UPDATE:  I again made this recipe but marinated the chicken in a marinade I found on this site.  It's called "Garlic and Herb Marinade", and it added TONS of flavor to the chicken.  Both recipes are definite keepers!!!  Yum!!!!!

This is the best chicken recipe ever!!!  I did use crushed cornflakes rather than bread crumbs, dried minced garlic rather than garlic powder and omitted the mushrooms.  My husband and both absolutely loved it.  It's a real keeper!!!

Loved this! As some suggested, I halved the amount of chicken. I also added 1/4 cup of white wine to make a bit more sauce, then assembled as instructed. Then I topped each breast with a slice of bacon that I cut in half and layered over the top and sprinkled more Parmesan cheese on top. The last five minutes, turned up the heat to 450 to get it crispy. It was wonderful! Served it over spinach pasta and with green beans almondine.

Made this for dinner tonight. I was a huge hit. I used olive oil instead of butter. Also used an herb and spice combo instead of garlic powder. (I can't have garlic.) I didn't find the chicken dry or too done at 45 minutes, but I did have very thick chicken breasts (2 inches perhaps even 2 1/2 inches). They browned nicely and weren't soggy either. I used a Meyer's lemon instead of a regular one. This was delicious and everyone like it. I'll be making it again.

I just made this for dinner and it was sooooo good!  I followed the recipe as written, but you need to pay attention to the amounts in the ingredient section if you change it to 4 servings or else you'll end up putting in two teaspoons of garlic powder instead of one!  I didn't put any mushrooms in and it was still yummy! Will definitely make this again and it's even good enough for company. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe :)

I was looking for a different way to make chicken thighs and I tried this one. IT WAS GREAT! My 21 month old son ate one all by himself! And my husband keeps asking me when I'm going to cook them again!
Thanks!

Baked chicken can be very "blah" at times without any real flavor.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this recipe was very flavorful and my husband and I enjoyed it very much.  I know I will make this recipe again!

Very moist & fork tender.  'Think I would like more spices though.  More lemon flavor would be good as well.

Very good choice for the family rotation. I agree with others that the cooking time is a bit too long and doubling the egg and the butter/lemon is a great idea. I butterflied my chicken breasts so cut the time down significantly. Don't skip the mushrooms...they are the best part!

My sister-in-law thought she came over for a gourmet meal when she tasted this dish.  It was fast, easy, but most importantly beautiful and delicious!  I used shaved parmesan cheese instead of grated which made it even better.  Bon appetite!

Used crushed ritz crackers with garlic and onion powder, pepper and lemon zest to coat chicken. Skipped the parmasean cheese. Lightly browned chicken before baking and spooned a little of butter mixture over chicken before baking. Added extra mushrooms but only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter with lemon juice and chopped garlic.   served with broccoli and side salad. Very tasty.

This recipe was amazing!!! I couldn't stop  eating it. It's super easy!! I used thinly sliced chicken breasts -cooked within 25 minutes. I would recommend not using a lot of the butter lemon mixture on the top of the chicken because it made it a little soggy. But overall it was great will definitiely be making this more often!

Chicken didn't have much flavor, the bottom of the chicken was soggy and the mushrooms were just ok. I didn't make modifications so as written it was just not good. Seriously disappointed.

This is GREAT!! I did double the mushroom amount as they shrink a lot and I also doubled, but might triple next time, the butter and lemon sauce. My family devoured it will make for many dinners to come.

I loved this!  I can't believe I didn't make it sooner...I followed as it said except I cut down on the garlic powder since I'm not that much of a garlic fan plus I was already using bread crumbs that were of garlic & herb...my mushrooms were a bit burn, but that could have been b/c i sliced them thin?  Either way this meal came out sooo delicious!  I can't wait to make this for my friends...

I'd like to rate this based on the recipe as is but I couldn't help myself and adapted it my own way.... I cut up a whole chicken and used the carcass to make a quick stock, while I marinated the chicken and spices in buttermilk in the fridge for a couple of hours.  After the stock was ready, I spread out 2 cups of rice in a baking dish, and layered the sliced mushrooms onto that. I gently poured in 4 cups of chicken stock so not to disturb the layers. I used the bread crumb mixture to coat the chicken pieces  and gently placed them on top of the layers in the dish and put it all in the oven. While it was cooking I made my new favorite, creamy sage butter sauce (if your interested it's on the site) and gently poured that over the rice and chicken in the last 10 or 15 minutes of baking. I would say the sauce wasn't necessary because the rice and chicken turned out so perfect, but the sage went really well with all the flavors! It took some time, but I would make this again in a heartbeat! I added a picture of it out of the oven.

This is delicious.   I did make a few changes. I used boneless pork chops and crushed garlic croutons in the place of bread crumbs or you can use a mixture of both and of course double the butter mixture and add more mushrooms.   Everyone I have prepared this for loves it.

This was fantastic. I made it exactly as written except for using canned mushrooms (I didn't have fresh on hand). It was delicious. My husband even said so, and he can be very picky. I have shared this with several people so that they can enjoy it as well. Thanks.

I made this last night and it was delicious! I too doubled the egg mixture and I baked this for 35 minutes at 350.  I added some Cajun spice and minced garlic to the butter mixture along with Montreal chicken seasoning-it was a huge hit! Thanks for sharing

Followed exactly, very tasty, especially since we love mushrooms.  Used "baby bella" mushrooms.
Quick and easy to make, and clean up was quick too!  Will definatly make again, may add more garlic seasoning and more lemon, but we enjoyed it just as written.  Thanks for sharing!

Both my husband & I liked this recipe.  I did stay with the original amounts of everything ,but the chicken   I scaled back on that.  I ,also, used gluten free  panko bread crumbs.  I'm gluten free.  It all worked out great.  Thanks, for the recipe.

Fabulous! Easy and elegant. I added artichoke hearts on top of the mushrooms. Like others made more sauce and used juice of a whole lemon, since I love lemon. Cooked it 30 minutes and turned oven off and left 5 more minutes. Perfect and Scrumptious. I plan to add some white wine to the lemon/butter sauce next time.

This was excellent and easy.  The only changes I made was use 2 eggs and about another tsp of garlic powder in the egg mixture.  One egg was not enough for the 6 chicken cutlets I was making. Then at the end of cooking the last 5 minutes I put it on broil (high) to crisp the top of the chicken. This is definitely a recipe for dinner guests.

I was sooooo tired of naked chicken!  This was a welcome change!  I used whole wheat bread to make my crumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe.  We did not use the pan sauce, so I saved a few calories there!  The mushrooms were delectable, and DH and DS loved the chicken.  The side dish was green beans with sliced almonds, a nice crunchy complement to the chicken.  Will make this again!

this is awesome! fancy for company but easy enough for a weekday meal. I used Italian bread crumbs so I omitted the parmesan, used garlic powder and pepper to season. I added 1 tbsp minced garlic to the butter and lemon juice, delicious, my son wanted to drink the drippings :)

I cut this down to four servings. I added a half teaspoon of dried basil, a teaspoon of onion powder and a teaspoon of dried oregano to my breading. This was a pretty dish that would have been a little bland had I not added the extra spices. I think the mushrooms were the best part.

This was delicious & a nice change from the way I usually do baked chicken! My hubby was a little unsure about this one but it turned out great! I followed the recipe mostly with a few minor changes. I had 4 thin chicken breasts & I felt that the amount of lemon butter was not enough for 4 so I could only imagine if I actually had 8! So I doubled it. Then instead of using mushrooms I cut up 3 potatoes into small cubes & used that instead because I didn't have mushrooms on hand. I honestly think the potatoes went wonderfully with this dish...much better than mushrooms would have & I do love mushrooms! They complimented the dish really well & were actually my favorite part!! They crisp up nicely & tasted fantastic! My only complaint which was my fault is I cooked the chicken for 45 min & that was a bit too much as they were somewhat dry, but still not bad & tasted good! Next time I make this I will cook it for less & maybe even add mushrooms, onions & potatoes I think that would be great! Thanks for the quick easy & great tasting recipe :)

We’ve never had much success with skinless boneless chicken breasts.  It either turns out too dry or just doesn’t taste that good.  This time, the chicken was fully cooked but still nice and moist, not to mention tasty.  I adjusted the recipe for 3 breasts and used a slightly smaller baking dish.  There was plenty for the two of us with enough left for a third person, a snack later, or second helpings.  We chose the latter and split the last piece.  This dish served with egg noodles and green beans made for a pleasant and filling meal.  I think that the fresh mushrooms are a nice touch and adds flavor to the dish as well.  The recipe was easy to make with minimal prep time involved.  We’re pleased to add it to our list of keepers.

Outstanding and easy!  I used smashed up garlic "bagel bites" for my bread crumbs and it was delicious.  The coating was more crunchy.

Mmmm good!  I took other reviewer's advice - used Italian bread crumbs, doubled the butter and lemon juice mixture and added minced garlic to it and topped the chicken with part-skim mozzarella for the last 10 minutes.  Hubby and I both enjoyed this a lot, great with roasted veggies (potatoes, carrots and red onions).  Thanks!

This recipe gets "the Best!", 5 stars from me because it takes care of all my needs. First, the Nutrition Information is just perfect for our diet needs, second; it is delicious, third; easy to prepare and I followed the recipe as written, except for adding 1 additional egg. Thanks MADDIEGAIL for sharing, this goes with 'the keepers'.

VERY similar to Papa Vino's Chicken Scallopini... Usually I don't mess with a recipe, the first time... But I soon realized how close this was to one of our restaurant favs and added a tablespoon of package pre-cooked bacon... Bingo! Now I have to figure out how to make more sauce for the angle hair... thanks MADDIEGAIL

This was very good.  Lots of flavor and nice and moist.   I took some advice here in the comments and melted a slice of provolone on each chicken breast just before it was finished.   Mighty good eats!

Great recipe. I used Italian style bread crumbs instead of the plain ones and garlic powder. Next time I think I will turn mushrooms and butter into a pan sauce after the chicken is cooked.

I have made this twice now and both times it's been a HUGE success.  I also pound the chicken breasts down and double the sauce/garlic as suggested.  This chicken is so easy to make and a big request in my house.

I made this in two separate baking dishes, one with mushrooms, one without. My boyfriend ate the one with the mushrooms and he loved it. I ate the one without and it was delicious. The most juicy, flavorful chicken I've ever eaten. We will definately have this again!

Fanstastic recipe. This was so delicious. Even my husband raved over this. The chicken came out so moist and tender. And the flavor was fantasic. I had one small piece of chicken that fell off one of the breasts and I breaded and cooked it anyway. Oh my gosh--it almost melted in my mouth. The only thing I will do differently next time is to use chicken tenders to get that same tecture.

This was PHENOMENAL... I'm eating it now and oh my goodness, I am in love! I did like others and kicked it up a notch with some hot sauce in the eggs, and full batch of the butter/lemon... wow is it good. This is a new favorite. FANTASTIC.

Great tasting and very easy. The mushrooms were delicious so I would , as other's have suggested, use more mushrooms than the recipe calls for. I cut my chicken in to nice sized strips, otherwise perfect the way it is.

Wonderful recipe...I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing, added a couple fresh cloves of garlic, and stuck with the original amount of mushrooms and butter/lemon juic mix.  These amendments made for a very flavorful and moist chicken dish.

A MUST TRY! I Just LOVED this, and so did my husband. I only used 4 chicken breasts but didn't cut the recipe in half, which worked perfect! I used all of the (italian) bread crumb mixture on the 4 breasts which gave them a nice crispy coating.  Next time i will use a lot more mushrooms! You gotta try this!

This is a very flavorful recipe.  It was quick and easy but I didn't like that the bottom of the chicken was soggy from cooking on top of the buttered mushrooms.  I will make it again but will saute my mushrooms separately.

Quick & easy - this was really good! The chicken stays nice & moist. I served with steamed green beans and a loaf of crusty French bread to sop up the juices!

This recipe turned out pretty well. It was a nice variation.  I also added a little mozarella on top. I would say add more mushrooms if you like them a lot. I didn't add more and it was fine. My husband said it was just "ok" but then asked for seconds and thirds! :) You can also change this one up a bit and turn it into chicken parmesean by leaving out the mushrooms and lemon/butter sauce; and by adding a tomatoe based sauce with more garlic!

Tripled sauce! Even then, plus adding more spices and flavorings,  it was sorta just dry and boring.

Very simple and easy.  My girls loved it.  I did add another egg, more bread crumbs, used fresh garlic and some white wine to the sauce.  Nothing else and we loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Boyfriend loved the meal. 
I did modify the recipe. 
I only made it with four chicken breasts and had just enough coating, if you use more chicken you will need more breading and egg.
I added more mushrooms because of shrinkage. 
Reduce the cooking time! I would say no more than 35 minutes to yield juicy, tender meat. 
Before serving I sprinkled on sliced scallions.

Quite possibly the best baked chicken I've ever made....super moist and flavorful. I would like to double the mushrooms next time and took the advice of others and doubled the butter/lemon mixture. I served it with asparagus. Yum!!!

Basically made this exactly as directed except used olive oil in 9x12 Pyrex dish and then added smart balance instead of butter on to, just avoid using so much butter.

I made this according to the recipe and it was good (used Panko breadcrumbs). However, when fixing the left-overs the next day, I made some changes. The bottom of the chicken was VERY soggy, so I flipped them over and baked at 375 for 15 min. then turned the broiler on for 2-3 min. They did crisp up, so I added straight parmesan cheese (the real stuff, not the canister) and put it back in the oven for another minute to melt. I sautéed the mushrooms in white wine (and just a smidgen of butter). I think the left-overs were much better than the first night. Not sure I would make this again, but it was pretty easy to throw together so I might, but will probably do the mushrooms separately since the soggy bottom was pretty gross.

I used fewer chicken breasts and Panko instead of regular breadcrumbs, because I usually prefer a crispier crust. The recipe was okay, but pretty bland. If I were to do it over, I'd pour half of the butter and lemon mix on top of the chicken, rather than just 1/3. I'd also use more salt than I typically do (I ended up added quite a bit after it was cooked.) It was definitely juicy. I think with a few additional herbs and/or spices (eg: Italian bread crumbs; garlic salt)I'd like it a lot more.

Great recipe! All in the family loved it!  I made without the mushrooms because some in the family don't like them,  still came out great.  Recipe also gives you a great starter base so that you can switch out spices etc. to change it up a bit. Loved it!

Loved it; however, I made changes on first time try based on reviews: tasteless & not crisp.  Turned out great.  Here are my changes...

1. 2 lg cloves of crushed garlic instead of powdered with beaten egg. As suggested by another reviewer, and no salt added, just pepper.
2. 1 cup breadcrumbs (roasted garlic crumbs) was too much, changed to 3/4 and that was still too much for 2 breasts, 29 ozs total, sliced into large sections. less than 1/4 cup parm cheese added to crumbs to balance smaller amount.
3. Used two 8 oz cans of mushrooms, could have used 4, fresh would be better even tho the canned didn't burn and tasted great - just not enough mushrooms for us.
4. Biggest change - we are not particularly fond of lemon - used a TBS. Italian Low Fat salad dressing mixed with the butter and it was excellent!
5. Baked chicken longer - until the breading felt crispy to the touch - the chicken did not dry out (even though they were slice big breasts).
6. At end, Put into the broiler Lo setting for about 5 min. to brown the crust then sprinkled mozzarella on top to melt as suggested by other readers.

Came out moist (did not space the chicken apart, but lay them touching) and crisp crusty on top and the mushrooms were yummy as was the chicken.  This recipe is now in my keeper book!  Love it!

Definitely double the portion for butter and mushrooms!  I think it could have used more lemon but my 11 yr old said it was too lemony.  It has the flavor in the background not as a forward flavor.  Butter was a little heavy with it doubled but I was not complaining.  ")

Used a whole stick of butter and fresh lemon, at least 2 tblsp.   Fresh garlic in the melting butter, and herbed breadcrumbs.  Also fresh grated parmesan!  This is fabulous!

Yummy was so good, the chicken so moist. The only thing I did different was added more butter, lemon juice to bottom of glass dish, used can of mushrooms. I will be making this again, my family is looking forward to it.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and increased the butter by 50% and it came out great. I only had chicken cutlets in the house and think that breasts would have been better. The smaller cuts didn't brown as well.

My hubby couldn't get enough of this. No leftovers! This will be a regular part of our dinner rotation. I made as directed, with the exception of using chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and baked for about 25 minutes. This was absolutely delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Maybe the chickens around here are big - but 8 breast halves in a 13x9 baking dish?  No way the bread crumb mixture could have worked for that much chicken either.  So I used 4, pounded them a little for even cooking, and kept all of the other ingredients the same instead of doubling the mushrooms/sauce like so many others did (with barely any waste of bread crumbs). This was a fairly easy meal to make and the end result was really good!  I do think that next time, I'd like to taste more lemon, so I'll increase that just a little.  I love chicken and mushrooms together, will definitely make this again - thanks for sharing!

Delicious and easy (two of my favorite combinations).  I did double the egg as suggested by another reviewer.  I also used about 1/2 cup more bread crumbs.  I would even consider doubling he mushrooms, because they cook down a lot and they are sooooo tasty.

So yummy!  I followed the advice of other posters and doubled the amount of mushrooms and butter/lemon mix.  I also added a little fresh minced garlic to the mushrooms and the butter.  I served it with rice and fresh broccoli.  My family LOVED this meal!

5 stars for taste and simplicity.  Made for the two of us, but used 1/2 pound mushrooms and most of the sauce.  Only cooked 35 minutes as recommended by others.  This was good!

This was good but I feel like the proportions of the recipe were a little off.  I halved the recipe and I still needed more egg and had way too much crumb mixture.  I would have halved the bread crumbs and parm again. The recipe is a yummy start - especially the mushrooms, they were fantastic. Next time I will add lots more garlic and maybe some cayenne to give it some zing.  I will definitely back off on the butter and use chicken broth instead.  The lemony flavor of the mushrooms was great!

Love this recipe. I always double or triple the mushrooms, add about 2 cloves of fresh pressed garlic to the mushrooms and sometimes add a T. of dijon mustard. I use garlic and herb seasoned breadcrumbs that I mix with a little olive oil. I cover the chicken with foil for half the baking time. This turns out so moist and delicious everytime.

Doubled the mushrooms and added a few chopped onions . Next time will add some red peppers for color and flavor. So easy and chicken stayed moist.  It tasted great the next day for lunch too.  The mushroom base provided a base for the chicken to cook but not burn and dry out but still looked decent.  Will try with panko bread crumbs next time.

My husband said the mushrooms make the dish and he was right. I halved the recipe and doubled the butter sauce, but not the mushrooms..next time I will. I used Butter Buds liquid substitute(couldn't tell the difference between that and melted butter but zero calories) and added chopped garlic to the liquid. It was delicious and will be added to my favorites file

This recipe is very tasty. I thought the lemon would be overpowering but it is fresh and tangy. The chicken was moist and had a wonderful taste. I will make again.

Great recipe with great flavours. My husband loved it so that counts for a lot becuase he is very picky. I did follow some of the others advice and doubled the egg etc.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is so delicious!  I had to modify it a bit to suit my dietary needs, but I followed the quantities as suggested.  

I am wheat intolerant, so I had to find a substitute for the bread crumbs.  So what I did was crush up Crispix cereal and use it in lieu of the bread crumbs.

The other change I made was instead of setting it on a bed of mushrooms, I cut up a bunch of new potatoes and baked the chicken over potatoes.  I am not really a fan of mushrooms, so I was looking for something else to use.  I cut the potatoes into 1/2" thick circles and layed them on the bottom of the pan.  They came out so flavorful and baked just right.  They are a nice addition to the chicken.

All in all, this recipe was excellent and I will definitely be making it again.  Aside from those (2) alterations, I followed the recipe exactly.

This was amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly and both my husband and I give it 5 stars.  We are not typically "just a piece of chicken on a plate" kind of people, but the addition of the mushrooms gives a bit of a gourmet feel.  I paired it with sauteed fresh green beans/red onion and it was the perfect comfort meal for a cold winter night.

This was fabulous !! My 14 year old hates mushrooms but boy did she scoop these up !! I used chicken legs and it turned out so yummy. The chicken was tender and the outside was crispy.(Ok not the side next to the mushrooms). Kids took the leftovers to school and their friends ate them before she could get any. Any time teenagers ooooo and ahhhh ~ gets my vote everytime !!  THANKS

This was wonderful. My husband whom doesn't like chicken even loved it. Chicken was so moist. I did tweak a bit added 2 tsp. McCormick's Grill mates montreal chicken seasoning to "italian" bread crumb mixture.  I also used 2 Tbs fresh lemon juice and sauted sliced mushrooms in lemon jc,butter mixture with 3 Tbs white wine for 5 mins. before spooning into bottom of baking dish. I will definately make again but may marinate chicken night before  and add a dash of onion pwr to bread crumb mixture for a bit more flavor.

Made this last night with only changing to Italian seasoned crumbs.  We liked it a lot and plan to make again - maybe next time I'll add some onions slices in with the mushrooms.
Simple & Great recipe - Thanks!

Great taste and easy to make but I found the recommended 45 minutes (4 chicken breasts) to be a bit too long.  I think 35 minutes would have done the trick.   Short of that, for a non-cook, this is a winner.

This was delicious!  I did what others did and doubled the sauce.  I also grated in one clove of garlic.  For the breadcrumbs I only had a little bit of garlic seasoned bread crumbs so I added some Panko crumbs too.  I also subbed garlic salt for the garlic powder.  Did not have any mushrooms so left those out but I can only imagine how much better this dish would be with them.  Yummo!

This is one that if I could give it more stars, I would! I doubled the 'sauce' and added to it a large clove of microplaned garlic, which gave this a wonderful flavor. This recipe produced flavorful, tender and juicy chicken. Definately good enough for company, and couldn't be easier. This will be going into our rotation for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Whoa, this was delicious.  Went a step further and marinated chicken in a combination of balsamic vinegar, chicken seasoning, and olive oil for about 3 hours.  I also doubled the butter and lemon juice combination.  Very very moist

Simply Fantastic!! The only changes I made were to cut down the garlic powder to 1/2Tsp and I used Italian style bread crumbs. Had no fresh mushrooms on hand so I used 2 cans of mushrooms. My daughter RAVED about this recipe!! Thanks so much. Will definitely be making again!!!!!

Oh man this was good! I doubled the egg, butter/lemon mixture, and used italian herb breadcrumbs. It only took 35 min for the chicken to cook, so you need to watch it. I added mozzerella on a few of the chicken breasts in the last 5 min of cooking so we could have a mix of both. Next time I will double the mushrooms and triple the butter mix, as we wanted more of both. Will definately make again!

I liked this recipe because it was simple, quick, and tasted good.  I don't know if I would do it the same way because I was looking for a more cheesier taste.

Made this at a casual dinner get together and it got great reviews and it was really simple to make. Used 2 eggs instead of 1 and italian bread crumbs. Also doubled up the butter/lemon mixture since seemed dry. Will be making again for sure.

We really liked this recipe.  I used Italian bread crumbs and made a little bit more of the lemon butter sauce for drizzling over the chicken breasts.  I ended up using 4 chicken breasts (Costco-size), pounded flat, and still had to increase the cooking time (an additional 25 min. @ 400)

This recipe is a good start for something great but it's not there yet. Even though I actually added a little extra lemon juice and Parmesan, I thought the chicken lacked a little flavor. The mushrooms are right on track though. At the very least, I'd marinate the chicken to start with and then add 1/2 tsp sugar to the egg mix next time. The sugar will brighten the flavors. But to really kick it up, I'm going to try eliminating the lemon all together next time and adding a pecan glaze at the end. That should take this "mom's recipe" to "gourmet recipe". The blend of mushrooms, pecans, slightly sweet should be great.

This was very good and easy. My daughter wants me to make it for our church Wednesday night dinner. I made some extra pieces because the size of the package of chicken had more pieces. When it was cool I sliced it and put them on biscuits the next morning. They were delicious.

I have been told that I am a very good cook. I must say that this recipe is delicious. As the flavors of the butter,lemon,mushrooms and chicken slowly bake together they form the perfect taste. One that I would expect to taste at a fine restaurant. The only small changes that I made were, I added sliced fresh garlic to the mushrooms. I used less lemon, about 1 tbsp. And I added fresh, chopped Basil with the parsley. My compliments to chef Maddiegail!! ;)

I don't review a lot of recipes but I felt I had to for this one. My extremely fussy family of 5 ALL loved this dish and will actually eat it again! I also doubled the egg to 2 and cooked it for the whole 45 minutes and the chicken was very moist.  Thank you MADDIEGAIL for an excellent recipe.

This was fantastic, even though I made a couple of mistakes.  I forgot the Parm and Parsley.  Used Honey Panko Japanese Bread crumbs I had left from another meal. Followed advice to double garlic, butter (smart balance margarine)and lemon juice.  We loved it, but next time I will try to do it correctly.

I loved this recipe. The only changes I made were: doubled the lemon/butter, used Italian Bread crumbs, and portobellow mushrooms. I served it with Orzo sundried Tomato & Spinach pasta and grilled Parmesan asparagus. Dish pesented beautifully! Thanks for sharing.

This was just okay for me. I cooked it according to the recipe, but the breading seemed way to wet which made it seem like it wasn't done. The chicken was very moist, but the flavor was somewhat bland.

Awesome! Thanks so much for this recipe. It's simple and it's so rewarding! I'm definitely making this again. I didn't have fresh parsley and I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and it still came out delish. The mushrooms are so yummy and the chicken is so flavorful. Note: check your cooking time with the thickness of your chicken breasts (mine took only 30 minutes and were juicy and perfect).

EXCELLENT combination of flavors!  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and doubled the butter, lemon and mushrooms, plus added minced garlic cloves to the mushrooms (I used 4 cloves for 4 servings, but I LOVE garlic!).  Right before serving, sprinkle some more parm cheese and lemon juice on the chicken.  YUM!!!

This recipe was awesome! Certainly a must try!!! I did make some changes though, I used Italian Bread crumbs, and I also had to use 3 eggs instead of one. I added minced garlic to the lemmon/butter sauce, which i tripled (1/3 in the bottom on the pan, 1/3 over the mushrooms b/c I multi-layered them, and 1/3 over the chicken breasts.) I used the thin sliced chicken breasts from Tyson...they were extra crsipy, but still juicy this way. I double dipped the chicken (egg, bread crumbs, egg again, bread crumbs again) and it gave it a nice thick breading. I served this by placing the chicken, topped with the cooked mushrooms and the extra sauce, on a bed of angel hair pasta that i had tossed in the same garlic lemmon/butter sauce, and some steamed carots. I think next time i will use plain old olive oil and garlic on the pasta next time though!! Yummy! My husband adored this, saying "This is good enough to be served in a restaurant!" We even used the leftovers the next morning chopped up in omlettes. I can definately see how this breading would make a phenomenal Chicken Parmasean coating!

This was an easy, delicicous chicken dish worthy of a special dinner for company. The zing of the lemon, the carmelized mushrooms, and the crunch of the coating makes this dish a hit.

Simply Delicious. I also will use alot more mushrooms next time. And believe me there will be a next time. The garlic flavor was perfect. Not a calorie saver but what the heck!!!

I was very pleased with the flavor and texture of the chicken, and will certainly be making this recipe again. Taking the suggestion of others, I increased the amount of lemon-butter sauce and added garlic. I also used Italian herb bread crumbs, instead of the plain alternative. Yum, yum, yum.

This is absolutely delicious!!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, sliced baby bellas, panko bread crumbs and coursely shredded parmesan.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it was a little soggy on the bottom.  Not sure how to resolve this problem, but the taste is excellent.  I will make this again!!

I made this last night and it was good. I added more mushrooms though (almost double what the recipe called for), and they were tasty.  The chicken is very moist.  The prep time took a bit longer than I thought it would, but it's worth it. This is a really good chicken recipe and I'll be making it for guests as well!

Very good!  I used both breasts (which I like) and thighs (which my wife prefers) and it worked well.  The only change I might make is to add more mushrooms.  What appeared to be a *HUGE* amount of mushrooms before cooking was not many after baking.  To be fair to the poster, I didn't weigh the mushrooms I used so I may not have used a full pound.

We found this fairly bland even after having added additional garlic powder.  It still neede extra "zip."  It did, however, maintain its moisture, which breasts often don't do.  Overall, however, it was disappointing.

I made this for dinner last night and it was easy and very good.  I took the suggestion of others and doubled the butter/lemon juice mixture.  I think it would have been way too dry with the original amount so that is why I rated only 4 stars.  Husband liked it so I will make again.  Next time I might add some raw onion in with the mushrooms for some extra flavor.  We are onion lovers.

This is an awesome recipe!! We made it with chicken tenders and used a romano/parm cheese mix and it was excellent. My husband wanted to make it again the next day, and I think next time I will try it with pork chops instead of chicken. MUST TRY!!

Pretty easy and quick to prepare.  I just estimated the Parmesan Cheese and bread crumbs.  I did use 2 eggs though as other reviewers suggested and that amount was right for 4 chicken breasts.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough mushrooms but the dish was good even with just the few mushrooms I had on hand.  The kids ate it without complaint and the husband liked the dish and is giving it the 5 star review.

Really good chicken!  The prep time isn't horrible, but slicing the mushrooms does take time.  Had lots of leftover bread crumb mixture; just sprinkled it on top the chicken in the pan, no big deal.  Good garlic/parmesan flavor.  Tasted great with scallop potatos and peas.

I am giving a 5 star because overall it deserves.  I halfed the recipe for 4 servings.  Other than trying to half an egg I halfed everything else.  My company loved it.. it was a fix and serve to company but I was not as pleased.  First I used half the mushrooms..unless they were under the chicken breasts they were "well" done, but tasty, a little different flavor. 
Cooked at 375 degree F for 45 minutes and my instant read came up to 180 degrees.. Have to admit it was still moist, breading crispy, but I will leave the mushrooms at a pound and the butter and lemon juice.  I will reduce the temp to 350 or I will leave at 375 but check at 30 mins...  temp to high I believe..  It was a hit.. Served with Potatoes McGrew my recipe and French Onion Carrots, my recipe.

We loved this recipe. It was easy and delicious. I think the ingredients do better for no more then 6 breasts, however. I used 5 and had just enough of everything except I did have extra of the bread crumb mixture. It's a keeper!

I really like this recipe, and so has everyone I've served it to. The only changes I've made were to double the sauce,  replace the lemon juice with Chardonay, and marinate the chicken in Chardonay for an hour or so in advance. It's delicious over linguini tossed with olive oil and pesto.

There are only 2 of us and I used 2 huge boneless breasts(equal to 4 regular size). I cut the recipe in half except for the butter on the bottom. I also used a slightly smaller   dish and the larger breasts took  about an hour to cook through. It was delicious. I added water to the bottom half way through so the butter wouldn't burn.

I followed the recipe as far as the preparation of the chicken. I just spooned the butter over the top of chicken and added shredded cheddar to it. My husband likes cheese and butter. 
It was very good.

I used chicken tenders instead of breasts, extra Parmesan cheese and double coated the chickwn. I also cooked with spray Avocado Oil instead of butter.  My kids thought it was the best chicken tenders they ever had. Great Receipe!

Came out absolutely amazing! The chicken was very tender and juicy & wasn’t overpowering with flavor. My dad and boyfriend loved it. Will definitely be making this again. I normally hate any baked chicken dishes and this is my official favorite now.

Wonderful dish. I surprised my husband with it, and it turned out great! The only thing I did not do was use bread crumbs as I did not have any. So used the Parmesan only on top and dripped the left over butter lemon mixture on top.
Wonderful!
Thank you

This is our traditional Valentine's Day dinner.  It is so good.  It does take time to put it all together, but all the people at my house look forward to eating it.

Yes, I did make changes. I used a cast iron frying pan and did the entire thing from stove top to oven in it. I sauted 3 cloves of diced up garlic in 1 TBS of oil in a preheated cast iron pan. I dredged the chicken in a beaten egg with a bit of milk added to make it go further. I only did 2 really large breast but cut 2 smaller pieces off so I had a total of 4 pcs to bread. I used Italian preseasoned bread crumbs. I did not add any more garlic as that was already in the pan. I dipped the chicken twice in the egg mix and twice in the breading. Then while the pan was still hot I added the butter and browned the chicken on both sides, then I fried the mushrooms. I spread the mushrooms out across the bottom of the pan and placed the chicken on top. I added a bit more butter so that the pan still had some fat in it. I put the whole thing in the preheated oven at 350 degrees and it only took about 15 minutes. I served with basmati rice and green beans. This was like a meal you would get in a restaurant. It was so delicious. I have saved my modifed recipe and will be making this regularly. Cast Iron cooking is the best and I am glad I could see how to adapt this recipe to it. :)

I used thin sliced cutlets and layered them, almost like an eggplant parm, after laying 2 containers of sliced mushrooms on the bottom of the dish.  It was delicious!   The family loved it and it turned out great.   I also used shredded parm instead of the grated.  Cooking time was about the same to reach 165 degrees

Just finished making this recipe and am loving it! The main thing I did a bit different was cut the chicken into strips to batter and cook - used 1/2 the butter and cheese called for, gluten free bread crumbs and a dash of red pepper. Wanted something a bit different to serve along with a bed of spring lettuce. Indulgence while cutting down on calories!

Make this if you're looking for a chicken marsala recipe  with a different twist.  Next time I would use a few more mushrooms in the pan as they shrink and would be even better over the chicken on plate

This was very tasty and easy to prepare for a crowd since all the cooking was in the oven.  I used both light and dark meat chicken pieces and it worked out fine. Everyone commented on how tasty and moist the chicken was.  I had some leftover garlic cheese croutons and crushed them as part of the bread crumbs.

This was very good. Like others, I doubled the butter & lemon, added garlic to the mushrooms, and also about 1/4 cup of white wine.  Still would like more sauce, to be honest. I only made four chicken breasts. Not sure how you'd fit eight in the pan, based on my experience. They'd be pretty packed in, but that would probably effectively seal the top so the moisture stays with the mushrooms.

This is quite delicious.  After reading multiple reviews, I made a few minor changes suggested by others.  It was necessary to double the egg mixture and breadcrumb mixture to bread 8 chicken breasts.  I pounded down the chicken breasts and I think next time I will butterfly and pound the breasts to make them thinner.  I doubled (could even triple) the mushrooms and added 6 Tbsp butter and 1 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice to soak the mushrooms well.  I also tossed in a handful of sundried tomatoes for color.  I baked for approx. 40 min and they were a little dry, so I'll go 35 (or even less if thinner) next time.  In the last few minutes, I sprinkled Italian cheese over the breasts and turned the broiler on high.  My family who doesn't like mushrooms, couldn't get enough of it!  I served it with yellow rice and cauliflower and spinach side dish from this site. YUM!

I reduced recipe to one large chicken breast, used one egg and good mix of bread crumbs, parmesan, salt and pepper.   1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, a chopped shallot and some minced garlic for roasting bed.  Halfway through baking I poured a couple more tablespoons of melted butter and a squeeze of fresh lemon over breast.  This is delicious! Took about 30 minutes for tender, flavorful chicken and mushrooms were incredible.  This will be a quick favorite.

It was so delicious!!  I used garlic salt instead of powder.  There was a lot of the bread crumb/parm. cheese left over, so I'll reduce that by half maybe the next time.  I also only used 2 breasts, although they were very large.

Easy and delicious!  My husband is pretty silent at meals, but he said he really liked this while he was eating it!  I loved it.  I had to skip the parmesan because mine had been in the frog too long, but the chicken was great anyway.

OMG so good so easy. I added extra lemon to both the egg and the butter by about a tablespoon. It didn't over power the taste at all.

I really  enjoyed this recipe and it is easy to make. The mushrooms and parmesan cheese are an added boost to flavor.  My husband liked it but he is not a fan of mushrooms as much as I am.  I will definitely make this again and perhaps suggest this recipe to both of my sons as they will cook for their families.

Fast Prep, fantastic taste. Followed recipes exactly, except reduced the amounts. Used on boneless chicken thigh. Enough for two of us with left overs.

i followed the recipe to the T as far as ingredients, etc.  we hate overcooked chicken, so i cut the time to 30 minutes, which was perfect.  the "crust" still didn't look cooked enough, so i turned on the broiler for a few minutes & that was better.  the breading for the chicken that lays on the mushrooms was very soggy.  the sauce & mushrooms were tasty.  overall pretty good, but i don't think i will rush to make it again.

Love love love this recipe!  It is so good.  I've made it as written and it turns out perfect.  I even made it with onions instead of mushrooms when I was out.  I think the best is with mushrooms AND onions.  Also, I add more garlic to the mushrooms, double the butter/lemon sauce  and add extra garlic to it as well.   Use an extra egg.   Awesome recipe... perfect for guests!!

Only changes I made was no mushrooms because I don't eat them. I used plain panko instead of regular breadcrumbs. With the garlic powder, salt and pepper it balances nice and more crunchy.  The flavor is great. I would definitely make again.

We loved this. We decided we'd like a little more sauce next time. Also, I didn't drizzle the sauce over the chicken to keep it nice and crisp. We'll do it again!

Recipe is good as written, however to make it excellent, MORE mushrooms, double the butter/ lemon, with even more lemon, and the cook time is 25- 30minutes tops for tenderloins.
Will make again with some adjustments. Thank You for Sharing.

This was easy and very delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  I made it for a small gathering and cut the breasts into three "fingers".  Other than that, I substituted tarragon for parsley because I'm not crazy about parsley.  One of my friends gave it a "three-thumbs-up".

Simple recipe and the chicken came out moist. I wouldn't change a thing and would make it again. I served chicken and mushrooms with some roasted sweet potato.

Didn't have butter, so I replaced it w/ avocado oil, otherwise followed the recipe & it was delicious!  The chicken came out crispy outside& juicy inside, and I especially liked the slight tang the lemon juice gave the mushrooms. I even used the leftover egg & breadcrumbs to coat broccoli florets, which I then sauteed to go with the chicken & mushrooms. It was a yummy meal!

Delicious!  I will definitely make it again.  I did not have parsley so I left that out.  I did six chicken breast halves because they were really big and that is all that would fit in the 9x13.  I also used granulated garlic instead of garlic powder.

Followed most of the recipe as listed.  I did pound out the chicken breasts before cooking.  That made the cooking time less and the breasts more tender.  The mushrooms on the bottom of the cooking dish were perhaps the best part of the recipe.

This was very good. I was trying to find something to cook with mushrooms where I wouldn’t have to eat them since I don’t care for them, but my son loves them. This was perfect. I did add herbs I like to the breading, but basically followed the recipe. It was perfect, super simple and I actually wound up eating a couple mushrooms!

We love mushrooms so added a bit more and then a bit more lemon juice and butter for sauce. Also made sure to spinkle some of the leftover bread crumbs/parmesian cheese on chicken and mushrooms prior ro cooking.. REALLY GREAT DISH!

I doubled the egg. Used half cup bread crumbs and half cup flour (as I ran out of bread crumbs). Added more lemon juice. Used cremini mushrooms and this turned out sooo well! So easy and ingredients are readily available. Delicious!

Made exactly as written except the most important ingredient. MUSHROOMS! I love them and feel this recipe would be awesome with lots of mushrooms. But sadly to say the family hates them. I have no idea what's wrong with these people. The recipe was very good. Fast and easy . Thank you!

I followed the recipe as written, except I had no parsley and left it out.  I used 32 ounces of skinned, deboned chicken breast.  Kraft Parmesan cheese and C4 seasoned bread crumbs.  Changed serving size to 6, and 341 calories each after entering all ingredients on My Fitness App.   Baked for 30 min. And checked with meat thermometer.  Was nice and juicy.  Enjoyed the mushrooms even though I'm not a real fan of them.

This was super easy and flavorful. Nearly all ingredients are found around the kitchen, so there isn't much planing required in order to throw this dinner together. The chicken came out juicy and crisp while the mushrooms were so delicious that it solidified this meal as a common go to in my house

This recipe was easy and delicious!  I used Panko bread crumbs for a crunchier crust.  I too will use more mushrooms next time.  My one complaint is that the bottom of the chicken was soggy due to cooking on top of the mushrooms so I think next time I will only bread the top side of the chicken.  Overall, an excellent dish.  I will be making it again and again!

Simple and easy to put together!  My family enjoyed it and the leftovers were even better!  I served with mashed potatoes and fried squash.  I bought larger chicken breasts so it took an hour to cook but they were tender and juicy.

This recipe makes me think that there are probably lots of recipes for baked chicken parts where one could ditch the roasting-rack-on-pan approach & instead put the chicken parts directly onto fresh vegetables prepared in similar fashion (but doubling the amount of butter & lemon juice, as many here have suggested). Imagine using such vegetables (singly, or in combination, or even as a dazzling cornucopia) as: carrot slices or baby carrots, quartered Brussels sprouts, small broccoli & cauliflower florets, halved cherry tomatoes, parsnip slices, turnip slices, a large dice of rutabaga, pearl onions or separated rings of sweet onion, micro potatoes, whole green beans, etc. Stir them into the butter/lemon sauce first, then dump them onto the roasting pan. Even the chicken parts could be done that way & placed onto the veggies. (No soggy breading, no roasting rack to scrub.)

I made this tonight and it's wonderful! However, if you only use 4 chicken breasts I think the recipe will be perfect. The sauce and mushrooms are more suited for 4 breasts not 8.

Good recipe. Glad I heeded the advice of others to use two eggs vs one. Good call otherwise not near enough product to sufficiently coat the chicken. I reserve 5 stars for truly mind blowing recipes but this was quite good and would recommend.

I stumbled upon this recipe trying to figure out how to use weird random stuff in my pantry - bottled lemon juice? Canned mushrooms? Yes, ick, don't ask haha. I had zero hopes for this meal being anything but filling, and...WOW! I swear, my husband & toddler were both exclaiming "YUM!" while shoveling bites. After a huge 2nd helping my husband proclaimed he "could just DRINK the sauce out of the pan!" I can't imagine how good this will be with fresh mushrooms & lemon juice, but I am absolutely making this again. I don't know how something this easy is this darn delicious, but trust the reviews- it IS. Yum, and thank you for such a great recipe! :)

I made this recipe last night to rave reviews from my family.  I will definitely be making this again and passing on the recipe to my sisters and my daughter.  

The mushrooms on the bottom were perfectly cooked and so full of flavor from the butter/lemon mixture and the juices from the chicken. I added some Parmesan cheese on top before I put the chicken breasts on them which gave them even more flavor. Yum!

It was good.  Really moist chicken but a little to plain for us.  Would add more spices and herbs if we make it again.

My daughter made this for dinner tonight and it was fabulous, the only change she made was she took original saltine crackers and crushed them up and used them  in place of the bread crumb,  and she only cooked the chicken for about  35 min. This was so, so, good, will be adding it to my family favorites. Like others said, next time we would double the mushrooms and sauce because we were all licking the bottom of the pan.

The prep took me a bit longer than the estimated 10 minutes, but I think that is because I am a relatively inexperienced cook compared to the majority of cooks on this site. Still, pretty easy. Quite delicious. I made one change in the recipe. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because I consider dark meat to taste better than white meat. It lived up to all expectations. With the leftovers the next day, I added about 1/2 can of undiluted, condensed cream of mushroom soup to a wide bowl and placed the chicken and mushrooms on top of it before reheating in the microwave. The flavors blend perfectly.. You could also put the soup in a cup on the side as a dip.

I made this for 1 person (me!) by changing the servings in the recipe.  As other suggested I used Italian bread crumbs, mixed fresh garlic with the mushrooms & sprikled with shredded mozzerella when 5 minutes were left. It tasted like something you would get served in a fancy Italian restaurant. Absolutely delicious.

This recipe comes out too dry, I would say.  It would benefit from some kind of sauce, and it wouldn't be too hard to make one with all the fond left stuck to the pan.

I didn't end up using a whole pound of mushrooms, because even slicing my mushrooms thick, I lined the bottom of a 9x13 and a smaller pan with a layer each.  I didn't want to stack mushrooms on mushrooms, since they wouldn't benefit from the butter/lemon juice greasing the pans.

The chicken turned out a bit dry, and the flavors were subdued.  Perhaps using thigh meat would work out better.

Great eveyday chicken recipe that was eay to follow. My family was tired of my usual baked chicken so I tried this recipe. It got rave reviews and my teenager ate leftovers, oddly for breakfast- unheard of for chicken in my house.  I served it over noodles which paired well with the savory breaded chicken. Not all in my household like mushrooms and it was easy to exclude them from dinner plates as needed since they were not mixed in, but on the bottom of the baking dish. Thanks for sharing this jazzy alternative to my ordinary midweek chicken dinner.

I have made several times now, like another review I never use garlic powder. Granulated garlic is much better. I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs and hold the parmesan cheese until the last 10 minutes of baking time.  Instead of the parsley I add shredded parmesan and slivered green onion as a topping for the last ten minutes.

I made this exactly as written other than using salt-free bread crumbs, but instead used garlic salt, not powder.  My husband and I loved it.  I didn't have enough mushrooms, but the ones that were in the dish turned out perfectly.  I used very large boneless skinless chicken breasts because they were on hand and they were not dry.  Very simple dish to prepare; a good meal for a weekday dinner and a great dinner party meal possibly served with risotto.  Then you don't have to pay attention to the entree and give your attention to the risott.  I'll make this many times over.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. My family loved it. I modified it a bit since I used more than 1 lb of chicken.  I doubled the butter and added some wine.  Will definitely be making this dish again!

This recipe is a winner!  I didn't have enough mushrooms so I added sliced squash.   And in place of lemon juice, I used lime because that's what I had available.  Easy and delicious!  I will definitely make it again!

This was very good! I did not have bread crumbs so I used Ritz crackers. The chicken itself was a bit bland. I will make this again, but with more seasonings. The mushrooms were delicious, I added extra and we still could of eaten more. I served it with roasted veggies, it was a big hit!

So....I had chicken cutlets and not breasts, so I improvised.   I did  flour dredge first with salt, pepper and egg. Then a panko dredge with garlic salt and old bay. DUDE!  I sautéed them in olive oil and placed them in the oven to keep warm cause I don't have kitchen time management skills. We are all a work I  progress.

I also sautéed the mushrooms, garlic, butter and lemon and used it as a topper with a bed of rice.

This was soooooo good! My husband was working late the night I first made it and when he saw it on the plate he asked if I ordered food! For my oven 45 minutes was too long, I cut it down to 35 minutes the second time and it was perfect! I highly recommend using fresh minced garlic instead of powder - I added it to the bottom with the mushrooms. To die for! This is definitely a keeper!

I've made this a couple of times now.  The only change I make is using boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  They take a little less time than the breasts.  This time, I put slices of potatoes in the same dish with the chicken and served it with "Easy, Dynamite Curry Cauliflower."  Great meal!

This was really good and I'm glad I made it for company. I made a very large quantity and did make some changes. I used 8 thick chicken breasts and skipped the whole egg wash and bread crumbs part. I used about 5 packages of various mushrooms sliced and put those in the bottom of the pan. Then I melted a 1/2C butter, added about 2 T. minced garlic and mixed that in with the mushrooms. Then I added about 1 C of white wine and just a bit of kosher salt. Then laid the chicken breasts over the mushrooms and sprinkled granulated garlic powder, kosher salt and pepper, some dried oregano, parsley and basil over the chicken. The last thing I did was melt another stick of butter and add 1 fresh lemon's juice and pour it over the chicken. Baked at 375 and needed almost an hour to cook. This was delicious! Served with green beans and roasted potatoes. Everyone loved it!

This is so darn good!  I've been on this site several years now & I've probably made this chicken 20+ times.  I double the crumb mixture using panko bread crumbs,  2 beaten eggs, and packaged, not canned, parmesan cheese.  I just eyeball the amount of garlic & probably error on the heavy side (in the egg & bread crumbs) because we are garlicholics. Fresh minced garlic is definitely the way to go but powdered garlic works in a pinch. I also doubled the lemon juice. I split the boneless, skinless breasts cut in half lengthwise. Then I sprinkle the extra crumbs with cheese over the top.  If you like mushrooms, feel free to add more.  Just after drizzling the lemon butter over the top,  I spray the top with Pam spray to help in the browning.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I used chicken tenderloins rather than breasts, so I cut the cooking time to 25-30min. I only added a few sprinkles of bottled lemon juice to the butter mixture. When I poured the extra butter on top, I poured it over the mushrooms rather than the chicken. I used shredded rather than grated Parmesan for the bread crumb mixture. After layering the mushrooms and chicken in the pan, I sprinkled a little extra Parmesan over everything. Despite the ease of the recipe, it seemed very classy. I groaned with delight nearly every bite. I will definitely make this again.

Everyone liked this. I also doubled the egg since the package of chicken was fairly large. Also doubled the butter/lemon sauce. Very easy to make and delicious.

The flavor was good but my chicken ended up a little on the dry side. I am by no means a fantastic chef and there are probably ways to keep it moist...I just don't know what they are. My wife liked it, my son didn't care for the mushrooms but overall nice dish.

Love this chicken! We have made this multiple times and my younger kids like it too and they tend to be picky.  Only change I made was using crushed plain potato chips instead of breadcrumbs because I had them on hand the first time I made it and my family loved it so much I just keep using the chips.  I also doubled the egg mixture and the lemon butter as people had suggested so that I ended up with more  lemon butter  sauce at the end.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

YUM!! Typically breaded chicken recipes end up a little mushy, but this one actually had some crunch! I toasted the top in the last few minutes by switching the oven to broil, and voila! And with everything else I had going on top of the stove, I actually forgot to chop up the fresh parsley that I bought, so I threw some dried parsley on it before I put it in the oven and it was still wonderful. Looks like I'll have to make it a few more times so I can use my fresh parsley!! =) Oh and I used 2 eggs, definitely needed that.

I really liked this dish. It was very easy and I happened to have all of the ingredients on hand.  The butter/lemon sauce is great doubled and over rice and the chicken came out very tender and juicy.  I kept everything the same otherwise. Thank you for a yummy, easy meal!

This is probably the easiest delicious chicken I've ever made. I only had 4 chicken breasts and followed the recipe as written but next time I make it and only have 4 breasts I will half the bread crumb mixture. I wouldn't double the sauce because we liked the crispiness of the chicken when it was cooked. Thanks for sharing this recipe. We will continue to enjoy it.

I made this dish for my coworkers and the executives of my place of work, and they absolutely loved it!!!  I did follow the suggestions to the other comments  for this recipe, but i think i will try to incorporate white wine into this recipe to make it pop even more.  I served this dish with baked catfish and roasted vegetables and a baked rice pilaf.   This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was a very delicious meal. I would go as far to say it was the best baked chicken I've ever had. It has an Italian feel to it and would be delicious if it was sliced and put into and Alfredo. Even the next day it was good just thrown into the microwave for a minute. Overall a very good recipe.

Turned out excellent!  I flattened the chicken breast a bit so they were so thick and doubled the butter lemon juice mixture.  Turned out great.  Will make again.

omigosh! found this recipe earlier today, made it for supper!! Yummy!! yes, the bottom of the chicken was not crispy---but the coating had soaked up some of the lemon-butter the mushrooms were in. Also, I had some of the bread crumb mixture left over, and I sprinkled it over the chicken---some of it got in with the mushrooms and it was wonderful! next time--more mushrooms and more lemon-butter sauce.

Oh WOW! really good! Made this 3 times. Ended up using lime juice, more mushrooms, 1-1/2 cup bread crumbs with 1 cup shredded parmesan. This remaining crumb mixture just sprinkled over chicken once in pan. But there is nothing wrong with this as is. Just tweeked a bit to our preference. So yummy!  A must try!

Warm, friendly food that always brings that 'mmmm' smile with the first bite!  Quite popular in our house.  Fairly quick prep and a popular favorite with family and friends.  It is ALWAYS great and tastes like you worked a lot harder : )

I have made this many times but without the mushrooms (alergic) and it is always good. Recently tried it with Lawery's Salt instead of regular salt and turned out just as good but with a slightly different flavor

This was an easy recipe to get together and had a lot of flavor!  The only thing I did different was to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs and add a little onion powder to the crumbs.   We really loved the flavor, but, the chicken was definitely overcooked.  I started checking mine at 35 minutes and should have checked it sooner.   The chicken breasts I had were larger, so, I thought 35 minutes would be a good starting point.  I would start checking yours about 25 minutes and go from there.  45 minutes would have been much too long for boneless breasts.

Loved this recipe! I put the breadcrumbs, garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese in a gallon zip lock bag. After I dipped the chicken in the egg, I put it in the bag and shook. Made for easy clean up. Family loved the taste.

This recipe would definitely benefited from more seasoning. Next time I will season the chicken (perhaps paprika, blackened seasoning, Italian blend..or something) before dipping in the egg mixture.  the mushrooms were delightful but will add more of those next time too as they shrink up a lot. I will bake this no more than 35 next time and then test doneness as the breasts were a bit on the dry side too.

Amazing!  Loved it and will make again.  I substituted garlic salt to the breadcrumbs cuz I ran out of garlic powder and doubled the eggs.  I also didn't have enough breadcrumbs so I crushed some croutons.  Seasoned and yummy.  Also topped with Rosemary instead of parsley.  Used lots of butter and cooked a little longer to make crispy.  Sooooooo good.  Will make for company.

Everyone loved this meal at home! The only thing I did different is that I covered the pan with foil for the first 20min and then uncovered it until cooked and browned up.

Loved it.  I've been making this every month.. Each time i make it i try to add some more spice and flavor to it.. I agree that 45 mins may be too long.. I usually take it out in 30-35 mins.. I would recommend this recipe as it's easy quick and yummy!! :)

I really liked this recipe, but the butter and lemon sauce wasn't hearty enough for me and the chicken breading was not crispy as I liked. So after the chicken baked in the oven, I heated oil in a fry pan and let the breading fry on both sides for about one minute. I then set it aside on a paper towel to soak up the oil. Using the same pan, I added about 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 teaspoons of flour to make a roux. Then added about 1/2 cup of milk to make a gravy. Drain the butter-lemon sauce from the pan and stir together the mushrooms. This was an amazing turnout and my husband wants me to make it once a week!

Made it tonight. The whole family LOVED it! Served it with healthy rice blend (drizzled some of the lemon butter sauce on it) and green beans with a dash of lemon pepper. The bomb! Its a keeper. :) Thanks for sharing.

This was easy and pretty good. I doubled the sauce and was glad I did. However, if I make it again I will try it without the lemon, as I didn't really love the taste of it with the mushrooms.

My picky ten year old said this was the best chicken I had ever made.  It was simple, I had all the ingredients on hand.  I only added a little more butter and fresh garlic to the bottom of the pan as others suggested.   There was no leftovers!

Easy recipe, and delicious!  I followed others' advice here, and baked for 35 minutes - came out perfectly cooked.  I used 2 chicken breasts (since there are only 2 of us), and cut them in half.  I used half the amount of bread crumbs & parmesan cheese, but full amount of mushrooms, butter & lemon juice.  I also minced 2 cloves of garlic and added them to the mushroom mixture, instead of using garlic powder.

Excellent. I agree with the other posters and used seasoned bread crumbs and a little more cheese than it called for (I actually sprinkled it over the top). Not as great left over and next time I will likely use smaller breasts or chunk them up a bit so it cooks faster. (It took me 1:15 minutes)
Update: I've made this a few more times and each time it gets better! I have learned to filet the chicken so it cooks more easily, continue to use seasoned bread and panko crumbs and extra cheese. It's become one of my favorites! Thanks for sharing.

This is my go to chicken recipe. I've done it with bone in chops too. I use seasoned bread crumbs, mini portobellos and usually add extra lemon.

I cut the garlic by 1/2 tsp and added approx 1 tsp ground tuscan herbs to the seasoning.  I also used baby Bella mushrooms in it. My husband adored it.  I served it with pasta and fresh marinara and a salad.

this was so simple to make and oh so yummy!  I had chicken breasts on hand (albeit not boneless or skinless) and wanted some kind of baked chicken recipe....I had the lemon and breadcrumbs (I used Italian), but no parmesan cheese....I waited til the chicken only had 15 more minutes in the oven before throwing in the sliced mushrooms...it all came out so tasty, I didn't miss the parmesan at all!  and neither did my husband...will def. make again, and it's good enough to make as a special meal for company!

This was phenomenal. I'm sure it'd be great no matter what but I do recommend that you do as others have suggested and add a couple of chopped fresh garlic cloves to the butter at the bottom of the dish. It infuses the chicken breasts marvelously. I sauteed the garlic for a few minutes in the butter before adding to the bottom of the dish, rather than just melting the butter and adding the garlic. Really happy with the result. I got scared by how many mushrooms it asked for and cut in half but wished I put them all in because they were drop-dead delicious. Thanks for this... a wonderful recipe.

This was absolutely delicious and tasted better than those chicken chardon I've tasted at restaurants. I did take the advise of others and doubled all the ingredients and it came out and tasted excellent! Also, to avoid it being salty, I didn't add salt to any of the ingredients. I pre-seasoned the chicken breast with 2 tsp of chicken bouillon. My family enjoyed every bit of it. Thank you!

I loved how tender the chicken was and it was very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and felt like it needed something else...  It seemed bland.  So next time I'll follow the advice of other reviews and make some changes to include more garlic, Italian bread crumbs, more lemon and I'll see how that turns out.

Really good, I used mushroom soup as I was out of mushrooms.  Used two breasts and just reduced the amt. of  dry ingredients, used Italian bread crumbs.  Loved how fast it was.

I really enjoyed this dish. I have a family of 4 (2 are younger children) so I only cooked 3 chicken breasts but I kept the other ingredient amounts the same.  I will definitely cook this again.  I may add a little more lemon for the flavor.

great flavor. A hit with my teens.  The onlyreason I didn't give it a 5 star is cuz of the greasy/fat butter. We made some brown rice to go with and put zuchinni and yellow squash in place of the mushrooms.
Quick and easy

Very good. The lemon butter sauce with the mushrooms was delicious. I used panko for the chicken and it came out great, crispy and flavorful.

Holy cow this was good... I did it a little bit different. I didn't use garlic and used Italian breadcrumbs. I also used two egg whites and I can't believe its not butter to make it more calorie friendly. It was soooo moist and tender. I also added crunchy onions to the top oh boy.

This came out delicious! the chicken breast I used were very thick so 45 mins was perfect, nice and juicy. Make sure to check your chicken earlier if theyre not very thick, probably will need less cooking time. 

The mushrooms came out fantastic! I put in twice as many, with a tablespoon more butter. 

I liked it with some pasta or mashed potatoes. :)

This is a fantastic, quick and easy recipe! I have made this 3 times now, and will make it again and again in the future. The lemon butter sauce infuses into the mushroom (I used steak sliced size), and the chicken is crispy and full of flavor! I served with a simple side of green beans and chicken and mushroom rice-a-roni. This is a keeper.

This is the second time I made this recipe. My kids actually said its their favorite meal I make now! My husband loves it too. The chicken is full of flavor and so moist. I did double the butter sauce. I am not a huge chicken dish lover, but this one I love.

I needed a meat dish to serve along side pasta, but did not want chicken parmesan since my pasta sauce was already tomato based.   This turned out to be the perfect solution.  It smelled soo good baking in the oven.  I could hardly wait for dinner!  It was moist, flavorful, and had a beautiful crisp coating.

This chicken was awesome!  I have lots of chicken recipes with bread crumbs and they all come out about the same - bland chicken with a little bit of crunch.  To be fair, I'm not a huge fan of chicken and I do not like bland food.  So, I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe which had a lot of flavor and wasn't too dry - despite me overcooking it a bit.  I used 1# of chicken rather than 6 breasts.  1# of chicken was 1 1/2 jumbo chicken breasts and I pounded them a little thinner, cut them into smaller pieces and kept all of the other ingredients the same.  Very good - will make again.  I changed NOTHING except the amount of chicken.

Simple recipe, great for a busy weeknight.  I made half the amount of chicken called for, but used the same amount of sauce and mushrooms as written in the recipe and made it all in my cast iron skillet in the oven.  I also replaced the egg with a 1/4cup eggbeaters. I also only baked it for 35 minutes, as my chicken breasts were small.

I have tried this several times.  The first time I made the recipe as described.  The bottom of the chicken was soggy because fresh mushrooms when they cook give off a lot of liquid.  The second time I did the mushrooms seperately from the chicken and that was great.  Then I changed it up some by adding fresh garlic, more seasonings, a little bit of red pepper, panko bread crumbs and mor lemon juice. The lemon just brightens up the flavors so much.  I have done it with pork chops too. Great recipe!

Wow. This is seriously delicious! Just goes to show how a few simple ingredients can come together to make something remarkable. I added some paprika to the egg mixture, used about half again as much of the butter and lemon juice, and sprinkled about a teaspoon of fresh thyme (had to use it up because it was about to go bad) over the mushrooms. My whole family wanted to kiss me after eating this dinner! Thanks so much, maddiegail!

I chose this recipe because my daughter loooves mushrooms, but I never cook with them because I don't like them. This recipe had good reviews so I figured it was worth a shot. Oh wow! It was fabulous. Everyone in the house ate it and asked for more, and my 4 yr old son specifically asked for more mushrooms! I've made it twice now, and promised to keep it in the regular rotation.

When I made this last night, I was struck by two things: 1) Such an easy dish to make! and, 2) It wasn't so very flavorful. Given all the wonderful reviews, I couldn't understand it. Then, I went back on here to review the recipe and realized I'd forgotten the parmesan cheese and the lemon. Whoops! Next time, I'll be sure to add those. The mushrooms were delicious either way!

I made this for dinner tonight and thought it was very good.  I only used 4 chicken breasts but kept the other mixtures the same.  Next time I'd halve the breadcrumb/parm mixture if only doing 4 breasts, but if doing all 8 I think you'll need to time and a half the butter and egg mixtures (okay, you can't really half an egg, but you need more than one but less than two.)  Anyway, I followed the recipe as stated except using italian bread crumbs (made own using 1 cup plain breadcrumbs plus:
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried basil.)
Overall it was great and pretty moist (cook only 35minutes next time.)  Maybe a smidgeon too much garlic, but tasty!  Also make sure not to pour too much butter over the top or the coating won't crisp up nicely.

I made this for my wife last night.  I love the comment that Maddiegail made about "Your guests will never know how hard you didn't work!"  It was so easy and tasted like I hade worked hard to prepare it.  We both loved it.  The touch of lemon in the garlic butter gave the mushrooms a slight tang that made them delicious.  Next time I will try adding a little mozzarella just before it is done baking like several people have suggested.  I have already added this to my recipe box and will be making it frequently.

So easy to make and it tastes great! The mushrooms impart no flavor to the chicken so it's even okay for mushroom haters! I used panko bread crumbs and shredded parmesan.

Very tasty. Some people said to use Italian bread crumbs, but I didn't have any so I used regular with some Italian seasoning. I also added just a few thin slices of onion mixed in with twice the amount of mushrooms.

This was absolutely delicious!  I used only 5 skinless/boneless chicker breast and followed the recipe as it was stated.  My friend loved this dish and already asked when I was going to make it again.  My reply was "soon".  It was by far the best chicken breast recipe I have ever made.  Yum....

This was REALLY good and couldn't be more simple. The chicken was so moist and the mushrooms were ridiculously flavorful after cooking in all those juices. This will be a frequent repeater in my menu planning. My boyfriend ate seconds and is eyeing a third piece, so I think it's safe to say he's OK with that. :) I made no changes - this recipe is PERFECT as-is.

Added the cajun seasoning and a few other spices to make it more interesting.  Tasty but still could have used even more seasoning. Will make again and tweak a bit more.

Impress your family with this.  It got unsolicited RAVES and I loved it too.  No bread crumbs in the cupboard so I used crackers.  Company coming .... Rely on Grandma.  I wrote this review after having leftovers for lunch.... It was Good !

This dish was really delicious, easy to make, my family loved it and its pretty to look at!! I used Panko breadcrumbs and it turned out nice and crunchy on the outside! I have made it several times and the only adjustment was a tablespoon of water added to the egg wash, and I use about 3 Tbs of lemon juice because we love citrus. it is crispy and golden every time. if your chicken breasts are really large you may need to bake longer , or pound them flatter before preparing.

I used breast tenderloins and it still came out juicy and moist, however, I only had to bake for 25 minutes.  As suggested, I mixed bread crumbs with panko, added paprika, and turned on the broiler to give the the chicken a nice brown color just as suggested.  My family and l loved it!  Definitely will make again!

One word - YUUMMMM!! Two great things about this recipe, it's easy, and everything needed, was already in my fridge/pantry, (except mushrooms and parsley, but it turned out delicious without them). I personally only used 1 1/2 tsp of garlic, and substituted the other 1/2 tsp recommended, for paprika. It gave it a nice little bite. This went over really well in my home and we will definitely be making it again very soon!!

I like this recipe. Do you think it would work to prep everything ahead of time and refrigerate until I came home? Then I could just pop it in the oven and make salad and veggies to go with it. Has anybody tried that?

Very good.  Husband loves chicken and this is one of his favorite recipes.  Made it just as written.  Did not change a thing.

The breading on the chicken was great.  However, the mushrooms shriveled up to nothing.  I made it again and left out the mushrooms b\c I didn't have any and it was still great.  The 4 stars is b\c the mushrooms cooked too long.  I would recommend adding extra liquid so they don't shrivel up or adding them halfway into the cooking process.

This is a great recipe and SUPER easy.  I made one modification:  REAL GARLIC sautéed in a bit of butter - i only use garlic powder if I'm out of REAL garlic.  I have to dock that recipe a point for that.    I served it (REAL) garlic mashed potatoes and string beans (I'm not a snob, those were actually frozen).

I made this last night. I loved it, hubby not so much. Followed the directions except only 2 large ckn brst. I kept all the other ingredients the same. He thought it had too much parm in the coating. Loved the mushrooms. I served it with egg noodles and salad. Thanks for the great recipe. I will make it again with a little less cheese.

This is a terrific recipe!  We all loved it.  But I'm thinking next time I make it, I'll try it with white wine substituted for the lemon juice, for a slightly different taste.

Was delicious, new family favorite. I doubled the egg and put two layers of mushrooms.  If you like mushrooms the flavor of them in the juices is amazing.

I absolutely loved this recipe and have made it a regular meal for us.

I added more melted butter and garlic powder.  Next time, I will add more mushrooms.

I didn't find the prep hard or time consuming.

Exceptionally good. I doubled the mushrooms/lemon/butter also. I also pounded the chicken breasts which I usually prefer. Will definitely make again. So easy and fast. Great recipe.

We loved this.  Didn't get to use the mushrooms hubby don't like.  But it turned out moist and flavorful.  Thanks for the post.
