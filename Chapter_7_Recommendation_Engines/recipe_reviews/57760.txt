This is a pretty good burger if you like A1. My husband is a huge fan of A1 (I am admittedly not) so I thought I'd give these a try because I love horseradish. The one drawback here is the directions on this one are really confusing! I think that's why so many of the reviewers had trouble with them and ended up adding eggs and bread crumbs to the mixture to hold the burgers together which is not what the submitter intended. I had one pound of ground beef (wasn't able to scale the recipe back) so here's what I did: I used 2 Tbsp. of A1, 1 & 1/2 tsp. of horseradish sauce, 1 tsp. parsley, 1 Tbsp. green onion, and 1 tsp. of Montreal Steak seasoning for good measure. Once the patties were made (got 3) I let them set in the fridge for an hour to let the flavors blend together. We put them on the grill and basted them with some additional A1 as the recipe states and man did these smell good! They held together just fine. We topped them with the Muenster cheese and a horseradish sauce that I made: light mayo, horseradish, dijon mustard, a squirt of lemon juice, and some crumbled bacon bits.  I think my husband was in A1 heaven!

Sorry for the confusion with this recipe. You do not mix the remaining steak sauce into the ground beef. Use it as a baste while the burgers are grilling.  When they're done, top with horseradish mixture.  "Thick & Hearty" sauce works best!

Tasty.  I mixed the ingredients in with the beef before making the burgers.  As mentioned by others, very difficult to keep together.  Might make a good meat loaf.

These were ok.  They were a little to tangy for me.  I added an egg and a little bread crumbs, and they still were hard to keep together on the grill.

Taste of the burgers was good, but I had a difficult time getting them to stay together on the grill. They crumbled very quickly.

Made for Recipe Group. I was expecting this to have the ingredients mixed into the beef. That is not how the recipe actually reads however. Hubby and son said it was good, I didn't think it was worth all the effort. Thanks anyway.

I made a few small changes to this recipe and it came out GREAT! I added 2 eggs to help them stay together better and replaced the steak sauce with the new THICK worcestershire by lea and perrins.

Really good and easy.  Cooked them under the broiler since we just got 1 foot of snow.

These were good burgers and easy to throw together.  With the addition of two eggs I did not have much trouble keeping the burgers together, the important thing is to flip them infrequently.  Not sure how much I loved the taste of the steak sauce, but then again I'm not a steak sauce lover.  It was well recieved by everyone at the table, and will probably be prepared again.

I love original A-1 sauce so I used this recipe group choice as an excuse to buy some. I wish I had read the label more carefully before taking the recommendation to use "thick & hearty". After seeing comments about the sauce being too thin it seemed like a good idea but it's not just thicker than original A-1, it's much sweeter. Given the recipe name, I expected more kick and less sweet from it. The sauce was ok on the burgers but I wouldn't make them again.

Directions are confusing for this recipe. It took me awhile to conclude that you simply make 4 huge patties out of 1.5 pounds of ground beef and simply brush them all using only 2 tablespoon of steak sauce (no salt, no pepper mixed in the meat) and then grill. The rest of the ingredients are all mixed together making a sauce to top the cooked burgers. Although it was good I did reduce the size of the patties to half of what was noted and I would have preferred to have had ingredients mixed in the burger and a little extra sauce for the top. The sauce was thin and runny and enough did not stay on the burgers. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)

Made this for Recipe Group...We really, REALLY enjoyed these...A LOT! I cut the recipe in 1/2, but that was my only change. I used the 'thick and hearty' steak sauce, as suggested by the submitter...GREAT flavor! The sauce was a little on the thin side, which is my only complaint, but it was fine and so tasty on top of the burgers. I also put lettuce and tomatoes on the burgers. I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

We like switching up our burgers and this is a perfect fit. I didn't use nearly as much of the steak sauce that the recipe called for cause it is strong. I used 1 T in the horseradish topping and used that as a spread when the burgers were done. Tasty.

Recipe Group Selection:  09, June 2012 ~ Family was divided on this one.  My husband and I really enjoyed the taste of the sauce with this burger.  DS and his GF weren't crazy about it.

Recipe Group 6/9/12. Nice flavor. With a nice sear on each side they did not stick to my grill. I did not think they were too soft either. I made a mayo, horseradish and BBQ sauce to compliment the sauce with this recipe. We like our condiments so I didn't think the remainder sauce would be enough. Will make again.

Recipe Group selection 6/9/11.  I made 4 burgers from 1# of very lean ground beef and reduced the steak sauce to about 1/3 cup because that was all that was left in the bottle.  Those were my only changes.  The adults enjoyed them, the kids not so much.  Thanks Wendee.

Considering the horseradish, steak sauce, etc. that was in these burger, didn't think it had a lot of flavor.  Not making again.

Just rub with butter once you made it into a patty.
