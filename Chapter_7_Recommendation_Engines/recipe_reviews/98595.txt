This was delicious and full of flavor, but I did make a few changes. Instead of shallot, I used a clove of garlic; subbed sun-dried tomatoes for tomato paste; used veg broth; tripled the cilantro; and added half of a dried chipotle. I also didn't bother with the sour cream. It was pretty thick, so I added veg broth till I got the right consistency. The tequila was very subtle, but it definitely added flavor. This was so easy to make--a definite keeper!

Avocado soup is one of my favorite summer time treats but this recipe did not impress me. I found it rather bland. I think its a good starter recipe to build from. To make it how I like I doubled the cilantro and added it to straight to the soup and blended, once it sits for a while it adds a nice spring time flavor. I also added about a 1/4 cup heavy cream, garlic salt instead of regular and about 2 TBS lemon juice. Making these additions saved the soup. I will use this as my base recipe and keep playing around with it. Next time I may try adding some cucumbers.

I made this soup with some overripe avocados and fat free yogurt instead of sour cream and it turned out superb.It has a very creamy and light texture and tastes great.Its very decadent and looks like a lot of work. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

This is terrific.  Take the other reviewers' advice and go easy on the broth and maybe heavier on the spices and cilantro.  I also squeezed a full lime into the broth instead of using lime or lemon juice.  Wait patiently while it chills in the fridge.  It works better cold and not at room temperature.  The result is very refreshing.

Didn't care for the taste of this. It tasted like watered down guacamole and the hot sauce added a weird taste.

I did not care for this even though I love all of the ingredients listed. I made it exactly per the recipe and I felt like I was eating liquified quacamole. After eating several bites I tried to spice it up with more hot sauce, cilantro and lime but...it just didn't do it for me.

Basically i couldnt resist making this into guacamole - I doubled the cilantro, added some heavy cream and garlic salt as was suggested earlier, but when it cam to adding the stock I stopped at ~2 cups- i shouldnt have even added this much. It compromised the creaminess and avocado flavor.

Pretty good. Make in batches if you're using a food pro and i suggest vegetable stock instead of chicken broth. Tasted very green.

It was good... but I think next time I will make it without the tequila.. had kind of an odd after taste with it. Probably would be a good idea to taste it before you add tequila... and if it is good.. leave it alone! ;-)

This was pretty good and refreshing.  My husband made it last night.  He made a few changes:  only used 2 cups of chicken broth (reduced sodium, which was plenty salty), no tomato paste, juice of a whole lime, no tequila, 1/4 c of chopped cilantro.  It was a nice thing to "blend" on a hot day.  The next time, I would use 3 cups of chicken broth as when we reduced it, it was too thick (and I didn't count this against the recipe when I rated it!).

So I didn't love this soup recipe, but I thought it might make a good base with some changes. I played around with the recipe a bit and found what was perfect for me. I used 2 avocados, left out the tomato paste, added the juice of an entire lime, used 1 tsp of tropical habanero hot sauce, added 3/4 of a shallot, and used 2 tbsp of tequila, 3/4 cup chicken broth, 3 tbsp of fresh cilantro, garlic salt, white pepper and a dash of nutmeg. I also replaced the sour cream with 1/4 cup of heavy cream and let it chill overnight. It was the most phenomenal avocado soup I have ever had!! Thanks for the idea.

Did not like this at all. I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't taste good. I tried adding some more avocado, which actaully made it worse. I ended up throwing it all out.

This is great served chilled, or hot! Made this for a mexican themed supper, and was very good as a starter to the meal.

I thought the basis for this soup was a great idea.  I read all the reviews and made some changes.  I added 2 jalapenos, extra hot sauce and cilantro.  It tasted just like a sour creamy gucamole.  I was disappointed.  The avacado was so overpowering you really couldn't taste much else.

I had a lot of avocados about to turn bad and was looking for a good soup recipe.  This recipe was easy to make with great flavors.  I use low or no sodium chicken broth so I increased the amount of cilantro, lime and hot sauce to perk up the flavor.  I added a touch of walnut oil which was a nice touch.  My husband loved it and would be great for guests on a hot summer day.

The soup was very good; but I increased the spices and used one half of a small red onion.  The only trouble I had was that when I poured  the broth into the food processor, it leaked out because I had not yet processed anything.  I then used the processor  to mix the avocado and everything else with a small amount of broth and poured the mixture into the blender and added the rest of the chicken broth.  P.S. I found that 3.5 cups of broth likely would have made it too thin (I guess it was fortunate that some of the broth leaked out) and would advise using one can of broth and then figuring out how much more broth to add to a consistency that is pleasing.  Over all--very good.

I love avocados and cilantro, so I figured this would be a good soup to try. I'm not sure what I did wrong though, because it came out tasting very salty! I don't add salt to taste on my food, so I'm not sure how it happened. Oh well, it was a good way for me to use up avocados that I needed to get rid of, thanks.

I too used the spring onion instead of shallot.  My husband loved it.  Wish I had the tequila. Would be nice kick.  I am allergic to the bell peppers in most of the gazpachos so this was good.  Best to make ahead and get it good and chilled before serving.

This is delicious!  I took a cue from Kym Cox Surridge and exchanged the shallot for a clove of garlic.  I also tripled the fresh cilantro, and subbed two cans of drained Rotel Mexican Style lime juice and cilantro diced tomatoes.  I added low salt chicken broth a bit at a time to get the right consistency.  The last final touch, a few pinches of Tajin Clásico Seasoning with Lime.  Not much, because the recipe already calls for lime.  This is a definite keeper!!!
