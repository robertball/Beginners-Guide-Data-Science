Modified it a little. Added onions and swapped the sausage for plain chicken. It was really good!

This was quite good.  The Andouille sausage is not very spicy which my husband appreciated.  I would have liked a little more punch but that is OK.   I may try this again with chorizo sausage.  My only suggestion would be to coarsely chop the Andouille sausage rather than cutting them in slices.  I think it would be more distributed.  We prepared the quesadillas in the saute pan to brown the bottom side then popped the entire pan into the oven to brown the top.   I will make these again.

Well, I didn't go all the way to the broiling step - I did the quesadilla in a skillet. It was a little messy. I personally didn't love  quite how smoky it tasted with the chicken sausage and  peppers, but I think others might. The sour cream was a great touch with it.

loved it - however, do not leave it under the broiler on high too longâ€¦i started a little fire.  No damage other than the tortilla on top ;)

This was pretty good except a pain to grill up.  We tried both using a quesadilla maker & by frying & putting under the broiler as directions say.  Neither was very easy to do.  I don't know what the grated carrots were for because you couldn't taste them.  We won't be making again, but they were good & filling.

I make quesadillas on a regular basis, but never had one quite like this before.  I usually make cheese or chicken and cheese, and this provided a nice change of pace.  The Provolone and andouille blended well together, and the avocado complemented both.  I actually wound up not using the roasted red pepper (due to an unfortunate accident with the jar), but it was excellent anyway.
