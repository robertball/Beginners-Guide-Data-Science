I used homemade frozen vanilla yogurt and Smirnoff Whipped Vodka. I skipped the ice. This is off the HOOK. For me, I think that it could use double the vodka and a couple more strawberries but as is, I enjoyed it very much. EXCELLENT cocktail.

Who doesn't like strawberry shortcake?  For  our personal tastes we would use just a little less amaretto the next time.

I made a couple changes. I doubled the strawberries....wanted it to be good and berry flavored.. I did not have any amaretto in the house. I did have banana liquer... i figured strawberry banana would be just as good....so I guess mine is more like banana split!

Yuummy!! I made 1/2 recipe to taste it. I used Edys 1/2 fat French vanilla ice cream. I didn't add the optional vodka, as I just don't care for vodka. I reduced the amaretto, upon reading the other reviews. I just did a couple spoonfuls. Probably, more of a flavoring than a mixed drink. I probably doubled the strawberries and vanilla extract too. The strawberries were frozen and hard to precisely measure. Either way, this does oddly taste like a strawberry shortcake. I bought a tiny bottle of amaretto, which I have never knowingly tasted, and found it to be delicious. TY

This is definitely tasty. I would also add a bit less amaretto. I threw in a dollop of cream cheese frosting in the blender and it made it even tastier.

This was delicious! My boyfriend remarked that it tasted like strawberry cupcake batter. I wasn't in the mood to be really fancy so I didn't add whipped cream and now i regret it. Like someone else I also switched vanilla frozen yogurt for ice cream, used haagan daaz brand.

Very good. Tastes just like strawberry shortcake! We left out the vodka and it tasted like dessert.

I really liked this and will make it again. I used fresh frozen strawberries, omitted the ice and I used Amaretto only. It would be too strong for me had I used the optional vodka. Perfect without it.

Instead of fresh / frozen strawberries I substituted strawberry daiquiri mix. Enjoy next to a swimming pool ;-)

We make this for most of our events. It is a favorite with the girls. We use any liquor that's on hand, but we prefer Amaretto. Since Blue Bell Homemade is no longer an option, we add condense milk to regular vanilla ice cream.
