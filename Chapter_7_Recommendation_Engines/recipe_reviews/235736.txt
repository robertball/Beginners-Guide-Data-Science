What a lovely tuna pattie recipe this is! I have made it several times. The first time I made as written..delicious! The second time I added a smidgeon of curry powder...delicious! And the third time I kept the curry powder and added about a tablespoon of finely chopped onion...delicious!
 Great as written, this is a recipe you can make your own.
Thank you so much for posting it, Wendy. Loved it.  : )

Loved these. The mixture will be runny so you can't really form them into patties, but this should be expected without a binder. The idea is to spoon them into the pan and slightly spread them out. They will firm up during the frying process. I had chopped pecans, so used these instead of walnuts. Only other change was to add a couple tablespoons of chopped onions. Yummy low-carb version of the tuna patties my mom used to make.

I don't normally like tuna patties but these were incredible!! I didn't have celery or walnuts so I left those out and I also put pepperjack cheese on top. So good! Will make again!

These are very tasty.  The only suggestion I have is to add a small amount of panko or bread crumbs for consistency and to refrigerate the patties a bit before frying .  I find these better than the Easy Tuna Patties recipe, as we prefer the cheddar cheese to Parmesan, butter for frying rather than oil, and the herbs give these a great flavor.  The walnuts are another great addition - and I toast mine first for extra flavor.

Needed a fast supper tonight that would work with my hubby's no carb diet and came across this. I did double the recipe and threw in some chopped onion. Very tasty! Adding this to my regular rotation.

My husband loves to fish, so I made this with fresh fish and it was awesome! I sautéed the fish and flaked it. I didn't have celery so I used diced onions. I also added red pepper flakes to give it a kick! I loved the walnuts because it gave them a crunchy texture. Good job Wendy!

So good, but I used Pam instead of butter to save on calories and fats. Ate it on a wheat bun. YUM!

Ok, so I didn't have parsley, dill, or walnuts. I made it with two 7 oz cans of tuna, 1 cup kale chopped, 1 stalk of celery chopped, two eggs, mayonnaise, a little olive oil, a pinch of curry powder, and some pepper to taste. I topped it with medium cheddar cheese. My family and I loved it. It's extremely easy.

I have made this recipe many times,  I am not on a keto diet so I add bread crumbs to hold it all together. It is awesome! I make it at the weekend and eat it throughout the week with my lunches.

I love how easy and quick this recipe is. You can literally use all sorts of fillings and it will still taste awesome. I made 3 patties as I found the smaller the size the lesser they falls apart. I also used a teaspoon of chickpea flour. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested spooning the mixture into the pan and then reshaping it. That works like a charm. I added onions, green pepper, Brazil and hazelnuts (didn’t have walnuts), ground pepper, salt, a bit of turmeric and chilli flakes. Went nicely with sweet potato fries:) This one is definitely a keeper!

I had never had a tuna patty but I am so glad I found this recipe and tried it out! It is great how it is but it also opened my eyes to so many ways it can be changed up to ensure no one gets burned out on it.  I am going to try it with onions, maybe jalapeños, walnuts ....

Very good! I was looking for something a bit different from our usual - this was both simple & good. It held together pretty well & tasted great. Since the recipe didn't mention salt I added Lawry's Seasoned Salt. Very good choice. ;)

Almost forgot - added some onion powder & used dried dill instead of fresh. Made 4 patties instead of 2 - I think that helped them stick together.

It was good. Mix was runny so I spooned it on my griddle to cook. I quadrupled the recipe so we would have extras. I didn't have fresh dill or parsley, so I substituted dried and it still turned out good. We will probably try adding onions and possibly Dijon to the next batch.

I made this according to the recipe and found it extremely runny and hard to form, but really good! in fact, I've made it several times. This time I didn't have celery and decided to change things up. First, I added two cans of tuna and two eggs. I substituted finely chopped onion for the celery. 2 tablespoons of mayo and dried spices instead of fresh. Next, I added 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseedand instead if walnuts (was out) I used craisins (you can get stevia sweetened or low sugar now). still too runny to form but you can use a spoon and drop it on the pan forming into a Patty. Fry as usual and enjoy! For a sauce, I used 2 to 4 tablespoons of mayo, lemon juice to taste, finely chopped onions and dried dill weed. Delicious! (My hubbie & I raved over it)

This dish was fantastic! I only changed walnuts for pecans and since I didn't have any walnuts. I also laid a sheet of parchment paper on my pan, put the butter on top of the parchment paper and then covered the patties completely with cheese before I fried them to give them an extra crispy crust since there isn't much to keep it together. but all in all it was delicious!!

As an Adkins follower I liked the sound of this.  I also require a high fiber diet.  I'm adding 2 tablespoons of minced onion and a clove of garlic for flavor, but to address the diet issue while providing a binder I'm adding 2 teaspoons of Psyllium Husk powder which adds 4g fiber for each serving.   Learned this trick while experimenting with making low-carb breads!

I really enjoy this entree. I found that it fell apart too easily the first time I cooked it so I added a tablespoon of almond flour to the mixture and the patties held together very nicely during cooking but it did not change the flavor.

Made exactly as recipe specified.  Extremely frustrating because the patties fell apart in the pan.  This recipe needs a binder.  I'll add bread crumbs next time.  Flavor was excellent, however.

This is a keeper! I was out of celery so I subbed finely chopped onion. And swapped the chopped walnuts for pecan chips that I had on hand. Will do the same again it was so good. A bit high  in calorie maybe but also high in healthy protein.

Yum! Quick, easy lunch. Omitted the walnuts, and added red pepper flakes and onion powder, DELICIOUS! Mixture wasn't runny at all, I just spooned it into a hot pan. Can't wait to make again!

These were so good...even my kids ate them. I did not have fresh Parsley...so I used dried Basil and dried Dill. I will be making these again. Like others said it was runny I thought I did something wrong but other reviews said the same thing so I will just pour it in a pile and spread it out next time instead of trying to make patties. Delicious!

I was skeptical about these, but I'm really tired of tuna straight out the can for lunch. I was wrong. These are so delicious, low carb and fast!  I hate celery and dill so I omitted those. I used olive oil for frying and seasoned with salt, pepper, onion flakes, and garlic powder. I also added a dash of panko for texture and cheddar cheese during the last minute of frying. Ate with peas and it was unbelievable. Next time I'll try with a salad or quinoa. Thanks so much for sharing, my new favorite lunch.

Loved it.  Served it open face over a homemade pita, mayo, and lettuce. Drizzled hot sauce and lime over the top.

This a great recipe for tuna patties! I have used it several times! It's easy, healthy, and tastes great. It's a family favorite that even my toddler enjoys.

Yum!!! This recipe sure beats tuna casserole and tuna salad sandwiches any day. These make for a hearty lunch and are great leftover. And very filling!

I omitted the walnuts. I also coated the patties in cornmeal before frying. Served with remoulade sauce (or for our picky kids: ketchup or ranch).

Omg scrumptious with a little mayo on top! Will definitely make again! Used powdered spices since I didn't have fresh, celery powder etc. Added onion powder and curry. Cooked with nonstick spray instead of butter

These are great! My husband (who hates tuna patties of all kind) asks for them so much they've become a regular part of our weekly rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!

I  thought that the patties were a bit mushier than I would've hoped.  I really  liked the walnuts in them- good taste and texture addition.

Very good; made it for Mom and she was pleased.  Need to find the vegan tuna, otherwise, have the rest in vegan substitute form.  Thank you.

yum. i doubled the recipe, used onions instead of celery, and used ground spices. when i was forming the patties, the mixture was runny. i squeezed the patty, trying to figure out how much liquid to squeeze out and how much to leave in so the patty wouldn't break apart. it involves some trial and error, but overall, all the patties came out pretty well formed and with good flavor. since i'm eating lower carb, i served the tuna patty on top of a spring mix salad. i would definitely make this again.

So fast and great tasting! Ingredients I have on-hand, too. I added red onion and bread crumbs (I didn't measure the mayo) while doubling the recipe for 4, and my kids asked for more. I questioned the walnuts at first, but they add nice flavor and crunch. We will make this again!!
