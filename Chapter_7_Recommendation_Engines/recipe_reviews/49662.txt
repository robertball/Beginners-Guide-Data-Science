Made this as a test run for an upcoming party. A guy that works for me got a promotion and he is a Florida Gator fan; this will be the featured drink at the party! LOL, it's gonna be a blast! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Sweet and simple. This drink is not strong which makes it great if you want a drink without the effects of drinking. If you want to "amp" it up add a little vodka.
