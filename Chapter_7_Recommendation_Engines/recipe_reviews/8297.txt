I've made this several times now. Always a hit and requested often!! Try adding fresh strawberries and pecans. Also, incorporate the cool whip when layering as well as on top. Wonderful!

This is a good dessert for a crowd.  I used cream of coconut pudding, skipped the bananas and walnuts, added canned peaches and dessert was a nice creamy triffle-like product which I served at a church function.  Hard to go wrong with this recipe, try to use a punchbowl that does not have ripples or designs on the side so one can see the layers.

The dish definatly was a huge hit... all though next time I will not include the Coconut.  My self as well as others agreed that the coconut does in fact add a good flavor... But the texture of Coconut just does not mesh well with the other ingrediants... 

Its kinda like all the other ingrediants are mushy goodness and the coconut is the sawdust...

This cake was so good. I had baked a cake that fell when my kids were jumping around in the kitchen and I didn't want to throw it away. I made this and the only thing I changed was I used pecans instead of walnuts(didn't have any). Yum yum yum. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Fun and pretty to look at. I took as a dessert for Thanksgiving. Many questions and comments. Delicious. Can't wait to make in the summer with fresh berries. We used a punch bowl ladle to scoop out portions. The next day, everyone just grabbed a spoon! Fun!

Great recipe! I used a store bought pound cake from the bakery section because it was just too hot to turn on the oven! I also used the coconut cream pudding instead of vanilla pudding and coconut flakes. And I omitted the walnuts for folks with allergies. I also used fresh blueberries and strawberries to garnish the top and make it festive for July 4th (see pic). It was a hit!

This is a wonderful dessert. I recently brought it to a ladies meeting at church and everyone raved at how pretty it was.I used pound cake and triple berry pie filling. I will be making this many times I'm sure. Thanks for such an easy, yet elegant dessert.

Have been making this for years and you can never go wrong.  Taste great and not really difficult to make.  I never use coconut.  I add extra pudding and pie filling.  No complaints from family or friends.  Always many questions and comments.
