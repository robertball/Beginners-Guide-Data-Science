I wanted to use some mixed berries that were past the "sell by" date, so I made this. I cut the recipe in half and needed to add a good bit more honey to make it sweet.  Perhaps it was due to my berries, but what I ended up with was a cold, almost slush drink.  No way I could have put it in a bowl and eaten it with a spoon.  Still good though.

Due to allergies I omitted the almonds.  I had to add a couple tablespoons more honey to this recipe to make it a crowd pleaser.  Also, add ice to keep this slush a bit more solid until serving.  Otherwise, all-natural ingredients and overall pleasing taste.  Nicely done.

It was okay... the serving sizes are huge, used the servings thingy to let me adjust the recipe for 5 people and I probably have enough for about 15..... My parents like it alot, me not so much and my brothers (both  under 10) really didn't like it... Im just not that crazy about it, Sorry!
