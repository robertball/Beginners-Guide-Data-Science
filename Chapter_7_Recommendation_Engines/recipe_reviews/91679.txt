I must confess that I did not love this dish at first.  But that is only because my whole life I have had a weird distaste for beans.  I just don't like the sensation of biting into one.  The worst part is that I'm a vegetarian!  Anyway, this recipe looked so good I decided to reassess my feelings about beans.  Well, I still don't like the texture.  But!  I threw the batch into the blender with some lemon juice, more garlic and garlic powder, and tahini to make hummus, which turn out to be just delicious.  So I say that although I changed the consistency a little, this dish is superb and only crazy bean-fearing folks would ever hold anything against it :)

I am on a sodium free, vegetarian diet (Fuhrman) and I was desperate for bean recipes.  This one hit the spot!  I love the sweetness of the pepper.  I used Braggs Liquid Amino in place of salt and it was perfect!  I also used 1/4 pound of dried beans (cooked) instead of canned.  I will be making this again!

I made this as a side dish to another recipe at this site...garlic chicken.  My husband and I loved it!  I wasn't sure what a gypsy pepper was so I used a yellow pepper and was amazed at what a great flavor this dish had.  Thank you.

Very flavorful recipe!  Now that I've made the recipe per the instructions, I might try to change it up a bit per my personal tastes.  Some ideas would be to add an additional type of pepper--maybe a hotter one or just green pepper?  I prefer only a hint of oregano flavor, so a pinch was more than enough.  One other option might be to add some minced garlic in the skillet with the onions and pepper.   As is, the recipe is a winner and tasty.  Have fun trying different spice blends geared towards your tastes. I did pack the extras in my lunch the next day and it reheats up very well in the microwave, which is an additional bonus! Thanks for sharing!

This is a very simple but very good dish!  A few other reviewers seemed to feel it was bland, however it's not meant to be a highly seasoned dish. I followed the recipe as written and the only addition I made was to dress it with a little drizzle of extra virgin olive oil which made it a little more moist and added a little more depth of flavor. I served it over hot pasta with some Parmesan. Delicioso!  (I suppose if you want to punch it up a bit, some fresh or canned roma tomatoes would fit in nicely as well.)

Very good! I substituted black beans (what I had) added a little cajun seasoning (along with other spices)and it turned out perfectly. Really great quick side dish, plus it's healthy!  The possibilities are endless.  Thank you!!

This was good.  I served it over toasted bread as kind of a bruschetta/open faced sandwich type of thing.  It was good but I felt it needed more flavor or something.  I like the idea of blending it up to make hummus though-that's great!

Pretty good, but needs more flavour. Another reviewer suggested cumin and I think that would go great with this.

Very tasty, and easy to make! Only giving 4 stars because I made modifications to the original recipe. I added 1 diced zucchini to give it more color/substance, and used a normal yellow pepper because I couldn't find the gypsy sweet pepper. Also used Italian seasoning, instead of just oregano, as well as some crushed red pepper and garlic to add a bit of spice/flavour. Paired it with couscous. Will definitely make again!

I was looking for a quick recipe for dinner tonight to replace our old standby of black beans and rice.....I was out of black beans, but had great northern.  This was so easy and good! I used a yellow bell pepper and added about 1 clove of minced garlic.  Served with jasmine rice, salad, and fresh pineapple.  Yummy!

You can easily go with hot pepper(s) instead of sweet.  For a spicy recipe, I added a clove of garlic (minced and sauteed with the onions), chopped a carrot, one cayenne and two serrano peppers from the garden, and splashed some low-sodium chicken broth over the mixture to moisten it.  It's quite a colorful dish.  (To start, leave out the salt if you simmer in chicken broth, and the un-initiated should probably stick to a single hot pepper.)
If you're not on a diet, top it off with your cheese of choice!

Here's my take: great solid recipe that is easily altered to what you have on hand. I like salt, it doesn't like me = no salt. This recipe helped me to use my gypsy peppers. Hum...I have some nice range free no nitrate happy chicken sausage; so I chopped it up & tossed it in as I was cooking. Along w/some zucchini as per another reviewer's suggestion. Then, I thought about the left over (range free,etc) chicken broth I had...& a bit of that went into the wok to loosen up the caramelization on the bottom. (Forgot that I turned up the heat a bit & it worked out! I raise the temperature because I have a lousy stove.) I added the oregano & a bit more cayenne. For *my* taste test, I tossed a bit of red pepper on my serving. I served it up to hubby over last night's brown rice (sans red pepper). More than satisfying & he gave it a thumbs up for his lunch tomorrow. FWIW: hubby is a non-carnivore except for happy fowl & seafood + hates too much spice/heat. Me: I'm the Bourdain of the family...

Gave it 5 stars even though I changed it according to what I had on hand, because I think it is very versatile, tasty, and easy! I used pinto beans, sweet colored peppers, and added a bit of tomato juice. We had it with rice, as a side dish, because my husband has to have meat! It would be a great vegetarian main dish with brown rice!

So so so good, and crazy simple too.  I left out the onion and was not shy with the oregano.  I could not find yellow gypsy peppers, but I had mini sweet peppers and those worked perfect.  I liked this so much I made it twice in one week, which I never do.

WONDERFUL!! This dish tastes of great flavor and spicyness. I made it for my Mom and Nana thay both loved it and so did I.  I used about 1/2 tbs of the cayenne pepper, was plenty, very spicy and great! Thank u for the recipe.

I liked it.  Had plenty of flavor for me.  Dear husband didn't like that the beans weren't swimming in some kind of sauce.  It was more on the dry side.

Ingredients good, except for oregano, which gives the dish a flavor that tastes a little off. Choose another...

I made one little change to this recipe and that was to cook my beans.  I find canned beans have a bitter back note.  Very tasty as  a side dish for backyard grilling.

I didn't read the directions. I just tossed it altogether, added lemon juice and fresh basil and it was tasty, although next time I will finely dice the onion and use less.  Or maybe I'll read the directions next time. But, it was so quick and easy to make. I liked it.

Very easy and quick to make. I added some shishido peppers and leeks from the garden for heat and texture and used it as a base for a mild sausage. Combination was great.

Made this as a side along with Salmon for dinner. I didn't have cayenne pepper so used ground Jalapeño pepper with lime.  Otherwise thought it was a very tasty side dish and so did the hubby. We will make it again.

High protein lunch for me.
I prefer making my peas vs canned.

I made some changes to this recipe and got rave reviews! First I doubled it (serves about 6-8 as a side dish). I added 4 cloves of garlic while I was sauteing  the onion and peppers. I did not add the beans to the pan for warming. Instead I rinsed and drained the beans, put them in a serving bowl and then added the warm sauteed onions, peppers and garlic. I then added about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper, salt and pepper to taste and chopped fresh basil instead of oregano.  Gently stir. I served this dish at room temperature. Everyone loved it! If you don't like spice then omit the red pepper flakes, or just add a small amount (1/8 tbsp).

I have made this several times now. It's excellent. I didn't think I liked beans but have found myself adding beans to the grocery list so I always have them on hand. I typically use red or yellow peppers but no changes to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

A simple and tasty side dish alternative.  I added about a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne which seemed to work for even the mild diners in our group.  I added a large pinch of oregano, at least a tsp. worth.

Will definitely make again--only thing I added was a splash of white wine at very end.  I am amazed some folks complained of blandness--thought it was quite tasty.
