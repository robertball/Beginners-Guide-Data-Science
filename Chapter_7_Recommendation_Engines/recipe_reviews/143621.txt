When I first made this recipe, I thought the taste of the mandarin orange was too overwelming.  However, when I heated up the left-overs the next day, I added some basil and it seemed to balance out the citrus taste.

I chilled this rather than serving it warm. We liked it, although I felt it was a bit bland.

This is a pretty good dish, although a little dry.  But then again, that's couscous.

I really loved this! I issued the pine nut couscous and added some roasted garlic and herb seasoning and it tasted great!

My BF liked it but I found it bland even though I added a tsp of dried basil to jazz it up.  I'll probably make it again but not often.
