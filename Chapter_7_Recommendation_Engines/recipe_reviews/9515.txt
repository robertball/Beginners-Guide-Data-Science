I love making this recipe during the holiday season.  In mid October, my family and I pick apples and we have an apple press made in the 1800's and we press our own apples to get apple cider and we use apple cider instead of apple juice and it is very delicious!!

FABULOUS! I just put all the ingredients in my crock pot on high for 4 hours and let it sit on warm all day afterward. Great drink to keep coming back to, especially at a holiday party in the winter!

This was a HUGE hit at my work's Christmas Eve potluck! I used apple cider instead of apple juice, and added slices of oranges and dried cranberries (which plumped up as it heated) for garnish and just kept it in a crock pot. Yummy!

I added a few whole allspice berries and some nutmeg, but didn't have whole cloves so I used ground instead. Rum complements this very well, also.

Much nicer hot drink than many ciders. Still, it left many feeling thirsty and needing water. Most everyone liked it but no one asked for more.Recipe made too much for my party of 12.

I had never had wassail, but my husband grew up with it and was intent on finding a recipe that matched the one in his memory.  Well, we found it!  All our friends were wowed by it.  At our holiday party, I saw many of them forego the adult beverages for this fruity drink reminiscent of childhood.  Wonderful!

Good. Sweet, so you wouldn't want it if you were thirsty, but a tasty drink for a cold night.

My husband and son loved it so much they couldn't stop drinking it.  I found it a bit sweet so second time around I am cutting back the sugar to just 1 cup.

I recently made this for a holiday party and the guests LOVED it!  They were begging for more even after we ran out and a couple people asked for the recipe!   I modified it slightly.  I followed step 1 (except I don't think I allowed it to cool for an hour) and then put the juices in the crockpot.  Then slowly added the sugar mixture.  Turned the crockpot on low for about 4 hours before the party. It was wonderful!

I made this in the crockpot and it was very, very good (though not as aromatic as I hoped).  I really didn't think I, personally, would like it as I'm not a big fan of hot drinks unless it's cold outside and they serve a function to warm me up.  The flavor of this was really nice, though.  My party guests enjoyed it a lot too.

I made this for our Thanksgiving celebration.  I halved the recipe and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup due to other reviewers' suggestions.  Very good.

This is a perfect holiday drink! Make sure you have enough people who want to drink it though, or it'll take forever to get out of the fridge.

That's because of the unnecessary sugar. Recipe works better with just cider, fruit juice, sliced oranges with cloves in them and cinnamon sticks.

It was quick and easy.  I used a whole jar of cinnamon sticks and 4x cloves and everyone loved this at my Christmas party.  Even the leftovers (little as they were) were delicious.  I plan to make this again...SOON!

This is a great basic recipe which can be tailored for one's personal tastes. I like it not too sweet with a bit of rum or brandy to give to the adults in the room, or keep it low key with a little water for the children!

Oh, this punch is so good.  Just right for the holidays.  I used fresh squeezed orange juice (mainly because we own citrus groves).  This recipe makes you think of great bygone days.  Warms your heart and spirit.

A great combination of flavors.  Half the lemon juice is what we like. Skimped on sugar, still delicious.

I made this for Christmas this year and my family loved it.
