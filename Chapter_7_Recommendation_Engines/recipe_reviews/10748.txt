These are so addictive!!  So far I have tried chocolate, lemon (my favorite!), strawberry, and cofetti white cake mix, all of them turned out yummy!  I made mine extra big, using an ice cream scoop.  I made sure the dough was nice and chilled before baking them, and they spread out just the right amount.  Since they were so large, I had to increase the baking time to 13-14 minutes.  They had a slight crust on the top, and still super soft on the inside, delicious with powdered sugar on top and a cup of tea!  On a side note, I tried this recipe with Pillsbury Cake mix (pudding in the mix version), and Betty Crocker Super Moist cake mix.  I have to say that the Betty Crocker mix turns out a bit better, the Pillsbury mix tends to come out a little doughy and flat.

I've been using this recipe as a base cream cheese cookie recipe for the last 6 years. It is great! I like to use it to bake cream cheese chocolate chip cookies with this variation: add an additional 4 oz. cream cheese, use duncan hines devil's food moist deluxe cake mix, and toss in chocolate chips to your heart's content. Chill and bake for 12 minutes.

Yum!  These cookies were great!  So easy and the kids had fun rolling them in the sugar. Only thing I changed was I tripled the vanilla.  1/4 tsp would never cut it in my family!  I wasn't sure if I should keep baking them longer after 13 minutes, but I took them out and they were perfect.   Just so you know what to look for: When you take them out of the oven the tops will be cracked.  The inside of the cracks will look moist and the outside will look dry. By they time they cool off, they're perfect.  I sprinkled them with extra sugar as they cooled and sent half the batch to the neighbor.  My hips will thank me in the morning.

When I made these cookies, I fell in love! They were so soft and moist.  I shared them with my boyfriend and his parents and they were all gone the next day! After making them the first time, I tried them again, but with different mixes.  I made some with chocolate mix (don't suggest) and then with lemon mix. The lemon cookies were excellent too!  This is definitely a recipe that will stay in my book for years and years to come!

These cookies are AMAZING!  I made half a batch as thumbprint cookies.  They tasted great, but looked a little ugly since the cookie spread out and the jelly didn't stay in one place.  So that was my practice batch that my husband and I ate (12 cookies in 12 hours...they're that good).

The next batch I put in sweetened, dried cranberries (like craisins) and dusted them with powdered sugar while they were still warm.  Fabulous!

My biggest tip if you're making these for gifts or company:

Right after they come out of the oven LEAVE THE HOUSE.  Then a few hours later, when you're sure they're cool, come back.  Box them up or put them in the cookie tin and deliver them RIGHT AWAY.  If you make them ahead a day or two there won't be any left for the person you made them for!

Where were these when I was pregnant and craved yellow cup-cakes?????  I thought these were a tasty little treat.  I do however think that the yellow cake mix was a little over powering.  I had two egg yolks so I did 12 oz. of cream cheese, 1/4 + two tbsp. of butter, etc.  Basically 1 & 1/2 of everything.  I should have doubled it, but I didn't want to stray too far from the recipe.  None the less they were still tasty, but I would double every thing but the cake mix next time.  Thanks Madonna!!

Very cream cheese tasting.  I was looking for a different and easy cookie that tasted great.  I loved the taste of these cookies - unlike any cookie I've had before.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

MAKE THIS RECIPE!!! this is the same recipe that my mom made every year while we were growing up, and it was by far our favorite Christmas cookie.  Now that I have two little boys, I am going to start making them every year too.  My mom always split the dough in two batches, and using food coloring dyed one batch green and the other batch red, and used a cookie press gun to make christmas trees, stars, etc.  Then sprinkled them with the little round red, green and white sprinkles for a very festive look.  And yes, they are soft and cakey, and sweet!  Go great with coffee too ;)

I loved these cookies....I used a holiday cake mix with red and green confetti and they turned out great-really festive!  For those of you who were looking for a more cheesecake type texture and/or flavor, you should've just made a cheesecake.

Talk about easy and quick!  I was browsing for something to use up some cream cheese and I found this.  I added more vanilla and half way through baking, I decided to make the rest like thumbprint cookies and added apricot jam.  That took these out of the ball park!  Sort of an instant kolacky!  Hey ... it might just do the trick if you're desperate for some Polish soul food in the wee hours. LOL

I used chocolate fudge cake mix.  They turned out very moist and we didn't think they were too sweet at all.  Just the opposite, in fact, which is a nice change.  :)

Wow, these were just not very good. The dough was a pain to mix. They burnt on the bottom for me as well. I was making them for a friend who loves cream cheese, but I would honestly be embarrassed to give these to her. I had to cover them with powdered sugar just to make them edible. Sorry, but I won't be making again. Ever.

Loved this recipe!  I wanted something easy, yet seem homemade and tasty.  I used devil's food cake mix which gave a strong flavorful taste.  The texture was somewhere between a cupcake and a cookie, and the inside remained soft the next day. I liked that it was easy to handle with my hands and roll into a ball.  I flattened them just a little to the shape I wanted.  I especially liked that it retained its shape during baking, which means they don't run into each other and I can cook more at a time.  To be a little fancy, I rolled a few of them in chopped walnuts.  I am eager to try this on other flavors.

I love this recipe! The only difference is that I add 2 cups of coconut to the dough. Not only does it stretch the recipe, they have an added taste!

These evil cookies have been nicknamed "baked crack" in my house because they are so good. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and tried double chocolate (chocolate cake mix, extra cream cheese, and a cup of chocolate chips). The double chocolate variation is amazing and is probably illegal in most states. Don't over bake these little jewels; I bake them exactly 11 minutes at 350 then remove from oven.

These ARE the BEST cookies in the WORLD. Just don't make them with yellow cake mix and don't over cook them.  Which is easy to do, they may not look done so you leave em in just a little longer and when you turn them over they are burnt. My oldest daughter is in the US Army and every year she wants me to send her these cookies for her birthday. Her Army buddies argue over which are the best. I've made Carrot, Spice, Chocolate and Red Velvet. This year I am trying the coconut just to surprise her with something different. She didn't get any last year because she was serving in Iraq.

Made these at Christmas but substituted Red Velvet Cake Mix instead of Yellow Cake Mix.  Also, made thumbprints in them & filled with cream cheese frosting.  They were really moist & good & festive.

I really liked the consistency of this cookie; just be careful not to overbake!  I was, on the otherhand, dissapointed that the cake mix overpowered this cookie.  First, I made a batch with the yellow cake mix-they smelled heavenly while baking.  Then, I made another batch using a lemon flavored cake mix I had on hand.  I though the lemon addition was good, but the cake mix again overpowered the cream cheese flavor.  Since I found this recipe so easy, I intend to experiment again with a chocolate cake mix, a white cake mix, and perhaps an angel food cake mix.  For perfect thumbprin cookies made with this recipe, take cookies out of oven (remember DO NOT overbake) and indent immediatly and fill with your desired filling.  I used canned cherries as another reviewer suggested, as well as rasberry preserves.  The rasberry came out wonderful with the lemon cookies.  Also, for storage purposes, leave your cookies out uncovered overnight, and then dust with a bit of powdered sugar.  This will help so they are not so sticky.  Although I did not give this a 5 star rating, I do believe that with some tinkering on my part, it will become a staple.  It is a desireable recipe because it is quick, easy, and utilized everyday ingredients.  Good luck to those that try this out.  Any other ideas for this would be wonderful!-CynDMn28 : )

Wow! Yup, wow, sums it up nicely. I did make some minor changes. I used a full teaspoon of vanilla, chocolate fudge cake mix from Betty Crocker, chocolate cream cheese (new product) and added chocolate chips. It was GREAT! This is only for true chocolate lovers, because it is rich and fudgy. Yum!

What I ACTUALLY said was... This were horrible.  After making several batches of different kinds of delicious cookies for xmas, I made these.  They were so disgusting I had to throw them out.  I can't imagine anyone eating more than one of these without getting sick, it is like sugar overload, and the texture is gross for a cookie.

Qiuck, easy and awesome!  Use yellow cake mix and chocolate chips for the best taste.  Took them into a company I was interviewing with right before Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  Everyone made a point to know my name and ask for more.  Family raved about them too.

After reading a lot of reviews for this recipe, I went ahead and tried it pretty much just as calls. I did add some extra vanilla ( I use pure vanilla, not extract ). I thought they were delicious! I will look forward to experimenting with other cake mixes and low fat cream cheese...has anyone tried this? The moist texture was delightful and the batch I made yesterday at about 3pm is now GONE (its not even 24 hours later...some of them were served at a bridal shower last night). If you like cream cheese flavor, I would guess you'd like this cookie! :)

The cookies came out great. I love these. My aunt used to make them and I have been looking for this recipe forever. The taste was awesome.

So easy and so good.  I made them into thumbprint cookies and put a dollop of preserves on top before baking.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used a strawberry cake mix & then rolled them in powdered sugar. It gave them crackle top that was very appealing. I also used a red velvet cake mix for a party that I hosted not long ago and several people ask for the recipe. The key is not letting the cookie over bake.

These cookies are excellent.  I've made a few variations on this recipe before including lemon, vanilla, chocolate, and red velvet with cream cheese frosting.  They all come out great.  For the holidays this year I made a large batch using Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix and chopped Andes mint candies.  They came out delicious!  I also use a whole egg for these cookies and don't have any problems with consistency.  If you are a crispy or chewy cookie fan then these will probably not be your favorite as they have a soft, cake-like consistency.

Best cookies ever!  Followed the recipe almost perfectly... the only change was that I used lemon cake mix instead of yellow & then I iced with lemon frosting while hot.  These were some of the most delicious cookies I have ever had! They taste just like I got them at the deli that is  down the road!!!!  They are definitely hard to mix and my mixer felt like it was about to burn out while trying, but they were worth it!  They also looked amazing (some reviewers said they weren't appealing to the eye but mine were)  So good!!!!

Instead of a birthday cake, my wife agreed that she could have cream cheese cookies today. This gamble paid off in spades! I added chocolate/peanut butter chips, and everyone just loved them! Unfortunately we grazed so much wandering around post and visiting friends that we couldn't devour these cookies ate the correct rate, but I am sure that we will more than make up for it tomorrow. In fact, I think that the kids can be assured there will be NONE left when they get back from school tomorrow.

easy to make, but that's it.  these are a thick type dough texture. i think the recipe calls for too much cream cheese. i had four people try them without telling them what i thought about them, and unfortunetly, the conclusion was "they're edible, but that's it".  i wouldn't of added chocolate chips and walnuts to a cake mix in the first place, so why i thought this could be good by adding cream cheese as welll is beyond me!

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! I made these last night and boy were they good! I used chocolate cake mix and added chocolate chips and oh man did they hit the spot. Very moist and delicious, with a unique taste from the cream cheese. The only problem I had was the sticky-ness of the dough, it stuck to my beaters so much it took me forever to get it all off! Not sure why it did that.. but still, they were delicious. Cooked them like 12 minutes though because I don't like them too doughy, and they turned out great! Super moist and everything!

OH WOW, these were sinful! Do not even tempt yourself with these, thinking about them I have gain weight.lol But really these were amazing, Im a chocoholic so when I saw that people used choc cake mix, I had to also. I also added 4oz more of cream cheese and used a teaspoon of vanilla in addition to the 1/4. I think next time I will use even more of the vanilla though. Then I used semi sweet chocolate chips and MMMMMMMMMMM!! Also I made them to my liking and rolled half the dough in powdered sugar, and YOU MUST TRY IT!! so heavenly!

So sweet. (I followed the recipe exactly-something I rarely do) I'll keep the recipe as it's not an awful recipe, but not that great for cookies. We're using it as the "shortcake" for our strawberry shortcakes with plain strawberries and milk on top. It helps cut that sweetness.

I first fell in LOVE with this recipe when I made these cookies when I was 12 years old.  I remembered them as a favorite cookie of mine so I wanted to make them for my children to see if they would like them too (my son LOVES cheesecake).  My first batch "flopped" - the dough was so sticky and the teaspoon drops were so unattractive - they were so bumpy and lumpy and rough looking!  I even over baked them because the tops never looked golden - big mistake - because when I checked the bottoms, the cookies were already burnt.  So I slightly flattened and smoothed the remaining teaspoonfuls of dough for a more attractive appearance.  LOVE-LOVE-LOVE the flavor and texture!  The cookies actually melted in my mouth!  Simply AMAZING!  My son and daughter - both picky eaters - even LOVE them!  Just like I remembered...

Very good recipe.  I used Duncan Hines Butter Yellow cake mix and they turned out so delicious! I was supposed to bring these to a cookie exchange, but I'm going to keep them.  I'll make something else to give away!

I was really skeptical as I was making these, but they're delicious! The only problem was I used my electric handmixer, and the dough was so thick it was burning up the motor. My husband is not a big "cookies" person and he's easily eaten half of these! only recommendation: a little more vanilla. :)

update: I've been making these for years now, using various box mixes. If you do chocolate, dip them in powdered sugar. :)  also, I burned up another hand mixer, so do be wary of using one on this recipe! I use my stand mixer only now.

This is the best cooky I have ever made - my daughter calls this her "childhood cooky."

Try making it with pineapple cream cheese.  It's outrageously good.

I promised my 4 yr. old that we could make cookies after his nap. One look in the pantry revealed we had no sugar. Never fear, All Recipes is here!
So obviously I did not set out to make these cookies, but I am sure glad I did. I set out the ingredients before he woke up and let him do the magic. They were really fun to make with him because you just kinda throw it all together! Not only that... they were great! My husband and three other sons had them gobbled up that same night.
Yes they are cakey, duh, look at the ingredients! In my opinion that is what makes them so yummy.
Due to the state of my kitchen I did have to make a few subs. I used half cream cheese and half sour cream. I only had butter cake mix on hand so I used that with a healthy dose of vanilla. 
One more thing... We made them right before Valentine's day so my son wanted to add red sprinkles. It was a stroke of genius, it really added something to the otherwise blah look.

These are truly amazing. They are best warm, the middle is so moist and good. Tastes like a cheesecake sugar cookie! The only things I did different was to triple the vanilla extract, and the cake mix I used was "Butter Recipe Golden" because that's what I had. I also rolled the dough balls in sugar before baking.

Followed it to a t and they were awesome.  They tasted like "gooey butter cake cookies" (others from St. Louis will know all about gooey butter cake!!)

They were very gooey so you have to let them set on the cookie sheet before removing them.  They won't store easily either (at least for me... they stick together) so you might want to make them when they are going to be enjoyed right away.

I think made according to the directions this cookie might be somewhat bland.  So, I used a white cake mix, added orange extract, strawberry flavored Craisins and chopped pecans.  I was surprised they didn't spread when baked.  They are yummy morsels!  I will make again soon.  *Edit* I made these again with a coconut cake mix and finely chopped pecans.  Hubbys boss said they were f'ing awesome cookies! And they were gone in no time flat.

I love these cookies because you can be creative with them!  Try different cake mixes, or top them with frosting. I've used cinnamon swirl mix and chocolate mix. Both were crowd-pleasers!

These cookies were not popular with my family...I had a few family members confirm that this cookie was not what we expected it would be.  I expected a cream cheese/cheese cake consistency and flavor.  Instead, the cookie was very doughy and tasted more like clumps of yellow cake mix. The next day, the cookies had more of a desired consistency.  The cream cheese flavor was still very understated to me.  I would not use this recipe again unless I expected to get a "yellow cake mix" flavored cookie.  I think that my box of cream cheese could have been better used in a cheesecake.

I tried it with devils food cake and threw in some chocolate chips turned out pretty good tasted like brownie batter very moist on the inside and very rich... mine however did not spread out at all while they baked this could be because I rolled them instead of dropped them... but they still turned out good... I am looking forward to trying them with another type of cake mix.. and next time I will drop them instead of rolling them to see if that makes a difference

These cookies are pretty decent for how simple it was, it kind of tasted like mini cakes and it tasted a bit artifcial but after all it was made from cake mix.  I would probably put in pecans or other nuts to make it taste less artificial.

I was very skeptical at first but these turned out awesome! I was all out of vanilla extract so I put in about 2tsp of black raspberry schnapps which gave it a slight raspberry overtone. They were sooo good.

i really like this recipe. but for those of you that do not like a cake-like cookie, this is not for you.  it taste like the top of a cupcake, which is the best part. i used devils food cake mix, added 4 extra oz. of cream cheese and threw in a few choc. chips. my family loved it!

I just LOVED these cookies, as do that kids. Such a sweet cream cheese taste. My husband who NEVER eats sweets, liked these alot. He thinks they taste a little like a pineapple upside down cake. Anyway, They are fabulous. Thank you!

A Christmas Cookie Exchange Party favorite!!!  I added extra vanilla extract + replaced one package of cream cheese with neufchatel cheese.  This recipe is especially good using Devil's Food cake mix, too.

These are excellent!! An easy cookie that tastes divine. I followed the recipe exactly. I did add choclate chips to a portion (perfect)and frosted a few with some cream cheese frosting I already had. All versions were great. My only complaint is that there was no warning about not being able to resist eating to many :)

Pretty good little cookie.  I used 2 t. vanilla extract and may use a little more the next time.  Used a regular yellow cake mix.  Wonder how these would taste with a French Vanilla cake mix?  Used a generous teaspoon and rolled into a ball instead of dropping. Chilling the batter makes it much easier to handle and 30 mins is not long enough.  I rolled the balls in raw sugar crystals prior to placing on cookie sheet.  I greased the cookie sheets as instructed, but I'm not sure that you need to do this.  This is a keeper!

Okay. So at first, I was a little unsure about these cookies. First, my "teaspoon drops" were not very attractive when baked so I actually used spoonful size balls which appeared much smoother after baking. The taste was reminiscent of cheesecake and at first seemed a little bland. However, the mild taste turns out to be mildly  addictive. Perfect with a good cup of coffee. I'm planning to make more this weekend. One batch with chocolate chips for decor and one batch I am going to make a thumbprint and fill with raspberry preserves. I think I just need my sweets with a little more pizazz.

These didn't taste much like cream cheese, rather they tasted like little blobs of cake mix.  Also, the bottoms burned before the rest of the cookie was cooked through.  I won't make these again.

Turned out fabulous and moist...very addictive...trully melts in your mouth..mom who isnt too keen on chocolate but loves cheese couldnt stop eating them...and she's a weight watcher !

Oh my, I made these for a meeting and they were gone within 10 minutes. I used pineapple cake mix and added crushed pineapple (drained) and coconut. I had no problems with the dough after refrigerating and using a cookie scoop.  Can't wait to experiment with more flavors. Great and quick recipe!

These turned out fantastic with just two minor changes. I used 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup cake mix in place of the cake mix box. And I added 1 whole teaspoon vanilla. I baked 13 minutes on parchment paper and they came out beautifully. Very tender, lots of flavor and a hint of cream cheese. These would be luscious with lemon cream cheese icing drizzled on top and fresh berries.

The key to these cookies is powdered sugar!!! I always parchment paper the pan , got to watch these because the bottoms will burn easy, and sprinkle before and after with powdered sugar.

I've been making these with my mother since I was a kid. In my variation, I add more vanilla and raisins. Love this recipe. The cookies are so addicting and easy to make. I think next time I'll try chocolate cake mix and butterscotch morsels. The options are endless!!

A yummy cookie with endless possibilities!  The cookies are delicious as is or get creative with different cake mix flavors.  My favorite was lemon cake mix with cranraisins and white chocolate chips.  We've also done german chocolate cake mix with coconut and pecans and white cake mix with chocolate chips.  Next one to try will be carrot cake mix with raisins and pecans.

These were good!!  I used sugarfree devil's food cake mix, and added chocolate chips and butterscotch chips.  Also since others have said they burned easily I reduce the heat to 350 and take them for 12 minutes.  They are cakey but they're made from cake mix!

These tasted really weird.  I used a chocolate cake mix.  I rolled the dough into a tube and put it in the freezer for about a half hour, then sliced the dough into cookies.  They looked ok, and people seemed to like them but everyone agreed they tasted odd.

I have to say after reading all of the reviews, I was slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but they just tasted like a cupcake without frosting. I used 12oz of cream cheese per some of the reviews, but I still could not taste the cream cheese.   I used chocolate fudge cake mix which made a nice chocolately cookie, but I didn't care for warning everyone that grabbed one that it wasn't going to be like a cookie, more so cake.  It was a nice simple recipe, but I don't think I would make again

i really liked these. my friend gave me the same recipe years ago. i used the reviews and added raspeberry jam to one batch and cherries to the other, using vanilla cake mix. i liked using the lemon cake mix better than the vanilla, i agree you would need to at least triple the amount of vanilla extract.

These were some great cookies. I made them for a church function and I was asked for the recipe numerous times. I only had 4 oz. of cream cheese, and I upped the vanilla to 1/2 tsp. These were soooo good! So soft and chewy with a great vanilla and subtle cream cheese flavor, and sooo EASY! Deeelicious! Thanks!

I am unused to these kinds of cookies. I've never had cream cheese cookies before. They tasted a bit like those store cookies where they're completely white and soft, and have huge dollops of frosting on them. The mixture of butter and cream cheese (which makes up 90% of this recipe's taste--if you ignore the wave of cake mix taste) gave me a bit of a headache. However, even though these are not my type of cookies, I gave them a four star because this recipe is fool-proof. There was nothing that was missing (or lacking). It's just a simple cream cheese cookie that will satisfy any cream cheese cookie craving.

These cookies were fine, but definitely not great.  There's a slight after taste that I didn't care for.

Not very impressive. I won't be making these again. Although they are quick and easy, next time I'll go through all the time and effort to make regular cookies.

Mmm Mmm...these turned out great.  We have tried lots of variations, like butter pecan cake mix, adding rum flavored extract and chopped pecans!  To say this batter is stiff is an UNderstatement, had to mix by hand, but totally worth it.

These are not cookies. Well, out of cake mix, it was not that surprising that they are cakey. Too buttery, too...

We realy enjoyed these cookies! I mixed half of the dough with 2 tsp organic cocoa ,little rum extract(1/4 tsp),4 tbsp icing sugar and chopped peacans.They were great. Next time I will make all with cocoa and maybe try with some chopped hazelnuts.

I followed the recipe using a strawberry cake mix (i was thinking "strawberry + cream cheese" combo could be promising) and even made a few w/ some choc. chips in them. In the end, I was really disappointed with the result.  The cream cheese is just a weird addition to the recipe..maybe it would have been better without it.  Also, it seemed like all I could taste was the cake mix + the cream cheese. Granted, that's what it's made out of, but maybe some sugar would have helped? very unsure about this recipe.

These cookies taste great but are definitely not big on looks (I wouldn't bring them to a pot luck). Despite this my husband ate them all withing 12 hours. They also don't have any added sugar except what is in the cake mix so that is a definite plus. I think I will take the advice of others and experiment with different cake mix flavors.

I used a lemon cake mix and the cookies had a faint lemon taste.  I rolled the cookie dough balls in powdered sugar before baking and that's the only thing that saved them.  They were edible but not a favorite.

The first time I had these cookies I was about 10 yrs. old, my mom made them. That was 32 years ago. My mom is gone now, but the cookies she introduced us to are still with us. I make them every year, and now so does my sister. They are a tradition in my family. We have never ever encountered anyone who has not fallen in love with them. Try them, enjoy them...but watch out...THEY ARE ADDICTIVE!!!!

These were unbelievably easy to make and looked great. However, they tasted like cake batter nobody would eat them in my family. I am a nurse, so I took them to work and they just sat there...the nurses wouldn't even eat them!

We made these into thumbprint cookies, with my daughter pushing her thumb into them and then baking, but these cookies are such great risers that the indentations disappeared, so we just pressed them in when they were still warm.  We used raspberry and strawberry jam.  Excellent!  We'll try the chocolate version someone recommended next time.  Thanks!

These were excellent.  Lots of cheescake flavor and soooo easy.  You could get about 50 cookies if you dropped them by teaspoon (as the recipe states).  I dropped by tablespoon and got about 36. Next time may try the "lite" cream cheese and cake mix to cut some fat. Buy some cherry pie filling and drop a cherry on each cookie(after making an indention while the cookie is warm) and they will taste just like cheesecakes!Delicious!

The kids weren't sure if they were going to like "cream cheese" cookies, but changed their minds once they tasted the cookies, they loved them!!  They are chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside, a big hit in our household!!
