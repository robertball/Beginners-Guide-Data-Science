I substituted spinach in for the greens, coconut milk for the hemp milk.  I omitted the cashews for the sake of calories; I'm sure they would have been delicious.  I cut the quinoa down to 1 cup.  Then I cut the whole recipe in half, so it made two servings.  On the first night, I made it cold, following the recipe.  It was zesty and filling.  On the second night, I sauteed all of the vegetables, and heated up the beans and leftover quinoa.  I layered it all together with the cold cilantro sauce, which warmed up nicely.  I loved it both ways!  Very tangy!  If you don't like any heat at all, maybe leave out the jalapeno pepper, or at least the seeds.  I'll make this again.  Very easy!

The sauce may with out a doubt be the best part of this recipe!! we bought a chicken as a back up in case it wasn't good, we still haven't touched the chicken and have been fighting over the leftovers.

I made as written but used almond milk.  This is was ok at best. I like the base but feel it needs a lot more flavor. Next time I will add lime juice to the sauce or perhaps  salsa verde.

I used lightly salted cashews and removed the cilantro. Next time I'll go with unsalted cashews because the sauce was a little too salty once finished. This recipe was so yummy! This is the first time I've used quinoa in a recipe and now I am hooked! The flavors were well balanced and the avocado was the perfect final touch. I will definitely be making this again!

We made this as a family meal with 6 kids ranging from 3 to 18, and it was not a hit. Overall there were a few that liked it and a few that barely picked at it with one of mine opting to go to bed instead of eating another bite (we don't force them to eat but we don't offer to make anything else if they don't like what's for dinner).  If we were to make it again, we'd skip the cilantro.

I made mine without the red pepper, black beans and green  chiles; instead I used Verde salsa, shredded carrots, tomato, chicken (opps, that's not vegan!!!)and mushrooms, which I had in my fridge the day I prepared this dish. I must say it is DEVINE!!! I also squeezed fresh lime juice over the salad ;-)

Absolutely delicious. I added corn and peas and used radicchio instead of romaine lettuce. Thank you for the recipe.
