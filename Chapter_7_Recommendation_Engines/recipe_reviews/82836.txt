This is a good recipe excpet it forgot to say how much mayo to add. This recipe make quite a bit. I did not add enough mayo at first, I recommend about 3/4 cup because the tofy will absorb some. I used sweet hot mustard and that was really good. This is a good tofu recipe, I will be making it again. You may want to play with the recipe alittle to add more taste. My husband liked it my 12 yr old was indifferent. If you like tofu, you should like this.

I loved this recipe. As a vegan it was an excellent replacement for the less healthy egg version. I found it was good on a bed of lettuce as a light snack as well!
