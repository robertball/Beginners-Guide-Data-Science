This is a nice recipe where you can play with the type of cheese you have in the house. I used feta herbed creamy goat cheese and a bit of old cheddar and it was pretty tasty. Plus I added some chicken breast and garlic to the dish.Kids loved it.

Delicious with the fresh peppers. Alas I confess I omitted the fresh cream to keep the fat content down but the melting cheese was flavourful and rich enough. I'll make it again!

This recipe was tasty rich and colorful. No way does it serve 4 even with large servings. This recipe would be easy to cut in half and I would reccomend doing so unless you literally have a small army to feed.

I really liked this. If you serve it immediately you get a pasta with lots of delicious sauce. I ended up topping it with some bread crumbs and extra cheese and popping it under the broiler. The pasta soaked up all the sauce but the outstanding flavor was still there. Thank you for the recipe.
