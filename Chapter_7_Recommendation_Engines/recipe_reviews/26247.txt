This was a Great Sauce!!! I used italian link sausage, sliced and browned with the garlic. I used portabella mushrooms because that is what I had. I used 1/4 cup of wine and 3/4 cup water. I used less wine because I only had red cooking wine and I know it is stronger and saltier then regular red wine.Update- I made this again and had everything except used Italian diced tomatoes and got brave and used the half cup of Red cooking wine and it was super - It makes the perfect amount of sauce. Thank you for sharing your recipe

This sauce rocks! I followed the recipe to a "T" (doubled) - except for the simmering step, I threw it all in the crockpot on low for several hours. SO Delicious! We will be making this sauce often!

I've been making this recipe for years (handed down Italian).  I haven't used mushrooms before (so I look forward to adding that.)  One thing you might try that makes this recipe absolutely perfect, cut sausage links into 1/2 bites (brown with onions).  Add 1/2 cup celery.  When sauce has simmered (at least 2 hours) add whole pepperoni cut into 1/2" pieces.  When serving pasta, ladle sausage and pepperoni separately and serve with freshly grated permesan cheese.  You will NEVER make this differently.

I didn't see in the recipe where it said to add the green onions, so I added them with the mushrooms.  After simmering for an hour, they had sort of a weird slimy texture.  That said, the flavor of the sauce was very good; next time I'll try it with regular onions.

This is the best sauce.  After making this I can say I make my own pasta sauce now.  It has spice, tang and it awesome.  I've made it and put it in lasagna, spaghetti, and also used it as the sauce on my french bread pizza's.  Will keep this and continue to use it over and over again!!!!  Thanks Carliey...what a great recipe!!!!!!

This recipe is AWESOME!... I used fresh
basil and fresh oregano instead of the dried herbs, and using fresh herbs really brought out the flavor. This is my favorite sauce and I look forward to making it again.

Definitely a good flavour, but WAY too much red pepper, it overrides the rest of the sauce.  I hope after it rests for a day it'll be a little milder.

Fantastic sauce, I used yellow onions, and instead of just link sausage of I went half and half. I cut the sausage out of the casing on three sausages and sliced three it was more meat than called for but it was very good, great texture. I will defiantly be making this a lot more. It freeze real well too, I took some out of the freezer and nuked it for 5 minutes stirred it then gave it another two minutes, and it was still great.

This is one forgiving delicious recipe. I used a lb. of Dean's hot sausage with the hamburger, lots of finely chopped  of garlic and red onion, a good merlot fresh herbs and in the last 4 minutes fresh sage. No sugar. Toppped with Peccoronio. Big hit!

This is a very special sauce, extremely restaurant quality. I used half of a regular onion instead of green (sautéed with garlic) and omitted the mushrooms. I also used a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of the 14 oz stewed and sauce since that's what I had on hand. I personally thought it was a little sweet so I might cut back on the sugar next time. Could have been the wine I used...it was a mild red table wine and may have been too sweet. I would recommend adding the sugar to taste rather than right from the get go. Tomato paste and sweet sausage also added sweetness, so I may just use spicy next time. But this is now my favorite sauce of all I have tired! Make sure to have bread for dipping and sopping it up!

Pretty good sauce indeed. Used less mushrooms because I didn't have more (yet my son still managed to locate them and deem the sauce not to his liking :P) and omitted the red pepper flakes. And  the water. (Figured I would add as needed, but did not need.) Even more flavourful the next day (it's true). Makes a nice sized batch - definitely more than four servings as the recipe lists.

Excellent sauce. I added 1/2 an onion to the recipe.  Also, the green onions, but not referred to in the directions, just the ingredients.

Even with some necessary empty pantry creative ingredient substitutions; this sauce was amazing! I doubled the batch but used only 1 1b of sausage. I also used sweet yellow onions in lieu of green onions, only one can of stewed tomatoes, 3 cans of paste, 1 of sauce, 1 tbsp of red wine vinegar with remaining water to replace 1/2 cup of red wine. I also didn't add all the sugar, I may try it with all of it next time just to see what changes but it seems like quit a bit. Maybe me substituting the paste vs sauce and stewed adjusts the sweetness of the sauce. It was excellent. We really enjoyed it!!

This recipe is definitely best the next day so that it can mellow a bit.  And although I was a bit hesitant about the large amount of sugar in the recipe it definitely needs it if you don't want your sauce too spicey.  I will definitely make this again but next time I think I'll use a 28 oz can of stewed/diced tomatoes.

We call this the arrabiatta sauce dinner and it's better than what you can get at the Olive Garden or the Macaroni Grill!  When I'm in the mood for Italian, this is what hits the spot. It's a simple recipe to make and everybody fights over the leftovers.  Now that's a compliment!

This was good, but it was a little bit too sweet for me. I'll probably halve the sugar next time.

I absolutely love this recipe! I am a firm believer in make it exact before giving a review but I made one change - no mushrooms!! The one thing missing from my recipe list was a good tomato based sauce, after a few failed attempts with other recipes I found this one and will never look back. I make my own homemade Italian sausage and this sauce is its perfect mate. Thank you for sharing, we really love it!!

Unusually enough for me, I made this with hardly any changes (omitted the water) and it was excellent.  I will certainly make it again, but will make a couple of changes.  Use petite diced tomatoes instead of the stewed ones as those chunks were larger than I like. Also, although I like spicy food, this was a little much FOR SPAGHETTI SAUCE...I will probably back off a bit on the red pepper flakes.  Overall very good!

Fantastic... just a few adjustments:

No sugar
Add entire box of Boursin Cheese
Add about 20 fresh basil leaves... (torn in half)
Double the liquids

Super Yummy! Subbed out sauce and paste for  little left over pre made sauce I had. Used 28oz of tomatoes diced and no water. Also reduced the sugar. But the hubs loved loved loved this one! Will be adding it to the rotation!

I made this a few weeks back. I had everything on hand minus the stewed tomatoes. I used crushed tomatoes and this came out delicious. I would totally make this again.

This was just ok, I have had better. I found the tomato sauce flavour to be too strong and made the sauce too thick. I'll stick to my usual sausage sauce recipe. Though each to their own, as my husband loved this sauce and would probably rate it 5 stars. If I were to make it again I'd probably ditch the tomato sauce or at least dramatically reduce the amount, and add more tomatoes and water to make up the liquid lost. Might give it another go for my husband's sake - we'll see.

I really loved this; thank you for sharing.  I make pasta sauces quite often, it's one of my favorite things to eat.  My daughter had invited a couple friends for dinner because they were "craving" pasta.  We are vegetarian but all of them aren't, so I thought I would use vegetarian sausage and found this recipe.  Four teenagers slurped down spaghetti (as I did), it was delish and so easy to make.  Thanks again.  You rock!

This is gorgeous!! I didn't brown the garlic & sausages but I did wiz  them round in the oil to start them cooking. I didn't want to seal the sausages, so the flavour of the sauce would infuse in to them I also chopped them up as they were huge from the deli. I added some fresh chopped basil on top when serving plus parmesan. And the writer I right, it is even better the next day. I keep going back for 2nds lol. Enjoy x

Excellent sauce. Made as written except for the stewed tomatoes. Used diced tomatoes instead.

Decent taste, but I felt the red wine flavor burned through most of the other flavor. Could have been because I used a merlot I had around. Be sure not to overdo it on adding meat, or you will wind up with something that looks a lot more like a goulash.

Great tasting sauce. I used hot Italian sausage and skipped the red pepper flakes. Also used 1 cup of water and omitted the red wine as I didn't have any on hand.

Love it! I halved the cooking time, since I was using it for a lasagna, so it was going to cook another 40 minutes in the oven anyway. The sausage I chose was fresh sweet Italian. I used fresh basil and oregano, rather than dried. Overall: a savory, sweet and complex result! I'll use this one again.

This got rave reviews from DH! I made a double batch. I tried to make it as close to the recipe as possible, but I just didn't have everything so I subbed: white onion for green and sauteed it with the garlic and herbs in the beginning of the recipe, omitted mushrooms because we dislike, did not add the sausage (because I made meatballs), and used half the amount of wine called for. I partially did this because it was an expensive wine, and I wanted to have enough left for us to drink with dinner :) I also forgot to put the water in, oops! so my sauce was thicker than it was supposed to be, but we like it thick so it was fine. Even at half the amount, there was plenty of wine in it to give a gorgeous flavor to the sauce. I will say, don't skimp and buy a cheap $2 bottle of wine. Get something nice, and have the rest of the bottle with dinner. Cook with the same wine you drink! I used one that was 50% each of Cab and Syrah and the flavor in the sauce was to die for. I would recommend sticking with a Cab, a Syrah, or a blend that is mostly cab. You could use a Merlot too, but a blend will add more complexity to the flavor. I will be making this for years to come... Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

A good sauce.  I think it would be better with regular onion vs. green onion.  A little strong flavored and heavy, even with using a 30oz. can of stewed tomatos.

WOW  My hubby does NOT really like alot of pasta.  He ate about half of this and made sure to mention how much he'd like the leftovers for his lunch!! This is really easy, cheap, and oh so tasty.  Takes some time on the stove (or the crockpot - which I will try next time), but so worth it. I did add the celery as mentioned in one of the reviews and had no mushrooms.  Thanks for a great addition to our menus and our budget.

made this for NFC Game . The guys loved it! Browned the sausage in cast skillet while the other ingredients cooked in roaster. Mogan David Concord is the wine I used as it is sweet. This allowed me to cut back on the suger by 1/2. Very good recipe!

I thought this was good but my husband absolutely loved it. Tweaked the seasoning a bit. Poured it over some cooked pasta and topped with Provolone and parmesan cheese and put under the broiler.

Good recipe.  I thought the spiciness was perfect.  I actually used spicy sausage.  I took the sausages out of the casings and crumbled it.  This is a great variation of just browning sausage and adding jarred/canned tomatoes.
