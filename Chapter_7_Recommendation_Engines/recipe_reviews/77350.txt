This is the classic Lemon Ice box pie found in practically any southern restaurant.  It is easy and delicious.  Most in the south use Meringue for the top and the vanilla wafers for the crust, but both are good.

This pie didn't turn out the way I thought it would. I made it for Thanksgiving and thought it would disappear just as all the other pies. But no one like it. All you could taste was the Eagle Brand milk. It was a mess!!!

I'm not sure what happened with the pp and why it didn't turn out, but mine came out terffic. I made it for Easter and there wasn't one piece left. I added a little more lemon juice just because we like it a little tarter - but all in all a very easy recipe with great results!

This is a very tart, tangy pie and is absolutely delicious. It is very much like the lemon pie sold at PickO'theChick restaurants. Theirs is made with a crust of whole vanilla wafers.That works with this recipe, too. ENJOY!
