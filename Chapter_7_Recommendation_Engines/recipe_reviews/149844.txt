Wonderful recipe. If you don't want your sauce to become too runny, cook your endives the day before, so they can drain well. I'm Belgian too and this is one of our favorite Belgian dishes. :-)

This recipe turned out exactly how my father always made it. I'm also Belgian, and it had been years since I've had this! It's AMAZING. Definitely one of my favorite meals ever. The sauce tastes amazing and complements perfectly with the flavor and texture of the endives. Will make over and over again! Thank you for posting this recipe. I will have my American friends try it ;)

I first had this while living in Gent, Belgium. It's fantastic! I would have never had this otherwise.

My husband and I loved it!  Next time I'll try steaming the endive instead of boiling to retain more nutrients.

Urheka!  I found a recipe for Endive.  As soon as I can find some endive in a local market I'll be sure to make this and write a review of the recipe.  Do you know anyting about a dish made with cabbage, ham and spaghetti pasta?

We eat this dish at least twice a month.  We never boil the endive though.  Just wrap the fresh endive (cut in halves) with ham, then top with the béchamel and cheese.  I bake it at 200°C for 20 minutes and it is cooked perfectly every time.   Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Thanks for sharing this classic recipe!
The cream and cheese in this recipe makes for a nice contrast to the sharp taste of the endives.

Absolutely delicious!  We used prosciutto instead of deli ham and didn't really measure the spices.  My husband would like to replace some of the milk with Belgian beer next time we make this.  I cooked the endive, put it in ice water, then gently squeezed out the excess water into a towel before wrapping with the prosciutto.  Ours did not turn out watery at all!

My Dad went to Belgium for a work trip when I was younger and came back making this recipe. It has a distinctive flavor and is a family favorite.  We nicknamed it “Belgian Hotdogs”. Nutmeg and fresh guyere cheese is key. Also, I cut the endives in half. I think this sauce would be awesome on anything.

I thought that the endive would be expensive for some reason.  It was not at all.  $1.69 lb I believe.  Next time I will steam the endive or cool it and squeeze it out to remove the excess water.  I read other reviews too late to pick up that tip.

I did make some changes...steamed the endive, added about 1/8 cup white wine and used 1/2 cup 1% milk. I used a cheddar and gruyere cheese combo from Trader Joe's. To assemble I layered the endive (separated), slices of ham steak, and poured the bechamel overtop. I sprinkled a little swiss and gruyere cheese overtop and broiled at 400degrees for under 10 minutes. Fancy and delicious!

I was an exchange student in Belgium for my senior year of high school and I was really taken with chicon au gratin while I was over there.  This recipe was nearly perfect, but I found I had to double the sauce amount and I added a splash of white wine to the sauce. :)  I found that way, it more closely resembled the chicon au gratin I'd had in Brussels.
