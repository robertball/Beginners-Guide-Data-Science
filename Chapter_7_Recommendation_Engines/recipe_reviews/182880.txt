Great way to use beets and bok choy.  Also very pretty.  I used mini bok choy and garnished the dish with the cut off ends - they looked like flowers.

Loved this warm salad!  I didn't have peanut oil so I used sesame oil instead and it was very good.  Will try it again with a little less oil/butter to Save on calories.

I despise bok choy, but it came in my CSA box, so I decided to make use of it. I used one head of regular bok choy, 3 beets and 3 cloves garlic. Knowing that I find bok choy more edible when cooked with bacon, I subbed 2 Tbsp bacon grease for the peanut oil/butter. Used more like 1/2 C cheese and also added three small green onions and about 1.5 Tbsp balsamic vinegar dressing. I found it edible, which says a lot given my hatred for bok choy. Hubby liked it.

The tastes are good, but the family couldn't get past the pink cheese. The beets  bled into everything.  I think this one is not going to happen again.

I doubled the recipe and it was enough for a main course for 2.  I added a bit more feta though because hubby and I are cheese-aholics lol I also used garlic butter instead of regular and then added just 2 cloves of minced garlic to the pan (don't forget I doubled the recipe).  Fantastic :)

Simple dish, yet tasty. I even cheated with whole canned beets and it was still really flavorful.

This was easy and delicious, with a well balanced blend of flavors.  I used sesame oil since I didn't have peanut oil, and I also omitted the butter to cut down on fat--still a winner!

This was absolutely delicious! Such a great alternative to the typical use of bok choy and beets, and my entire family loved it!

Very fun way to use seasonal veggies. I used fresh roasted beets, which made the pink/purple color very deep and beautiful. The cheese turning pink is a little strange, but loved the flavor added by the feta.

This was simple and delicious- a great recipe for those who (like myself) have not cooked with beets before.

Delicious!! I had to add some garlic salt but other than that this was absolutely fabulous. I am currently contemplating going for the leftovers in the fridge...

This was great!  I didn't use butter and probably didn't put as much bok choy in as it called for. Added some spinach that I needed to use. This is an R (repeat).

I used canned beets. Peanut oil might have helped flavor more.

This was only my second or third time eating fresh beets, and I'm still undecided. I kinda liked this salad but I needed to sprinkle on some apple cider vinegar just to give it that twang that I associate with (pickled) beets. The vinegar contrasted nicely with the cheese though also. I'll give the beets another try but don't think I'll ever be a real fan. Thanks though!

Very tasty, my husband loved it! I boiled the beets instead of roasting and added a spoon of balsamic vinegar to the salad.

So simple but delicious! My only tweak was adding a good quality sweet balsamic. Gave it a hint of acid for depth.

The combination didn't work for me.
