My husband and I LOVE chicken wings so I knew this had our names written all over it! Plus it was quick and easy to put together for dinner - not to mention a bit healthier than fried chicken wings! I used leftover grilled chicken and for the sauce I used Frank's Red Hot, butter, and seasonings from our homemade hot wing sauce. I served the sandwiches with "No-Mayonnaise Ranch Dressing" from this site. All I did was add a garden salad for a simple and filling meal.

I love anything "buffalo" flavored, so I knew we would enjoy this.  I wasn't sure the sauce would be substantial enough, but it was perfect.  I love the idea of using the refrigerated pizza crust as the bread.  It was nice and soft and toasted up perfectly on my panini grill. I used blue cheese and my husband substituted swiss cheese on top of his.  A big hit and super easy and quick!

I love buffalo chicken so had high hopes for this.  I followed the recipe exactly but unfortunately can't give more than 3 stars.  It just seemed to be missing something.

Great concept to build on.  The end result of this sandwich is largely dependent on the quality of hot sauce you use.  I made it with Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce and enjoyed it immensely.  This one will be fun to play with.  I think a healthy helping of garlic would be interesting next time.
