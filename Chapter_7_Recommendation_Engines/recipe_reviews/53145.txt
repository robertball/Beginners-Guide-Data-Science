Really awesome! My boyfriend and I work in a restaurant that serves these mushrooms with their steaks. We were trying to imitate the recipe with our steaks and we hit it right on the nose! Thank you!

I made these and becuase of late arrivals they sat on the stove for much longer than called for----DELICIOUS.  I used fresh mushrooms and just a red wine, next time I think I will add a touch or red wine vinegar for a little zap.

Really good!  I actually marinated the mushrooms in more wine than the recipe called for overnight and added several splashes of Worchestershire sauce for richer flavor.

These mushrooms are quite tasty, but next time, I might skip the beef broth and just reduce the wine, onion, and FRESH mushrooms.  It might make for a more concentrated mushroom dish, similar to THAT restaurant's dish the other reviewers were hinting out.

This is easy, and it tastes GREAT,  I actually used fresh mushrooms and it was fine.  I also used a little corn starch to thicken the liquid before serving, I  thought I was eating burgundy mushrooms from a gourmet restaurant!

I'm sorry, this was a disaster! The only thing I did different was triple the recipe for a crowd, but I didn't think that would matter. It was way too much liquid that wouldn't cook down.
Finally I drained all the liquid out of the pan and kind of started over with the (canned) mushrooms. I sauted in half stick butter and added in more burgundy wine. The onion was still in the pan with the mushrooms and they did add a nice flavor. They turned out very good after my re-do. Sorry.. I dont know what went wrong here. Thanks though.

My father makes these all the time. I love them sooo much. I don't care for mushrooms, but these were the best!!!
He makes them with his steak, but instead of can mushrooms he uses the fresh ones in the produce section! YUMMM

I added a splash (maybe a tablespoon or two) of lemon juice, and I let it reduce well beyond half volume.  The result was just fantastic!

I would make it again. Used fresh mushrooms and the flavor was very beefy. I accidently let the liquid reduce too much in the end and will try to pull them off the stove sooner next time, they still tasted good.

Amazing, though I did make some modifications.  I didn't use onion since I was out. I used sliced fresh mushrooms which I sauteed in a few tablespoons of butter. I added enough red wine to cover the mushrooms and used a beef bouillon cube instead of beef broth. I reduced it until there was only a tiny bit of liquid left, mostly because I was distracted and left the pot on the stove unattended for too long.

I also used fresh mushrooms-8 oz of baby bellas & 8 Oz of regular. Flavor was very good! A nice change from our usual garlic butter mushrooms!

Very good flavor, but I would use much less broth next time and add some butter to saute the onions.  Otherwise, the recipe as called for is way too soupy.

Definitely need to doctor this one, but it was very good. I cut the onions in thin strips and sauteed them in a little butter, EVOO, and garlic. I used only 4oz of double strength broth and about 3/4 cup of wine. I also used fresh mushrooms, which I cut in half to help them absorb flavors. I let it reduce until it had a caramelized quality. Simply delicious.

These were really good.  I cleaned my mushrooms and trimmed the ends.  Threw them in 1 1/2 cps Beef Broth, 1/2 cp Merlot cause that's what I had.  Topped with some garlic powder and Italian seasonings.  Left out the onions cause they are a pain to chop.  Came out really good and very flavorful!

We will definitely be making this again.  It smelled wonderful while on the stovetop.  The only thing that surprised me was that the mushrooms did not absord as much flavor as I expected.  I did use fresh mushrooms, but I cooked them for almost 40 minutes.  Maybe simmering them for a longer time would help.

Since we love mushrooms it's hard to say we didn't really like this. Just our personal preference that we do not really care for mushrooms prepared this way...though we ate them.

Several years ago, our son made these for us - almost addictive!  He has since begun studying in Culinary School and still makes these, with rave reviews each time!  Be sure to use low fat & low salt beef broth when making this.

These really had excellent flavor!  You could taste the beef broth and the wine.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I think I added some garlic and I know I added salt and pepper.  I never would have thought to prepare mushrooms this way.  Thanks!  P.S.  Since I used fresh mushrooms, I did not have any canned mushroom liquid.  Since I only used beef broth and wine, I did not have the same problem as other reviewers who said they had too much liquid.  I had NO liquid left by the time they were done!

Oh my goodness! This recipe is the best. I started growing my own mushrooms; portabella/crimini and white button. I grow them indoors and it has really been fun. I used a mix of my home grown mushrooms and made this as is except for thickening with just a touch of cornstarch at the end just to give it some body, not make it gravy. I served it on tenderloin fillet's with garlic mashed potato's. Spectacular is all I can say. Thanks so much for this one. This recipe would also be excellent for tenderloin tips...which I will make tomorrow with the left over sauce. A ten star recipe all the way.

These were great! I used a pint of fresh sliced portabella mushrooms instead of the canned. Added a clove of minced garlic to the broth/onions while it was simmering. And added about 1 1/2 TBSP of soy sauce when I added the wine.

Very nice.  I used fresh whole mushrooms and so cooked the mushrooms for the whole 30 minutes.  I also used vegetable broth not beef, added a little thyme and low sodium soy sauce.  Thanks!

I made it with fresh mushrooms. The ONLY thing I think I'll try the next time is to thicken it up so it sticks to the mushrooms. It had a beautiful flavor that most of it remained in the pan. Other than that, it was wonderful!

I had leftover fresh mushrooms to use, otherwise I followed the recipe. Easy and so good, it's definitely one I will make again.
