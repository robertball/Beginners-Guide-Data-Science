this by far was one of my personal favorite's! I made this twice and ended up eating this as a late night TV snacks when the kids went to bed and I was watching my recordings. It was so flavorful, the salmon was wonderful, the cucumber added that little crunch and it was just the perfect little morsel. My children loved it....my son, was to be expected, said it was alright because he's not much of a fish person. But at least I give kudos for trying it. Will totally be on my rotation for #gameday and any time I am in the mode ;-)

These were fantastic easy bites. Loved them. Took a few trips to the stores to find dried sundried tomatoes (not packed in oil). They were in the vegetable aisle in a package. The "schmear" is a great flavor and can be used on anything. And I used smoked salmon. Take it from an appetizer queen, these are really good and different. However, you will need a boatload of breath mints afterwards. :)  Totally worth it. One more note, the recipe calls for 40 pieces. Not sure 5oz. of salmon/lox covers that. It might get a bit expensive. But do try it.

Thanks Debbie! Simple and easy! I had some leftover smoked salmon and decided to try these for friends who stopped in last nite and they were a hit. I did one version of the actual recipe and the 2nd version was substituting goat cheese for the cream cheese. Delightful

Made exactly as listed and took to a party.  There were none left.  I made many hours before and stored in Tupperware and the crackers were just fine (someone said theirs got soggy after a few hours).  I will definitely make again.  As far as the tomatoes - I bought tomato halves in a dry-pack and used 12 halves and it was plenty.  The recipe is not real clear about that - cut very small as they can be a bit chewy.

These were really easy to make. I used traditional smoked salmon rather than lox and they turned out great. I prepare a plate, put it on the table and when I walked back 5 minutes later the plate was completely empty...my guests devoured every bite. I ended up having extra schmear left over that I used as a bagel spread the next morning. Oh..and I didn't have sun dried tomatoes so I just left those out.

So even folks at our Super Bowl watch party who don't like cream cheese LOVED the flavor of this schmear - so easy to make...I put everything into a food processor, including the cream cheese.  Made for a delicious mix of flavors and a pretty presentation.

Tasted great but it was soggy before the game started.
Made for Super Bowl party.
Made at home, packed in  tupperware, layers separated by wax paper.  
Will make again.
Next time put on crackers just before serving or use ice box rye.
Everybody loved them in the begining when the crackers were crunchy.

I did not have any smoked salmon, so I left it off, but I did top them with the cucumber and a sprinkle of dried dill. The schmear is addictive and I'm ashamed to say I ate 8oz of light cream cheese schmear all by myself in two days!  Yes, this is a great recipe!  Thanks Debbie from Country Girl Gourmet!

Oh, Debbie.  These are SOOOO good!  I'll definitely make the spread again for snacks.  I tried them with smoked salmon, and that can definitely be left off if you don't care for it.  TRY THESE!!!  My daughter wants to make cucumber sandwiches out of the spread for her lunchbox, it's that good.  A true winner all around!

I made these for a Thanksgiving appetizer and liked them quite a bit. I used smoked salmon to top it with as that is the kind my husband likes best. I'm not a super huge fan of it but these were still good. The schmear was good on it's own, too.

I made this into a spread for small pieces of bagels for a potluck at work.  I did leave out the salmon and stirred the cucumber which I shredded and drained in the smear.  It was the first spread gone.  It was also very light and refreshing so it complimented the richer potluck faire

These are very good.   I couldn't find the everything Ritz crackers so I used  Ritz wheat crackers. Will definitely make these again. The schmear spread is very good. I  can't wait to try it on a bagel!
