This is a super easy and tasty dessert! I made it just as written, and it turned out very well. Next time, I might bake the crust, because it really crumbled a lot when the dessert was cut. This is the only problem I had, however. The whole pan was gone before I could even take a picture of a single piece! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...it is one that I would make again!

Awesome recipe! My family of 8 devoured this within a matter of minutes! There weren't any leftover. They immediately asked me to make it again the next week. Followed recipe as it, except used crushed toffee candy and chopped reese's peanut butter cups! Delicious!!

I think that KMB28 might have used the small pudding boxes (my chocoalte is 3.9 oz and vanilla is 3.4) instead of the large pudding boxes that are 5.9 oz and 5.1 as listed in the ingredients. That would certainly make it soupy. If you use the correct size, it should hold up with no problems.

Delicious and easy!! My family loved and I loved it! I added a little extra butter to the crust so it would stay together better and crushed additional candy bars on top! Yummy!

This turned out fantastic!! I doubled the recipe because I took it to my school for a teacher luncheon. Everyone raved how delicious it was!! I did bake the crust to make it a little heartier and so it wouldn’t crumble and fall apart.  Someone had made that suggestion in the comments. I also made copies of the recipe so I could pass it along!! So yummy!!

The directions on the recipe were unclear so after I ruined it attempting to follow the directions as written I started over and followed my instincts and it turned out delishious.

I made this for a church function and I came home with a clean dish!  Our Pastor had 2 servings & I sent the last piece home with her.  She gave it a thumbs up!! The only minor change I made was to top it with the Heath chocolate covered toffee bits instead of the candy bars.

This was a perfect dessert to take to a casual dinner party with friends.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  It was easy to make and I brought it in a disposable pan, so I could leave any extra for the hosts.  Very yum!

I must have done something very wrong. I used 2 boxes of each kind of pudding as the biggest boxes I could find were only 2 oz packages. The filling was thick, and sticky (almost tar like) even after I added extra milk. The crust was crumbly and wouldn't hold together even though I added extra butter. I was very disappointed in how it turned out and ended up not serving it.

I didn't make it but a friend made it for a School project and it was BOMB! =) She had added some pecans and almonds and a little bit of some chocolate drizzle on top. Overall, I loved this dish and I soon hope to make it!

This is an excellent easy recipe.  I alter it on and off and it gets cleaned up every time.  I use pretzels instead of the saltines and add some almond slivers to garnish the top.  I use peanut butter cups crushed in the middle layers but put Skor pieces and crushed Crispy Crunch on top for lots of flavour.
