I used real eggs as I didn't have any "egg product" on hand.  I also didn't have French Bread and since this was a Sonoma recipe (which focuses on whole grains) I used slices of whole grain bread.  I also put in about 1 diced scallion.  Made it up Saturday night, slept in Sunday morning, popped it in the oven....My fiance loved it.  I topped it with a touch of salsa and lowfat sour cream.  Pretty tasty with some sliced melon & a cup of tea.
