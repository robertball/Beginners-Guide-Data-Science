My 97-years old Grandmother used to make this for our birthdays when we were kids. It is so creamy and delicious! It has a marshmallow-like flavor.

With a yellow cake, the taste and texture are very nice.  The icing has a mildly crispy meringue shell and adds moisture to the cake especially if kept unrefrigerated.  

The seven minutes the title purports is totally inaccurate.  It took at LEAST 20 minutes with my hand mixer before the meringue got to the soft peak stage.   

As for the act of frosting, that can be a bit challenging.  This icing is a bit thin for my liking.  I ended up with icing all over my counter.  This frosting is just not very effective for layered cakes, as it just oozes out from between the layers.  This may have been avoided if allowed to completely dry before adding another layer.  Try fresh berries instead.  

It takes quite a few (four or more) hours to completely set.  I would have been building this cake for a few days had I gone by that method.  The drying time (for lack of a better term) also prohibits stencils from being used effectively.   

To the credit of this icing, it DOES taste GREAT and contains much less fat and calories than a butter-cream type of frosting.  Making this recipe is a challenging, but rewarding experience.  Seven minute frosting complimented the yellow cake from King Arthur Four's Baker's Companion very nicely indeed.

YUM!  So much better than canned!  The texture is all marshmallowy and gooey while you spread it on the cake and then turns into a light regular frosting as it dries.  I had to make sure I didn't eat too much while it was in the gooey stage.  Yummy yum!

This was the perfect frosting for my cake. I love the light, stickiness . . . it did take much longer than seven minutes for me. As another reviewer, it probably took at least 30 minutes over the boiling double boiler with the mixer. If it isn't thick enough, keep cooking. I took it off and thought I could beat it thicker, and then put it back over the boiling water until it was thick, then just beat it until it was cool enough to ice the cake. This icing is exactly what my mom used to make, lots of great memories eating the cake!

Nice flavor, especially with my favorite Mexican vanilla, but I thought it was still rather grainy, and also found it much too sweet (hard thing to accomplish considering my killer sweet tooth). Might try again with a reduced amount of powdered sugar for a silkier texture, but I wasn't teriibly impressed with this recipe.

Although this recipe was easy to make, it was however VERY sweet. I served it on a spice cake and noticed that most of  my guests had scraped the frosting off the cake and just the cake was eaten. If you truly like sweet, sugary frosting, this recipe is for you, however I won't make again.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because it is a lot of work. The end result is sweet and delicious, but it does take a lot longer than seven minutes which I think makes this recipe misleading. I also don't have a proper double boiler, so until I solve that problem this shall remain a four-star frosting. Great on lemon cake!

This recipe took FOREVER to make! I even made it twice thinking that I had messed it up somehow the first time and ended up throwing out the first batch after I realized I had not cooked it enough. I did frosted cake with the second batch, but had either overcooked it or something because it turned out very grainy.

I have made this frosting for many years. My dear mother in-law taught  me how. I cook it on the stove top  in a heavy pot and when it comes to a rapid boil, I dip a spoon ,hold the spoon out  in the air,checking the threads , keep boiling and checking , doing this until nice threads  start  running down from the spoon( when it's ready it will look like the threads are trying to curl back up)Have a large bowl ready with  your beaten egg whites, then slowing add the syrup and beat ( l use a hand mixer)until frosting is consistent  with the way you want it.
Remember,practice you will get the hang of it!
