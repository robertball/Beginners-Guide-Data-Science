So easy, so good...perfect as is. I even had to put this on turkey dogs because...people...and it was amazing! Also I know people get caught up on small things like the type of hot dog or how you cook the bun, even the type of mustard!!! It's not that serious people this is food if it sounds good to you cook it and eat it, who gives a poo if you steamed the bun or your hot dogs aren't in natural casings (what else do they wrap hot dogs in??? Is it plastic? It's plastic huh?) Mind you that's coming from a culinary school dropout but DO play with your food. Thanks Chef for another winner!!!

My wife made this recipe, but used beef heart instead. When we ordered the meat at the butcher we got some strange looks, but the outcome was great! Something about using the beef heart made the Coney recipe right on point. I strongly suggest the beef heart if you want authenticity.

Michigan conies are made with Kogels, it's kind of an unwritten law. I doubled the meat, cut the salt to 1 tsp, added 1 tbsp lard,  1 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp ground mustard, upped the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp, and increased the cumin to 2 tsp. Turned out great, thanks for the recipe.

I can't tell you if this is authentic or close to authentic because I've never had the pleasure of having a coney island dog...but I can tell you it is very good.  What I like about it is that it isn't ridiculously messy like a southern chili dog.  I'm very excited to have a go to recipe when I'm craving "chili dogs".  It took mine about 90 minutes to get to the right consistency....other than adding some shredded sharp cheddar to the top of the hot dog, I followed recipe exactly.  In my world this is enough meat sauce for more than 8 hotdogs....more like 12.

It sort of had the flavor but not the texture. It seemed to be all meat crumbles and none of the superb chili gravy. The chili gravy dripping over the sides is a distinct memory. I couldn't eat this. I grew up in Detroit and the chili at the Coney Island was smoother and gravy-like. I even used an immersion blender to do something to it. I really wanted this to be a winner but it's not fair to compare it to a Detroit Coney dog.

Really easy to make that's what I like. Sometimes I just don't have the time. Tastes great and doesn't make the bun soggy and fall apart. I drizzled  some liquid cheese on top

My Son loved this version of coney dog !! He walloped everything clean and that was the best form of compliment ever. He even requested for one more round the following weekend but I will make again next month.
Oh btw I omitted the celery salt since I did not have on hand but I will remember to add that the next time! Thanks Chef John !

This is great and easy.  So much better than canned chili as well.  I don't think I'll use anything but this again for my hotdogs.  Good with cheese, mustard and onions on top.  I followed the directions as instructed, but eye balled the seasoning and just added things to taste as I was cooking.  The seasoning is flexible, but the technique I think is what makes this great.  It results in a really nice, soft (for lack of a better word) and uniform meat sauce with no big pieces.  It might look gross while cooking, but it comes together well in the end. I let most of the liquid cook out for a more dry sauce.  So good.

This recipe has come the closest so far to the ones I remember as a kid.  I’d like it alittle juicier so I might add a bit of broth next time.

Pretty good and tangy. I preferred to add Mustard into the mix to give it that extra tang and time to settle into it, rather than just adding it after the fact.

Made it pretty much as written. I’m not good at following recipes exactly.  But, the ingredients as written were all included...just may have been slightly different quantities.  Everything was great!

As a Michigander, I can say that this is the real deal. I made this tonight with Koegels Viennas (natural casing for the crunch). Better Made brand potato chips in the side. You can’t get more authentic than this!

I thought this was just ok: I didn’t like the idea of  cooking the beef without draining the grease from it so the best thing is to use a 90/10 beef and the consistency will be just what you want it to be. I cooked the meat first then added all of the other ingredients as my beef was 85/15 so I drained the fat. As someone else said cut back on the salt a little bit as it is just a tad salty. Don’t miss out on the celery salt as  it makes a big impact! I also added a tablespoon of white vinegar the last 10 mins of cooking.

This is just what I've been looking for!  It's delicious with just the right balance of flavors.  And as an added bonus, not only have I used it on Coney Island Dogs, but I've had it by itself on a hamburger bun as a nice alternative to a Sloppy Joe, and on a salad with corn, cheese, beans, and whatever else my imagination comes up with.  This is a wonderful and versatile recipe.  I'll be making it a lot.  Thanks Chef John!

It makes one of the best hot dogs I've ever tasted.

Very good, I added a little Worcestershire and a little better than beef bouillon for more flavor. I would definitely make this again.
Was made for a football game.

I followed the recipe exactly except I eliminated the cayenne pepper and used only 1 tsp of salt.  It still seemed a little too salty to me. Something  else was missing but  i can't put my finger on it.  I will definitely try this recipe again.

It was easy to make and tasted great.  Bought real cased hot dogs and made Chef John's hot dog rolls.  Leftovers freeze great and tastes as good or maybe a little better the second time.

Have made this twice, exactly as written, except with ground turkey instead of beef. Hubby(who is not normally a fan of meat sauce on hot dogs) loved it and so did I. Very flavorful.  Definitely smoosh the meat good as it browns with a spoon or potato masher so it is very finely textured.  Makes for a better sauce to stick to your dogs! A keeper for sure!

Easy preparation, great taste with melted cheddar on top.
