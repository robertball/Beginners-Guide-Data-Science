Very good burger - if you really want the ranch taste to come through, a good rule of thumb is a 1 oz. packet of dry ranch mix for every pound of hamburger.  I did that and added the diced red onion along with the blue cheese.  Once they came off the grill I melted some additional blue cheese over top because I just love the stuff!  These were great on toasted sesame rolls.

I've tried many of the burger recipes on allrecipes. Most of them are very good, but they don't always justify investing the time and ingredients since the end product is often very similar to the plain ol' burger. Not so with Red, White and Blue Burgers. Next to Surprise Burgers (also available at allrecipes), this one is my favorite. Please note: I doubled the blue cheese and doubled the ranch salad dressing seasoning (I had 2 1/2 pounds of hamburger too). Yes, doubling these key ingredients lends a powerful punch with each bite, but in my opinion, burgers should offer up a bold flavor. No doubt, doubling these ingredients would be too much for some, so let your own personal preference guide you as you decide what to do. By the way, these burgers don't really need condiments. I ate the first one naked (I'm referring to the burger). I used some left over sauce from Surprise Burgers as a dipping sauce for the second, which provided a spectacularly sweet counterpoint to the savory flavor of the burger.

YUM-YUM! Totally worth the extra expense. These are not a plain ol' burger! I added the whole package of ranch mix based on other reviews, but it was the only change I made.  Excellent recipe!

These were fantastic. I added worcestershire to my meat and they were a hit even with my 4 year old... The added flavor was needed though. Its a keeper

I thought these were absolutely delicious! I typically don't like burgers, or much beef at all, but the combination of flavors these had was great. I only used about 1 1/4 lbs of beef and it made five burgers -- two of them I cooked on a George Foreman grill and the other three on a broiler pan in the oven, just to see which worked best. The broiled batch were more flavorful, but maybe that's because all the fat ran out of the other ones. :)

I really don't know why I chose to make these burgers because I'm not a fan of ranch dressing in any form, but I'm glad I did. I made them for 6 people at a recent cookout and all 6 people, including me, said they were the best hamburgers they've ever had. I stuck to the recipe, using chuck instead of sirloin and adding about 1 tbsp of worcestershire.

Excellent.  I've been making Lipton Onion soup burgers for years with rave reviews, but this recipe is now my new favorite.  It's juicy and delicious.  It's just a little more expensive to make with the blue cheese addition.

This were so good. These can be just eaten by themselves and they are so moist and delicious. Do not put sauce on them, they do not need it. Only thing I changed was a couple splashes of worchestire sauce in the mix.

This recipe was kind of bland as written.  Next time I will use the whole package of ranch dressing mix and also some salt and pepper.  The recipe has enough promise to try them again.

Omg! My husband was coming home from Europe and I wanted to make him a great home cooked meal.  This did the trick.  I bought a little over a pound of 93% ground chuck, used a full packet of ranch (1oz), about 3oz of blue cheese and beforehand grilled half a sweet onion to add to the mixture.   So juicy and flavorful!  He said no debate between four and five stars......defnately five....I agree!  Thanks for a great burger.

Absolutely amazing burger, i didnt change the recipe at all. I used a whole pack of ranch dressing and it was perfect. I didn't taste much of the ranch but with the flame broiled flavor and the tangy blue cheese flavor and the sweet red onion it was a huge hit. I loved it...

Best burger I've ever tasted! So juicy and so flavorful! Perfect combination of ingredients. Everyone I've made these for loves them! I use this recipe for spaghetti and meatballs too. My only change is that I use the whole packet of ranch. Tastes great with crumbled feta too.

These were good, but I agree that it needs the full package of Ranch dressing mix and I also put in nearly double the blue cheese.  I also sauteed the red onion with some garlic.  Still needs more UMPH!  Guests thought they were good, but no one asked for the recipe.

This turned out very well. I cooked these under the broiler. I thought the blue cheese was a little too strong for me but my husband enjoyed every bite of his. I didn't have dried Ranch dressing so I used some bottled Ranch dressing. We enjoyed this different burger. Thanks.

These were good.  I added worcestershire and used a full dry ranch packet.  I also caramelized the onion a bit with some minced garlic before adding it to the meat (drained and cooled, of course).  Also, I doubled the blue cheese.  This made the blue cheese flavor a little strong, but I realized it would have been better if I crumbled the bigger pieces of cheese before adding them.  I let the meat sit for an hour before shaping.  Then, I broiled them in my oven for about 7 minutes on each side for medium-well burgers.  Didn't even top this burger with cheese, because it was already very flavorful.  They came out very tender and moist.

These were great!  I did feel that they needed alot more for seasoning though.  I added some worcestershire sauce and quite a bit of pepper.  I also used about twice as much bleu cheese.  Overall, these were delish!

I thought these were pretty good. I love the blue cheese mixed in with the hamburger. I chose to use only half of a red onion, and sauteed it first until soft, before adding to the hamburger mixture. I used a whole packet of ranch after reading the reviews, but next time I think I'd probably use about 3/4 of the packet. The ranch flavor does mellow somewhat when eaten the next day.

These were great! I didn't have blue cheese so I put in Feta, which is probably why they are four stars instead of five. I grilled them so they had a nice smokey flavor to them and they stayed really moist. I will definitely be making these again soon!

I made these a while back and they were so juicy and delicious!! Just added a couple of dashes of Worcester sauce and little onion soup mix and let it set for thirty minutes before cooking... Where has this recipe been all my life...Even the ranch flavor was good.

This recipe is outstanding!  I don't even normally like blue cheese, but figured that this recipe gets so many great reviews that I should give it a shot.  It is the best burger I've ever had!  I did follow the advice of another review and added the whole packet of ranch dressing though.

These deserve 10 stars but I could not tweak it if my life depended on it. First, I needed more hamburger then I had, so I added a pound of spicy Bratwurst to the mixture along with some steak sauce, a package of Lipton onion soup mix too, just for good measure.  I love onions too much to simply put them inside, so slices on the bun seems  ideal! Not everybody in my family likes blue cheese, it went on individual burgers. If this burger wasn't big enough, I placed Hatch chilies on them as well!! These were EXCELLENT! ! THANK YOU from one Patty to another;;)
