Fantastic recipe.  The only changes I made were to cook the meatballs in the oven.  I then drained the fat, heated the sauce in a saucepan to melt sugar, then put meatballs and sauce into a covered casserole dish and put back in the oven for 15 minutes.  YUM!!

First of all, I want to say that the sauce is GREAT. I hate running to the store to get that one ingredient you just don't keep on hand. Everything in this recipe is something almost everyone has. The only reason I subtracted one star is because cooking the meatballs in the sauce makes for a LOT of fat in the final recipe. Also, I made this recipe with 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 sausage. That was MY mistake, NOT the recipe's. The sausage flavor was too strong for this sauce so, if you are thinking of doing this.. you shouldn't. Overall, the recipe was a huge success. Thank you.

My kids really love them and they are so fast and easy. I love how the sauce is so simple, but so delicious. I highly reccomend this recipe for kids or people looking for a new meatball recipe! I followed the recipe as written.

Very easy simple recipe.  I added some oregano to the meatballs and waited until the meatballs had cooked for about 45 min. drained the fat out and then added the sauce. Delicious my wife has wanted me to make this twice now in two weeks.

These are easy & very tasty.  I was rushed on time, and didn't have an hour to bake.  So I first gently seared the meatballs in a large pan, moved them to a warmed dutch oven, covered them in the sauce, and cooked on medium-low for 15-20 minutes.  Came out just delicious.

Phe-no-menal. Greatly pleases the husband. I've never been a huge fan of meatballs. I chose this recipe because it appeared to be lowfat but it tastes amazing.

This is a delicious snack between meals or frozen and used at a later time.  We adjusted the quantity and found it just as great.  We used 3/4 cups catsup and 3/4 cups bbq instead of 1 1/2 cups ketchup.  Unfortunately, they were so good that the last batch did not even make it to dinner.  Everytime the kids would come into the kitchen; another little hand grabbed a few more meatballs.

Way too much ketchup.  I tasted it before I poured it over the meatballs.  I added extra brown sugar, then worchestershire and sweet pickle juice to cut the ketchup taste.  I also browned them first to cut down on the grease.

For meatballs, didnt have any cracker crumbs so used 1/2 c. quick oats instead. For sauce, used 1 c. tomato sauce, 1/2 c. ketchup, mustard & vinegar as is, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. apricot pineapple preserves & 1 T. worcestershire. Baked meatballs for 45 minutes then piled into a crockpot and poured sauce over top to heat up and carry to a potluck.

Fantastic recipe! The meatballs took about an hour and a half before they were done, and I added a few extra spices ( onion powder, Oregano, garlic powder ) to the meat mixture just because we like our food a litle more spicy. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very yummy! I did as others had suggested and baked meatballs for 40 mins.  drained fat then added sauce. I also sauteed onion with minced garlic before adding it to meat.  These I will be making again! :)

I have made this recipe, exactly as is, many times. It is my husband's favourite and all of our friends' as well. Absolutely delicious. My only occasional variation (but it isn't necessary) is to wait until 1/2 way through the cooking time to add the sauce. Just a fantastic recipe. So easy too!

This recipe drew me in with the picture. My daughter is a very picky eater, and when we're taking a break from chicken nuggets or boxed mac and cheese, I throw frozen meatballs in a skillet and cook in ketchup and she loves them. Needless to say, she loved these meatball just as much, if not more, and me and my husband enjoyed these much more. I don't normally like sweet meatballs, but the brown sugar wasn't too much for me.

These are the BEST!  Made a batch Christmas day, was asked to make another batch by Hubby who "doesn't like meatballs".  Got rave reviews by all.  Thanks for posting.

I was worried that the meatballs were too wet as they were a little hard to form but they turned out moist and delicious. I did bake the meatballs a little differently, I cooked them in a 350 degree oven for a half hour WITHOUT sauce, drained off all the fat, then poured the sauce on. My boys and husband loved the sauce, I thought it could be gussied up a bit but I was too tired to do so, other than add a teaspoon each of onion/garlic powders and a good dash of black pepper. As is, only three small meatballs remain out of this whole recipe and both my oldest boy and husband asked for seconds.

Didn't make the sauce, but used the recipe for the meatballs - and now I am replacing my old meatball recipe.  Now, I want to try the sauce.

This was pretty good, I didnt have any crackers so I used bread crumbs instead. It worked fine but the meatballs were a little soft so crackers would probly work better. I also didnt have any mustard so i put a little less ketchup and a little more brown sugar and it tasted good. I cooked them in the slow cooker on low for about 4 hours and it worked great!

Tried substituting ground turkey for ground beef, but ground turkey is much wetter, and I wound up having to add more bread crumbs.  The sauce was great, but a little tart.  I would omit the vinegar.  Next time I will stick to the recipe and hope for tastier meatballs.    Update: made recipe again using specified ingredients, and meatballs were terrific.  My kids, usually very fussy, loved them!  I did omit vinegar from the sauce and everyone said it was better.

These meatballs are delicious! The sauce is sweet and thick and would please even the pickiest of eaters. I didn't have plain cracker crumbs so I ground up some whole wheat wheat thins.

This was one of the best dishes I've ever made. I can't wait to make it for a large get together. Great with noodles or without! I even substituted in almond milk to replace regular milk. It tasted wonderful!!! I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the egg mixture. Added some Panko bread crumbs because I felt like the meat was still too moist with only one cup of crackers. And a splash of Lee and Perrins! Great recipe!!

I served these yummy meatballs with seasoned basmati rice and a mung bean, slivered almond and red pepper tamari stirfry.  I halved the recipe, since I was only feeding my boyfriend and I, but by mistake I whisked two eggs rather than one, and they still turned out fantastic.  I used lean ground Angus beef, unfrozen, and I made breadcrumbs instead of using cracker crumbs (although that sounds good too!).  Now we're fighting over who gets to eat the leftovers for lunch!!!  I can't wait to make this dish again :)

I like this recipe because I had everything in the kitchen to prepare it. Also I liked the fact that it was baked and still came out crispy & juicy. Good little recipe. Simple is good.

These were delicious. The yummiest. Because I didnt have all the right ingredients at the time, I did have to make a few modifications, but tried to stick closely to the flavours of the recipe, and I was so stoked to have such a yummy recipe

These meat balls were fantastic!  I did not have an onion, forgot while at the store, so I put some fresh chopped garlic in it.  The sauce is great and really gets into the meat balls and gives them a good zing!  I recommend this one as it was easy and delicious.

This was oh soooo yummy! Had to resist nibbling at them while I finished the other parts of the meal. That much ketchup cannot be healthy so I marked it down 1 star. Otherwise it was fab! Variations: I halved the serving size and used regular bread crumbs.The kind of ground beef I get in my country is really lean so I didn't get the problems others had with having to pour off accumulated fat.

These are fantastic! Especially the sauce, it's amazing! I decided to use seasoned bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs because that's all I had.

The meatballs were really good, but the sauce had a little too much ketchup for me.  I guess I won't be making it again, though...the first thing my husband said was that it tasted like meatloaf (of which he is not a fan!).   He ate it all, but I could tell he would be ok with it if I didn't make it again.  Oh well!

These were WAYYY too sweet for us.  They also totally fell apart and I followed the recipe exactly aside from used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.  Sorry but I don't think I'd make these again.

Very tasty and simple. I cooked as per other suggestions to cook the meatballs for 30 minutes, drained the pan and then added the sauce. The 2nd time I used extra lean hamburger and no draining required.

I found the vinegar way too over powering - I'd start with 1/2 the amount next time and add if needed (I won't be making this again but that's my advice to someone trying it for the first time).

I would give a three and a half if I could.  Not the best.  But not bad either.  I was just in search of the best.....so I'll keep looking.

Meatballs were very good but did taste like meatloaf. Not a fav. of kids b/c they don't like meatloaf. I did sprinkle in some garlic and some beef boulion (can omit additional salt if u do this). They were VERY moist. I did bake the meatballs on a cookie sheet for about 20min or so and then blotted them with papertowels to remove some of the grease/fat.  Then put in a 13X9 pan and baked for about 45min. Easy enough to make but really do taste like meatloaf meatballs. Oh, I did cut the vinigar in 1/2 (so I used 1/4 cup) and used champaign vinager instead of white. My mom made this as well and she used apple cider vinigar and was very pleased with the results.

These were just okay.  You can really smell and taste the vinegar.  I tried this because I have a ketchup & mustard lover in the house.  I liked them smothered with gravy and potatoes.  Easy recipe though so I'll give it 3.

Easy, and very yummy.  Even my kids liked it, and they don't like much that is new.  I cooked them in the crockpot and my meatballs were bigger than the recipe called for, but turned out great none the less

These meatballs were delicious! The sauce was a bit too sweet for me though so I will cut back on the brown sugar next time and maybe add some worcesthire sauce.

I didn't inherit a good meatball/meatloaf recipe and in my limited experience the old recipes are the best and this is true for this one! I bake the meatballs without the sauce and put them in spaghetti sauce right before serving, as they cool they soak up the sauce. SO DELICIOUS!

I love this recipe. I skipped the sauce part and just used the meatball recipe. Instead of just plain cracker crumbs, I added to that some herbs de provence, parsley flakes, red onion, worcestershire sauce and some salt and pepper. I kept everything else the same and they turned out phenomenal. I just added some spaghetti sauce and threw them on a french baguette, voila! Meatball sandwich!!!! :)

These meatballs were quick, so easy, and absolutelly delicious. I am a huge fan of "tangy" and boy were these ever tangy. I skimped the brown sugar a bit. I served these over egg noodles with steamed beans. Took less than half an hour to throw dinner together. Very good meal for busy moms. A big hit with the kids.

My first attempt at meatballs and the husband loved it. I added some origano to the meatballs. I served it with some noodle and garnished with coriander. I will definitely make this again.

I absolutly loved this recipe.  I cut the recipe down to eight because it was only me and my husband eating.  I also cooked it on the stove top in a little olive oil.  It came out so good I just couldnt get enough, which is suprising because I hate meatballs. Highly Recommended

I tried this last night, it's easy to make and pretty fast. We did not like the sauce that much because it is kind of sweet, looking at the recipe again it's no wonder at all, sugar, ketchup all kind of sweet. But the meatballs came out great. Maybe next time I'll use regular tomatoes and less sugar. But it was worth trying.

This is an awesome recipe!! I had never made any type of meatballs before and these were delicious!

I did however do as many of the others have said and baked the meatballs for 45 minutes without the sauce and drained the fat. Then covered with the sauce and put in the oven for another 15 minutes.

I ADORE this sauce. The first time I made them, I couldn't wait to have the leftovers! I am making them again and trying to make the recipe in a meatloaf format. We shall see how it goes, but I know I will love the taste no matter what!

A very easy and tasty meatball recipe.  I followed others advice and cooked the meatballs first...  drained the fat and then added the sauce and cooked 15 minutes longer in the oven.  I also added garlic powder to the meat for extra flavor. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

This recipe is a keeper!  I like sauce on my meatballs so I doubled the sauce and it still wasn't saucy.  The next time I make them I think I will 2.5x the sauce.  
As an appetizer double the sauce was perfect. 

I added Italian seasoning to the sauce just till it looked good to me, about six twists of the grinder. 

I pre cooked the meatballs for 15 minutes, but using 97% lean meat I went ahead and added the sauce for the remaining 45 minutes.

These meatballs were fantastic; my search is over. Making them was so simple, that even the beginner cook will be surprised. The only change I made was to add red pepper flakes because I like spicy food.

I followed this recipe to the T and was very happy with my meatballs. Not too happy with the sauce! The sauce was too sweet for our taste, my husband and I had to scrape the sauce off and discard it. I will try it again but will omit the sugar in the sauce (maybe that will help) I also added garlic and cumin to my meatballs. They turned out perfect! Best meatballs ever....

Delicious and fast. I substituted lean turkey and veal and my family devoured these meatballs! The only change next time will be less sugar and vinegar as the sauce was a bit too tangy or my kids. Best meatballs ever!

This recipe taste like mini meatloaf balls. Tasty but wasn't what I was looking for. The ingredients are  simple so it something I would make for a finger food party or I'd make a meatloaf using this recipe.

Made these meatballs last night.  I thought they were really good.  The sauces a little too sweet for my wife's and my taste.  But other than that, I thought they were really good.  I baked them covered in the oven on 350 for 30 minutes, drained the grease and fat, added the sauce, then cooked covered for an additional 25 minutes.  I may play with the sauce mix next time.  Overall, a good recipe.

A good recipe, but I find that I have to cook these for an extra 15 minutes or so or else they come out kind of mushy and raw in the middle.

I was searching for a sauce for the meatballs I'd made previously and frozen.  Found this one and it was great.  I did add a few dashes of Worcestershire and a little molasses.  Poured onto the frozen meatballs and warmed in the toaster oven until dinner time.  Yum!

Awesome meatballs!  I used a bit less ketchup and a little less brown sugar (about 2/3 of the recommended amount for each).  They came out just great, even my girlfriend loved them, and she is the pickiest person I know!  I drained some of the grease, too.

These were amazing. I cut the recipe in half because it was just my fiance and I.  There ended up only being enough for two hoagies and a half.  I was hoping for some left over so he could take them in his lunch, so next time I wont be cutting it in half! Other than that it was to die for!

whoa, first off the sauce is pretty simple and is good as is, i've made it before.  but just a little lemon juice and soy or steak sauce really kicks it up a little, plus it doesn't hurt to add garlic to almost everything too, as for the meatballs. well, a 9x13 inch dish isn't big enough to make 40 meatballs, i suggest bigger meatballs!  the smaller ones stuck together and we had to pull them apart. we also cooked the meat, then drained before adding the sauce, good stuff!

Very yummy! Makes quite a bit of extra sauce though. Next time I will either add an extra lb of meat and up the other ingredients as well, or I will only make 3/4 of the recommended sauce. Oh, and I read some reviews of people thinking this was a horrible sauce to put over spaghetti. Yeah, this is totally NOT a spaghetti and meatball kinda sauce! Very good over rice! Thanks for the great recipe Bakin' machine!

Very tasty, saucier than i expected, but that was not disappointing. I browned them for a little bit before putting them into the oven, turned the oven up to 400 for the last 15 minutes to get some nice carmalization on the sauce, yum!

Besides the fact that I burned mine, the sauce was excellent and the meatballs would have been if I didn't burn the bottoms :P. Don't know what I did wrong. I did a few things different, instead of crackers I used italian style bread crumbs, and I put them in the oven without the sauce because not everyone liked it. But either way I give it five stars.

Excellent! I did it on the stovetop in a large chicken fryer pan. I omitted the salt because I used saltine crackers. After browning the meatballs, I added the sauce. The aroma got me thinking green pepper and pineapple chunks. Little more black pepper, white pepper, cayenne pepper, Excellent! Thank-you Bakin' Machine!

This sauce is the same as my mom's spaghetti sauce.  It tastes like Coney Sauce from a Drive In we had in B.C. called the Dog n Suds. I still love this sweet sauce!

If you like meatloaf, you will love these meatballs. They are not meatballs for pasta, they are meatballs for an appetizer. They are very moist. It's a very easy recipe to half. For the ketchup I used a scant 1/2 cup (instead of of 3/4 of a cup for half). That was the only change and it was perfect. I made no changes to original recipe other than amount of ketchup.

Pretty good! Even my picky hubby liked this!!! While I would never serve this as a dinner entree again, I WOULD make a few changes in order to make this suitable for serving as an appetizer. This recipe is VERY similar to the cocktail meatballs I've seen on many a party / potluck buffet. Having said this, I'll FOR SURE make these again but am just not sure this is an appropriate main dish. This becomes a GREAT appetizer by simply making smaller (i.e. 1 in. diameter) meatballs and DOUBLING (or even tripling) the sauce. And, as many others have done, I STRONGLY suggest pre-baking your meatballs. AT MINIMUM, bake for 30 minutes and then either finish in the oven, on the stovetop or in a slow cooker. I stayed true to the recipe this time with the exception of warming my sauce in a Dutch oven and THEN adding my (drained) meatballs and simmering on low for ~ 20 minutes. All in all, this is a GREAT recipe. It costs MUCH less than the traditional chili sauce / grape jelly version and pretty much tastes the same (who knew?). I can't wait to take these little gems to my next get-together! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Bakin' Machine. Your Aunt Hazel is a cooking genius! :-)

These were just meatballs in homemade bbq sauce. They were a bit bland by themselves and the sauce made them good. The sauce was really good. Better than the meatballs. We ate these but the family was not impressed. I had the leftovers the next day for lunch but they didn't gain anything in standing overnight. This was a very easy recipe and it took no time at all to get in in the oven.

I cooked my meatballs in the oven without the sauce for about 30 minutes.  During that time I simmered the sauce ingredients on the stove.  I tasted it with a spoon and it seemed pretty mustard-y to me but I stuck with it and poured it over the meatballs after draining the grease and baked for about 15 more minutes.  I served this over rice and the sauce ended up being delicious!

A great meatball recipe with normal pantry ingredients. Made the recipe exactly as written.  The sauce is ketchup based so it does taste like ketchup that has been fancied up - but that is what this recipe is about - using normal staples together to come up with something tasty and easy.  Way easier than my other meatball recipe - so this recipe gets put in the weeknight rotation!

Way, way too much ketchup (will use real tomato sauce in the future) and too much vinegar for my liking.  The meatballs were ok, but they probably would've been better if they'd been done in a croc pot instead; mine got a little burnt on the bottom.

I am reviewing the sauce as I used a different meatball recipe. It was very vinegar-y tasting. I double checked the measurement even before using as 1/2 cup seemed quite alot. I wish I cut it to 1/4 cup instead.

I exchanged white vinegar for white wine, and omitted the onion but added 2 cloves of freshly pressed garlic. I (like another reviewer) added oregano, and also some onion powder and celery seeds.   So delicious! I brought it to a church potluck and they were the first to go.   Cheers!

I'm not a person to eat this kind of thing at a party but I had all the ingredients and substituted ground turkey in for the beef.  They were really good.  I stored over half of the recipe in the freezer for a later date.  I give this recipe a 9 out of 10 (not the healthiest, but delicious).

I am giving this recipe three stars because I thought they were ok. The rest of my family who is not really picky said they taste like meatloaf...quite sweet and the taste of vinegar is strong.  I am disappointed that I used 2 lbs. of ground beef. Won't be making again.

It's late on a Sunday and I need something for dinner. I found this recipe and had all the ingredients -- simple, easy and tasted GREAT!  I didn't change a thing. I served it over brown rice with green onions like in the photo.  The sauce was very tasty.  My husband and son loved it.  I might tweak the meatballs in the future just to try something different -- but you certainly don't have to.  Thank you Aunt Hazel!

These are EXCELLENT! Just like other reviewers, I love that the ingredients are all items we keep on hand. Super fast and easy. Great flavor, too. We made meatball hoagies out of the leftovers. Mouthwatering! I used a large cookie scoop to portion the balls, then went back and compressed them a little more. I made these per the recipe. But I did bake them without sauce the first half. However, I wanted more sauce for the hoagies. Think I will double the sauce next time. My family of six have requested them again!

Great dinner.  I reduced the ketchup by 1/2 cup replacing with water instead.  Used only  3 tbsp of brown sugar.  Roll them around in the sauce partway through cooking.  You're a hero in an hour.

These are good.  I think best as an appetizer.  We put left overs on a roll and melted cheese for a great sandwich.  Will def make again.

This recipe was easy enough for even my non-culinary brain!  I had my 8-year-old daughter help me make it and she thought it was fun.  At the risk of another reviewer telling me that I have no business changing the original recipe and then reviewing it...I did make a few "alterations."  I used 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound ground Italian sausage, onion salt rather than minced onions (it's a texture thing for me), and soy milk due to lactose allergies in my family.  For the sauce I followed the advice of others and used 3/4 cup ketchup and 3/4 cup barbecue sauce, 1/4 cup dijon mustard, and omitted the vinegar.  It got rave reviews from my husband, as well as all the starving computer programmer nerds..er..co-workers in his office the following day.  I will definitely be making these again and trying different variations!

I made the meatballs exactly as stated in the recipe. My family loved them. There was a few leftover and my husband made himself a meatball sandwich the next day for lunch. He requests them about once a week. Even my 4 and 5 year old love them. thanks for sharing

This is a very simple meatball recipe but I won't be making it again.  The ketchup flavor is a bit too strong and doesn't work for me.  However, my 2year old daughter loved them.

These meatballs are great.  I made them for my daughter's "ball" themed birthday party and they were a huge hit.  I tripled the amount, I made one batch with the ketchupy sauce, one batch with BBQ, and one with sweet and sour sauce.  The ketchup sauce wasn't as good as the others, but the actual meatballs are great!

My whole family loved these! I did not add the sauce until after the meatballs cooked for 40 mins and I drained off the grease. I used organic ground beef, but only because it was on big time sale. I am making these for Thanksgiving appetizers by making the meatballs half the size. These are quickly becoming a monthly meal.

My family loved these meatballs, they were so tasty.  I cut the recipe in half since we didn't need 40 meatballs, and used bread crumbs in place of the crackers.  I will be making these again real soon.

This has become a favorite staple in my house. The kids love this meal. These taste like little meat loafs (but better). I use dried onion instead of fresh because we like the flavor but not the chunks. ...I know it’s a little unorthodox, but my husband and l love these topped with a chili paste and soy sauce blend. Yum!!

This has been a family favorite for years.  (sorry, it took me so long to write a review).  As busy as our family is now, I now make the meatballs ahead and freeze.  To prepare, we toss them in the crockpot in the morning.  By the afternoon, (whomever is home) drains them and adds the sauce and lets it cook until everyone else is home.

I made the meatballs half sausage and ground beef.  When i read the recipe I too thought maybe too much ketchup for my tastes but a great easy base to adjust.  I halved the ketchup and mustard, added 2-5 hard shakes(tsp) of worcester sauce (to make it more sweet and sour tasting) and minced garlic to taste.  I kept the rest the same. I brushed the sauce on instead, during the last 20 minutes so it would caramelize a little each time.  Thank you so much for sharing! A new taste on a traditional dish to change up the monotony of the work week meals!

I only made the meatballs, so my rating is based on the meatballs.  The only change I made was  to the  meat by substituting with 1/2 of Italian bulk sausage and 1/2 ground beef.  Based on other reviews I also used plain breadcrumbs and baked in the oven.  Added meatballs to my own spaghetti sauce.  Excellent and the flavor did not compete with my sauce.  I will be using this recipe in the future.  Thanks for posting!!fUPDATED REVIEW:  I made this receipe again today including the sauce.  Followed to a tee except, after 45 minutes in the oven I drained the grease from the meatballs on paper towels and made the sauce in a separate pot on my cooktop.  I did add 1 tbls. Worcestershire to the sauce.  After draining the meatballs  I put them in my 3 qt cast iron Dutch oven and poured  the sauce over the meatballs and simmered on the cooktop.  It was really tasty and tangy.  Next time I will cut back on both the ketchup and the white vinegar to better suit my taste.  I served with a simple rice pilaf with fresh green beans.  Cannot wait to see how these taste as leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!!  Really tangy kinda like sweet/sour meat balls.  Something different!!! My husband really liked them

These were easy and tasty.  My 16 yr old had a meatball sandwich, I had them over rice and my husband ate them solo.  Everyone wanted seconds so that tells me they loved them.  Loved the sweet and sour tang!

Simple yet totally delicious. The sauce made too much, we preferred to just drizzle it over the meatballs. Highly recommend!

after reading other reviews, a scaled back on the ketchup. Only 1/2 cup of ketchup and then added  1 cup chopped tomatoes. I also added a beef bullion cube and prepared the sauce prior to adding the meatballs. An immersion blender made it nice and smooth. 

Leftover sauce was a great base for sautéed mushrooms the following day!

Very tasty meatball recipe!  I did make a couple of changes however.  I used Ritz crackers instead of regular Saltines, and dried onion in place of the raw onion as that is what I had on hand.  The sauce was delicious, but my only complaint was there wasn't a whole lot of sauce.  Next time I prepare this I plan on doubling the sauce.  Thanks for posting this.

Delicious & perfectly easy recipe. I hardly had any ingredients in the house and I was able to whip this up. I had to use dried minced onion because I didn't have an onion around and I used saltine crackers crushed up for bread crumbs. I cut the recipe in half, but I shouldn't have because they are so good! The sauce has a tang to it that I love!

I bought store frozen meatballs, but I used the sauce recipe. I found it to be a little too tangy. I will dial it down a bit next time I make it.

Thanks Hazel!!  These meatballs were great.  And actually I'm not a big meatball fan.  I hate it when reveiwers give a recipe five stars then proceed to list a ton of changes they made to it.  Well, I did make one change.  I used 1 lb of hamburger and 1 lb of ground chicken.  But everything else was the same and I'm sure the change I made impacted very little the gist of this recipe.  My wife loved these too (and she is a meatball fan).  We will definitely make these again!!

Loved it the first time I made it and followed the recipe over 2yrs ago!I have made some changes to it as well. I used half bbq sauce half ketchup for the the 1 1/2 c ketchup.  Also used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow. And I used apple cider vinegar instead of white. And didn't use any brown sugar. Came out amazing!!!!

Cooking these as listed could be problematic using beef and covering with a sauce.  The grease would turn the sauce into a more unhealthy and unpleasant liquid than it already is so instead, I adjusted it to be  healthier and tastier.  I used 2.5lbs of ground turkey, medium sized onion, heavy cream (low carb) and crushed pita chips.  For the sauce I used everything as listed except replaced the sugar with Brown Sugar Twin substitute and only used 1/4 cup vinegar.  I also seasoned the turkey with seasoning salt, garlic mesquite, paprika and white pepper.  Poured the sauce over the meatballs and baked for about 30 minutes.  These turned out AWESOME.  Slightly tangy, a tiny bit sweet and no grease. I also used a small ice cream scoop for even sized meatballs.  With a few adjustments, this recipe gets 5 stars.  As it stands it gets 3 as a good base recipe.

Wasn't pleased with this one at all. It was so overwhelming with ketchup and vinegar.  My family did care for it either and my one child loves ketchup.  Will be deleting from my recipe box.

I love these meatballs. I have made them maybe 9 times so far this year. Also use half of the vinegar as needed. I don't mind the vinegar taste, but not everyone loves it. Still overall really delicious.

I'm only reviewing the sauce as my husband had already made a big batch of freezer meatballs. I adjusted the recipe slightly, using apple cider vinegar instead of white, and I used slightly less sugar than called for. I tasted the sauce after mixing the ingredients and tasted ketchup and mustard, as noted by other reviewers. So I added some chopped onion and let the meatballs simmer for about 15-20 minutes while the rice cooked, and the flavours came together beautifully! Really tangy, and I couldn't even pick out the mustard flavourful! Nice, easy recipe - thank you!

I made this today, and they were great.  I used bread crumbs, and a little less ketchup then suggested, but they were great.  I would like more sauce next time, but less ketchup flavor.

Made this tonight for supper. I added about 3 tbls Heinz 57 sauce to the sauce mixture for a little extra kick. The meatballs were very good and the sauce was great. Even my picky wife said they were good and she normally isn't a fan of meatballs. The only thing I did different was to bake the meatballs for about 30 minutes, drain off the grease, and then add the sauce and baked them till they were done.

If you love sweet sour foods, this is a saver!  Quick, easy, delicious.  Another time I'm going to add some chopped green pepper and a little minced garlic or garlic powder.

The ketchup was really strong, so I added some Worcestershire sauce and chili powder for a bit of a zip. Great recipe.. easy to make!

Read the reviews, decided to substitute half ketchup, half BBQ sauce. Turned out perfectly!

No leftovers says it all. Good thing I made extra. I made small modifications. Substituted Panko bread crumbs as I had no cracker crumbs. Added a few drops of Worchester sauce to the meatloaf mix. I did bake and drain the meatballs, serving them separately from the sauce. I split the ketchup into half ketchup and half bbq sauce. Spicy brown mustard, as I had no yellow. Few shakes of garlic powder and pepper. I cut down on the vinegar (too much) and brown sugar (used a brown sugar bbq sauce). Served on toasted sandwich rolls.

I just made this for supper tonight.  It is nice, I had all these ingredients in my house already.  I used Town House Crackers, and used 1 cup ketchup and a 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's original bbq sauce, and just a tad less vinegar than listed, otherwise did everything else as listed.  My kids loved them, I thought they were really good and really easy.  I will be making these again.

Very easy recipe.  I did make some changes to the flavoring.  I used half ground beef and half ground pork.  Added more spices like garlic powder, pepper, chili powder and cloves.  We didn't want a tangy sauce so instead of the ketchup etc. I put in a can of French onion soup and a can on cream of mushroom.  I also seared the meatballs and put them in a dutch oven.  Baked about 30 minutes and then drained the fat and added the sauce.  Family loved them.

Ive made these several times but if you're making them with beef you're going to want to bake them first and then drain the grease and then but them back in the oven or crockpot to finish off with the sauce mixture otherwise way to greasy.

Rally good recipe and super easy to make. We use oats instead of crumbs and we double the sauce and eat it with/over rice. Super easy dinner. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

very good, took others advice and bake the meatballs for 45 minutes first without sauce and added it for the last 15 after simmering it for a minute on the stove so the sugar melted. Delicious!

The. Best. Meatballs. Ever.

Totally addictive. They're even delicious cold the next day. I have made these a few times now, and they are always a huge hit.

The sauce smells a little strange at first, but trust me, it's delicious. The perfect balance of tangy and sweet and simply yummy.

Impossible to stop eating them.

Our favorite way to eat these is in Hoagie buns with a slice of Provolone.

Meatballs were ok.  Unfortunately, the sauce was not good at at all I could take was ketchup and mustard.  It was like eating a burger meatball.  Still on the search for a good tangy meatball recipe. I would not recommend or make this recipe again.

Everybody in the family liked it.  I baked the meatballs for awhile and drained the grease before adding the sauce.

I thought these were quite good, but maybe not the best.
I tried to make it exactly as written, using mostly 93% lean ground beef, and a bit of 85% I had on hand. For the cracker crumbs, I pondered a bit what kind of crackers to use - saltines? Ritz crackers? I finally decided to just crush a bunch of saltines. I judged the meatball size fairly accurately, since I yielded 37 meatballs, but I think a slightly bigger dish (than the 9x13 mentioned) would have been better - the dish was pretty crammed. The meatballs were midway between fall-apart and dense, and the sauce was good, but maybe a little too ordinary. Worth recommending anyway, even if this isn't the best meatball recipe ever.

Kids loved it, so amazing recipe in my books! I made a couple adjustments but nothing major. I cooked it in the oven for 15 min at 400F and then moved it to the crock-pot for 4 hours on low. It cut down on a lot of the grease and made it so we could eat at different times. I also added a small amount of BBQ sauce and pepper to the sauce, then topped it with pineapple. Yummy!

I love these.  I split it in half. part of the meatballs are in barbeque sauce and the other part in italian sauce.  the kids love both.  Plus you can smash a meatball between a small square dinner roll and we call them smash meatball sandwiches.  a favorite with the kids. I do 1/2 sauce at the begining and the rest towards the last 15 minutes or so.

Good tangy sauce. I cooked the meatballs for about half the time and then added the sauce. The kids like it served with pasta so I made extra sauce.  This dish also freezes well and is a great last minute dinner. Thanks!

Simple and tasty meatballs. I made it without the sauce -- just added a bit of ketchup to the meat mixture. Also added a bit of red bell pepper to up the veggie content for my toddler. Well done.
