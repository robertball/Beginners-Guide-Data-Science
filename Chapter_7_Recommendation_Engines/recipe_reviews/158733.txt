Great recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the broccoli. I would recommend partially precooking fresh green beans. Even though I added them with the first broth addition, they weren't done with the rice and other vegetables. I had to add more water and cover at the end to get them tender / crisp. This adjustment worked, and the taste was great. The feta went very well.  A good way to use the summer vegetables.

This is one of the best recipes that I've gotten off of AR.com. I followed it exactly as above and it was wonderful!

My partner and I both thought this was delicious! It turned out great even though this was my first time making risotto. I used a soup pot and made a double batch. This increased the cooking time by 15 minutes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly! I love feta but would be interested to try Parmesan. The pea pods and beans were not as tender as the broccoli and zucchini so I could see steaming them a bit. They were perfect for us! Will definitely make again.

I liked this.  I did leave out the celery and zucchini (personal preference), and added extra broccoli and some carrot to make up for it.  Will make again, but probably skip on adding the feta, as it is a nice vege risotto without it.

Extremely delicious and filling and surprisingly cheesy considering how little cheese actually goes into it.  It takes quite a while to make (you don't want to cut corners with risotto or the rice doesn't cook right), but it's more than worth it.  It is also very good leftover.

This recipe is a fantastic starting point for whatever veggies you have.  I used courgettes (zucchini), broad beans (flava beans) and broccoli and it was superb.  The broad beans were frozen so I boiled them for three minutes before adding them; but this turned out a treat.  A definite keeper, as it's not as full of fat as recipes with Parmesan Cheese.  Excellent.

Yummy!!!!
I cheated a little bit and used a mushroom risotto from trader joes.  I used the seasoning.  Probably made it not low sodium.  I added more vegetables, and only cooked them for 3 minutes. I like lightly cooked veges.  Also substituted parmesan for feta.
Delicious!  Will be making again!

This was an awesome risotto recipe-definitely worth the work.  I did not have broccoli, so I bumped up the amounts of the other vegetables instead.  I also used parmesan cheese instead of feta and added some salt and pepper.  Delicious!

If you like LEFTOVERS this is the recipe for you. When I first tried it I thought it was just ok... The next day I brought it to work for lunch and WOW it was fantastic. The flavours had infused the rice overnight. I rated it 4 stars because I found it to be pretty time consuming.

Excellent recipe. I subbed asparagus and zucchini for the broccoli and green beans, because that's what I had on hand. It does take a lot of stirring, but is excellent for special occasions.

Toddler loved it!  I was looking for an alternative to the broccoli cheese rice casserole made with cans of soup, and this is it.  The best part is you can use whatever veggies you have, and leave out ones you don't.  I used frozen broccoli florets, carrots, and celery, and my toddler couldn't get enough.  I also agree that the feta cheese goes a long way to make it seem really cheesy.  I let it simmer a little longer so the rice became softer.

I didn't like this at all. I followed directions exactly and found it sour tasting (vs rich) and for some reason celery was the predominant flavor. I used regular veggie broth but it would have been better with low/no salt broth. Some veggies were too crisp while some were soft and even with extra cheese, it was very....um...canned soup tasting. After reading all the 5 star reviews I was expecting a great meal but it was really disappointing for us. I will not make it again.

This turned out so good! I have never made risotto before, and it turned out just wonderfully! Almost like a restaurant. Wow. The only thing I changed was that I used parm instead of feta and I added carrots. So good, Thank you for the recipe!

Left out the broccoli because my boyfriend doesn't like it. This was very good and had a great creaminess to it. This would be a great recipe to experiment with different vegetables. I would try to cut down on the sodium by choosing low-sodium broth next time.

Awesome dish!  This was easy to make - my first time with risotto - and so delicious.  I was so happy to find a recipe without heavy cream.  Great leftover too!

Loved this! I  use instant rice because I'm impatient so I only use one can of the chicken broth (and I added some extra wine because I love the flavor) but I just let it simmer for about 5 mintues, then I threw in frozen broccoli, peas and green beans and fresh zucchini and simmer for another 5 minutes. The veggies had an amazing crunch and the feta cheese is a great touch.  I also added in some sage, rosemary and salt & pepper. It was delicious!

Fantastic! Seriously, make this now. I love the flavors of the white wine and feta in this. Risotto tip: Look for the edges of the rice to turn translucent before you add the liquid. And don't be afraid to cook this a little longer, it'll get creamier.

Loved it!!!  Be careful - don't add the veggies too soon - they will lose their emerald color and soggy and unappetizing.

Great recipe. Very flexible and adaptable - use any combination of veggies. We subbed parm for feta - personal preference. Only had Jasmine rice on hand. It  worked but took a significant amount of time longer to cook. Loved how it stretched a cup of rice into several servings and boosted the nutritional value.  Will make again

Surprisingly good because it didn't sound like it would be that great.  I used what I had - broccoli, zucchini, green peas, and spinach - it was good and we ate it all.  I think any vegetables would be good, along with a sub of parm if you don't have feta.  I used all the chicken stock which did take a long time, at least 20 minutes to cook and stir.  Worth it.  I think next time I will add something not green for color, like roasted red peppers.

Pretty good, although I made it a little less healthy with almost a full cup of parmesan instead of the feta. If there were some other major flavor involved, feta would have probably be fine. I thought this really needed a strong-flavored cheese. After reading reviews, I added the veggies just after I poured the second helping of broth.

This was quite good.  However, the amount of broth seemed a bit in excess of what I needed;  I ended up having to strain the last cup or so of liquid out to avoid the rice getting mushy.  Also, although I normally love zucchini, it got a bit bitter in this recipe.  I also pre-steamed the green beans a bit, which was probably a good idea.

Awesome !!   due to veggies in the house, did not use celery or snap peas but used asperagus.  I don't think it matters.  A great risotto for veggies. Highly recommend !

I was going to give this 3 stars because it was sooooo bland, but I realized since I gobbled it up it couldn't have been that bad.  I think the problem was I used low-sodium Trader Joe's chicken broth, which I recently read scored lowest on a taste test.  If I make this again I'll definitely upgrade brands (homemade would be best, but I won't kid myself into thinking that will ever happen).  Slight changes I made were grinding in a whole lot of pepper (a failed attempt to inject some flavor), using carrots and doubling the broccoli in lieu of peas and beans, and parm instead of feta.

It was my first time making risotto, but this was very easy and really delicious! I put in whatever vegetables I had-- the crunchiness of the celery and green beans was wonderful! I didn't have arborio rice, so I just used the regular short grain Japanese rice that we have around, and that worked fine for me. I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful! Make sure to use fresh veggies, as frozen ones add lots of water (and you want to maintain the temperature of the rice). As it is, the veggies come out crisp, so if you prefer them a little more cooked, it may be wise to throw them in a steamer for 3 minutes.

My whole family loved this dish.  I made a vegan version with hearty vegetable stock and no cheese (didn’t miss it at all). I threw in all the extra veggie trimmings into the stock as I was chopping so it had a rich flavor (removed them right before starting the risotto)  I also put the green beans in the last third of broth to blanch them so they were a bit softened before adding with the other vegetables.

Did the vegan version of this recipe and added asparagus.  I used frozen brocoli, beans and peas, but it's probably even better with fresh ones.

This was very good, I used broccoli, asparagus and red pepper as the vegetables, and Parmesan cheese instead of Feta. After adding the vegetables and the last of the broth, it took about 20 minutes for all the broth to be incorporated, but this allowed the vegetables to cook enough. I also added some dried basil.

Love this recipe! I make it all the time with whatever combination of green vegetables I have handy. I also use either feta or Parmesan and it’s equally good.

Did not like this dish at all. Followed the recipe provided and the dish had no flavor at all. All I tasted was bland green vegetables.

As a first time attempting Risotto, this was a great recipe. It was very good and I loved all the veggies.

New family favorite!  It helped that most of the greens came from our garden, but the combination of everything all together was delicious.  Husband had seconds, son had thirds saying, "Dee-lish!"  I made it without cheese because my husband can't have dairy products, but I did put in a good scoop of Earth Balance so it would have a little somethin' extra to replace the cheese.  I didn't stir it constantly and I think I ought to have. The rice wasn't quite done by the time all the broth was soaked in, so I made some more broth with Better Than Bouillon - too much, actually, so it all turned out a little soggy perhaps, but that didn't stop us from loving it.

Thought this was just ok.  I didn't have white wine in the house since I'm pregnant, so after doing some searching online, I used some ginger ale as a substitute.  Also, I omitted the green beans because the ones at the store didn't look so good.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as written.  Ultimately, I think it needs some more acid - maybe some lemon juice or maybe some halved or quartered cherry tomatoes (which ruins the "emerald green" effect, I suppose).  Might also be tastier with parmesan cheese.

best risotto recipe ever! I used more liquid (5 cups) and added it slower, like 1/2cup at a time to make sure it all got absorbed. I hate crunchy risotto, so this worked out great.

Made this for friends and they loved it!! A few changes i made based on what i already had.  i used barley instead of the rice bc i have had it around for so long, i wanted to finally use it.  I also had regular snap peas/pea pods, whatever they are called rather than sugar snap peas.  I added carrots instead of green beans just bc i didnt any beans, otherwise, i would have added them. I used lower sodium broth as well.  Tasted delicious!!!

Absolutely Delish! I live in a Uni Hall and this was a hit! Everyone can eat it gluten free, meat free and filling after a long hot day. You can add whatever veggies you want I added some carrot and cauliflower instead of celery. Thanks for possting a healthy risotto now I knwo what to do with all that arborio I accidentally bought!

Great - very healthy, packed with green veggies, but doesn't taste like health food.

Seriously this dish is divine!!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, omitted the beans and added mushrooms also used Veggie stock instead of the chicken.  When I cook my boyfriend usually says, it could have done with some of this... or it needs this... For the first time he said - it doesn't need a thing!! YUM. Would highly recommend this. Thank you.

I am a vegetarian so I used vegetable broth and omitted the cheese and the risotto turned out great! I cannot wait to make it again! Thank you for the recipe!
