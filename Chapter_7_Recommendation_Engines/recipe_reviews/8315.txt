I have been making a dessert like this for years. It has so many different names. My family likes it best with a graham cracker crust, and I always just use half the amount of milk than what it calls for on the box of pudding. We use all different kinds of puddings, but our favorite is still chocolate. We also top it with grated chocolate or drizzle it with chocolate syrup instead of using nuts. I really don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.

First thing my fiance said was "you better get your own spoon, I might miss a bite. This pan is definitely in trouble!"  Needless to say we enjoyed the Piggy Pudding. It did turn out a little watery and I think that is from the extra milk. Next time I will only use 2-2 12 cups of milk instead of three in the pudding. Watery or not it made piggys out of us!

I only gave 4 stars because I altered the recipe, my SIL makes a similiar dessert except she uses pistacio pudding and tops it with marchino (sp) cherries. I made this with a nilla wafer crust, I used the whole box, no nuts or flour just butter and baked for 15 minutes. also used 16oz of coolwhip with the creamcheese mixture, used a 5.9oz box of chocolate pudding instead of the 3.9 and topped with another 8oz of coolwhip and an entire bag of heath toffee bar pieces, so yummy!

Should only have 2 cups milk. 3 cups makes it too watery. Just follow the directions on the pudding box. Otherwise, it was delicious!

This recipe was fantastic!!! Everyone in the house loved it. From my 2yr old Granddaughter(She looked like a little piggy hen she was done.)to my husband who is not a sweet eater. Thank you Ginger for such a great recipe it certainly gets rave reviews at our house. And I have passed it around to all my friends... ;0)

Best dessert ever, but there is a mistake in this recipe. It should call for 2 3.9 oz packages of the chocolate pudding mix....that's why it's coming out watery.

Made before, but this time I lightened it up a bit by usining 1% milk and only 1/2 the amount listed, light cream cheese and light cool whip to cut back on calories.  Topped with chocolate sprinkles because my family doesn't like nuts.  No one seemed to miss extra fat and calories.

This is very good.  I've made it several times and it's always a hit.  The first time I followed the recipe, but I don't think the crust is that great.  The following times I've used a package of chocolate chip cookie dough and spread it on the bottom, baked first and then followed the recipe.  It's so much better this way!

I thought this was very good... but the crust lacked something.  I have not figured out what yet.  But still worth making (and eating too)!

I have made this recipe several times.  Love it.  We have used butterscotch, chocolate lemon and pistachio. Love it.  You can't go wrong.  Per a review, I am going to try cherry pie filling this year.  Sounds yummy.

The nutty flavor of the crust was perfect for the sweet filling. The only change I made was, used the amount of milk called for on the box of pudding.  Sweet tooth of the house said " Could you please make that again?"  Thanks for sharing.

This dessert is SOOOOO easy and everyone LOVES it. Simple and easy is the key to this one.  If you have a potluck or something to go to, this is perfect.  It is always a hit and you really can't mess it up.  JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU MAKE THE PUDDING ACCORDING TO PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.  DON'T TRY TO FOLLOW THE RECIPE FOR THAT PART.  Otherwise, I make it exactly as it is.  There is no need to change a thing.  You can make it with different puddings, but I think chocolate is the best!

I have been looking for the recipe.  this had been a famous desert in my family but everyone seemed to lose their recipe.  none of us could remember what the cream cheese layer was made out of.  We use pecans instead of walnuts and add a layer of french vanilla pudding too.  We always called it tuxedo pudding.  thanks for the recipe

Such a recipe can made so many ways, very versible, using different puddings, pie fillings, and different crust if want, the graham cracker crust instead.

This was pretty good but I didn't care much for the "crust"part. It seemed kinda bland or missing something. Wonder what it would taste like with a gram cracker crust instead or no crust at all ? My kids liked it just as it is.

This is a wonderful dessert.  Use two boxes of pudding.  The crust tastes better with pecans, and I like to put chopped up Heath bars on top.  It's always a big hit.

I have this recipe from an old family friend.  I was comparing recipes because I can't decide to make the flour crust or make the graham cracker crust - I see this recipe only uses 1/2 c. butter for the crust; mine says to use 3/4 cup.  Also agree that there should be two packages of pudding used.

Loved this one. I used the gram cracker crust. If  you put the pudding in the fridge for a few minutes before you spread it on it's perfect  using the full 3 cups of milk.

My sister got me on to this and I have been making it with all kinds of different toppings depending on the occasion and have made  half a recipe when there was only 2 of us and it turned out great.I did use a little less milk then what the pudding recipe calls for and it turned out nice.

This was pretty good. I didn't have walnuts, so I used Sundae topping in the crust and used heath toffee bar bits on top.  The family really enjoyed this!

This recipe should be one box of chocolate instant pudding and one box of vanilla instant pudding mixed with 3 cups milk for third layer. My family calls it "Fat-Man Pie".

I made this for Father's Day and it was a big hit.  My fiancee couldn't come until later and when he called I said "they ate all the cake don't bother coming"  I would cut back on the milk as it was slightly runny maybe 2 1/2 cps instead of 3.  Everyone wants me to make it again. Thanks for this recipe

This is ridiculously good. Wow. My husband said this may very well be the best thing he's ever had. I agree. A hit with everyone who tried it. I used light cream cheese, sugar-free/fat-free pudding, and sugar-free cool whip because that's what I had in the house. None of that seems to have affected the outcome and nobody would have guessed (probably because of the buttery shortbread crust, yum). Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this dessert. I know it as "instant torte". My mom has made this for years! We make it exactly the same way except only do one layer of the white and one of the brown. So good and easy!

This dessert is really good and everyone raved about it at my work. I would only want to make slight changes when I make it again. I think I will melt the butter to add with the flour or even just make a graham cracker crust instead. Also I don't think I will use the whole whipped topping container on top, probably just half. Otherwise this is really, really good! It makes a lot!

Rich flavor, easy to make, this was a great cool dessert. This isn't really a "cake" more like a flat pie. This makes a lot and it would be great for pot luck dinners. This could easily be changed to any flavor pudding you have handy or something you prefer. Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved this.  Took it to a dinner with friends.  It was a great hit.  The only difference I made was to not put the walnuts on top.  I used mini milk chocolate chips on top.

I made this delicious recipe last minute for my family at Christmas. I made it in the 9x13 pan and none was left. Literally people were scrapping the bowl asking for the recipe. The only change I made to the recipe that I feel made it better was that I made a homemade graham cracker crust that I prefer over the one listed in the recipe. Just a personal preference, but yes! We all pigged out on this one!! Make it! It’s awesome!!

This was a hit! I used 2 boxes of pudding following the directions on the pudding box. I think the chocolate layer would be too thin using 1 box. I added coconut on top of the crust and put it back in the oven until the coconut was toasted. I am going to make it again using crushed salted peanuts in place of the walnuts. Great recipe!

DH is on a low carb diet, but we were having company and I needed something that everyone could both have and enjoy. I used sf pudding mix, 1% milk, sf whipped cream, fat free cream cheese, and half whole wheat flour and half almond flour in the crust. Turned out great! No one would ever suspect the nutritional changes I made. I followed suggestions of others and doubled the cream cheese. Very glad I did, as the taste would have been lost otherwise. I did not use extra whipped cream or splenda in that layer as it was plenty sweet with the amount listed. Love finding recipes I can easily adjust to fit our needs without compromising quality.

This was a hit!  Added a TBLS of almond extract to the crust and added a layer of freshly sliced bananas on top of the pudding layer which made it taste like a banana split.  This made it a 5 star for my taste.

This is a great recipe that I have made for years.  Somehow I lost my recipe and came on here searching for it.  I'm afraid if you make as is, it will be a soupy mess.  I use 2 (3.4 oz) pudding mixes and make according to pudding pie directions, making the milk 2 1/2 cups.  Enjoy...this is a super yummy dessert!!!

I made this dessert for Valentine's Day for class. Everyone loves it! I did change few things 
-I use 2 cups for pudding instead 3 cups like other reviewers said too. 
-i use chocolate chips instead walnuts for ONLY SPRINKLE. (i don't have enough walnuts that's why!)

I was surprised the crust tasted as good as it did. I've had to made adjustments for our taste. I used two boxes of that size pudding only adding 4 cups milk total making it what I thought was the right thickness. (2 C. per box) I thought it tasted better with more chocolate in the layer and that was my reason for the 2nd box. I'll try this with graham cracker crust or pistachio pudding next and maybe chocolate flakes or chips on top.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe....my family used to make it and we lost the crust portion of the recipe.  Very creamy, and easy to change up with different flavors, or even make it with sugar free pudding and sugar substitute with the cream cheese.  For the milk amount, we always used the directions on the box of pudding.  Definitely the walnuts makes this dessert special!
