This is a great recipe for the old favorite! The only thing I did differently was add about 1/4 c more peanut butter (and I use creamy style) and also 1/2-3/4 c coconut just for extra flavor. Meanwhile A TIP for those that complained about the texture...it's all about the boiling time. If you underboil you will get cookies that won't set, if you overboil, you will get cookies that will crumble and not form at all. This recipe calls for 1 1/2 minutes. My suggestion for the perfect cookie is to time it from a FULL boil and do 1 1/2 minutes from that point. If you count from a simmer (just barely bubbling) then make it 2 - 2 1/2 mins tops! You will have to play with it to see how your stove heat, etc. Hope that helps!! Good cookies tho!! 5 stars!

Great texture, so easy and quick to make!  After many no-bake failures, I've learned that you have to use 1-minute quick oats, and that it is SOOOO important to have all of the ingredients ready and to have the wax paper prepared on the counter.  Once you turn on the stove there isn't much time to waste.

My family and friends love this cookies. I do have problems with them setting.  The last time I made them, I used a candy thermometer to make sure that I boiled them long enough.  I had to boil the mixture about 2.5 minutes for the temperature to reach the soft ball stage.  The cookies set perfectly.

I lost my recipe for no-bakes and this one looked familiar.  But alas when you know what you are looking for in taste then nothing else will do! I made these cookies and immediatedly thought something was wrong.  Too runny and shiny.  The taste was off too. 
So I thought real hard and realized I only used 1/4(1/2 stick butter) and the amount of peanut butter(the taste was missing) was wrong. I reinvented this recipe and I think I have my old one back. I reduced the cocoa to 3 Tbsp., the sugar to 2 C.(because I remember that much about old recipe) and the peanut butter to 1 Cup (Natural is best).  And I think I got my old recipe back.  Thank-you Denise for the basic ingredients but the quantities had to be modified.

I just made this recipe...I did add a slight amount more oatmeal than called for because it seemed like it should have been a little thicker.  Also, I added the vanilla into the wet stuff way before adding the PB and oats.  Also--I didn't time it.  Apparently people have a very difficult time with this step--I have no idea why!  I brought it to a rolling boil, stirred it a little, and then took it off the heat after I thought a couple minutes passed.  I am sure I cooked it longer than the 90 seconds posted.  Lastly, I stirred in the PB after turning the heat off and stirred the PB to let it completely melt before adding the oats.  After dropping on wax paper, I waited an hour, and they were PERFECT!!  DEEEEEELICIOUS!

This is one of the old favorites.  The key is to boil exactly one minute from the time it hits a rolling boil, then remove from the heat and to stir constantly while it boils.  Excellent!

These are awsome!!!  The nice thing is that I had everything for them already in my kitchen!!  I made these EXACTLY by the recipe and they turned out perfectly.  Just a hint:  once you drop them onto the wax paper, go back and "push" each one together so that you end up with less little crumblies.

I made this recipes twice following the directions and ingredients exactly and they turned out crunmbly each time. The second time I even decreased the cooking time to 1 minute, and still a crumbly mess. They tasted good, but I hate how they crumble everywhere. I am still looking for a chewy no bake cookie.

These were delicious!! I used creamy peanut butter, instead of crunchy. These disappeared fast, and i would make them again and again!

I have always had crumbly cookies, but this recipe was perfect!! The only thing I did different was add creamy peanut butter because I don't like chunky.

I found it really helpful to have all the ingredients ready to dump in.

I tried this recipe last night and again this mormomg. The first time I made them (last night), it took a little longer for them to set up. When I made them again this morning, they set up within a few minutes. My hubby said this mornings cookies were better, that the chocolate tasted like candy bar chocolate.

Since he liked them so much better, here is how I made them this morning. 

I started my pan on low and added butter (it was cold, right from the fridge). I mixed the milk and cocoa together first, so the wasn't clumpy, and then poured it in. I didn't add the sugar all at once. As the butter melted more, I would added a little bit of the measured sugar (just enough to make it thick again). After the butter was all melted and the sugar was in. I turned up the heat (gas stove) and stirred as it boiled for the 1 1/2 minutes (this is where I had always gone wrong before). I turned off the heat and moved the pan to a different burner, added the peanut butter and when it was mostly melted in, I added the vanilla and finally the oats.

It was just so simple, that this is now our only No Bake Cookie recipe.
Thanks for sharing!!

For once I was trying desperately to follow this recipe exactly so I could give it a fair rating! Unfortunately, I discovered I didn't have any vanilla extract, so I had to substitute almond extract. I think these were still delicious. They are definitely SWEET. Don't expect otherwise and you won't be disappointed!

I've made these from memory since I was about ten years old.  I decided to see how this recipe compares to the one given to me by my mother.  It's close to identical.  Just a couple of tips: add a quarter tsp of salt to the sugar/cocoa and use real butter;  also, use a little more peanut butter than the recipe calls for and an additional tsp of vanilla (amazing how much difference this makes!).  Also, the key - as others have mentioned - is the right boiling time.  I've messed up so many batches this way.  The 1.5 minutes is PERFECT.  But you have to wait until it comes to a full rolling boil to start the countdown.  Don't wait too long or you'll get a dry nasty batch, and don't start too soon or you'll end up with cookies that never set.  GREAT recipe here!!!

great quick recipe.  Definitely wait till it comes to a full boil before counting the 1.5 minutes.  Also, I didn't have crunchy peanut butter, at the very end I added crunched up mini pretzels to the mix...and O my goodness...DELISH.  Sweet and Salty Heaven

I have tried making no-bake cookies for 30 years. Sometimes they would turn out okay and other times they would not set up. This recipe is perfect everytime. None of my previous recipes told how long to boil the mixture before adding the oats and peanut butter. This recipe plainly states 1 1/2 minutes of boiling time. I have found this was where I was making my mistake. Try it !!!

I have made these so many times this summer it's crazy. The first time they wouldn't set right and were soft and mushy but the next and each after I timed it right and they turned out fabulous. I've added coconut to one batch and once when I ran out of milk I used vanilla coffee creamer. I've gotten requests for the creamer ones again. DD loved it!

My first time making these, I followed the instructions exactly, and the cookies were good, but turned out too runny/sticky, too sweet, and too shiny.  The next time I made them, I changed the sugar to 1 1/4 cup and the oats to 3 1/2 cups, and they turned out perfect! Great recipe though!  It gave me a base to work from for my own preferences!

I've made no bake cookies for years and always turn to them for comfort food.  I never have had a recipe written down so I always end up on the internet looking for one.  Today I ran into this one and I'll definitely be putting this one in my recipe file!  The addition of extra peanut butter and coconut as a previous reviewer suggested made these already wonderful cookies, even more wonderful.  These are the absolute best!

This is identical to the one I have used for years that I got in home economics class way back in the 60's.  Its the best one ever.  I agree the trick is to boil 1 minute to 1 1/2 minutes from a rolling boil and they set perfectly!

These were great! I live in Denver at a higher altitude. So to tweak, I used about 1 TBSP less sugar, & boiled 1 min 45 sec, & got great results. If you prefer your no bake to not be slightly gooey, I would increase that to about 2 minutes at high altitude.

Finally!  Seriously, I've been trying to make No-Bakes for the last 5 years with no luck.  I was able to successfully make them in high school all the time, but not since.... until today!  I've tried different methods, recipes, etc.  I chose this one because it has a little less sugar than some.  (Still a lot of sugar though, and I would reduce it, but I think that's why mine have not set up in the past).  I read a bunch of reviews on this recipe, and other no-bake recipes on this site.  Decided to boil the mixture for 2 minutes after it came to a rolling boil, and then I boiled it a little more.  I cooked it to about 230 degrees (using my meat thermometer, lol) because some reviewers said to cook to the soft-ball stage, but I was afraid to cook it too long, so I stopped at 230.  Used natural peanut butter, and a mix of quick and old-fashioned oats, adding about 1/4 cup extra.   After about 20 minutes, these cookies had set up perfectly, I can actually pick one up and eat it!  Every other time I've tried to make them in the past few years, they stay goopy, soft, and just not right.  They set up perfectly today.  Thanks for the recipe, and thanks everyone here for their great and helpful reviews!

This is the first cookie I every made, some 43 years ago. The difference in my recipe and this one, 2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa, 2 cups oatmeal and boil for 1 minute. If it is humid, I always increase the time by 15 seconds and have never had them fail.

We were in the process for renovating our kitchen and I was looking for a recipe that didn't involve an oven.  I made these to take to a weekend event and everyone liked them, but my niece especially loved them and ate half the batch!  I thought they were just okay.

Love this recipe over the other ones I have tried.  Instead of the normal 2 cups, I think the smaller amount of sugar works best (I use even less).  I do add more peanut butter (about 3/4 cup), and it is perfect for my taste.  I make these every week for the FCA kids at school, because they keep asking for them!

This is one of the easiest recipes for the Vegan's in my family.  I just substitute soy milk and vegan spread and serve to all the vegans.  Fast and easy.  Thanks.

First time ever making these. Followed the directions exactly, for the most part...at least the boiling part. I eyeballed the peanut butter and vanilla and used old fashioned rolled oats because I never buy quick oats. They set up nicely and tasted delicious and were not crumbly at all! Super easy, definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Though even my husband who has the sweetest tooth of anyone I know says they'll put you in a diabetic coma. I think cutting the sugar back by 1/3 would take nothing away from them.

First time making no-bake cookies and these came out AMAZING!  Only thing I didn't do was add vanilla because I am snowed in and don't have any.  I will be making these again and again for sure!

I made these saturday with my kids and they turned out great! I didn't exactly let them boil as long maybe only 45 seconds or a minute and they are so creamy and moist! Everyone loves them! We made 3 batches they were so good! So maybe that will help to those who got dry ones, don't let it boil as long!

The recipe with 3 T of cocoa powder is much better.  Or just use this recipe, with less cocoa.

These came out perfectly on my first try! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I should mention that I heated the sugar, milk, butter, and cocoa on medium-low heat until the butter was fully melted and then turned the heat up to about medium-high to bring to a boil, and boiled for exactly 90 seconds after that. These were just what I was craving! Thanks!

Try substituting 1 pack of any maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal within the 3 cups required. It adds a unique and flavorful aspect.

I waited until the sugar/butter/milk/mixture was at a FULL rolling boil before I began timing. These came out great, but took a very long time to harden. I was expecting them to be ready once they cooled, but it took much longer than that before they were ready to eat. I ended up just letting a bunch of them sit out overnight, and in the morning they were perfect.

If I make these again, I will reduce the sugar by 1/4 or 1/2 cup. I love sweet chocolatey things, but I felt like I was eating spoonfuls of sugar when I ate these. That didn't stop me from eating them though, they were delicious!

a long lost family recipe.  Thanks for posting Denise. i didn't have any problem with the cooking time, but I remember these being tastier when I was younger, but I think the last time I had one of these cookies was about 36 years ago! Maybe more peanut butter!

Great recipe, it has replaced the recipe Ive used for years :) One tip to know if you have reached "hard boil" stage you can take a small glass of water and drop a few drops of your mixture in the water, if it stays in a ball youve made it if it spreads out your not there yet.

I remember these as a kid, but I don't recall making them as an adult.  These were just as good as I remember :-)  I followed the recipe except I added the oats last.  Vanilla, then PB, then oats.  Right on the money.  Thanks for the memories :-)

Only change I made was to use smooth peanut butter and I used the new Jif Natural.  The cookies turned out perfectly!!  My little guy is gobbling them up.  Thanks for the recipe.  The boiling time is perfect.

The trick to this recipe is to follow instructions exactly and use ONLY OLD FASHIONED OATS.  The quick oats will start cooking and your cookies will be soupy.  I have the original recipe.

Super easy. I made two batches within a week and this was so easy. I stirred the sugar mixture over low-med heat for about 10-15 minutes to make sure that the sugar was disolved before bringing it to  boil. After turning off the burner, I stirred in the peanut butter and vanilla until melted before adding the oatmeal. Makes it a lot easier to stir all of the oatmeal in without chunks of peanut butter here and there in the finished cookies. I made fudge before the cookies and had a dab of marshmellow fluff left over so I added it to the cookies and they are fantastic! Thanks!

Thanks! I had this recipe a long time ago and lost it...these are the best cookies. We can hardly let them set before we start eating them. I put an extra spoonful of peanut butter, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, boiling time, etc and they're perfect!!!

This is the original receipe.  I had lost mine and was happy to find it here.  The only difference is I boil 3 minutes.  I had bought some natural peanut butter with no sugar in it that worked fine in this recipe.

Recipe is tasty! One thing was to be sure that the peanutbutter is melted in nicely before adding the oatmeal, otherwise it's hard to blend the pb in well.  If your cookies are too soft, put them in the fridge and eat them cold-still delicious.

These cookies taste delicious!  So why the 4 star?  Well, if you like chewy soft no bakes, this recipe is perfect for you, but if your like me and like them to be a tad on the hard side, add more oats.  I made these twice, the first exactly as the recipe calls for, and they barely even set, so I made them again 2 days later, adding an additional 1/4 cup of oats, and increasing the boiling time to 2 1/2 minutes, and they came out perfect.  They still have the same great taste when made either way.

Having made no bake cookies very frequently growing up, I was looking for a close recipe to make them again.  I never used peanut butter growing up because my dad didn't like it but I've made this recipe with it included and found it to be very good - not an overwhelming peanut butter taste like I've had before.  I do think the boiling time is the key and 2 minutes seems more ideal for me.  Good cookies!

Love this recipe! I always use creamy peanut butter because I prefer it and Nesquik powder for the unsweetened cocoa powder because when I first made it I used Nesquik and it came out perfectly.

My mamaw made these for us when I was a girl and now I make them for my own grandchildren.  Here's the trick for nice, firm cookies -- do not make them when it's raining.  High humidity keeps the cookies from "setting".  But they're always good on a spoon!  Another trick is to keep them in a ziplock bag in your freezer.  It keeps them tasting fresh like the day you make them.  My grandmother called them "boiled cookies", but my granddaughter calls them "frozen cookies":)

Whomever posted the tip about starting the timer once you have a rolling boil, thank you!!  That was very helpful. The first batch I made of these came out well, just like I remembered them from back in the day. I always seem to wish they were a bit chocolate-yer. I tried them a second time in the same week, but replaced the peanut butter with nutella!! Much more chocolatey!  (Everything else stayed the same...)

Love these cookies!! quick and so easy. This was always my mothers go to recipe when she needed something sweet, easy and fast. I started making this myself @ about the age of 10 and always made it for my children and now my grandchildren. I have recently made these with my granddaughter and use less sugar about 1 cup and natural peanut butter.

My mom used to make these. She called them chocolate haystacks. I was worried about these for a bit the first time I made them. After over an hour, they were still gooey and kind of greasy. A few hours later, though, they had set up just like I remembered. I like them better with 1/4 cup less sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt added.

TASTY!  Next time I will modify it just a little bit because they are honestly just a little TOO sweet (and that's something coming from me).  I would recommend adding slightly less butter and sugar than called for in the recipe.  

DELICIOUS!

I used this recipe in a pinch because I could not find my mother's recipe. It turned out very nicely although they were a little crumbly. I did learn however that this happened because I'd boiled it too long, not because of a flaw in the recipe. I'd warn folks NOT to boil ANY longer than recommended.

Perfect. And they did taste better the next day after they set all the way. I put a piece of wax paper in between each one in a tupaware containier. Turned out great!

These could not have been more easy to make- seriously, one pot, 10 minutes, and you're done.  And they turned out soooo tasty.  I made the mistake of giving a little piece to my one year old and he kept running back to the kitchen counter and pointing at them.  2 tips though: Mix in the peanut butter and vanilla in thouroughly before you add the oats, and don't wait at all before dropping them onto the wax paper- it gets harder to do the more they cool.

These are ALWAYS good!  And I love that the ingredients are usually on hand.  I didn't have butter OR stick margarine, so I used my light tub margarine and reduced fat peanut butter.  I used just a tad less milk to make up for the extra water in the tub margarine and they came out GREAT! Using a cookie scoop works great too.

I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems with the cookies setting properly. You have to make sure you use quick oats and don't overboil the milk mixture! Delicious just the way the recipe is :)

I tried to follow the recipe exactly but came up short 1C of oats. I took some dry cho mein noodles and crunched them a bit to make-up the missing C of oats. The taste is very good and they look very appealing. They are a bit more moist than I recall no bakes being but set up pretty well(over night). I will make these again; for certain I will use ALL oats and add 1/3C more based on another review.

I was craving something sweet and easy when I came across this recipe. I wasn't sure if I wanted to make a whole batch so I modified it and only made a dozen. What a big mistake that was! Now I have to go back and make more. I ate 4 of them while they were still warm, they were that good. 

I used creamy peanut butter instead and you MUST start timing right after the boiling point in order for them to roll properly. Thanks for that tip. 

My batch came out perfectly and were fast and easy to make. This is a keeper for sure.

A five all the way! I wanted to make something for an after school snack for the kids but didn't have any eggs, so my options were limited. Found this recipe and the kids (and I!) loved them. I have tried no bake cookies before and if I remember correctly they didn't set properly, but these set beautifully. I didn't have crunchy peanut butter but the creamy worked out just fine. Thanks Denise!

These were yummy cookies, just like I remembered...EXCEPT...I changed a few things and they didn't set up very well.  First off, I cooked these 2 minutes after the ingredients started boiling, and they only set up slightly.  I could still remove the cookie intact, but it was so soft that it eventually fell appart.  I think that the best way to make sure that these come out right is to just break out the candy thermometer and cook it till it reaches the "soft ball" stage.  It just really beats trying to guess it and messing up an entire batch.
Secondly, I didn't have some of the exact ingredients either.  I only had old fashioned oats, cause that is all my family will eat, and I didn't have any butter, so I substituted margerine.  This made the oats not quite done, and the margerine may have been the cause for it not setting up right.  Overall, the flavor was wonderful.  But I am still on the journey of experimentation to perfect this cookie.

When I was a teenager my sister and I used to get up during a commercial break and while she was pouring ingredients in the pan I was stirring and by the time our show came back on everything would be melted together and we would eat them straight from the pan with a spoon. They never needed to set up because they didn't last that long. Now though as I make them for my family I am glad to have found the timing to make them set up. We used to add a little corn syrup to them but they taste just fine without it.

Oh, Denise, Denise, Denise!  Thank You so much for this recipe.  I lost mine and even though I make plenty of pastries these are one of my families favorites.  The only thing I did differently was add a pinch of salt. It really enhances the flavors.  My following any recipe this close is a miracle. Thank You again and God Bless!

I had a craving for these and I looked this up. There are several on this site and they're all pretty similar. Many people complain about their "cookies" not setting up properly. The recipes don't seem specify the heat at which to bring the mix to a boil. I think that's key. One recipe specified medium heat and I did that. It takes longer to come to a boil that way. The cookies set up and the texture is creamy. (oops. I used creamy peanut butter. shhh) They're delicious. 
Incidentally! I made these a couple years ago with a vegan. We subbed almond milk for dairy and coconut oil for butter. It worked and they tasted the same.

I lost my favorite no-bake recipe in a tornado long ago... Needless to say, this is the first time I have made these in years.  I just made this recipe and tasted them. Absolutely perfect. I don't know how the rest of you came out with crumbly cookies. No-bakes must be measured perfectly to get the desired texture. I used a timer for exactly 1.5 minutes from the start of a full-pan rolling boil and stirred unil I took off the burner (otherwise, you will end up crystalizing that sugar, yuck)

Exactly like I remember from when I was a kiddo! My husband claims these are "exactly like moms"! 
You CAN"T mess these up! I am not a baker and these turn out wonderful each and every time! 
The only change to this is that I do add about a cup of  creamy peanut butter instead of 1/2 cup of crunchy!!

I made these cookies and they were wonderful. I timed it right before a full boil and they set very nicely. I just added more oats because the mix was thin.

I was given a hostess gift of a jar of Peach Amaretto Pecan Honey Butter which was looking for a recipe.  Given the heat, this seemed a good choice.   Replacing the peanut butter with this gave these a flavor that is much more complex (and really good),  although I do remember liking the original flavor from childhood as well.  Given that change, I reduced the sugar to one cup only and added an extra half cup of oatmeal.  I wish I would have tossed in some chopped pecans as well, both for texture and for the salt..  If you are looking to reduce the sugar amount I think you could easily use one cup no matter what additions you would make as these are very sweet.  Adding coconut would also be a good option to add to the texture.  The instructions for these are perfect.  I did put them in cupcake liners given other reviews of not setting up.  It wasn't necessary, although turned out to be a good choice as I tossed them all into ziplocs and then into the freezer.  Take one out and let it sit 5 minutes on the counter.  The paper peels easily, you can use it as a finger-protector and it this makes a really nice, cool summertime treat.

I was a little skeptical at first about making these cookies. I am not a fan of peanut butter at ALL and I had been told that without it, they just wouldn't be as good. So finally I decided that it's better to try and fail than to wonder all my life. Excellent Decision. Followed the recipe exactly except, I didn't have any cocoa powder and I had the peanut butter issue. I eliminated the peanut butter altogether and subsituted Nutella instead. They se perfectly and were delicious. Yum!

This is the one I have been looking for!! I followed directions exactly and they turned out perfect. I have always had a hard time getting them to set up, even with a candy thermomoter. But I waited for a FULL rolling boil THEN started timing. I boiled for 1 1/2 minutes and they have turned out perfectly every time. Thanks so much Denise!

I'm not sure why this got such high ratings.  Maybe I did something wrong - but this turned out more like a topping for ice cream, maybe - rather than a cookie

Honestly, I am not a baker hence my search for a no-bake cookie. I was a little worried w/ all the comments on the exactness of things, so hoped I wouldn't screw it up. It was super easy and the cookies are yummy! I did reduce the sugar by 3/4 cup and add to the peanut butter by about 1/2 cup, like a lot of reviewers did. It does take quite a long time for the cookies to set (hours) and one batch may not set right and I think may be due to just a little too much milk. Other than that, I followed the recipe and am happy with the results.

This is one of the best recipes I have used for no bake cookies. I was able to substitute margarine for butter cause I didn't have enough butter and I used regulars oats instead of instant....Mmmm Mmmm Good!!

When I make this recipe I use creamy peter pan peanut butter (sometimes mixed with crunchy and also honey flavored P.B. made by Jiff) and I always add a little more cocoa....maybe 2 tablespoons more than what the recipe calls for. Since I started adding more cocoa and using the honey,I have to make more than just 36 cookies because friends who rarely just stop by are finding any excuse to "be in the neighborhood" so when I make the recipe for 50 servings they are gone in 2 days tops! 
To sum up use more cocoa and use peter pan creamy mixed with Jiff honey, and also crunchy peanut butter! People will rant and rave over it and beg you to make more!

These cookies are awesome and super easy! To get the correct consistency, I followed the advice of another reviewer and (literally) set a stop-watch for 1 1/2 minutes once the sugar, butter, cocoa powder, and milk came to a rolling boil. After the 1.5 minutes, I promptly removed it from the heat and quickly added the pb, oats, and vanilla. The cookies stayed together perfectly and were even better the second day! My fiance (who hardly eats any sweets because he doesn't care for them (especially anything made with pb)) loved them. These were a hit and will definitely become a cookie staple in our household!

I made these just now...and wow! They were really yummy and super easy. Just follow instructions. I did stir the whole time I was cooking them. I want to try them with Coconut milk and extract. I think they will taste like an Almond joy candy bar. Thanks for the new cookie reciepe and idea.

these are very yummy and bring me back to memories with my grandmother!  The only thing I want to stress in the directions is when bringing the mixture to a boil, maintain the boil or 1 1/2 minutes or the cookies will not harden when cooling!

I have been trying for years to get these cookies right, and I have never been able to. I made these cookies with only a few adjustments and they are amazing!! I used 2 c. sugar, creamy peanut butter, and only 2 cups oatmeal instead of 3. Everything else I did exactly like it said. This is the first time I have ever been able to eat them without a spoon or when they were hard. Thank you so much!!

I have made this recipe many times. These are tips I remember from my mother as I first started making them. 1. Do not make these on a rainy day they will not set properly. 2. Do not use a teflon(non-stick) coated pan, again they will not set properly. Both of these tips were givin to me as an adult after calling my mother to see what went wrong. I hope this will help all of you whom are unhappy with your results.

I made this recipe because a co-worker brought some to work and they were delicious. While I have made these TWICE now, and they ARE delicious, they do not harden! they don't crumble but they remain feeling like cookie batter, and they feel wet. They don't harden like my co-workers did so I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

That's a darn good cookie!  I have tried No Bake cookies before and failed horribly, so I was grateful for the tip to let the liquid come to a rolling boil and time it 1 1/2 minutes from there.  Worked perfectly and they set up so nicely.  I put my vanilla in with the sugar/butter combo, added my peanut butter until it was completed melted in and then added the oats.  The result was fantastic!

I had my husband make these when I was feeling under the weather (bless him but he can't cook) but the cookies turned out great!  I also have made them since and they turned out just as well.  Unlike some of the no bake cookies recipes I have made over the years this one is NO FAIL!

Fantastic!  I left it at a rolling boil about 2 minutes.  Texture was perfect and they held together perfectly. Because one reviewer said they were awfully sweet I cut sugar to 1 1/3 cup and they were still a bit too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll use 1 cup.  I used a 'heaping' 1/2c peanut butter (probably 3/4 cup).  I melted the vanilla and peanut butter into the chocolate mixture until smooth before adding the oats.  And I did NOT use quick oats (I saw some reviews that said you must).  Either is fine.  Cooking oats are less processed and a bit better for you.  You cookie might be a little more chewy.  I don't think I can tell the difference.  Great recipie!

These are great. They turned out perfectly.  Also,anyone who gives this recipe a lousy review based on their own lack of cooking skills,or simply because they didn't follow the recipe correctly, aren't being fair. You can't down a recipe for failing when it was because of you the recipe failed.

GREAT Recipe.  Just like Grandma used to make!!  The trick to Perfect No Bakes is to heat over MEDIUM HEAT.  If it is too hot to fast it will crumble.  Not hot enough to gooy.  There is a trial and error to this but I would call it "user error"  Make ..  Eat .. & Enjoy.  These are our favorite.

I have to admit that I am not the best cook/baker, but when I made these cookies and followed the directions they turned out perfect.  I made these years ago and they didn't turn out as well, so I have avoided making them again... until now.

The flavor was really good and the cookies held their shape fairly well.  However I think I boiled them for too long or something cause they seemed "grainy" to me and kind of hard.  People still loved them.  I just think they could have been a little bit better.
Probably my error and not something wrong w/ the recipe though.

Scrumptious!!!  Their flavor reminds me of homemade peanutbutter fudge. I agree with the other reviewers that you have to let the mixture boil long enough or the cookies won't set as firmly as needed. However, that hasn't stopped us from scooping up spoonfuls of soft set cookies. My kids usually have at least one while the rest are cooling/setting. I got approx. 30 average sized cookies.

Theres cookies were very good.  I only gave them 4 stars because I think they would be better with creamy peanut butter. They just didn't taste peanut buttery to me.  I also boiled using a candy themometer to about 250 degrees, which took about a minute longer than the recipe said and the texture turned out perfect.

I love these cookies and have been making them ever since I was a little girl. However, half of the time the cookies wouldn't set  up properly since my recipe said to boil for only 1 min. So, I scanned all of the no-bake recipes to see what was going wrong. I was thankful that your recipe told me the trick to getting them to set up. Thanks

Satisfy your chocolate/peanut butter cravings FAST!  These no-bake cookies are a breeze to whip up, and can be made with regular oats as well, for a slightly chewier texture.  I genenrally use a bit more cocoa powder because of my chocolate addictions...

There is only one word to describe these cookies.  DELICIOUS!!!  They are the same cookies that my mom made when I was a child and I like them as much now as I did then!  My children love them as well.

These were smacking easy to make and they turned out very well. Soft. Though I think my oats weren't cooked all the way thru, they were tasty. It takes quite awhile for these cookies to set, even when placed in the fridge.

This is a classic recipe that my family loved the flavor! My biggest flaw with this recipe is that after twice baking the recipe listed above I could not get the cookies to harden. They were gooey. So the third time that I made them I did things a little differently. Instead of boiling for 1-1/2 minutes I boiled the necessary ingredients for two minutes before removing it from the heat. I also added in four cups of oats rather than three cups. I would also make sure that you use a good quality, unsalted butter. The sticks of butter worked the best for me. The cookies harden in no time and were not dry or crumbly!

With any recipe I think it's a learning process as you bake you learn more. If you are looking for a recipe with great flavor, this is it!

I've made so many batches of no bake cookies in my life I'm known as the "no bake lady" ... I make on average one batch a week. I've tried every recipe and this is my stand by. My tips: increase the pb by a tablespoon or 2.. I increase the cocoa measurement a bit too for a richer flavor. have EVERYTHING measured and ready to go before you turn on the heat..When mixture reaches an EVEN ROLLING BOIL (md heat) , COOK FOR EXACTLY 1 1/2 min (I use a stopwatch).. immediately remove from heat and add dry ing. I add an additional half cup of oats, and my secret ing that sets mine apart and causes much love is cinnamon. just enough so you can taste it but not overwhelm the cookies. I've never had a problem getting mine to set up quickly.. but I know it's easier said then done! My mom can make crazy complicated desserts but gave up on no bakes cause she can never get em to set. practice makes perfect! ENJOY!

These are one of my all time favorite. I Remember as a kid my Aunt shipping these to my Dad for Christmas each year. Now I include them in my holiday cookie platters.  1st time I added the peanut butter, that definitely keeps them moist longer. Made three batches this holiday season. I'm Going to try and freeze them.

Great Recipe!  Tips: 1. The pot needs to be bubbling evenly throughout before you countdown from 1:30.  2. Let them sit in the pot for 5 or 6 minutes while you clean up.  The cookies end up being thicker when they are dropped. 3. Quantity!!  In my house, small dessert is laughed upon.  If you make your cookie drops about 3"x2" , this recipe makes between 22 and 26 cookies.  If you make them 1x1, that's flirting with the concept of a cookie, and then you have to eat 6 of them, and the self-loathing creeps in, then... Just make them big.

My kids LOVE these cookies..so easy. Next time Im going to try making a "pan" version though to get a more consistant size. I also use 1/2 creamy and 1/2 crunchy peanut butter.

Made these for my family, and we LOVE them! Everything went perfectly following the recipe. Only thing changed was the use of creamy peanut butter, instead of crunchy (we aren't fans). Thanks for the recipe!!

Real butter is essential here. I prefer evaporated milk or at least 2%,  4 heaping Tablespoons of dark cocoa. a dash of salt, and creamy Skippy peanut butter. My cousin likes a stronger flavor, so for him I use 2 full cups sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa, and 1 cup peanut butter.

Really liked this recipe. I did use creamy peanut butter instead of the crunchy. Also added an extra tablespoon
Of cocoa.

I love these cookies but had given up making them since my son is allergic to peanuts. But my friend gave me the simple and amazing idea to replace the peanut butter with Nutella. I did it with this recipe and it worked great and tasted wonderful!

Great recipe.  Thank you for posting it.  I used creamy peanut butter.  I don't like the crunchy stuff.  Otherwise, pretty much followed this recipe exactly.

I have made no bakes for more than 15 years and this is the best recipe thus far. The only thing I did different was I did not add Vanilla because my three year old was helping. SO it was forgotten and they turned out great! Not to sweet and not to bitter.

My family absolutely love them. I altered the recipe to 48 serviings and when you do that it ups the Sugar to 2 1/3 cups. So I change the sugar content to 1 cup regular sugar and 1 1/3 cup of Splenda.  The cookie still firms up but is soft and chewy and I help cut the sugar down on the cookies for my family.

favorite base recipe, super fast and easy.  When I want cookies - I want them now, not in 30 minutes.  made healthier by using half the sugar, and sub carob powder (gives a bit of a fruity taste) and almond butter,  and add 3/4C raw honey after (to retain all the nutrients) mixing in oats/pb/vanilla.  I throw in chia/hemp seeds too :).

Hubby approves, which mean a lot.  Used 1 full cup crunchy peanut butter, and 3 tablespoons dark cocoa powder.  Next time, will use less butter.  After bringing to a full boil, boiled 1 minute and removed from heat, stirring until it quit boiling.  Added in the peanut butter and melted it before adding the vanilla and then the quick oats.  Yummmm.   Thanks for sharing!

These no-bake cookies were just about how I remember no-bake cookies from my childhood. I added some shredded coconut to give them a bit more texture. Delicious.

It is hard for me to rate it by stars yet because I did not follow the directions to a "T" and did not read some of the reviews until after because I was so excited about making cookies.  But I do know that not following the boiling directions as said then you will left with either crumbly and overboiled or undercooked and floppy cookies.  And the floppy ones are what I have right now.  Darn!

Follow the other people for the right boiling instructions.  I was too worried that I would overcook them that I didn't pay attention to time.

I am only giving this 5 stars because the recipe is fantastic and easy as pie and I think everyone should try them. However, no one needs this much sugar in their cookies! I have cut my sugar down to 1 cup with success everytime and the cookis did not lack in taste or texture. Just don't over boil. I also add a pinch of salt. When my daughter and I ate the original 2 cups of sugar version we had headaches from all the sugar.

Thank you to those that took the time to explain the boiling part! I have tried in complete vain many many times over 25 years to make these. Today I finally understood the boiling of the sugar, butter, milk, cocoa is like making candy. DUH to me!!! I followed the recipe and it turned out just fine, but if I hadn't read the hints I would have another batch for the garbage! Thank you again.

Wonderful recipe, sent them to my boyfriend who lives far away.  My only complaint would be that the oats were rather chewy and I was expecting them to be softer, but  overall this was a wonderful recipe that I will be using again!

This is great with the addition of peanut butter - I added all-natural peanut butter, so the cookie wasn't as sweet - it worked out great!

My boyfriends mom used to always make these for him and I wanted to try but didnt want to use her recipe, to see if i could make my own. I followed this one exactly and they turned out amazing! The second batch I added n extra spoonful of crunchy peanut butter and it just made it even better! Once I even ran out of milk and used my vanilla soy milk and it turned out just as good, if not better! :) Love this recipe!

The cookies turned out awesome! I made sure to wait until the water came to a full roiling boil before starting the timer and made sure to have all ingredients ready and waiting for when the timer went off and the cookies turned out perfectly.

Sweet and delicious! They could do with less sugar, though- next time I will use only 1 cup.  They set up fine, and had a great texture.  I did watch the timer- and brought them to a complete boil before I timed them for 1.5 min.  I will make these again often!

Excellent!  I learned how to make these in GirlScouts 45 years ago and had lost the recipe.  These are almost like the one we used to make back then.  After experiminting I changed the sugar to 2 cups, 3 tbs cocoa and added 3-4 tbs more of peanut butter.  The trick to getting them to set up is to boil to the 'soft ball stage' .  Without using a Candy thermometer you can test this by dropping a small amount in cold water to see if it forms a soft ball.  Once you mix in the peanut butter and oats and Vanilla you have to work fast to get them 'dropped' onto the wax paper before they set up.  As a young girl I remember once we didn't do that and had to eat them out of the pan.  YUMMY!!

Have used this recipe several times.  Used again last night with my 10 yr old.  Now last night I realized I was out of vanilla, so we left it out... Didn't seem to make a difference.  They turned out amazing.  :)  Thank you

These taste like the real thing, but they are too soft.  Very uncookie like.  Don't know if I just need to let them harden in the fridge or what.

Honestly, this really is the BEST no bake cookie recipe. On it's on it is fantastic. Generally though I use it as my "base" and add more peanut butter and then throw in either rice krispies or corn flakes in addition to the oatmeal (I deduct about 1/2 cup of oatmeal if I do add the other cereal).  You can also add coconut to it.  YUMMY!

These were a hit!! The boiling time really is crucial, I under-boiled my second batch so they didn't ever quite set 100%, but when I brought them to a party, the first batch disappeared and even the picky French guests were scraping the second batch off the plates! I used extra-crunchy peanut butter and Nesquik powder since I couldn't find cocoa. Will definitely make again! Super quick, easy and DELICIOUS!

Very tasty!  I also added a little extra peanut butter, coconut, and even substituted some of the oats with Rice Krispies to add a nice crunch.  Following the 1 1/2 minute rule seemed to work.    This is a very handy recipe for last minute guests.  It doesn't take long to prepare them and slip them into the fridge before company comes.

Great recipe. I have the entire track team hunting me down for these since my kids requested them to take as snacks. Everyone loves them. I used some old fashioned oats as well as quick oats, otherwise followed exact recipe. Thanks for tip about boiling time, must time 1 min. when full. rolling boil starts. Similar to no bake V-they may be just a touch better than this recipe.

These were okay; not very sweet at all; kind of bland.  I would rec upping the sugar and reducing the oats...maybe even add another tsp of vanilla for more flavor.  Sorry, I will stick to my usual no bake cookie recipe.

These were so FAST and EASY!  But even better, they were absolutely delicious.  I found other similar recipes didn't taste right or were too loose to hold together.  I love this recipe and so do my sons and husband.  Great cookie for any occasion!

Have used several no bake cookie recipes (inc. No Bake Cookies V), and this is the only one that never set up. When trying to pick up the oatmeal plop, looked like a chocolate melted mess underneath, and this was hours later.

Good simple recipe.  I put the cookies in a muffin tin to cool, they get a nice round shape when they set and it makes it easier to get them to a uniform size (mostly).

I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and liked the results. I used creamy peanut butter and added 1/4 cup. This made them taste just like I remember from when I was a kid.:)
One thing I really think is important is about a half cup more oats. The way the recipe is now there isn't enough. 
I can't wait to try them with coconut! :)
Also I think marshmallows would be so good in this, maybe even to just put a few minis on top after already putting the dough on wax paper. Yummmmm.... :)

My first time making no bake cookies.  LOVED EM!  just like the last recommendation, I waited until i had nearly a rolling boil, then 1 1/2 minutes.  PERFECT AND EASY.  thanks for the advice.  I followed recipe exactly.

This has been a standard recipe around our house for years.  These days we tweak it a bit.  We use one tblsp of black cocoa with three tblsp of dutched cocoa to give it a darker, richer look.  We also split the chunky peanut butter half and half with nutella, and to make up for the lost chunkyness of the peanut butter, we toss in a handful of roasted cocao nibs.  We also usually toss in a handful of chocolate chips into the final mix.  They melt as you stir and give the cookies a bit more of a glossy texture

AHHHHHH!  THE ULTIMATE CRAVING FOOD!
I just made these just as I did when I was a teenager.  It was a sudden craving and in the middle of it I found out that I only had 2 cups of oats.  Determined now I found some Rice Crispies and added 1 1/2 cups of that along with a little shredded coconut.  They taste great!  The hardest part with these cookies is waiting to let them set up before eating them.  One soft one is already missing!...

So glad you had this old recipe! Thanks!

I have to deal with many food allergies and I found a way to make these cookies.  I substituted the milk for vanilla rice milk, the butter for coconut oil, and the peanut butter for cashew butter.  I also used 3 Tbs. of regular cocoa and 1 Tbs. of dark chocolate coco.  These cookies tasted so good!  If you or a  family member has a dairy, peanut, egg, wheat, soy, or corn allergy it is a great way to have some chocolate cookies without those ingredients.  Still read the ingredients especially the cashew butter incase it was made in a factory that also makes peanut butter.  Do not use any other oil in place of coconut oil!  Coconut oil is in a solid form unless it is warmer than 72 degrees.

I really loved this recipe.  Its very similiar to recipe my Mother always used.  I also added 3/4 cup of Coconut and 1/4 cup more of peanut butter.  Wow what a difference that makes.  The coconut really adds flavor (thanks for the idea).  Great Recipe!!! My husband even ate them and he hates chocolate haha.

Perfect! I followed the recipe to the tee let come to a rolling boil for 1 1/2 minutes, and got a chocolaty, chewy dream, the crunchy PB was a great touch to these cookies. Will definatly "no-bake" again...

I've made these several times and they are so delicious. I've never had a problem with the recipe. Just have the oats, peanut butter & vanilla ready to go so you don't have to take the time to measure. Then, make the cookies right away.

GREAT RECIPE! These are scrumptious!  I used creamy peanut butter, and timed it from the rapid boil, but unfortunately the cookies did not set well, and remained a bit gooey.  They were so delicious though, that they got eaten right up, none the less.  Maybe next time I will boil them another minute or two.

These are old time favorites - just don't make the mistake I made. I think I added way too much cocoa because I thought 4 tbsp just didn't seem like enough - the cookies came out extremely "crumbly" and you couldn't bite into one without it falling apart. But it still tasted great! If you follow directions as is, and use creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy, they will be perfect.

These were good.  I made them with margarine instead of butter and I also added 1 more cup of oats.  The oats were the old fashioned kind.  I would make one reccomendation.  With the crunchy peanutbutter they lost some of their peanut butter flavor.  I will use creamy peanutbutter next time.  There were really good and the boys ate them right up by the end of the day.  Thanks for the recipe.

I remember when we use to have these for dessert sometime back when I was in school. I use to loved them. I've always wanted this recipe. Now that I have it I get to make them when ever I desire them. They turned out great. Just like the good ole school daze.

This Recipe is one of our family favorites and has been for years. Due to the fact that we make it mostly at Christmas we call them ....Reindeer Droppings :-) the name fits due to its appearance. I found out recently that it is my daughters favorite cookie!

I lost my grandma's recipe for no-bakes a long time ago, but then I found these and they were just as good as hers.  So now, when people ask for my recipe for no-bakes, I hand them this one because it's tried-and-true.  The only difference is that I use creamy peanut butter, because that's how grandma always did it.  As for texture problems, like the reviewer before me said, it's all about time!  But not only that, you have to time it as soon as it goes into a rolling boil, not just little bubbles.  If you count it that way, yes, 1 1/2 minutes it perfect.  It has been for me, for many, many dozens of batches of cookies made.

These were a hit at my mother's club bake off. 
However, I found them much too sweet.I will add some coconut,a little extra oats and minus 1/4 cup of the sugar the next time I make these for the holidays. 
For a quick set, I placed them in the freezer to harden, worked great!

These turned out well but we thought the taste was only okay. We found the peanut butter taste overpowering. My husband and I prefer our "No Bakes" recipes that is similar but contains coconut instead of peanut butter.

This recipe recieved 13 thumbs up from my panel of critics!  My daycare/childrens' ministry were begging for something sweet to munch on. I'm so tired from all the Christmas baking, dealing with a head cold...Just didn't feel like doing anything too involved! These were extremely EASY, didn't take much effort. Now the kiddies are happy, and they just think I'm GREAT! Really good recipe!! Thanks!

these were really good! i've never made them before but i thought they would be good since you dont have to turn on the oven when its really hot in the summer.  i made them with soy butter instead of peanut brother because my little brother has allergies, and they turned out perfect and tasty.  great recipe!

This recipe makes the cookies just like I remember.  However I only added about 2 cups of the oatmeal and upped the peanut butter to about 3/4 cup.  I also boiled the mixture for 2 1/2 minutes.

These had a great flavor - had to let them cool completely so they weren't so soft.  They were kind of shiny. My husband didn't like the texture, and I wasn't crazy about it, but co-workers ate them right up!

Another variation is using a cookie sheet to cool them then cut them in squares.  Also adding cinnamon and or cocconut flakes.  Also try adding some mini-marshmellows right before spreading on a cookie sheet.

The cookies turned out great!  I could never figure out how long to boil the cookies I have made in the past, and they never turned out.  These were perfect.  One thing I like to add to no bake cookies is a bit of shredded coconut.  Great recipe!

I really like this recipe. The cookies are great, and everyone who tries them loves them. The only catch is you have to make sure you cook your first ingredients reallt slow to a boil, and then start timing for 1 1/2 min.. They turn out great!

I used regular not chunky BP and they turnedout perfectly. The main key to no bake know cookies is to let you sugar reach the correct temperature! 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 minutes is the perfect time and also make sure butter is REAL butter and at room temperature! 
I had to come up with something very quick before the hubby left the next 3 day for work.  So these weekends my go to.

These are great cookies.  The only change I made was I didn't have enough of the quick oatmeal and had to mix in the old fashioned kind. They came out super. We all loved them. I wish the sugar could be decreased. I feel very guilty eating something this sweet. But not guilty enough I guess!!!!

I've made this recipe several times and it's awesome! Tastes like the no bakes my Mom used to make when I was a kid (maybe a little better)! Works best if you let it boil for one minute from the time it comes to a rolling boil. Also, try it with Hersheys Special Dark Cocoa - really good!!

This recipe was good, and only needed a few changes, but the cookies turned out great! I added about 1/4 c more of peanut butter, and I think the secret to good no bakes is to boil the chocolate mixture for exactly one minute. I think the 1.5 minutes listed is a little too much, and that's why some people said they turned out crumbly. Otherwise, this recipe is good.

I like this recipe but I want to try it without the cocoa powder because that part gives me headaches. So does anyone think it would be a problem without the cocoa powder?   Otherwise they were really good. The husband really likes them. And what about using Splenda?  Would that work too??

This is a great recipe to make when you don't want to heat up the oven during the warmer months.  Made a double batch for a bake sale and they were all gone.  Ran out of oatmeal the second batch, so used the remainder to make 3 cups by adding some coconut.  Only thing I did differently was to add a dash of salt which helps to enhance flavor of the chocolate.  set up very nicely and quickly.  thanks for this very easy recipe.

I used creamy peanut butter because I didn't have crunchy & threw in a pinch of salt.  They're delicious!

I had this recipe when I was a kid and lost it in a move.  It turned out great they are cooling and setting up as I type.  From what I got to taste in the pan they are going to be awesome.

I love this recipe. I made it with my mom when I was a teenager and now I make it with my 7 year old son. We pre-measure the ingredients so all we have to do is pour them in. The best part is that we use peter-pan crunchy honey roast peanut butter, it makes them even MORE AMAZING!!!You guys have got to try it!!!

Had a craving for chocolate but none in the house, then realized I probably had all the ingredients for no-bakes, but hadn't made them since high school home ec class (15+ years ago!)  I didn't have enough peanut butter so I halved the recipe and it turned out great - just a little crumbly. I spread them in a pan instead of dropping them on wax paper and they sliced up perfect. :)

This is a good recipe, we enjoyed them and were able to successfully substitute original almond milk for the milk and Original Earth Balance (vegan) buttery spread plus a pinch of salt for the butter due to allergies. We had tried another version of this recipe which called for slightly less sugar and cocoa, but it just tasted "ok". This recipe is GOOD. If we're eating a cookie, we aren't too worried about the sugar content since it is an occasional treat. :)

This recipe is AMAZING!! I did about 1 1/4 sugar and added about 2 Tbsp. Nutella.
These are my go-to cookies when it is too hot outside to use the oven. Mmmm.....

Awesome recipe, it's super easy to make! The only thing off I see with it is that it doesn't make 3 dozen, every time I've made them I came out with 21 cookies good sized cookies.

I love how quick and easy these are. I make them into small 1" bite-sized pieces - they taste more like chocolate candy than cookies to me! I chill them on stacked paper plates in the fridge overnight. In the morning, I put them in plastic bags for the kids or hubby's lunch. They're best warm from the oven though, with a tall glass of milk!

This recipe is the best! I followed the directions exactly but added an extra half cup of oats and added the vanilla to the milk. I did'nt have a problem the with the boiling, added peanut butter after removing chocolate mixture from heat, let melt and addded oats. PERFECTO!!! I would recommend these cookies to the world! YUM!

I couldn't find the recipe I used when I was a kid in my recipe box, so I came on good old allrecipes and here it is! Exactly how I remember it. 

For fun, I subtracted a cup of oatmeal and added two cups of rice krispies. It gave it a fun texture that my oatmeal hating kids loved. 

It's a bit sweet for my adult liking - but my kids ate them up and getting my kids to eat anything oatmeal related is a small victory. So, home run.

Great recipe!  These are very chocolaty with a hint of peanut butter.  These disappeared with amazing speed!  I am in Denver at high altitude and will increase the boil time very slightly, maybe 2 minutes,   for a better set.

Yummy! Just like I remember them!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and boiled until the cocoa mixture got to the soft ball stage.  That took 2 minutes. They were soft enough to hold together and not be crumbly, but I think that next time I'll pull them off the heat just a little bit earlier because I like them more on the gooey side.  I'll definitely make these again!

I was short on groceries so I used a 5 oz can of evaporated milk and Ghiradelli Sweet Ground Chocolate in place of milk and cocoa.  Amazing!

LOVE these. I've been making them for years out of an old cookbook I've had forever, but I managed to lose it so I was ecstatic to find it replicated online. Thank you!

I was looking for a no bake recipe and found this.  I then called my sister to get Mom's recipe and found that the only differences between this recipe and my Mom's is it has 2 cups of sugar and she always used creamy peanut butter.  I'll be making my first batch tonight and I'm glad to have seen the other reviews to know that the boil time determines the outcome.

i love these cookies! i have made them before and everybody i knows cant wait till i make them. but one thing, they taste just the same without the vanilla extract and i think if you dont add it you can taste more of the peanut butter and chocolate. just a suggestion!

I just made these for Christmas. The recipe I have from my mother is a little different and they set perfect. I use the same ingredients aceppt: 3 TBSP of coco and 4 cups of cruchy oats and 1/2 cup of rasiens and because I don't care for a lot of sugar I only use 3/4 cup of sugar.

Easy to make recipe ... was my first time, and they turned out just right.  Two slight issues with them are:  they are slightly drier than I remember (might cut back on the 3C of oats next time, or boost other wet ingredients - which will probably ruin it - lol), and mine are quite salty (think I have to chalk that up to the store brand oats).  Will noodle around with it next time, but this is a great way to get my picky kids to eat oatmeal!

I have used this recipe probably 20x and always yield an awesome batch of really moist (never ever dry) cookies.  I am not sure if it's my paranoia, but sometimes I think I am scared of scorching the chocolatey mixture during boiling and when I do that, they don't harden :(  But do NOT worry. It won't scorch. Don't remove from heat at all! I stir it though just to ease my paranoia a bit LOL. Sometimes I'll let it boil for about 10 seconds extra to be on the safe side. Key to these is timing :)

I agree with everyone that says the trick is to time it once it hits a rolling boil.  Make sure there aren't just a few bubbles around the edges, but rather the entire pot is bubbling.  Start timing (a minute and a half) once the entire pot is bubbling and don't turn down heat, let the mixture boil for the full 1 1/2 minute.  Make sure you take the mixture off the heat before adding everything else in! I also had my oats, peanut butter, and vanilla all ready to go. I stirred in the peanut butter first until there weren't any lumps, then the vanilla, and finally the oats.  I used a rubber spatula to stir with to ensure any oats stuck to the edge of the pot were incorporated.  I used a cookie dough scoop and got about 30 cookies.

I have been making these cookies for a long time. When I came to this recipe I love the way they came out. A lot better them most of the others I have done for so long. I did however add just a little more peanut butter to them and a little more chocolate.  Great cookies for kids to help with also. i love making these with my 2 older boys~!

I followed this recipe to a 't' and even boiled a little less time than the recipe called for, and these cookies were still dry and crumbly with very little chocolate taste. I will stick with my usual recipe calling for melted baking chocolate in the future.

***8/20/10 I just made the recipe using only oats & no rice crispies as I did below.  I still used Country Crock marg instead of butter.  You really need to increase the quick cooking oats to 3 & 1/2 cups to get a good consistency cookie. ***

Yummy & perfect setting!!!  I used Country Crock marg instead of butter, a thick brand of peanut butter, 2 cups quick oats, & 2 cups rice crispy cereal ~chewy & crispy!!! Made about 22 three inch cookies.  It only took about 50 min.s to set!  This recipe doesn't turn out dry or gritty or sticky ~perfect!!! Thx for the excellent cookie recipe, Denise! =) P.S. I used the amounts listed for the sugar, butter, peanut butter, & cocoa, etc (except for the oats & crispies as said above) & they turned out PERFECT!!!

They were delicious and my whole family loved them! It didn't take long to make them and by the time we finished dinner they were ready to eat! My parents were over for dinner and they were a hit with my dad who can't usually eat cookies because he is allergic to wheat.

It tastes good but it did not set. I let it boil for 2 minutes and they are very soft. I would suggest letting it boil 3-5 minutes.

We love these! Even my picky 2yo adores them. We're a peanut free home so I use sunflower butter in place of the pb and almond milk and they're delicious! They hold up very well.   I've also made this recipe exactly as it's written and was quite pleased.

These cookies were GREAT! Not too time consuming.. and have nutritional value. :) I didn't have cocoa powder, so I replaced it with 2/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and they turned out great. (Just melted them in with the butter, sugar and milk.) I also used smooth peanut butter. Thanks for the recipe! (: Much appreciated.

The taste is amazing but no matter what I do they never get hard. I know the boil for 1 minute is insanely off and I have tried to boil as long as 5 minutes but still NEVER hard.

I have found in making no-bakes, that the humidity level can affect the cookies.  Sometimes I have to adjust the amount of oatmeal slightly to get the right consistency.  I use a mixture of quick oats and regular for chewier, healthier cookies.  If I don't have quite enough oats, I throw in rice krispy or other similar cereal.  I rarely time the boil and I rarely have a problem with set.

I found these to be pretty tasty, but not perfect like other recipes i have used for No-Bakes. There was a little too much peanut butter for my taste, and I could not get the cook-time right. I began timing the boiling at a rolling-boil, boiled it for more than 2 minutes, and the resulting "cookies" were still shiny and would not set. This could be partially due to making them in very high humidity though. It took a combination of uncovered refrigeration (to dry them out) and about 2 days to set at room temperature and finally have holdable cookies of the right texture. Nonetheless, I gobbled them up like they had been perfect anyway! Chocolate + peanut butter = delicious no matter what. :)

I have absolutely loved this recipe, ever since I saved it some 10 years ago.  The only tweaks I have made is to use a little more peanut butter and I add a couple little boxes o raisins.  The most important thing is that you cook it on medium heat and for EXACTLY one and a half minutes.  If you do that, they will set well and not be dry and crumbly.  Cook too long - dry.  Cook not long enough - they won't set up.  I cool them then, when they are cooled I put them in an airtight container and keep them refrigerated.

Made this recipe exactly as stated and followed one reviewer's suggestion to let the chocolate/sugar mixture come to a full rolling boil, then start timing. Cookies turned out perfectly and I got rave reviews. Thank you!

My son came to me this morning 15 minutes before he had to leave for school and said he had a track meet in a town four hours away long story short he needed snacks.  This is the first recipie I found online so I went for it.  Worked out PERFECT!!!  Although, I only had creamy peanut butter and I put that in right as the sugar mixture came to a boil. then my son was still searching for quick oatmeal in the cabinet, so the sugar mixture boiled for about 2 minutes.    But hey, it worked!  He made it out the door on time and they are pretty darn good!

Very good! Just like I remember them as a child. However, I use 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 1 3/4. The first time I made them like the recipe, they were a little too sweet.

I have made these since I was very young and never measured anything as I was just taught to throw it together.  I was looking for some measurement info so I could work on an exact recipe to pass on to my daughter-in-law and found this.  I have also struggled with boiling times and sometimes ended up with dry crumbly texture.  I started using Reese's pieces peanut butter chips in place of peanut butter and it gives these cookies a creamier texture and helps to have them set up great.  Being a cook who doesn't measure,I usually use a whole bag of chips and cut back on my cooking time as the chips set as soon as they begin to cool. I will be anxious to try this recipe and use quantities specified here.  I know I will need to adjust chips too.  Thanks for this great website.

Chocolatey, peanut-buttery, delicous & quick--this is the perfect cookie to make when you're in a hurry and don't have time for baking. The recipe was perfect--my husband loves these (they're his second favorite cookie) and they met his standards with nary a complaint. This will be my go-to recipe each time I make them.

I've made these many many times.  But when I make them I make two batches in two separate pans.  One pan with the cocoa and one pan without the cocoa and twice the vanilla.  They ARE sweet and I can only eat one at a time but I do give them out to friends and relatives.

Followed the recipe precisely and was very happy with the results. They were just the right consistency! MAKE SURE you have all the ingredients and wax paper spread ready for when you take it off the heat. You definitely have to work quickly! I remembered these from when I was a kid and had a craving for some. Awesome stuff!!!

This recipe is delicious, even with your own personal twist on it.    My mom doesn't like peanut butter & my cousin is allergic to peanut butter, so I made it without it.  They both loved it!  And I didn't think it was half bad myself.  I've also made it with creamy peanut butter, that was just as good.  I've also recently made it with Hershey's Chocolate Milk mix instead of unsweetened cocoa powder, and THAT was delicious.  (I didn't have any unsweetened cocoa powder at the house.)  And lemme tell ya, for those of you with an over-zealous sweet-tooth (like me) you will LOVE it like that.  ;-)

These were really good!  My whole family loved them.  I also had my aunt and grandmother in town when I made them and they really enjoyed them too.  They had not had them in years and were even better than they remembered.  The texture of the cookie was excellent!

Just like mom used to make, though in my house they were always "Alaskan Cookies" for some reason. I didn't time it exactly or use a candy thermometer, and they still turned out just perfect.

This is a wonderful recipe. My family was first introduced to it in the 60's. The name we knew it by was Missouri Cookies. Also, we always made this one in an electric frying pan. The heat was more consistant. Have fun!

tasted great! halved the recipe and added a little bit more peanut butter than was called for. I timed about a minute and a half after it started a rolling boil to put them on a pyrex dish (i didn't have wax paper) and the consistency and taste was perfect!

These were good - my 6 year old cousin does  not care much for sweets but he loves these!  I do add a bit more peanut butter - and a tiny bit extra vanilla but that is my personal choice of flavor!  I dont know why people have a difficult time getting the cookies to set - it is not rocket science let them get to a rolling boil for about 1 and a half to 2 minutes . . . if you have made nobakes before you will know when it is ready!  I also let them set in the pan for about a minute before putting them on wax paper - it makes a thicker cookie!  If you want a quicker set let them cool about 15 minutes and pop them in the fridge for another 15 and they will be nice and firm.

Delish!  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and realized I didn't have enough cocoa powder, so I threw in some chocolate chips as well.  Followed the cooking instructions exactly and had no problems setting.  Will make these again!

Great recipe!  Perfect flavor!  Be sure to stay at the sauce pan when mixture coming to a boil and stir constantly.  Don't over cook or they will turn out gritty.  Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)

One tip that always helps me turn out a perfect no-bake: Throw in 3 or 4 large marshmallows just when the mixture starts to simmer. As soon as they are completely melted in, it is done. Turn off the heat and add the rest of your ingredients. Perfect every single time.

This is the same recipe we made as kids, its all about the boiling time!!!  You really have to watch it.  If you put a drop of hot boiling mixture into cool water and it sets up into a firm ball your good to pull it off the heat.

Great tasting cookies that take so little time and effort! I love these for summer time, when it is too hot to turn on the oven. My 16 year-old son wanted to know when I was planning on making more....they didn't last long with him around! Definitely have a glass of milk ready to serve with these. Thanks for sharing - great recipe!

These were alright. I did add coconut as recommended by another reviewer, and I'm glad I did because it added more flavor. The kids liked them, probably because they were very sweet. It would be better if the directions were a little more detailed as far as cooking the chocolate mixture. I may try these again...

So good!!  The sugar was just right.  I added some semi-sweet chocolate chips while I was boiling.  Plus I added the oats while the pot was still on the stove.  It cooked the oats a bit.  My husband loved them!!

This is an easy and good tasting cookie for the busy cook. I added the cocoa when the sugar/butter/milk mixture started to boil and boiled fully for 2 minutes, then added 1 tsp. vanilla. I used 3/4c of coconut for the extra ingredient.  The cookies were perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

A favorite in my house! I used old fashioned oats as that's what I had in the house...still worked great! I sometimes add a little coconut depending on who in the family is asking for the treat (if you like coconut it's a good addition and if you don't it's still ok). If adding coconut decrease the amount of oats used otherwise it's a little dry. Also make sure it's unsweetened coconut.

I love no bake cookies and the only change I made was adding a 1/4 cup more peanut butter!

I really liked these cookies. The next time I make these I will use creamy peanut butter instead. Very fast and easy to make. I will be making these often! Thanks for the recipe! Easier to make and cheaper than buying them already made.

So simple, yet so gooooooood!  I used creamy, all-natural peanut butter instead.  Such a yummy cookie... and so easy that you just can't mess up.  Even if you somehow do, I believe it'll still be tasty.  Haha!  Let it cool to settle, and store in an air-tight container.  Oh, and don't try making it without the vanilla extract... I tried that once b/c I ran out and....... yeah...... vanilla is essential.  Hahaha!

These were great! (I emphasize WERE!) I especially loved the tip from Denise to make sure and only boil for 1 1/2 min. in order to insure they turn out the way you want them. I have always struggled to make no bakes like my friends' moms, and now I finally can! Thank you so much!

I have been making these for years and the only thing I do differently is to also add 1/2 c. flaked coconut when I am adding the peanut butter, oats and vanilla. Like several reviewers before me have said, you have to boil the mixture for one minute after it comes to a full rolling boil.

Very tasty.  I only put in 1/4 cup peanut butter and added an extra tablespoon of cocoa.  We didn't even wait for them to set up to start eating them.  I will definitely make these again.

I don't know about these ones. Eating no-bake cookies is like eating unbaked cookies, but now the delicious naughtiness is gone, the queezy guilt all to remain. The oats are too chewy and these are ridiculously sweet - I don't know what to do with them! No one I know will want them, but if I keep them around I'll just eat 'em anyway (cuz I'm a glutton) and make myself sick. I wish I had never made these cookies.

Excellent, quick recipe.  A party favorite.  Make sure to scoop into teaspoons before the mixture cools too much.  If the chocolate cools too much before scooping the cookies will be overcrumbly.

What a great cookie….I’m a sodium sensitive person and it is hard to find a good cookie low in salt.  I used no salt butter and no salt peanut butter bringing the count of  the sodium down to zero. Thank you Denise!

Hmmm-- not completely fool proof I guess. I made these and ready all the advise of pervious posters but the cookie stayed soft and sugary, even after refigeration it didn't completely harden enough, it still crumbled to the touch.  On the bright side I guess we can use it for ice cream topiings.

Yummy!!! I halfed the recipe and made it in just about less than 15 minz! Doesnt cost much coz most of the ingredients are found in the kitchen. However, i thought it was a little too sweet and the sugar could be cut down... Quick enough 2 satisfy those sweet cravingz.

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I always loved these in grade school when our cafeteria served them at lunch although theirs were made in a bar form. I have looked and looked for this recipe for years and it wasn't until I saw these kinds of cookies for sale in my local grocery store deli that I realized they are called "no bake" cookies, or, as the store calls them, "no bake fudge." This recipe was very easy and my first batch came out perfectly! Thank you very much for the recipe, Denise! :)

PERFECT! Just like the one's I used to eat in grade school. My husband I ate half the batch before they even cooled.  Quick & easy for our evil sweet tooths. We also used reamy peanut butter instead of crunchy!!

This is the "authentic" no-bake cookie recipe, the one I keep LOSING!  You could use crunchy peanut butter for a variation too, or just add 1/2 cup of chopped unsalted peanuts after cooking.

These were good.. not quite what I was expecting because they do turn out more like a fudge type candy than a cookie but still worth the effort. They are easy but messy to make.

I LOVE this recipe!!  I used it for the first time around the middle of December when I needed to make cookies for a Christmas pot luck dinner.  The cookies were such a hit that I've made them several times since then.

I made these cookies for an Christmas Cookie Exchange early, one morning before work.  When I returned home that afternoon my son had eaten every last cookie!  He said, "...but Mom, they were so, so good..." I made more and they are really very good, reminds me of when I was a little girl and my Gramma would make them for us.

My all time favorite cookie and your recipe was better than mine. You used a little more cocoa and the exact boiling time assures a perfect cookie! Thanks!

I never had the pleasure of eating these as a kid.  I guess I'll have to make up for lost time!  My kids really like them too.  I think they are more like candy than a cookie though.  Also, mine took a while to firm up, but after they did, they held their shape wonderfully.

These have been my favorite since I was a small child, and have over the years grown into the most cherished childhood memory I have, not to mention they sure take care of my craving for chocolate now that I am pregnant with my own =)

Excellent cookie!  I don't like to double cookie recipes because they don't always turn out, but I was in a hurry.  This cookie turned out.  It is not greasy like some no bake cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly as the ingredients and instructions are written.

I personally prefer traditional cookies over no bake cookies but I have a peanut butter no bake cookie loving hubby and son so I gave this recipe a try. I made them exactly as the recipe calls and they turned out great.

They taste delicious! I would highly suggest having the oats, peanut butter, and vanilla at hand before it’s time to mix them in; once the mixture is off the heat, your time is limited! Mine took quite a while to fully cool and harden on the parchment paper, but all in all, I would highly recommend this recipe!

Yummy & easy recipe! The most important part of the recipe is to boil the mixture 1 1/2 minute once it comes to a rolling boil so the cookies will be moist.

I can't find my mom's recipe for these cookies so I made this recipe and screwed it up by over boiling them and they were beyond dry! Going to try them again and see if I can make them right and good.

When they say to boil it for 90 seconds. They are not joking. Ruined the first batch for the second one perfect. Start the timer after the rolling boil starts. It ok. We are the evidence.

Pretty dang good. I used dark cocoa powder and creamy peanut butter but the recipe was flawless. If I had to ding anything, it would be my technique for getting the mixture off the spoon onto the waxed paper. Regardless, they harden up nicely and even the oddest shapes taste great. Thanks for the awesomeness.

I couldn't find my recipe and between another who made it and this recipe, I made them. Just perfect! One thing I have always done is to split the vanilla and use half vanilla, half almond. Just a wonderful flavor in cookies. I used 2 cups sugar and only 3 tblsp. Of cocoa though. And a full cup creamy peanut butter. Thankyou for posting recipe!

I have used this recipe before and it works everytime. I use Special Dark cocoa and my cookies are extra rich, and really dark. 

If it's rainy/snowy or really super foggy, cook the mixture just a little bit longer, maybe 30 seconds longer than suggested in the recipe. 

My cookies are glossy and so pretty. Can't wait until they are cool enough to eat.

Always turns out great . Just remember, don't start counting the minutes until you are are a full boil and for everyone that says it turns crumbly. That's because you use more peanut butter than your suppose to.

I always double the recipe to make sure we end up with enough cookies to last more than one day. 

Tips: To cut down on the sugar, when doubling the recipe, I only used 3 cups of sugar. I also cook for 2 and a half to 3 minutes for our climate here in the South. I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. They turn out mouth-watering. 

You can also add more peanut butter if you prefer a more peanut butter flavor.

I made these today around 1pm est. After two hours of "cooling" they were still moist and sticking to the wax paper. I placed them in the fridge and still they are not cookies. I don't recommend this recipe.

Do not cook on anything higher than medium heat.  Time 1 minute once it reaches a rolling boil and these will turn out perfect and creamy!  Even better the next day after storing in an air tight container.

Classic! Exactly how I remember them. Using a mechanical scoop yields uniform cookies and gets them portioned before they start to set.

I've made these cookies about a dozen times in the last 3 months since my manager told me about them. The original recipe is very good but it's not quite great, hence the 4 stars. 

I accidently doubled the milk the second time I made them and they came out super fudgey and delicious! Then I ran out of peanut butter and subbed Nutella instead and it made it 10x better. My mom told me about her grandma's no bakes and said she added marshmallows so sometimes I add half a cup of mini marshmallows and it's even better. 

So what I do to make it 5 stars is:
Replace PB with same amount of Nutella
If desired, add handful of mini marshmallows.
Add a splash more milk, stir then scoop with 1 tablespoon cookie scooper. 
If the batter loses the shine or gets crumbly/ thick, I add about 1/8 of a cup. Last time I added milk twice in between scooping to keep it soft. 
Sometimes I omit PB or Nutella and scoop about a dozen for my mom to take to her nut-free school and they are still delicious! Then I add the Nutella and splash of milk to the remaining batter. 

As I said I rated based on the original recipe. It is a bit drier than we like and the peanut butter adds to that. Definitely is a good base though!

They were good, but little to dry. I’m thinking it’s the peanut butter. Next time I’m going to use little over half of what the recipe calls for, or maybe just half. We’ll see.

PLEASE READ! For these cookies to come out perfect every time, there are a few important tips. First, put the first ingredients (butter, sugar, cocoa and milk)  in your saucepan  before starting to heat them. They must heat together. Have the oatmeal, peanut butter and vanilla ready to go, along with your wax paper (I put folded grocery bags underneath the wax paper). The key to these cookies is bringing them to a boil  SLOWLY and to stir the entire time. On a gas stove, that should be at 3. Just like when you make fudge, these cookies need to cook slowly and you must stir constantly. When it reaches a boil, wait a few minutes until it is a FULL boil, before setting the timer for 1 minute. After it has boiled fully for one minute, quickly add the vanilla and peanut butter, and stir well before adding the oatmeal. Quickly drop on the wax paper. The times these cookies haven't set up well is when I brought it to a boil too fast. You can use organic peanut butter - I do - just make sure it is stirred well and soft. These are a classic. So good.

I personally think that there was a little too much peanut butter, other than that it's amazing. I substituted the regular milk for almond milk and it still tasted pretty good.

If you like peanut butter these are so so good. Next time I will make but half almond butter or hazelnut. Otherwise perfect cookies.

I have made these since I was a child,  this is how, and it works EVERY time. 

1 cup butter 
1 cup sugar
1 cup milk, t
1/2 cup cocoa
3 cups oats (quick cooking only!)
1 super big scoop of peanut butter
(I would say about a cup and a half, or so )
crunchy or creamy, whatever is your preference.  my family likes creamy)
now in a pot a big one if you make a whole batch, or  you can 1/2 it. 
melt in a pot together all ingredients except peanut butter at med heat until it starts to boil, at this point set a timer for three, (yes three) minutes. stirring only occasionally,  then take off  heat, and stir in peanut butter,  then the quick cooking oats ,  then you  cane dump it into a butter spread pan, your wrappers might be enough,  or on a foil sheet you can separate them into tablespoon and a half cookies.  now my fam likes to eat them warm and soft first, and then when they are cool they will harden into cookies or if you put in a. pan you can cut into bars,  they are fabulous  chocolaty peanut butter dreams,.

These can be done in the microwave.  Put in glass bowl.  Microwave 1 minute. Remove and stir.  Microwave for 2 minutes. Remove and add vanilla, oats and peanut butter. Stir and drop.  Do it this way all the time and comes out perfect every time.

Made it same way but substituted a bit of white sugar for brown and broiled it like tips said and turned out good bit chewy cause think boiled too long. Son loved them with sweetened coconut. Will be making again these are an old family favorite.

I think it needed more peanut butter for more peanut butter taste. But I rated it five Stars because I forgot the vannila extract, plus it still tasted really good.

Awesome recipe! I substituted vegan butter and vanilla almond milk and it is just as amazing! I also ran out of white sugar and used 1 cup white and half a cup brown and they are still just as sweet and delicious.

This recipe is very adaptable. I use two cups of oatmeal, and substitute coconut oil for butter.  I add a bit more cocoa powder. I also add some dried fruit.

This is the recipe you are looking for.  Don’t add more sugar, if anything leave a bit out. You can add a little more pb if you like. I used half quick oats and half rolled oats because that’s what I had and  it worked, just a little chewier .

They taste amazing but we’re very dry, all I did was add a little more milk and they were perfect, but there was definitely not 36 or whatever the serving amount was.

I really like that this recipe calls for less sugar than the traditional recipe.  I used 6 tablespoons of cocoa powder to make it a darker chocolate.  Love the extra crunch from the crunch peanut butter.  They set up well.

Very easy but would like to add I start timer from rolling boil and because of high elevation (my moms tip) I boil for 2 minutes. Don't know if elevation really makes the difference but seems to work for me.

Excellent recipe!  I had some issues with my first batch not wanting to set right, but all the flavors were there. So I changed the cooking time from 1 1/2 minutes to 4 minutes and they turned out perfect!!

This is by far one of my favorite recipes. I love how it's simple and also extremely delicious. Although I love it, I did make a few changes. 
      First of all, I took a baker's suggestion and added 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I also added 1 cup of marshmallows. After all of the ingredients were mixed and cooled off, I then added the marshmallows.
       Occasionally, I will put the cookies onto a large baking sheet, use a pizza cutter to cut into small squares, and then freeze them. My  parents and siblings love these cookies. They all think it is much easier to grab them when they are in little squares. Love this recipe!

This recipe does not work! It calls for too much butter and has less sugar than others. It took me twice to figure out something wasn't right about it. My cookies never hardened.

I used creamy peanut butter instead and it still worked. The recipe is easy and makes it a lot less messier than some of the other ones I've used. Will definitely come back to this one again!

I liked this recipe and the taste of the cookie! I used creamy peanut butter instead and they turned out great. The only thing is they are a bit soft even after cooling in the fridge. You might try not stirring a lot during the boiling part in the recipe so that it thickens or just cooking it longer as it boils and stirring frequently. It's a matter of personal preference. Altogether a great recipe. My batch yielded about 30 cookies and they were all gone by the end of the day in a family of 6. ??

I love no bake cookies, and this is a great recipe. I dont follow anything exactly, by this is the perfect base .  I added a couple tablespoon of coffee to accentuate the chocolate flavor, and extra coco powder to cut the sweetness and I always add extra peanut butter and vanilla. But no bake cookies are a sweet cookie, so dont expect them to be anything different.

I'm an eyeballer with cooking but I'd wager I used a little less sugar and a little more peanut butter. A great way to add back in the sweetness is to throw in some raisins and a little more cocoa. Gives you a dark chocolate flavor with just the right offset of sweet without the sugar.

Classic recipe, however, make sure you keep the heat on LOW or Medium-LOW the entire time, while stirring. The recipe doesn't mention this, and it should solve consistency issues. My guess is that many people are bringing it to a boil way too quickly.

Loved! I used ALMOND MILK instead of milk and Organic Blue Agave low glycemic sweetener instead of white sugar. Also, substituted the butter for a healthier option with  EARTH BALANCE ORGANIC WHIPPED SPREAD! And used JUST GREAT STUFF ORGANIC POWDERED PEANUT BUTTER too! And gluten free oats!! It was AMAZING! Gluten free, dairy free and I didn't miss any of the substituted ingredients!! YUMMY!! ??????

These set up nicely however, need less sugar (1/2 the amount) and less cocoa (1/2 the amount) to really have the best flavor.

First timer here! Made it just like the recipe only I used all natural creamy peanut butter. I ended up putting one batch in the fridge and one on the counter to harden. The ones in the fridge took way less time and they are perfect! The ones on the counter took a bit longer but came out great too.

I followed the recipe to the T and even used my iPhone stopwatch to boil for just the precise 1.5 minutes before adding the other ingredients and they turned out perfect!  Yummy!

Nice classic recipe. I used unbleached sugar.  I did use slightly less sugar than listed. I added coconut to half of the batch. They were good both ways.

I've never been a huge fan of these cookies but everyone else seems to love them! Too sweet for me. Anyway I also added some coconut to these for a little extra texture and flavor. They turned out great. Thanks for a good recipe!

This recipe was fun to make and delicious to eat!  This is a perfect "starter" recipe, that you can add to or change as your tastes desire.  I added 3/4 cup coconut at the very end, of this batch.  Like others have suggested, a continuous rolling boil for 1-2 minutes is essential, for the sugars to set up and make a really good cookie.  (You can reduce the heat and still maintain a rolling boil.)  Sometimes I have used creamy peanut butter and added pecans, or I have added raisins, or dried cherries, or dried cranberries, butterscotch chips, toffee chips, the combinations are endless!  Enjoy!!!

YUM! I used the Special Dark cocoa instead, and added about a tsp of salt, & just creamy peanut butter. I eyeballed the peanut butter and put in a tad more! Will make for Christmas!

These are delicious but you need to ensure that you cook the mixture to soft ball stage prior to adding the oats, peanut butter and vanilla. If you don't have soft ball stage then they will not set .

It's good, not healthy though! A little too much sugar for my taste so next time (and there will be a next time) I'm substituting with honey (makes it a healthier alternative too). Also make sure to boil the mixture for a while...I didn't and my cookies keep falling apart. Added coconut flakes- yummy!

After making 3 batches from 3 different recipies yours finally nailed it for being closest to Moms!  That's what I was going for.
Thank you so much! My Waste Not  Hubby wants to use the other runny cookies for an ice cream topping.  Go for it.

I made this recipe a bit more adult by adding 1 tsp very finely chopped jalapeño at the end of boiling and 1/4 cup chopped bacon with the oats. Not as addicting as the original but far more interesting.

This is my go-to recipe. I found out that using Almond Milk gives it a creamier texture and even more taste. I used the same amount of Almond Milk as regular milk.

I initially didn't like this recipe.  It came out soupy, it took forever to set and didn't exactly wow me.  But, as it turns out, I didn't cook it on High heat, which made all the difference.  Also, I waited to start the 1m30s timer until it was boiling SUPER HARD, for about 10 seconds.  So, cook on high heat, cook a little longer...and BAM.  These set quickly, and taste the way they should!  Very good recipe, now one of my top favorites!  :-)

These cookies are easy and delicious. The only change I made was to up the oatmeal by 1/2 cup I allowed the mixture to come to a rolling boil then immediately removed from the heat. They did take longer to set up hen it said but once they did they were perfect. Not dry and crumbly at all.

This is good and easy. Only took me 30 min. from beginning to end. I used creamy pb instead because that's all I had but I would rather have used crunchy.

Wonderful!  I had to make a few changes to make do with what I had on hand (not making a midnight trip to the store in this weather!).  

I used 1/2c less sugar, 1T less cocoa, and double the peanut butter, creamy (approx, I eyeballed it).  I ran out of oats at 2c.

Since I ran out of oats I expected the cookies to be runny and poured the mixture into a parchment lined cake pan and tossed it in the fridge.  20 minutes later it was set enough to cut into mostly firm blocks.  I'm guessing they'll be perfect in the morning but I really wanted to sneak one before the baby woke up again!  :)

Will make again when I have all the ingredients!

Great recipe. I'll have to modify the fat next time, though, as I used natural peanut butter (no trans fats/hydrogenated oil) and the results were gooier cookies. I'll try less butter next time to compensate.
1-9-18: I followed some of the recommendations by using 1 cup p-nut butter (half crunchy and half plain), cooked exactly 1.5 minutes after coming to a full boil, 2 cups sugar ...I think that's all the modifications I did. They came out PERFECT.

Pretty good no bake cookies. I used 1 cup creamy PB and after dropping them on the wax paper I kind of pushed them together. This recipe made about 40 tsp size cookies and they are good.

I was low on sugar when I found this recipe, so I just used the 1/4 cup I had on hand. Cookies turned out delicious ! This is how I make them now every time.

Followed the recipe exactly and will definitely be making again! The only things I did differently was using creamy peanut butter and old fashioned rolled oats (because that's what I had on hand). They still turned out tasting exceptional and set up perfectly.  My 4 year old and I are BIG FANS!

Added a full cup (1 cup) peanut butter and an additional cup of oats, for a total of 4 cups oats. And it is very important to follow 1.5 minutes rolling boil ??????

I have tried this recipe countless times with non-dairy substitutes (buttery spread and non-dairy milk), but each time the cookies failed to set. I assumed it was because of a difference in melting temps/fat content and just froze the cookies to harden them up instead. I was finally able to get the cookies to set with Earth Balance buttery spread and rice milk, and with a boiling time of about 2.5 minutes (from a rolling boil). Still, tasty either way!

After reading several other reviews, I tried this recipe and it turned out "PERFECT" I did add about 1/4 cup more peanut butter and boiled the mixture 1 minute 40 seconds.. had everything ready put the vanilla and peanut butter first, stirring until dissolved then added the oats..

I've always had a difficult time getting this type of cookie to set up properly. It was always too soft or too dry and crumbly. I increased the sugar to two cups - primarily because most recipes call for the full two cups- and used dark chocolate coco powder. Then, I took another review's advice, stuck my candy thermometer into the pan as it boiled and waited until it hit the "soft ball stage". The cookies have set up nicely and are quickly disappearing.

This is my old standby recipe for no bakes, except mine calls for 2 c. sugar. I always wait for the ingredients to come to a full boil, then cook them for exactly one minute. Mine always set up perfectly. These are best with crunchy peanut butter!

Really nice flavor and so easy! Except mine did not set up very well. Kind of wet and mushy. I used almond milk and margarine instead of butter.... Does anyone think that made a difference?

The first batch didn't set. I boiled the correct amount of time and even set them in the freezer after an hour and a half, and they still did not set. For the second batch, I boiled the same amount of time, but used only a 1/4 c. butter and 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. The cookies set perfectly. This is my husband's favorite cookie. It thrills him to have these to take to work, so I'll be making these quite often.

This is a great base recipe. Only thing I did different was creamy peanut butter AND I added 1 and 1/2 cups of roasted peanut halfs. I also sprinkled them with a little salt after putting them on wax paper before they set-up. Salty sweet and nutty! Loved them.

I have tried this a few times, and after doing it exactly as stated the first time, I cut the Peanut Butter in half thereafter--too much PB flavor for me as written! (I was reading reviews and some people add EXTRA--so go figure!) It is a good cookie if you just want something fast and have the ingredients hanging around. Be sure to follow the timing directions! They remind the roommate of childhood no-bakes, so this is an old style one that has been around for a long time :) Enjoy!

Great recipe. I added 2/3 c. sweetened shredded coconut and 1/4 c. chopped honey roasted peanuts to the recipe and omitted the vanilla. Love the finished product.

I have been making this recipe for YEARS AND YEARS. And it is correct in that the boiling time is the critical time.  I just bring to full boil and then start my timer.  This recipe is one I always make during the holidays.  The kids always want some and its a great "take to work" idea.

This is the recipe for no bakes but I feel the directions leave a lot to be desired. These "boiled" cookies are one of those things that need to be exact or else you'll find either crumbling or gooey (not the good one) cookies. I find boiling until soft ball stage to be the best way to judge if the cookies are finished enough - this has provided consistent great and tasty results. It's so nice to be able to make them without kitchen disaster stories (anymore)! :)

I made this recipe and didn't need 3 dozen cookies so I halved it. They turned out perfect!  Reminiscent of my mom's no bake cookies from childhood.

Use Denise's tip and time boil from when it is rapidly boiling. They will be the perfect texture then.

Made this with half chocolate peanut butter protein powder/unsweetened cocoa and almond milk. Didn't change anything else and used a candy thermometer (just in case!) cooked it to about 230F or so and they turned out great!

So easy and fast to make!  Uses ingredients I always have on hand, so we can make them whenever we need a snack.  I pour a little in a bowl to eat hot right away and it is heavenly!

I tried this recipe and had the same problem with crumbling  cookies. I decided to add more butter and used an ice cream scoop to shape them by pushing the dough hard into the scoop. They stayed together nicely after they cooled.

So this was my first time trying. No bake cookie. I read the instructions carefully and made sure to bring to full boil for just under 2 min. I'm not sure if mine set properly, but they were similar to fudge texture. These cookies reminded me of a candy. They are very sweet! The peanut butter chocolate comes through strong and the oats just give it some texture. Not a bad flavor, just too sweet for me.

This is a fantastic recipe! The most important part to remember is to do the rolling boil for a minute and a half or the cookies will not setup properly. I can't keep my cookie jar filled with these to get eaten so fast!

The problem some of you are having is with the butter and the boil/cook time.  If you made this recipe and the cookies were rubbery, like syrup, the cause could be because of the butter you used and/or your cook time.  Usually it's not going to matter an extreme lot if you use stick butter or stick margerine but it does make a difference, especially in taste.  In regards to boil/cook time...I've made this recipe all my life and that is a very long time.  If they do not set up and your butter is fine, then you are simply not allowing it to cook long enough.  I make mine like I make old fashion fudge.  I boil it for almost 5 minutes, turn the stove off and then if the mixture looks real glossy, I beat if by hand with a spoon for about one minute before adding the peanut butter and oats.  In regards to those that have a crumbly mess, you are cooking it too long and perhaps using too much cocoa.  Try making this recipe without cocoa....add a heaping tablespoon more of peanut butter.  Personally, I like them better without cocoa.  You can also use crunchy or smooth peanut butter.  Also, it can depend on the peanut butter you use.  If you are using some weird off brand or using a light peanut butter, that could be an issue too.

Good flavor and texture, but after 3 hours the cookies had still not set. Put cookies in the freezer and by the next morning the thawed cookies seemed firm enough too hold without breaking, but maybe that is just because they had dried out.

These are called Missouri Cookies.  These were served in the cafeterias when I was in grade school and I always loved them.  I am 77 years old now. So you can see how long these cookies have been around.  They are wonderful.

The recipe was good. They weren't the best no bake cookies I've ever made though. I reduced the servings because it's just my husband and I and the cookies tasted like there were a little too many oats or maybe just that they weren't soft enough. When I make them again I intend on trying something different and if that works better, I'll update my review :)

I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy just because of preference.  They turned out perfectly!  Have made them a few times already!  Great for Christmas parties!

Good but after making it a few times with peanut butter I was finding they were turning out too greasy and soft. This time I made them without peanut butter and added 2 cups of sugar instead of 1 and 3/4 cups as I seen other recipes with that amount. I also added a cup of sweetened coconut! Turned out perfect this time!

Just made these and followed everything exactly, 90 sec once rolling boil.  Very easy. The first half worked fine while scooping out but at the end of the batch didn't stick together as well and where falling apart.  (I only made 24 not the 36 in the recipe.)  While taste good and had all the ingredients on hand not so pretty to look at and crumble easily when eatting-  

These are very sweet and the crunchy peanut butter is a must.

I changed this up a little. I used a heaping 1/2 c. of peanut butter, added a 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1 c. of oatmeal. My daughter can't get enough of them. :)

Just like most any good no bake cookie recipe! The only thing I do is I don't use vanilla because I feel like it's unnecessary. Anyway, the cookies turned out super!

Really easy to make. I used creamy peanut butter rather than crunchy and it was still good. I also added about a half cup more oatmeal and was perfect.

I altered this to make it what I consider "perfect".  I used Kath's revisions of 1/2 stick of butter (vs a full), 3 TBS of cocoa (vs 4), and 2 cups sugar (vs 1 3/4).  However I found the PB somewhere in between was the best.  1/2 cup of natural creamy made the cookies too runny/ thin but the full cup made them too peanut butter flavored for my preference. 2/3 cup of creamy PB was the perfect amt.  They set well and were a wonderful texture.

These are my family's favorite cookies.  We make them all the time, sometimes I add coconut but I always use the regular oats, not quick cooking.  I like the texture better when we freeze them.

Great receipe. From a rolling boil 90 seconds and the cookies set perfectly. Did make 1/4 cup more peanut butter for more flavor.

Was sooo good and the kids loved them, I made a single batch that lasted 3 days, then a double batch.  They call them "Harry Monster" cookies and keep asking for more.

Yummy! My 4 yr. old granddaughter said.  This was her first taste of this cookie.  She doesn't eat much of this kind of stuff.   I used carnation can milk and a little water because I was out of milk.  Also used creamy peanut butter.  They turned out perfect, just as I remember.  Nice and chewy.

As an American living in England, it can be difficult or impossible to find American ingredients. Porridge oats were as close as I could find, and I'm happy to say they worked perfectly! I also used 2/3 cup of PB and a bit less oats. Thanks!!

These were simply amazing. Very easy to make by following the instructions. I made a double batch and formed the sides with a spatula after spooning all the cookies out to give them a more uniform appearance. These definitely didn't last long!

These turned out just how I remember my mom's tasting, DELECTABLE! I over-boiled the chocolate mixture the first time, so they turned out a little crumblier that I'd hoped. But after getting the timing right, they set up beautifully! You can't go wrong with this quick & easy recipe for yummy cookies!

I have been eating these all my life. My mother used to call them "cow patties". They are delicious, we make ours without chunky peanut butter, but all the same. Good choice!

These were delicious!  Just like the lunch ladies used to make back in the day.  I spread them in a pan and cut into squares.  I think getting the mixture to a rolling boil was important for the right consistency.  They turned out perfectly!  Thank you!

Great, tasty cookies! They are of perfect texture. They firm up within minutes of placing them on (in my case) the cookie sheet. Ready to eat very soon after cooking, so they are great for those sudden, necessary, chocolate binges!

Very tasty! Definitely watch your timing while you boil the sugar, milk, butter and coco! It really does make all the difference in how it sets up.

These are delicious!  However I'm not sure if others have had to make High Altitude adjustments, but I needed to almost double the amount of milk in order to get it to a consistency where it would drop by spoonfuls.

These are OK.  The peanut butter overpowered the chocolate flavor, which I didn't like.

Very pleased with this recipe. Easy to follow for the first-timer and the cookies turned out great. I followed the directions and had no problems, other than forgetting to have wax paper on hand. My wife finishes the recipe as I ran to the stores and got their last couple of boxes. I've seen others use foil and it was messy. These turned out well despite my delay. I was very casual about how much I put on the sheet and how. No bakes seem very forgiving when it comes to size and shape.

These set just fine.  I didn't seem to have the same issues as others posted.  They just taste cheap-- sugary, not chocolatey.  Needs something more than just oats and peanut butter.

This recipe is perfect. Very easy to follow and produces a No Bake Cookie just like I rememebr my mom made.  I had no issue with setting time or consistency as others mentioned.  My daughter loved them!! These cookies helped her get through a sick day while her brother was at a birthday party.

I began making these cookies when i realized... i did not have cocoa powder!! well, it was too late to stop so i took out some sugar and added hot cocoa mix and semi sweet chocolate chips instead. they are still in the fridge, but the batter tastes pretty much the same as when i used to make no bake cookies...... maybe this will help

I love these no bake chocolate peanut butter cookies.  This recipe was great although I did use a bit less white sugar @ 1 1/2 cups.  Instead of make individual cookies I put it in a pan and slice them into bars.  Yummy!

I've lost track of how many times I've made these;  my family, neighbors, and friends all adore these cookies, and I gotta admit that I love the huge grins they get when they see I've brought a batch.  Supremely easy recipe, supremely delicious results, supremely disastrous for my waistline but I just can't be bothered to care.  Sooooo yummmmmy!

My 15 yo daughter made these and didn't change a thing.  They came out great!  She stored them in between sheets of parchment paper which helped them keep from sticking together (we are in FL).  Thanks for posting!

This has to be the greatest recipe ever made. I remember on those long winter nights, I would come into my home and experience that warm, delicious smell of my grandma or mother baking cookies. The only change I made to the recipe was putting in two teaspoons of vanilla extract. 100/100 ;)

Great no bake cooki recipe!! I have tried to make no bakes several times and they never seem to set right for me.  This recipe worked perfectly!! Timimg the boil for one minute at the start of the rolling boil was the trick! I think next time I am going to add a tad more cocao, as I would have liked a more chocolatey taste... If you have had a hard time making these cookies in the past this recipe could be for you!!!

I love these. I think they taste wonderful and are very easy to make. They aren't too dry like many no bakes.

I'm in Japan right now and ovens are hard to come by in most houses so this recipe is perfect! The only thing I did differently was use peanut whip instead of peanut butter since real peanut butter is so expensive here, but they still turned out delicious!

I added about 3x more cocoa powder to this recipe. I also used sweetened condensed milk instead.  My trick has always been to use a candy thermometer and boil the sugar mixture until the temperature reaches the hardball stage.  After added teh dry ingredients, my mixture was much to dry so I melted another stick of butter into it and they set up PERFECTLY!!

These didn't set very well. I've read the other reviews and they all mention you have to be careful how long you boil it, not too long, not enough; this is probably something that you'd have to make a few times before you got the timing right. And I don't have the time.

I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out great!  I rated this a 4 star because to me the texture seemed to need a little crunch.  Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic, easy recipe that I will definitely make again.  I absolutely recommend it for a chocolate fix!

I didn't have but 1 & 1/2 cup of oatmeal but decided to try it anyway and just substitute some leftover Capt Crunch, peanut butter ceral. wow. It was even better with the cereal. That is all I changed. I lvoe the original but this recipe is so versatile.   I timed it exactly by putting a cup of water in the micro on 1 & 1/2 minutues and when it went off, my cookies were done.

i altered this recipe just a little bit and they turned out wonderful! I changed the sugar to 2 cups, the penut butter to 3/4 cups, and added the vanilla to the liquid mixture before boiling. Im a health nut and am always looking to make every recipe a little more healthy. When I added the penut butter and oatmeal, I also added 2 scoops of my chocolate whey protein powder. It added only 200 more calories overall, and 50 grams of protein. My marine boyfriend absolutley loves them. Its a great indulgence  if your on a diet and you really dont have to much to feel gulity about.

I boiled the mixture for exactly 1.5 minutes. I didn't put vanilla extract in and put in about 1/2 cup of corn flakes. I found them soft and oily and way way way too sweet. Even one little piece goes a long way. I didn't like the texture at all but perhaps I did something wrong somewhere. The pictures do look good but I don't think I'll ever make these again.

These were good but I wouldn't recomend using Splenda instead of sugar as the Splenda taste was a little over-powering. Otherwise, they would have been a five!

Love this recipe, I've been using the same variation for literally years!! It's fun to mix it up a bit, add some nuts, some butterscotch chips when you add the oatmeal.  The cooking time is important...make sure you get it to a roiling boil then time.

Very good tasting and easy to make.  The key really is to start timing once the mixture is at a full boil.  I only had creamy peanut butter on hand and they still came out great.  I know these will be a hit.  Quick to make too if you are short on time.

This cookie recipe was featured on the PBS children's show ZOOM back in the 70's. The first cookie I made on my own and I have been SEARCHING for the recipe for a long time.  SO glad to have found it!

AWESOME!! I like that these have a little less sugar than your average no bake cookie, it makes them taste so much richer.

Love this recipe!  My grandmother gave me a no-bake cookie recipe years ago that I lost in a move.  This is the closest that I've found to hers

This recipe is AWSOME! It is so easy to make and my family LOVES it!  For the best cookies it is important to follow cooking times exactly.  We love these cookies so much that we have them at least once a week!

My husband and youngest daughter love these cookies.  It's a great recipe when you want cookies but can't or don't want to use the oven.  And yes they are very sweet but you shouldn't complain.  Just look at the ingredients.  How could they be anything else?

I couldn't find my mom's recipe, but this came close.  These came out fine after boiling about two minutes, but I also used cold peanut butter (refrigeration keeps the oil from separating in natural peanut butter).  These cookies are meant to be sweet, but I wonder if the people who thought these were TOO sweet used sweetened peanut butter (most major brands) instead of natural.  I use Teddy--just roasted peanuts and a little salt.

Very good! These are VERY time sensitive in relation to the boiling portion. But they are good whether cooked too long or not long enough. Once in awhile I'll under cook them but they still taste good eaten with a spoon!

This was so easy!  I made them for my son's preschool's section on dirt and renamed them Dirt Clods... a huge hit with the kids!  I usually get impatient with boiling times, but this time I heeded the advice and it worked!  Boiled for 2 mins on our gas range, and these weren't crumbly at all.

This was the first time I've made these and they turned out wonderful! The only thing I changed was that I used creamy PB instead of crunchy. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and these were great! Thanks for the recipe.

Glad I found an old childhood favorite -I boiled the mixture at full for 1.5 min. they set but were very sticky. Used creamy PB - will use less sugar, boil longer and try more oats and coconut next time

I don't think I boiled the mixture long enough, because I had to put my cookies in the fridge to set. They were still good, but soooooooo sweet. Might as well just eat sugar with a spoon. I thought they could use more oats too -- there was alot of the liquid mixture, not enough of the "cookie". Not bad, but not for me! My friend loved 'em though.

These were great, but with modifications- I boiled the chocolate mixture for exactly 2 minutes which was the perfect amount of time, I added about 1/4 cup more Peanut Butter, and added about 1/2 cup coconut. 
They turned out great and didn't last longer than two days with the family!

These cookies are delicious. I added an extra 1/4 cup of oats and boiled the mixture for an extra minute in order to get these cookies to set correctly. These cookies are simple and delicious. Neither my husband or myself could get enough of these yummy creations.

These were called "haystacks" in my elementary school and everyone LOVED them.  They are a favorite!

I was first introduced to this recipe by the wife of a cousin. She made them for our family Christmas party, and since has brought them almost every year. My family absolutely loves these! We use creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy.

These are pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and the first cookies I spooned out didn't harden correctly. I found that if I let the mixture cool slightly in the pan I got better texture.

This is the best no-bake cookie recipe on this site- or anywhere else for that matter.  Perfect!  I was also able to do this in the microwave, VERY carefully, but I wouldn't suggest that for someone who has never made these before.  I melted the margarine first, then added the rest of the ingredients and stirred well.  Then I stirred every 45 seconds, and let it boil for almost two minutes.  Then added the oatmeal and dropped the batter onto parchment paper.  Thank you for this recipe!

These were easy to make and tasted good.  I thought they were better the next day, and then I kept them in the fridge to keep them cool and hardened (especially with it being summer now!).  Not the best cookie I've ever had, but definitely a good recipe when you have a sweet craving and need quick ingredients on hand.  Will keep recipe around for the next time.  :)

I notice alot of reviews about this recipe that mentioned 'their childhood memories'  And it applies to me too.  When I was a kid we had a special treat when Mom would pop a HUGE roaster pan full of popcorn AND make these no bake cookies. Then we would sit around the tv and watch the "wonderful world of disney" !!!!!
munching on the  salty popcorn and the fudgy sweet of the 'no makes'!!!!!  Wonderful combination and memories.  thanx

Perhaps I should have timed how long the mixture boiled but I didn't and as a result I had to keep the cookies in the fridge so they'd firm up. They tasted just like I remembered (delicious) and my 4 year old LOVED them. I'll have to keep trying until I get them right.

These remind me of the "fudgies" I used to eat in elementary school.  My mother-in-law calls them "raggedy robins".  They are very easy to make once you get your timing down pack.  I like them because this little recipe makes a lot and I usually don't have to stay in the kitchen making sweets for a couple of days.  I like these better with smooth peanut butter.  These are also delicious with raisins.

I loved a version of these cookies, served at my middle school. We called them cow plops, but loved them anyway. For many years I have tried a dozen recipes for this cookie that all resulted in gooey disasters. In fact when my husband saw me attempt these he protested "not those things again!". For once they turnred out! I believe the timing is crucial so carefully follow the instructions!

Always got to love no bake cookies.  Instead of putting on wax paper, I grease up a small cake pan (about 9 inches long) and put it in there and then cut the cookies into bars.  Goes over well that way and takes up less space.  I would highly recommend, and suggest trying creamy instead of chunky peanut butter.

These cookies are the first cookies that Mom let my sister and I make on our own (some 25 years ago)  The recipe has been lost for years and years.  I looked them up at 4:50 am and I was putting in the review by 5:10 am.  They are wonderful.  (I didn't let them cool before I tried them and that is the BEST with a glass of cold milk)

You will never know how I appreciate you putting this recipe on this site.  I have not had these cookies since high school.  I had the recipe and lost it along the way somewhere.  I have been looking everywhere on the internet for this recipe and now I have found it.  I thank you and my children thank you!!

The recipe needs to be more clear.  It never mentions when you take the pan off of the heat.  It doesn't say whether you put in the peanut butter in before the oats (so it can melt).  But it is a very tasty recipe!

I lost my recipe for this a while ago and I tired this one instead and I was absolutly pleased with the results.  Do be careful with the boiling time, but these are so quick and easy with no unnecessary ingredients!

After making many versions of no bake cookies, this recipe has topped them all.  Denise is right about the boiling time.  I took them to the race track last night and everyone said they were the best they ever tasted.  Thanks Denise for giving me the best version yet.  Joyce Thomas

The entire family loves these cookies. Everyone from my husband down to the grandchildren. I would tell anyone to not pass these up.
