I made 6 different BBQ sauce recipes today and my husband and I just had a taste test - this was the favorite of both of us!  I made it exactly as directed.  It was a great opportunity to use up some of the horseradish I bought at Christmas.  Thanks Teri!  Yum!!

This is very good, but next time I will use less sugar.  Too sweet for my taste.

This is a great BBQ sauce! As soon as I saw the recipe called for Horseradish Sauce I knew I had to try it....I love the stuff!:) I did not have any dry mustard so I used prepared mustard. I did a search and found that 1 TBSP prepared mustard= 1 Tsp dry mustard. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a "T". Love the flavor!!

Great sauce!!!!  I didn't have any horseradish sauce, and I added a couple of dashes of garlic powder, it turned out great.  Will use again.

I enjoyed it.  It was a little sweet for my personal tastes, but it is precisely what it says it is: an easy, quick BBQ sauce that doesn't call for exotic ingredients.   I didn't have any BBQ sauce on hand, and this definately saved the meal and a trip to the store!

This was really good! Works great on the BBQ grill and good for dipping at the table.  I used it in the crock pot too, on a nice brisket.  Good all around sauce.

I use this when I'm in a pinch, but I tweak the heck out of it.  I give it 3 stars only because I use it as a base.  I go light on the brown sugar because it gets way to sweet.  I up the horseradish by a 1/2 tsp, also add a squirt or two of prepared yellow mustard to taste.  1/2 tsp of ground onion.  Works great with the the BBQ Beef Cup recipe.

Teri, Thanks for this recipe.  I needed a base to start from as I knew some of the main ingredients I wanted to use, but needed a kick start, so I ended up omitting the brown sugar and used Agave instead for the sweetner, added a little sweet chili sauce, oyster sauce, chili pepper flakes and no horseraddish (i didn't have any on hand).  It turned out awesome!!  Great reviews

This was an easy recipe and the sauce was pretty good too. I did not have any dry mustard, so I substituted 3tsp. regular mustard. I would call this a sweet BBQ sauce, but it was not too sweet. I will make it again. Thanks Teri MC for sharing.

I thought this recipe as is was OK.  It basted well on baked chicken and added flavor, but I found the taste a bit bland as most bbq sauces often have a bit more zing to them.

Just right with HALF the sugar.  Good balance of sweet, tart, and tangy flavors.  Enhances and compliments shredded, roasted pork loin very nicely.  Very easy.

I made this one day when I ran out of pre-made store bought BBQ sauce. It's tasty and pretty similar to the store bought stuff, but if I was to make this again I would probably use about half the sugar listed in the recipe. It is too sweet for my taste. I also didn't have the cider vinegar so I left that out and it was still good.

I used this on leftover pork roast from this site:  placed the BBQ ingredients in the slow cooker with the leftover roast cut into four chunks, cooked on low for two hours and shredded, served on buns or rice.  The combination of the sauce from the first roast with the BBQ sauce was delicious!  I did decrease the sugar in the BBQ sauce by half.  Keeping this one!  Two meals in one!

amazing! We substituted honey mustard for horseradish since we didn't have any.  It was so good.  Our 6 year old and twin 2 year olds all devoured the pulled pork with this sauce.

Wow!  I made changes out of necessity--we had no horseradish, and no dry mustard so I skipped the horseradish and used a Tbsp of spicy brown mustard.  It was wonderful.  Put it atop the Healthy Turkey Meatloaf, but I can't wait to use it on many other things!  Thanks!

My kids loved it with slowcooked pork chops.  I ended up making a second batch for dipping.  I used regular vinegar, horseradish flavored mustard and also added onion powder, garlic powder and salt.

This is not the best sauce, I have ever had, but it was very quick and sooo easy.  My husband liked it real well.  Instead of the ketchup, I used some extra Ragu we didn't use the night before. This sauce  made our chicken really tender and moist.

It was a bit sweet so I added one good teaspoon of minced garlic and that took it over the top. My husband loved it. I will be making this again.

This is the first time I have rated a recipe. I had slow cooker chicken left over and decided to make pulled chicken. I tried this recipe and am glad I did.  It was excellent!!!.  Next time I will double the recipe. Thanks Teri.- OliveOyl

This is my family's favorite BBQ sauce.  We made it the first time only because it was the only recipe on allrecipes that we had all the ingredients on hand.  Turned out fantastic!  Follow recipe as written and have used on beef/pork ribs, chicken and anything we need BBQ sauce for. Thanks for a great simple recipe that ended up being the BEST!

Excellent! Had put a rub on the chicken and realized I didn't have any bbq sauce.  Found this and the chicken came out beautifully.

Made as is. A bit too sweet perhaps but good if that's what you're after.

This is a terrific BBQ sauce. I made it today to pour over pulled pork. Of course as is the case with most reviews here I've made a few changes due to necessity and taste. First off I made a double recipe so needless to say (and yet I'm saying it anyway) it has twice the ingredient amounts.  As for the changes, the only one I made was I used Grey Poupon instead of horseradish sauce since it was all I had (and there is horseradish in GP anyhow). To this I added one tablespoon molasses and two teaspoons Old Bay Seasoning for a little kick. Great flavors. I will definitely be trying this on chicken and ribs.

This came out really great!! I used it to dip some chicken that didn't have enough flavor. I left out the horseradish b/c I didnt have any. The hubby and kids loved it!!
