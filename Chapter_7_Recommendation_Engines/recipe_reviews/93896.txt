This recipe is wonderful.  Even with the changes I had to make due to ingredients I lacked I thought I was at a high end Indian restaurant! (Since I was out of peas and ginger I used dry ginger and extra cauliflower.) Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will use again and again.

My family and I loved this.  I used dry ginger, broccoli instead of cauliflower (because I didn't have it) and used extra ground cumin since I didn't have cumin seeds either, and used canned chopped green chile peppers instead of fresh and it all turned out really well.  I also sprinkled a little salt on it in the end.  Will definitely make again but will try to stick closer to the original recipe next time and I'm sure it will be even better.

I loved this recipe, it was a big help since I recently went vegan. I take advantage of the roasted chilies for sale at road side stands in the fall and freeze them. This addition added a smokey flavor, awesome.

I thought this overall was very good but too dry.  I didn't have the cumin whole seed nor the mustard seeds and I think that could have enhanced the flavor.   This is worth making again ...I would just add some stock to moisten it.

Have never tried this before so I have nothing to compare it to.  It was good, but felt it could have used some salt.  Also, we didn't have black mustard seed.  This might have made a difference.  We'll try it again.  Made it with the Biyrani rice which was outstanding.

Very easy to make and versatile dish. I changed out cauliflower because i didn't have any with shiitake mushrooms (they were going to go bad!) and regular peas with snow peas. I ate it as a main dish and served as a side for family. Added plain yogurt and pita bread! MMM. Will definitely be making this again.

I really liked this.  I added more of the spices (more chili, curry, and cumin) than what is called for to suit our tastes, and also fried all of the spices in about a tablespoon of butter after browning the onion.  Just how I learned to cook Indian food.  Very good and easy recipe.

Really delicious!  So much healthier than the cream-based Indian dishes.  I didn't have black mustard seed and used double cumin seeds.  Also, I substituted frozen peas for fresh...I just added them to the dish later.  I will definitely make this again.

DELICIOUS!  I only used the spice profile along with the garlic and ginger and smeared it on big chunks of cauliflower along with oil and roasted in the over an 475 degrees.  This was super delicious!  Next time I may try the actual recipe but the spices on whatever veggies you have around is so good!  loved it!

Loved this! I know it's supposed to be dry, but I'm just too lazy to stand there stirring so it doesn't burn, so I added water. I let it boil off, but it does come out more moist than otherwise. Also didn't have black mustard seeds so I threw in some kalonji and yellow mustard seeds instead . And yes, it needs salt!!!

Everyone enjoyed this.  I didn't use potatoes or carrots but it was good with just cauliflower and peas.  Not too hot but very flavoursome.  Served it with rice and lentils. Great vegetarian dish.

It tastes good for me. Its 4&1/2 for this recipe because , the ground cumin is too pungent for me it would be better if we use cumin seeds directly rather than grinding them. In ground state cumin opens up the taste and aroma too much for this recipe which I felt.

This was delicious and the spices were right on!  I made 2 minor changes.  I used black cumin seed and brown mustard seed.  That's it.  So flavorful!  I served with naan on the side.

Use curry leaves which you can find in an Indian market.  Bay leaves are not used in Indian cooking.  I assume they substituted bay leaves assuming most people wouldn’t have access to curry leaves but in no way do they taste the same.  They are amazing!  Will enhance the flavor and smell of many Indian dishes.

I agree that this needs salt. I also took the heat up a notch with spicy pepper. Couldn’t find black mustard seed so I used yellow. I also used  packaged “cauliflower hash” for convenience. I think I’ll try less potato and more veggies next time.

I have never made an Indian dish before and I was so surprised at how easy and delicious the flavors in this was.  Having said that, I did make changes to the vegetables I used only because it is what I had on hand.  Instead of cauliflower, carrot, and green peas...I used frozen mixed vegetables.  I finished it off with salt at the end because it was to my family's liking.  Everyone loved it!

We loved this dish. Had it with daal, naan and cucumber raita. Without an accompanying dish it might be too dry. It's certainly a dish that one can adjust to taste. Next time I might play with the spices, but we liked it just as written.

Delicious!  I served it as a side dish with Indian Chicken Curry, rice, and naan and it was wonderful.  I couldn't find black mustard seed so substituted with brown, and threw in an extra carrot, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  Great flavours.  Will definitely make this again.

Was only going to give this 4 stars because of lack of flavor which is crazy with all this spice right, until I realized what's missing. Salt! It's not in the recipe so I didn't use any. But once I added salt the rest of the flavors started to come through. Veggies need salt so to your liking. By the way next time I'm leaving out the potatoes.

What I did: Chopped the veg (3/4" cubes) and baked for 20 min @ 400 degrees rather than messing around with the microwave. This eliminated the need to drain water.  Added more carrot for sweetness, disregarded the chiles and chile pepper, used a drained can of peas, and omitted the black mustard seed because my grocery store hid it from me, and added salt. Essentially, it's veggie hash with a bit of curry powder in it. My plan for next time is to try and authenticate it a bit more spice-wise. But there definitely will be a next time!

This is a very good dish...the subtle spices bring out the sweetness of the onion and carrot. Unlike any veggie side dish I've made before!

Had to improvise on several things.  Didn't have the seed ingredients, or regular potatoes and only used 1.5 green chili (family cant handle too muchheat). Did have a sweet potatoe so I used that and doubled the rest of the veggies. In the end I doubled the curry powder, ginger, cumin, and added a tsp of honey to round it out. Ate this as a side with samosa's we bought locally. NOTE: the corriander raita (made myself) and mango chutney (purchased) that we used for the samosas really were an amazing addition to this dish too!  So much flavor, just loved it.

This was an easy dish to make. I used frozen cauliflower and added salt at the end to taste and the dished turned out fine. The cilantro did improve the dish to me.

I absolutely adored this dish! Not the usual cream base, but oh so spicy and flavorful, and beautiful colors as well. I cheated and used frozen diced potatoes because it's all I had on hand, but they worked perfectly. Will definitely make again, next time with some raita and naan on the side. Yum!

this was very good but I had to modify it hence the 3stars. halfway through cooking I realized that unless I added some liquid to the pan I would have a burnt mess so I would occasionally add a  bit of vegetable stock just to keep everything from sticking to the pan perhaps 1/2 cup in all. the spices seemed to soak up all the oil so there was nothing left for the vegetables to cook in. i also added 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt at the end as it really needed salt to bring out the flavor of the spices. while it tasted great, a dish that you have to constantly stand over, watch, stir and add liquid to, for 30minutes isn't very practical.

It was o.k.  I didn't feel the work involved was worth the taste.

Thanks so much to the commenters, my dish came out AMAZING! I added some vegetable boullion and a lil salt plus some broth as some of the commenters mentioned it was dry and could use a lil more salt. I definitely recommend anyone who is planning on making the dish to also take this advice as my dish was delicious because of it. I also added some sweet potato to mine

Just made it and I love it!! Much easier than I thought! I used frozen vegetables because that's what I had on hand and it worked out great!

This recipe was awesome! I served mine with plain yogurt which helps cut the heat and balanced it out nicely, but it was delicious plain as well.

Very dry. I added stock to it and am trying to moisten it.
