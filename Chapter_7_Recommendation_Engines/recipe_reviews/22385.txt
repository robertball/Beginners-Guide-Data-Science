This is the best Cracked Wheat Bread Recipe I had ever used.  I cut the All Purpose Flour down to a bit over 3 cups for that soft texture and great crumb... The 4 cups is good but a bit more dense.
And too, I like to toss in a couple Tablespoons of Flax Seed to kick it up a bit.

This is an incredibly light, tasteful bread.  I let it rise for almost a full hour and a half the second time and the dough tripled... making it even more airy!  Since my family has been on this health kick lately I added 1 cup more whole wheat flour instead of the white flour.  Now they can eat it AND say it is healthy!  :)

I have searched for a great wheat bread recipe for years- I've finally found it!  Unbelievable texture and the flavor (with a little extra molasses on my part!) is heavnly.  My family loves it and so do I.  THanks for sharing it!

With a soft texture and a firm yet giving crust, this Cracked Wheat bread recipe sure pleased our taste buds. This was the first recipe we used with cracked wheat and it was delicious. Because of past experiences with wheat flour we feared this bread would be dense but it was far from it with a hint of sweetness.  Like another reviewer, we found the bread needed to rise longer than specified (ours took over an 1 hour on the first rise and an 1 1/2 hour on the second rise). But don't let this stop you from using this recipe, this will be our go-to wheat bread from now on. Thanks for the recipe.

I used all whole wheat flour. The loaves tasted just slightly sweet. Having to cook the cracked wheat won't slow you down too much.

I have made several wheat breads in our bread machine -- most from "all recipes".  This is by far the best.  My husband rated it "outstanding!"  Thanks for sharing!

Great bread, Nancy. Wonderful dense texture but with a light and fluffy crumb. Nutty flavor, and best of all pretty healthy. I sub'd canola oil for margarine. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe.  I increased the amount of whole-wheat flour (reducing the white flour proportionately, but still retaining some).  Great flavor, great "crumb."  Makes wonderful toast!

I have replaced my other cracked wheat bread with this recipe.  I have been making homemade bread for 50 years and this is the most wonderful bread I have ever tasted. Thank  you for this great recipe.

This bread was great! It has a wonderful aroma that lasts. The crust is perfectly crusty. You don't even need to put anything on it. Plain is delicious!

This bread was very good!! I did change the serving size to "30" so it would make enough dough for 2- 9x5 inch loaves. The original recipe only made two small loaves for me and I like a little larger loaf. I used demerara sugar in place of the honey and molasses, used 1 tablespoon SAF instant yeast and added 2 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten. I cooked the wheat, let it cool; then added 1 tsp. demerara sugar, the wheat flour and yeast and let it sit for 10 minutes until bubbly. I then stired in all the other ingredients to the yeast-wheat mixture and put the dough into my bread machine for 15 to 20 minutes( just to stir and knead the dough) then I let it rise until it doubled in an oiled bowl. Shaped into 2 loaves and let it rise again in the bread pans. Baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes... Awesome!!! My whole family loves this bread..  Note: If you use all-purpose flour add some vital wheat gluten or use Bread flour so your bread will rise better and have a better texture.

This is a great recipe, I used sprouted wheat and truvia instead of molasses and honey.  Came out delicious.  I will be making this again and again.

This is an awesome recipe, however I substituted cracked rye for cracked wheat and used less honey to reduce the sweetness

Very nice.  I think I overbaked it, but that's my fault--the crust was very hard, but the inside was still very soft and hearty.  I used wheat bran since I don't have cracked wheat, and didn't boil it bc I didn't think it was necessary with the wheat bran.  After everything, it turned out a very lovely bread.  Hearty ww flavor yet soft enough for sandwich breads.  I did add about a tablespoon or so of wheat gluten.  thanks for the recipe!

SO good! This is a light, simple recipe. I, too, was afraid that this was going to be a dense bread, but I'm pleasantly surprised. I did have to let the bread rise for quite a while the second time, probably close to another hour instead of a half hour, and the loaves still turned out a little on the small side. I will just have to let them rise longer next time to achieve the desired height. I have no complaints about the taste of the bread, though. This recipe makes great toast in the morning.

Wonderful flavor.  Paired with a homemade jam, it's just perfect.

Easy to follow instructions. Even easier with the Kitchenaid stand mixer... No kneading needed.  :D

This was a very good recipe.  The bread turned out perfect.  I wanted it for a good toasting bread, however it was to soft for my taste.  It also was a bit crumbly, but still good.

Absolutely phenomenal.  I recently started breadmaking when the in-laws gave us a Kitchenaid.  This and Challah I (joan callaway) are my favorites so far.  Of the wheat bread I've made this is, hands down, the best.  I tossed in a little wheat germ and replaced the water with whey (including cooking the cracked wheat).

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully. It has a nutty crunch and is just about as soft as white bread. 
I'm a novice when it comes to yeast breads but this was worthwhile.

I was looking for a recipe that used dried spent grains or spent grain flour and couldn't find one so tried this recipe and it worked great. I used the dried whole spent grain instead of the cracked wheat and used 1/4 cup spent grain flour and reduced the whole wheat flour by 1/4 cup. Wonderful nutty flavour. Love it! If you have warm grains from brewing you could skip boiling the dried grains and just add the wet grains to the bowl, but make sure they cool off first.
