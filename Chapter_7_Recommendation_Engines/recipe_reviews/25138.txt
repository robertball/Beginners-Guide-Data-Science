This was quick and easy but I would have liked a more chocolatey taste.  The raspberry sauce was a big hit.

I made this per the instructions in a springform pan, and I made it in smaller
pyrex cups, baking them less time.  I think they make an excellent individual
dessert, on a small pretty plate with the sauce under the individual cake.  You
must use pam or other non-stick spray in the pryex cups, and loosen the sides 
of the cups with a knife and turn out will still warm.  Very pretty!

The glaze was very good, but the cake turned out dry around the edges and soggy in the middle.

I prepared this for my choco-holic sister-in-law. We all loved it! The only problem for me was the time and physical space involved.  It's one of those desserts which should have it's own time and space...don't try to prepare it during other course preparation...certainly not in a small kitchen with other projects going on at the same time/same place! Still it was marvelous!
