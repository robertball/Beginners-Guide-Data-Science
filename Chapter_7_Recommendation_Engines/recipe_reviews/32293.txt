It was excellent. I would have liked to give it 5 stars for kid friendliness, but I'm not sure that children should be drinking wine (even if it is mixed with lots of fruit and lemon-lime soda).

I hadn't made Sangria before until my boyfriend's 36th b-day recently. . . the beverage was a hit. Many comments that it was really good. I DID add Jamaican Rum to the mix though. This recipe made 6 pitchers.

I got so many compliments on this sangria.  I made it w/ a papaya/mango/melon mix of frozen fruits and it was delicious.

I had 1/2 bottle of red wine to use up, so I scaled this recipe down to 6 servings.  I actually butchered her recipe.  I used what I had on hand: red wine, sprite, fresh peaches, fresh strawberries, and sugar.  Drank it right away, instead of letting it sit for 6 hours.  It was perfect, and just what I was looking for on the hot humid day!  I'm not the greatest at following directions exactly, they're always a guide!  Either way this is a keeper!

Very good.  I had never had sangria prior to making this, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I took the advice of another recipe and added about two ounces of Cointreau and sliced strawberries.  My mom even loved it, and she's a wine snob.

I added a lot more fruit, but omitted the bananas.  Used about a cup (ish) of rum, half cup (ish) of Sloe Gin and half cup (ish) of Triple Sec, and a full bottle of some red wine.  I let it sit for a bout 4 hours, added two liters of lemon lime soda, served over ice and sprinkled with a tiny bit of cinnamon.  I drank way too much, it was that yummy!

I have made this several times for family functions and it is a big hit, I always add 1 cup peach snapps, and 1 cup coconut rum to give it a little more Kick. We usually have it for birthdays and our family reunion. People always ask me about it, and want to know what is in it.

I thought it was delicious! It made a huge batch but six of us drank the whole thing in an evening!  It was light and lovely! I put in one bottle of white to three bottles red I think that gave it just a bit lighter texture. The peaches were definitely my favorite, but I'm not sure I'd do the bananas again, as they got fairly mushy.    DELICIOUS Sangria.  Loved it!

Holy Cow is this sangria excellent and easy!!!!  I only had peaches, oranges and 1 apple.  I halved the recipe and used splenda instead to make it lighter.  Awesome!  I believe I used the same amount of splenda.  It was so good that my friends made me make more on the spot.  They even ran out to get more soda.

This is the best sangria I've ever had!  My daughter in law had always wanted to try sangria and I made it for our housewarming party.  She loved it!  I will definitely make it again!

This is a great refreshing summer drink!  I chose the recipe because I liked the mix of fruit in it.  Made it as written except I reduced the sugar and added a little peach schnapps.  For wine, I went with red zinfendel.  Came home with an empty pitcher!  DH and I are wondering if this recipe could also be made using a white wine, not that I want to mess with perfection!  UPDATE-  Yep, great with white wine too!  Used Pinot Grigio.

Great flavor, loved the touch of cinnamon.  I would Definately recommend using whole cinnamon sticks... not crushed.  This way, you can remove them before the flavor becomes overwhelming.  I left them in overnight, but removed them a few hours before serving.  Replaced the bananas with slices of orange and Lemon.  Thought the bananas would be too soft.  You could pretty much add any fruit you like and also a bit of brandy or peach schnapps, instead of rum, if you prefer.

I made this for New Year's Eve for a small gathering.  It was excellent.  I cut the recipe down for just 12 servings and I wish I hadn't...everyone liked it so much that we ran out!  I will definitely make this again.

a very authentic recipe, this sangria is one of those things that works when you make changes. i've made this several times using a nice pinot noir and 7-up. if you don't like peaches, oranges work well and you don't have to use bananas. we like strawberries in ours, too.

This was a hit at a Wedding Shower I hosted. My cousin (the bride-to-be) said it was her favorite. I scaled down the recipe to only serve 25 people. I also used diet 7up instead of regular to cut down on the sweetness and calories. Definitely will make again and will not change a thing as far as ingredients go. Thanks for this recipe!

Cut the serving size in half for my small party.  My guests enjoyed it.  I enjoyed.  Not the best sangria ever, but it was still tasty and easy to make.  I left out the cinnamon as I'm not a fan of that flavor.  I used one gala apple, pineapple chunks, and orange slices as that's all I had at home.  Really with sangria you can't go wrong with any medley of fruit.

I got a good number of compliments on this one, someone even told me they thought it was better sangria than a local favorite. Both pitchers I made were gone pretty quick. I changed one thing by not adding bananas, and I cut back on the amount of sugar and cinnamon slightly. People seemed to notice and enjoy the addition of cinnamon. I think it gave the sangria a nice fragrance. Overall great recipe both for its tastiness and simplicity.

Made it for my daughter's 21st and World Cup game. I bought a red wine from Spain that had chocolate in its ingridients.  I replaced the bananas with strawberries. It was fantastic and everyone loved it! Perfect to celebrate Spain's victory.

This was fantastic!  I used non-alcoholic red wine from the grocery store so that I could drink this at a party while pregnant.  It was a really nice treat on a warm summer night.

Easy and cheap to make.  Not the greatest Sangria I've had but then again I omitted the banana...added cinnamon instead of the sticks (2 tsp is too much for 4L).  Then I added oranges. So I didn't follow it exactly.

Tasty!  I prepared 24 servings, but still added an entire 2-liters of lemon-lime soda.  I once tried a seasonal fruit sangria that a national restaurant chain was promoting, and this is just as tasty as that sangria, if not more so.  But way cheaper!  Now I can buy a pair of shoes AND enjoy my sangria!

This was fantastic! I've been drinking the white peach sangria from this site, as red wine hasn't been agreeing with me too much (headaches the next day!) but this was surprisingly fresh and tasty, and that's even when I messed up and tried to halve the recipe, without halving the sugar, so I ended up using two different kinds of red wine! I didn't even use the carbonated drink, which made this a bit more rich than it probably would have been, but served over ice with ample fruit and it was great! Had my sis-in-law asking "Is it time for more sangria?" while visiting from France : )

I used blush instead and it turned out great. I needed a spoon for that delicious fruit.

Made this for my husband's 40th birthday party. Everybody raved about this. They kept asking if I really made this or bought it. I also made some minor modifications. I used 1 Tbsp ground cinnamon rather than the sticks. I also added lemon & lime slices.

Apart from omitting the bananas, I made this as written and quite enjoyed it. It isn't as strong as I like for a Friday night, but it would be great for a summer BBQ or gathering. Thanks!

OMG! I was skeptical about the banana, but it was delicious! I have made this several times, and it is always a hit even with those non-wine drinkers!! I like to add a fresh sliced orange with the peel on. When the pitcher is getting low, I scoop out the fruit into cups and enjoy the drenched goodness!!

I omitted the bananas, and over the years I have discovered that I prefer less cinnamon and carbonated beverage. Still, good recipe!

This is a tasty sangria. I tripled the quantity to serve 150 guests and used a couple of lemons instead of bananas. I also added 1 small bottle brandy. The cinnamon sticks gave it a nice flavor as well. I would use this recipe again.

This is a very good recipe. Simple and easy. I have made this for two parties and everyone loved it. I would suggest not using bananas cause they get real soft and mushy. If you don't mind spending the money get an imported Spanish or Italian wine.

Though not my favorite recipe for sangria, it was by far the easiest! And  I had all the ingredients handy.  Hubby loved, but I thought it was a little on the sweet side and will cut out a little next time.  Thanks for an easy drink to whip up with chips-n-salsa or for taco night!

This was fantastic! Scaled it down for two people and omitted the bananas as I read reviews beforehand. Otherwise followed recipe and I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for my Mexican dinner last night. We had 80 people so I got two huge bottles of red wine and two 2 liter bottles of Fresca. For the first batch, I used the large bottle of wine and the whole thing of Fresca. Then, I added the fruit exactly as the recipe says(I didnt use sugar cuz it was already so sweet with the peaches). I highly suggest NOT using sugar. It was fantastic!!! I wished last night that I had some rum to add....

I loved this recipe for it's simplicity. substituted cherries for the peaches because that is what I had in the fridge, and scaled everything down for the 1/2 bottle of wine I had leftover in the fridge. I found Mexican Sprite at the store (which uses real sugar!), and added just a couple dashes to taste. Don't know if it actually needed any white sugar, as mine seemed to all sink to the bottom and remain in the pitcher. I love banana in Sangria, but it seems to be personal taste, as so many others prefer to leave it out. Saving this recipe as my go to. looking forward to trying it with ginger ale next time!

I made this without the cinnamon because I didn't have any on hand. It went over great at my gathering and several people requested the recipe.
