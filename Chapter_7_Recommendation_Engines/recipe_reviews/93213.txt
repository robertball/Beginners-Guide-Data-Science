This is a great recipe when you're in a hurry. I would suggest skipping out on the bread bowl. The recipe really makes too much to put in the bread bowl  and it'such a mess. Use a stiff cracker also (like a triscuit). I've taken this dip to two parties and it's gotten rave reviews.

Quick, easy, delicious. I didn't bother with the bread thing - just mixed it up, heated it through on the stove, then served it in a bowl with crackers and celery sticks. Very good! Thanks, MistyR!

OMG! So good I had trouble staying out of it before the party!  I made extra by adding another 8 oz cream cheese and a cup of 1/2 and 1/2.  I used dried minced onion (to fool the kids, they don't notice them as easily) and 2T. jarred jalepenos and upped the ham a notch.  I just put it all in the little snack crockpot and let it set on low until smooth, then turned it to warm to keep it from burning.  Served with crackers, tortilla chips and potato chips.  Was smooth and easy to dip!  So good--will make VERY OFTEN!

I'd like to add to this recipe, as I forgot to add the sour cream to the original!! Please feel free to add 8oz of sour cream for an even yummier experience!!! You can also add another jalapeno if you want it spicier!

Kudos to Allrecipes for making this recipe correct on the 1 lb loaf of bread! I can't wait to make this!

I had great expectations, but this just wasn't popular at our recent parent's night. I'll admit that I baked it in a pretty dish instead of in a bread bowl; maybe that's the difference. Sorry if my review lowers the rating; it was too rich, IMHO.

I've been making this for years but my recipe called it Mississippi Sin haha guess I should call it Indiana sin since I'm from there. I don't worry about putting it in the bread loaf either, not worth the trouble. I serve it with cut up pieces of italian bread, french bread or the already sliced bread sticks from Kroger. It always gets rave reviews at parties. I have given out the recipe many many times.

I'm so disappointed.  I've been wanting to make this dip for a long time, and I finally did.  It just wasn't what I expected.  It would probably go over well at a party, but I won't make it again.  All I could think about is how much fat must be in it.

We absolutely loved this recipe! It was a huge hit at my party. The only thing I did different was to cut the cheese to 2cups instead of 4 and added about 1 tsp. mustard powder. It needed that extra umph! I also added some half n half to make it a bit creamier.. Next time I will add a bit more ham and another jalepeno as we could barely taste the spice. I cooked it in a bread bowl, it fit fine but it did take over an hour to heat through. I will do it in a casserole dish the next time. Served with chunks of rye bread. I will double this the next time I make it! It is now one of my favorites!! Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a really great recipe... yummy and different!  The recipe makes alot, so I served half of it at a gathering with friends and the other half the next day for a shower at work.  Everyone loved it as is, however I personally am not a big fan of the ham.  I am concidering substitiuting the ham for crab or baby shrimp next time.  I really like the spice in this dish and it goes really well with a cold beer! :)

I made this for a superbowl party. I received lots of compliments. The recipe made more than I could fit into the breadbowl, so I put about half of the dip into a baking dish. I served this with crackers. I also cut up and toasted the circle piece I had cut out of the bread to form the bread bowl.

Well, I almost gave it 4 stars, but then I thought, "why would I do that?" It is delicious, maybe not my very favorite appetizer, but again, it is delicious and easy to make. I didn't use the round bread, but rather baked it in a casserole dish.

My family and friends all loved this recipe.  I didn't use the bread bowl the first time I made this dip, but I have since and I like it both ways.  Additionally, I tried this with crab meat instead of ham and it was wonderful.

Awsome!  Made this for Game Night with our friends & everyone loved it!  I did us the bread bowl but next time I'm just going to put it in a pretty dish & bake.  My husband said he liked this dip better than any of the others we've tried!  I will definately be making this one again!

The cheddar cheese was too oily and would not spread well,after a couple minutes. I suggest a creamy cheese such as Velveta.

Thought this recipe was pretty good. Thought I couldn't go wrong with this recipe being a cheese lover. My brother absolutely loved it & my hubby didn't think the texture was creamy enough for his taste. Ate it with french bread. Maybe I'll double the cream cheese next time.

This is a definite keeper and is SINFULLY delicious!!  I made it in a casserole dish rather than in the bread, but think next time I will make it in a bread bowl.  It is a little greasy because of all the cheese, but I think the bread would take care of this.  Thanks for a great recipe!!
