I've made this dish twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe, and found that as written, it was much too bland for my taste.  I made it again tonight, with the following modifications:  Instead of 1 tsp season salt, I used 2 teaspoons of McCormick roast chicken seasoning, plus about 1/2 teaspoon each of dill and thyme.  I also added a good dose of fresh ground pepper, and used 1 can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup.  Much more flavorful the second time around - my family loved it. Great basic recipe!

I have enjoyed this recipe for years only I add a package of dry onion soup mix sprinkled over the top.  It gives the dish the extra seasoning that really brings the whole thing together for a great taste.  It is an easy one dish meal.  I have added brocoli and/or mushrooms in the past as well.

This was great!  Since it is just my husband, myself, and my two year old, a recipe this size would have leftovers.  Not this time.  My husband went back for seconds and thirds!  Having said that, I should let you know I made some changes to the recipe.  I switched one of the cans of cream of chicken soup for Campbell's creamy chicken verde soup.  I added 1/2 cup frozen chopped onion, and instead of the chicken breasts, I used boneless skinless chicken thighs which I laid on top of the rice mixture.  I then sprinkled the entire dish with season all.  I also sprinkled about a cup of shredded monterey jack cheese and some finely crushed tortilla chips on top for the last 15 minutes without the aluminum foil.  I know that is a lot of changes, but it was yummy!  I will definitely make this again.

This casserole is easy to make and uses inexpensive ingredients, but is bland as it is, so I made the following changes to mine.

When cooking the chicken, I added minced garlic, coarse ground pepper, and a few dashes of ground red pepper.  I substituted 1 cup of the white rice for a 1-cup pkg of seasoned yellow rice mix.  I also added garlic powder, white pepper, a few dashes of poultry seasoning, and more ground red pepper into the rice mixture before putting into the oven.  Ten minutes before the casserole was done, I added shredded monterey jack cheese with jalapenos on the top.  

NOTE:  It is important that you use the correct size casserole dish to ensure your results are neither too dry nor too wet.  

With my add-ons, the end result was a very good dish overall.  My family prefers dishes with some kick and depth of flavor, and this recipe delivers.  There were no leftovers with this!  My husband loves this dish and can't wait to have it again.

Great basic recipe.  In fact the only one I could find that used two cans of cream of chicken soup. (It was the only soup I had on hand and I didn't want to run to the store)  Great comfort food.  Would be especially good if family was sick or under the weather because of its mildness.  I added a few items for flavor including parsley, chives, chopped onion, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper.  I also added a small amount of grated cheddar cheese to the top just before I removed it from the oven.  It did require quite a bit more liquid than called for.  I used two cups milk and two cups of chicken stock (I boiled my chicken and cut in pieces before adding to this recipe)  I also cooked  it for only one hour.  The rice was tender and the recipe was creamy.  (hint:  read the cooking directions on the bag of rice you are using, some brands of rice call for more liquid than others.  My son said "Mom , this one is a hit."

Great base recipe, I took everyones advice and added a few things of my own. I only did a half version of the recipe, and I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. I added 1.5 cups milk, french fried onions, and about a tablespoon of garlic salt to the mix. I also topped it with croutons and sharp cheddar cheese during the last 15 minutes of cooking. The only thing I will change next time is adding more rice. If you don't like your rice creamy, I wouldn't reccomend this recipe as it currently is. This will be a new staple in our home! If you like to experiment in the kitchen give this one a try! You can't go wrong!

This recipe is quick and easy. Only I wouldn't cook it for 90 minutes. 1 hour seemed to be enough. The liquids really dried out after an hour. If the rice isn't cooked you could add another half to one cup liquid and cook longer. Hope this helps!

Thanks for the original submission as well as the many detailed reviews!  As said before, excellent base but imperative to add your own flair to make it really good.  My family is big on flavor and this was my first casserole ever so here's what I did.

Used 3 cups milk, totally thawed the chicken and soaked in (hot water w/ 2 chicken boullion cubes, seasoned salt, pepper and a steak dry rub I like to use).  Used Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken and seasoned with 1/2 tbsp Paprika, 4 tbsp Garlic Salt, 4 tbsp Pepper, 1/2 tbsp Garlic Powder, 2 tbsp Onion flakes.  Placed in greased casserole dish then topped off with a bag of Mexican shreaded cheese.  
After 1 hr pulled it out.  The middle was not done (chicken still light pink and rice crunchy).  Mixed the whole thing up with an extra 1/2 milk.  Then recovered and cooked the remaining 30 mins.  Came out *perfect*.  Everything was evenly cooked, it wasn't too watery or dry (I hate things that are *too* creamy) and there wasn't a single leftover.

Next time I will stir every 30 minutes and might try not topping off with cheese til the last 30 minutes.  Good Luck!

Really good and basic; I also made some changes to the recipe.  I only used 3 chicken breasts instead of 6, and instead of adding 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, I substituted one of the cans for cream of mushroom instead.  I only used 1 cup of milk instead of 2, and added some paprika, chili powder (we like it kind of spicy) and garlic.  Instead of baking it for 90 minutes, we only put it in for 60 and it turned out just great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family loved this recipe, but they are getting used to a little more spice. I substituted one cup of chicken boullion for one cup of milk and also coated the chicken pieces in creole seasoning before baking. The changes went over very well, adding a little spice without changing the overall warm and fuzzies you get from this traditional meal.

I learned this recipe about 25 years ago. Yeah, that's how old it is.  Here's the kicker - I made it the way this recipe calls to make it.  When I made it the very first time I used the asked for 'regular' rice and it took forever and when I pulled it out at the time suggested it wasn't done the rice was crunchy.  Well, to make a long story short (lol) I called the person who gave me the recipe and said, "I cooked that dish for way more than the hour it called for and the rice never cooked" her reply was, "Oh, didn't I tell you that your suppose to use MINUTE RICE not regular rice".  It has worked ever since to perfection.  Equal rice and milk to each can of cream of chicken (cut into strips) - plus seasonings of choice. Sometimes a extra can of rice for the road.

This was an outstanding dish!! Because of the other reviews that said it was bland I made a few changes. I added paparika and season salt to my chicken breasts and browned them in butter. I also added onion and celery. After thowing it all together I added the Lipton Onion Soup mix that others suggested. I just poured it over the top. And the masterpiece was created!!! This really was exceptionally delicious!! And it was in no way bland!! It was FANTASTIC!! And besides those few little things added, I made it just like the recipe said!!Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and also to the people that added the helpful reviews! I just love this website!!

I used minute rice instead of regular so I only had to cook it for 45 mins, I also used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of brocolli. I added a small bag of frozen mixed veggies and cheddar cheese to the top covered and baked. It came out good with leftovers. I also added garlic powder, onion salt and pepper to give it more flavor.

I thought this recipe was a good starting point. I changed a few things in the recipe. I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can cream of chicken with herbs. I used more milk, and it still started to dry out. Each time I pulled it out of the oven to stir, I added more chicken broth to keep it moist. I ended up putting 2 cans of broth in the casserole. I will make this recipe again, though. I will continue to tweak it a bit.

Very easy to make.. took some of the suggestions.  Added 2 and 1/2 cups milk to make sure it was moist, added crushed red peppers, cajun seasoning, cyenne pepper, and poultry seasoning to soup mixture before I poured it on top.  Topped with cheese the last 20 mins of cooking.. all in all pretty dang good.

A good, basic recipe but I'm like others, if I didn't add some other spice like some Tony's, it would have been bland. I also added some panko bread crumbs on top like another reviewer.

This is a very good base recipe. I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk as adviced from previous posts. I also added fresh garlic, dill weed, frozen peas and corn. I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of broccoli. I will definately make this again but next time I will use already cooked chicken and shred it instead of using chunks, it will cut cook time alot and chicken won't be as dry, I will also add a little more milk, 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. Very good though.

So simple and tasty. I followed another reviewers advice and used a tin of mushroom soup in place of one of the chicken soups. I also added paprika, garlic and chilli powder. Cooked for full 90 mins. Lovely :)

This is a great base recipe.  I cooked the rice separately.  I added a lot to this because I felt it might be a bit bland as is. I added parsley, a bit of savory, a few shakes of Montreal Chicken Seasoning, some seasoned salt and pepper to the cubed chicken, and cooked it up in a skillet with some olive oil and onion, just browning the pieces of chicken.  To this I added some baby carrots, sliced celery and the milk and cream of chicken.  I simmered this for maybe 10 minutes and then dumped it all in a baking pan (not sure of the size, but much smaller than 9x13 as I halved the recipe to begin with).  I baked this at 350 for about an hour, at which point I shredded up some Cheddar Jack cheese (maybe 1/4 cup) and melted that in.  Also added some frozen peas.  Back in the oven for about 10 mins, and served over rice.  Very very good, will definitely make again, and I will probably modify it some other way next time.

This recipe was BLAND. I even spiced it up with some of my own spices, then to top it all off, the whole top of the thing (cooking at the temp listed and the time listed) burned! Half my rice was black and the other half was bland. It also wasn't very creamy - everything was very dry. I won't be making this again. At least part of it was semi-edible though.

Made this last night for the wife and I so I cut the recipe in half (for leftovers). I took some advice of others, added 1 1/2 cups milk to one can of soup with 1 cup of rice, added a small can of mushrooms, had to bake about 1 hour & 15 minutes then added panko bread crumbs and shredded cheddar cheese for 10 minutes. For spices I rubbed in Old Bay seasoning on the cutup chicken. It was good, but next time I would precook the rice (not totally cook it) on the stove because baking rice leaves it a little crunchy...

This dish was delicious! I was cooking on a sunday for the week ahead and had about 3 chicken breasts left that I wanted to use up.  I got on here to find a casserole using chicken & cream of chicken soup (two items in pantry).  I found this recipe and had most of the items, so I quickly whipped this up between my honey mustard chicken tenders and potato soup.  My husband and I loved it! It was supposed to be eaten tonight for dinner and he just couldn't wait...dug into it last night!  I made a few changes to mine just because I threw a few things together: 
*I used 3 boneless/skinless chicken breast, cubed.
*milk, white rice as called for in recipe
*1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of celery
*seasoned salt, chicken poultry season, onion powder, pepper all to taste 
*about 2 handfuls of shredded cheese added in soup/rice mixture, then when I stirred for the last 30 mins. I added another handful (and a half) of cheese to top of casserole. 
**I cut baking time down to 60 mins. and 10 mins. uncovered.

We will definitely make this again (sooner than later too!!) Thanks alot for the recipe!! I must try!

This was ok.  I only used 2 large chicken breast which was pleanty enough meat.  I used 1 can of cream of celery soup, 1 can of chicken soup, I also added other spices like others suggested, pepper, onion powder.  I cooked for 60 min like other suggested and it seemed like the rice wasnt done enough and it also need more liquid so I added about another 1/2 c. of milk and cooked for another 10 min.  My kids liked it, it was something easy and not bad just ok.

Wonderful dish! I also added 1/2 cup extra milk, saute'd the chicken with a chopped onion, used one can cream of chicken and one can cream  of mushroom soup, and threw in some peas & mushrooms. Topped it with cheese at the end.  It was really good!  Great basic recipe that can be jazzed up with whatever your family likes.

A very easy recipe to make. I usually cut the recipe in half for my family of three. I also add a pack of Lipton's onion mix, a bag of frozen peas and carrots and use brown rice instead of white. The recipe only got dry when I didn't cover it well during cooking.

This is a very basic recipe.  My son, who doesn't like anything fancy, LOVED this.  I added a little extra season salt and a sprinkle of onion powder.  I will definitely be making this again.

I really liked this recipe.  I do agree with several people that is a good base recipe.  I really hate dry chicken and rice so I added another can of soup (cream of mushroom) and another 1/2 cup of milk.  I also added onions, minced garlic, more salt, garlic salt, cayenne pepper and onion powder.  Also, to get some veggies I added some asparagus.  Turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe has good bones, but needs finesse-whole breasts, more liquid, and some seasonings.  I added veggies, mushrooms and fresh herbs.  Onion soup mix will deliver some punch,too!

Great base recipe. My family LOVES spicy food and I'm rarely able to get the spice up to par. I sauteed the chicken in garlic and yellow onions. I added salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and a bit of chicken broth. I poured the chicken juices into the rice mixture. I used a few more ounces of cream of chicken soup, and added more milk during stirring when the rice seemed to dry up. Also, because I cooked the chicken before baking, the baking time was only 45 minutes. The rice was perfectly done. During the last 5 minutes, I added garlic flavored bread crumbs and shredded cheddar and monterey jack cheese to the top. It was awesome. My family only had to add a bit of tabasco sauce and declared it perfect.

What a great and easy dinner!  I prefer a little more flavor so I substituted the cream of chicken soup with cream of broccoli and added fresh broccoli florets. I also added garlic powder, onion powder and ground black pepper. Adding some cheddar cheese to the top during the last 10 minutes of baking makes it even that much better. Yummy!

My husband really liked this recipe - says it's a "keeper"! He's a tough critic so I'd recommend this recipe. Would, though, add a little extra seasoned salt next time. Agreed with other rater to also add a little extra milk to help keep rice moist...90 mins fine with extra milk and stirring as recommended.

Pretty good and very easy to make. I like to have seasonings added, and would like to see this recipe have add-ins like peas or something.  Without these things, the flavor tends to taste too much like canned goods.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't cut the chicken breasts up.  I left them whole and they cooked fine.  My 2 1/2 year old loved this meal.  She is a picky eater.  I highly suggest this to anyone out there looking for a quick meal.  This left our family of three with plenty of leftovers too.

This is a great recipe. I cut the recipe in half and made it with cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have any cream of chicken. I also discovered that if you do not stir it while it cooks, the rice on the bottom crisps up quite nicely and adds some texture. I sprinkled the seasoned salt over the top of the casserole, which seemed to work nicely as well.

So so easy and quick.  Family favorite.  I did find that I need to add more liquid usually at about 45 minutes into the cooking.  I like to add chicken broth but have used water in a pinch.  The soups that I like best are Campbell's Cream of Chicken with HERBS and cream of celery.  Little if any additional spices are needed with the herb soup. I also add mild cheddar cheese in the last 15 minutes uncovered.

Love this recipe - I though combine this version with a version my mom made growing up...I actually 1/2 cook the rice first just in the microwave as directed on the rice package.  I then add salt, pepper and a few diced-up green onions (scallions), and instead of milk, then use 1 can cream of chicken & 1 can cream of mushroom soups - all in with the rice.  Once I have the chicken cut up into pieces, I add the rice mixture and chicken to the baking dish and follow the cooking directions the same way.  My husband says it is MUCH more flavorful this way!  I agree!  :)

I made this recipe today and did exactly what recipe called for and had to add 2 1/2 cups of milk to keep the meal from burning.  Otherwise, every thing was the same.  I baked it 60 minutes and the last 15 minutes turned temperature to 175 degrees and placed sharp cheddar cheese on top.  It was very good but thought you might like the changes.

Just how I remembered my dad doing it. Cut up a fryer and worked just as well. Combined cream of chicken and cream of mushroom. Only stirred once at 45 min because my daughter wanted to stir the rice again. Otherwise, I would have left it from the original mixing. Aside from these differences, I loved it.

Great. I added a lot of cheddar cheese and a tablespoon of onion powder along with some wheat germ just for the health benefits. I used cream of mushroom since I did not have cream of chicken on hand. My daughter, who insists she does not like chicken, ate this up.

This was very good! I took the advice from one of the comments and added a packet of onion soup mix which added a very good flavor and I also used brown rice instead of white.  I will definitely make this again!

It's an easy recipe, but a bit bland.  I make it exactly as written, and it could use something.  BUT, I will say that if made exactly as written, it's a GREAT recipe for someone under the weather, or craving something simple and comforting.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to make this recipe easier.  I used a whole rotisorie chicken already seasoned, and cooked my rice before hand, season to taste.  Then added everything with variations of veggies.  Baking it for 45-60 mins.

This is a great basic recipe because from here you can really add what ever you like to make it different each time! I did fallow the others advice and "spiced" it up a little so it wouldn't be bland. My family loved it.

I was very concerned about my rice ending up either too dry OR too mushy, so i cooked my rice seperate. I cooked the cut up chicken (seasoned with italian dressing seasoning packet) with 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken, plus one cup of milk. Added some fresh mushrooms.  Also added handful of cheese at the last 15 min of cooking. Poured the mixture over the rice, and it was awesome!

This is a good recipe, but I did not cook it for 90 minutes, more like 45 minutes, and then about 10 minutes wihtout the tin foil. My family loves it. If I had Lipton Onion Soup Mix, that'd be a welcome edition.

A couple different things.  Running the oven for 90 minutes would heat the house too much(small) so I cooked the chicken first.  It baked for about 25-30 minutes and was perfect.  I added a couple extra spices, we always play with them.  I also topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and french fried onions before baking.

Like others have said, this is a good base recipe.  I am making this again tonight, but am adding lots of salt, pepper, garlic powder and chili powder.  I have added mushrooms and/or onions in the past as well.  I highly recommend seasoning the actual chicken before adding to the casserole.  Otherwise, the whole thing is too bland for my taste.  Not the greatest recipe, but a good start for what could be tailored for your family.

This is a simple comfort food recipe and very tasty. My kids loved it. I did cook the rice first and I also used the meat from a deli rotisserie chicken instead. It was creamy and yummy. Will make again.

This recipe just needs a little help and it can be good. Change the plain white rice to some flavored rice, I used Uncle Bens broccoli & cheese flavored, saute some onions, celery and garlic if you like, add some broccoli or other veggies. I did this yesterday, dumped it all in the crockpot, covered it with chedder cheese and my hubby thought it was great!

This casserole was very good after I made a couple of adjustments. I added fresh garlic, green onions, mushrooms, sherry and chicken broth. Next time I make it I will cook the rice first as the rice takes all the juice and it comes out pretty dry. I just cooked a couple more cans of soup according to the directions and added it. I also added some cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking.I will make it again. Thanks

I also added more milk, broccoli, garlic powder, onion powder, & pepper.  I also spinkled cheese on top when I removed the foil.  My husband is getting over a bad cold & he loved this.  It was comfort food for him :-)  He even made sure there were left-overs for work tomorrow.

Made this tonight for dinner.  Used 1 can of cream of mushroom and one of cream of chicken, and added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables.  Kind of bland tasting; would add more salt.

This recipe is so easy.  The only changes I made to this recipe was adding a 1/2 cup of chardonnay as well as tossing the chicken with olive oil and 3 teaspoons of McCormicks French Rub for chicken.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as it is written...turned out great.  Moist chicken, creamy and fluffy rice, seasoned to perfection.  And took minutes to prepare!

I also changed the recipe a bit after reading the other reviews - I added one can of cream of mushroom instead of 2 cans cream of chicken- I also added some more seasonings (salt, pepper and seasoned salt.)  I also changed the baking time from 90 minutes to 60.  it turned out great and was a huge hit with my family!  We will definately make this again!

I only had 2 cans of cream of chicken soup on hand and this recipe gave me a great start!  I used a 2 quart baking dish.  I browned the chicken first, used 2 cups of uncooked brown rice instead of white, 1 cup of milk instead of 2 cups and added onion, peas, corn and red pepper.  I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt and added Johnny's Seasoning Salt for extra flavor.  I baked for one hour, then uncovered, added grated cheddar cheese and baked for an additional 10 minutes.  My boyfriend loves comfort food and this hit the spot!

I use brown rice in all recipes which changes timing.  My workaround: I saute half an onion and sliced mushrooms in olive oil and butter, then I throw in a bunch of fresh spinach to wilt it (with a little water).  I use organic cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup, and organic skim milk.  I then let it simmer on the stove top for 15 minutes to soften the brown rice (stir the pot, or it will stick).  Then I dump it into the baking dish, add the chicken, cover and bake.  Tonight I'm making it with a splash of sherry - we'll see how it comes out.

childhood fave.  like to customize each time i cook it.  skinless breast healthiest, but chicken pieces with bones cut with cleaver give best taste,  frozen peas and carrots nice to add, sometimes some spice, thing is, cooking isnt always by the recipe, use your imagination and knowledge of culinary requirements.

Really liked the recipe, i did however only use one can of soup and one cup of milk as i had less chicken and rice.  I did omit the onion soup mix and added cheese (colby & parmesan.)  Also I used basmati rice which added a much richer flavor. This is a great dish for a cold winter night and with little to no prep work will use this one again!

I made this when my husband and I were recovering from a horrible stomach flu.  It was great--neither one of us had any problems with it.  Mine came out very dry, but looking back on it, I may have accidentially omitted one can of soup.  (I was sick!)

This was OK - not bad for easy I guess, but just nothing exciting.  I don't feel so bad about that considering the other ratings I'm seeing on this page.  I see there's been a lot of changes made to this.  Yes, it's fairly easy, and it's OK - it's not like it was a waste, just not terribly exciting.  As one person said, just good for a weeknight uncomplicated meal.  Oh, and I did notice one person mentioning Minute Rice -- I used that without thinking about it much and had no trouble with it getting done.  Perhaps instinct told me Minute Rice would work, which really is what you need to use.

I made this recipe almost exactly as listed (subbed one can of cream of chicken with cream of mushroom because that's what I had) and it was just okay.  The kids ate it fine, but I found it pretty bland.  I think I will play with this one a bit...

This was so simple and my whole family liked it.  I cut my chicken in small pieces and only cooked it an hour. We added a little salt and pepper, and it was great.

I needed at last-minute quick lunch, so I used chicken and rice that I had  precooked.  I just added enough milk to make it creamy.  I tossed in some frozen peas and shredded cheese and popped it in the microwave.  Fast and easy.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I'm writing to you about this exquisite piece of cuisine majesty called chicken & rice casserole. It was easy to make, but fresh, spicy good & delicious in its taste.  My class made it for the teachers and they ate it up.  Thank you.

This was very good, but I followed the advice of some & added onion soup mix & thought it was too salty.  The 2nd time I made some changes, I only used 4 breasts, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 1/2 c. of milk, added 7 oz of canned mushrooms, whole grain brown instant rice, 1 pkg of Knorr Fine Herb soup mix & left out the season salt entirely. It added a great deal of flavor & was not as salty.  My picky son devoured it & we'll continue to make this a lot as I've revised.

The first time I tried this recipe was in Wisconsin last year. But the lady added  carmelized bell pepper. It gave it such a good flavor. Also she put in one can of chicken broth along with the two cans of cream of chicken soup. Delicious. My grandkids love it. That is all that matters.

I scaled this recipe down to 2 chicken breasts, which required about 55 minutes of baking. I would recommend increasing the soup, milk, and rice, as the chicken was really dominant. I added onion soup mix and fresh pepper for flavour, and would say this is the minimum in such a bland recipe.

I like to follow the recipes without modifications the first time I make it. Having said that, this dish was just okay, was way to bland for me and my husband. Next time I will take some of the others suggestions and spice it up a little bit.

I really disliked this dish.  It was very heavy and rich, which my stomach does not take very well. Also, half an hour after dinner my daughters were complaining they were hungry again. I'm not knocking anything about this recipe, just that we didn't like it.  Thanks for the offering, though!

This is the easiest to make recipe and it tastes so rich!  A variation I use is to add a teaspoon of paprika plus a tablespoon of lemon juice with the soup mixture plus 1/4 tsp of black pepper.

I thought this was great. Definitely needs more flavor added in so I added some onion, garlic salt, and some fresh black pepper and it was wonderful. Thanks for the post.

This was good after I added a packet of onion soup mix. I had fresh chicken, as well as leftover cooked chicken, so the last 15 min, I added in the cooked. It seemed a little dry, so I spooned in some sour cream, and it made it yummy. I also sprinkled on some cheese and slivered almonds, to give it some crunch.

Very simple, great comfortfood. I tried different types of cream soups for variety and also adding an extra 1/2 cup of milk as we like a creamier dish. Still, this is one of our favorites!

Can't get your kids to eat rice? Make this for them and they'll be requesting it all the time as mine does. Add the extra milk as suggested by others. It makes a big difference. Just yummy!

The flavor was good, but it wasn't as creamy as we wanted it to be. It was a pretty dry casserole, so if you're expecting the oozing & creamy casserole, this isn't it (at least not without some tweaking).

This recipe was great! (after I made quite a few changes)To me the recipe seemed quite bland sounding, so I jazzed it up! To the rice mixture I added Italian Seasonings, pepper,onion powder, garlic, and salt to your taste. To the chicken I added salt and pepper,(my chicken was pre cooked) 
I will be making this a lot!

I wanted to save time, so I precooked the rice and chicken pieces.  I did not cut back on the milk, and I used Campbell's Southwest Soup for some kick.  It turned out pretty good!

I was looking for a really easy chicken recipe.  It seemed to me like this was about as easy as you could get, and would also be yummy.

It WAS easy, but turned out WAY too dry.

In a Word...BORING!!!!!  Now I can see where this would be good for a family with small youngins but frankly for an adult, this is just beyond bland.  I think if you threw in onions, garlic, a little wine and omit the milk and add sour cream then maybe you have something...Otherwise this is a one dish wonder.

This recipe was okay.  I made a few additions for flavor (chicken bouillon, garlic salt) as suggested by other reviewers.  The chicken came out overcooked and the casserole wasn't very creamy when all said and done.  I think next time I'll boil the chicken with some bouillons and cook the rice ahead as well.  Then I'll only need to cook the casserole for about 20 minutes.  This recipe is a good starting point for creative modifications.

We loved this recipe!!!
I have three toddlers that are going through that picky stage so I snuck a cup of broccoli in with about half a pound (or maybe a little more!) of cheddar cheese.  I only had on very large breast on hand but I also added pepper and paprika.  I topped with seasoned bread crumbs for the last ten minutes of baking.
This dish turned out fabulous.  All the rice was tender and my kids all had second helpings!!!  That's when I know a recipe is a keeper!

I took the advice from another review and added a large can of mushroom soup, cut back 1 cup on the milk and seasoned the rice with rosemary and basil. I then seasoned the chicken with a little galic salt and some more rosemary--Turned out great

This was a nice, fast, hot base that needed a little bit of doctoring.  I followed others' advice and used some garlic powder, one can of cream of chicken soup, one can of cream of celery soup, and at least 2 3/4 cups of milk.  I kept checking it about every 30 minutes, and, since I used brown rice, it took quite a bit longer to cook, but it was well worth the wait.  My husband and I loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

i finally had a chance to try this! it seemed like a great dish to make when you have lots of  to do but still want a homecooked meal on the table. i followed EVERYONE's advice and this dish therefore came out pretty darn good! i used cream of chicken with herb and added extra water (i don't think i'd like cream of mushroom). the only big thing i changed was to add a little less liquid and little more rice since i DON'T like 'creamy' rice (blech!) and the rice came out great. also, i HEAVILY seasoned the chicken breasts, liberally sprinkled them wiht flour, and pan friend both sides to a nice brown color and THEN added them to the dish to cook through along with the rice. it made the chicken look MUCH more appetizing, in my opinion. that's the thing with this dish: smells great while cooking, tastes delicious, but the presentation is UGLY. i so wish i could make this for guests, but i just don't think it looks like a yummy dish. too bad. 

i give it 3.5 stars, husband gave it 5 stars, for an average of 4 stars. definitely give it a try!

Nice basic recipe. I saw it and thought it had some potential as a base and nothing more. This is what I did to zap it up. 
1 can Cream of Chicken with herbs
1 can Cream of Chicken with mushrooms
1 heaping teaspoon of garlic
Broccoli florets
Then on top a layer of sharp cheddar

I also parboiled the chicken in Garlic and Herb seasoning mix.

Came out AWESOME! Family said it was a keeper.

Thanks for the basic recipe! I gave it 5 stars because it is a wonderful base.

Tried this last night because I was looking for something that quick and would use ingredients I had in the kitchen.  I took previous advice and modified this recipe to include roast chicken seasoning, knorr french onion soup mix, one can of cream of mushroom, one can cream of chicken, lots of black pepper, some garlic and herbs, extra milk and I sliced up protabella mushrooms.  This turned out pretty well and I am looking forward to trying the leftovers for lunch.  I definately agree this recipe needs tweaking for your individual taste and you REALLY need extra liquid for this or I imagine it would dry out and you would end up with crunchy rice.

It was just "OK". I added broccoil and some garlic salt with sauteed red onion. But it was still pretty bland.

I added a bit of water after 60 minutes as it was looking kind of dry. Then I baked it for the full length of time but I don't think it needed that long. It was a little on the bland side, but I guess that is why my picky hubby liked it. I loved the fact that that it was super easy! Will make again. If he likes it and it's easy, it's a keeper!

I added the extra milk, some spices, and the taste was good but it was still very dry.  Not at all creamy.  I forgot to grease the dish and it was a disaster.  Needs twice as much liquid as indicated.

Yes this recipe was easy, but the taste wasn't what I expected.  Perhaps more salt was needed and more milk than it called for (?).  Although it was "okay", I don't think this will be a keeper for my family.

So easy!  And because of the reviews i was able to tweak the recipe and use the ingredients I had on hand.  I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can evaporated milk with a boulion cube.  Then I added the milk carrots, cooked leftover chicken, and uncooked rice.  I also added raw carrots and onions.  I melted cheese on top and cooked it with a foil topper for the first hour.  then uncovered it and crushed ritz crackers on top for the last 10 mins. or so.  I beleive the onion was the key to success!
Delicious!

I think there is a total error in this recipe. I have made it a couple of times and the second time was definitely better than the first. The first time I stirred the rice every 30 minutes. Don't do that just leave it tightly covered. The second time I didn't stir, left the foil on and after 60 minutes, chicken wasn't done and rice was crispy. I put it in covered for another 30 minutes and it was perfect. Both times my chicken was raw.

It was bland the first time when I followed the recipe. The second time I generously added the spices which I usually do and it was better- I added Vegeta (Serb here), Montreal Chicken Seasoning and garlic powder in addition to the recipe spices which came out great. I would say tweak this to your tastes. Good base recipe.

I've made this dish for years & lost my recipe...  Based on the reviews saying this is dry, please note that the recipe calls for raw chicken breast.  The juices from the meat add moisture as it bakes.  I sprinkle it with Onion Soup mix before baking.  Thank you for sharing!

This was so so as is. I only had 1 can of soup. So, I halved the recipe. To add volume, I added 1 cup of frozen spinach to the soup rice mixture. I also only had chicken quarters. I browned them with a good dose of lemon pepper seasoning quickly in a skillet before I topped the rice. I baked it covered for 45 mins. and that was plenty of time for the chicken and the rice. I would submit this as an entirely separate recipe. But I cannot find the link to share since AR updated this site.

Overall a nice easy dish! There's only 2 of us so I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 glass pan. I added a tsp garlic powder, tsp thyme, and kept the salt at 1 tsp. mine took 1 hour to cook through, stirred once halfway through. I also did not take the foil off at the end to make the top of the casserole crispy (just a preference). Next time, I think I would add a little extra milk to make it a little saucier. It was creamy tasting but I'd like just a little extra liquid/cream sauce as the rice really soaked it all up. Would be nice with some broccoli florets added in too. Will definitely make again :)

It was just OK - after about an hour everything got super dry. Good thing I didn't cook it for 90 minutes... also glad I added some extra seasoning or it would have been a little bland. Next time I will add more liquid and cook it for about 45 minutes. I added sage which really brought out the flavor of the chicken.

Like the others said, this recipe is pretty bland. However, that leaves lots of room to add the spices and flavors you like. Good minimal recipe.

I just threw this together loosely based on this recipe:  I used a rotisserie chicken (not quite all of it - two legs and about 1.5 of the breast meat), a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of broccoli (would have used mushroom if I had any!), and five-minute-rice and reduced the  cooking time to 30 minutes! ...  will edit review once the family has tasted it!  =-D

Was very good!  I did make some changes.  Used one can cream of celery, added 3 shredded carrots, and 1/2 cup of diced onions.  Also added about 3 tbl each of Maggi chicken bouillon, Mrs Dash original blend, parsley flakes, and black peppercorn ground.  I know I changed it alot, but it came out really good!

Acceptable, but not much flavor.  After reading other reviews, I added onion and garlic, and some other seasonings, but it is still missing something. I'll look for another chicken and rice recipe.

This was so delicious, and we STILL have left-overs! This makes plenty of servings (we're a family of 5 with 3 teenage children) for us, and that's saying something. The ammount of chicken called for turned out to be a lot, so next time I might only do 4 or 5 chicken breast halves. I also added some paprika, thyme, and poultry seasoning.

Family loved this! I did make some changes to the recipe, I sweated down about half cup of onion and a clove of garlic in some olive oil and butter. Also added some thyme, black pepper, and added 3/4 cup chicken broth.  I also sprinkled some chicken seasoning to the chicken before adding to the rice and soup mixture

Not bad, but I found it a little bland. I added some garlic powder, some onion flakes, and oregano, and added a topping of crushed saltines, cornflake crumbs parmagean cheese and butter, but I think it still needed a little more flavor.

Water/milk needs to be added based on your rice (per box inst.)and then some more. Also added onions and more spices.
Good recipe, would do it again

I am not sure what I did wrong with this recipe. As others suggested I added a pack of onion soup mix and I even added some fresh minced garlic with salt and pepper and some onion flakes and this was terribly bland!

I knew this was going to be on the bland side before I even made it but I thought I could spruce it up with some broccoli & minced garlic.  It came out "alright" but nothing I would make again exactly like this.  The broccoli helps a lot!  I added milk to it every 20 minutes and it was still on the dry side.  It's easy just like the recipe says but it's nothing I will make again.  We're going to have leftovers for days.

My family and I thought this was a very good recipe - great taste, easy to prepare, and all-in-one.  There were no leftovers.  The chicken I used had already been marinating in Italian salad dressing - great flavor.

As written, the recipe would be fairly bland, so I took the advice of some others and added a pkt of onion soup mix and at the end of the baking time, added shredded Monterey Jack cheese. Yummy! I also chunked up the chicken so I only baked it for about 60 minutes at 350 degrees. Then I bumped the oven temp down to warm to melt the cheese and hold it until my family could gather to eat. So easy to make and very good!

I made a few changes to mine. I used 1 can cream of chicken soup & 1 can of cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic soup. I also added some frozen brocolli. When I cut up my chicken breasts I put some poultry seasoning, thyme & rosemary. I also put some shredded colby jack cheese on top the last 15 minutes of cooking. My family loved it!  The original recipe needed some seasoning, it was bland, with the things I added it was absolutely delicious! I don't see how others could use a 9x13 pan, I had to use an 11x13 dish. It fed 4 of us & we had leftovers for the next night. Very easy & fairly cheap dish to make.

This is a very good basic recipe. If you read it, you will see there is not a whole lot of spices listed... which is why some people might think it "bland". Don't be afraid to personalize it! With this in mind, I made this recipe as it was but added 2 cups of frozen brocolli cuts, frozen corn, fresh ground black pepper, thyme, and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. It came out so delicious and moist. Make sure you cover it the first hour... the last 15 mins i sprinkled parm cheese and some italian breadcrumbs on top. My boyfriend and I both loved it.

This past summer I was looking for a quick and easy chicken and rice casserole and found this one. I also read almost all of the reviews and took some of the posters variations to heart.  The problem was that I didn’t have the ingredients on hand so I went to my pantry and started experimenting. What I ended up with is the following then over the past several months I’ve made several variations to this dish that I list after the main recipe … of course I’m only mentioning the variations that I thought were successful … 1 package of Lipton Rice side dishes
2 cups of water. Mix in the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking dish. Place, boneless, skinless chicken breasts on top of the rice and water.
Sprinkle frozen, chopped broccoli on top of the rice mixture and around the chicken breasts. Cover with foil and Bake at 350 for 45 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake another 15 minutes or until the chicken has a bit of color to it. Make sure the rice doesn’t dry out. Variations: Add 1 cup of sour cream and/or 1 cup of chopped cashews to the rice mixture before placing the chicken breasts on top. After removing the foil, add a dollop of cranberry sauce to the top of each of the chicken breasts. Hope you all enjoy this easy casserole as much as I do.

I've made this recipe many, many times and I've learned to modify it to my taste using: 1. 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can cream of mushroom soup instead of 2 cans cream of chicken, 2. I sprinkle all chicken breasts with paprika, salt and pepper on both sides before I lay them in the pan. 3. After sprinkling with spices in #2, I lay the uncooked chiken in pyrex dish, add soup, milk and cook.(no rice). I cook my rice separately, put my rice in a dish and spoon the mixture over the rice. A sprinkle of freshly ground pepper on top and YUM.

I used 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 1 can cream of celery soup, and an extra 1/2 cup of milk.  Also, I added frozen broccoli and fresh carrot pieces.  The 90 plus 15 minute cook time worked great, and it came out nice and moist. As some of other viewers suggested, I did add a pack of onion soup mix.  Would definitely make this again!

I changed the recipe a bit b/c of the reviews.  I used 2 cups chicken broth PLUS 1 extra cup of milk. I did this because I was using Long Grain Rice.  Using this rice made the cook time to almost 2 hours!  Wouldn't do that again. I added 3 cups frozen brocolli spears, 1 package dry onion soup mix and topped with crackermeal crumbs. The rice was very tasty, especially with the brocolli but the chicken was too plain. Everyone loved the rice but found the chicken boring. This is a great recipe to sneak in ground flax seed. Cannot taste any difference but gives you the added Omega & Fiber benefits.

It was OK.  Next time I will doctor it up.  Turned out "gluey".  Don't cook for 90 minutes would be my best advice.

This is a great start but I am going to add more spice next time.  After reading several reviews I added garlic powder, onion soup mix, and 2 1/2 cups of milk.  When I checked it after 45 min to stir all my liquid was gone so I added another cup of milk.  I am not sure why that happened, but I continued to cook it for the remaining ime.  The rice was still a bit crunchy, but I will make this again adding all the liquids to start with.

This tastes great but I would combine the onion and chicken soup and put some of the soup mixture underneath the chicken and then the rest on top. the first time I made it the rice had no flavour bacuse all the sauce was on top.

Add a teaspoon of oregano and a teaspoon of salt for increased flavor. This is a great comfort food!

I didn't like this recipe. I felt it was too bland and would need some 'jazzing' up. My husband liked it and ate my leftovers!

This is a very easy and basic casserole. I add an extra ½ cup of milk and another teaspoon of seasoned salt in the rice mixture.  Then I sprinkle the top with a bit more seasoning salt before serving.  The whole family loves it.

This was just ok. The rice was mushy and it needed something with a different texture, maybe broccoli. The flavour was alright, as I added some crushed red pepper flakes and hot sauce to the soup mixture. I also used mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. It wasn't dry, just kind of a mushy mouth feel. I'll try something else next time

Surprisingly good!  I used some cooked rotisserie chicken in addition to the raw chicken.  I also added a wee bit of cheese on top.  I'll make this one again.

I loved this recipe.  It was so quick and easy to make.  I altered it a little and added some crushed Italian Style tomatoes, and dried bread crumbs to the mix and I chopped and up and added some red onion.  Very tasty.  The kids loved it too!

I planned to make this casserole before I actually had a recipe so I bought 2 cans cream of celery soup in anticipation.  I followed the recipe and added a can of mushrooms.  Some of the rice didn't get quite soft enough, but overall it was very good and my children enjoyed it for dinner, then lunch the next day.  I will definitely be making this again.  Also, I used legs and thighs (skin removed) in place of breasts.

I used cream of mushroom soup in place of one of the cans of cream of chicken, as some other raters had suggested. I also have made this recipe using bone-in thighs or breasts and it has come out just as well. I only use 1 cup of milk and have added sliced mushrooms and seasoned the chicken before sliding it in the oven. It can be done without stirring at all, but comes out better if you stir it while it's cooking.

I used two boxes of mushroom risotto rice instead of white rice. For the chicken I added rosemary, basil, salt, and pepper before placing it in the rice mixture. 
I'd also recommend adding more liquid before cooking. I had to add more liquid because it cooked off so quickly or was absorbed by the rice.

I liked this recipe.  It does need to be tweeked quite a bit.  I used more milk, one can of Chicken broth(in addition to the cream of chicken), garlic powder, and Onion Soup mix to liven it up.  If you start with the basic recipe you can add things to make it your own.

I thought it might turn out bland so I used 1 can cream of mushroom & 1 can of cream of chicken and added a teaspoon of thyme, pepper and paprika.  I also added fresh garlic and onion to the rice mixture to liven it up.  I used chicken pieces instead of boneless chicken and it turned out great! Not a quick fix though...it took 2 hours to cook.

I followed this recipe exactly and my rice soaked up all the liquid about 30 min into the cooking process. I had to keep adding more and more milk so that it wouldn't burn. I think there is a mistake in the recipe. I served it for dinner and I was had to apologize to my dinner companion!

I pretty much agree with other reviews about this recipe and I took a lot of their advice.  Here is what I did:  I used 2 1/2 cups milk + 1 cup water, one can of chicken w/herbs soup plus one can cream of mushroom, 2 1/2 cups of rice and a teaspoon of table salt.  I only had 4 large chicken breasts in the freezer, but it was more than enough for this dish.  I put it in a 350 oven for about 1/2 an hour, checked to see how the chicken was cooking, stirred it, put it back in for 15 minutes, checked to make sure the chicken was cooked through, and then put sharp cheddar cheese on top and cooked another 15 minutes uncovered.  The only thing I will change next time is I will add more milk, as it came out a tad too dry.  The chicken was soft, tender and this dish was easy to prepare...plus there are so many ways to change it up a bit!

Over all a very quick and easy recipe. However, I do agree with others in regards to adding more liquid and decreasing cook time to one hour. When I make this again, I will try and "spice" it up a bit. Might toss in some green onions...or bacon bits and some cheddar cheese:) Yummy!

This is a very good recipe to play around with.  I added chopped celery and mushrooms for some color and flavor.  Also used dried parsley, fresh ground pepper, and some cumin.  I do agree to use twice the liquid.  It would be very hard to mess this up!  Very tasty!  We're still eating it three days later!  Yum!

I read the reviews before making this. I used one can of cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom. I added garlic powder, onion powder salt and pepper. I also used parsley flakes and paprika. when it was almost done topped with shredded cheddar cheese. I let it melt in the oven for 10 minutes. It turned out delicious. But you differently have to add flavors or it will be bland.

I created my version in the crockpot. I browned and seasoned the chicken first with season all. I used 1 & 1/4 cup of milk & 1/2 cup of chicken broth. In addition I tossed in some frozen broccoli. This is a great base recipe but a little bland. I topped it with French’s Fried Onions after it was done.

It turned out really well. It was just a little dryer than it should of been. The recipe can be tweaked a little and be really great.

This recipe was so simple to make. The family loved it. The only thing I recommend is not take the foil off to let it brown as it dried it out.

This was a tasty dish! But - I improvised a little with what I had on hand and added a few spices for personal taste preferences.  I used 1 can cream or chicken and one can of cream of mushroom.  Added some garlic powder, onion powder and a little thyme.  I was worried about putting raw chicken in this but it cooked perfectly.  Ultimately, this dish came out a little dry for my liking at only 60 minutes, but I think my oven runs hotter than what it’s set for.  Added a little more milk and mixed it in and let it cook for a few minutes more. Will make again but use more liquid in the beginning.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a good base. (It was bland for my taste.) Next time I will add onion, garlic, more salt, pepper, corn, carrots, and broccoli, and grated cheese sprinkled on top toward the end of cooking time.

The driest casserole I ever made will never make again. No one liked it, don't know how you make 2 cups of rice with only 2 cups of liquid.

This basic recipe gave me a good base as I always add and change things up. Instead of chicken breast I used chicken thighs because they tend to stay more juicy. I added broccoli and mushrooms because I love veggies. I substituted wild rice for the white rice due to less carbs. I’m pregnant and going to get my glucose test soon so working to reduce carbohydrates. Lastly I added soy sauce instead of regular salt which I often do for flavor.

May husband always likes it when I try new recipes.  This one was good.  I used one can of Cream of Chicken and one can of Cheddar Cheese soup.  (Actually that was an oops on my part, I thought I had grabbed 2 cans of Cream of Chicken from the pantry and didn't realize my mistake until the can was open.)  We also added salsa and sour cream on top after it was baked to give it more flavor.

I'm rating this based on my first run, AS-IS. Good but a bit plain. That's good for when you want something plain. 2nd time, I did the following: Rinsed the rice to clean off the starch, added 1/2 cup of finely diced celery, used cream of chicken and cream of celery soup, 1.5 cups of milk in addition to the two cans of soup. Frankly, I think ANY cream of - soup will be good.  Remember, this is halved. This cooked at 350 for the first 45 mins. in my oven, and 325 for the 2nd 45 minutes and it came out less gummy. Thanks for a tasty and easy recipe. So nice when all you feel like "cooking" is opening and mixing.

Loved it! I used a rice pilaf mix instead of white rice and season salt, so good. I also tried another reviewers suggetion with the onion soup mix, and while it tastes great, it is really salty lol will do this again!! Only took an hour, checked it at 30 minutes  and after another 20, then uncover last 10!

Great comfort food. I made this recipe as submitted. The only change I made was the addition of 1 c. frozen baby peas. Bland. Needed more salt and seasonings.  A very easy fix - next time I will try the suggestion of another reviewer to sprinkle it with dry onion soup mix.

Far too boring there's a better recipe with a crust topping that I am making right now. I added fresh broccoli and celery chopped fine to the base mixture along with seasonings.

I added flavor and it was a hit. Here's my version: I used 4 chicken breasts instead of 6. I added 2 (4 oz) cans diced green chili peppers, 1 can corn, half a block cream cheese, 2 eggs, 2 tsp Magic seasoning salt, generous ground black pepper, dash garlic and 1 small sweet onion (chopped). Topped with cheddar. Husband and daughter loved it.

I made this tonight with out the green pepper or salsa and I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead. It was delicious except it definitely needed more milk. I could tell at the 1 hr mark when I stirred it that it was drying out.  I might try making this with cauliflower rice too. Probably won't need to cook as long either. Thanks for sharing.

I made this but i did it a little (maybe a lot) differently.  I used tomato & basil seasoned chicken,  2 cans of cream of chicken soup with herbs and 1 can of  golden cream of mushroom soup. I also added grape tomatoes (cut in half), mushrooms, and broccoli, minced garlic, and a little onion powder.  The family loved it and we are making it again!!!

I changed this one a lot based on other reviews.  First, I added vegetables!  Yummy!  I added; one leek, sliced thinly, one stock celery, sliced, one green chili pepper, finely diced, one bunch green chard, shredded, stems chopped, five mushrooms, sliced, one small handful arugula, shredded.  I cooked all the veggies in a pan starting with the leeks and pepper until carmelized, remove, then the celery and chard stems, remove, then the mushrooms until just brown, add greens and deglaze pan with white wine.  Mix veggies with rice and sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, chipotle chili powder, black pepper.  Also added fresh oregano and thyme.  I reduced the liquid milk to 1 and 1/2 cups because of how much water vegetables give off when cooked.  I used regular short grain white rice and measured with an American standard measuring cup, you know, the metal ones?  Not the one that comes with your rice cooker, this is important, also wash the rice.  I only used one chicken breast, which I cut into strips and inserted into the rice.  I greased my glass baking dish with olive oil.  And added cheese with the foil off for the last 15 minutes.  This dish was tasty, and I will make again probably with a wild rice blend for greater flavor!

Basic recipe? Yes. Easy to make? Certainly. That is about all I liked about this recipe. Had to add more liquid midway for it was starting to dry up and rice wasn't even have way cooked through. I added a cup of water and a can of chicken broth. I also mixed with some mushrooms. The finished dish when complete was bland at best.

I followed this recipe for the basic cooking instructions but listened to reviewers and added my own seasonings. I did the seasoned salt from the recipe but added a tsp of pepper a tsp of oregano, a tsp of Italian seasoning and a sprinkling of cheese for the last 10 minutes of cooking. before I made this no one in my family looked thrilled when I told them dinner is a chicken and rice casserole. from the first bite my 12 year old raved my husband loved it and my 20 mth old was licking the bottom of his bowl and saying mmmm after every bite. this was easy to make and a no fail with the directions. just spice to your liking.

Not bad.  Even though I added 2 cups of chicken broth along with milk it still wasn't creamy enough.  I used Jasmine rice.  I think next time I'll cut the rice to 1 1/2 cups and hopefully it will be creamier.  I used a little garlic powder otherwise I followed the recipe.  Hubby really like it.

We made this twice to ensure we did not mess up the first time.  Looks and tastes like bad hospital cafeteria fare. Rice was mushy, yet somewhat crunchy.

We did not care for this recipe. I cooked this for over 2 hours, and the rice never completely cooked all the way. I am thinking the recipe should have called for instant rice, instead of regular white rice. This is also very bland as written. However, all the spices in the world could not have made up for the undercooked rice. This recipe needs quite a few adjustments in order to be edible.

Very bland. Needs more liquid and a lot more seasoning. Good base to start with.

Nothing wrong with this has great flavor when you use  your favorite spice.   Also taste great when cooking it on the stove top and following the same directions.   Brown the Chicken first then add the rest cuts down cooking time to 30 minutes.

The rice was undercooked. The chicken looked slimy. Everything was just salty and congealed.

Good Basic recipe, I made this for 13 people and adjusted everything up to 5 cups. All 6 kids liked it, was a tiny bit on the bland side for me but the Adults all said it was good. A little bit like glue but rice tends to get that way. I also added a bag of shredded cheese. All in all was an easy dinner to feed 4 generations of my family.

I used the above ingredients but added one can of vegetable broth,  onion, garlic,celery,grilled fresh mushrooms,salt,pepper,cumin  a little shredded cheese then  chips on top. I baked it 45 minutes and it was perfect.
   The chicken I used was shreaded chicken cooked in the slow cooker. Great recipe use one 24oz jar of salsa (I use Walmart salsa with corn and black beans) add one envelope of low sodium taco seasoning. Put 6 frozen or thawed chicken breast in a slow cooker cover with the salsa mix making sure all chicken is covered with salsa then cook on low for 4 to 5hrs (for frozen) I take the chicken out and shred it ,then save the salsa mix and use it for enchillidas. great too!

This recipe was great - quick & easy with NO leftovers!  I changed it up a bit by using 1 can of condensed cr. of mushroom and 1 can of condensed cr. of chicken.  I also added garlic pepper and a few other shakers from my spice cabinet.  Will make this one again!

good base recipe. Defiantly needed some added flavor. I added paprika, garlic, white pepper, and garlic powder. Also added a bag of frozen mixed veggies and topped with some breadcrumbs and shredded white cheddar cheese for those last 15 minutes. not bad. a good low maintenance meal.

Fairly good but definitely needs spice.  I used beer instead of milk, and added two cloves of garlic, half an onion, and sprinkled tarragon over the top.

I made this for my family of five for a quick and easy dinner.  I have three picky girls, 6,8,10 years old.  They all loved it!  They even helped to make it.  I read some of the reviews and worried it would be bland.  It was not.  It doesn't have a huge amount of layered flavors, which is why my kids liked it.  I wouldn't serve this to a dinner party but it's a perfect weeknight meal.  Thank You to the person who submitted.  It is not very often that I find something, quick/easy, items in the house, the kids will eat, and I feel good serving!  Five stars!  PS.  I used Morton's Season Salt, Season All.

It was very good and very easy.  I used long grain wild rice and the flavor packet that comes with the rice, and added some tomatos and peas and some spieces, and a little bit of tomato sauce, and a little more milk until the rice finally cooked. My husband loved it.

OMG!! love this recipe! just tried it out for dinner and it was great, and easy. i had the meat department at kroger cut the chicken into strips for me. i also used 3 cans of cream of mushroom instead of the cream of chicken. i also only cooked it for 90 min. just one tip if you decide to make this, don't forget to stir it every 30 min. =)

okay, so this was okay. Simple to throw together. I needed something to take to covered dish dinner @ church & didn't have a lot of time to fuss over a complicated dish & this certainly fit the bill. I suggest either decreasing the amount of rice a little or increasing the liquid. I found it a little dry - not creamy. So, I added a can of chicken broth at the end and continued cooking until that was absorbed & then rice was more tender. Also added some seasoning to the soup mixture to bump up the flavor - tyme, poultry seasoning & a little salt & pepper.

I always keep 2 cans of Cream of Chicken Soup in my pantry for nights when I just don't feel like cooking, so I can make this. The only changes I make to the recipe are to add some black pepper, thickly sliced zucchini, some mushrooms and 300ml of cream. Otherwise, it is a very tasty and very easy dinner option. Thanks for the recipe!!

I DEFINITELY should've added about 1 cup of water to the mixture (of which I used 1 cup cream of mushroom and 1 cup cream of chicken). By an hour the casserole was drying up, even though I had tried to add water after the first 1/2 hour; but the rice still wasn't fully cooked. Nonetheless, the casserole was still delicious, especially with the (frozen) peas and carrots I threw in with the rice. Next time I think I'll also throw in some chopped onions for extra flavor.

This was a very simple and tasty recipe.  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to add my own twist as I like a lot of flavor also.  I only used 1 1/4 cup milk and I used about 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I also seasoned my chicken with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and creole seasoning prior to adding it to the soup mixture.  I had to stir every 20 minutes to prevent sticking even though I greased my dish as instructed.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My casserole was a little salty and it dried out during the cooking process.  I think the next time I make it I'll reduce some of the seasonings and increase the milk/water ratio.

Very good base and has a lot of potential, but we felt like it was too dry so I would add a can of Cream of Celery and maybe 1/2 c. milk.  Also very bland, we added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and parsley which made it yummy.

Very good, basic recipe for Chicken and Rice.  Made it but added some goodies: green onions, sliced mushrooms, paprika, and some bread crumbs on the top.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Made this recipe for a request from my boyfriend.  We both agreed that it was very bland.  I would have enjoyed baked chicken with rice on the side better.  It is really missing something.

Too dry and no flavor. Would be better cooked in more liquid and add lots of things for flavor. Stick with this recipe and you have a big lump of hard, dry, flavorless rice. Sorry :(

I made this recipe almost exactly like it was written except I only cooked it one hour as some suggested and then sprinkled some cheese on top after I took it out of the oven.  Everyone in my family loved it.

This dish was really good right out of the oven. I followed the recipe exactly as i only review recipes when i do the exact recipe. The next day when eatting left overs it was very bland and the chicken tasted rubbery. If you are going to eat right out of the oven i definately recommend but if your making it for left overs.... i will not make it again.

Good.  I did add an onion soup mix pack, and without that I think the recipe would have been too bland.

i would actually give this 4.5 stars just because I had to make a few changes.  I did make a few changes.  I used a can cr. chicken soup, a can cr. onion soup, milk as directed, half cup water, and a package of dry onion soup mix.  Then I put the cut up chicken on top and put fresh ground pepper on top. then I gently pressed down the chicken to make sure that it had some of the liquid covering it.  I baked for directed time, but ten minutes before serving I crushed ritz crackers on top and but back in the oven.  It is not a pretty dish, but it did have a lot of flavor.  My family all loved it and will definitely make again.

Very good, very easy casserole.  I sprinkled a package of soup mix over the top before baking.  It added flavor.  I may try adding broccoli or mushrooms next time.  My kids ate it too!

We didn't have much left in the kitchen between paydays and this casserole was the perfect dish.  Everyone loved it and everybody got their tummy full!  I do suggest that you season to taste!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

this is a good basic recipe to flovor up.  I modified by browning onion and garlic with the cut up chicken before hand and then added 1/2 c sour cream to the soup which gave a little more moisture to the rice and added good flavor.

My family said that it was just ok, they thought the chicken was too dry. The rice had good flavor though and they liked that. I didn't change anything with the recipe, oh I did add a bit more seasoning salt but that is it. Not sure why it came out so dry?

I made the recipe as written basically and I agree it's too dry. HOWEVER, I thought the taste was Great and you certainly can't beat the ease of preparation! I added a few of the spices I like per other's suggestions. Next time I will add probably antoher cup of milk or water and a few cloves of minced fresh garlic - and go from there on any more adjustments. Except for adding some moisture, great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I browned my chicken first with onion and garlic salt to give it flavor.  I used 2 cups of rice and milk to 2 chicken breasts.  It only needed 1 hour to bake on 375.  Good.

I was really impressed by this recipe but mostly because my picker then most 6 year old raved over it and devoured his entire bowl in no time flat. i didn't water chestnuts so I subbed frozen mixed veggies. I didn't read the recipe closely and cooked the rice first and added cheese at the end. Like I said AWESOME!

My whole family really enjoyed this. My picky 15 year old even went back for seconds. I made this with brown rice and was worried that it wouldn't get done, so I allowed 90 minutes cook time. There was plenty of liquid and the rice was done perfectly and so was the chicken. I loved the idea of cutting up the chicken before putting it in!

As is, this recipe is bland.  I jazzed it up with lipton onion soup mix, sauteed mushrooms, and onions.  I added 1cream of mushroom, and 1 cream of chicken.  I added shredded cheddar during the last 15 minutes while uncovered.  It was pretty good.  Easy to make one dish meal.

This was really good! I did add ground pepper and when I baked it. Also I had fresh asparagus, so I placed it under the chicken (on top of rice). I thought this might be okay, but it turned out really good. Thanks fot the listing!

Yummy and easy. The rice turned out really fluffy and a nice flavor. I think I went higher on the season salt and used the Spicy season- all but other than that, just a nice dinner recipe, especially when feeding a bunch of teenagers. :-)

Before we put the chicken pieces in, we seasoned them with some lemon pepper. It came out tasting really good but cooking it that exta 15 minutes at the end really really dried mine out. Next time, I'll be leaving that part out.

This was just OK.  It was easy to make, but I would still say this was too much work for the end result.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was bland and the texture lacked any interest (although, it is chicken and rice, eh?).  I will admit my husband seemed to like it, but then, he prefers bland, boring food!  If I had to really describe it, I would say it tastes like I added chicken to a packaged seasoned rice mix.

I agree with other reviwers that it's nice to mix up the cream soups. Also, add a bit more seasoning! Mix it up with fresh or canned mushrooms or even sneak it chopped up brocolli for extra nutrients and color.

This recipe is a classic, in my opinion, and can easily be added to or kicked up a notch. It is a super recipe to have on your go-to list. We call this Sunday chicken, because it's great to stick in the oven before church - hot and ready to eat when you get home!

I made this for dinner to use up some extra chicken tenders. I thought it to be bland. Needs more flavor, maybe a can of tomatoes with pepers. I will note that there were NO leftovers.

Was easy and edible, but my family was definately not enthusiastic about eating this dish.  I had to force them to finish off the leftovers.  Mild was an understatement, bland would better describe this meal.  Will not make again.

Very easy to make.  Surprisingly, the rice was perfect. Delicious and simple !
Of course, I spiced it up to my liking.

Great tasting dish, but very dry if you follow the instructions.  I would add more milk next time I make this.

I'm in college and I really don't have a lot of time to cook. It was easy to make and I still had time to study. I took the advice of someone else and adde 1/2 cup extra milk. I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and I also added a little bit of chopped onion, Mrs. Dash seasoning on the chicken, and I used drumsticks (because I like drumsticks). It came out ok, but the leftovers are dry. I might consider making it again

If you are looking for something with flavor that bursts in your mouth, this is not it!  But if you need a simple, down home recipe then this is the one!  It was super easy and tasted great.  I used brown rice and added a little more milk towards the end when I took off the foil.

This was ok. My family ate it and said they would eat it again if I made it. I believe when I do I will leave out the salt - it ended up being too salty for us -and add some onion, garlic, and pepper to it.

To make this a little more interesting, but still simple, I made this with 2 cans each of crm of chicken, crm of mushroom, and crm of celery. 2 cups of water, 2 cups rice. I mix most of soup mixture (including water) with uncooked rice, salt and pepper chicken, lay on top of rice and pour remaining soup over top of chicken. bake @ 300 for 3 hours. this is one of our favorites!

This was really yummy.  I have an old recipe that I have been using and it had no flavor, this one is so good.  I took half of it a friends home who had a sick baby ( in hospital - no time to cook) and kept the other half for my family.  I thought I might not like it, but is is nice and mild for other people.  Well, we loved it and I will definitely make it again and again.

This was great for a quick no fuss meal.  It took no time out of a busy day.  I only had to cook mine for 60 minutes.  30 covered/30 uncovered and it could have been less.  I took advice from others and cut down on teh milk and in it's place put cr. of mushroom soup.  I am glad I did, I think all cream of chicken would have been too much. Good comfort food.

A very easy, fast dish for the whole family.  A little on the "dull" side as is, but just season to taste and you have a nice sit down meal.

i think the mistake everyone is making here is not soaking and rinsing the rice before adding it to the mix. i used brown and wild rice, one teaspoon of dried thyme, i pad of butter and added 1 cup and a half of fresh carrots. with the revisions, i thought this recipe produced good comfort food.

Good! It took a lot longer then 90 min. to cook. After about 2 hours I had to add more milk and then about a 1/2 an hour latter it was done. We were so hunger when it was done that I don't think we tasted it. But the leftovers were good!

Like the other reviews said this is a great base.  I used a large can of cream of mushroom as well as cream of chicken soup, only one cup of milk and 3 cups of rice...I have 5 people to feed!  The chicken fell off the bone, it was so tender.  I also added frozen broccoli, basil, rosemary, and garlic salt. Everyone loved it (that's amazing with three picky kids)!  Very good!!!

I made a few changes, I added a can of chicken and rice instead of rice, lipton onion mushroom soup mix, cream of mushroom soup, mixed together add your boneless chicken breast or use chicken strips for quicker cook time. A great winter time dish

I and my sister are both very picky eaters, in fact she hates rice, but with a few of the added suggestions by the others who rated this dish, it turned out perfect. Between four hungry college students the dish was gone and we all loved it (even my sister)! Thanks alot for a fantastic base even if a few adjustments had to be made.

I only made enough for 2 people but sitll used a whole can of cream of chicken.  I'm a fairly new cook and this recipe did not specify wether you should cook the chicken first or not.  I did and it turned out ok - I was very liberal with the seasoned salt, and added chili powder and garlic salt.  Not GREAT but not bad.

I agree with the previous reviewer who said this is a wonderful starting point.  My only change is to maybe add a bit more liquid such as milk or soup.  Consider this recipe a base and then go ahead and add some ingredients you really love like broccoli, red chili flake, garlic, shredded cheese (on top), or a packet of onion soup mix.  Get creative!

This is an excellent recipe. I reved it up by using onions and garlic powder,  salt and black pepper. I also used a whole chicken, and baked it in a roaster for more room. Excellent recipe for  a large family.

I think this recipe turned out well although I didnt use any milk. Instead I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and water. I also smoothered the chicken breasts w/ another 1/2 can of chicken soup so the chicken would be juicy. It turned out good.  Next time I think I'll try milk and the great thing about this recipe is that you can use lots of variations such as cream of mushroom, broccli cheddar soup, etc.

We loved this recipe.  I added minced garlic, cut up asparagas and portabella mushrooms.  Added more milk after the first half hour.  New family favorite!!!

Delicious, It is a dish that you have to be in the mood for. I used two cups of milk, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and a can of cream of chicken soup, then added brocolli. It turned out creamy and tasty! Reduce cook time to 60 minutes, ad dont forget to grease the pan!!

This recipe was easy to make, but it was very dry.  It has potential though.  I think next time I will check it and remove as soon as the chicken is completely cooked, (not rely on the 90 minutes it says to cook.)  I also think I might try adding some vegetables to give it a bit more flavor.  All in all it wasn't bad.  Great to make ahead and refrigerate so you can pop it in the oven when you get home.

I was looking for an easy, quick to make recipe.  This was it.  I added extras as previously mentioned including onions, garlic & hot sauce. I also recommend the extra liquid.  What a great base for a recipe to call "your own"!

This recipe was not as good as I thought it would be.  Very bland tasting.
