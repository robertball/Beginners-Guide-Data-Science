These are excellent and those were the first words out of my husbands mouth when he took his first bite too. Made this as written except that I used onion buns because they are our favorite. The recipe didn't specify to chop the mushrooms but I did so that they would be more fully incorporated. These are 5 star all the way! Thanks ChristineM!
