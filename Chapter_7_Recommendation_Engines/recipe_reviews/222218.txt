Excellant! I made a double batch for a picnic and none was left. I went a little lighter on the sugar and used half the milk and half the buttermilk called for and it was perfect! I also used a grater to grate the onion into the dressing so it would be distributed well. Very very pleased with this recipe. It was the ideal blend of snappy and sweet. Thank you Krissy.

Well Krissy, for "just an old family recipe" this sure is delicious and it does remind me of KFC's version! To cut back on the amount of chopping I did as others as well as the submitter suggested and bought a bag of coleslaw mix.  I also opted to lighten this up a bit by using Hellman's light mayo, reduced fat buttermilk, and 1% milk.  I poured everything into a large tupperware container and refrigerated for a few hours - definitely the longer the better!  Great side dish for bbq ribs!

Loved it.  Just like KFC.  I substituted 1-16 oz. bag coleslaw mix for the cabbage, carrots, & onion.  Didn't do any additional chopping.  Delish.

Delicious! I did not have buttermilk so I increased the milk to 1/2 cup and the vinegar to 1/4 cup. My son is a coleslaw lover but I've never been able to make a recipe that he liked until now!

To make it really KFC,I used my chopper,and ground the cabbage,carrot & onion into (Rice Size Pieces).That makes the KFC differance right there.Mix the vegtables completely in your bowl,before adding the mayo/milk mixture.If you don't have Buttermilk,mix a little white vinegar & milk together in a separate bowl. Let it sit for 5 min or so,till the milk kurdels(gets thick).I also add Celery Seed to mine.A couple shakes.Refrigerate,& mix just before serving.I make it in the morning, so it's ready for Lunch or Dinner.Great served on Sandwiches,Hot Dogs or Burgers also.

You're right...this is pretty dang close to KFC's coleslaw...which is the ONLY coleslaw that I truly like. I didn't chop up the bagged cabbage/carrot mixture because I don't mind it chunkier. Great recipe, I'll be using this as my go-to from now on!

So good....my kiddos loved it....used a pre-shredded slaw mix for ease....also used fine diced red onion (which my eldest noticed and loved), low fat mayo, omitted the milk, used low fat buttermilk and used 3 packets of Truvia sugar substitute instead of the sugar and it was way sweet enough. Also used fresh lemon juice which I think it way better than any bottled, salt and fresh cracked pepper. Made this in the morning and served tonight....NO LEFTOVERS!!!! Family inhaled. Thanks!

This was a great, standard coleslaw recipe.  I added only half the sugar and still thought it was pretty sweet.  Next time I might try it without the sugar and see if I think it needs it.

Good recipe, consider using Stevia instead of sugar, makes it diabetic friendly.  Follow directions for Stevia, is sweeter than sugar.

GOOD, BUT NEEDED HELP. INSTEAD OF WHISKING, PUT ALL IN A SHAKER JAR. (WORKS FASTER AND BETTER.)  TO MAKE THIS HEALTHIER AND SNAPPIER, USE RICE OR CIDER VINEGAR.  (DISTILLED VINEGAR IS UNHEALTHY.....BUT GOOD FOR CLEANING!) BLACK PEPPER IS ALSO TOXIC TO THE BODY. (Reference material...'Back to Eden' by Jethro Kloss.) USE CAYENNE INSTEAD WHICH HAS NUMEROUS HEALTH BENEFITS.  ADJUST THE HEAT TO TASTE. ALSO USED FRUCTOSE IN PLACE OF UNREFINED SUGAR. ALSO ADDED CELERY SEED AND CHOPPED ONION.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE./ arnetage68

Eating a delicious bowl as I review! This recipe is sweet yet tangy. I replaced the buttermilk with a tablespoon of sour cream and only used a quarter of the sugar and it turned out delicious! I will definitely be using this recipe over and over again!

Awesome slaw!!! The first batch went according to the recipe and it was a bit lemony so I reduced the lemon by half in the second batch and it was great. The third batch I added a third tablespoon of vinegar and it reached the awesome level. I also used the pre-shredded cabbage/carrot mixture sold at the local store and just chopped it a bit finer. It went fast but if it lasts into the next day its even better after the flavors have mingled a bit more.

Took to a family gathering. I also used the prepackaged cole slaw mixture and chopped it in food processor. I doubled the receipe except for the sugar. I also used red wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. It turned out great. Just the right amount of sweetness. Will make this again. Nothing left but the bowl.

Cure for watery coleslaw. I suggest combing cabbage and carrots that have been shredded with 1 tsp of salt. Mix then set over a strainer for 1 hour to get the water that's in carrots and cabbage out. Rinse to get the salt off then dry well.

I made exactly as the recipe stated and this recipe was just a little too sweet for us.  I also thought the dressing was a little too thin.   I will try this again because I thought the flavor profile was good, just too sweet.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar and omit the milk.  I think it will be thin enough for my taste using just the buttermilk.  If you like a sweet coleslaw though, this is the recipe for you!

This ole slaw is great. I have been searching forever for a coleslaw dressing. This is all I need now. The only change I made is adding celery seed. Thanks.

This is the best, I served it at a dinner party with 34 people in attendance and everyone loved this recipe - I used presliced bags of coleslaw and did not do any additional chopping and people still thought this was the best coleslaw ever!

Definitely grate your carrots and onion.  Also added some Louisiana hot sauce, ditched the milk.  I like my dressing to stick to my cabbage.  Very good recipe, something I'd been pretty much using all my life.  :)

Did not care for this at all. There was nothing creamy about this. I followed the recipe (almost)to a T, with one omission and one minor sub, after mixing the mayo and buttermilk together, it looked very liquidy, so I left out the 1/4 cup regular milk and I subbed onion powder for the raw onion(personal preference). At this point I was hesitant, but I decided to go on. I should have listened to myself. When I added the dressing to the cabbage, it just dripped to the bottom of the bowl. Even after several mixings, over several hours, none of the dressing clung to the cabbage. But honestly, the dressing didn't taste that good anyways. I even added celery seed, hoping to salvage the taste...nope. The only reason I give this 2 stars instead of one, is because I was able to easily wash off this off putting dressing and add my own. I will use my tried and true recipe for slaw dressing(mayo, sugar, celery seed and vinegar...it's that easy)from now on, just wanted to try something new and wanted to use up a small amount of buttermilk left over from making Irish Soda Bread. Sorry, will not make again

Excellent,  Excellent.  I've never made coleslaw before.  I decided to try my hand at it to accompany pulled pork sandwiches.   I loved this dressing!   I also reduced the sugar dramatically after reading the reviews.  - I added the sugar at the end,  a little bit at a time until it was to my liking -  (2 Tablespoons was more than enough for me.)
I ended up testing out the shredding/slicing attachments on my food processor.  Once I figured it out :) I had a huge bowl of cabbage,  red cabbage,  carrots and red onion in under a minute! 

The advantage is that you can adjust to taste..  I used a full 1/2 red onion and 4 carrots.   Had lots of fun!!   I will use this recipe again.

This is definately a keeper.

My husband and I LOVED this coleslaw. Went with the premade bag of cabbage/carrots at the store, and cut back on the sugar like others recommended. Will definitely make again, maybe a double batch next time!

This is definately a keeper! As I live in Norway where buttermilk is not really available i tried doubling the milk instead, but it tasted right as I added the lemon and the vinegar. Served it with spareribs and family raved and gobbled all up.

I used sour cream, instead of buttermilk, and seasoned rice wine vinegar, and added celery seed.
Very good recipe.

Excellent!  Used half and half for the milk, 2 Tbs. of sour cream for the buttermilk, cut sugar to 1/4 c. and added 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Perfect amount of dressing for a bag of coleslaw.  Super easy.

If you like KFC coleslaw you will love this one.  I used packaged coleslaw w/carrots to make this and chopped slaw into small bits to mimic KFC's and I am glad I made the effort.  Somehow it does make a difference.  I followed ingredients exactly.  I did have to make my own buttermilk out of milk and vinegar. (Put 1 1/8 tsp of white vinegar or fresh lemon juice in measuring cup, add enough milk to measure 1/4 cup - let sit 15 min. - this is Emiril Lagasse's recipe).   I am making a different coleslaw tonight and my guy is asking me to change my mind and make this again.  Will keep this one at the TOP of the rotation list though.  Thanks submitter.

Best coleslaw I have ever tried.  Has a nice not to sweet not to sour taste. I even make my own buttermilk using a one cup of regular milk to one tablespoon of cider vinegar. Let it sit for a while and you have buttermilk. I tried mine and store bought and can not tell any difference. Saves from wasting buying a whole pint for just a 1/4 cup.

Yummy!  I am ecstatic to find a recipe for the kind of slaw dressing we love!  I have tried a number of slaw recipes, and I'm finished searching now.  This has just the right combination of tanginess and sweetness.  I saved time on chopping by using preshredded cabbage and carrots.  Two minor adjustments: I skipped the onion due to sensitivities in my household, and I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.

It makes a LOT so I cut the recipe in 1/2. I've made this recipe quite a few times. This time I only had 1/2 purple cabbage and no milk products. I omitted the milk products and I like it even better.

I made it and absolutely loved it. I used all whole milk instead of the buttermilk, and used Sweet and low packets instead of the white sugar.
I made a double batch. I used 1 green and 1 purple cabbage. It was soo good.

This was delicious!   As close to KFC as we have ever had.   My family all commented on how good it was.  This is now my new coleslaw recipe!!
I doubled the dressing recipe and used 2 bags of shredded cabbage mix.  Made enough for family of 9 plus a little left over.  I made this early in the morning and served it in the evening.  Stirred a few times throughout the day to blend flavors. Perfect!!

I misplaced my go to cole slaw recipe and saw this one which seemed close. I made this one and at dinner my wife said exactly what I was thinking: "This is the best cole slaw you have ever made!" It is indeed better than my previous recipe and is now my new go to cole slaw. My only change was using some red onion that I had use up. Delicious!

I really liked this coleslaw, and I don't like coleslaw! I think it turned out wonderful, but the second time around I also reduced the sugar to 1/8 cup, and reduced the lemon juice to 1 TBSP. The next thing I might try to adjust would be the dressing. It seems to get too watery once the cabbage is added. I may try adding 1/4-1/2 tsp of xanthan gum to the dressing before mixing it in with the veggies. Also, I'm an onion lover, so I used twice to three times the onion on the second go-round, and it was STILL great!

This coleslaw was the bomb!! It really does taste like KFC's coleslaw. I changed the recipe because I didn't have buttermilk so I just added some vinegar to another 1/4 of milk. Perfect..... :)

Excellent recipe.  I halved it and followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  Indeed very close to KFC, which I love.  Not to mayonaisy, so it tasted nice and light. Will definitely be making this again soon.

Really good recipe but I thought it was missing something because it tasted a little too "mayo-ish" and I figured out what it's missing: CELERY SALT!  Add that to this recipe, and it will be 5 stars. I aded a little dill, a tad more lemon juice and buttermilk as well.  I cut down on the sugar also. Really good!  Thank you for sharing :)

Really enjoyed this.  Made it using bagged coleslaw mix, no additional chopping, and used stevia in place of the sugar.  Turned out very good.

This was a bit hit at the birthday party. Next time I'll use less milk and more acid, and add some sunflower seeds for crunch. Great base recipe!

Awesome.  My French son-in-law doesn't like coleslaw, but I didn't know that and gave him about 3 cups of it with some pulled-pork.  To be polite, he tried it, then ate the entire amount that night!

Like other reviewers, I reduced the sugar.  Used 2 TB of sugar and substituted lime for lemon juice. Didn't have lemon juice handy. Was great! Rated this four stars, instead of five, because a full 1/3 cup of sugar would have made it too sweet.  2 TB was just right.

I really like coleslaw and I must say this is the best. The only thing I changed is I only use 2 tablespoons of sugar, and a pinch of celery seeds and a few dried cranberries great recipe, thank you.

Loved this recipe! I was looking for a good southern mayo slaw and found it! I didn't add onion because my family doesn't like the raw onion flavor and no buttermilk because I didn't have any on hand. Still just used 1/4 cup milk (no extra to sub for buttermilk) and it turned out perfect!

Pretty tasty! It ends up a little soupier than I prefer but the flavor is great. Be sure to give it a few hours in the fridge to let the cabbage sop up the liquid.

I omitted the 1/4 c regular milk because it was def soupy enough. I made this with Apple Cider Vinegar which made it too sweet.  Next time I might just do the same but with a lot less sugar.  Made it for my husband who is picky and he loved it as did my mother in law!  Wonderful recipe.  I will make this again.   I made it with southern pulled Pork and I was the talk of the meal!

Thank you Krissy!  We absolutely love this.  I often have cole slaw that isn't quite so enjoyable but then there are others that I just love and can't get enough of...this definitely falls in the latter category.  Yum!

Very tasty - as others mentioned it tastes just like KFC slaw. It pairs great with grilled chicken.

Exceptional flavor! Definitely reminds you of KFC's coleslaw. I made it almost exactly like the recipe, only omitted the onions and added a dab of Worcestershire sauce cause, well, I can (and I love it)! If you don't have buttermilk, using another member's recipe, simply add 1 tablespoon vinegar to 1 cup of milk, let it sit about 5 minutes and there you go! I made this the first time for a gathering and was requested to make it again for another one! I loved the sweetness so had no problem with the amount of sugar. Perfect!

My go-to slaw recipe.  My daughter is dairy free.  I use coconut or almond milk instead of buttermilk and milk, and it's just fine.  A very flexible recipe. Sometimes I add sweet peppers or kohlrabi.

Just finished making this and it is wonderful. it is pretty darn close to KFC's. I didn't have buttermilk so just used 1/2 cup milk. Next I make this I will buy  buttermilk just to see if it makes that big of difference.

Excellent! Only change in dressing was that I omitted regular milk as I thought it was thin enough after adding in the buttermilk. Just used packaged Cole slaw and shredded red cabbage .

I find mixing in the finely chopped red onion with the dressing helps blend flavors better. I prefer unsweetened rice vinegar in the dressing. Freshly ground tellicherry  black peppercorns provide a nice bite to the dressing, feel free to use more. I usually double the buttermilk, skip milk.Also once I was out of fresh lemons and had a jar of morrocon style salted preserved Meyer  lemons. With 2 quarters use a spoon to pull out the super salty fruit portion and discard. Then the rind is rinsed, diced super fine and wisked into the dressing. If I’m using a whole cabbage it’s sliced in cuisinart at 2.5 mm. The carrots are shredded with coarse cuisinart shredding blade, I use 3. The dressing is poured over the cabbage and carrots in a LARGE bowl. I find clean heads are the best way to incorporate dressing  uniformly and mix all ingredients quickly,  use gloves if your a germ phobe.  The cabbage sweats quite a bit so don’t panic if it seems dry initially. It will pack nicely into a large rubbermaid container. Refrigerate for several hours, and invert the sealed container 2 or 3 times before serving. You can be done with this in 30 minutes or less, dwell time 2-4 hrs. I’ve used this in 4-6 hrs, overnight fine, great for 5-7 days refrigerated. It’s awesome, WAY better than store bought and it’ll cost less than $8 to make a large quantity of quality product that will serve at least 10 with seconds( expected). No brainer for sure.

I just used the bagged slaw mix. And the second time around cut back on the milk and buttermilk. The salt and sugar draws water out of the vegetables and it gets too runny quick. Outside of that, perfect!

I just got done making this and the flavor is AMAZING and it hasn't even set for the recommended 2 hours yet.  Also I did substitute red onion for the yellow/white onion for more color.

I'm normally not a fan of coleslaw, but decided to make some as the super market was out of pre-made kind. Super easy and delicious.  Went great on pull pork sandwiches.

Very good slaw. My husband's first comment was, "Tastes like KFC." The next was, "Can we have slaw dogs tomorrow?" I chopped fresh cabbage, then as someone suggested, ran it through my mini-processor with carrots. The fine texture definitely added to the flavor.

Very easy to make. I didn't have buttermilk, so simply doubled the regular milk and used Miracle Whip instead of regular mayo. It was a bit sweet so I will reduce the sugar to a quarter cup next time. A keeper !

I cut the recipe in quarters. I did add bit of celery seed but that addition didn't alter much. This was a mild flavored slaw, went well on the pulled pork sandwiches. I'm glad I tried it vs the bottled coleslaw dressing.

I've made this coleslaw a few times and each time it's a winner. Last time out I used Bragg's apple cider vinegar and a little less sugar (1/4 c) along with just buttermilk (I had no milk on hand) and it proves this recipe is truly forgiving. Taste wonderful. It's a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

After trying every brand of dressing at the store I finally decided to give this a try...instant success! My whole family loves it. The only change, I have a son who refuses to eat onion so I added 1/8 teaspoon onion powder and left out the “actual” onions.

This was a lot of effort for an Extremely Bland coleslaw.  Doesn't taste anything like KFC.  I have no idea how this recipe got 5 stars, but certainly will not make it again.

A whole head of cabbage is a LOT of cabbage when you grate it yourself, I find that this is probably 16 servings. I halve the sugar and still find the dressing tangy and sweet. Otherwise love this recipe!

Vey good recipe.  Great flavor.  Definitely a 'go to'.  I don't give 5 stars out to a recipe if changes were made.  Just added a couple spoons of sour cream to thicken it up.   Little bit of celery seed also.  Tip....do not add salt until served.  It draws moisture out of the cabbage and waters down the dressing.

I made this the way it was written the first time around except that I made it with low fat mayo. It was excellent! So I played with it the next time because I wanted something with an Asian like flair to serve on Korean style pulled pork sammies. I added 1/4 tsp ground ginger and a 1/2 tsp sesame oil plus 1 Tbsp of toasted sesame seeds and a tsp of soy sauce. I replaced the white vinegar with rice wine vinegar. Loved it both ways. It's a dish of Delish! Thanks for posting the recipe!

I made it pretty much the way it was written. I did cut the sugar in half and it was just right for us.

It's my official coleslaw recipe now. I reduced sugar slightly, and added a dollop of sour cream. By the next day, it's fabulous.

Made it two or three times. One time did not have buttermilk, so used Ranch dressing as a substitute and it was real good, another time instead of mayo, a little more buttermilk and some olive oil, again, very good. I don't always have all ingredients on hand, but the basics are here, and it is always good!

My Nana never made coleslaw this good. I used to rate all coleslaw against the slaw at Morrison’s Cafeteria. It was great. Unfortunately they are no longer in business in my area. However, this slaw is just as good, maybe even a little better. I have made it several times now and find my family likes it best without the onions. Sure glad Nana passed the recipe along.

The flavour was excellent (I did add 1/8 tsp of celery seed) and I used bagged coleslaw. 

However, the salad became very runny and "saucy" once everything was mixed together and allowed to sit, but this was likely because there was too much dressing. Use sparingly!

Next time, I will use only 1/4 the recipe for one bag of coleslaw and adjust as needed.

Wow! Before it had a chance to sit in the refrigerator a couple of hours, it was the best slaw I've ever tasted! I made my own buttermilk, used fresh squeezed lemon juice and slaw. If how it started before chilling is any indication, I may just pass out the next bite!!!

Delicious! I had to make little changes due to what I had available. I used a package of coleslaw mix instead, and didn't have buttermilk or almonds. Used the juice of a whole lime (about 3 Tbsp), and 5 Tbsp of sugar. The rest of the ingredients i followed as listed in recipe. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing it!

Made this for neighborhood 4th of July party we attend and it was a big hit.  I saved time buying the chopped cabbage -  carrot combo bag.  Next time I will chop that a little finer my preference but the flavor was delicious and got rave reviews from those whom are coleslaw fans.  I will definitely be making again.

Excellent. Use Green onions instead of cooking onions and 1 cup each butter milk and milk instead of 1/2 cup each. I used Creamy cashew milk instead of the milk and also the cashew milk with 1tbsp of lemon juice instead of the butter milk. Maybe that is why I needed more than what the recipe called for but it turned out well and it's true it does taste very close to KFC coleslaw.

I was skeptical as I've never made coleslaw before. I used to watch my mom make it homemade but that was one of the recipes I never paid much attention to. Took it to a party yesterday and it was fantastic. It got great reviews!!!! I used minced onion instead of fresh ones because we are not an onion family as well as using low fat buttermilk, 2% milk and low fat mayonnaise. This did not compromise the flavor one bit!!! This  will become my go to recipe going forward!! No more  taking restaurant Cole slaw to parities for me!

I made a few changes to make it a little more healthier and vegan friendly.  Substituted unsweetened almond milk for the milks, used Hellmann's vegan mayo, a sugar substitute and used 1/2 the coleslaw and added a broccoli slaw that my grocery store sells.  It tasted great!  Believe me, I'm not the vegan and I would have never known the changes.

Did not expect this would taste that good, but GOoood it is.
The longer it sets, the better.  Try it, you won't be sorry. The only change was I used Rice Vinegar since I didn't have distilled.  I believe this may have made the difference.

I'm pretty picky with my coleslaw and this was so good. I used Splenda instead of sugar to make it diabetic friendly and it's a winner with my husband. I used bagged coleslaw and found that I had to cut the recipe in half because it was too "soupy". This recipe is a keeper for sure.

This is my go to recipe for Coleslaw.  I did omit the milk since I don't keep that in the house.  I am making it  again today for the Barbecue at our local homeless shelter.  It is great with Pulled Pork.  I use the bagged cabbage mix and don't chop it any further.

Love this, I used Splenda instead of sugar and it turned out just as good. Also I used a little more Mayo and buttermilk because we like it more creamy. Everyone that has tasted it say they love it and it is much better than KFC's.

Made this last night just to try a different slaw than I usually make.  We loved it - even my picky, picky husband liked it.

A full head of cabbage was too much for me to easily handle and for the dressing to coat fully. Half a head works fine.

I also increased the amount of carrots. 2 is fine, but 3 gets more healthy carrot into the dish.

I've made this recipe twice. This is my new go to coleslaw recipe I love it. I eliminated the buttermilk and just used milk. It still tastes just like the restaurant version.

Awsome recipe!  Halved ingredients as was making for 4 people.  It surprisingly DOES taste  a little like KFC coleslaw.  I used Keefer instead of buttermilk and no regular milk and slightly less sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Followed the recipe and enjoyed it very much. Needed a bit more salt and I think next time I will add some celery seed and use  about half the sugar.

I had to alter it a bit,  using almond milk and omitting the buttermilk.   I added a bit more mayo so it wouldn't be too runny.   I also added some finely chopped kale and pumpkin seeds.

I have never liked cole slaw.  When my husband was prepared to spend $10 on tiny dishes of cole slaw and potato salad, I knew it was time to find a recipe he might like.  I made this, with  reducing sugar to 1/4 cup, and making buttermilk by adding 1 tsp vinegar  to 1/2 cup milk,in addition to the 2 tbsp in the recipe.  My kids and husband loved it, so I ate some, and actually kind of liked it, so I will keep this recipe for sure.

This is a good, standard coleslaw that everyone should enjoy.  The only change I made was to use green onions instead of regular onions just for color.

This is a great recipe. I added a little more vinegar, I used apple cider  vinegar and added about 2 tablespoons of horseradish. That really made it taste like KFC. I will make this again and again.

Probably the best homemade coleslaw you can make.  It is a little runny but other than that it is the only coleslaw i will eat.

Use 3.5T brown sugar and milk plus 2T cider vinegar to sub buttermilk. Toss the dressing wth a 16oz bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix 2 hrs before serving. Drain the extra liquid right before serving. Excellent coleslaw. Both my husband and I liked it. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Made it EXACTLY as written and it is wonderful! Correctly stated that is really does taste like the Colonel's (if my memory serves me correctly, it has been a long time since I've eaten at KFC.) This is a keeper I will be sure to make again. Oh, forgot to mention this is my first go at making coleslaw. So easy and delicious!   Can't believe I've been missing out for so long!

Yum!! Perfect for my BBQ pulled pork sandwiches. Added ground mustard seed, garlic powder, paprika, dill, lemon pepper, used white wine vinegar, reduced sugar to 1/8 cup. Didn't have buttermilk...used sour cream and half n half with extra lemon.

I love this recipe! I did make a few changes. I used honey instead of sugar and halved it. I also did half unfiltered vinegar and half apple cider vinegar (I added a bit extra than the recipe suggested). I also added some celery seeds.

Kept recipe the same except for I went the easier route and use a bag of of slaw mix instead of cutting up everything separately (too time consuming).  Chopped it all up pretty good and it turned out great!!

I have never been a big coleslaw person, but something was telling me to make it with pulled pork this week. So... I did! This recipe was absolutely delicious!!! I used scallions for the onions. and a couple days later I got even more daring and added raisins as suggested. I was very pleasantly surprised at how yummy this was. I definitely recommend trying this recipe.

I used apple cider vinegar only because I didn't have distilled white and it was delicious!

I did make changes, but only because I had to use what I had on hand, I think it would still be excellent made as written.  I used half heavy whipping cream and half water instead of milk, half red cabbage and half green, half apple cider vinegar and half distilled white.  All the kids loved it.  I sent the carrots, onions, and cabbage through the shredder attachment on the food processor so it was very easy.

Krissy, this is just delicious.  I didn't have "at least" 2 hours, more like 30 minutes and it was still delicious.  I'm looking forward to how good the left over tastes tomorrow!

This is my favorite coleslaw recipe.  Great with a southern barbecue!

I've made this dozens of times with rave reviews. But this weekend I hosted my father-in-law for the weekend for the real test. He's not a fan of coleslaw or anything wit her cabbage (ironic since he's Irish). He had a small first serving, then a huge second. Enough said.

Great coleslaw.  I only gave it 4 stars as the amount of sugar suggested is way too much in my opinion.  So I did cut down on the sugar and I added celery SEED not salt. Delish!

since using this salad with chicken or meat as a main dish, I would use soy milk instead of buttermilk and regular milk to keep it kosher.

I pretty much use recipes for core concepts, read all the comments, then alter it to my tastes and ingredients "at-hand".  I like my modifications with this recipe and wanted to share.  
- Mixed liquid before adding the cabbage "coleslaw" mix 
- made 1/4c buttermilk from powder (Saco)
- grated the onion into liquid
- increased mayo to 1 cup, no milk at all
- decreased lemon, just seasoned to taste, with salt/pepper
- 1/2 packet of Stevia, + 2 Tbs vinegar.  
 I like my coleslaw a bit wilted and dry, so I started in the morning, kept stirring and adding cabbage mix (2,16oz pkgs) thru the day, and served a tasty slaw for evening. 
Thanks all for sharing!!

Didn't have buttermilk, so substituted plain, organic yogurt. We loved the subtle flavor difference and it was wonderful with BBQ. Great recipe to begin with, and thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!! I did not realize until I got home that the recipe called for buttermilk so I substituted with milk and used less liquid. I LOVE lemon but felt like the lemon was a little too much, however without buttermilk, it's hard to say if it would have better presented with it in it. I do think it's a little too much sugar and I added more salt and pepper to my liking. Still a delicious recipe!!

We loved this recipe! I did add the celery seed and a tablespoon of pickle relish(our preference) but next time I will omit the regular milk (we like ours a little creamier). But over all, great recipe. Thanks

I'm giving the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 only because I started with 1/4 cup sugar and that is still a little too sweet for me.  I used plain greek yogurt instead of buttermilk.  I used 16 ounces freshly cut cabbage.  Thanks for the recipe! Will use from now on.

I'm not a big fan of this. Just ok. I really don't think it tastes anything like KFC coleslaw either. Note: I did use a bag of shredded cabbages and carrots.

I don't like coleslaw but every time I make this it is instantly gone! I don't put real buttermilk in to mine instead I mix 2 tablespoons of vinegar in milk and don't add the extra vinegar the recipe calls for. This recipe is a hit at my house!

Made my first coleslaw ever. It's pretty good. I don't like raw onions, so I switched in garlic, which I can't recommend. I won't make the same mistake next time. Also, I would add a little less liquid. I did follow the other suggestions to decrease the sugar a little and that was good.

I made this to take to a Thanksgiving potluck dinner. While it wasn't the most exciting dish on the buffet, a few people said they liked it. I brought some home. It really does taste a lot like KFC.

It seemed "soupy" after 2 hours in the fridge, so I added about 1/2 bag more of the bagged cabbage mix. It had the right amount of crunch. My bags might have been smaller that other reviewers'. 

I didn't chop the cabbage mix; I used 1/4 c. of sugar; subbed 2 heaping Tbsp. of sour cream for the buttermilk; and used seasoned rice wine vinegar, thanks to other reviews. Will make it again.

Best coleslaw recipe ever! I used a food processor for cabbage and grated the carrots. Omitted the onion b/c my husband does not like raw onion. Served with chicken and dumplings. I saved 1 cup of the cabbage after it was grated and stirred it in right before serving. This took care of the extra liquid and everybody loved it.

SO. SO. GOOD!  The buttermilk is the key.  I used red wine vinegar, because it is what I had on hand, and it was fabulous.  Finally, the perfect slaw dressing!

This is great. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it has too much liquid and sugar for me. I should also say that this is very similar to the Restaurant Style recipe(s) I've been making except the type of vinegar and the ratio of vinegar/lemon juice. I used the optional bag of shredded coleslaw mix, left out the 1/4 C regular milk, and only used 3 Tbl sugar. I still had a small amount of liquid in the bottom of the bowl but just the right amount to mix back in and keep it creamy. Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

This was so delicious, and I've tried several recipes for coleslaw 'like kfc'.  The use of lemon juice and buttermilk made for less vinegar needed and the amount of mayo was great.  We didn't refrigerate it and it was so tasty, but did accumulate more liquid than other recipes after an hour.  I imagine you could avoid that by refrigerating it as the recipe calls for.  We loved it!

I was looking for a good coleslaw recipe that I could modify somewhat since I live in Costa Rica, in a small town in the middle of the rainforest, and some ingredients are very hard to find and/or hard to keep on hand.  So here are my modifications (for 1/2 recipe):  used 1 generous Tablespoon of yogurt instead of milk and buttermilk, added no sugar, used the juice of 1 small lemon and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, had to add a bit more mayo.  Also added a bit of garlic and more (fresh ground) pepper than called for (I like it spicy).  I divided the result into 2 portions.  One I left "plain" and other I added fresh pineapple cut into bits and raisins (sort of "sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't" options).  HAD to taste them before I refrigerated - YUM!  I love recipes that can stand alone OR be modified!  Only gave it a '4' since I had to substitute  but mine were definitely a '5' in taste - both of them!

Hands down the best coleslaw I have ever had....100 times better than KFC! I've made this several times now, and I never have buttermilk so I use 1/3 cup milk only, then add celery seeds also....aside from that it's perfect as written! I think I eat at least half before it makes it to mealtime, everyone who has tried it raves! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

Tasty recipe.  I like to cut my veggies a little thick for more texture and crunch.  The taste doesn't really change though.  I eliminated the milk products, vinegar, salt and lemon juice and instead substituted a cup of pickle juice from a homemade pickle recipe. Turned out to be the bomb.

Exdellent and yes, it does taste like KFC's slaw.  Definitely will be my "go to" coleslaw recipe.  I used a large bag of coleslaw mix for the cabbage, carrots and onion due to time restraints. Didn't change anything else.

I made this with 1/2 cup of skim milk since its all i had in the house. The rest of the recipe I followed exact. I'm sure it would taste even better with whole & buttermilk, but even with the skim its a phanominal dish! I'll make this again & again!

I'm not usually a fan for cole slaw since I've eaten it on a grilled hotdog. My guy and I decided to grill up some links and top it with this homemade cole slaw and it is absolutely amazing! Instead of milk I used half-half (because I was out of milk) and it actually have it a nice creamy consistency. I used a little over 1/4 of a cup of sugar because I thought the 2 tablespoons of vinegar I put it was over barren. the extra dash of sugar changed that taste very quickly. I will be hanging onto this recipe. Bon Apetit!!!!!!
