These were pretty good. The coffee flavor was strong, which I like, but if you want a milder mocha taste, I'd cut back on the coffee a bit.
I don't use microwaves, so I melted this in my double boiler over a low simmer. I didn't like the idea of mixing plain water into my melted chocolate, so I dissolved the coffee granules in the water, then whisked it into the chocolate. These set up well and tasted great.

I followed the advice of another review and add only half the amount of coffee and it was amazing...however the coffee I used was a bold strong roast so it still added the flavor. I also chocolate dipped half of mine and powdered sugared the other half and they were soooo good. Very rich so one really does the job of satisfying the sweet tooth.

These are really easy to make but you need to keep them pretty small as they are too rich to eat more than a bite or two. I coated mine in white chocolate and then rolled them in crushed pistachios. They looked pretty bad but Iâ€™ve never had much luck with the whole melted chocolate thing. Anyway, tried my best, looked awful, tasted great.

Made these twice for the Christmas holidays.  I used white melted chocolate chips for the coating both times. Have to be very careful when melting  white choc.  because it seizes. Shared the recipe with five other people.  The whole recipe makes about 70 pieces. I think any kind of chips can be used to coat the candy and next time would like to try butterscotch or peanut butter chips.  One word to describe them....YUM!
