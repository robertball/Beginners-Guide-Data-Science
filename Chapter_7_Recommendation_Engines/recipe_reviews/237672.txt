The bacon never crisps up because its sitting under the soup mixture Had a nice bacony flavor.  Suggestion:  Maybe wrap the breast with the bacon and place it in the oven to cook for 25 minutes or so until the bacon can crisp up and then add the soup mixture?

I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery mixed with half a cup of sour cream to keep the sauce thicker.

This turned out so good! I wrapped my chicken breasts in slices of bacon. then seasoned it with Cavender's All Purpouse Greek seasoning. Topped with frozed mushrooms. I love mushrooms so I used a decent amount.
For the "mix" on top, I used and mixed: 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup sour cram, 1 can cream of mushroom, and I spinkled in (maybe a teaspoon or more of each) garlic power  and onion powder. Poured the mix on top.
Oven 375 (my chicken was a bit frozen still), covered with foil for 30 minutes, cooked 30 more minutes without foil.
Perfect!

I made this recipe but  made several changes.  I cooked the bacon first, not crispy, then browned the chicken, cut into strips.  I used Cream of Chicken soup, Mostly fat free.  Then replaced mushrooms with Zucchini slices.

I cut the Bacon into pieces and mixed with the chicken.  Pored the Cream of Chicken soup, mixed with a little milk over the Bacon Chicken.  Mixed in the Zucchini, and baked at 350 for 35 minutes.  Covered for another 10 minutes.  It was really good. Even if was different than the original.

Super easy and few ingredients. Tasted very nice. Probably not the healthiest way to make chicken.
