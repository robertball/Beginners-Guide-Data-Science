Absolutely hands-down the greatest glaze I’ve ever made! I think the difference is in using the corn syrup. I’ve tried making this recipe using both milk and water as I’ve made this glaze many times already… I definitely have found that the makes it taste much better. As some of the other reviewers found, using the milk DOES make the finish somewhat matte, but it still looks great and tastes even better with milk. It works wonderful with food coloring too. I put this glaze on the “Best Rolled Sugar Cookies” from this site and WOW, what a combo!!! People go nuts when they try these cookies. Just dip the cookie face-down in this glaze and twist, place on a piece of waxed paper and let sit for a couple hours. Make another bowl of this glaze in a contrasting color, take a spoon and drizzle it over the cookie for a neat effect too. Dries nice and hard! GREAT RECIPE! I’ve used it time and time again!!

Like other reviewers said, this glaze needs a bit of a flavor boost. I added several drops of almond extract, and it tastes wonderful! You can make it thicker by adding extra powdered sugar or thinner by adding water, so it's a very easy glaze to work with!

I used this on my sugar cookies and I found it to be a little too thin and I had to redip my cookies after it dried.  I think it would work out better to add more powdered sugar to thicken it up a little.  I thickened it up a whole lot after I was done glazing the cookies and put it into a frosting bag with a fine round tip ( I also added food color ) and I piped on the details I wanted and this turned out great!  I also added a little vanilla to it because I found it to be a little bland as is.  I think next time, also, I'll try it with milk instead of water.

Update:  I thickened it quite a bit this time, but it was still flowy enough to dip the cookies and this worked out much better.  It coated them better and it dried clearer and shinier.  Also, I put it in a glass pie plate so I could fit some of my bigger cookies in there.  I still just used water; didn't try it with milk in the glaze.  Lastly, I do double the recipe, otherwise it's not enough and do stir the glaze before dipping each cookie.

This glaze made my pumpkin-shaped sugar cookies come out beautiful!  They were bright, shiney and hard enouph to stack.  Some advice for those not-so-experianced bakers as myself...DO NOT PUT COOKIES IN FRIDGE AFTER GLAZING!  The shine was GONE when I took them out due to condensation. :(  Lesson learned.

When using this recipe, always, always always siftthe powdered sugar at least 2 or 3 times.  This makes the glaze flow over the cookie a bit easier and will eliminate any blotches. This is a wonderful glaze.

Been meaning to review this since last Christmas!  This is the coolest glaze.  It keeps the intensity of color when food pastes/cake decorating gels are added.  I find that a kid's paint brush (found in those water color kits) works great to spread glaze out for detail work.
Great!

This is a good basic glaze.  Thicken a bit to use with squeeze bottles and so it doesn't run off the side of the cookie.  Kids have a great time with the squeeze bottles and it is easy for them to use.  One review suggested using milk, but I found that the glaze dries with a matte finish instead of the shiny finish when water is used.  It's still great either way, just a different effect.

Perfect texture, high shine and color that adjusts easily with food coloring.  Used this to let 4 year olds paint sugar cookies with paintbrushes.  They loved it!  Stays moist long enough to add sprinkles but dries quickly enough to pack up when it's time to split up the cookies painted and go home.  Great taste and texture, not crumbly or crackly.  Adheres to cookie just right.  I've used lots of glazes, this is THE ONE.

This was such a simple, delicious icing recipe! I used it to decorate heart shaped cookies for Valentine's Day. I made a ton of different colors, which was a lot of fun. My advice... let them set overnight before trying to stack them. Some appeared to have hardened, but just the top layer had done so and I messed a few up. Everyone at work loved these cookies!

This glaze is perfection!  I use it every year along with the Butter Cookies II recipe on this site and they always are gobbled up quickly.  The only things I will caution bakers about is that you definitely need to start with the wet ingredients first: Syrup, Water and Flavoring (if using).  Then slowly add in the Confectioner's Sugar a few tablespoons at a time until you get the desired consistency.  The instructions are a little misleading and can be a disaster if you try to simply combine all together at once!  I like many others add a hint of Almond Extract to my glaze but it works with really any flavoring.  Great recipe!

I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and 1. used 2 tbsp of corn syrup 2. used a little over 1 tbsp of water and 3. added a couple drops of almond extract. The glaze turned out PERFECT - it was a perfect consistency, had a perfect texture and flavor and kept a beautiful shine, even days later!

Yum..Yum!! This is great...I usually make a confecitoners sugar and milk frosting for my sugar cookies but I was looking for something shiny and new this time and the corn syrup does the trick.
I do not like a thin frosting/glazes so the only change I made was to add 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar (instead of just one) to make it thicker..if it is to thick you just add a sprinkle of water and..perfecto! Threw the frosting in a baggie, cut off the tip and swirled it on...I ended up with a perfectly thick, shiny and very easily spreadable frosting...will always use this recipe from now on!! oh yeah I used a food coloring paste for a brighter color, and corn syrup with vanilla in it.

This was tough for me to rate.  So, for me this recipe gets 4 stars based on presentation.  The way this glaze dries is terrific and looks great on the cookies.  You can do some great things with this recipe.  However, for flavor, I would have to give it 3 stars.  I made it according to the recipe and it just didn't really do much for us in terms of taste.  They cookies looked great, but fell a little short in the taste department for us.  Maybe I will try experimenting with some different extract flavors and see if I can make this work all around.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This is such a great recipe! It works so nicely and tastes just like the icing they have on cookies in the store. I made fall themed leaf cookies with this; I tried to get a marbled effect two ways. First, I tried piping an outline on each cookie with one color of glaze and then filling the outline in with the same color. Than I piped in the center with a different color and marbled it slightly with a toothpick. This worked ok, but the glaze was runny and had a tendency to drip off, making a mess. So at the end, I poured two colors of glaze into one bowl and dipped the cookies in. They came out beautifully marbled and it was so much easier! After the colors dried, I piped veins onto each cookie with dark brown glaze that I added extra powdered sugar to, so that it would be thicker. The cookies were awesome and looked beautiful....everyone loved them!

This glaze was good but was not everything I had hoped for. It was very runny and messy which I had been lead to believe from the comments it would not be. The first batch I made I used water which I thought was disgustingly sweet with very little flavor so I added some vanilla. The second batch I used milk and vanilla and it was much better. Despite the mess in decorating it dried hard and made it easy to pack and ship the cookies. One tip: Make sure you add any sprinkles etc. as soon as you add the glaze, or it will dry and you won't be able to add it.

This was really easy and worked well for decorating bowling pin sugar cookies.  It sets relatively fast and was easy to work with.  I just realized I haven't eaten any decorated cookies yet, so I'll have to edit if the taste isn't up to par.  I used a paint brush to apply to the cookies.

OK - What did I do wrong?   I followed the recipe, but the glaze is not drying!  It stays gooey, and wet. Tasty, yes. But wet. 
Any suggestions?

Add more sugar to make it thicker.  Used milk instead of water.  Does take about 2 hours to dry completely.  Awesome effect when you drizzle one color over the other when it is still very wet (looks like zebra stripes!)

The very best glaze I have worked with.  The kids and I have made Christmas and Easter cookies now with this recipe and have created some beautiful designs - even for 3 and 5 year olds!  
I usually dip the cookies first, let them dry overnight, and then decorate with the kids the following day.  I always double the recipe, too, so that we have plenty of color choices - and buy paintbrushes just for this use and keep them with my food coloring.
TERRIFIC!!!!

LOVE this glaze!!! Like another I paired this with the best sugar recipe on this site and thought they are great pair!  After reading reviews I will try with milk next time and not water.  BTW the corn syrup I used had vanilla in it.

This tastes perfect on the Pope Sugar Cookies recipe. You will probably want to add more powdered sugar to thicken it up. It dries hard, but takes at least an hour or more to do so. Works best painted on the cookie, otherwise it runs a lot. This recipe does exactly what I wanted it to do and tastes great.

Five stars for texture and eye-appeal. Three stars for taste. It needs vanilla or something to tone down the icing sugar flavor

Solid recipe, I use water but add almond extract or butter extract (depends on the crowd) for flavor.  This is a hit every time.  Word to the wise, do not refrigerate to dry!  Something about being up all night before kindergarten graduation making graduation caps for all the classes and having no more room for putting cookies away to dry until morning, popped them in the fridge and lost a good 40 or so!  Lesson learned!  Still had enough for the little ones, just not extras for the parents!

Thanks for sharing!

Add 1/2 t almond extract.  Easy to work with.  Takes color well.  Dries shiny.

I glazed cut-out sugar cookies then sprinkled with colored sugar and decorated with mini M&Ms.  Fast and easy and turned out really cute!  This is an easy recipe to use....I will be experimenting with it.  Thank you!

Absolutely the perfect glaze for my Cream Cheese Sugar Cookies. I did add just a little vanilla extract. Recipe as is was the perfect amount for the amount of cookies I had, 27 cookies. Great recipe. Made my homemade cookies look like bakery bought!

Just what I was looking for.  This appears to be exactly the same glaze used on the expensive bakery cookies.  I agree it could use a bit of flavor, but it is personal preference.  Definitely double the recipe to cover a single recipe of sugar cookies.

I make this basic recipe all the time, but I use less corn syrup and water. Start with less and add until it is the consistency you want. I would beware of those who recommend using milk instead of water. If you use milk, you will need to refrigerate the cookies or eat them immediately. Not a good idea to leave them out and let the milk go sour. JMHO. For those who complain of the glaze not having enough color, I suggest you use the gel type food coloring rather than the liquid. The gel is very concentrated and you will get very intense colors.

EXACTLY the way i remember my mom's tasting!  I paired it with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" from this site, and as I said in my review of that recipe: My kids seriously cried when I cut them off from the cookie jar.

I love how easy this recipe is to make and apply to sugar cookies.  It works great to dip cookies in and let it roll off.  I especially love how it dries to a very shiny hard finish.  Tastes good and can be stacked with other cookies, without the worry of the icing getting smudged.  I use this recipe for every holiday!

It was the shiniest glaze I have ever found. Made a beautiful glaze for my sugar cookies. I found that less water made it perfect. I also found I didn't need to use a spatula, I just dipped the cookie upside-down and twisted. I am not sure if you need to let these air dry or freeze. I froze them to try and get them to set quicker. They stacked better than any other glaze/icing I have used but still got smudges. Any suggestions? I am still experimenting.

I read all the hints and added zest and a tsp of juice to the recipe and frosted then piped over the cookie.  It came out so great.  I will use this again on more cookies.

I used this recipe to drizzle over biscotti.  It was very watery.  I wish I would have used additional powdered sugar to thicken it up a bit.  I also added some vanilla to give it some flavor.

I have made a similar recipe like this, just without the corn syrup... it tastes the same, so don't add the extra calories of the corn syrup, just leave it out, and the taste and consistency is just the same!

This glaze was too thin to ice cookies, so I added another cup of powdered sugar and then it was spreadable, but still flattened out to a nice finish.  After the alteration, I  had no more drips.  I'm gonna add a photo of my ladybug cookies.

easy to work with.  Stays liquid enough to finish the batch, as long as there is a decent quantity still in the bowl.  Works to drizzle with spoon or paint on with the back of the spoon. Highly recommend!

After reading all the great reviews, I was very disappointed in how this glaze turned out. It was very thin and didn't taste good. I followed the recipe except for adding a little vanilla and extra powdered sugar (for some flavor and thickening). The next day, my cookies were soggy and not pretty. I ended up not being able to take them to my friends like planned. I'm not sure what went wrong.

This is VERY thin.  I added a bunch of extra sugar to thicken it a little and it still is extremely thin.  I also added a touch of vanilla since the flavor is kind of boring.  Went well with the best sugar cookie recipe on this site.  I did really like how it dried nice and hard so stacking the cookies worked nicely.

I like this glaze.  Very pretty!  I sprinkled just a tiny bit of colored sugar into it while wet.  They turned out quite pretty.  My second time making this taught me that I made a mistake in this the first time...one I had to figure out how to repeat!  

I used 2 Tblsp light corn syrup and only 1 Tblsp rather than the other way around.  The original way made it too runny for me.

I used milk instead of the syrup (which did turn it white) and it came out wonderfully! It's a little thin, but easy to thicken and tastes great.

I loved this recipe!!  I had quite a few cookies to cover so I made a single batch in my mixer and saw it wasn't much so I added more ingredients to make a second batch.  It was a bit thin so with two batches in the mixer I added about an extra cup of the powdered sugar. I also used a little bit of clear vanilla extract to give it a bit more flavor without adding color.  I wanted to make a couple different colors so I divided it up into smaller bowls and used my gel colors so as not to add liquid to the glaze.  The thicker glaze dried fairly quickly and tasted great on my sugar cookies.

I'd like to give this a 4.5, but since I can't give it a half point, I'm giving it a 4 because it's kind of messy and a bit difficult to work with if you're not used to glazes... BUT the end result is AMAZING. I'm used to icing my cookies, so I'm used to spreading it with an icing spatula. You can't really do that with this recipe, as I quickly learned. It's much easier to just dip the tops of the cookies in the glaze; then shake the cookies with the glaze side perpendicular to the bowl to remove excess glaze; then turn them so that the glaze side is up in your hand and shake them side-to-side to distribute the glaze evenly on the cookie top. By doing it this way, my cookies ended up looking like they were professionally made, with a coating that is as tasty as it is pretty. I will definitely keep using this recipe and perfecting my technique!

I really like this recipe.  The icing/glaze was very user friendly.  I used it to glaze cookies and then added more powdered sugar to thicken it up for piping small details.  Dried quickly (90 min to 2 hours).  I was icing alot of cookies so the glaze became thick so I just added a small amount of corn syrup, beat it in until I got the consistency I wanted again.  Worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make lots of icings and frostings, and this is probably the worst one I've ever made.  I followed it exactly and stirred lots, but the glaze separated once I put it on the cookies, and it dried with a strange, mottled look.  Maybe it's good for lighter/pastel colours, but I was using rich, dark colouring and my cookies looked diseased!  For the next batch I used "Sugar Cookie Icing" on this site (similar, but with milk) and it worked AWESOME!

I have been making sugar cookies for years and always save them til last because I hate icing them.  They always stuck together and broke apart.  With this recipe, they were so EASY and tasted so Awesome.  I did add some Almond flavoring and just kind of eyeballed the amount of water til I got the consistency I wanted.  My family absolutely loved this glaze.  Like another member reviewed, "This is the one!"

This is a wonderful glaze!  I used it on a pumpkin cookie, just dipped the tops into a bowl of the glaze, and they turned out perfectly.

My daughter and I used this receipe the other night to decorate 120 cookies it was great!  I used milk rather than water and the colors do fade some. Also the thicker the glaze the better the color stays but the longer the drying time.  But my daughter loved this recipe and asked if we could use it every year. It was easier to decorate the cookies than regular icing. We did find if using multiple colors to let one color dry some before you start with the second color, they were less likely to bleed that way.  Thanks for a great recipe. We really enjoyed it.

Outstanding!  I too had to tweak the amount of corn syrup and milk to get it to the right consistency..but it was great!!  We "painted" it onto sugar cookie lollipops (Deliah's Cut-Out Sugar cookies from this site) and then my 6yr old decorated them with sprinkles!!  The frosting dried nice and hard and it went great with the not so sweet taste of the cookies. He is so proud to give these as gifts in cookie bouquets to his teacher!! Thanks!

I glazed my leaf-shaped sugar cookies in a tri-color look following the directions suggested by Larkspur.  I made up a batch and a half of the glaze, divided it into three portions, gave each one a color, and then put them on a plate side by side.  I dipped each cookie into the colors, kind of mooshing them around a little to get the colors to run together.  It worked perfectly!  To get the veins, I then added all the colors together, added brown coloring to that, and used a toothpick to work that down the center and to the sides of the leaves.  I was very happy with my results.  BTW, I did have to add a little more corn syrup and water as I went along--just little dabs--to keep the right consistency of the glaze.  It's pretty easy to get whatever consistency you need for your project!  Thanks for a good recipe!

I like to use white grape juice instead of water or milk, it definitely gives you that little bit of flavor you are looking for.  It doesn't matte the finish like milk.  Experiment with other juices and see what you like.

I've been using this recipe for several years now and it has to be one of my all time favorites for kids to decorate with.  It is just so wonderfully spreadable, super super easy and i love the sheen on the cookies.  I've even piped images on a cake and used this to fill in the colors....this really is a winner.

Good for decorating cookies.  It goes on very easily, is dyed easily, and dries to a nice, shiny finish.  Next time, I'll add a flavoring so it's not just a straight sugar shot.

I have been using this recipe for years for all of the sugar cookies that I send out to family.  The cookie recipe is a family heirloom and the frosting/glaze is what makes it for us. 

Since I live in high altitude area (over 5,000 feet) I use just a little extra water since our dry goods, such as the confectioner's sugar, are dryer as we usually have very low humidity.

I also double the extracts for the cookies, due to the high altitude. If anyone who lives at high altitude and would like to see my cookie recipe that is adapted for this, you can go to my recipe box and see the recipe.  This recipe makes about 80 cookies so you can halve it if you would like.  The nice thing about this recipe is now when I cut out a Christmas tree or star, the shape that comes out of the oven LOOKS like a tree or star!!

I hate to rate a recipe low in case it's something I did wrong. I followed the recipe to a T, and it did not come out well. I dipped the cookies in, and the glaze soaked in. I waited about an hour until they were hard again, and I dipped again. I colored the glaze orange, and the glaze is completely transparent, not like the pictures I've seen. It tastes good, but I'm too embarrassed to take them to work like I'd planned.

This glaze finally gave me the smooth look that I wanted for my sugar cookies.  I might have made it a little thin as I had to recoat my cookies a few time to get a good covering.  The only downside was that the glaze is a little lacking in taste. - I just made this glaze again and added some vanilla. It was definitely tastier this time!

Didn't use food coloring but I did add a little almond extract which toned down the powder sugar taste. Does have a professional finish. I'll definately use this again. :)

I must have done something wrong, because my glaze dried with a mottled look to it. It tasted great, though so I will still give it 4 stars. I will try again and hopefully have better results next time in appearance because this glaze tastes great!

Fun alternative to regular frosting.  Does look like something in a bakery.  Per other reviews I added a bit of vanilla to my icing.  It was a little runny I did notice but other than that very good glaze.

Way too runny for me.  I had a thicker cookie and it just soaked right into it.  I don't know.. maybe I should have added more powdered sugar!

This glaze tastes and looks great.  It was a little difficult for my 3 year old to use himself, so I spread it on the cookies with a spoon, while he and my 2 year old daughter covered them with sprinkles.  The 10 drops of food coloring makes really dark shades, so lighten up on the drops if you're looking for pastels.

Good stuff! I doubled the recipe because I didn't think ½ cup of glaze would be enough for the 25 or 30 Valentine's-themed gingerbread cookies I was making.. That was a mistake! I have loads of glaze in the fridge. I'll just have to make more cookies. :) I added maybe ½ tsp or so of almond flavoring so that it wouldn't just be the powdered sugar taste, and it turned out really nice. The icing colors did mottle on the cookies but they're going to be consumed by a two-year old, so who cares? :) Thanks for a great recipe.

I would like to thank "LORIHANKE" for his/her most helpful input. I substituted the corn syrup (unavailable in Israel), for 10-15grams of butter flavored margarine. I also substituted one tablespoon of water, for one tablespoon of lemon juice.
The result had a great paste consistency, which I colored all different colors.
I used it for a 10 year-old girls-only birthday party, and had each girl decorate her own personal cake (I was lazy and used a Pillsbury mix for vanilla cake).
It was a huge success!!!

I've always used the egg whites with confectioners sugar to make glaze but I have a severe egg allergy that seems to get worse all the time.  This is an EXCELLENT glaze recipe that sets up just the same as the glaze using egg whites and it tastes wonderful! Great allergy alternative!

Not what I was looking for in a sugar cookie glaze. Super THIN and "watery". I ended up adding lots more powdered sugar and some vanilla and almond extract for better flavor. Not sure why all the rave reviews... Made as directed and it did not work out for me. And there is no way the cookies in the pic were made using this! The glaze runs right off your cookie.

We use this on all the fancy cookies we make, great on butter cookies that need a pick me up and do not over power the sugar cookies either. Thanks for helping me decorate our family favorites!
We pass this recipe along to many that ask for the secret recipe...as we call it! :)

I loved this.  I have tried MANY icing recipes and have never found one that harned well and still tasted good.  This was great.  The only thing is I had to use a bit more milk thna called for in the recipe, but it was still great. And the red and green color was a perfect compliment to my holiday cookies!!

Great Sugar Cookie Glaze! Not to sweet and dries quickly and hard. My kids loved "painting" the cookies. We divided the glaze and made several different colors using the food coloring. Thanks so much for the recipe.

The best glaze I've found for sugar cookies.  It dries nice and hard so cookies can be stacked on each other without damaging the icing!  Colours nicely too!

This glaze turned out great once I figured out the trick.  On my first attempt I just added all the ingredients as written and it turned out way too runny.  Instead stir together the sugar, corn starch, and ONE tablespoon of water.  Then if you want it thinner, stir in one TEASPOON of water at a time until it's the desired thickness.  1 Tbsp + 1 tsp of water was enough for me.  The recipe could be clearer about this.

A good & easy glaze.  Perfect for when I want to make sugar cookies, but don't want all the time and effort that goes with royal icing.  

Doesn't make a huge batch, and the glaze is thin, so I recommend spooning over the cookies or dipping them in the glaze.

This glaze was a little thinner than I wanted for my cookies, but that was easily remedied with the addition of more sugar. I would also add some kind of flavoring next time, just so the taste isn't just 'sweet'. Hardens beautifully for perfectly stackable cookies!

I found that I had to add a lot more sugar than the recipe called for to thicken it up enough so it wouldn't run off the cookie. My glaze also didn't dry hard the way the recipe said it would. Great shine and fun to decorate with though, just wish it was crunchier. May try it again with some moderations.

This glaze goes wonderfully with the rolled sugar cookie recipe.  I did not find it either to thick or too thin, but I carefully followed the proportions.  Like others, I also added some vanilla (1 tsp).  You can make a double batch and divide it up and add food coloring.  Get some clean paintbrushes (artist type of course) and paint on the glaze, being sure to stir the glaze frequently.  It also helps to add a few drops of water periodically to the glaze as it can be time consuming to paint cookies, and the glaze can form a crust on top and get a bit dry.  Oh, one other tip: use agave syrup instead of corn syrup, lower in sugar.  I also use whey low sugar.

I made this for Christmas cookie decorating with a table full of children. We dipped the cookies in white and let them all dry for an hour. Then I filled separate Wilton's squeeze bottles of colored glaze and let the children decorate. After those dried (an hour), we wrote on the cookies with Wilton's edible markers. The cookies were sold to raise $$$ for Habitate for Humanity. They were very cute, especially since they were made by kids 10-13 (and mom and dad. This glaze is practical!!

I make a lot of cookies and this is the glaze I have been using for years.  The only thing I do differently is I add a tsp of vanilla or almond extract.  It just adds to the flavor.  Make it in small batches because it does harden quickly but no need to dry overnight which is awesome!!

This was good. It sets up nicely, but it doesn't have a lot of shine to it. Colors took well, and were not washed out, but were nicely opaque. It needed just a bit of almond extract for flavor.

Perfect sugar cookie glaze.  We piped along the edges all of our cut outs in royal icing.  Then filled in the middle with glaze, and sprinkled colored sugar on top of that.  It was perfect and yummy.  Santa said they were great, too.

I made this with the 'Best Rolled Sugar Cookies' recipe. Found that 2 T of water made the glaze too runny - it soaked into my cookies. So I made a 2nd batch and only used 1 T of water. It was still liquid enough to dip and instead of soaking in, the glaze sat really nicely on top of the cookie and I had enough time to throw some holiday jimmies on them. I did use water because I wanted a shiny look. I also swirled the food coloring in to give the cookies a marbled look - very cool! Delicious!

I have been using "sugar cookie icing" recipe on this site, and liked it just fine, but decided to try this one out of curiosity. Taste the same...only difference I noticed is this glaze sets up faster and is a little thicker (not so runny like). I think I will continue to use this recipe due to it setting faster. Thanks!

The best sugar cookie glaze I have every used.  I added half a capful of vanilla extract to give it a little flavor and a teaspoon of extra confectioners sugar to thicken it a little bit more.  This works very well with both "spooning" the glaze on to fully cover the cookies or doing a light drizzle also.  I get rave reviews whenever I use this glaze.

Delicious glaze. I followed the suggestion of substituting milk for water and it turned out perfect!

So easy to make- smooth and beautiful in a jiff! I used this in different colors on my Christmas cookies and it was lovely!
I did use milk- still came out shiny and yummy!

I made several colors in small dishes  to decorate our sugar cookies and my kids went bananas with joy!  I just let them decorate them as they liked and we had so much fun together!  Great out-of-school project to pass the days away when it's too hot to play outside.  I forgot to mention how delicious it was and beautifully it dried, thanks for the recipe!

WAY TOO SWEET.  I have a sweet tooth, but this frosting made my sugar cookies tooth-achingly sweet.  Cut the sugar to 2/3 cups and I sometimes make lemon glaze with this recipe by adding 2 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon lemon extract - which help cut the sweetness. My kids wouldn't touch the cookies with the original recipe, but after the alteration, we all enjoyed it.  So reduce that sugar folks - yikes.

When I made it I used the amounts suggested, but added 1/2 teas or more of vannilla flavoring first time, and almond the second batch.  I just added more confectioners' sugar to get to the way I wanted it to be.  I will use again and again.

2TBS of water is too much, especially if you add flavoring and coloring to the glaze. This is just one of those recipes that you kind of have to play around with to get it just right. I have used glaze recipes before with milk, but once the glaze dried, it had a mottled appearance.  This recipe produced a very smooth, shiny and hard finish. I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to play around with it too much.

My glaze I made last night tasted like way, way to much powdered sugar.  Was I suppose to sift it or what?  I followed the recipe to a T!!  Did I not stir it long enuf?  It was just so grainy.

This is an excellent glaze.  I used it on my Christmas cut-out cookies this year.  However, it didn't stay shiny.  I used water and it was hard and didn't smear but not shiny after a while.  Any suggestions?

Good recipe, pretty standard for a glaze. To add more flavor i used milk instead of water. And added wither a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract to each batch of glaze to boost the flavor!

It's very forgiving - I left out the corn syrup by mistake and used 2 T fresh lemon juice and 1 tsp lemon extract.  A pastry brush worked great on my "Lemon Sugar Tea Cookies" from this site. They are shiny and hardening.

Go slow adding wet indredients so you can check for the consistency you want. I used in decorator tubes/tips with asst'd decorations. My son enjoyed helping when he saw what I was doing. Fun.

I went looking for a recipe that could mimic poptart icing enough to please my picky three year old.  He loves pop tarts but due to religious restrictions we cannot eat the frosted ones due to pork gelatin.  The unfrosted ones look quite unappetizing to a toddler, so i bought them and told them we'd make them "blue icing!"  And so today we did.  I didn't see anywhere whether this could be stored or not, so I made 1/4 of the written recipe.  It made too much for two poptarts but the bit that's left isn't so much that I'll lose sleep at night over throwing it away. I didn't even taste it myself, but he gobbled down two poptarts with great enthusiasm so it definitely served its purpose!  Also adds a bit of homemade fun to an otherwise grab and go food.  :)

Awesome glaze. Love the shiny, professional look it gave my less-than-perfect looking cookies. I subbed lemon juice for half of the water, and used waaaay less food coloring, as they were Easter cookies and my yellow was intense at just 5 drops. Like many others, I also used corn syrup that was already vanilla-flavored. They did take a long time to dry completely (several hours) but I also am in a high-humidity climate so that may have affected drying time.

I will definately use this recipe again.

I just made this icing and it worked out, even when using dark Karo syrup which was all I had.  I used Almond extract instead of coloring and then used the mutiple colored sprinkles.  Wonderful icing tht truly dries and keeps the sprinklings from falling off, and it is not too sweet.

I have used this recipe several times now and it has always turned out great. Even people who don't like sugar cookies love them with this glaze.  Sometimes the finish mottles after a few hours. Even after stirring between cookies. I'm wondering if it has to do with the syrup to water ratio or maybe the humidity in my house, since it doesn't mottle each time. I've also used the Sugar Cooking Icing recipe on this site which calls for milk. It doesn't seem to mottle with the milk, but I like the clear finish without out the milk better.

I used this glaze over a cake - my son's school project. He wanted the color & design of the cake to be seen & not hidden under frosting. It worked like a dream!  I did increase the corn syrup (to 4 Tbs)so that it would be less opaque, & reduced the water to 1 Tbs. Added a pinch of salt & a splash of vanilla... just what I needed!  Now I'm in the mood for sugar cookies!

This glaze it what makes a sugar cookie taste good!! It is so much better than a thick sugary mess. And you can still use sprinkles and other things to make the cookie that much more special. I love love love this glaze.

nice glaze, easy to alter to your desired consistency.  I always add a pinch of salt to this type of frosting to cut down on the incredible sweetness a little.

Awesome, thanks for sharing. I love this recipe. Also I learned that to make the glaze glossier I add more corn syrup. Matted, reduced corn syrup. My kids had so much fun, and the cookies looked all shiny and pretty.

I good recipe for sugar cookie frosting. Add the water very slowly. If you use a flavoring or an exract, add that first, then the water. Be careful not to add to much liquid and make the frosting runny. I've also used this recipe as a glaze for several pound cakes. It will harden overnight if. Just make sure whatever you put it on is completely cooled.

I love this icing! I added a few drops of vanilla and probably an additional tablespoon or two of water. It comes out great and tastes good too. I used 1 drop of food coloring for a light, pastel blue (the shade of blue Peeps). It's wonderful.

This was good. I will use it again. It was a little runny but I think it was because I added a 1/4tsp of vanilla for flavor. The cookies took 2 hours to dry, but then still tacky - I will try more sugar next time.

I hate to be in the minority here, but I thought this glaze was not good.  I don't know how it got so many rave reviews, but I wish I would have listened to the few bad reviews. I just threw two dozen yummy soft sugar cookies in the trash because this glaze ruined them.  Even my kid turned his nose up at them :(

Sickeningly sweet, almost tooth ache inducing.  Wow, I could barely finish a cookie.  But, I took them to a pre-school party and the kids really liked them. Though, I'd not want them to have too many, this could cause cavities!  The only change I made was to add milk instead of water.  They did dry shiny and hard, and dried quickly.  They stood up well to color.  But, the taste is just not going to work for anyone without a serious sweet tooth.  Two stars only because the kids liked them so much.

This glaze worked fairly well. It took a bit longer than I had hoped for it to harden, but ended up nice.  I had to do 2 coats for it to really add the color though.  I used the new gel style food coloring and I don't like it as well as traditional coloring, but there was none to be found.  Make more than you expect though, it seems to have run out more quickly than anticipated, based upon the recipe.

I have always made this recipe with milk, and I was thrilled with the results after using corn syrup instead.  The color stayed nice and bright, and  I love the hard shiny coating on top of soft, chewy sugar cookies.It also dried fairly quickly, so I was able to stack the cookies sooner--a big help when you make tons of cookies.  This will definitely be my go-to cookie icing from now on.  I just wish I was as artistic and creative as some of the other people on this site.  There are some truly gorgeous pictures with this recipe.  I end up just slathering or drizzling it on, but it tastes just as good!

I just tried this recipe for the first time and LOVED it.  It's so much easier to use and finishes nicer than "icing".  Be sure to double or triple the recipe though...this didn't make enough to cover an entire batch of sugar cookies.

First, I don't bake or cook very often and I am not a perfectionist.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla or lemon extract for flavor. I dipped the cookies, let them drip a little then set them on parchment paper.  Some of the icing did drizzle down the sides onto the paper but, I was in a hurry and was not concerned about them looking "professional".  THIS WORKED FANTASTIC!!!  The icing set up great, color was great, fast, easy, etc...  I am so glad that I found this recipe - will continue to use it.  I have printed it and wrote it down with my sugar cookie recipe.  I did read other reviews first which helped ALOT

I followed the recipe exactly but the glaze splotched up when I covered the cookies. I tried to use a small paint brush to even out the color but that didn't help either...not very impressed.

This is a great glaze. I read all the reviews and made changes such as 2/3 c sugar instead of 1 cup and used a little less water since I also added vanilla extract. It was just what I needed for my cookies. Thanks so much for sharing. It's a keeper.

This worked ok. It wasn't quite what I was looking for. Once the frosting dried it look very dull, but at least the flavor was good.

This glaze was awesome for the conversation heart cookies I did for my boyfriend! Very easy to work with, and dries amazing! This glaze made the cookies look like they came from a bakery! What I liked about it most was that it was not overwhelmingly sweet!

This worked perfectly for dipping cut-out cookies.  I needed it to be thin.  Dries fast.  Reduce liquid for a thicker glaze.  Is true that it looks professional!

Great "hard" glaze.  We used it on gingerbread men and it worked wonderfully.  I will use less liquid next time, though, because my glaze ran over the sides of the cookies and wouldn't keep its designs.

That perfect smooth frosting - especially for thick soft cut out cookies. 
If you plan to sprinkle them, be sure to do so right after frosting.  It hardens
that fast!

This is my favorite way to decorate my cutout cookies, and I always get tons of compliments on the appearance and taste! Sometimes it takes practice to get the consistency just right, and using milk does help. You have to play around with the ratios and quantities a bit; it's not an exact science. More milk = more matte, but it also makes the consistency thinner if you want it to spread/fill in an outline. I do also add almond extract for flavor. I use this glaze on the Crisp Sugar Cookies recipe and it's fantastic. The almond flavor in the glaze pairs nicely with the vanilla in the cookies.

This glaze is great for giving a stained glass look. I didn't think the taste was bad, but I wouldn't say the taste was that great. I will add clear vanilla extract next time. It serves the purpose of being sweet and shiny. I used Wilton's cake frosting color gels that I purchased at a craft store and the colors were great!

Mt family did not care for the taste at all. I will try again with the addition of a flavored extract as others have suggested. I used milk instead of water, and that does indeed take away the shiny appearance. The glaze never dried completely and I had to redo my dessert, but that was probably an error on my part in making the glaze too thin.

Tried the recipe and wasn't impressed.  The glaze didn't dry hard and was extremely runny.  I was expecting it to hold its shape more.  Cut WAY down on the amount of liquids you use and make sure you sift your powdered sugar. My kids didn't care and they still had fun decorating them, but there were no easter egg designs or faces to be painted.

I mix up a huge batch then separate for different paste food coloring.  I also use the food color markers and this holds up well if I let it dry overnight - it may be ready sooner, but I always wait at least 10 hours. It packs and ships well too.  The only time I have had difficulty it when I've overdone the water or corn syrup.

This was so simple to make and takes to color very well.  A little goes a long way when adding a color to this glaze.  I will certainly be using this for many years to some for my cookies.  Thank you for sharing this recipe

I live overseas soI can't find corn syrup so I substituted the corn syrup for 3 tbsp powdered sugar and 1/4 tsp water. Also I added 1/4 tsp almond extract. They were pretty good but I think the corn syrup is what causes the hard shell so they weren't as hard as I like. Pretty dang close though. Next time I'm going to try adding an extra cup of powdered sugar so they're easier to spread. They'er a bit difficult in that department but very good overall!

Great glaze!  For more flavor, I used 1 cup powered sugar, 2 TBS egg nog, 1.5 TBS water, and 1 TBS of corn syrup.  Very flavorful.

Tasted great, looked pretty after it dried; however, the next day it was kind of splotchy looking, with white patches on the surface.  Wonder what I did wrong?

Very disappointed in this glaze.  Made this for cookie swap and had to re-make a whole new batch.  The only good thing about it is that it is very pretty to look at - but what good is that if nobody will eat them.

Kids love it. Pretty glaze, very shiny. Added milk instead of water & a few drops of almond extract.

I really liked the final consistency of this icing. I was using royal icing for gingerbread, and it was just too crunchy when it  set up. This icing sets firm so you can stack your cookies, but won't break your teeth when bite into them. :) The onlly thing keeping this at 4 stars was that the icing dried slightly cloudy. Maybe I needed to use more color. Overal, very happy with this recipe. :)

Very easy to make, tasty... I added almond extract and the cookies turned out wonderful.  I used the Best ever Rolled Cookie recipe.  Next time will use less icing on the cookies.  Set up really nicely but I recommend letting them set up before refrigerating if you added food coloring.

This recipe is sickeningly sweet!  Even after scaling back the sugar in my favorite sugar cookie by 3 quarters, I found this glaze to be like eating pure sugar. The only reason why I am giving this recipe 2 stars instead of 1 is because I didn't have the same problems as some of the other users. The glaze did adhere to the cookie and the food coloring tinted it quite well and evenly. It made my Valentine's cookies look lovely, but the taste was unbearable. Even my sweet-toothed children ate 1 cookie each and said "Mom we don't want anymore. These are making us sick!" Needless to say, I won't be using this recipe again.

Awesome!  I used a little bit more powdered sugar to make it slightly thicker.  I also dipped my cookies as someone else suggested and it worked perfectly!  My cookies were beautiful and the icing was tasty!  Oh, I did add clear vanilla extract (a must, IMHO!).  This is a keeper!

I also added almond extract and I dipped all of the cookies face first then did detail with a toothpick and gels.

Happy new year!

Tasted good but it was a little too runny for the kids to be able to use. It was running off the sides of the cookies before it dried but when it did dry it did have a nice finish to it.

I substituted 1tbs. of water for lemon juice which helped to pump up the flavor, and went great with the sugar cookies.  This was a little harder to work with than I expected, but it also gave a nice shiny finish to my cookies, I would not reccommend this for first time cookie decorators, but it is GREAT for more experienced bakers.

Even after accidentally adding twice the milk needed, the glaze still hardened!  I will be using this recipe from now on to ice all of my gingerbread cookies.  A word of caution however: if you drip some on the counter, wipe it up immediately before it dries, or you will need a chisel to get it up!

Not what I was looking for.  It really needs some flavor added to it otherwise it doesn't taste very good.  When I followed the recipe, I found it too runny.  I liked how it hardend up though.  I won't make this again.

Works really well. Needs more drying time, overnight if possible. Definitely use 4 tsp of milk, I could not even mix it with 2 tsp for 1 cup of sugar. I used it to cover rice crispy treats.

This glaze is so easy!  I made some for an church activity with a bunch of kids all different ages to decorate cookies (Michelle's soft sugar cookies from this site) and it was great!  Even my 3 yr old was able to brush on the glaze, it was a great activity.  The glaze did harden but it took quite a while longer than I anticipated, almost 2 hours, still a great idea, though.

I tried this recipe for sugar cookie glaze and I was not as impressed as the others. The glaze didn't stay put over the entire cookie. It kid of shrank back. I tried another recipe without the corn syrup and it was much better.

Thank you!  This is the glaze I have been forever searching for!!!  It worked great and the suggestion to use kids paintbrushes was a perfect idea for my 5 year old. We had a great time decorating cookies this year and I was thrilled to finally have a glaze that actually hardened and tasted good!

Well, good heavens.  It worked, nice and hard shiny glaze that held my 'glitter' nicely on my cookies.  But now I have to go borrow the village's fire hose to blast the counters and walls of my kitchen!  Messy....but what the heck.

Great recipe! I added vanilla and a little more powder sugar. My sugar cookies turned out beautiful. I dipped the cookies, stirring after every cookie & the scraping the side of the cookie to remove some of the extra glaze. Then I drizzled another color randomly over the tops.  Use a light color with a dark color like blue, green or red with yellow accents. They were smooth and shiny & no mottled colors...a bit messy but cookies with out a mess just wouldn't be right:)

This is a very good glaze for sugar cookies and you'll definityly want to double or triple the recipe because it doesn't make very much to follow it strictly. 

I tweak the recipe a bit by adding a little more water until I get the right consistency - I like it drippy enough so it spreads very easily.  It dries very nicely and is shiny and hard.

I thickened this with a lot of extra powdered sugar and used it as an icing.  It was no more or less impressive than anything else I've ever homemade before.  Doubt I'll ever bother with this again.

The glaze was very runny so it was hard to color without the colors running together.  It does harden up nicely though and has a good flavor.

Very Good. I make this every Christmas for my daughter's cookie party. I double, triple and even quadruple the recipe so that I can divide it and add food colorings.  If it hardens, just stir it up again.

This really easy and does dry hard and shiny.  It's usually best to leave the cookies out to air overnight before stacking or wrapping them, though.  You can thin the glaze down for dipping or pouring, or use it thick and spread it.

Amazingly easy recipe that yielded great results!!! So pleased with this glaze. My 4 & 5-year-old daughters easily glazed our kitty and puppy cookies as evenly as two very young children possibly could. I did use milk instead of water. Thank you!

I make this glaze annually to decorate our family's cream cheese sugar cookie recipe. It's so easy and adaptable! I use milk instead of water, and add 1tsp vanilla for taste. Compensate for the added liquid by adding a bit more powdered sugar.

This was  an easy to use kid friendly recipe .We loved it.It dries quick and tastes better than royal icing.Tip it is a little bit running I just added a little bit more powdered sugar until I got the consistency I desired.

Very easy to make. I suggest having multiple cups/bowls to sort out each color. I did not have any decorating tips and just used spoons and a knife. If you do multiple colors on one cookie, let one portion set up before adding the other color. It also tastes amazing.

I try to make sugar cookies every Christmas.  They never come out as good as my mother-in-law's, even though I had her recipe.  This one though came out great!  I did cut the nutmeg back a little, but that is all I changed.  I made sure my dough was about 1/4" thick rolled and I did need to let them back an extra minute or two as my cutouts are on the big side.   My cookies came out awesome.  Finally, I have a good sugar cookie recipe!

I found this icing incredibly runny. Unusable. I lost track but I estimate I had to triple the sugar content. I know my way around a kitchen and know how to follow recipes. I won’t be making this again.

I added more water to make it more liquid and less pasty.  You do have to keep stirring it so it doesn't harden.  The kids loved the cookies!

Not sure what I did wrong...followed the recipe exactly and it was WAY too thin. Added more sugar and it never did get a good consistency and I didn't like the taste much at all...my kids said it tasted "ok" but the consistency was awful.

Was looking for a glaze to drizzle over my biscotti (almond biscotti by Mrs.  H Michaelsen)  and found this.  Since I didn't need alot, I took the suggestion of one person by just adding the amount of  sugar I needed to get the consistency right.  I didn't have any corn syrup so I substituted sugar and warm water mixture (5 to 1 respectively) and used the milk suggestion.  Added the powdered sugar until I had a semi stiff mixture that could be squeezed thru a plastic bag with small cut corner.  Worked out great.  Next time I might need to add  a bit more sugar because it is taking a long time to harden.  Course that might be because of my corn syrup substitution.

Best glaze ever - perfectly thick for cakes or cookies.  Love it!  As I glazed a lemon cake today I decided to add a little lemon extract (3 drops) and used a scant (3 drops yea right) of corn syrup.  Delicious!!

I used this recipe as a base start. I added a 1/2 tsp lemon extract and little more confectioners' sugar. I did not add the 10 drops of food coloring as per cyndi's recipe, but rather a few for the desired color.

Making our Christmas cookies for Santa, the glaze tastes good and dries quickly, next time I will try to thicken it a little bit. We used squeeze bottles to decorate and it was a touch runny.

Nice easy glaze. I added a few drops of almond extract to the liquids, then sifted the sugar into the liquids. I put the glaze in a shallow bowl and dipped the cookies in the glaze - fast and easy. One recipe of glaze covered 24 medium sized cut-out cookies.  I didn't add food coloring, just put colored sprinkles on the cookies.

I have finally found a wonderful glaze for my homemade sugar cookies. This glaze is easy to make and use. I just put the cookie in the glaze and lift up and let the excess glaze fall back in the bowl and put on wax paper on a cookie sheet. The cookies came out wonderful and so shiny. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Following the suggestion of other reviewers, I added just a tiny bit of almond extract, and I got exactly the results I was looking for! I had tasted the most amazing glazed sugar cookies a couple of years prior to finding this recipe, and always wondered what the secret was in the glaze, and it is without a doubt ALMOND EXTRACT!!  I made these for my kids to give to their teachers and friends as Valentine's gifts, and everyone loved them. This one's a keeper!

Needs almond and/or vanilla extract, as mentioned.  I also use a tbs of soft butter and milk instead of water.  Thin mix is good, it dries nice and shiny and your cookies will stay nice without icing movement.

I followed this recipe to the T and although I wasn't disappointed I couldn't help but to feel a little bit disappointed. The amazing shine and hardness that everyone raves about didn't happen for me. Yes it was runny and I did also add more sugar as I had read many others did.

Followed recipe and it was nearly perfect. Next time did 1 TBSP water, and then traded out half a teaspoon of pure lemon extract and milk to make up the other TBSP of water. Also used gel food color. Glaze was perfect, not too thin, not too thick, dried nice, hard and shiny with great flavor.  Thank you!

Have not once looked for another glaze recipe! It was so easy for the kids to work with it, I did not have to constantly give them directions on what to do to manage it.it dries very fast, the color stays vivid and shiny and it tastes amazing! Our Valentine's Day cookies are a big hit with friends always! Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe tasted way too much like confectioner's sugar and was very runny. It works best as a glaze to be spread all over something--it doesn't hold shapes. Well, I guess I should have gotten that from the fact that it is called a "glaze" and not "icing" or something. Anyways, I played around with the proportions and added a little cornstarch for thickness. I also added orange extract, vanilla, and orange juice and it turned out well, but I wouldn't really consider what I ended up with to be this recipe!

I still prefer butter icing as my base.  If I use lots of icing sugar it hardens up.  Then I use royal type icings for the details.

It was easy to make. However I had issues trying to pipe it neatly onto the cookies. I ended up just dunking the whole cookie in the glaze. The other issue i had was that the cookies were stuck to the cooling rack in the morning so a lot of them broke as i was trying to get them off. They tased pretty good though

This glaze was ok. I divided it up to make it different colors and my big complaint was that it was very thin and runny so I could see through the first coat I did so I had to put another one on. I also forgot to add any extract so it did taste very much like solid powdered sugar. Not sure I would use it again.

I can never get this right. It is alwasy a mess. It tastes really good and I hate to give it a low rating just because I can't figure it out. Perhaps "glaze" is not for me. I prefer the "Sugar Cookie Frosting" recipe from this site. It allowes me to add more detail to "the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies". I will keep experimenting with this  though and try to get it right.

Something didn't work right, the glaze was almost clear and didn't set up like I thought it should.

I made the most beautiful sugar cookies, and then lucked out by finding this recipe to decorate them with! My cookies have never looked so wonderful, even though I certainly have spent a lot more time in the past trying to make them pretty.

It wasn't thick enough to cover the cookie - i added extra sugar, but still not enough 'stick' to it to cover evenly.

This stuff is AMAZING!  I may never "frost" a sugar cookie again. I used milk as I was out of corn syrup and added some vanilla extract.  It looked good and tasted wonderful.  I will double the recipe next time, as the cookies I made were very large circles so I ran low on glaze.

This was good.  Easy to use but needed flavor.  I doubled the recipe, added half lemon juice half water in one batch.  One batch I used vanilla.  I dipped each cookie in the glaze in a pie plate.  I made it a little thicker to decorate smaller spots and very thin to make stripes on the stars.  I liked that this recipe didn't have milk or butter.  That makes me nervous leaving dairy out with no refrigeration.

This is a great glaze. I used it with Cream Cheese Sugar Cookies and it was a very tasty compliment to them.  I traced the outline of the cookie with Royal Icing II and allowed that to dry then used the glaze.  We will be using this recipe again!

Worked beautifully on my sugar cookies!  I added a half teaspoon of almond extract for a bit of extra flavour, and divided the batch into 4 so that I could get 4 different colours.  I used a small spoon for applying the glaze in a nice, even coat, and then drizzled on additional colours after the first coat was dry (just took a few minutes).

This made perfect cookies.  It didn't crack, it held the color wonderfully, and it came out delicious.

This was a really nice, pretty glaze. I didn't stir it as I glazed my cookies, and it didn't dry mottled. I did, however, use a large artist's paintbrush to apply the glaze, and it went so fast I couldn't believe it. It took about ten minutes to dry completely, so allow time.

I feel like I must have done something wrong with this recipe because I just didn't have the best results.  I know I followed it exactly though (because I made it twice in order to have enough glaze).  

My issue was with how THICK the glaze was.  It was literally impossible to get onto the cookies without the cookies breaking.  I ended up microwaving it for about 20 seconds, and that helped, but it just got thick again so quickly.  

It does look nice on the cookies, and I love the flavor, but it was completely unmanageable.  Next time I'll try to add more water or maybe less sugar.  I don't want to end up with a dozen broken cookies again!

This is a great base for sugar cookies.  It dries to a hard finish and is easy to spread across the entire cookie.  I did use milk instead of the water and liked it much better.

You would think all sugar glazes are the same but the corn syrup really makes a difference. It was just perfect. I used milk instead of water. The icing was still very shiny, I thought.

Rolled out great, tasted wonderful, and held their shape!  These were the best sugar cookies I have ever made and I have made a lot.

I prefer a sweetly flavored glaze and this is not it.  It tasted purely of powdered sugar (go figure!).  I can see how it would be a good glaze for children though.  As it dried it became hard and crunchy.  I rated it at 3 stars because it is what the recipe claims, fast and hard drying.  It just did not appeal to my tastes.
