Excellent!  These were great the first time I made them.  My toddler loved them.  I just got done making a second batch and I believe they are even better and healthier.  I made these substitutions: 5 large carrots, grated; Only 1/2 cup brown sugar; Only 1/3 cup white sugar.  With these substitutions the muffins are still sweet, raised great, and are delicious!  Great recipe!

Can someone tell me the problem. These muffins don't rise. Tried a second time with brand new 
baking powder(mine was old) and still didn't rise. Left them in the oven for an hour and then shut it off and left them in there. They NEVER cooked inside.Have thrown out 2 batches. I give up.

This is an excellent carrot cake recipe. It's very moist and tasty. I made it in my mini-bundt cake pan. It made 10 mini-bundt cakes, and I did not have to alter the cooking time.

I get rave reviews from those whom I share these muffins with. The glaze is what makes them special and the carrot amount adds to the luscious moistness.  I guess she likes dry things!  Too bad.

These are really yummy muffins! I made some mini-muffins and a few regular sized (48 and 4 respectively). The one thing I would suggest to others who want to make these: if you are looking for a strong carrot flavor (more like a carrot cake), add more carrot than what is recommended. I used about 4 carrots from my garden (medium sized) and I found the carrot flavor was still a bit muted, especially paired with the strong cinnamon flavor of the glaze; so I would suggest using about 5 med-sized carrots. Also, I used applesauce instead of oil and found the muffins to be really nice and moist! Definitely a keeper recipe!

I made these today and they turned out great! They were nice and moist. I used the Splenda white and brown sugars and egg subsitute for the eggs. Great recipe.

Very tasty! Nice moist muffin. I liked the buttermilk glaze, kind of dressed the muffin up. I did miss the normal raisins you find in carrot cake, though. Next time I'll put some in. Nice low fat recipe! Thanks.

This is a good recipe.  I made it in mini cupcake pans.  (more child friendly size)  I told my little boy they were carrot "cupcakes"  (more enticing than a muffin) and he ate them all up.  All four kids and hubby liked.

These are SO good and easy to make!  I made them to send to school for my daughter's 4th birthday and her entire class just loved them!  Any yummy way to get more fruit & veggies in my daughter's diet will always rate 5 stars with me!  :-)

Way too much carrot and not enough "muffin".  Glaze didn't improve the taste either.

I think this recipe is great (It's too bad that it doesn't give half stars, otherwise I'd give it a 4.5).  I altered the baking time because I made them into tiny little muffins.  On the first batch, it turned out great (I baked it for 15 minutes) and on the second I baked it for 17 minutes.  Both turned out very well.  As for the glaze, it was, well...perhaps a little too spicy?  I just asked my mommy what she thought of it, and she thought that the cinnamon flavor was a little too overpowering.  I'm making these for my friend's birthday, but next time I'll cut back on the cinnamon in the glaze.  It's my first time ever making carrot cake, and I like it.  It's tasty ;)

A very moist muffin.  I halved the recipe and used applesauce instead of oil and added some finely chopped walnuts. Did not make the glaze as they were great without it.  Thanks, TPADULA, for sharing a new muffin for us to try.  A keeper for us !!

I made these for my son's snack at school and they were well-liked.  They aren't overly sweet, but there is enough sweetness to make them appealing, especially with the glaze. I would make these again.

Was looking for a recipe for carrot cake muffins similar to Mimi's cafe...with other fruit in it. These sure were great! Love the addition of pineapple and coconut, and I even added golden raisins...the buttermilk is a great too. Am sharing it several places and plan to bring recipe cards with me. Doesn't even really need the frosting... So I really love it! Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for some healthy, delicious muffins; and these are them!!  To make them even healthier, I cut the sugar in half, substituted applesauce for the oil, and used milk with a touch of lemon juice in place of the buttermilk.  I also added 1/2 c. raisins because I think all carrot muffins need raisins.  :)  The glaze is the perfect topping.  You won't regret making these!!

Great recipe and really easy. It is also idiot-proof. How do I know? Well, I forgot to add the carrots!  However, I did have the foresight to add a cup of raisins to the batter and the cupcakes taste great.

These are good but a bit bland, even though I accidentally used 2 tablespoons of cinnamon instead of 2 teaspoons. I also thought they were too sweet, even though I did not use the glaze. Still, a good recipe to start from. Next time I will use 2 T cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp allspice, no white sugar, and add plumped raisins. I'll also chop the pineapple in a  food processor before adding it--I didn't care for the chunks. 

I got 20 muffins, but I like to fill my cups mostly full for a nicely rounded muffin. 

When I calculated the calories for this recipe, I came up with 210 calories each (for 24 muffins) WITHOUT the glaze.

These were good muffins that are best when eaten the day they are baked.  Because of the glaze, mine started to get a little gooey the day after.  The spice is just right, and they baked up very nicely.

These are like a super-duper breakfast muffin. I didn't have buttermilk so I added a tsp. vinegar to regular milk. I also cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown. Finally for the topping I chopped up 1/4 cup walnuts, mixed them in with 1 tsp cinnamon and 2 tbs white sugar. The topping really turned out awesome with these little babies. A great muffin, especially if you love a little spice.

I made mini muffins....they are great!  I put the coconut into the blender to shred it more (I don't like long pieces of coconut!).  Had these at our egg hunt today, and all the kids liked them.  Even the ones who didn't like carrots or pineapple or coconut!  My glaze was a bit runny, so I applied it with a pastry brush.  Definitely a keeper!

I used fresh pineapple since I had it on hand.  Also added raisons.  I used applesauce in place of oil. but it was too applesaucy-sweet....would use the oil if I made them again.
Also cut sugars....too  sweet.  I used 25 larger baby carrots. and still not a very carroty taste - go figure.

Excellent! They tasted like little carrot cakes, but far less rich (put some cream cheese icing though, and you've got the richness!).  I subbed yogurt for the buttermilk, and they came out moist and delicious.  Wonderful recipe!!

I substituted 1 cup of regular flour with whole wheat flour, used 1/3 cup of white sugar rather than 2, and used applesauce instead of oil. I also cooked the muffins for a shorter time as my oven is a bit temperamental. The muffins turned out great(I also did mini muffins) - very moist, lots of flavour and I loved the chewy addition of coconut. I will definitely make these again.

I've made these twice, once as mini muffins (I took them to work and they were a big hit) and once as regular-sized muffins (when my in-laws came to visit; my MIL especially loved them). The only change I made was to reduce the sugar a bit (and to use the lemon juice with milk trick for the buttermilk, which we don't have here). The muffins were moist and tasted great. The recipe makes a lot of muffins, but they do freeze well.

These are GOOD!  I just got them out of the oven and couldn't wait to taste.  I added 2/3 cup of chopped walnuts and since I didn't have any crushed pineapple I substituted a can of mandarin orange segments that I crushed up with my fingers.  These are great.  I don't know if they're going to last long enough to be glazed!!!

I did everything like the recipe but it was very heavy not like  my  blueberry muffins . My toddler helped but she only had two bites :-( 
Was so happy I found a way for her to get  her carrots any idea to make them fluffy spongy even?

I cut this recipe in half and made mini muffins.  I was making this for my 2 year old and didn't know if he'd like it, so I didn't want to make a full batch.  I did make some changes as well.  I left out the coconut and replaced the oil with applesauce and the buttermilk with regular milk.  I also increased the carrot (a half batch called for 1 1/2 and I used about 2 1/2). I kept the temp of my oven at 375 and the mini muffins were done in about 13 minutes.  I ended up with 31 of them filling the pan 3/4 of the way.  Next time I make these, I will omit the white sugar and the allspice.  They just had a bit more spice than I wanted.  All in all, they came out very moist and I will definitely make these again.

These were very good!  But I do agree with the reviewers who said there was too much sugar in them. I would definitely cut back next time.  I did use a cup of whole wheat pastry flour and omitted the pineapples and coconut (don't like either in my carrot cake).  Turned out fine.  My glaze was not white like the picture because the cinnamon automatically darkens the glaze.  Overall, this is a recipe worth keeping.  Just needs a little tweaking.

I loved this!  I made exactly as stated, and yes, you could probably cut back on the sugar.  I would likely cut the white sugar back to 1/2 c and the brown to 3/4 cup.  I omitted the allspice (not a fan) and instead of using coconut, I used raisins, which were lovely in the muffins.  For the drizzle on top, instead of buttermilk, I used lemon juice in it's place with the sugar and cinnamon.  Really lovely!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made a half batch of these and they made nine muffins, not twelve. That would have been a handy piece of information to have. I used all whole wheat flour, doubled the spices and cut the sugars down to half. I also omitted the coconut as my husband is allergic and I did not make the glaze. My family thought these were great and the extra sugar (or the glaze, for that matter) wasn't missed. Really moist and fluffy muffin. IMO, I think this might make better mini-muffins, especially for a brunch or Mom's Meetup.

I couldn't find my muffin tins so I used a bundt pan and called this Carrot Muffin Cake w/ Cinnamon glaze. I substituted finely chopped walnuts and a little oatmeal for the coconut since I didn't have any. Also, I used frozen pineapple pureed with Orange juice since I didn't have canned. Finally since I didn't own buttermilk, I used fat free vanilla yogurt mixed with a little half and half. This worked fine in both the cake and glaze. I had to double the cooking time but all and all I loved the result. Thanks for providing a great recipe for me to start from.

Delicious.  Tips for making them a bit healthier, but still moist and sweet:  I reduced brown sugar to a heaping 1/2 cup, white sugar to a heaping 1/3 cup, and reduced oil to 1/4 cup.  I also added 1/2 cup of raisins for an extra treat.

I made this because it seemed a little bit healthier than some of the other carrot cake recipes, but was dissapointed in not only the flavor but also the texture. It was definetly moist fut just didn't have any cakeness to it. I did not feel the glaze helped much either.

Overall these were pretty good muffins. The main thing i would change is to cut back on the sugar....they did seem excessively sweet. The flavor was good but almost sweeter than any carrot cake I have ever eaten. I did use fresh pineapple this could have caused some extra sweetness so maybe if I had stuck to canned...just not sure.

These baked beautifully. They sprung back after20 minutes in the oven. I used extra spice but I’d still like to taste it a little more. I used half whole wheat flour and half white. I didn’t have pineapple so I used peach fruit cups. I used 2/3 c of coconut and 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. I made a cream cheese frosting on one dozen and the cinnamon glaze on the second dozen.

I've actually made this recipe twice now, the muffins are spectacular. Although I think the key ingredients are the two sugars. I haven't used coconut, but have added walnuts and some chopped apple. The tablespoon of vanilla is also too much, it should just be a half. Also, I'll take it easy on the allspice next time too. I am a perfectionist with baking, and I must say, this recipe is pretty close to perfect.

We have made this a few times, and it has become our go to recipe for carrot cake. The only real changes I made were that I removed the pineapple due to an allergy and used craisins because that is what we had on hand. I usually just eyeball the spices and vanilla, and have doubled the carrot. I loved the glaze, as I am not a big fan of cream cheese frosting... While teaching my teenaged daughter to cook, I gave her this recipe to make, and I took some to work with me... my co-workers (construction workers) RAVED about them. So much so that when introduced to spouses at the Christmas party, the wives all said things like "So YOU'RE then one who made those!". THANK YOU so much for a delicious recipe!

I tried to adapt this recipe to a gluten-free recipe by substituting the flour with gluten free flour & adding Xanthan gum as a thickener; lets just say they were edible and gave a hint to what the possibility was of their potential. I need to try this again.

I made the recipe as written, but took the advice of some other reviewers and added five medium-sized carrots to emphasize the carrot taste.  I also added some raisins.  Although the bottoms of my muffins burned, I am laying that off to either my pans or too hot of an oven.  The taste and texture of these muffins is excellent.  I will be making them again.  Thanks for sharing!

Instead of oil, I add baby food carrots!  Still is very moist and makes more "carroty"

This looks so delicious and will attempt to make it...I have a question..would it be okay to use canned carrots(pureed) instead of the other igredient to make it moist, to get more of the carrot flavor in there?

I made these today, cutting the recipe in half. They tasted bland and called for too much pineapple. I omitted the coconut, and I'm glad I did, because that would of been an additional cost.

Delicious!  I substituted the oil for apple sauce and it made it light and fluffy!
