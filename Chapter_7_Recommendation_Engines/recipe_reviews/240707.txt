This was exactly the sauce flavor profile I was looking for! I halved the recipe, and it still filled a 16 oz jar to the top. I made it exactly as described except I added extra cayenne and Tabasco since we like it spicy. I used the sauce to marinade chicken, and then brushed it with the sauce while grilling. Even my picky kids loved it. This is a keeper for sure!

I made this to use on pulled pork sandwiches and got rave reviews!  I also used it on a veggie omelet and it was delicious.
