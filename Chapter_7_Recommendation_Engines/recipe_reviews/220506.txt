Had a bunch of leeks hanging around and wasn't sure what to make with them until I stumbled upon this recipe.  The soup was amazing! Used more leeks than called for since I wanted to use them up and added about a TBLS of red wine vinegar after it was done cooking to amp up the cream in the soup.  Will definitely be in our winter menu coming up.

Very tasty and popular with my family.  I used too much potato so it was thicker than I wanted.  Also I did not puree it enough.  I will make this again.

Dairy free version, just substitute Earth Balance buttery spread for the butter and unsweetened coconut milk for the cream.  I also added garlic. Even better the next day!

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it exactly as written and it was excellent. The second time I substituted the butter with olive oil and half and half for the heavy cream and it was just as good with these minor changes. This time I am adding the leftover ham I have in the freezer. Serving it with a loaf of pumpkin bread for a wonderful fall dinner.

This was very good! I made a few substitutions. I added half an onion to the leeks since I had some extra. I also used 1 percent milk and added a little roux to thicken, since I didn't have heavy cream and like to use what's on hand. When I added the milk I threw in a cup of cooked, chopped broccoli. I'm in college and don't own a blender or mixer, so I minced the leek and onion really small and used a potato masher. It came out a little chunky but I like it that way :)

Nice soup..Included bacon like my Dad used to .
Fry up 3 pieces of bacon (cut up into small pieces) -
When crispy remove and add 3 leeks - cleaned and thinly sliced into rounds - saute in bacon fat.. (about 2 tbsp.) x 10 minutes
Add potatoes cut up into quarters or 1/8ths - followed by 3 cans chicken broth.
Simmer x 30 min -then remove and puree 1/2 the soup - the other half a smoosh down a bit but leave pieces for texture. Added 1/2 cup Land o Lakes brand non-fat cream (half and half works too). 
If too thick (used a bit too many potatoes or they were a big size ) just thin down with a bit of chicken broth or a bit of water -

Kristen, I just wanted to take the time to THANK YOU for posting this!  It's an easy and truly awesome soup.  I hate it when people say, "it's great.....but only with these 1,000 changes", (although I do appreciate gentle tweaks) but I have to say I had everything except the cream and so I used the 1% milk I had on hand.....with trepidation.  This was not to purposely change your recipe, but rather a necessity and yet it was still fantastic!  I can only imagine what it would be like with cream.....yum!  Thanks again for sharing.

It was VERY thick.  I must have done something wrong.  I had to keep making adjustments to get it thinner.  I ended up serving it as a side dish of mashed potatoes and no one knew the difference.  I swear, though, that I followed the recipe!

This is one of my favorite winter time soups! I only used 3 leeks in stead of the 6 the recipe calls for and used a chopped onion in their place. I also added twice the amount of heavy cream to get a really creamy soup and left the skin on the potatoes, which gave the soup a "rustic" feel. 

There is nothing wrong with the original recipe and these changes aren't necessary to have a delicious finished product but they meet our tastes better so I thought I'd share!

Super easy, only had 3 Leeks but flavor still came through beautifully.   The only change I made purposely was using about 3 TBL of butter, just seemed the right thing to do for a potato soup ;) Thanks Kristen!

I bought some leeks on whim -- always wanted to try a Potato-Leek soup.  My only complaint is that I got less than 1/2 a bowl -- the family loved it.  I'd seen other recipes that called for cornstarch, but I found that pureeing a portion, as suggested, thickens it quite nicely.
There's no need to be exact in the proportions of ingredients ... I preferred a little more butter, and I didn't have 6 leeks on hand - only 4.  Will certainly make it again -- thanks.

This is a wonderfully hearty soup that I would've given 5 stars to if it had had a bit more zing.  I loved that it used two vegetables that I had in surplus and I'll certainly be making it again but it needs something to spice it up a bit.  I'm going to try some garlic and maybe a spice or two.  To keep it lighter, I used half & half as suggested by another.

I don't know if I used to big of a pan or what, but it seemed to cook down quite a bit.  Maybe I cooked it to long, but when I blended the soup, it was more like mashed potatoes.  No big, I just added more chicken stock to thin it before adding the cream.  It turned out great.

Delicious - you don't need a more complicated recipe than this.  Using salted butter to saute the leeks made it just right for my taste, so I would suggest salting to taste at the end.  For a lighter option you can skip the cream and it is still delicious.

Good tips on the reviews!  It needed some thinning, but that was easy.  I added smoked paprika for additional taste.  Will definitely make it again!

Just like my mom use to make when I was little.  My kids aren't big on pepper so I used just a touch for a bit of flavor and like many have said, salt to your taste.  Great recipe and very easy to prepare.

My leeks must be large and my potatoes small because I used 3 leeks and 8 potatoes and still had way more leeks than potatoes.  I also used a quart of chicken stock  and mashed the soup with a potato masher right in the pot.  It was delicious, though very onion-y.  Another reviewer suggested a dash of paprika and I had some smoked paprika, it was very good in this soup.  I served it with a sprinkle of chopped cooked (real) bacon bits.  One bowl was all I could eat!  Looking forward to the left-overs for lunch soon.

Delicious and easy.  I added some minced garlic and used vegetable broth instead of chicken.  My proportions were a little different, as I made a larger amount, so went by "feel".  I used some olive oil with the butter, substituted half & half for heavy cream, and added a generous dash of paprika & a little fresh grated black pepper.  Served with grated sharp cheddar.  I used a potato mashed instead of the blender.  Worked well with less mess.  My husband loved it.  Nice hearty winter soup!

VERRRY Thick!! Next time I would put in half of the potatoes. I would also add an onion and a clove of garlic which the leeks-after adding garlic powder later the flavor was closer to the taste of pot and leek soup I love from Ireland!

I added more stock (and used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian). I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used three leaks and a red onion to make up the difference. I also used red potatoes, added some frozen corn, and garlic. It was super easy and turned out great!

Delicious soup - and very few ingredients needed. I always leave out the salt, as it is unnecessary, and use my hand mixer to blend a bit in the pot. Great as frozen leftovers too. This recipe is a favourite in our house. Thanks!

I love this recipe!  I first made it with some leeks a friend gave me from her garden and it was outstanding.

At first I wasn't sure how many leeks to add, as leeks at the store vary in size, so I've measured it out and I use 6 cups of chopped leeks.  Then about 5 medium yukon gold potatoes.  I also use my immersion blender and just eyeball and puree half the pot.

I usually cook this without the cream as I can than freeze it (and I can keep it in the fridge without wondering if it's "gone off")  Then I usually just add in a couple tablespoons of cream or milk when I heat it up.

A fantastic recipe!  Thank you for posting it!

I made it without the cream just for the health factor and it still turned out great! Will definitely make again.

This is an excellent recipe which got very good reviews from my family.  I did substitute Knorr Vegetable Bouillon to make it vegetarian, used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream (probably close to a cup) and no salt (plenty in the bouillon).  Very nice!!!

Pretty good; i used half and half (probably about 3/4 cup) instead of heavy cream; added 2 T of Old Bay Seasoning and about 1/3 c of sherry.

Yum!! I tried potato leek soup for the first time a week ago at our local natural grocery store and have been craving it ever since. This turned out just like it, maybe even better! I'm happy to have found this recipe and can't wait to share with family and friends during the upcoming holidays.

Great soup! I only had 3 leeks, so I made a smaller batch. Also used a bit more butter than called for and added some chopped carrots. So good!

Awesome! I found that two of the big (1 1/2 in. leeks) were plenty.
