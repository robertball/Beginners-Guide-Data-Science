I made no changes to this recipe. Three onions is overkill. Better go with one onion or less cut in 1/2" or smaller pieces.  The sauce is awesome!  Next time, I will make more sauce, and add the cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking so it doesn't brown so fast.

I have made this recipe for many years and my Family requests it all the time. However, I make this recipe without the onions since my Family are not found of them. The other thing I do is add a little cheddar cheese in with the cream cheese and melt them both into the mixture. I will also mix a little cheddar cheese in with the toasted breadcrumbs and toss onto the top of casserole before baking. A bit of cayenne offers a slightly spicy version of this casserole.This casserole holds endless possibilities and it's very easy to make. It will continue to be a staple in my house. Enjoy...

I was looking for something to top baked potatoes with that wasn't made with processed cheese and used fresh broccoli. This recipe hit the mark on every level. The changes I made were to leave out the onions, microwave steam the broccoli, add the shredded cheese to the cream cheese mixture and omit the topping. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper and ground mustard. The family loved and I will definitely be making it again.

I softened almost caramelized the onions instead of boiling with broccoli.  Only used 2 large tablespoons of cream cheese and added 3 small eggs and extra milk before baking.  I cooled off veggies prior to adding eggs and milk.

I have made this recipe for years and a happy to have found it online for my digital recipe app. Every time I make this for family or functions itâ€™s a hit. If you are not fond of onions, alter according to your personal taste.  Other than that, I make it as the recipe reads.

Disappointed but will try it again with these changes.  Onions will be browned not boiled and in much smaller pieces

I decided to speed up the process. Steamed the broccoli in my microwave, made the cheese sauce on the stove top, adding in finely minced onions. Tossed in the steamed broccoli and then broiled. I wanted to do a face dive into the sauce...oh em yum!!!
