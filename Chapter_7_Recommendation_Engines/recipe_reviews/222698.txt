Super easy and delicious! I love this recipe because it allows you to make it as is, or, do  your own thang. Made this several times several ways. I prefer to saute my onions and garlic prior to adding the water and lentils.  But you won't go wrong here. And, you'll have leftovers if you make this your side dish. Yummy!

Yes boiled lentils on low just to cover the beans, diced some carrots and 1/4 cup of red onion , celery, a couple clove of garlic add to beans after about 20 min. Added a tsp of chicken bullion, salt, pepper, onion powder. Simmer 10 more min. At the end before serving added a drizzle of olive oil and couple tsp of butter. Let's just say they are all gone. My Husband loved them!! Will def do it all over.

I used black lentils which cook in 15-20 minutes so I put everything in at the same time and cooked for 20 minutes. The liquid was not quite all absorbed (again probably due to the black lentils) so I would reduce to 1 3/4 cups next time. Good hearty side dish! Thanks!!

Since I have a tendency to go a little overboard sometimes, I cut the recipe in half. I added too much water when it got too dry, so then it was too wet, so I added a cornstarch slurry to thicken it. I used dry cilantro and sauted the green onion, but pretty much did everything according to the directions. It was very tasty.
