My husband always buys the canned mix, but we will no longer! Very good & super easy. I only had to modify the recipe slightly because I didn't have time to go to the store & that was that I didn't have a pepper, so it was omitted & I used a 'hearty' tomato soup, which had some extra spices, not much though. Although, the pepper would have only made it better!

Super easy and so yummy! I left out the green pepper, since my little ones don't care for it. I loved the cumin in it! I went ahead and used a whole two cans of tomato soup, so none would go to waste, and it was just perfect.

This turned out really well!  I substituted a cayenne and cubanelle pepper for the green pepper and celery.  I also used fake meat instead of ground beef chuck, but nonetheless it turned out great.

I didn't care for these at all. I will eat it, but won't make these again. These were bland and just didn't have much flavor. Something was off, but I culdn't figure out what. Maybe the condensed soup taste? The celery? I'm not sure what wasn't right exactly. These had no tang, no zip, no spice, no taste, basically. I simmered this for an hour so the flavor could have time to develop. Sorry to give such a poor review, these are edible but I will not be looking forward to finishing what is left. With all the high ratings I expected more, but maybe it's just me since other reviewers seemed to be pleased with this recipe. I'm glad I cut this in half! Thanks anyway, I enjoyed trying a new recipe. Cooking is such a grand adventure!

Tip:  If you are thinking of leaving out a veggie because your kids don't like peppers, onions, celery, etc, try putting them in the blender.  They get all the nutrition and don't even know it!  Also, I used 4 tomatoes instead of soup and just pureed all the veggies together.  YUM!  So many invisible veggies!

Delicious!  I did find it a little bland following the recipe exactly so I added 2tbsp bbq sauce and 2tbsp ketchup and it was perfect!  I find the store bought versions too sweet so this was a nice change.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a good base.  You will need to add a lot of spices for it to taste like anything.  I added mustard (prepared and dry) vinegar, salt, pepper, garlic and weber's gourmet burger seasoning.

I am giving this 4 stars because the kids loved it.  It is a very mild recipe and I was heavy handed with the cumin and Wor. sauce.  Mild has its place though.  I did omit the green bell peppers and celery because none of us care for them.

This is just ok. I need to add ingredients to give it a little tang. I added more Worcestershire, a little chili powder, brown sugar and a little brown sugar.  I think it's the celery that I'm not crazy about. I will stick with my mom's recipe for sloppy joes from the 50"s.

Easy & quick, had everything on hand except onion so just added a little onion powder and I mixed the cheese in while it was cooking.  I served it on top of Texas Toast. Yum!!  I tricked my picky 7 yr old by telling him it was a cheeseburger with ketchup and cheese already in it.

I liked how it included so many veggies but the taste of the sauce was extremely bland. They weren't the worst thing I've ever had but I certainly wouldn't do it again.

It was just OK.  Rather bland and needed a hint of sweet.  Even my hubbie who doesn't like most things sweet agreed.

I'm looking for something tangy and sweet.  This just wasn't it for me.  No one in the family wanted to eat it.  The only thing I liked about it was the onion, green pepper, and celery.  I will just have to keep searching for something closer to the Manwich taste.

Excellent reciepe.  Make it all the time.  Changed it up a bit to suit my tastes.  Took out the onion, green pepper and celery and added diced jalapenos and crushed red pepper to give it a little extra kick.

This recipe was a hit with my guests...though it was a little bland, so I added in 1/2c chunky salsa which gave it a great flavor! And for a Gluten Free version - try eating with tortilla chips instead of the bun, delicious!

these were fantastic! 
However, I had no tomato soup - only cream of tomato, and after using the two soups on two diff nights, I found using cream of T soup was better

This was delicious.  After I made it, I was afraid the kids would balk at the amount of green pepper since that is one vegetable they don't like, but they never said a word and gobbled it down and even asked for seconds!  I only had one can of tomato soup, so I substituted Ketchup and a squeeze of yellow mustard for the remaining 1/2 can of soup.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this in the slow cooker, browning meat and then stirring everything together in the cooker.  It was very good, we were having a family gathering and almost everyone had seconds.  I omitted green pepper, cuz I can't stand it, and I added a little minced garlic, doubled the recipe and used half ground turkey.  I ran the crockpot on high for 3-1/2 hours and held it on warm for another hour.  It was excellent and I would make it again, I had several comments that this was way better than the canned stuff!

The name suits these well.  I hate all the Sloppy Joe mixes that are in the stores but my husband is always asking me to make them, so when I saw this recipe, I was eager to give it a try.  I followed the directions exactly and my entire family LOVED these Sloppy Joes!!  The only modification I made (and recommend) is placing the buns under the broiler, which not only toasts them slightly but also allows the cheese to melt more evenly (whatever you do...don't leave out the cheese!!)  DELISH!

Awesome recipe.  No more need for the canned stuff.  Whole family liked it especially my 5 year old.

Didn't have green pepper but can only imagine that it would have been better with it.  Guess I'll have to find out next time.

Thanks for a recipe that lives up to its name.

Great Sloppy Joes!  The whole family loved them. Perfect meat mixture and taste.
