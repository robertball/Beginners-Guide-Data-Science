The footnotes stated you could use beer in place of the club soda and that is exactly what I did. Made as written and this worked good for me. I was amazed at how brown such a little bit of soy sauce and sesame oil  made the batter. Those two ingredients also came though in taste and added such nice flavor. Great recipe and one I will use again!

I did not use the soda water but substituted beer as one reviewer suggested.  Flavor was great as state but made the batter too heavy even though thebeer  was ice cold.  Will use straight water next time and let you all know.
