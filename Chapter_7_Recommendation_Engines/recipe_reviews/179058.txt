This was a great soup. I did add some sesame oil to the beef while frying and then added some mushrooms in the end but all in all it was colorful, light, and tasty and one I will make often.

Great! We added a tablespoon of Hoisin sauce at the end, and it really kicked it up a notch. Fast and easy recipe.

Although time consuming itâ€™s easy to make.  What a great taste.  Everything just blends in.  I used Toasted Sesame Seed Oil instead of Olive Oil, it really spiced it up.

It was good, but it became great when we added pearl onions and spiced it up with crushed red pepper.

Great recipe! I replaced the steak and beef broth with chicken and chicken broth. Took the advice of other reviewers and added a tbsp each of hoisin sauce and sesame oil. Awesome! I also topped it off with fresh bean sprouts, basil, cilantro and green onion before serving. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Sorry but the beef soup was too bland for my taste.  Next time I'll try with chichen broth & chichen.

This really lacked flavor. Pretty boring.
