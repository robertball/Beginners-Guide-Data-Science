I needed to know how long to cook black rice, since this was my first time.  I needed to know if it would be compatible with cooking half Cal Rose rice with it and it was.  I doubled this recipe and used coconut oil instead of butter with roughly-chopped 1/2 cup of whole almonds.   Put paper towels on the counter, in the area that the ventilation "spits" the steam, if you're using a rice cooker.

The greenery is not addressed but I used parsley.  We all loved the deep and savory flavor.  Excellent with Encrusted Pork Loin and a garden salad.  A Merlot balances well with this meal as the encrusting was Rosemary, Basil and Dijon Mustard.  With the savory rice a full bodied wine is needed.

Had never cooked with black rice before. Followed recipe but omitted almonds. Took longer than 30 minutes for liquid to be absorbed. Very purple-y and tasty! Served with baked pork chops and a green salad. Will make it again! Thank you.

This is delicious. I used red onion and a few garlic cloves. It has such a great juxtaposition of chewy rice texture  with a smooth background of onion and garlic. So different from other rices.

Wow!  What a great side dish.  I made to go with grilled fish.  The color was fabulous!  Will be on my rotation for healthy sides!

I had never heard of black rice before therefore had no clue how to cook it.  When I followed the directions on the bag, it came out hard. Found this little gem of a recipe and it did not disappoint.  Now on to try my red rice!

Absolutely delish!  I added some diced red pepper and about a 1/4 cup of whole kernel corn then topped with some fresh cilantro!   Looking forward to making this again

This definitely took more than 30 minutes--45 minutes for the rice to absorb all the water. It was very tasty, perhaps only needed some salt. Thank you for sharing!

The second time I made this I put all the ingredients in my Quisinart pressure cooker on high for 1 minute and then let the pressure bleed off my itself. It cooked perfectly with the grains splitting open but retaining good texture. I cook it this way all the time now.

Different. It tastes almost creamier or sweeter than regular rice. I don't think I'd use as many almonds though because I don't think they're really necessary but a few are good. Can't wait to try in a fried rice dish. We had this as a side dish for Swai fish from this site. It did need to cook longer but that is not a big thing if you know that ahead, but since this was our 1st time our dinner come out all together for the meal.

This was absolutely delicious.  It is very good without changes but I always add garlic when I add onion because we love it.  I will make this again and again.

Loved it! Quick and easy to make.  As I didn’t have  the chicken bouillon I put in some Jamaican pepper to enhance the taste. Delicious!,,

I add the finished rice to a pan of sliced chicken and cubed veggies (carrots, celery, pea pods, peas etc), soy sauce to make fried rice.
