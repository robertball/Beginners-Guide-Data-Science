Excellent, and even my extremely picky husband loved it. I didn't have carrots so used green peppers, which made for a great taste combination -- they were a bit soggy after simmering and baking, though, so next time I'll hold off on adding them until the last couple minutes of simmering prior to adding the beef. I find that the bouillon is salty enough that the salt can be omitted from the recipe. Because we like cheese, I added a bit more than the recipe calls for.

This came out quite good, and it was so fragrant while cooking, but I think I might add more basil, garlic and cheese next time.  I cooked a chopped onion with the ground beef instead of using dried onion, and because many reviewers had great luck with green pepper, I also chopped some into the ground beef.  I'm definitely adding this to my weeknight repertoilre!

I didn't have any carrots so I altered it by putting in half a bag of frozen corn and a can of black beans. I also didn't have any garlic cloves so I used 2 Tbsp of Cholula roasted chili garlic powder, montreal steak seasoning, and oregano. I also so used doble the cheese (1/2 chedder and 1/2 mozzerella). It came out amazing and is something my family will be eating many more times.

This was average.  It wasn't spectacular, but I wasn't expecting it to be, either.  I knew my family wouldn't like the carrots, so I subbed green peppers instead.  Then it was kind of like my stuffed peppers recipe, only without the diced tomatoes and worcestershire sauce.  While we were eating, everyone felt it was missing something and we figured out that it was that we were expecting the taste of the peppers!  So next time I'm not in a cooking mood, I'll probably make this again and add another green pepper (I only used 1 this time), a can of diced tomatoes and a splash of worcestershire sauce.  I had no problems with the rice cooking or being mushy in the end.  The cooking time was good!

This was pretty good.  It smelled absolutely fantastic too as it was cooking.  My boyfriend kept popping into the kitchen to see what it was.  We did add extra cheese though and we used cheddar and mozzarella.

Yummy! The only thing I did different was add a can of diced tomatoes and green pepper. Oh, and I used way more cheese (pepper jack, mozzarella, and cheddar).  Fiancee LOVED it!! I also browned the rice in olive oil instead of butter.

I liked this for something quick and filling on a weekday. With that being said I did lighten up the saturated fat, as I do on all recipes. I also just made it all on the stove top to save time and dishes. For the meat I used lean beef. I also used light butter and 50% less fat Cabot cheddar cheese I grated. I thought the shredding of the carrots didn't look right so I cut them in very small match stick sized pieces. After the rice was done I just added the beef to the pan. I used a pan with 3" sides to hold everything. When the beef was done I added the liquid ingredients and cooked on med-high for 10 minutes until it was thick. I thought the herb taste was a tad stronger than I expected. I added a pinch or two of garlic salt and onion powder and seemed to balance it. I also thought it was a little salty from the boullion so, if I make it again, I will use a low sodium one.

This was a really good recipe but I think the spices need to be tweaked a little. There was too much of something and not enough of something else!

I thought this recipe was great, and my husband really enjoyed it too. He is a fairly picky eater and finding foods that he will eat has proved rather challenging. When I made this, I substituted the carrots with onion and used 1 cup of cheddar and 1 cup of mozzarella. This is definitely something that I will be making again!

Good but I think it would be better if you added green peppers. Also, it was easy in all. Good I guess...

We liked this! I chopped my carrots instead of shredding because I wasn't sure the kids would eat shredded. I added pepper and 1/2 cup chopped onion to the ground beef. This was kind of like a rice a roni dinner, but better.

We don't eat beef, so I used ground pork and chicken bouillon. Also, had some leftover Chinese carryout rice from day before, so just used that and cut down on the water to about 1 cup. Served over canned stir fry vegetables and it was very good. No extra salt needed, the bouilion has enough

Nothing flashy.  My family tends to prefer seasoning that smacks you in the face as you eat it... and this was a little bit bland for their tastes.  But, everything cooked together well.. thanks for sharing!

I thought this recipe was great - not very quick but that is understandable.  Tasty with a side of veggies - (I omitted the carrots in the dish).  I too added more cheese then what it called for.  Delish!

I had to make a few substitutions because I didn't have everything at home and no time to run out and grab stuff. I thought it came out very good the rice was done just right and it had a very nice flavor. I will make this again.

Thanks!

Great as is, would be even better with a bit more kick.  Next time will add some cajun seasoning to the meat while cooking.  I think that's all it needs.  I made with brown rice.  After adding the 3 cups of water to the rice & garlic, I let simmer/slow boil for 25 minutes, then added the rest of the ingredients per the recipe, but added 1 more cup of water.  Followed recipe after that.  Turned out great!

I loved this recipe-the only reason why I am giving it four stars is because after the casserole was baked, I couldn't see or taste the carrots.  The beef is wonderfully seasoned.
