I am not much of a wine person and didn't have any on hand, but we had the other ingredients and used water instead of wine, and added freshly ground black pepper.  It was FANTASTIC.  We used it on hamburger steaks and my whole family loved it and wanted more.  So simple, yet so delicious!!

I'm so glad I tried this! I was wary after reading some of the reviews. I wanted a different sauce to go with the meatballs I just made-i'm tired of going with marinara or swedish. I found this and figured I didn't have much to lose. It is so good! I switched the wine for beef broth, it's the only change I made. Tastes like the gravy you'd get in a country cooking restaurant, and made my kitchen smell so good! This is a keeper, thanks!

I was trying to find a quick easy recipe for mushroom/brown gravy since I was short on time.  I made this recipe to the "T" and all I can say is, that next time I will be doing my own recipe, time and all.  Sorry, I hate to give negative reviews, but I also hate to throw away perfectly good food and wine!

This is very good. I always used the 50 cent package gravy mixes where you add water, and this is simple and easy and tasty.

Made it according to the recipe.  It tasted like canned gravy with canned condensed soup mixed in.  I'm not planning to make it again...ever.

This is so tasty and easy, much better than using dripping and flour or corn starch to make gravy. Tasted WONDERFUL over potatoes.

Made this to go with leftovers and it was so so. Too much Marsala and definitely does not need any more salt.

I thought this gravy tasted terrible. WAY too much wine in this recipe-- It overpowered all of the other ingredients and had too much of a tang for me.

I made as is.  It has too much Marsala for my taste with turkey. .  It has good taste, but next time, I'll cut  back to half and add more if needed

We didnâ€™t care for the wine taste in the gravy. Would either use way less, or substitute beef stock instead. Otherwise a good idea for a quick base gravy.

The amount of wine in the recipe would require 1/2cup of salt to remotely work. So I used only 1/4 cup of Cabernet Sauvignon. The resulting color was a little on the pink side. Still worked well and was flavorful but not outstanding. Next time I will use some kind of stock instead of the wine.
