Mmm, love turnip soup! With cornbread. I modified somewhat using what I had on hand (1 northern, 1 black-eyed, 1 pinto) and a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of the vegetable mix. Love the combination of spices in this soup.

Delicious! Great on a cold winter day. I have been making this for some time and everyone that has tried it loved it. I don't use the pepper sauce since I use hot sausage but that is just my preference.

I made this in my Instant Pot and was delighted with it. I used dry beans and fresh turnip  greens.  I made it again and added some fresh corn from my freezer and it was even better! Six stars from me!

Took this to a church pot luck and it got great reviews. I omitted the tabasco and added shredded chicken and purple hull peas and a little okra. Make sure to use low sodium broth, I didn't and it was a little too salty.

Surprisingly, it was a great soup.  I was  not a fan of turnips , this  soup gives me options to eat turnips. I made some modifications based on what was in my kitchen at the time, that was similar to what the receipe called for.  Therefore I gave it four stars though it was equal to five. Since I made changes I couldn't rate it higher.

I got fresh turnips from  a local
Produce group I'm a part of...so this recipe was perfect for the beautiful greens!  I used my crockpot & cooked on low all day.  I also added some leftover chicken.

I got this recipe by way of my sister. It sounded strange  but it is so easy and so good.  It's also very forgiving if you make any changes in the ingredients to accommodate what you have in the pantry. Love it!

I love some turnip greens but in soup?  Really?  Really!!  I loved it.  DH isn't any kind of green fan BUT he even liked it.  I read the reviews & added a can of Rotel and frozen corn.  Couldn't find pork Kielbasa so it was turkey for us.  Served it with cornbread sticks to totally blow my diet.  The only thing I will do different next time is double the amount of Kielbasa and quarter the slices--the 1" chunks were too large.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!  My only changes were that I used frozen turnips and added fresh cut corn.  This is the second time I’ve made this, and I plan to make it a lot more in the future.

One of my favorite soups.  I had cajun sausage on hand so I did not add any hot sauce.  Very good recipe.  Will make again and again.
