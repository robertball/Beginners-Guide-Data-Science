This was a HUGE hit at the 4th of July barbeque I brought it to. I've tried some of the other fruit pizza recipes and have these comments - the cream cheese and marshmallow combination is by far the best of all the recipes, there is no need for any type of glaze on this - it is perfectly sweet without it, and finally, I find store bought sugar cookie dough to be the easiest to work w/ and tastes/sets up the best (I think the dough recipe ones taste too much like cream of tartar). I let the dough cylinder get to almost room temp, then shaped into a disk, placed saran wrap on top and rolled it/pressed it on the pizza pan. Baked until entire top was light brown and let it cool completly before spreading chilled cream cheese mixture on top. I think chilling the final product in the fridge (for around 5 hours in my case) helped the taste of this pizza as well. Used blueberries and sliced strawberries for the fruit.

This is such a great recipe - and an even better crowd pleaser!  I've been making Fruit Pizza similar to this for about 15 years now, and each time I know it will be enjoyed by everyone.  You can make it year-round, and vary the fruits depending on the season.  I've found that canned sliced pineapple (drained), canned sliced peaches, bananas, strawberries and kiwi are a great combination.  The key to keeping the fruit fresh (especially the bananas) is to pour a lemon sauce all over the top after you've assembled everything.  This "sets" the fruit and keeps things fresh.  The sauce is the pineapple juice, 1/3 cup real lemon juice, and 1/4 cup sugar.  Heat and stir until this boils, then slowly stir in cornstarch (that's been dissolved in a little cold water).  Cool completely.  In fact, if you make this first, it will be cooled by the time you're ready for it.  You want the consistency of this syrup to be sorta thick like kayro syrup.  Pour over fruit and then refrigerate a couple of hours.  Also, the Fruit Pizza does well made in a rectangle pan, too.  It's easier to serve, and can be made to be as attractive as a round pizza is!  Either way, it's a great treat for everyone you serve it to!

I really love fruit pizza.  A variation for the "sauce" is cream cheese and whipped cream (instead of marshmallows) and also, adding a glaze of boiling orange juice and sugar over the top of the pizza allows you to use fruit such as bananas and apples and keep them from browning.

Absolutely Delicious!!  I cannot believe how good this tasted. And it's soooo simple. I added a dash of almond extract to the cream cheese mixture and topped it off with apple pie filling and a dusting of cinnamon.  I sliced my cookie dough into rounds and pressed them together in a well greased pizza pan.  This recipe is so versatile and would work great with just about any combination of fruit.  I'm definitely going to play around with this one in the future.  Thanks Lois for a perfect ending to any meal!!

My mother in law gave me this recipe. I sometimes make it with frozen chocolate cookie dough as the crust. Kids love this. I prefer the suger cookie crust because of the sweetness. For a romantic valentines "pizza" follow the recipe, use only strawberries and drizzle with melted chocolate.

Yum!!  Everyone LOVED this recipe!!  I used the pre-formed cookie dough instead of making a sheet.  Worked great for mini pizzas.  Will definately make this again!

Wonderful!!  I made these for a Home and Garden Party and they were a great hit!!  I baked them in a 9x13-inch baking dish, so it took a little longer than 10 minutes to bake the cookie crust.  I topped it with strawberries, kiwi, fresh pineapple, and drained mandarin oranges.  Will definately make this recipe again!!!!  Thanks Lois for the great recipe!!

Everyone loved this!  I used 2 packages of the store bought dough, and made it in a rectanglular cookie sheet.  I used kiwi, strawberries, bananas and garnished with blueberries and blackberries.  I also used the glaze that was made with 1/2c. orange juice, 2 T. lemon juice, 1T. cornstarch, 1/4 c. water and 1/2c. sugar.  It made it nice and shiny and stopped the bananas from browning.  It went over VERY well at the baby shower I made it for.

I like it with the marshmellow creme - very good.  I used strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, pineapple chunks, mandarin oranges, and bananas (dipped in lemon juice and they didn't brown at all!).  I used a pizza stone and rubbed a light layer of oil on before adding the cookie dough.  I did use a glaze and it was yummy.  I mixed 1/2 c sugar with 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch, 1 cup of orange-pineapple juice, and 1 tsp of lemon juice.  I brought it to a boil and cooked until thickened which took no time at all.  I used a pastry brush to brush it on all over.

The marshmallow creme and cream cheese make the best tasting spread I've ever had on fruit pizza!!  You can cut down on the calories a bit by using the lower-fat cream cheese (also known as Neufchatel cheese). We used Betty Crocker Sugar Cookie Mix (2 pkgs.) instead of refrigerated cookie dough, and we baked it in a jelly roll pan because we wanted to serve it to quite a few people. (For a regular pizza pan, 1 package would work fine unless you like your crust really thick.) Please follow the instructions for whatever cookie mix/dough you decide to use regarding greasing your pan.  Some say to grease; some don't. You will have better results if you do what the package or recipe says.  This recipe is somewhat versatile; you can use just about any fruit you want, and arrange it in any way you like. This makes a beautiful and yummy dessert! I highly recommend using the Cookie Mix or a really good homemade cookie recipe for this--you will not be sorry, and anyone you serve it to will rave!

I'd like to think of myself as a good and/or fairly experienced cook, but I had trouble with this.  The cookie dough was very sticky and hard to spread evenly in the pan (I even tried using a rolling pin, but that didn't work.)  My "crust" was perfect on the edges, but not done in the center because it was not spread evenly enough.  Maybe my dough was too warm and should have been colder to start with?  Then it stuck to the pan badly like another reviewer said, and crumbled and cracked when I carefully tried to pry it off.  I ended up throwing the whole thing away because it could not be salvaged.  Parts that WERE edible were delicious, though.  I will try this again but will make the actual cookies first, and will then "frost" each one and add the fruit to make little individual fruit pizzas.

I made this lastnight for a tailgating party today.  It went very well and everyone ate it all up!  (I'm kinda disappointed there aren't any left overs!)

I added a tbsp. of rum extract to the marshmellow cream/cream cheese mixture.

I used coconut, kiwi, strawberries, and blueberries as the fruit.  This was delicious. I especially liked the coconut.

I also made this in a 9x13 pan.

Enjoy!

I followed the directions exactly and got a wonderful, beautiful impressive dessert to take to a gathering of friends!  Everyone loved it (and they are all excellent cooks).  I used halved red grapes, kiwi, blueberries, sliced strawberries and brushed it with heated apricot jam thinned with a little lemon juice...oh yeah!

Unbelievable! I topped with strawberry slices and mandarin orange slices. Awesome. I made this for a party expecting 10 people and only 4 of us were there. Good thing nobody else came because we ate it all!

This is an easy, quick and tasty recipe.  Try adding 1 - 2 Tbsp. of Amaretto to the marshmallow and cream cheese mixture.  It adds a light and delicious flavor!  Also, this mixture makes a great fruit dip on its own, especially when served with strawberries.

I thought this would be very good, but it wasn't.  I might have messed up with the cookie dough though.  I think the cookie dough crust made it too sweet, it also ended up very doughy in the middle (could be my oven / pan).  The cream cheese was just to much, and I love cheese. I topped it with all kind of fruit, and I would have rather enjoyed the fruit in a bowl.  I don't think I will be making this again.

YuMMMY! - check out my photo of this treat! For fruit I used: Peaches, Blueberries, Strawberries, Raspberries, and Pineapple!  I made this to accompany ChaCha's White Chicken Chili. It was to die for! Make sure the cream cheese has ample time to soften before mixing it with the marshmallow spread though, it was a little chunky even after using a mixer on  the highest speed... HOWEVER - it tasted purrrfect, regardless. I WILL be making this again.. its so easy and great for a small soiree!

This was great, but don't try to make ahead like I did, fruit got yucky.  It's much better if you cut the fruit and eat right away.  You can make the cookie crust and filling ahead, then just cut fruit and assemble just before eating.  Also it's pretty sweet all on its own.  The first time I made it I put a glaze on the fruit and it did not need it at all.  Over all VERY yummy.

This is really simple and really good.
I added a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste and 1/4 teaspoon fiori di sicilia flavoring to the cream cheese marshmallow creme mixture which carried it to new heights.  I'll be making this to take to our family's Mother's Day party this Sunday- 17 year old son suggested it as a sure hit- he liked it so much :)
Yummy!!!

This was the perfect and unique dessert for my father's birthday! It was SO easy to make, and to make it slightly healthier, I used low-fat cream cheese instead of regular. I also melted dark chocolate chips and skim milk in a saucepan and added that on the bottom layer before the marshmallow creme/cream cheese mixture!

This is always such a big hit! I made individual cookies instead of a whole pizza. Much easier that way. Made them for Easter. They were the first thing gone!

Great taste - VERY simple to make.  Add the fruit - and you look like a pro!!!  Must use Marshmallow CREAM - NOT FLUFF!!!  (Definately need to have a sweet tooth for this one, though!)

This was a very good, quick and easy recipe, definitely a keeper. Make sure the cookie crust is cooked all the way through to the center. Very easy, kids would love to help make this one in the kitchen. You may want to use a little flour or oil so the dough does not stick to your hands or the rolling pin.

I have made this several times now and always get raves and many recipe requests! It's so easy to make! My favorite way to create it is with strawberries and blueberries and make the American Flag with the fruit.  Any fruit combination is fun and tasty.  Bananas are tricky though.  They tend to turn brown, even after the lemon trick!  This recipe is a definate keeper!

I love this recipe.   I made it with cut up applies and then I sprinkled chocolate chips and sliced almonds and drizzled with butterscotch topping and it was a pizza with everything.  Everyone loved it.

A great easy recipe.  I used Cool Whip instead of the marshmallow creme for a little lighter texture.  I added my fruits and put a strawberry glaze over all and it was wonderful.

Yummy! Made this for my Office Christmas Breakfast. It is beautiful and everyone loved it! I made a glaze to keep my fruits from browing! The glaze is 1 c Sugar, 3 tbs cornstarch, 1/4 cold water, 1 cup orange juice, pinch of salt. Stir all ingredients together and bring to a boil for 1 minute. Allow to coold down before spreading over Fruit! Chilled Pizza for 1 hour before serving!

This was pretty good and you absolutely can't beat the convenience! I made a few different batches of fruit pizzas trying to find the best recipe for the event they were for, and this was the first one I made. Like I said, they were pretty good. And they definitely were the easiest to throw together!

This was awesome & a huge hit.   I will try the other recipe next time using cool whip vs. marshmallow creme just to determine the difference.

Simple, fast, versatile and delicious. This was an instant favorite amongst family and friends. If you found the recipe a little too sweet(as I did) try cutting back on the amount of marshmallow creme by half, use a couple of extra tablespoons of cream cheese to make up for the difference in volume. This recipe should also be eaten the same day it's prepared, otherwise the sugars in the topping will cause the fruit to macerate making for a soupy mess. Great recipe

Made this for a fantastic-family-dessert, they deserve it! It was SO delish.  We ate our peices & the kids could not wait until tomorrow when they could eat another!  My husband said his was even better in his lunchbox the next day!  Soooooo delicious, so recommended!  This would be a fun party dessert! We're thinking of making veggie-pizza & this fruit pizza for a picnic/ potluck next time!  Very impressive.

This was great!  I used strawberries, bananas, kiwi, blackberries, raspberries, and peaches.  I only had a few blueberries, so I scattered them over the pizza.  I drizzled powdered sugar mixed with water, and t. lemon juice over fruit.  Then lightly sprinkled coconut flakes over that.  Everyone at our meeting loved it.  Will definitely make this again.  The marshmallow with the cream cheese makes all the difference!

This recipe is a winner!!!! I made one for a Bunko gathering and it was gone in 10 minutes. I had to make another and they ate that too!! Try topping with strawberries, blueberries,raspberries,and pineapple.  I also tinted the second spread with 1/4 cup, canned mandarine orange juice, which flavored it slightly and added a light tint to the spread. ***Hint!!!*** mix the cream cheese until smooth. then add the marshmallow fluff!

Great recipe! I made this fruit pizza for an office meeting and a birthday party and people loved it. I made mine on a 10x15 jelly roll pan. I have no marshmallow creme so I followed the "Marshmallow Ice Cream Topping" recipe of Kristil and mixed it with the Cream Cheese..and it came out great. Although I found this a bit too sweet, it goes well with the fruit toppings such as strawberries (wc is a bit sour) and other fresh fruits. It goes well also with canned blueberry/apple/strawberry/cherry pie fillings.

I saw this recipe and decided to cut out one step by getting the sugar cookies pre-formed in the refrigerated section of my local grocery store. I wanted to make individual servings for about 50 people so after I baked the sugar cookies according to the package directions, I whipped the spread together then topped each little cookie with one blue berry, one raspberry, and one blackberry. They looked so cute and my guests enjoyed them with ease as I was out and about entertaining. :)

A tasty recipie but the sauce is overpowering and tastes too much like cheese, next time I make it I will try a different topping.  I ended up scraping the topping off and I just ate the cookie crust and fruit.  For the cookie crust I used Betty Crocker dry sugar cookie mix and it worked just as well. Kiwi, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, mango, and cherries are all my favorites for this recipie. The difference in tastes and textures of the fruit complimented the sugary melt in your mouth cookie.  In all, everything about this recipie is great, besides the cream cheese and marshmallow cream topping.  I found it to be a very filling and pleasing recipe.  It is also a good thing to make if you need to bring a tray to a party or get together.  TASTE THE SAUCE BEFORE PUTTING IT ON THE PIZZA!!!!!!!
That is all.

We eat this at the fire station all the time because it's so easy. The other recipes have me putting on this "glaze" that seems to take forever and the marshmallow is just as good. Thanks for posting this and making my life a little sweeter and easier Lois.

This pizza is amazing! I made it for my daughter who never will eat fruit. I told her that it was really, really yummy and she took a bite, made a weird face and then said "This is SOOO yummy momma!" She then went ahead and ate 3 pieces. I put on blueberries,strawberries, kiwi, raspberries and peaches. I will definitely make these again!

Not bad, but the marshmallow creme mixture was a bit bland. I liked it better after I folded in about 2/3 c. Cool Whip and some lime zest. For the cookie base, I used "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" from this site. Yum!

I made these for a recent get-together and the entire pizza was gone in 15 minutes! They couldn't get enough of them. I used strawberries, bananas, and kiwi for the fruit. To keep the bananas from turning brown, I used a mixture of confectioner's sugar and a dash of orange juice.

The cream cheese and marshmallow cream are great together but it needed something else.  I added the glaze from this site's Fruit Pizza II and it was perfect.

I've had several fruit pizzas made with Cool Whip, but the combination of fluff and cream cheese is so much better.  I used grapes, kiwi, star fruit (carambola), and mangoes.  Got rave reviews at a staff luncheon.

This was good, at first I had a little trouble rolling out the cookie dough, but then I sprinkled powdered sugar on my pizza pan and also on top of my dough and it helped with the stickiness.  I also had to cook the dough for more like 22 minutes to get the center cooked.  Was a hit at my gathering.

I shared this at a gathering in which others also brought fruit pizza.  This was a hit - and so very easy.  I doubled the recipe and put it on a large cookie sheet, I did make the glaze, but it would have been fine without it as well.  I will cut back a little on the marshmellow creme next time and supplement with cream cheese.  Also added 1 tsp. of almond flavoring.  VERY GOOD!

I made this recipe for an office fund-raiser and it was the first thing to go.  Some people bought two or three pieces.  I used grapes, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.  I thought it was a little too sweet.  Probably will cut in smaller pieces next time I make it.

Tried this the 1st time with the marshmallow creme and it was sickeningly sweet. Tried again with a mixture of light cool whip and one container of lowfat lemon yogurt and it was so much better. Jazzy

My only complaint is that the dough is very challenging to work with. I sprinkled a little bit of flour on the pan, hands, and dough. That seemed to help with some of the stickiness. 

The final result was wonderful. I will definitely make this again. Everyone loved it.

Everyone raved about the taste and presentation (ages 10-60 loved it).  I made the mistake of using thawed frozen fruit and after sitting out for awhile, the crust was really soggy.  Fresh fruit next time!  It was still delicious, easy, tantalizing when I set it out and everyone saw it - they immediately wanted some.  I would also recommend rolling the cookie dough out as thin as possible without separating.

Really delicious, cookie needs to be cooked longer, it was so soft it was crumbling and cracking before I could even serve it. I also suggest adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cream cheese/marshmallow mixture. Over all, taste was fantastic, got lots of compliments. Thanks

I tried this as is, and I found it a little bit too sweet, especially when I'm entertaining more-health conscious or diabetic friends.  Now, when I make it, I use the refrigerated cresent rolls as a base and sometimes I fiddle around with the cream cheese mix -- I've tried combining it with a little bit of instant vanilla pudding mix and cool whip instead of the marshmellow.  I also add a glaze on top made of orange juice and unflavoured gelatin.  It's really hard to go wrong with this recipe!

I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the filling and divided the dough into two pie pans. That way I could make two mini pizzas with different fruit toppings.

This was absolutely delicious and so simple! I made one for my sister for her 13th birthday and all of her friends preferred it over store-bought icecream cake, which completely surprised me (you know how fussy they are at that age). I will be making this again and again!

I didn't like the marchmellow creme and cream cheese combination very much, so I give this a three stars. I can't say much about the dough because its bought or the fruit since people like diffrent things, but over all I would say its okay.

So good, so easy. I wanted to make 'personal' pizzas for an in-home party, so just sliced two cookie logs to make individual cookies (got 16 per log) and even they were kinda big. Only made one batch of the spread and didn't even use all of it. Chopped up strawberries, kiwi and pineapple and mixed with blueberries before sprinkling on top of the cookies prepped with the spread. Any fruit combination would be divine. Thanks!

Really good spread, but a little over sweet with cookie crust, will consider different crust next time or less jet puffed marshmallow creme.

Easy and delicious!  I did make my own golden oreo crust using 1 and a half packs of golden oreos.  Just stick them in the food processor and mix with 5-6 tbs of melted butter. Press into the pan, bake 10 mins at 350.  Everyone loved it!

My First time trying Fruit Pizza. This was a very easy recipe.  And I had a nice result... the pizza looked great.  I cut the slices before adding the creme and fruit.  My family liked it but it was too sweet for me.

VERY sweet. But it was super easy. I prefer less sugar in the foods I give to my kids, so I may try the refrigerated croissant dough as a crust instead of the sugar cookie.

This is delicious~ I used blueberries, strawberries and kiwi's.  It also took me a little longer than 10 mins to bake the crust.  Its look really pretty when it is finished and it is very simple to make!

I followed other suggestions and used saran wrap to spread out the dough - it made it so much easier.  Cool the cookie before putting the topping on.  I froze the leftovers and they were so delicious right out of the freezer - a nice treat on a hot day.  This is a sure hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe and it is so easy.

This is my kids favorite! I took and added melted chocolate on the crust after it cooled. Just a thin layer of melted chocolate chips, made a wonderful addition. I have also taken sugar crystals and placed under the dough before cooking for a different taste! Yummy!!! Not your fat-free recipe, but really good, if you want to be realy bad for a day!!

Served this recipe to my fellow motorcyclists; they gobbled it up. The key ingredient was the fluff (whipped marshmallow) this added the perfect amount of sweetness to the taste.

I made individual cookies instead of one large pizza using the marshmallow and cream cheese spread. This spread much better than the cream cheese/sugar version... much smoother. I used strawberries, bananas and kiwi fruit. I also made a fruit glaze to dip the fruit in before adding to the cookies.

This was delicious and all the family loved it, but next time I will definitely GREASE the pan/cookie sheet before applying the cookie dough, because when we tried to cut out pieces, the crust stuck to the bottom and crumbled, making for a not so pretty mess. (still tasted YUMMY though)

DELICIOUS!!  I made this with strawberries, kiwi, and rasberries, and arranged the fruit after the cookie was sliced (as suggested by another reviewer).  Absolutely wonderful- the coworkers devoured this first, and I loved it so much I made another one that night.

This is a wonderful idea and I always get requests for this. I always use 1 cup confectioners sugar instead of the marshmallow cream. I also mix in about 1/4 cup of OJ to make the frosting creamier.

This was a huge hit at our party this summer! One thing I recommend: don't use bananas. They taste good, but if you like pretty, they don't stay pretty. :( Still, this was an awesome receipe!

This recipe is amazing! We made this for my baby shower because I wanted something besides cake and everyone loved it. We topped it with strawberries, blueberries, bananas, nectarines, and slices of pineapple. Nothing needs altered with this recipe unless you make the dough thicker, in which case, cook just a little longer.

I made this for a 4th of July picnic and it was a hit!  Instead of the traditional sugar cookie I used Betty Crocker chocolate chunk cookie mix.  It was pretty easy to spread on the pan (no rollling needed) Then I toped it off with some fresh strawberries, blackberries pineapple and kiwi. The taste of the chocolate cookie with the marshmello cream was perfect!  This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe! Absolutely delicious and can be made to fit any occasion. I made this for two different events and each time it was gobbled up. I used kiwi, strawberries, mandarin oranges and banana's. This gave it a lot of color and the kid's loved it!

I thought this was very tasty but I gave it only three stars because it didn't keep overnight well.  I think the marshmallow stuff separated or something because a clear sticky substance ran out of the dessert as it sat in the frig overnight.  Still tasted good, mind you.  Maybe the fluff sat in my cabinet too long?  I don't know.

This is the exact recipe that my mom and I have always used.  Very Yummy!  I always top with strawberries, kiwifruit and sliced bananas dipped in lemon juice (to reduce browning).  It always turns out great and never lasts long!

I didn't make any changes, but I would've added cooking spray to the pan because I couldn't get it out with out it breaking. I also had to add milk the the cream cheese and marshmallow cream because it was to sticky to spread.

I made two “pizza” s with two rolls of cookie dough. I made a round, a rectangle , and a LETTER J shaped for the first name of a special guest. The dish was a hit. ONly used sliced strawberries and fresh blueberries to decorate. I liked the Neufchâtel cheese with the marshmallow to make the topping. Will definitely try this again for the next party( so not to be tempted to eat it by myself!)

I liked this fruit pizza, it's the exact taste I was looking for but the crust was far to hard and brittle. I greased the pan very well along with cooking for just about 5 minutes longer then the time said and it wasn't burned but just extremely hard. I suggest  only cooking it for 10 minutes and not go over at all if you want a chewy texture, which is what I wanted. Also, this is very thin, so if you want a thicker crust either use a smaller pan or use double the cookie batter. Anyway, this fruit pizza was good and I recommend at any party!

This was so delicious! I mixed a ripe banana into the sauce and OMG!! Perfection! Be sure to let the cookie crust come to room temperature before frosting to keep it from getting soggy.

A very good filling and a simple recipe. I was able to substitute the marshmallow fluff, which I could not find, with simply melted down marshmallows. It will be a bit more sticky though.

Great recipe! A friend recommended using the marshmallow creme version and this is probably the best fruit pizza I've had. I used kiwis, strawberries, blueberries and raspberries.  

For the cookie dough, I used it when it was moderately cool. I sliced the cookie log into circles and placed them on the pan. I then just pressed them together and made sure the layer was as even as possible. No rolling pin needed. 

Make sure you let the cookie 'crust' completely cool before adding the cream cheese/marshmallow creme topping. I threw it in the fridge for 10 mins when it was cool to the touch. 

And lastly, this is so much better ~12 hours after it's made. The flavors seem to develop and come together.

This was easy and yummy, I just wish the frosting had more flavor. The marshmallow creme overpowered the cream cheese ever so slightly and made the icing as a whole somewhat tasteless. However, this was altogether a tasty, quick recipe, and it didn't get soggy as some other reviews stated.

Took this to my weekly pot luck dinner last night and it was a hit.  Loved the cream cheese and marshmallow cream mixture. I topped it with kiwi, mandarin orange and strawberries.  Next time I will glaze it with some apricot jam.  My only complaint was the crust got soggy after sitting out for several hours.

Served these at breakfast this weekend and they were a big hit. I will serve them again at my daughter's birthday party. The only difference is I prefer mini, individual pizzas, so I just made individual cookies to serve as the crust.

This was a wonderful easy recipe!  I did exacly as the directions stated.  I had some strawberry glaze on hand so I spread this over the cream cheese, then i sliced, strawberries, kiwi, and then blueberries over the top.  Took this to our Women's Ministry, and it was a hit!  Thanks Lois for a great recipe!

I used cool whip instead marshmallow and added a touch of lime aid concentrate and powdered sugar (to taste).  I then took some of the limeaid concentrate and mixed in some powdered sugar and brushed it over the fruit to keep the bananas from turning brown (I did an american flag for the 4th)

brought this to an end of school year picnic at the beach.  I made individual cookies and put them in cupcake wrappers.  I used blueberries and  strawberries, and i added a splash of vanilla to the frosting.  This got rave reviews.

Good, but not my favorite.  It was quick and easy to make, I'd probably make it again for that reason.  The crust started to get soggy by the end of the day.

I made this delicious dessert for our Easter family dinner.  It was a big hit!  Most of us are dieting so I made it a little lighter using light cream-cheese and light whipped topping.  I used strawberries, blueberries and mandarin oranges.  I used the wax paper hint when spreading the cookie dough out and it worked perfectly.

So easy to make and so good.  Followed VERADICERE's advice and rolled the sugar cookie out between two pieces of wax paper.  I added strawberries, blackberries and blueberries.  Thanks

I made this pizza for a family party...It was wonderful I did add a little lite cool whip to the topping so it would spread easily. Everyone loved it & I have already had 2 phone calls for the recipe.

I usually use a recipe for fruit pizza a from Pampered Chef but it doesn't have marshmallow cream. This one was so yummy. I may have a new favorite. It was a huge success at a work carry in.

What a yummy, easy way to get creative!  I made this for guests and they all raved, adding how 'healthy' it is.  I laffd!  Sugar cookie dough, cream cheese, and marsh' fluff.  But there's fruit!  I tried grapes, mango pieces, kiwi, and mandarin oranges.  Very pretty!  Thanks for the great idea.  Will use it again.

This is a delicious, simple and beautiful dish. I used strawberries, grapes, raspberries, and blackberries to decorate the circular pizza style dish. My friends loved it!!

This fruit pizza recipe is excellent and easy just the way it is!  It lifted out of the pan quite nicely and was absolutely delicious!  Everyone that tried it loved it, including my picky 2 year old son!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is incredible! It is SO easy to make and VERY delicious!!! I have taken it to work, parties, and family get togethers...I have gotten rave reviews about it. I usually use kiwi, strawberries, and grapes for the fruit...putting a creative design enhances the look and is really neat. You can serve it in a pizza pan or rectangular pan and it will turn out just fine. Leaving the fruit pizza in the fridge for a few hours really helps the taste!!! You can make it the night before, cover it, stick it in the fridge, and it will be great for serving the next day! Enjoy:)

YUMMY! This was the best "sauce" for a fruit pizza. The marshmallow creme and cream cheese is an excellent combo! I used a variety of berries and grapes plus kiwi fruit. It was yummy AND beautiful! My only change to the recipe is that I used 2 tubes of sugar cookie dough to make it a bif puffier. The cream cheese mixture goes a long way so no need to make any additions to that. But this was a great fruit pizza for a summer potluck! THANKS!

I made this in a 9" x 13" pyrex...I took it to a eucher tournament and people commented that they felt this would be better on a graham cracker crust rather than cookie dough (which was way too thick!)  The toppings I used were kiwi, mandarine oranges, black berries and green grapes...it was very good.
