I used this recipe to make Rum Balls.  They were awesome!
I prepared the cake exactly as instructed, then once cool, placed it in a 5 qt kitchenaid mixer with the paddle attachment and mashed it all.  I used a small ice cream scoop to scoop the balls, then dipped them in melted chocolate (merkens) and rolled them in chocolate sprinkles.
Delicious and easy.  I would definitely make them again.

I had a number of problems.  Made this cake in a springform pan.  I peeked in at about the 45 min. point to find the whole top was split wide open.  Oh my. I had to bake this at least 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  I had a very hard time getting the glaze to absorb.  In fact, I didn't put it all in.  Used some "on the side" at serving time.  The chocolate topping became so hard on this cake it was eating a candy bar on top of your cake.  Plus, it made it so hard to cut.  And the white chocolate I used would not melt to a drizzling consistency at all so I skipped that and just grated some white chocolate on top.  All that said, it still tasted very good.  But it was a pain to make and I don't know that I'd do it again.  If I did, I surely would use a more traditional "soft" frosting on top.

I'm baking this cake right now, but I know it will be delicious because it is very similar to the traditional Bacardi rum cake (yellow cake) I make.  I discovered a secret to getting the glaze to absorb completely every time.  Cool the cake in the pan.  Once it is cool, poke lots of holes in it using a skewer and then pour the glaze on it.  Pour slowly so it doesn't overflow.  Let it sit for several hours and the glaze will soak in completely.  Works every time!

Absolutely wonderful!  Delicious with every bite.  A little hard to get the glaze to really soak into the cake, but well worth it in the end.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this to any chocolate fan!

The batter is really thick so be sure that your blender can handle it!  I, like a few others, had problems with the rasberry sauce soking in, so i just dumped the sauce on the bottom of the pan and placed the cake back in, left it for about 4 or 5 hours, then fliped it over and the sauce soaked up well!  When I first tried it I thought it was really heavy and slightly dry, but on my husband request I microwaved a slice for 20 seconds and it was AMAZING!  All hot and gooey!  I'm going to play around with it to see if I can make the cake more moist though.
