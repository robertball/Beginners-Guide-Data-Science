Thank you Chef John.  I was looking for something different to do with my black eye peas on New Years day and found this recipe.  I added 1/2 package of 15 bean soup and the rest of the black eye peas.  It was delicious.  It was a hit.. who knew!  Thanks again. Oh, I found the cotechino at a little gourmet spice in Oklahoma City.  It was wrapped the same way.
