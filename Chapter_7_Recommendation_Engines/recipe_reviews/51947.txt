The receipt is quick easy and surprisingly good.  I always make a new receipt as close to the original as possible the first time.  In this case I did cut the Jalapeno in half for the kid's sake, although I would have liked it better full strength.  I used a food processor with half the vinegar to puree the onion and pepper then added it to the first half and sugar and cooked it close to an hour before we were ready to eat, again the extra cook time tamed the sour and hot.  I used it on pork chops on the grill the last 5 minutes a side, and on the table.  Will make it again, full strength...

OK, but nothing special. Other sauces that we've tried have more flavor & rank higher on our recipe rating. Won't make this again.

Used this to cook ribs (beef & pork) for 1 hour prior to bbq.  Great flavor and super tender.  Got the outside crisp when I put it on while cooking.
