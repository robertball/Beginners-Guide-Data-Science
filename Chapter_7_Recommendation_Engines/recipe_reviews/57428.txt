Wow- this is really good.  I picked this recipe only because I had the ingredients on hand and I'm so glad I did.  I made no substitutions and I don't really think it needs any. Served it with angel hair pasta and crusty bread.  It was delicious.

This recipe was terrific - made it a couple of hours ahead of time and only had to reheat while I cooked the angel hair. Even my pickiest eaters loved it. Added italian seasoning mix of sea salt,rosemary, garlic, sage, pepper, oregano and fresh basil to flour mix, increased wine to one cup, halved the artichoke hearts. Will add more fresh garlic next time but otherwise it was fantastic!

We enjoyed this dish as specified in the recipe.  It does need a little more flavor to it.  I added the zest of the lemon, but it still needed a bit more.  I would try this again but with only 1/2 c flour and more spices added to it, and I would try it with a teaspoonful of bouillon powder.  Maybe a couple tablespoonfuls of red pepper bruschetta or sundried tomatoes would do the trick for me.  But this recipe is a good start to a good dish!

This turned out to be quite delicious but there are a number of things I didn’t follow in the recipe to make it so.  I didn’t measure or follow the cooking times or technique exactly.  I didn’t add garlic powder or Italian seasoning. Garlic, salt and pepper were enough.  I didn’t EVEN cook the chicken an additional 20 minutes after already browning it a couple of minutes per side. (Now that would have been some tough, dry chicken!)  And I certainly didn’t include the brine from the capers or the “reserved artichoke liquid” (which I obviously didn’t reserve in the first place).   The broth, a splash of white wine and a good squeeze of fresh lemon was all this needed. Once the sauce has been reduced, just a few minutes, lower the heat and swirl in a little butter for a smooth, velvety sauce.  Garnish with fresh minced parsley and thinly sliced lemon.  I served this with pasta with garlic and oil, and Swiss chard.  My kind of meal -  Hubs’ too!  Following the recipe using the indicated caper brine, artichoke liquid and cooking the chicken an additional 20 minutes, I’d call this a generous 3 star recipe.  However, given that this is such 5-star quality ignoring those instructions I’ll call it at 4-stars rather than risk scaring others away from this excellent dish.

I made this last night for my hubby & me & it turned out fantastic!  I did tweak it a little; used two breasts, but kept the other ingredients the same as called for in the recipe as I served it over angel hair pasta & wanted lots of sauce.  The changes I made were adding 3 cloves of garlic (we love it!), used artichoke bottoms instead of hearts (not fiberous), substituted sun dried tomatoes for the capers & added 1/4 C each of chopped fresh parsley & cream at the end.  After plating, I grated fresh parmesan reggiano on top.  We both loved it!

I'm the original poster of this recipe (I haven't been able to log in using the original profile), but wanted to add a couple thing I've done to make this even better. I cut the chicken thinly rather than pounding, then salt and pepper it on both sides and lay flat on a plate. Sprinkle on crushed garlic and zest and juice of one lemon. I let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then flour (I haven't been adding the Italian seasoning) and then continue as written.The marinade adds a whole additional depth of flavor. I've also found that different brands of artichoke hearts and capers taste differently in this dish, so you may have to experiment with amounts. I add flour slurry at the end to thicken. Thanks for your reviews and for sharing your tweaks!

This was FANTASTIC !!  I don't bother pounding my chicken, they are fine as they are. I don't chop my artichokes either, they are fine quarted. I used a Chablis and a whole cup. I can't wait to make this again and again.

This makes way too much sauce and the intense picatta flavor gets lost in the process.  I have never had restaurant chicken picatta served over pasta, so maybe my frame of reference is off.  That having been said, it was still pretty good with the following tweaks:  I used three big garlic cloves and I did need to sprinkle about  a tablespoon of the dredging mix to get the sauce to thicken.  If I were to make it again, I would use half an onion and grate it, as one reviewer suggested.  I would also cut the liquid ingredients by at least half.  Or, I'm thinking I'll try the other Chicken Picatta recipe on this site, minus the giant bed of pasta.

Very good.  The sauce was great.  The only change I made was to add a chicken bouillion cube for a bit more flavor/salt.  Thanks.  Love artichokes!!!

Delish!  Only additions made was added a little paprika to flour mix, baby bellas and red pepper flakes for a little spice!  Also added a little more garlic and lemon that it calls for.  Served over linguine with some crusty bread.

This was great.  Everyone loved the chicken (it would be good for any number of other uses).  The pasta was also good, though I omitted the butter, which cut down on the fat, and it wasn't missing a thing.  I also used whole wheat past to make it a little healthier. I would definitely make it again.

This was absolutely delicious!!! I took others advice and didn't add the liquid from the capers or the artichokes. Can't wait to make again!!!! PS-Also didn't add the butter at all and added more wine and lemon-if you have the time to let it reduce, you don't need the butter at all.

I followed the recipe exactly as it's stated. 2 tbs of olive oil weren't enough to cook the chicken so I added more. I found using the juice of capers was a bit too much of sour flavor. Also, I added some chopped parsley. Other than these little nitpicks I found this recipe to be very flavorful without using excessive amount of butter. It was seriously a wonderful dish for my 1st wedding anniversary dinner with my hubby over glasses of nice white wine.

Very good.  I added extra garlic cloves, but I always do. Whole family enjoyed it.  I made the sauce ahead of time and just reheated it when the pasta was done

I upped the wine to 1 c., cut the butter completely, and added 4 sundried tomatoes from the jar. Excellent! I served it over roasted spaghetti squash "noodles".

Delish! We loved it. The only very minor thing I did was add lemon slices to it while it simmered, they made for a beautiful garnish and even enhanced the lemony flavor, yum!

excellent.  Use artichoke "bottoms", quartered rather than hearts, which break down too quickly.  Tends to be too liquid, and needs corn starch near the finish.  No need to reserve the artichoke liquid.  Go with one tbsp of lemon juice, and taste test near serving to see if you wish more.  Onion needs to be quite finely minced.  Stolyman in Asheville

I've made this for years! I was like the writer, loving it in restaurants and wanting a "cleaner" version to make at home. I've never made it with the onions, but will certainly try that next time. Re: one reader's comment that this recipe made too much sauce. I disagree! When served over angel hair pasta, the sauce just brings the whole thing together. Delicious!

I made this today for lunches next week.  Gathered all the ingredients, started cooking the chicken... And started drinking the wine.  I ended up polishing off the wine, so I got a bit creative.  I used half a cup of lite raspberry vinaigrette instead, and doubled the lemon juice.  I also added a few dashes of cayenne to the flour, and dumped the left over flour mixture in during the final stage.  This turned out deliciously, and I'll definitely make it again, but next time I'll try not to drink all the wine!

The only thing I would do differently next time is add the artichokes at the same time as the capers, otherwise they tend to break up

Absolutely delicious! I tend to order this at Italian restaurants a lot, and find them greasy as well. This, however is perfect. I will be making this again for sure. And I always will serve with pasta! Thank you!

Decreased liquid (proportionately) very salty (I didn't add any), the only reason I continued to eat it was the cost!!!

I Love Chicken piccata! I grew up eating this dish with my Nana. After she passed I made a point to try it at every restraunt I visit. This one took the cake!!!I did use a little cream to thicken it up a bit. I dont like pasta (I was raised on it. I ate it every night of my life) So I made mashed potatos and poured the sauce and chicken over the top with some homade french bread and it was amazing!!!!!! Thank you for this recipe. It brings back some great memories.

This was very tasty. I will make it again as is, I skipped the lemon because an allergy, but the taste would improve with it. Next time I may add some vinegar in place of it to give it a zing. It didn't state whether marinated or regular artichokes, mine were marinated

I'm sorry, this was not a hit with my family.  Sadly I am allergic to sulfites, so I had to skip the wine and due to doctors orders I had to omit the butter.  I suspect this dish would have been MUCH better with those ingredients.  If you can't add those ingredients this may not be the recipe for you.

This one of our new favorite dishes..It is far from bland. I use a little less onion and artichoke and thicken it a little with corn starch. Superb!

This was a delicious recipe given I baked the chicken. In an attempt to reduce the amount of fat in this dish, I strayed from the dredging and frying part. Because I didn't fry the chicken, I had to add some cornstarch to the sauce as a thickening agent.  I used all of the seasonings and other ingredients as outlined in this recipe. Hubs loved the melding of flavors.  For that it deserves five stars!

This recipe is perfect. The flavor is delicate. Ideal with a glass of Moscato wine. Don't make any changes to this recipe until you have tried it the way it it is written. The ingredients are measured perfectly.

This recipe was really great! I did cook the chicken in the pan then I deglazed the pan with the chicken broth, sauted the onion and garlic and then added more chicken broth with the wine before cooking it down more. The result was a fantastic depth of flavor and I completely omitted the salt. The butter at the end makes the sauce very velvety and delicious! This is a keeper!

I pretty much followed the recipe as described.  It was tasty - my family enjoyed it a lot.  However, I was a little disappointed since I really noticed a difference that the lack of butter made compared to a more traditional chicken picatta.  I would recommend adding more butter and not using too much of the liquid from the capers.

I made this the other day and it was fabulous!  I did leave out the artichokes though because I didn't have any on hand, but I'm sure it would have been just as good with them.

My goodness this recipe was delicious. And I even used a cheap sauvignon blanc! The only change I made was add one buillion cube...other than that I followed this recipe to a T. One suggestion I would make is to cut the flour down to 1/2 cup.  There was a lot leftover (and wasted) at 3/4 cup after dredging the chicken.

The flavor of this dish was fantastic, but am I the only one who found it way too salty?? It's quick and easy to prepare, elegant enough for company, inexpensive and simple enough for a weeknight family meal... but the saltiness made it nearly inedible. It's a good thing I didn't add the liquids from the artichoke hearts and the capers, or it would have been a total loss. I will make it again, but with a number of adjustments.

I really enjoyed it and personally I would have given 5 stars but the kids voted me down. They hated it. If you have picky eaters you may need to work them into artichokes.

I'm sorry to rate this recipe so low, especially with all the other good reviews, but it was sooo bland I just can't justify any more than 3 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly.  After our first couple of bites, my husband and I both were seaching the kitchen for something to put on the dish to flavor it up a little.  Maybe this is how chicken piccata is supposed to be, but if you're like my family, and prefer dishes with extreme flavor, you will be disappointed with this recipe.

This was so yummy! I served it over spaghetti squash instead of pasta for a change of pace.  I eyeballed the chicken broth, so I wish it was a little thicker, but I think it was my fault.  I read a comment to add corn starch & I will try that next time if it's not thick enough.

Delicious! I skipped the wine, onion, black pepper, and capers because I didn't have any.  The sauce had a perfect butter/lemony flavor and was amazing with the artichoke hearts.  I added lemon slices to the finished product as a garnish.  Next time i'll try it with the white wine.

WOW! I find many piccata recipes very bland but this one is special and impressive enough for guests. It is far more flavourful than the veal/chicken piccata I have tried at restaurants. The only change I recommend is pounding the chicken breasts OR cutting them in half, both is overkill. Also the presentation is much prettier if the are then not cut up into thirds.

This was delicious! My husband and 14-year old son liked it a lot too. I followed it exactly. I used sauvignon blanc for the white wine and smart balance for the butter (and also added this when browning the chicken in olive oil). For ease, I used a plastic bag to dredge the chicken. For color, I sprinkled some fresh chopped parsley on top (otherwise, it's not the most attractive dish).

Excellent.  I added half a can of diced tomatoes but only because I'm trying to duplicate a piccata that I used to buy frozen.  Now that I'm retired I've banned frozen dinners, but I'd like to be able to cook it myself.  I'll play with this a little more, it's very close.  Thank you for the recipe.

Good Food.  Had to add cornstarch at the end to get the sauce to thicken.  Would cut back on some of the chicken stock next time.

What a very yummy dish! I did increase the wine to 1 cup and upped the garlic from 1 to 4 cloves (couldn't imagine it with less really, may up it even). Other than that, everything as written. The leftovers were great the next day. I have made this dish twice now and both times it was a crowd pleaser.

I made this recipe as is for a dinner party. It was WONDERFUL! Everyone raved that it tasted like restaurant-quality! I served it with angel hair pasta and a big garden salad. Next time I may try adding sliced black olives & chopped tomatoes just before serving for some color....this recipe is a keeper!!

This is a really, really good recipe and my sister and I LOVED it! I will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe almost exactly with the only difference being that I added a little bit (maybe 3 tablespoons) of half and half at the same time I added capers, just to thicken it a bit. But, it was excellent. It makes a lot of food too. I served with mash potatoes and green beans - delish!

This was delish! We avoid flour where we can so the chicken was browned without the dredge. The sauce is awesome and the artichokes are a welcomed addition. Didn't quite use 1/4 cup capers cause I ran out. Maybe had 2 tablespoons worth. This one is a keeper! thanks JAMMINMARTIN

As usual I use this site to find recipes that I have the ingredients for. Then I tweak it based on the reviews I read. So I pounded my Chicken thighs flatter, dredged in cornstarch seasoned w lemon pepper. Then I sautéed them brown. Added a medium chopped onion, and when that was translucent added one c white wine and 1 cups chicken broth cooked until sauce began to thicken. Added the majority of a 33 oz jar of water packed artichoke hearts cut in quarters. One can of mushrooms  drained (also I added a cup of chicken spinach and mushroom sauté I had leftover from the other night in the fridge). Three tablespoons of drained capers (we love them!), a 2 Tbl package of cream cheese to creamy up the sauce and the juice of one freshly squeezed lemon. Served over rice (we are low carb/gluten). And it was super. We appreciate the sour nature of the sauce. Thanks for the inspiration!

I loved this dish!  I eliminated the liquids from both the artichokes and capers and omitted the wine because I didn't have any.   Super impressive and crazy good. Note: focus on getting the chicken brown and not limiting yourself to two minutes. Mine took longer.

I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars because I think if I would have added the liquid from the artichokes and capers, it would have been inedible. Because I didn't, it turned out perfectly. The sauce is delicious but needed to be thickened slightly with a cornstarch slurry. Thanks for sharing. :o)

I enjoyed trying this recipe last night, love the combo of artichoke and capers in this.  If you like LOTS of sauce, you will love this recipe.  I do like sauce but found this a little too soupy, next time I will not add the liquid from the artichokes and cut the broth to a cup or so to start. Served over angel hair pasta. I found the flavors bright and springy, much needed on this dull March day!

Delicious recipe!  Husband said it was excellent.  Added more salt, black pepper and garlic powder and about 1 t. of Italian seasoning to add more flavor as other reviews mentioned it being on the bland side.  Used 2 cloves of garlic, omitted the wine(didn't have on hand) and just used 2 c of chicken broth.  Also omitted the caper liquid per another reviewer's suggestion.  The whole family enjoyed the meal!

Just made this tonight for dinner.  After reading reviews, I did abit of tweaking.  In the flour mixture, I used rice flour,  added the grated peel of one lemon, and a tad bit more garlic powder.  I added more vino, boiled most of it off, and used less broth.  I added the juice of one large lemon.  I simmered that off, condensing flavors before adding the chicken back to the pan.  Grated the peal of another lemon on top of chicken.

Chicken piccata has always been one of hubby's favs, but he says this was absolutely the best ever!  Even out-did his favorite restaurant!

I tried this recipe tonight and although we enjoyed it, I would say that it definitely needs some tweaking. I love the addition of artichoke hearts but I will add twice the amount of lemon juice next time and twice the garlic as well. I would also suggest only dredging the chicken in flour on one side. My favorite chicken piccatta recipe is one that I found in "The Joy of Cooking" years ago. I think I'll be sticking with that one although I'll be borrowing the addition of artichoke hearts. Overall, not a bad recipe but one that could use some alterations.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish! I followed the recipe as is, however, I only used 1/2c flour. The ingredients blend very nicely together. I know some people added sundried tomatoes, but personally I think that would ruin the delicious simplicity of this piccata. Real Italian food is based on simplicity and seasonal ingredients. I served this over linguine. Thank you!

Delicious - I used shallots instead of onion and frozen artichokes because that is what I had. My sauce did not benefit from the artichoke liquid, therefore, but was good all the same. I also did not add the butter at the end and found the sauce plenty rich without it.

AMAZING! I use the zest of 3 lemons and the juice of 3 lemons because I like it a little tangy. Also, After I cook the onion and garlic, I deglaze the pan with about a cup of whatever white wine I have open in the fridge, usually Pinot Grigio. I double up on the artichokes because I love artichokes. I have to let my piccata  simmer a bit longer so the sauce thickens because of the extra liquid I add, but it's no big deal. This recipe is a slam dunk and is delicious served over whole wheat pasta.

Excellent, but leave out the capers, they are very bitter! Glad I tasted them before I put them in, it would have ruined it.

Very good flavor,  but don't add any of the liquid from the capers or the artichokes hearts.  First of all, it is too salty, and secondly, it will make way too much sauce and be too thin.   Great meal for company as well....

I had this dish in an Italian Restaurant several years ago and I never forgot it.  This recipe comes very close.  It's delicious and its good to know I can now make it any time I want.  It's a little labor intensive, but definitely worth the trouble.  You wouldn't believe how many recipes I went through before choosing this one and I'm glad I did!  I needed more olive oil to cook the chicken and then the onions and garlic.  I used a huge skillet so I could brown all the chicken at one time.  I didn't add capers because I didn't have any plus I really am not crazy about them.  I wasn't sure what size onion to use, so I decided on a small one.  Didn't want it to be to "oniony."  Thanks very much for sharing!

I added Crimini mushrooms to the sauce and backed off a bit on the artichoke hearts.  I found that serving this over angel hair pasta was the way to go.

This recipe is awesome just like it is, but for those that want a little kick, add a can of Rotel Tomatoes. Not only does it add a little spice to it, but also adds color. You can choose mild, medium, or spicy, depending on how hot you want it. It is easy and can be made ahead and reheated just before serving. I do not pound my chicken, cooking it as is works fine. It is a great choice for a dinner with guests. You just need to be in the kitchen to cook the pasta. Serve with a salad and garlic bread.

We all loved this!  I've made this twice, so far.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly with wonderful results!  Second time I tweaked the recipe a little to add tomatoes and mushrooms.  Both have gotten rave reviews from my family!

A new easy favorite for our house.  I tried it once without white wine and I have never had capers on hand, and it was great both times.  Easy and simple....artichoke hearts, canned tomato, little onion, garlic, and lemon and dump it all on pasta.  Great and easy to memorize.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  He's very picky so this is a big deal.  It was easy to make and I had most of the ingredients already.  I like a very lemony piccata so I added more lemon and it was perfect.  I will definitely make this again.

This was really good!  I cut the chicken into a little bit smaller pieces than the recipe called for.  I also had trouble getting the sauce to thicken as much as I would like so I ended up adding about a tablespoon and a half of flour to it.  I'm not too crazy about capers so next time I might reduce the amount or omit them altogether.  Overall this was a really good recipe and I can't wait to make it again :)

I have never registered on this site but I needed to due to this recipe.  Oh Wow! This is amazing!  I didn't have white wine so I used Sherry and was still good! My picky children asked for more and more.  I added mushrooms to this and served it with rice pilaf and broccoli.  Yummy! My #1 so far! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was FULL of flavor! My family loved it! I would chop my onions a lot more next time...m,aybe even grate them in. I used 3 cloves of garlic and a whole cup of white wine and some extra chicken broth because we love us some extra sauce in this family! I would make it again because it was SO easy and yummy! Rhanks for the recipe!

This was so good!  Only thing I added was a chicken bullion cube and more seasoning than called for.  My husband hates artichokes and onions but ate every one on his plate!  Will definitely make this again!

This came out really well- but I did reduce the amount of capers, and I used fresh oregano in the dredging mix (I put it in the food processor to make sure it was smooth). Next time I might try adding cream to the sauce, and sub lemon rind for the lemon juice. Even as is, this was very good, and it made a lot of food.

Very easy to make and tasted delicious! The artichoke added an interesting taste that complemented well, yet still leaves the standard piccata taste. Made it for roommate dinner and the girls all loved it. Didn't change a thing in the recipe and it was perfect. Served with pasta

I omitted the capers, as my husband needs a low salt version. It was a bit time consuming, but it was worth the effort.  It was fairly easy.  I am kind of new at cooking, and it was actually very good!

Very good, like others I made tweaks.  I omitted the wine and butter.  I added more lemon, garlic, and artichokes.  I cut way down on the capers, and will cut down on the chicken broth, to perhaps half next time.  I served over a rice/quinoia mixture which was good.  I would recommend this recipe!

This was delicious!  I added a bit more black pepper and italian seasoning than the recipe called for plus a dash of crushed red pepper for an added kick.  I had to add some corn starch to get the sauce to thicken since I added the juice from the artichoke hearts.  I would recommend not adding the extra juice. I also used about half the amount of capers since I added extra seasoning or it would have been a little too flavorful.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I sliced each chicken breast in half horizontally and pounded thin, to make the appearance of chicken scallopine, which makes a better presentation.  I omitted the caper liquid, the capers and the artichoke liquid and used quarted artichokes not chopped.  When serving I sprinkle on fresh chopped parsely and thin lemon slices. We all loved the dish, thanks for sharing.

Fantastic and easy! Per other reviews I didn't add the juices from the capers or artichokes. I did add a bit of lemon zest since it adds such a bright flavor. Only simmered for about 10 minutes after cooking and I just realized I forgot to add the butter at the end. Even without it the dish was wonderful!

Excellent, but watch how much capers you put in, it can quickly overcome the dish. I added mushrooms.

This is the best chicken picata recipe I have tried so far! It makes a lot of sauce( which i love) and it has excellent flavor. Plus the addition of the artichokes is great. I changed a couple things, like I didnt cut the chicken into thirds- I want my chicken nice and juicy so I just pound the breasts. I also left out the artichoke liquid- not necessary because it will just help to mask the picatta taste. Other then that I followed the recipe exact and it was delicious!

There is plenty of sauce in this great recipe which can be poured over cooked pasta. The only changes I made were that I didn't reduce the wine, used a small jar of marinated artichoke hearts, used 2 cloves of fresh garlic, thickened the sauce w/cornstarch. It's a keeper recipe that we'll be having many times. Thank you!

I left out the italian seasoning since my fiancee make chicken piccata without it. Then I basically added ingredients till it tasted good. I didnt have white wine on hand, so I upped the amount of lemon juice and added a touch more broth. Also, I generally don't use corn starch, so I floured my chicken and slowly cooke dit in the pan. Once I added the broth,  I brought the mixture up to a boil where it naturally thickened.

Made this for dinner last night -- the family loved it. I served with pasta -- and they kept wanting more sauce to add to their noodles. Rather than pound the chicken into cutlets, I cut the chicken into 1 inch pieces.

A little soggy, chicken needs to be very crisp and browned to withstand the simmer in the sauce. We added capers. Very tast overall. Served with lemon butter angel hair pasta and sautéed veggies.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I used gluten free flour and angel hair pasta.  Like others I added one cup of the white wine.  At first I cut back on the chicken broth (8 oz.) because I was afraid the sauce would be too thin but my sauce was very thick so added another 4 ounces.  It came out great and I will be fixing it again soon.

We all loved this and the chicken gets so tender!  There is a lot of sauce and it never really thickened like it was supposed to, but we loved it anyway!

Very good and easy to prepare with ingredients I already had on hand (except the capers). The sauce was savory. I served this on parmesan risotto.  I also added extra garlic.

We were not that impressed with this recipe. It was alright, but definitely didn't seem like anything special. Lacked strong flavor and more spices, we thought.

This was sooooo good.  I added my fettucine past to then the butter and the capers.  I didn't have Lemon juice so I seasoned my chicken also with lemon pepper and sprinkled some into the wine, onions, garlic, and broth as it thinckned

I used this in lieu of my usual recipe. Although I agree that it does taste better "the next day" (it made an amazing omelet), I found it lacking for the actual dinner. By no means a bad recipe, quite the opposite. I would just love to have the flavor of the second day omelet in the initial dinner.

Just as good as in the restaurants! 
Although I had to substitute the can of broth for 2 cups of water and 4 bouillon cubes, still tasted great. Also it took myself longer than 15 to prep.

Great recipe!

Excellent dish!  This was a very easy Piccata with an intense and complex flavor.  I didn't need the full amount of flour, seemed way too much.  I also used shallots instead of onion, and used the nasty reconstituted lemon juice in lieu of fresh due to it being all I had, and this still turned out wonderful.  Next time I make it, I'll try adding mushrooms and FRESH lemon juice, and if I'm feeling extra decadent I'll add a splash of cream at the end.  It'll be out of this world!  Thanks for this, we will enjoy it time after time!

Unbelievably delicious!!!  I followed the recipe except I didn't pound the chicken breasts which allowed for the extra 20 minutes cooking at the end.  The extra cooking is important as the lemony garlic deliciousness infuses itself into the chicken -- oh so good!  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow!  I did also add SOME of the artichoke liquid and SOME of the caper liquid -- you need those flavors!

I made this last night and I even doubled the recipe so I'd have leftovers for my hungry boys.  Well, they all went back for seconds and I have a lot of full bellies, but no leftovers.  I'd say it was a big success.  I don't think I've ever had so many requests to make it again.

Really good. Only change I made was making the sauce thicker and faster by making a roux with 2 tb of butter and 2 or 3 tb flour.

This came out really good!  I made a few minor substitutions, one accidental =)  Realized once everything was already cooking that I only had limes, no lemons!  It worked though, and I'd actually do it again on purpose...  Maybe add a dash of cajun seasoning...  I think I'm onto something!  Anyway, didn't cook 20 mins, more like 10, then mixed with the twist twirly pasta.  SO yummy!  Glad there was enough to have again tonight, I get the feeling it's one of those things that tastes even better the next day.  Will definitely make again!

Very good.. I made it for dinner tonight. Served it over angel hair pasta.  I think next time I would buy chicken that is already flattened.. I hate pounding it.can never get it thin enough.  Also I would add less capers...  so yummy..

The way the chicken is cooked in this recipe is DELICIOUS!  But the sauce was kinda wierd... too many artichoke hearts, not creamy or "saucy" at all, more like a ratatouille of artichoke hearts and onion.  Something gave it an off flavor, but I will definitely be cooking chicken this way for future recipes.  Better luck to you!

Delish!  I made did alter a few things:  I am gluten-free, so I used a GF flour mix instead of the all purpose flour I added some sliced mushrooms I used more chicken stock instead of white wine  It came out fabulous!  Hubby dubbed this "a keeper"!

This is delicious! I ended up using that sauce on all sorts of veg because it was so good.

I did use chicken bone broth instead of stock, because I had some, and that added a certain depth to the sauce, IMO. 

Big thumbs up from my partner. He loved it, too.

Excellent recipe. We like tomatoes so I always add what I have around whether it’s a can of fired roasted, jar of julienne dried in oil or fresh tomatoes with juices!

Thanks for the recipe but not a fan. Color drab green, broth weak and watery, artichokes bland and unchewable, chicken seasoning barely discernable, angelhair a poor pairing, at least the pasta could have been enjoyable. The least remarkable least enjoyable dish I've made in quite some time.

I made this just like recipe said except I had marinated artichokes in my cupboard.  It was delicious and we loved the extra sauce to pour  over my vegetable side dish.

This was a family favorite for sure! Easy enough to make on a weeknight, delicious enough to make for company! I was looking for something different to make with some leftover artichoke hearts and I am extremely glad I came upon this recipe. It was very easy to make, I followed the instructions exactly and it was terrific. I really liked using the angel hair for this one which provided a delicate contrast to the lumps of chicken and artichokes.

The sauce is delicious. And you can make it so quickly. Buy thin chicken or have your butcher flatten it to save time. I added fettuccini. Excellent

For the amount of work involved, I thought this recipe was only ok.  As written, it tasted overwhelmingly of artichokes.  I'm not sure I'll make it again, but I might try it with about half a can of artichokes and no artichoke juice, to give the other flavors a chance.  I might try chicken breast tenders next time also, in the hope that the thinner cuts will absorb more flavor. The thick sauce was really nice, and I think this recipe has potential.

This came out pretty good. I used a full lemon and doubled the garlic powder and black pepper but otherwise followed the recipe. Also, I bought thinly sliced chicken so no meat beating required. I'm not completely sure about timings since my chicken browned much faster than 2 minutes per side and my onions started becoming brown instead of translucent so I dumped the wine in fairly soon after seeing that. The wine also evaporated much faster. I ended up eyeballing it. I'm pretty new to cooking so maybe I did something wrong, but it came out delicious despite that! Next time I might try without the butter. The flavor is good but I want to have it be a bit healthier.

It was delicious. My only complaint is that I felt it was a little bit too salty, but that maybe because there was already salt in some of the additions. I recommend it- especially as it is easy and uses things I already have in my kitchen..

The sauce came out a little watery for my taste (did not add the juice of the artichoke) I thought of adding a little flour to thicken the sauce, so I used a bit of the seasoned flour from the chicken. Accompanied the dish with angel hair pasta like suggested and a potato rose.

I made this exactly as written and it was really good. Next time I will brown the chicken a little longer, for looks, probably add less of the artichoke liquid and definitely more capers. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! I made it but added cherry tomato halves to the dish just after the Artichoke hearts for added taste and color.

This was a great dish-loved by my husband who’s not a chicken lover! We like garlic so I added another clove then served it over angel hair pasta. Since it’s a pretty simple & not spicy dish I’ll be sure to make this in a larger quantity ahead of time for busy family visits!

I added extra white wine and broth, due to other reviews, and still needed to add more later. I cut the breasts horizontally instead of pounding them, She Who Must Be Obeyed said I should have pounded them. She's the cook in the family, I'm just getting started since retirement. Taste wise, it was fantastic. I'm a huge fan of chicken piccatta, and this did the trick. I put it over angel hair pasta, again, going with the reviews, and I get to enjoy it again because I made plenty for leftovers!

I used this recipe as the base for the dish.  I’ve learned what needs more or less and changed the technique a little bit to make it my own.  I still use this when getting ready to make the dish.

I did all of this recipe as described, but I sous vided the chicken to 165 degrees for several hours to have precisely controlled temperature and maintain juices and tenderness. Otherwise my sauce was as described in the recipe. I served it over linguine seasoned with ghee and minced garlic.  The final step only took a few minutes as all I had to do was brown the chicken and add the sauce. Awesome!

Very easy!  Was delicious and pretty quick to make.  I used juice of one lemon, a little extra chicken stock, and a little extra wine.  I served it with TJ's Long grain brown rice, black barley, daikon radish seeds blend and sauteed spinach mix.  It was a huge hit!  Can't wait to make it again!

Good recipe, didn't make any changes but next time I would add a little more seasoning to the flour mix, increase the  lemon(or add zest) and reduce the artichoke liquid and the capers liquid.

I have tried so many ways to make this dish but I think this one is the one I'll go to from now on.  It really tasted great. I made no intentional changes (I didn't have capers but used peppercorns in brine which is similar and my artichokes were in oil with seasonings but I rinsed that off). But even with those differences the flavor was wonderful. Will definitely make this again!! Thanks

Made this fir dinner lastnight and it was so delicious.  My husband said it was delightfully aromatic when he walked in the door from work.  
The only thing different I did was add corn starch to thicken the sauce just a bit and added more garlic since we love garlic in this house.  
I’m thrilled to  of do be this recipe and cannot wait to make it again.

This dish would have been a five if it had called for baby artichokes. I used just one large Breast and cut it laterally for 2 servings, I don't know what their feeding chickens now but the chicken breasts are getting enormous!  I cooked this for two and it was plenty.  I did however make the sauce as printed and it was plenty for linguini too.  I used the quarter cup of capers but not the brine they were soaked in, too salty and strong.  I also did not add any artichoke liquid for the same reason. After I added my wine and reduced it, I added 2 TBS of fresh cream, brought it back up to a simmer and added my chicken and chokes and served it over linguini.  
We go to Italy every year in April while the artichokes are in full season, but not the tourists.  Every restaurant in Rome has a dozen ways to fix them plus a house special. With this dish they would use the baby chokes, sliced in half, choke removed and then saute it with the sauce till tender, a lot of Romans will just get a huge plate of the baby chokes and forget the rest.

This recipe is a much better spin on any Chicken Piccata recipe I have found (which I love!). Make sure to watch the video for good hints and different spins on the original recipe given.  I use to hate cooking but recipes like this has changed that!

This was fantastic! I used chicken tenders and Chef John’s technique of sifting flour onto the chicken (less waste). Definitely a good choice for company

Easy & delicious.  My family loved it. I will certainly make it again. I served it with egg noodles and green beans.

This is a taste as you go, add a bit of this and that, .. kind of recipe. Good base recipe and  with my tweeks it came out amazing.  For the sauce I did NOT add the juice of the capers(unless you want it to taste like very strong dill pickles), or the artichoke juice.  I did add fresh thyme, oregano,basil, salt and pepper. It just needed more flavor and these did the trick. Added a few sun-dried tomatoes and just added more or less of the wine/lemon/chicken broth until I got the flavor I wanted.

This was a fantastic meal.  My husband and I prepared it together and it was very easy to make.  Even better was sitting down to eat it and we really enjoyed it.  The capers and artichokes - along with their juices - really give this dish a lot of flavor.  It was truly a delight.  We will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I enjoyed this dish...but I like artichokes and thought it had great flavor.  My wife and kids who are not as big of fans of artichokes, just thought it was ok.  I'll make it again for myself, but likely not for the family.

This is a good recipe.  I read the reviews and took a couple of hints, though.  The chicken needed more fat to cook, so I added some butter to the mix.  I shredded the onion and added more garlic (always enjoy a little more).  I used marinated artichoke hearts and drained both them and the capers instead of saving the juice.  

I think the recipe is good as is, but I wanted a little less sauce.  I added spinach leaves at the end to add color.  My husband cleaned his plate.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was a very good recipe! I did add some fresh sautéed mushrooms and some sun dried tomatoes... both were a great addition. I also would add a bit more garlic to the one pod in the recipe. Other than that... it's perfectly delicious!

I enjoyed this recipe but made a couple of changes.  I added mushrooms and a rou when the broth would not thicken. Taste was good,especially the chicken but would add more lemon next time

This  recipe was delicious !! After reading some of the reviews, the only change I made was to add a little corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up. Other than that, it didn't need to be changed.  Excellent !!

Make it all the time since first trying it.  It is the BOMB!  Its easy and fancy, the capers, white wine (I use Barefoot Moscato in the little bottles), and artichokes with the liquid just lends such a good flavor, everyone loves it.  I put it over rice or angel hair pasta.  Last time I made it, used a no salt broth and felt something was lacking, yeah-salt, so I added more and also added twice as much capers which made it perfect!!!!!

This was a big hit last night. I did not have all the Italian spices for the flour coating. I did not use the wine or the butter. I like my onions to be more roasted than translucent so I pan roasted half a large Vidalia. I also added pan seared baby Bella mushrooms. I used chicken thighs and kept them warm in the oven until serving time so the coating stayed nice and crispy. The richer flavor of the thighs was nicely paired with the lemon sauce.

This is delicious, but I didn't add as many capers, and cut the amount of flour in half.  Overall very easy and tasty.

Fairly easy and good but I would decrease the amount of lemon juice next time. I found the sauce to be too tart. One tablespoon of lemon juice would probably have been sufficient, possibly even less.

Okay, I made some changes!  I kept the basic spirit of the recipe and followed almost all of the suggestions  from the reviews.  I didn't have any artichoke hearts, used mushrooms.   I cooked some bacon - crisped up my chicken in the bacon fat with a bit of olive oil.  Set aside . Saute shallots, garlic, mushrooms melted butter with leftover flour and zest and juice of a lemon, with the capers after the wine reduction. DELICIOUS!  Added my pasta with swiss chard. real good meal.

I would use half the amount of chicken broth, it never thickened and the sauce was too liquid.  The flavors were great though.

My son has celiac, so I just substituted GF flour for the regular flour. The only ingredient I omitted were the capers (didn't have any). And the only other suggestion is to use less liquid.

I made this recipe today. I must say, I followed the recipe hower, not to the "T" as I never measure anything, but I did basically follow all the ingredients and steps and I made the recipe with 2 chicken breast for the 2 of us. We both loved the meal. I served it over spaghetti (all the noodles I had) and I served a salad along side....oooh, I actually thought the recipe needed a bit of green so I added some Collard Greens that I had in the fridge to the pasta water and then quickly into the picata sauce.......will definitely do a repeat on this one! Thank you....

I added mushrooms and did not use the artichoke reserve or caper juice.  This would have been too thin of a sauce for me.  I served this over angel hair pasta and it was very flavorful and delicious.  I will make this again.

Awesome recipe and super easy. Way less flour is needed, I threw so much away after and the seasoning got lost in it. I added some green beans and mushrooms when frying the onions. Next time I might try to make it with veggie instead of chicken stock. Didn't use the capers as I'm not a big fan.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe and was looking for something to use up the little bit of wine, a bottle of capers and some artichoke hearts.  I loved it.  The first time I have had or made picata.  My 15yo loved the chicken with pasta but  was not a fan of the pasta after the chicken was gone and it was just the 'sauce' on it.  My sauce had no trouble thickening up as I read in another review.  I started my pasta water as I added the chicken back to the skillet to do the 20 min cook.  everything was done at the same time.

I made for "girls night" dinner. Everyone loved it.
I made ahead and left in crock pot, served with pasta.
Happy to say it was a hit and I had just enough left over
for lunch the next day! Yummy!

Perfect as is! It was flavorful and light! Great with thin whole grain spaghetti and steamed broccoli!  This one is  easy, fast and restaurant quality!  For those not used to Mediterranean fare use  less capers and artichoke.

I loved this.  I make chicken piccata often but this version with artichokes & lemon puts it OVER the top.  Will be doing this again.  I did use thighs as I prefer the moist, dark meat.

I accidentally used a whole lemon and it tasted a little bitter, so I added heavy cream to the sauce and it was perfect. It was soooo delicious!  A new favorite.

Incredible! I listened to the advice of others and didn't add the extra juice from the artichokes in there. It was soupy enough without. Added crushed red pepper and that was awesome in there. I'll be making this again for sure.

I said I was making chicken picatta. He heard chicken pot pie. Guess who was disappointed? However he did like it. That is saying something considering he doesn't like trying new things. Capers, artichokes, and lemon sauce all fall in that category. I also enjoyed it. I have no frame of reference. This is my first time eating chicken picatta.

This was a very good recipe!  (4.5 stars) I filleted horizontally the chicken breasts instead of "pounded & cut".  (I'd recommend using just-less-than-medium not medium-high heat, but I guess it depends on your stove.)  I used miced, dried onion instead of fresh, so only had to cook the garlic & onion for about a minute before adding the other ingredients.  Also, all my measurements were eyeballed, not exact.  Followed the order and cooking of the recipe, and my husband and I both really liked it!  Served over angel hair pasta with some vegetable cream cheese & butter.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband (who doesn't cook very often) made this meal based on what ingredients we had on hand at that time.  It came out REALLY good and now this is one of "his" specialty meals.  His notes were:  used thin cut chicken cutlets, didn't use capers or the butter (I would leave this in), served over pasta, and double sauce ingredients if more than 4 chicken breast halves.

was first time making it so it took me a minute to get done as i was  trying to ensure I followed directions and watched that I didnt burn onions or garlic.  It was really good! My fiancee loved it I did add more garlic and didn't use the reserve brine in artichokes but didn't really drain and rinse, just drained a bit  I sure some got in in there.  I also made my own broth using  ckn boullioun cubes. Also used more lemon juice and zest..and fresh italian parsley at the end... will make again.

It really would be unfair for me to rate this recipe because I only used it as a base to experiment.  I did like the end product but I  marinated the chicken in lemon juice and zest, minced garlic, salt and pepper.  I used the seasonings in the recipe for the flour dredge.  But I  left out the liquid from the capers and artichokes and added mushrooms (without the liquid) and used a lemon wine (a specialty wine we brought back from a trip to Florida) in the sauce portion of the recipe.  I  also simmered the chicken in the sauce for only about 5-7 minutes.  The chicken was tender and flavorful but the sauce still lacked the definitive tartness you expect with a piccata.  Perhaps next time I'll add the artichoke and caper liquids.

I used marinated artichoke hearts and added 2 jars instead of 1 (with the juice of only one jar instead of both, but only because the skillet wouldn't hold anymore once all of the chicken was in). This recipe was very good, but made a lot! And my only real complaint was that it took WAY longer to make than what the recipe says. It took me nearly 2 hours from start to finish! It also had a lot of ingredients.

I made it exactly like the recipe called for except I didn't have any plain white wine on hand except for the wife's strawberry Zinfandel.  I was sceptical of using it as I didn't want a fruity sweet taste in the sauce.  I was very surprised at the outcome as this dish was splendid and there wasn't a hint of strawberry.  The whole family loved it!!  I will definitely be making this dish again and will experiment with a few changes such as adding 25-30% more artichoke hearts and perhaps a hint of lemon.  Fix it as the recipe calls for and you will not be disappointed...later.

I made the recipe as written and I loved it!  There is a lot of sauce, but you don't have to plate it with too much sauce.  Besides, I would rather have too much sauce in the pan than not enough.  I would definitely make this again.

I was so very excited to make this tonight for my family. I was trying to find a similar recipe my sister in law had made which was delicious. This smelled absolutely incredible UNTIL I added the liquid from the artichokes. The flavor was absolutely overpowering and no longer could you taste any of the wine or lemon that smelled incredible. Also I would omit the onions altogether! I did follow the recipe exactly. So sad as I had doubled it:( if you make this taste the sauce as you go and be careful with the artichoke liquid!

I made this as written and it was mighty tasty! No need for additions, but a couple suggestions for amounts. Flour can be cut down by  a third to a half  for breading. I would not adjust the seasoning, however. As another reviewer suggested, it was nice to have a little extra flour on hand for thickening up the sauce at the end. Also, I had to use about 2 times the oil for getting the chicken nice and brown. The more flour you use, the more oil they soak up.  Then another Tbsp for the onions.  I had to cook the chicken in 2 batches but it shrunk enough in the cooking process that it all fit in the pan for the simmer step. As mentioned, thickened the sauce just a little bit and served over quinoa. And don't forget those capers! They are essential to the flavor!

Absolutely delicious! All five of us loved this. I increased the servings to 6, so I needed to increase the simmer time to reduce the extra liquid. Great recipe!

This was super delicious! Added a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce. I left out the caper juice. I also used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil, and I also added butter when I cooked the chicken on the skillet. Next time I will probably add the spices to the chicken separately instead of combining them in the flour when I dredge the chicken. I served it over angel hair pasta with broccoli on the side and garlic bread. :)

It wasn't quite as savory as I hoped it would be. I did end up adding some garlic salt and a bit of chicken flavor in the end. Surprised my 7yr old and 9yr old really liked it. I served it with red mashed potatoes.

I loved this! I followed all the ingredients but I used 6 breast of chicken and just eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. ( I used way more of everything suggested) Instead of the wine I used Hollands white cooking wine with lemon and used the juices of 2 lemons. I didn't add the caper juice either. I served this over angel hair pasta. I've had chicken piccata at many different recipes but I have to give myself a pat on the back because mine was absolutely delicious!

So absolutely easy and delicious. I did add mushrooms but basically stuck with this recipe otherwise. Served over whole wheat spaghetti and loved every bite. Not too bad for you but tastes naughty and fancy. Even my 7 and 9 yr old loved it. Will definitely make again.
Update 11/3/2016 made again, loved it just as much. Definitely a winner.

This turned out well.  I feel the onion should be omitted. Too strong for the mild flavors.  Like some other reviewers, I did not cook the chicken again in the sauce. First time was plenty. Also, I think just artichoke bottoms might be better than the whole heart. The leaves tend to break up.
Brown the chicken well and then deglaze the pan with the wine.  It seemed like a lot of sauce after adding the chicken broth, art. juice, lemon juice, etc. but cooking it down a bit and thickening with a tad bit of cornstarch reduced it a lot. Great with brown rice.

New family favorite! My only change was not to saute onion and garlic for 5 min, as the garlic will burn. I did 1 min with hot pan off the burner. It'll cook itself with the rest of cooking time. So glad I found this!

This was great! For once I almost followed the recipe totally, except the artichokes I had were marinated so I used them. The flavor was very good, not over powering due to the marinade and it is easy & quick to make. That is something I am always looking for. It is a winner, Thanks!

Great recipe.  To thicken the sauce I just added a tablespoon of  corn starch to the reserved artichoke liquid before adding it to the chicken.  It thickens the sauce nicely.

Second time I've made this, it's awesome.  Like others, I determined that the chicken was cooked well enough by the browning (verified by probe thermometer), so did not subject it to another 20 minutes of cooking.  I DID add all the liquids called for, but it spent the 20 minutes reducing the liquid (OK, did not time it, but reduced until good consistency).  I raised my eyebrows at the addition of the artichoke marinade and the caper liquid, but upon rejection, they added another layer of flavor to the sauce.  Gave the chicken five minutes of simmering at the very end to bring back up to temp.  So my only real modification was setting aside the cooked chicken to avoid drying it out.

This is one of the best recipes that I've tried from this site. I made the recipe as written with no substitutions, and it was super delicious! The only thing I would change is to decrease the flour to 1/2 cup since I had lots left over. and hate to waste. This recipe is a definite keeper.

10 stars if I could. Made with items we had on hand and I was out of capers, but it was still wonderful. I sautéed some leftover rice in the pan of juices after the chicken was done, some jasmine some whole grain, The nuttiness of the whole grain rice was so rich. Sprinkled extra lemon juice while it was simmering. I followed the recipe a bit loosely, added a little extra broth and wine, eyeballed the measuring on the spices.  Hubby went back for thirds and he's not a big eater at all. Served with caesar salad and I'm thinking next time to add a side of broccolini cooked with white truffle oil. Paired it with Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc.

I can sum this recipe up with two words:  bland and disappointing.  After following the directions as given, the end result was a very bland dinner.  Had to bring a lot of seasonings to the dinner table.

My kids love it! It's also easy to keep the ingredients on hand to make whenever. I skip the capers, they could be great but I usually forget about them.  I also add more chicken broth instead of artichoke juice because my husband is not a huge artichoke fan.

This was a delicious meal. I did tweak a few things to suit my tastes and my family's. I doubled the spices added to the flour mixture, and also added a half teaspoon of seasoned salt. I doubled the minced garlic as well. I substituted additional chicken broth in place of the white wine because I don't care for the flavor and my husband and kids wouldn't know the difference. I added an extra tablespoon of the leftover flour mix  to thicken the sauce before adding the chicken, etc. I used a jar of marinated artichoke hearts instead of canned - great added flavor! My daughter and I really liked the lemon in the sauce - tasty but not overwhelming. For the pasta I added a tablespoon of lemon-infused olive oil to the boiling water with one tablespoon salt. Overall I really enjoyed the dish. I would recommend it and will likely make it again.

This was delicious!! my 6 year old boys and picky husband loved it! Made just as written ( except forgot to add the butter at the end so I guess I saved us a few calories:)) 
Can't wait to make again!

Outstanding with several changes:  I used 1 small jar of marinated artichoke hearts and three oz of capers (a jar)  Used a Chardonnay for white wine.  I used all liquid and then used the left over flour mixture to thicken to right consistency. Served with garlic mashed potatoes!

It is grand. I did halved fat amount in the sauce, and doubled the herbs, but it was yum. I served with spaghetti and steamed baby turnip greens. Same wine that went into cooking (Chardonnay from CA) was nice addition to the meal.

This is one of my favorite receipes with some small changes.  My kids love it too!  I like to add sundried tomatoes, extra artichoke, lemon slices, and extra capers.  I get the big jars of artichoke, capers, and sun dried at my BJ's club as the recipe needs a lot more than listed.  Has a great lemon-salty flavor.  Prep time is fairly long due to pre-cook chicken.

My entire family loved this recipe. I will no longer be able to purchase the premade chicken piccata from the store that we used to love. This recipe is so yummy and much more healthy.  I served it over farro.

This is one of my most favorite recipes! Made it for the second time tonight. Because my daughter is on a gluten-free diet I used Red Mill All Purpose Flour. It worked beautifully! I didn't use the liquid from the capers or artichokes. At the advice of another poster, I quartered the artichokes and added them when I added the capers. I also used chicken stock instead of broth. It was just delicious served over angel hair pasta and steamed kale. No leftover chicken, but I plan to have pasta with the sauce tomorrow for lunch!

Great starter recipe! Just add more of your favorite seasonings. I also browned several tablespoons flour to sautéed onion and garlic prior to adding liquid to thicken.

This is the best reciepe for chicken piccata I've found! I tried several others reciepes on here, and none had the right taste! I found this and thought I'd give it a try. I had the ingredients on hand, and I'm so glad I did, it is awesome! My family loved it, I would make only one change, and only because I am cooking mostly for smaller kids. I would do one tablespoon of lemon juice instead of two. My daughter said it was too sour, but shes 7, I think its perfect. I also served it with angel hair pasta, garlic bread and salads. I am keeping this reciepe, thanks for sharing!

This was excellent!  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  I didn't put in the capers, because I wasn't sure I'd like them.  I found out my husband does, so next time, I'll put them in.

Just finished this recipe.  We really enjoyed it.  Next time I would reduce the amount of chicken broth by 1/2.  I also would reduce the amount of flour used to 1/2 cup of flour.  It is a definite make again dish.  Fresh parsley added at the end added flavor and color.

I substituted the all purpose flour with gluten-free all purpose flour, and it was fine.  I added a teensy bit more lemon juice and lemon pepper seasoning.  Tasty!

I did everything exactly right and it just ended up being a boiled chicken soup. The "sauce" never thickens, and I don't know how it was supposed to when all that was in it was liquid. I will never make this again.

This recipe was awesome.  I did have to change it a little, but the sauce is what makes it and I loved it.   I was preparing the chicken and realized I had no artichokes, who took them!   haha   So, I opened a can of portobella mushrooms and added some sun dried tomatoes instead, and it turned out fantastic.  I added more garlic than recommended because we love garlic.   I was great, highly recommebd.

Very good and rated it based on the recipe as is.  I have adapted it for a more low-carb version.  For any who are interested, substitute ground almonds for the flour. But keep an eye on it while browning the chicken as nuts once they are too toasted will be bitter.  To thicken I added a 1/2 cup of ground cauliflower a couple minutes before adding the capers and butter and served it over cooked spinach.

I made this for me and my husband and we both enjoyed it.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, and it turned out great.

Great!  I was in a hurry so skimped a few steps..used canned chicken breast and skipped steps 1&2. In #3, thickened the liquid with 1 1/2 T of flour in 1/4 c of hot pasta water.  Served over angel hair pasta!  Easy and good

Not sure if i made this wrong or what but the sauce was so bad I had to make something else for dinner.  The capers gave the sauce a bitter taste and smell.  The chicken however came out tasting great with just the flour mixture coating.  This was a huge waste of time and money.

We really liked this. Very quick and easy to make, plus we typically have all of the ingredients on hand.
