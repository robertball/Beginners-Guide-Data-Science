This was a great recipe- very tasty.  I also added a splash of lime juice.  Fresh, it was delicious, but after a day, the flavors infused more and it was even better.

Great base recipe! Only things I did differently were to add an additional 1/2 jalapeno and quite a bit more cilantro as I thought it needed a bit more kick (and I'm not a fan of too much kick!). I added about 2 T of tahini and added more olive oil for a creamier consistency. I prefer using a food processor for hummus. A keeper, thanks!

Made this dip to take in to work today.  It has a nice thickness and a kick from the jalape単o pepper.  I made this in the food processor, but had to add a little extra olive oil to thin it down.  After testing this on chips and fresh veggies, I thought it needed fresh squeezed lime juice.  It was good as written, but better with the lime juice added.  My co-workers enjoyed this dip.

The cilantro is so refreshing! Ad more jalapeno if you like a kick.  I only used one small US grown jalapeno and it was perfect for what I wanted.  I will make this again!

YUM! I just made this, modifying it a little to use what I had. I used black beans (since recently going vegetarian, I buy them by the case), two roasted jalape単os leftover from last night's dinner, added a little lemon juice because I always put it in my  hummus, and added a T. of tomatillo salsa verde (from this site) to thin it out, rather than adding more oil. I normally would have used bean juice, but I forgot to save it.  I added some cumin just cause we love it, and this is very good; I imagine it will be even better after resting in the fridge for a while. I'll make this often.

I just made this recipe and it was great!  I knew right away that I had to tweak it.  I added a splash of lime, hot sauce, and a dash of water.  I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil because I wanted it to be lighter and fluffy.  And I added a sprinkle of onion powder and two shakes of cumin powder.  It tastes better than the one I get from Trader Joes.  It was delish!!!

I made half with the jalapeno pepper and half without, so  that all my taste tasters could sample this.  I preferred the heat of the pepper!  Because of starting with dried beans that were cooked, I found that I needed to add a little of the cooking liquid to make this the right consistency.  Once all the cilantro was chopped, this was easy to put together!  Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe was way too dry. I used 5 tbsp of olive oil and added 2 tbsp of lime juice for some extra flavor. Next time I think I'll add another jalape単o as it didn't have enough kick for my taste.

Wonderful flavours. Did not do well in the blender. After trying, I put it in a deep bowl and used the hand blender. It needed way more olive oil than a tablespoon. Definitely could use some lemon or lime. Made this for company and everyone loved it. Thanks tastywhalebacon. This is a keeper!

Added a little water at the end to make it smoother. Added juice from one lime. The jalape単o was rather large and made it quite spicy. Tastes great!

I made this yesterday and it was SOOO easy! I can't wait to dive in today when company arrives (I did test it yesterday, it was good but after a day in the fridge... YUM!). I followed some of the commenters' suggestions and added a dash of cumin, a dash of cayenne, 2 tablespoons of tahini and reserved the liquid from the beans to add to the mixture for a smoother texture. Thank you for the recipe!

Too dry and needed more flavor. Total 4 tbsp oil, and 1/2 tbsp extra garlic powder. Will try lime juice next time.

It was OK.  I liked the look and color of the dish (especially around the Holidays) but personally I thought it lacked flavor a bit.  I brought it to a pot luck and served with home made pita chips, but I had a lot left over.   The next day, I went to another home and added some sun dried tomatoes in oil (and about a table spoon of the oil) and it helped the taste a lot (and the guests seemed to love it as they ate it all), however, I didn't like the new color it became... hence my dilemma.   I probably will search for another recipe...

This was too dry as is. I made it with 3 Tablespoons of olive oil and added 3 Tablespoons of fresh squeezed lime juice. Otherwise it was very tasty.

This is great tasting and easy to make. I added half a lime for juice and just a tad bit more garlic. Awesome and will make again.

Excellent! I had to add extra olive oil and doubled the garlic but it was great with multigrain pita chips.

This is pretty good! The only problem I had was that I needed to add about a 1/4 cup of the garbanzo liquid. This definitely has a kick to it!

After adding a cup of cilantro the blender wouldn't blend anything or just for a few seconds. We went through so much time and in the end it wasn't even really hummus, cause there was no consistency. But good luck to you because everyone else seems to be able to do it. LOL!

One thing I have learned: jalapeno + cilantro + garlic = amazing!  I have been making similar hummus for a couple of years.  Extra EVOO is in order, more like 2-3 Tbsp, and juice of one lime.  I took this hummus to work last week and it was gone very quickly.  A definite winner that pairs well with veggies, pita, or tortilla chips.

A decent, fresh-looking dip/spread (not really much like a hummus). Though spicy, it's a little plain. Not as addictive as hummus can and ought to be.
I added some of the chickpea liquid to get it to blend.

I liked it, but there are some changes I'd recommend.  I would prefer using half the garlic (it was a little strong for me).  Also, it's way too thick, compared to typical store bought hummus, so I ended up adding some water and the juice of 1 lime.  Oh and I did not add ANY salt and trust me it still has plenty of flavor (even with well-rinsed garbanzo beans.)

This is difficult at best to process in a blender. There is not enough liquid to process this easily. It is far too heavy on cilantro and not enough jalapeno. I also added tahini and more jalapeno. Sorry this did not resemble a good hummus. Other recipes on this web site are far better.

Great recipe, thanks! I liked that it was made in a blender as not everyone uses food processors. I added 1/3 c sesame tahini as this is a traditional ingredient used in making hummus. I also added a bit more olive oil, and a good squeeze of a ripe lemon.
