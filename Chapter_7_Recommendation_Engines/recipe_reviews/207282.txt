Sorry, you have to turn the duck one more time.It should end with breast side up and total cooking time should be 1 and 1/2 hours.

Good recipe.  Just keep in mind that the total cooking time depends on the size of the duck--mine was 2 1/2 hrs because it was almost 7 lbs.

I have not made duck in 20 + years. This was worth the wait! Ducks are lil guys so I cooked 2, good thing since I have 5 people in the family and one is a 16 yo boy! He had never eaten duck of course and he loved it! The whole family really enjoyed this meal! It is super simple and super Yummy! I told DS I was replacing the T Day turkey with duck and he bout cried. He loves turkey, we can have both next year! I rubbed the duck with the spice mixture and roasted them till they reached 160 degrees.  Moist and delish! Hubby wanted the duck straight up so I went w/o any sauce. I also made the most Fantastic roasted potatoes while the duck was cooking with the duck fat!! OMG They were the best part!! Small red potatoes, salt,pepper and poultry seasoning poured on the fat and cooked till they were golden brown.  Thanks for a Great recipe HE Be GB.

This was definitely a good starter recipe for cooking duck.  I didn't care much for the caraway seed.(not sure if it was taste or mostly texture)But the rest of my family loved this recipe.  So second time around I made one like this and one minus the caraway.  Both were gone quickly.  Thank you for sharing!

First time I roasted a duck, and was a bit hesitant about using the caraway seeds, but went ahead and used them anyway.  Glad I did.  I had to adjust the roasting time, as I had a 6 lb. duck.  I will definitely roast another one!  I will use this recipe ingredients for other roasting ideas, such as chicken, and roasts, and such.  Definitely a great meal!  I drained the fat, and used the remaining juices, and spices, and made a fantastic gravy, that was poured over the pieces of duck in my plate!  There was only one leg, and the bones, left, which will now be "Duck Soup!"
Thanks for a great recipe.
