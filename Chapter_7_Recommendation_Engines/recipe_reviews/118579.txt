This was OK... but I'm giving it 4 because I think it has potential. You really have to double the sauce to have enough to serve with noodles or over rice. Second, since the chicken is already cooked, adding the sauce mixture & then boiling it with the chicken really overcooks the chicken.  I think next time, I will cook the chicken, then remove it & make the sauce... Oh, and I added the rind of one of the oranges for extra flavor.  Still could have used more orange in my opinion.  Some red pepper flakes or chili sauce would have given it more kick. Lastly, added some pea pods, shredded carrots & bean sprouts.

I wont be making this again this way.  I made it exact to the recipe but there wasnt enough sauce so I doubled it.  I also put orange rinds in it because it wasnt strong enough of a flavor.

I used this recipe to base something I wanted to do off of. I preheated my pan and put in some oil, onion, and garlic then I diced my chicken and rolled it in cornstarch. I added the chicken to the pan and let it cook while I zested an orange. When the chicken was about two thirds of the way done I added in the juice of one orange and the zest. I sprinkled on some ginger, soy sauce, and white wine (about 1/2 cup). I let that cook down until it made a nice thick sauce.

I only rated this recipe three stars because I feel it was really missing some key ingredients (garlic, orange zest, white wine).

A good basic idea----Double the sauce--add sliced onions and finely chopped garlic + more soy and ginger+ the zest of the orange.Maybe some Chinese 5 spice and rice noodles on top--DO NOT over cook the chicken--

This is one of my go-to recipes on busy nights. We have tangerine trees, so I use that instead of orange and it is really tasty.  I also use regular onion and stir in a few handfuls of green beans once the sauce is nice and hot. Since our citrus crop was frozen this year, I made this once with canned mandarins that I pureed in the food processor.  Not quite as fresh tasting, but still plenty good!

I like this recipe.  =)  It was tasty and easy to make.  Worth a try!  And is also good with rice noodles on the side, instead of rice.

I added an onion, a bell pepper and used fried soy patties, after boiling them in veggie broth and found this to be a terrific recipe. Vegetarians can love it too.

Thank goodness I decided to sample the sauce before pouring it over the chicken! I followed the recipe, but must've done something wrong. I used low sodium soy sauce, but the salty taste was so strong that I knew I could not eat it. Maybe that was the problem - I rarely use salt.  But the flavor was terrible.   
I had to pour the sauce out and make a different casserole with the chicken.

I enjoyed this simple stirfry - and it happened to be that this was all I had in the hosue anyway! Reading the reviews about lack of flavor, I decided to cook my chicken with juice and soycause instead of adding the sauce afterwards - worked perfectly. I did add a touch more OJ, but that was my personal preference.

I wasn't particulary fond of the flavor as the orange peel added made the dish on the bitter side. Other then that I wasn't impressed and my kids who normally love oranges didn't care for the dish. I would suggest that those who want to blend the orange flavor chop up the fruit, add some orange flavoring if it still isn't enough but hold the rind. I may try making it one more time but definately not a full time recipe.

This is not what I expected. I could tast the soy sauce more than the orange flavor. It looked good in the pan and smelled good, but the taste was not so good. The rice was the best part of the meal!

This was way too salty and didn't have much flavor. I added onions but it didn't help. I won't try this again.

This is a difficult recipe for me to rate. I tasted the sauce prior to adding it to the chicken and didn't care for it. It might have been okay once added to the chicken but i added some honey and found it much more tasty.

Way to salty.  I made this recipe as it was written and then tasted it before I served it.  Thank goodness I did.  I ended up draining off some of the liquid from the stir fry and adding more orange juice with cornstarch to make it eatable.  I may try this again, but I will adjust the ingredients to my tastes.

Pretty good.My family really enjoyed it. Will try to use some of the suggestions for next time I make. Definitely have to make more sauce to pour over rice.

Nice, quick and easy, but  little too salty and not quite orangey enough. Next time I will use more orange juice and less soy sauce (or low sodium soy sauce).

Very good recipe! We added some green pepper, broccoli, and baby bella mushrooms because we've been trying to eat more veggies. However, it would be very good just the way it's written.
