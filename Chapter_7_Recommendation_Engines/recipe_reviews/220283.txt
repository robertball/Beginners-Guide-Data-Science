The flavor of the halibut is overpowered by the canned onions and cheese.

This ruined two beautiful fish fillets. It turned out super spicy, salty and soupy. Won’t make this again

Use less salt! Cooked the topping separate from the fish. Served the topping under the fish. Delicious. Didn’t need a whole red onion. I also didn’t use the canned onions, wasn’t necessary. I also didn’t have fresh parsley so we used dried. Still was an excellent dish. We also used fresh halibut. Definitely making this again.

Anytime we get Halibut this is the way my family likes it. Big hit with my coworkers too. I personally add a sprinkle of ghost pepper seasoning to mine because we like the bite. The sauce to coat it with is good on its own as a dressing or dip for veggies.

The onions did over power it a bit, I now use sweet onions that I sweat with garlic and butter then place on top of Halibut. I like this better, but of course it is all personal taste...

This is a spectacular receipt, as with all receipts it gives you a good start point to adjust as needed for your and your family's taste.  
If you survey all the Halibut Olympia recipes out there this does a great job of bringing in all the options that other people like into one place, so if you have a good supply of fresh halibut then start here and go for it!
