This recipe was wonderful with a slight modification.  Instead of using a tub of cool whip I mixed my own cream and didn't add any sugar to sweeten it.  It cut down on the sweetness of the pie (and the recongnizable sweetened condensed milk flavor) and enhanced the tartness.  This will now be the only recipe I use to make this pie.

my mom and i LOVE key lime pie and this was incredible! we also watch what we eat very carefully, so i used fat free sweetened condensed milk, fat free whipped topping, sugar free pudding, and a reduced fat crust...no one could tell it was low fat at all! they were amazed when i told them.  i added 1 drop of green food coloring to give it the light green color.  the presentation was lovely and this great pie was a real hit!

Love, love, love this recipe!! It was so easy, yet tasted like I slaved over it! I used the bottled Key Lime juice instead of regular lime and my sister and I (who are both avid Key Lime pie fans) thought the tartness was perfect, but my husband thought it a little too tart and added whipped cream to the top of his to cut the tartness. We all agreed the only way to improve this would be to melt white chocolate and pour a thin layer over the crust before adding the filling. I also used the graham cracker crust. I will be making this frequently this summer!

My family loved this!  Some reviewers said only 3/4cup lime juice would be better so I started with that, tasted it, and decided to add more, so it was probably just under 1 cup.  I also used real whipped cream (had some leftover), and a store-bought graham cracker crust.  It was delicious, creamy, a pretty color, and not too sweet or too tart.  There was enough filling leftover to make a little parfait.  Mine was a bit gooey, I found it's better frozen and served straight out of the freezer.

So easy and Delicious. I used lemon pudding rather than vanilla pudding. I used 3 regular limes(not key limes) and 1 lemon. And used half the amount of cool whip called for. I kept everything else the same. The result was a thick and lite Lime Pie. I made it for dessert and my family of 4 adults ate the whole thing that night. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!!

I was very impressed with this "no bake" pie recipe! Super easy, my 11 year old basically made it. We used a store bought nilla wafer crust and it turned out fine. The only advice I would give is to make it a day in advance, it tasted better and was *thicker* the next day. Thanks for posting this! We will make it again and again,

Delicious!  This is one of the best Key Lime Pies I've tasted.  I used a graham cracker crust and only 3/4 cup of lime juice (I think it would have been a bit too tart with any more).  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

As mentioned by an earlier reviewer - using the thawed can of frozen margarita mix in place of the lime juice makes this an incredible dessert. I also recommend making (and baking 8 min) your own graham cracker crust. And ditch the Cool Whip ....use fresh whipped whipping cream instead and you won't regret it. Note: only add 1 tsp powdered sugar to the whipping cream.  This adaptation is VERY rich, but has just the right tartness and not overwhelmingly sweet.

Great tasting! I was a little worried about the taste of the condensed milk but I couldn't taste it at all.  This is a brilliant recipe (I used 1 cup of frozen Limeade concentrate instead of lime juice, so I guess I can only call mine Lime Pie). It was very delicious and better than store bought.  The hubby loved it too and wants me to make it again this weekend.

One of the best Key Lime fakes I've ever made...easy! I used a prepared shortbread crust (which is smaller than 10") and I actually got 2 pies out of this with enough room to have a thin layer of whipped topping on the top....it was perfect for the cookout we had! I got raves for this one....thanks.

I went into the recipe thinking that I would not like it as much as "easy key lime pie I" from this site. But let me tell you this is good! And I'm not sure which is better the easy key lime pie I or this one? Thanks for a keeper!

Loved this. Not too tart or too sweet. I did use key lime juice but left out the zest. If you do use zest be sure to get only the green part, no white (the white is what will make it bitter).  I did add a bit of green food coloring because it made it look good (who cares if it's not "authentic?" Those who won't eat it if it's green are acting like food snobs)and froze it for 3 hours before serving. Excellent and not too rich. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this delicious recipe twice now.  Used graham pie crust once and for a baby shower used little tart shells.  I received constant praise each time a guest enjoyed one.  They are really pretty with a little zest sprinkled on top & sooo easy to make.  I only had 1/2 cup of fresh lime juice so used 1/2 cup of bottled too.  WONDERFUL DESSERT!!!

I made this pie for a luncheon..A man there that travels back and forth to Florida said it was the best Key Lime Pie he had outside of Key West...I used frozen margarita mix.(non alcohol)I thawed it and used it right from the can...It was very very good...Key lime juice is very difficult to find where I live...The man did not know who I was or that I made the pie...so he wasn't just being nice..lol

This was fabulous, so easy! They don't have key lime juice where i live so i had to squeeze the limes with a garlic press) I did however made my own crust and put a thin layer of melted chocolate on it, I also used reduced sugar pudding and topping. I gave this 5 stars because if it tasted absolutely delish with reduced sugar products I'm sure the real products were just as good!

Absolutely delicious! My husband couldn't stop raving! I used a homemade graham crust, and freshly whipped cream in place of the Cool Whip (1 1/4 cups unwhipped). Per reviews that it was too tangy, I cut the lime juice to 3/4 cup. This was a beautiful color with the lime zest throughout. Wonderful! UPDATE: I served this on the dessert table on Christmas Day, garnishing each slice with a rosette of whipped cream and a small piece of fresh lime - it was the first thing gone! Everyone loved it and it is so refreshing in the middle of winter.

Oh my, this was heavenly. I used regular limes, not key limes, and it was the perfect tartness. I made a graham cracker crumb crust to go with it. Was super easy and absolutely divine. Hope it lasts till tomorrow :-)

My store-bought crust was in a million pieces when I got home.  So I piled the filling high into 5 beautiful crystal wine glasses and topped it with whipped topping, a little bit of the crushed shortbread crust, decorated it with a slice of lime of the edge and it was beautiful!  Made it exactly as printed -- it's tart-tart-tart ...and great-great-great! I'll make it again soon!

Erm... how can you possibly think you can go from sweetened condensed milk to evaporated milk or 2% milk?  They're completely different!  Combining sweetened condensed milk with lemon or lime juice makes for a moussy "lemon curd" texture - even on its own, with nothing else added - that makes a yummy filling or spread.  Replacing it with evap or 2% milk is an error, and the understandably sub-par results are surely not the fault of the recipe, which is both easy and delicious.  I give it four stars only because I'm a bit of a purist and prefer real whipped cream instead.  Whipped cream lifts it up to five. :)

Great summertime recipe.  Brought to Fourth of July picnic everyone loved it, especially after a big meal.   I only used 3/4 of a cup of key lime juice, otherwise it's way too tart. Easy Key Lime Pie recipe (just leave enough time to set).

My family does not like key lime pie, but they absolutely love this recipe.  Instead of vanilla pudding, I subbed white chocolate pudding...will always use the white chocolate pudding every time I make it again!  I used homemade sweetened condensed milk (equal parts of sugar and evaporated milk + a splash of vanilla) and fresh limes...I froze it for about 3 hours and served it with real whipped cream that was whipped with a splash of vanilla and a couple of handfuls of 10X sugar. Excellent, excellent pie!

I made two batches of this recipe side by side.  But, I left out (inadvertantly) the pudding mix in one of the batches....and that batch was SO much better!  I also tried this crumbling a graham cracker crust into individual size footed glass bowls.  They were adorable and delicious (without the pudding!)  Lastly,I found a *huge* difference in using fresh limes vs. bottled key lime juice. The bottled juice left a stong imitation lime after taste.  I'll only use fresh lime juice now.

This pie was good.  I decreased the fresh lime juice to 2/3 cup which was more than enough.  Also used a graham cracker crust. Everyone really enjoyed this pie.

This was wonderful and so easy to make.  My husband said it was the best key lime pie he has ever had.  I would agree, especially when comparing it to how easy it was to make.  I also used fat free products and it tasted incredible.  This one will be done many times over.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great base recipe, this turned out lovely and I am such a key lime pie snob! I did substitute key lime juice for the regular lime juice, and made my own whipped cream instead of the frozen kind. Fantastic recipe and pie, A+ (To others -- don't use food coloring, it should be its wonderful natural yellow color!)

Excllent taste, very solid, good texture, we thought it was a little too tart, so we cut back 1/4 cup on the lime juice.

To die for!  I only used 1/2 container of the whipped topping, it seemed to be more than enough!  Great flavor.

This is a fantastic recipe. It's tart, but not quite as tart as most key lime pie recipes I've had. What I don't understand is why some people put green food coloring in it. The way to tell a real key lime pie from a boxed kind is the color. I'd never touch a green pie because I'd assume it was artificially flavored. You remove the credibility of your pie by making it green.

This was excellent!  So easy and so flavorful!  I did use a graham cracker crust and the filling was fluffy and smooth and filled it up nicely.  I also put it in the freezer to chill it quickly and then decided to put it back in the freezer after serving some and when I had a piece the next day, it was fantastic frozen also. Thank you Charlotte for the wonderful recipe,,

Great recipe!!  Came out just like the one at a famous resturant.  Definately a keeper.  I followed some of the suggestions and did substitute whipped heavy whipping cream for the whipped topping as I am not a fan of the frozen type.  I used bottled lime juice and next time would reduce the amount slightly, and also tinted the pie a pale green shade.  Make sure to chill well so the pie keeps its form.  I was in a hurry and didn't have well formed pie slices.

Another good key lime pie recipe.  I didn't have a pie crust on hand, nor did I have a graham cracker crust, put I did have a box of 'Nilla Wafers ®.  I wanted these for a "Girls Night Out" dinner, so I decided to make mini bite-sized pies.  I put one wafer in a mini cupcake cake paper, mixed the filling ingredients as directed, and used my small cookie scoop to fill the cupcake papers.  These set up nicely in the refrigerator and held their shape for 1 1/2 hours out of the fridge.  Yes, they got soft, but they didn't "melt down".  This was a fun way to serve this pie to a group of women.  Everyone had a few of them and there were some for the ladies to take home.  I got 42 minis out of this recipe.

I had no idea what Key Lime Pie was until a friend asked me to make one for his birthday instead of cake a few years back.  I followed the directions exactly and he raved that it was the best pie he’d ever had!  I've made this pie several times since then completely as is. It’s so cheap and easy to put together it’s great for get-togethers and pot lucks. It’s always devoured quickly.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Thanks for the recipe, it was very good pie, but I was expecting something more I guess. I did like that you did not have to use so much condensed milk. Will use this recipe again.

Very good, but better w/ some changes.  I made it the 2nd time with 3/4 cup of fresh lime juice and only 2  tsp. of lime zest - I also used a bought graham cracker crust.  Much better, IMO.  We like to eat it frozen - very refreshing on a hot day.

It was perfect.  We omitted the lime rind, and it was great!!!  I also added a bit of food coloring to make it green. :)  Thanks for this recipe.  It is the only Key Lime Pie I have ever made, and it will be the only one!!

A few nights ago I got a small slice of key lime pie at a restaurant for $6 then decided to try making my own. This recipe was just as good - the taste is incredible (just the right amount of tartness), and even more incredible is how EASY it is to make. I used bottled lime juice and a store-bought graham cracker crust and garnished with thin lime slices. Thanks for sharing!

This is a good variation from the Real Key Lime pie.  Key West would not serve it, however.  And, people, PUHLEEZE.....Key Lime Pie is NOT green.  It is the color of the juice.  I would not touch a piece of green Key Lime Pie.

I thought this would taste a bit like instant vanilla pudding but it doesn't.  It tastes very close to regular baked key lime pie and I didn't think it was too tart, although I did use regular limes.  It's very easy to make.  I had to add some green food coloring because otherwise it is yellow...which is fine too.  I also used a graham cracker crust where I crushed 1 cup of graham crackers, added 3 Tablespoons white sugar and 5 Tablespoons melted butter.  Mixed it together and pressed it into a 9 inch pie pan.  I cooked it at 325 degrees for 5 minutes and let it cool before adding the filling.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

I've made this pie on many occasions and people always rave about it. Don't use key lime juice, it will make it too sour - use regular lime juice like the recipe calls for.

Absolutely the worst food I ever tasted! I figured with so many 5 stars I couldn't go wrong. Well it was worse than wrong. That much juice not only makes it sour, it makes it a very bad sour! The only person that could tolerate it was a smoker we figured it had something to do with damaged tastebuds. Of course this is just my opinion.

excellent recipe!  Used a store bought graham cracker crust, homemade whipped creme, and added a couple drops of green food coloring to the sweetened condensed milk.  Perfect.

This is excellent for a short-cut key lime pie.  I use only 3/4 C. of lime juice instead of 1 C. and I buy a HoneyMaid graham cracker crust.

I'm giving this recipe five stars because it has such a refreshing and tart, but sweet taste.  Although it is the only key lime pie recipe that I have ever made by myself, I'm sure that it is one of the best (if not the best).  It was sooooo easy to make, and it only took about 20 minutes to prepare (no baking).  I used small, already made, pie shells.  Thanks for the great recipe Charlotte.

This was very delicious! I used one cup of real whipping cream instead of the whipped topping in orer to cut back on the sugar. I only put in 1/2 cup of lime juice too. It was a nice refreshing treat for my hubby who has been sick.

Key lime pie is one of many of my favorite desserts & I wanted to find a no bake recipe without eggs.  Well, this was my first time making it & it was somewhat disappointing.  It wasn't bad, it's just that it didn't taste like the key lime pie I'm used to at restaurants, etc.  It was a little too creamy & WAY TOO SWEET!  I think I'll try a traditional version with eggs, except bake long enough to not worry about salmonella!  Any suggestions?

This pie was soooo good! I used a graham cracker crust, and it did not get soggy, of course the pie only lasted two days. I used just regular ole limes from the store. Our store don't carry Key Limes, and do we really want to put anything in our mouth's that come out of South Florida, anyway?? I did not want a recipe that had raw eggs, and this one was perfect! Thanks Charlotte for sharing this one with us.

This was really easy and REALLY Good. I did not use a full cup of fresh lime juice or grated lime zest....Only about a 1/4 of a cup... ( i do not have a juicer) Then the rest was out of the little lime shaped thing you can get at the store....

Nothing special. I followed directions exactly except I added 1/4 cup shredded coconut as another reviewer suggested and no one like it. Everyone said it tasted just like eating a cool whip pie. It also didn't have any green color to it whatsoever, so I added two drops of green food coloring to give it more eye appeal. Still didn't help. Will not make again.

My teenage son loves to make this pie for Thanksgiving.  This is the fourth year he has made it.  Easy and gets rave reviews every time. Thanks for sharing

This was delicious, and it didn't taste like eating straight cool whip like I was worried it might. I used keylime, lime, and lemon juice. I added slightly less than the recipe calls for and it was just right.

I cannot tell you how many times I have made this recipe, but every single time has gotten rave reviews! Yes, this is the slacker's version of Key Lime Pie, and the purists out there will be all up in arms over the pudding mix and frozen topping, but at the end of the day - it's AWESOME.  I use the wee little limes from Mexico, since I live way too far away from FLA to get the real deal, and I give myself carpal-tunnel while reaming every single one of those little suckers for every drop of juice they will yield, but the mouth-watering tartness is totally worth it. Total Dessert Win, Every Single Time.

The vanilla pudding and Cool Whip are very prominent flavors here. I disliked it for that reason. Everyone else that ate it thought it was definitely 5 stars! They were particularly thrilled with the mousse-like texture, which was in fact quite nice, really. I would not reduce the lime juice; keep it at the full cup unless you hate sour desserts, in which case, this might not be the right one for you :) I tinted mine green (spilled the green food coloring -- made it a horrible minty color) and garnished with lime zest. Don't garnish with lime zest overnight -- it looks funky the next day. Just an FYI on that one. Thanks for the recipe!

The easiest and best Key Lime I have tried. This was a bit hit . I have found that a very full 1/2 c of key lime juice is sufficient. Only use key lime, there is a difference!!

Totally delicious.  Once I had 1/2 a cup of key limes, I tasted the juice and it was soooo tart that I decided to use regular limes for the other half.   I also only used 1/2 of an 8oz container of Cool Whip and it filled up a deep dish pan.  I also used the Graham Cracker Crust recipe from the site.

This was perfect. It is very refreshing, so easy and absolutely delicious! I used a graham cracker crust then drizzled it with some white chocolate that I heated up with a little whipping cream and butter. Instead of just garnishing with whipped topping sometimes cover it. I also added a little lemon juice to make it more tart and a drop of green food coloring! This is a great pie to make in quantities too! I have always made 3 at least at a time.   One time I did not have the required amount of lime juice and I found lime pudding at the store, this came out great. Another time a spiced it up and used coconut pudding and added some chopped coconut to the mix and it was great for our luau!   This is a recipe i make over and over by demand, and I can't get enough of it!

As others suggested, I used 3/4 cup of lime juice and still found it a little bitter. My children would not eat it; they said it was too bitter.

The is one of the best Key Lime pies recipes I've ever tried. I love that it's nice and tart. The whipping cream on top really adds to pie. I did how ever change one thing. I used a shortbread crust (flour, butter and crshed pecans) It was yummy. I'll be making this several more times!

This was a good pie.  Not tart enough for my taste.  I used whip cream and not frozen whipped topping.  Might try again to make it tarter...not sure how though.

This is a wonderful key lime pie recipe!  I have had people tell me it is the best they have ever had.  Keep in mind it is a no- bake kind, so it does have a different texture than the traditional kind.  I use the Nellie and Joes key lime juice you can get in the grocery store.  Why use plain old lime juice when the key lime stuff is right there?  I have made this four times.  If you use the Nellie and Joes and like a tart flavor, go ahead and use the cup.  If not, use 3/4 of a cup and it is still great.  If you make it all low fat, I would stick with 3/4 cup of the key lime juice or else it turns out extremely tart.  (but still good...)

we used fat free products due to some diet restrictions, a little freezer time would've helped with consistency but HOLY COW this was yummy.  Will be making again for sure.

Wow! As is, this recipe is VERY tangy. I went over the reviews before I made it and it seemed to be pretty good. I made the pies and though I did notice that they were very sour, I made an unsuccessful attempt to mellow out the sourness by putting extra whipped topping on the pies. Though my family and I downed the pies, not one of us managed to keep a straight face while we ate it (we all kept laughing at each other's pucker-faces). Good recipe, but next time I'll definitely cut down on the lime juice.  :)

WOW delicious!  I did change a few things: I used 1/2 cup lime juice, 2/3 cup milk, vanilla pudding, 1/2 container cool whip and zest. It didn't fill the pie shell so I added a topping: 1/3 cup lite sour cream, tbsp lime juice and zest. It was a bit different but still VERY GOOD. Good frozen the next day too.

Wow!  Sooo easy and sooo good!  I made it even easier and quicker by using a graham cracker crust.  (used FF sw. condensed milk, and Lite Cool Whip) Limes were 99 cents each so I only bought 2 and used bottled lime juice to make up for the rest.  Still outstanding!

This is a great recipe. The grocery store I bought the ingredients at was somehow completely out of limes, so I had to skip the zest and use bottled key lime juice, but it still turned out wonderfully and I got plenty of compliments. I'll definitely make this again.

This pie is very, very tart and the added lime zest makes it even more so, bordering on bitter.  I used actual key limes, not the concentrated juice, and I added 4 ounces of cream cheese because so many reviewers said it was too fluff-like.  This pie was firm as a result, but just too tart.  Maybe half the called for amount of key lime juice and no lime zest would make it a perfect 5 star recipe.  As prepared, none of my kids could eat the whole piece.  I do like the idea of a key lime pie with vanilla pudding and whip cream, rather than egg yolks for safety reasons, so I will tinker with it.  I have lots of hope for this recipe to turn to a 5 star with a little less lime.  Please add the cream cheese if you want a firmer cream pie.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!!! It's so tasty and so easy to make. I used a pillsbury refridgerated pie crust, bottled key lime juice, and extra creamy whipped topping along with the rest of the ingredients...I wouldn't change a thing. It seems as though you are going to have too much filling once you start pouring it into the crust, but just keep going, it settles a bit after awhile and gives you a nice thick sturdy piece of pie.  The only other recipe I've used for Key Lime Pie is one from the "Betty's Pies" (famous diner in Two Harbors, MN) cookbook, I think this one is better...sorry, Betty!

I've tried other recipes and this is the BEST. I also like "Easy Key Lime Pie I", but I made both for some friends and this pie won hands down! It has a better "sour" twist to it. I followed the recipe to a tee and it was perfect. No need to tweek it at all!

This was very good!! everyone seemed to like it, my mom even took the leftovers with her to work the nexr day. I think the only thing I would change is instead of using a whole tub of whipped cream i would half it,I found I had way too much filling for the size of my crust I could have made 2 pies if I had done this. I did'nt find this pie to be either too tart or too sweet, perfect

Hubby had been begging for Key Lime Pie ever since I bought Key Lime Juice by mistake.  I decided to try this recipe and he said it was incredible!  I only made one change and that was to use a graham cracker crust.  I even tried it and thought it was very refreshing and I don't care for the taste of limes.  It wasn't too tart or tangy.  I had extra filling so I put it on graham crackers and froze them for a frozen treat.  Those were really great also!  Definitely a make again recipe

This was a little tangy.
Would have been nice to know how many limes to use for the fresh lime juice.
I think it's like 10 limes.

I made it according to directions for our annual Men's Pie Social - it was a hit! Excellent key lime flavor, none of that fake taste you get from using lime jello.

Excellent recipe, light and very tasty!  Suggestion to add 3-4 drops of green food coloring.

This was the easiest, and best Key lime pie I ever made. It comes out perfect every time.  It was a big hit at the party.  I did cut the lime juice down to 3/4 cup. Pure perfection Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great pie - nice and tangy.  It is so easy and so good.
I will add this to my favorite recipes.  Great made with lemon too.

I love this version of the pie. It's very simple to make and very tasty. It doesn't take long at all. I added green food coloring to make it look green and to add it just for fun. Also, it's great with Redi-Whip on top. I will be making this dessert more often. Thanks Charlotte!

This is was an easy way to enjoy Key Lime pie.  It was sweet & tart.  Yum!  The guys fought for the left over slices.  I think it would be great with a graham cracker crust.

Have made this lots exactly as written -  5 stars for taste and ease! Also, have found through trial and error that the store bought graham cracker and/or shortbread crusts taste great, as well as bottled key lime juice. Otherwise, 5-7 limes usu yields about a cup of juice. Can add some vanilla bean paste to lime/pudding mixture with nice results, too! Make this!

This pie was delicious.... I tried as other viewers suggested to use less of the lime juice but ended up adding the full amount for that full flavour.  I did find that the flavours seemed to mellow the next day. I was asked to make it again after a couple days the first one was gone!! A keeper recipe!

This was OK. I added 4 oz cream cheese but the sweetened condensed milk added a different texture and flavor.

We have a lime tree so when I came across this recipe I was so excited. My hsuband was a bit skeptical of a lime pie but he tried it anyway. I have probably made this recipe a couple of dozen times since. For pot lucks and parties people aske me to make this.

Easy recipe, I followed it to the letter and I got a good result. Maybe a wee bit tangy with all the lime but still fabulous. It took a while to set so I couldn't eat it the same night I made it. I put it in the freezer over night and by the next day it was terrific. I did NOT add additional sugar because I found the condensed milk & pudding mix was sweet enough. Next time maybe I'll do only 1/2 cup lime juice and 1/2 tbsp of zest to tame the tangyness. Great & super-easy recipe though!

This is a wonderful pie!  I used prebaked graham cracker crust.  Instead of fresh lime juice, I used 1/4 cup bottled lemon juice and 3/4 cup frozen limeade.  I used lots of lime zest from one lime...and the licking began!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great!  The filling had very smooth thick creamy texture.  I made a traditional graham cracker crust and added sweetened coconut to replace the sugar.  I also used cheesecake flavored pudding because I had it on hand, yummy!  This was a little tart and like other reviews will make again with 3/4 lime juice.  Such a simple, light, summer recipe!

Yum! I made this one with fat free sweetened condensed milk (SCM) & Cool Whip Lite®, and it came out AWESOME. I was a little afraid to attempt the "healthier" version (only 1 can of SCM and no eggs), but both my husband and I licked our plates... literally!

Easy and delicious!  Everybody raves about this when I make it.  I use a graham cracker crust, which is super easy to make, just crushed graham crackers and some melted butter.  I get key limes, which are available at Trader Joe's if you have one near by.  I use my garlic press to juice them.  One bag of key limes makes a little less than a cup, but it turns out great.  Be careful not to put too much zest in though because it will make it a little bitter.

I followed this recipe exactly as it's written. It tasted delicious but it had the consistency of wall paper paste. It was very gooey. I had to freeze it in order for it to set. I think next time I'll follow a Key Lime Pie recipe that doesn't call for instant pudding.

I make these 4 at a time.  Easy!  Great tasting.  I add green food coloring to make them taste better to the eye and use a chocolate graham cracker crust pie shell.  People can't wait until spring (Lent) each year when I make a dozen for church.  Don't tell anyone how easy it is!

Great recipe!  Very quick and easy.  I used a shortbread crust instead of the pie crust.  I also whipped in softened cream cheese to cut down on the tartness of the flavor but carefully blended in some lime juice into the extra cool whip to get the lime flavor throughout the pie.

This was certainly easy and quick, no complaints there.  I do prefer the graham cracker crust on my key lime.  But overall, a tasty pie.

This was awesome. It's creamy and tangy and sweet with tons of lime flavor. I love lime! I ended up using about 12 small limes to get all the juice. It made more than enough filling for the shell, so maybe next time I can get a bigger shell. The leftovers were awesome as a dip with graham crackers though!

Fantastic!  I read reviews prior to making so I cut down on the lime zest and used already bottled lime juice and decreased that amount a little too.  I also put in a graham cracker crust.  I am big on presentation so I piped whip cream around the edges and lightly sprinkled with lime zest.  I made it for my husband for Father's Day and it was fabulous on a hot summer day!  Will for sure make again.  It went fast!!

Very yummy. Would make it again and cut the lime juice down to 3/4c. And for those of you who are wondering what the nutritional numbers are when you substitute reduced-fat graham cracker crust (Ready-Made, Keebler brand), low-fat sweetened condensed milk (Eagle Brand),and Lite Cool Whip, here are the details per serving. I used regular Jell-O Instant Pudding because the fat-free/sugar-free was 1oz and the recipe called for 3.5oz and I wasn't sure it would work.  (cal/fat/carb/prot)  Pudding	(45/0/11.5/0), Crust (100/3.5/15/1), Whip (62.5/3.1/9.4/0), Lime Juice (8.25/0/2.8/0.14), Condensed Milk (162.5/1.8/28.7/3.75), TOTAL per serving (378.3/8.4/67.4/4.9)

This is seriously the best key lime pie ever.  It's super easy and it's the perfect blend of sweet and tart.  I will be using this recipe often!

I made little "dessert shooters" in disposable shot glasses. I topped each with a squirt of canned whipping cream and a sprinkling of crushed crumbs (instead of crust). Huge hit! Just the right amount of tangy sweetness. Loved 'em!

This recipe is undoubtedly awesome!  I also tried a substitution of white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla pudding-wow!  Either way, this recipe rocks!  :)

Whoah- this was good! I'd never made key lime pie before, but this was simple and tasted delish! I made my own crust out of gingersnaps, and the flavors really popped. We loved it!

I use this recipe constantly and it is always a hit!  It is very easy to make and ends up with a very creamy texture.  I use a reduced fat crust, and sugar free and/or fat free ingredients and you cannot tell the difference.

Wow! Excellent recipe and REALLY easy.  I served this at my in-laws house.  They love key lime pie but have never found one quite as good as the pie in Key West.  Until now!  Everyone LOVED the pie (and these people are stingy with the compliments).  I used fresh whipped cream and pre-made graham cracker crust.  I will make this again and again!

This is a great recipe!  I used real Key limes and juiced them.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use a graham cracker crust.  I took it to dinner with friends and was sad when one of them told me he didn't care for Key Lime Pie-- but he liked it!  He said he likes pies that showcase the flavor of the lime, and this one fits the bill.  My family loves it and I'll be making it frequently.

By far the most flavor of the easy key lime pie recipes.  I used the 9" graham craker crust. It fit fine. Next time I will bake one.  The recipe is so easy it is worth it.

I made this recipe just as stated and the pie was fine, but not the kind of Key Lime Pie recipe that I was looking for. It did have a nice tangy flavor and a good amount of sweetness. It was just way too fluffy. I served this at a dinner party and only 2 out of 6 of us ate our whole piece of pie. Everyone else had a bite or two and threw in the towel.

This pie was delicious and so easy to make. I did a few things different to make it a little healthier and my husband couldn't even tell it was low-fat! 

I used a reduced fat graham cracker crust, sugar free vanilla pudding, low fat cool whip, and fat free sweetened condensed milk. 

I will definitely make this again and again!

It was great. I needed to add some extra limes and lime juice to make it a little bit more tart, but it came out great and was very easy.  I also grated lime on top when I was finshed for added decorative flare.

Really good flavor and definitely easy.  I used Key Limes from my tree (hey, it's Florida) and it was the perfect degree of tartness.  I think it will be better with Graham crust next time.  Also, it's hard to get zest without pith from the limes.  Very good pie, thanks!

Very easy and delicious.  Stick to no more than one cup lime juice if you're using real key limes as more makes it quite tart.

Delicious! I used fresh grated lime zest which gave the filling a different texture than I'm used to, but definitely enhanced the flavor. I also used a graham cracker crust.

I used 1/2 the juice as I didn't have fresh and added food coloring as suggested by another review and it was perfect.  I could never get away with a fake Key Lime pie in my family, but there was no complaints.  It disappeared.  Great recipe, easy and delish...

This is the best key lime pie! I accidently used the 5.1 ounce box of pudding so I added more lime juice.  It turned out terrific. Next time I might use fresh whipped cream instead of the frozen topping...Worth trying.

This was an awesome recipe the reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because it was too sweet for my taste. I would definitely make it next time using only 3/4 of the can of the condensed milk and the low sugar version of the pudding.I topped it with the Whipped Cream Filling recipe and it looked fantastic. Thank you!

Very simple to make, and very tasty. I used bottled lime juice and about half the required zest for time. Nevertheless, there was ample lime flavor and the pie was very good.

I used a regular baked pie crust, 1/2 cup lime juice, sugar free vanilla pudding mix (the 4 serving package), and low-free sweetened condensed milk. I also added a few drops of green food coloring.  The pie is sweet and tart, great creamy texture, almost like mousse.

Thanks so much for this, Charlotte! My husband is watching his cholesterol intake, and this pie can be made practically cholesterol-free and tastes fantastic!  I took the others' advice and used 3/4 c lime juice, which was perfect. To lighten it further, I used Jello's Fat Free/ Sugar Free Cheesecake pudding mix (the 4 serving package) along with Cool Whip Free, and fat-free sweetened condensed milk. I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract, too.  I took this to a get-together and it was a big hit!

I have made this pie several times and everyone asks for the recipe!  It is sweet and tart at the same time and I love it.  Super easy to make!  Takes about 15 minutes total to make.  Tastes good out of the freezer.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is the best key lime pie I have ever tasted! I used the 2 extra servings graham crust instead of the regular and added a little extra whipped cream on top. It is the perfect combination of sweet and sour. YUM! Thanks Charlotte!

This pie was really good, especially for how easy it was to make AND for the fact that one could make it nearly Fat Free.  My husband really liked it, as he is a fan of Key Lime Pie but always feels so heavy and gross after he consumes even a little slice of the more traditional version with all of the egg yolks...so in his opinion I suppose the recipe would receive 5 stars.  I, on the other hand, thought it was good, but I think I would cut down on the lime rind because it was just too "limey"...not too tart, but too much rind flavor...Still a fablous recipe overall though!  Wonder how this recipe would translate to a Lemon Meringue Pie??

Easy, easy, easy!  I only had 1/2 cup fresh lime juice, and added bottled to complete amount.  Next time I think I would reduce the amount, it came out very tart and tangy!  We added some additional whipped topping when we served it to help balance out the tartness and it was great!

This is so easy.  I used a graham cracker crust because I didn't want to heat up the kitchen.  Also, I substituted regular milk for the evaporated milk and whipped cream (unsweetened) for the whipped topping.  Came out soooooo good.

Best key lime pie!! I love it because it has lots of lime flavour, and doesn't just taste like sweetened condensed milk. Instead of key limes, I just used 5-6 regular limes (less labour intensive). I used a bit extra zest for more lime flavour. I also substitued 8oz of real whipping cream instead of the whipped topping. (whipped it up with a couple tsp of sugar).

I added 1-8oz package of low fat cream cheese, to the rest of the ingredients. I put everything into the food processor to help make it very creamy and folded in 1/2 of the container of cool whip, the rest I used on top.  My husband & I loved it, the perfect blend of sour and sweet.

Delicious!!!! The first time I made this I used vanilla pudding mic but the second time I omitted the the pudding and it tasted just as delicious. I made this for father's day and my dad loved it.  I made it again for a party and it was gobbled up.  This is so easy and so delicious.  Yummmmm is all I can say.

Amazing!  I made my own shortbread crust, then zested 3 limes, used the juice of 4 limes, plus the juice of 1 lemon, and I was still under 1 cup.  That's the only downside of this recipe - all the juicing!  But the flavor and tartness is amazing.  I also love to watch the filling thickening up once you fold in the cool whip.  Alchemy :)

Used fresh limes, sliced juiced and whole tossed into sauce pan with 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup confectionary sugar.  Simmered and strained, added two packets of gelletin.  Had a great taste to it, but I'm not a huge lime fan. My brother and wife absolutely loved it.

Super delicious and extremely easy to make - best key lime pie I've ever made!  I brought this to a 4th of July party and it was gone as soon as it was cut up, with everyone asking me to make it again.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was quite good and easy to make; however, I couldn't give it more stars since it had the underlying artificial taste of Cool Whip.  If I made this again, I'd whip my own from whipping cream.

Easy peasy pie!! Had a pastry shell and key lime juice in the freezer, so this recipe was calling out...turned out beautifully tart and tangy...no cool whip, substituted hand whipped cream with no sweeting...NICE!

Everyone loved it! Adding decorations on top or even just sprinkling some ground up lime peel really creates an awesome effect.

I had a bunch of extra limes tonight and decided a key lime pie sounded good.  So I came to look for recipes and found this one.  It is great!!  The texture was wonderful, the taste was right on and it was so easy!  I will be using this one again!

VERY good. I typically like sweeter things but this was very tangy. I'm from Florida so I used real key limes, and I'm not sure if they're more sour than regular limes? But this was the best I've ever had!

I'm only giving 4 stars but only because from a texture standpoint I do not prefer so much whipped topping mixed in the batter. I only addded 5 ounces of whipped topic and feel like I'd pull it down even more...maybe down to a couple ounces so that it has more of a heavy texture. I also used key limes (took me forever to get all those things squeezed but the flavor was worth it).  The flavor was absolutely delicious!! Dreamy and perfect. Will definitely make again!

I used lime instead of key lime and didn't add whipped cream since I felt it was already so soft. I think 1 cup of lime is too much. I have a hard time eating a big slice since the acidity level is too high for my liking. next time 3/4 cups if I redo it.

I was looking for a recipe to replicate the J. Alexander key lime pie and this is as close as it gets! I made a few changes: I omitted the rind, I added two drops of food coloring to get the light green color, I used fresh key lime juice - about 24 key limes. It takes a while to juice but well worth it. I hate cool whip so I used canned whip cream but only 1/4 cup since I love the fresh, tart flavor. For those who love tartness you can increase the key lime juice (way better!) but if you like sweetness then reduce the juice. I used a store bought graham crust. Let it set in refrigerator for 2 hrs, great taste!

I made this for my brother in law because Key Lime is his favorite pie. I am not normally a fan, but I really enjoyed this pie. So did he, and he's requested it several more times! Be careful not to add too much of the lime rind because it can make it too bitter. I also use heavy whipping cream in place of the cool whip. Great flavor!

I followed the reviews and used 3/4 Cup Lime juice, whipped cream and graham cracker crust. It was more like a Key Lime CREAM Pie... but it rocked :)

Very good but very tart.  Next time I will either reduce the lime juice or up the sweetened condensed milk.  Another reviewer used frozen limeade concentrate.  That sounds good too.

I do not like lime or lemon anything... but this! I love this pie!!! It was just a little tart... but still great! I used bottled key lime juice and a graham cracker crust. I just need to figure out how to make it a little sweeter, but I will continue making this pie! Very good!!!

This recipe was good except the lime zest made little chunks in the pie, and it was not good.  Only eat one slice, or you will get a stomach ache.

This pie is absolutely delicious.  I used a premade pie crust.  I found that 1 cup of lime juice was perfect, but I like mine really tart.  I too was skeptical about adding vanilla pudding, but it worked out well.  I will definately make this one again.

Extremely easy and delicious too!  Great Summer treat and no time to make.  I wasn't sure if you had to make the pudding first and then mix or just add the mix without the milk, so I am trying it both ways.  The first time I made it I mix the pudding with the milk and it was really runny so we'll see how it works without it.

This recipe has changed my mind on the difficulty of making pies!  I have made this twice and got rave review both times.  The secont time I added about 20 drops of food coloring to make it green, but either way this is a great refreshing pie!

Used a grahamcracker crust. Decided to use 1/3 of the cool whip in the pie and use the rest for eating on top of the pie pieces, and replaced 1/3 of fresh lime juice with lemon juice to make it sweeter. Worked perfectly, very good pie!

All of my coworkers at the fire house loved this pie.  Loved it so much that i got applause and hugs.  They didn't believe how easy it was so they all walked away with a copy of the recipe.

This recipe is easy...fast....and very impressive.  So many people have asked for this recipe.  This was a real hit!  It takes about 10 minutes start to finish!  It's very rich and goes a long way.  Thanks for sharing this!

Yum! Nice and just right!  I hate to heat up the kitchen in the Summer to bake dessert.  This was the perfect complimentary dessert to the grilled chicken and salad we had for dinner.  Thank you!  I used less lime juice because 2/3rds cup was all I had.

This was excellent!  We used the sugar free/ fat free pudding, lite Cool Whip,and 3/4 C of lime- it was perfect!

Thanks for an awesome recipe.

This is delicious!  I used Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice.  It made it very tart (that's why only 4 stars).  Next time I think I will cut the juice down a little.  Make sure to use a deep dish pie crust, as the recipe makes a good amount of filling.  I could have made a second pie with the extra filling, but I filled small dessert cups with it, piped on some extra whipped topping and called it Key Lime Mousse!

I have made this key lime pie at least once a month for several months and it never fails to ring up compliments.  So easy too make.  Fail proof recipe.  Thanks Charlotte.

Not very good. Maybe that's because I messed with the recipe a bit (did someone's suggestion of using 1% milk), and the lime juice was WAY too much. The pie got soggy and very watery, my family and I didn't like it.

Loved this recipe!  So quick and easy to make.  I made this twice, and both times I used little tart shells.

I made the mistake of making this pie at work.  Wrong thing to do!  The girls I work with like it so much (as do I) that since I first made it (May of this year), I've made eleven of them, plus the girls all have a copy of this recipe and they've made their own, too!!  I believe you could "LIME" yourself to death with this!!!!!!!!!!
