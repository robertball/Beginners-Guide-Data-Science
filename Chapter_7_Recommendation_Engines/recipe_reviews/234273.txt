This recipe was made as written with the only exception that I added a tsp of garlic powder, three tbsps of celery and onion to the stuffing.  The stuffing I used was Pepperidge Farm Sage and Onion Stuffing.  Absolutely fantastic and is now a member within  the family rotation of meals.  Thanks.

If you're looking for a quick meal, this is it.  Fast and easy.  It does remind you of Thanksgiving.   I did sprinkle some garlic powder on top before cooking as it needed a little something.  These were very good, and I'll make them again.

I've made these multiple times before I ever found the recipe on this site & they are amazing! They are super easy and quick to make. You can also switch or up and add instant potatoes vs stuff on the turkey roll up!

Easy Peasy!  
Pick the Stove Top Stuffing you like, roll them up - nuke and dinner is on the table. 
I served with cranberry sauce, carrots and some leftover potatoes.
