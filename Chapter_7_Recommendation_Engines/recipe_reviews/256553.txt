I haven’t made this yet but I’m wondering why anyone would want to get 4 skillets dirty to make a pizza that could just be placed on a baking sheet covered with the above ingredients cooked in the grease from the original bacon.  And for breakfast I’ d consider adding over easy eggs as a final touch.

no eggs, low sodium, low fat, low flavor and a lot of skillets.  Not sure where breakfast comes in.  Try fresh spinach with bacon as your toppings. Use a pancake batter into a hot skillet for the base  instead of the factory trademarked industrial crust.  Skip the pepper and drizzle with maple syrup.  You will be amazed.  New science has now debunked the low salt and low fat myths.  Enjoy your food again!

I don't know what people are complaining about but the recipe is pretty good.
Ok so you do have to use common sense and make some adjustments to mach you oven temperatures. 
People are saying you need multiple skillets, no you don't.
Cook the bacon in the skillet, drain off some fat, saute the onions in the fat remove, lay out pizza dough in skillet and add toppings and bake.

Too many steps and much trouble for breakfast!  You can just make it and put it into the oven like making a regular pizza.  Sounds good though.  I might try it.

It needed salt, but was enjoyed by all. Didn't hurt that it was a stunning dish to present as well!

I used some shortcuts: first cooked bacon in the skillet; removed the bacon and then cooked onion in the bacon grease (if there is too much grease just remove the excess) and then put the pizza dough in the same skillet which has now been perfectly seasoned with the bacon and onion.

Great inside ingredients but when baked as recipe said, it was very burned on the bottom.  I would not cook on high on stovetop until cheese melts. That’s where it really burned FAST. May make again but drastically changing the way it’s cooked/baked.
