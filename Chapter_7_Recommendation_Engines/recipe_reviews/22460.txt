DANGEROUS if directions are followed as written.  First of all these little buggers are a pain to make but I like a good challenge and ended up coming up with a system that worked.  But BE CAREFUL the instructions say to cook the pot stickers in oil and then add water.    I knew water and oil didn't mix so I tried to add the water carefully to the side of the pan and hot grease went flying everywhere.  I even got burnt on my cheek.  I then came up with a two skillet solution (frying the pot stickers in one pan and then moving them to a 2nd pan for steaming).  Also I highly recommend keeping a couple eggs mixed with a bit of water in a bowl near your prep area because you will have to use it to get the wrappers to stick.  I coated each of the four sides of the wrapper as it was laying out flat before putting the mixture in.  Then after the wrapper was closed I wet my fingers again with egg wash and coated the outside seam.  I would have given this recipe 4 stars for the end result because I think they turned out well but the danger of mixing oil with water really needs to be addressed in the main writing of this recipe.  Recommend this review so it gets near the top if you think this is as serious issue as I do.

Fantastic recipe! A lot like the pot stickers my mom and I make together. You can put pretty much anything into these (tofu, bean sprouts, onion, different kinds of meat, etc) but it is very important that you squeeze as much liquid out of the filling (if you use tofu or a lot of vegetables) as you can before you stuff your wrappers or they will tear as you cook them. And as you seal the wrappers try to squeeze out as much air as you can or they can tear as they cook. The amount of water to steam them is completely dependant on the thickness of your wrappers. I got some from Walmart that were delicious, but a little thin so they didn't need too much water (3/4 c?) My mom's from the asian market were much thicker and needed a lot of water (about a cup, maybe more). Cooking the pork beforehand is completely unnecessary. You can also cook them by just frying them on both sides or boiling them in soup. They freeze very well, but will need an extra minute or two for cooking time.

Excellent. Ommitted the cabbage and added more water chesnuts. Sauce is wrong tho. Try 
2T. soy sauce,2T. rice wine vinegar,1/2 tsp sesame oil & 1tsp. minced scallion. 
As always well worth the time and effort.

I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: I used one pound uncooked ground pork (they're much easier to make this way, and this is how they do it in China) and about 1/2 cup finely shredded cabbage, and no waterchestnuts, to make about 45 pot stickers (or dumplings) using the round wrappers for dumplings available at Asian markets is best--they're thinner. I covered a deep frying pan with PAM--and sprayed some on the dumplings themselves--then browned bottoms for about 4 min. Then I slowly added 1/2 water to pan, covered, and steamed for 10 min. Then I uncovered the pan and let them cook until all the water was gone. (Made this in three batches.)If you're afraid the pork is not completely cooked, you may steam/cook longer, but usually that's plenty of time. Another excellent sauce is to simply combine balsamic vinegar and a small amount of chili oil (avail. at Asian market)in a bowl for dunking.

Wow what a great recipe.  I've made these twice, the second time I cooked them a little differently.Heated 2 tblsp. of oil over medium heat.  Lightly browned them until golden on the bottom then poured 1 cup of water into the skillet and covered immediately.  Cooked them over medium heat until most of the liquid was gone. Uncovered and continued cooking until the liquid was entirely gone and they were golden on the bottom.  I served them with Szechwan sauce I purchased at Safeway.  My husband went crazy over them!!!  The also freeze very well.

This recipe was excellent!!!! Similar to the ones you would get from a Chinese restaurant, or even Friday's. I made modifications to the recipe, not because I felt they needed it, but because I was trying to make these a little more healthy. I did omit the cabbage (I haven't seen ones with cabbage in them), and I used ground chicken instead of pork. I used ground ginger. I also added minced carrots and onions. I left the ground chicken raw, and mixed the ingredients, then cooked them in peanut oil instead of sesame oil, and then steamed them in chicken broth. While steaming, I placed a top on top of the skillet. I also steamed for additional 7 minutes - wanted to make sure the ground chicken was thoroughly cooked. I also used Leanne's sauce of 2 TBSP soy sauce, 2 TBSP rice wine vinegar, 1 tsp sesame oil, and 1 tsp minced scallion, which was right on point. Loved this recipe and will definitely make again!!!!

This recipe is incredible.  However, I'm going to address the review that states that this cooking method is unsafe.  These are traditionally cooked this way.  I cook them in a pan with oil and, when they are lightly browned, you add water which will remain on top of the oil (because they don't mix) and you continue to cook them until the water boils off.  Continue to cook them until they are slightly crispy.  There is no danger in cooking them this way, so please don't be afraid based on the directions in this recipe.

tastes exactly like my Grandma Kwong's!  
For people whom don't realize how to cook them, it is true that you first put them in a touch of oil to brown the bottoms (meaning the fan is at the top and a flat side must be formed for the bottom), and then add a little bit of water for steaming.  For those that state that this isn't right, believe me it is...I am Chinese and was raised in a chinese home.  This is the traditional way on how to cook them.  As well, to keep the dough together and be able to do the fan folding seam, DO NOT USE EGG!  Use water, egg gives them a unappealing taste!

These were wonderful--a lot of work though but worth it.  I combined two recipes together.  I only used 1/2 c. chopped cabbage, using the blender method to chop.  It was easy this way, just make sure you squeeze the water out before adding it to the mixture.  I also didn't precook my pork, just mixed and let it sit while I made the dough.  If you want to make your own dough, use 2 c. flour and 3/4 c. + 2 Tbsp. water--allow to rest for 30 min.  Then roll out to 1/8" thick and cut with 3" circle cutter.  Make sure these are really cooked before serving since the pork wasn't precooked.  Mine took about 15 min. total.  First I browned them in a little oil for 5 min. then poured 1/3 c. water  and covered tightly, simmering 10 min. or until liquid is gone.  Enjoy!

My husband and I thought that these were very good.  I steamed them with a little chicken broth which gave them a nice flavor.  I also put some in the freezer and pull out a few whenever we want a little appetizer.

I added a bit of red pepper flakes to the filling. A bit confused on step 4; stir constantly after adding pot stickers? I just added pot stickers to heated oil, browned the bottoms, added the water, COVERED, and simmered for about 10 minutes. Did not add additional oil.

The dipping sauce is incredible! I also like to saturate the pot stickers in the sauce and serve them that way.

ARE YOU KIDDING?? these are perfect, easy and totally fantastic! I did not add the water chestnuts, cut everything super fine and DO NOT cook the pork first. If you don't want the oil and water to splatter when you add together, take the pan off the heat for 15 to 20 seconds..add water, cover..ALL GOOD. It really makes 15-16 little guys, takes about 10-15 minutes of cook time. SUPER-DUPER!

These pot stickers are delicious and not at all dangerous IF you know how to cook with oil and water.  I had no trouble at all with this so called dangerous spattering.  As my grandmother always said, "the deeper the pan, the less the spatter and always have a lid handy".

These dumplings were really good.  I made them for my family and friends and they were gone-fast!  It does take a little time to make, but worth it.

These were a little time consuming for me, but worth it. I did keep the meat mixture raw and it made about 32 for me. I placed them on a cookie sheet and froze them and then placed them in baggies of 8 for later meals. When I pulled them out, I put on a cookie sheet again, sprayed them with cooking spray, and baked at 375 for 15 mins or so (until they were looking brown and crispy). Served with egg drop soup II from this site and oriental dipping sauce also from this site. Great light dinner. Thanks for sharing!

Step four was confusing. I consulted Alton Brown's instructions.  Put the pot stickers in the pan lightly coated with oil and do not stir or touch for two minutes.  Then add 1/3 cup chicken broth, turn the heat down and cook for two minutes.  They came out perfectly.  A lot of work but a fun Sunday afternoon project for my daughter and me.  Had to run several batches through my cast iron skillet to cook them all.  We made some sticky rice for dipping in the sauce, and together this made a full meal and even some leftover pot stickers.

I am also using raw ground pork and I might add some shrimp and less cabbage.  I am also heating the pan to medium heat first, then adding 2 T oil, then the potstickers for 1 minute.  Add 6 T water, much less water, cover immediately, turn down heat to simmer and cook for 6 minutes, uncover and cook until water is gone and bottoms are brown.

Yum! The filling was delish! Tasted so authentic, I couldn't believe that I made it :) I considered a previous reviewers advice to take the pot stickers from the oil pan to a pan with water to steam, however my bf is Chinese, so I called his mom and she said to do it exactly as the recipe. The trick I think is to heat the oil on medium heat, not high. Worked beautifully! I'm going to show her how, thanks to allrecipes.com,  I'm an Asian chef!!

DELICIOUS recipe, but you should follow comments on cooking directions.

Lots of great flavor! The filling was so good I found myself eating a bit of it here and there as I stuffed the dumplings.

For cooking, I recommend steaming the dumplings first, then pan frying them just enough to darken them and make them crispy. I tried the way described in the recipe and I couldn't get them to come out right, plus there was a lot of spattering, even in a deep pot.

TIP: Mix a little corn starch and water to make a glue to seal the dumplings. It works REALLY well without altering the flavor.

5 stars and then some.  These were so good.  I followed the recipe as written except I used ground chicken instead of ground pork.  I also added one raw egg to the meat mixture before putting them together and it helped (thank you to the other reviewers for suggesting it).  I cooked them on the stove top in two batches.  I found that the 3/4 cup of water you add when cooking them is way too much so I cut it in half with the second batch and got much better results.

Delicious recipe! A safer and easier way to cook these is to put both oil and water into the pan at the same time before adding the pot-stickers. Cover with lid and steam for about 6 minutes on medium-high heat, then remove the lid and cook for about 2-4 more minutes, allowing the water to evaporate and the remaining oil to brown the pot-stickers on one side. Watch closely to prevent burning. I make my dipping sauce with 1-1 rice wine vinegar and soy sauce, and add chili sauce, minced green onions, and minced fresh ginger to taste.

This recipe is FABLULOUS.  It's very tasty. I have made it several times for parties and they are not only fun to make, but delicious. Always the first thing gone.  The only changes that I make--I use ground turkey instead of pork to cut the fat, and instead of chili oil I use a few tablespoons of Sweet Thai Chili Sauce. SO YUMMY. Fun to make, fun to eat.

The actual filling inside the pot stickers was pretty tasty even though I used ground chicken.  I altered the recipe by not marinating the meat mixture over night and adding a lot more ginger(diced fine), chili oil and sesame oil to the meat mixture for flavor for that very reason.  Also added a little green onion.  Delicious!!  I will say it was a pain to make them and that whole fry/boil potsticker method did NOT work for me.  Next time I will buy a bamboo steamer.

These tasted great, that was not the issue. I did have a huge problem with cooking them, however. First of all, I bought egg roll wrappers and then saw that the recipe said to fill with 1 Tablespoon of filling, so I cut my wrappers into 4ths. Then I wrapped them all, which if you take 15 wrappers and multiply them by 15, it was a BIT time consuming. I then cooked them exactly how it is suggested in the recipe. It was a disaster. They would not come off of the pan for the life of me. I had about 50 left to cook, so I tried various different tricks to try and get them not to stick, which all failed. I know they are called 'potstickers', but how is it worth all of the work if you are left with a ripped up mess of cabbage and dumpling tops? I was so frustrated after the 3 hours of making dinner I almost chucked the pan accross the room. Granted, I've never made potstickers before, so maybe I'm missing some trick, or something, but it should be in the recipe if there is.

This was a great recipe... my 2 kids loved it! I did cheat in one way & wanted to share it with everyone... instead of shredding my own cabbage I bought a bag of pre-shredded cole slaw mix! It even had a few shredded carrots in it!

I can never find a chinese restarant that has pot stickers on the menu.  I only found one once.  Now that I have this recipe, I don't need to look for it.  The recipe is great.

Thisw isn't a good recipe. Its very bland and it also suggests wonton wrappers but they are not the correct kind for true pot stickers. You need rounded wrappers for that. Also YOU ARE A MORON if you think this is dangerous. For 1 if the oil starts jumping when you add water it means you are cooking at too high of a temperature. 2 by the time you add the water the oil should be pretty much cooked up. There shouldn't be more than just a shiny coating left.

Taste like the authentic pot stickers that I grew up with when I was a kid. The only change i made was added a little sherry to it. I also wrapped it with potsticker (round) wrappers rather than wonton wrappers. I made a dip, using 2 Tb soy sauce, 2 Tb water, 1 Tb rice wine vinegar, green onions, ginger & sesame oil. Really good! I would fry the bottoms of the pot stickers til it browns on bottom, throw in about 3-4 Tb of water, put lid on and it's ready when the water are all absorbed. I will try it next time boiling it, like I remembered when I was a kid.

This was my first time making pot stickers, and they turned out great! I did double it all because i had bought a whole head of cabbage, and a pound of meat and i didn't want it to go to waste.

I didn't really change much. I did only wait about 4 hours before i started to make them cause i was hungry!! Also i accidentally added 1 tsp sugar. and lastly i only used 3/4 cup water after i fried them in the oil. I made (10 at a time) other then that i did it just the same :)

I freezed what we didn't cook up for dinner. If you have space in your freezer i suggest you lay them out on a cookie sheet or in a large tupperware not touching each other and stick in the freezer for like a 1/2 - 1 hour that way you can bag them up and they don't freeze/stick together.

Very good, but I would change the green cabbage to chopped bok choy (or a Chinese cabbage) and allow to drain off.  There is a lot of water in cabbage.  Secondly, I recommend steaming the dumplings first, then pan fry them.  This way there is no concern with liquids in hot oil.

Amazing. We cut the amount of salt in half. We used chix stock instead of water. Followed suggestions for less liquid and steaming too. These are better than most I've had in restaurants. Hubby's had the real deal in China. These are on par.

I use napa cabbage, salted and drained.
The sticking is an easy fix.  Film a warm pan with a little oil, add stickers and fry for a minute  or two, then add water, cover and steam for another two or three minutes, remove cover and cook until water is gone and dumplings are browned.  I like to turn them on another side and brown lightly.  
With all this trouble, double or triple the recipe and freeze on a baking sheet, then freeze in bags.

Hands down delicious. I used napa cabbage instead of the regular cabbage and added a handful of shredded cabbage that was kicking around my crisper. I didn't cook the pork ahead of time, but rather, added four minutes to the steaming time. They were cooked perfectly. Great recipe!

this was all going well until the directions said "add the water to the oil". The oil splattered everywhere. I pulled the pan off the burner and the oil splatter started a fire on the hot burner!  Is there something left out here! Saved the kitchen!

My favourite recipe for potstickers is very similar to this one.  I add finely chopped raw shrimp, peeled and deveined to raw chicken or pork and othr ingredients and chill mixture as per the recipe.  For those who like a hotter sauce for dipping try combining  2 T. each soya sauce, lemon juice and water, 1 T. hoisin sauce, 2 t. sesame oil, 1 t. grated fresh ginger root, 1/2 t. hot Asian chili paste and 2 T. each finely chopped green onions and fresh cilantro. Vary heat by decreasing or increasing the hot chili paste.

very good. I had a problem with the filling staying together, maybe it should be put in raw? I also threw in a little five spice powder.  For the sauce try mixing sweet chile sauce, soy sauce and sesame oil to taste.

If this were just for flavour, then I would give this 5 stars, but when it came to cooking, I made some alterations. (btw, the smell when this was marinating was AMAZING!) I didn't cook the pork beforehand, so that had something to do with it, but when I followed the instructions the pork didn't get cooked. What I ended up doing was: heat 3 Tbs. of oil in a deep skillet, add pot stickers (I did it in three batches), add 3/4 cup water and cover. After about 8 minutes take off cover and lett water evaporate until the bottom begins to brown, take out of pan and keep warm. For the next batches I added one Tbs. before putting in pot stickers. I also made the wrappers (according to one of the comments) with 2 cups flour, and 3/4 cup water plus 2 Tbs. then you let it sit for 30 min. and roll out to about 1/8 in. then cut with a three in. round cookie/biscuit cutter. I found this dough to be WAY to sticky, so I probably added another cup or more, but we had the equivalent of one wrapper left, so it came out well. I also used 1/2 a bag of shredded green cabbage, 10 slices of water chestnuts, and 1/2 tsp. chopped ginger (from a gar, I don't have any fresh). The taste was amazing! I was afraid it was going to be too much cabbage, but I could barely taste it. The sauce, however was WAY WAY too spicy. In the future I think I'll stick with soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and a bit of ginger. I will DEFINATLY be making these again.

I really liked this recipe but made the following changes: I used raw ground turkey; I obmitted the cabbage and added a minced stalk of celery and 1/4 cup minced water chestnuts. I browned the potstickers in butter with a little bit of sesame seed oil added. Delicious! Absolutely delicious!

Before you start, understand that this is a fairly labor intensive recipe, and unless you are a magician, be prepared for a big mess in the kitchen!  Admittedly, this is my first attempt at making pot stickers, and many reviews mentioned concern over the cooking method of adding water to hot oil.  I, too, was concerned, and justifiably so.  I had oil splattered everywhere once the water hit the pot (I did these in batches in a dutch oven)...that's the mess I'm talking about.  Followed the recipe to the letter, except I didn't make the sauce, and after the first batch, I cut back on the oil (added no oil after they'd steamed).  I used the Plum Sauce recipe from this site which was terrific.  The one negative thing that I have to say is that they really were pretty oily, and I don't ever remember that from having them in a restaurant, fried or steamed.  On the positive side, they were very tasty, but I'm not sure I have the patience for the clean-up again.   If I decide to give this another try, it'll be a while!

These are very good! I agree though that meat does not have to be precooked, 8 minutes is ample time to steam a Tbsp pf pork.

I just made these for christmas for my Chinese family, and boy was I scared. My first time making pot stickers and my aunt who had to go back to China is an amazing cook. How am I supposed to match hers? This really was amazing. honestly they were the first things gone at the table. My cousin ate 12 of them before I told her to stop to save some for my husband.   I used ground ginger instead of the slices, didn't do the water chestnuts and I didn't do the sauce and I used most of the 1/2 of a medium head. I also added some shrimp. I think next time I will add a bit more green onion, but otherwise my family was VERY impressed and I will definitely do this again!

Gotta tellya, not the greatest considering the effort level. I think the key issue is the 'pre-cooking' of the pork. Traditional pot-stickers have a raw meat filling that holds together nicely when cooked in the pan. The filling here felt loose and crumbly, even when packed in tight. I'd be interested in trying this again without pre-cooked pork to see how it works out since the flavors are all there. It's just that as written, the consistency is all wrong.

Very good pot stickers!  I did not cook the meat ahead of time, just placed it right into the wrappers, browned them and then steamed.

The recipe was great except the filling wouldn't stick together well.  Would recommend adding something like egg to help keep the filling together.

Really yummy, but too much cabbage (half a head is a LOT), and  I wouldn't attempt this without a food processor. Finely chopping cabbage by hand is no fun! I simply sprayed a pan with PAM, cooked for 4 minutes, then added the water and let them simmer. Also, I really don't like the sauce. I'm used to a sweeter sauce. Next time I'll try Leanne's.

Okay, I'm giving it five stars, but my first attempt was a stick-to-the-pot disaster. I fried, then steamed, then put in a new pan to finish frying and they turned out absolutely awesome.  They're not difficult to make, just a bit putsy.  I think total prep time for me was about 20-30 minutes, which isn't bad if you have the time.  Inexpensive and impressive.  I put some garlic and a dash of soy sauce in the pork, and used a bit less cabbage as it's all I had left, and it was still perfect.

Very good taste, but I changed some of the cooking instructions.  I did not precook the pork.  I did not cook the pot stickers in oil, and found it unnecessary.  You want pot stickers to stick to the pot.  And you only need to boil or fry them for about 4 minutes.  Also, this was way too much chili oil.  My tounge went numb.  Besides the cooking changes, the taste of the dumplings was very good.

These turned out tasting just like the homemade ones I get in my favorite asian restaurant. I was especially suprised by the texture - both steamed and fried, and perfect! Follow those cooking instructions to a tee. This recipe might also be modified for shumai, gyoza, and mandu, as I don't see anything else close on the site right now. It is a LOT of work to get dozens of wrappers filled with  a tiny amount of filling, so get some extra hands on the project if you can, or a chair and a radio if you can't. I didn't let the mixture set overnight, and I used spiced shrimp meat instead of pork - it still came out amazing. I had so many pieces that I had to make two rounds in the skillet.

Excellent appetizer. I veered from the recipe pretty far though. Added carrots and left out Water chestnuts. Also, I used Italian sausage. Was very time consuming pinching the Gyoza skins together. Skipped the process of adding water to the pan, I just fried them and they were crispy and yummy.

I used ground turkey, salt & pepper, & chopped red onions since that was all I had.   Fry for 4-5 minutes until the bottom side is brown, added 1 cup of water & covered for 10 minutes. I mixed ponzu & siracha for the dipping sauce. You do not need to precook the meat.   Thanks for a great recipe!

I had never seen a recipe for pot stickers that called for the pork to be precooked, but decided to try it. The filling would not stay together. It was hard to fill the wonton wrappers. This lead to very little filling in each dumpling, which left them bland & unimpressive.  I will return to using raw pork to make meatballs that fill the dumplings nicely.  However, after cooking the left over filling, it was tasty served over rice with a little soy sauce.

these are so unbelievably like the store bought kind.. they're wonderful.. i used ground turkey instead of pork and used 1/2 t of ground ginger in place of fresh.. halved the salt.. omitted the sugar.. used a half cup of shredded cabbage and added about 1/4 cup of shredded carrots.. lightly oiled the pan and fried until they began to brown then threw them into the steamer for 15 mins to ensure everything was thoroughly cooked.. used chicken broth for the water component.. this yielded 25 pot stickers.. me and bf absolutely loved these.. ty so much for the recipe =)

I used a lid to my pan to shield myself from popping oil - and add the water quickly then replace the lid.  This is what "un-sticks" the dumplings from the pan and then they cook up nicely.

My husband asked why we didn't make them more often! Made them twice this week. Used ground chicken.Put Raw mixture in an egg roll/spring roll wrapper. Used a pizza slice to cut the wrappers into fourths. 1T per quarter, sealed with water. The edges of the triangles were long, so I folded in the outside corners to make them more ravioli-sized, then pressed with fork. No worries on the oil/water mixture. I thought I doubled the recipe the first time and yielded 41 (with some inexperience, hadn't figured out the fourths at first.) The second time, did regular proportions and had 36. Only one package of wrappers used for both times.

I made this for Chinese New Year and they were delicious. Had a hard time cooking them though. Since I used raw pork I decided to boil for 5 minutes and then fry them. Boiling worked good except they became very fragile. Frying them in a skillet was a disaster. They completely stuck to the pan and I could not get them off, thus ruining them. So with the rest of them I fried them on my non stick skillet and that seemed to work great.

These are very good.  I have a lushious variation that I use though.  I mix lean ground pork and finely chopped raw shrimp for the meat.  I don't cook the pork and shrimp before mixing with other ingredients.  I also use nappa cabbage instead of regular cabbage.

Excellent recipe!  I've used other pot sticker recipes before and they never turned out with the flavor that I liked but this recipe is very flavorful and delicious.  I found that if I seal the pot sticker with egg, the edges will stick better.  Also, I will cover the pan immediately after pouring the water into the frying pan because the oil will not mix well with the water and it will splatter all over the place.

This recipe is really worth the effort!  My only change was to add a dash of oyster sauce, and fresh minced garlic.  They freeze nice as well.

They were ok for us.  I thought the texture of the pot sticker wrappers was too thick/chewy.  The filling was decent, though I added a clove of chopped garlic, red pepper flakes and finely chopped carrot.  This recipe was really time consuming to make.  I have some filling left over, but dred having to assemble them again.  We didn't care for the sauce at all.  I might go with the frozen next time and put my efforts towards another part of the meal.  I was really bummed these weren't as great as the reviews seemed.  I don't doubt the wrappers or my cooking them had something to do with their lack of texture/taste.  The directions for the steaming part didn't seem right and I relied on the other reviews for guidance.

I had a really hard time making these as actual potstickers. I didn't have the proper pan for it, and they just didn't turn out great. I took all the filling, cooked it up, and we served it over rice. That was actually really tasty! We eat it all the time, and call it potsticker hash :) I usually use a full lb. of ground pork.

My family and I loved these!  I did make a few changes, however: used Napa cabbage instead of regular, added garlic and more water chestnuts to the filling, and used ground chicken (out of pork).  Also, I cooked these in a thin layer of oil about 1 minute to brown the bottom, then steamed in a covered pan with a thin layer of water about 2 more minutes.  Yum!!

update:  GUZ66's tips really made filling the wrappers very easy.  I found round wrappers in the frozen section of the Asian grocery.  Much easier to work with.  After putting a scant TBS of filling on the wrapper, I wet my index fingers with water and run them around the edges of the wrapper and then fold it over and press the edges together with a fork. previous review: We love pot stickers and this is my first time to make them.  I usually buy them frozen. Great recipe.  Husband said best pot stickers he has ever had.  I used ground beef and I used about 1 1/2 cup or so of chopped cabbage/carrots from a bag of coleslaw mix.  I used a bottled dipping sauce and added about 2 tbls. of that to meat mixture.  I liked cooking the meat first as it took so little time to cook the dumplings that way.  I put two fry pans on the stove - one with oil and one with water.  I fried the bottom of the dumplings for about 1 minute and then put them in the pan with just a little water for 1 to 2 minutes (covered) or until the top of the dumpling was translucent.  Came out great.  I also added a little minced red bell pepper to the meat just because I needed to use it while still fresh.

Dh and I really enjoyed these.  I did do some of the modifying that others suggested... I did not cook the pork first. I added some carrot along with everything else.. I chopped it all up in the food processor... I also doubled the recipe but not the salt.. was still plenty of salt.. especially if your using a dipping sauce with  soy sauce in it...Instead of all the oil I halved the oil and browned it slightly then added the water... and cooked until the water evaporated.  Next time I will use a very good non stick pan and very little oil to cut down on the greasiness.. these are keepers in our book.. thanks for posting this recipe

I used this recipe in egg rolls instead of traditional pot stickers, and they turned out very tasty.

I cheated a bit on the recipe, by putting the chili oil into the mix, and not making the dipping sauce. My fiancee called them the world's greatest egg rolls.

Thank you Marcia.

The filling was good, but there was too much cabbage. I used far less. The filling was also too crumbly. Next time I will figure out how to make the recipe work without precooking the filling. Overall, though, very tasty.

The taste was delicious but the next time that I make it, I will leave the pork raw so that it acts as a binder for the ingredients and most of my stuffing goes into my mouth in stead of floating in my dipping sauce. One of the reviews made a comment about the oil and water not being a good mix so here's a tip for that: put the oil in the pan with water. Let that heat up then put in the pot stickers allow the water to evaporate leaving the oil to fry the pot stickers.

The only things I change are that I use the traditional dumpling wrapper, the round ones.  They do taste completely different to me than the egg roll wrappers and fry up in a different texture.  I also don't add cabbage as that makes it more of an egg roll.  When you put them in the oil, once they brown, flip them then add the water and cook till the water is gone with a lid on so they steam.  Don't add the water too soon...only once they have browned on the bottom.

These were good to ME but my dear boyfriend thought they tasted a bit medicinal? It might have been my own fault though. I couldn't find actual ginger in my grocery store but I did find a TUBE of ginger...but it didn't have "slice" increments on it of course so I put a tablespoon of it in but I think it might have need just a teaspoon of half a tablespoon.

Awesome!  I thought these would be bland, but yum!  I made 100 that night for 3adults and2children...all but 8 were let over.  I couldn't make the fork trick work so I just wet one side with my finger after dipping it in a glass of water and sealed.

These were awesome, even reheated the next day. My kids went nuts for them, and we  turned making them into a kind of assembly line, which definitely sped the prep time up. I made a lot of substitutions, and surprisingly they still turned out really well. Heres what I did. I used buffalo chicken, baked and then cut into pieces.  I didn't have any cabbage, so I chopped up celery instead. I didn't have any ginger, and shredded some carrots instead. I added a handful of minced garlic and some paprika for extra kick. For sauce, I only had some ginger hoisin left over from stir fry. After mixing the ingredients I added enough to make it just saturated (The pot stickers had enough flavor from this that dipping sauce wasn't necessary either). Lastly, for cooking, I tried olive oil. I attempted to boil them after and they just fell apart. After ruining several batches I tried frying them one side for 1 minute, flipping them and cooking them for 30 seconds. Absolute perfection, crispy on one side, and lightly crisp on the other, yet still transparent. * I didn't follow the directions either about chilling the mixed ingredients for hours either, everything was warm except for the wraps, trying this with cold ingredients may not turn out as well. Overall this was tasty and well worth the effort.

Somewhat tedious but good. Did not read the ingredient list correctly and bought pork sausage by mistake. Still good but a little salty. I think the point behind cooking the pork and cabbage before adding to the wrapper is to remove the excess water, cabbage has a LOT of water which may make the dumplings soggy and harder to handle. I shredded a small head of cabbage, added 2 tsp salt to draw water out, stirred & let it sit 20 minutes, strained a LOT of water out using a cheesecloth. Did go ahead & precook the pork so I could test the filling and adjust seasonings to my preference. Used a cornstarch slurry to wet the wanton edges before sealing, made around 45 w/none falling apart. I steamed first then fried to avoid the grease spatter. Put in oven to keep warm and unintentionally 'baked' some of them, very crunchy! Won't do that part again or will cover the dish instead, didn't like the crunch factor. Good recipe, will make again sometime.

I think these were just okay and I would not make them again. They did not stay together well when I was cooking them. The flavors were good but the process was a little too much hassle for me with a messy result.

I substituted ground pork with ground beef since that is what I had in the fridge. I left out the sesame oil and chestnuts. All this resulted to very yummy potstickers however, I'm giving this 4 stars because I don't understand what you mean by 1/2 a medium head cabbage, I thought the ratio of meat and cabbage was too large of a difference so I took out MOST OF THE CABBAGE OUT lol. Thanks for the recipe, will make again =)

Unmitigated disaster! Used wonton wrappers and they ALL came apart in the pot. Yes I squeezed the air out and the edges were sealed-still fell apart. The three stars is for the wonton mash I had for dinner that did taste wonderful.

I have not tried this recipe but it is very much like the one I make (which is excellent). The main difference is the dipping sauce I make. I use equal parts of rice vinegar, soy sauce and sugar. Add small amount of water and some chili flakes (depends on how spicy you like it). Bring to a boil then simmer, it will get a little thick. YUM!!!!

Got lots of compliments on these.  I doubled the recipe and got 60.  Used Napa Cabbage.  1 can sliced water chestnuts chopped. Cooked in oil on both sides.  Removed from pan, drained on a papertowel, left for a while, came back and cooked in chicken stock instead of water to reheat...following directions by heating pan with remaining oil then adding stickers, then stock.  For dipping sauce I used: 1/3c . soy sauce diluted with 2 Tbs. water, 2 Tbs. Sambal, 1/3c. rice wine vinegar, 1 tsp. sesame oil, 1/3c. sliced green onions

I just want to add that if you want a nicely brown and chewy dough, you should buy the actual pot sticker wrapper because the wonton one is too thin.

This was time consuming, and I couldn't get my wrappers to do what I wanted them to so I folded them into mini burritos!  Very yummy :)  The inside was so good I decided to try one before I cooked it...I don't recommend that!

These do take some time and work, but are really good to eat. To avoid getting burned when adding the water to the hot pan with oil, my mother only adds a few sprinkles of water with her fingers, just enough to create a little steam and cover. You don't need all the water, plus your pot stickers won't get soggy. The water is meant to create a little steam to soften and cook fast.

I have to admit, I thought the filling was going to be bland but it really wasn't at all!  I used chicken and powdered onion and ginger in the filling. Used wonton wrappers adn water around the egdes to seal.  Crimped them with a fork just to be safe but had no problems with any opening. I used others suggestions and lightly browned them before adding water to the pan and steaming.  Delicious!  And the dipping sauce is really good.  I didn't have chili oil so I used 1/2t srirachi chili sauce instead and it worked great!

I was a little afraid to try these because I knew they were going to be labor intensive.  They were, but on the other hand the recipe makes a lot.  (I made some for dinner and froze the rest).  I was delighted at how well they turned out and am looking forward to eating the ones I froze.  I wasn't crazy about the dipping sauce and preferred some plum sauce.  Overall, these are winners.

These are not the most traditional pot stickers, in fact they resemble the Japanese version, Gyoza, more. Traditional pot stickers use raw pork mixture, almost like a meatball with hand rolled dough, nonetheless, these made pretty good Gyoza.  As for step 4, it really is based on ones taste and equipment, I usually coat the bottom of the pan with a thin layer of oil(adding too much will make the oil pop out a ton), arrange the pot stickers closely and pan fry the bottom for a couple of minutes, then add water, but only enough to steam (I usually add 1/3 cup for my sized pan).  I don't want to make the potstickers to become soggy.  Put the lid on to steam cook and wait 3-4 minutes or until water fully evaporated for cooked pork filling.  With raw pork, I tend to let it stay on longer with more water.  I also added about a half cup of chinese chives and totally cut out the chestnuts because of personally taste.

Very very good. Normally I do not use cabbage in the dumplings, but was pleasantly suprised. Everyone loved them. I browned the bottoms on the griddle and then transferred them to a steam basket.

The key to these things is sealing the wrappers.  I used inspiration from this recipe and the Gyoza recipe also found on this site.  Used cabbage, ground chicken, shittake mushrooms, green onions, water chestnuts, grated carrot for filling.  Hit the mixture with a lot of ginger and garlic powder as well as a tsp or so of sesame oil.  Fried batches in canola oil and sesame oil and I couldn't *really* tell the difference.  Steaming with chicken broth is brilliant, though.  Love Leanne's sauce for these.  EDIT: Second time through, used actual minced garlic (3 cloves) and ginger (about an inch minced).  Used same veggies for filling, also doused with soya sauce and sesame oil (there abouts of a heaping teaspoon).  Instead of ground meat, used shredded tofu.  Never used the sugar.  Still a hit.  The only reason I rate it a bit low is because I augmented the filling a great deal.  Still adoring Leanne's sauce.

My son used this recipe to make an ethnic dish for a school project.  We enjoyed them so much we started making them for dinner on a regular basis.  We did have trouble with them sticking and tearing so we decided to try them in the deep fryer and loved them even more.  We double wrap them when we deep fry and they look just like the fried wontons you get in the chinese restaurants.  Makes an impressive appetizer for company.

This recipe was so much fun to play with.  Although I used chopped raw shrimp instead of the pork, I mostly followed the recipe.  I was interested in learning the method for pot stickers and this was perfect.  Like other reviewers, I didn't add extra oil.  I took them to a party and they stayed perfect in my electric skillet.  Everyone liked them, but no one asked for the recipe (not everyone enjoys putting so much time into a dish!).

I tried this recipe. They come out better if you do not precook the meat. I used ground pork and chicken. Also, used radicco instead of cabbage. This gives more color once bitten into. I also added a tsp of sugar to a sauce of Sesame Oil, Soy and rice wine. My step son ate 2 dozen with out stopping for air. lol

these were great!  I used ground turkey instead of pork, and i didn't cook the meat ahead of time. I also used carrots instead of water chestnuts. It made a ton of food. I used the following for a dipping sauce: 6T sweet chili sauce, 2T sriracha, 1t soy sauce, 1t sugar with minced scallions and cilantro. yum!

Okay, alot of work.  I used the leftover wontons in chicken broth with carrots and mushrooms for a wonton soup and preferred them this way.

This recipe was great! My husband and kids are not big fans of soy, but they absolutely loved this recipe! I substituted the pork with ground soy "meat" and the water chestnut with a clove of garlic. The size of the wonton wrapper will determine how much of the filling you can use inside each potsticker.

The pork filling was delicious.  I tried making the wonton wrappers from scratch and it turned out to be an incredibly difficult task.  I highly recomend using the premade wrappers.

YUM, YUM, YUM! I can’t believe how amazing these are! Yes you have to be careful when adding water to the pan, but if you add it slowly you’re fine. These are so good they will are now a staple on my menu. The only thing I didn’t like was the sauce. Too much heat for me. I prefer the sweet chili sauce.

Made these last weekend and they were fantastic!  I used wonton wrappers since there wasn't an Oriental Grocery close by and they worked just fine.  I browned the pork but didn't let the mix set overnight - just used extra seasoning (meat marinade from Beef Lo Mein).  I screwed up the first batch since I put the lid on after I added the water - they turned out rather soggy but still delicious!  Judge your water on amount of pan and number of pot stickers - we ended up decreasing to about 1/3 cup.  Used a different sauce:  2 Tbsp. soy sauce; 2 Tbsp. rice wine (I used rice vinegar); 1 tsp. sesame oil; 1 Tbsp. scallion (green onion).  Made a double batch of sauce and added some spicy chili paste to one.  Very easy and a great appetizer for a wok meal!  Thanks!

Made as directed once, as suggested using other meat (chicken) once, both versions are good.  The only thing I don't like is the sauce but that's personal taste, my wife likes it.  I made 70 and froze about 50.  Steamed and fried these with good results.  Not sure how the frozen ones will turn out as I didn't freeze immediately and the wrapper softened.
**Upadate:  They fry up nicely even when frozen.  Used low heat setting with lid on skillet until browned on one side, brown second side without lid.

This review is for the filling only. I didn't change a thing and it was perfect.  I overcooked the wontons so next time I'll be a little more careful not to fry them for so long. I only gave four stars because the directions for cooking them were confusing.  I did use the two pan method recommended by another reviewer.  I used a different dipping save from this website.  I will definitely make these again.  Awesome

These turned out alright. We had some issues with them falling apart and sticking to each other in the pan though. Also, i think if we had fried the whole thing, not just the bottom, they would have turned out better. But they tasted great, and we followed the recipe the whole way.

you can cook these in the manner as stated in the directions... i did use chicken stock for steaming vice water... and also some of the different veggies as suggested by others... the biggest comment i want to say is if doing these in batches CLEAN THE POT in between or the pot stickers will most definitly stick... and not in a good way. also used my own spicy sauce using 2 serranos (stemmed seeded and minced), 3Tbl soy sauce (reduced sodium of course), 3Tbl lemon juice, 3Tbl minced onion... mixing all together... nice spice and salty with that hit of lemon great sauce!!! i also usually double to triple the sauce for size of food!

I am an intermediate cook. I have cooked Asian food before. This recipe was fun to try. Excellent flavors. Easiest to cook with an extra person. Plan ahead that it takes a good chunk of time to cook the full recipe.

these were really yummy!  I used ground chicken instead of ground pork and the sauce, I thought, was way too spicy.  I definitely need to practice folding the wraps b/c mine looked nothing like the picture but they still tasted great!

Flavor and texture are great, use less oil for frying and cover them for a few minutes after adding the water - boiling will take closer to 10-15 mins. However, it makes far more than 16 pot stickers and buy frozen wonton wrappers - these are a pain to make!

Very good.   I read many recipes where people said to pan saute in some sort of oil/butter, then add water and steam--covered.  I will try that next time, but only because I am too impatient. Also, these refrigerate well after the boiling stage.  Much quicker to saute then...

The filling turned out great, but the cooking technique, along with very thin wrappers, left me with a pile of potstickers that looked horrible, but tasted pretty good. Mixing the filling ahead of time is really important, because it helps the cabbage wilt and combine with the rest. I also added extra toasted sesame oil. Serve with Oriental Dipping Sauce from this site. As for the cooking technique, I don't know how to make it work...I would suggest thicker wrappers.

These turned out great!  A little learning curve for me trying to get them to steam the right way, but it all turned out the way I thought they would.  I didnt have any cabbage, so I used chopped shredded carrots instead, it was great.  I didnt pre-cook the pork, it was done with the steaming.  This recipe makes tons of these, so I refridgerated the meat mix, and made these fried a few nights later! oh and the dipping sauce .... GREAT !  a keeper !

Very tasty! I agree with "bigsis144" lots of work involved and a once in a while fab treat! Great Sunday or Monday night football food! I am going to try steaming next time, because I do enjoy the healthier meal.

wow.wow.wow. I cannot say enough good things about this recipe (with reviewers suggestions).  I've never tackled pot stickers/gyoza before, but I felt compelled to try.  First, I did not cook the ground chicken mixture beforehand. Second, some ingredient changes I made were: 1/2 head finely chopped napa cabbage, ~1 tsp grated ginger (using my microplane), a couple pressed garlic cloves, 1/2 can of finely chopped water chestnuts. After forming the dumplings I decided to place them in the fridge to hold until I was ready to cook, but I shouldn't have because the dough turned soggy. Not sure how to avoid this in the future if I plan to hold for a while.  Taking other sugggestions I placed them in a pan with a bit of oil to brown each side. Then added 1/2 C chicken broth and steamed for a few mintues.  Served over rice with General Tsao's sauce (from Trader Joe's).  Husband said they're definitely a keeper. I agree :)

I used to buy (at a very affordable price) bags of frozen pot stickers from Trader Joe's. I've had trouble finding them over the past couple years, and the ones I find in other stores are all at ridiculous prices. I'm so glad to have this recipe. Not only does it taste perfect, but I can control what I put in them and make them healthier if I so choose. We gorged ourselves on them the first night we made them. These will be perfect appetizers to premake and freeze for future parties. I can't wait to show them off.

I did not like how this turned out at all. I followed the recipe, but over all the flavor just wasn't there for me. I've had much better frozen ones (and for the amount of time and the cost it took to make these, I would rather spend my money on the frozen). I think it was the wonton wrappers that did it for me. I found the texture to be very different to what I'm use to. After trying this recipe, I was turned off to pot stickers for a few months.

This is a "keeper" recipe!  When I enclosed the filling, I pleated the edges for a truly authentic presentation.  They were delicious and my husband and I ate the entire recipe in one sitting.  Oink.  I then made more and froze them so that we can have them at a (nearly) moments notice.  I didn't change any of the ingredients or cooking procedures and was thoroughly pleased with the results.  I also served these with hoisin sauce, a wasabi/soy mixture, and plum sauce for variety.

The filling was yummy even if kind of hard to work with being that it was crumbled. The sauce left alot to be desired and we searched for different dipping sauce recipes. It needed sugar.

I made this as an appetizer to Sesame Chicken Pasta also on this site. I made changes to make this into a 30 minute meal. I did not cook the pork and instead added the ingredients to season the pork. I used green onions, cilantro, ginger, sesame oil, pepper, sugar, soy sauce and a bit of sugar. I doubled the wontons-making them single did NOT work! If it stuck to the pan the filling would fall out so DEFINITELY DOUBLE THE WONTONS! I steamed them using chicken broth  also as another reviewer had and it really brought a great dimension to the flavor.  It took about 5-7 minutes per batch. This was my first time cooking an Asian meal besides Stir Fry and it couldn't have been simpler and it tasted just as good as take out! My hubby ate about 10! This one will be on rotation at my house!  Thanks!

This was the first time I have made pot stickers and they turned out great!  I too changed the recipe a bit, I used less cabbage, added carrots and garlic, and used Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce in the mixture.  I also added a beaten egg to it before I put it into the wrappers.  And they didn't stick a bit!  With some of the extra filling I made some wontons added them to chicken broth with some scallions and made a nice soup!  Will definitely make them again!

OMG! I love these. My husband loved them. My KIDS loved these. So good. I did have to adapt to my small wrappers by moistening the edges of 4 wonton wrappers and sealing them together by overlapping the edges and then rolled the meat up in them and folded in the edges then rolled. Alot less to fry for me. I will be making these again very soon. I tried some other sauce recipe with this and it rocked too.

I didn't have ground pork so I used a boneless pork loin chop, cooked it up, chopped and threw it in the cuisinart for a few pulses. Flavor of the pot stickers was really good. Mine did stick to the pan a bit but I should have read the reviews closely before I made them, it would have fixed that issue. I'll try again for sure.

the only changes I made was to double the recipe and I did not cook the pork first.  I love these pockets of flavour!!  I had no problem with sticking to the pan but what I did after frying them to golden on each side was put a couple tbsp of water in the pan and covered them to steam them a bit.  thanks for the great recipe!!

I have to say that tastewise this was a 5 star recipe for me but mine ended up being a pot of mush cause they all stuck to the bottom of the pot!  I tried to stir them as soon as I put them in with the oil but to no avail.  They were super tasty though...I didn't make the sauce but used a thai sesame one that I had on hand already.  Anyway I will definatley make again but need to figure out how to do it so they don't stick.

I changed this a bit, but used the basic method and it worked well for me.  I used my own filling, fried the "packets" in some sesame oil (on several of their sides), and steamed them in a little chicken broth (per other reviewers) for ~5 minutes and they turned out great.  Thanks!

I am not a fan of pork, but I made it with the pork anyways with the reviews being so high, and these are delish!!!!! everyone thought they were take out, all though the takeout are not crumbly in the center.. I will try the ground chicken next time, and I will stuff them with raw meat, and steam them longer.... great recipe!!

Very good. I made them with chicken, not pork being as I do not like pork, and they turned out surprisingly edible which is sometimes not the case when you modify main ingredients.

Very good recipe!  I used left over pork roast, and no cabbage--very good!  Using the left over pork cut down some of the prep time and made good use of my left overs.  I have made these numerous times and each time have never had make it into the fridge-they go pretty fast!

Great recipe!  Good ingredients. Once the dumplings were made, which is relaxing once you get the hang of it, I steamed them first.  Instead of frying them, I mixed a little sesame oil, EVOO and soy sauce.  Then laid them out on a foil lined baking sheet.  Make sure you use cooking spray, in case they stick.  I lightly brush one side with the oil mixture.  Set my toaster even to 425 and toasted them on just one side.  Watch them, as each oven is different.  Mine is convection so it took about 4 minutes. I don’t usually eat fried food so this gave them color and a little crunch.  Little veggie steamed “fried” rice. Yummy!

These were delicious!  Made exactly as written.  My only recommendation would be to use a non stick pan.  I used a stainless steel pan and they stuck badly!  Switched to a non stick and they came out beautifully!  Really tasty.  Definitely making again!

I whirled 1.3 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken thighs in the food processor and mixed with the half head of cabbage and 4 green onions, ginger, soy sauce and sesame oil.  Made enough filling to fill 60 round wrappers.  Plus, I had enough leftover to make 10 small meatballs.

I made this twice. Both times I used my own hand made wrappers, which are delicious in other recipes and they worked fine for this as well. The first time I made this as written. Absolutely some of the most bland, cafeteria food ever. I don't like pot stickers or dumplings in restaurants and I was hoping making my own would change my mind. It  didn't. But, I tried again. So, 2nd time I made my own meat mince (I used chicken thigh I minced myself in the processor instead of pork mince) and seasoned it with a bit of soy, a dash of sesame oil and added other spices, more ginger, minced onion, garlic paste, minced carrot and left out the tasteless water chestnut and used a smaller cabbage. Then I played with the sauce. I used low sodium soy,  cayenne powder, jalapeno pepper juice,  rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, chicken stock, and chili flakes mixed it all together except the lemon juice. Reduced it over med. heat and toned down the salt with lemon. (the dipping sauce was yum - but still a touch too salty by itself). Turns out that was a good thing because the Pot stickers or wontons or whatever you wish to call them were still bland -- though better than the first time.  I cooked off some of the filling before I filled them and it was great -- the flavor just gets lost when they are boiled and boiled dough is never going to be my thing. I use a similar mix in one of my egg roll fillings with the same dough recipe. It is wonderful and much easier to cook. Three minutes in hot oi

Wonderful !!  Really got the swing of the tempo about the 3rd batch in the pan and these are addictive.   Did not have a problem with the water going into the oil  (from a different review) as most of the oil is used by then and then added the water slowly and carefully.  The very few that were left over disappeared from the fridge the next morning.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good, but a cooking trick I learned from a chef is to put the oil into your pan and then put in the potstickers.  Once they are all in the pan, add your water.  The water will evaporate and you will be left with the oil in the pan at the end to brown them. Much, much easier.

These were awesome but very time consuming to make. The wonton wraps that I bought tore very easily so I had make them very slowly but the effort was well worth and everyone loves them.

Good flavor!  A professional tip I just learned after making gyoza (Japanese potstickers) many times and NOT having great success with the steaming/frying process in the past.  We went to a gyoza restaurant in Paris this summer and while the dumplings were very tasty, the best part was that I had a chance to see a professional Japanese chef cook these!  He had trays of these lined up and picked them up about six at a time with a long spatula and transferred them to a rectangular cast iron skillet, keeping them in a neat row.  To steam, he covered the skillet with a rectangular metal pan turned upside down, then removed it (carefully!) to allow the bottoms to crisp up.  Transferred to the plate with the same long spatula, it's easy and quick to move these in and out of the pan.  Genius idea!!!   He kept the oil and water in separate squeeze bottles - another super idea.

There's absolutely no reason to give these less than 5 stars.  This is not a dangerous recipe.  It's very common and quite easy once you get the hang of it.  The reason why they're potstickers involves the frying/steaming method.  Once they fry up on the bottoms, you add the water, cover and let them steam til they're cooked.  The water should be absorbed and then the dumplings will stick to your pan...you want to let them fry like that for another minute or two to get that nice crispiness.  These can also be steamed in a bamboo steamer to make steamed dumplings just as easily.  Also, you do not have to cook the pork ahead of time.

We followed the directions, but they came out like mush.  So we skipped the water step and ate them......not very good taste.  Not to mention, if we did mess up big time, they are still SOOOOO small that it would not be worth it.  Too much work.  Very disappointed.

These are DELICIOUS. The good part about cooking the pork before is that you can remove so much fat that way. These were so moist and delicious. Easy to make and freeze too.

I made this recipe and it tasted just like the restaurant's. If you can buy round dumpling wrappers from an Asian market, it makes it so much easier. I also found a dumpling press on sale at Wal-mart (of all places), so I can make these little dumplings pretty quickly. You can freeze the dumplings after making them, although it does slightly alter the flavor.

Excellent recipe and have made several times in the last few months, have since quadrupled the recipe to fit my families needs. A few things that have been useful to me is to leave the pork raw as you fill the wrappers , easier to handle and after cooked taste and texture are better. instead of using plain sesame oil for the recipe I added the chili oil instead. Also used egg wash to seal the edges of the wrappers to seal them better.Everything else is the same as the recipe.

I am giving this four stars because I liked the taste and flavor of the filling.  As a true beginner in every sense of a pot sticker first time not only making, but also eating it was pleasing to see the plate emptied.  But, my pot stickers did fall apart in the cooking process.  Don't put the Pot Stickers close to each other in the pan, I did thinking they would reduce in size, but they increase like a noodle.  Resulted in kind of a bit of a gooey take apart session.  Served with cream cheese won tons and sweet and sour  sauce.  Oh and I didn't refrigerate the mixture didn't read the recipe far enough in advance, but the flavors were still good.

A little effort with nice results! They turned out super yummy and very similar to the ones we buy frozen at  the store (but better, of course). I used ground turkey instead of pork and did not cook prior to mixing with the cabbage. Cooked in the oil for about 3-4 minutes, then added 1/2 cup water, covered, and steamed for 10 minutes. Came out perfectly. Keep an eye on the heat level, they can burn pretty easily! I took the advice of another reviewer and made her sauce with soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, etc. Will definitely make again!!

These were terrific & so tasty as an appetizer- The dipping sauce was fantastic- I added some red pepper flakes into the mixture for a little more zip. I initially started out by making my own dough, but then switched to the store bought wonton wrappers, which made the process easier- it is a lot of prep work but well worth it for the final product, had enough mixture to freeze a few batches. I omitted using water to steam and used less then 1/4 cup chicken broth to steam for about 10 min. I also just sprayed the pan w/PAM and spraged the stickers w/PAM while browning instead of oil.

We had fun trying these out for Chinese New Year. One tablespoon is way too much filling to try and work with. We used a big teaspoon.  I used round wonton wrappers and got 50 pot stickers. No water chestnuts. Would have like to have more exact measurements on the cabbage and ginger. The cooking technique is a little strange. I just used the same technique I use for the store bought ones. Brown the bottom in oil, add the water and steam until the water is gone.

My guests LOVED these. I made them in batches and couldn't keep up. I didn't have chili oil for the dipping sauce so I added a tiny dash of sesame oil instead and floated a few green onions on top for garnish. Better than the restaurant!

I love this recipe. I used ground turkey instead of pork and I added some cinnamon, ground pepper, and garlic. I also made the dough using the pot sticker dumplings recipe, instead of buying wonton wrappers.

These are awesome.  I was nervouse about making them but they were so easy.  The flavour was wonderful and as long as you don't put too many in the pan to brown they are perfect.  I baked mine after they were browned and frozen.  They were wonderful.

These are the closest to restaurant quality you'll find.  I didn't have fresh ginger but used powdered instead.  I also added a bit of white pepper for heat.  This is my new go to recipe.  By the way these are good fried instead of steamed too.

I did not add water chestnuts and i used home made wonton wrappers made with whole wheat flour.  This made the wontons a bit coarse, they absorbed a lot more water when steaming so... It was a tid bit salty but the flavor was almost there. Next time I will use pastry flour (whole wheat) and add the water chestnuts. I also listened to another review and did not cook the pork in the potstickers, it was better.   All in all it is a great recipe but I do not advise using whole wheat flour because its very coarse.  Will definitely do this recipe again in the future.

This was my first attempt at making pot sticker. I didn't feel like trying my hand at the dough so I bought some won ton wrappers. They turned out fantastic and everyone liked them. I used a little extra ground pork and had some left over stuffing that was absolutely fantastic in an omelet the next morning! I'll make the stuffing again just to the omelet alone!!!

These were great. I used 1/4 head of cabbage, and 2 green onions and used the wonton wrappers. I also used the 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar, and 1 tsp sesame oil for the dipping sauce as per one of the reviews and it tasted awesome!! I also froze them on a cookie sheet and now have a bag in the freezer for whenever I feel like cooking up a few!!

I liked this recipe although I was confused with a couple things.  1. Why precook the pork? Mine cooked thoroughly after steaming for 5 mins maximum.  2.  I the grocery store wonton wraps and don't have any trouble sealing them.  I lay them out, brush the edges with water (about 1/2"), put a scant tbsp of filling in the center.  I fold over the wrapper, press wet edges together, then crimp/pinch to seal and for the look.  Works like a charm - my 7 year old granddaughter kept right up with me!  I think the secret is to not overfill them, and when I add the filling, I spread the filling from a "drop" to more of a cylinder shape.  This way no filling squeezes out.   Thanks for this great recipe - they freeze great, too!

Very delicious, but harder to wrap than you would think. It takes some practice.

Fantastic. My 14-year-old daughter and I made these and froze about half. They were so tasty, we finished the other half within a few days. We didn't make the sauce as we were able to purchase a quart of some excellent dipping sauce at the Chinese restaurant for only $2. We will be making these again this weekend with pak choy from our garden. Cannot wait.

This is definitely an authentic potsticker recipe. I had to google though to find out how I was suppose to fold the dumplings.  Also, make sure the oil in the pan is very hot when searing the bottom side.  Got tons of raves on this recipe and it will be a staple within my home.

Great recipe and much easier to make than I was expecting.  I had leftover boneless pork chops and through them in a food processor with the other ingredients. Then followed the rest of the recipe.

I enjoyed the filling very much but did make some changes to the original recipe. I used a pre-shredded coleslaw mix and added veggie crumbles instead of the pork. I used powdered ginger with cumin. Kept the dipping sauce the same but used homemade dough. I enjoyed this very much!

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I tweaked it a little...used 1 pound of raw ground pork and mixed it with about 1/4-1/2 cup of ground carrots, 1 teaspoon of ground ginger, 1 green onion and the recipe's amount of salt, sesame oil and sugar. I didn't use the water chestnuts or cabbage.  They turned out phenomenal! I followed another reviewer and sauted in oil for about 5 minutes then steamed in chicken broth for about 10-15 minutes.  I used Leanne's recipe for a dipping sauce (sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce and 1 minced green onion) and my boyfriend and I loved it!  I froze what we didn't cook and hope they will be an easy answer to a quick dinner another night.

Excellent pot stickers. Tried as per a reviewer, omitted the cabbage and finely chopped a whole can of sliced water chestnuts instead.
Did not pre-cook the meat as per the original recipe(not necessary).

This is nice but it should be called fast potstickers, or fried wonton. The northern chinese make the skin by hand- that's traditional, but i cannot say for the younger generation, who tend to use the instant wrappers from supermarket.

I have to rate these by taste and not by how difficult they were to make. I will continue to buy these!!!!!! I was so frustrated that I couldn't get my wonton wrappers to stick together and they were really thin! My husband took over since he loves them so much and ended up dipping the whole wonton wrapper in water to get them to stick. WHAT A MESS! They fell apart while cooking and was not worth my time. BUT they tasted really really good especially with the sauce!

I also used the bagged coleslaw mix like other reviewers plus a bit of chili oil to the mix. I made this without any meat and it tasted really good.

These are very good, not quite as good as some I've had in restaurants, but still very good.  I used Leanne's sauce recipe...still not quite right, maybe add a pinch of sugar.  Worth making again and again.

I found this to be pretty good tasting pot stickers.  I thought it needed a bit more salt but then putting it into the potsticker dip it jazzed it right up.  I made double the recipe and there was not a potsticker left!  I did use a teflon pan to make sure there was no sticking to the pan.  Didn't change a thing, thanks for sharing.

Marcia Marcia Marcia!  This recipe is really good!  I had left over filling from an egg roll recipe from this site (used ground turkey) and added red pepper flakes to it.  Like LZJoyce, I was confused about the direction to stir constantly...I followed MS.CHEF's advice and placed them in 2 tbsp. of oil and later added one cup of water, covered and steamed for about 4 or 5 minutes.  Served these with the sauce suggested as well as Sweet and Sour Sauce I (also very good) and we all enjoyed them very much.  Time consuming but well worth it.  Thanks so much Marcia!

I had the same issues as another poster with them sticking so badly to the pot that they had to be served in a bowl as they all fell apart, but the flavor was excellent!  I did notice that the won ton wrappers my store carries seem to be thinner than others I've tried so maybe that's why they didn't stay together?  
I would definitely make this again though, the insides were just like at my favorite restaraunt.

Wow, I made these yesterday...I had to eat some before supper, they looked so good.  I did as the other reviewer did, I did not cook the pork meat first, I just left it raw.  I also substituted Nappa cabbage for the regular cabbage.  I just added a couple more minutes to the cooking time, to adjust for the raw pork.  But, what a great recipe.  I recommend doubling or tripling the recipe so that you can freeze some for next time....Great stuff.
