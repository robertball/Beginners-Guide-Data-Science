I don't think the alcohol is necessary...it gave it just a slightly odd aftertaste. but it's a fabulous recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly (using my Cuisinart Sorbet Maker) and it was delicious.  The flavor is very intense.  I toyed with the idea of reducing the sugar slightly and making another batch, but my husband thinks the recipe is perfect as written.  He thinks the sour cherries would be too tart with less sugar.  Great summer recipe!

Rarely, do I ever see sour cherries in Florida, however, sweet are in abundance in the area right now.  I used sweet cherries, reduced the sugar about 1/4 cup and used my Cuisinart Ice Cream maker to process the fruit mixture.  The finished texture was classic sorbet, it firmed up perfectly.  If I use sweet cherries again, I'll try 1/2 cup of sugar because it was still pretty sweet, but that's just a personal taste preference.  I'm sure sour cherries would have made this even better, but this was still pretty darn good.  Thanks, CJ.

I found that the wine (I used a chardonnay) really was masked by the cherry flavour. I realise the salt plays a part in the sorbet, but I thought it was excessive.  This could easily be a great base for a cherry daiquiri by replacing the white wine.

I have never seen a fresh sour cherry here in TX.  When I ran across this recipe I knew I had 2 cans of sour cherries in the pantry so I experimented with those.  I drained and gently pressed the cherries to remove canned liquid and find any missed pits.  Used 1/2 cup sugar (we like tart), 2/3 cup Knudsen Just Tart Cherry Juice (to replace missing juice from missing fresh cherries), 1/2 t almond extract, and instead of the wine and salt I used probably 1/3 cup vodka (out of white wine).  Mixed in the blender and then chilled and froze in Kitchen Aid ice cream bowl then into the freezer to ripen overnight.  The texture is perfect.  We like to top with chopped Amarena cherries.

Really beautiful and packs a powerful flavor punch. Also a delightful garnish in summer adult beverages, using a melon baller!

We had bags of fresh sour cherries from a neighbor’s tree, and I was glad to finally find a way to use them other than in pie.  I didn’t have all of the exact ingredients so I made a few swaps.  I used sangria instead of white wine and substituted vanilla extract for the almond. I loved the flavor the sangria brought but felt the vanilla was overpowering - I’d skip that next time.
