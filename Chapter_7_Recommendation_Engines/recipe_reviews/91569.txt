Nice and simple dish.  I agree it tastes like OJ over fish, but it was fine.  I had to keep adding olive oil and a little butter, but also used 1.5# of tilapia and doubled the OJ sauce.

Easy to prepare and very tasty... I would recommend doubling the amount of OJ and lemon juice for more sauce!

Delicious Tilapia.  The butter made a nice brown crust.  I boiled down my orange sauce longer than 3 minutes.  Boil it for about 5 minutes, making sure you stir the fish drippings by scraping the pan, that way the orange juice takes on a professional savory flavor.  It came out great and thanks for the recipe. !

The sauce was very good, sweet and tangy. I have made it with chicken and it goes great!

Great flavor. So very easy. The sauce was delicious, Double it if you like more. Add a touch of sugar if your oranges aren't to sweet. Really liked by all!

Delicious and so *very* easy to make.  My husband and son loved it.  Both commented on how good the sauce was.

It's a good thing I started out with double the recipe, or I'd not have had enough to feed us.  We gobbled this fish down.

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  I did have to add some extra butter and olive oil to the pan as I was frying the fish, but that was only because I made more fish than the recipe originally called for.

Very nice tilapia recipe.  Added seasonings to the flour and dusted fish.  The 1/4C flour was just right for one pound of fish.  Added about 1T of honey to the reduced sauce for a little sweetness.  Great flavor.

This is an *awesome* recipe!  It is definitely very quick & easy.  My husband and I loved it.  I sprinkled lemon pepper into the flour, and substituted the lemon juice for 2 tablespoons of chardonnay.  Delicious!

Fantastic and easy.  I served it with steamed rice, and washed sweet bell peppers and placed them directly on the gas burner to blister them.  My husband and I thought it was delicious and was a super fast dinner.  Will definitely make this one again.

Pretty good--just not fantastic.  Might make it again, might not.  Flavor was good enough, just nothing that really stood out.

We've had this twice in the past week and a half!  I can't believe how easy and fast it is, 15 minutes start to finish, can't beat that!

I agree with another, tastes like tilapia with O.J. poured over it.  It was okay.  I won't make it again.

This dish was easy and sooo tasty.  I didn't have fresh lemon on hand, so used a bit of lemon pepper for the sauce & cut back on the pepper beforehand.  Also, sprinkled the fish with a bit of onion & garlic powder before flouring. My 5 year old daughter devoured every bite and had 2nd & 3rds! Yummy!

Very zesty.  If you are feeding someone who is weary of fish this is a good recipe to try, no fishy taste at all.
