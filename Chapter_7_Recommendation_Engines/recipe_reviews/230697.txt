This is the best dip I have ever had. Everyone loved it! I will be making this again. I did use fat free sour cream and fat free cream cheese. Tried to make it as healthy as possible!

I think that this would be better if you melted the cheeses sourcream, pepper flakes & jalapeno in the saucepan together then put them into a casserole dish. Top with the breadcrumbs and bake or broil to crisp it up.

This was very tasty-- Jalapeno poppers are one of my favorite appetizers, but are far too much work!  I already had a jar of sliced jalapenos in the fridge, so to be even lazier, I just used those and diced them up.  The recipe is great as-is, but since I always dip my poppers in ranch or blue cheese dressing, it is also good with a little of either mixed in.  Also, this serving size was plenty for my husband and me, but for a crowd, I would suggest doubling or even tripling the recipe.

I made this again on Superbowl and adjusted a few things that I think made it a lot yummier. I added about a  1/2 cup of diced up Velveeta and also a small amount of water to make it creamier.  It also doesn't hurt to add some garlic powder, maybe a teaspoon. I chopped up more jalepenos as well. It's still a great recipe, but seriously adding the Velveeta makes it absolutely perfect!

Note first: I made a few additions/ changes to this dip. I usually use the Jalape単o popper spread on here but we don't have mayo so I was looking for one that used sour cream instead. I found this and decided I'd try it. I didn't measure the sour cream or Parmesan so I probably put more than called for but that wasn't a bad thing. I also added a small can of hot green chiles (I only had 3 jalape単os to use. Oh yeah, I used fresh jalape単os.). I mixed in some parm as well as putting it on top with Panko crumbs (that's what I had on hand). I didn't heat on the stove top but used the oven. I baked it with foil on for 15 mins then took foil off and turned the broiler on for another 5-10. It's delicious! I'll definitely add more jalape単os next time just because I like it spicy but otherwise this was so yummy!

I tried out this recipe for the playoffs. I also was to lazy to go thru all of the trouble of making poppers. I thought it came out excellent. However, it was not spicy. The next time I make it, I will puree a bit of the guts from the jalapenos and add them in. I also added a bit of cheddar cheese simply because I make my poppers with both cream cheese and cheddar. I meant to take a picture but with all of the people I had over it didn't last long enough.

I preferred this saucepan cooked dip to many of the baked versions I've tried.  I added a good bit of plain fat free yogurt to thin it to a more dippable consistency and added a few more jalapenos because we like spicy.

I make Jalapeno poppers all the time, this does not taste anything close to poppers...I might try it again and modify by adding some bacon. It was a total flop as is.
