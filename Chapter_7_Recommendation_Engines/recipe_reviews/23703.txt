As suggested, I subbed in 2 eggs and milk.  Subbed oil for butter.  Very easy to work with and rolled out perfectly without having to use any extra flour.

I rolled out the dough by hand and made ravioli with it.  Very Good.   My hubby loved it better than store bought.

I had to add more water - probably another tablespoon or so, a few drops at a time - to get the dough kneadable.  That could very well have been because the air in my house was so dry.  I had to knead for almost 10 minutes, adding the extra water little by little, to get a dough I could roll out, but after that this recipe was so easy and the end result did not disappoint!  Cut into strips like fettucini and boiled for about 6 minutes - DELISH!
