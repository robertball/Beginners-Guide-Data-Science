I doubled the recipe cause we love brownies!  I used powdered cocoa instead of bakers squares.  I added 1/3 cup more sugar  & 4 tablespoons more butter.  Yummy!  (no nuts for my family)

I made these twice to make sure I hadn't made a mistake the first time. If I had cooked them for 25 minutes they would have been charcoal, as it was they were flavorless. I followed the instructions to a t.

It is really a tasty brownie with easy steps and ingredients! Actually, I reduced the amount of sugar into 1/4 cup of sugar as it will be too sweet! Since there is already chocolate, it is better to reduce the amount of sugar. Also, I used raisin instead of walnut and it turns out to be very chewy! I reduced the temperature to about 125degree c and the brownie has a chewy texture with oozing chocolate in the middle! Really tasty!

Delicious!  I put a half cup of chopped walnuts only on the top because I wasn't sure if family would like it in the batter. Still good!
