Well I followed the recipe to the letter except for the nuts, and it did come out very tasty... BUT I must have done something wrong, because the heaps of cookiedough just sort of melted and my final result was a thin layer of cookie-like substance where I could taste a bit too much of egg. This is probably my own fault as I am a 16 year old guy who just tried to bake for his first time ever :)

This recipe was excellent!  I halved the recipe since I didn't have all of the chocolate chips.  I also used milk chocolate chips in place of the white chocolate ones since my family doesn't care for white chocolate.  The cookies were firm on the outside, soft and chewy inside.  I loved the fact that I didn't have to use brown sugar.  I will keep this in my recipe file for a quick cookie recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe has become my go-to chocolate chip recipe the past three years!  I love the texture and taste and the results are perfect every time.  They end up as a mound cookie vs. a round flat one but I like it.  Perhaps i should flatten them with my meat tenderizer mallet....waffle pattern side down,  but I don't know.  I may try it.  Just happy with how it goes at this time.  Yummo!

I am a big fan of baking cookies and cakes, and I just wanted a simple, on-the-go recipe for chocolate chip cookies to use up some of the chocolate from the chocolate Easter eggs we had around the house...and I baked these cookies which were absolutely delicious!!! I didn't put in the walnuts, though... but the huge chunks of chocolate I put in really made the cookie sweet and firm in the right amount....wow!

I didn't care for this recipe. The dough was not sweet at all and made for a very plain tasting cookie.

These cookies tasted great! They are very sweet, but  not too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not use walnuts. I did not find them too cakey  like others seemed to find them. I cooked them for 11 minutes and they came out perfect!

These were good chocolate chip cookies.  I'm glad we made these, but they weren't astounding enough to be called "best ever".

The first time I baked them with one bag of mini baking M&Ms.  They were perfect!!!  The next time I used two cups of choc chips and although they came out thin, they were still pretty good.

These cookies were great! My younger siblings went wild over these. At first, when I picked up a cookie, I thought because of the light color and spongy bottom that they would taste undercooked and batter-y. Not true in the least bit! Best cookie recipe, hands down!

These turn out really soft and fluffy! They keep their shape great and look lovely. I do think I will be tweeking the taste a little, for me they are a little bland. Still, a great recipe!

Tried this today with good success, without the brown sugar it gave em a crispier, almost airy crunch that I personally like a lot. They're a little bit on the less-sweet side (may want to add molasses, honey or more sugar), but overall these cookies are really fricken good!

Had no brown sugar, and Thank goodness I found this recipe.  Great taste, didn't have nearly enough chocolate chips, so I added a big heaping tablespoon of peanut butter.  YUMM OOOOOO!  Great recipe, and thanks posting it!!!

These are fine, nothing to write home about and definitely not the best ever. I have a go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe that I couldn't make today because I didn't have any brown sugar. I guess for me chocolate chip cookies really need the brown sugar, or at least more sugar in general. The dough in this recipe was not very sweet or flavourful, and they ended up kind of dry in the end. The milk chocolate chips and peanut butter chips I used are helping. They'll get eaten but I won't make this recipe again.

I didn't realise i had no vanilla, so used orange extract instead. also i dont like white chocolate and had no walnuts, so missed them out too. everything else i kep exactly the same. They're really good :-) I put them in the oven for exactly 8 minutes, which was perfect. ANy longer and they'd have been over done. Will make these again when i have vanilla!!!

These are great cookies if you don't want the traditional TOLL HOUSE flavor. Less sweet and the chocolate really stands out!  Since the batter is much "whiter" than normal cookie dough, you cant cook them until they are golden brown or they will be dry. I cooked them 10 minutes and they were moist and perfect. I ended up using pecans instead of walnuts and it turned out great. I would not recommend making this recipe if you don't plan on using nuts as I think it would be a bland flavor.

Perfect recipe for chocolate chip cookies. Some complained about not being sweet enough, but with some black walnuts, semi sweet and milk chocolate chips they were delicious! We are not a cookie family but this is a definte keep!

This recipe is certainly not worthy of its name.  Cookie turned out with a really odd texture -more of a sugar cookie consistency. In my opinion, this is recipe is in dire need of some brown sugar. I wouldn't make it again.

Didn't like these cookies at all.  Very dry.  Little flavor.  After all the chocolate chips you put into it you can barely taste it.  Not sure why people are liking these cookies.  My 3 year old daughter didn't like it either. Will never make again.

Hot ! These cookies were deeeelicious! I substituted brown sugar for white, and used milk chocolate and dark chocolate chips, and boy oh boy were they good. So soft and fluffy and just absolutely delicious. I made a second batch, added walnuts and coconut and made them biscuit sized, and they were amazing. I will definitely be making these in the future!

This is the best cookie recipe I have ever tried!  I have been using it for about 3 years.  I always get rave reviews when I bake these cookies.  

I do however make a few changes to the recipe.  I have never used the nuts because my husband doesn't like nuts in cookies.  They still turn out perfect!  Some times I use 1 1/2 cups of white chips and 1 1/2 of semi-sweet.  Other times I use 3 cups of semi-sweet chips.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe!

Can cookies ever really be bad? Double chocolate chip cookies were given better reviews but still good.

A delicious traditional chocolate chip cookie. The sweetness is based in the chips versus the batter...a great change of pace. Produces a soft, but not chewy cookie. I used "Smart Balance" spread versus real butter and these turned out just fine. Bake time was a little bit longer though about 12 minutes.

Great Cookies I made these during Christmas for my co-workers and they were a hit.  I used semi sweet chocolate chunks and white chocolate chunks instead of the chips...and regular butter.  Other than that I made no changes and I will deffinatly make these again.

This recipe was good, however the cookies were not as moist as I was hoping.  They almost have a cakey shortbread texture.  They also do not spread out.  If you put a ball of dough down, you will get a hockey puck looking cookie.  This happened to my sister-in-law also.  My advice is to smash them down and make little burgers out of them to start.  The finished product is a lot better.  I might make these again, but will probably keep looking for "the best" chocolate chip cookie.

This recipe was ok.  I added my own changes and made them great!  I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 c, and added 3/4 c brown sugar.  You really could do equal parts white and brown sugar.  Also, to make them a little chewy-er, I use equal parts butter and vegetable shortening.

A few modifications-
I used 3/4 cup of butter and added a little over 1/4 cup of brown sugar (I just couldn't handle making chocolate chip cookies without brown sugar!).  That's all, I think.  I used a smallish melon baller to make balls of dough about the size of my thumb, then I cooked each batch for about five minutes.  The first batch came out thin and wafer-like, with tender centers- which was awesome- and the second were a bit fuller and more fluffy, which was still awesome.

This is exactly what I was looking for. My grandmother was looking for a softer cookie due to lack of teeth for chewing and this recipe was perfect for her as well. We all loved the flavor. As for the chips, use your own discretion , I did, I really don't think it matters what kind you use. I've used white and semi-sweet, today I'm going to try a batch of peanut butter and a batch of dark chocolate. Yum Yum.

These are really good cookies.  They were the first cookies I made when I decided to try baking. For people that don't like nuts in chocolate chip cookies, these aren't for you.  If you try to omit them, the cookie is not the same.  Not as soft and chewy. The nuts seem to help with that.

This chocolate chip cookie recipe worked out fabulously with a few changes:

- replaced all-purpose flour for wheat flour

- used 1 large egg instead of 1 1/8 egg

- used 1 cup instead of 1 cup and 2 tablespoons semisweet chocolate chips

- did not add white chocolate chips and walnuts.


The cookies came out tasting and looking like gourmet style chocolate chip cookies!!!!  My 14 and 6 year old sons, husband, and I love these cookies.  If you're looking for a chocolate cookie that's a little bit healthier than average, try using the wheat flour.  It's awesome!

these were VERY good. everyone loved them! i couldnt stop eating the dough! the only thing i changed was i used 1 egg instead of 2 to give it a chewey taste, because with the 2 eggs it was cake-like and i was going for chewey. they were very soft and delicious though. another thing is i baked them for 15 minutes instead of 8-11.

I use this recipe when I want to make a bigger batch of chocolate chip cookies. I do make some changes, I add 3/4 cup of brown sugar and cut down the white sugar to 1/2 a cup and it tastes greaaaat! The brown sugar gives it a softer touch.

I have tested my share of chocolate chip cookie recipes and these truly are the best, they are not too sweet and literally disintegrate in your mouth.  They are like a better version of Mrs. Fields cookies.  ps-if you like them sweeter add another half cup of sugar and you can also emit the extra chocolate chips and nuts, it tastes just as good.

Everyone I made these for loved them, I added a little bit more sugar than it says and they came out perfect!  I made them the first time with peanut butter chips and my co-workers went crazy for them, the second time I made them for my family without peanut butter and they were wtill great.  I will definitely be making these again!

the lightest, fluffiest cookie I've ever made! Hubby doesn't like nuts, so I did without. I gave five stars since I altered it, these cookies would be an easy 5 stars with the walnuts. :) I would advice others not adding nuts to add more flavor to the cookies with more vanilla extract and sugar.

yup, best ever... i used 2 cups mini baking m&m's instead, and substituted 1/2cup of the white sugar for brown, and only used 1/4 cup white sugar.  keeps the cookies soft and chewy, and oh so yummy.

Perfect. These could be served without shame to the Royal Family. I flattened them with a wet spoon before baking. These took exactly 11 minutes to bake. They're like a shortbread cookie with chocolate chips. Very different from all my other chocolate chip cookie recipes because they don't have brown sugar. Thanks for sharing.

This was actually my first time baking cookies, ever. I didn't use almonds. And instead of white chocolate chips, I used butterscotch chips. The cookies came out soooo soft and with the right about of sweetness for me. I loved them. SO much better than Mrs. Fields, that's for sure.

These are light, cake-like cookies. Not a traditional chocolate chip but when you have no brown sugar in the house they become a great choice! I made ours with Smart Balance and they were very light and yummy. I am surprised so many rated them as not sweet enough - more than sweet enough for me. I did use Ghirardelli chips which are larger than standard....and extra yummy! ;)

This is just not what I was looking for.  Made a batch and they are coming out of the oven now.  They aren't coming out flat at all - they are coming out looking like I put them in, only a little browner.  I thought they would look a lot more like the picture.  I have to say that I did not add the chocolate chips, walnuts or white chips, I added MnM's instead.  If you are looking for a cake-like consistency, then this is it.  I was looking for a very basic and traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe....doesn't taste at all like Mrs. Fields!!!!

After reading the reviews, most said these cookies were cake-like.  Mine sure weren't, at all.  I baked them until they were light brown and they were crunchy,,,,great with milk.  I HATE soft cookies.

These were good cookies, but the texture just wasn't right!  I tried them again and added a package of vanilla pudding and a little milk and that helped a little!

I  halved this recipe, and they don't even taste like chocolate chip cookies, they just taste dry and not even sweet.  I'm an excellent baker with years of experience, so it's definitely not me that's the problem with this recipe.

Very easy to make and very tasty!  They did come out a tad bit cake-y, but I may have cooked them  1or 2 minutes too long.  Next time, I will only cook for 8 minutes and see how they come out.

Dense and filling~ My two small girls helped me make these cookies last night.  The kids were pleased, and the cookies turned out very nice and cakey.   We used dark chocolate chips instead of white and semi-sweet.  In my convection oven I baked for 14 minutes to get a light brown crust.

These were super yummy! I was worried they would be bland because of the small amount of sugar, but they were great. I substituted half the flour for oats and used butterscotch chips in place of the nuts. They turned out thin, chewy, buttery, and absolutely delicous :D

I really loved this recipie. I made it for the kids at work and they loved them so much that I have adopted it for my family aswell and they cannot get enough. I only put in two cups of chocolate chips and no nuts. I find three cups is too much!

This recipe was ok.  I halfed the recipe and followed it exactly as written minus the white chips and nuts (didn't have any).  The dough was pretty bland, definately needed more sugar.  They were alright, but sadly did not live up to the name of Best Ever.  Prob will try them again tho, because I'm sure with a bit of tweaking, they will be much better.

These are by far the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever baked!!  I get only rave reviews when I bake these delicous treats! I use about 2 cups of mini semi sweet chips and I omit the nuts.  They come out perfert everytime!  The key is to not over bake them and leave them on the cookie sheet for the 5 min!  My kids can hardly wait until they are cool enough to eat!  Thanks for the recipe, I make them time and time again!! =)

I wish I had found this recipe years ago.  I have been trying to tweak the tollhouse recipe to get a puffier cookie with no results.  This is what I was trying to do.  What I love about it is that this recipe has half the sugar of the classic tollhouse recipe, so I don't feel quite as bad giving them to the boys.

I pride myself on being a chocolate chip cookie-holic, and I LOVE this recipe! I love a soft chewy tasty cookie, much better than the hard crunchy-crumbly kind. I had a feeling I was going to love these cookies when I mixed the batter and instead of grainy and sooty feeling the dough was light and whippy, making for a delicious chewy-center. These make the PERFECT cookies! I prefer bigger, more monster cookies, so I made them a little larger and got a dozen and a half cookies out of it, and they still cooked to perfection at 11 minutes!!!!! Thank you so much!

Very easy recipe. Not very sweet. Looking for a not so sweet cookie, this is for you. I would use milk chocolate chips though; gives a bit of a smoother flavor. It all depends on personal taste which is why this wasn't my cup of tea. For the most part it was a pretty soft/good cookie.

Ok....for chocolate chip CAKE. I was looking for cookies. I omitted the white chocolate chips and cut the recipe in half.  It was a little dry and definitely a cake.

5 stars isn't a high enough rating for this incredibly delicious cookie.  Every time I make this cookie coworkers gobble them up and family members usually have a 1/4 of them eaten before I finish baking.  I have made this for christmas presents, work functions and potlucks.  It is a winner every time!!!

These cookies turned out alright.  I think there were too many chocolate chips and it made the cookies really lumpy and big.  They tasted alright.

These "cookies" turned out to be small chocolate chip cakes.  These recipe was definately not the best ever.

Sadly disappointed!  Obviously someone is not eating at the same Mrs. Fields that I am.  The cookie was bland and cakelike.  They were eaten, but not raved over.  If I were to make them again, I would follow others advice and add another egg.  Still searching for the perfect recipe.

These were terrible! I followed the directions to a tee, yet the first batch burned, and the second batch was overly sweet, and underdone. I would think twice before trying these. --Marci

Loved the cookies- had to improvise on additions since we were on vacation trying to use up odds and ends before leaving. Used semi sweet chips, peanutbutter chips, M&Ms baking bits and dry roasted peanuts (totaling just about 3 cups)

Worst cookies I've ever made or eaten. They are too powdery almost like a biscuit, but mainly they are way too salty. This recipe should use half the salt.

I had to sub in some olive oil because I didn’t have enough butter, and I didn’t have the called for nuts and chocolate chips, so I put in a couple handfuls of almond, cashew, and chocolate chip trail mix I had on hand, which I pulverized. The base cookie recipe is great and you can add whatever goodies you want, it’ll turn out great! Had to bake them a few minutes longer than the 11 minute mark, so just keep an eye on them to make sure they get done enough for your taste.

Amazing!! Me and my friend were looking for a easy cookie recipe, when we came across one that needed no brown sugar we decided to give it a try. It was very simple and fast, it took about 20 minutes. We read some reviews and they were not the best, but we disagree. We love them and if you dip them in milk they are even better!! Do recommend!!

I loved this recipe! I made a few changes though. I don't eat eggs, so I used egg replacer instead of the eggs, and it turned out great! I also didn't use the white chocolate chips and the walnuts. Also, you definately don't need 2 cups of chocolate chips! I used one cup, and even that was to much, so next time I will only use half a cup.

I did not add in nuts or white chips, but I did roll each batch differently. I made a batch of small cookies that were rolled in ball shape, another with fork crosses and flatter, and a third batch of bigger cookies rolled in ball shape. They were fluffy and all decent, just were missing something in the dough.

I added more sugar  because I saw many reviews saying it wasn't very sweet ( unfortunately it was a bit too sweet for me ) and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder . Because chocolate chips and nuts are not always readily available and a bit expensive here, I opted for a bit of almond and dessicated coconut. They outcome was so wonderful. I tried making cookies with a crazy though before but it didn't workout for me. But I just found the perfect recipe here .

Okay, for one i did exactly what it told me to do and my cookies came out like bread. ?? I followed all the ingredients except for the walnuts and other chocolate chips. For the first batch it barely spreaded at all so i added one more egg. Still like bread but softer. Its like i made chocolate chip pancakes. Ugh.

I wasn't that happy with this recipe. I thought maybe I forgot to add an ingredient but that wasn't the case. The end result, the cookie was too heavy, very crumbly, not chewy at all. This was a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe so I was surprised at the end result.

Not what I was expecting at all. 
My family and I are big on cooking and baking; we do so all the time. We came across this recipe... and had to throw out the whole batch. My kids refused to eat them, it was too "fluffy" and "flaky" with little to no flavour. The result was quite disappointing.

This recipe produces a cookie like product, that isn’t bad, but definitely not a chocolate chip cookie.  If you are craving that warm, home-y aroma, nutty flavor that a traditional chocolate chip cookie gives, this isn’t the recipe to use. The texture is more fluffy, a bit like a cake batter mixed with cookie dough, and white sugar should be replaced with brown sugar. The molasses in brown sugar is really was gives the chocolate chip cookies it’s signature taste. They’re also not sweet enough... this coming from someone with not much of a sweet tooth. I ate the cookies, because they are still good and edible, but I was still left with the craving for a real homemade chocolate chip cookie. I used this recipe because I was out of brown sugar, so I wish the title would be changed from “Best...” to “Next best option when out of brown sugar”.  I would also recommend refrigerating the dough for a couple hours beforehand baking. I tried some right away, and some cooled and the cooled ones had more of a cookie texture. Good for a last minute recipe when out of brown sugar, but if you have the time just go get brown sugar so the calories are well worth it.

These cookies are a delicious treat!  They came out very fluffy, with a more bread-like texture than your usual ready-made cookie. Next time, I will add a little less butter, maybe 3/4 cup instead of the full cup. All in all, I will definitely make these again for my friends!

It's a thumbs up!  I'm happy that it is a recipe without so much sugar (no brown sugar) and the cookies were thick, soft in the middle and just a bit of crunch on the outside.

I USE I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER AND THE DOUGH FLATTENS OUT BETTER AND IS A CHEWY COOKIE.....USE A STONE PAN TO BAKE THEM AND THEY WILL BE CRUNCHY ON THE OUTSIDE AND GOOEY ON THE INSIDE!

I made these cookies with everything except the nuts and white chocolate chips and they turned out great! I was looking for a recipe without brown sugar and this one was perfect. They turn out more like a puff/crumble cookie rather than a flat chewy one, but they tasted great. Instead of heaping it onto the pan I'd recommend flattening it out a bit more unless you want to eat cookie balls! They were delicious for everyone.

I did not make any changed, but missed the molasses-like brown sugar in the taste. If you're looking for more of a soft, cake-like taste, this recipe is for you, but if you're looking for that good 'ole molasses, I'd stick to a recipe with brown sugar.

I wanted cookies but didn't have baking powder, this recipe saved the day. It's not as sweet as some other recipes, but I like that. This recipe is good when you want something a little sweet, but you are still trying to be good calorie wise. They are so easy to make it, and this recipe works well with more than just chocolate chips. Another recipe I will make again and again

I halved the recipe but these cookies were very plain tasting. They did not spread out but came out as mounds and the color was very pale, not golden brown even though I left them in for 11 mins.

We went exactly to recipe, and did not include white chocolate chips or walnuts and our cookies ended up flat, with a sponge like texture. I will not be making these again, and currently I am on my way to the grocery store to buy my own.

Nice and fluffy. Love that. But I do agree that the dough itself tastes kinda bland. My boyfriend loves it because they aren't super sweet. We were out of brown sugar so went with this recipe.

The only thing i would do differently is chill the dough before baking.
i made one batch and put the rest into the refrigerator while it baked and i had a much smoother result with chilled dough.

A great recipe for quick 15min cookies! They don't brown very much, so don't be surprised that they stay pretty light in color. LET THE COOKIES COOL, they finish cooking as the cool out of the oven.  I used regular salted butter, so I skipped the salt, and I added a pinch of baking powder. They came out very fluffy and soft! The batter is not malleable so don't add more flour, I thought about it and I'm so glad I didn't. They stay piled so if you like your cookies thinner and wider you'll have to shape them yourself. Overall good recipe (:

This recipe isn't bad, I think there's just a typo. It's either missing the 1 in front of the 3/4 cup white sugar (meaning it requires 1 3/4 cups white sugar) or the unknown quantity of brown sugar is missing completely. 

I made these cookies, tasted the dough and didn't want to keep eating it. I baked six anyway. They were hard. Almost like biscuits or scones and they didn't taste like much besides flour. Which I guess might be fine if you are using a regular flour and have low standards. But I was using a glutenfree cup for cup stand in and am obnoxious. 

So basically, I came back and  read the reviews and saw some other people agreed with my disappointed sentiment. So I took my remaining batter, returned it to the kitchen aid with just shy of an additional one cup sugar. Couldn't stop eating the dough. Can't stop eating the cookies.

My family LOVES these cookies. I do change it up a bit with what kind of "chips" I use, but I stick with the basic recipe. I do add a little more vanilla sometimes (when I'm eyeballing it). Have never made a bad batch, thanks for sharing!

Things I changed:
• No walnuts (I'm deathly allergic)
• No white choc chips (didn't have any)
• Used 1 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C of butter-flavored "spread" since I only had a stick and a half of actual butter
• Substituted baking soda for baking powder because I was out, and heck, I'm adventurous like that

The cookies were not as sweet as I am used to. But they're not bad or inedible at all. In hindsight, instead of leaving out the white chocolate chips, I should have just added more regular chocolate chips. Or maybe more sugar.

They came out with a great texture... kind of fluffy. Maybe that's the baking powder I substituted for the baking soda. I was really happy with the "mouthfeel"... not too oily/buttery, not too sugary.

These are great! Everyone has different tastes when it comes to the perfect chocolate chip cookie-- I prefer them to be light and fluffy, which is exactly what these are. The batter itself isn't very sweet either, but that's compensated successfully with the amount of chocolate chips. =D Gonna make these again soon.

This recipe was quite fun to make. It turned out okay, except I accidentally added one more teaspoon of salt, and that wasn't smart at all! At least the next day the salt had dissolved. But still, quite cool. Family and friends are demanding more!

I made this recipe with an egg substitute of  two tablespoons water, one teaspoon oil (like corn or vegetable oil) and two teaspoons baking powder for each egg. I also used half of the sugar called for and subbed the other half with stevia. They turned out really soft but not falling apart and melted very nicely in my mouth. My picky eaters declared this "The best!" and made me really glad that I chose to double the recipe. Will be making again in the future.

I absolutely loved this recipe, but I did alter it a little for my low carb diet,  substituting almond flour and stevia .  And I used dark chocolate chip and just used those for all of the chips and nuts. This made it super chocolatey and perfect. When my oven turns on at least.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, with all the mixed reviews, but was stuck because I had NO brown sugar and company coming!!  I modified it slightly in that I added 4 Tbsp. of peanut butter powder (PB Fit), and my choc chips were a combo of 1c. dark choc chips with two 4oz. dark choc bars chopped medium chunky. I added only a half cup of walnuts because that was all I had. I LOVE the texture and flavor of these cookies. My "all time" favorite cookies are Laura Bush's Cowboy Cookies, but these will go into my repertoire as a close second. They are more shortbread-y as others have mentioned, but I like that. I also made 12 very large cookies with this recipe, and used them to make ice cream sandwiches. They were a hit!!

A craving hit and I had no brown sugar. I made M&M cookies for my husband and I with this recipe and we both loved it. I halved it and mixed it all by hand and it came out perfectly. Thanks for this recipe!

I made these because I didn't have any brown sugar. They keep their shape, kind of a little mound of slight crunch in the outside and soft on the inside.
I wouldnt say they are the best ever, not very sweet, but my whole house is eating them.
The only thing I left out were the nuts. And I added a little more choc chips.

I loved the outcome. I accidentally used a little more sugar, but they turned out as sweet, crispy, moist hot mounds of cookie and I'll continue to use this recipe.

I also used vegan egg replacement and no butter, just shortening.

This is without a doubt my favorite cookie recipe. I personally prefer the chips to be the sweet part of a cookie, not the dough, so this was absolutely perfect for me (if you really like a sweet dough, you probably ought to look elsewhere - just looking at the recipe you can see there's significantly less sugar than in a normal cookie recipe). At high altitude (6000+), I actually do this without any adjustments - the cookie turns out high and round, crispy on the outside, but soft and airy inside. When I make these, I generally mix up the chips - I find I like these best with 1 c. butterscotch chips, 1 c. white chocolate chips, and 1 c. milk chocolate chips, in addition to the walnuts. This combination would be overwhelming in a recipe with a sweet dough, but it's PERFET for this.

Very good recipe...I did however add a quarter cup more sugar to sweeten the cookies up a bit and placed a piece of dairy milk chocolate on the top of each piece before baking.. They came out fluffy and very good... I will definately be keeping this recipe for a long time...

This was good, but did lack a sweetness in the dough. I think I really missed the brown sugar. The only change I made was to use semi sweet bakers chocolate that I chunked up with a knife because I didn't have the chocolate chips. I'm glad I did this because the smaller bits of chocolate mixed into the dough to make it a bit more sweet. The texture was great, soft and fluffy on the inside and they held their shape well. The chocolate combo and ratio was perfect, I love my cookies filled with goodies and these fit the bill.

I didn't have walnuts nor white choc/chips but i did have just plain choc chips, the batter seemed very dry for cookies, i didn't even add the 1/4cup of flour just 2 cups, i did everything the same i ended up adding extra brown sugar because they seemed so dry and not sweet.  I was just not impressed, and i make cookies for my kids at least once a week...i don't know but these are not good, they just arent

These were fantastic! I ended up using whole wheat flour and light brown sugar instead of regular all-purpose flour and white sugar (it was what i had in the house at the time). Tasted very healthy for being a cookie.

Wow, amazing and fluffy - just like the other reviewers have said, little crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. Nice and sweet and flavorful!  I omitted the chocolate chips adn did extra walnuts and white chocolate chips just cuz of what was in my pantry. I will definitely make again.

The best cookie dough we've ever had.  When we were done with it, we had enough dough to make 6 cookies.

I loved this recipe!!!! the cookie was not to sweet but not to bland. I made a few changes. I didn't put two teaspoons of vanilla, I put one tsp. of vanilla and one and a half tsp. of Rum extract. and instead of chocolate chips I put in a bag of Dark chocolate raspberry chips. With these small changes I got nothing but raves about these cookies.

Amazing! Soft and sweet. Love them. I didn't add walnuts cos they were for my daycare and only used 2 cups of regular chocolate chip cookies and they turned out great! Oh I also made them signifigantly bigger than a heaping teaspoon, about the size of a heaping tablespoon. Mmmm!

These cookies are very good.  I added about a 1/4 cup of milk to it because the dough looked a little dry.  I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and only 1/4 cup of white sugar.  I added a bit more vanilla and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and then 1 1/4 cups of all purpose white flour.  They turned out very good.  I didn't use white chocolate chips or the nuts though.  Only one bag (300 g) of Baker's milk chocolate chips.  Very yummy!! Something I would make again.

I thought these cookies were to cakey. They were not very good in our opinion. I will try a different one next time.  I gave it a 3 because my daughter likes it as just cookie dough. So it didn't go to waste.

These are absolutely wonderful! And easy to make! My boyfriend loves chocolate chip cookies, so I have been on a mission to find the perfect recipe. Mission accomplished. I did omit the nuts and I made them double the size because we like bigger cookies. Otherwise...awesome!

I thought these were just average cookies.  I do think this would be a good base to ad loads of extras nuts, fruit, chips.  It is more of a cake base cookie than a cookie cookie.  They taste fine just not our favorite.  Thanks for sharing.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever! I love that they are fluffy and rise instead of being flat and chewy like other chocolate chip cookies. I did change it up a bit though: used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 cup vanilla rice milk, and whole wheat flour instead of white flour. The texture was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I had been making cookies according to the package of semi-sweet chocolate chips.. I tried Hershey's and Nestle's and I was extremely disappointed.  These cookies were perfect!

These cookies were good but I definitely wouldn't call them the best ever. They were  a little too fluffy, kind of like a cake cookie. We ate the whole batch but I am still searching for a homemade chocolate cookie that is as good as otis spunkmyere's. No luck here.

I like my cookies to have a bit of texture and, this is a great recipe!  I only had pecans, and it still turned out great.  Same goes with substituting baking powder instead of soda.  I also only had choco chips and it still worked out deliciously!  Give it a go... It's a wonderful recipe!  Thanks.

My children loved these!  I liked the texture and look of the cookies. They are cake like. Personally, I did not care for the taste of these cookies.  They were lacking something.  I will try to make these again with a few changes.  I may not have cared for them, but the kids gobbled them up.

Very Yummy Cookies. They were extremely easy to make up. The dough seemed a bit runny, so I increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups. They turned out great. I really like them because they are not too sweet.

Good, standard cookie. Tends to be a bit dry, as other reviewers have said.

The cookie dough was delicious, so I thought these would turn out great - but they were very bland and cakelike. I even added extra chocolate chips, but to no avail - bland!
