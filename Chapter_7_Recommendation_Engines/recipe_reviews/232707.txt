This recipe works really well. I used butter instead of oil in the cornbread and saut√©ed veg in oil. For the bread and seasoning I used a box of chicken flavored stuffing I didn't want to waste. The flavor was perfect! I researched the pros and cons of the egg and I do think it needs it as a binder.

This was super good! I didn't have any celery but it was fine without it, I did add some celery salt to try to make up for it.
