Excellent flavor!  I had to modify the cooking times because the meat/temp I had did not need 3 minutes per side to sear and took longer in the oven.  Everything else worked very well.

By far the best recipe I've ever made!!!!  Sooooo good!  The only thing I did though was cut in half the amount of butter.  It was still delicious!

This has a really nice flavor. You can taste the ginger without it overpowering. My husband loved it. It made a great taste change for the steaks. Would probably work just as well with chicken.

I scaled this down to 2 servings and follwed the directions except for the garlic chives.  I haven't seen them on the Japanese market so I just finely chopped onion to let it dissapear into the sauce with the added flavor.  My husband and I loved the flavor of our angus tenderloin, melt in your mouth good.  However, it is extremely rich (must be all that butter soaked into the mushrooms!).  Next time I make this (and I will) I'm going to try half the butter half beef stock.  Hopefully it will still be rich in flavor without all the extra calories and fat.  Otherwise, I'll keep the recipe as is.  A very gourmet meal for a special occasion without a lot of fuss.  Make sure you know how much each steak weighs, mine was only 3.3 oz while my husband's was 8oz, so I had to brown it for less time and took it out of the oven much sooner and was medium.  My husband's was also medium to medium well with the listed cooking times. Oh yeah, my two year old devoured the mushrooms so I'll make more next time just for her.

Mmmmmm! Timing was just right for a lovely med-rare cut of tenderloin. I will be definitely making this again. The Asian flavors were fantastic. For a different flavor, I think I'll try sweet marsala with wild mushrooms and thyme next time.

This is obviously a huge deviation from the original recipe but I used shrimp instead of beef and it was quite good!  The one drawback for me (and it could be due to the different meats used) was the overabundance of butter.  I would definitely make it again though.  MMM!

This was a great and easy option for a dinner party.  I LOVE ginger, so I enjoyed the sauce very much!  This wasn't a recipe that I was overwhelmed by, but it was very good.

Way too much butter, but still a tasty dish.

This is an absolute party in your mouth.  I followed the recipe exactly except I build the foundation on seared asparagus with sesame oil and seeds.  Mashers on top of the asparagus topped with the Steak and smothered with the sauce.  I backed off the ginger a little as it tends to overwhelm the dish.  This has become one of my favorite recipes for steak.  I serve it to friends after an evening sail on my boat and they all demand the recipe.
