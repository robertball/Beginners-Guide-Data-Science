This recipe is excellent, just like my German grandmother used to make for us during the holidays!

To those who say that this is not a traditional "peppernut" I say BAH! Not everyone likes Anise, and not all Pfefferneusse in the German tradition contain it! 

This is a great recipe, turns out perfectly every time, even when doubled or tripled in quantity!

Having a 100% German mother and Grandmother this is more a molasses cookie than Pfeffernuesse although it does make a pretty good molasses cookie-if you want real Pffernuesse look for a recipe with honey, sour cream and most of all anise!

I don't know what "traditional" pfeffernuesse tastes like, but this recipe is great. Instead of dusting them with powdered sugar I made a thick glaze of powdered sugar, vanilla and water and dipped the tops in it. They were delicious.

Good! This is one of those recipes that needs to "marinate".  The cookies did not have much flavour at first, but each day,  they became increasingly flavourful.  A keeper.

These are FANTASTIC - I just made these for Christmas cookies and I am going to have to make another batch because we can't stop eating them!  This was a different cookie technique, with the melting of the butter and molasses, but it was all very easy to make.  They turned out beautifully - look like they came from a bakery.

This was ok...i guess I was expecting something different. Too cakelike for me but the taste did improve the next day. I even added more spices than what it asked for. Maybe I'll make again but use less flour and more butter.

Not quite the taste I was looking for, but very good. I used organic blackstrap molasses, and whole wheat flour because I once again forgot to get more all-purpose. Turned out very well, will make again as cravings hit.
