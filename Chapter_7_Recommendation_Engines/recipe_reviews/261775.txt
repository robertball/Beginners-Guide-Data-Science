4.3.18  Followed this recipe to the letter, using short grain rice, rinsing well, and letting it soak for 1 hour.  The flavor was good, but the texture was gummy.  I ended up stirring in some milk, trying to loosen it up.  If I make this again, I think I’ll try an instant pressure release "immediately."   I’m thinking that, perhaps, it sat in the pot for too long waiting for the pressure to go down naturally, continuing to cook from the residual heat, or maybe it needed more chicken stock, but not sure about this.  At any rate, I’ll try one more time and will post an update if this approach helps.  But as I stated, flavor is nice.
