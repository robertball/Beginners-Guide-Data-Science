11.10.17  Seriously, this is one delicious bowl of soup folks.  The chicken florentine soups Iâ€™ve had in the past always have been cream based, not this one.  The addition of the rice and the tomatoes differentiate it, the juice of the lemon will make you go WOW, and hands down, I prefer this flavor profile more.  Otterpond, thanks for sharing, this is a keeper!

I will definitely be making this one again. I made it exactly the Otterpond wrote it down, and it came out delicious. Two things I might change next time: more chicken broth and lemon juice to make it a little more soupy, and for sure only two servings for my hubby and me. We're going to be eating the 4-serving version all week! (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)

My husband and I enjoyed this soup.  The flavors really blend well together.  I followed the recipe fairly closely and it turned out great!

Soup, soup, beautiful soup!  The whole family collaborated on this, and the whole family enjoyed every drop!  We made only two minor changes.   We did not add rice, and this kept the soup grain free and low carb.  We cut the raw spinach into the individual soup bowls and poured the hot soup over the spinach.  This kept the spinach bright green, and it was not slimy in the least. Great flavor, lots of veggies, good, healthy food--thanks for the recipe!
