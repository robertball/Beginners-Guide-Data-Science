I would have rated it 0 stars if that was an option. This recipe has way to much butter and needs more flour. It is too greasy and i had to put it in a pie pan and make it into a cake form. When I made this it looked nothing like the picture. It turned out as a big pile of gunk.

This recipe is sooooo good!  It's been a week since I have made them, and we're all having withdrawls.  My three comments are this: 1) My cookies looked quite underdone when I cooked them at the suggested time, but take them out anyways because after sitting out of the oven for 15 minutes they are absolutely perfect. 2) I did spray the sheet lightly and it didn't hurt them.  3) My cookies were much more chocolate looking than the picture on the recipe.

I had a very hard time with these. First of all mix in a large bowl (my medium bowl was almost overflowing). Second I don't believe I cooked them long enough and getting them off of the cookie sheet was impossible. I also didn't use peanut butter m&m s but I don't think that would make the difference.

Try not melting the butter!  It will make your dough way too soft

I think someone is playing a joke on us. I don't think that picture is actually from this recipe. Mine turned out like big, thin manhole covers that stuck to the parchment paper. Sorry kids, I can't give it a good rating.

If they are cooked just long enough, they are nice and chewy. If they cook for the full time they are crispy. It's the melted butter. To make a thicker or 'fluffy' cookie, try softened butter instead. This is a GREAT base batter recipe. Great for sugar cookies too! Really really tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

I was wanting to make a basic batch of M&M cookies, and this looked like a great one to try. I omitted the cocoa powder and used plain M&Ms instead of peanut butter ones. The batter was too runny and the batter spread in the oven. I tried adding more flour, and after trying to cook one cookie, it still ran. I saved the dough - and I plan to add even more flour. I think there may be too much butter, and maybe 1 egg is better than 2. So, don't make my mistake of changing the recipe.

Everyone really liked these cookies. I did make some changes though. I used Reese's pieces in stead of M&M's. I also didn't want to add coco powder so I just added extra flour and I also used 3/4s cup sugar. They turned out nice a fluffy and very soft. I topped them off with peanut butter chips.

Well, first of all, these were really really hard to get off of the pan. I recomend spraying the pans with a non-stick, because I did that on my third batch of these and they came of pretty easily. This recipe makes a chewy, moist, tasty cookie. But I used chocolate syrup instead of powder, so it might have changed the taste.

I followed all the ingredients exactly. However, I did bake them for 15 minutes. I also let them cool for about 5 minutes before moving them to the cooling rack.  The dough is really soft, and requires a little extra work but the cookies turn out awesome!!!

First of all, cookies did not look like picture because of the cocoa.  My daughter said they look like cow paddies so we jokingly call them Christmas Cow Paddies. We used Christmas colored M & M.  We also used Splenda in place of sugar so my husband could enjoy them too. It is a pretty cookie but fall apart easily and I am not sure if this is because of the Splenda. I will probably make again though but try real sugar.

This recipe made a sloppy mess of my oven! The dough was too goopy, there was way too much butter.This one definately needs to go back to the drawing board.

I have no idea what happened to my recipe. So far two batches of sloppy goo! I've added an additional cup of flour to the remaining batch, but so far not a cookie that I can get off the pan. I don't think I'll try this one again.

I used these as the cookies in ice cream sandwiches. They were delicious. Nice and chewy. I would refrigerate them for a few hours before baking.

Delicious tasting. The recipe actually makes 3 dozen, not 2. Do not use melted butter, it makes the cookies too flat and crumbly. Use softened butter and use a large bowl to mix.

Loved it ONLY when I followed the advice of another reviewer when I creamed the butter and sugar together without melting the butter! Turned out great then! Also cut the butter to 1 cup instead of 1.5 and used regular M&M's, but I bet peanut butter M&M's would be good too!

Trust the butter instructions. They seem strange and turn the batter into a greasy mess, but the cookies turn out wonderful.  Sort of like crispy brownies.  We used peanut M&Ms instead of peanut butter

I followed the recipe with the measurements and ingredients but I put the batter in 8X10 glass pan and made them more like brownies. I had to bake them longer then instructed. They were still a little gooey but delicious.

It was terrible. Made to specs and like others, just awful tasting goopy brown cookies. What a waste of peanut butter m&ms. I would try to salvage it, but after reading the reviews, I give up. I wish I had read the reviews first.

Well the photo is not for this recipe. These cookies are a chocolate brown.  I needed more than what this recipe makes,(24 servings vs 60 servings). Thought that was too much butter so I cut out a cup of butter.  Did not melt my butter, but instead creamed my butter with sugar.(accidentally/glad I did). Rolled into 1 1/2" balls, and baked for 12 minutes...They were not greasy. When I took them out of oven, I dropped tray on the counter. Then continued to cool as suggested. (Only let stay on tray for 5 minutes.) Very yummy, family are hard critics, they wouldn't even let them completely cool. Son in law ate one a little warmer and announced,"Now that's how I like a cookie!"

This recipe was wonderful!! Cookies turned out so soft. The only change I made was not melting the butter (just let it come to room temp) My family absolutely loved them.

These were DE-LISH! I used them exactly the way it said, only with normal chocolate M&M's...but still, you have a gift!  I am a 12-yr-old who LOVES baking, as these were by far the BEST cookies I've made!

We loved this recipe! i only used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup white sugar, 1 cupe brown sugar. Also to get the cookies off, only let cool a few moments after you take them out of the oven, then remove to a cookie rack, if you wait to long they harden on the cookie tray

These turned out very yummy!! I did alter things a bit. I did one cup reeses peanut pieces and 1 cup m & ms. I added a hand full or peanut butter morsels. I would probably try margarine next time just to keep the fat content down a bit. but very delicious!

The cookies tasted great, but just like the other reviews, they were extremely hard to get off the pan. One cookie literally fell through the slits of my spatula.

Fantastic recipe! I actually mixed in peanut M&M's with the normal ones ^0^ tho the temperature converted to celcius was a big high... more like 75 degrees celcius for my oven.  Anyway, it was so simple and tastes so great! Thanks for the wonderful recipe ^_^

The chewy I've been looking for.  Use parchment paper to bake them on (in the plastic wrap section ), they won't stick!
I'm trying substituting flour for the cocoa next time for non-chocolate.

These cookies taste delicious, but the batter is runny and they won't come off the pan for anything!  We ended up scraping the first batch off the pan and the kids ate the little pieces.  I used the new white chocolate M & M's.
