I'm the pastry chef for victoria's secret cafe.  I made this for a lunch special and it lasted all of 1 hour before people were asking for more. This cheesecake is wonderful, I will definately be making it again soon. Thank you for the recipe.

I had some trouble with this--I had to bake this longer than the stated baking time, and by the time I could get the filling to set properly the apples were overcooked. I disguised the problem by covering it up with caramel sauce, which I think also helped to re-soften the apples!  Nice flavor and pretty on a plate, but with so many other recipes out there, I'm not sure I'd try one again that I wasn't entirely pleased with.

Very good!  I made half the recipe and baked in a 9" premade graham crust for convenience.

Everyone in our house and my DH work LOVED it. I found this recipe in a magazine-you know, plugging their ingredients-that said to bake at 325 for 1hr - 1hr+5min. For my oven (always a little cooler, I guess) I baked it 1hr+10min. My apples still looked wonderful. CHANGES: Added 1 Tbsp lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture(maybe a little more) and increased pecans in the topping to 1 cup (also, maybe a little more.) We love pecans in Texas! The 3 textures--creamy filling, chewy apples, and crunchy nuts make this desert heavenly. And using the foil as a liner to lift it out was really easy. Everyone at my DH office that tried it asked for the recipe. I didn't want to type it over for them. So I looked on AllRecipes. Yeah! It was here. Thanks for posting this winner for us lazy recipe hounds!

Received a lot of compliments on this. I did add a little cinnamon and lemon juice to the cream cheese portion. Topped with a little caramel too.

Wonderful recipe!  Everyone loved it and I have had a few requests for the recipe.  The prep time of 30 minutes here is grossly underestimated though, at least for a novice like me.

This was delicious! Had a great fluffy texture and a rich, not too sweet taste. Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! The only change I made was to use vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers for the crust because I do not like graham crackers. I will definitely be making this again & again!

This was really good and easier than I thought it would be to make. It was my first cheesecake and I was nervous but it wasn't that bad. Everyone loved it and said how unique it was. Next time I will make a little more crust and put more pecans but really it was perfect as is.

This tasted great, but I had trouble getting it out of the pan and keeping it presentable.  I like recipes that taste great and look great as well.  This did not look great.  Maybe with a little more practice, it will look better.

This is very good. I also added a little cinnamon to the filling and let it bake 10 minutes longer than stated. I also should note that the ingredients listed do not match with the amounts in the directions. I used the amounts listed in the ingredients and it turned out fine.

I cut the recipe in half and used a round 9 inch  pan lined with foil.  I put the pan in a water bath.  It still took 55 minutes to bake.

I have made this so many times I almost know it by heart. It’s delicious and my family and coworkers ask for it and rave about it. I do follow some of the other suggestions. I precook the apples with the cinnamon and sugar(this can also save prep time because I can make them ahead of time). I add cinnamon to the filling and the crust. And I add a crumble topping made with flour brown sugar and butter crumbled on the top.  If I choose to add pecans I sprinkle them over the crumble topping. I do cook it for an hour but turn the oven off and leave it in there for another hour.

Will make it as it sounds delicious with all of the different flavors.  But - although not stated in directions - is it obvious that the apples are spread on top before baking. 

Thank you!

Best ever cheesecake!  I did not have graham crackers so I made filling and poured into (2) pre-made graham cracker crusts. The filling fit beautifully.  I baked for 1 hour and when serving drizzled caramel sauce.  It was a hit!  Can't wait to get graham crackers and make it per the recipe!  It's a no fail recipe!

nice cheesecake especially for guests, just one thought; the apples could use a little cooking before putting them on the top, cooking in the oven does not make them very soft. They remain too crispy.

I was tempted to make this in a springform, but stuck to the recipe for my first try.  Remember that a 13x9 pan has 117 sq. inches and a 10" springform only has 78.5 sq inches.  That's why you need to increase the cooking time to 1 hour and 15 minutes if you make the switch.  I don't like graham cracker crust so I used vanilla wafers instead.  I also added a tsp of cinnamon to the filling.  It was very tasty and folks at the office raved.

I doubled the crust so glad I did.  It gave me more to work with so I could the crust up around the edges.   I did need to keep it in the oven for about 12 more minuets longer.  We had family and friends over for a fish fry and topped the dinner off with this pie.  It was an absolute HIT!!!!
