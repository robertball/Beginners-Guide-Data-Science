***UPDATE DEC 2010*** If you can't find true blackberry wine (Manichewitz) and French Vanilla cake mix, don't waste your money or time, in my opinion.  Grocer was out of the wine, and I used another so-called blackberry wine that was anything but.  Same thing w/cake mix. Didn't begin to take like the original cake.  If you've never tried the cake with the originally suggested ingredients you won't know the difference.  BUT, if you have made this cake with the originally suggested ingredients and then switch to something lesser, you will be disappointed, in my opinion.  LOVE this cake!  If you can't find Blacberry gelatin, I have used raspberry with great success.  I also recommend the French Vanilla cake mix. I pour 1/2 of the glaze over the cake while it is cooling in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, I invert it onto my cake plate and spoon over the top the remaining glaze. This gives you a moist cake on the top and bottom.  Definitely a crowd pleaser, and one my family has enjoyed for years. It tastes even better if you can plan ahead and let cake sit for about 3 days before cutting.  The flavor intensifies.

The cake itself was good.  It was super moist and had a great flavor.  The glaze was way too much.  Thankfully, I only used 1/2 of what the recipe calls for, then I dusted the top with powdered sugar.  Awesome!

My motherin-law made this over the holidays.  She got the recipe from a cookbook in North Carolina.  This is my new favorite cake!  So easy and so good.  She used Royal Blackberry Gelatin, available at Winn Dixie stores.  I love it.  So glad you have this recipe posted!

I have been making this recipe for years and used to think my grandmother invented it until I found a very old newspaper clipping with the recipe at her house. I have given blackberry wine cakes as gifts, served them at dinner parties and potlucks, and it is always remembered long afterward. A few notes to help those of you having trouble with the glaze. My version has a half cup of butter melted on the stove with the sugar and wine stirred in and boiled together for a few minutes. Then, while the cake is still in the pan, poke a thousand (or so) holes in the bottom with a fork or skewer and pour about two-thirds of the glaze over it. Allow the cake to soak up the glaze for 30 minutes before turning it out onto a cake plate. Then, reheat the remaining glaze and pour it over the top, for color. Allowing the glaze to soak in makes this cake so moist, you could literally leave it uncovered for days and it would not dry out. I have tried adding fresh blackberries to the glaze, and to be honest, it makes the cake look like a mess. If you really want the berries, I would suggest adding them around the base of the cake after you are completely finished, as a garnish. This is an especially good cake for folks who don't like icing. Don't be surprised when people cut 3" wedges for themselves, or when you catch yourself having some for breakfast!

I used Jell-O's Blackberry Fusion gelatin and it worked great.  After pouring half the glaze on the bottom of the cake, I mashed up some blackberries and added them to the glaze before pouring it over the top.  It was GREAT!  I served this at a dinner party and it was devoured.  Due to some of the comments on here I was concerned about it being too sweet but it was just right and very moist.  I will be making this again!

This was a very tasty, moist cake and was a hit at a recent picnic.  Good news for those who have a hard time finding blackberry gelatin, Jello brand has started selling a "Blackberry Fusion" flavor (Summer '07) which is a mix of blackberry and raspberry.  I used that and it turned out great!  None of the stores in our area sell the Royal brand of gelatin so I was very happy to see Jello's new flavor.  After reading many negative reviews for the glaze I opted to brush the warm cake with warmed blackberry preserves, which added a nice flavor.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Mine stuck so badly to my Nordicware non-stick bundt pan (which I had sprayed with Pam), that I could only get it out by digging with a spoon.  What I could get out tasted very, very good but I'm very sad that I didn't get a nice cake out of it.  I highly recommend greasing and flouring your pan even if yours is non-stick like mine.  Great taste!  Can't wait to try it again!

This was a great cake!!  It was impossible to find the Blackberry Gelatin, so I used the Black Rasberry Gelatin and it blended right in.  In the future, (or in season) I would like to try it with some fresh Blackberrys in the glaze.  It was a big hit at work!

This was very good, but I cannot find blackberry gelatin anywhere.  I ended up using black cherry.  No icing was needed.  It was moist and kept well for several days.  I plan to try it with strawberry wine and gelatin.

The glaze is way to sweet for some of my family members. So now after I pour the glaze on I use a poker to make wholes so it goes down into the cake. They like it much better.

Great recipe! Came out perfectly the first time I made it-- even though I replaced the jello with unflavored gelatin and a little bit of blackberry jam instead. It didn't come out quite as nice the second time I made it (per my mother's recommendation I used less of the unflavored gelatin).  I also tried the recipe the exact same way as the first time but with a passion fruit wine (this time just a little more than a cup of wine, no jam) and it turned out VERY nicely. Try it with any fruit wine!

My mother has made this since I was a kid---it is wonderful. I will not substitute any other gelatin though as I don't think it tastes the same at all. Royal is the only brand that carries Blackberry Gelatin. The brand is hard to find in stores but I order it online about once a year and always have the blackberry gelatin on hand for this cake. Just a tip. ; )

I have made this cake for years, except I have never made the glaze, I always frost with cream cheese icing. This is how my aunt always made this cake and it is very good.

This was ammmmazing. I made it for a dinner party and it was devoured quickly.  It did take me an hour to bake though (which easily could be my oven's fault!), and the top (techinically the bottom) sunk a bit, not sure why.    I used Wild Vines Blackberry Merlot, Jello's Blackberry Fusion, and forgot-the-brand's French Vanilla cake mix.  The glaze is super sweet, but it's made of wine and powdered sugar so that's to be expected.    I did take the cake out of the oven, cooled for 10 minutes, poked holes with chopstick, then poured half the glaze onto the cake, let it soak for 30 minutes, flipped over onto cake stand, and let it cool completely. Then once cooled I poured the remaining glaze ontop.   This was really good and I've already bought the ingredients to make again tonight :)

Not being able to fine balckberry jello anywhere (I'm not sure they even make it anymore), I used 1/3 C of Blackberry JELLY instead, and it was awesome!  I never did get the glaze to turn out right, so I just dusted it with powdered sugar instead.  Great and easy and smells incredible.

This is a great departure from the everyday chocolate or vanilla cake. It is a flavor that many folks are not used to, but everyone I know loves this cake. Easy to make too.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used a chocolate fudge cake mix. Used about half the amount of powdered sugar and had enough glaze but the cake was just a little dry so maybe more glaze would have made it more moist.  I used Arbor Mist blackberry which is a carbonated drink but that's the only blackberry flavor I found.  Also used raspberry jell-o.  I garnished with fresh blackberries and raspberries in the middle and around the edge.  It was beautiful and delicious - just a little dry.

This is my husband's new favorite cake!  I used strawberry jello since our grocery stores don't carry blackberry jello.  The cake was gorgeous, moist, and delicious.  After reading the reviews, I made only a half recipe of the glaze, and I am glad that I did that.  This recipe is a keeper!  I am going to go back for a second piece right now!

I use CHOCOLATE cake mix...yum! A few other minor differences (e.g. more oil). My neighbors liked this cake so much, one of them nicknamed it "God's Donut".

This is the best cake I've made this year:).  Actually, I'd have to go back a few years to a strawberry cake to even come close.  Like Ali, I used Jello's blackberry Fusion flavor.  I uncharacteristically followed the recipe exactly, and look forward to making and serving it again.

This cake was yummy.  I didn't change a thing the first time and it came out great.   The 2nd time I used Raspberry gelatin and it was great too!

Very good cake but a little too sweet for me! Next time I think I would just dust with confectioners sugar instead of adding the glaze.

This a wonderfully moist cake.  I made this Chaucer's Olallieberry wine and it was great. I didn't make the glaze but made a blackberry sauce instead (blackberries, more wine & sugar. My girlfriends think it is the best I've made so far. I can't wait to make it again.

This actually was very good but the smell turned me off.  Not being able to find blackberry jello, I used grape.  It was okay, but the next time someone leaves me some blackberry wine, I'll try lemon jello.
