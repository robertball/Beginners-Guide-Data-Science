Yum yum.  I doubled the zucchini and halved the couscous to increase my family's vegetable intake.  The cheese wonderfully disguises the healthiness of the dish.

Yummy! Made this for a dinner party and recieved lots of compliments. I also added more lemon juice and olive oil (After removing it from the fridge overnight, it was a little on the dry side. Great, light, refreshing summer side dish. Even my two year old enjoyed it!Will be a staple side dish from now on.

I made this recipe with quinoa because there was no couscous. It was excellent! Oil and lemon juice proportions are spot on.

So, my initial thoughts were that it was bland and dry. BUT the longer it sat in the fridge, the better and more flavorful it got. Needs at least 24 hrs.

Unless you want enough to feed the fifth battalion, definitely cut the couscous amount in half or it completely overwhelms the salad even when doubling the vegetable amounts.  As well, adding a lemon based dressing perks up a rather bland flavour.

I tried this with orzo pasta as it was all I had on hand.  It was very delicious and a great way to use up the bountiful of zucchini,  tomatoes and basil I had. Thank you for this delightful salad. I think next time I will try adding some chicken just to make it into a full meal.

Delicious! I only had regular couscous on hand, so I used 1-1/2 cups of that, cooked it accordingly and proceeded w/ the recipe. I did add a bit more olive oil and lemon juice than called for, but that was my personal preference. I agree to def make this ahead, b/c the flavors really develope well once it's had a chance to hang out in the fridge. Very light and fresh tasting...I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
