This was an easy recipe, with very limited ingredients.  I used only 2 chops and 1 can of corn for 2 people.  I sprayed the bottom of a glass pie dish to prevent sticking. It worked perfectly.  I also used a sprinkle or two of "seasonded salt"  Great if you have other things to do while dinner is cooking.  I served baked sweet potato with butter and brown suger.

This was just ok for us.  The pork came out VERY tender and was delicious, but there was a strange flavor to the creamed corn.  Hubby didn't like the corn on the pork and I wasn't too thrilled with the creamed corn.  The corn was a little bit soupy and didn't stand up well.  I ended up browning the pork just a minute on each side before baking in the oven, which reduced the cooking time by about 20 minutes.  I don't know if this is something I will try again, but thank you for the post.

I have been making something like this for years, sometimes I use a can of whole potatoes, or southern style frozen potatoes as my first layer, chopped onion, garlic, pepper, then chops and cream corn, so very good.

It doesn't look like much, but mmmm...is it tasty! I only cook it for 40 minutes though, and pile some of the corn on top of the chops to keep them moist. My friend was shocked when she saw this recipe! She said this is how her mom used to make pork chops. Thanks!

I read the reviews first.  so I played with the recipe a little.  Added some spices that I like.  The pork cooked a little unevenly.  And the creammed corn was so runny looking that my hubby wouldnt touch any of it.  I myself only ate the pork.  On to my point, the pork was very very tender and juicy.   I say it is a great way to make pork because so often pork gets really dry.  Nexty time I make it I will cook in the corn and then throw the corn away before my hubby sees it.  It really did look like a gloppy mess.  I know he will like the tender pork the corn yields though.

This was ok tasting but kind of weird. It basically ended up tasting like pork chops with a side of creamed corn which is not necessarily a bad thing - but not something I would serve all the time!

I'm definitely not a creamed corn person, but when I needed a quick, easy recipe for pork chops I tried this. I added lots of garlic and onion powder and pepper to both the corn and on top of the chops. I used lean pork loin chops and they cooked in about 45 minutes. Though the chops were a bit bland, they were pretty tender and juicy, which can be a problem with lean chops. The big surprise, especially after reading a few reviews, was that the corn was quite tasty as it picked up the juices from the pork.  
The dish doesn't look very appetizing, but if I was serving it to someone other than family I could sprinkle with chopped parley, red pepper, etc. to keep it from looking so blah. I don't know that I would make this again unless I was in a hurry, but I did give it an extra star for the ease of preparation.

Recipe did not say what to do with the garlic powder and salt and pepper - I sprinkled it on top of the pork chops but possibly it is supposed to be mixed in with the corn

Judging from previous reviews, this recipe would not have been very well received in my house. We don't like bland food AT ALL.  However, it's such an easy recipe to jazz up and make delicious! Spray the bottom of the baking dish with some Pam and add some cream cheese, bacon, and garlic powder to the cream corn before putting it in the pan, and be sure to season the chops up, and this meal takes on a whole new dimension.  Yum yum!

I wanted these to be good as I love pork chops and I love creamed corn.  But it just didn't really work.  The corn got really watery from all the juices in the meat.  I won't make again...I'll just stick to cooking the pork chops the way I like them and serving creamed corn on the side.

This was surprisingly good! Wasn't much to look at, but my husband, sons and I enjoyed it. One of my sons even hates corn, and he gobbled it up. My husband even came   for lunch and ate the rest. With mine- I added a chopped onion..

Wanted something different so I gave this a try.  Added onion, garlic, bell pepper and ground black pepper to the top of the chops.  Chops came out tender & tasty.  Not sure I will make it again tho.

i read a lot of the reviews and was scared to try it but i did and it was great! first i seasoned my chops with season salt, garlic powder, and onion powder and rub it all over them. then i sprayed the bottom of the pan. then put a little bit of cream corn on the bottom and put my chops on top. then i put the rest of the first can and half of the second can with some salt and pepper mixed inton the corn on top of the chops. then  i coverd and let cook for about 2 hours flipping and stirring every 30 min.. when the chops get rally tender, i took them out of the corn and put them on a foil layerd cookie sheet and put them back into the oven to let them brown just a little bit. i also put the rest of that second can of cream corn into the leftover, cooked corn and put that back into the oven till the chops were brwned! they were so good

I love pork and I love creamed corn, I even like creamed corn as a side dish with pork chops. That said, I just didn't care for this recipe. Cooking the two together just gave both a funny off-taste. Sorry.

This was a quick and easy recipe to make.  It was okay, but I think it has potential to be dressed up a bit.  It might be nice to add chopped garlic and freshly ground black pepper.  I will try this recipe again.

I make this recipe slightly different and I think more tasty. I season the chops w/ s&p and fry them and some onion in a little oil til brown but not cooked through. Place in baking dish and cover with creamed corn, bake at 350 uncovered for at least an hour, the longer you bake the more carmelized the corn becomes. The chops stay nice and moist too.

Not a fancy recipe but my whole family asked me add it to the rotation which surprised me. It was super easy. I took other reviewers suggestions & added some garlic powder, seasoned salt,  fesh parsley & added some green onions on top. Next time I think i might try topping with some panko to give it some texture.Chops were very tender!

I was a little scared to try this recipe after reading the other reviews but tried it because my husband said his mom used to make something like this for him. So I followed the recipe to a T. I personally had no problems with this. My family enjoyed it tremendously..We did not think it was bland at all. I served with some great roasted potatoes and a nice fresh salad and let me tell you there were NO leftovers. I will defintely make this again and again and again!!! Thanks

Easy - nothing exciting but I found I had somehow acquired many cans of creamed corn in my cabinet that I decided to make this.

This was a really great and quick recipe.  I did doctor the cream corn like others before me had stated.  I added a tablespoon of brown sugar for each can of corn.  I also used nature's seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  It is and all inclusive spice.  It works for everything.

My husband loved this recipe and asked that I add it to the rotation.  Here are the changes that I made:
3 pork chops
1 can creamed corn
1 can corn with red peppers
2 cloves of garlic
6 pepper seasoning
Sprinkle the chops with salt, pepper, & 6 pepper seasoning mix.  layer chops in pan and pour the corn over.  Bake at 350 for 2 hours.  
Searved with the corn (drained) that was baked with the chops.

Not so good. Yes, it's simple to make and yes, the pork was definitely tender. Aside from that, I thought this was a bland meal. I didn't like the combination of creamed corn and pork. I will NOT be making this recipe again.

Not bad.  Something different.  May make this again every few months.  I used boneless chops.  They were moist when I cut into them which is always a plus.

Quick & Easy!  Tastes good too (and I don't care for creamed corn).  I made homemade mashed potatoes and used the creamed corn as gravy.  Will make this again!

Aloha from Hilo Hawaii...I sprinkled the seasonings on the chops and alittle bit of pepper on the corn. It was the bomb the chops just fell apart and basically melted. My kids loved it but the husband fell asleep before he could enjoy it.  Next time I do it I will add 1 Tablespoon of oyster sauce in with the corn just to add a spin to things.

I made this before I rated it.Is this some kind of joke? It's pork chops and a can of cream corn! Do not waste your time on this one. You can come up with something better than this.

Had to go by previous reviews, so yes, did make a few changes. Main one was using 1 can of creamed corn and 1 can of whole kernel corn, well drained, since many said the dish was too "juicy". I also added some sliced onion and a few cooked slices of potato, and that thickened it up just fine.  Generous with the garlic powder and some seasoning salt on the pork chops, as well as lemon pepper and it was a good dinner. Anytime you can get tender and not dry pork chops you have success:)

Yummy!  Busy day lead me to cook it in a crock pot..tender and delicious. Cooked 3 thick pork chops in 2 cans cream corn. Will add another can corn next time because it was so good. Trimmed fat from pork chops.

I give this recipe 5 stars, All I had to do was put it in the oven and it was done in an hour and a half, in which time I prepared sides to go with the pork chops! My husband loves corn, so this is his favorite recipe at this time.

I don't know what went wrong, but the corn was really salty!  I could barely eat it!  The pork chops were not as tender as I like them, but my husband thought they were good.  I will try it again sometime, it was very easy and very fast to prepare.

I stirred in 1 tablespoon of minced garlic (probably too much if you don't love garlic) instead of the garlic powder, and sprinkled a liberal amount of salt and pepper over the meat and corn.  The pork was fall-apart tender and the corn was delicious.

This is a great recipe for those day's when you just want to relax while cooking at the same time. And the meat is so tender, you cut it with a fork.
