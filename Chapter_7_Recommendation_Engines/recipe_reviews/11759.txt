The recipe as is deserves about 3.5 stars, it is a bit bland.  However, I made some changes that made it excellent!  We like extra sauce, so this is what I did.  I doubled the heavy cream but kept the butter amount the same.  I then added in a few tablespoons of cream cheese.  I used 3/4 cup of grated Romano cheese and a large handful of shredded mozzarella to make it creamier.  I also added in 2 teaspoons of garlic powder for some additional flavor.  I then let that sit on the warmer on my stove and sauteed some chicken in garlic and butter.  I served the sauce over fettucine noodles and put the chicken on top of it.  Garlic bread on the side completed a fantastic meal!!

This is a great, simple side dish recipe.  I have made this several times now, even using regular milk to do so.  Although, it is much better with the cream.  I don't know that I would change anything else as they are perfect.  We have these noodles with chicken at least once a month.

Our family loves this dish. I normally double the recipe and substitute 1/4 of the parmesan with shredded mozarella. That seems to make the sauce smoother. I also use half & half instead of heavy cream...haven't noticed a difference. Takes about 15 minutes to throw together, so it's great for busy nights.

This is an excellent recipe, with the reduction of butter to 1/4 c. or less. I can tell from their comments that a lot of people probably used Kraft Parmesan in the can. You cannot use that junk in recipes! That's a topping only! You have to use the real stuff from the refrigerator section in any recipe that calls for Parmesan mixed in a sauce.

Also, some people use "grated" when they really mean "shredded." Even though this recipe said grated cheese, they did not mean Kraft grated cheese in the can.

This is by far the best alfredo sauce I've ever made, although I have to point out what I would change.  It was too thick and too salty for me, which made it impossible to add chicken to it.  Because of the thickness, we were already eating two servings of sauce each--any less would not coat all the noodles. Next time I will use less butter or at least use some unsalted butter, and I might try using half-n-half instead of heavy cream.  Either way, my boyfriend said he'd pay $15 for it at a retaurant!  Best compliment he ever gave me...!

This was pretty good.  I was looking for something fast and easy to make with leftover egg noodles.  I used 3 tbps of fresh parsley instead, and the key to having a smooth sauce is to use freshly grated parmesan, not pre-shredded.

Amazing! this is my go to alfredo sauce period.  some tips: if you use a canned grated parmesan like Krafts, use unsalted butter and use about 1/8 cup less.  Canned is saltier and its stronger. do try to use fresh hand grated parmesan in you can get it... when you taste the difference you'll be amazed.  you can switch heavy cream or half and half or a mix of both.  I've actually used just plain milk (with a bit more butter) there is a longer method of alfredo with butter, flour chicken stock and cream with parmesan.  Its wonderful too, but for fast and easy, this is the best! This is delicious but plainer side dish and I would seved with more complex main dishes.  However, if my main dish is just plain, ie roasted chicken.. I'd punch this up a notch with maybe some spinach, some garlic, some mushroom... the varieties are many! This recipe as is deserves 10 stars. Thanks for posting!

We enjoyed this one!  I wanted to prep this ahead, so I cooked the noodles ahead of time and refrigerated them.  I also put the alfredo sauce together ahead and refrigerated that separately.  Just before dinner, I reheated the noodles in the microwave and the sauce on the stovetop.  When both were heated, I combined the two and served.  Very good and one I would do again.  Next time I will add a little garlic to the alfredo sauce.

After reading the reviews I was afraid adding mozzarella may make the sauce a little stringy, so here is what I did. I melted the 1/2 cup butter in a large sauce pan and sauted 1 clove of finely minced garlic, about 30 seconds. I added 8 ounces of softened cream cheese, and only 3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese; sprinkled in some white pepper to taste and the parsley (I didn't add any salt). Stirred that constantly until the cheeses were melted and butter was fully incorporated (if the sauce isn’t hot enough it may seem grainy or separated but keep heating and stirring and it will come together.) I then added 3/4 cup of milk (didn’t have any cream) and stirred until the sauce came to a simmer and started to bubble around the sides of the pan. I put the 8 ounces of hot, cooked and drained noodles into a serving bowl and added the sauce, tossing to coat. This turned out smooth and creamy, and absolutely delicious! This sauce thickens as it cools, so serve immediately. If the sauce does thicken, or you like your sauce thinner; just stir in a little additional milk. You can add hot cooked chicken, shrimp or vegetables, along with the noodles. Also makes a great sauce for chicken or vegetable lasagna or white pizza.

I made this after my husband requested chicken alfredo. (I cooked up some chicken breast and served it with this.) 

He liked the flavor, although I thought it was a little bland (maybe some garlic next time?). My biggest problem was that it never thickened up - he called it "soupy."

Either way, I'll probably keep playing with it; maybe I'll add flour or cornstarch next time.

This was very easy and tasted great!  I used regular pasta noodles instead of egg noodles and added in a little minced garlic.  I added some grilled chicken pieces to serve as our main dish and got nice remarks from my husband - who is not a huge alfredo or chicken fan.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hummmmm....this recipe is one I have been making since 197l, published in Betty Crocker. Even the name is the same.  The only difference is heavy cream instead of half & half.  It is a a very good dish but it requires good Parmesan Reggiano.  It has spoiled me for the commercial bottled sauces which in no way resemble this sauce.

Quick, simple and easy to remember, all the while being very good!  I've used this multiple times now and each time it satisfies! Following the directions exactly renders a good Alfredo which can be easily customizable, but perfect if you just want to whip it together after work!

As is this recipe is a bit heavy and bland.  I used less than half the butter and added a large clove of freshly minced garlic to to the butter and soften until I could smell the garlic odor coming off before adding the cream.  I was very generous with the fresh ground black pepper. But now we have a classic Alfredo sauce.  :)  Add roasted chicken and broccoli for a fast main dish, or one of my favorites is to add smoked salmon.

Very nice! My 16 year old son made this tonight. We followed instructions exactly. The cheese was a bit grainy and did not melt all the way but we did use pre-shredded parm instead ofr shredding it ourselves. That would account for the graininess. Over all, delicious!

This is pretty good...I actually didn't have any fresh parmesean cheese, and from past experience I didn't want to use the grated kind in the can. It just does not melt well...too grainy. So I thought I would experiment and try shredded mexican cheese. It was actually not bad...I used spaghetti noodles, and sprinkled on some garlic and herb seasoning and a little crushed red pepper. Didn't use parsley, but sprinkled with grated parmesean when it was done. Pretty good for something different!

Delicious! Received rave reviews from kids and hubby. I added chopped, cooked broccoli and cubed, cooked chicken to the sauce before pouring over linguini. This will be a standard in my kitchen for sure!

there are all kinds of alfredo sauces here on allrecipes...with all kinds of fancy stuff added....but sometimes (as in this case) "less is more" or "simpler is better". Loved it. Flavor wise the only change was to add a pinch of garlic...but even without it tasted great since I DO spring for high quality parm cheese. The only other thing I changed in the name of *trying* to make alfredo saucue a tad less unhealthy was to use 1c of half and half in place of the  heavy cream and butter. It came out just fine.

Good recipe. I followed suggestions of other reviewers and added 3T lite cream cheese, 1cup part skim mozzarella cheese, garlic powder and substituted 1 cup half & half for heavy cream. That brought it up to 5 stars! Everyone loved it! Thanks for a great recipe Wildflower.

My fiance, who does not cook often, made this for me the other night.  It came out great!  I have always been reticent to try out an alfredo redcipe because it seems complicated, but he said this was easy to make.  He added a little mozzarella cheese because we didn't have quite enough parmesan on hand.  He heated some leftovers up the next day and said it still tasted good, but the sauce did separate a little (normal for alfredo, I think).

Everything was going smooth for me until I added the pasta to toss with the sauce. As soon as I added the noodles, the cheese instantly clumped. Maybe it would have blended better if the noodles were really hot? I am not sure? It still tasted okay but just didn't look very appetizing. I think garlic and fresh parsley would be a must if I make it again.

The other night my husband requested something with egg noodles and broccoli.  I had no idea what to make, so I started looking and stumbled across this recipe.  I had to improvise a bit as I didn't have grated parmesan, so I just used grated marble cheese instead.  I added 3 grated garlic cloves to the butter (we like a lot of garlic) and cooked for about 30 seconds before adding in the rest of the ingredients.  I steamed some broccoli and added some shrimp to the sauce - tossed everything together and it was a complete hit!  Thank you so much for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!!

I have to say that it has taken me awhile to write this review, but this easy-breezy recipe should not be overlooked!  I actually make this so regularly that my kids are disappointed when I say we are having noodles with our chicken and it is not this recipe!  That being said, go ahead, try it and you will see how great it is.  I substitute half and half for the cream because who are we kidding, I always have that on hand!  I also cut the calories by spreading the sauce over 16 oz. of wide egg noodles and it doubles the noodles and cuts the sauce per serving in half.  It still tastes delicious and the leftovers whether eaten cold or warmed up are divine!

This is a very good basic alfredo sauce recipe.  Really good.  I think the people who didn't think it was that good, maybe just need to add a little more salt and pepper.  ??  I loved it.

OMG!!! Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!! I've made a few other alfredo sauces that were horrible, so I was a little nervous. But this one is so quick and easy and the flavor is unbelievable!! I've used it to make chicken broccoli alfredo and even my husband loved it! Would give more stars if possible---thanks for sharing!!!

We really liked this.  The only change I made was to use 2 teaspoons of parsley instead of a tablespoon because that seamed like a lot to me.  It was really saucy and not that there is anything wrong with that but it could probably work with 12 ounces of pasta just fine.  A definite keeper!

I first made this a month ago, and the only things I changed were to use twice the amount of heavy whipping cream while keeping the butter amount the same, adding in a teaspoon of garlic powder, and a handful of mozzarella cheese. Also, since shredded parmesan doesn't always melt nicely and smooth, once it's hot and the mozzarella has melted, I pour it into my BlendTec blender and give it a few pulses. This smooths it out very nicely. Be careful to hold the lid on with a dish towel covering your hand as you do not want to accidentally burn yourself.

It is excellent. My kids loved it. I pair it with homemade breadsticks, and we all love dipping the breadsticks into the sauce. 

We are having it again tonight. Yum! Thank you for the recipe, WILDFLOWER12!

I have made a very similar recipe. We make this all the time.  The directions were different. After draining the noodles you put them in the bowl then add the grated cheese, mix into the hot noodles, then you pour the melted butter and heated milk or cream over the noodles and mix, I think this will help prevent the clumping.  You could also melt the butter and just add a little flour, I think I did a tablespoon, maybe 2 I can't remember,cook the flour then add the cream or milk be sure to be mix or whisk while doing this till it is smooth and then pour over your hot & drained noodles.

Probably the best homemade alfredo sauce I've made so far.  I used fettucine pasta and also made some modifications to the recipe.  I added a little bit of minced garlic as well as garlic salt for flavor.  I also added 4 oz of cream cheese and a couple tbsp of chicken broth as well.  When it was almost done, as I was stirring, I noticed that it was a little too "soup-y" so I added a little more heavy whipping cream.  And I didn't have any parsley, so I left that out.  It came out rich and delicious.  I ate more than I could handle.  I was a little grossed out that some of the butter leaked all the way down to the bottom of the bowl, so maybe next time I'll decrease the amount of butter I put in this sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight and I should really give it three stars, but with the adjustments I made it was better. I made the recipe suggested first and it was way to buttery. I added more cream, cheese, and some italian seasoning and it was a lot better.

I loved this as a fast and simple side dish or snack. It took me less than 10 minutes to make, and I had all of the ingredients on hand. The sauce was thick and creamy and tasty.  I added a clove of chopped garlic for some extra flavor, and I used shredded parmesan.  Delicious!

The noodles alfredo was incredibly good.  I was out of some of the ingredients, so I substituted some of them.  Rather than whipping cream, I used skim milk, and I used more salt, parmesan cheese, and pepper than stated.  Also, this recipe would be incredibly good with diced, cooked chicken breast in it.

I probably used too many noodles because I had to estimate from a big bag so it wasn't very saucy.  This is a good side dish.  You could probably use different kinds of cheese if you wanted to.

I cleaned out my pantry and noticed that I had several bags of egg noodles to use. This was quick and pretty tasty. I used shredded parmesan instead of grated and reduced the parsley down to one teaspoon and didn't add the salt. Think this would be a perfect base to add cooked chicken and broccoli.

This is THE PERFECT recipe for Alfredo sauce.  I used Fettucini and cooked the recipe exactly as stated except I did not add parsley.  The response from my family was overwhelming.  This is a WONDERFUL recipe and I wll be making this often!!!  Thanks Linda!

I have always wanted to make my own alfredo sauce and made my first attempt with this recipe. Wow it was so delicious!! I added shrimp, scallops, and clams and had it with fettucine. I have given the recipe out already to a few friends. I will make this again and again! Thank you!!

DELICIOUS!!  I made this with feffuccini and added shrimp and scallops that I first sauteed in butter and garlic. Absolutely wonderful.

So quick and easy!  I added a few peas to brighten it up!  I'm wondering how other cheeses or vegetables might work!  With the simplicity of butter, cream and cheese as a base, you could add any veggie or meat and it would be great!

Perfect, just what I was looking for.  I only made a couple changes.  I didn't want to use up all my Parmesan cheese so I used half that the the rest with regular american cheese.  Turned out perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious and very easy. I have added this into the regular routine and make it every 2-3 weeks. I have used 2% milk, half and half and heavy cream, (and mixed them) depending on what I had on hand, and all worked fine - heavy cream was just more smooth. I have also added garlic and enjoyed the results.

A quick, easy and delicious side dish. I intended to make this as is, as I added my cheese, I noticed that what I had though was parmigiano was actually asiago.  I added it because that is what I had and my butter and cream was already melted and ready.  It was excellent.

Good recipe but I also had a problem with my cheese melting.  I added 4 oz of cream cheese and kept the sauce on low until it melted and that seemed to help some.  I also addedd 1/2 tsp of minced garlic.

Letting the cream and butter simmer at a low heat will make it creamier and take out the grittiness out of the cheese. I also add 2 tbs of cream cheese during the simmer to add creaminess.

I did not enjoy this, it was too rich and I think 1 cup of Parmesan may have been too much.  I used real Parm, not the stuff in the green can.

Pretty good, but after tasting it I decided it needed garlic! So I quickly sauteed a couple cloves and added them in, totally fixed it. Thanks!

Delicious! I used italian seasoning instead of dried parsley since I didn't have any...it was so good! I served the alfredo as a side dish with a light tilapia as a main dish and some broccoli.

I accidently used double the liquid, keeping the other ingredients the same and thought the consistency was perfect.  A little bland but a good start.  I will try adding garlic and/or mozzarella cheese per other reviewers suggestions next time.

This is wonderful! I did make some changes mentioned by another review, I doubled the cream and added romano, garlic and a handful of mozzarella. I also added some spinach to the sauce at the end. I served it over egg noddles with slices of chicken breast.

We loved it but did not give it 5 stars since we used other people's advice on a few things.  I used 1/4 c butter instead of 1/2 c, whole milk instead of cream, omitted salt, added 2 t Italian seasoning, and added broccoli & red pepper.  I would have added chicken but did not have any in the house.  The sauce was awesome!  My 10yo son had seconds, and wants to take the leftovers to lunch tomorrow.  Will definitely make again with chicken.

Best Alfredo recipe I've come across so far- and I've been looking for one for several years. Other recipes are overpowering or overly rich. This one is just right, and complements meat or vegetables. Our three teens like it with noodles alone.

Ugh, sorry this did not work out for me at all. The parmesan was all gritty and lumpy and just tasted like pure canned parmesan in butter. Perhaps it would be better with real parmesan?? Not sure I would bother with this one again, personally. I made it with Chicken Francese for one (on this site) an kept the sauces seperate, but I think the recipes used much to similar ingredients to go together.

this was pretty good...i took other people's suggestions and added garlic, subsituted half and half for the cream, used unsalted butter, omitted the salt and mixed with chicken.  the sauce looked grainy (i only had pregrated parm cheese on hand) but i thought it tasted great!

This had great flavor and adds a great side dish to any main dish.  The cheese became a little chunky but I think I cooked it too long.

My entire family loves this recipe.  It's quick and easy.  I also cut out the extra salt, use different pastas, and have used as a main dish with a salad on the side.  To make the sauce go farther, I spoon it on top of each serving, instead of mixing it all together.

Not too happy with the way this one turned out.  Having read the previous reviews I added the parmesan 1/4 cup at a time and stopped at 3/4 cup.  I was expecting more of a smooth, creamy sauce and this turned out oily and grainy.  I won't be making this recipe again.

Didn't like it too much, it was too much cheese.  I expected something creamy like a carbonara sauce, but it was really thick instead.

I never thought I would say this about a recipe, but it has too much cheese!!  It doesn't really taste like alfredo sauce to me.  I've had really good home made alfredo, but sorry, this isn't it. It certainly doesn't taste bad, it just isn't the classic sauce I am looking for.

I found this too buttery and couldn't get the sauce to mix well at any time. I am not sure why, maybe it was the gas stove I was using. Anyway, the flavour was okay but nothing fantastic.

WOW!  This is the first time I've ever commented on a recipe... this is so delicious and VERY easy!  You are talking to a girl can mess up boiling water, so if I can do it, anyone can!  I added broccoli and chicken on top, and it was perfect, better than a restaurant.  I also omitted all extra salt.

I really liked this recipe!  I doubled it and added chicken and broccoli.  It was great!  I did make a few alterations.  I agree with using unsalted butter and possibly omitting all or most of the salt...the parmesan cheese made it salty enough for my taste.  I also substituted half and half for the cream.  It was still a bit thick after adding the chicken and broccoli, so I thinned it with a little 2% milk.  Very yummy!:)
