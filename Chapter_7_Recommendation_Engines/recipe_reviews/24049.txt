I love these mints.  If the patties don't thicken don't give up just keep adding powdered sugar and kneading.  You won't be disappointed

This was quite a disaster. I was looking for a good mint patty recipe with a firm filling, however even after FREEZING the mint filling, it was not firm enough to form a ball or a patty for that matter. So because I did not want to waste all of the expensive ingredients, I dropped the filling by spoonfuls onto wax paper and drizzled melted chocolate on top. I couldn't even peel them off the wax paper they were so sticky! I tasted of one and ended up throwing the rest away as they were not at all presentable.

So I was nervous about making this recipe after reading reviews but it's the only mint one I could find so I went for it.  I did 2 C.  pwd sugar, 1/3 c. margarine, 1 TBS corn syrup(or a tad more) and a couple drops peppermint.  It has turned out thick and yummy so far, we'll see how the rest goes.

The mint center filling didn't thicken enough to make patties, so I spread the mixture on a cookie sheet and poored melted chocolate on top and then cut them up.

This did not turn out at all.  I did everything exactly as instructed, but even after refrigerating over 24 hours these still were runny.  I added three more cups powdered sugar and they still won't firm up enough to do anything with.  I'm afraid I will have to throw the entire thing away.

very soupy. after reading other reviews, I was prepared to add lots of powdered sugar. Even after 3 extra cups of powdered sugar it was still not the right texture. It was entirely too grainy. I do NOT recommend this recipe!

I love this recipe! I've made it twice with no problem. Everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly. Make sure you chill them for an hour, as you are forming the patties your hands are warm and they get a little soft. Just put them back in the fridge for a little and start making more after they are chilled again.
