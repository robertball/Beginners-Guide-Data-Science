To make without a bread machine: Put yeast and warm water in mixer like Bosch or Kitchenaid, let sit 5 minutes or until frothy.  Add brown sugar, butter softened, onion, onion powder, dried milk, salt, poppy seed, and pepper in order.   Lightly mix for 15 seconds.  Add flour until it pulls away from the sides of the mixer and the walls of the bowl are clean from any dough or flour. (about 2 1/2- 3 1/2 cups) Let knead for 10-12 minutes.   Put in a lightly greased bowl and turn to coat all of the ball of bread.  Cover and let rise for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.  Punch down and form into loaves (or braid and place on greased baking sheet) and let rise again for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.  Bake for 20 - 25 minutes at 350.

The bread is AWESOME!  I add extra poppy because we love poppy.   The recipe as written is a 5 star recipe!

This bread is awesome. Kinda reminds me of a Purim bread that my DH family makes. I am making it again tonight. I also put onion flakes in it. Thanks for the memories!  Well, this time I braided it and brushed it with egg and sprinkled poppy seed over it. I let it rise again and OMG. It was perfect. In fact, I have to make it again tomorrow for step daughter and hubby.

I love the taste of this bread, but a full tablespoon of yeast is too much!  I cut it down to 2 1/4 tsp., and will try 2 tsp. next time -- it just rose too much!

Very nice bread.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine then took it out to rise and bake in the oven.  I modified it by usin 1 cup on ww flour in place of the white.  Since I don't have bread flour and I used the ww, I addded about a tablespoon of vital wheat gluten.  It rose really nicely, and really quickly.  I baked for 45 min at 375 degrees and it was perfect.  The only thing I thought could improve it was more poppy seeds, but otherwise I'm happy with this.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really tasty.  I had no milk powder, but otherwise followed the recipe.   Goes great with some ham and dijon mustard.

This was the first time I ever made bread and it's awesome!  I can't get my son to stop eating it.  I don't have a bread machine, so made the dough in my Kitchenaid mixer.  Also didn't have onion powder, so I used garlic powder instead, otherwise followed the directions. Never knew making bread was so easy.  Thanks for a great recipe! Edit: Have made this bread about 10 times now, we just love it that much.  It turns out great every time, even when I forget to add the butter (which happens about 50% of the time!).  :)
