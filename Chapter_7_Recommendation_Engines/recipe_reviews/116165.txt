Excellent!  Everyone in my family loved it.  I cooked the chicken on the stovetop in olive oil while cooking the sauce in a saucepan.  Then I stirred the sauce into the chicken and served it with cooked stir fry veggies and rice.

I thought this was delicious but I made a few changes.. I cooked the chicken and peppers w/ olive oil in a pan while the sauce was microwaving.  I poored the sauce over the chicken and added half can of crushed pinapple to make it a bit thicker.  Cover it and let it simmer for half hour.. Delicious

This was super quick and easy. I made it in the microwave just like the recipe said and it came out great even though I was missing some of the ingredients (sherry, cashews, ginger). Some of the thicker chicken strips were chewier than the thinner strips, so I would recommend slicing thin strips if you microwave it. Will definitely make again.

I liked this recipe, but I think a couple of things could have made it a five-star review: honey and a bit more salt. I think that some orange zest might really perk up the flavor, too. I reheated the leftovers we had today, and I added the honey and salt. It made it a lot more flavorful. I think the orange zest would've put it over the top!

This was excellent!  My husband and I really enjoyed it, and both agreed that I'll be making it over and over again!  I had pork that I needed to use, and I ended up stir-frying it in a pan with the peppers and some olive oil.  I heated up the "sauce" ingredients in a small pot and then poured it over the pork/peppers; simmered for about 15 mins and then served on rice.  Delish and SO easy!

Ok so i melted some butte, mixed in apricot preserves, soy sauce and a little asian chili sauce and brought that to a boil and basted a whole baked chicken with it. The result was delicious. It was very well received by all. I did serve it mashed potatoes instead of rice because i had it already prepared. Thank you for the idea!

This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't have cashews or the green pepper but I added a can of apricots, brown sugar to taste, and some pepper.  My husband really liked this.  Thanks for the idea!

We cooked on the stove instead of the microwave and added some heat to it by adding a splash of Sriracha Hot Sauce.  Very nice.

this was a big hit! I did as suggested by others and did it more as a stove top stir fry with broccolli, snow peas, and carrots added.  I also added a little orange zest. This will  for sure be added into the dinner rotation!

I followed the recipe exactly so my rating is based on the original recipe.  The estimated 10 minute prep time is way off, it took me closer to 20 minutes and that was with help.  Microwave cook time will vary, depending on your microwave's wattage.  My cook time was closer to 10 minutes than 5 minutes. The flavor was alright but didn't taste much apricot.  It's a good base from which to add other ingredients.  With additions the recipe would likely rate more stars.

This was very tasty.  I omitted the cashews since I had none and added a little salt, and didn't measure the ingredients exactly and it was still very good.  My husband and kids all loved it.  The timing was way off, though and needed probably 20-23 more minutes for four servings.

Really good. I cooked my chicken with green pepper & onions on the stove. I added the sauce without heating it first. I also used apricot/pineapple preserves so the dish tasted like sweet & sour chicken.

Almost seems like a cheat because it's so quick. Nothing better than a super-quick recipe that doesn't taste like it's super-quick.

Very good! Very quick and easy dish to make. I added peanuts vs. cashews as that's all I had on hand. For leftovers, I served over pasta and it was just as good. Thanks for sharing.

SO really liked this -- said leftovers were even better.  I went light on the green pepper, skipped the microwave, sauteed the chicken, and served with frozen oriental mixed veg.  Next time: more green pepper + red pepper + fresh ginger.

This is actually really very good. I did sub out the cashews for slivered almonds and it was great.  I too, like others, prepared mine on the stove.  Microwaved chicken just doesn't sound very appealing to me.  I gave it 4 stars because it could use a little more kick.  Next time I will add fresh ginger to see if that does the trick.  All in all, very satisfied and will definitely make it again.

Eh, these were ok. I'm biased because I've grown up in asian cuisine and I've tasted better. But if you're on the go and need something kinda tangy, this is it.

Incredibly versatile recipe. I've been using the sauce as a stir fry sauce for several months now, just using different vegetables. It's always a hit with my husband and daughter.

Simple & pretty good.  I did it in a skillet but I think I'll just use the microwave next time.  It reminds me of a simple stirfry, good to add some broccoli in.

Terrific flavor and incredibly easy and quick to make.  The sauce was a little thinner than i imagined it would be - I thought this would be more like an asian sauce, but was much thinner.  Easy to fix with a little extra cornstarch.  I also added some pineapple chunks and red pepper and served it over jasmine rice.  Yum!!  Definitely will repeat with how quick and delicious this was!!

My family really enjoyed this. I did make some changes. I added 1 1/2 T of Apple Cider Vinegar, 1 T Honey, 1/2 t Crushed Red Pepper, and 1/3 C Pineappple Juice to the sauce to make more of a marinade. I marinated the chicken strips in the marinade for an hour. I drained off the marinade reserving it. I sauted the chicken until the sauce coating the chicken started to carmelize a little. In a saucepan, I cooked the reserved marinade to kill any bacteria and to thicken it so the extra sauce could used. I sauted the veggies (red, yellow, green bell pepper, and broccoli) in another skillet until crisp-tender. Tossed in some pineapple and cashews.

Fantastic!  I forgot the chicken broth, but it was fine without it, I also added some carrots with the bell pepper and it was the finishing touch.  Added some extra color and flavor.  Definitely will make this one again

This recipe was really wonderful.  Not only was it delicious, but easy and fast to make too!  I'm not a big microwave fan though so I did cook this over the stovetop in a wok.  Everything else I kept the same and it truly came out incredible.  My husband often eats out at oriental cafe's and when he told me that this is the BEST he has ever eaten and he would pick this over any of the dishes or places that he eats out at, I knew this recipe deserved 5 stars!

I cooked the meat in a pan after mixing with the cornstarch.  Also cooked with a whole chopped pepper and an onion.  Then mixed in the remaining ingredients.  Served over rice.
Delicious!

My husband and I loved this!  I followed the recipe as written because I feel it is unfair to rate a recipe if it has been modified.  It was so easy to prepare and used a minimum of dishes and pans.  Next time I make it I will probably add mandarin oranges and broccoli as suggested.

Excellent! My husband and I devoured this! So yummy served on brown rice! Here are the changes I made to suit our preferences (to make it a bit healthier): used no sugar added apricot preserves, omitted the chicken broth/sherry, used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and added a ton of veggies (peppers, onions, carrots, green beans, water chestnuts, snap peas. The cashews in this dish really make it amazing. The sauce is so simple yet superb. Thanks for a keeper!

This was AWESOME.  It was quick and easy.  I thought the chicken would be rubbery cooking it in the microwave, but it was tender and delicious.  I ended up cooking it for an additional few minutes though, because the time indicated was not enough.

This recipe is so easy and very delicious! My variations: worcestershire sauce instead of soy, and 1/4 c. of chicken broth instead of 1 T., and added an 8 oz. can of pineapple chunks, drained.  I also used nitrate-free pre-cooked, pre-packaged chicken for the ultimate easy dish.  Also added a pinch or two of finely ground flaxseed for some extra fiber.  Served it over rice--so tasty. Everybody raved.  This is now a staple dinner in our home!

Great dish.  Didn't want to open a can of broth for a TB so I left that out.  Didn't seem to affect anything.  Added a TB of honey as other reviewers suggested and salt and pepper to taste.  Not much of a microwave cooker so I did it all on the stovetop.  Chicken and peppers in olive oil first, mixed sauce in a bowl, and simmered in the sauce for 10 - 15 minutes.  Poured everything over jasmine rice.  Really fantastic.  Thanks!

So easy and so tasty.  The cashews really take this to the next level.  My 13 year old said this was the best thing he's ever eaten.  Don't think I'd go that far, but it is definately a keeper.

Love this recipe.  We didn't have cashews so added pineapple like others suggested. It tasted just like sweet and sour chicken.  My picky toddlers ate it up. Will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe.  I used 1.5 lbs of chicken and cooked it an extra four minutes.  I added 1/2 a sweet onion chopped and a large green bell pepper. I used the sherry and the flavor was nice and light. I had almonds and just added them after it cooled as needed for each serving.  Fresh almonds are just as sweet as cashews and I did not want the extra salt.  Using fully salted Kikoman soy had enough salt for me.  It is a very good and quick recipe and will definitely make it again.

All I can say is I'm glad I doubled this recipe. I cooked it on the stovetop: browned the chicken in the oil, combined the other sauce ingredients in a bowl and poured over the chicken. Simmered for maybe 20 minutes? I didn't keep track of the time. Added a little cooked broccoli I had leftover in the fridge. Next time I will make it with orange marmalade instead of apricot jam, and I may add some pineapple. It was on the sweeter side of things, and I'd like a little more tang. Thank you for sharing!

This was easy and very good.  I too cooked the chicken in a pan to brown it up and poured the sauce over it when done.  The second time I made it, I also added onion along with the pepper.

The sauce itself tasted exactly like a storebought Orange chicken dish, but after I drizzled spicy brown mustard over top and mixed it in, and simmered the whole mix over stovetop rather than microwaving it, it was DELICIOUS!

This recipe is great!  I didn't use the microwave at all - instead sauteed the chicken with lots of veggies (broccoli, sugar snap peas, baby corn, onion, green pepper and mushrooms) and made the sauce stove top.  It was delicious and really easy.  I added red pepper flakes and asain chili sauce because we like things spicy!  Next time I'll add even more spice, it can take a lot because it's really sweet.  Served with white rice and my boyfriend ate it all and loved it.  Thanks!

This dish was delicious!  I cooked my chicken on the stove as well, while my sauce simmered in another pot. I added diced pineapples at the end and served with mixed vegetables for myself and rice for my boyfriend.  I felt like I had made an asian meal.  I will definitely be making this meal more often.

I thought this recipe was awesome!!! The only thing is that i dislike cooking anything in the microwave so i sautéed the chicken in some olive oil while i cooked the sauce in a saucepan. I threw in red green and yellow peppers and the cashews in with the chicken once it was cooked and then poured the sauce into the pan. once the peppers were cooked I poured the whole mixture over rice. It was amazing. my boyfriend loved it so i made it for my parents and they loved it! definately will be making this again

Wonderful recipe. Took others advice and used chicken broth instead of water and used 1/2 cup pineapple tidbits instead of cashews. Also added 1/2 tsp salt to make up for the salt that would have been in the cashews.  Used fresh ginger instead of the ground. I did not cook this in the microwave after reading other comments. Stir fried it instead.

I came across this exact recipe about 3 years ago in a cooking magazine. I love it, my husband loves it and now that my kids are older they love it (even the green pepper)!  The only change I make is I used fresh garlic & ginger instead of dried spices.

Fabulous.  I have to say tho, I used apricot  cake and pastry filling, as I had a can on the shelf for months/  I added a tablespoon of brown sugar as it didn't seem as sweet as the preserve..  It worked out fine.  I grilled all on an electric grill along with pieces of pinapple.  Delicous!.  Will definitely make this again.

I was expecting this recipe to be more flavorful.  It seemed that it was missing something - maybe fresh ginger and ground ginger?  Also I used low sodium soy sauce, so maybe that didn't season as well.  Added some Tabasco, and that helped a bit.  Easy to prepare though.

Hubby said he'd eat it again, but added a lot of salt and pepper. I think it needs to be spiced up a bit. I will fix again, but will 'doctor' it.

I didn't have enough apricot preserves so I added 1/4 cup apricot and 1/4 cup mango chutney.  I felt the flavor was a little flat so I added some fresh lemon zest.  This really made a big difference.  Good recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Even my husband who is not big on chicken enjoyed this. I added a can of drained pineapples chunks and some sesame seeds. I also added some stir fry veggies. Next time I will add some red pepper flakes to spice it up a little more. My husband commented that it was a nice blend. I agree. Thanks for a great recipe

This was delicious.  Just sweet enough with a little added honey.  I added shredded carrots, sugar snap peas and broccoli, served it over brown rice.  I cooked it on the stovetop and it came out great.

Very good stuff, my picky husband who doesn't particularly like chicken gobbled this down.  It was very easy, but I had to make a substitution (I think I remained true to the spirit of the recipe).  I had no apricot preserves, but I did have canned apricots.  So, I put a scant 1/2 of fruit and syrup in the blender with about 1/3 cup of white sugar and 2 tsp corn starch, to give it the thickness, like apricot jam, when it was heated. Whizzed it up until chunky and proceeded with the recipe.   I sprinkled chopped green onions on his and green onions and chopped cashews on mine. (He doesn't like nuts, so I kept them all for me.) I really enjoyed to blending of flavors.  Nice rotation in the chicken lineup.

Good recipe overall.  I made a few modifications . .  I cooked on stovetop instead of microwave, and added a 1/2 cup more chicken broth for a thinner sauce.  Adding dried chili peppers and either broccholi or snowpeas is a nice touch as well.

I made this yesterday and doubled the recipe.  Would have served only 4 doubled.  Did not microwave.  I sauteed the chicken strips in veg. oil in a skillet and added the other ingredients (less oil) when the chicken was done and cooked a few minutes longer.  Couldn't find salted cashews, so used unsalted ones.  Turned out great.  I will definitely make it again.  Also added a little water to the dish to make the sauce less thick.  Didn't hurt it at all.

I loved the flavors in this recipe but cooking it in the microwave according to the directions did not do it justice...the chicken was undercooked if I went by the instructions....next time I would cook on the stovetop.  Adding broccoli was excellent.  Also I used Simply fruit Apricot preserves with no sugar and the sauce was wonderful.

This is good.  But I prefer thighs because they have more flavor.  Chix breasts are like having Wonder bread when you could have real bread.  Yes, thighs have more fat.  It's fat that carries flavor.

Also used dried apricots soaked in a little brandy 'cuz I take a diabetic into consideration.

Very, very good!  I cooked the chicken in the skillet with the peppers and made the sauce separately, as others suggested.  Excellent and fast meal!  We will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  I cooked the chicken in a little olive oil in a wok and cooked the sauce separately, then added to the chicken. We like our food spicey, so added some Hoisin sauce and crushed red pepper to the sauce.   Served over rice with green beans - yum.  Better than any restaurant.

One of my new favorite recipes!  I used some orange pepper that was getting wrinkly, and threw it in to cook with the sauce. Then I added cooked chicken and microwaved til hot.  Served over Harvest Medley rice blend with carrots on the side for an "orange" dinner. Dee-licious!

Another rare recipe that my whole family liked. I cooked the chicken in a frypan with the green peppers and some garlic I didn't add the tablespoon of chicken broth as Ididn't want to open a can just for that. It tasted great. Made with a brown rice and my family asked if I'd make it the next day again.

I give this recipe 4 stars because I had to doctor the sauce and add some spice to the chicken.  The soy sauce seems to overpower the sauce.  I added about another tablespoon of apricot and some pineapple with the juice.  I added just enough until I reached the flavor I liked.  I spiced the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic salt.  I did it on the stove top and it was wonderful.  It tasted like takeout.  Thanks.

This dish was excellent.  My husband couldn't believe the chicken was cooked in the microwave!  My 16 month old loved it too.  I did make a few changes as the author suggested- I used frozen stir-fry veggies and added some mandarin oranges, I also omitted the nuts because I didn't have any. And this was so good- there were no leftovers!

This is an update.  I made the recipe as written today, in that I didn't add pineapple and broccoli as I had before.  I did add some red pepper flakes and cooked it on the stove.  It was much better this way.  I think the pineapple may have added too much sweetness, or at least toned down any zing the original recipe had.  The addition of that little bit of red pepper flakes was enough.
Original review:
I'm wondering if I missed something because it tasted rather bland. I thought it could have used some red pepper. I cooked it on the stove and followed the recipe with the addition of broccoli and pineapple as had been suggested.  Even after adding salt and pepper, it just didn't do it for me.

I have to admit, I expected this to be terrible.  I'm not a fan of microwaved meat - at all.  But since I have a policy of making recipes as written the first time, and since this one had so many good reviews, I tried it anyway.  Pleasantly surprised!  I forgot to cover for the first 3 minutes, but covered in plastic wrap for the last round of cooking and added an additional minute to the cook time to compensate for my earlier mistake.  The chicken wasn't rubbery or dry at all.  I'm sure it would be better cooked on the stove, but this was definitely easier and required less washing-up afterward.  I did add a pinch of red pepper flakes and a snack-sized container of pineapple tidbits, as well as using an orange bell pepper instead of green, but otherwise used all ingredients as listed.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe, but like others, I didn't want to cook it in the microwave.  I used my wok, cooking the chicken in a little olive oil and then I added broccoli instead of peppers and I also added a little chopped onion.  While that was cooking, I mixed the sauce and then added it to the wok for the last few minutes to let it get thick.   This was EXCELLENT! I didn't have any cashews, so I made it without, but would like to try them in the future.  I will make it again and again, I am thinking about adding a little red pepper flakes next time.

Very delicious recipe. I didn't realize it was a microwave cooked recipe. Since I don't generally cook whole meals in the microwave I made this dish in a skillet instead and I added 1/2 cup chicken broth for added sauce.  Came out great, will definitely make again. Thanks Vicki

Awesome!!  I did omit the chicken broth, but didn't notice any change.  Browned the meat in 2T olive oil to cook through, then added sauce, peppers and cashews to heat.  Resulted in some nice carmelizing on the chicken.  My family LOVED it.

Very tasty. I also fried the chicken separately. I added more Sherry and used toasted almonds

This was ok.  I added chili paste to spice it up some since the overall flavor was a little lackluster.  I cooked mine over a stovetop.  This is great if you're short on time, but I'd recommend marinating the chicken in the sauce if you have extra time to spare before serving.

My friend can't believe I can successfully cook chicken in a microwave.  This is so good, it has become one of our regulars.
