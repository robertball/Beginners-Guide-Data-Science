I agree with Trusty754. This is absolutely NOT clotted cream. Clotted cream is made with unpasturized milk, not easily available in the US. And, it is NOT sweet. An accceptable alternative is to cook 2 cups heavy cream in top of double boiler over simmering water until reduced by half. It will be the consistency of butter, with a crust on top. Pour all, including crust into a bowl, cover and let stand 2 hours. Then, refrigerate 12 hours or more. Stir crust into the cream before serving.

I have made this recipe several times, and with each making I loved it.  I have however tweaked it somewhat.  The first time I followed the instructions to the letter and found it tasty but not as firm as the clotted cream I had in London..  So the second time I made it I seperated the sour cream.  (Dump your sour cream in a strainer lined with cheese cloth or a coffee filter, cover with plastic wrap – so that it touches the sour cream – place over a bowl and refrigerate overnight.)

This second attempt was perfect.  However when I made it last week a disaster 5 minutes before company came (my whipped cream got coffee grounds dumped on it) forced me to use --- yes you guessed it…. Cool Whip.  I must confess I liked this version the best.  I’m so ashamed and plan to never tell my mother that I used Cool Whip.

Three days before I made this, I had been to tea at the Plaza Hotel in NYC.  This was remarkably similar to the Devonshire cream they served with their scones!  Excellent and so easy.....also very impressive served with fresh berries.

I found a recipe like this last year but it was called Mock Clotted Cream, which would be a more acceptable title for the purists out there commenting it's not clotted cream.  Even though it is not true clotted cream, it did go well with lemon curd and scones.

I use this recipe every time I have a tea party. It's very good and very simple to make. You can easily adjust to you own liking as far as sweetness goes and I've experimented with it by adding a little Maple flavoring~yummy.

While this may not be the true clotted cream, it is a great substitue!!! It goes well with the scones. I did not find the recipe too sweet either. Thanks for a great recipe!!

So big deal, not authentic clotted cream but still tasty and great to have on hand.  I added a wee bit of green food coloring today and will serve it atop my St. Patricks Day cherry mousse.

this is a good recipe, however, i have never had clotted cream or made it before, so i don't have anything to compare it to, but i liked it. i made along with the Grandma Johnson's Scones recipe on this site. Note, if you have never worked with heavy whipping cream, be careful not to over beat it.

I was very pleased to find this recipe!  While this is not exactly the same as Devon or real clotted cream, it is *fabulous* as a topping on scones.  Try it! MMmmmm

If there was a no star option I would have used it, this is a terrible recipe. It's not even close the to clotted cream I've had at so many high teas overseas where the real thing is as common as butter here!  Make it REAL thing or buy it. Which I have done and it's authentic as can be!

All right, this is not authentic clotted cream, so the name might need some quotation marks.  But if you don't feel like double-boiling heavy cream and letting it clot, then this is a quick and similarly tasty alternative!  Love this when I get cream tea cravings and can't get the real stuff... thanks for the recipe!

Definitely not clotted cream, it tastes more like whipped cream than anything. It was tasty, but it might be closer if the sugar was omitted. This is definitely easy to make and like I said, tasty, so it's definitely worth giving it a shot. It has a nice tangy flavor from the sour cream that you won't get from standard whipped cream.

Having recently returned from England, this isn't actual clotted cream but very tasty anyway. It says in the description "substitute"!

This is to clotted cream what Cool Whip is to real home made whipped cream.  Too floppy, too sweet-and-sour.

Always a complainer somewhere.  Anyway, I researched clotted cream after viewing a recipe for an English Summer Pudding with clotted cream to accompany it.  Frankly, your mock clotted cream sounds really good.  The real thing, though, sounds awful.  I will use your recipe instead.

This was really good ..... I brought it to work and added a dollop onto the Irish Cream Coffee Cake, and both were terrific hits!  I would make this again. Make sure you whip the cream until it's REALLY stiff. (For those who were complaining that it isn't "real" clotted cream, please read the first line in the original listing ..."A tasty ALTERNATIVE to the real thing."  The author plainly indictated it was an 'alternative'.)

Having never had real Devon, I can't compare this recipe to the real stuff but, this was a delight to make and tasted great on scones with a dollop of lemon curd.  I was a little concerned that my clotted cream was going to be a little on the runny side however it did firm up quite nice with a little time in the fridge.

I liked it! I have had the real before but this is not a bad substitute! In fact I served it to 3 scone "novices" and they all thought the jam & cream thing was great! BTW all 3 never had a scone but always wanted to try one! I would definitely make it again!

This was NOT clotted cream...the name of this recipe is misleading. Clotted cream isn't sweetened and is closer in consistancy to butter that melts in your mouth. Very dissapointing.

This was everything the recipe said it was.
Easy, alternative to the real thing. Does anyone have a recipe for the real thing?
I have made this for a tea party, for an event at work and today for Easter.  I have had many compliments and request for the recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

while this may not be actual clotted cream, it is a simple, pleasant alternative.  We have fun tea parties in our family, with everyone (adults too) dressing up and enjoying some girly time.  This is an easy topping to add to our homemade scones that does not take too much time away from the fun.

So good. I lived in Chiangmai, Thailand , so it is hard to find commercial clotted cream. The method to make is also easy. I made it  for Parent Coffee morning , got a lot of compliments!

I had a craving for Cream Tea but I'm a lazy cook!!  Found a recipe for drop scones that came out delicious.  Tried to purchase clotted cream but I couldn't find it so I tried this recipe.  Seeing as I haven't had clotted cream in a while, can't remember what it tastes like.  But this recipe was delicious!!!!!!  Highly recommend it!!!!!

This is not clotted cream. This is Whipped Cream. Clotted cream is cream thickened by separating the curd from the whey. I like this as whipped cream but suggest adding brown and powder sugar.

Look this is tasty, but it's nowhere near what I used to eat in the UK.  Real clotted cream is basically reduced double cream (also known as whipped cream here in North America). I would not recommend this for someone wanting real clotted cream.

I love the recipe.. of course I had to tweak it.. I have started adding more Powder sugar then what it calls for, to make it sweeter. It seems more of a whipped cream recipe than a clotted cream recipe, but it is still very good with fruit & chocolate!!

This really isn't clotted cream. It's a tasty topping for warm scones, but it's just not very "authentic" tasting. I might make it again, but not when I'm craving a taste of England, because it just didn't do the trick.

I've never had clotted cream before so I was not sure what it was supposed to taste like.  I ate it with Grandma Johnsons Scone recipe... and it was okay.  I probably won't make it again.

First of all, a lot of the reviews on this seem incredibly harsh. I have had many types of "real" clotted cream and Devonshire (which is not exactly the same as clotted cream), and no it isn't exactly the same thing. However, at least where I live, it is close to impossible to obtain true forms of either, although if you are in my situation, you can pay quite a pretty penny to order it thru Amazon.
Moving on, no this isn't true clotted cream, but that being said, in my humble opinion, I found this to be delicious on scones with preserves, and while sweeter, it is closer to a Devonshire cream, without having to go through the process of double boilers, seperating, etc.
I am appreciative of the contributed recipe.

It was delicious and went well with my scones and jam. Was a little less thick than real clotted cream, but still very tasty. Considering this only takes about 10mins to whip up vs the 20hrs real clotted cream takes, it's fantastic and I'll deffinitely make it again.

This is NOT clotted cream. It's whipped cream with less sugar and some sour cream to add a tang. It's very good, but is nowhere close to real clotted cream. I've made it several times and prefer it with less sugar (I usually use 1-2 tsp instead).
