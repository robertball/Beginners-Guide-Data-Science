This was a good, hearty bread.  If you do not have self-rising flour, you can add 2 tsp baking powder and 3/4 tsp salt to regular flour.  I do not have a cast iron skillet, so I just made this in an 8x8 metal baking dish.  I couldn't really taste the cheese or the dill - this bread doesn't have strong flavors.  But served with honey it was still darn good!

Pretty good, super easy, it was a little bland for my taste, i would have liked it with a little garlic and spices.  Also, mine did not rise very high.  Overall it was good.

For a bread that is made without yeast, this bread is amazingly like a yeast bread. It was like a cross between a cheese biscuit and yeast bread, with a nice crunchy crust. The only changes I made were to leave out the onion powder and to use 1/2 cup shredded cheese instead of cubed. I drizzled the batter with 2 tablespoons melted butter mixed with 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and let the dough sit in the pan for about 15 minutes prior to baking. I used JW Dundee's Honey Brown lager. Very nice and quick change of pace!

Top is very hard. I thought the bread would be dry. Actually, the bread was moist and had wonderful flavor. This is a very dense heavy bread. Not a pretty piece but very tasty for a home meal.

This has a good flavor, but the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Because of being cooked in a cast iron skillet, not only is there a bottom crust (good) but the top of this bread is hard and crunchy also due to the nature of beer bread, and that's not so good. I even buttered the top of my bread with melted butter before baking, and still wound up with a hard (though tasty) crust. I did like the addition of dill, because I'm always looking for an excuse to use more of that, but overall, cook this one in a standard loaf pan, so that there's less surface area of the hard top crust to contend with. (It'll fit.) The cheese was lost in this recipe; you need to either add more, use a harder cheese, or omit it and serve slices of cheese on the side, because 4 oz. cubed cannot be tasted in the end product (and adds another dimension to the whole chewy-crunchy-edges thing on all sides). Thanks, Mark, for a tasty beer bread that I can easily adjust to be perfect for my family's tastes!

Good! Like Grannyloohoo I put butter on top of mine. The top is still super crunchy which I don't like that much. I added granulated garlic. I like the cheese in chunks. Used a good amber ale. Really easy. Thanks!

This is my daughters favorite.  It is a dense bread.  I've had a few different types of beer bread and all of them have been dense.  Maybe there is a "fluffy" beer bread recipe floating around out there.  I haven't found it.  Whenever my daughter asks for beer bread, this is the recipe she's asking for.  I do always add more cheese and dill when I make this and serve it with butter on top.

I made my own self rising flour. This needed four more ounces of beer than what was called for. I melted 1/4 cup of butter and poured it over the top before baking. This took just over an hour to bake IN A GLASS PYREX BREAD PAN. This was just okay. Two of us loved it, the other two didn't care for it. My oldest said it needed more cheese. NOTE: If you bake this with the butter on top, make sure you put a pan underneath to catch the drips from the pan. Otherwise, you'll have one heck of a mess on your hands. Trust me.

Love this bread. Hardest part is having a beer at room temperature.  I drink mine frosty cold.

I didn't enjoy this bread.  It might have been the beer that I chose though.  I will try it again with a better beer.

Made a couple of changes...added 1 T of dill and 2 T dehydrated onion flakes.  So easy and fast recipe...taste awesome with hot veggie soup on a cold night.
