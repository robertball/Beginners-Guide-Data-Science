I had never tasted a steak that was anything like this before. It still has strong steak flavor but the ingredients that go with it just don't make it amazing. I wasn't a fan but my husband loves steak and appreciates any steak put on the table.

Mixed reviews. It was ok. Had sort of a strange flavor. Not as sweet as I woulda thought. The marinade stayed inside the parchment nicely. The steak took a while to trim. I did not make the horsey sauce. I thought it was ok, I ended up eating it on a tortilla w salsa and cheese. My husband liked it as is and our 9yr old added ketchup. 4 year old doesn't like much so no surprises there.

This was really good. it will play well as an appetizer or finger food at a party. It went well as a main dish at dinner. Definitely make the horseradish sauce to go with it.  While the sweetness from the honey was subtle, it was noticeable.  For my 16 year old son, it was too sweet, for the highly sensitive to sweet me, I barely noticed it. Left overs were good with eggs the next morning.
