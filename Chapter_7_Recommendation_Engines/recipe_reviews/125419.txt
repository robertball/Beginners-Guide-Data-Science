I was excited to try this recipe, since it is hard to find the dark bran recipe, and although I wasn’t blown away, they were not a disappointment.  I did make some changes: I substituted the buttermilk with plain yogurt, the white sugar for brown, and shortening for margarine (trying to make them even more healthy). I also opted for blueberries rather than the raisins.  I loved how moist they were inside, with a nice crust on top, and they expanded really nicely.  I did think that the molasses taste was a little strong for me, and I like molasses, but after serving them at my 2 ½ year old’s play date, both the kids and moms really liked the flavour.  I think next time I will half the molasses and put some applesauce in and see how it works.  Definitely a great, high-fiber snack for kids and adults alike!

HOLY YUMTASTIC!!!!
By far the best bran muffin I've ever had, will need to be buying bran by the truckload now haha.  I actually omitted the sugar and oil, and added in a shredded apple to make up for it in terms of moistness.  They were fantastically moist and tasty.  Will make again and again.

I am really enjoying this for the second time - right now! I used spelt bran; let any bran soak for a few minutes in the bowl of wet ingredients so it's nice and moist coming out of the oven. I also used a buttermilk/yogurt combo, and a healthy oil because I hate measuring solid shortening. If you are not a bran muffin purist (mine is in a loaf), I recommend adding an additional cup of dried fruit (apricots, prunes) and nuts. Oh, and I like molasses so I increased to 1/3 cup. Good!

It was nice to find a recipe that didn't call for bran ceral. I am following a low GI diet so I made a few changes and the muffins came out great! First I changed the all-purpose flour to whole wheat flour, I also used 1 cup oat bran and 1 1/2 cups wheat bran, I changed the shortening to heart healthy canola oil and the sugar to splenda. I increased the baking soda to 2 teaspoons and the buttermilk to 1 3/4 cups. I also added 1t of vanilla, 1t of cinnamon, 1/2t ginger, clove, nutmeg. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Even though I made so many changes it was a great starter recipe! I will be using it in the future. Thanks!

a great start to a recipe. I solved the dryness problem that was encountered by so many reviewers by substituting one 16-ounce can of pumpkin for the equivalent volume of buttermilk, and they were extremely moist. Also I used oat flour and doubled the molasses and tossed in 1/3 cup of bittersweet chocolate mini-chips. Yummy!

These turned out great!  Being on the healthy and frugal side here is the substitution I made instead of using white sugar and molases:  I had in the fridge some "fiber bomb"* (I'll post recipe right away) which is dried fruit simmered in plain water until they turn syrupy.  I measured the fruit syrup to 3/4 cup and chopped 1/2 cup of the fruit right on the dry ingredients and tossed (or they would drop to the bottoms of the muffins during baking). Healthfully fruity and moistly dark.

OMG! These are the best Bran muffins I've ever made or eaten for that matter.
I used black strap molasses and these bad boys are so moist and delicious even my picky husband went bonkers for these.
I made a batch with copies of the recipe to hand samples out to family and friends.

These are, hands down, the best wheat bran muffins i've tried by far. And trust me, I've tried my fair share of bran muffins. I actually used the same amount of mashed banana in place of the shortening, cause I didn't have any shortening. But seriously. These are AMAZING. And healthy! Try it! :)

Awesome!  I used whole wheat, millet and oat flours in place of the all purpose flour.  Left out the white sugar (with the raisins, plenty sweet enough for me) and used coconut oil in place of the vegetable shortening.  Deep, Dark and Wholesome - love it!

I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time and so happy to now have one that is PERFECT! These are exceptional. Rich in bran and good 'ole fashioned wholesomeness. Wow! I like the flavor of molasses so I used brown sugar instead of white and sub'd out 1/2 cup of regular flour for white whole wheat and used coconut oil instead of shortening (same idea they both are solid fats). I made half the recipe and used a lightley greased 8" cake pan then served sliced in wedges. I know I will be making this recipe often. Thanks LorrieT1 for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I doubled the recipe the first time I made it and as I was chopping raisins and remembering how much work it is to bake from scratch, I thought, "boy, these better be worth it." ...and they ARE worth it! I didn't adjust for altitude (because I don't know how), so I don't think they are as high as they should be, but they are moist and delicious with a wee pat of butter, warm out of the oven.  Will definitely make these again and I might put in more raisins next time. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I've tried 4 bran muffin recipes in the past 4 days and this is our favourite.  Moist, great flavour, and healthy bran fiber!  I used vegetable oil instead of melted shortening and fresh blueberries instead of the raisins.  Thanks for posting!  I will be making this again and again.

Not quite enough flavor yet but with some simple adjustments I'm pretty sure this can be a 5 star recipe (less salt, more fruit - apples seem like a good idea, some whole wheat flour). Worth playing with as the bran and molasses combo are exactly what I've been looking for.

Excellent!  Used 1/2 c applesauce with 1 c plain nonfat yogurt instead of buttermilk.  Next time will add nuts.  Not dry at all. Also baked as a loaf for 1 hr.

This recipe is terrific. A hearty, good-for-you muffin.  I substitute 1/2 cup honey for the sugar and for the flour I use half white, half whole wheat.  Then I toss in some chopped walnuts along with the raisins.  YUM!

I like the flavor of these muffins. Since we always spread margarine over the top anyways, I did not think that being too dry was an issue.

These were just what I was looking for, I used to make a similar muffin but misplaced the recipe. I don't have veg. shortening so used a combination of safflower and coconut oils - I poured in a quarter cup before I realized my mistake, no harm done as far as I can tell. Great recipe, thanks!

Made with the following changes:  substituted brown sugar for white, replaced oil with 1/2 cup applesauce, and substituted 3 egg whites for two whole eggs.  Plumped raisins in boiling water (rather than chopped).  I soaked the bran in the buttermilk for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the wet ingredients, and the muffins were very moist.  Next time, I'm going to try reducing the sugar by half.    Fantastic!

These were absolutely delicious...followed the recipe and added some cardamom, nutmeg, and allspice to give it a bit of sweet spiciness.  They are moist and have great texture. Saved the recipe and will be a favorite in our household.  Thanks!

I thought these were wonderful.  Some reviewers commented that theirs were dry.  I didn't think they were dry at all.  I did use honey rather than molasses, just because I didn't have any molasses on hand.  Maybe that's why they were a little moister?  The kids even loved them.  These taste a lot like the bran muffins my grandmother made when I was little but not as dense.  I will be making these again soon.  Maybe real soon if my kids keep eating them!

Great recipe! My only changes were to use brown sugar for the white, since I love the flavor blend with the buttermilk.  I did not have any molasses, so subbed in real maple syrup. I used 1/4 cup canola oil, so as not to have to melt anything.  Also, back in the day that this recipe originated, it is likely that low fat buttermilk did not exist.  I used 'Bulgarian' buttermilk--it is not low fat, and gave a very nice crumb. These turned out like a bakery bran muffin. Yes, the fat content is higher, but variety and all things in moderation. This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for. These will become a staple in my freezer.

used blueberries - tastes better than I expected. With so little sugar and no vanilla called for I was worried they would be  bland muffins, not as dark as I expected-no where near the picture. A little dry. Would make again but would soak the bran in the buttermilk to try to make them a little more moist

A nice bran muffin. I wished it was a bit sticky though. I thought the molasses might achieve that. Next time i will use whole wheat flour and brown sugar like a few of the others. I will keep this recipe but will go on searching for a gooey moist bran muffin.

I doubled this recipe and it yielded 33 muffins.   I followed the recipe precisely and love that they're dark in color as opposed to other bran muffin recipes I've made.  After tasting these, I think a bit less salt would have been just as fine.  Next time...

Delicious! I did not have milk so I took another reviewer's suggestion and replaced it with pumpkin puree.  Very moist and wonderful molasses flavor (I used black strap).

Good, old school bran muffins! 4 yr old said "They taste like REAL muffins!" and I agree - unlike store bought "cake" muffins, they are dry, which we loved. Had no molasses on hand so added a bit of brown sugar, used 1c buttermilk and 1/2c applesauce, and coconut oil instead of shortening. Also used 1c frozen blueberries instead of raisins - added to dry ingredients to prevent colour bleeding. The kids devoured them!  Thanks for sharing LorrieT1!

A nice muffin to go with your morning coffee, or tea.I used coconut milk(lactose) and Kelloggs all Bran, did not add raisins to these and I found the molasses flavor a bit strong, but i will make these again. Thank you for the recipe.

A delicious recipe that is easy to customize to your liking!

Here are the changes I made:

subbed coconut oil for vegetable shortening
subbed crushed bran cereal for bran (couldn't track any down!)
subbed dried, sweetened cherries for raisins
added roughly chopped walnuts
baked in two small loaves instead of muffins

These freeze and reheat well, they are delicious and even though they are healthy they taste decadent!

these are fantastic! Only thing I did different was to sub 1/2 vanilla flavored yogurt (Danone) and 1 c milk for the buttermilk (since i did not have buttermilk). Yummy! Will make again for sure!

This recipe made the best bran muffins, by far, that have ever come out of my kitchen! I followed the recipe exactly, with the one small exception of soaking the raisins in a little hot water cause I like 'em  juicy. The muffins are super moist, loaded with flavor, and have a huge amt. of bran in them. If you're a bran muffin lover, look no further than this recipe. They are perfect! Thanks, Lorri, for sharing your recipe!

I made these as directed, the bran cereal is a little dry and hard in the muffin. I plan to soak the bran cereal in buttermilk first then mix with the other ingredients next time.

These muffins turned out great!  Not having any shortening I used the same amount of coconut oil (melted).  I also substituted craisins for the plain raisins which added an amazing flavour.  I will definitely make these again.

Absolutely loved these! Like others I switched out the white sugar for brown. Since I don't use buttermilk, I used clabbered milk. Worked out great..I also added 1 tsp each vanilla and cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp each cloves, and nutmeg. My partner usually can't stand bran muffins but she loved these!  Definitely a keeper... will add photo later

I followed recipe exactly and used a food scale and the metric measurements.  I loved the flavor and the amount of sweetness was just right!  But they were really dry and didn't rise very much. :(  Next time, I will add grated carrots or canned pumpkin or maybe more buttermilk.

Its so good I made it about three times in one week and Everyone loved them. 
Recipe changes I made were - I added lots of cinnamon for extra flavor and 2 teaspoons of vanilla essence for more complexity in the flavor. 
The second time I added a cup of oats as well and it still turned out amazing and the third time I added 2 cups of finely grated carrots and chopped nuts instead of raisins which made the best muffins my family has had in years. 
This recipe is very forgiving and very easy to work with and it allows you to personalize it in whichever way you like. Im keeping it as my go to for dark muffins.

Dry even w a cup of applesauce. Low rise. Taste good. Won’t make them twice. Since they are made with buttermilk and soda I see no reason they could not be the six week type bran muffins.

This recipe is the real deal.  When I was young, the office I worked in had a little hole in the wall restaurant in the basement called Stella D.  We all put in our order for a nice piping hot bran muffin that they made fresh every day.  We called them the Stella D muffin.  The restaurant closed over time and I had ever so much wanted to eat those muffins again most of my life but didn't have the recipe.  This is virtually the same taste and texture of that muffin.  I found it, now my life is complete.  LOL . Thank you so much for the post.  I bought the wheat bran from the Canadian Bulk Barn stores and it was labelled White wheat bran.

Excellent recipe.  Moist and great tasting.  I followed the suggestions of using brown sugar and coconut oil for a slightly healthier recipe.  I soaked my bran in the buttermilk for 10 minutes. And I also soaked my raisins first to plump them- no chopping required and I used a full cup of them-delish!!  Definitely a recipe I will continue to use. Thanks for sharing!!!

I love these muffins. They taste like the Tim Horton’s Raisin Bran muffins (no longer sold). I add a bit more molasses than the recipe calls for, just to suit my personal taste.

Have followed the recipe in the past, but needed to make it non-dairy so :1 and half cups of orange juice instead of buttermilk. I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose and threw in a leftover half cup of pumpkin purée. Batter was a bit looser than usual, but the juice brought a softer texture and added flavor.

Made these and subbed in a few ingredients just because of what we had on hand.  Used almond milk for the buttermilk, used canola oil and added a few tablespoons of applesauce as I needed to use it up. These muffins are great!  Didn't take long and quick clean up.  I am sure this recipe can be customized to people's preferences as long as you keep the wet / dry ratio somewhat in tact.  I will be making these again as I am pretty sure the batch I made won't last long.  Also, I filled the muffin tins pretty high because I wanted larger muffins...they puffed up well but didn't run into each other so 12 it is for me moving forward.  Thank you for a great old school muffin recipe!

I made changes such as I used yogurt instead of buttermilk, I used half applesauce and half butter for oil, I didn't use molasses, I used raw sugar to sweeten and I used blueberries instead of raisins. Next time I want to add more blueberries. It was sweet enough for me. I don't like real sweet things. I will do this recipe again and tweak until it's just perfect for me.

Really awesome muffins. Will definitely make them again. Used dried cranberries instead of raisins, wonderful way to get your fiber.

These were fabulous! Did a little tinkering for fun experimenting. I added extra molasses  and orange zest and cinnamon and half cup more of buttermilk. Awesome! They were very light and moist. Thanks so much for this recipe. It will be handed down for generations to come!

Really great flavor but could've been a tad moister.  However I did alter the recipe a bit to try to make less dry after reading some of the reviews. Used 1/4 cup melted butter instead of shortening, used oat and wheat bran, a little more molasses and chopped dates. Perhaps I just baked them a little too long or the dates may have been a but dry.  I will definitely make again and use soaked raisins and watch the baking time closely. But still got lots of compliments on these and love the old time flavor and texture.

I was looking for a bran morning glory muffin but couldn't find one so I changed this recipe. I used brown sugar instead of white, I added 1/4c shredded coconut, 1c grated carrots and a 1/4c pumpkin seeds. I used 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder and added a 1/4c of milk. They turned out great!

I'm so happy -- these are the bran muffins I've been dreaming about for years, but could never find. I did make a couple of changes, only so that I wouldn't have to run to the store. I used whole wheat flour, and came up short so rounded it out with a little ground almond meal. Used coconut oil instead of melted shortening. The whole wheat flour didn't make them heavy. They were great. Thank you, thank you, Lorrie T!!!  By the way, heart-healthy people -- go ahead and use buttermilk! It's not like you're drinking a cup and half of the stuff -- it's spread out over many muffins and gives them such great texture and flavor.

I live this recipe.  It has the richness from the molasses that I haven't found in many other recipes!  I made it as is and it turned out great.

I love this recipe!  I make giant muffins the recipe is perfect for 6 giant muffins. I just add 5 minutes to the bake time.
I also add some spices for a little extra flavor. Cinnamon,  nutmeg, and cloves.
Delicious!

I did increase the molasses bit and omit the sugar and add vanilla but otherwise I thought this recipe was really delicious. I do not like my muffin sweet at all hence the omissions. This is one of the best muffin recipes I have found in quite a while.

This was my second time making these terrific, rich in fiber muffins.  First time, used all ingredients but substituted raisins for shredded carrots and added chopped walnuts. Also changed bran to rolled oats.  They were delicious! Second time, added chopped almonds, shredded carrots instead of raisins, and shredded coconut.  Also increased white sugar from 1/2 cup to 1 cup; we seem to like our muffins more to the sweeter side. Rolled oats instead of bran. Whatever you choose to add is great...been looking for a muffin that has more oats than flour. Even looks like a muffin you'd buy in a bakery.  Thank you!!

I made a few changes. I used fat free sour cream instead of buttermilk, found them a dryer than I expected, this may be the reason I used brown sugar instead of white.  Also used dates and walnuts, no raisans.
