I have never left  a review on anything, but MAN these peas were  that good.  I used the recipe as written  except I halfed it can only cooked it 4 hours due to less ingrediants and they were amazing! We lost my grandad this past year and it was his new years peas we gathered around every year, now my family has elected me to carry on that tradition! They were that good! :)

Made these again this year.  I only substituted the chicken bouillon for beef.  Because chickens and other fowl move backward as they eat, that's not want you want for the new year. :0)

This is a really great recipe.  I halved it. Really flavorful not too salty.  I had already fried some bacon so I just cut up 6 strips of bacon and added them to the peas and I added 2 tbsp of unsalted butter since I did not have any bacon grease left.  I microwaved the bacon.  Did not add salt only pepper. I thought 4 bullion cubes would be too much but they were perfectly seasoned. Use vidalia onions or a peru sweet onion for more flavor. For the ham I used left over honey baked ham and removed the honey rind and fat. I think I simmered only about six hours but they were a nice soft consistency.  A keeper!!!

My whole life we have always been made to eat black eyed peas on New Years day, and I have always hated them!  My parents would always just open a can of black eyed peas, heat them in the microwave and serve.. it's no wonder I hated them!  So I decided to make these peas and now I must say that I love black eyed peas!!  This recipe was awesome, the only changes I made was to cut it in half (I was only feeding 2.5 people so we didn't need a lot) I used 12 oz. of bacon because I didn't want to use just a partial package and I added a bit of garlic.  I also cooked it in the crock pot on low for 4 hours and then on high for 4 hours.  My husband even took these to have as a meal at work the next day.  I will never go back to canned black eyed peas again :)

Very tasty.  I made some variations, only because I cook with what i have on hand.  Didn't have bacon but used bacon grease.  Also sauteed some carrots, celery and garlic with the onions and sprinkled very little hot pepper in (more for flavor, not enough to make it hot).  My two year old even ate it!

Born and raised in North Georgia into a family of real good Cooks. These are the best Black Eyed Peas I have ever eaten. Don't change the recipe at all...it's perfect. A bowl of peas, with a dollop of home made chow-chow and a big slice of cornbread and you have the perfect meal. Just fabulous.

Holy wow this was fantastic. The only difference is I didn't start the night before so I boiled the BEPs then let it soak for 4 hours. Changed the water and followed the rest of the recipe as instructed. This recipe was the bomb!!!! Takes a bit of work and effort but totally worth it. So good you won't want to share!!!

I'm a Northerner living in the south.  It's pretty much mandatory that you make a pot of black eyed peas for New Years Day.  I've tasted others black eyes peas to utter distain.  My husband asked if I would make a pot this year as we are having company over today for New Years.  I found this recipe and followed the directions to the letter.  This recipe makes Black Eyed Peas taste great!  Everyone loved them.  Thanks For posting this great recipe!

Amazing! I was afraid of black eyed peas until this recipe!  I'm pretty good at pinto beans, butterbeans and awesome at black beans, but was never able to make a good tasting pot of black eyes peas. Until now thanks to this recipe!!!! Happy New Year! Now let me see if I can master some collard greens!

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  This is simply outstanding.  And this, coming from someone that does not like black eyed peas.  For being so simple, it amazed us.  I halved the recipe as there is only 2 of us.  So I cooked it in the slow cooker.  One hour on high and 3 hours on low....done perfectly.  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe.  UPDATE: 1/2/2017 This is my 3rd year in a row, making this dish for New Year's day and still cannot say enough great things about these peas/ham combination.   It may look very "simple" but it is just bursting with flavor.  :)

I fixed this on New Year's Day and it was sooo good.  Cooking the bacon and then the onions and then adding it to the beans made them so flavorful.  The only change I made was I used chicken stock in place of the water and bouillon cubes.  This is a keeper!

This is the first time I've ever had black eyed peas that I liked. Very tasty. I cooked them for 6 hours on low in the slow cooker. The only change I would make next time is to add the bacon much later in the cooking process so it doesn't cook all the flavor out of it.

Fantastic & easy. Put everything in the crockpot this morning (cooked on low for 10 hrs). I did add chopped carrots and celery, 1/2 cup each.

Peas have a subtle flavor all their own and are best enjoyed without spices that take away from that flavor.  Cover peas in water and add salt as if you were salting them on your plate.  Add sliced dry salt meat or smoked pig knuckles.  Bring to a boil in a covered pot and reduce heat to a slow simmer.  After simmering for one hour, remove the lid and increase heat to bring it back to a simmer for 30 minutes.  This is very important to allow the liquid to develop the color and rich flavor that really takes this dish from the mundane to the richness that takes it to the level of a culinary masterpiece.  Forget all the herbs for this dish.  It is so much more delicious without them.

Absolutely the best black eyed peas I have ever made or eaten!!  I halved the recipe, using chicken broth rather than icky bouillion cubes.  Cook time was 3-4 hours.  DO NOT hesitate to have leftovers.  This concoction gets even better as it sits in the fridge.

Wonderful! I served it with rice. The only tiny change I made was the fact that I substituted 1/2 black beans as I didn't have enough peas on hand. It made its own nice thick gravy that was the best with rice! Great cold day meal.

Very, very good.  This a good recipe for your friends or family that claim they don't like Black Eyed Peas.  Every time I make this dish, it's gone by the next day.  I always make 1/2 of the recipe, 2 lbs. of beans  is a lot.

I had to hard boil my peas because I didn't have to let them soak.  I'm pretty sure I didn't change anything because this would be about the second time I have made blackeyed peas.  This recipe was the best blackeyed peas I've ever had.  My momma would have been proud.  I found myself craving them and ate them for breakfast they were so good.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Made this as it was written with the exception of amount.  (1.5 X original recipe).  We had 40 people at a potluck, so I figured that would be the right amount as a side dish.  In the end, this made a LOT of black eyed peas!  2 crock pots filled to the brim worth.  My only warning would be that the 16 servings this recipe is for is for some hungry folks!!   As far as the food itself goes... excellent.  This is going to be my go to for BEP's from now on, hands down.

Im new to this website but I love LOVE love it already. I originally was just browsing through NYE lucky meals and since i just moved into my own place i felt like why not bring in the new year right? SO i searched for a black eyed pea recipe and what ya know? Dave's recipe popped up and boy am i glad!!!! Im extremely happy with the success of this recipe. although i tweaked it a bit,it tastes amazing. Instead of water i used beef broth and instead of actual bacon i used Pork Hog jowl.i put everything in the crock pot last night at about 7:30 and woke up this morning at about 8 and they are better than my grandmothers peas!!!! thanks Dave for this awesome recipe! Happy New Years Folks

The only change I made was adding some finely chopped carrots when saluting the onions. Other than that they were great. I live at a higher altitude than most so I needed to add an additional hour at low in my crockpot for a total of one hour at high and 4 hours at low. Great with cornbread!

OMG these beans are so good. Everyone in my family enjoyed them. I used salt pork instead of the bacon. This made enough for 2 meals. Definitely will be making more. A great recipe for beans if you or your family don’t like them a little sweet. These beans definitely don’t need sweetness from molasses. Etc. I cooked them in a pot on the stove instead.

This is one of the best recipes on here! Don’t change a thing in the ingredients, but it does make a lot so you may want to halve it if you don’t have a crowd. I chop the bacon before I fry it so it’ll all fit in the pan at once and I don’t have to crumble afterwards.

These were really good. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I added a green pepper and some red pepper flakes. Also, I used chicken broth (instead of water and bouillon). After 6 hours in the crockpot, they were firm and I turned them off. When we ate 2 hours later, they were softer and perfect. I will definitely make this again the exact same way I made them this time.

Well I will have to say I doubted this would be good. I have never made a black eye pea recipe I liked... THIS WAS AWESOME!!! I will be making this every New Year from now on! Only thing I did different was use 1 Knorr beef stock in addition to the chicken bouillon cubes. Thank You for the kickin recipe!

Soaked the peas overnight.  Added some smoked ham hocks and cooked for several hours the next day.  Removed the lid to cook down some of the liquid for the last hour or so.  The beans thickened up by doing so.  Removed the ham hocks, tore the meat off and added it to the pot (there was not much, the ham hocks were mostly fat).  Added some salt and pepper and yummy, these were excellent for our New Year's day meal!

This was my first attempt ever to make black-eyed peas. We loved them! The recipe was so easy to follow, but it does make a lot. I will continue to use this recipe for years to come! Thank you for the original recipe and the helpful reviews.

I took the original recipe, cut all the ingredients in half and also cut the cooking time in half.  In addition, I added 3 cloves of garlic and replaced the ham with tasso.  The result was the best tasting black-eyed peas that I have ever had.  We had it on New Year’s Day for good luck, as is tradition in the south and the result should be the luckiest year ever.

AWESOME!!!  Compliments are flying at me from all directions because of these peas.  Best New Years I've ever had! Ha ha.  I did NOT soak these first - just boiled for a couple minutes, then followed the directions from there.  But they were done far sooner than the recipe.  Probably after a couple of hours.  I still let them sit and blend for another 24 hours.  I also added a few tbsp of minced Jalapeños and that was the jam.  I highly recommend these!!

These things are great! I'm pretty good with pinto beans but never have been able to do black eyed peas. That changed when I made Dave's Georgia Black Eyed Peas. I followed the recipe to the letter. They were the best black eyed peas I've ever tasted. I'm definitely adding this beauty to the menu rotation.; absolutely delicious!

Every new year I make black eyed peas and am always looking for a new recipe. I won't be looking anymore! This recipe will be a yearly tradition and the only way I'll eat black eyed peas from now on. I pretty much made the recipe exactly as stated, except I added garlic to the onions when browning them.  I served it over cornbread. The sweetness from the cornbread mixed really well with the saltiness of this dish.

Instead of simmering for 8 hrs, I threw this in my pressure cooker on high for 15 minutes. A little runny, so more like a delicious soup OR I'd reduce water to 5c instead of 6c. Tasty and easy! FYI-no need to add salt.

This was so good.  Even my husband liked it being skeptical  if he would like black eye peas. I also  halved the recipe and used beef bouillon as someone suggested. Sounded more hardy with the peas. Added just a dash of liquid smoke and garlic. Otherwise stuck with the recipe.  Simmered four hours. Delicious!

My husband and I have recently moved to the midwest and when New Year's rolled around we found a major cultural difference that grocery stores did not sell black eyed peas!  My in-laws sent us a bag just in time.  This is the first year I have had to make them.  I tried this recipe and invited all of our neighbors over and everyone loved it!! I served it with Cornbread.  It was fabulous!  The only thing I did differently was used 7 cups of water instead of 12.  I like my peas to be thicker.

Excellent recipe. No modifications needed for me. The peas tuned out to taste much how I remember my mother's tasting when I was growing up in lower AL. Thanks for sharing, Dave!

Wish I could give 10*!  Yes, that good.  Did it all in the crock pot, but added a ham bone.  No bacon on hand, sautéed the onions in bacon grease (always on hand).  Thanks sooo much!

First time I have ever cooked black-eyed peas that weren't in a can. I had no idea they couold be that yummy. I omtted the butter and jazzed it up with onion, garlic and some smoked paprika. Served it up with some cornbread and we had us a nice meal. Fantastic.

I grew up in the south but with a mom who was not southern at all. As an adult I decided I was adopting the traditional New Years meal of this region. Made this recipe two years ago and am back to make it again. Excellent recipe and very easy for a newbie!!!!

This recipe was literally my last ditch effort to find a way any of us would eat black eyed peas. I was expecting to waste bacon and end up throwing it in the trash once again, but there was nothing left to throw away! I halved the recipe & used Better Than Bouillon, but followed the rest to a T. I did end up topping with some hot sauce for some kick. I will definitely be making next year. Ty!

I did the basic recipe but wanted to use my instant pot. Here’s what I did:  I used (3) 1 lb bags of frozen black eyed peas. Just put them in the pot with 48 Oz of low sodium chicken broth. On the stove I cooked 1 1/2 lb of peppered bacon bits and pieces until crisp. Drain on a paper towel and crumble into pot. In the bacon grease add 1 stick butter and two chopped sweet onions and two chopped cloves of garlic. Once done transfer into pot. Add 1 lb of ham hocks. I use the smaller ones sold in bulk...not the meat department’s usual stock. For seasoning I used fresh ground black pepper, Crazy Jane’s Mixed Up Salt, low sodium Mediterranean spiced sea salt, smoked salt and a dash of cayenne pepper. It cooked on the bean setting for 45 minutes. I served with collard greens for money.

I’ve made these peas several years and they’re always a crowd-pleaser.  I’ve love pea and have eaten them my whole life and I must say this recipe takes peas to the next level.  The only modification I do Is I soak my peas overnight in my crockpot, then rinse and cook my peas in the crockpot 4-5 hrs on high and about 7-8 hours on low, I check the tenderness the last our so they don't overlook. This is my go-to for peas now.  Excellent!

Excellent!   Best BEP recipe I've come across.  But *EIGHT* hrs cooking time on stove top?  They would have been much by then.  Mine were done in 1.5 hrs.

Here are a couples changes I made: 1) I didn't add in the ham, because I didn't have any more leftover from Christmas- I did, however, use a couple slices of hog jowl; 2) Used beef bouillon cubes instead of chicken.

 I ended up adding about 1 cup of water during cooking so they weren't so thick. I also didn't need to cook for the full 8 hours; I'd say that these were finished in about half the time. They were amazing! Definitely going to prepare these again next year!

I love this recipe. I added half a green pepper to the oinions during frying (just because i had one and it needed to be used)  this by far my favourite recipe of this type. Very nutritionally balanced and a crazy inexpensive side dish.  Great way to use up leftover holiday ham and any veggies you have from your veggie platter!

I had to make a few changes because I only had canned black eyed peas. I skipped the first two steps, cooked the bacon, then the onion and then added everything to the skillet. I added about a cup of chicken broth, brought it to boil and simmered about 20 minutes. Mmmm. So good. Thanks!

Very good!  I only had half the black eyed peas it called for, so I substituted dried pintos for the rest, and it was GREAT! (Also I didn't have ham, so used just the bacon and added a little more salt.)

Really good and my beans even got soft!  I usually use canned beans because I've never been able to get dried ones to soften.  This is an excellent recipe.  I did sprinkle it with jalapeno Tabasco and that made it even better.
Instead of simmering on the stove, this time I stuck these in the oven at 225 and left for the day.  I stirred them up when I got home about 6 hours later and they were delicious.  The Tabasco still makes them better.

Replaced the ham with sausage since I didn't have any ham. After cooking the bacon, I cooked the onions and sausage in the bacon drippings and then threw everything into a crock-pot and let it cook on high for 4 hours. Scrumptious!!  --- but not for those trying to avoid fat.

I substituted German style smoked sausage for the ham.  Loved it: so smooth the bean (or peas)!  Definitely will make again. I halved the recipe and did it in a pressure cooker in 30 minutes.  And, I added diced Gouda cheese to each bowl upon serving.  It seemed to go well with it.

Excellent! I couldn't find neck bones at my local store, but I substituted some shoulder butt and used more diced ham than it called for. After it was done cooking, I actually added the rice to the soup, instead of serving it over rice.

The best Blackeyed Peas I've had. The only thing I added was a little bit of celery in with the onions. Great recipe!

Turned out great. Omitted the ham because I didn't have any. Soak beans all day and night. Cooked next day in crockpot on low for 8 hours.

Amazing!  I've converted my northern wife to a southerner with this recipe.  I followed the recipe almost exactly with the exception of the cook time.  Not sure why these need to simmer for 8 hours as I'm thinking the peas would be mush by then.  I simmered for three house and they were perfect.

Great recipe! I added some celery, carrots, and garlic...I know weird but a friend recommended them. Also used beef sausage cause I made it for company that doesn't eat bacon. Even with adjustments turned out great!!!  I didn't know I could cook beans this well.

This was a great variation on a basic veggie side dish. I scaled back to about a 2/3 recipe, used bacon only (no ham), and frozen instead of fresh peas since they weren't available at my grocery store.  If using frozen or canned peas, keep in mind you'll need FAR less water/bullion or broth... about half the amount the recipe shows. I recommend to add as needed during cooking.  Also, it won't take as long to cook.  I had mine going for a few hours, but you could cook it even more briefly.

The bacon adds a nice smoky flavor and an unexpected crunch.  I only used a little bacon grease for the onions since I used so much additional bacon, but I did add the butter according to the recipe.  So glad I did! Simple but very satisfying and tasty recipe.

Excellent!! This recipe also works very well in the crock pot on low! Everyone that I have served this to has loved it. I have substituted pinto beans for the peas with equally good results.  I do add 1-2 chopped jalepenos (you can deseed and soak the peppers in cool water for 10 minutes or so to reduce their heat) and some fresh minced garlic halfway through the onions' cook time.

This recipe reminded me of baked beans.  The ones with pork in it.  It was pretty good.  My husband enjoyed it.  I made it exactly as listed.  Only halfed the recipe.  I would make this again!

Made this in the slow cooker with smoked turkey wings instead of the pork and it was AMAZING! So good I also used a little bit of white wine vinegar just to kick it up a notch it was awesome! Definitely making these again!

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.  These are so soulfully yummy, such a reminder of the South for my family (now in Colorado)!  The only change I make is to halve the recipe and cook for only around 5 hours as a result.  I love these with rice as a meal or as a side dish.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Wonderful recipe! Reminded me of my southern roots (live in Midwest now)! I used leftover Christmas ham and had to sub 16 bean soup mix(did not use spice packet) ONLY bc I procrastinated and went shopping on NYE so all the black eyed peas were gone, uh duh! I also omitted salt and pepper bc the bacon and butter/grease was plenty of salt. Other than that followed recipe to the tee and it was a big hit with family. Will definitely make again, thank you!

I like my peas in a thick juice and this was kind of watery. I used an oval-shaped slow-cooker so maybe I didn't need as much water as the recipe called for. They were done in 4 hours too. The peas were soft enough without being mushy but they weren't as flavorful as I'd hoped. I might used some smoked meat next time instead of bacon.

My grandpa always had a big garden with a lot of black eyed peas. One of our summer jobs was to "shell" peas. I grew up being told that dried black eyed peas were not as good as fresh black eyes, and had never tried them. My family was wrong. Fresh are great, but the dry peas become thick and almost creamy while cooking. The only changes that I made were I had cooked a ham for Christmas so I added the ham bone, cut the butter to 1/4cup and the bacon to 4 thick slices. I served the peas with corn bread. We all had seconds. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Good recipe.  I had to add some extra salt, but otherwise quite tasty.  Instead of cooking on the stove, I cooked my peas in the crock pot for 8 hours on low.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I also feel that it needs to be noted that this recipe only feeds 16 if you are feeding FOOTBALL PLAYERS! Seriously, this would easily serve 24 unless the only thing you are eating is black eyed peas.  Since they were so yummy, I just put them into the fridge, and I expect they will be even better reheated.  However, if you are planning actual servings, note that it serves almost twice as many as listed.

Top notch.  I used five cans of BEP's and half pound of cooked bacon and whatever ham I had left over and it was awesome.  Made it in the slow-cooker and used hand blender to thicken a bit before serving.  No leftovers!

This was so good! I changed it a little.  First I rinsed the peas and boiled them and let them sit an hour. Then I browned a chopped ham steak in a dutch oven.  Removed the ham and sautéed the onion with garlic too and butter. Once those were caramelized I added the ham again and the water with only 2 cubes.  I then added the drained peas and let it simmer with some salt and pepper.  It was ready after 2 hours.

Made for a New Year's Day dinner party.  1/2 the recipe.  I didn't use the water the beans had soaked in, I rinsed the beans after soaking them over night, put in crockpot with 2 cups of chicken stock and 1cup of water.  I did not use bacon, cooked 1 cut up onion in butter and olive oil, added 2cups cut up ham and pepper then put in crockpot.  Cooked on high for 1 hour then low for 6 hours.  Perfect.  No one had ever had black eyed peas but they all loved it and there was none left.  Thanks for this easy wonderful recipe.

Mmmmmm!!! Slap your Momma good! Make this and start your diet tomorrow. If you cut the recipe in half you will not have leftovers..... I used a Honey Baked Ham bone which I bought from the HBH store, if you buy a big bone it has a lot of ham still remaining and is soooo delish!! And dont forget to shred some cabbage (for money)  and saute it with some onions and garlic. Happy New Year!!

Although I have eaten black eyed peas before, this was my first time ever making them. There is no need for me to ever search for another recipe. This recipe is perfect. The only change I made was that I substituted the ham for more bacon instead and I didn't add any salt, only pepper. Yummy!!! My husband says this will be our New Years tradition from here on out.

My family is not big on pork so I only used this recipe as a base. I omitted the ham and bacon. I boiled a smoked turkey leg in with the chicken bouillon before adding the peas for flavor. I sautéed onions and also threw in a couple cloves of garlic, 2 jalapeño peppers and a couple of bay leaves in the butter. Also added a dash of cumin in with the salt and pepper.

OMG!  Dave, marry me...lol j/k.  This was the most awesome recipe for black-eyed peas I've run across.  I made it for a pre-New Year's family gathering and I'm already hearing the rave reviews - everyone wants to know the recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I used a garlic salt with parsley mix and added a bit of celery and it was fab.  I think next time I'll try to add some carrot shreds as well. - Don't need to add those things but adding a few more veggees is always a good thing :)  Thanks again!

This is just what I was looking for, as I had lost my original recipe for "Hoppin' John!"  Instead of bacon I use a ham hock and for seasoning; I add a teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper.  Thank you so much!  This is terrific southern cooking at its best!

These are some of the best BEP's ive ever had. I mostly followed the recipe but made a few changes. Firstly I only soaked the BEP's for about 4 hours and then cooked them over a low heat for another 4 hours and they still cooked perfectly. I also completely omitted the butter and bacon fat as i thought that the extra fat was not needed. In addition to the onions, boullion cubes, ham and bacon I also added a few crushed garlic cloves and a about 9 bay leaves. I did not need any salt as the boullion cubes and the bacon took care of that for me. Again these turned out perfectly and are so good that i doubt they will survive the next three days. Lol

My whole family loves this! The only deviations I made were: add chopped green bell pepper and a bit of minced garlic.  It is so good that it would be a shame to only eat this once per year! We have it often and always with homemade cornbread.

Came out great! I halved the recipe and used the exact ingredients as listed, except I added about 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes to give it a slight kick. After soaking the peas overnight I threw everything into the slow-cooker on low. Ten hours later after I had a pot of delicious southern goodness.
