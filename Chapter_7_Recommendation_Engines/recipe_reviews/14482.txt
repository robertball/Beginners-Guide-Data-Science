I rated this 4 stars after the following changes:
1 cup (not 2) of sour cream
1 full teaspoon of the vinegar, oil, and lemon juice
2 cloves fresh pressed garlic instead of powder

We used this as both a veggie dip and salad topper.

With a few modifications, I thought this was super. To cut back on the fat, I used low fat whipped cottage cheese in lieu of the sour cream. I added a ton more garlic powder (but that's just me), onion powder, dry mustard and a quarter cup of vinegar. No MSG passes my lips so I happily left that out. So delicious Maureen and thank you!

If you love garlic and love creamy dressings as much as we do, you can't help but love this one.

This is excellent! I had some fresh leeks so I minced up a little and added it. I also added a LOT more garlic and onion. I followed the other reviewer and added 1/4 c. vinegar, WAAAAY to sour!! I had to add a 1/4 t. of brown sugar to neutralize some of the sour, (you don't taste the brown sugar). I would suggest starting out with 1 T. vinegar and go from there. The longer it sets in the frig. the more delicious it gets.

I made this last night and it was BLAND! I followed the recipe pretty much as written. I didn't have steak sauce so I just added some salt to taste, and I added Grey Poupon mustard instead of mustard seed. I followed other reviewer's suggestions to at least do a full teaspoon of the lemon, oil, and vinegar. I did 1 1/2 cups of sour cream and 1/2 buttermilk to start, for more flavor. And I subbed a clove of fresh crushed garlic for the garlic powder. And it was still totally bland for my tastes.  
Only after some more doctoring did I arrive at something yummy. I added more buttermilk, another clove of fresh crushed garlic, and several tablespoons of fresh chopped herbs from my garden (oregano, parsley, thyme, and basil). I also added some dried onion flakes. After all that, the dressing turned out really good. My 2-year old son enjoyed dipping steamed green beans into it. The recipe as it is written, I'd say is a decent dip or salad dressing *base*, but I don't think it has nearly enough flavor to stand on its own as a dressing. Because I had to doctor it up (beyond the recipe) to make it really good, I'm only giving it two stars.

This was a good dressing/dip.  I did add some milk to thin it out otherwise it was too thick.

I made this, but I switched the amounts of the mayonaise and sour cream, used soy sauce instead of steak sauce, and added a whole head of roasted garlic.  Very garlicky, but that is a good thing in our family :).

I thought this was bland. The only thing I tasted was sourcream. After I added a lot more garlic it tasted better. I think you should use real garic instead of garlic powder.

Fantastic recipe!! Like others have recommended, I used fresh minced garlic (2 cloves) instead of garlic powder, used 1 tsp of each lemon juice, vinegar and oil, and used 1 1/2 cups of sour cream with 1/2 cup of buttermilk (that I made myself with milk and vinegar).  We only use this dressing when we have ceasar salad now....we never used store bought anymore.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Really good! I followed the recipe exactly, down to the MSG. I think I would probably prefer this with fresh garlic, but it was als fine with powder. Loved the little pop of the mustard seed - would probably add a few more next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This has an amazing taste.  One that would definitely "show up" in a salad. Not too much of any one flavor.  Made it for a family lunch and it was a HUGE hit.  I may try adding some parmesan or romano cheese, just a little.  This is a keeper!!!!

We loved this recipe, but make it without the MSG and mustard seed.  Goes great with any salad.

I love this delicious and creamy salad dressing. My question is, why in the world would anyone add MSG to something so tasty? Many people, such as I, have an allergy to this ingredient.  It causes migraine headaches. I make it without it and nobody misses it.

5 since the changes were very minor; I don't have MSG.....used Lowrys Season Salt which I do have on hand and contains MSG; the consistency is too thick for me (PLOPS on the salad.....I prefer mine to pour) so I just added some milk to thin to desired consistency. I was looking for a creamy dressing as I was making a grilled steak salad and the vinegarettes we had on hand didn't seem to fit the bill with the grilled steak.......the creamy garlic paired very well. I made it last minute and it was good.......I suspect it will be even better tomorrow after the flavors have time to age.

I decided to add 2 cloves of chopped garlic instead of powder for flavour. The end result was a very bitter dressing.

Hubs was much more impressed with this salad dressing than I was but then again he didn’t taste it in its original state, before I did a whole lot of monkeying around with it to make it taste like something other than simply sour cream out of the carton.  More steak sauce, more lemon juice, a lot of buttermilk to make it more of a dressing consistency and a boat load of fresh dill before I could make something out of this.  As is, pretty nondescript.  This requires a whole lot of tweaking, which I’m sure most of the favorable reviews are based on.  Given its potential, I generously rate this 3-stars.

This recipe was a great starting point for me. I didn't use MSG, steak sauce, or mustard seed, but I did use some ginger powder and a bit of honey. I'm giving this recipe 4-stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly but the result still tasted like creamy garlic dressing. Yum!

This was good, although without modification it's pretty bland. I upped the steak sauce to 2 tsp, and used 1 T. of vinegar. I also added salt, pepper, and onion powder, and used fresh crushed garlic rather than powder. And no MSG! With the changes it was tasty.

I used only 1 cup of mayonnaise to one cup of sour cream. I also added one teaspoon of salt, doubled the garlic powder and added two teaspoons of onion powder. No MSG as that is unhealthy. I added enough water to make is somewhat pourable abs blended this in a vitamix blender.

Recipe isn't bad but please don't put MSG in your food, just use sea salt.  MSG should be avoided as much as possible,  It causes migraines and cancer.

Used this recipe as the basis for my dressing. I rarely follow a recipe exactly, so this recipe was a fantastic starting point. I used minced fresh garlic instead of powdered and added a bit of tarragon, parsley, and grated sweet onion for visual interest, texture, and extra flavor. I also eliminated the MSG due to allergies, and added salt and cracked pepper instead.  I was very impressed with the unexpected additional flavor that the steak sauce provided, and was surprised to see that the dressing was not at all discolored by the addition.  I also added a bit of milk to thin it to pouring consistency.  I will definitely be making this again.

nice savory dressing. I did increase the amount of steak sauce, lemon juice, vinegar and garlic just a little bit. I do tend to like fresh minced garlic over the powder, but the garlic powder provides a certain bite that was missing when I used only the fresh minced. I added salt and pepper, no specific amount just to taste. anyone who was dissatisfied with this and used the fresh garlic, try the powder either alone or in addition to the minced, it will make a difference.

This is so good. I did add more garlic and instead of white wine vinegar I used apple cider vinegar and did also add a bit of milk to thin it out. Great dip. But for dressing thin out with some milk

Creamy & good.  We like to drizzle it over steak, roast, steamed vegetables, baked potato.  It's not just a salad dressing, more like a universal sauce.

Just made it and love it already.  Looking forward to tomorrow when all the flavors "marry".  I did fool around with this and took lots of reviewers suggestions- 1t. each lemon juice, vinegar and oil, cottage cheese in place of sour cream, dry mustard instead of seeds, a touch of dry ginger, honey and freshly ground black pepper, and half amount of seasoned salt instead of MSG.  Keeper for sure!

Wow! This dressing is delicious! I used lite mayonnaise and fat free sour cream and it tastes great.
