Wow! This needs to come with a warning: Highly Addictive! This was a beautiful combination of colors and flavors. And, what's great about this is it's low fat and good for you too. No matter what assortment of fresh fruit you use it's bound to be good so use your favorites and use the recipe as a guide. I used a combination of apples, strawberries, peaches, and kiwi. I left out the sugar as the fruit has enough of that on it's own. For the preserves, I chose seedless raspberry. For the cinnamon chips I used reduced fat tortillas and cut them with a pizza cutter which made things a lot easier. I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes flipped them and baked them for another 7 minutes. They were crispy, sweet and delicious - next time I would double the amount because they went fast. This got a lot of compliments not only for taste, but for creativity. I'll definitely make this again - great recipe!

EVERYONE (meaning all ten of us) LOVED this. The fruit was amazing together...I added some, but I know it would have been good all on its own according to the recipe. The tortilla chips were really good and kept well in the refrigerator. We were able to eat this for dessert two nights in a row because it made so much. My son (6) and niece (5) helped make the tortilla chips; it was a great experience for them and myself...but very messy. haha. Would recommend to anyone looking for a healthier desert or snack for family, friends, or party.

made with my family's fav fruit picks. pineapple/apple/strawberrys n blueberrys.  left out all sugars n perserves.  the chips used were wheat/tofu tortillas.. everyone loved them n never knew they were healthy.  cinnamon mixture was only with 1 tblsp of raw sugar.  left overs if any used on oatmeal/pancakes.

Excuse me while I bury my face in these chips...

A friend brought this to our house and I demanded the recipe. If you're on a diet, this delicious dish will have you thankful you're cutting back!

This was absolutely fabulous!! I followed the directions exactly as printed and it turned out wonderfully! I had to bake four batches of the chips as my largest pan wasn't large enough. Each batch baked to perfection in 8 minutes. I did not have to flip them and they were perfect. I used Chi-Chi's Burrito sized flour tortillas and used a pizza cutter to to cut each one into 8 equal size triangles. Thank you very much for this easy, delicious, low fat snack!!

Made this for a "dessert day" at work, for those who wanted something low fat.  It is a hit!  Lots of chopping, but it's worth it.  I used crisp apples, raspberries, strawberries and kiwi.  Don't skip the kiwi!  It gives it that bit of tartness you need in salsa and goes great with the cinnamon chips (which I bought bagged from the grocery store).

Made this with Mexican Casserole (from allrecipes.com) and a sweet corn bread.  Whole family said it was the best meal ever.  For fruit, I added a mango and nectarine and I used current jelly for a little extra tang.  Excellent!!!

This fruit salsa is amazing! I ended using what was in my freezer which was strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, & apples threw em in the food processor and viola! To make it even easier I bought Stacy's Cinnamon Pita chips instead of making my own.

This was delicious!! I used real sugar instead of Splenda because I don't like artificial sweeteners.  I used Apricot Preserves which worked really well with the fruit! And I added a mango and a peach to it and omitted the raspberries - I didn't have any on had and they are WAY expensive to buy.  I soaked my apples in a salt water solution to keep them from browning, then rinsed them before adding them in, and it worked marvelously!

GREAT RECIPE!  It's wonderful with fresh berries, but it's also very good with frozen.  Make extra chips though because they are really yummy and the number called for will go very fast.

Skipped the sugar in the salsa because it was PLENTY sweet with just the preserve added. Also added the juice of a fresh lime and it came out sweet and tangy, which was awesome.

Used shortening instead of butter-flavored spray: added no flavor but worked fine as far as helping create a crispy-chewy texture on the chips.

Love this take on a classic. I made this for a potluck and it got rave reviews. The recipe makes a decent amount. For the chips I would cut them into squares vs. triangles next time. Much easier to do that way

LOVE this. Made this for daycare kids snack today using pitas instead of tortillas and changes up the fruit slightly. Added none of the sugar and used sugar free homemade jam... amazing!! made up extra chips for myself with a gluten free tortilla and chewed down right along side the kiss. This will be a regular around here.

This recipe has been a hit whenever I make it. I omit the sugar in the salsa as the fruit is usually sweet enough. I substitute raspberry jam for the fruit perserves.

SO good! Quick, easy, and a hit at parties. I usually use Stacy's cinnamon sugar pita chips, but did make the chips once and they turned out well. The recipe makes a lot, so I cut it in half.

My family loved this. Only problem is it is a bit time consuming to prepare, and then they ate it all in about 5 minutes. We ate it with cinnamon sugar pita chips- scrumptious! Will definitely keep on making this when I am ready to have my efforts completely devoured quickly! So be prepared- making this and watching it go so fast is definitely an act of love.

I decided that I wanted to eat healthy this year. So when I saw this, I couldn't wait to try it. I am so glad I did. This has got to be the best sweet treat  I have ever had. The chips we so good, I couldn't believe they were healthy. The only thing I added was a few grapes. Not too sweet, but just right. This will be a staple in my fridge from now on.

This was Delicious and great for a party! A lot of peeling and fine dicing and takes longer than 15 minutes but worth it! I didn't add preserves, i just reserved some strawberries and pureed them with teaspoon or 2 of real sugar or more for your taste, some lemon and lime juice. I also didn't feel like baking chips so I just bought Stacys cinnamon pitta chips.

Delicious.  Subbed mango for the raspberries and real sugar for the splenda.  Took this to a Superbowl party and it was the most popular dish...Was hoping to bring home leftovers but it was devoured.

I've made this recipe several times & it should come with a warning - HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!  It's delicious!  Made it for the Super Bowl game & even the big, hunky guys loved it!  It's also a nice alternative for those of us watching the calories.  And it's so easy to make - I would suggest doubling the recipe.  YUM!

This dish is dangerously good. I've made it more than a few times and I eat it ALL myself within a day or two. I'm sure it's not good for me, although I try to convince myself otherwise because it's all fruit. I also do not add the sugar.
Highly recommend this recipe, just beware of it's power!

This recipe is amazing!  I made it exactly as stated except I used strawberry perserves. My husband thought it was great and wants to take some to work. The chips are addicting.  I did use butter flavored Pam like one reviewer suggested. This is definitely going to be a go to recipe for get togethers.
