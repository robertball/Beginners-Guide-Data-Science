I'm going to give this a rating from my granddaughters.  My suggestion on this is to have the peanut butter at room temperature before adding the honey and milk powder and then refrigerate it before making it into balls and rolling in the graham cracker crumbs.  I do prefer rolling my cracker crumbs from the crackers instead of buying the box of cracker crumbs--it just tastes better to me.  As with so many recipes where you roll something in crumbs, these didn't use all the crumbs called for, so you could go way short and then add as needed.  I refrigerated them afterwards to keep them firm enough to handle.  I did not use the raisins, but I could possibly try a little piece of banana in the middle of them next time, since the girls do like that combo.  These are something easy to make for a sweet but fairly healthy snack.  Thanks for the recipe!

I remember our school cooks would make these for lunch as a treat. Brings back good memories. Too bad now we can't make these kind of treat because of all the peanut allergies. The cooks just used the dry milk peanut butter and honey and rolled in graham cracker cumbs.

Forgot how delicious these are! I didn't use raisins don't like them. And I decided to roll them in unsweetened coconut flakes instead of graham crackers. The mixture was a bit runny and didn't hold together well but I'm 99% certain that's because I used a organic natural peanut butter that needs to have the oil mixed in. That peanut butter seems more runny in general when compared to regular packaged peanut butter. It was a easy fix by adding a bit more powdered milk though. The next batch I made I cut back on the honey and everything turned out fine. The batch after that I added the recommended amount of honey and some chia seeds. The experimenting and customization will continue. Great recipe to get me started.

When I make these I like to use rice crispies or frosted flakes instead of graham crackers. Makes more of a crunch.

Good recipe can't go wrong with peanut butter balls. My usual recipe uses less honey and powdered milk and you mix Graham crackers in with everything else. I also seem to remember my aunt making these when I was a kid and putting some orange juice concentrate in the mix for a yummy orangey flavor. Not sure of proportions but something someone might like to try if that sounds good.
