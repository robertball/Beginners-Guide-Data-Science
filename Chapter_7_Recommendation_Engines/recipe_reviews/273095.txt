Delicious!  I had to modify due to lack of ingredients.  Substituted gouda with cheddar and used herbs rather than the Ranch Dressing mix.  Will make this one again!

This was really good. I substituted riced cauliflower for the broccoli, but this was delicious and my wife loved it!

Liked the homemade sauce, instead of cream soup. I did sprinkle with toasted bread crumbs instead of more cheese, which I guess makes it not keto. But it was good, just the same.

Perfect Keto macronutrient ratios!  Yahoo!  Would be a 5 star, except that I found it to be overly rich.   I think  that it might be best cold and rolled into balls  to be used as a quick-grab, keto-perfect snack.  Will try that.

Careful not to let the butter separate. Also, the recipe doesnâ€™t tell you or account time to cook the chicken first. This entire dish took about 90 for me to make.... all depends on how you cook your chicken.
