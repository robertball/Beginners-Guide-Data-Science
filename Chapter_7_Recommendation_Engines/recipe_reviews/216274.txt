These are really great.. and a twist to the classic 7 layer bar with a graham cracker crust.  They do need to be eaten up in a day or two, but these are elegant and rich.  I like to toast my coconut slightly in a 325 oven for a few minutes until the coconut begins to turn golden - it brings out a great flavor and crunch.  I also use 6 oz of chocolate chips and 6 ounces of butterscotch chips to add an interesting dimension to the dish.  Delish!

These are delicious, but I found them a little dry.  Next time, I will cut the initial baking time back to 10 minutes, then top and bake for another 10 minutes, and then check for doneness.  Nonetheless, they are extremely rich, decadent, and tasty!
