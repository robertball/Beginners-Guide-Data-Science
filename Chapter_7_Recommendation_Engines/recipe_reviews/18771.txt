This turned out great.  I would recommend serving with Tzatziki sauce.  In the future I am going to attempt to make four individual rolls instead of just one.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use more dough than called for.  I will be making this again and again and again!

I used ground turkey since I don't like lamb, but this was good. My husband  loved it. However, it was kind of hard to roll the dough with all the stuff on it, and it was still doughy in the middle after cooking. So next time I'm going to make it more like a calzone--place the filling on one side of the dough and then just fold it over before I cook it.

I omitted the salt and made it like a calzone.  I was unable to find ground lamb, so I substituted ground pork.  My husband and I enjoyed it.

EXCELLENT!! I am very critical on Authentic Gyros when I go out and have never had a recipe to make them at home.  When I was short on time and saw this recipe - WOW was I surprised!
Followed the recipe almost to the letter, maybe a little less cumin and a little more oregano and awesome!!  Always double the garlic!!

This is great. I used Pillsbury pizza dough.  I also used ground beef.  Left out the olives and zucchini because of hubby.  You have to use fresh ground pepper with this-NOT the stuff you find on the table-real ground peppercorns! That is what makes the flavor.  Easy and great recipe. Going to add to our favorite list.  Oh yeah, we used ranch dressing because I was lazy about making cucumber sauce.  Worked well with the flavors as well. Thanks for the recipe.

Yumm-ee.  I kind of made this my own recipe because of my pickiness.  I used all ground sirloin, no zucchini or olives, and added extra feta.  I also had some egg whites in the fridge that I brushed on the gyrolls to help the garlic powder really stick.  I also used the cucumber sauce from Sean's falafel salad with the gyrolls.  This is a definite keeper.

Great!!!  We have tried both lamb and pork and enjoyed them both.  I do think that the lamb gives it that true Greek flavour though.  Try it with homemade tzatziki sauce.  Great comfort food.

We really enjoyed this!  We love gyros sandwiches and this was a nice alternative.  I will try a different pizza dough next time.  I used Pillsbury and it was okay, but I would have liked it a little crustier.  Trader Joe's has a pizza dough in their refrigerator section I will try next.  This had great flavor.  One of my daughters asked if we could have chunks of lamb next time instead of ground, so I might try that too.  Tzaziki Sauce is a must!  Thanks for the treat!!

I made my own tried-and-true pizza crust, so I had more than enough, but I have to say that I'm relatively unimpressed. This is a recipie for a super-meat fan or a super-lamb fan -- one slice is a big gob of meat and the strong lamb flavor overpowers just about all the other ingredients. I also recommend using a very high quality feta because the cheaper stuff is a bit gritty when melted. I reduced the amount of salt (1 tsp instead of 2), as suggested by some posters here, and found it needed salt. And, ultimately, I thought this lacked the requisite "zing" of gyros. It's definitley a recipie I will futz with, but it's pretty ho-hum the way it is. My husband didn't even come close to finishing his small portion. Too rich and kind of "all one flavor." I'd say: half to 3/4 of the meat, increase oregano and cumin, keep salt at 2 tsp., maybe add lemon juice and/or mint to meat mixture, high-quality feta, increase olives and zuccinni.

Good served with tzatziki or ranch dressing.  I had trouble finding lamb, so I used hamburger and it was fine.

This recipe is truly outstanding.  I hadn't registered with allrecipes.com, but decided to in order to give this dish the review it deserves.

One caution: 1 lb of pizza crust dough, when rolled out per the instructions, is really insufficient, and paper thin...  I'll another 8 oz. of dough next time.

Still, *fantastic* dish, went wonderfully with:

- Pasta Side: Goat Cheese and Arugula over Penne 
- Vegetable Side: Festive Onions 
- Dessert: Watergate Salad

WOW!!! This was great...my family loved it including my 6 year old that dosen't try many new things.  I did follow the advice of other's and cut the salt way down.  Also, I omitted the olives and zucchini because I didn't think the kids would go for them.  I was able to find ground lamb which I think is a must if you are trying to get a real gyro flavor.  We couldn't believe how much this tasted like the "real thing".  I did use pizza dough already prepared from the grocery store.  I will make my own when I have more time in my bread machine.  I doubled the recipe which left one whole "gyroll" left over for the next day.  It tasted even better.  I may use this in pita's another time and serve it with sliced onions and tomatoes like a typical "gyro" is served....and of course this wouldn't be complete without "tzatziki"...the one I tried from this site was not the greatest....I will have to work on a "tzatziki" like they serve in Greek restaurants....more sour cream than yogart is what I think makes the difference.  Thank you for a GREAT new recipe.....

This was delicious, but as others said, way too salty.  I will use maybe 1/2 teaspoon salt next time.  The flavor was amazing, and I used the 'Pizza Dough' recipe (the no rise one) found on this website, as well as the cucumber sauce from the Grilled Gyro Burger recipe.  God, SO GOOD!!

I've had this recipe in my recipe box and when I saw some ground lamb at my local grocery store I had to try it. 

Actually, I just made the meat mixture, which is perfectly seasoned, and made gyros out of it with pita bread, lettuce, tomato, thinly sliced cucumber and tzatzki (cucumber sauce -- recipe available on this site, except I used sour cream instead of yogurt because I didn't have any plain yogurt). 

I love feta but I left it out because I didn't have any and with the meat being so nicely seasoned and the tzatzki, it wasn't even missed, though I am looking forward to trying this "gyro" with the feta. I served these gyros with baked potato wedges seasoned with greek seasoning.

Everyone in the family liked this, even my two teenagers. They like gyros and thought this has a similar flavor to the ones they get at the mall. It was different and unusual and a nice change from our usual line-up.

I followed the recipe as written, but next time I'll make some changes.  First, I will make my own pizza crust because the only kind I could find in a tube wasn't big enough to hold the filling.  Second, I will make individual rolls.  Third, I would add a lot more feta cheese...  Mine certainly wasn't "mess-less", but mostly because I didn't have enough dough.

Wow -- this was really, really good!  It tasted like something I might get in a Greek restaurant!  I didn't bake it in the dough.  I made the meat and stuffed it into pita pockets with feta and kalamata olives on the side.  I would probably never bake it in dough.  This is so quick and easy.  I plan on making it quite often.  We heated the leftover meat in the microwave yesterday for lunch.  My only complaint is that there is a LOT of fat between the olive oil and the fat from the ground lamb.  I'm going to cut down on my olive oil next time.  But really a great meat dish.

This is fantastic. I couldn't find ground lamb so I used ground pork. I omitted the onion, hot pepper sauce, and zucchini. I used fresh dough made in my bread machine instead of pizza crust dough.

Made as instructed and this wasn't bad. The filling was a lot more then my pizza dough could handle, so make sure your surface is floured or greased so you can roll it effortlessly.  The inside had a lot of dough after I had cooked it, but the outside was very crisp and flavorful. This dish was pretty tasty, but it requires some practice. Next time I'll make this more like a stromboli so I don't have to deal with the rolling issues, although I liked being able to just pick it up like a sandwich. My wife and I added some Tzatziki sauce, a few beers and it was a pretty good summer meal.

My Husband Loved it!!! But I don't like lamb to strong of a flavor for me, so I give it a 4 1/2. But it was fun to make. I suggest placing the dough on waxed papper, lightly floured. It makes it much Easier when rolling it up. And no mess. I would be careful on how much salt you add. Remember that you can always add more. Other than that, Enjoy :)

Love making this... though over time I've made a few substitutions. I used the Kraft Parmesan cheese stuff instead of feta, because I am lactose intolerant and the other stuff is lactose free. I've used spinach instead of parsley, and I always use beef instead of lamb (don't like lamb). Still, very tasty!

This was excellent. I followed another reviewer's idea and made individual portions with cresent dinner rolls. They were too difficult to "roll" so I made calzone-style. So easy and delicious! I couldn't find ground lamb so I used ground beef. Next time, I am going to search for the lamb to make a more authentic gyro. But nevertheless, this was really good and I will definintely make again.

We give this a 4.5 stars.  I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb.ground pork.  I didn't have ground lamb.  I also didn't have the zucchini or olives.  I took the suggestions of others and made "calzone style."  I used the Tzatziki Sauce from this site from Dinah.  It was wonderful.  I will make this again and again.

Very yummy but definitely too salty (as others have also said).  You end up with a less-than-messless calzone unless you use more pizza dough. Be sure to try the cucumber sauces elsewhere on this site.

Great recipe! I made some minor modifications - I used a 1/2 and 1/2 combination of ground lamb and turkey to cut some of the fat, and used a basil and sundried tomato flavored feta. Really went well with tzaziki sauce. Big hit with the family, and I plan on making this again.

When I took that first bite, I was astonished. And not in a good way. First of all - it was WAAAY too salty. And that was after I cut the salt in half! Because feta cheese is so salty on its own, it is not necessary to add 2 tsp of salt to the meat. It's easier to add salt to something after it's cooked than to take it away. Secondly, it was missing something for spices. I can't put my finger on it - it just needed something else.   I wish I could give this recipe more stars, but I can't justify it after having to throw most of it in the garbage. The only really great thing about it was the pizza dough - and that was my recipe.

This is outstanding.  I didn't have any issues with uncooked dough in the center.  I used Trader Joe's ready made pizza dough and rolled it out the full 12" by 18" size.  I used all lamb and instead of parsley, I added half a bag of frozen spinach (cooked and the excess water squeezed out).  I also used an egg wash and sprinkled dried parsley and sumac on top for color.  I served it with Trader Joe's cucumber yogurt sauce on the side and the Mediterranean Medley Salad from this site.  It was excellent!

My family doesn't like lamb, but the concept of this sandwich encouraged me to try the recipe. I substituted small pieces of chicken breast that had been pounded thin for the ground lamb. Left out the feta cheese and served with a tziki sauce. Yum!

This was a very nice dish, though I did make some changes as well.  As said earlier it's too much filling for the dough, so I used twice as much.  I didn't have lamb on hand, so used ground turkey, and it worked very well.  For the onion I found Vidalia-type onions work best for flavor/sweetness.  I didn't have fresh garlic on hand, so used 4tbsp of minced garlic (store-bought in garlic juice and water kind).  Zucchini was out of season when I tried it and couldn't locate any in cans, so left it out and used a little more black olives instead.  I'm considering trying to substitute cucumber for the zucchini to see how it works out.  The 2/3 cup parsley made mine a bit overly leafy in texture, so I reduced it to 1/2 cup and it worked out.  All in all is a good recipe that my wife loved as well, and we've made it several times so far.

This recipe is fantastic!!!  I make it at least once a week and my family love it.  Everyone looks forward to gyroll night!
The only variations I make are that I make sure to drain the cooked meat mixture on some paper towels before I wrap it in the dough and I don't use the olives or the zucchini because I don't like olives and I usually forget to buy zucchini when I'm at the supermarket.
I would recommend it to anyone!

It was edible, and something different, but will not make the recipe rotation.  It's not in the same class as a true Gyro.  The dough on the bottom and that rolled inside was too doughy, and the garlic powder sprinkled on top gave a burned garlic taste.  I'm sure this recipe has potential, but I will not make again.

This is a great recipe however I forgo the zucchini and add mushrooms into the meat mixture.  It also works perfectly with ground beef instead of lamb.

I have made this about 3 or 4 times and have never had the dough cook all the way through before some of it started to get too done. The meat and seasonings are wonderful, so we have resorted to putting them in large greek pitas instead of the dough roll way here. i love that idea, just can't get it to work for me. i always use cucumbers instead of zucchini and use the recipe for Raita on this site to dip it in/top it with.
Oh, i've only used lamb once, it's hard for me to find, pork works great too.

Absolutely Awesome!!  I'm not one to like Greek food that much, so I was hesitant in trying this, but the entire family loved it!  I used only half of the olives because my husband hates them, but to my surprise, he ate seconds without even realizing he was eating olives!  This was a huge hit!

I had to rig this recipe a little and use ground beef and cheddar cheese, but hubby and I were impressed. It tasted like pizza without the oil from the sauce. To cut down on the oil from the meat, I cooked it in a stack cooker (looks like a strainer with a whole dish under it to catch the grease-tupperware). I put mushrooms in it and used a pizza dough recipe from this site (what else??), and it was spectacular!! Yummers!!

This recipe was ok, but I didnt think it was fabulous. It tasted a bit like pizza with no sauce. I'm not sure what I was expecting but it was something a bit different than this. It was good, but I probably wont make it again.

This is such a great recipe. I have made this for my boyfriend at least once a week after discovering it (at his urging).  I have made it with both ground beef and ground turkey as I could not find ground lamb but I can't wait to try it with the lamb. I have omitted the zucchini and I have used an olive tapinade purchased in my local grocer to alleviate a bit of the prep time. It is good with any kind of flavored feta (tomato and basil, etc.) or just the plain stuff. Another thing is I leave out the salt all together as the olives and feta are salty enough all by themselves. Of course you should serve it with a yogurt/cucumber sauce, but you knew that already...

This recipe was a hit!  Prep was quick and simple.  Pilsbury Pizza Crust in a tube makes this a snap! Don't skimp on the pepper (as I did) or you will loose the Gyro flavor.  Lamb was tasty, but if it's not available at your local grocer, I think a lean hamburger/ground turkey mixture would work.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great! I did 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 lamb.  Next time I won't doubt myself, and I'll use all lamb. I did cut the salt to 1 t. and I used just 1 4.75 oz. can of diced black olives, I think 2 cans would have been too much. I also stirred the olives & zucchini right into the mix.  I had no trouble with doughy insides, it baked up well and my whole family ate it up!  I also made the tzatziki sauce from this site, except used sour cream instead of greek yogurt.  What a treat!

Not bad! While I'd prefer to eat this stuffed in a pita, the concept of making a "gyroll" was fun nonetheless. My hubs snuck a couple bites of the seasoned meat and commented that it was the best part. I agree. The perfectly seasoned lamb is reminiscent of authentic gyro meat. The feta was a nice addition too, but the zucchini seemed out of place to me (I omitted the olives because neither my hubs or I like them). Other than my one substitution and mistakenly rolling this like a jellyroll (literally), I have no "real" complaints. I have no idea why I rolled this like a jellyroll (I CLEARLY misread Adam's instructions...) or how I was even able to do it. :) Next time, I'll be sure to follow Adam's instructions correctly haha! Having said this, I do have two suggestions for improvement aside from correcting my obvious mistake. First, I would not sprinkle my roll with garlic powder without adding it to some melted butter first. Second, I'd substitute refrigerated Italian or French bread dough for pizza dough (I used Pillsbury brand pizza dough and although suitable, I feel it wasn't crusty enough) and bake NO LONGER THAN 20 minutes. My roll was perfectly done in 20 minutes - follow the suggested timeframe printed on your tube of dough and bake no longer than that. NOTE: It is IMPERATIVE that you drain your meat VERY well. If you don't, your roll will be soggy. Served with tzatziki sauce (a must!) and seasoned curly fries, this was a fun meal. Thanks for sharing, Mr. Pack! :-)

This recipe was really good but I rolled out the dough and cut it into squares and then put the filling on and folded it over. Put a little bit of egg wash on it and baked for 15-30 mins. or until golden brown. I also would not add salt next time, lamb is very salty itself and adding 2 tsp was way too much. We made Taziki sauce to dip it in. LOVED IT!!!!!! Hubbs said were making it again as soon as the lamb thaws out

I think this could have been a phenomenal dish by omitting some of the salt from the lamb meat.  The feta and black olives contribute plenty of saltiness to the dish. When I make this again I plan to at LEAST halve the salt, if not reduce it more. Also, the pizza dough gets quite thin when rolled out to their suggested dimensions.  I would probably roll the contents in two sets of pizza dough to avoid this problem again (creating two separate rolls) Overall a very tasty dish.

I thought this was okay. I used the ground lamb and followed the recipe fairly closely (just used flavored feta at the end as that is what I had in the fridge) but I guess I was really expecting more of a gyro taste. Taste improves if served with Tzatziki sauce (recipe on this site). My husband like it. I may try it again with some tweaks.

After putting on the toppings I didn't bother to try & roll it. Dough was kinda sticky & messy ( my fault).  Tried to salvage it by ading a little mozarella on top & baked it like a pizza.  F****** fantastic!  Peopled raved about it.  I call it the "GyroPizza."  Followed the original recipe 100%.  Don't roll it or make a calzone - just add mozarella on top & bake.  Used this recipe for several years now & it's always a hit.

And now for something different, these things were pretty good! We used homemade dough from my breadmaker for these, and they turned out quite well. I was a little apprehensive at first upon using lamb and almost opted for ground beef...I'm glad I didn't! They ended up a little bit burnt, but that was my own fault. Tasty nonetheless.

Success! One of the first times my finished product looks exactly like the picture in the All Recipes cookbook! While I for one didn't taste any great resemblance to a gyro (hello, just cause you use lamb, doesn't a gyro make!), I thought this was well seasoned and it had a gorgeous presentation. I didn't have the "mess" rolling it up that others seem to be experiencing. Maybe the difference in store brand pizza crust? My new notes in the margin of my cookbook say: "Very good recipe. A little dry, so try serving with a Tzatziki sauce. Could use a bit more cheese. Next time try making into individual rolls or calzones for an even better presentation."  If this had a little bit of sauce to compliment it and the right sides, this could be one of those "Wow Him" meals that I'll pounce on my fiance one of these days! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I make this frequently.  I add Cavender's greek seasoning, use ground beef, and omit hot sauce.  I sometimes make it calzone style, or serve with pitas.  It's a great thing to bring to someone for a meal.

This was really good.  We spent a lot of time in Germany and often ate Yufkas.  this reminds me of that except Yufka's are made in tortilla like wraps.  Will make this again

Well, the taste was good. The whole pizza dough, rolling, ect- was a MESS. It was hard and the ingredients were moist so they began to seep through the dough. It was a BIG mess. If I try this again, I would use something like already made pitas or something similiar. The filling was good, the outer shell idea- BAD.

Since I'm a vegetarian, I use fake meat crumbles in place of the lamb, and this is an amazing recipe.  My husband and I love it with some tzatziki for dipping.

We absolutely loved this.  I used a basic, homemade pizza dough recipe and reduced the salt.  I served it with homemade tzatziki (sp)and we felt it was perfect.  It also reheats beautifully in the oven, so we were able to have this twice.

This is a definite keeper.  I made this for a cocktail party and everyone raved about it.  I made the homemade Tzatziki sauce from this site which was an excellent compliment to the recipe. I did need to cook them a lot longer than noted, but it was worth it.  Even the leftovers tasted great.

This is definitely something different.  I used ground turkey, but I think next time I’ll try pork or beef.  I didn’t have enough pizza dough, so I just saved what wouldn’t fit, and I’ll try it in regular pita bread tomorrow.  Also, I can’t imagine rolling the thing without making a huge mess, so instead I put the ingredients on one side and flopped the other side over.  (Make sure the ends are pinched well.)

Incredibly yummy. I couldn't get any ground lamb, so I substitued ground turkey and it was fantastic. I did decrease the amount of salt and even so it was still a tad bit salty. Very satisfying--a new addition to the keeper list.

This was an immediate hit and ranks in my husband's top 10 of favorites. My 3 kids (3, 2, and 11 mo) loved it, but I don't know if all kids would. We needed to cut back on the salt and we found 2 t pepper too strong, but that aside, this is a family favorite now. It is the closest imitation of a gyro I've found, and it's easier to make. I also made the cucumber sauce to go with it.

WAY TOO MUCH SALT!!!!  I only added 1 tsp of salt and it was still too salty.  The feta cheese is salty itself and the added salt was too much. I used pilsbury pizza dough in the can but the filling kept rolling out when i was rolling it, so i just folded it over like a calzone. I served it with a yogurt cucumber sauce, it needed it to mellow out the salt. I don't have any kids and my husband's only complaint was the salt.

I made the individual calzones using refrigerated pie crust.  The best part of this recipe is the delicious seasoning used for the meat.  I used ground lamb for the recipe, but I think it would also make delicious seasoning for ground beef for tacos and other recipes.  I also froze the extra (uncooked) calzones in the freezer on a baking sheet and have since put them right in the oven from the freezer.  They baked up fine.

My husband said this was the BEST thing I've ever made from this site (and I've made A LOT!)  I replaced the olives with tomato and mushrooms.  Soooo good!  However, a calzone style might work better for picking it up with your hands.

Delicious flavors, but not an ideal format.  I essentially followed the recipe as written. Minor modifications: I reduced the salt and pepper by half (still too salty), I used Kalamata olives in a lower quantity than suggested, used 7 oz. feta as that is what was in the package, and used Vidalia onion as suggested by others.  The pizza dough was fresh from my supermarket.  The rolling process wasn't too tricky, but the result wasn't worth the trouble.  The innermost dough wasn't well-cooked, the filling was too dry, and it was too messy to eat out of hand.  The same ingredients might be better used for individual-sized calzone-style pockets, and I am definitely going to redo this recipe as a pizza, with a bit of mozzarella and some diced tomato so it won't be too dry.  I made Yia Yia's tzatziki from this site, which was an excellent complement to the dish, and served it with a simple tomato salad.

This recipe has prompted my first review. These were positively scrumptious!!! I am a very picky eater, and I absolutely loved this recipe! It's 5:30 the morning after, and I'm going to heat one up for breakfast. Can't wait! I HATE onions, but I used a Vidalia, finely chopped (minced, actually)and it gave the meat a nice flavor. I used 1/2 lamb and 1/2 ground beef, but next time it will be all lamb. Delicious! Changes: I used two Pillsbury thin crust pizza dough, extra feta cheese,cut salt to 1 tsp. and parsley to 1/2 c , omitted black olives and zucchini. These only need to bake at 350 for 20 to 25 minutes. Don't forget the Yia Yia's Tzatzizi sauce from this site. I served with Grilled Greek-Style Zucchini from this site also. A truly fantastic meal!

This was ok.  I followed the recipe, minus the olives and zuchini and extra feta.  There was way to much meat for the pizza dough.  Next time, double the dough or cut down on the meat.  Also, made two versus one big one...next time I'll make 4 small ones.  I used lamb, but I didn't think it made a big difference, could have used sirlion or beef.  I made tatziki sauce to go with it.. made it taste like a real gyro.  Overall it was good, just needs tweaking.

This was very good but I altered it a bit to fit my ingredients on hand. I don't eat lamb so I used chip steaks and chopped them up in the pan really good, they worked great! I also ran out of Feta so I used good ol' American cheese. Again, great. This would probably be good with all sorts of veggies too. I agree with other reviewers who said there was too much filling for the dough. Next time I will use two pizza crusts. The idea and the taste are great and it is fairly easay to make!

I have made this 3-4 times, and it pleases everybody - from my wife, who has exotic
tastes, to my parents, who have fairly 
conservative midwestern palates.  It is critical
to have a good pizza dough recipe (worth its
weight in gold for this kind of stuff), which 
I fortunately have...

The Gyroll is so yummy and so easy.  I think I like the Gyros Burgers recipe on this website a bit better, but I prefer this when I am short on time.  It goes well with the Tzatziki Sauce II recipe (just make sure to drain the yogurt in cheesecloth for a couple hours before making it).

This is a wonderful recipe.  I make the dough in my breadmaker, and always make a double batch and freeze one for a quick and easy supper later.

This was pretty good.  My very picky boyfriend gobbled them up like they were going outta style!  I didn't put the olives or feta in it, as he doesn't like these things (I do, however.)  I also used crescent rolls and made individual servings, instead of the pizza dough.  I also used ground turkey instead of lamb.  I covered them with shredded mozarella and put parsley on top.  I liked all the spices; they ended up pretty yummy!  Will make again.

This recipe was great.  My husband, daughter (who is 3) and I made it together.  It was quick to put it together and we could hardly wait to dig into our gyroll.  I would highly recommend trying this one.  :-)

I thought this recipe was excellent and if you like lamb and can find it, it is well worth it.  I have also used ground pork and that was good too.  I used the pizza roll in a tube and like that very much, but have also put it in pita bread and that was just as good.  Topping it with Tzatziki is also worth the effort.

This was really delicious!  Even my 12 year old, who hates feta cheese, olives and zucchini loved it.  Leftovers the next day were even better.  I used hamburger instead of lamb.

The lamb in this was delicious.  I had a little trouble with the bread dough - getting an even shape, but I would definitely use the recipe with pita bread as well.

It was a different take on our normal gyros - the only challenge was that even though I cooked the Gyroll more than the instructions suggested, the dough on the inside was still a little underdone.

I couldn't make it exactly as described, because I have celiac disease and can't eat gluten or cow's milk. Since gluten free dough doesn't roll out worth a darn, I just made it as a pizza, with meat veggies and olives on the bottom and goat cheese on top. It was delicious.

Instead of Pizza dough I used phyllo dough.  Added ingredients as directed, topped with an additional phyllo sheet, with edges wetted, then pinched sides and baked at 350 for 25 minutes, turned out great! I also made extras, rolled cylindrically and wrapped in cellophane then froze for next time.

so good!  I mixed in 1/2 lb. ground beef to the lamb, just to make it less "gamey".  I also had some Aegean seasoning blend for meat, so I added a tablespoon of that.  I grated in the onion instead of chopping.  I let the meat mixture rest for about an hour before cooking.  One thing I have to do next time is drain the meat after cooking.  I forgot and the oils leaked out of the crust and caused a little smoking incident in the oven.  I didn't add the olives and zucchini (kids!) but I did leave in the feta and everyone loved it!  I used pizza dough from the deli department at the grocery.  I served it with Tzatziki sauce and a marinated cucumber, onion and tomato salad.

I didn't have time to make pizza dough so I made this with some fillo pastry sheets that needed using up. It worked out well. The meat filling is absolutely delicious! (I probably tripled the cumin and oregano called for as we like a lot of flavor). I haven't eaten lamb in 20 years, but this definitely made me want to try other ground lamb dishes! Great recipe, Adam! Thanks!

The exact recipe, I guess I would really give a 3.5-4. We are picky about doughy bread, and it doesn't seem possible to get the center cooked w/o burning the outside, so we put it in pitas. Leave out the salt. Many reviews confused me after making it because they said it was salty. I don't cook w/salt because of health issues. I also replace pepper w/paprika because I can't stand the taste of black pepper.  We also use 93% lean ground turkey for economical, health, and nature conservation reasons. I add 1-2tsp beef bullion and liquid smoke when substituting turkey. And definitely better w/Tzaziki

Very good recipe and not too difficult.  I agree with other viewers that this is great when served with Tzatziki sauce.  I've even tried this recipe with ground turkey and it's quite good.

This was a wonderful recipe.  Tasted just like a gyro sandwich, without the grease!!  I doubled the recipe and made two rolls using my homeade pizza dough recipe.  It was perfect.  The tzatziki sauce is a must to accompany it.

Good, but need more spice.  I'll try using my own pizza dough or crescent rolls next time as the "cheap" brand of pizza dough was awful.  Very filling.

The seasoned lamb got rave reviews, and we'll definitely be trying this one again soon. However, I will take the suggestion others made of making individual mini-calzones, because with Pillsbury pizza crust I could barely roll it up and the dough came out really thin in parts and almost tore (and this was with no zucchini).

This was decent, but not spectacular.  One of the few ideas for ground lamb that works well.  I might try this again, but I think a different bread would be better.  Also it tends to get greasy if you're not careful.

This recipe is really great.  I took a hint from other reviewers and made little calzones with crescent roll dough.  I also ended up just mixing the feta cheese and olives in with the cooked lamb because spreading each layer proved to be too tedious.  I didn't have any zucchini, or hot pepper sauce, so I threw in a dash of cayenne instead.  I think the recipe might call for too much black pepper, unless regular table pepper is more pungent than freshly ground.  I can't say for the salt since I ran out.  But all in all, really good, and fairly easy to make.  It does taste like a gyro as far as I can tell.
