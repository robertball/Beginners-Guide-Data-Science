Oh my gosh! These are SO good! I used a bag of SKOR toffee chips instead of chopping up the candy bars, and milk chocolate chips... and they were a HUGE hit!

Wonderful Recipe!!!!!! We loved it! I live at a high altitude so i used a little less flour and added one more egg and baked them for a bit longer and they turned out beautifully.  I used a Calphalon cookie sheet liner and the cookies lifted easily.  
My husband came home and ate 8 before dinner! This recipe is an absolute keeper!  My only suggestion is to make sure to spoon out a small amount onto your cookie sheet because they really expand, I did only 8 at a time, but they turned out perfectly!

My boyfriend is a firefighter so when I saw this, I felt I just HAD to make them for him. Although he really enjoyed them, I don't think they are his "favorite." I'm not much of a cookie fan so I found them to be good enough that I will make them again, but they don't deserve the five star rating.  Guests who were over while we were baking them attributed to their disapearance. Still very good and will pass on the recipe.

Absolutely the best cookie recipe I've ever tried!!  Each time we make this recipe, we've experimented with different types of toffee things.  The best we've done so far is chop up those bite sized heath crunches.  ALso good was adding chocolate chips, a symphony bar with almonds and toffee, and some of those toffee bits I found in with the chocolate chip section put out by Skor.  Fabulous recipe though, the cookies don't last around us!!  :)  I'll probably be making this every week from now on.  Mmmm

These were delicious!  I used margarine since I didn't have butter, and used 1/2 tsp baking powder, 3/4 tsp soda so they'd be fluffy.  They came out PERFECT, and I don't always have good luck with choc chip cookies for some reason.   I think next time I'll use more toffee bits & maybe less chocolate chips; like 1.5 cups choc chips, and 12 or more candy bars chopped up.

This recipe was very disappointing.  I was expecting great things, since two of my favorite items (chocolate and toffee) are included, but I found this to be only a so so cookie.  I will throw this recipe out!  My search for the ultimate chocolate chip cookie continues.

I made this recipe in a 9x13 pan and cut into bars.  I used shortening instead of butter and only one cup chocolate chips; baked for 20 mins approximately.  Came out great!

Everytime I have made these I hear how good they are! I've never had problems with them falling apart, maybe because I only use stoneware when baking cookies.  Excellent Cookie Recipe!

Followed  the recipe exactly and I didn't like the texture of the cookie.  To thick and a little dry for  me, but the kids ate them.

These cookies were yummy.  I halved the recipe due to the ingredients I had on hand, and used toffee chips instead of candy bars.  Per other suggestions I also added a little extra flour and lightly sprayed my pan with cooking spray so they didn't crumble coming off the pan.  I found that even halving the recipe left me with 28 cookies, and that one tablespoonful of dough spreads out to a "regular"-sized cookie.  This may not be my new favorite cookie, but they are really good and it's nice to have a change with the toffee in there.

Overall this recipe is pretty good but I made some modifications. The first time I made them they did tend to fall apart a little easily, so my first suggestion is to lightly spray a non-stick cooking sheet with Pam to help get them up. Next, I increased the flour to 2 and 3/4 cups of flour, and increased the sugars to 3/4 cup each. By doing all of these, the cookies didn't spread as thinly, and came out nice and chewy. A quick tip too is to never melt your butter before you add it. The colder the better. I also used Heath Bites instead of chopped toffee bars and it worked really well!

A very good cookie that my family enjoyed.  The toffee pieces was a nice addition to the overall taste of the cookie.  These also froze and defrosted very nicely.

This was just OK for us.  I made these cookies as written and they came out flat.  Next time I would refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes before baking.  Also, I agree with another reviewer that I would recommend cutting back on the baking soda.  Not sure if I will make these again as there are many other excellent cookie recipes on this site.

I have tried several chocolate chip cookie recipes on here and these were by far the best cookies I or my family has ever tasted. The dough is simply delicious! I have switched around and tried different chip combos like white chocolate and mint and they are all so good. I made a bunch yesterday and between my neighbours and family they are already gone. Some advice though make sure you do put them straight on the cooling rack after don't let them set. Thank You for putting this up my search is over!!! I will never buy cookies again !

yes, I'm bad. I made these as they are except for the toffee pieces. I doubled the recipe and also added (per 2 other chocolate chip cookies recipes) 2tablespoons instant espresso and 1 package of vanilla pudding. Soft, chewy and just a little something extra!!

These are my favorite so far off this site. I didn't put toffe in and, I added a little baking powder. The only thing is next time I will up the sugar. Thanks so much I think my search has ended.---Update..I made these agian and added 1/4 cup more brown sugar, turned out really good. These really do make alot. The smallest amount of dough makes a good size cookie. I think i got 5 dozen and, they make such a pretty cookie.

Everybody loved these cookies. I used a bag of heath bits instead of the actual heath bars, but followed everything else exactly.

I take these to work and they LOVE them. 
This may be the best chocolate chip recipe I have tried. I find the larger chunks of toffee work better. I once tried the Skor toffee pieces, but that was AWFUL, so I either break up a large Skor bar or break up the smaller Heath bars.

Pretty good. I made the dough and refrigerated it to bake later. I took the dough out of the fridge about 15 min prior to cooking so it would soften and the cookies came out perfect!

These were very disappointing. Maybe adding more sugar would help. Sadly the batch will end up in the garbage

For ease, I used a 300g bag of the Hershey Semi-sweet chocolate chips and a 200g bag of the Skor toffee bits instead of crushing up candy bars.  They came out great but were abit frustrating to clean up from as the toffee bits like to melt on the pans so it took some scrubbing to get them clean.

I don't use the toffee, but I do everything else to the exact measurement. I LOVE THESE COOKIES! I have tried 4 other recipes, an one of the other top rated ones on this site is inedible to me. I made a double batch, and threw away the dough after trying a cookie.  THESE ARE AMAZING! I am now going to make it as a base for gluten free, and see if I can get a good cookie out of it.

Excellent!  Followed all directions exactly (other than using toffee bits instead of chopping up bars).  Came out perfect and delicious.  I recommend taking out of oven a minute before it looks completely cooked since they cook while sitting.  Soft and chewy!

The difference is the gluten in the flour.  If you test the flour, then you will know how to use the flour/sugar/butter ratio to get the perfect cookie.  Love this recipe and the firefighter powerful loaded taste.

This was a decent cookie, but not exceptional. I found it to be rather "cakey" and I prefer a firm but chewy cookie. Also, I used only a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of SKOR toffee bits, which was plenty of both.

These weren't *bad* but they weren't anything spectacular. My cookies spread kind of thin, and even after baking 15 minutes they still were very soft. The toffee doesn't stay crunchy once the cookies bake, but rather it becomes kind of soft and mushy. A decent cookie, but I think I may stick to my regular chocolate chip recipe.

These were good, but I've had better chocolate chip cookies.  I cooked them for 10 - 11 minutes and they were too doughy.  At 15 minutes they were too cake like.  They were best hot out of the oven, but when cooled they weren't so good.

I took 2 batches of these cookies to work for Valentines day and they almost all were gone before lunch!  Thats say alot since there are less than 20 people in our office.  These cookies are soft, moist and light.  Suggest using Score toffe chips insted of the bars - easier and they mix better.  Enjoy!

I was really excited to find a toffee/chocolate cookie recipe, but was dissapointed when I made these cookies, just to find that they crumbled when I pulled them off of the cookie sheet. I had a bowl of cookie crumbs in the end. They did, however, taste good.

This recipe was ok. I just didn't go -goo goo over it. The family liked it, but I did not get the response I thought I would from them.
