This is a fantastic dish!  My husband ate his over rice and I had mine over whole grain pasta.  Served with a green bean and carrot mixture (French blend of Haricot Vert Green Beans, Wax Beans, and Baby Carrots), it was a complete meal.

I DEFINATELY agree with the other reviewers in that there is not enough sauce.  I would use more like the following:

5 cups chicken broth 
6oz. can tomato paste 
1 2/3 teaspoon ground black pepper 
3 1/3 teaspoon dried oregano 
1 teaspoon salt 
6-7 cloves garlic, minced 
4-6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves 
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs 
2-4 teaspoons olive oil 
16oz. fresh mushrooms (sliced)

I was confused by whether the ingredient is tomato paste or tomato sauce - if you read closely, you'll see both are mentioned. I decided to use paste, and it seemed to work. I pounded the breasts thin to ensure even cooking, and I used Italian herb-flavored chicken broth as well as Italian seasoned bread crumbs. The sauce was just enough for two breasts, so I agree with the other reviewers that you would need to increase all of the sauce ingredients if you were serving this for more than two. With all of that nitpickiness out of the way, I must say that this recipe is very good. The breasts were moist, the flavor was satisfying. It is going into my regular repertoire.

This was VERY tasty.  My husband LOVED it as well.  I do agree with the other reviewer that it was not enough, and also put this on top of rice.  I would also recommend doubling the sauce recipe if you are going to add rice...this way there is extra sauce for the rice.

At home alone one night and did not want to make a big fuss over dinner.  This was great.  It was super quick!  Next time I will omit the bread crumbs due to they really did nothing for the dish.  When you simmer with sauce and cover they get soggy.  The chicken however was excellent, very tender.  The sauce was one of the best I have had with chicken.  Served with white rice and steamed summer squash.  Leftovers were even better!  Thanx again!

While I was making this, all of a sudden, I had a memory of my mother making this same dish when I was little.  So this gets 5 stars for not only tasting great, but bringing back memories!  I used bone in chicken breasts, and used zucchini instead of mushrooms for my husbands tastes.  I also didn't remove the chicken to let the sauce thicken, I just let it all cook together for about 40 minutes covered on medium low, and served the sauce over the chicken and rice.  A delicious and easy meal!  Thanks!

Yummmm-Yummmm. Only critique I have of this dish is that it may not be enough-I have tried it on both beds of pasta (angel hair) and rice with great success. The sause rocks.

Well, the next day I had half a can of tomato paste left, so I made this again, with some variation.  I just used water instead of the chicken broth (the broth made it too salty), I added onion instead of mushrooms, and I also added a couple tablespoons of cream cheese to the sauce mixture (heat it up to melt the cheese in the microwave).  The cream cheese gave it a really creamy texture and flavor, and my boyfriend loved it!  And I usually suck at cooking!

Delicious! Quick and easy, too.  I more than doubled the sauce, as well as the garlic. Having an abundance of potatoes from our summer garden, I served with mashed potatoes (with lots of sauce) and sauteed spinach (with lots of garlic).  Yum - the family loved it!

Pretty good, I'll make again, but I suggest increasing the portion in the sauce, there was barely enough once I was done.

Delicious !  This is a nice change from other typical chicken recipes.  Like another reviewer I used 1 1/4 cup chicken broth, a 6oz can tomato paste, 1 tsp of oregano and 2 garlic cloves.  It came out perfect. I like a good amount of sauce with any recipe I make & these changes made it just right. I served mine over orzo.  Looking forward to making it again !  Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled the sauce as suggested and I was glad I did.  It was a good recipe, but the sauce was a little thin.  I think I will add diced tomatoes next time.  My hubby said it's a "make again".

My roommate and I really enjoyed this dish.  The flavors all worked together really well.  I did reduce the sauce a bit with white wine and it added quite a lot to the flavors - I definitely recommend it!  The cooking time didn't quite take 20 minutes, so be sure to keep an eye on it.  Served it over an italian polenta - delicious!

I was skeptical at first but after making a few changes this was a home run! I know other people suggested not breading the chicken but I think it does make a difference. I added chili flakes to the sauce for an extra kick. I also doubled the sauce as others suggested. I didn't have oregano on its own so I used Italian seasoning and it was fine. I also added a bit of balsamic vinegar while it was cooking which I think made the dish. 
Over all a great recipe that you can play around with. I served it over rice with a side of veggies.

Whole family LOVED it!!! I doubled the broth, added a little more tomato paste and skipped the salt. I sprinkled some cayenne pepper on my plate, I didn't want to make it spicy because my daughter wouldn't eat it, but I loved the heat from the cayenne. My husband said he'd like shrimp in it next time. Great recipe, thank you Jo Ann!! Definitely a keeper.

I thought it was just okay but my boyfriend liked it. I probably wouldnt make this again; felt like it was missing something. Doubled the sauce as other stated.

Excellent chicken dish!  I used 5 bone-in, skinless chicken thighs, 1 container of mushrooms, 1 onion, 3 cups of chicken broth, 12 oz of tomato paste and adjusted the spices to taste.  Dredged the chicken in a mixture of flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder before sauteing for 2 minutes per side.  Added chopped mushrooms and onions halfway through to saute with the chicken pieces and yummy juices.  Then added the tomato and broth mixture and simmered altogether for 15 minutes.  Topped the chicken with mozzarella cheese and finished in the oven (350F) for 5 minutes.  These measurements yielded plenty of sauce; great accompaniment to plain white rice or pasta.  Will make again for an easy, tasty, satisfying one-skillet meal!

It turned out how I thought it would taste.   It was good but I had to add some cornstarch and water and cooked it way longer trying to thicken it.  I followed the advise to make much more sauce using 5 cups chicken broth etc.

This recipe is almost exact to the recipe I have tried from dLife, but that they use low sodium chicken broth and 2 tbsp fresh oregano, or you can use 1/2 tsp. dried as mentioned in this recipe.  Instead of skinless chicken breasts I used skinless chicken thighs with bone in as I find them alot more tastier.  I would double up on the recipe because there is never enough as it is really good.

I loved this recipe! I did double the sauce like others did, but I also added more garlic(minced from a jar) and used 2 cans of mushrooms instead of fresh, which I didn't have. One teaspoon of flour at the end thickened it just a little. 
I would probably add onion next time, but that's all.

This chicken is the best chicken I have every eaten.  I have given this recipe to many of my friends and they all love it. I use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and I use portabella mushrrom. Delicious.  Thanks

I made this tonight because I was looking for something new and not too complicated.  I must say this was very good!  I doubled the sauce ingredients because I wanted to put it over mashed potatoes.  I was glad I did.  I added a little flour to the sauce when I boiled it at the end, to thicken it. FYI I used jarred minced garlic, tomato paste double concentrated in a tube, Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and vegetable oil instead of olive oil.  This will probably be something we come back to!  Thank you for this recipe!

We eat a lot of chicken in our house, and this recipe was one of the best!  Mh husband loved this and even my youngest son who is our pickiest eater was happy! We do love sauces in our house, so the only change I made was doubling the sauce and mushrooms.  Served it over hot jasmine rice.  Delish!

We really enjoyed this dish. The chicken was very moist and I love recipes that create a tender, moist chicken breast.  I love fresh cooked mushrooms, but for some reason they just didn't work for me in this recipe and I'm not sure why.  If I make again, I will omit the mushrooms.

This was very tasty.  It actually reminded me of pizza for some odd reason.  The only thing that was a little weird was the breading on the chicken.  By leaving the chicken in with the sauce, it just getts soggy like other reviewers said. I think next time I may take it out when it is crispy and then do the sauce and pour over the chicken just before serving.  Still a very good recipe!

This was very good.  I used a spaghetti sauce that I had in the freezer from the last of our garden tomatoes.  I served it with brown rice.  Even my husband enjoyed it.  Simple recipe to make when you don't have a lot of time.

I doubled the sauce ingredients, including the mushrooms (thank you, reviewers!). This was a nice, simple, delicious dish. I served with roasted garlic cauliflower from this site, and French cut green beans with almonds. Easy and very good!

This recipe is so easy, I put brown rice in a rice cooker at the same time I started the chicken, served with roasted 
red beets (leftover from Sun).  Also served siuffed jalapeno peppers. DELECIOUS

This was pretty yummy.  We had to double the broth mixture though to make sure we had enough to cover the chicken.  All together though it was pretty good.  Thanks!

This was really good. The first time I made it according to the recipe, but I kind of didn't like breading the chicken then adding the liquid in the pan, the breading came off and made the sauce weird because there was breadcrumbs in it. So I omitted the breadcrumbs the next time around and just seasoned the chicken regularly. I liked that a bit more. I also added carrots because I had some.

This got mixed reviews at our house. I didn't think it was too bad but hubby did not like it. I followed the recipe as written other then I didn't add the bread crumbs to the chicken. I do agree with the others that it doesn't make enough sauce

I didn't have tomato paste on hand so I used a can of regular crushed tomatoes and pureed them in the blender. I was able to get more "sauce" this way and I could control the salt a little better. It was AMAZING!

This was wonderful.  The only change I made was to double the sauce for 4 breast and it was plenty.  I also left out the garlic and used seasoned bread crumbs.  Will definitely add to our regular menu.  It was easy too.

I was very happy with the result but do think that it is necessary to double the sauce. I would also add more garlic (3-4 cloves) and a little bit more salt. Otherwise, great texture and flavor.

This is very delicious.  I used the sauce ingredients as listed, but only used two large chicken breasts.  The amount of sauce was just right.  I did pound the chicken breasts to make them cook more evenly and used crushed garlic melba toasts in place of the bread crumbs. Sprinkled a little parmesan cheese over the top. Excellent recipe!

OH, I LOVED THIS!  I have never cooked with tomato paste because it gives my dad heart burn, so I was afraid that it would cause us to suffer, but no. This is so good and so easy. I added tomato puree since everyone said it needed more sauce. I served it over rice. The only bad thing I can say is that my husband dumped the sauce so none for left-overs. :( Made some really quick with the left-over ingredients I had and then there were no left-overs. :)

This recipe was delicious!  I followed Elizabeth's suggestions to increase the sauce and spices - however, 5 cups of chicken broth is WAY too much.  I ended up straining and tossing a lot of it.  Use 3 cups chicken broth, max, and 12 oz. of tomato paste for a thicker sauce.  Serve over rice or pasta and enjoy :)

This is a great dish!! It's been awhile since I tried a new recipe, and this did not disappointment. I did not change a thing except for that fact that I doubled the sauce ingredients, per others' recommendations. I let the chicken simmer for exactly 20 minutes, and the chicken was perfectly cooked, moist, juicy, and flavorful. The mushrooms were delectable after soaking in the sauce, and the spices were just right. Will definitely be making this again.

I followed this recipe except I tripled the sauce as I had more chicken.  The chicken was very bland.  The chicken clearly needed to marinate in salt and pepper 1st.  Maybe I shouldn't have used the reduced sodium broth...?  In order to make this palitable I added a chicken boullion cube, lots of fresh thyme and some kitchen bouquet browning for color.  I thickend the sauce with a flour/water rue.  Loved the mushrooms. Chicken, not so much. I might try this again with well seasoned chicken 1st.

My boyfriend liked this a lot, but I thought it needed a little extra flavor.  I added crushed red pepper, garlic salt and pepper to the bread crumb mixture before dredging the chicken through it, and I also doubled the sauce so there would be plenty to go over pasta for a side dish.  In the future, I'll add a little more garlic and seasonings to the sauce as well, and maybe some red wine, per other reviewers comments.  Overall, it was very good!

This is really good, especially considering that it is very inexpensive to make. I saute the mushrooms and garlic while I brown the chicken to add a little extra flavor.

I made this and it had no taste at all. Maybe I didn't put in enough spices? The only thing I left out was the clove of garlic. Maybe that's essential to the recipe? I don't know but I didn't like it at all and threw it away.

This has fabulous taste!  I took other posters' advice and doubled the sauce, however, I felt it was a little too runny.  Next time, I'll add a couple more tablespoons of tomato paste and a little less broth.  I used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano & it turned out great!  New family favorite!  Thanks!

This was excellent! My husband and I loved it. I did double the sauce, I saw that a few people recommended that in the past. And there was plenty to go over some noodles we had to go along with it. I also did not take chicken out when finishing sauce, I had some thick breasts and they could use the extra cook time. I just upped the heat to med for about 5 more minutes and PERFECT!

My husband really enjoyed this recipe, but I thought it was too ordinary. The bread crumbs did nothing for the dish and there wasn't enough sauce left over.

I followed the recipe to the letter. The chicken came out very moist. The sauce was okay for me, a bit bland. My hubby really liked it. I felt like it was missing something. I will make it again but probably adjust the sauce a bit by adding a pinch of salt or some other seasoning to add some zing.

This had a very unique flavor. I was excited to try it as soon as I found the recipe and I am so glad that I did. My mom joined us for dinner and everyone in the family enjoyed it a lot.  We couldn't put our fingers on it though... it just had a 'different' flavor. It was very good!

Chicken in a Pot Haiku: "Taste was very 'yawn', I guess it needed more sauce, or double spices." We pleasantly ate this dish but weren't so blown away that I'd go to the trouble to make it again, only b/c there didn't seem to be enough sauce, and the chicken itself was pretty bland, having only been pressed into plain breadcrumbs. In all honesty, the mushrooms were my favorite part; thanks for sharing your recipe though! :-)

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the sauce ingredients based on reviews. I think it was so simple and has a wonderful flavor. I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs and they were ever so moist and tasty. This will become a tasty choice for easy dinner nights

Definitely double the sauce when making 4 pieces of chicken.  I also put some garlic in the oil when cooking the chicken to add a little extra flavor.  Came out great.

Great recipe for a quick dinner. Definitely need to double the sauce. I used a garlic wine seasoning and I only had lemon pepper bread crumbs. I think these two changes enhanced the recipe by giving it a little zing.

Very tasty!  I only changed one thing.  After the chicken was cooked, I added the mushrooms to the skillet with a little more oil and salt and browned them.  I then added the chicken back and continued with the recipe.

This one is a keeper and nice enough to serve to dinner guests! I made this gluten free by putting a couple of slices of gluten free bread in the food processer and worked great for the breading.  The chicken was so tender and full of flavor!  Hard to believe it was this simple to make in such a short amount of time.

Great dish - made some with bread crumbs and some without - great for a low-carb diet.  Doubled the sauce and served over rotini pasta for the kids. Very easy to make and very little clean-up!

This was fantastic!!  I made it exactly as it read, but did double the sauce like other viewers suggested and it was the perfect amount.  This will be added to our go to meals.  Thanks for sharing this yummy treat with us.

I just did not like this.  I would have given it only 2 stars.  The only reason I gave it an additional star is because my 10 year old liked the sauce over pasta and my 5 year old son ate the chicken.  Overall, I just found it to be rather bland and flavorless.  I followed the recipe and made more sauce too.  I don't think I will make this again.

Easy, quick, and minimal cleanup.  Oh, and absolutely delicious!  It was so good we had to break out a bottle of wine to go with it.  This one got printed and stuck in my "frequent use" box.

This was very good and reminded us of Chicken Parmesan.  Per other reviews, I doubled the sauce and served it over rice.  I plan to serve it over pasta next time and top with parmesan.

Awesome!  So easy and very tasty.  I made it with brown rice and a salad, serving the chicken and sauce over the rice.  Made extra sauce - used 1.25 C chicken broth, entire 6oz. can tomato paste, 2 cloves garlic, at least 1 t oregano, a big pinch of salt, and a lot of ground pepper (this made it a bit spicy, which was great!).  I also used matzah meal instead of bread crumbs because it's what I had on hand.  It's a keeper!

My husband said to add it to the regular list of dinner options - he liked the lightness and freshness of it.  I used all of the broth and most of the tomato paste and then doubled everything else - you do need double the broth to serve with rice, pasta, etc.  I always pound the chicken to tenderize it, then cut them in half for manageable pieces - 2 breasts serve 4.  I also egged the chicken before dipping in bread crumbs, then set aside on wax paper to allow crumbs to set in place and get them all done before dropping into pan.

I used Sarah Stephan's recipe for Parmesan Sesame Chicken instead of the directions in this recipe, just because it's my favorite for breaded chicken. I made the sauce in a sauce pan and poured it over the chicken when it came out of the oven... fantastic!! The sauce has wonderful flavor considering the amount of ingredients! I did increase the amount of broth & tomato paste until I had a decent amount of sauce but other than that I made no changes. The next day I put the breaded chicken breast on a bun with some mozzarella cheese and had a chicken sandwich- yum!

The chicken was tender and the flavour was great.  I tried this dish even though I was doubtful, but I am so glad I did.  I did, however, add additional broth as well as basil.

This dish tasted good; it's basically chicken parmesan without the cheese. I liked it but for some reason I thought it was going to be something different. Maybe I didn't read the ingredients carefully. I served it with noodles and parmesan cheese.

I made this dish for dinner and thought that it was quite tasty! I did make some adjustments though...added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the chicken before dredging it with breadcrumbs. I didn't have any tomato paste, so I just used 1/2 can of tomato sauce and doubled the amounts of the herbs and spices for the sauce. I also used a jar of mushrooms instead of fresh and cooked the sauce for 40 minutes. Thought it came out great!

Seriously,  I don't get it.  This wasn't flavorful and the chicken came out kind of dry.  I doubled the sauce, added extra garlic and Italian seasoning and fresh basil-- still bland!

This was pretty good for a really healthy entree.  I did double the sauce (even though I only had 3 chicken breasts).  Turns out I didn't have the tomato paste, so I added extra garlic, pepper, salt and oregano to the broth mixture for more flavor and some cornstarch/water to thicken.  Instead of breadcrumbs, I dredged my chicken in flour seasoned with garlic salt, onion powder, paprika, black pepper, and thyme.  Cooking time was perfect and the chicken was very tender.  Served over whole wheat penne with asparagus.

I added green peppers and crushed red pepper to the dish. I agree that doubling the sauce is really necessary to make enough.

We liked this dish. I added crushed red pepper to the doubled amount of sauce because without it the sauce would be too bland. For the last step, I removed the chicken and added corn starch to thicken the sauce and served it over brown rice. Mmmmm Thr mushrooms really made this dish.

I replaced oregano with dried basil and added sliced red peppers for more veggies. Everything else was kept as is.   It still felt like it was missing something so I added a little cayenne for extra kick.  Even still, I found the recipe to be just about average.  I served it over white rice.  It was easy and quick to make however.

I was hoping this was going to be great but the BF and I agreed it was average, not something that I would make the next night because I just loved it so.  BF actually gave it a 3.5 stars.  I doubled the sauce as recommended by others, followed everything else as written except I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  Served over rice.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my teens favorite chicken dish.  I use 1 cup of chicken or beef broth. We like extra sauce. Plus I use 2 TBS of tomato paste not tomato sauce.  I also substitute basil for oregano.  I have also found that it requires more bread crumbs.  I just used whole wheat bread crumbs last night and it was delish!

A nice throw together meal but neither I or my husband thought that it was great the first night. The leftovers that sat over night in the fridge were much better. I had tripled the sauce (form what others had said) it thickened up and it went really nicely over rice!

My family really loved this recipe.  I was cooking for 5...so I actually tripled the sauce and just barely had enough for the rice.  I thought that the mushrooms would be better sauted and I also added onions, which I thought gave it more flavor.  I'm not sure why others thought that the sauce was not thick enough unless they used tomato sauce instead of paste, because I used paste and it was plenty thick enough.  This is a recipe that we will definitely make again.

Really delicious.  At the last minute I realized I was out of tomato paste and ended up frantically substituting ketchup.  I made one and a half times the sauce based on previous comments.  Also, I reserved a little of the broth and combined it with some corn starch during the reduction phase with made it nice and smooth.  Everyone enjoyed it.

My husband and I thought this was just OK. I doubled the sauce as some reviewers suggested, otherwise I followed the directions exactly. Something was definitely missing. I might try heating the leftovers with some mozzarella and making a sandwich out of it.

Didn't make as much sauce as I would have liked. I also didn't use mushrooms since I didn't have any. Other than that, great recipe.

This was good, but I recommend using less mushrooms.  I served this over noodles.  Next time, I will double the sauce as there was not enough left to go over the noodles.

I used tomato paste in this recipe, it was confusing at first cause one place said tomato sauce then the directions said tomato paste.  I just thought that the paste would help as a thickener.  I also doubled the sauce.  My family loved this!  My son, the picky eater, really liked it.

I skipped bread crumbs and sprinkled flour on chicken cut up in to cubes. Added rosemary as well. When reducing the liquid at the end I added a Tablespoon of butter.  Wonderful.

This is amazing!  My picky children (ages 7 and 9) told me that I could win chopped champion!!!!  This is a huge endorsement from them.  I did double the spices/sauce and it was perfect per the reviews.  Served over spaghetti with warm cornbread muffins.

Amazing recipe! I did a few minor tweaks. I sautéd a white onion before cooking the chicken. That way, once I cooked the chicken, it would add more flavor. Then I doubled the sauce ingredients. Once the sauce was added to the chicken, I also added the cooked onion as well. The results were delicious!

This was a big hit for my family. I omitted the breadcrumbs because we did not want to have the added carbs. We figured it was not going to add much to the dish. We will be making this again and adding this to our low-carb rotation!

This recipe is so simple and yet so delicious over rice. It has become one of our regular-rotation weeknight staple dinners...one of those "magic" recipes that somehow tastes complex and scrumptious but comes together so easily. I did double the sauce recipe to accommodate the rice. Love this!

This was fine. I used chicken thighs and doubled the sauce like others suggested. It needs more salt. If making again, I would not use the breadcrumbs. Made things mushy and just was not necessary to make the dish good.

This was just OK--Although the sauce had good flavor, it was too watery.  The chicken was dry--I think it would have been better with chicken fillets instead of breasts.

It was a hit with the family.
I did double the sauce, and sautéd the mushrooms and garlic in a little extra butter after the chicken was browned. Deglazed the pan with the sauce mix then added the chicken back to the pan.  Thickened it with a little corn starch slurry at the end.

Not sure why this has high ratings. I read the reviews so I doubled the sauce. The sauce was just OK. My husband loves mushrooms and he thought it was just OK too.  The sauce never thickened so I added some corn starch.   Don't know if I would make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly. Not sure I liked the bread crumbs. Maybe just leave them out.  The flavors were great though so I'll keep this one saved to play with later.

This was surprisingly delicious for how easy it was to prepare. I doubled the sauce and substituted Italian seasoning for Oregano, and I also used Italian bread crumbs. Will definitely make again.

This is a lovely chicken dish that had a rustic feel to it. The sauce had a nice depth of flavor from deglazing the pan and reducing the sauce. Definitely double to sauce because after reducing there’s not near as much as you would think. By doubling there was enough sauce for 4 chicken breasts. I prefer and used thin chicken breasts which sautéed up nicely. I also decreased the amount of pepper and used roasted garlic tomato paste. Served with white rice and steamed herb & butter broccoli. My husband and 12 yo son gobbled this up and so did I. Refreshing change from boring chicken entrees!

Delicious! After reading over reviews, I double the sauce ingredients. We only used corn bread crumbs as the bread crumb and it worked great. I’ll definitely make this dish again. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good.  It also reminded me of a dish from my childhood, probably something my grandmother made.  I used tomato sauce instead of paste because that's what I had.  I also omitted the bread crumbs.  I should have increased the amount of sauce as suggested by reviewers.  Served over whole grain rice and it was delicious!

Cacciatore or roux?  Kids liked it, husband and I felt something was missing even with green beans and rice in the mix.  Spicing this up with bell peppers, onions and Italian seasoning or Cajun seasoning should help.  

**update**  Tried it again exactly like the recipe with San Marzano tomatoes instead of the tomato paste and was a hit!  No green beans or rice.  Now...I don’t think it needs peppers or onions either.  Guess it was just the processed paste.  Served it  with broccolini & a salad.  Simple, easy & delicious! ??????????

My family is on a strict low carb diet, so I made changes.  Butterflied the chicken breasts to cook faster.  Pan fried the chicken and removed from pan.  Sauted mushrooms, onions and green pepper.  Added chicken back to pan and added 1 can of rotel tomatoes with juice, cooked them together to let the flavors meld.  Did not use chicken broth or any thickening agent.   1 tsp seasoning salt and 2 tsp greek seasoning.  Did not serve over rice or noodles because that adds carbs.  Family said the result was fantastic.

Planned this meal around mushrooms in my fridge that needed to get used....got the whole thing ready and pulled out the mushrooms....it was too late.  Substituted cauliflower and it worked beautifully.  Look forward to having good mushrooms to try next time!

have made these at least weekly since first seeing recipe. minor changes,  did not use bread crumbs simply seasoned chicken and browned it in small amount of olive oil, removed from pot, added fresh mushrooms and garlic, let garlic slowly reduce and release their flavor/aroma,  put chicken back in and added broth, paste and seasoning. cover and simmer, serve over rice, noodles, orzo. can add options and/or peppers. great sauce, render flavorful chicken. easy, easy, easy. big family favorite. agree with others, increase sauce measurement.

Very good and easy to put together. Like others, I doubled the sauce. I used a little closer to 2 Tablespoons of olive oil rather than 2 teaspoons. I also added about 1 Tablespoon of corn starch to the final broth for thickening. Served with garlic mashed potatoes.

Loved the flavor. And it was so easy.  I followed the recipe except that I used chicken tenders and added a splash of red wine to the sauce. I served it over mashed potatoes. Didn't need to double sauce. SOOO GOOD.

So maybe I'm the only one but the directions are not written well!  I'm confused and mine did not turn out great!  I should add flipping my chicken took all the breading off.  Maybe need something else to help the breading stick.

I made this exactly as written, but used 2 chicken breasts because it was for 2.  There was more than enough chicken broth following the directions for 2, but may have wanted more for 4.

It was only okay for me.  I pounded the chicken and it was not dry, but there just wasn't enough flavor.  Next time I might add more seasoning or more salt, but if it doesn't help the next time, I won't make it again.

It was easy to make, so if I can improve the flavor it will be a keeper. As is, only 3*s.

I bought skinless, boneless chicken thighs. I had this ready to go in 1/2 hour. I did double the sauce and mushrooms. My husband actually told our friends about how good it was.

This isn't something I would make again. It wasn't awful, but definitely not a 4.5 star recipe. If you're going to try it, make some rice with it. the mushrooms aren't enough of a side and you need something to catch the sauce.

Easy, quick & delish! I had a package of 7 boneless chicken breasts and put them in a zip-lock bag with an egg to coat them before dredging them in breadcrumbs.  I used a 15oz can of  chicken broth & a small can of tomato paste. We had some whole wheat linguine and salad with it, and everyone loved it! We'll definitely have this again!

With having all the ingredients, I decided d to give this a try.  After reading several reviews, I did change the cooking process, but not the ingredients.  I cooked the chicken in a separate pan.  Made the sauce, poured it over the chicken then added fresh mozzarella. Cooked for about 20 minutes in the oven till the cheese was melted.  Served with spaghetti/garlic bread.  Also I did increase the sauce.

Easy to make for sure.  I only had a tube of spicy tomato paste so used that instead of regular paste.  I also had plum tomatoes that needed to be used so threw them in at the end.  Although we only made for two, I doubled the sauce.  I thought the sauce would be thickened but it didn't so ended up adding some corn starch.  I would make it again.

The pasta and sauce was okay... but the chicken was soggy. This would be so much better to make it with skin and bone in chicken pieces (like thighs), and nix the breading. The skin and marrow of the chicken bones give so much more flavor. And chicken with skin and bones is a lot less expensive too. I usually do no make many boneless chicken dishes, unless I am using diced pieces of chicken (for a stir fry for example). Also needed way more sauce. Could be preference.

This is a great recipe - easy, delicious and quick to prepare.  I'm glad I took other reviewers' suggestion to increase the sauce.  We're partial to garlic, so next time I'll add more.  I had some fresh parsley on hand so I added it at the end for color.  Other than that, no changes.  Thanks for a great dish!

Doubled the sauce but thought it was a bit bland will try to make again and try to up the flavor profile, maybe some pepper flakes along with some extra Italian seasoning.

After reading some really good reviews on this, I was excited to try it and expected it to be something really good, but unfortunately I was disappointed.  I doubled the sauce as everyone suggested, so it was plenty of sauce but it never reduced down.  It was more of a broth, very liquidy and not much flavor to it at all.  We kept tasting it and adding more spices but it just wasn't flavorful and just not that great. I'm not interested in making it again and my boyfriend said he wouldn't be upset if I didn't make it again. His son, on the other hand said he actually kinda liked it and that the sauce reminded him of the deer stew that his grandpa makes.

Pretty tasty and very simple to make. Breadcrumbs add very little. Think I would coat chicken in flour instead, which might also help thicken the sauce. I also used a bit of cooking wine to deglaze frying pan/"pot"...
Basic taste is oregano and tomato, but you can vary this and use leeks and mushrooms without those 2, making a very tasty variation of this in one "pot".

Definitely a good base recipe to start out with, but again like others say you definitely need to make changes. I doubled the sauce mixture, using about two cartons worth of chicken broth, 3 6 oz cans of tomato paste, and seasoned it with garlic powder, oregano, italian seasoning, cayenne, thyme, s&p, and one minced garlic clove. I pounded 4 chicken breasts so they would cook better evenly and sauteed them in olive oil with 4 minced garlic cloves, onions and mushrooms til no pink was there. In the breadcrumbs mixture I also added some garlic powder, steak seasoning and creole seasoning. I simmered the chicken and mushrooms for about 30 minutes- note that I didn't end up using all the sauce, as it would have overflowed my skillet, so I used about 3/4 of it. I cooked some noodles while it simmered, then put everything in a pan including the noodles to thicken the mixture and baked it in the oven with parmesan cheese on top for about 20 minutes at 390 degrees. Turned out really good, I would say 5 stars with changes, but 4 without. Don't be afraid of adding something new, as you never know how good it will turn out if you don't! :)

I took the advice of other reviews and doubled the sauce using a whole 6 oz can of tomato paste. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. We liked it and I will prepare this again with more herbs next time. I have an Italian Seasoning Blend that would work wonderfully in adding additional flavor.

My boyfriend loved this recipe! Made it with canned mushrooms because I didn't have fresh but still tasted great. Served it with mashed potatoes and french cut green beans. Next time I will try fresh mushrooms with rice and corn. Easy and excellent.

This recipient was quick and simple!  I don't normally use salt but I did add some. Not as much as the recipe called for. It was tasty but a little bland. Next time I make it, I'll add more salt but will also  saute' some onions with it. I think that would be a great addition.

I added about 1/4 cup of  Srirach sauce and tripled the garlic.  Very good!  Only four stars because of  the addition of Sriracha.  Rather bland without it.

I followed other users advice and doubled the sauce. I think next time I would 1.5 the sauce. A good fast, simple meal.

My husband really liked it.  I am not a big chicken fan and I would cut the chicken breasts up more or use a tenderloin. The sauce was very good though.

Followed the recipe except doubled the sauce as many have suggested.  Seemed a bit bland to us.  It was just ok.   Probably won't make again.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the sauce. That proved to be an adequate amount for the four breasts.  The flavor was good but I would not rate it as great. I would add slightly more tomato paste, increase the oregano by a pinch and taste for salt. I will make this again because of its simplicity and because it uses only one pot. Clean up was a breeze!

Good recipe.  Only thing I did differently was remove the mushrooms (kids don't like them) and added chopped up sweet peppers instead.  Put it over top of rice.  We all really liked it and it was pretty easy.  I will be keeping this one in favorites.

As per other reviews I doubled the sauce which was a good thing.  Also, I didn't bread the chicken.  This was just okay to me.  Basically chicken in a tomato sauce, nothing special. Will not repeat.

I added a half of white onion and cooked the baby portables together with the onions then put them aside. I used a whole 8oz can tomato sauce a little over a cup of chicken broth and more of the dry seasonings I didn't have any tomato paste that's why I used sauce I like spicy so also added couple dashes of crushed red pepper mixed well put that aside, then  dredged chicken in breadcrumbs and thru them in a big skillet and after browning pored in the broth mixture and let it cook the chicken thoroughly then added mushrooms and onions cooked longer to get the sauce to thicken then put a slice of baby Swiss on each piece.  Can't wait to do it again, loved it then and ate last piece for lunch today, it was extremely excellent. Thank you for the recipe and all the reviews the reviews are so helpful.

Meal was delicious!  I used 2 and a half tablespoons of tomato paste and at the end of it I use the little flour  and water to thicken up the juice and shrooms to pour over the chicken.  Served with Italian bread and butter.   Had a piece of chicken left over which I sliced long ways, added more breadcrumbs  and fried in a little bit of oil and put it back in the sauce and it was equally as good as the first day.  PMS

Excellent dish. I agreed with several of the other reviewers : double up on the broth and tomato paste; otherwise you'll barely have any sauce to enjoy with the chicken.

Used bone in chicken breasts for more flavor and simmered for 40 minutes.  Doubled sauce and used roasted garlic tomato paste, but omitted mushrooms as the family doesn't like them. Delicious!

Delicious and easy. I used split chicken breast because that was what I had at the time. After simmering for a while , I pulled the meat off the bones and let it all simmer on low until we were ready to eat and it was so tender and good. I made more sauce as suggested. Will definitely be making this again and again.

This is really tasty.  I also doubled the sauce.  I used 4  thighs instead of breasts, did not use breadcrumbs because I didn't have it on hand.  I sautéed the onion and garlic and mushrooms first and sprinkled that with balsamic vinegar. After mushrooms were cooked, Removed from pan, and browned the meat. Then added veggies and added the sauce in.  Added cornstarch to thicken at the end. So dang good!!

After reading all of the reviews I was waiting for this to be amazing ... instead I found it incredibly bland with barely any real flavor. I doubled up the sauce like everyone else had suggested but I still found that it was severely lacking in flavor, and was very watery. For anyone making it consider putting a pre made jar of tomato sauce just to thicken it.

I will definitely make this dish again.  It was nice and spicy, with the tomato paste and pepper.  I did change it slightly by not breading the chicken.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before sauteing it.  The sauce thickened quite nicely without the additional reduction time.  In all, it took about 45 minutes from start to finish (the first time!).  As I become more familiar with the recipe, I am sure it will take 30 minutes tops.

I always say I'm not really a cook, I'm just good at following directions. As such I love dishes that are easy to follow but make you come off like you really know what you're doing. 

I made this exactly as described, except I used beef broth (what I had on hand) and left off the mushrooms. My rating is for the dish as written, but I did sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese into my sauce just for kicks. 

As this was my first time I didn't want to make a lot, so I thought the amount of sauce was just enough. But I wasn't putting it over anything but the chicken breasts. I did a veggie side to keep the whole dish high protein and low carb. Saving this one!

Easy and good. Since consensus was that this delicious sauce deserved doubling or more, I used 1 c homemade chicken stock, 1 c water, ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp pepper, 1 tsp oregano, 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 slice onion (minced), 1+ Tbsp marinara, 1+ Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, ½ tsp BBQ sauce, ½ tsp sweet & tangy mustard. I had two large breast halves mostly thawed so cut them in half horizontally and sprinkled w/ Italian breadcrumbs. I heated oil, added chicken (breadcrumbs side down) and sprinkled other side w/ breadcrumbs. I browned both sides lightly, not cooking chicken through, and removed chicken to a plate while I poured sauce mixture in and scraped the pan, then put the chicken back to cook through while the sauce simmered. No mushrooms on hand, but added slices of sweet pepper last couple of min. Served w/ wild rice blend and corn. Didn't cook sauce down at end so mine was thin - I ladled it on my chicken and rice, husband ate some, big kid was gone, and picky kid ate chicken w/o sauce, and I had extra, but right amount if cooking down and four eating it.

I made this for a friend recovering from surgery and her husband and my wife and me.  Made extra sauce as recommended by several reviewers and served it over basmati rice with summer squash as a side vegetable.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  The sauce has an excellent flavor that works well with rice.  Be sure to make enough sauce, as it is the key to this recipe.

I thought it was a good start, but added more garlic, and sauteed the mushrooms with a shallot.  I dredged the chicken in flour instead of bread crumbs.  I didn't thicken the sauce at all.  It was good.  Not sure it's a keeper for my family, though.

I made this and followed previous suggestions and doubled the sauce. There is no need to bread the chicken either since it simmers in the sauce and mushrooms. Instead I seasoned the EVOO that I saluted the chicken in prior to adding the sauce and mushrooms.  I served with Angelhair.

I loved this and will make it again! I read the reviews and decided I wanted more sauce. I used a 32oz box of chicken broth (low sodium) and two sm cans of tomato paste. I increased the garlic to 5 cloves and increased the spices as well. We like basil so I added it and parsley. I also made sure that I used Italian bread crumbs. It also took me longer to brown it to the desired color of brown. I didn't want to cook a separate vegetable so I threw in a tiny can of sweet peas at the end and served it over pasta. This was excellent and I can't wait to eat the leftovers! YUM!

I made this "as is" with a few additions.  I added 1/2 finely chopped onion with the mushrooms, 1/4 cup wine in the sauce and because my husband and I like spicy food, I added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne and 1 tsp of cajun spice.  I served this on a bed of vegetable style rotini noodles and added garlic bread on the side.  It turned out very good.

We enjoyed this for dinner tonight.  Served it with rice along side and we used some of the tasty sauce over our rice too.  I like not only the taste of the recipe but the fact that it has common ingredients which I had on hand. Yummy and super easy!

Not a lot of flavor.  I served over rice and would cook the rice in chicken broth next time to give the dish more flavor.  I sautéed onions and added a splash of wine because the sauce was bland.  I read several of the reviews and hoped I would have the same same success with my family as they did.

This was VERY easy and VERY good! I followed the recipe, the only changes I made were adding more mushrooms and of course, I added more garlic. I always add more garlic. I was very yummy and I will make it again. =)

Great dish. The only ingredient I added was white wine as I do with almost all my meat recipes.  I doubled the sauce ingredients as per suggestions I read.

I really liked it, a new flavor combo for boring chicken. Hubby thought it was just okay, but hey! He didn't run to slather it with a gallon of hot sauce so I think most folks will like it.

This was an easy version of chicken cacciatore but lacked a bit in flavour. I cut the chicken breasts into large strips and doubled the sauce but followed the recipe otherwise. I don't think the bread crumbs added much as they didn't stay on the chicken.

I didn't use bread crumbs, just seasoned the chicken before sautéing and I tripled the sauce. Served over rice with a salad. I thought it was delicious!

Pretty good overall.  I made this as directed and only doubled the sauce.  It would have never been enough otherwise.  The next time, I will use some red wine in the sauce and reduce for more complexity of flavor.

Yum. As others have mentioned, I had to double the sauce amounts to make sure it was sufficient for me. I used 2 chicken breasts pounded flat and cut in half. It was super easy to make and really good - I did have to increase the salt as it was a bit bland, and I also added bell peppers to increase the veggie content. But overall would make again!

This turned out great! I followed advice of reviewers and doubled sauce. Also, I sauteed my mushrooms in some butter and marsala wine. Then I added them to the sauce. Wife and son loved it.

Loved this recipe, served with mashed potato for adults and noodles for kids.  Doubled the sauce, next time may triple.  My kids don't like mushroom, so didn't use too many, but was good with just a few.  Easy to make.  Will make again.

SOOO GOOD.   I tripled the sauce with 11 chicken thighs.
I floured instead of breaded chicken, and sautéed mushrooms before chicken and added later.  So good. Served over Mashed
Potato Dream from this site.  Lots of sauce for sure, but good to freeze some for another night. Will definitely  be making again.

Sauce was great! Only thing I can say, if you like mushrooms and sauce, I would double the recipe. My boyfriend and I were very happy with the sauce (just wish there had been more!)

I liked the taste, but the sauce did not cone out right. Used tomato sauce but perhaps it should have been paste. The recipe used both terms which makes it confusing.

I have made this many times and it never disappoints. I always make more of the sauce because I like it served over rice and the sauce is so good. Served it with some green vegetables. Very good.

I've made this a few times now.. I usually end up making a double batch of the sauce because I like a bit more than what's called for...totally personal preference..But either way it's very tasty and easy. I also have added green olives , capers and Cumin to it. adds such a great flavor.

I think this is probably the best chicken dish I've ever made! I took the advice from other reviewers and doubled the sauce, however next time I will even triple it because I only had 3 chicken breast halves this time and it was barely enough. Great easy recipe! Excellent flavor! I ended up adding a touch of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken up a bit which gave it the perfect consistently. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

SO delicious! As per other comments, I doubled the sauce and added some wine to the sauce. Also some garlic salt to taste. Chicken was so moist and sauce was fantastic! Definitely making again and again.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  The chicken was so succulent, and the sauce complimented it effortlessly. Do yourself a favor and double the sauce, as suggested by other other reviewers. You'll be glad you did. So delicious!

Big hit, since this was my first time making this type of dish, I thought it was easy prep,easy to follow since I have basic skills. And it turned out great. I think I would like more heat, but since some of my family accuse me of being able to eat lava I'll have to keep it tame.

I thought this lacked flavor for me. You are almost better off just pan frying the chicken and than sauté the mushrooms.

Surprisingly good - the taste is greater than the sum of its ingredients.  I took another reviewer's advice and made more sauce.  Next time I will do this but not add quite as much broth.  3 C brother, 8oz tomato paste, 1 t pepper, 3t dried oregano, 6-7 cloves garlic.

This had a nice homey feel to it. However, it was a little under-seasoned Sauteed in some PAM spray-oil instead. Nice and super easy for a beginner cook, such as myself.

I really enjoyed this. Very flavorful and so fast and easy to make. I just served it with green beans. INext time I won't include the bread crumbs, because even my husband didn't know there was any, and next time I won't season the chicken because it wound up being too salty. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious.  I have made this twice.  The first time as directed and loved it.  This time with slight modification.  I had 8 large thighs.  I coated them lightly with flour mixed with salt and pepper and browned them in batches in my stock pot.  I then used about 2 splashes of white wine to get those nice browned bits off the bottom and added the sauce and chicken.  I made a much bigger batch of sauce....about 5x the recipe:  4 cups of chicken broth, a small can of tomatoe paste, 5x the spices, 6 cloves of garlic minced and about a pound of mushrooms.  I did add a small can of tomatoe sauce, too, this time. I love the flavor and lightness of the sauce.  Served with thin spaghetti, salad and italian bread to sop up the sauce.  Thanks for this....hubby and sons love it!

Pic looked great and I expected the meal to be fabulous based on all the wonderful reviews, but sadly I was disappointed! I followed everything step by step (at first) and I found it to be very bland...so I had to make some additions...and "spice it up"!!  I added some fresh thyme, fresh and powdered onion, fresh red peppers, increased the garlic cloves to 6-7 pieces along with the powder...threw in a little white sugar (1 tsp).  Dashed in some Jamaican Chicken Seasoning, ketchup, parmesan cheese and tabasco/cayenne pepper in the sauce.  I wish I can give measurements, but I can't!!

Good but not good enough to keep in the recipe rotation. In fact, my husband told me the recipe wasn't worth keeping at all. I think you could skip the bread crumbs all together since they turn to mush and add only empty calories. The flavor was just ok and I added red wine to the sauce too. Other than that I made exactly to the recipe.

This recipe was just OK. I followed exactly as stated with the exception of doubling the sauce. Several reviewers have stated that it was bland. I did not think it was bland it was just too common. It almost reminded me of school lunch or hospital cafeteria food. I'm not sure why but my chicken was even a little dry. While we did eat the meal and it wasn't horrible, it also wasn't scrumptious. I will not be making this on again.

Was just ok.  I made it as directed except I didn't take the chicken out of the sauce to thicken.  I also doubled the sauce based on the other reviews.  Definitely need to do that! My husband added some parm cheese and italian seasoning to his plate and he even said it was still missing something.  I thought it was ok.  Nothing fantastic.  Just different than the usual dinner.  If I make again, I will probably add some cayenne pepper, italian seasoning, onion powder, and maybe some more garlic.  Just to add a kick of flavor.

This was delicious and incredibly easy! Really didn't change much, just doubled the sauce ingredients and swapped the oregano for italian seasoning since I'm not overly fond of oregano on its own. I added some Parmesan cheese to the breading as well. Definitely will make this again and again.

Hubby made this for dinner last night, he made it exactly as written except maybe a few extra mushrooms which we both love.  It was excellent.  This is going to be a regular at our place.  Thanks for an awesome and easy recipe.

Amazing!  The first time I made this, I used a pan with a lid that wasn't completely sealed.  Because of this, a lot of the liquid evaporated and I didn't have to cook the sauce any extra time, but the chicken was still juicy and fully of flavor.

We just finished supper and my husband loved it! The only minor change I  did was that I used low sodium chicken broth.  Some sauces tend to be too salty for my taste.  But other than that I cooked as directed.

Easy recipe that I enjoyed. I used 2 cloves of garlic and fresh oregano. My boyfriend thought it tasted like tomato soup :(

DELICIOUS recipe!  Next time I think the chicken will only need 15 mins. to simmer.  I also added some cornstarch/water to the sauce at the end to speed up the thickening and make it more like gravy.  I think I'll add more mushrooms too - I like mushrooms.  This recipe has the perfect amount of tomato and great flavor!!!

Delicious!! My husband and kids loved it.  I took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the bread crumbs.  It tasted fine like that.  I also doubled the sauce.  Will definitely put this in my regular rotation of recipes.

just made this for dinner tonight..it was so easy and quick. I also had almost all the ingredients in my pantry already, which is nice. My family loved it, the only suggestion my husband had was it needed some heat..i would put some red pepper flakes in for the simmer next time. Its a keeper in my house! Happy cooking all:)

I found this recipe on here and knew we would love it.  I have made it once a week since discovering it.  I have tried tweaking the recipe to our taste.  I add an extra clove of garlic and add a bit of chilli powder. Yum yum.  Hubby's favourite meal now.

I love this dish - I can remember this from when I was a kid.  The seasonings were a bit different, and the method.. pretty much the same except it was made in a large cast iron skillet, we didnt remove the chicken and at the end we'd pop the skillet in the oven with some swiss or cheddar or whatever was on hand and bake until the cheese was melted - which seemed like an eternity when you're a kid, but was probably 5 minutes :)

Really good.  My kids loved it, but made some changes.  I read others who said double the sauce....well, that still didn't look like much for rice, so I dumped the rest of the paste in and poured more broth until I got the right consistency I was looking for.  Great flavors!  A keeper for sure!

This was a nice change of pace for chicken.  Easy to make and family enjoyed it.  I'll prob make this again to switch things up.  I served with rice and doubled the sauce like everyone suggested.

When i first started blending the seasonings it tasted bland. as recommended i doubled the ingredients and as it cooked it started to taste a lot better. i put mozzarella on top and let it cook in the oven for 5 min and it was delicious. Thanks

This was very good. The only thing I did different was double the tomato paste/chicken broth combo. The only complaint is that the liquid was too juicy, it needed to be a little thicker. My kids all liked it so that alone is a HUGE plus! They had theirs over rice, hubby & I had ours over whole wheat pasta. I will definitely make this again!

Even though I forgot to add the garlic, it was really good. I served it with rice, but next time I wll serve it with pasta, because it is more of an italian dish. also I thnk it would be yummy with some motzrella melted over the chicken.

I served this last night along with rice and peas  that I had cooked in chicken broth. It was fantastic...everyone agreed it was a dish to make again and again! I did double the sauce (because we like to spoon it over the rice as well), but did not change any ingredients. I don't understand why some folks felt this didn't have much flavor. It also tasted great as leftovers for lunch today!

This was excellent. The chicken stayed very moist and the sauce and mushrooms were delicious served over it. I'm not a mushroom lover but I really enjoyed this dish!  As I predicted, one out of three kids liked it (typical). She even had seconds. I served it with a quinoa pilaf.

I really wasn't sure about this one, and offered to order a pizza if it didn't turn out - but my husband, who is a picky eater proclaimed it as excellent!  Very easy - serve it over rice, and as others suggested, doubled the sauce.  I think I would like to try adding spinach or zucchini next time to get more veggies in our diet.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty good! I added a little brown sugar and some white wine. Next time I am thinking about adding a few more veggies (e.g., zuchinni, squash, onion). I also added some corn starch to thickin' up the sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

Probably my new favorite for chicken. Budget friendly, fast and easy. Thickened sauce at the end with a little cornstarch and it was fantastic over stiff mashed potatoes. Great recipe Jo Ann! Thanks!

Not sure what the fuss was about, I'd rate this one a 'meh'. I doubled the sauce as others did, and it was barely enough for four people. The sauce was ok, nothing to write home about. The breading gets all mushy on the chicken, which kind of grossed out the kids. If I were to make it again (probably won't), I'd maybe prepare the components separately... saute mushrooms and get them brown for flavor and add to reduced sauce... brown chicken breasts separately and sauce them just before serving (doing away with mushy coating).

Didn't go over well with hubby.  The chicken was great and the sauce was great but put them together and it was mediocre.  The sauce is a good start for something else.

Loved this recipe! Fast and easy. I used fresh mushrooms, 2 garlic cloves, doubled the sauce, and used italian style breadcrumbs. Served over white rice. Chicken was juicy, not at all dried out. The family loved it!

The chicken came out juicy, but I think the sauce could use much more flavor.  Would make again.

Yummy! I cooked it exactly as the recipe states except I was out of mushrooms. This will be a staple at our house and my 4 year old ate her entire portion.

I made this dish as the recipe dictated with the exception of adding white pepper. I thought it was nothing spectacular but my husband -loved- it. Next time I will add fresh tomatoes and peppers for my own tastes.

Great recipe!  Simple and quick to prepare.  The only changes I made were to pound the chicken breasts to cook them more evenly, and as many others did, I also doubled the sauce recipe.  It was great over whole wheat pasta!

this was delicious! i sauteed onions and garlic before adding to the tomato mixture, added a splash of red wine (as per another reviewer), and hit the sauce with red pepper flakes for a delicious kick. while these changes are personal preference, i'm sure the original recipe would be just as excellent. i plan to use my leftover sauce and rice tomorrow night with some sauteed shrimp. thanks for this new addition to my recipe box!

Pretty good. I dont like mushrooms very much but my boyfriend does. So when spooning out the sauce I gave him the mushrooms and put just the sauce on mine and it was pretty good.

I doubled the sauce and added fresh chopped basil right before I served it.  Next time I might omit the breadcrumbs and substitute regular salt and pepper to help better flavor the chicken.

Yum!  Doubled the sauce.  I sauteed an onion and 5 cloves of garlic & added to the sauce mixture before browning boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I used seasoned flour to coat chicken instead of bread crumbs. Easy & delicious weeknight recipe.

This. Was. Amazing. We have decided to rotate it into our regular meals. I can't believe how much I liked it considering how few ingredients it called for, and it was relatively easy. I made a few changes, such as doubling the sauce (a necessity!) based on previous reviews and I added an onion and the garlic to the pan with the chicken to get some good flavor. I used italian flavored breadcrumbs and italian seasoning as well as a few shakes of some red pepper flakes. We served this over noodles and I was in heaven. Thanks for a great recipe!

This wasn't exactly what I was expecting by the title, "Chicken in a Pot."  But, it was good and easy.  I had plenty  sauce (but I only put it over the chicken, not rice or pasta as others do).  I think a little extra garlic would be good.  We liked it and will probably make it again.

I would give this recipe 3.5 stars, but I took some liberties with it.  Per many reviewers' advice, I doubled the recipe and added 3 tomatoes (reducing broth by 1/2 cup to adjust for add'l liquid from tomatoes).  This ended up being too watery and washed away the bread crumbs.  I will try the recipe's suggestion next time.  I also used chicken thighs instead of breast and that was fine.  Simmering for 20 minutes didn't seem to cook the meat through enough, so I increased the heat to high and boiled for another 15 minutes.

A delicately flavored dish. Compiled and cooked according to recipe it was Perfect. 
If one's taste leans towards a dish heavy on sauce then do double the sauce ingredients.  But as it is - a nice accent to the chicken.

This recipe was just ok at best.  It seemed to be missing something - there was not a lot of flavor.  Very easy to prepare and healthy but not sure I'll ever make it again.

This seems way too simple to be so good!  The only thing I changed was to use flour instead of bread crumbs to dredge the chicken, but I also doubled the sauce.  Even my picky eater loved the sauce over brown rice.  I'm always looking for EASY and new ways to prepare chicken - this is definitely a keeper!

I altered this recipe some. I used a can of diced tomatoes, 2 large cloves of garlic, 1 tbs oregano, 1 tbs basil, 4 drops tabasco, 2 cans of mushrooms. I prepared the meat the way mentioned here. I would suggest not bothering with the breadcrumbs. it is just an extra mess. Fry it 2 min on both sides and then blot off the extra grease with a paper towel. then add to the mixture. I didnt put it over anything and it was still really good. Overall, a quick meal with little prep and yummy!

This was very good.  I forgot to save it in my recipe file and have been serching for it all week.  I doubled the sauce recipe and cut the chicken into bite size chuncks before frying and served over speghetti.  It was excellent.

Much better than I thought it would be! Doubled the sauce due to other recommendations as well as pounded the breasts thinner. Turned out GREAT! We served the chicken on bow tie pasta and it was delicious.

The sauce was pretty bland and runny, so as I was cooking it I threw in some corn starch to thicken it up, red pepper flakes, and about half a shot of sake... I also simmed it 10 minutes longer (thick piece of chicken). Next time I'll pound out the chicken so it cooks evenly. So good!

I will make this again. I agree that the sauce needs to be doubled. The flavor was good. Reminded me of chicken Parmesan. My son loved it.

this was a great recipe. it was easy to follow and the results were great.  I served it over rice but i think next time i will accompany it with spaghetti. My boys really liked it. I gave it five stars because it was easy and simple and because this recipe also works great with your own add ons.   Thanks for a nice easy great tasting recipe.

I loved this recipe!  It was simple enough that my 6 year old did most of the work under my supervision.  It looked beautiful and tasted great.  This will be something that gets made often in our home.

I gave it a 4 star because my husband loved it on a bed of rice, me on the other hand, I only found it to be fair, the sauce was good on rice, but the chicken really didnt pick up the flavor. I can say I would probably make it again, since my 8 year old said, yum I think it's good, dont throw it out LOL!!

Delicious and easy to prepare! I used two chicken breasts keeping the ratio of the remaining ingredients the same, since most reviews suggested more sauce to chicken.  I also cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces before breading and sautéing, to allow the sauce’s flavor to enhance more of the chicken. All served over rice that was made with the left over canned chicken broth. Yummy! Next time I’m going to try it without adding the 1/8 teaspoon of salt, given that the broth already had plenty of salt.

Ok this recipe rocks. YOU MUST DOUBLE sauce recipe though. Alot of the chicken broth evaporated by the time the sauce is thick enought. Very YUMMY. I added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning too. Really wonderful.

Chicken turned out nice and moist. Great sauce, I just substituted canned mushrooms for fresh because that's all I had.

Oh dear, I am sorry to be among those who did not really care for this as written; as others noted who also didn't care for this dish, there didn't seem to be a whole lot of flavor.  I ended up doubling the tomato paste and the listed spices; it still tasted rather plain to me, and then I added basil and thyme.  Much, much better! Based on my modifications, I would make this again.

This recipe was very easy to make. I followed the previous advice to double the sauce and the mushrooms. My husband thought it could have used more salt.  My mother in law thought the sauce needed more substance. Next time I think I will add some spaghetti sauce or crushed tomatos to add some more bulk to the sauce. I will make this again for sure.

Wow!  Did I ever get the compliments from my husband tonight after serving him this meal or what!  He liked it so much he wants us to invite friends over and serving them this meal...

This is what I did...I doubled the recipe for 4 chicken breasts and served it over a bed of linguini.  I didn't have any fresh mushrooms on hand so I replaced it with frozen mixed veggies that I defrosted in the microwave before adding it to the pot with the sauce mixture.  I did not let the sauce reduce since I was using it over the linguini.  The chicken was tender and moist and very flavourful.  This recipe will definately go down as one of my favorites.

I was looking for a lower fat, low cal recipe that didn't taste lowfat/lowcal. This really fit the bill. I added some chopped fresh tomatoes during the last 5 minutes of cooking then added a couple tablespoons of grated parmesan to help thicken up the sauce, which I served over fresh low fat spinach and cheese ravioli. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this for my husband and it was excellent.  Hubby loved it.  I agree with everyone that there is not enough sauce.  I think I will modify it for the crockpot somehow.  I served it over brown rice.  Yummy.

I loved this dish!  It was incredibly moist and tender.  I pounded the chicken.  I wish I would have let the chicken simmer a bit longer though because my boyfriend's piece wasn't cooked all the way through.  Also, I think the breading made a big difference unlike previous reviewers...I used panko crumbs... seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning.  Yum!  I'm having for lunch today.

I changed the scale of this recipe to 6 since I have a larger family and followed it exactly except for adding chopped onions along with the mushrooms. I served it over fettucini, along with a tossed salad and bread. My family liked it, but didn't rave over it or anything. I will make it again, though, and the next time I will pound the chicken thinner before breading it and add more spices. Then I think it would be excellant!

Made this recipe for dinner and we liked it very much.  I didn't change or add anything! I used tomato paste and watched it as it was boiling down..once it was thick enough I turned the fire off.

made this dish for dinner tonight, substituting some ingredients and it came out really good....it was a different taste, but an enjoyable one,  we ate way to much...Rose said it was excellent so I take that as a compliment coming from her...
The next time I make this I will double the sauce that you make as I really don't think there was enough after it simmered for 20 minutes, but enough for 1 breast a piece, which was plenty for us...I did not have the tomato sauce that it called for, so I used marinara sauce, nor did I have any oregano, so I just used what seasoning I had to my taste...if you should try it, I do hope it turns out as well as mine....Hope you all are having a good evening.
Love and Huggs
Cee
P.S. This also would have been real good with roasted peppers with the mushrooms
