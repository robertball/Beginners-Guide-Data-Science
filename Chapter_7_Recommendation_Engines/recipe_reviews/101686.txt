A quick & delicious pork recipe!  I halved the recipe and followed the recipe exactly.  I did need to cook the pork a little longer.  Very tasty.  I served it with orzo with a little pesto and fresh green beans.  I'll definitely make this one again.

This was a great recipe for a good, quick meal.  The pork turned out perfect, and the sauce was a perfect compliment.
