Great recipe!!  The garbanzo filling was so easy to make and very tasty on its own.  I made the mistake of thawing the pastry dough too early, so when I tried to separate the sheets, they were stuck together.  In desperation, with company coming in two hours, I pinched off the dough into balls, and rolled them out into circles and stuffed them with the filling, and pinched the edges, and baked as directed.  This was much better than as directed in the recipe, and makes more samosas.  I did make the samosas once per recipe, but there was too much pastry once baked.

This recipe was excellent, but I made some changes.  I didn't have curry paste, so I added about 4 tbl (or more) of curry powder, 1 tbl of garam masala and about 1 tsp of minced ginger.  I also peeled & cubed 1 potato and cooked it with the onions and added 1/2 tbl of minced garlic, about 2-3 tsp of salt, and 2 tbl of dried cilantro.  I used 2 cans of garbanzo beans and blended them in a food processor until they were coarse.  I couldn't find puff pastry so I took a gamble and used Pillsbury pie crusts and it worked great.  I also used alot more apple juice to keep it moist.  By the time its all done the potatoes were nicely cooked, so no need to precook potatoes.  Very quick and easy and came out just like restaurant samosas (at least to me).  Next time I'll throw in some peas.

Love the idea of puff pastry instead of fussing with traditional samosa dough.  But the filling was a little lackluster so I went back to my own potato and peas one with a lot more spices--garlic and ginger, amchur powder, garam masala, chaat masala, coriander seed, cumin, and chili powder.  Some people also like to add cashews.

Wonderful recipe!!  Have made it several times.  Sometimes, I make just the filling, and serve it with warm wheat or jalapeno tortillas.  Everyone who has tried it has liked it.

I did doctor this up a bit and used peas and potatoes and carrots only in my curry mixture. They do taste good and are usually all gone quickly!!! They go well with a tamarind chutney sauce.. Make sure you taste your seasonings before cooking and I add some fresh cilantro to the mixture as well.

The filling was really easy & very tasty.  Some reservations about the use of pastry crust; although that also made it very easy to make.

I rather liked this. It's very simple, and it re-heats well too, although it tastes nothing like the Samosa's I've eaten previously. The main problem was that the filling refuses to stay in the pastry while you eat it, because there was nothing to hold it together; I don't know how one would fix that, though. Also, I prefer my food to have a bit more kick, so next time I'll up the curry or add pepper flakes or something.

These are simple and tasty.  This is a good recipe for those like me who are not experienced with Indian cuisine.  I made them ahead of time, then popped them in the oven when I was ready.  I suggest mushing up about half of the chickpeas with a fork in the pan.  Otherwise the filling is too bumpy and when you bite into them the chickpeas roll out onto the plate. They are good appetizers for the meal and actually taste decent as cold leftovers as well. This is a good higher protein version than the traditional potato based samosa.  The only drawbacks are that the curry paste and dough are somewhat pricey.

These came out delicious.  I added peas since I saw other people suggested it; I also added some garlic.  I had a tough time with the puff pastry so this took me a lot longer than the directions said.  Then I made a quick dipping sauce with barbecue sauce, curry paste, apple juice, and a little salt.

I used Kris B's suggestions for the most part (added carrots, potatoes, peas, ginger, garlic, cumin, chili powder, cilantro) and the filling was amazingly good. 
However, I tried baking them in eggroll wrappers, and they didn't turn out so good. The skin was quite tough and slightly chewy.  Edible, but could have been better.
Also, with all the chopping and peeling, they took me about an hour and a half, not 45 minutes.

awesome recipe! with a couple of mods though...:P  i added a potato and a can of peas to the dish...and also, blended about a third of it to make the flavors even out.  i also added about a 1/4 c of chopped cilantro for some herby-ness, and also made a sweet and sour tamarind sauce to go with it all.  instant hit!

OK call me crazy but I combined this recipe with the yogurt samosa recipe and WOW it's delicious.  So good.  Great idea baking it in the oven instead of deep frying.  But I did enjoy the yogurt added in.  Also I mashed it for the texture.  New favorite for sure.

I made a bunch of changes, but used the same overall idea of the recipe, which is why I'm still rating it. I thawed some frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, corn) and added some celery and mushrooms to the garbanzo mixture. I used curry paste still, and sauteed some green onions in oil with the paste before mixing everything else. I added some cumin, chili powder, and salt. After cooking a little to heat everything through, I spooned onto strips of phyllo dough (2 layers thick) and rolled up in triangles. I baked at 350 for 15 minutes and they came out really tasty!

This recipie went over very well. I didn't know what frozen puff pastry so I bought 3 Pilsbury pizza crusts (the kind that comes in a can that pops open) I unrolled the crusts and cut each into 6 pieces. This worked pefectly for the amount of filling! I also used 1 tbsp of curry powder instead of curry paste, and a half tbsp of cumin Next time I will use a can of another kind of bean to go with the chickpeas. It would also go great with some cheese.

Yum! I had wonton skins instead of dough. The flavor is wonderful, however my finished product was a little dry for my tastes. Next time I make these, I will put the garbanzo beans in a food processor so they can fill up the wonton. Delicious! Thank you!

This was a great recipe, but i think there would be one revision I would make. I am on a college kid's budget, so maybe instead of  pastry puff, I would substitute crescent roll dough, generic brand. ;)   Overall, phenomenal recipe and I will be sure to make this again. It was so good,   even my most meat-loving football friend asked for the recipe!  Thanks! Allie

Delicious!  I really enjoyed these --- the filling was simple and delicious.  I had leftover filling and ate it as a side dish for another meal.

I am still a novice when it comes to cooking, and I had a lot of trouble stuffing the dough and pinching it closed.  My finished samosas were tasty, but not very pretty.  I tried triangles, but I think that the  reviewer who suggested rolling it into balls might be on the right track.  I'll try that method next time.

I LOVED the filling, but I didn't like the puff pastry dough, next time I think I will use regular samosa dough. I also added peas because the ones that I usually get at my local indian restaurant have peas in them.

This is a wonderful recipe. For a more healthy snack try it with chicken and spanich.  i don't care for spanich but with this it is soo good.  Add a little motzarella cheese and even the kids will love it.

This was ok.  I want to try a different mixture of ingredients.  I also think this would have been better if the mixture was put in a food processor then put in the dough.  I didn't like the chunks of garbanzo beans.

I am used to having potatoes as the filling but I must say that garbanzo beans is a brilliant idea and tastes great!
