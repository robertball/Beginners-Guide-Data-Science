I made it exactly to recipe and it was pretty good, but I like a bit more garlic and lemon so I ended up adding some after tasting. I think I had five garlic cloves in the finished product and it was fantastic. It's very easy to make.

I saw this recipe 2 months ago and have had a can of garbanzo beans in the cabinet waiting since then. I can't believe I waited so long - this was so easy and tasty! My husband tried it and agreed its much better than store bought. Plus I can add flax seed and wheat germ to it to boost the nutrients. This is my favorite new snack.

Not exactly the hummus I was looking for, but a darned good recipe!  It was a little watery though.  I will not add water the next time.  Really fast and easy recipe to take with you on the go!

This has become a family favorite.  Perhaps the person who found it runny did not drain and rinse the garbanzo beans.  Ours is thick and yummy.

I was skeptical, then surprised at how delicious this hummus is! You really can't taste the yogurt (which is what I was afraid of), and the taste is fantastic.  I used more garlic than called for. Very good recipe!

Very "yummy" and very easy.  The second time I doubled the recipe because my kids love hummus and it kept well in the refridgerator.  I used 3/4 cup of yogurt for the doubled recipe because I like my hummus a little thicker, I also added more garlic.  The taste is fine without extra, I just LOVE garlic.  I may add a little less lemon juice next time, it seemed a little overpowering, but my daughter thought it was just right.

I was so looking forward to this recipe!  It disappointed :(  Too runny, too lemony, and weird without the tahini.  I'm sorry.  It just didn't taste like hummus.  Other than that it wasn't too bad.  I was expecting hummus and got a not bad dip for veggies.  Sorry :(

Made this for my husband and he couldn't get enough! Basic, super-simple, yet tons of flavor. This will be our "go-to" hummus from no on.

Quick & Yummy Hummus Haiku: "Made my hummus 'green', for St. Patrick's Day party. Yummy, yes, & quick!" I followed the recipe, dropping the water and adding a pinch of cayenne pepper. Tinted it w/ green food coloring and served it alongside cut green veggies for St. Patty's, and while everyone at first glance thought it was guacamole, it was delightfully devoured.

So good and super easy!  I used lime juice because that's what I had and only 1/2 T of water.  This tastes so fresh.  Will make it again and again.

This a great base recipe to alter to your personal taste. I love that it uses common pantry items that I always have on hand. I did add more sea salt and tahini to taste. I can imagine making this weekly.

This recipe was super fast which is great but it was not exactly what I was looking for. Unlike a previous reviewer I found it to be too lemony. But I do agree that it needs a little more garlic as well as salt and pepper. I also did not add the water and the consistency was perfect.good base recipe. Thanks.

This is my favorite hummus recipe. Since the recipe doesn't call for tahini -sesame paste- I use sesame oil instead of using olive oil. It adds great flavor.

I personally don't like hummus, however, I have clients that do and they tell me that it is the best that they have had.  I also make this recipe and add sun dried tomatoes to a batch and to another some pitted rich olives.  Even I like those.  Great Recipe.

Quick and easy, but taste as you go rather than blend everything at once.  I added no water and thought it was still too thin, so added more garbanzos.  Next time, more lemon juice and less garlic.
