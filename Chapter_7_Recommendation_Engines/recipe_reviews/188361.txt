I make these all the time for Potluck...the only bad thing about them is keeping DH from devouring them all before-hand!  I usually put the chocolate layer on top so I only have to use one bowl.  I also sometimes add walnuts and/or chocolate chips. Yummy!

Wow!!! This really is "the Best!"  I followed the recipe with amazing results.  The only minor problem I had was that the batter was slightly dry.  I used two large bananas and I didn't really measure it out to 1 1/2 cups.  Next time I would add 4 bananas to make it more moist.  I had to add some milk to the cocoa mixture to thin it out, but otherwise it was fabulous.

These are great! I do agree with the others about not changing a thing.  Also, I noticed that  1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas is about 4-5 bananas. Mine were medium size.  Please make sure you measure otherwise the bars will be dry.

I make this recipe into muffins because when I made it into bars the bars were too thin. I pour them half and half like one of the pictures you see in the recipe album. They're very delicious. My girlfriend says out of all the muffins I make that these are the best. I always give these away too so we don't eat the whole batch. FIVE STARS!!!!!

This recipe makes a delicious chocolate flavored banana cake. If you are expecting a bar cookie, or chewy brownie type..this recipe won't cut it. That being said, these are very good. I was a little worried about dryness as mentioned by several others so I used almost a full 2 cups of banana...perfect...very moist and the banana flavor comes through nicely. I though they could use a little something on the top. I made a peanut butter glaze (from this site) as suggested by another reviewer and just drizzled that over the top. With that addition, this recipe was 5 stars! Perhaps just a sifting of confectioner's sugar would be enough, but how can one go wrong with banana, chocolate and peanut butter all in one bite!

These are excellent! I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a pie pan. The only other changes I made were substituting rum flavor for the vanilla (out of vanilla) and adding a bit extra banana. The bananas I mashed came out to 1/4 cup more than called for, but I threw it all in anyway. It came out very moist and flavorful! Definitely a keeper recipe. The best part was that I already had the ingredients. What a great way to use those extra bananas!

I asked my Husband if he liked it, he said, "give this to noone and make more", I think that is a YES! The only thing I did different is use a smaller pan.

Very good and very easy...like a lite banana bread.  Saw the recipe and made them the same day.  3 bananas was perfect. Use very ripe bananas.  The more ripe the bananas  the sweeter the bars..and more Banana flavor.  Very yummy!

Heavenly!  A perfect blending of chocolate and banana.  I agree about not changing a recipe, but I didn't have the exact ingredients needed; so I did have to improvise.  I only had Hershey's Special Dark cocoa, so I added 1/4 cup sugar to my dark cocoa and batter.  My 13 x 9 pan was in the dishwasher, so I made cupcakes instead and they baked for 25 minutes.  The only reason they lasted 5 hours is because we weren't home to eat them!

Easy, moist, great presentation. I had 4 average-sized overripe bananas and just used all of those without measuring. It really is a cake - only bars if you happen to cut into bar shapes. The "chocolate factor" isn't quite pronounced enough, in my opinion. I think I'll try it again with some mini chocolate chips in the cocoa portion. Very enjoyable, though, and I will make them again.

I didn't go by all of the recipe directions. I tried to use less dishes and poured the plain banana batter in first and add the cocoa batter after, which worked okay and tastes great, but I wish I had put the cocoa batter in first as it is a LOT thicker and would be easier to spread the plain batter on top of it... and it's not thin enough to drizzle. I am thinking of adding oatmeal to the recipe next time between the cocoa layer and plain layer... I will add in a 2nd review when I try that!!! Otherwise, I say try it!!!

Really really good. I made it as described and it wasn't enough batter to get much of a uniformly marbleized look but it did puff up and really fill the 9x13 pan. I used 4 very ripe bananas, needing to use them up, and I may have used a little extra cocoa. The flavors are definitely strong. I wasn't sure about the amount of sugar because my bananas were so ripe, but the unsweetened cocoa really balances it out.
However, I think the recipe is only going to hit 5 stars (for me) with the addition of some nuts or chocolate chips, to change up the texture in each bite.

I made these exactly as instructed and took them to a potluck.  They were a hit-everyone was raving and i came home with an empty pan!  The swirl/marble design instructions didn't work for me at all though.  it would have looked much better spooning the white batter onto the top in circles and then drawing a knife though the circles onto of the chocolate batter.

I was wanting a recipe other than banana bread or muffins to use up three very ripe bananas.  I can't say these are really "bars" per se, they were more like a snacking cake.  If you are looking for something like brownies, this isn't it.  I like the banana and chocolate combination.  I doubt that I would make these again.

Added walnuts.  Good flavor.  Good texture.   My personal preference is not to mix chocolate and banana.  I like both flavors but on their own.

Love me some banana and chocolate! Perfect little cupcakes (or in my dad's case, ginormous muffins). Flavor wise they were pretty good. For some reason mine wasn't as moist as other reviewers said, I probably should take out faster because they were in cupcake cups.

Instead of cocoa I used mini chocolate chips. This was a BIG HIT. I also added just about a 1/2 tbs of maple syrup & used whole wheat flour...

These bars were excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  The cake was actually pretty light and fluffy, it was a lot lighter than other banana cake recipes that I have tried.  I also sprinkled the top with chocolate chips.  Thanks for the great recipe, yummy!

Tasty and relatively easy.  Whenever I have bananas that are a little past their prime, I put them in the freezer and then thaw them when I have enough to bake with.  Easier than mashing bananas that aren't ready for baking.

This recipe should be called a cake rather than a bar.  It is very tasty.  I ended up adding a tiny splash of milk to the batter at the end and it turned out excellent.  My husband ate half of it in one sitting.

Nice, moist, bread and a good way to use up spotty bananas.  I made exactly as written; only I baked in mini muffin pans rather than a cake pan.  I got 60 minis out of this recipe.  I baked for about 12 minutes.  Thanks Lisa for sharing your recipe.

These are very good, cake like bars. For those who think the pan size is too large these bars rise and spread so stay with the larger pan. I also baked mine for 20 minutes and that was perfect. I made one change with the ingredients, I used 3/4 cups sugar instead of 1 cup.

My father in law always asks me to make these. They are so moist and yummy. More like a chocolate banana cake than a bar, though. Really yummy desert and very easy to make.

The kids give their thumbs up!  The pan got finished off before I could get a picture to post but they turned out great.  I followed the recipe to the letter, using 3 pretty good sized bananas, per the reviews.  Great recipe.

I have made this recipe as several times..it is wonderful, worth 5 stars.  One day I intended to make this recipe as is; however, when I measured my banana, I only has a little over a cup.  I searched my kitchen for something to add moisture, and found some cream of coconut.  I added 3/4 cup to the bananas.  Awesome!!!!!!  Don't know if I would say they were better, but they were just as good.  Just a little something extra.

These were pretty good.  Only changes made were I used sugar substitute, and I didn't think there was anyway the batter would stretch into a 9x13 pan, so I used a 7x11 pan, and that was perfect, still baking for only 25 mins.

These were really tasty, but more cake-like than I thought they'd be. I guess because they're called bars, I expected them to be denser and moister, more like a brownie consistency.  I sprinkled the top with walnuts which complimented the chocolate-banana flavor and added a little crunch.  I could see making these in a cupcake pan and passing them off as muffins--they'd be delicious with a cup of coffee in the morning.

I made these as birthday cupcakes and they were a hit even without icing! I ran out of sugar, so my final amount was more like 3/4 c. vs. 1 c. They were still plenty sweet.

This is my son's favorite treat! I scoop out the "white" half of the mixture and drop it in the pan the add in the cocoa so I only dirty one bowl. I always sprinkle some chocolate chips on top before baking for an extra chocolate kick. BTW it never looks like enough to fill the pan but don't worry it comes out puffed up with a nice most cake texture. I have also added double the cocoa to the whole mixture and made them into chocolate muffins with chips on top again with great success.

Very similar to my banana cake recipe, but I was hoping for a stronger chocolate flavor.  Will add chocolate chips next time to achieve that.   Otherwise, very tasty and very pretty, easy to cut into bars.

Very moist, and easy to prepare.  I would call this a cake, not a bar (which I would consider much more dense).  I also found it a little bit too sweet.  I would cut back on the sugar a little next time.  Overall, a nice 'snack cake'.

These were outstanding. Made exactly as instructed, only I added a bag of chocolate chips (1/2 bag to each layer). I had to bake mine about 10 minutes longer than instructed (used 9x13 glass pan), but that might be b/c I had more banana?  I used 4 small bananas, and didn't measure them after mashed...

Yum! The banana and the butter really stand out -- and the chocolate just makes it perfect. I did some minor changes: used 1/2 cp of wheat graham flour in lieu of all white and used 2/3 of brown sugar instead of the cup of all-white. Following another reviewer, I put the banana batter in the pan first, then mixed in the cocoa and added 1/4 cp of mini chips. I plan on wrapping the squares and freezing them to add to the kids lunchboxes (If we don't eat it all first!)

We really liked the flavor of this recipe, very full of banana!  But even with cutting back the sugar it was still a bit sweet.  These will make a perfect after school snack for the kids, though, and I'm sure we'll be making these again and again.  A nice alternative to our other favorite... banana bread!  Thanks for a tasty treat!

I added 3T mayo to the cocoa portion, decreased the sugar to 2/3 C, added chocolate chips to the top portion, and sprinkled generously with cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking (I add this step to every banana bread recipe I try....it is delicious). These are a great alternative to banana bread. This recipe is also listed on Taste of Home's website under Black Bottom Banana Bars and a reviewer mentioned the 3T of mayo...definitely ups the moisture. I also baked it in an 11 x 7 pan for approx 40 minutes.

Subbed caramel extract for vanilla to liven the flavor up, but these were still somewhat bland (like a cake without icing).  Batter was thick & thus didn't "marbleize" very easily....was hoping the appearance would make up for the lack of flavor.  Would recommend drizzling with caramel sauce or adding chocolate chips to chocolate layer.  Probably better to get rid of your bananas by making muffins or bread...
UPDATE:  Made a caramel sauce & drizzled over top.  This modification added a touch of sweetness/flavor & visual interest that made it worthy of 4 stars (in my humble opinion).

These are blah. The cocoa layer is not distinctive enough to differentiate between the two flavors.
You would be better off making it without the cocoa and adding it adding it to the top of your favorite brownie recipe and cooking them together.

These came out delicious- and I followed the recipe exactly. I might add chocolate chips next time to make it a little sweeter, but I have a sweet tooth. My friends who don't have as big of a sweet tooth loved these as-is!

An excellent and tasty way to use extra bananas, resembling a sort-of banana chocolate brownie. The only change I make is taking the sugar down to 2/3 cups because ripened bananas are pretty sweet. It is essential to measure the amount of mashed bananas - don't guess or they'll be dry. This recipe has made it into my dessert/snack rotation. Try it!

Chocolate and banana are always a good combination, and the fact that this isn't very high cal makes it even better. Not too rich or sweet, but very moist.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. This is by far the BEST banana bread/cake recipe I have used in the last 20 years!  I will not be using any other again.  Dont make any changes and like other reviewers have stated measure your bananas - I used 3 med and 1 large banana for this recfipe.  Thank you so much for sharing, Lisa!

This is most definately a cake. I think they call them bars because they come out thinner. Otherwise this recipe is really good. Cake was moist. The recipe calls for dividing the batter in two and adding cocoa to half, however because there isn't that much batter it was almost impossible to do two layers because it is to thick to spead thinnly. If I make this again I will do it in a 9x9 pan or make 1 1/2 times the recipe to fill a 9x13 pan to make it into a cake since that is what it is.

I wasn't exactly turned off by these... but I was't overly excited about them, either. A little bland flavour- neither the banana or the chocolate really came through. I don't think I'll make them again.

Just made these and they're great! I did make one change and that was to sprinkle some chocolate chunks in between the dark and light layers and then a few more on the top. Delicious! More of a cakey texture than a bar texture, which was a surprise. But very moist. Will definitely make these again!

These are wonderful and I am definitely not a big banana fan (I love banana bread but I don't like eating just plain old bananas).  This is probably the first recipe I followed to a T in a verrry long time since all of the top reviews advised changing nothing and offered no alteration suggestions (you never see this on allrecipes!).  The texture was much more cakelike than I had expected and the batter rose up in the pan quite a bit, so that was a pleasant surprise.  Next time though, I want to add chocolate chips to the batter to give it a little more chocolate "umph" :)

These are excellent! I made them into mini loaves and served vanilla ice cream in the middle. A keeper. Thank you!

These left a weird after taste in your mouth.  The banana portion without the cocoa taseted good but the portion with the cocoa did not.

Very moist and yummy. I added chocolate chips to top of batter half way through baking time. Used white whole-wheat flour.

Great recipe!  Definitely a moist cake, not a bar, but nobody's complaining here :) I added mini chocolate chips to the banana batter and baked it in a bundt pan for about 30 minutes....then flipped it onto a plate and sprinkled with powdered sugar -- SO GOOD!  Thanks for posting this easy and somewhat healthy (no oil!) dessert!

These are wonderful. I used whole wheat flour and replaced half the butter with applesauce to make them a little healthier. I needed 5 small bananas to get 1.5 cups, so maybe those who found the batter dry didn't use enough? Once the bars cooled I also added a chocolate glaze, but they would have been fine without it.

This was just ok for me. My husband and son really didn't care for it. The good thing is that it does satisfy my sweet tooth for a lot less calories than the normal desserts that I crave! If I have any left over bananas I'll probably make it again.

Made this recipe exactly as is and it was delicous. It really is more of a cake than a bar though so if you are looking for something more dense, this is not the recipe for you. I topped it off with "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" from here and it was so yummy! My hubby can't get enough :D  Just wanted to add that it is very moist. Three days later and it is just as moist as the night I made them! If you are finding this recipe is turning out dry for you then you are not measuring out your mashed banana. I used 4 medium sized bananas and it came out perfect. I think I'm going to make these as cupcakes next time. They should do very well that way. :)

Yummy, very moist. If you don't have enough bananas you can substitute with applesauce if you've got it on hand. When dividing the mix you'll be removing about 2.5 cups as the total mixture is about 5 cups (although I used just under of 2 cups of banana/applesauce mix to get this amount). The texture of it is not like a typical "Bar" it's more like a moist cake, so baking it in a loaf pan, cake pan or muffin pan is a great idea. You could ice it as well & I'm sure that would be tasty - I think chocolate or cream cheese icing would be good for this recipe. Thank you Lisa for this recipe, it's a "Do Over" for me.

I made a 1/2 recipe of these, but used the whole egg.  I also used whole wheat flour (1 cup instead of 3/4 c) and added 1/3 c applesauce and only used 1/2 the butter.  We enjoyed them.  I think next time I'll add some chocolate chips too.

so yummy! I like many others was looking for something other than banana bread to use up my bananas.  I did what another reviewer did, added the plain batter to the pan first(then threw on some choc chips) and then put the coco batter on top. I had 3 very ripe banans and baked it for 25 min. I couldnt wait for them to cool, I was cutting them when they were still warm.  I might sprinkle some powder sugar on them. This will be my go to recipe to use up bananas from now on!

Absolutely delicious! These taste great and are simple to make! I followed the recipe exactly and think it's simply wonderful! The bars are easy to cut, which is a bonus. I drizzled melted chocolate over the top to make them look a bit fancier.

Very good recipe! I doubled it since I had so many bananas and it just took a little longer to bake because I had more batter. It's a good alternative to the banana  bread I usually make with over-ripe bananas.

After reading the reviews I knew to expect a cake-like dessert and not the bars you'd expect from the title.  I was cool with that.  It was good, but not phenomenal.  I did substitute splenda for the sugar (diabetic husband), otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  The cake was nice and moist and the banana part was very good.  The chocolate part was just ok.  It tasted best warmed up with chocolate syrup drizzled over it.  Again, it's not a bad dessert at all - I happily ate it over the course of a couple days along with everyone else in the house.  It's just not something I can see myself going out of my way to make again.

Followed recipe as written except made into cupcakes. Delicious, moist, chocolate-banana flavor. Will not change a thing and will make these again very soon. We dipped the cupcakes in "Pro Ganache" and then drizzled with "Peanut Butter Glaze" both from this site. Everyone, from toddlers to grandparents loved these. Thanks for sharing!

These were pretty good. I thought they would be more like a brownie but they were more cakelike. The chocolate batter was hard to spread. I probably won't make these again because I would just make my banana cake recipe which is easier.

Aw, I was sort of disappointed since I was expecting more of a "bar" or brownie-like texture.  It turned out more like a cake.  The flavor was pretty good, though I would have liked more of a chocolate flavor.  Next time what I think I will do is add another banana, more cocoa, another egg, and less baking soda and powder.

Awsome, quick, and easy! This recipie is great by itself but i changed it a bit to cut back on a few calories. I used half sugar and half artificial sweetener. I also used 1 cup of all purpose flour and half a cup of whole wheat flour. I also used light margarine instead of butter. I was pleasantly surprized at how well they turned out. The whole wheat flour made them really chewy like brownies, whick I like better!

Very good, the thing I liked is I had all the ingredients on hand and that is always a good thing.  This was very easy to make and very tasty.  I made the mistake of not measuring the bananas, I used 2 medium sized and it looked like a cup and a half but it must not have been so my bars turned out a little dry. I blame myself for that. Next time I will add a little more banana.  Very creative idea -  will make again!

A bit too sweet, and definitely should be called cake instead of bars.  Ok, but I won't make again.

Just the perfect breakfast, snack and dessert! I really love how the banana flavour isn't hidden, it really stands out. I used whole wheat flour and margarine instead for chewier, healthy bite. I also used 3 large mashed bananas, which turned out great, but I just had to leave it in the oven longer.

I added two handfuls of chocolate chips, and I liked the contrast. The flavor was good, but I would like this to be more dense like a brownie. Be careful though ... these are light enough that they're addictive! Good for using up a few bananas that were going bad.

Wonderful, and oh-so-addictive! I made them exactly as the recipe stated, but added handfuls of chopped walnuts and white chocolate chips. The bars are light and fluffy: more cake-like than cookie-like, so you almost need a fork to eat them, but they're absolutely delicious.

Delicious cake. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8X8 for 25 min. I also used dutch processed cocoa that I mixed with a little bit of hot water to help it mix easier and to enhance the flavor. Will definitely make again

It was delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly and was so pleasantly surprised to get a moist, airy cake instead of dense bars!  Will definitely have to make it again, my cat ate it while I was sleeping so I’ll be making another one today.

I don't even like banana cake---- but I couldn't stop eating this! I added about 1/4 cup more banana and used almond extract instead of vanilla. I also added  a sugar glaze to the top. AMAZING!

They're okay. I was hoping for a bigger punch of flavor.

Delicious, very moist with good flavor. Didn’t have shortening so I used butter. Didn’t seem like enough batter for a 9x

Can I give this more than 5 stars? Made this for our weekly neighborhood dinner and served it with ice cream and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone loved it. Had 10 people over and we finished the pan. Very very easy.

Followed the recipe as written but used extra banana (5 large ones, equalling about 2 cups).  It was not quite ready after 25 minutes but was perfect around 29-30. Next time I will swirl with a knife rather than a spatula. Huge hit with the adults and the kids.

Made this mainly as I had all ingrediets on hand and wanted to get the frozen over ripe bananas out of my freezer.  I made as directed with chocolate layer on bottom but sprinkled a few chocolatse chips between layers then made it a poke cake with some chocolate syrup.  It would have been just fine without my nigglings.  I did use an 11 X 7 pyrex pan.

I too, thought it looked thin in a 9x13 pan, but it came out perfectly.  Very glad I didn't try a smaller pan.  I did alter the recipe a bit because I am such a chocoholic.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips before dividing the batter to add the cocoa.  I also topped the cake with confectioners sugar after it cooled.  So good!

Definitely more like a cake than a cookie bar, but still very good. Only minor changes I made were 1/2 whole wheat and half white flour, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, I used 1/3 cup of cocoa since some complaints were about the chocolate flavor not being strong enough and I mixed in 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips. But what really makes it is adding a peanut butter glaze. It puts it over the top and its so easy to do. Peanut butter, powdered sugar and water and blend til smooth. There is a recipe on this site for the exact measurements. This is a fun way to use those over ripe bananas! Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe! I admit, I didn't measure the bananas - I just used 5 medium/large bananas, but it came out perfect and moist. I did add chocolate chips to the banana batter, and I think that was just what I needed since I love chocolate, and without them it didn't have much chocolate flavor. All in all a great recipe, and a wonderful use for ripe bananas!

While these tasted nice and all, they were most definitely not a bar! This made a moist cake, and that's it. I used a little extra banana as 3 was not enough to quite get 1 1/2 cups, so I added another which went to about 1 3/4, but that made it nice and moist. The taste was good as I said, but I was looking for something different than just cake/muffins with this. I'll stick with my muffin recipe I suppose, but that's not to say this tasted bad or anything, just not as it's claimed to be.

After reading the reviews I only made ONE change. I added 2 cups (about 4 medium bananas) instead of 1 1/2 cups. This cake was PERFECT!!! Even my husband who HATES bananas loved it & ate 3 pieces. Oh & I also topped it with the peanut butter glaze from this site off a suggestion of another reviewer. Pure heaven! Cannot go wrong with banana, chocolate, and peanut butter! Thanks for an amazing recipe!

This recipe is absolutely perfect for those weeks where you buy too many bananas. You'll very likely have all ingredients on hand, it's incredibly simple to make, and cleans up easily. My batter turned out to be the right consistency using the exact recipe. You can also make the marbling as fussy as you like! I served it on dessert plates decorated with chocolate syrup and raspberries and slices of frozen banana. A delicious dessert or snack!

I made these for my daughter's volleyball team, so I made them into muffins to make them easier for them to eat.  I also added a few chocolate chips on the tops.  These turned out wonderfully moist and full of flavor.  They were gone in a matter of minutes, and I will keep this one handy.  Thanks!

Yum! Yum! Decided to try these since I needed a break from my banana bread recipe.  Followed the recipe but added some chocolate chips to the plain batter.  Filled up 10 medium sized cupcake holes and baked for 25 minutes.  I used three ripe bananas.  Would definately make these again.

Amazing. I always have too many bananas and was getting sick of making banana bread all the time. This was quicker and tastier. I even thought I had screwed these up by overmixing the two batters together, but they still turned out delicious. Just baked them until a toothpick came out clean. After they cooled completely I put half in the freezer to prevent me from inhaling them all over a few days.  Will definitely make again.

Yum! I didn't want to use butter, so I used 1 cup of apple sauce instead. It worked just fine. Next time, I might use a little less sugar, though.

I really didn't like these bars.  The night before I had baked a batch of peanut butter & banana dog biscuits and the next day I made these so I would not be tempted to eat the homemade dog biscuits. Well, they don't tempt me at all.  They turned out fine but I just do not care for the flavors and would rather eat one of my homemade dog biscuits instead of one of these bars.

I cut this in half, and doubled the bananas, and added just a little extra flour. I also put drizzled peanut butter chocolate frosting with marshmallows over it. Yum. :)

I made these one night when I was craving some banana bread.  They are AMAZING!!!! So moist and so much lighter that banana bread but with the same great tase! The chocolate is just a bonus.  I followed the recipe with out any changes and it was great.  Everyone that tried it loved it as well!

YUMMMM!  When I was putting it into the pan I wasn't sure it was going to turn out since it was really thick...but it was perfect...we ate half the pan shortly after it came out of the oven.

It tastes great, but it's nothing fantastic.  Next time I make this, however, I will be making it as a cake with chocolate icing instead of just squares.  I have a great banana cake recipe I used at my son's birthday, and next to that, this does not seem that great.  Nothing I would change, though, so still an awesome recipe!

Tasted great.  But I think I was expecting more of a brownie.  This recipe is like a cake cut into squares.  But they were good.

This is more like a cake. It is super moist. I used 5 very ripe bananas, I would say it made about 2 - 2 1/2c when mashed.I also used 1c whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2c all-purpose(we have diabetes). I put some mini choc chips in the light colored batter as suggested. Very tasty. I will difinitely make this again. Will make it using Splenda in place of the sugar when the grandchildren will not be eating it. I think because of the extra banana in it I had to bake it 5 minutes longer.

I would call this a cake - not bars. I was expecting something harder, like a brownie texture, but it was very light and fluffy. The cake was springy to the touch. I'm not sure how I feel about the flavor of the chocolate and the way the banana/chocolate tasted together...it left a faint aftertaste. The presentation was nice, though. It's different, some might really like it, but I will probably try something else next time I have a few bananas lying around.

These were great! I made them into cupcakes & added some chopped chocolate to the batter. I topped them with peanut butter buttercream and they were to die for. So moist & flavorful!

These are very good and I will make them again but next time I will add some chocolate chips.  I was looking for something with a little more chocolate taste.  I added nuts and was going to add chocolate chips but when I looked for them I was all out.

These were very good. Moist. Flavorful. Not too sweet. The only change for me was adding an extra banana.    Thanks for the great recipe.

09/05/10  I have made these bars numerous times since my initial review a year and a half ago and when I wrote the review I had made them several times.  Going over some of the reviews since my initial comments, I wanted to state that I also was not crazy about these bars when I first made them.  I started using Ghiradelli ground chocolate instead of the unsweetened cocoa powder.  I think it really, really improves the taste and texture. I also add nuts (either walnuts or pecans) to the batter or sprinkled on top and pressed in. The Ghiradelli product is sweetened so it does end up sweeter than the original recipe, but didn't think it was too sweet.  It is more cakey than brownie, but I think in a good way. Using the Ghiradelli makes it richer too and I'm glad I tried the recipe again. The Chocolate Icing recipe from this site is also great and I use the Ghiradelli in that, as well.  03/22/09 Great way to use ripe bananas without going to the tried and true Banana Bread.  I always like a marbled cake or cookie and this turned out great.  I did find a recipe on Allrecipes called Chocolate Icing that I revised somewhat to frost the bars.

Simply Divine!  I, too, like some other reviewers, added choc. chips to the banana batter.  They were so yummy!  My 4 year old son ate 10 in 2 days!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Really great recipe!  I added choc chips to the light side as per suggestion, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon in the mix.  Yum!

Made the Cocoa Banana Bars without making any changes to the posted recipe.  They are delicious.  I may add a little more cocoa next time, but that is because I am a chocoholic.
