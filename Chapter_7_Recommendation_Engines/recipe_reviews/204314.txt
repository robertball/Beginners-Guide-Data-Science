This is delicious! I added kale, which was an excellent fit with the white beans/herbs/lemon flavours. (Use about 4 cups, washed, stems removed, and chopped, and add to the garlic in the pan. Volume reduces by about 75%.) Toast is optional, in my opinion.

Excellent recipe! By the time I finished reading this my mouth was watering. I rushed to the store to get the ingredients and made it for a late lunch. Absolutely delicious. I substituted the pesto for some purreed basil from my garden (forgot the pine nuts) and it was fantastic! Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my goodness!! I have no words to describe this except delicious beyond belief!! Perfect combination of flavors. I make a double batch every time, and like other reviewers make the beans the day before. I feed 5 teenage boys and they all love this. It's healthy too which is great. I follow the recipe exactly except I don't have/use the minced jalapeno. Any kind of sturdy toast will do. Don't forget the lemon and Parmesan cheese, it makes the dish! Thank you for this amazing recipe! :) My boys have also skipped the egg and put these beans over rice and loved it that way too. So versatile!

oh sweet jesus, this was amazing!!!!  i did make a few little changes based on my pantry and tastes:  a dash of cayenne pepper instead of the jalapeno, and thyme instead of turmeric.  ABSOLUTELY amazing!!!!  definitely going to make this again!  also great to make the beans ahead of time (like the night before) so all you have to make in the morning is the eggs and toast.  My favorite breakfast!

It was so good! I didn't have rye bread so I made it with flour tortillas. Even my 10 year old ate it all! :)

Wow!  This is something I never would have thought up on my own and it was delicious. I made the beans ahead of time and then just reheated while cooking the egg for an easy dinner. Thanks for sharing.

I doubled this for 2 people because we left out the toast. I didn't have jalapenos, so I added some cayenne. I also left out the cheese. It was tasty and filling. The lemon on the beans changed the entire flavor (for the better!)

Very Budget friendly, I make this about 3xs a month. The only expensive thing is the pesto, but one jar usually lasts 4 recipes worth.  I also always double the recipe for our family of 2 adults and 3 kids under 6.

This was delicious! I didn't have white beans on hand, so I used light red kidney beans, homemade rye bread, and put an extra egg on top of each because we really like our egg yolks. I used about an inch of jalapeno, minced, and it was perfect. I can wait to make this again - I'll be sure to try the white beans some time too! Oh yeah, we ate this for dinner - it's very filling.

Okay, so I thought this was good but not awesome..  However, my husband hated it and he rarely hates things that I make.  He kept complaining that it was too weird of a mixture of ingredients.

We LOVED it. I thought this might be a mistake, but it was wonderfully delicious. Adaptations: slow-cooked the white beans overnight with a ham bone; used whole-grain bread, no turmeric, lime instead of lemon. YUM. It's cliche to talk about layers of flavor, but here you have it.

This was amazing!  I did not have high hopes, and considered not adding the egg.  I am so glad I did.  I didn't have any jalapenos, so substituted cayenne pepper.  I also had to use wheat bread.  My husband and daughter loved it too.

Just as a side note, you want the eggs to be done by the time the beans are cooked, so they both are fresh & hot. We added some marinated red pepper strips to it this morning, which added a nice zest. Hope you like it!

I used a Thai chili instead of jalapeno (this will add more heat) and served over fresh baked bread. Next time I might add some chopped sun-dried tomatoes, will also double bean mixture and freeze half. Great recipe!

I Didn't have Pesto so I used Red Curry Paste. I was so intrigued by this recipe I had to make it with what I had.Used a can of drained pork and beans. I added dried basil and sautéed some onions in and it still was amazing! Reminded me of  a meal I had in England.

It was full of flavors... however that was the thing...  I served it with a large side of fresh, sweet sauteed eggplant, crookneck squash, onion, and garlic straight from the garden...  and if I hadn't had that on the plate, this would have been just so, so...  I appreciate the chance to get more beans in my diet, but unfortunately, this recipe coupled the beans with a big dose of oil too...

My husband and me loved these so much. I followed the recipe to a tee except I used dry beans which I cooked on low in the crock pot for about 6-7 hours. They are super tasty and satisfying.
