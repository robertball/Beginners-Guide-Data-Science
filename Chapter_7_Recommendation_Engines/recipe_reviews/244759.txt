It needs more flavor. I added a can of Rotel instead of water. Came out much better.

I doubled the recipe and substituted fresh cooked black beans for canned. Otherwise I followed the recipe. This made for a quick meal. I will definitely make this again.

I made this pretty much as written, using green bell pepper instead of red and omitting the cilantro. I removed about 1/3 of the bean mixture and put it in the blender and then put the blended mixture back in with the beans. This thickened the mixture and made it less soupy. We loved the flavor and I served it with some diced avocado on top. I love that this is completely vegan and tastes amazing. You don't miss the meat or cheese. The only thing I would change is to use half the salt.  This recipe will go in the regular rotation. Quick, easy, and thrifty.

My daughter has been begging for burrito bowls so I tried this recipe out for her. Iried the beans alone and thought the flavoring/spices could be tweaked but my family all liked it. It was pretty quick and easy too. I did use jasmine rice instead of brown because I didn't realize I was out of brown rice.

I made this as the recipe suggested but left out the cilantro as my husband doesn't care for that and poured it  over a quinoa and brown rice mixture. Will try it again but add chicken andouille sausage. Very easy to make and with the sausage my husband will give it a five, but I gave it a five because it is fast and easy, not much cleanup and I liked   it enough to get  a second helping.

Very tasty except that it was too salty for me.  I would cut the salt in half at least next time I make it.

This was delicious and the kind of basic recipe that allows for additions and substitutions to accommodate personal tastes or what is on hand.    My husband likes a big dinner so I doubled the recipe.  No leftovers.
