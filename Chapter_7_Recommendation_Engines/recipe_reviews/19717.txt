I love this cake but a couple of things........ I think the 1/2 cup butter or margarine and 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder in the middle of the ingredients list is intended to begin the frosting ingredients but is duplicative.......... I tried to make this a layer cake but it was too moist so next time I will use a 9x13 casserole dish........The frosting wasn't moist enough so I added an additional 6 teaspoons of cola.  With these corrections or additions, I would rate this 5 stars. :-)

I made this recipe years ago and lost my copy.  Was happy to find it here.  It is very simple to make and very good.  Similar to Texas Cake.

My grandmother used to make this for me every birthday!  This is the same recipe, except she would add 1 1/2 cup mini marshmallows into the cake batter.  Yummy!  Also, I noticed there is a repeat of butter and cocoa powder in the icing on this recipe which is an error. .  It only needs 1/2 butter and 3 TBS cocoa powder...

I used a 9x13 pan, cooked for exactly 35 minutes. We're loving it!

This cake was okay. Not the best Ive had. The icing was great. I reduced the butter and the sugar. That is the only change I made.

This was really good, and so easy! I made it in a 9x13 pan instead, and left out the pecans. I think the frosting was thicker than it normally should be, since I useed the 9x13, which was fine by all of us who consumed it! It was like fudge that hasn't set all the way... and the cake was so moist. Will definitely make this again!

I made this tonight for the umpteenth time tonight. Needless to say, I love it. This time, however, I made half the recipe and baked in it a small pan in my convection table top oven. I poked holes in the cake before I poured on the frosting, which I made with 1/3 cola and 2/3 Kahlua. Delish!

This tastes exactly like Texas cake.  I was hoping for something a little different with the cola but didn't get it with this recipe.  I made it in a 9x13 as one of the reviews suggested and the frosting makes WAY too much for this size.  I probably won't make it again.

I make this recipe almost exactly, except I also add 1 1/2 cups of mini- marshmallows to the cake recipe as the official "Coke" site says. Other than that it is a favorite for us, moist and fudgy delicious!
