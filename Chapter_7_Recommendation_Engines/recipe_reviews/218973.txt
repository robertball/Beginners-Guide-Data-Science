Hi.  I am the recipe submitter.  If you like butternut squash these fries are excellent and are ZERO Weight Watcher PPTS!  Butternut squash has more moisture than potatoes.  So here are a few tips for handling that.  First, it is important to blot out as much moisture as possible before cooking.  Also, if you are looking for crispier fries, try cutting them thinner.  As another reviewer mentioned, spray not only the baking sheet but the fries with cooking spray.  If the fries are large enough, you can place them on a baking rack on top of the baking pan so the air can circulate beneath them and that will also help crisp the fries.  Lastly, if they are not crisp enough you can bake them a little longer.  With regard to the seasoning I use a homemade cajun seasoning without salt.  Then I can control how much salt is added.  Different brands of cajun seasoning have different amounts of salt and therefore you may prefer to either adjust the amount of salt or leave it out altogether.  I hope these tips are helpful; and I hope you enjoy the recipe.

Great new way to serve butternut!  I did lightly spray the "fries" with cooking spray to make the seasoning adhere.

I mostly followed the cooking instructions, and cut thinner slices as I wanted a 'crispier' fry. I used PAM on a cookie sheet and laid the thin 'strips' out in rows. Sprinkled a no salt seasoning mix over the squash, and a light amount of sea salt. Baked for about 20 minutes as they were thinner pieces. Flipped once about halfway through. Have cooked these a couple times now and this is a keeper. They are delectable!

DELICIOUS!!  A great word to sum up this recipe.  I made this as written (making my cajun seasoning from this site "Cajun Spice Mix") and baked for about 25 minutes.  The house smelled wonderful when these were baking.  I really enjoyed the taste of the s/p & cajun with the sweetness of the squash.  It reminds me of sweet potato fries.  This is the first time I've fixed a butternut squash and it most definitely will not be the last.  Thanks OC for sharing this delicious recipe - I've already sent it to my mom and SIL.

Spicy from the Cajun seasoning and sweet from the squash---great combination!  These are much easier to make than the normal kind of shake and bake roasted vegetables!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made them once and enjoyed a lot! Will definitely try again. A few tips though:

1) 1 lb of squash may sound like a lot...but after peeling it, seeding it, and cooking it...you're left with maybe 5 ounces left. Luckily it's just me and I ate them all. Definitely need more next time though :)
2) It says 15-20 minutes but I'm thinking more 20-25.
3) Listen to the others when they say to cut them thin. Shoestring thin.
4) A nice quick spray of oil lets the seasoning stick (I used Old Bay Seasoning and it was fantastic).
5) Definitely let them air out to get some moisture out (I sandwiched mine between paper towels and cookie sheets, then weighed them down).

All in all...great. I'm gonna try them again this weekend. Chalk this up as a fantastic item for those of us trying to lose weight.

These were fabulous!  So easy (once you cut up that squash!) and so tasty.  My entire family ate gobbled them up - and I have a husband and daughter that swear they don't like squash!  Thanks for the great recipe!

stunned how much I like these - and how different they are than any other squash recipe we've tried - we cut our squash more in cubes, which worked well too....... (actually, I usually clean, peel, and chop up several butternut squashes at once and freeze them - and that's what I used - and I'd simply cubed those..., so while I was a little dubious, I was pleased, oh yes, so very pleased with the results), can't say they got crispy, but I didn't miss the crisp....... the yum and spice was plenty good enough as is.....

These "fries" came out very mushy and not at all crunchy. My oven temp may be to blame. The addition of the cajun spice was very tasty and I will use this combo in the future but won't make "fries".

YUM!!  I cut them about as thin as McDonald's fries and cooked for 20.  They weren't crispy at all, but were still soooo tasty.  I was too impatient to wait for them to become "fries".
They were too spicy for my kids, so next time I will do half the batch with cajun and the other half with salt.
Instead of cooking spray, I brushed Extra Virgin Olive oil over them.
Will make them again and again and again.

Here it is September and there was still 1 more butternut squash from last year and my garden is full of them again this year!  This recipe was the inspiration to pare and cut up the "yearling"(still fresh and firm too -I store them in the basement).  This recipe is delicious and I made a tzatziki dipping sauce to go with from this site - yummy.

So simple I'm kicking myself for never thinking to make "fries" from butternut.  I upped the Cajun seasoning a bit and served with a tabasco spiked tarter sauce.

We enjoyed these very much, I left them in the oven for a bit longer to help crisp up.  I've found with all "fries" it helps to try to cut them uniform in size so they cook evenly.  Thanks for posting this new way to use the butternut squash I grew in my garden.

Used just a sheet of parchment paper....no cooking spray or oil at all. Took one hour total to crisp them up and my oven runs very hot! Still, even though it was somewhat time consuming....everyone enjoyed them and I'll make them again.

These were fantastically delicious! Like a few other reviewers, I found them to be a bit soggy, even when cut thin, so I'm planning to experiment with baking them longer at a much lower temperature to partially dehydrate them before baking them at 450. The taste is completely worth the trial and error though!

I had half a squash left over, and no plans for it, so I decided to try this recipe. I can't really give my own opinion on these, though... by the time I was done in the kitchen, they had already been devoured! My friends, however, thought they were really yummy, so this rating is on their behalf! Next time I have some squash I will definitely try this again :)

I hate to give this such a low review, but it was not well received at our table, at all. The spice was too much (and I love spicy), some "fries" turned black, but they still were not crunchy. I followed the tips of some reviewers to dry them on a rack, as well as cooked them on the rack to allow the air to circulate to crisp them up. While I did not feel they were horrendous, my family did. I ate as many as I could and the rest went in the trash. Unfortunately, I was trying to surprise my husband who loves butternut squash and has been requesting some lately. He was sadly disappointed when he tried these.

These turned out good, despite all the other reviewers tips I used they still were not very crispy. I guess they probably need to be even thinner than I cut them but the thinnest ones started to burn after 25 minutes in the oven so probably cut back the time if you can get them stick thin!

These were very good, especially considering they are made from squash.  Turned out a little soggy and limp, but probably just needed to be cooked a little longer.  Still, very good.

I looved these!! I really struggled with the preparation of the squash though.  My fries did not come out nearly as nice looking as the pictures.  I needed to bake almost 30 min for a good crunch.

Delicious, i sprayed the squash with coconut oil spray and layered them on a cake rack and put that on a cookie sheet.
Came out nice and crispy. 
Thank you for the recipe.

I have not tried these yet, but suspect that they will be relish.  Try tossing these in egg whites that have been frothed with a mixer or hand whisk before seasoning and baking....that should make them crispy like it does  sweet potato fries.  No veggie will get totally crisp like an Idaho potato so keep that in mind.  I am looking forward to trying these, as I am sure they will be 5 star fries.  Thank you for sharing!!!

These came out less like fries and more like a side dish of squash.  I did enjoy, but the name was a bit misleading.

A tasty alternative for preparing butternut squash. However, it is a stretch to call these “fries.” They are soft, moist, and limp. I cut very thin “shoestring” fries, as suggested in the recipe submitter’s review, lined the pan with parchment, spread the fries and sprayed them with cooking spray before baking at 450 F for 30 minutes. The only crispy ones were the ones that were burned. We ate them with a fork, dipped them in various dipping sauces, and enjoyed them nonetheless.

These fries are SO good! I am living a ketogenic life but I LOVE POTATOES! Thank you so much for this recipe. I am so thankful! I like spicy food so I used a seasoning called, Slap Yo Momma, paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper. I sprayed some coconut oil on some parchment paper and before seasoning my fries I coated them with avocado oil.

Very yummy- couldn’t stop eating them off the pan! I couldn’t quite get the consistency I would have liked , and may have made mine a tad small, as they shrink a bit. Will def make again though, and will maybe try a slightly bigger wedge next time. Thanks for the recipe!

A super way to make faux fries! Used spray oil (generously), sprinkled spices, then baked on a rack on the foil-covered cookie sheet. A genuine hit with everyone.  Will make again soon.

The flavor was good but like others many were mushy.  It is important to cut them all exactly the same size, which is clearly a skill I need to work on because the small ones burned and the larger ones were mushy.  I will give this another try, but this time salt them and let them sit 15 min to draw out some of the excess moisture before baking. It is nice to have another option other than mash, roast and soup.

I found it very labour intensive since I chopped the butternut squash - probably should've roasted it instead.  They turned out very mushy but I don't think I roasted them on a high enough temperature.  Either way, I've been making Parsnip French fries and they are much easier and more like French fries, so I'll continue making them instead of these.

the fries weren't done after 20 min but they were permanently stuck to my nonstick cookie sheet.  Maybe next time I should lower the temp.

I should have read the reviews stating to cut them SUPER THIN. I didn't, almost caught oven on fire cause if the spray oil dripping. i ended up lowering the temp to 400 and cooking longer. Not sure if these will turn out but i think they will be more mush than anything and I'll have to try again.  Oh well....

Absolutely fabulous!! I roast butternut about twice a week as a WW but for some reason I never made them as fries. I think the higher temp and matchstick cuts really makes these fries. I honestly couldn't tell much diff from sweet potato fries once these had caramelized and crisped up. I didn't have any creole seasoning so I just used Soul seasoning and added a little cayenne. Didn't even need dipping sauce. I'd give these 100 stars simply for the fact that they really satisfy the  French fry craving in a healthy way!!!

This wend down well with the family, added a bit more of the spice for an extra zing, made it a few times now and it goes down well, like the idea that it's fat free, so yummy.

I really liked the flavor,  but the "fries" were not crisp at all.  I think it is a good alternative to other traditional methods of cooking squash and would do it again, but don't expect firm fries.

I fried them instead of baking and they were delicious. Very similar to sweet potato fries if you have an abundance of squash.

Definitely an interesting take on butternut squash, its nice to mix it up from the butter and sugar heavy alternatives you see more frequently. I will definitely make again, though next time I think I need a better cajun spice. Tried to assemble my own from a recipe here and I think it was a little black pepper heavy.

The flavor was really good.  The hot with the sweet worked really well.  I just wish it had crisped up better. It was my first time making anything with butternut squash and so i didn't realise how prep intensive it was.  And it cooks down to alot less.

These were okay but I don't think I'll make them again.  Nothing special about them or the flavor.  I did salt them and place between paper towels to drain excess moisture as well as bake on a cooling rack on top of cookie sheet to help them crisp and that didn't even work
