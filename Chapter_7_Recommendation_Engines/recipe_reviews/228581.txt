Delicious! This was my first attempt at risotto and it was easy enough to be a success. It does take some dedication to stir, but it is well worth it. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. Next time around I will try a few changes: (1) I tasted the concoction all the way through cooking. The flavors were fabulous with each step and continued to build on each other. However, at the end when I added the parmesan cheese, it covered up some of the depth of the wine, chicken broth, and peppers. Next time I will add less cheese or try it with none at all. (2) I will not add salt while cooking the veggies. It's pretty salty as is. (3) I'm a person that loves the sharp bite of white wine. I would like to try adding another 1/4 cup of wine and reducing the chicken stock by 1/4 cup. These are just my ideas and I will mess around with it, but even without these changes the recipe was amazing. On a side note, I didn't have any portabellos so I used crimini instead. They worked perfectly.

Really good, simple recipe that lets the flavor of the Portabellos stand out.  This recipe is very versatile and can easily be modified to your individual taste. Get creative!

This is a great risotto for someone like myself that has never made it. I tried it with jasmine rice since this is what I had on hand. Now that I have a basic knowledge I will branch out and try the arborio and faro style risotto. Thanks for making this experience painless. Great flavors. The only thing I did different was use red and orange bell pepper in place of the green bell pepper.

I bet it's a five-start recipe when all the right ingredients are used.  I had to substitute the dry white wine with watered-down apple cider vinegar.  I only had jasmine rice and my mushrooms were plain white buttons.  And I used vegetable broth.  Thankfully I had heavy cream and Parmesan cheese!

I made this and pretty much followed directions as written. It was my first attempt at making risotto and believe it turned out pretty darn good. Better yet, my wife loved it!  We ate off this batch several times and enjoyed each one. It takes time and dedication but I'll make it again.

I haven't made this yet, I just wanted to know if I can make it without the wine since I don't drink alcohol or like alcohol
I'm going to give it 5 stars just because it looks really yummy

I love this risotto! I usually make half a recipe, and still use around 5 cups of vegetable broth. I use veggie broth so I can make this vegan. It is excellent, and I love the taste of the wine and the portabello mushrooms! The onions and bell peppers make this an excellent vegetarian or vegan dish! Thanks for the recipe!

As the risotto came to the finishing point and I tasted it, I decided it was rich enough and did not add the cream or the cheese. I served it with salmon and brussels sprouts. The wine in the picture is what I used both for cooking and to serve with the meal.

Served this with Pork Loin and a Port Pomegranate reduction sauce. The pairing was a nice balance. I actually amped up black pepper and white wine. Yes it's a bit tedious but turned out great and will remain in my favorites.

This is my husband's and my favorite recipe! I add garlic and Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute, but that's the only change. It takes awhile to make and needs close monitoring, so I don't get to make it as often as I would like. I make half of a batch and we have enough for 6 servings. I'll be making this for Thanksgiving this year, too.

This was overall a pretty nice dish. I've made a few risotto recipes, and I still don't think I know what a restaurant-quality risotto is supposed to be like, but I liked this quite a bit.
I made it almost exactly as written, using an Italian Pinot Grigio for the dry white wine.
The only hitch was the cooking time - I needed much longer. After a bit, I decided that "medium-low" wasn't enough, so I bumped my burner up to medium. I didn't stir it continually, non-stop, but I did stir it a lot. Even still, it took about 45 minutes until I thought enough stock was integrated.
If this were a restaurant dish, it would lose points for appearance. Before adding the cream and cheese, everything looked lovely. After the cream and cheese, it all looked like gray glop. However, I was glad to find out that it tasted much better than it looked. I was a little skeptical about the bell peppers in here, but they worked for me. The portobellos really made the dish, though, so overall I can recommend this recipe.

This recipe was great.  I made a few changes.  I used cremini mushrooms instead of portabello (I just like them more).  I used red bell pepper instead of green.  I also eliminated the heavy cream.  Still divine and creamy!

Great risotto recipe!  We left out the green pepper, because we don't care for them.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Risotto is a labor of love.  It needs to be cooked slowly, stirred constantly, adding a ladle of broth at a time, waiting until the liquid is absorbed before adding more broth.  It's time consuming, but well worth the effort in the end.  Creamy, flavorful and delicious!
