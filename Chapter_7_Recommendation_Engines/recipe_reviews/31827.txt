Yes Yes Yes!  Ohhhh, this was SOOOO good.  Lacking an oven bag, I wrapped the roast in aluminum foil and it came out WONDERFUL.  This will be THE pork loin recipe for me.  Thank you Denise!  Oh, and it makes wonderful sandwiches from the leftovers (if there are any) also.

Before trying this recipe, I read all of the reviews. Because of them, I rubbed the roast in garlic pepper and seasoning salt and then seared it. I mashed "Sarah's Applesauce," added the ginger to it, and then covered the roast with that mixture. I didn't have an oven bag, so I opted for a covered casserole dish. This dish was so excellent that my family has already put in a request for me to make it again next week! It's a 5-star recipe once you tweak it. Thanks. God bless.

This was delicious!  I bought a 6 lb. roast and put it in my slow cooker on low for 7 hours.  The ginger flavor was infused all throughout the meat.  Absolutely fabulous!  My company all raved about it!  Definitely a keeper and something I will use again for company and special events!

I didn't use an oven bag, just browned the roast on top of the stove, poured the sauce overtop and popped it in the oven.
I was surprised with how tasty this was.  My boyfriend kept talking about how good it tasted while he was eating it!  I make alot of different dishes, but he has never talked about the others like this.  Try this one girls...your man will be so impressed!

I had been looking for a quick, no mess way to cook pork loin and I have now found it!!  This recipe was super easy and delicious.  This pork was tender and had just the right hint of sweetness to it.  We ate this with mashed potatoes and green beans.  What a hit!!!! Thanks.

An instant hit!  Next time I will double the sauce ingredients because it is so yummy - the sweetness of the sauce went really well with my tangy mashed potatoes (I use hardly any butter and lots of lite sour cream).  I did change the recipe a little bit:  instead of flouring the bag, I put the flour on a plate and put a little of the measured ginger in the flour before putting the rest in the applesauce.  I dredged the roast in the seasoned flour and browned the roast on the stove.  I stirred the remaining ginger/flour into the applesauce (you could end up with a dry floury lump if you don't stir) and proceeded normally from there.  One of our new favorites.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Didn't use an oven bag, or brown it on the stove either, I just put it in a corningware dish & put it in the oven.  WOW it came out sooo juicy.  I used "sarah's applesauce" recipe from this site for and thought it turned out great & even though my husband the "non sweet eater" sensed the "sweet" in this & didn't hate it, while my 11 year old & I dipped the pork into the sauce & loved it.  Robert eating pork = a great recipe, thanks Denise!

This recipe was great!! The only problem I had was that I made a bigger roast than the recipe called for which required a longer cooking time. The sauce burned so there was no sauce to serve with the roast.

This recipe was exceptional and easy!  I did rub with garlic powder and pepper and browned on all sides.  I did not have a cooking bag but covered tightly with foil and it came out perfectly done in the stated time. Will definitely make again!

Although wonderfully tender I did not like the flavor of this roast. I followed the directions but found the sauce very bland. I did season and sear the meat first as recommended but held back of the seasoning expecting the sauce to carry the flavor. Big mistake. Next time I'll add more to this mix.

NEVER cook a roast to 160 degrees! at the most 150 degrees, while you let it rest the temp. will rise. you want your pork to be at 155 degrees anything more than that and it will be dried out!

This recipe is excellent!  But if you want an even simpler way to get the same kind of flavor, just buy a jar of apple butter - it already includes the same type of ingredients and it goes great with pork tenderloin.  Just pour over the top and cook in the oven bag.

WOW... This has to be the EASIEST and most DELICIOUS recipe I've made to date!!  I browned a 3.85lb pork loin roast on the stovetop in some butter.  Then I put some whole pecans on the bottom of my slow cooker and added the roast.  Finally I poured a double batch of the brown sugar sauce (made w/chunky applesauce) on top and let it cook for about 4 hours on high.  It came out perfectly tender and juicy... and the addition of pecans was an unexpected flavor bonus!!  Served w/mashed potatoes and Green Giant's frozen green beans w/almonds... I now have a new favorite dinner!!

You all will think I'm crazy, but I placed 2/3 jar of sauerkraut in the bottom of a foil lined baking dish. Then layed the pork loin on top of the kraut and then poured the sauce over the top. I wrapped everything in the foil and baked for about 1-1/2 hours. Served it with mashed potatoes.  The meat and kraut were seasoned perfectly, but I will cut down on the ginger a little next time.

This is the easiest, most amazingly delicious recipe.  You don't need to cook it in a bag.  I used the crockpot, just browning the pork first, (with a sprinkling of Beau Monde) putting the applesauce mixture in the bottom of the pot, dropping in the browned pork roast, cooked on low 8 hours. Served the 'sauce' remaining in the crockpot on the side.  For three days now, I have been receiving calls from dinner guests about the wonderful pork! Thank You for this fabulous, easy recipe!

What an amazing pork roast!!  I followed the recipe to the letter but just added a tablespoon of soy sauce to counter the sweetness of the gravy.  This was the most moist, juicy pork roast I have ever made.  Double the gravy if you like a dipping sauce - YUMMY!!
Thanks for sharing!!!

Amazing- really good- this is my recipe for pork roast now. I followed the recipe doubling the glaze because we like saucy- didn't have an oven bag so I covered with foil with potato, onion, and carrots. This was fork tender but not stringy- it was 2 lbs and cooked for about 1 hour and 10 minutes- for those who said it was dry- you overcooked it- you have to use a thermometer and cook to 150 and then take it out and leave it wrapped for 15 minutes- and it will keep moisture. This was not overly sweet either but we are sweet liking people. This is just fantastic- thanks for sharing!

Oh my GOD, people!!!  This is one of the best things I've ever made in my life!  I had a four pound pork roast so I doubled the ingredients - I also added a dash of liquid smoke, mustard powder, worcestershire sauce and a bit of soy.  The cinnamon applesauce is a MUST, it's perfect!  I will make this recipe forever!  I also just put in a 9x13 pan and covered with aluminum foil because I didn't have oven bags.

I am not that crazy about pork roast but this recipe was so simple and tasted great!!! I often use oven bags but was out of them so instead I put this roast in the crock pot. My roast was already seasoned with herbs so all I did was brown it on all sides I placed in the crockpot.... since I already had Apple butter in the fridge I used that instead of opening my jar of apple sauce and added the ginger and brown sugar... I also added carrots an onion, and fresh garlic.... cooked it on low for about 6 hrs. i had about an 3 lb boneless pork roast... I didn't even have to cut it... the meat was so tender and it just melted in our mouth... I served this with mashed potatoes and italian green beans.... We had leftovers and my husband is taking for lunch tomorrow. I will definetly make this again.... next time with the applesauce.

About 2 hours before bake time, I rubbed the roast with Adobo seasoning and just let it sit until seasoning was absorbed. Added a bit of onion to the bag and followed the recipe.  It was fantastic. My husband said he just followed his nose when he got home and out of his car and knew he had come to the right place! I served it with rice and my husband asked me to pack some for him for his lunch to take to work. Leftovers are just right for another meal for the two of us.  Many thanks!

This recipe was great. The only thing I did differently was cut down a bit on the brown sugar and ginger (I'm not a ginger fan.) I also seared all sides after rubbing with salt, pepper, and garlic. It was a hit with all of us! For those of you who ended up with dry pork, you have to learn HOW to cook pork. There are 2 ways to cook pork. Either until it's JUST done (internal temp. of 160°) so it's moist and holds together. OR you have to OVERcook it by several hours so the connective tissue has ample time to break down (falling apart stage). I've found the best way to cook pork is in a slow-cooker.  Cooking as directed in this recipe may vary since ovens are all different but once you learn the basics of cooking pork, it doesn't matter what the recipe tells you to do.

I was concerned about the amount of sugar in this recipe, but the reviews were so good I tried it anyway.  WOW!!!  It was unbearably sweet.  The flavor infused through the whole roast.  Normally a good thing, but my husband and I couldn't even eat it.  I gave it 2 stars because my kids devoured it!  Probably thinking I had somehow messed up and served dessert for dinner!  Thanks for the recipe, but unfortunately too sweet for me.

Absolutely the most moist & delicious pork roast ever!  A few changes:  I seasoned the roast well & then browned it.  After putting roast in baking pan, I placed a sliced onion, sliced bell pepper, & 2 whole garlic cloves around it.  I added 1/4 cup water, then put brown sugar & plain applesauce on roast.  I sealed tightly with heavy foil & cooked 2 hours.  The result was a flavorful, moist roast that I served with rice and the pan juice.  The best!!!

This recipe was so easy and had rave reviews from my family, especially my husband. He is not a pork eater but he actually asked me to make this again. This dish is also great as leftovers, especially in today's economy...you can stretch your $$ with great leftovers. I did sear this first and that does make all the difference as well as just using a baking dish with tin foil on top instead of investing in a bag. Also cook till it is almost done and let it sit out for 10 -15 min to allow the rest to cook and allow the juices to get through it. You won't have dry meat.

I used 2 small apples, grated and some cinnamon in place of the apple sauce. My roast was closer to 4#.  

I used a Dutch oven w/aluminum foil to seal the lid tight.  Got lots of juice.  

It took 3-4 hrs. to bake to tender.  Very nice!

Excellent. My boyfriend said it was to die for and couldn't get over that he didn't need a knife to cut it... it was so tender. I'm a garlic lover, so I stabbed holes all over and filled them with garlic slivers. I didn't have cinnamon applesauce so I used a teaspoon of cinnamon and reg. flavor apple sauce. I'm very happy with how this turned out. Thanks!

I used a 3 lb roast so added abt a half hr more cooking time and a little more sauce but this recipe came out delicious! So sweet and juicy..my husband can't wait for the next time and for myself the prep and cook time could not have been easier. This is a great and easy recipe so thanks for sharing it!

This was the best pork roast I have ever made or had!  I added a tablespoon of real maple syrup (not the breakfast kind) to the glaze, and per other reviews seasoned the roast with garlic powder and season salt and then pan seared it.  I didn't have an oven bag so I floured the roast and poured glaze over in a baking dish and covered tightly with foil while it baked.  It was so tender and juicy, the whole family couldn't get enough.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this in the crockpot.  Instead of applesauce, I chopped up 2 apples very fine. I tossed them with 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon,  and 1/2 tsp of ground ginger.    Seared the 2# pork loin roast in a pan (salted & peppered) first, then placed in crockpot.  I dumped the  apple/ brown sugar mixture in over it.   Cooked om low all day,  basting occasionally. As juice accumulated, I added a tsp of soy sauce.   When ready to serve, I uses cornstarch to thicken the gravy.   Not too sweet at all!  Meat was fork tender. Big hit w hubby!

This was wonderful! Quick to prepare, and the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork. I used unsweetened applesauce, and added cinnamon. I also only used about half the sugar. I had a 1 1/2 lb loin and it took 1 1/4 hours. I didn't have an oven bag, so I wrapped it in foil for the first hour and cooked it another 15 minutes with the foil open. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow - Excellent - I used a 4 lb pork loin, seasoned with garlic powder, s & p and seared in olive oil on the stove.  I then put in the slow cooker, and gradually poured the sauce over top.  Cooked on low until done and thickened gravy just a bit with cornstarch/water mixture. Just amazing - my best ever.  I used dark brown sugar because I had it on hand and non-sweetened applesauce with no cinnamon.  I can't wait to make this again next week.

This was okay. I wouldnt make it to serve as a savory style meal.  I liked it but I have a major sweet tooth.  It was difficult to manage the temp.  When I measured the temp of the meat, it was just a couple of degrees away from being done so I went ahead and took it out, let it rest for about 10 min. and it was still dry.  I guess, most pork loins are dry no matter how you cook them...... if anyone has a recipe that keeps it nice and moist let me know!!

This is a fantastic recipe! Like another viewer, I read ALL of the reviews before I tried this recipe. I didn't have applesauce, so I used one can of Luck's fried apples with cinnamon. I cut the ginger back to 3/4 tsp. and used the original amount of brown sugar for my 2 lb. pork loin roast. I used an oven bag. Now - 1 hour of cook time in my electric oven at 325°F was not enough time; so, I turned it up to 350°F for 30 more minutes - GREAT! It didn't "fall apart", but, it wasn't the "shoe leather" that I was afraid that it might be. Next time, I'll try 350°F for 1 hour. Thanks for a delicious recipe that I will cook again!

This was VERY yummy.  Everyone ate it, including my picky 4 and 1 year olds.  I didn't have cinnamon applesauce, so I took 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon and added it to the sauce.  Also, I chopped some apples and potatoes and roasted them with olive oil and cracked black peppercorns.  YUM!  The roast came out SO juicy!  Def. a keeper!

This roasted pork was easy and very moist.  The roast smelled very sweet in the oven but was not overly sweet in taste.  I usually don't like ginger but this dish had just the right amount.

I dont know why, but this did not turn out as great as I expected it...I lightly browned it and placed in aluminum foil, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was tougher than we like and lacked a little flavor (other than sweet). While I think the ingredients were great, I think the cooking method was probably not ideal, especially since my roast was a bit larger. Next time, I plan to do this in the slow cooker instead, that way the flavors meld better and the meat is more tender.

This was very tasty and juicy!  Like many others, I didn't have an oven bag so I improvised with aluminum foil.  It made a little mess in the pan, but it was well worth it.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.
I didn't have any ground ginger so I chopped some fresh ginger.  The subtle ginger taste was wonderful with the apple!
I've never had good luck with crock pots, so I took a chance on my kids following directions instead.  I prepared everything and wrapped the roast in foil in the morning, leaving instructions to put the roast in the oven while I was still at work.  It was easy and quick to throw together before work and easy for my kids help finish up.
This is saved to my recipe box and I'll make it again.

Yum! This makes the house smell good and the tastebuds dance! So good. I'll keep it as regular fall fare. I didn't have an oven bag, so just covered it with foil, and also quartered red potatos, placed them in the pan next to the roast and drizzled them in sauce. It took my almost-2-pound roast about 75 minutes to cook through.

Very good recipe!!  Even my family (who are picky eaters) said this was the best pork that I ever made.  The only thing I did different was to season the pork with garlic powder and pepper and brown it before I put it in the oven.

I didn't like the ginger taste at all.  The only saving factor was the leftovers were put into a good BBQ sauce and served on hamburger buns.  They were good.  I'll not make this again.

No complaints at all.  Really easy, very moist, cheap, cleans up great.  I didn't have cinnamon applesauce, so I just gave the applesauce a significant shake of cinnamon.  Uses a lot of ginger but the taste is great.

I really loved the taste of applesauce, ginger, and brown sugar.  It wasn't super sweet or candy like (like I was thinking), but moist and flavorful.  I didn't have a roast, or a roasting bag.  I had two 4 oz. lean pork loin cuts, and lots of tin foil.  And I didn't flour it.  This was my first time I made pork for my husband and I.  He actually liked it, he is super picky too.  So now I can add pork loin to our repertoire.  And this one was easy.  Paired it with baked sweet potatoes and stuffing. MMMM.

Very good and extremely simple.  Instead of cinnamon applesauce I used a peach-sauce product I had on hand and it worked fine.  The aroma from the kitchen was heavenly!  Because the roast is cooked in an oven bag, it doesn't get a caramelization or "crust" to it.  I somewhat missed that, so next time I may rub the roast with cinnamon, ginger and brown sugar and brown it in a dutch oven, and then finish cooking in the oven bag with the applesauce.  Worth a try!

I didn't have an oven bag so I used foil - it came out very moist. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Very moist with lots of flavor. My husband says it was a nice change of flavor.

Not a hit at our house, I'm not sure if it's supposed to or if I done something wrong but the meat was sweet, too sweet. I followed the recipe to the letter, but is not for our taste. I plan to pull the rest of the leftovers apart shred it up and make bbq sandwiches so the roast won't go to waste.

I made this just like the recipe said, i didn't have cinnamon apple sauce though, so I used regular. It was still amazing!  My children and husband loved it and ate the whole thing that night.  Awesome recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and this was the absolute best pork roast I have ever made.  Have made it 3 times now and each time was as good as the last.  So good that I was inspired to write my first allrecipes review.

I first made this recipe four or five years ago. We loved it. My husband asks for it all the time. Actually this is the only dish he asks me to make!!!

In a casserole dish with 2 tsp of soy sauce added. This was fantastic, and not too sweet! (unsweetened applesauce with cinnamon cut WAY down on the sugar). Will be making again soon, and it made the whole house smell fantastic!

The first time I made this it seemed a little overly sweet. I tried it again last night and decided to add some baby carrots and cut up red potatoes to the oven bag. It turned out perfect! The veggies picked up the sauce in just the right way to take away the overly sweet taste!

This is such a wonderfully easy recipe an it tastes great!  Very moist.  I follow the recipe exactly but I do not use an oven bag/flour.  I just put it in a glass bake dish with a lid.

My husband and his friend thought this was INCREDIBLE (I don't eat meat).  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and added 2 apples and cinnamon instead of the apple sauce, as well as 1 tsp of soy sauce and a pinch of garlic powder.  So easy too!

I made this in my slow cooker, and after having a taste found it too sweet for my liking. I added some soy sauce and cooked it for another hour. This made it better, but if I were to try this one again I'd halve the amount of brown sugar used. Meat was tender and moist; we'll be using the leftovers today for BBQ pork sandwiches.

This was really good.  Not as fabulous as it reads, but good.  I used a 4lb pork loin and doubled the ingredients.  I cooked it in my crock pot on high for 6 hours.  It was falling apart, very juicy and tender.  It was too sweet for my fiance; however I liked it.  

I used the leftovers and made barbeque shredded pork!

Ingredients:

Left over pork
Sweet baby rays BBQ sauce enough to make sloppy joe texture
1 large yellow onion chopped
1 cup of shredded carrots
pepper

mix all ingredients in the Crock pot, stir and cook on low for one hour.

Soooo yummy!

I made this recipe tonight and both my husband and I loved it! I made my own apple sauce and also added carmelized onions. One big "but" though- it wasn't even close to cooked in the time suggested. I ended up slicing the partially cooked pork and laying it in a single layer in a baking dish to finish cooking.

This was truly awful.  I even had the cinnemon applesauce...  I don't know what happened!  Everyone on here seems to like it, but it was just sweet-- I feel like I spoiled my nice roast!

This was a very easy and simple dish tp put together. Even though I had technical difficulties-my oven stopped working. So I marinaded the meat over night with the applesauce mixtures. I was afraid that the meat would turn out to sweet, but it didn't. I put the meat in the slow-cooker on the low setting for 6 hours. The meat was so tender and juicy. Thank you for this recipe.

Loved it!! very easy, very moist, wonderful recipe!! The only thing is use a meat therm. Unless you like rare pork. The cooking time didn't change with increasing the weight of the roast.(still said 1 hour for a 4lb. roast)

I'm not normally a big pork fan but this was delicious!  After reading other reviews, I cut back on the brown sugar a little (1/2 cup) and only 1 tsp ginger & added about 1 1/2 tsp worcestershire & 1/2 onion.  It took about 1/2 hr longer to cook, but wasn't completely thawed.  Came out moist & absolutely delicious!  Loved having it in the bag - no mess.

Excellent recipes, Simply delicious, however I have made it with and without the ginger and think the ginger can be a bit overpowering so I omit it altogether when I make it now.

This was really good, and the leftovers were even better!  I used freshly grated ginger...a little too much ginger for my tastes, but it was still really good. Reheated the next day, the ginger really mellowed and the apple tasted much stronger. I think this would have been great without any ginger at all, but if you like ginger, you'll love it. I used no salt added applesauce instead of the cinnamon. I had a little trouble with the oven bag for the first time...and since there were slits cut, the sauce leaked out into the pan. Next time I'll just put foil over the dish. Will definately make again.

i thought this was okay but my husband and 3 year old LOVED it. I did sear the roast with seasonings and I put in the crock pot on low. Was really moist and fell apart with a fork. I will be making again. Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  I too doubled the sauce and I definately tasted the apple in the meat; wasn't bland at all.  I cut slits in the roast and shaked garlic powder in them before I poured the sauce on it.  I used the oven bag and put the bag into my roasting pan and covered it with the lid.  Wonderful flavor!  My 4 year old daughter never eats meat because it's dry but she ate this!!!  Thank you for sharing!!!

So easy, fast, fork tender, and very juicy! I doubled the sauce because I always like to have extra, and it was great. The whole family loved it and actually told me to "keep this recipe". That hardly happens, only a few are ever asked for, and my grandma likes pretty much just chicken! No one thought it was too sweet as others had. Just enough sweetness to give something special to the pork. Great recipe!

Wow! What an incredibly easy and extremely flavorful recipe. I used this on a boneless pork rib roast and used regular unsweetened apple sauce (that's what I had on-hand) and added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. The flavor was outstanding and it was so easy to prepare and clean up! The second time I made this I threw in some potatoes and carrots with the roast. The came out amazing as well! My husband loved how moist the roast was. This will be a staple recipe for me now. Thank you!

Great recipe!  Had this last night and my family loved it. I didn't have the bag so just wrapped it in foil.  Also I seared the pork in hot oil first, just to seal the flavors in.  It was really delicious.  This was my first try at a pork roast and we will definitely be having this again!!!

Not really any taste except sweet, too sweet.  This is an interesting recipe so I am going to try this again using only 1/4 cup of brown sugar, add garlic, and soy sauce.  I have found that sweet and soy mingle well as far as our taste goes.

This was absolutely excellent!  I've been afraid of cooking a pork loin as I hadn't done it before.  This recipe sounded good and boy was it!  My pork loin was over 4lbs, but it still took just over an hour.  Even my 17 month old ate all of hers! Thanks!!!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe.  It was really easy to prepare (just took me 5 minutes to put together) but even with the brown sugar and applesauce, the pork was still very bland.  I like a little more kick of flavor and texture with my meals.  I won't make this one again.

My husband and step son really liked this one -- they eat their pork with apple sauce no matter how I prepare it, so this was a big hit with them.  I am not a big "sweet" pork fan, but the meat was tender and this was very easy to prepare and clean up -- I also doubled the sauce and was glad I did -- it makes it easy to heat up left overs as well!

Oh.My.Gosh. This was awesome, as is. I used regular applesauce and added some cinnamon. Instead of an oven bag I used a covered Dutch oven. You can make a gravy using flour or cornstarch and water with the juices. We all went back for 3rds. A keeper!

Hubby loved it!  I thought it was pretty good too! I pierced the meat all over before cooking.

This was really good and easy.  I reduced the ginger to 1 tsp and it was more than enough...I might even reduce it to 3/4 next time.  I didn't use an oven bag because I didn't have one.  Instead I put in a covered oven safe dish.

Fantastic meal.  Easy to make.  We do not like ginger in our family.  I interchanged garlic powder and basil for the ginger.  Part way through I basted/spooned some of the sauce over the pork and it added extra flavor.

As recommended by someone else, I rubbed garlic powder, salt and pepper on the roast and browned before wrapping in foil.

This is good and very easy, although after trying it as written the first time, we added some cayenne pepper the 2nd time. Added a little zing. Some hot sauce might also add that extra needed flavor. This one is a keeper.

I used foil instead of the bag and it was great! Moist and sweet, and really delicious! Other than the bag, kept to the recipe exactly!

Excellent! I think I cooked mine too long, as my loin was on the smallish side. My sauce was a bit too thick but this was definitely a crowd pleaser. I think I will add a bit more brown sugar next time, mine was not as sweet as we would have liked, but so tender!!!!

This recipe is great. It turns out a wonderfully juicy, slightly sweet roast every time. (I've made it 4 times already... haha) My husband loves it and so does my two year old. I don't use oven bags so simply put it in a covered casserole dish.

I thought this was perfect!  My husband thought it was a little on the sweet side, but only because I served it with other "sweet" stuff and he doesn't like sweet at all.  But he put a little soy sauce on his and said it was great.  I tried some of his with the soy sauce and had to agree... even though I thought it was perfect to begin with, the soy sauce made it even better.  I will definately make this again.

This pork roast wasn't as tender as I would have liked and without sauce on every bite it lacked flavor.If I could do it over, I would remove the roast from the bag,slice it,pour sauce over slices and bake a while longer.This was how I stored the leftovers and they were great reheated.

Instead of all the ginger called for I used 1/2 ground ginger and 1/2 ground mustard, didn't have applesauce so peeled, cored and diced 2 apples and 1 pear and threw everything (including cinnamon and extra brown sugar) into the crock pot with 1 1/2 cups of water on low for 8 hours. YUM!!!

This was sooooo good, tasty and moist, melted in your mouth.  I did not have a cooking bag so I put in a round glass casserole dish and covered.  I used a 1.44 pd  pork ribeye roast...I seasoned with garlic and onion powder, also seasoned with Tony Cachere Creole Seasoning.  I really did not measure the brown sugar (did not have light used dark) but it looked like 2/3 cup and maybe a little more than 1/4 cup of cinnamon applesauce.  I am not a big ginger fan, used approx 1/2 teaspoon.  I also used approx 1 teaspoon of soy sauce.
Baked for 1 hr and 15 minutes. Highly recommend.

I made this in the crockpot and it was wonderful!  Even both of my kids liked it and they never like the same things.  I used a 2.5 lb roast, left out the flour step, and cooked it for about 4 hours.

SOOOO GOOD!! Everyone loved it.
I sprinkled garlic and pepper on the loin and then lightly browned it in a pan. Then I used the sauce mixture (with only 1tsp of ginger cause I was scared) and poured that over the loin in a glass casserole dish. I covered tightly with tin foil and cooked in oven for 40 minutes at 325. For the last two minuted or so I took off the tin foil and put broiler on high to add some color to the loin. Once again, SOOO GOOD!! Even the three year olds loved it!!

This is an excellent recipe.  The only reason I did not give it a five is that it is one of those recipes where you will need to play around with and it will definetly become your family's favorite.  I was not too fond of the ginger and may lessen the measurement next time, but the recipe is a great starter.  I rubbed my pork loin down with black pepper, garlic powder, and season salt then seared it on both sides before i put it in the oven.  Very tender and once again excellent.

This was great! I cook alot and was suspicious of a recipe that called for so few ingredients. I read other reviews and added dashes and splashes of mustard powder, garlic powder , Janes Crazy Mixed Up Salt, onion powder, soy sauce& liquid smoke. I omitted the ginger but used the said amount of brown sugar and plain applesauce. Cooked it at 350 for an hour in the bag.Easy clean up and picky eaters loved it. Thanks!

I haven't tried this recipe, but in reply to "Snoops" request, whenever I prepare a pork or beef chuck roast, I always sprinkle the top of the roast with dried onion soup mix, then seal the top of the roaster with aluminum foil. Bake at 325 degrees for around 3 hours for a 4lb roast. Don't peak midway; and they always turn out very tender.

This is a great recipe...I brown my roasts first (usually in day old coffee) and marinate over nite and then either use the cooking bag, or if you have pre-browned and marinated, just cook it in a slow oven for a couple of hours.

Very good, flavorful and moist.  Mine wasn't falling apart, and I did end up cooking it for 1 1/2 hours for it to be cooked through.  I also used apple butter since I had no applesauce. I think next time I will use the crockpot though.  Very good sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this recipe! I did not have applesauce so I substituted with apple butter. It turned out fabulous! I will make it this way again. It made a really great sauce in the bottom of the bag to pour over the slices. Be careful in openingthe bag so you don't pour the sauce all over the pan. This way it makes an easy clean up as well! Enjoy!

The flavors of the sauce did not permeate the roast. Could only taste the apple at the edges. The amount of sugar was a bit much with the applesauce. May try again, but with perforating the roast so the flavors of the sauce can seep into the meat.

This is the best-taking pork recipe ever, and so easy to prepare, with little mess. It has been added to my list of favorite recipes.  I will be preparing this main entre for a Coast Guard dinner next week.  I know the Coasties will love it!

This is very good, the only reason I didnt give it a 5 is because to me the ginger was overpowering. I only put a tsp in the second time and put in a couple dashes of worcestershire.

Thank you for this recipe! It is one of my husbands "all time favorites". We use this recipe quite often. I use my mother-in-law's homemade applesauce, and pork tender loin to make it extra special. The pork is tender and flavorful every time! Thanks again!

I have the biggest sweet tooth in the world - so thought I would love this.  NO.  I did what so many others suggested; cut back on the ginger, added some garlic, browned the roast first - and just did not care for the sauce.  I will say that it tasted better on the pork than it did on the rice we had on the side - can't quite figure that one out! I gave it a 3 because my husband thought it was OK; but not great.  I don't think I have ever made a recipe where I liked all of the ingredients - but not the end product! do not see us making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, but more than doubled the meat.  I put a 3.5 pound and a 2.2 pound roast in the same big oven bag.  I also used the excess juice as a gravy which was great.  I had a dinner party for 12 people last night and they all (kids and adults) loved it!  I already have had requests for the recipe.  A perfect recipe for fall and I love that the clean up was just throwing away the bag!  Thank you so much.

Very good recipe. I used tin foil for the first half of the cooking time and then uncovered it. Everyone loved it but next time I might experiment more with spices.

I did a "quick fry" on the pork loin in a LITTLE veg. oil and lightly seasoned with garlic/onion powder (just so each side was lighly browned).  Followed the recipe from there.  Not amazing but very good and it still gets thumbs up for the ease of this recipe.  Pair this with some baked Baby Red potatoes and you've got a great dinner! Thanks Denise!

So simple and so good.  A very easy dish to make that puts a nice and quick twist to a pork loin.  While most things I give 5 stars are out of this world, this one gets 5 stars because of its ease in preparation and its taste--while not extraordinary, it's very good and deserves no "star deduction" simply because it's not unbelievably delicious.  I definitely recommend for those who simply would like a new, reliable recipe to add to their collection.

DEEEELICIOUS! My family loved it!  I didn't have applesauce so I finely chopped two golden delicious apples and added cinnamon to that. It was really good. Also cleanup was a snap with the roasting bag. I accidently took the temp to 170 and thought it may have dried out, but it was juicy.  I was surprised that the topping stayed adhered to the top of the roast even while i sliced it-that was great.

So glad to have found this recipe!!!!  I was looking for something quick and easy and this certainly fits the bill.  The roast turned out awesome and my husband, who is the biggest leftovers snob, ate it three days in a row until it was gone.  I doubled the sauce and added cut up potatoes and carrots in the bag.  So nice to have a full proof pork recipe--thanks for sharing!!!

This is a great recipe.  Very easy to do and everyone loves it.  We really like to have more sauce, so I usually use a small jar of chunky applesauce, add extra ginger and sugar.  I find that a dash of SALT in a recipe like this gives the sauce a richer flavor, and tones down the super-sweet taste.

This was excellent.  It had just the right hint of ginger and cinnamon, and was so moist you could cut it with a fork.  My guests enjoyed it very much.  It is a keeper in our household

I prepared this roast exactly as the recipe is given because it has been several years since I have roasted a pork loin, I usually find them to be too dry. The secret to this recipe is the oven bag!  I was going to change the sauce but at the last minute "what the heck, it will be something sweet", it was easy to fix too, almost too easy. The nice thing is that I'll use the leftover pork in a Chinese dish tonight so one small roast (3.5 lbs) will do double duty!

Tried this recipe last night.  It was just okay. I made it as directed, the only addition was a sprinkling of black pepper and garlic powder on the meat before pouring the sauce over. I found this had too strong of a ginger flavor for me.  I used the bag as directed, and though the meat was tender, it almost had a 'steamed' quality to it. I don't think I would make it again. If I did I would cut the ginger by at least half, add more spices and increase the applesauce, also roast it regularly and not use the oven bag.

I started this recipe this evening, but chickened out after finishing the prep work -- removed most of the applesauce/ginger/brown sugar combo, leaving behind only a hint on the pork surface before I stuck it in the oven.  Just seemed way too sticky sweet!!!!
The finished roast was actually pretty tasty, though -- juicy and tender.  My recommendation is that only a fraction of the ingredients recommended are needed for this recipe!!!

This pork wes sooo good and so dang easy!  I didn't have cinnamon applesauce, so I used plain applesauce and added a few dashes of cinnamon until it tasted right.  Instead of using an oven bag, I cooked the roast in a covered Corningware dish and it turned out perfectly.  My recommendation is to definitely put extra sauce on the roast, because the sweet gravy it makes is delicious on the meat and on potatoes.  I was glad I had extra.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

This roast is so easy to prepare and so delicious! It makes a great fall dinner. I have made it with an oven bag and with foil folded into a package with small vents, and both work great. I season the pork with a little salt and pepper before coating it with the applesauce mixture. Last time I roasted potatoes in the same dish with some EVOO, rosemary, and black pepper.

OMG!!! This is awesome. So very simple. The mix of the applesauce and brown sugar makes a nice glae and the ginger adds some nice variation to the sweetness.  I di add some thyme, salt, pepper, onion slices, and cayenne pepper to my cooking bag and this was awesome!!

Made this for a group of friends who have varying tastes - and they all raved!  Thanks for this easy recipe.  I didn't have bags so cooked them in a casserole tented with foil - juicy, tender, and wonderful!

so i doubled the recipe exactly as written, didn't change anything.    however, i used my slow cooker and wasn't really happy with the outcome.  flavorwise it was delicious but the pork was not moist or fork tender.  dunno what it is but i can't seem to get good results when i use the darn thing to cook pork (we don't eat beef).  my roast was 2.3 pounds and i cooked it for nearly 5 hours on high.  it was almost overdone even though there was plenty of liquid.    but i'm going to make this again in the oven.    anyone care to comment/advise on why i can't seem to get a moist tender pork roast using the doggone cooker?  it is most frustrating!!  i'm inclined to throw the darned thing away!  and its only been used 3x!!!

Very tasty and very easy! I used the slow cooker for this recipe. I rubbed the roast with salt and pepper and seared it, put it in the slow cooker, and poured the rest of the ingredients over the top. I put it on high for one hour, and low for 5-6 hours. I also basted it occasionally. I had a few carrots that I wanted to use up, so I chopped them up and added to the pot for the last 1-2 hours. Delicious - like candied carrots! Very flavorful. Next time, I would probably cut back on the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. Thank you!

My family loved this!  Like others I rubbed the pork w/garlic and other spices and then seared it before roasting. I doubled the applesauce and next time will probably triple it - also added 1/8 tsp each of nutmeg and all spice.  I used the cooking bag and added a sliced tart apple and 4 chopped garlic gloves. My hubby says it's a keeper!

I made this for my mom and sister last night and we really liked it! I'm not sure what an oven bag is so I made it in a corningware with tin foil covering it.  I'm very bad for adjusting recipes, so I used 1/2c brown sugar (I might cut it down to 1/3c as it was pretty sweet), one snack container of unsweetened applesauce, and 1 1/2t fresh ginger.  I think the fresh ginger that made it! Like another reviewer, I did miss the crust, so I may try rubbing the ginger and sugar on first and browning it in the oven, slightly, before adding the applesauce.  Thank you for the great recipe Denise!

I love this recipe and I have used it on many occasions.  It has become a staple in our house.  I use the same ingredients but I throw it all into my crock pot and it turns out fabulous.  I also use any pork roast that I have on hand or is on sale.  Then I take the leftovers and cook it with a can of Mexican Style stewed tomatoes for a sweet and spicy pork taco.  YUM!

VERY Good. Made a chopped garlic/salt/pepper paste & browned in skillet & put it in my crock pot on high for about 4 hours. Added a tablespoon of soy sauce in mixture. Fell apart when sliced. Will make again & everyone loved it!

I'm not sure how to rate this- I mean- I do enjoy sweet meat- like honey garlic or hoisin sauce- and I really really wanted to like this recipe after seeing so many great comments. I didnt have a bag but I did use a covered baking dish- and I didn't use "Sarah's Applesauce" either I just added some cinnamon sugar mix I had on hand, and the problem was not the applesauce- I had a fairly small roast so I thought it would only take an hour to make but in my convection oven it took 2 hours to reach the 160 degree reading. I did use a small amount of cornstarch to thicken the apple sauce after removing the meat and like I said, there was nothing wrong with it- I guess it just didnt tickle my fancy.

I made this on Christmas Eve for family and got rave reviews from everyone.  I used a 5 lb pork roast so I doubled the ingredients.  I rubbed it with a little salt and pepper a few hours before roasting.  Based on other reviews, I also added a few tablespoons of soy sauce.  Cooked it in a bag for about 1 hr 45 minutes and let the meat rest in the bag for 20 minutes.  I reduced the sauce to a glaze and drizzled it over the meat.  The meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  Served it with red potatoes roasted in the oven with olive oil and sea salt, and green beans sauteed with almonds.  Yum!  Shredded the leftover pork and mixed it with some bbq sauce for another yummy meal. Thanks for posting this recipe, will definitely make again!

Easy and delicious!  It made the inexpensive roast I bought butter knife tender and mouthwatering.  Not only that, but my five year old son, who's generally a picky meat eater gobbled it up!  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.  I used a casserole dish as others have mentioned instead of an oven bag with success.  I think I'm going to try adding a garlic powder rub next time because we're such garlic fans, but I don't think it necessarily needs it.

WOW! Awesome. I generously salt & peppered the pork then put it in a super hot pan with a little olive oil just to sear the outside. Then I put it in a small roaster with tinfoil over the top. I made some slits in the tinfoil. Because my roast was small (1.18 LBS) I used a meat thermometer to know when it was done. Once I pulled it out I let it sit with the tinfoil over the top for about 10 minutes. I sliced it then poured the sauce over the top. It was amazing, so tender and the sauce added so much. I will ABSOLUTELY be making this again. My husband said he felt like he was eating out!

This is good. Next time I make this I will punch up the spices with some salt and pepper a bit and maybe let it marinate in the rub so some of the sweetness can soak into the meat. Overall, very moist and good.

Made in crockpot as this was a busy day. (On high, set for 6 hours and then it automatically goes to low). I am a big fan of the oven bags though, this would be great that way I am sure. House smelled so good when I came in! The cinnamon applesauce I used was sweetened with Splenda, and I didn't pack the brown sugar because, um, we are supposed to be watching that. This just sounded so good though!  I used a 2 lb pork tenderloin, did not brown first (I never do) and served with rice, green beans, and the cinnamon applesauce also as a side. Ginger as listed. I poured off the crockpot juices into a saucepan and thickened with cornstarch mixed in with about 1/3 cup water, brought to boil to thicken it. Served the sauce over the pork and also the rice. Very good. Hubby gave 4-1/2 stars, I'd say 4 if this were any sweeter as written. Will make again and I'm giving the recipe to my young adult kids- easy, cheap especially when the meat is on sale, and tastes great.

We loved this recipe! I used a pork tenderloin and rubbed it with some cinnamon, ginger, and brown sugar. I injected the loin with the applesauce and used a little bit of maple syrup, too. I also basted it with the applesauce occasionally throughout cooking. I cooked this on a rotisserie and it came out great! I will definitely make this again.

This was ok, but I felt it was lacking a little in flavor.  I think I may try it again, but would rub some seasoning on the meat prior to browing it, and placing it in the bag.  Three out of four of us enjoyed it, I was the odd person out on this recipe.

This was very easy and tasty.  It got great reviews from my guests.  My only complaint, is that I wish it had more of the apple sugar flavor infused in it.  I poured some of the sauce it cooked in over it, and that was very good.  I'll make again.

i made this pork last night for supper...mmm! my hubby&i really liked it, the pork was tender and not at all dry-even though i had to cook it nearly an hour longer than suggested! it took 2 hours for a 2 pound pork roast to reach internal temperature-and i jacked the oven up to 350, after a little more than an hour! and no i didn't open the oven, etc...i'm thinking my oven may be a bit off or something. but anyway-we LOVED the meat and the sauce too! i made mine in a glass casserole covered tightly with foil. and i WILL fix pork roast again this way! thanks!

Like others did I first browned the outside (in olive oil) after adding garlic and onion powder, salt, black pepper, and dusting of flour. I doubled the recipe of applesauce, brown sugar, and ginger but had a 1.5 lb roast. Cooked in a tightly covered aluminum foil covered baking sheet. Came out great in the time prescribed. I got compliments all around! Great recipe! Thank you.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We had it tonight. I didn't change a thing except I didn't have a bag so I just used my small roasting pan.  It was so moist and so good.  It is definitey a keeper. Good job Denise

I have had repeated failures with pork loins roasts in the past, boneless or not, no matter which way it was prepared, always turning out dry.  Thinking that it would turn out differently this time, I gave it a try using John Morrell's boneless centercut pork loin, and had mixed results.  Half of the pork which had more dark meat (tenderloin) was moist but the other half (all white) was very dry. Reading the other reviews leads me to believe that those who had "fork tender" results used a pork tenderloin, whereas those who had dry results used a pork loin roast. Two different cuts of meat, with the tenderloin being by far the best cut of pork.  Always tender and flavorful, no matter how its prepared.  I'll agree with most that the sauce was sweet, but certaintly added an interesting taste to an otherwise bland cut of meat.

I don't know why all the high ratings on this recipe.  I did like another reviewer, and cooked mine in the slow cooker.  Even though I used less sugar than called for, it was much too sweet, and was nothing special.  I should have sliced into medallions, and pan roasted in a little olive oil, rosemary and lemon pepper.  This in a no-go for me.

AMAZING!  The perfect combo of pork chops & applesauce.  Don't let the brown sugar scare you into thinking this is too sweet because you can monitor how much glaze you put on each slice after you cut into the loin.  I'm eating my leftovers in a sandwich right now - yum! (and not dry at all)

Made this for dinner and it was a big hit.. I did add 2 tablespoons lite soy sauce to make sure it wasn't overly sweet.. I only had unsweetened applesauce without cinnamon, so I added 1 1/2 T cinnamon to the sauce.. Will make again, maybe put some sliced apples on top of the pork roast??

Amazing!  My husband said that this is his new favorite recipe!  I did double the recipe for the sauce, and cut the roast into 1 - 1 1/2 inch slices, just so it would cook faster and so we could be sure it was cooked thoroughly.  (Don't know if that made a difference with the pork absorbing even more juice?)  I was afraid it might end up too dry (which usually happens when we cook pork), but it was so extremely moist all the way through.  My three kids (ages 1-5) and husband LOVED it, so it will definitely be a regular item in this household.  Thanks for sharing such an amazing (and easy) recipe!!!

This was awesome.  I used a larger roast and had to cook it a little longer and it was a little dry.  Next time I will cut the larger roast in half so I can cook it a shorter amount of time.  The flavor was excellent and I do not like any kind of fruit or sweetening on my meats.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was an easy, quick recipe.  I added peeled chunks of butternut squash into the bag.  Everything came out delicious....I picked up the bag so that all of the gravy etc. into one corner, snipped of the corner and drained it all into my gravy boat. The applesauce mixture made the perfect topping!  My husband and two children loved this and because of the apple/sugar gravy, I was able to get the kids to eat the butternut squash!

I made this for my family last night and WOW! I did add a couple tsp of soy sauce and a couple tsp of worchestershire sauce as some others had said just to knock down a little of the sweetness. I think this is the juciest pork loin I have ever cooked. Not sure if it was because of the bag or just the recipe, but my whole family loved it! I will be making this one again! Thanks for a great pork recipe!

This wasn't terrible.  We ate it, but I wouldn't make it again.  It was very bland, and that was not what I expected.  After reading the reviews, I knew it was a gamble, because some people raved about it, and others were non-plussed.  Add me to that last group.  Sorry.

This was an easy and delicious way to fix a pork loin.  I didn't have any applesauce, so I substituted apple butter, added a few shakes of cinnamon and it was delicious. I really hate to open a whole jar of applesauce for just a 1/4 cup anyway, so it was a good substitute for me since I already had the apple butter in the fridge.  Thanks for this recipe.  It was great and I'll be making it again.  Love the sauce!

Great & easy recipe. I followed the instructions, but next time I will add garlic powder, a tbsp of ketchup and lessen the ginger. Also will probably just bake in foil as those cooking bags are costly and no need for them!Thanks..

Great recipe- gravy was awesome on mashed pots too.  Sauerkraut on the side- UMM..  However, pork was too done after an hour- make sure you keep a thermometer in the meat to get an accurate reading and not dry out.  Will make again!

Great recipe. The pork turned out very tender (although beware that the cooking time stated in the recipe is not adequate to cook even the smallest roast, it will likely take 2-4hrs)

This is an amazing recipe!!  Followed it exactly except seasoned with garlic powder & pepper.  Really tender with a lot of flavor.  If you don't like sweet gravy this may not be for you but my family raved about it.  Will definately make this again!!

This was not really to my taste. Much to sweet and needed more zip.  I did add onion, which helped a bit, but still needed more flavor.

I had never cooked a pork loin before but this recipe was very easy to follow. I had my in-laws over for dinner and wanted to make something differnet for dinner. They absolutely loved it! The clean up was very easy and most importantly it was very juicy, tender, and tasty!

I made this with pork chops instead of roast and it was so good.  A great change from the usual!  And, very easy too!

This recipie was a life saver for me! My mother was sick for Chrsitmas and I had to cook my first pork roast (10 lbs) at 6 am on Christmas morning! I improvised the applesauce with 3 apples in the microwave. I didn't have enough brown sugar or applesauce, but it tasted great. The sugar and ginger added a lovely flavor and it was so moist. I also didn't have an oven bag, so I covered the roast with tin foil. I will definitely make this again! Thank You!

We enjoyed this recipe, although I found it to be a bit bland.  The ginger & cinnamon spices are nice, but I think this dish needs a little more depth.  Browning the roast first may help, and add some rich brown gravy or kitchen bouquet or soy sauce. We roasted cut up potatos & carrots along with the meat & they were a nice addition.

This was a big disappointment to us.  It wasn't dry, but it had absolutely no taste and I followed the recipe to the letter.  My husband really disliked it!

AWESOME! My family can't get enough of this tender and delicious roast. I first use a garlic salt rub. I sometimes use chunky applesauce.

As the only meat eater in the house, I used a 150g pork loin chop and my veggie other half had a veggie burger. Didn't have any apple sauce in so used a dessert apple microwaved with a bit of lemon juice (like I normally make apple sauce anyway) and then added half a teaspoon of cinnamon to it. Reduced the sugar amount and added a ton of black pepper as I was concerned it would be too sweet. Have no idea what an oven bag is so made a tinfoil tent as other users suggested. Will have this again and would serve it to impress at a quick n easy sunday lunch. Didn't fin it too sweet but had to add extra oil and water with the veggie burger.

The sauce was too sweet.  It didn't quite go well with the pork roast.  The family had to cut away all parts of the roast that was marinating in the sauce to rid of that taste.  We had to make a package pork gravy in order to eat the roast.  Sorry!

Added garlic and used regular applesauce turned out a bit less dessert like.
Perfect for children and adults!

This was an easy recipe.  I lve the oven bags ( I use them for tukey too. Clean up is fast and the meat does not dry out.  I did not use ginger.  After I poured the sauce into a pan and added a tsp of cornstarch to thicken.  The gravy made the dish!

Bland and tough best describes this recipe.  My husband said to give it 4-stars.  I wanted to give it a 2.  Either way, we both agreed the applesauce mixture did very little to the pork.  I think the only reason my husband enjoyed his serving was because he drenched it in barbecue sauce.  I also expected "fork tender" consistency after reading the reviews.  That wasn't the case.  Preparation was quick and easy.  And cooking in the oven bag made clean up a snap.  Unfortunately, that was the only highlight of this meal.  I'm keeping this recipe, but I don't think I'll be making it any time soon.  If I do, I may cook it in a crockpot.  Hopefully that would add some flavor and a fork tender texture.

I made this in a clay pot and it came out beautifully.  Not as easy a clean-up than if I had used the oven bag, but it certainly was just as moist and tasty.

Since I was using a clay pot, I changed the oven temp to 450 F. and followed the manufacturers directions for my pot.  Other than that, the rest of the recipe was the same.

The ginger wasn't too overpowering, and the sweetness was perfect.  This will certainly make it's way to my dinner table again.

This was fantastic!  It smelled spicy while cooking but the flavors did not overpower the pork at all.  I have a knack for drying out pork but this turned out VERY moist.

I've made this pork roast over a dozen times and it turns out delicious every single one. I have always made it in the crockpot wrapped in foil. I've used both strawberry applesauce and plain with success. This is my husband's favorite pork recipe and I just placed it in the crockpot for dinner today!

After reading reviews, I seasoned a 3 lb loin with pepper, salt, ginger, pumpkin pie spice, poultry seasoning, garlic and onion powders.  Drenched in flower and seared in a pan with olive oil on all sides before putting into the crock pot.  I cut slits on the top and poured a cup of brown sugar and 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce over top.  I also added 1/2 c chopped onion to the crock.  It was done on low in about 3 hours.  I strained the juice and reduced for a sauce that I poured over top to serve.  Even the picky eaters loved it.

The glaze is the winner here. I left out the sage and used red wine vinegar for this recipe. The first time I made this I used pork shoulder and baked it in the oven. The second time I made this was with ham (in water) in the crockpot. With the ham, it slow cooked for 5 hours and then I made the glaze on the  stove. I emptied the water out of the crockpot and spooned on some glaze. I minced a clove of garlic and put it on top of my glaze on the ham. Like the recipe said, I applied the glaze 3 more times over the last 30 minutes.  Having this with ham gave my dinner a holiday feel.

I'm always looking for quick and easy recipes, and this is one of the easiest. I was worried about it being too sweet but it was just right. Like others, I didn't have a cooking bag, but used foil and it worked just fine. This will go into the rotation!

Loved it.  After an hour, my roast was rarer than I would have liked, so I sliced it, poured the juice over it and put it back in the oven for 10 minutes.   It was perfect.  Very tender and my picky eater, 85 yr old father loved it and asked for a dinner plate for the next day.   (He normally will not eat what he thinks of as leftovers.)

This was very tasty. My grocery store doesn't carry oven bags, so I lined a casserole dish with tinfoil and baked as directed and it turned out great (I used pureed ginger, about 2 TBs  because I love ginger. But it was a lot of meat for one person, so I tried it again with two pork loin chops. It was even more delicious - cooked in about half an hour.

Very yummy and easy to prepare!  I am sure this is just as tasty as is, but I had to make a quick substitution of regular applesauce and pumpkin pie spice.  Husband keep saying how great it smelled while cooking.  Made garlic dill mashed potatos.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was soooo easy and delicious!  I did use some reviewer suggestions and rubbed pork with roasted herbs and garlic before covering with the sauce.  I baked it in a covered casserole.  Very moist and tender.  Next time I'm going to try adding some cubed butternut squash or sweet potatoes to the casserole dish.  Definitely a keeper!

This is delicious!!! Like other comments, I also seared it in a pan before roasting it.  And I didn't use an oven bag either, but simply put it in a casserole dish and covered it with aluminum foil. So good!!

No bag so wrapped in foil after browning.  For sauce I used honey  mustard, orange juice and whole berry cranberry sauce because it's what was on hand.  Turned out tender and tasty.

Wow! Pretty surprised how good this was! Did not really change a thing just make sure too be heavy handed on the s+p. I did marinade it for 8 hours because I was worried about the reviews saying this was bland. I also just put it in the oven uncovered for 375 for 1h 10 mins.Than let it rest for 15 mins. Cannot wait too make this in the fall:-)

This was a big hit at my home. Son says "best pork loin that came out my kitchen". I did use modifications though due to what I had on hand. I used unsweetened applesauce and added cinnamon powder to it then followed recipe. Great Hit!!! Thank You for this recipe!

I just had a kidney transplant in December and during my hospital stay I had the best roast pork. I wanted to make it at home and found this easy recipe. I used regular apple sauce and added some cinnamon, a little soy sauce and the rest as written. I covered in foil and baked as directed. It was the best, moist and juicy! Didn't care to much for the juice, I used a little corn starch to thicken. It was okay. Loved the roasted pork, will make again!!

It was great!!!!! But the time in which the meat was not pink, the cook time was more than an hour at 325 degrees. It took at least an hour and a half. But we all loved it, once it was done!!!!!

VERY tasty recipe.  I, too, doubled the sauce and it was wonderful spooned over the pork.  Served with boiled potatoes and broccoli salad.  Looking forward to tomorrow nights leftovers!  Will definitely make again.

I love this.  I used pork loin country style ribs and only cooked for about 30 minutes.  I used a jar of my apple sauce.  I put it in a corning ware dish in oven.  Had room to add some fresh dug sweet taters with it.  Delicious .  Definitely a keeper.  I did season the pork too.

Didn't have oven bag, so used foil, and it cooked very unevenly, but tasted great once it was completely done.

I used an oven bag and the pork was moist and tasty.  The sauce flavor was good but not thick enough for me. Maybe I'll reheat the sauce next time to thicken it.  The recipe is easy and quick. Just like everyone said.

Had a boneless loin about 2 lbs..browned it with some sliced garlic, salt and course ground pepper, put it in the crock pot, poured sauce mix (followed directions)  over it...cooked on high for one hour, and about 5 hours on low.  It was wonderful. Got rave reviews from my picky eaters, as well as my anything goes eaters!!

This was so easy and soooo good! I used pork tenderloin, cooked for about 30 minutes in a 425 degree oven in a covered casserole dish and it was really juicy and yummy. I cut the sugar in 1/2 as well and didn't have cinnamon applesauce, so I used one of my son's Mott's applesauce cups and added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon. An absolutely PERFECT recipe for a busy, working Mom of two - requires such little prep and cook time it's a great, healthy weeknight dinner. Served with corn on the cob. My husband really enjoyed it and my 2 1/2 year old gobbled it down. This is definitely a keeper!

I have done a full pork loin with this recipe for clients at work with the calculator. I only had regular applesauce so I added cinnamon. There were no leftovers and some clients asked for the recipe.   Today I am at my camper and it is a cool rainy day. I used my slow cooker with 5 lb pork loin and put it on low for 5 hours. My husband enjoyed it this wy too. Definitely can be cooked different ways and still is a delicious and easy meal!!

After reading all the reviews I was very excited to try out this recipe. Unfortunately, I found it far too sweet for my liking. I was a little apprehensive of the sweetness to begin with, so I cut the brown sugar in half and I still found it too sweet in the end. While I didn't enjoy the flavor I did enjoy how tender the pork was.

the only reason I gave this 1 star was it was easy to make. I followed the recipe to a T. I cannot understand how it could be sooo bad compared to all who raved about this recipe. all little confused as it says 1 1/2 tsps of ground ginger. So I put one and a half teaspoons, or does it mean add one half a teaspoon?? anyway I would love to be able to make a GREAT pork roast with awesome gravy and mashed potatoes. when looking for a recipe I spotted this one and tried it, But not again.

This was probably the best pork roast I have done.  Made a few modifications, I used 4oz of applesauce, didn't have cinnamon applesauce so I added cinnamon to the applesauce. I also peeled, cored and chopped up a gala apple and added it for the sauce.  Needed to cook the pork longer than the 1hr, but no worries, it came out GREAT.  Everyone in my family really enjoyed it and we have a little left over for a sandwich and one other dinner.  Thank you for all the reviews it does help.

My family loved this!! Even my 4 yr old who only likes hot dogs and chicken nuggets had seconds.  I highly recommend this one.  I did rub it with garlic and pepper, then browned it on stove top, but other than that, I found it to be perfect as is.

This was pretty good and very easy to make.  I used light and brown sugar and did a 6 lb roast instead of 2 lb, so I increased the ingredients accordingly.  I did season the meat beforehand too.

I used pork tenderloins and cooked in a slow cooker on low for about 7 hours. I first seasoned it with garlic powder, salt, pepper and cayenne and browned it in the skillet. The meat fell apart when I tried to take it out of the slow cooker and it shredded up so I couldn't slice it. My husband thought the ginger overpowered everything else. Next time I would double the sugar and applesauce but leave the ginger the same.  Overall I liked this dish because it was easy and had a pretty good taste.

I prepared this for Easter dinner.  It was absolutely delicious.  I used applesauce that I had in my freezer and added cinnamon.  I also used ginger paste for the ground ginger.  The pork was moist, not too sweet, and very tender.

It's just my wife and I so we did have a smaller roast. Did not use the bag, seared in a pan and wraped it in foil and baked it on a cookie sheet. I did double the sauce but not the ginger,not big on ginger.Definitively will have again.

My family loved it and I loved how easy it was to make.  Spending less time in the kitchen means spending more time with my family.  This will probably become a regular meal in my house.

This is an AMAZING recipe!! Following some of the other reviewers, I made the homemade applesauce and put in crock pot, turned out moist and tender. Was FANTASTIC!!! All my guests loved it, including the picky ones!!! Will definitely make again!

My whole family  (including a 2 and 5 year old) really liked this recipe. I didn't have any brown sugar, so didn't add it, but it still tasted wonderful! Very moist, with a great little pizazz with the ginger.

I have mixed emotions about this recipe.  I liked it generally, but it WAS a bit sweet.  It's needs something to add a savory touch to it. It was very tender and I didn't dry it out....I have a tendency to do that.     BUT....on the down side, I think I must be allergic to ginger because I was in the ER after eating this with hives!  LOL

Good flavor, but it would be nice to play around with some ways to counterbalance the incredible sweetness.  My kids ate it, and we all enjoyed it, but I think next time I'll do a little more experimenting with this as a base recipe (as it was I rubbed in salt, pepper & garlic powder & browned the meat before roasting, but it still felt a little one-note to me).

This was truly delicious- EASY and successful. I didn't have an oven bag an simply used tin foil...perfect, moist and really flavorful pork loin. The leftovers made fantastic sandwiches- just as good as the first time around.

Yumm!  I followed the directions using the oven bag, but seared the roast (as several reviewers suggested) prior to putting into bag. I found it took about 1-1/4 hours for a 2 pound roast. Makes a delicious sauce for the pork.  Very easy but impressive for dinner guests.

This was a very simple recipe that turned out great. I knew I would be short on time, so I threw all of this in the crock-pot with a mostly frozen roast and turned it to HIGH. So tender and so delicious! I think I will double the recipe next time and shred the leftovers with some BBQ sauce for some pulled prok sammys!

I made this a while back and I am going to make it again this week with a few personal adjustments. Although it came out good the way it is written I am going to also rub the pork with salt, pepper, and garlic then sear the pork. I also am going to cut the ginger down as it is such a strong flavor to me.

I just found this recipe and am thinking about trying it. It sounds good and easy. 
 In response to those people who complained about it being dry and what to do to fix that - try brining it the night before.  Depending on the size of the roast, as little as 1 or 2 hours would be enough.  I have brined pork chops before and it really makes a difference in taste, texture and keeping it from being dry.

This was great!  I made a cheap pork roast in the crockpot with this basic sauce.  Following others suggestions, I put garlic powder, salt and pepper on the roast before pouring the sauce over.  Since I only had regular appleasauce, I added about half a teaspoon of cinnamon to the sauce.  Cooked it in the crockpot on low all day and it was delicious!  I'm making it next week for my supperswap.

Huge hit with my family. I doubled the sugar mixture based on the reviews but this is a wonderful recipe. I plan to use it many times.

I am not a cook!  I was looking for an easy recipe and came across this one.  While  it was good, I am not sure it was as good as it was supposed to be.  I may have messed up by not trimming away the fat????  Our "sauce" was very soupy and the pork was very bland.  It may also have been because I used chunky applesauce rather than regular applesauce.  I did read one of the reviews which allowed me to wrap it in aluminum foil since I was out of oven bags. I plan to try this recipe again and hope that it will be even better the second time.  Thanks!

I love pork loin. I think it's the best cut of meat of the entire animal. That said, I felt that the marinade was too sweet for sweet sake, and lacked something of a tang to really spruce up the dish. Perhaps next time I'd use less maple syrup and more dijon, or add some sort of vinegar; perhaps I'll have to find the proper side dish to accompany this, something not sweet to counterbalance the meat. 

Actually... I don't think I have much interest in redoing this recipe, but I might use it as a base to swap some ingredients and add some flavour.

Wonderful!!!! The name of the recipe is an accurate representation of what you are cooking, its too easy. I made it in my crock pot and every 2 hours or so I would turn it and bast it with the juices. My husband said it was the best pork he has ever had.

This was sooo easy to make and very tasty and I would make again. I usually make this pork roast with garlic and I wanted something different and everyone liked it. I also doubled the sauce.

I have been trying to get my hubby to like pork roast for so long, and this recipe didn't work either. :(  He asked,"What is that funny taste?" My pork was tough also. I guess it is back to the ole sauerkraut and hours of cooking method only on New Years. LOL

Thanks anyway

No one was thrilled with this recipe.  The flavor just wasnt there.  I used a pressure cooker and you'd think that the flavors would have intensified.  I will stick to cooking my pork with onions, carrots and potatoes. I was disappointed in this recipe.

Good flavor, but quite sweet.  Try using less brown sugar. If applesauce is real watery, sieve out some of the liquid.  Don't overcook.  (An hour may be too long on a 2 lb roast).

I didn't have an oven bag, so I just used a casserole dish with a lid. I wasn't that impressed with the results. It's an easy, quick recipe, but not the most delicious pork I've had. And I think the cut that it calls for is a little tough for the topping. Maybe this would be good with bone-in pork chops - something a little more tender.

I made this dish last night in the crockpot and the flavor of the juice infused into the meat so it was really tasty.  I did add one teaspoon of soy sauce as others had suggested. I did not find it too sweet, but the roast was dry. I still gave it 5 stars because I think I may have cooked it to long causing the dryness. Will try again with a larger roast.

If you don't like ginger, skip this recipe but if you do, this was great! I added a little Lawry's Seasoned salt, onion powder and garlic powder to the flour and cooked the 3.25 lb roast at 350 for about 75 min. I doubled the sauce and had plenty leftover. It was delicious over rice. You could probably cut back on the ginger a bit and this would still be good. My picky kids liked it too (but I didn't put sauce over theirs). Will definitely make this again.

This was my first time to cook a pork loin, and it was delicious.  I put a little seasoning salt and flour and browned it then added the applesauce, ginger and brown sugar.  I baked it in a cast iron skiller covered with foil, and it was so tender.  Yummy!

Really good! Only change was to season pork with salt/pepper and garlic and seared all sides before roasting.  Tender and juicy and made great leftovers!

I really enjoyed not only making, but eating this roast!  It was easy to prepare and had a great flavor.  My only problem was that mine came out slightly overcooked, even with checking the temp.  I always forget things cook faster at high altitude.  Great recipe!

Super easy!  Made this dish for Mother's Day and the family loved it.  Everyone raved about the 'sauce' which we used not only for the pork, but also for the mashed potatoes.  Will certainly be filed in the 'family favorites' category.

I'd probably give it 3.5 stars. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. I don't have ground ginger, so I used some jarred ginger. I found that a bit overpowering, but that was a change I made. I did add some thinly sliced onions to balance the sweetness. Overall, it was a nice recipe.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  My pork was not fall apart tender as other reviewers stated.  It was a little tough.  In the last five year, I cannot cook pork so that it is tender.  I follwed directions and used a meat thermometer.

This came out really moist and with great flavor from the Cinammon applesauce.  If you're worried about the cinammon being overpowering you don't have to because it wasn't.

Would have been great if my glaze wouldn't have burned due to the cook time at 350 degrees being 2 hours instead of 1 hour.  I didn't have an oven bag so I used a roast pan and improvised with flour coating.  I mixed ginger, salt and pepper in with the flour, dusted the roast and browned it in olive oil.  Followed the glaze recipe exactly except doubled it.  Glaze was very good(besides the burnt parts)and roast stayed moist.  Wish I could try this again but the family is going vegan next week for health reasons.

The only thing I recomend to make this recipe better is go easy on the ginger.  It is a wonderfully juice roast that is the result.  I just made it and everyone was raving about it.  Even my garbage gut that will eat anything and not comment was very excited about how good it tasted!

My family LOVED this.  We enjoy variations in our food from hot, spicy, sweet, savory, ect.  This met the "somewhat sweet" need.  Did not have ground ginger on hand, so I used crystalized, sugared ginger.  I mashed the crystalized ginger and mixed it well with the other ingredients.  Cooked 1 hour for a one-lb pork loin, could have cooked it for about 50 minutes.  
My husband and 7 year old, picky eater, son both "WOWED" the pork loin and gave it a "high 5".  It came out very juicy, not too sweet, maybe because of the ginger I used, don't know.  We will be making renditions of this recipes for years to come!  Thank you for this recipe!

This turned out pretty good. I didn't eat much due to not feeling well but everyone else enjoyed it. It made the house smell good, LOL.

Followed the recipe exactly,but after 45 minutes, the applesauce/brown sugar mixture had burned and stuck to the cooking bag. Had to finish the roast off in the microwave. However, it was juicy, but not alot of "sweet" flavor as I had expected.  Will try again using my slow cooker.

This was easy to make.  I didn't pay attention to the size of my roast though, and ended up almost doubling the cooking time.  Everyone liked the taste very much.  Left out the ginger because I didn't have it.

This roast turned out great.  My husband really enjoyed it and we actually finished the roast by making sandwiches out of the leftovers.  We have never finished a pork roast before.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I wasn't a fan of the sweet taste - I added a significant amount of salt and garlic to season it a bit, and afterwards it was more to my liking.

I thought this was a very good, easy recipe.  I normally don't care to cook pork loin as my past attempts ended up rather dry and tasteless but this was very juicy and delicious with rice.  I did add a bit of garlic, pepper, and salt to it and it was great!

Everyone in the family loved this recipe. It was tender and quite flavorful. I modified it slightly by seasoning it with a little salt and pepper and pan searing the tenderloin briefly on each side. We will definitely make this one again soon.

This was awesome!  I added white wine and more water to the sauce and reduced it to gravy after it came out of the oven and served over rice.  It took less than an hour to cook--I used a probe thermometer in the boneless pork roast so I wouldn't overcook it.

Easy recipe, but I also found the roast a little bland although I used additonal seasoning.  I may try searing it first when I try it again. My family enjoyed it,so this recipe is a keeper.

I used aluminum foil too, and it worked great. This is a very easy and good tasting way to roast pork. It really becomes infused with the ginger and cinnamon flavor which was a nice change.

Easy, delicious and virtually no clean up.  Following other reviewers suggestions, I doubled the sauce and cooked it in aluminum foil which worked out fine.  As others said, this is not incredibly sweet - the ginger and cinnamon flavors take away from the sweetness.  It went great with sweet potatoes and "Hot Corn" from this site.  Not an ounce of anything was left over!  This is a keeper.

This one went over big at my house so I will definitely make it again.  I didn't have cinnamon applesauce so I used regular and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also added a pinch of salt.  We ate it with rice pilaf and green beans.  The meat was slightly sweet and went great with the pilaf.  I found that one hour wasn't enough cooking time.  I cooked mine for another 20-30 minutes.

EXCELLENT AND EASY!  I added a little garlic powder to the sauce and it was wonderful! I used a smaller roast, but made the same amount of sauce so we had lots to pour over the meat. Highly recommended! Will make this one over and over again!

Simply the best I've ever had.  I didn't change a thing.  My family raved for days about this one!

This was so easy and delicious.  We served this Christmas Day and had plenty of time to enjoy the holiday.  Very flavorful and tender!
