An extremely versatile recipe so in the "spirit" of Halloween I cut the carrots into the shape of pumpkins.

How can you go wrong with this?!  I especially like the notes with the alternate suggestions  - green onion, cucumber, radishes... there are loads of possibilities.  Imagine a tray of these little guys served out by the pool.  YUM!
