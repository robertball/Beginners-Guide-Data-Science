I noticed the people giving this a low rating were disappointed because it was not hot and spicy. It's not supposed to be folks, it's garlic wings, not hot wings.
Now that that is out of the way.
These are some of the best wings I have EVER had. I took a bag of flash frozen wings and cooked them at 400-425 for 35 minutes. Removed the wings and brushed them with the sauce. Returned them to the oven for 10 more minutes, took them out and tossed them in the sauce and plated them. FREAKIN AWESOME! Do it, do it now!

To start, I first found this recipe on another food site several years ago, and I have used the recipe ever since. With that said, the original recipe was edited to adjust the amount of butter from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup, and included the amount of chicken pieces (wings) to use. The recipe here as written is bland and is a rating of 3 at best.  The edited version however is a 4 or 5.  My suggestion is to make as written if you like it bland or double the amount of seasonings if you prefer the amount of butter stated. If you opt to use 1/4 cup of butter use the amount of seasoning as written.  We love garlic so I tend to add pressed garlic into the mixture as the butter melts along with the rest of the seasonings.  I also find it important to mention that "salt" is a preference, but can be adjusted to taste. The seasoning is there but is lacking with the amount of butter stated.

We added Goya Adobo (1/4 tsp), Italian seasoning (1/2 tsp), and garlic sea salt (1/4 tsp) to the original recipe. We will NEVER go out for wings again!

Delicious used garlic salt instead of onion and added blue cheese dressing to it and it was amazing just like Pizza Huts sauce.

After making it as written, I kicked up the wing sauce with 1/4 tsp of Cayenne Pepper (and a bit more to taste). My boys asked for more Parmesan, so I added another 1/4 C. Placed the wings on a bowl and poured the sauce over the whole batch. Voila!!! Amazeballs!!

This was very good for my kid who likes garlic, but otherwise is shy about strong flavors.  I used the technique for wing-baking from the Chef John recipe "Crispy Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings" and utilized this sauce instead for a picky ten year old, who was very happy.  (If you haven't tried oven-baking wings with this method, TRY it, you'll be amazed).

I felt it was too bland and no where near as good as the wings I usually make which tend to be on the spicy side.  I don't think I'd make this again.  The wings came out ok at best.

So these are not spicy at all. They're not supposed to be. I modified the recipe and used onion powder instead of salt. It's perfect and fantastic if you have someone in your home with a sodium restricted diet. That's why we make our own sauces. I took frozen wings and put them in the crockpot on high for 4 hours. I mixed this up and dipped and plated them. They were perfect. The kids keep requesting them. I started making the sauce for garlic bread and pasta too.

They were good but no kick. I'm not a fan of hot food but if it's supposed to be spicy it should be.  I achieved this by adding a 1/4 cup of Franks hot wing sauce. This was the missing ingredient!

Everyone loved it.  I did not have onion salt so I used onion powder and a little salt..which I did not really measure.  Could have used a little less or will get onion salt before I make it again.

This sauce turned out great, and I would definitely make this again! Although, it can tend to resemble parmesan cheese drenched in a bowl of butter. To counteract this, I'd reduce the cheese and up the amount of butter and garlic.

I made half the recipe and used 3 tbl. of butter. It was a little pasty, but was great. Coated the wings well. Also added some hot wing sauce after to make spicy garlic parmesan sauce.

This tastes A LOT like wing sauce from any wing place.  It is really delicious. My husband who is strictly hot wings even liked it. You can tweak the recipe to your liking.   We fried chicken wings in our deep fryer and then tossed them in the sauce.   Delish!

We all  loved the recipe. I made it for 25 wings and it was more than enough. One person said to add extra salt which I did however it was a little too salty.  I definitely will make it again

This was wonderful! We recently discovered garlic Parmesan wings from Little Caesars, and I was happy to find this recipe. I will be making my own more often!

These came out wonderful. I made them following the recipe and adding fresh garlic, chopped basil, and Italian parsley. Instead of baking I BBQd them on sprayed foil on low heat. Amazing!

This sauce is amazing. For those saying it isn’t spicy, nothing on the ingredients list would suggest it would be and the recipe isn’t meant to be spicy. The one thing I wasn’t sure how about was portion size and how many wings they would work for. I had about 2 pounds of chicken wings and it was about the perfect amount of sauce. For some additional flavor you could add in Italian seasoning or other herbs but it’s great on its own. I baked some chicken wings and tossed them in a bowl with this sauce. My husband said it is one of his favorite dishes, I will definitely be making it again and again.

Everyone is commenting about them not being spicy - its garlic Parmesan wings!  Not hot and spicy wings.  The only thing I would change is not using just garlic powder but using fresh or at least jarred garlic..

I don’t do this the way it says at all. I got Lawrys garlic and herb marinade and added Parmesan and pepper. It looked and tasted EXACTLY like BDUBS wings!

I switched out the shredded/grated Parmesan for the powdered stuff. It blended in better for a more uniform coating. Both ways tasted wonderful!

This is an AWESOME garlic parm wing sauce!!! I added 1 tablespoon of garlic and 1/2 tbsp of onion because we like extra flavor. I especially liked how the sauce was thicker.

I did add some hot sauce and parsley to the recipe.
Kids loved it. Made on a mesh tray so butter could drip to bottom and wings stayed crisp. Broiled the last few minutes to crisp.

I loved this simple recipe.  The best sauce I have ever had for a non-hot sauce.  Delish!!! I didn't see any instructions for it but I bake my wings to the desired crispness and then add the sauce without the parmesan, mix them good in the butter sauce and then mix on the parmesan.  YUM.

Ok, but not really a sauce. More like cheese swimming in butter. Warm up the mix, add some whipping cream, and whisk to get the cheese and butter to combine. Then you will have a great sauce to coat your wings :)

Not sure why some people complain that this recipe is not spicy. If you review the ingredients, you should know it’s not meant to be. That’s why my family and I love it! I make it as is. Doesn’t need a change for us and we’ve made it at least 10 times.

This is super easy to make and flavorful. It's a great base recipe and perfect for those who like wings but don't like hot. I've used this recipe a few times now and I've added fresh oregano and basil to give it a little Italian kick, I've added some feta for a more Mediterranean flavor. This is a great starting point, take it make it your own.

Didn't make any changes, but wings cooked in far less time than noted, and almost were overcooked.  When wings came out they looked dry and caked with the dry rub.  I probably won't make them again,

I never follow a recipe, but I did this one, Not as good as I thought it would be, I would pour the butter mixture over the parm, next time, use real garlic also.  It is a good base starter to make your own sauce, Thanks for sharing.

Made this for my family, adults and grandkids and we all loved them.  I made my chicken wings in the oven at 450° for about an hour and they were nice and crispy, next i mopped the garlic parmesea sauce over each and back in the oven for 5 minutes to set.  Absolutely delicious, this is now a family favorite!

This was a pretty simple and good recipe.  I used fresh garlic and real onions.  I sweated the onions and garlic first.  I have made a spicy version of this as well adding Franks Red Hot  sauce, and cayenne.  Very simple and easy to make.

I added 2 tsp fresh chopped garlic.  I also used 2 tbsp butter and 1/4 cup coconut oil instead of 1/2 cup butter.   I didn't expect it to be spicy,  and it was delicious!  I coated some baked chicken wingettes, then tossed the remaining sauce with spaghetti squash.  Again,  delicious.  Making it again tomorrow for the family.

I thought this was delicious.  I don't like to rate a recipe where I changed ingredients but I didn't have onion salt on hand.  I added the 1/2 tsp of just salt and added 1/4 tsp of onion powder.  I'll be finding other ways to use this in my cooking.

this was a good base to steer me in the right direction.. i added an extra 1/4 cup parm (i used garlic parm for the addition) and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.. used onion powder for the onion salt and added an extra 1/4 tsp.. doubled the black pepper.. added a heaping 1/4 tsp of salt and dried basil.. i think it would have been lacking/bland without these modifications.. but ty for the beginning of a good recipe
