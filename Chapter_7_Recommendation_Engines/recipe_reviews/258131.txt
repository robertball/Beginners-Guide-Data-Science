These are easy and tasty. I used salted butter and kept the salt in and I am glad I did.. these are very sweet. Next time I think I'll cut back on the caramel to see if I can tone it down a bit.  Kids would love these..

This is such an awesome recipe, everyone in my family loved it! It was easy and satisfied the needs of my caramel-nut-chocolate loving family. One suggestion I have who anyone who really loves chocolate is to add fudge frosting to the top. It adds a great extra chocolate flavor, without taking away from the original flavors.
