Excellent recipe!!! I used whole wheat pastry flour.  Only had 2 bananas so I added a little fresh pinapple,  omitted the wheat germ because I didn't have any and added a half a cup white flour.  I also added a few handfuls of fresh cranberries.  The maple syrup added just enough sweetness .  Thanks for the great  recipe !

So, I hate when people make a recipe and say it was perfect but I changed this and that. You need to make the recipe as is first. Well, as I was mixing the ingredients I found I did not have everything I needed. Such as only 2 eggs, no wheat germ or coconut oil. So I increased the flax seed to 1/2 cup to make up for the egg (flax can be used as an egg sub) and wheat germ and used veg oil instead. They came out amazing. Light and moist. This is definitely going into the recipe book.

Converted to GF replacing whole wheat flour with all purpose gluten free blend and added 3/4 tsp xanthum gum. Then replaced wheat germ with half and half unsweetened coconut and hemp hearts. Delicious!

I just loved this recipe.  I made a few small changes.  I added 1/2 C white flour, upped the pecans to 1/2 C and used 1 C of fresh chopped cranberries in place of the dried cranberries.  The muffins were still plenty sweet. I got a dozen regular muffins and 3 dozen minis. I always fill my tins a little scant to avoid overflow.  It also helps with the calorie count :)

I've made these 3 times now.  I used frozen cranberries (a whole cup).  I used light spelt flour, and omitted the wheat germ (I don't have any!) They are fantastic!

I will start with this caveat, I didn’t have a wheat germ or flaxseed. But as per other reviewer‘s, I thought it would be OK without them. I checked them right at 25 minutes, the tops were burnt and totally flat. They did not raise at all. They are definitely hearty, but I would say there’s way too much maple syrup, I wish the recipe had something with more nutritional value like applesauce to add sweetness.? I will try them again with wheat germ and flax next time, but I’m not super hopeful.

Nice tasting and moist! I added half the amount of dried cranberries and the other half raisins to give more sweetness to them. I also added 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed to bump up fiber and add a little protein. I also doubled the amount of nuts. I will make these often! Maybe add a few chocolate chips next time! :)

These are delicious muffins! I added an extra tablespoon of whole flaxseeds for texture as well as some fresh blueberries and used fresh-frozen cranberries?? sliced in half instead of dried cranberries?.? I also used avocado oil instead of ?wheat germ.I saw in another review I sprinkled pumpkin seeds on top. Definitely the best homemade muffin I’ve made!??

I make these muffins for my 5 year old son’s afternoon snack at school. He loves them!  I omit the cranberries and nuts.  You have to be careful that the coconut oil is incorporated.  Really easy recipe and a filling, healthy snack!

These are growing on me. They are very tasty but may not be your cup of tea if you are craving a sweet muffin. I did use a cup of fresh cranberries and two handfuls of dried cranberries, so the fresh cranberries added tartness. I also used a cup of pecans. Still, it is a very yummy recipe and I will definitely make them again.

I didn’t have coconut oil so I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil instead, one thing I suggest doing with these is adding at least one egg. It makes them softer and less dry

Very light and fluffy.  I think it's missing something though, and maybe it's the cinnamon or maybe fresh blueberries.  Maybe next time.  I added 1 cup quinoa flour, 1/4 cup + 2 tblspns  ground flaxseed, added 1/4 cup ghee instead of coconut oil,  added 4 bananas  2-really ripe 2 ripe, and 1 cup cranberries, 1 cup walnuts and 1/4 cup cranberry, cherry and raisin mix and no cinnamon as it's summer.

I did not have whole wheat flour or wheat germ on hand, so I used regular all purpose flour  and 1 cup  ( very) finely chopped walnuts as supstitutes.  They turned out great!  Delicious!  I love that they are sweetened with maple syrup!

Would definitely make this again! I had a lot of fun with this recipe. I feel like a lot of the ingredients are mere suggestions and can be substituted for anything similar in your pantry. I made them with half flax and half chia seeds, and I used raisins instead of cranberries because I ran out. Rather than the wheat germ I used  very finely chopped trail mix nuts. Lastly, I sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar on the top after filling the muffin tray to add a bit of crunch to the first bite. I hope this helps!

I was so excited to make these that I cut the recipe in thirds because I only had 1 ripe banana.

They turned out amazing. 

TEENY TINY CHANGES:
I had to omit the cranberries and pecans because I was making them mostly for my  2 year old. I didnt have wheat germ so I used hemp seeds LOL My 2 year old gobbled them up. I added chocolate chips to the last muffin as a treat. 

These are a keeper. Moist and not too banana-y. Can't wait make them again with pecans but I think the cranberries might make them too sweet (the sweetness was just right!).

Oh wow! This was just what I was looking for. Hearty, healthy wheat and oat muffins with bananas, not altogether too sweet. I didn't have maple syrup, but subbed honey. I also prefer blueberries over cranberries, so I subbed that too. It was great and would have been just as good with the original. Loved it and so did my 1 and 2 year olds!

I read a bunch of reviews and decided I needed to make these muffins today. Might possibly be the best tasting muffin I've ever eaten in my entire life! I made them using the recipe as stated with very few modifications. Didn't have any flax seed so I added 1/2 cup flaked coconut. My husband is allergic to pecans so I added 1.2 cup miniature chocolate chips which he LOVES. My dried cranberries were really dry, so I poured hot water over them in a cup and let them sit for about 15 minutes, then drained them well before adding to the recipe. I was able to make 21 muffins from this recipe. I was most impressed at how they didn't stick to the muffin tin. The texture is amazing! I read somewhere that to keep muffins from getting soggy when stored in a closed container you need to place a paper towel under and over the muffins in your plasticware container.

The only changes I made was to sub all the oil for applesauce (about 1/2 cup - I put in one of those unsweetened preportioned snack sizes) and use 1/2 cup of dried cranberries and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts (since I don't usually have pecans). I am so impressed with this healthy banana muffin recipe that it is my new favourite for overripe bananas. Delicious!

Very tasty and healthy, the sweetness was perfect with the maple syrup.  I used 2tsp of cinnamon instead of 1Tbsp, 1Tbsp seemed like a lot.  They are great for breakfast as they are fulfilling, you don’t get hungry in 20min like you do with commercial products.  I have already made them twice, super!

Super Easy Recipe.  Just dump all the ingredients (except dried cranberries and nuts) into a bowl , mix well, add berries and nuts, fill cupcake pan and bake.  Mine were cooked a few minutes before the time stated, so check early to avoid dryness.  I did not change anything and will make again and again.

Super filling and good for you too! I didn't have coconut oil, so I used canola oil. I also tossed in an extra banana. Will be making these again.

Great recipe! Very moist considering the healthy ingredients. i found whole wheat muffins typically turn out heavy and dry but these weren't at all. made a double batch and glad i did!
Changed the add ins to suit our taste. 1 cup fresh cranberries and pecans in 1 batch,  chocolate chips in the other. also added a little shredded coconut. will be making again!

These are wonderful!  I used dried cherries because I had them and added golden raisins.  Yum!  They are so moist and full of flavor!

Made my first batch today.  These are wonderful.  I was expecting a repairman to check out my oven so I waited for him to arrive prior to baking them.  Why heat up the oven twice.  He stated, "Wow, those smell good" so many times I offered him one, which he quickly accepted.  Definitely a five star

Good, moist and filling. I added shredded coconut and used fresh cranberries.  I used the mini muffin tin and made 28 overflowing minis.

I made exactly how it was but used frozen cranberries.  It had a nice flavor and was good to know it was nutritious.

Loved these! My kids love them too, some of them prefer them with no nuts. I used whole flax seeds instead cuz I didn't have ground, white flour instead of whole wheat. Delicious! Saving this one for sure :)

I reduced the saturated fat content of this recipe a lot by substituting extra virgin olive oil for coconut oil. I found it did not significantly affect the texture of the muffins - they were still soft and fluffy. I also substituted honey for the maple syrup because I think it is a little bit sweeter, so I was able to cut the sugar content in half. They turned out absolutely guilt free and delicious!

Best healthy muffin I have ever made!  So tasty. I didn't have flax seeds, so substituted about 1/8 cup of chia seeds instead.  I also used an extra 1/2 cup of oats as I didn't have wheat germ.

These were very good and not too sweet.  I did change two things.  I added an extra 1/4 c. of flour and flax meal each to make up for the 1/2 c. wheat germ I didn't have.  I also cut the  maple syrup down from 1/2 c. to 1/4 c. and added 1/4 c. xylitol.  I will definitely make these again.

The flavour in these muffins are great, I just found the appearance to be a little off. They were totally flat and I'm used to muffins having a round top.
