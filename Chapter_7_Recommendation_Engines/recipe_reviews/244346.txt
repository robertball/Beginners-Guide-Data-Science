I had everything on hand so that is why I decided to try this recipe plus something new. We loved it!!! My chops were 3/4 inch thick and I only cooked them for 3 minutes on high for each side and then 1 minute per side with the glaze. I checked to see what the temp was inside and they were perfect. Very juicy and the flavor was excellent! Thanks for sharing. I will do these again and not change anything.

Really great pork chop recipe. I hate fennel so I substituted coriander instead. So flavorful. I served it with spaghetti tossed in garlic butter. Not as complicated as I first thought. I only had time to marinate for 2 hours and it was still great. Will make again soon.

We loved this my husband said he would give it 100 stars if he could and I was impressed I made something so delicious!!! I'd admit I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out but I'm so glad I made it!!!

Here's what I did different --  I  cubed my pork instead of leaving it whole and then I mixed everything up  including the syrup and let it chill then took it out breaded it and cooked it I served it over noodles and it taste like Chinese food :) 100 stars trust me!!!

I didn't have time to marinade it, but was delicious.  Can't wait to try it when I have the time to do so.  Only thing different is I used ground coriander instead of fennel.  You won't be disappointed!

This from the hubby who dislikes the "other white meat", to "this is outstanding"!  As with most ingredients, they are always better when they have had a chance to "marry", so with that being said, I put the dry rub on 1.5 days ahead and made the glaze the morning I planned to cook these allowing the spices on the chop and in the glaze to come to full flavor!  As I silently cleaned the kitchen after dinner concluded, I had to agree with him.  These were outstanding!  Thanks for sharing the recipe WestCoastMom!

Best pork chop ever. Couldn't believe the compliments. So over the top I thought my guests were being sarcastic. Did make some changes tho. Brined in 2 gallons of water with one quarter cup of kosher salt and sugar for four hours. Doubled everything else in the recipe.Patted chop dry and scored. Rubbed in doubled spice mix, put in gallon freezer bag and in fridge over night. Next day dredged in flour, egg wash and bread crumbs. Put half inch of oil in fry pan and fried in oil 2 mins a side just to brown and than on rack on sheet pan to bake as my pork chops were almost 1 and half inch thick COSTCO. When all chops were browned I poured half the doubled sauce mix on top.Baked in 325 oven for 30 mins. served rest of warmed sauce with finished product. be prepared for the accolades.

Loved the taste!  Carmelized goodness.  Yummy.
Followed some of the comments and increased the spices by half, and added a touch more oil to the pan.  Medium-hot seemed too hot, as breading on pork became dark, almost burnt looking,  but after cooking further in the maple-mustard glaze, the taste was glorious!  Husband went after that piece of pork in no time flat!  Will definitely make it many more times.

Fabulous! I didn't have time to marinate but everyone loved them anyway. I can't wait to make this again, this time giving ample opportunity to marinate. I served the chops with with roasted potatoes and a green salad with apple chunks.

FABULOUS!!! I basted them with the glaze and baked them in the oven after browning them in the pan (instead of glazing them in the pan, also). Oh, and I didn't have fennel. They were DELICIOUS. Thank you :)

Great Recipe! I'm still a beginner home cook. So, I look for recipes that I think I can pull off, but more exciting that my standard baked chicken and pan seared pork. My wife is the judge of my food. She has only three criteria. It needs to look delicious, have lots of flavor without being too salty, and most of all taste great. This dish nailed all of those areas. We will definitely use this again. My wife mentioned it might be great with chicken as well. So, I might adjust the recipe for boneless chicken breasts next.

I've made this a few times as is. The only thing I do different is: I don't marinate the chops in the rub.  I make it all at once and it is still delicious!

My whole family loved this! Only made a few minor changes - didn't let pork chops sit 4-6 hrs (didn't have time) so just used it as a regular rub.  Also I didn't use fennel cause we don't like it.  Used Italian panko breadcrumbs too.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious! The glaze is the best part of this recipe...everyone loved it! I didn't have fennel so I used dill instead. I was using wafer thin pork loin chops, so step 7 was unnecessary because the meat was already cooked through by the time I finished the glazing step. So good! A keeper.

Followed the recipe as listed. The flavors combined so well that this recipe is a keeper. Remember to use real maple syrup as that makes the dish so flavorful. Will make this again.

Enjoyable meld of tastes! 

I made this once before (a long time ago) and it didn’t resonate with me *but* it turned out great this time.  Thinking back on what made it better this time, I think I know why I wasn’t thrilled then.  Here are my lessons learned: 

1.  Use the fennel!! That tiny hint of flavor is what made all the difference to my taste buds.  I’m no fan of too much fennel but this is a tiny amount and it does NOT taste like licorice. It’s taste is more earthy/savory.
2.  I think these chops do far better with fewer bread crumbs pressed into them. Previously I’d tried to make them too breaded. Just a light flip flop in the crumbs works well, buffers the chops from direct heat, and doesn’t interfere with your meat.
3.  Take it easy on the heat. If you must cook on an electric stove where it’s hard to control heat, use a lower setting and cook longer.  If you don’t, the glaze can caramelize when exposed to too much high heat from the burner.

YUM!!!  I took it over to my dad's for Fathers day and it was a HUGE hit.  The only thing I left out was the fennel seeds as I am not a fan, but next time i'm going to add them. I bought syrup specifically for this recipe and it was Totally worth it. (though the stores I went to did not carry grade b so i got a very dark grade a). Also,  I mixed the glaze up at the same time as the dry rub and let the flavors meld... Fantastically delicious and my new go to pork chop recipe!!

I am usually not a fan of pork chops and was a little concerned about the syrup (I didn't think it would go well with meat) BUT it turned out good. My kids asked me to make it again. I didn't add any mustard because I didn't have any but I don't think I want to change the way I made them. They were good!

This was delicious but because I don't eat foods that are high in FODMAPS, I left out the garlic and onion powders, and swapped the breadcrumbs for Gluten Free Panko breadcrumbs.  I also switched the fennel for Coriander.  It was so yummy!  The flavors are rich and deep.  The family loved it and I will be making it again!  Thanks and great job creating this recipe.

Followed recipe. Cooked up nice and juicy. Makes a great presentation. I will reduce/leave out the fennel next time. Just a tad overpowering.

Followed recipe exactly -  it gave the pork kind of a maple-y, teriyaki taste, quite sweet and just not much to my liking.

I substituted gluten free bread crumbs - which are less than ideal - and the spice rub lead time.  But great flavor anyway.

Thank you for the great idea! I did make two changes. Instead of pork chops, I used a pork loin roast and used honey in place of the maple syrup for the glaze. It turned out awesome.

This is delicious! My 3 kids love it! Pork doesn't dry out. Just need to adjust cooking temp/time depending on thickness of pork. These are on my rotation!

Made this dish the other night for my family.  Both my teenagers are picky eaters in totally different ways. They both loved this dish. It was a hit with the whole family.  I only left out the cayenne and the fennel as I did not think they would like the spiciness or the fennel flavor. I have also enjoyed it for leftovers and it was still moist.

My husband loves these pork chops, which says a lot because he rarely eats pork.  They were delicious and fun to make.  Thanks for the recipe!  I added curry and turmeric to the seasonings, which is what I do for most recipes I try.  That was the only modification I made.

This is hands down my family’s favorite chicken recipe!  The only change I made was once or twice I have marinated it for 48 hours—and that only because of last minute dinner plans that interrupted cooking that night.  

Definitely an A+ recipe!

Great recipe for juicy pork loin chops!   I didn't have caraway seeds, so used some ground coriander in its place.  Also didn't have the time to marinate more than an hour.  The chops were excellent!  Served with a baked potato and  buttered carrots with dill.  I will definitely be fixing these chops again.

It was really good! I gave it 4 stars only because there were so many ingredients. I did use a few different ingredients because I used what I had on-hand. Those were: molasses vs maple syrup, Dijon mustard, red pepper and Italian bread crumbs.

A while back I made Chef John's Smothered Pork Chops. Never thought I would find another chop recipe that my family and I would like as much.  Until I tried this one.  My wife and daughter love these Loin Chops so much that when I suggested adding peach jam to the glaze they both responded with an emphatic NO! So I keep them just as the recipe is written and the only complaint I ever hear is that I don't make them often enough.
Describe them in one word? Easy. Phantasmagorical!

I've bee wanting to make this for quite awhile but held off on not wanting to buy a jar of 2 or 3 spices for 1/4 tsp - 1/2 tsp. Plus I don't like mustard.But the picture looked too yummy. a lady in my church told me of a spice store where i can buy as little as an ounce so I decided to give it a try.

A little more challenging then this non kitchen guy would prefer, but it was worth it!!!

The taste of mustard was just enough to let you know it was there, but it was not over powering. The maple syrup added a great flavor.

Overall it rates well enough to be added to my 'Do it again collectoin'

I had 1.5 inch chop with bone so I pan fried 5 min a side and then covered and cooked on low for approx 20 min
I only let rest in fridge for half hour
Added two more tbsp of maple syrup
Very favorable....definitely make again

For all the fussing it took to make this I'm not sure I would make it again.  They were good but I thought they would be better,  The instructions were silly like using 2 different kinds of oil in the pan.

I’ve made this several times and I use pork tenderloin and slice it about 1 inch thick. My wife doesn’t like fennel so I omit that but I have tried coriander and that works. This is a great recipe as written. Simple and good

My husband and I really liked this. I did not have fennel seeds so I read you could use cumin so I did. Followed the recipe and it turned out great!! One suggestion i have is to watch meat timing closely. I think I cooked mine a minute or two too long, but it was still very moist and juicy!!

This dish was absolutely delicious. I made it exactly as written as this is fair in order to give a dish a fair rating based on how it was supposed to be made. It offered up something different for a change and the ingredient which made it so tasty was the maple syrup. As the possible suggestions noted, we did it on the BBQ. Lovely. Thank you.

This was very good. I had to make a few changes though. My chops had to marinate overnight because I was called away for an emergency. I didn't have maple syrup so I used some honey instead.  The next time I make these I will trim off the fat and will use maple syrup.

These chops are a keeper! They are fast, easy, and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly aside from leaving half of the chops unbreaded. Next time I'll skip the bread crumbs entirely and also add less salt to the rub.

I made this several times and it's one of my favourite recipes for cooking porkchops.  I love the maple syrph taste in them.   I have to be careful cooking them as it's easy to burn them.

I was very enthusiastic about this recipe and while it was good, it wasn't as good as I had hoped or expected.   I liked the entire process.   The texture and technique were excellent, but I found it lacking in flavor.   I don't really know what I'd change because I think the recipe is solid.

Made this for my husbands dinner.  Loved the aroma of the garlic and the combination of spices.  I left out the fennel seed as I am not a fan.  I found that 2 tablespoons of oil isn't enough to get the chops cooked.  I suggest 1 1/2 tablespoons of each.  Otherwise a very tasty recipe.

Followed the recipe to a tee. Way too salty for us. Cooked on low heat but they stuck to the pan anyway and most of the coating stayed in the frying pan. May work for others but I won't make this again.

Super yummy!  Better than I was expecting.  The kids even ate a little bit of it too.  I did substitute yellow mustard for the dijon, because I don't like dijon.  Great flavor.  Hubby said he things the dijon would have added something extra for sure.

Very good. Next time I will use the brown mustard since all I had was Dijon. My individual taste calls for a little more garlic and cayenne. Marinate at least 8 hours. I served it with baked sweet potatoes and a green steamed vegetable.

I made a few changes.   Instead of Fennel I used a rosemary blend and when I put on bread crumbs I used panko and coated twice with an egg wash in between  It was the best port chop I have had in a long time.  I will make it again.

Best Pork Chops I have ever made!  I've never been a fan but this recipe changes things.   We have a pretty famous restaurant in SW Kentucky that Pork Chops are their trademark dish, I enjoyed these much more!  Try them??

I followed the recipe using the rub and found it seemed to be missing something.  The second time I used Hop Baron's  Bad  BBQ Rub which I purchased on Etsy and had tried on other meats.   It was absolutely delicious.

I am somewhat shocked at how easy this was and how great it turned out! I got 3 about 1/2 inch bone in chops (they seemed skinny to me tho and totaled about 1.12 lbs) and followed directions - except no fennel and did not marinade more than 30 minutes on the cutting board but was plenty of time. We used a maple syrup I literally just got in the mail which has a bit of whisky in it. Yes please even better. I halved the recipe and made half the sauce. As some have mentioned I should've kept sauce proportion same because I ran out. Half the slices was fine though...it was delicious! Husband loved it. Served with roasted brussel sprouts, unsweetened applesauce (didn't need it) and mashed sweet potatoes. Amaze.

I was intrigued by this recipe, so I had to try it. The glaze ends up just a bit sweet; next time I will reduce the maple syrup. I liked the bread crumb, added a nice crunch. Next time I will try panko for even more crunch. The rub at the beginning made a wonderful base for all the flavors. I will have to go and get a jar of ground fennel since I had to borrow from a neighbor. Thanks for a very nice recipe.

OMG  excellent recipe!!  I didn't have onion powder, canola oil or fennel seeds so I omitted the fennel and onion powder and used vegetable oil in place of canola.  I also used panko seasoned crumbs.  My chops were about 1" thick so I cooked a little longer and checked internal temperature til they were done.   It was sooo good.  Will definitely  make  again & again.

The recipe was pretty easy to make.  I didn't anticipate, however, having to marinate in the spices for a length of time, however.  The family really enjoyed them and the flavors were amazing!  Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated, and thought it was REALLY good, but my husband did not like it at all; that was not the recipe's fault.  I had unknowingly purchased a "treated" pork loin, and even tho it said "Original Flavor," it really wasn't.  My husband is very sensitive to "chemical flavors," which I usually cannot detect.  Anyway, I thought this recipe was delicious, and next time will make it with an untreated pork loin!  And there WILL be a next time!  YUM!

I made it with boneless chicken breasts. I marinated it for a day and a half, and I did not use the breadcrumbs - just added the maple syrup and mustard glaze while cooking  it. It was a huge success and will be a regular recipe in the house.

These were so tender and yummy! I didn't have  fennel so used same amount of tarragon. I left out the cayenne pepper as we are not fans of hot foods and also, I didn't have any spicy brown mustard, so went with Octoberfest mustard. 
This dish was a hit! My daughter who is normally not a fan of pork chops actually went back for seconds. And my son cleaned up his meat but not his potatoes...it's usually the other way around. He loves potatoes! 
I never knew pork chops could be so tender! Will definitely be making this again.

Liked these pork chops because they were quick and easy....of course it required some hours in the refrigerator before cooking.   Didn't change anything and I actually didn't overlook these chops like I usually do

No changes, except for cutting the amount of salt in half. Tasty pork chops. Thanks for sharing.

Too salty for us but I love the Panco breadcrumbs and putting it on the grill. I used nonstick foil and sprayed the chops with Misto olive oil sprayer. They were beautiful and juicy. Next time, no salt.

I have used this for two dinners this week. First one was for pork chops and tonight for pork ribs. My husband laughed and said BBQ ribs are supposed to be red! But because we had already tried this wonderful rub and glaze, he knew they would be good. I served them with a side salad and scalloped potatoes. I almost forgot to mention, I used sugar free syrup and it was delicious!!! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!

Made these for supper last night.  Very good.  Not sure I liked the brown sugar, but then I was using dark brown sugar.  Next time I will use golden brown, white  or  the maple sugar, I have .

I didn't have fennel and substituted Dijon mustard because I didn't have spicy brown mustard, and it still turned out good. I've cooked it twice now, and am not disappointed.

This recipe is excellent... I buy 1/2 inch center cut pork chops and pound them slightly thinner... I follow the recipe exactly except I don't cover them at the end for 5 minutes.... and they're cooked perfectly... just  a tinge of pink in the center.  I also use Chipotle pepper in lieu of Cayenne... Thank you for submitting.

Followed the recipe exactly except instead of canola oil I used olive oil since it was what we had. I was a little skeptical that these would come out good with fennel ( found the spice at Earthfare) that smells like licorice and it's very strong odor ( I hate licorice) and maple syrup and how do these go together. However, when cooked with all the other spices this was REALLY great! I couldn't taste any licorice just a really nice blend of spices.  Will be making again.

I won boneless pork loins chops at a meat raffle.  I found this recipe.  I only had plain syrup and didn't get to let them marinate for more than an hour but they were delicious.  I would definitely make them again!

First: I had to make adjustments!  It didn't completely  change the recipe, however, so I am comfortable reviewing.  I did not have fennel and so I left it out. I'm sure it would only have added more wonderful flavor to an already delicious concoction!  Also, rather than doing these completely on the stove top, I browned then on the stove and finished off in the oven at 375 for....well until they were done. 15 minutes maybe?   

I highly recommend this recipe!  It's easy (don't let the list of ingredients deter you!), flexible, and the taste is wonderful!

Amazing, came out just like the picture.  The sauce was great.  I doubled up on the spices and needed to add more oil while cooking but otherwise kept to the recipe exactly.  Finally pork my kids will eat!

I made this last weekend and they were such a hit that I'm making them again this weekend. even my pickiest eater keep raving over them. I love the contrast between the Sweet Maple and leave semi-permanent mustard. these are definitely going but the top of my list of favorite ways to make pork chops. thanks for the recipe.

Overall good recipe.  I upped the mustard, lessened the maple syrup and doubled the spices to cut the sweetness.  Next time I will add a little onion salt as well.  .Sauce should be doubled, as it wan't quite enough.

My 16 year old son made this and flew into the living room saying, "You have got to try this; it is THE BEST pork chops I have ever eaten in my life! Mom, you will stop being vegetarian after eating this. It will change you." He got me to try a piece and I have to admit, it was pretty good. I've never liked meat, but I can say this is probably the best meat I've ever tried. Family and friends that were over thought it was great too.

These pork chops were delicious!  My 25-year-old son has never liked any pork chops I made, but loved these.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but wanted to serve them with zucchini.  I sliced the zucchini and sautéed them in the pan drippings after removing the pork chops.  Add angel hair pasta, and you've got a delicious meal.  So good, I'll save this recipe and make it again and again!

I found this pork chop recipe in a pinch for something different. I didnt have the allotted time, so I just used some of the rub ingredients and coated the chops with plain bread crumbs. I followed the glaze recipe pretty close minus the cayenne, and substituted Dijon for the spicy brown mustard (didnt have any). I was also unable to do the garlic cooked in oil. It still came out well and was tasty. Ill make more time next time I cook it, and compare the flavors.

I left my prepared pork chops sit in the fridge until next afternoon.  The fanel seeds do work well with the maple syrup mustard sauce but the recipe called for too little syrup and mustard.  I love the initial resales despite burning these a bit and intend to double the syrup mustard sauce.   I will also add significantly more oil to the fry pan next time.

Really yummy and both my young kids loved it. In fact my 5yr old has requested it again for dinner tonight. I (like another reviewer) don't like fennel so used ground coriander instead. Also (mainly because I live in the UK) I used golden syrup instead of maple. Really nice and even my hubby who prefers spicy to sweet flavours loved it! Thanks for taking the time to put this on here.

Thought this recipe would be tasty and liked it because of maple syrup instead of a ton of sugar.  It was a resounding success!  Served it to six adults and three young kids and received nothing but positive feedback!  Now on my favorite list!  Oh, omitted fennel seeds, but followed recipe.

Easy and delicious. I didn't have fennel so I omitted. Also no spicy brown mustard so I subbed dijon. Also subbed real maple syrup for "butter pancake syrup". Just a broke college student, so I had to make due. Came out incredible though! Sweet, salty, savory, spicy. All of my favorite things. Flavorful without being too heavy, just as a pork loin chop should be. Can't wait to make for my friends!

Love, love, love this recipe especially the flavor the dry rub gives the chops.  I've used this twice since with both simple grilled and baked chops  with the same delicious results.  No worries if it sounds like the brown sugar in the rub or the maple syrup will make  it too sweet.  With the mustard (I used simple Dijon) it balances the flavors out.  I've even made the sauce separately as a BBQ sauce for ribs which was very good.  This is so very quick, easy, different and delicious its now one of my standards
