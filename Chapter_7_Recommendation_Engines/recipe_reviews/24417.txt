This recipe is very good and quick to make. It was a bit salty to our taste, possibly due to the canned broth I used, so next time I will reduce the salt. Also, I would use diced tomatoes instead of whole to blend in better and not have large chunks of tomatoes.

LOVED IT, will make again. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole peeled. I used 2T of Tamari instead of the  soy sauce, as  i was afraid, but will put the full 3T in next time. I also added one each of: sweet potato, white potato,1/2 cup of pumpkin puree,extra carrots, used olive oil instead of butter, and veggie broth instead of beef. Was excellent, and my new favorite for veggie soup. I also cooked some small pasta shapes (animals,stars,tubes,letters,etc.) separately and added them to the bowls and ladled the soup on top. with leftovers i kept the pasta separate so it wouldnt be mushy. YUMMM

Spices just right for my family. We like a heartier soup so I just added a diced white potato, can of yellow corn, cup of frozen green beans and 1/3 cup of alphabet pasta for my youngster--it was delicious on a snowy day!

Overall this was a pretty good soup and my husband loved it, but I did make a few alterations.  I added 2 potatoes, garlic powder, extra celery and carrots, kidney beans and oregano and it was very good.  It reheated very well without getting too thick and made enough to last the two of us 3 days for lunches and such.

This soup was DELICIOUS! I did reduce the soy sauce to 2 tablespoons, because 3 seemed a little much to me (I was glad I did) and used diced tomatoes in place of the whole (made more sense). Also, I just used salt to taste and not the entire teaspoon called for. I added in one diced zucchini and a few diced potatoes because they needed to be used up. When it was almost done, I added about 1 cup of small shell pasta and simmered until done, just to make it a little more hearitier. This made a really nice sized pot of soup. Two thumbs up from all of us and a definate repeat recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used to serve a group of 15. Everyone loved it. I make it often. It is also delicious by adding nutritous black beans. Also seems to enhance the appearance.

This soup is wonderful and oh so easy. Very good for a snowy winter's night. I added some corn and a can of green beans to the basic recipe. I was skeptical about the soy and worchester sauce but the flavor is so good! I'm sure the leftovers will be even better the next day.

I subsituted vegetable stock for the beef stock and added potatoes to the pot. It turned out really delicious. Sidenote - I had to double the amount of salt and spices to kick up the flavor. This was my first attempt at soup making and my roommates were very impressed. Thanks Shelly!

My first time making homemade soup was successful because of this recipe! I used chicken broth instead of beef broth made from bouillon cubes and it tasted great. I also added 2 cans of mixed vegetables (green beans peas beans carrots) and 1 can of Green Giant Niblets. I can't imagine a vegetable soup without them! Overall a good recipe - just needs a little work to taste like Grandma's!:)

I thought I would like this soup but I didn't. I don't think my family was impressed by it either. I added orzo pasta to make it a little heartier but it didn't help. I didn't like the flavor of the soy and worceshire sauce. It just gave it an odd taste in my opinion. I would not make it again.

Good vegetable soup. I used 1 1/2 cans diced tomatoes instead of whole (why use whole if you have to chop them?) I also added a couple zucchini. The celery wasnt very soft after 30 min of cooking but it could be b/c I cut them a bit bigger. Tasted good with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. I am curious to see if the leftovers taste better tomorrow.

Very tasty! The broth is delicious and the recipe goes together quickly. I chopped rather than diced the veggies and used Redi-Cut instead of whole tomatoes. I also added some petite frozen mixed veggies. Because of other reviews I waited until nearly the end of the cooking time to add salt to taste. I'll definitely make it again!

I used vegetable broth instead of beef because that is what I had added a diced Russett potato and a teaspoon of oregano. Everyone loved it oncluding my neighbor. I make this soup all the time and have passed it along to my relatives. Great job Shelly Thank you.

This has now become my favorite soup. The flavors were absolutely delicious..a little spicy a little tang but oh so perfect. And the best part is that it's easy to make and fast. I do recommend not adding salt until you have tasted it because of the broth and soy sauce. I ended up using very little extra salt. The only thing I did differently was to add a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of chopping the whole ones and adding a couple of potatoes. I will definitely be making this again and quite often. Thank you Shelly for this 10 star soup!

before making this soup I read all the reviews. I followed the advice of cutting the soy and Worcestershire sauce in half and I am glad I did. the whole amount would have been too much for my family. followed the rest of the recipe but added some corn and green beans. and 1/2 a 16 oz box of alphabet pasta which my kids loved. will be making again. I think you could add whatever vegetables you like and it would still be great.

good but not much to it. Good for a light dinner or lunch. Would be a good base to a beef stew. I think if I make it again I will use less soy sauce and worcestershire because I thought the taste was a little strong.

Gorgeous filling comforting soup. Lots of great flavour and so very simple to prepare. My only change was using fresh parsley at the end instead of dried during the cooking as that is what I had to hand. I will be making this soup again soon I am sure.

Didn't have Worcestershire sauce OR soy sauce added some onion salt instead. Didn't have any celery cut up a small potato instead and used 1 med. fresh tomato instead of canned. Still turned out GREAT! Next time I will be sure to add the Worcestershire sauce but this was EASY QUICK and fabulous!! I think this will become a household staple.

I really enjoy this soup. The one time I made it by mistake I bought crushed instead of whole tomatoes and it worked out even better. For variety add some frozen mixed vegetables and small pasta like shells or orzo. Don't use rice of any kind made soup too pasty.

I had some fresh tomatoes that needed to be used so I used the equivalent amount of fresh as indicated for canned. I simmered this covered and needed about 40-45 minutes for the carrots and celery to get tender. I also cooked a cup of pasta separately and divided it among the 6 servings. This is a good basic veggie soup with lots of room for customizing.

I made a whole pot of this vegetable soup for myself and I ate it all in three days. However I used evoo instead of butter organic vegetable broth instead of beef broth and I didn't use worcestershire sauce. I also added fresh parsley ripe tomatoes and squash.

I added a can of red kidney beans a couple handfuls of frozen green beans a 1/4 lb of fusilli pasta. It is a little strong on the soy sauce so next time I may only do 2 tbsp. It tastes a lot like my mom's minestrone soup!:-)

This is a wonderful recipe to "use up" what you have on hand very versitle and forgiving. I was in the mood for a veggie-filled meatless soup and this fit the bill perfectly. I had some serious tweaks to use what I had on hand no canned tomatoes but I did have a 15 oz zucchini with tomatoes and a fresh one which I diced. I also added two diced potato a small can of peas and some broken thin spaghetti. Also added a sprinkle or two of garlic powder and celery salt in place of plain salt. This was delicious and satisfying. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Plenty to go in the freezer for lunches.

This soup is fantastic. I made a few changes. I used 2 Tbsp. olive oil instead of the butter and added 1 potato 1 zucchini and 1 tsp oregano. I used vegetable broth instead of beef and with all the soy sauce there is no need for additional salt. Other than that I followed as written and it is fantastic and easy and very flavorful. My hubby loved it!! Very filling.

This turned out to be a surprisingly flavorful and delicious soup. After reading some of the reviews I took a few suggestions by not adding salt and used 2 14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes including the juice added 1 can of black beans and 1 can of corn kernels. In addition I added 1/2 cup of uncooked orzo. The recipe will stay in my collection from now on.

So good! I did modify it a bit though. Where's the garlic??? I added in 2 minced garlic cloves with the butter onions celery and carrots. I also added in cabbage and kale with the rest of the ingredients. The amount of soya sauce is spot on if you are using unsalted broth. Yum!

Very satisfying. This is just as the name suggests.... old fashioned but delicious. It reminds me of coming home for lunch from school. Goes perfectly with some crushed saltine crackers. The only change I made was to add some chopped frozen green beans and frozen corn kernels.

I added some corn and green beans that were leftovers. Also my husband thinks he's deprived if there isn't meat in soup so I added some small pre-made home style meatballs. Good flavor combo with the soy sauce and Worcestershire. Loved it! Will definitely make again.

This soup was very good. I followed the instructions although I accidentally reversed the measurements for the soy sauce and Worschestire. Still tasty though. Like most people have done and will do I added extra veggies meat potatoes and alphabet pasta. If you are adding extra ingredients to the soup I suggest increasing the amount of broth. Our soup ended up more like stew after all of the additions.

This is a great base recipe and I can see how some thought it was too salty but I really enjoyed the flavor the soy sauce and Worcestershire added. The reason I am not giving 5 stars is because this is extremely thin as written. Once I had the soup assembled, I saw that it was going to need something more. I chopped up a potato, threw it in, and that did the trick. Great recipe but I really think you need to add potato, noodles, or rice.
