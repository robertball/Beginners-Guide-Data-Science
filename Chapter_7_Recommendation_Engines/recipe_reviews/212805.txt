I don't usually comment on recipes but couldn't pass up this opportunity. The recipe written as is, is a wonderful, being such a time saver but I couldn't pass up enhancing it somewhat.  Personally I felt the classic mirepoix (onions, celery, carrots) would provide a depth of flavor. About 1/4 c. finely chopped of each were added while sauteing the chicken and garlic. Used frozen broccoli crowns and completed the recipe as written. It was still quick since I had cut up fresh chicken breast already defrosted. Excellent creamy taste and a definite keeper!!!

Not bad.  Bf loved this, and it is extremely easy.  I used already cooked frozen chicken which made it even easier.  I don't like ranch dressing much but you don't notice it too much.  I also used mozzarella instead of parmesan.  The serving size for this is interesting:  I halved the recipe, and still got 4 very large servings out of it.  If I had served anything else with it (I just put a plate of the stuff in front of both of us without anything else), I could have easily stretched that to 8 servings.  Even though we liked this, I'm glad I halved it since it's just the 2 of us and I'm not a huge leftover fan.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this for dinner tonight and it came out delicious!  We had fresh brocolli and cauliflower on hand, so I steamed that inside of used frozen and added it at the end of the noodles being done.   I had Ken's Ranch, and used that!  It was great, will definitly make again!
