I thought the fat content was too high.  Next time, I will try using applesauce instead.  This time, I used whole wheat flour and yogurt instead of ap flour and buttermilk. the family enjoyed this!

My husband and I love this cake! It is moist and delicious as well as beautiful.  I like to change recipes to make them healthier, so for the fat, I used 1/2 cup unsalted butter, about 1/4 cup coconut oil and about 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  For the flour, I used a mixture of white wheat grain, oats and flax that I ground in my VitaMix.  I used brown sugar and baked  in a large bundt cake pan (see photo above).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was the first time I have ever tried prune cake and I was delighted! I will use this one a lot.  It is wonderful with herbal tea.  Thank you, LauraT!

this is a very good cake moist and the taste is outstanding. I put a glaze on mine yum. My glaze was butter lemon and orange juice sugar and powder sugar did not measure but you should be able to figure it out. I used 1cup of white sugar and a half of a cup of brown sugar and i used a teaspoon of orange extract with the vanilla in the cake batter

This is so moist and delicious! I made half a recipe for six (6) jumbo muffins that baked perfectly at 350 deg F for 25 min. I replaced the shortening with a small cup of unsweetened apple sauce and 1 tblsp of coconut oil. I cut back on the sugar (which I normally do) by about 1/4 cup, using a combination of white and brown sugar and used 1 full tsp of vanilla. I also added the optional walnuts, plus 1 tblsp of ground flax seed. I topped the muffins with turbinado sugar and walnuts before baking which gave them a nice crunch. The spice amounts are spot-on for a delicious spice cake taste, but even better knowing there are prunes in this (but you would never know it)! I just had one with a hot cup of tea, and it was excellent! Thanks for a great recipe LauraT!

This is a terrific recipe. Super moist and delicious! It makes a lot. I don't have a 9" tube pan, so mine ended up in two 9" round pans, plus the extra in a bread pan. I baked all three at once for 30 minutes. 

Also, to stew prunes easily, try one of these methods: 1) Put them in a pan, cover with water, and simmer on low for 20-ish minutes, or until they look plump. 2) Put them in a container, cover them with water, and leave them in the fridge overnight. You can also add a touch of lemon juice to either method.

This is a slightly different version of a recipe that was passed down from my grandma. I use 2 9 inch round pans and ice with the following recipe: 4 tablespoons butter melted, 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice, juice from the stewed prunes, confectioners sugar and cinnamon to taste.

Fortunately the kids who truly do not like prunes LOVE it. Thanks for this great recipe. With the shells of the walnuts I made my 'hair-paint' at the same time. Lovely!

This is delicious. Spice balance is perfect. I used butter instead of shortening and reduce sugar by a half cup, but this was an excellent way to use up a bag of prunes. I will definitely make this again... and again. Great for gatherings because it's a nice big cake when made in a bundt pan. Just really excellent.

This is the perfect cake to enjoy with coffee or tea.  Very tasty and moist.  I gave it 4 stars only because it was a little too sweet for my taste.  Will definitely make again, cutting the sugar in half.  The sweetness of the prunes shined through quite enough for me.

I substituted buttermilk for milk and shortening for margarine. Added a vanilla frosting and it was delicious. I don't think I would have liked this cake much without frosting as the cake itself isn't sweet enough for me. Overall great recipe.

Very good! I read the reviews first an modified using applesauce, less sugar and I used a muffin tin as some suggested. My whole family loved them will make these again for sure!
