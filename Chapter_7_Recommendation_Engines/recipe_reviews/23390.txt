I bought my boyfriend the Waring Pro Belgian Waffle Maker for Christmas, but he didn't have a good waffle recipe.  I was in search of the "perfect" waffle recipe to replicate the flavor and crispness of hotel-style waffles because he would like to be able to wake up in the morning and pour pre-made batter onto the waffle iron and have a wonderful breakfast in a matter of minutes.  I was beginning to get discouraged after trying some other "highly rated" recipes and coming up short--they were either not crispy enough, too crispy, lacking substance, too doughy inside, too oily tasting, or too much like french toast.  Although the general ingredients in this recipe aren't too different from others, there's something about it that is spot on!  I made a couple of minor changes based upon what I've learned through other trial & error: I added 1/4 cup corn starch for crispness, used 1 3/4 cups milk and 1/2 cup buttermilk to add a little flavor.  I beat 2 Tbsp of the sugar in with the egg yolks (actually used Egg Beaters substitute) and 3 Tbsp of the sugar in with the egg whites, which stabilizes and softens the whites, improving the batter's longevity and making it much easier to fold into the batter.  I used 2 tsp vanilla and mixed 1 tsp with the yolks and 1 tsp with the whites after they were whipped.  I found I got the most uniform brown color when I used very little cooking spray.  These were fantastic!  They even smelled wonderful!  I may try adding malted milk powder next time

This is an okay recipe - I have found though waffles have a lot to do with a waffle iron and since I bought my Waring Pro belgian waffle iron it has made a world of difference - takes long as you can only make one at a time, but my the difference.  Also, I substitute in some corn starch into the flour mixture and this adds a nice crunch to the waffle.  Another thing I have learned is if you want to keep waffles warm to place them on the oven rack directly, don't ever stack them or put them on a plate, else they can get soggy.

This recipe made very good Belgian waffles! I used 2.75 tsps. baking powder and regular flour. I only waited about 10 minutes, while heating the iron. The only thing that could have been better was the spillage - it is hard to tell how full to make the waffle iron since they rise quite a bit. Don't overfill! Irons are not easy to clean if the batter overflows. I used a new Krups iron that makes 4 square Belgian waffles and the batter made about 9 of these. Add an eighth tsp cinnamon and serve with sweetened vanilla whipped cream...enjoy!

these waffles have quickly become the familys' favorite.  They smell so wonderful when cooking.  They truly are delicious.  I didn't have any self rising flour, so I added 23/4 t of baking powder to the flour.  The kids are fighting to get to the fridge in the morning to get the leftovers. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic waffles.  I must confess though, I couldn't wait the 40 minutes, but did let the batter rest about 5 before I started.  They still turned out perfect!  Thanks Emma!!

I got a new Krups Belgian waffle iron for Christmas and this is the 3rd recipie I've tried.  This one is by far the easiest and the best.  I've never seen my 3 year old eat waffles so fast.  Not having to deal with yeast makes this one a keeper for me.

Quite frankly I'm baffled!  I made these last night to use as a summer dessert. The waffles were somewhat tough.  I followed the recipe exactly even down to the self-rising flour (brand was Gold Medal).  There was batter left over so I made them for breakfast - same thing - they were tough, kind of rubbery.  I have been making homemade waffles for years and this is the first time this happened.  I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong.

made them for a breakfast at work, fixed the batter before leaving for work and by the time we started making them (with my handy waffle iron) the 40 minutes you're supposed to wait was up.  it worked out great, tasted great, everyone was very pleased.  i added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg for flavor.  great recipe!

First of all, this recipe, in my opinion, is not as simple as the description makes it sound.  That may have something to do with the fact that my handmixer is not working and I had to do it all by hand, but there were lots of steps just to make waffles.  

None the less, this recipe is fantastic!  The outside of the waffle is crispy and the inside is soft and delicious.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, with a couple changes.  First, I added a few tablespoons of malted milk at my husband's request.  Also, I only used half the salt that was called for.  Next time I will either skip the salt altogether or use unsalted butter, as it was still a little bit salty for my taste.

My husband raved about these waffles, I will most definitely be making them again!

I was worried that I muddled this recipe, but they came out fantastic.  A million times better than any boxed junk.  They were light and fluffy, with a crunchy outer edge, not chewy and tough like the boxed ones I've tried.  Also, the flavor is very good.  The only drawback is that you have to plan ahead or not want to eat right away when you make these since the batter has to rise.   I will definitely make these again, I just have to plan ahead better! Yum!

My family love these waffles! Couple of things I do to make it easier is  -  mix in the whole eggs at start.  I don't seperate the egg from the white.  It is perfectly fine without beating the whites.   I just use regular flour and then add 2.75 baking powder as an earlier reviewer suggested.   Also, the longest I have waited before cooking is about 20 minutes with the least being 10 minutes.  Either way the waffles are perfect! My boys love to top with fresh fruit and whip cream!

came out great.

Wonderful waffels. I did not separate the eggs, just beat until smooth, I also used Splenda instead of sugar. Otherwise followed recipe; I think next time I will follow review which suggested to use 1/4 cup cornstarch for crispness. My daughter-in-law suggested adding some cinnamon sugar next time which I will try. Will let everyone know how that turns out.

Absolutely loves these. Besides adding 1/2c cornflour & a pinch of cinnamon, i left everything as it is. Delish, crispy on the outside & soft on the inside.

Excellent!   I recommend you make a double or triple batch, they take a bit of time to make, so I make lots, then cool the extras and put in ziploc bags and freeze.  Pop them in the toaster for a couple minutes and they are just like fresh.

As I am relatively new to making Belgian waffles, I decided to try the two top recipes on allrecipes to do a side by side comparison for fun.   After my family and our brunch guests tried the two side by side, this recipe was the clear winner. The outside was crispy while the inside was tender, and it had the perfect amount of sweetness. The only thing I changed in the recipe was the amount of vanilla, which I always increase and I subbed AP flour with three teaspoons of baking powder for the self-rising flour since I didn't have any on hand.   If you enjoy a yeast flavor, this recipe does not have one...but my taste testers decided that the yeast flavor in the other Belgian waffle recipe didn't make the other waffles necessarily better (and the other waffles were so much more work to prepare).

I substituted cornstarch for some flour... recommended by another review, I don't think I added enough, they were fluffy, and a little crunchy, I was going crunchy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.  Be sure if you want that effect to add more than 1/2 cup of cornstarch (that's all I added).

I added 1/2 cup apple sauce to the mix.  Not only does this add sweetness but moistness, flavor and a little fiber too!

4.5 stars actually. I halved recipe and still got 4 waffles. I did like hottcoco81's review and added cornstarch to flour. I used 1 C flour and 1/8C cornstarch. I also used 1 tlbs of sugar while beating egg whites. Didn't have self rising flour so added 1-1/2 tsp baking powder to flour/cornstarch with 1/2 tsp salt. Didn't warm milk (added 1 tsp vinegar to it) just let it come to room temp. I also added fresh ground cinammon and nutmeg. Mine were light, crispy outside and REALLY good. I think adding a bit of cornstarch did the trick for outer crispyness. P.S. If you use baking powder (in leiu of using self-rising flour), and it's old - you won't get good results.

They were fine, but I like the Belgian Waffles recipe with yeast much better.  They had a great texture and cooked beautifully.

I thought these waffles were wonderful along with everyone else who has had them. Do let them rest before cooking them. I think that makes them.
Thanks for the great recipe.

I simplified this recipe significantly. I mixed the whole eggs into the batter in the first step and skipped the egg white/40 minute wait period altogether. I added some extra water once the batter was made because it appeared to thick for the waffle iron. They turned out great!

I also just got a waffle iron and this was my second recipe to try and will be the last - these were great!  They also freeze very well.

A bit miffed.  This was my first time using a self-rising flour, so I trusted the instructions over my instincts.  There was NO mention about covering the batter during the rising stage!?!
I should have looked for confirmation; instead, I trusted the instructions, and ended up with four not-quite-airy Belgian Waffles.

Next time, I'll put plastic wrap over the top.  But just by adding "Cover and . . .", this would be a perfect recipe.

Yum! Really really good!  I was hoping to find a recipe that was a bit better than typical waffles and I'm so glad I tried this recipe!!  I did have to make my own self rising flour (easy to find out how by searching the web) and I followed the tips that HottKoko81 shared - I topped mine with store bought frozen raspberries thawed - amazing!

Been trying out a lot of waffle recipes. This one wins. Only changed from self rising flour to regular flour with 1 1/2 Tbsp of baking powder. Came out great!

I followed the recipe to the letter and these waffles are amazing!  I served them with Ghiradelli white chocolate chips and fresh, plump raspberries.  All I can say is HEAVENLY!  Made on Saturday and making again on Tuesday!
Can't wait to eat them.  I'll even get up early to wait the forty minutes of rest time!

I was excited to give this a try because of all the great reviews.  I found this to be very bland and not light or crispy.  Followed the recipe to the letter.  I think I'll stick with a yeast recipe.

They were edible.. very chewy, and heavy.  Not what you think of for a Belgium waffle.  I followed the instructions exactly and they never rose, and therefor were very heavy in the middle.  I would use a receipe with dry yeast instead..

This is a good recipe. But I halfed it. By using only one cup flour (all purpose flour), one egg (separated), one tablespoon sugar, pinch of salt, left out the extract (didnt have any), one cup milk, and one teasp baking powder. It made exactly four waffles in my brand new iron from proctor and silex. And it came out really good. I think the trick is to gently fold in the egg whites and add to iron one time. And to not over mix the flour as that will activate the gulten and make the waffles heavy and more like a bread consistency.

This is a great recipe and it makes a LOT of waffles.  I had company and I'm a terrible judge of quantity.  I doubled the recipe because I didn't want to wait the 40 minutes again if I ran out.    I used my Kitchen Aid belgian waffle maker which is double sided and makes two waffles at a time.  

Each batch of this recipe make 6 BIG Belgian waffles.  By doubling the recipe, I ended up with 12 waffles - much more than needed, but the leftovers are delicious heated up in the toaster oven.    I did use another reviewer's suggestion and add 1/4 cup of cornstarch for added crispness.    These waffles were so good I will not be looking for another basic recipe.  THANK YOU!

This is my 2nd review.  I bought a Krusteaz mix just to have on hand.  My daughter had a sleepover last might and I now have a splint on my hand.  I thought the mix would be simpler.  Well, I still had to add water, oil, and egg, but the waffles tasted nowhere near as good as these.  Definitely worth the little bit of extra work.

FINALLY! A good belgian waffle from an inexpensive (i.e. cheap) waffle iron.  I made several modifications per previous reviewers recommendations (added 1/4 c cornstarch, extra 1/4 c milk, 2&3/4 tsp baking powder, and decreased salt), thus the 4 stars.  The true trick (thanks to a previous reviewer) is NOT to spray with Pam if you have non-stick.  I really think this helped to make it crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Now, I think my cheap iron has uneven heating, so some parts were "doughy" while most parts were perfect.  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand, as well as my cheap waffle iron.

These waffles had nice texture and weight but they were missing something even though I added extra vanilla, they are just not sweet enough.  I am not sure what to add, maybe some cinnamon.  I disagree with the other reviews that they don't have enough crunch, I wonder if other reviewers need a better waffle maker.  My waffles had a nice crunch to them they just need more sweetness.

These are good waffles, but they are NOT Belgian waffles. Without the yeast, they just don't taste like the real deal. And I went and bought sefl-rising flour just to make these. With cupboard space at a premium, that was a mistake.

My husband and I both thought these waffles were easy to make, but the taste and texture were just average/good, not great. They looked great, but were too "cakey" for our taste, and the flavor was nothing exceptional. We like the ones that are crunchy on the outside but moist on the inside.

ok waffle, too dense for a Belgian recipe.  The batter was very very thick even following the recipe exactly.  Perhaps more liquid would help with the dense quality.  I would not recommend this.

So good.  Light and fluffy on the inside with a great crunch on the outside.  These are the perfect waffle and would be great with any topping; although, we chose simple maple syrup.

These turned out so great!  I tried the yeast ones the first time I used my new waffle maker and they never blended but these were wonderful.  I froze 4 of them and they reheated beautifully in the toaster.  Thank you for this one.

Alot of work, but sooo worth it!!  I've been on the look out for a good waffle recipe since we had Mickey Mouse waffles at Disney that were so light and fluffy, these were very close!!  I used all purpose flour with addition of 2-3/4 tsp baking soda.. also I did not let the mixture set a full 40 mins, it was more like 10 or 15 mins, but they still turned out wonderful!!! Thanks Chef Emma for a great recipe :)

Very good and crispy. I used flour and b.powder. The trick with my cuisinart nonstick iron was to NOT spray or grease it. When I did the waffles were not crisp on the outside. Reheated the next mroning and they were very good!

I like the out come of the waffles but they seem like they needed something as far as taste. Kind of bland.I stuck to the recipe and wish I knew what to add. I thought maybe more vanilla, not sure. I am looking for the same flavor as comfort Suites Hotels waffles. They seem to have a very good flavor. Any one know out there?

Wow!  What wonderful waffles!  The first time I made them I forgot and left out the vanilla, and using maple syrup they were still great!  The second time, I included the vanilla, and I think they would have been better with butter pecan syrup instead of maple.  Thanks for the recipe!

Does take a little time but waffles are really good...cripsy on the outside, fluffy on inside! The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of the time needed to make them! Made about 16 4x5" Belgian waffles.  Followed recipe exactly.  Put thawed strawberries, blueberries,and blackberries on top.  Froze waffles that were left over.  Will reheat them on oven rack @ 325 degrees for 5 mins or less...hope they will still be good!

I read all the reviews to see if I could skip the waiting but mostly everyone advised against it. These turned out GREAT! Very fluffy and not dense at all. They were a bit salty so next time I will cut the salt in half and make sure I use unsalted butter. I like my waffles a bit sweet so I doubled the vanilla and added cinnamon (not sure how much I added, just a few shakes). 
My boys (all four of them) begged me to stop making them because they were stuffed! I froze the extras for afterschool snacks.

I added the yeast instead of using the self rising flour, they were a hit at a retreat I was making them for! Thanks

This is a great recipe.  I have never made Belgian waffles before and these worked great with my new waffle iron.  My family really enjoyed them.  They also freeze well, my daughter enjoys popping one in the toaster oven for an afternoon snack.  I hope others who had trouble will give this one a try again, they were very tasty when made properly.

This recipe was no different than any other ones I've tried and it wasn't worth the extra work.  I tried doubling the recipe because I use the large round Belgian waffle iron and they tasted terrible -- salty.   I've been trying to make Belgian waffles now for 11 years!!!! -- and have yet to find a recipe that look like the ones on the Belgian waffle boxes or like Big Boy's Belgian waffles.  I've had three different waffle irons and have tried numerous recipes.  I give up!!!! I'm going to tell my husband and son never to ask me to make them again and I'm tossing the waffle iron.

I've been trying waffle recipes since I bought my waffle maker and these are the best by far.  I think the vanilla really adds to the flavor.  They don't get too hard which I like (prefer a softer waffle to the crispy kind).  Now I'll see how well they freeze.  Thanks for the recipe!

These waffles were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   The batter was overly salty though.  Next time I will only use 1/2 tsp. of salt.  My family will be eating these again!

These are wonderful! I loved making them and my family adored them. I did however make a change on the butter to stick to my diet. I actually used Country Crock. Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and have to say I am so disappointed. It tasted TERRIBLE that even my kids wouldn't eat them, and my kids usually eat anything. It was way too salty and floury.  It wasn't crispy, and I even let it cook a little longer, to try and get that crispyness that I like. It was too cake-like. I would not recommend this, and I will not be using this recipe again, sorry.

These waffles were great! I didin't have the correct flour, so I did as another reviewer suggested and added baking powder.  It worked great!!  I can't wait to try adding blueberries or other tasty things to this recipe.

I've tried every waffle recipe on this site, this is the one that turns out the best. I took the advice of one cook and added corn starch and instead of stacking them, I placed them on my oven rack. They turned out perfect! I always add chocolate chips to a few of them, and they're the favorite treat around here!

These were good, but not my fav. The usual recipe I use from my first cookbook uses buttermilk and turns out crispier on the outside and lighter on the inside.  I'm big on the buttery flavor I guess.  The texture of this recipe was a little heavier than I like, but it worked in a pinch.

These are really unbelievable, the best belgian waffles I've ever eaten. However I did use half milk, half buttermilk (or use all milk but add 2-4 tbsp powdered buttermilk). They have so much flavor! Other delicious tweaks are: add mini chocolate chips (seriously, do I have to tell you that that would be good?) or a mashed-up banana or two.

Wow, this recipe is wonderful. We are new to waffle making and have only tried using our usual pancake mix before, but these were devine. We didn't use the salt (not our taste).  The leftovers were frozen between sheets of greaseproof paper and they were then popped in the toasted for breakfast during the week.  My daughter is promising to get up early on Sunday morning to make a batch to take to my son's rugby match, can't wait.

I just made these for my family this morning. Last week we tried the Classic Waffles recipe from this site, and all of us prefered this one. I did add the baking powder to the flour b/c I had no self-rising flour and it worked very well.

They were crisp on the outside, fluffy and nice on the inside. We served these with sausage patties and topped with real maple syrup and cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving. We even topped it off w/ a little cool whip.

I think this is the family favorite breakfast now. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe worked out great!!  I followed the directions exactly except for throwing in 1/2 a bag of frozen blueberries after the batter had rested.  My family devoured  them up before I got a taste!  So I am definitely doubling up the batch next time!

These were tasty but were not that fluffy.  I used all purpose flour and added baking powder (maybe that is what made them dense.)

I had to come up with a gourmet tasting recipe for a brunch - I loved the consistency of these waffles! I tried several different versions and had some interesting results. I use 1% milk for most things but used 1c cream and 1c milk to get away from the tartness Belgian waffles often seem to have… they turned out great – not too sweet, but not bitter. I did try the Nutmeg as suggested by one reviewer – I tried 2 tbl instead of 2.5 and that was WAY too much. The taste was overwhelming, bitter, and harsh – you need a simple waffle taste since there are so many delicious things to put on top! Loved the self rising flour instead of Yeast!!! GREAT WAFFLES!!

I was skeptical at first, but WOW was I glad I tried this recipe! The waffles taste really good even without any topping. I once had it rather cold and without butter or anything, and was surprised at how much flavor it has on its own. A definite keeper! Cooked waffles freeze well too.

These were part of our Easter brunch, they didn't last to long!  Since I had many things to do, I made the batter the night before.  We topped these with supreme strawberry topping (also from this site) and whipped cream.  Everyone enjoyed these!  These are a keeper.

I feel bad for the cook who is now throwing out their waffle iron!! These turned out great for us!! They were done at the same time as our baked eggs (thanks to a little planning ahead) and we enjoyed every bite. This was a great welcome to a cold Sunday morning! Thank you for posting this Emma.

I tried this recipe and I totally love it! This freezes and keeps well. I usually made twice the recipe and kept them, so that whenever we want to eat, we just toast it and it's back to its goodness!

These waffles are delicious. I have made them on several occasions and have never been disappointed including the time I didn't wait the full 40 minutes for them to set.  Happy Eating!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it did not disappoint! The waffles turned out perfectly crisp on the outside and light and tender on the inside. The sweetness was just right. The batter was easy to make and yielded exactly six waffles from the Oster flip Belgian waffle maker. Great basic recipe. This will be my go-to batter. Thanks for sharing this!

This is a basic belgian waffle recipe that I absolutely love.  My son's favorite food in the world are belgian waffles...So, I decided to find a simple homemade recipe to make my own.  I follow the directions to the T and add cinnamon for my son.  Just before I close the waffle lid, I put on any fruit my son likes.  I also like to crumble bacon or sausage and put on just before closing the lid.  Everyone in my household loves these...Way better than the box mess I used to make.  These are definitely a keeper and super easy to make.  I make them at least twice a week.

I have worked in restaurants that served Belgian waffles, and have made them at home, but these are hands down the best I have ever had! I don't keep whole milk at home, only 1% or 2%, but I have some buttermilk so I used that, don't know if it makes a difference, but they were good!

I didn't have self rising flour so just added baking powder to AP and it worked perfect! Also used it right away ( no standing time) The flavor was so wonderful. Will use this recipe over and over! Thank you for posting this awesome recipe!

These turned out excellent!  I used 1 cup water and 1 cup milk, margarine instead of butter and 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder as I did not have self rising flour.  I let the batter sit about 15 mins and they cooked up great!

Yum! Two minor changes: 1. I didn't bother with beating and folding the egg whites, I just beat everything together and they were perfect. 2. I used a/p flour and 1 tbsp of baking powder. They are heavy on butter, but it makes the waffles a guilty pleasure. The best I've tried on this site, by far, and there are some good waffle recipes here!

As a gift, received a waffle iron. My daughter gave me a recipe with yeast and honey. On Daily Recipe coincidentally, there was Emma's Belgian Waffles. I had all the ingredients, made them and the recipe is a "keeper". It's easy, delicious and is my husband and I enjoyed it. They are now in the freezer for future use. Thank you.

Excellent recipe that creates dense, rich waffles that reheat (toast) well days later. Other waffle recipes can taste very "eggy" but not this one. They are not quite sweet enough for my family, as written, but that is simple to adjust.

WOW-EXCELLENT!Followed recipe exactly and came out perfect. Very light and fluffy. I did add a little cinnamon but this is a basic recipe so I am sure any extras you want to try would taste wonderful. Taste great next day warmed in the toaster oven-crispier. One problem-husband and son loved soooo much, I can never make the boxed mixture again-nor do I want to! Thanks Emma for the great recipe!!

I have been trying out waffle recipes since getting my new waffle iron a few months ago.  These are by far the best waffles we have tried.  I like the taste and they came out perfectly light and fluffy with a crispy exterior.  Delicious!

Excellent waffles. My daughter (also Emma) and husband loved them. I added a few shakes of cinnamon sugar and nutmeg to the batter for extra flavor. The only complaint I would have is the amount of steps and time it takes to make these although the taste was worth it. I do wish the outside was a little crispier but I have a feeling that is a waffle iron issue because all recipes I have tried are not crispy on the outside. Oh well.

I had a bag of self rising flour that I had used for one recipe.  So I found this waffle recipe using the self rising flour.  I found having to wait to use the batter was a litle annoying, but actually turned out to be worth the wait!

These waffles are the best! I have to say they are better than anything I had at any restaurants. They have a lovely vanilla flavor with a crisp skin. Strongly recommend this recipe. Thanks Emma for sharing.

the waffle batter had a good flavor but came out heavy and soggy in the middle, barely crisp on the outside with poor uneven color. took longer than usual to cook. they were edible, however i'll give one more try with a little less milk

waited about 15 min. and they were very dense and my family didn't like them at all.  Maybe if I waited the 40, but that is to long when you have little kids

I followed this recipe to the letter.  It came out dense and heavy as a brick.  I have a professional belgian waffle maker and was excited to try one that didn't use yeast.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I think I'll just stick with my old "stand by".  Thanks

These waffles were wonderful.  Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.  They almost melt in your mouth.  I will definately keep this recipe and make it often.

I just had to do a review to add another 5-star rating.  These are the best waffles I've ever made.  I can't tell what's so different about the recipe, but they come out crisp and perfect.  I don't have self-rising flour so I just add baking powder and a little salt.

These were easy to make and pretty tasty.  I would skip the salt next time.  This was a good substitute when I ran out of pancake/waffle mix.

These are absolutely wonderful! I made a test batch at home and my kids (8 and 4) wolfed them with ice cream and fruit. Then I made them for a large party at work and everyone wanted the recipe!
They are NOT salty, the texture is excellent, and anyone who thinks a mix is better obviously has never had a real Belgian waffle.
Thank you so much for this recipe,Emma!

I just got a waffle maker for Christmas and chose this recipe because of all the wonderful reviews.  I don't eat waffles but my family does and they thought these were nothing special.  They liked the waffles from a ready made mix much better, so why go to all bother of making this one?  Sorry, I probably will not make this again.

The waffles were good, not over the top. I thought this recipe was a fair amount of work. The whipping of the whites took me 5 minutes alone. I guess I drown my waffles with too many toppings, to get a fair assessment. My absolute favorite way to enjoy a Belgian waffle is with thawed strawberries (in their own syrup) and sliced bananas. Topped with a generous amount of whipped cream. It's heaven on earth.

These were simple to make and absolutely delicious. I only had one egg so halved the recipe. I added a bit of cornstarch, as others suggested, and did get that nice crunch. TY!

Someone recommended using 2.75 tsp and regular flour. I did as well as used almond extract because I didn't have vanilla. It was a big hit with my family. Our dogs even liked it

I needed a waffle recipe that actually made good waffles. I have struggled with it in the past. Tried these and after reading reviews I used 2.5 cups of flour & 1/4 cup of cornstarch. They turned out SO good. Crispy. Yummy. Everyone loves them including my picky husband. Will definitely make again and again.

I didn't have any self rising flour so I added 2 tablespoons of baking soda (the second one not filled all the way to the top because it's actually supposed to be 23/4 teaspoons). It was AMAZING!!! My parents really liked it. Thanks for the recipe!

These waffles are super dense, not fluffy at all... They're pretty good, but you definitely want to lather them with butter when you serve these waffles. Most recipes for waffles make waffles that aren't as filling as this recipe. I usually eat two waffles when I eat other recipes, but I can barely finish one with this recipe. 

I'm pretty sure this is a biscuit recipe someone adapted to put in the waffle maker

Will definitely make it again. After folding in egg whites, I was too hungry to wait 40 mins. for the first batch but no harm done. I suggest adding a note with directions for making self-rising flour. Also, when I save breakfast or dessert recipes containing eggs, I indicate the number of eggs in the category name. In this case, I would save under  category "Breakfast 2 eggs." Especially helpful If you are down to your last egg.  You just check "Breakfast 1 egg."

Sorry but these waffles were like thick and dense.  They even felt heavy to lift!  No one at my table even ate them.  I followed the recipe including letting the batter rise for 40 mins.  Won't be making these ever again.  Its Belgian Waffles with yeast for me.

I've been making these for years but I didn't realize I never "reviewed" them!  They are great waffles!  I eat them plain but my kids like them with syrup.  They cook up nice and brown and not doughy at all.  I did try to make them GF but that didn't work so well.  So, some mornings we don't do GF.

Good recipe BUT. Way to much first time made it a tea spoon of salt almost completely ruined the batch. I had to drop some pretty heavy sweets to balance it out.
My suggest for an edit is add a pinch of salt or remove it from the recipe.

I made these for my family with fried chicken and bourbon maple syrup.   It was incredible!   The waffles were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.    I followed the recipe just as written.  This will be a new family tradition for us!

I just bought a Cuisinart Vertical waffle maker on Black Friday and I was itching to try it out. My family loved this recipe! I modified it slightly as I did not have self rising flour, I used 2 3/4 cup all purpose flour, 1 tbsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt. I omitted the 1 tsp salt as my butter was salted. I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. My waffle maker yielded 6 waffles. I did not let it sit 40 minutes either maybe 10 but the texture was perfect, the trick is separating the eggs. Thanks, this is a keeper!

So, I think this recipe is . Are people really too lazy to add baking powder and salt on their own? And who has time to let the batter sit for 40 minutes?? Anyway, I made this recipe, sort of, using regular flour, and adding baking powder and extra salt. I also didn't let it rest, or warm the milk. But, I made it, and the waffles were delicious! :)

this recipe!  I think it's the best I've come across and my picky girls agree.  So much so they dominated them.  Since I live in Australia waffles aren't easy to come by and this recipe hits the mark of a good ole dinner brekkie!  They also are great for weekday morning on the run just come cook a batch up on the weekend and then pop them in the toaster to reheat- keeps them nice and firm and Krispy

Thought it tasted great!   Used goose and duck eggs instead.  The flavor was fantastic.   Easy to make.   Froze the rest for later.

Using the flour that was in the container we've always kept self-rising flour in, I happily mixed up my batter. They were the densest waffles I've ever seen. My best guess is that my "self-rising" flour was actually semolina flour left from previous pasta-making. . A little salt would have helped.

Perfectly light and crispy waffles.  Whipping the egg whites didn't take much longer and made for a lighter waffle.  I will definitely make again.

I would actually give this recipe 4 1/2 stars as I did deviate a bit, not separating the eggs in the mix.  I made my own self rising flour by removing 2 tsp of flour from each cup and adding 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt into the mix.  I also used half butter and half applesauce.  I do that for baking muffins, sweet breads, etc. so I thought I would try it with the waffles.  It worked very well in my Presto Belgian Waffle Maker.  My husband thought they were the best of all the recipes I have tried, and they freeze well.  Next time I would like to prepare the batter the night before.  I am not a morning person.

Yum Yum Yum!  My family made these waffles for dinner and they were amazing.  As long as you follow the recipe, they will turn out great.  We have a bigger waffle iron so about 3/4 cups of batter worked for our iron.  That is just something you will have to figure out with your waffle iron.

This recipe was pretty good. The flavor was nice. I took points off because it took long to prep. For sure not "quick morning" waffles. I did not have the self-rising flour so I used all purpose instead, and I guess it was fine. They still plumped nicely.

I used the Toastess waffle maker my sister bought my mom about 7 or 8 years ago (2nd time it's ever been used). And Halved your recipe....it turned out great! Simply delightful. I'm going to actually fold in the egg white next time just to see whether it makes a difference or not. Otherwise...buttery, fluffy, goodness.....I liked your recipe so much I even linked it to my amateur blog ^^

the waffles tasted really good, but they did not work in the waffle maker AT ALL. I ended up making them as giant pancakes.  Perhaps it has something to do with the consistency

a lot of work, but it pays off in the end.  Most other waffle recipes either (1) taste meh, or (2) require you to prepare batter the night before, which is not really practical in our world.  This is a nice balance between the two.  We also have a ton of self rising flour which I have no other use for so this is a good use for that.  Gotta go, the masses are demanding more waffles!!

These are just fantastic.  My kid is a Southern Waffle House style waffle lover and she said these are even better than theirs!   I have an old, cheap waffle iron and they come out perfect!   I rarely have time to allow the batter to sit, but either way they are soooo good!

This recipe has spoiled us!  I can honestly say I've never had better.  We use it for making waffles and pancakes.  I especially like that they are perfect with some fresh fruit, no syrup needed.  I don't ever buy self-rising flour, so I just used the standard conversion with no problems.  Wonderful!

My 3 year old and 19 month old approve.  I love waffles and unfortunately my mom is a great cook that does not meaure so I have been searching for a great waffle recipe.  I found it.  I did not wait the total 40 minutes because I was already getting "Mom, I'm hungry!" and they turned out great with a wonderful flavor and my kids ate like i had not feed them in days;)

wonderful recipe.  Nice and light.  Made 6 big waffles.  I used regular white flour and added 1tsp each of baking soda and baking powder.  You could use whole wheat flour too.  Could reduce the sugar by 2 tbsp to make them a bit less sweet.

Fantastic waffles, light and airy plus slightly crispy. Perfect all by themselves or with a touch of real maple syrup. I also did not wait the full amount of time and added baking powder as I did not have self rising flour.

This was a great recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly (although may not have completely waited 40 min before cooking).  My hubby and daughter loved them too!  I froze my leftovers and they were just as yummy popped in the toaster the next day.

The whole family really enjoyed these waffles.  I made them just as the recipe called for and had my husband asking to make them again.  We topped with strawberries and banana for a healthful treat. We'll make these again and again.

So yummy, I won't be ordering belgian waffles at the restaurants any more.  I did substitute milk for soy (my daughter is allergic) and used Nucoa margarine in place of butter.  I also used 4 tbsp sugar and it all tasted yummy!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very Good recipe, I did add some nutmeg and some cinnamon to give it more flavor, and I only let it sit until the iron was hot.  But very good.

Fabulous waffles!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  The second time though I accidentally used 3 eggs.  What a wonderful accident.  They turned out even lighter.  It's a family favorite.

This was a great recipe.  Very tasty.  Light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Don't be turned off by having to "fold in" the eggs - very easy.  The batter was heavier than I thought it would be, but didn't matter for the end product.  I used splenda instead of some of the sugar (used 2 tablespoons sugar and rest splenda).  Also, used 2 tsp. of vanilla!  Great flavor.  Everyone enjoyed-small kids included.  Made two batches, but didn't double given the self rising flour.  Had left overs, they freeze well and then just pop in the toaster for a quick warm up!

Although this recipe is not a simple one it is SO YUMMY!  Hubby was supposed to make them but the folding in of the egg whites scared him away.  Nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Definatly making more of these soon!

These waffles are delicious! I do have a bit of a sweet tooth so I added a bit more vanilla extract and sugar for a richer taste, even without that though, they are still the best waffles I've ever tasted!

This recipe is very good. I got a belgian waffler for christmas, and the recipes that came with it were not good, and they were more difficult to make also.  These are great!  Thanks so much! Oh, I got 7 round waffles from the mix.

Although the taste was fine, I had a problem with the waffles being quite heavy.  It could be because I did not make adjustments for the high altitude.  The forty minute wait makes this difficult to make for a weekday breakfast.

Very good!  I didn't intend to wait the 40 minutes, but right after I prepared the batter we had a power outage, so the batter ended up sitting a little over an hour.  It was thick...so I added a little milk to thin out.  Very tasty, will definitely make again!

Ok, so I have a waffle recipe that I LOVE but Im always looking for something new and exciting and I found this waffle recipe and thought I would give it a spin. It was just ok. Not sure why I didnt like it. So I am only giving it a 3 star. Sorry Emma (good name btw, my daughters name).

These waffles are awesome! The egg whites make them light and fluffy, and the flavor is right on. If they get soggy on you while you're keeping them warm in the oven, turn up the heat...300 degrees and they'll be nice and crispy when you're ready to eat. Made some with crumbled bacon mixed in the batter as well!

If you like Belgian waffles but don't like the yeasty taste, then these waffles are for you.  Very easy to make and very tasty, though not super light and fluffy.  We thought they were just a tad sweet so I think next time I would cut back to 4 Tbsp. of sugar (1/4 cup).  Also, I will double the recipe and freeze the extras.  I was able to get about about five 7" waffles.  Thanks for sharing!

The waffles were a little bland.  They might work if the waffles were decked out with fruit, etc., but I simply used maple syrup and there was definitely something left to be desired.

Perfect! I made the recipe exactly as directed, plus I threw in a bunch of frozen blueberries. They were delicious! The recipe made about 12 waffles on my waffle iron (round-ish, about 6-7" in diameter) and they freeze really well! I recommend pear or apple sauce instead of syrup. Yum! :)

Wonderful recipe as is.  My son was thrilled with breakfast this morning.  Very fluffy and had a great taste.  It did seem like a little more work than the usual recipe but well worth it.

These tasted great, and were light and fluffy.  They got a rave review from an 8 year old waffle critic as well.  The only drawback is they take a bit more time to make.  Well worth it though!

My family loved these! I didn't let it sit for as long as it was supposed to, since they were already drooling in the batter, but this is definately a classic, fluffy waffle. The extras were frozen for later in the week and, needless to say, made the Eggo-waffles look as undesirable as cardboard. Thanks!

I didn't like this recipe, very little taste to the waffle.  I prefer ones that have a subtle sweetness and therefore do not need butter or syrup.

These waffles were really good. I topped them with Billy's spiced gingerbread syrup, also from this site.

I've been searching for the perfect waffle recipe for awhile, and these come pretty close.  I like the fact that they don't use yeast.  They don't take too long to make in the morning.  They are light and crispy on the outside.  I'd like them to be a little fluffier, but this is probably the best you can do without yeast.  My husband thought they were the best waffles I've ever made, but I think I can still improve a bit.

This recipe was perfect.  I was looking for a belgium waffles recipe without yeast and this was great nice flavor.  I topped mine with blueberries and strawberries sweetened and then with whipped cream.

These waffles were really good.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  I served them with fresh strawberries and whipped cream and they were fantastic!

I just finished making this batter and waffles.  I followed the directions and after cooking the first 2 waffles, I tasted them...and good thing I did.  They had an overwhelming flour taste.  I compensated by adding more sugar, vanilla and some cinnamon.  It improved somewhat but I don't think I will make this recipe again.

Gave this a 4 as it is quite good, when you have time or need to make a do ahead batch, but not when your family want waffles within the half hour. I forgot to warm the milk (why?) and the waffles still turned out right and delicious. I also doubled the vanilla flavour, as the beaten egg whites folded in last made them 'egg-ier'. This is good when you have time to wait around.

Absolutely fab recipe! My hubby adores them. Came out perfect even with the flour substitution and only waiting 20 min for the batter to rise. Can anyone help with how to add banana mush to the mix without ruining the texture? Thanks!

This recipes was awesome. I didn't have any self-rising flour either, so I took someone else's suggestion and kept the original amount of flour (2 3/4 c) but used all-purpose and added 2 3/4 tsp baking powder to it. It turned out wonderful. Very fluffy. They didn't rise a ton, but I credit that to not using the correct ingredients. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand. Thanks Emma!

This has become our preferred waffle recipe.  I think the anticipation while waiting for the rise adds to the flavor.

Excellent!!!! We all love these. I have made these for my sister who is very picky about her waffles, and she loved them! I even use the substitution mix for the self-rising flour without a problem.

I have come across several belgian waffle recipes and found this one to be the best. Not only is the taste and texture excellent it is so easy, for two or a crowd.  I have even used buttermilk a time or two.
