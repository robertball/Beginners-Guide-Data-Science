Oh my goodness. I usually sort recipes by rating or popularity, but I had some vanilla yogurt I wanted to use up and found this by the ingredient search. Do NOT let the newness of the post fool you. These were the best scones ever. I try to follow the recipe as posted the first time around and would have done so this time, however, I accidentally put the milk in with the eggs and yogurt. Ooops. Of course it created a stickier dough so I had to add a bit of flour. But the result was moist, chewy delicious scones!

Wonderful recipe!  Used Banana flavored chobani (because that is what I had) and added one mashed ripe banana to highlight the banana flavor.  Also added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  Next time I will glaze them!  Thanks for the recipe Paula!

Sorry... Hit send before review was done.  I was excited about a yogurt based scone recipe, to save some calories from the traditional all-butter base. I used baking powder (not soda), and next time will reduce to 3/4 tsp as the dough was plenty fluffy.  I also added 1/4 cup Craisins. Without all the butter, the texture is not as crumbly as a traditional scone, and mine really were quite dry after cooling.  Might have been the addition of the Craisins, so I will add a full cup of yogurt next time to improve the moisture content when using dried fruit. Worth tweaking, to arrive at a good lower calorie scone recipe.  Thanks to Paula for putting the recipe out here...I love scones, and I really want a good lower calorie version!

Mmm! So good! The only thing I changed was the flavor of yogurt used (Honey) everything else I made as directed, and they turned out lovely! Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I used 8 tbsp of butter; instead of vanilla yogurt, which I thought I had but did not, I used strawberry yogurt, and I added 1/2 tsp of grated lemon peel. They came out delicious.

I made these just over 12 hours ago and my daughter and I ate them all up! I already had all of these ingredients on hand, which was really nice. The dough was super sticky and therefore somewhat unpleasant to knead. We ran out of white sugar so I had to sprinkle some brown sugar on top instead, but they did come out really nice! I've never had a scone quite like it. They were SUPER chewy. I happen to like that in a carbohydrate, but it might not be for everyone. I also noticed the vanilla flavor from the yogurt was really pronounced (I used Brown Cow cream-top yogurt). The only reason I wouldn't give five stars is that the dough was hard to work with and the texture was so unusual (but tasty!).

Made these for my quilt club that visited over the weekend.  I usually don't lik etrying something new and giving it out when I haven't even tasted it yet, but I did that with these and they were a big hit.  I even had to give someone my copy of the recipe and had to print myself a new copy.  Followed the recipe exact, my only issue was the dough being realy, realy sticky.  Had to add a bit of extra flour just to be able to kneed.  I also used sanding sugar on top instead of just regular whit sugar.

Yes, scones were light... Looked more, what I know as "Biscuit" texture.  Added 1/2 cup Craisins.  Great taste! Sweet... not too.

My mom was asking me if I ever made light scones, because I make some out of oat flour that are tender but heavy -because, ah, oat flour- so I found this recipe to try out for her and she LOVED them. I ended up putting some organic blueberries in them as well and she really enjoyed them. So glad I found this great recipe! (I made two plain and two chocolate chip for myself too.)

This is a great scone recipe!  I made this recipe while we were glamping on the California Coast.  I didn't have a pastry cutter or rolling pin, so I cut the butter into small pieces and used a wire whisk to cut in the butter.  I had  an empty bottle to sub  for the rolling pin.  I also had to substitute plain (goat) milk yogurt for the cream.  I gently folded in a small amount (1/4 cup) of frozen blueberries just before rolling.  They were wonderful, tender, and flakey.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious...so moist. I added a half cup of dried berries to the recipe and wanted to take a picture because they looked so good...didn't make it. My son, husband and I pretty much ate the whole batch (mostly my son). I will definitely make these again and maybe I'll hide a couple so my husband and I can have at least one more a piece. Lol

This is an excellent scone recipe. We have put all types of things in them and they always come out perfect. If you like a nice moist scone, these are for you, the yogurt makes sure they aren't dry

Used coconut oil instead of butter and whole milk plain yogurt with a few tsp of Saigon cinnamon. They were amazing. Thanks for your work on this!
