HELPFUL TIPS AFTER TRYING SEVERAL TIMES: What a unique twist and pleasant change to a traditional chocolate chip cookie (which Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie is the best).  This is definitely chewy due to the coconut which adds to the pleasure of eating this.  I recommend 1.5C of coconut, 3/4C butter (the 2 extra T isn't necessary), 1/2C of pecans (they're softer than walnuts which is why I wouldn't substitute), and I used a medium scoop which produced 30 cookies at 10 min.  I am not sure why some users had trouble with the oven temperature because it's perfect.  I'm thinking they cooked a lot longer or made teeny weeny sized cookies.

After one bite of these cookies I thought ewww, too sweet, too gooey. I hate to review these and be the voice of dissent to all the rave reviews--I'll wait till hubs gets home and see what HE thinks. When I saw him  get a glass of milk I already thought I knew the answer. And then he said, "Ooooh, these are good--sweet and gooey. This is the kind of cookie I could eat till I get sick."  Guess that answers why I gave these a four star rating rather than three...

These cookies were amazing.  I made these about a week or so again.  I used a little less butter, 1.5 cups of the coconut, pecans, and chocolate chips, and I used glazed pecans instead of regular ones.  They were an instant favourite!  I got 39 cookies out of it.  

I actually made them again a couple days ago.  I cut out a little more butter, added more fillings this time.  They're still really good, but I think I preferred the 1.5 cup fillings more.  Cutting out butter doesn't affect the greatness for me.  I made them slightly bigger and got 36 cookies.

For me, for my oven, 8 minutes is PERFECT.  Just lightly golden brown on the bottom, tiny bit of goldenness on the top, soft, moist, and chewy.

Warning: ADDICTIVE! These are awesome cookies, I just ate 3 in a row! Only thing I did differently was to use semi-sweet chips since that is all I had on hand. I'd like to make them again using the milk chocolate, I'm sure that would be even yummier. Thank you!

I was kind of hesitant to make this recipe because there were not alot of reviews on it.  I'm glad I decided to make because they were sooo good. I was undecided on what kind of chips I wanted to use so I used both semi and milk chocolate.

**UPDATE** I've made these cookies without the coconut and once without the coconut or nuts and they are still good and soft.  I am going to make this my recipe for basic chocolate chip cookies, also.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Used  1 1/2 sticks of butter (3/4 cup) - turned out amazing. Best cookies I have ever made. I also made the cookies a few other times using chopped macadamia nuts (1/2 cup)- really yummy substitute for the pecans.

I followed the directions as is except I did not have any nuts. These turned out wonderfully.  I used a small scoop to drop the cookies onto a baking stone. They kept there shape and were deliciously moist and chewy.  I will try to remember to make these for the cookie exchange next holiday, I am sure they would win first place!

Wonderful cookie.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and they were delicious.  Next time I will double the recipe.

Made it exactly like the recipe stated.  These have too much butter.  This is basically a chocolate chip cookie with coconut and pecans added.  After making the dough I added the chocolate chips like the recipe stated and then halved the dough.  My kids don't care for coconut and pecans so I baked the first half as just chocolate chip cookies.  These came out very flat and greasy like the recipe on the back of the chocolate chip bag.  With the other half of the dough I added half the coconut and pecans called for.  This made the cookies true to the original recipe.  These came out with some texture and not nearly as flat, but still a little too greasy for me.  I definitely like the addition of the coconut and pecans.  With a little of the dough left I added some craisins.  Mmmm...yummy.  The craisins added a nice touch.  I would definitely add coconut and pecans to another chocolate chip cookie recipe, but this wasn't the one as written.  It was a good idea though so I give it 4 stars because the concept is good.

Fantastic!!   I cut the butter to 3/4 cup but otherwise it was perfect.  4-09  Ok, I made these again but this time I substituted the pecans and used slivered almonds instead.  Oh, my goodness; I have found the perfect cookie!!!

These cookies are absolutely wonderful. I did change only 1 thing. Instead of using chocolate chips I used heath chips. My husband thought they were wonderful. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I made this recipe without the chocolate chips because I just wanted a coconut pecan cookie.  They are DELICIOUS!!!  Followed the recipe exactly. Tip (7/8 cup butter = 3/4 cup).  Baked for 10 minutes and they came out perfect.  Thanks for this great recipe, will be making if often.

With the following adjustments as recommended by other reviewers, this is a real winner! Everyone loved these - they're addictive. I made smaller cookies, so I was able to get 48. They don't spread much, so you can load up the cookie sheet. Just a couple of minor changes: reduce the butter to 3/4 cup and increase the coconut to 1-1/2 cups. You can use any type of chocolate you prefer; milk chocolate, semi-sweet or white. I personally like it with the white chocolate chips best. It's a really nice combination with the coconut. My friends agree this recipe rocks!

The recipe calls for a little too much butter, but if I cut out a little, it would be perfect. The cookies are moist and taste great! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipie.  I didn't quite have enough nuts, but it still came out great.  Next time I will probably cut the sugar down a bit... and maybe make with almond extract.  Great cookie!

These cookies are very good. I love coconut and chocolate together. I used 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet morsels, 1/2 cup of white chocolate morsels and 1 cup walnut pieces. Along with the cup of coconut. Great cookie recipe! Thank you.

I was expecting a lot more "island" based on the cookie name.  As is, this is 3 1/2 stars.  With the additions that have been recommended, it's 5.  I'm rating the cookie as-is.  Too much butter IMO, and not enough coconut for an "island treasure" flavor.

LOVE these! They have become my favorite cookies and are often requested by my step-daughters as well as my co-workers. I usually substitute walnuts for the pecans because I think they go great with coconut. Great recipe!

Too much butter!!  My cookies ended up spreading too much and being very thin and greasy.  Better to reduce the amount of butter to 3/4 C. This essentially is a chocolate chip cookie with the addition of coconut.  Next time I will just add coconut to my favorite chocolate chip recipe.

Super awesome cookie, chewy and crisp!  I tweaked this a little- about 1 1/2 cups coconut, no nuts, replaced with 1 cup white chips, used 3/4 cup butter.  Baked about 12 minutes for my oven.  Rave reviews from both my husband and kids and the friends at our bible study

These are super great if you make them WRONG!  The first time, I accidentally used 7/8 of a STICK of butter instead of a CUP, & they were EXCELLENT!  They were soft & thick...delicious!  A few weeks later, I tried them with the correct amount of butter, and they were crispy & flat.  Now, I just soften a stick & cream it real good with the sugars, and they turn out great every time!  Last week, I took them to a block party, and all of my neighbors LOVED them!

These cookies were a big hit when I brought them for my co-workers. I used bittersweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate because it was what I had on hand. The pecans really complemented the other flavors in these cookies. Very tasty!

These cookies were absolutely delicious. They were very tasty and moist (most of which was probably attributed to the coconut in the batter). The only thing that I noticed was that the batter was tough by the time I added in all the flour, so it made it harder for me to make it into balls to put onto the pan. But aside from that, these were the perfect cookies that I would definitely make again.

I've never been good at baking cookies but these came out great!  My guy doesn't like sweets that much but proceeded to tell me that these were the best cookies that he's ever had!  I took them to work today because I didn't want to be tempted to eat them all, and they were all gone before lunch!  The only change I made was to use semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the milk.  I also found that flattening them a bit (instead of keeping them in balls)on the cookie sheet results in a prettier cookie.

Amazing!  These cookies are absolutely delicious!  I used margarine instead of butter and Splenda in place of the white sugar (always do).  I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips and walnuts instead of pecans (personal preference).  This will be going into my recipe binder for sure!

my new favorite cookie, and I LOVE cookies.I did toast my pecans before adding to the mix.  Toasting adds a great flavor and takes only about 7 minutes just chop them up and spread them on a cookie sheet at 350-375.  I can't say it enough, great cookies.

These were really good and really moist.  I doubled the recipe.  I made them for Thanksgiving because I have some good and fresh pecans that I wanted to use and I knew there would be plenty of pecan pies.  I got lots of compliments and my aunt wanted the recipe.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips, but I would like to try the milk chocolate caramel swirl as another reviewer mentioned.  I will definitely make these again.

I made this recipe with just the Chocolate chips but I used dark and white chocolate, and I used white vanilla extract, and they turned out perfect! These were the best cookies that anyone in my family (myself included) has ever had! It's a new family favorite.

So delicious. I used slivered almonds instead of pecans and semi sweet chips instead of milk chocolate. Makes ordinary chocolate chip cookies special.

Wow, this is a great recipe. I was in the mood for something a little more than just a chocolate chip or cowboy cookie and these were perfect.  I made them exactly as stated in the recipe and the first batch was just a wee bit runny so I added 1/2 cup of regular oatmeal and the rest were were perfect.  I only had margarine and that may have been the problem.  This will become one of my family favorites.   Next time I'll double the recipe so I can share with friends and neighbors.  Thanks for a winner!

My only change to the recipe was reducing to 3/4 cup butter and they came out perfect! They were really popular with my friends, would make them many more times after this. (Wondering who else found this recipe through the Rose Buddies podcast lol)

YUMMMM!  I used semi-sweet chips since that's what I had, but these are fantastic!  Everyone loves them!  I think I prefer these over regular chocolate chip cookies, because the coconut adds great flavor and texture.  Yep, I'm going to have another right now.  Thanks for sharing!

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.  It's excellent as is, but I love tweaking my recipes, so with this one I substitute about a 1/3 of the white flour for whole wheat and I add a tablespoon of golden flax seeds to make a cookie with an incredible texture.

A little too dry! I might try making these again, but with some changes to the recipe posted. Maybe less nuts and coconut and more egg (2 small instead of 1 large). Although I gave it four stars since my fiancé still thought they were pretty good.

Holy yum! I was a little annoyed by the odd measurements (7/8 cup of butter??) but dang!! That's a great cookie! A little chewy with great pieces of chocolate, coconut, and pecans in every bite... you really can't go wrong! Not as greasy as a similar recipe I made last week (chewy coconut cookies--which are yummy too!), so I appreciated that. They are a little scraggly looking, which I actually really like! Coworkers love me today!! =)

What a delicious cookie!  I made them exactly as written and they were very very good. My baking yeilded 46 cookies and they baked for the full 10 minutes. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.   This one is a keeper :o)  Thanks for the great recipe!

These might be my new favorite cookies! I added a whole cup of butter instead of 7/8 of a cup (because I'm lazy like that) and I also skipped the chopped pecans (see earlier lazy comment). These cookies are so addicting! They were pretty hard to mix though, with all the chocolate chips. Seems like I couldn't get them all to stay in the cookie mix!

Gave it five stars because of all the compliments I received.  I almost didnt take them to the party because they spread so much and were greasy.  So I will make these again but will follow advice of previous reviewers and use less butter. And I didnt have any choc chips so I just added an additional cup of chopped pecans and a small handful of dried cranberries.  Cant wait to try them with choc chips.

These cookies were exactly what I was looking for. If you like coconut,chocolate, and pecans together, you will LOVE these. I followed other reviews and only used 3/4 c. butter and they were great. Also, I always use a lttle extra vanilla.

The coconut really makes these cookies something special!  Not to mention the fact that I love anything with pecans.  Anyone who loves cookies will love this recipe!

I have used this recipe several times and always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. The original recipe is fantastic and just perfect. I did try using a heart healthy 50% butter and noticed no difference in taste or quality. 
Update: I recently received a huge bag of macadamia nuts from a friend in Hawaii and decided to use them in this recipe and WOW! They were fantastic!

The first batch of cookies I ever baked from scratch by myself and it came out delicious!  Very easy recipe to follow... Made two batches for family and friends, and will bake another batch this weekend for friends.  Baked with just chocolate chip cookies for kids and they loved them... For husband, baked with chocolate and pecans, and no coconut, as he dislikes coconut. The thought they were very good.   I definitely prefer them with coconuts, pecans and chocolate like the reciple... was the most moist and chewy this way.

These are wonderful cookies.  I ate 3 in a row and wanted more!  I used 3/4 c. real butter.  I also used the 1 c. choc. chips, but did 1 1/2 c. each of the coconut and pecans.  Perfect.  I did have to cook a little longer, probably b/c they were bigger due to the fact I used the pamp. chef medium scoop.  Will defnitely make these again.  Love them!

These are the BEST COOKIES EVER! I have made these cookies several times, and always according to the recipe. There is no need to change anything. They stay chewy... which is great. The whole family loves them. Thank you so much for the best cookie recipe ever.

Since I altered this based on reviews I feel I can only give this a 4.


Used unsalted butter so I kept the salt in the recipe. I changed the sugar to less, added more pecans, pretty finley chopped, chopped my coconut and added about 1/4 cup more. I used dark chocolate since that combo remided me of a Almond joy with the dark chocolate, coconut and nut. First batch was made too large so I made sure from then on to use only my 1 inch scoop and not to use a heaping scoop. Still took 12 minutes. But taste best after they have been sitting for about 30 min. This gives the cookie time to solidify and cool which allows for better tasting of the flavors.

Reall, really good.  I had to lower the temp. to 350 because the bottoms were getting too dark and the tops still raw.  I added a little coconut extract and was very pleased with the results.

Loved this cookie! I did not add the nuts or coconut, but did add butterscotch chips with the milk chocolate chips a cup of each. And I did not have any butter so I used margiren, turned out great. I will use this as a base cookie recipe from now on, people loved them, very easy to make!

These are a five-star for a reason - a definite keeper!  I increased the coconut to 1.5 cups and only used 3/4 c of butter.  EXCELLENT and addictive cookies, so wholesome, comforting and truly homemade.  I love finding a 'winner' like this!

These cookies were so quick and easy, and made my husband say "!" I substituted dried cranberries for the coconut and added white chocolate chips along with the milk chocolate. The only thing I will do different next time is to reduce the butter as others have recommended.

Mm Mmm Mmmm, I had been searching for a similar recipe forever! these cookies are excellent, great texture and they don't flatten out too much, which is always one of my biggest concerns. However when I make these cookies I use peanuts instead of pecans.. everyone at home and at work loves them too!

I don't like peanut butter, and I wanted to make a cookie for my boyfriend that I wouldn't be tempted to eat. I chose this one as it seemed like a really nice combination, and then added 1/4 cup of melted peanut butter. 'Perfection' was his exclamation! I'll definitely be requested to make these again.

didn't alter any of the ingredients. My only suggestion is make sure you use a good quality cookie sheet, or else the cookies come out flat, runny and/or crumbly. those cheap aluminum pans are the death of this great cookie.

A little too sweet so next time I'll use semisweet chocolate chips. They look lovely, however! I upped the baking time to 12 minute because I make my cookies on the larger side.

Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.  This has to be one of the best cookies I've ever tasted.  I didn't change a thing.  I tried them out on five people and all gave them 5 stars!  They are going to love me at the cookie swap at work next week!  :-)

Mmm mmm good.  I just finished baking these and they are wonderful.  I was distracted when I was mixing the ingredients and accidentally only put in 1/2 cup of butter - didn't miss it at all, they are delicious.  I used coconut, dark chocolate chips, peanut butter chips and raisins to make a everything cookie.  Highly recommend this recipe as a base - add whatever you want to.  Thanks!

BAKER BEWARE: I have always scorned my children and husband for eating raw cookie dough because of the eggs, I couldn't help MYSELF with these! I got exactly 24 cookies baked out of this batch after eating several tablespoons of the dough before they were put on the cookie sheet. GREAT recipe! Thanks for sharing, I'll have to add another 15 minutes to each daily workout, because you really can't say no to these cookies!

These cookies are absolutely delicious. My batter made exactly 2 dozen. I omitted the choc. chips and they were still great. I would say this is a keeper, but the amount of butter and sugar is excessive for me. If I could replicate the flavor without the calories, they would be perfect.

These cookies are very tasty and sort of remind me of seven layer bars that I love.  Since I am not really a baker, I was not sure if I was supposed to use sweetened or unsweetened coconut so I ended up using half of each and they turned out great.

Just perfect, wouldn't change a thing other than using semi-sweet choc. chips (I prefer that to milk choc).  Everyone in my family loved these, they were thick & chewy & just filled with great tastes.

They were very simple and quick to make. Although they took a little longer to bake for us, they turned out delicious. We made our cookies a little bigger than 1 inch, so that would be on us.

I followed the recipe exactly and will be using this again as my new base for other chewy cookie combinations in the future, ( I got a bag of dehydrated cranberries and some almonds I think I'll try next time). Only think I'll change is using a cup of butter instead of 7/8. Quick and easy.

I made these cookies for a cookie swap and they were a hit.  Not to brag, but my cookies were the best there. 

I ended up changing the topping a bit and did dark chocolate morsels instead of milk chocolate chips. I also subbed almond slivers for the pecans.  

I think the ratios we're fine. This made large, gooey cookies.

We made these..... the batch made 24 decent sized cookies. Delicious. Will make again. Next time will try to reduce the butter a little bit, as they were a little crumbly... but still very, very good.

Delicious!  Cut down the recipe to 18 servings (it made exactly 36 cookies using my small sized cookie scoop).  The coconut adds a nice flavor and a bit chewier texture and the pecans give another bit of texture.  The hubby said they are "super delicious" and "awesome".  This cookie recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I made this gluten free because I have a celiac daughter.  This was superb!!!!  I followed the recipe as written with the following tips:  I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour (Costco) in place of the all-purpose flour and unsweetened/un-toasted coconut chips (Whole Foods).  I sifted the gluten free flour first, then measured out what I needed.  I  used parchment paper and baked NOT USING MY CONVECTION SETTING, at 375 degrees in the center of the oven.  At this temperature, it will brown a little more than you would normally like, but it cooks the inside (which is always a problem with Gluten Free Cooking), brings out the salty taste perfectly for that sweet/salty dichotomy and toasts the coconut.

These have become our family's new cookie.  My boyfriend and I baked a batch to bring to his families at Christmas and they were gone in a day, we had to bake another batch!  We use white chocolate chips because we think the flavor goes better with the coconut and pecans.  We also use less butter.  Overall, DELICIOUS!

My boyfriend was speechless!  These cookies are moist and flavorful. I used walnuts since I had no pecans.  We're coconut lovers in my house so I replaced half the vanilla extract with coconut extract.  Has anyone tried using coconut oil instead of butter?  Maybe replace half?

I tried these tonight, but didn't have the pecans, so I just left them out.  I think next time I would use unsweetened coconut and maybe a bit less butter.  For 7/8 cup of butter, I just cut two sticks into 4 equal pieces and used 7 of them.  They are delicious!

Absolutely the best cookies ever!  Don't worry about getting everything just right.  I've made them dozens of times, varying the ingredients slightly and they always turn out great.  walnuts are ok, pecans are great.  semi sweet vs milk chocolate, either way they are fantastic.  when making them i actually use a combination of both.  And, I'm a coconut fanatic and always add extra.  Cooking them for the least amount of time does make them slightly crisp on the outside and perfectly soft/chewey in the middle. (8-9 minutes in my oven)  Finally, I never roll them into balls, just dump them on the sheet (on parchment paper) in spoonfuls.

I tried this recipe for the first time the night before a baking contest at work.  Cookies stayed moist, but unfortunately had almost no taste except for the chocolate chips.  Next time I will stick to my no-fail chocolate chip cookie recipe and add coconut, like some other reviewers said.

Delicious cookies. Mine spread more than I would have liked and were much thinner than the ones in the photo. I think next time I will use 3/4 cup butter only and chill them for a while before I form the balls and bake. Thanks!

Awesome cookies! This was a welcomed changed from a regualar chocolate chip cookie.Followed tha recipe  exactly,the only different thing I made was to refigerate the dough for 30 min. before baking.I loved the fact that they don't spread at all(I hate it when my cookies come out flat) also I didn't roll them I just used a measuring tablespoon and just dropped them on the cookie sheet.Thank you Angie Love for sumitting your recipe.

Absolutely delicious cookies. These are so easy to make and even easier to eat! I follow the recipe  (using 3/4 cup of butter, which amounts to a stick and a half) and almost always come out with to die for cookies! For a chewier cookie, I increase the coconut to 1.5 cups, leaving everything else the same. When baking, I bake for about 11 minutes, just until the bottoms begin to brown, and then take them out. I set it aside and let them "cook" on the sheet for another few minutes. They may look a bit undone, but they will cook through and flatten. This way, they stay chewy. I usually freeze half of the batch in aluminum wrap, rounding them out into a log for easy cutting after and they still taste just as good weeks later!! Thank you!

I've made this recipe several times now, shared it w/friends & family & it's always a hit! For flour I use a mix of unbleached a.p. flour & about a 1/4 of the flour called for I use whole wheat. I use aluminum free baking powder, smart balance margarine instead of butter, always pure vanilla extract, & dark chocolate chips with the highest cacao content to make it not only delicious but nutritious! I will definitely make again!

Delicious! I didn't have chocolate chips on hand so I used what I had and that was a baking chocolate bar (60%cocoa). I broke the bar into coarse pieces and increased the sugar buy 1/4 cup and the coconut by 1/4 cup, hoping it would add that extra sweetness. Although they turned out wonderful, I would not recommend using dark chocolate the way I did unless you enjoy a less sweet variation. I would simply follow the recipe as is. Thanks so much!!! They were a hit either way!

rich and sinful cookie! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderfully. I have always love the chocolate chip/coconut combination.  I was excited to try these and they definitely didn't disappoint.  Made exactly 36 cookies but with my family of 5 next time I'll double the recipe so I can freeze some for later.

These are the BEST soft cookies I've ever made!  I've made them 4 times already and keep getting requests to make more!  I did NOT use coconut, chocolate chips or pecans however...instead I chopped up one of those huge bars of TOBLERONE chocolate and added just that to the recipe...the creamyness of the chocolate mixed with the nougat is just to die for! Bake for 8 min (not more) in a preheated oven and let stand for as long as possible after baking...the cookies are actually much tastier the next day...everyone who has had them agrees.  I guess it gives the chocolate time to settle...could DEFINITELY say with confidence they taste like Mrs. Fields cookies the next day....Mmmmmmm.....ENJOY!

Made them today.  Used 3/4 cup butter and substituted rolled oats for the pecans and they are YUMMY!  Will definitely do again!

A favorite amongst my friends... Some changes: I had 1/2 the butter, and 1/2 no sugar added applesauce. I also do not like nuts so I substitute oatmeal. I find it helps to freeze the dough before I bake it to maintain the cookie shape!

These cookies were really good. The only problem I had was that I doubled the recipe and my cookies came out flat. They were still good though. I just baked them a tiny bit more and made them crispy cookies. Everyone loved them! Anyone got any ideas how I can double the recipe without my cookies coming out flat?

Very, very good cookie! I modified it a bit, only because I didn't have all of the ingredients. I used 3/4 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 c. white chocolate chips, 2/3 c. chopped pecans, 1/3 c. sliced almonds, 3/4 c. coconut. Remaining ingredients were the same. They were just the right texture, soft, chewy, not too sweet--PERFECT!

These turned out really good!  I cooked them the full 10 min b/c I had them on stoneware bar pans (not cookie sheets) and I probably could have cooked them a min or two more.  But they're definitely delicious and gooey!

Amazing!  I used 3/4 cup butter and a mixture of dark chocolate and white chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate.  Everyone who tried them raved about them.  My husband says they are the best cookies he has ever eaten.

Delicious! I used 3/4 cup butter which was plenty enough. I also added a 1/3 cup more of chocolate chips and coconut each. They bake in 8 minutes, and they don't flatten out. These are a keeper!

Loved them!  I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing i would do different is add another 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Mine turned out super flat probably because my butter was too warm.  I cooked a dozen last night and the rest of the dough is in the freezer hopefully they all won't turn out flat!

These taste awesome! Such a great twist on chocolate chip cookies. However, I had to add a good 1/4 cup of vegetable oil in order to make the cookie dough managable enough to roll into balls. It was far too dry and flaky.

This was pretty yummy. But far from the best that I felt like it could be. I think there are a few things that could definitely enhance the cookie, maybe a splash of orange liqueur or almond extract? I also would be tempted to add finely chopped dried pineapple, mango, or papaya. But over all the base recipe was pretty tasty on its own. I did have a bit of trouble with the oven temp and cook time. Both my smaller scoops of cookie dough (1.5 TBSP) and double scoops needed longer time at 375. About two for the little ones and 4 for the larger ones. However it could be my oven. Next time I'll take them out a bit later for certain.

these just came out of the oven.. The kitchen smells wonderful! I had to try one, of course, and they are really good! Crispy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside! We didn't have pecans at home, so I just used the coconut flakes and the chocolate chips. Great cookies!

I followed suggestions and used only 3/4 cup of butter, but otherwise, made the recipe as written.  THese were great - chewy, moist, great combination of flavors.  I thought the recipe has plenty of chips, nuts and coconut, no need to increase the amounts.  I cooked mine on parchment paper on cookie sheets and needed a few extra minutes, about 10-12.  I got about 40 medium-sized cookies.

Loved this recipe. I only added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans - perfect amount for me. I love eating these with some milk chocolate frosting spread on the bottom (yes, I have a terrible sweet tooth). Delicious!

I made these cookies on a whim this morning and I think I'll be handing these out at Christmastime! They were wonderful. I followed the recipe to the letter except that I didn't have any chocolate chips (thought I did when I got started) so I chopped up some semi-sweet baking squares into chunks. I think next time I will use chunks again, though not ones I have to chop myself. I also think I will stick with semi-sweet instead of doing milk chocolate like the recipe says. I think that might be too sweet for me.

I made a double batch for a three-family lunch.  I figured it would keep the kids busy during dessert.  Well, the adults polished them off, and I found my friend's husband in my pantry, searching for more!  They were that good.

For what it's worth, I used 15 tbsp. of butter and used dark chocolate chips.  They needed 14 minutes in my oven, but I like my cookies on the crunchier side.  This recipe made 48 cookies. They are a wonderful combination of flavors, much like a chocolate chip cookie. I will make these again!

What a great version of chocaolate chip cookies. My husband usually does not like nuts in cookies. He thought these cookies were very good. The mix of coconut, chocolate chips and pecans were wonderful just the right amount.

These were good, but they just tasted like any other chocolate chip cookie to me. Luckily, I love chocolate chip cookies. I wouldn't mind making them again, but like I said, just tasted like every other chocolate chip cookie I've made. They stayed fairly soft though.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made.  I made them the first time with butter, the second time with margarine.  Equally good!

My kids loved these cookies. I divided the dough and made chocolate chip, chocolate chip&pecan, and chocolate chip with the pecans and coconut. I loved 'em all. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm GOOD.

not quite "the best" so 4 stars, but very good taste. came out looking slightly runny, even after adding more coconut to the last half of the batch.  50/50 if i will make again. maybe i'll try good quality (Lindt?) white choc chunks instead of nestle white chips. this one just might need tweaking.

These are wonderful.  They only thing I changed, was I used semi-sweet chips, it was what I had on hand.  I baked for 10 minutes.  I used my scoop and got 24 nice size cookies, no need to press the dough down they will spread just fine.  Thanks!

These were so good. I like soft cookies and I usually wind up eating cakey cookies, but after making these I realised that what I really liked was the chewiness! These are crisp on the edges and chewy on the insides and not cakey (light or fluffy) at all. 

I accidentally melted the butter before creaming it with the sugar, but then I put the dough in the fridge for a while before baking.

My husband and I enjoyed these cookies. We didn't have any pecans so we made them without. I didn't enjoy the coconut flavor as much as I thought I would, but I really liked the texture, so I will probably use this recipe for regular choc. chip cookies now. I loved how I could roll the dough into balls.

Great cookies. So easy to make and really tasty. I reduced the salt a little since I used salted butter. I also added dried cranberries for a sweet, fruity twist. I didn't have enough pecans, but they turned out fine. I did bake them for only 6 minutes, but it could be my UK oven?! Will certainly make them again!

These are very tasty. They turned out a bit  more fluffy than most cookies I've made in the past. Somewhere between a cookie and a biscut texture. My whole family loves them though. Thank you!

Excellent, even after my goof! I realized too late that I didn't have an egg, so I substituted 1/2 a ripe, medium-sized banana.  The cookies still turned out great. I've also made these a with quick oats and a few tablespoons of ground flax seed in place of equal parts of flour, or used only whole wheat flour.  All have turned out great. This is now our favorite cookie recipe. Thanks!!

These cookies were great!  My older sister devoured them, and she can not stand  coconut!!  

I did cut out most all the salt because I used salted butter. I also used a little bit less butter than what the recipe called for, and upped the coconut, pecans, and chocolate chips by 1/2 cup.

However, for the next time I make them, I will try using more finely chopped coconut for my sister's sake. =)

Really good! I cut the white sugar down to half the amount listed, used macadamias instead of pecans, and used the original listed amounts of coconut and nuts. (omitted choco chips) These took about 14mins to bake for me.

These were fantastic! I didn't have enough vanilla, so I added some vanilla bean from Tahiti, and they were very very good. I also used 3/4 cup of butter and skipped the coconut. Thanks for the recipe!

I was gathering up recipe ideas for my graduation party and I came across this excellent recipe! The only minor ingredient I changed was instead of using milk chocolate chips... I cut up a Hershey bar (you could use kisses too). I love the taste of Hershey in cookies.

My wife said they're the best cookies she's ever had. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but they are pretty good. I actually made them without the chocolate chips (we didn't have any) and used almonds instead of pecans. Was still great, can't wait to try the full recipe. I did have to cook them a bit extra, maybe 15 minutes.

The flavor of this recipe was wonderful, my family really liked it.  However, my cookies came out so flat and super duper thin.  I followed the recipe to a "T" so I'm not sure what went wrong.  I'd love to make them again if I could ensure that they would be thicker/fuller.

EXCELLENT cookies!  They are rich and addictive, and sure to please any palate.  I did adjust the recipe by adding an extra 1/3 c. flour and 1 c. (-2 T.) butter flavored shortening for 9 1/2 minutes. Made 42 cookies.  They looked and tasted delicious.

I made this recipe yesterday after reading all the glowing reviews.  While it is a good recipe, it's definitely not the best cookie I've ever made.  I bake cookies a few times a month and this one ranks in the middle.

These cookies are a revelation! I made a batch as a birthday present for a  co-worker and before wrapping them up I tried one -- a good cook always samples her wares, right? -- and I was shocked. I thought I hated coconut! But these are so much better than any coconut baked good I've had before. 
   Let me describe the experience of eating one of these "treasures":
   First, you taste the cookie part of the cookie. It's warm and delicious: the brown sugar, the vanilla, and the butter (I only used 3/4 cup) make it very rich and surprisingly flavorful. Next, you taste the milk chocolate chips, which are creamy and work really well in this cookie although I'd like to try them using a dark chocolate chip/chunk. And finally, just as you're begining to wonder why you aren't tasting the coconut, that distinctive, sweet, nutty flavor sweeps over you like a warm tropical breeze. My whole world stopped for a moment of pure, delectable joy.
  So, uh, yeah, I highly recommend this recipe. Definitely cut the butter to 3/4 cup and go ahead and toss in the extra 1/2 cup of coconut other reviewers have suggested. I left out the pecans because I forgot to buy them and because I don't care for nuts in my cookies (even cookies I'm baking for other people!)Also, I followed the directions on making 1" balls of dough and my batch yielded 34 cookies. More deliciousness to go around!

These cookies were delicious!!!  I was looking for a recipe to use up some coconut in the pantry and I came upon this one.  Wow!  The only change I made was semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk (I didn't have milk chocolate on hand).  The cookies came out chewy, rich and buttery.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Fantastic!  I slightly overbaked my first tray and slightly underbaked the second but I didn't have to throw out any cookies because they were both great.  I hate hard cookies but I didn't have to worry because these came out nice and soft.  I will definitely be making these again (and again)!

I love chocolate and my husband loves coconut,so I have been looking for a recipe that would have a nice blend of both.This is DEFINITELY it!!I used 3/4 cup of butter as suggested by others,and didn't use the pecans.I also added a couple of extra shakes of coconut.These cookies are hands down the best I have ever made.Great recipe!

These are amazing! Very few cookies made it to the oven (the dough is SO good). Hubby even liked them and he's not a chocolate chip cookie fan. He had 12! Mine were a bit crumbly when I doubled the recipe.

Yum! Thanks for the great recipe. I couldn't find my vanilla extract so I used Almond. Also didn't have any nuts, still delicious. I'll have to try this one again once I get all the ingredients I'm sure they'll be even better!!

Ok, these were flippin awesome! I added macademia pieces and a mixture of white, semi sweet and milk choc chips along with the coconut. I couldnt get enough! They are even good popped into the microwave for a few secs later on. I took a batch to some friends and got lots of thanks. Ended up passing on the recipe. I did use less butter like other reviews suggested and they still came out great. Didnt miss the extra butter at all. Yummyliciousness!

These were the best cookies ever!!! I made them without the coconut and they were still AMAZING! They are really adicting. It takes about an hour and 10 min. from start to finish instead of 30. When making them try to have somebody to help you. Because you have to gradually add ingredients to the beater. If I could I would give this a 10 out of 10!!!

Excellent Cookie! This is my new favorite.  Goodbye Toll House.  Finally a cookie that is delicious and perfect and stays chewy inside long after it has been added to the container.  I hate a crisp hard cookie.  This one has a nice crisp edge but is chewy in every other way.  Thank you sooooo much for sharing this recipe.  I made these last night and I can't stay out of them :-D

I doubled the recipe.
It was a little too sweet. Next time I'll use semisweet chocolate chips and if that doesn't do it, I'll cut down on the sugar. I rolled my a little larger and they had to bake longer. Then were a little flatter than I was expecting. But overall, quite nice. My sister thoroughly enjoyed.

These cookies were way too sweet for me.  First let me say that I altered the recipe - maybe thats why I didn't like them. They seem to be a hit with everyone else. I did not use nuts or coconut. And I used semi-sweet chips instead of milk chocolate.  I also used whole wheat.

These cookies had a very granular taste to them. I think they would have been better with more flour to even out the super sugary sweet taste and texture. They did bake well - nice and sort of flattened out and crispy.  They were just way too sweet.  I prefer a milder, chewier chocolate chip cookie.

These are very good cookies.  Very buttery and the brown sugar flavor really shines.  I made them with semi-sweet chips due to a personal preference.  Milk chocolate would have been too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will add 1/2c. more coconut and pecans.

We made these cookies using 1 cup of white and 2/3 cup of wheat flour.  We also used one stick+5 tbsp of butter.  They are wonderful!  My friend says that she doesn't have the words to describe how great the cookies are.  We omitted the coconut because we didn't have any one hand.  They were still great!

DELISH!! I used semi sweet choco chips and the butter measuring is easy if you just take 2 sticks and leave off one tablespoon worth. Only had cashews so I crunched them up and tossed them in the second batch, both were yummy.
Great cookie for the kids just off the bus today! thanks

I'm pretty picky when it comes to baked goods, especially cookies, but these were awesome!  I followed the directions exactly and baked them for about 6-8 minutes.  Be sure to flatten your cookies out a bit or they will end up looking like little balls with a flat bottom.

I'm surprised that more people haven't given this a try! Really good! I made a few changes that worked out well: I used dark chocolate chips as someone had suggested. I also used butter-flavored shortening, which I suppose took some of the density out of it, but it didn't matter! I also substituted a tiny, tiny bit of the egg white with some evaporated milk. A keeper! Thanks!
