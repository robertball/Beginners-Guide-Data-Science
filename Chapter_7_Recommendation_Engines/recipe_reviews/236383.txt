Yum, what a treat! This is such a cute idea for Saint Patrick's Day, and goes beyond green milk in the cereal for the kids.  It's an easy and simple recipe, but its sweet and salty flavors will make everyone happy.

Yummy and simple. My husband thought they were too sweet, but I LOVED the combination of sweet and salty. I think the milk should be cut in half to make the frosting not too runny. And, my preference is for only 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Otherwise, this is the perfect fix for "boring ol' pound cake."

The finished product was excellent, however the time listed to make it (15 minutes) was not even close......I was hoping for something quick to make but that didn't happen.  It took closer to a hour to dip all the cubes of cake, then I ran out of frosting and nuts part way through.  So if you plan to make this, double the quantity for the frosting and nuts.

pretty close recipe to my mother's - except she made a white cake & ground Spanish peanuts (rather than dry roasted) in her meat grinder for topping! ;)

Soooo yummy! However I did use a homemade pound cake with a touch of lemon in it. It makes the dough taste like a doughnut after they are coated. Secondly I used salted honey roasted peanuts, makes the sweet and salty ratio balance. I also put green food coloring in one batch of icing. It made it looks so festive and moss like!  Lastly, this recipe way underestimates the amount of icing and crushed peanuts you will need. I had to triple mine, but I coated them very well. This recipe also does not say to refrigerate  anything. However i refrigerated the pound cake until completely cooled before cubing and i refrigerated the finished blarney stones when i was done coating them so they could set up overnight. After that it is ok to leave them out as long as it is not too hot. Enjoy!

I love the sweet and salty flavors in this little dessert. I followed directions except I added only about half the milk to the confectioner's sugar. It was still very wet and coated the cake squares so that the peanuts would stick. This was surprisingly light, moist, and delicious!

Wasn’t that pleased as the powered sugar didn’t harden up like I thought. Also I used crushed pecans instead of peanuts - however they would not stick.

Simple to make. Went over great at the Saint Patrick's day potluck.
