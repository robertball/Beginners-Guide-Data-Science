This was amazing!! Made for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I did make my own crust but didn't change anything and it turned out great.

I made this 3 times over the holidays with both wheat based crust & gluten free...every one loved it. It's a little softer than I'm used to but it contrasted nicely with the crunch of the pecans
