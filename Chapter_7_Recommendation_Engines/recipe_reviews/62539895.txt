The cake had a thick, moist consistency and a light sweet taste (I used Splenda Blend in place of the sugar.).  The lemon icing gave it an extra zing of lemon.  I really enjoyed it.   I used a silicone Bundt pan so it took an extra 10 minutes to fully cook in my oven.  Definitely watch it during the finial baking minutes.
