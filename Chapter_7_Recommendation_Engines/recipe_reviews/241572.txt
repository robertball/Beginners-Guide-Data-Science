I marinade the ham for several hours & left in the refrigerator before cooking it.  I tasted it after an hour of being in the oven & I became worry bc I didn't like.... But after letting it cook as it states, it turned out delicious!  I received positive comments from the family & we finished it all! Thank you for the help.

Used this glaze to add a bit more pizzazz to some turkey ham I bought. Cut the recipe to 2 servings and spooned over slices before microwaving. Added a lot of flavor and I preferred next to a brown sugar glaze.

So simple and easy to follow. I covered mine with foil for the first 1 hr 15 min, it was so moist and tasty.

I was very pleased with the comments from my guests. I even got a request for the recipe!  Made as the recipe. Then made a bean soup with the bone (form another of your recipes).
