5 star recipe with the follwing modifications.  I used 8 oz of smoked gouda and about 5 oz of sharp cheddar.  I reduced the amount of milk to 1 and 1/2 cups.  I also added a liberal amount of garlic salt.  This resulted in a very cheesy sauce and a delicious taste.  The gouda is quite strong and next time I may reduce the amount of gouda and increase the amount of cheddar.  Also topped with bread crumbs.

I had a wine & cheese party a few days before making this & used this recipe as a GREAT use for my left over cheeses. I not only used smoked gouda, i used jalapeno havarti & marble cheddar. The key to this recipe is to make your base of the sauce w/ the milk & butter & then keep adding whatever cheese you want to use until the sause is cheesy enough for your taste. I also added a pinch of cayenne & red pepper flakes to kick it up a little.i used probably double of what the recipe called for but I like it really smooth & cheesy, it wasn't bland, it was yummy, would totally make again!

There isn't enough sauce in this recipe.  I would recommend doubling the sauce.  I already doubled the amount of cheese in mine.  The sauce has a good flavor, but there isn't enough of it.  The recipe has potential as a grown up Mac and Cheese though.

Made this to go with our fried chicken dinner on Sunday and it was loved by all! When I make mac and cheese I use a lot more cheese then called for and this was no exception. I used one wedge of smoked gouda and one wedge of plain gouda. While making the roux I also added garlic and onion powders, white pepper and dry mustard. Topped the dish with additional cheese and buttered panko crumbs. Awesome and thank you!

This recipe is great, but I added a few things I saw in some gouda mac and cheese at a restaurant: 1 shallot sliced, ham slivered, chives to garnish, and 1 whole head of roasted garlic. It really punched up the flavor and made it absolutely fantastic.

Just made this today.  We loved it.  I have to admit I am not a measurer, but essentially do follow the recommendations.  I used smoked gouda and some raclette cheese (french melting cheese) which is mild and adds a lot of creaminess. I also tossed in cream cheese, about 4 oz.  Here's where I made this AWESOME - I added some crisp bacon to the top.  OMG! This was good, I felt like I needed a cigarette afterwards.

Absolutely excellent, even my fussy 3 and 5 years kids loved it.  Also very easy to make.

I tried this recipe and ended up doubling the amount of Gouda and cutting the amount of noodles in half, and that was almost perfect.  All in all, it was good for something unique but I wouldn't have it more then once a month because the flavor is rather strong.

Gouda flavor was barely present, sauce was very soupy. This would be tastier with a more aged gouda than the variety available in my grocery. I will not make this again.

Excellelnt mac and cheese with a few adjustments.  I added 2 more ozs. of gouda, 8 ozs. of extra sharp cheddar and 1/4 cup of 1/2 and 1/2.  I also toasted panko breadcrumbs with 2 tbls of butter and a sprinkle of garlic salt.  I topped the macaroni with the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese before baking.

As Mac and Cheese goes, it is a good recipe.  I did not like the gouda with the pasta, kind of bland.  I will try it again and use a sharp cheddar. Maybe bread crumbs on top with shredded Gouda.

mmmmmm! Creamy, smoky, cheese stringy goodness. I used tri-colour pasta and added some mixed frozen veggies, because that's my idea of "fun". I also kicked it up a bit with paprika and onion salt. The only problem I have is that it might be too rich for me! It's a nice take on a lowbrow recipe with a highbrow ingredient :)

VARIATION: I made this with pureed broccoli & cooked chicken, in which case you need to only use about 1 c. milk to account for the additional water in those ingredients. Also, I would recommend using 6 oz of gouda and topping the dish with shredded cheddar. The recipe does not mention to cook this UNCOVERED in the oven, to brown the top. ENJOY! My kids all loved this, from my vegetarian (snuck the chicken in) to my veggie hater (couldn't pick out the broccoli)!!!

I will not make this again.  I increased the amount of sauce slightly, because I like a creamier mac and cheese, and more than doubled the amount of cheese called for, and the gouda flavor was barely noticeable.  This dish was dry and lacking in the flavor department.  A disappointment.

It was okay.  But I would not spend the time making it again.   I added much more cheese than it called for too and it was still bland.  Sorry :-(

Definitely not enough sauce, and even with 8 oz. of smoked gouda, not enough gouda flavor.  I'd suggest either cutting the pasta in half, or doubling the sauce and using more gouda.

This was a yummy recipe. I used 2 tbsp butter & 2 tbsp flour, and 2 cups warmed milk. I used 8oz of maccaroni pasta and 2 cups of jalapeno havarti. It was creamy. I didn't add the salt or pepper because of the type of cheese I used. Not a bite leftover. Served along with broiled tomatoes & tossed green salad.

This is a great recipe, my new favorite! It's so simple and straightforward to make.  I added Fontina with the Gouda and it came out great.

Delicious, however I would increase the gouda to 5 ozs (I love cheese!). Relatively easy to make for a "cook-a-phobe" such as myself.

Gouda does not melt very easily so do shred well. I added powdered mustard for some zing, cheddar and Parmegean cheese to tone down the Gouda cheese. Added more flour to thicken up the milk, so I would reduce the amount of milk to 1.5 cups. Different spin on Mac & Cheese made this dish good.

I made this exactly to specifications. I may never eat regular mac and cheese again. I mean it was delicious. The only thing I can say is that I would have like it to be a tad more creamy but otherwise AWESOME!

Not my favorite Mac and Cheese. Just as others mention, you will want to add more cheese and cut down the milk. When I first read this recipe, I thought it needed ham or bacon which I had neither. Luckily, I had some bacon in the morning and still had the bacon grease, so I used it in sub of butter. I also added Smoked Paprika and onion. In the end this Mac and Cheese didn't cut it compared to others I've made in the past. I think Gouda is not a powerful enough cheese to stand alone, so I used Extra Sharp White Cheddar with it, but it still was a bit lack luster. If I make it again, I would add sausage, ham or bacon and add some kind of veggie. Broccoli or roasted Butternut Squash.

A good idea, with a few modifications. I added about 8 oz cheddar and 1/4 tsp dry mustard, and we all loved that version.

Really pretty good recipe!  I would echo what others have said: add more cheese, add less (or sub H&H) milk.  I do 7 oz. smoked gouda, 1-2 oz. of asiago, and 2 cups of whole milk.  I think that the asiago adds an intriguing bite while also muddling the smoke flavor (my wife is not a big fan of smoked anything).  I also add bread crumbs and parmesan topping, but that is just my preference for homemade mac & cheese.

Really good. I think mac and cheese is more of a method really. You may need to add more or less milk. The rue doesn't get as thick as it is going to get until after it boils. so if it is too thick add more milk.

A pretty good recipe.  Watch the cooking time, though.  It can get a little dry.

Okay, I'm giving this recipe three stars because I don't think it's fair to give a recipe five stars if you've made major adjustments to it. That being said, I think it's a good base, and the advice from several people on here is very good.

First thing, though, there's not nearly enough cheese. I used 8 oz of gouda and 4-5 oz of sharp cheddar and I could barely taste it. I'm planning on doing 16 oz of gouda next time.

With my adjustments, I was trying to recreate the new mac and cheese at Outback steakhouse, which has this amazing garlic bite. I used the same amount of milk, flour, butter, pasta, etc. that the recipe called for, but mostly added things to change the flavor. So, I added 1 whole head of roasted garlic (pureed in the food processor) and 1 minced scallion, which I sautéed (after burning the first one trying to roast it.) Actually, while present, the garlic flavor didn't have that amazing zap to it that it has at Outback. I might even do two heads next time (although I'll add it slowly.) I also didn't add the cheese slowly enough when making the sauce, so it was a little gritty from fine pieces of cheese that didn't get melted. 

Those are the adjustments I made. Hope it works out for you!

Best bake mac cheese that doesn't clump up and gets grainy. I parboil my pasta only 4 minutes and let it finish cooking in the oven covered with foil for 15 to 20min. Pasta isn't mushy or dried up this way. I use this as my base when I want to make a tex-mex mac and cheese with leftover burrito/taco filling.

I made this for supper tonight - pretty good!  As did others, I also tweaked. I used 8 oz. shell mac, 8 oz. smoked gouda, 5 oz. extra sharp cheddar (we love cheese!), 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp. garlic salt and only 2 c. milk. I also topped it with 6 TB panko breadcrumbs mixed with 2TB melted butter and 6-8 slices chopped, cooked, bacon. Because of the extra cheese it did get a little "grainy" in texture but the flavor was awesome! Next time I will try using regular gouda and smoked cheddar - just for a little twist. Yep, we're lucky here - we don't live far from a fresh cheese and dairy shop so the combination of cheeses I can try is almost unlimited.

hits the spot for warm comfort food!  I kept all the proportions the same but added 7oz of cheese instead of the 4oz called for in the recipe.  I also put in about a tablespoon of dijon mustard to add a little flavor.  Overall, this is a very quick and easy recipe and one that is easy to play around to make variations

Loved this recipe.  I did make some changes based on other suggestions, like doubling the cheese sauce, which was a must.  I also added some mixed veggies for colour, and paprika to the sauce for flavour.  Also gave it a light sprinkling of breadcrumbs before popping it in the oven.  Loved it.

Very good, lighter than cheddar mac and cheese.  But I'd try it again with more gouda, since it is so light, sometimes there was barely any on the pasta.

Great use of gouda! A nice recipe that is not too heavy on the cheese. I prefer using plain gouda instead of smoked and only use 2/3 of the pasta.  I also added bread crumbs to the top.

My family loves this recipe! I've tweeked it a little bit, I use about a cup and a half of light cream instead of the milk (I found the sauce too soupy) and I also add a little bit of chili pepper. This adds to the smokey taste and also gives it a bit of a kick. A few bread crumbs on top and you're good to go.   I also have a friend to loves this recipe but just found out she has a gluten allergy so I made this with rice noodles and it was just as good and healthier!

VERY VERY Rich - great flavor, but reheated wasn't so great.  3 stars just because I couldn't eat much of it with the richness and not liking reheated.  My husband loved it, though.

I added some garlic and onion powder and it ended up being one of my favorite dishes.  One recommendation:  add vegetables such as broccoli to keep from feeling so bad about eating all this starch and cheese :)

Very good. I used around 6 oz. smoked Gouda. I also added 2 cloves of fresh diced garlic and 1 diced shallot while the butter was melting. Coated with a little pepper and garlic salt; it turned out perfect!

Despite the iffy reviews, I decided to give this one a shot anyways since I was intrigued by the addition of gouda cheese. I halved the recipe since it was just going to be eaten by myself and my boyfriend (and we are trying to eat healthy). I cheated and made a few modifications: I used 2 oz. smoked gouda, 1/4 cup shredded swiss, and 1/4 c. fat-free shredded cheddar along with medium shell pasta. Cooked and baked as directed. It turned out well..kind of dry, since I used skim milk, but once I topped it with a bit of grated parmesan, it was pretty good. Not the creamy, decadent mac n cheese I love, but flavorful nonetheless. I'll probably make it again and experiment with different cheeses.

I used 6 oz smoked gouda & 8 oz sharp cheddar cheese, very nice combo. I added a sprinkle of garlic powder and paprika to the sauce mixture before adding the cheese. I used regular pepper instead of white and didn't add any salt, the cheese is salty enough. I used 1.5 cups milk. Definitely cover with foil while baking so it doesn't dry out.

Great recipe!! I doubled it to make a large batch. There was quite a bit of milk and the sauce wasn't getting thick enough so I had to make another roux to add to it. I used a whole block of gouda to make it really cheesy and added some crumbled bacon on the top. It was delicious!!! For those who think it's bland try adding the bacon. I highly recommend it!

Wow, this was really tasty! I read through the recommendations for tweaks before I made it myself. I ended up using about 3/4 of a 16- ounce box of pasta, 4 oz smoked gouda, and (guesstimating bc I already had it shredded in my fridge) about 6-8 oz of sharp white cheddar cheese. I cut the milk to 1 1/2 cups, but I think that was too little. Either 2 cups or the originally called for 2 1/2 cups milk would be better for the proportions I used. (Cheesy sauce ended up a little too thick/clumpy, but it didn't hurt the taste at all.) I used 1 tspn of sea salt and added a pinch of ground mustard and paprika each but otherwise followed the original recipe. Sooo good! Nice comfort food dish and the smoked gouda flavor was juuuust right.

I was craving Mac & Cheese with smoked Gouda and therefore found this recipe.  Delicious but I added few different items such as white cheddar, garlic and topped it all with extra Gouda and a mixture of butter and panko bread crumbs.  Very happy with my results.  Thanks All Recipes once again for helping a girl out.

Followed recipe exactly and my milk mixture never firmed up.  Finally took a scoop of the mixture in another bowl and mixed in a spoonful of corn starch to make a slurry, then added back to the bigger pot and the mixture firmed up quickly.  I doubled the amount of gouda the recipe called for and it still wasn't very cheesy and couldn't really taste the smoked gouda.  Was disappointed, probably won't make again.

Absolutely delicious! We modified the recipe by adding bacon and hot Rotel to the mixture as well as doubling the amount of cheese. Yummy!

I read all of the reviews before making this. I was so on the fence because it seemed people either liked it or didn't. However, I did make modifications to it after trying the sauce exactly as the recipe stated. I doubled the sauce and added of tsp of mustard powder, onion powder, garlic powder. I also added a bit of parmesan in my cheese.

This recipe is ok. It needs more milk to over the pasta and I used just regular gouda, not smoked. I wouldn't make this recipe again.

So yummy! I don't usually like smoked gouda but found myself with a slab so I found this recipe. Best mac and cheese I've ever made! I slowly sauteed a little minced onion in the butter before adding the flour and used some aged sharp cheddar as well as the gouda. Topped w/ bread crumbs and asiago before baking. I don't normally have cow's milk so I used some half and half and mostly cashew milk. Also added chopped cauliflower to noodles for last few minutes of cooking time. Wish I'd had some broccoli to add too. This is going to become my new mac and cheese recipe for sure!

I made this as specified but doubled the sauce as someone else mentioned that there wasn't enough sauce.  I wish I had doubled the cheese as mentioned by others or reduced the amount of milk.  I found the sauce to be very thin and it did not coat the pasta very well, although there was more than enough sauce with double the recipe.

My son just asked me to remember this recipe so I can make it again!  I added leftover chicken and it was very popular.  I too added a bit more gouda, probably another whole cup.   Excellent flavor.  This recipe is great for a base to then get creative with.....I will definitely do this again and probably add other things to the mix.

I LOVE smoked gouda and I love mac & cheese and a recide for gouda mac & cheese was hard to resist. This recipe is good but I recommend you use 2 times the amount of sauce to make it more cheesy.

This thing needs a lot more cheese and less milk.  I also didn't have any white pepper so I used black pepper instead, hopefully the white pepper is what makes it good, because I'm eating it now and wishing I had made something else.

I had high hopes for this one, but it just didn't work out. I think something was wrong with the proportions, because the sauce was too thin even after I tried to remedy it with some cornstarch. I was disappointed since I was really looking forward to delicious results! Next time I'll stick with my trusted standby mac n cheese recipe.
