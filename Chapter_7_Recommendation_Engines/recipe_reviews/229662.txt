This was great!  I was worried about the dressing, it did turn out really wet, but the taste was very good.  The way I fixed the problem with the wet dressing was to put into a dish and put it the oven at 350.  It took about 20 minutes.

This recipe sure did not work out for me. My turkey breast was just a little over 6 pounds, I have a 7-qt crockpot so I should have had plenty of room. The turkey breast was still raw on top after 4.5 hours, and the stuffing  was dreadful, burned on the bottom.  I ended up getting out my roasting pan so I could get the turkey cooked.

Great way to cook the turkey breast.  Turned out nice and moist. You do not get the pretty brown skin on the turkey but I just didn't let anyone see it before I carved it. The stuffing is too moist when you take out the turkey but I added about 1/4 of a bag of more stuffing bread cubes and put it in the oven with my other casseroles for 30 minutes and it was perfect - VERY tasty.

I made a few changes after reading the reviews. 1st off, I left out the whole cranberries. I like to have mine cold on the side. 2nd, I used turkey tenderloins, about 1.5 lbs. next time, I intend to season more, turkey was a bit bland. I used enough chicken stock to moisten stuffing bread cubes, not just 1/2 cup. Plus, I used 3/4 stick butter, instead of whole, just because that is what I had on hand. Only needed to cook on low for 3 hours, then 1/2 hour on high. Put gravy over it and it was wonderful.

I’ve now made this twice. Second time used two boxes of Turkey Stovetop Stuffing and that resolved runny dressing issue. Only used 1 large onion (instead of 1.5), and did not add salt since I thought dressing mix would cover that. Used 2.5 lbs of boneless turkey tenderloin. Put a base of 3 celery sticks, then added turkey, then combined dressing and all extras and spooned around edge of turkey. Covered and Cooked on low for 5 hours. Feeds 4 fully with some leftovers.

I used  box of stove  top and eliminated the cranberry sauce (yuk.)  This recipe was so easy and delish.  It was done on high at 3 hours and 50 minutes.  I was impressed.  The next time, I think, I'll cook it on low. I also let the dressing sit in a strainer for awhile before putting it in the oven.  It was so tasty.

I made this using Pepperidge farm cornbread dressing added a half cup of chicken livers chopped fine and sautéed with butter onion and celery. Then I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS, people are complaining about the dressing being wet or too moist and them having to “fix it” by baking it more in the oven...that is what the recipe says to do. Thank you for taking the time to add the recipe.

This was pretty good.  I hardly ever use my slow cooker but decided to give this a try.  I didn't care much for the stuffing mix because it got pretty mushy, but the turkey itself was pretty good.  I think it's a great way for a busy cook to get dinner ready since it is easy to put together in a hurry.  Thanks for this idea!

This was certainly a unique meal.  My husband made this for us on Christmas Day.  We weren't for sure how it would turn out because of the cranberry sauce, but we were pleasantly surprised with the flavor.  We had to cut some of the breast to get it to fit into the slow cooker.  Also, the dressing turned out to be gravy because of how moist it was, but it was delicious gravy.  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious slow cooker recipe! I couldn't find a bone-in turkey breast, so I had to use a Butterball turkey "roast." Those come with a gravy pouch, so I poured the gravy over the meat before cooking. Very flavorful and satisfying meal for my family.
