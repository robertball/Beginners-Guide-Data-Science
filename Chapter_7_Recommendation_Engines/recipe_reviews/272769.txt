This is SO good, easy to make and full of flavor! I recommend browning the meat in batches, otherwise the pot is too crowded and the meat tends to steam. All I needed to add was a bit of salt at the end.  If you don't want your veggies too soft, I suggest you cook the meat for 20-25 minutes under pressure, add in the veggies, then finish cooking for 10-15 more minutes. There was no indication on how to prepare the potatoes, so I peeled them and cut them into 1.5" chunks.  The beef comes out so tender. This has the perfect amount of heat, not overly spicy at all. I garnished with some minced cilantro. Perfect!

Absolutely delicious!!!  The amount of flavor will depend on the type and quality of your curry mix.  I only had one 13.5oz can of the tomato's so for the remaining liquid I used a can of coconut milk which was fabulous.

Flavor was excellent.... but I'm not a fan of beef stew meat because no matter what it seems chewy or tough.

I prefer using beef shank which I will use in the future when I make this.

Oh so good. I don’t have an instapot so I made it right on top of the stove and it turned out perfect!! Didn’t cook the beef all the way cause I knew it would cook while it was simmering and it was so tender!!! Will make again!!!

I made this Spicy Beef Curry Stew and it was almost a 5 star winner but  I could hardly taste the curry. . .followed the recipe to the ounce but I guess I expected more curry flavor.  All-in-all the stew came out very good and I will make it again.

This had a delicious flavor but I think 4T curry powder was a bit too much for me and husband. The texture of the meat was perfect! It’s definitely a keeper, but cutting down on the curry next time and adding more fresh ginger! Thanks for posting this ??
