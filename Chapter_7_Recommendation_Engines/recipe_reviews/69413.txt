I love the combination of the spices the only thing I did different was omited the salt and marinated the chops overnight and then seasoned them before cooking; as the salt tends to draw out the moisture if you salt them overnight and they become dry.

I knew I would love these chops, I just love coriander and cumin! I was concerned it would be too flavourful for my children...but they LOVED it too! I prepared them exactly as directed, even though I am leary of pan frying meat. Next time I may try it on the bbq. I wonder how this would work on a tenderloin...maybe I'll try that too! Thanks Darla!

One of the best pork chop recipes I have tried.  The taste grabbed my attention and the simplicity and time involved made it a winner.  I made curried potatoes on the side and went to bed happy.  Thanks for the recipe...great job.

I had a pork loin and not chops, so I rubbed the ingredients on the loin, substituting onion powder for garlic since I was out of garlic. I baked it in a covered roaster with some water and 3 beef bouillion cubes in the bottom to make gravy. It was wonderful!

This also works really well on the BBQ.
I added a half of a dried chipotle pepper to this and ground all the spices and garlic in amortar and pestle. Tasted GREAT!!

I'm giving this a three b/c I'm sure it is a very good recipe for those who like Coriander. I had never tried Coriander before and I now know that I absolutely can't handle it.  It is very pungent!!!  Thank you for the recipe...I'm sure it's great for people who like this spice, just not for me.

This smelled absolutely divine while I was making it. I didn't make a paste by adding the oil to the spice mix, though. Rather, I just made a dry spice rub, and added 1 tsp. garam masala to the mix, then added the extra oil to the pan.  Unfortunately, my family was late for dinner, so I had to keep these on warm stand-by, and the chops dried out.  I served them with mashed potatoes seasoned with yellow curry powder, garlic powder and a touch of red pepper flakes, and a side of steamed cauliflower.  It made a nice pseudo-Indian meal.

Very simple and delicious.  Based on previous reviews I only used a pinch of salt.  We really enjoyed the flavor, but the chops ended up on the dry side.  I will try braising the chops in chicken broth next time to see if I can retain more tenderness.

I liked this and my guy LOVED it - he told me four times!!!  It definitely has Indian flavors and it went great with a potato dish on this site called Aloo Phujia.  Also great and easy to make.  Thanks submitter.

We put these on the grill (5-7 minutes each side)and they were delicious.  I didn't add salt used a little less coriander and some dehydrated onions.  I applied the rub on the chops about an hour before putting them on grill.  Everyone loved them!

I made this exactly as stated and it came out really good.  This is a quick, simple pork rub and it goes really well with Basmati rice.  One side note:  as listed it's a bit too salty for me, but next time I will reduce the salt to half.  ** Really nice, basic recipe that you can throw together in a pinch.  A keeper!

WOW! I almost didn't make this because I didn't have ground coriander, but I did have some fresh frozen leafy coriander (same as cilantro) that I decided to substitute, instead. It was soooo good! My husband has never liked pork chops when I cook them (says they're too dry and not much taste), but commented immediately on these being good.  And they're really easy! My only mistake was serving with spanish rice; too many spices to be complimentary together. Recommend to serve with something rather mild, so you can appreciate the pork's flavor. I've never commented on this site, but just had to rave about this....

Nice flavor!  I actually had these rubbed and sitting in the fridge to cook that night, but we ended up going out to eat.  When I cooked them the next day, they were awesome.  The falvor was soaked all through.  I would recommend letting them sit overnight as I made them again, without letting them sit, and the flavor was not as good.

This was alright, nothing really *wrong* with it, but we didn't love it. We ate it but probably won't make again. Thanks for the recipe to try!

It took longer than ten minutes for the chops to cook completely, but I didn't mind a few extra minutes when I tasted them.

None of my five family members,(me included), liked this recipe at all. As an experienced and extremely diversified cook, I always try to follow the recipe exactly the first time I try it, then make adjustments as I see fit. This was no different, other than I held back on the salt. You can always add salt. None of us found anything appealing about this recipe and none of us finished our portions. The flavors just didn't blend well for us. On to the next one!

Fast, easy, and delicious!  I like the previous reviewer's idea to just make a spice rub, not using the oil to make a paste.  And use less salt.

I really liked this but agree with reviewers, you should scrape off the excess paste before cooking - I marinated all day and then I grilled them. I added some ginger and chili powder because I like maximum flavour. Yummy and moist. Thanks!

I doubled the rub and put it on a 1 lb. pork tenderloin.  There wasn't really a need to double it. I marinated overnight and it was tasty. I did squeeze a lot of rub off as it came out of the bag. Leaving all of it on would have made it pasty.

pretty good. used jar mince garlic instead of fresh (just as good, less hassle) but didnt have enough to equal 3 cloves so i just used what i had and dumped some garlic powder in.  fried them in vegetable oil instead of olive.  low on olive oil so want to conserve what i have till i get more.  only complaint, and its not much of one is the spices make it kind of mealy textured... but nothing i cant handle.  very easy to fix and really flavorful. served with asparagus cuts and macaroni and cheese.  prep to finish was very fast, though i cook mine a bit slower so as to not burn it on my temperamental stove.  and i love that its a recipe for only 2 people, most recipes on here are to feed a whole family.  finally one i dont have to scale down! lol

I used sea salt and fresh ground pepper and I did add a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powders. Simple enough for something I was just throwing together out of simple pantry ingredients. The boys ate every bite. I served this with Brown Rice (from this site, which is also known as Oven Brown Rice) and steamed veggies. Great, simple boy-friendly dinner.

I do not give 5 stars lightly, but when you combine the simplicity of this recipe with the outcome -- this one really does deserve it!
I was worried as I made it because it smelled so strong, but the end result was perfect!  Bravo!

Never posted anything about a recipe before , but these were so suprisingly good, I had too.  Very simple to make and even my four year old gobbled them up.  I thought he wouldn't like the flavor.  I didn't change anything.  I served it with roasted cauliflower and it went perfectly.

A good and simple recipe.  The only thing I found was that it was salty.  I would cut back on the amount given in the recipe and salt by taste as the pepper is listed.

Very good recipe, but WAY too salty for this family... Next time, I'll literally try with HALF the salt. I cooked the chops as suggested and they were very tender.

Big hit. Our pork chops were too thick and after cooking in the skillet, we transferred the chops to the oven and baked them for awhile. Followed other reviewer and made with Aloo Pajlia - perfect!

Very good pork rub. Just to let people know, I used this on a pork rib roast and grilled it for almost 3 hours over indirect heat on our charcoal grill. It was beyond fabulious and made the first roast I've ever cooked an instant classic!

I made this last night with the garden green beans from this site last night and it was delicious! The only change I made was I cut the salt in half per the recommendations of other reviewers.  I would make it exactly the same the next time I make it ... and I WILL make it again!

Loved the flavor—a little bit Indian, a little bit Mexican, and a whole lotta delicious for such a short contact time. We cooked them on the grill and shared them with the guys helping us build a garage. They were all: "How long did you marinate this?" "No way!" and " You should sell these, on a stick, at the fair!"

Great payoff for so little effort. Tasted so flavorful -- even though I forgot the garlic! Didn't bother making a paste, using the spices as a dry rub instead on bone-in chops that I had patted dry.

Fantastic! In my opinion, cumin and coriander are very underused. So many people don't venture further than garlic, salt and pepper. They don't know what they're missing. The chops had such a delightful taste. You can use both of these spices liberally and not worry. I also used fresh garlic that I smashed up. Thanks for posting the recipe. (I used boneless chops)

Good!  Great flavour, my only complaint was that the paste made it so the pork chops had a slight chalky texture, and while it wasn't entirely unpleasant, I'd prefer a smoother mouthfeel.

The seasoning was perfect. I used thicker boneless pork ribs and cooked them in the pan with olive oil for 5 minutes per side, then baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Pork came out nice and tender. Will definitely make again.

Was not a big fan of this one, the spices was a bit too strong on it's own, so I created a sauce to go with it and boiled the chops to let some of the spices combine with the sauce which came out real well. I used a mixture of heavy cream and tomato sauce with a tablespoon of plain yogurt. Now it goes great with rice too.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I doubled the recipe and rubbed on a pork roast.  Then put the roast in the smoker for 6 hours.  The best meat I have every tasted.

This was a really good recipe. I gave it 5 stars because I followed the recipe exactly an it was wonderful. Usually I have to make adjustments and additions, but this is good as is. I served the pork chops with curried potatoes (my own recipe) and whole wheat pita bread. I will definitely be making this one again in the near future.

We loved this. I've made it twice now. I didn't have ground coriander so I used the whole kernals- and it was great. A whole tablespoon is actually too much that way, but I think half a tablespoon is perfect. The kernals add something fun and interesting to the dish. I would recommend serving it was a sweet cream corn or something of the like- because it is a very savory dish.

We love this recipe in my house! It is SO good if you like coriander and cumin.  Just omit the salt or it gets to be too much. You really don't need it with both spices.

I really enjoyed these, and my husband, who doesn't usually like pork chops liked them as well because of the flavor.

I cut salt to 1/4 tsp. and added to the rub 1/2 tsp Dried Chilpolte Peppers and 3/4 tsp Garam Masala, which meant I had to add a little bit more oil to make the paste.

I applied the rub and left them in the fridge for an hour before cooking. Now my only problem is I'm not great at judging when meat is done and they were slightly overcooked (but not bad).  

I think this will be a great barbeque recipe!

Thanks again!

yummy~ I love this. they are so quick and easy. i served them on a lightly piece of toast with light mayo and made open faced sandwiches with mine. the flavor is so good, thank God I took the advice of others and only used a pinch of salt on each because otherwise they would have been way too salty, but i give this 5 stars.

We liked this recipe. The spices blended very well (I never used coriander before). Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was delicious alright, but I imagined it would have a more robust flavor. I served it with lemon parmesan orzo and cheesy california veggies.  I wonder if I put some beef bullion in to the pan, if it would have given me the flavor I was looking for.   Still, I have no regrets.

The recipe was just... meh. I followed the instructions exactly and make it twice (the second time with brand new spices since I was concerned my coriander was too old the first time), and it just didn't do anything for me or my other half.

meh, It was edible. Used recipe from the magazine. Either my electric stove is not working right or the magazine's idea of medium temperature is high. Magazine said one inch thick chops cooked in 3-4 minutes per side.
I cooked mine 5 minutes per side and cut one open. PINK in the middle, not cooked pink but raw pink. Not really that easy to find 1 inch thick chops these days, most are only 1/2 inch thick or end up being butterflied to 1/2 inch thickness.

I got this recipe out of the Allrecipes sample magazine that came with my Better Homes and Garden. I made it for my husband tonight. He usually puts some kind of sauce on the meat, but with this he ate it as is. So I have to give this recipe a great rating. I didn't add anything other ingredients to it. I will make it again for him.

Good!  barbecued it up in 10 minutes- marinated or 2 hours ,used less salt -my preference, made brown rice and completed meal with a salad, husband put his on a tortilla with rice and salsa.  Next time  after cooking, I  will put the pork in tomatillo sauce (home made) and serve in tortilla with rice and beans.

I'm rating this a 4 because this one recipe that I wasn't sure if I liked it or I didn't like it. I cooked this about 2 weeks ago and I'm still unsure. Maybe tone down the spices? Made recipe exactly as is.

I did not love this, it was "meh" when I was expecting "wow". I thought because of the spices (which I love them both) it made the pork really grainy. I did not get the intense flavor I was expecting. It wasn't terrible, just not fab.

Pretty good, but I'd probably only use 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil to cook them in.  I also had some trouble getting the spice mixture to stick to the chops, but I'm not sure what I'd do differently to fix that.  My pork chops were a little thin and were overdone at 5 minutes per side.

Very delicious. Since I typically start my work day in the afternoon, I made this dish for me and my roommate in the morning. We both loved it and I can't wait to try it on the grill in the summer. Two stars for the way our apartment smelled after I prepared this dish! Thanks Darla!

What can you say about a recipe that is fast and easy and you are sure to have all of the ingredients on hand? This is a perfect little recipe!  Took less than a minute to get together and another minute to spread on the boneless cutlets.  I let them sit while I waited for my husband to arrive and then pan fried them up.  He really is not enthusiastic about pork, but he liked this and I will definitely save the recipe.

My wife said that it was the best pork chop she ever tasted.  We did not have coriander on hand, which I know changes it significantly.  I used creole seasoning about 1 tsp of chili seasoning.  After frying I served the chops on a bed of chopped tomato and topped the chops with guacamole.  Perfect.

I cant cook to save my life. Ive managed to mess up every recipe that Ive ever tried on this website, but this CAME OUT SUPERB!  TOTALLY EASY and TOTALLY TASTY!  I couldnt believe I actually made it.  Very flavorful, and juicy.  I used thick cuts of pork loin chops that I got on sale at Ralphs, and followed the recipe exactly. Hubby didnt have to pretend to like it, because he truly did LOVE it! Even my picky 7 yr old son loved it.

The spices gave the pork chops good flavor.  I loved it but my husband didn't like the fat on the pork chops though so I think next time I'll use a different cut/kind of meat.

These are very good, you just want to make sure that the pork chops that you get aren't too thick. Otherwise it takes forever to cook them this way.

Rather than loin chops I used center cut rib chops.  Simple to make and excellent flavor.  An instant favorite.

This was amazingly easy, and flavorful! I'll definitely prepare pork chops this way again. I followed the recipe exactly, didnt change a thing.

Excellent flavors! This rub will be a standard in my kitchen from now on. If I ever get the chance to toast and grind my own spices, this is the recipe/rub I'd start with.

Absolutely delicious rub. So much flavor, juiciness, and tender. Also, so simple. My husband, who is not a big pork fan, loved it also.

This was simple and delicious. I did omit the salt and pepper, and didn't use oil in the rub (just minced garlic, cumin, and coriander), but it came out great. Served with cornbread dressing and applesauce. Will be making again.

We thought the flavor was good on these chops, but after following the recipe to a "t", we felt they were a little on the dry side.  I think I will try adding some liquid (dry white wine) to the pan next time.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I could't believe how good these pork chops were!  

However I made on change.  I marinated the pork in blackstrap molasses for several hours to moisten the meat.  When I was ready to cook I wiped off most of the molasses, then rubbed in the spices and followed the recipe, cooking the chops to medium-rare (internal temperature of 145 degrees F).  

The pork chops came out tender and moist with a great spiced flavor.  I just wonder if I got a special cut of meat.   Usually my pan fried pork chops turn out a bit too dry.  Maybe it was the molasses that made the difference.

Won't bother again because the spices tasted grainy on the pork we thought.  Since we don't usually fry our meats we put it on the grill which I think helped it.

This is delicious with lots of flavor but as we are Cumin addicts, we triple the spice mix. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

I love cumin and coriander so I gave this one a shot, but I added a twist.  I cooked the chops for 4 min on each side then took them off the skillet and then butterflied each of them and stuffed them with a slice of goat cheese and spinach.  Put them in the oven for an additional 10-15 min and oh my god YUM!!!.  I know I went completely off the reservation on this one but I am glad I did.  Enjoy.

Great flavor however too much salt. Next time I will only add salt after serving as needed. Used top loin chops and cooked on medium as directed, needed about 7 min on each side. Was very tender and juicy and still pink in the middle. Yum.

Made according to the recipe and really loved it! I ran out of ground coriander but luckily had coriander seed to grind, which gave such a nice bright flavor; will use fresh ground coriander next time too! A real keeper. Thanks

Served it with roasted Brussels sprouts and tricolor quinoa, yum!

I put the paste on about 2 hours before cooking and the herbs penetrated the meat nicely.  It was very tasty indeed. will definitely be trying this again. I have see the same recipe only adding 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar to the mix.

Great simple recipe. Used some Wegmans pork chops nice thick ones. Made this recipe about four times the suggested amount for the thicker cuts. DO NOT be shy with the garlic the taste blends right in. I made quite a thick slurry with the olive oil so it would really stick to the chops. I also added a slight applewood smoke while grilling. Mm mm delicious!!

I like a little coriander, but this recipe calls for A LOT of coriander, and it turns out I don't like it THAT much. So the second time I made this I substituted equal parts garam masala and curry powder for the coriander, and it was absolutely wonderful. Can't wait to make it again.

I don't usually have the time, or make the time to write a review, and for this I'm ashamed, because I use this site almost daily.  I don't think I have ever cooked (pan fried, baked, grilled, or BBQ'd) a pork chop with success...  Until TODAY!!  I had inexpensive, already frozen, pork loin, bone-in chops.  I had all the spices on hand, but have never used coriander and cumin together.  I did cut the amounts in half, only because I'm a rookie and I'm feeding a 78 y/o parent and an 11 y/o kid.  I did as one other suggested and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before cooking.. Mine were thick, so I needed more than 5 mins per side.  I have to say, these chops were the BEST I ever made, and ate!  They were moist, and delicious... even my father who rarely compliments my cooking (his generation) said 2 or 3 times they were excellent! :)  Same as my son.  He eats what I put in front of him, but rarely compliments!  Two large chops fed all three of us, and I got the best part.. the meat around the bone!  OMG delish!  Thank you for posting, and Thank you for listening to my happy rant! lol  :D

Quite good and different. I do like lots of seasoning but decided to cut back on the cumin and coriander a little. Glad I did and will definitely make them again. Thanks for the recipe Darla.

This was delicious! I didn't have coriander but it was great without. I used chipotle olive oil and tossed the fried cabbage side in the leftover oil and yummy bits after taking out the chops. A huge hit!

Terrific and easy. Kids and adults alike love it. Add some stone ground mustard and maple syrup to dress it up a bit.

Too much spice for kids.  Spread it a little thinner and they loved it.

I tried this recipe last night.  I was really looking forward to it, but even my husband who loves pork chops could only eat 1/2 of one chop.  Sorry.  Margaret B.

I made this recipe once before. My kids are picky eaters but when they ate this one they really liked it! Mahalo from Hawaii :)

All I could taste was Cumin. Other than Cumin, it had no taste.

It tasted pretty good, but I think this was a little too heavy on the cumin, as it overpowered the coriander and garlic.

This was good except we cut down on the garlic and the salt.  Just be very careful not to overcook it, it can be very easily dried out.

My stove shorted out. So while awaiting a new one to be delivered, I am in the mode of improvising recipes.  I'm using the microwave more than I have in years.  I broiled these chops 5 mins per side and they came out amazingly moist!  I think, though, if I make them again, I will cut back on the cumin.  The fam liked 'em and gave 'em a 4.

This is very tasty. The 2nd time I made it, I added 1/2 TBS of red pepper for little extra kick.

I love pork chops, and this is one of the best recipes for chops that I've tried.  A great side dish for this is pineapple curry rice.

An awesome alternative to the same-old-same old pork chops! We omitted the coriander simply because we had none on hand, but the cumin rub was fantastic anyhow.

We really enjoyed the flavor of the pork chops from the spice rub.  It was also quick and easy, which is a huge plus in my book!  I grilled these using a grill pan, and they turned out beautifully...I will definitely make this again, and maybe spice up the rub with some cayenne.

The flavor of this was wonderful.  But, I must have done something wrong with the cooking as they just did not turn out right (too dry). The family liked the flavor, so I will attempt again with different cut of pork maybe.

i was hesitant to make this recipe at first, but i'm glad it tried it. as long as you don't over cook the chops you're in good shape.

My husband liked this, but I didn't think it was anything special.  I do like cumin, but I thought the pork could have used some additional flavor.
