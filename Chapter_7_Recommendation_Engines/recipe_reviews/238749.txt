This are rich and tasty little treats. I didn't have the hazelnut extract so I used vanilla. I found the dough a little thick and sticky, but it makes a cute little cookie. They didn't last long in this household! These will satisfy your sweet crazing in just a couple of bites.

These were smaller than I expected but oh so rich! Totally hit the spot for my chocolate craving (and in just a piece or two), and fit perfectly into a mini cupcake wrapper for presenting in gift boxes to friends for the holidays. I put the Nutella into a thick plastic bag, snipped the corner a little bit, and "piped" Nutella onto one cookie while smushing it down with the second cookie. No mess! Can't wait to try this with a mint-chocolate filling next time!

Talk about chocolate overload! The hint of hazelnut from the extract is fabulous. This is a great cookie. Be sure to have it with a big glass of milk! Also, do let the cookies cool all the way. I tried to spread one while it was warm and it fell apart.

Wow, these really turned out great! I was a little skeptical, but I made the cookies exactly per the recipe and they are delicious! They're super chocolatey and rich, yet somehow lighter in texture than I expected them to be. I will make these again and again.

I did not have any Nutella, but did have marshmallow fluff that needed using- it made a delicious filling (if messy). I plan to try this with all sorts of variations on filling and flavored extract. (Coffee flavor? Mint chocolate? Dark chocolate orange? Raspberry? Oh, this is going to be fun.)

Got milk??   Very rich!   Made it exactly as the directions stated.    I am not a big chocolate person but the rest of the family is.

I followed this recipe almost exactly. The only change I made was melt the chocolate chips I used because I wanted a simple chocolate cookie. I like them, but they are not as sweet as I would prefer. Does anyone know if there is a way to make these slightly sweeter without changing the texture? The texture is perfect- light and fluffy. 
Thanks!

Followed the cookie recipe which came out perfect but instead of hazelnut creme I used melted white chocolate. Yummy cookie that's not too sweet.

Well. I like my chocolate cookies to taste like chocolate cookies. This was not as expected. I had to make a "super peanut butter" filling to even get my family to try it, again.  We then froze the sandwiches hoping that it would be better  frozen . The results were:  As long as we eat them fast enough and just the peanut butter filling they are ok. Mediocre at best.
