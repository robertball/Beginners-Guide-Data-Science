I gave this recipe 5 stars, but I made some changes because I used what I had on hand.  After cutting the recipe in half, I substituted Cream of Broccoli soup, added some minced garlic, and substituted swiss cheese.  To cut down the wine I used 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup lowfat milk.  Lastly, I added 1 cup of water to the stuffing so that it would be moist.  I cooked it for 30 minutes covered, removed the cover and cooked an additional 15-20 minutes.  It really was a tasty dish, and I will make it again.

This is a difficult recipe to rate only due to the fact that the directions were not very clear to me. I couldn't imagine that you would not prepare the stuffing in advance, however, the directions did not ask to do so. Fortunately I do read all reviews and apparently others felt the same as I, so I did make the stuffing on top of the stove first. This would, as other reviewers stated to be quite a salty dish, so I used "healthy" cream of chicken soup. Others said that the dish was rather bland, so I not only seasoned my chicken, but also the soup, to which I used beer and not wine (I was out). To make it more interesting, I sauteed onions and portabello mushrooms and added that to the layers on top of the chicken. Not a lot of changes here, but just a few things to enhance the dish. All in all Ashbeth, this is a very good recipe that my whole family truly loved. Thanks so much!

I have very little experience with cooking. (I'm just trying to help the wifey when I can). But I followed the directions carefully and also read the reviews. The dish turned out great and my wife and daughter love it! Thanks! Here are a couple of changes I tried: 1. I cut the chicken into small strips. That made it easier to serve (especially for children). It also helped when checking to see if the chicken was cooked by pulling out a small piece. I also used 12 pieces rather than 8 so we could eat it for two nights. 2. I sauteed 1/2 onion, 3 table spoons minced garlic, 5 mushrooms, parsley, and oregano in about 1/2 cup of butter . Then I spread that over the chicken. Next time my wife suggested that I could even marinate the chicken in the sautee for a while. 3. I used about 5-6oz of wine because of the other reviews. But I didn't really taste it. I might use about 8-9oz next time. 4. I used 2 slices of cheese over each breast. Again, I didn't realy taste it. I think I might go with 3 next time. 5. I used too much cream of chicken soup (about 30oz). The dish was a little too liquidy. Next time I'll probably use about 20oz. Thanks again!

this is sooooo good! I put 2 slices of provolone per boneless, skinless chicken breast. I also moistened the stuffing with boiling water as I prefer very moist stuffing. I covered it with foil and baked it for 1 hour.This would be a good dish to serve company.

I really liked this one, but substituted chicken broth for the wine.  Added a bit of parsley and oregano with the soup/broth mixture.

This is nearly identical to a recipe I found in a Gooseberry Patch cookbook (without the white wine) and is AMAZING. This has become one of the regulars on our table during the colder months. I noticed a couple of reviewers were confused by the directions telling them to use dry stuffing mix. It's true! :) DO NOT PRE-COOK THE STUFFING! The bread combined with the butter gives the finished dish some much needed and absolutely delicious crunch. Precooked it's more mushy. So be brave...put that dry stuffing on! :)

this was very good and very quick and easy to prepare.  i played with the recipe a bit by sauteing minced garlic and diced onion in butter and adding to the soup/wine mixture.  it really kicked up the flavor.  i too added boiling water to the stuffing to make it moist.  my fiance enjoyed it, he had two servings.  i will definitely make this again.

I used chicken broth rather than wine to make this kid friendly and my 20 month old loved it!  You really couldn't taste the cheese at all, but overall, this wasn't a bad recipe.  I think it might also be good with cheddar cheese soup, so you have two cheese chicken--that's what I'll try next time!

A very tasty chicken dish Ashbeth.I didn't have to change a thing. The sauce is too thin for gravy, but a little cornstarch could help that out. The flavor had a pleasing subtle white wine flavor. Not to overpowering. This is a very simple dish with no frills that company would also enjoy. Thanks.

Ok I used all the ingredients for this dish, but I put it together differently.  I "stuffed" the chicken with the stuffing mix (already prepared).  Then layered with the soup mixture and added the cheese to the top.  I also reduced the amount of wine a bit because of the other reviewers comments about the strong taste.  I will definately use again.  Thanks for the post.

as is usual for me, i had to make a bunch of substitutions to compensate for what i didn't have at the house.  i subbed chicken broth for the wine, and crushed crackers instead of stuffing.  i thought it was fantastic!!!  hubby and daughter both agreed.  plus it was quick and easy too!  thanks!!

way too much wine! Not terribly exciting but will make it again. I used 6 chicken breasts, cut in half to cook faster. Added 1 1/4 C warm water to stuffing & drizzled stuffing with melted butter. Also added 1/2 an onion & 2 cloves minced garlic, sauteed to soup/wine mixture. Cooked covered 45 minutes.

I had a busy day, so I appreciate the ease of this recipe. I used half white wine, half organic chicken broth and I sauteed onion and garlic in a little butter/EVOO before adding the sauce ingredients and I also added basil and oregano to the sauce after I tasted the sauce. My family ate every bit of this. I served it with homemade biscuits and steamed broccoli. Nice and quick, which was a real lifesaver today. Next time, I think I'll use shredded provolone.

I have to admit, we LOVE this recipe! I tweaked it up a little though. Being it is only two of us, we had to cut back the recipe. Cook time on the breast as a whole really needs to be longer then stated above. I found a hour and a half cooked the chicken complete through. Here are the following changes I made: I COOKEDTHE STUFFING!! I DID NOT put it on top raw, it will crisp up in the oven. I layer the chicken, then the cheese (we like it cheesy so about 4 slices), Cream of mushroom soup mixed with the white wine (we add to taste)mixed and poured on top. Then a layer of chopped Portobello Mushrooms mixed with a sliced onion. More cheese and then the stuffing on top. Bake covered with tin foil for about a hour and then a half hour uncovered. Comes out super cheesy and stuffing has a great crunchy top. This one, after the changes, was added to our recipe box!

This recipe AND some of the reviewers reminded me of when I was a young bride in the fifties.  If the number of ingredients exceeded six I became totally confused and couldn't follow directions. What are you kids doing while cooking...texting? Heads up, pay attention!
A ten year should be able to help mom out and make this dish without goofing up. By the way its very tasty
Thank you Ashbeth for submitting this recipe, it's nice to have a few recipes you can whip together in a few minutes.

I loved this recipe...but as a friend pointed out, it was a springboard for what I put together.  I used the advice of others and used broth instead of the wine, as I didnt have any, and used colbyjack cheese, as I had no provolone, I also used chicken tenders instead of whole breasts and added brocolli, I seasoned it with seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder, It was a hit with a salad~

My husband really enjoyed this. He wants me to make it again. I on the other hand did not like it. My 3 year old also did not care for it. I am not sure if I will make again. If I do I will cut down on the wine.

This is a great recipe as is and one that can be altered easily. The 2nd time around making this I didn't have provolone - I used swiss; also didn't have cr. of chix - I used cr of mush; and I also didn't have stuffing mix - I used a combo of seasoned bread crumbs and panko with the butter.  Everyone liked the orig version as much as the 2nd!

I have always loved this recipe and for those not sure about the stuffing mix...it does just fine without making it up first  just do it like the recipe is written. I used to use swiss cheese but had provolone on hand this time and found this recipe. :)

Hmmmmm...seems I have a different opinion of this recipe. Very soupy, I used 1/2 can of both soup cans as suggested by another, of the wine. WOW, way overpowering and I love wine. Can't imagine what it's like with the 10oz. as in original recipe. Not very tasty and won't even attempt this one again even with alterations, it's not worth the time. No one will eat the leftovers.

This has a lot of salt in it, the instructions are a little difficult to follow and there ends up being way too miuch stuffing. The chicken does taste good tho.

This recipe was good.  I changed it a bit though.  I sauteed onions and garlic then added the white wine and a about 1/3 cup of chicken broth.  Then, I lightly cooked the chicken in the white wine mixture before adding the chicken to the pan and topping it with double the amount of provolone - I love provolone!  Then, I combined the cream of mushroom soup with the white wine mixture and poured the mixture over the chicken and provolone.  I topped it off with crispy fried onions and baked it.  I would recommend serving this with green beans - the flavors go well together and the dish needs something more . . . so the green beans make it poifect.  :)

This is very similiar to Cathy's Creamy Chicken Bake on this site. Cathy's differs from this in the proportions of ingredients and that it uses Swiss rather than Provolone. I could barely taste the cheese in this dish - maybe a whole slice of cheese would work better -or maybe this just works better with Swiss.  Also Cathy's uses only 1 can of soup and 1 cup of stuffing.  Yes, there is less sauce, but who needs all that cream of chicken soup?  If I were to make this again, I would follow Cathy's Creamy Chicken Bake, substituting the Provolone for the Swiss.

I didn't like this much.  Wasn't very flavorful and just kinda tasted blah.  Sorry... :(  My husband said he 'liked it' though - but not sure I believe him.  It was okay - but not worth the calories from teh soup, cheese & stuffing.

This is an excellent company coming dinner, I'm making it today for 18 people tonight! I can make this now, 10 a.m., refrigerate and pop in the oven an hour before serving, doesn't get easier. I love all the different suggestions and everyone will work, that is the best part about a caserolle like this. Remember the alchahol in the wine evaporates when it is cooked, so it is a flavor only. I have made this many times over the past 5 years and no one has been disappointed.

Definite comfort food!  Not great for the waistline, but very tasty.  I made many of the suggested changes: cut recipe in 1/2, used about 1/4 cup of chardonay and 1/3 cup of low fat milk, pre-seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic pepper and sea salt, and made the stuffing before adding it to the top of the chicken.  Very yummy.  DH and son practically licked their plates clean.  : )

This recipe is good -- nothing horribly special -- but good, and I would make it again.  However, unless I did something wrong, I needed way less than the amount of stuffing mix called for.  A 6-ounce bag was more than enough.  And, maybe chicken breasts in California are extra large, but 30 minutes in the oven wasn't nearly long enough.  I baked the casserole for 45, and the chicken was still a touch underdone.

Rating really low because this recipe is off. Cooking time needs to be vastly increased if you prepare the stuffing per package directions.

My boyfriend and I really liked it.  He went back for seconds and actually finished it off (we just made half-size).  He thinks it'd be good with halibut or deer meat used and I agree that we might try it again with a meat with more flavor (I love chicken, but he craves more flavor sometimes).  The only change I made was I didn't have white wine, so I used some sherry.  We did NOT cook the stuffing first, but I did make sure it was well buttered and cooked it with foil in for the first 20 minutes.  We both liked the crunchy on the very top consistency and that the stuffing up against the sauce was moist.

I really enjoyed this but I like a crunchier topping so it suited me well.  I didn't have wine so used chicken stock.  I also omitted the butter and mixed the dressing with half of one of the cans of cream of chicken soup. I found it very tasty!!

This recipe was not at all what I expected. I followed it to a T (excluding the white wine, my children don't like the taste) and it turned out horrible. My husband liked it that's the only reason I rated it 2 stars.Not a dish I will make again.

yummm! I loved this recipe. I prepared the stuffing in advance and only used about 3/4 cup wine. I also kicked the stuffing up a notch by adding 1 1/2 teaspoons of onion powder and a dash of garlic salt. I will definitely make this again!

Very good, but pretty salty.  I probably should've used reduced sodium, Cream of Chicken. Because between the the soup, stuffing, and cheese it was on the salty side.  Still very good, just need to alter for sodium/salt purposes.  Great the next day too.

Family loved this one.  Was a bit salty, but no one seemed to mind.  Used both boneless,skinless breasts and thights, and added cooked onion and celery to a 6oz box of cornbread stuffing.  Served leftovers with rice the next night and everyone liked it even more.

I prepared this last night and I thought it wasn't too bad.  I didn't use a boxed stuffing, rather seasoned stuffing cubes which weren't salty.  It didn't say to add any liquid to the stuffing, but it was apparent that liquid needed to be added.  I put the stuffing on the bottom, the chicken breasts on top, I used 8, but next time 6 would be plenty.  I put the cheese on the chicken and then topped it with the soup mix.  I didn't use as much wine and I couldn't taste the wine.  I thought maybe because I used cooking wine that was why. 

I think I will try again and do some more tweaking.

This recipe with two changes is what I grew up with, we call it Grandma June's Chicken.  We use swiss cheese instead, we also pour the stuffing over the chicken, soup mixture, then pour the butter over it.  It does make a crispy topping, but it also soaks up some of the soup.  I will have to try it now with provalone.

This recipe has a lot of potential. It was very good with the exception of the stuffing. I believe the recipe should read 16 oz of stuffing mix PREPARED. Next time that is was I will do.

Needs to bake a lot longer and probably at a higher temperature. By the time the chicken was cooked through, the stuffing was burnt. The chicken did have good taste. The cooking instructions need work.

Made half size, with whole slices of provolone cheese, halved wine with milk, added onion and garlic and basil, served with penne pasta. I also sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on top instead of stuffing. Family loved it.

I made half a recipe when my parents visited, but now I wish I had made the whole recipe so that I would have had some leftovers! I followed the recipe exactly, no alterations, except perhaps I used more cheese than called for.

Thus is the 2nd time we've used this recipe - and it was great!  Followed exact directions but used baby Swiss cheese because that is my fav! My daughter fixed it the 2nd time, she's 19 and it was amazing! Great and easy recipe.

Not bad.  Family enjoyed this but I doubt it will added to the weekly rotation of favorite chicken dishes.  It was hard to tell there was cheese on the chicken.

There was too much wine in this recipe... and I like wine! It kind of made me sick. I also didn't really like the cream of chicken soup. Maybe I would try cream of mushroom???  Also... if I were to make some version of it in the future... I would make the stuffing according to the recipe on the box and then bake over the top of all ingredients. I didn't like how the stuffing was hard on top when I followed this recipe.

This dish was amazing.  However, when I followed this recipe I discovered that unless you cook the chicken first, which is not stated in the recipe, you will need to cook this dish at 365 degrees for an hour or so.  NOT 30 MINUTES.

I'm glad I read the other reviews first, it helped me tweak this to a great meal. I salt/peppered the chicken prior to placing it in the dish, used double the amount of cheese, added sauteed onion, garlic and scallions to the wine/soup (reduced sodium, which is good, because it was pretty salty anyway) mixture. I also cut the wine down to 1/2 cup; and finally, as suggested, I prepared the stovetop stuffing prior to placing over the casserole.

I was out of cream of chicken, so I used cream of mushroom instead.  I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash.  I also prepared the stuffing mix as per package directions.  It turned out OK, tasted good.

It was an ok recipe. Cooking time needs to be 45 minutes, not 30. And that's with the chicken breasts cut in half. Definitely needs to be liquid added to the stuffing. WAY too dry. Maybe a can of broth? You couldn't really taste the cheese, either. I don't think I'll try this one again.

Very good, but cooking time should be a little longer.  The stuffing mix prevented some of the chicken from cooking properly.  Had to put it back in for another 10-15 minutes.

This was hardly a 'creamy wine sauce'; the wine overpowered the entire recipe, the stuffing was dry... what is everyone else tasting? I salvaged the chicken, but I'm still mad about the other wasted ingredients.  How could I have gone wrong on such a simple recipe?

My fiance and I are always looking for new and interesting recipes.  This one seemed like a sure bet.  Unfortunately, we weren't happy with it at all.  The stuffing was too crunchy and the whole meal was too salty.  The only good part was the chicken w/ provolone.  We scraped off as much stuffing as possible.  As I'm sure you can tell, we will never make this recipe again.

Too much wine for me.  I will try again and replace 1/2 of the wine with chicken broth and top each breast with a whole slice of provolone.
