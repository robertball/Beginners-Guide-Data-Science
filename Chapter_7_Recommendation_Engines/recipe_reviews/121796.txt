I needed a recipe for puffs and this is a great one.  When I made the chicken salad I omitted the pineapple.  I was concerned that others at the party would like it, so I left it out. I however would have loved it in there and the next time I make it I am adding the pineapple.
  The cooks that had flat puffs. You just didn't cook them long enough.  I know when you take them out they are all puffy, but they deflate if you have undercooked them.  SO, after the full 20 minutes, check them by lifting them up of the sheet.  IF you feel any weight, they aren't done.  Put them back in for 3 minutes more.  You will have puffy puffs all the time!

The chicken salad portion of this recipe is the best!  No reason to change anything with the filing. However, the recipe instructs to drop the puff batter by teaspoon.  My first batch turned out way too small and flat - it should be more like a heaping tablespoon.  This way you can actually cut the top off and fill.  The next time I make these I'm going to try the Pepperridge Farms puff pastries instead of making the "puff" part of this recipe.  Overall, it was excellent and a big hit at my Christmas party.  I did make them that morning and refrigerated until the evening serving and they were not soggy at all.  Be sure to drain the pineapple in a colander to get the juice off somewhat.

This is an outstanding appetizer. A little extra work, but worth it. If your party lasts longer than an hour or two, I would suggest not filling them until right before serving. The bottoms tend to get soggy if left filled for hours.

I didn't actually use the chicken salad recipe, just the idea for chicken salad puffs, as well as the puff recipe (I filled it with chicken salad from my own recipe.) However, I thought I'd post a review based on what really helped make this dish successful. I read the reviews here and saw that many people's puffs had flattened out, so I looked up cream puff recipes to see what they did. The recipe here http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Cream-Puffs/Detail.aspx is basically the same recipe as these puffs, and has a great review, second one down on the main page, that gives some essential tips for keeping your puffs from collapsing. After poking holes in my puffs with a toothpick near the end of baking time, I only had one or two that collapsed. Cutting off the top, there was nothing to hollow out, it was already a hollow shell PERFECT for spooning chicken salad into. These were a great success at my Easter party and I will definitely use the puff idea for chicken salad in the future!

Love the flavor of the ckn salad- finally, someone really gets seasoning right!  I added some dill and chopped grapes.  The puffs turned out so cute, make sure you pierce them quickly and cook them long enough so they stay puffy!

Very good! I admit I cheated and bought the puff pastries, a couple of the previous reviews made me nervous and I am not a baker. I made the chicken salad part exactly as written. I thought they were pretty good, but everyone else LOVED them. They were a huge hit.

I gave this 5 stars even tho I COULDN'T make the puffs..it was a disaster!  I've never tried to make them before so I'm sure it was my inexperience that did it. I still made the chicken salad part,  and it was SO GOOD!  I used the crushed pineapple, walnuts(instead of pecans, too expensive!)and celery.  I omitted the onions and the relish and added some pineapple tid bits chopped a little more for some bigger chunks.  I ended up using store bought dinner rolls (potato and hawaiian) to put them on and just made mini chicken salad sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe!!

chicken salad portion...AWESOME!  As far as the puffs go...I tried three different times to make them, and all I ended up with were these flat spongy cookie thingies.  Not sure what I did wrong, but the chicken salad went great on crackers, so all is well!

The chicken salad is among the best I've ever tasted.  The puffs are no problem at all for anyone who has ever worked with chou paste.  Even though a little bit of trouble to make, they look wonderful on a buffet.  I've taken these to several pot lucks, and they always get oohs and ahs.

This is a great recipe. It was a little bland at first, but i left out the relish so my mother- inlaw added the relish and a little cider vinegar and that took away the bland taste. Over all it was great i will always use this recipe for my chicken salad. The puffs were so easy we were amazed at how easy and good they looked and tasted. Thanks for the recipe.

I have been wanting to try this recipe since I saw it a couple months back. The picture looks mouth watering. I did not make the puffs for the salad but will def. try to at a later date. I left out the relish and pecans because I didnt have either. I used a store bought ready to eat in the deli chicken ( rosemary seasoning). I also added red onion, chestnuts and sunflower seeds to make up for not have pecans. This was delicious. I am sitting here eating it now with some grain crackers.yummy!

Although my puffs turned out great the first time, the overall taste of the salad and the puffs was somehow not what I was expecting. The salad seemed a little bland. Not as yummy as I was hoping. Still a pretty decent recipe, and the people at my party still ate them!

This recipe is great and is a keeper!  I used an electric knife to cut off the tops and instead of putting the tops back on the filling, I toasted chopped pecans and dipped the filled puff in that.  They were so pretty and very good!

I have been making these chicken puffs for many, many years.  I use this exact recipe for home and  for public consumption.  The chicken is awesome and the puffs are very easy and I can make small servings to over 100 servings and have very few not turn out puffy!  I make the chicken salad the night before so that  the flavors mix thoroughly.
