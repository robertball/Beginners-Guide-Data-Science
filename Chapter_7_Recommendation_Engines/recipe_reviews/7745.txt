Wonderful cake! I didn't have 3 layer cake pans, so I baked it in a 13x9 pan for 45 minutes. It turned out great. You may be tempted to skip the pecan toasting process, but don't! Toasting the pecans in butter is what gives this cake its unique, irresistible flavor. The cake received rave reviews from my family and my co-workers. I will definitely keep this cake on my "favorites" list!

This is a very good cake.  Do not overbake or I think it would be dry.
The icing tastes like butter pecan ice cream, the heavy cream gives it
that flavor.

Flavor was good.  Cake was very very dry.  Neither my family nor I like dry cake.  I had to throw out more than 1/2 of it because no one wanted to eat it.  I am not a novice cook either.  Will not make this again.

This cake was absolutely delicious.  I love Butter Pecan icecream, and this cake tasted very much like it.  I used store-bought icing instead, just to make it a little more simple.  (1 pk. Butter cream frosting, 2 pks. Cream cheese frosting)  With the icing, by mistake, I used two different brands of Cream Cheese flavor, I used Betty Crocker and Duncan Hines, so you might like to try that.  The cake is so delicious!

This recipe was alright.  I think I may have overbaked it just a little because it did end up being pretty dry.  The frosting was so so.  Just a sidenote, in your ingredients list you have baking powder but in the procedure you said to mix baking soda; I wasn't sure so I used baking powder.  This may have had something to do with it.  Also, I have a cake recipe that calls for 4 tsp. of baking powder and this one only calls for 2.  This may also have soemthing to do with it.

This is by far the best cake I have ever had. I made it for the first time last Christmas and have made it on special occasions since. My dad also says this is the best cake he's ever had.

I actually found this recipe on another site when I used it, but it's the exact same thing, and it is SO good.  The cake is very dense and moist.  When I made it I made a 12x2" square cake.  It was a little difficult to level with the pecans baked into it but I managed!  I frosted this with from scratch maple cream cheese frosting and it is to die for :-9

I really wanted to like this cake but we just weren't impressed.  The cake turned out dry (did I overmix or overbake?) and the icing was too sweet for our taste.  Worth a shot, though.

This is a good option, but the cake is too dry.  Needs something.  The flavor is there, just not the moistness.

The only change I made was I separated the yolks from the
whites, and beat the whites stiff and folded them in just 
before I added the pecans, this made the cake much lighter.

I made this cake and it is awesome! I made it into large cupcakes - using the #12 cookie scoop. I also added cake mix extender which increased the amount of the cake, thus I ended up having 27 cupcakes. Cake mix extender: add 1 egg, 1C. flour, 1C. sugar, 8oz, pkg cream cheese - softened, 1t. baking powder, 1/3t. salt, 1t. vanilla. Yummmy...
