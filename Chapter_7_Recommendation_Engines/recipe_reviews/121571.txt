Fabulous!  I used a pre-made pie crust and it really gave this something extra - highly recommended! I did omit the onion, because I was out, and it didn't seem to be 'missing' anything!  I think this recipe would also be good with sausage, bacon, etc.  This will be our Christmas morning breakfast this year - so quick and easy and a huge hit!  Makes great leftovers too and would be easy to freeze and reheat later.  We had this for dinner, but it really could be used for any meal - very versatile!  YUM!

Delicious!  I didn't have any bisquit/baking mix on hand so I used flour and baking powder instead.  So easy and really good.  Will definitely be making again.

Easy and good. I added a 4 oz. can of diced green chiles in one of the pies, and eliminated the onion and added black olives in the other (for my 7-yr-old son). The second time I made it, I mixed all of the ingredients together, rather than layering the meat on the bottom of the dish and it turned out perfectly. We've been enjoying hot links and kielbasa in place of the ham as well. If you like southwest flavors, add the chiles and serve it with salsa on top.

Excellent recipe! I did what another person suggested, I didn't have biscuit mix so I added 1 cup of flour and 1 tsp of baking powder, it worked great! I also made small bite sized quiches with muffin cups in a regular sized muffin tin. They were done in 25 mins! Perfect for breakfast on the run...!

Very easy recipe. I made a change or two: I put it in a 8x8 dish, used velveeta (4 slices about 1/2" thick, and added thyme. Picky dtr liked it, even husband who doesn't care for egg dishes liked it! Thanks:)

One of the easiest and tastiest recipes for a busy morning. I add 2 TBSP garlic to this recipe as a personal preference, and it's a nice addition to an already great recipe. I also bake this in a medium-sized casserole dish rather than making two pies, and the dish bakes just as well.

What an easy and tasty recipe.  Husband and kids all enjoyed it.  I was worried my dgtr wouldn't eat because of the onions but they didn't overpower the taste of the pie.  I also halved the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  I made in a glass pie plate and forgot to grease it - suprisingly nothing stuck to the plate!   I found the biscuit/baking mix settled to the bottom of the cooked pie and formed a VERY thin crust.

This was a good simple recipe.  I would say it's more of a breakfast dish than anything else, because you can really taste the eggs.  Next time I think I will make it a little healthier by throwing in some spinach and tomato.

I thought this was really good!  I cut the recipe in half, and added about 1/2 C frozen peas w/ the ham, onions & cheese.  Leftovers were awesome for next day's lunch.  I think this would be good w/ any added veggies & just about any meat.  What a great recipe!

Sauteed the onions first in a little bit of butter and added a few fresh sliced mushrooms.  Used 1 cup milk, 1 cup of half and half. Added another egg and cooked in a bigger pan but not (13 x 9) Topped with diced fresh tomatoes and green onions.

Quick and easy.  I added some crushed red pepper, a little garlic powder.  Although it was good we felt it needed a little more spice up.  Perhaps just a personal preference.  Will make again.  Thanks for a quick, easy recipe.

I agree that picky kids who aren't crazt about eggs will love it. Only problem was it was bland and needed spicing up (thyme, italian seasoning, whatever you like), and more cheeses or a zippy blend! In all was a hit!

So quick and easy -  the kids loved it! Also hubby loved it because it wasn't called a quiche - and real men don't eat Quiche! I blind baked a sheet of frozen short crust pastry as I did know what biscuit mix was (don't think we have it here in Australia)and it was lovely,I cut down on the onion though as the kids have an onion phobia.

My family really liked this! I forgot to grease the pans, and didn't have onions, but it still turned out really good, with the family asking me to make it again. Thanks! It's no small feat trying to find something everyone enjoys!

This was just okay but it might be my fault. I didn't have biscuit mix so I used flour and baking soda like someone else suggested. It turned out extremely bland! I also added broccoli.

Way back when my mom & grandma used to make the pies & they were called Impossible Pies and I remember a whole bisquick cook book devoted to impossible pies of every nature with a variety of fill-ins.  For this one I used peas because I don't like onions. I also used heart smart bisquick so it was healthier. I had to cook mine for about 35 minutes because it was still doughy in the middle after 25.  This was very yummy and my picky husband even liked it.

I made this for supper last night - it was terrific! I meant to take the advise of other reviews and add seasoning but I forgot and yet the flavor was not too bland. I did add a can of spinach drained to make it more well balanced and it went really well with all the flavors. We will definitely be making this regularly, was a quick meal to prepare and I always appreciate meals that taste so good for being quick & easy :)

Made 1/2 recipe exactly as listed for just the two of us.  Absolutely delicious!  Could have eaten the whole pie.  Would make a great brunch dish, cooled a bit and sliced in wedges.

Quick and easy.  A good way to use up left over ham.  I will make this again.

Quick, easy and very tasty.  A great way to use up the leftover Easter ham.  It would be a great Christmas morning dish.  My family wants repeats!

Made it as written. Very easy to prepare and tasted very good. This made a nice light dinner.
We had half for dinner and will have the other half for lunch.

I was looking for something to do with leftover ham.  I made this tonight for dinner and my 3 teen boys loved it.  Both pies were eaten!  The only change I made was to saute the onions in a little butter so the guys would not notice the onions.  Will definitely make again.   We served it with a tossed salad and fresh fruit but would be great for a brunch.

A very easy dish to make when life gets busy.  Serve with plain ham on the side, it is delicious!

This is pretty good.  My daughter isn't a big onion eater so next time I would use less/no onion.
