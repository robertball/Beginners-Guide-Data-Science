LOVED this! It's absolutly wonderful! I was a little leary about adding all the vinigar to the pastry (my usual pie crust recipe only calls for 2 tps) but it was Great! I wouldn't change a thing. Turned out flaky and wonderful. (Not greasy at all either, which I was worried about with all the cheddar) So wonderful! :)

This was a very good pie, next time I would bake the crust a little before to keep if from being as soggy. The cheese flavor is not overpowering, it is quite nice - a hint of cheese, and a delicious pie! (I followed the directions exactly) The liquid in the pie did not gel, it just made more liquid infact, so I don't know how to fix that. We enjoyed the pie though!

I had alittle trouble with the crust when rolling it out but added more water and it rolled out fine after that but a really great recipe and pie. I had mine with homemade vanilla icecream and it was incredible, agree that it is alot of work though and my kitchen looks like a bomb went off but the results are worth it.

For those of us who like a slice of cheddar cheese with hot apple pie, this recipe is great.  My crust didn't turn out as well as I'd like it, but I  seem to be 'pie crust challenged' and have not yet worked out a technique for flaky, tender crust.

I liked the filling a lot, but I wasn't too sure about the crust.  I was hard to manage, as the cheese made it sticky and lumpy.  It was also hard to cut.  I will say, though, that it was definitely one of the prettiest pies I've made.  The cheese-speckled crust made for a very attractive dessert.

Very nice pie, great for Thanksgiving, for those that don't like Pumpkin.  Nice change of pace.  Would have scored five but this pie is quite a bit of work, but well worth it in the end.

It was impossible to roll the crust to the desired thinness without it falling apart, and I was hesitant to add more water for fear that it would be tough. So it was a bit thick and doughy - scone-like, our tasters said. I wouldn't make this again ... the cheese/apple combo is a little weird.

It was great, love a hint of cheddar with tartness of the apples!
