A little on the crumbly side but absolutely delicious cornbread!! Great texture and taste. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan, it rose and browned beautifully and was delicious with some turkey chili.

My husband was totally thrilled with this recipe. He said the crust was perfect.  He is looking forward to having it for breakfast with milk!

This is a very good recipe!! Great taste! I baked mine in a cast iron skillet...I gave it 30 minutes but ended up taking it out in 25 min. I also cut the recipe in half and it didn't need the extra cooking time. Cooked perfectly! Thank you Texaslady for a very good recipe!

Made it according to recipe.  It was delicious. However, it  did taste and smell a lot like coconut. Fortunately, I like coconut. Unfortunately, i think there's too much coconut oil in the recipe. Altho healthier than other oils, still, we don't need that much oil. So I won't be making this again.

I did make this recipe but it came out like a flat pancake. I couldn't figure  it out did I over mix it ? I then checked the expiration date  on my baking powder  it was old. I will make it again with new baking powder. So to be honest I am not sure how to rate this recipe.

Good stuff, slightly crumbley but i like that, first time using coconut oil for cornbread. The oil gives a wonderful aroma, served it with spanish chicken stew, delicious.

Good moist cornbread, a little crumbly. Everyone in my family enjoyed it, including my oldest who wouldn't eat cornbread in the past. My husband liked it, but it's not his favorite. I would definitely make it again. I did use sweetened vanilla almond milk in place of regular milk because of eating dairy free and that's what I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I myself enjoyed it with earth balance butter flavored spread and honey, yum!!!
