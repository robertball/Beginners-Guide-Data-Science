I liked this salad but would definitely do differently next time. I prepared this one late night. Had put the cooked chicken, cooked pasta, grapes, and green onions in a bowl with every intention to make that night. However, I ended up going to bed early. The next night, I mixed the cole slaw & mayo ( I omitted miracle whip-instead added extra 1/4 cup mayo and 1/2 tbsp of lawry's seasoning) and added the mayo mixture to the cold pasta then added cranberries & pecans. It looked so yummy I decided to eat some then and it was delicious! However, I made this for the next day and as the recipe suggest, I let it marinate overnight, the next day it was a let down! The flavors just "fell flat". I would suggest prepping the salad, chilling overnight, then adding the dressing! Also, make sure you add the cranberries right before serving as they will turn your salad a grayish color.

I took a couple of stars off for the recipe as written here. Since I think Miracle Whip is incredibly gross, I made my own creamy dressing with mayo, sour cream, dijon mustard, honey, garlic, fig vinegar and bit of worcestershire sauce; limited celery and diced it rather than sliced so it wasn't so overpowering; I also used half the grapes indicated; and toasted the cashews. it was fabulous.

This salad was delicious! I will definitely make it again. I modified it a little by adding 
1 cup of mayo instead of ½ cup of mayo and ½ cup of Miracle Whip (I’m not a fan of Miracle Whip), I excluded the red grapes and put only one cup of dried cranberries in it. 
I used a rotisserie chicken for ease. I love recipes like this – very flavorful and looks great too!

Wonderful.  Took to a family gathering and loved it.  Although I added 1 cup of miracle whip, 1 cup of coconut, 1 can of mandarin oranges, and 1 can pineapple tidbits- awesome!!

This was good.  I ended up using a whole box of pasta (12oz) because there seemed to be a lot of dressing (and I still didn't make up all the dressing).  I did think that next time I'll either put cranberries OR grapes--but, not both.  I used pecans because that was what I had on hand (I think cashews may have worked better with the flavor combo of this recipe).  With a few changes to reflect our personal tastes, this will make a nice summer pasta salad.

This recipe is great!!  I'm on my second batch in a week.  My husband LOVES this! We like a drier salad so I just used the poppyseed dressing and 1/2 mayo and it was just enough. Definitely a keeper

This salad is fabulous!  I tried it at a luncheon, and loved it so much that I requested the recipe, something I rarely do. The only real change, it that our recipe also includes  10 0z.pineapple tidbits.  The pinapple is a nice touch!

This is a great salad -- I serve a green salad with these same components, but I'd never thought to turn them into a salad using pasta! I used "Eating Right Light Poppyseed and Caramelized Onion" salad dressing instead of the coleslaw dressing, since I use this with the green salad I make and stock up on it when on special. It is very figure friendly although you'd never guess it was! I don't keep Miracle Whip on hand, and since the dressing is plenty sweet, i just added light mayo to the right consistency. And if you want to be really decadent, add a little crisp bacon (freshly fried and drained) and a little goat cheese!!! Serve on a bead of greens and you've gone to heaven!  I've had a lot of fun with this recipe, as I'm a salad fanatic!

I also took a couple of stars off for miracle whip. And i also substituted sour cream. And thats a lot of grapes so i also cut it by half using only red grapes. Now for the good news. I altered it sure but it was a great idea and tasted as i had hoped. Thanks to the creator of this dish.

Delicious!  Rave reviews from friends and easy to make.  Wonderful medley of flavors.  Recipe does make excess dressing, but it is so tasty!  Not a fan of water chesnuts, so quartered them and actually loved it!

This was awesome.  Took it to two potlucks in two weeks.  I like Miracle Whip because of the bite (reduced fat) and substituted FF sour cream for the mayo.  Everyone wanted the recipe!!!  It will be used over and over again.  THANK YOU!!

I made this for a luncheon and also didn't use the Miracle Whip--not a big fan.  I didn't add an equal amount of extra mayonnaise.  Everything else I left the same.  I got rave reviews for it, even the guys who don't normally like "froufrou" foods!  Definitely a keeper.  I will make again!

EXCELLENT!  I don't make pasta salads, (I'm always the one to bring dessert!), but this one I tried and it was fantastic!  Followed reviews and used poppyseed dressing, sour cream instead of mayo and cut down the grapes to a cup of each.  Maybe I'll be bringing the pasta salad from now on!

Salad was great, but it serves more than 6!!  I needed to feed 20 so was considering a triple batch, the measurements just didn't seem like only 6 and I still doubt it is.  I made with a lot of judments calls with quantities, but it turned out great.  Needed a little more seasoning than what's called for and I did to our taste preferences.  Enjoy, but know what you are looking for so you can make some jugment.

I made a couple changes as we had a person joining us that is allergic to soy. I couldn't find a cole slaw dressing without soy so I found a no soy poppyseed dressing and mixed it with a canola mayonaise. I did not use salad dressing. It was wonderful!!!!!!!!

Scrumptious!  I roasted chicken breast meat with salt, pepper, garlic, and oregano and used that for the cooked chicken.  To suit my taste, I added bacon and left out the celery and green onions.  I will definitely make this again!

Made this recipe for a girls movie night and it was a huge hit.  Everyone asked for the recipe. Even my husband liked it, and he is not a salad guy!  I didn't add as much of the cole slaw dressing (only had a 13oz jar) nor as much mayo or Miricle Whip, and was still great.  Probably could have used the whole amount by the time it "marinated" overnight and soaked up the dressing.  Will definately make this my "go to" salad!

Wonderful Salad...I did leave out the celery. It sounded very different so I was a little unsure about this one. I am glad I tried it. I have made it several times now. Thanks!

I made this for a weekend at the cabin with a bunch of friends and their family.  It was the first salad gone.  So then I made it for my mom to take it to work and again it was the first one gone.  I only use the salad dressing and didn't put a full cup.  But this salad is amazing.  Thank you for putting it on allrecipes.com.

I made this salad but replaced the miracle whip with ranch dressing and it turned out fine. I also bought chicken thighs instead of cubed breasts and they definitely taste better than flat white breast meat. Other than that, everyone loved it! Thanks.

Very good recipe.  IF you leave out the coleslaw dressing, substitute sour cream for the mayo and substitute poppy seed dressing for the salad dressing and only use half the amount listed in the recipe.  I scaled this back to make 3 servings and it still made a lot.

This salad is delicious!  I did use poppyseed dressing instead of the mayo, miracle whip and coleslaw mixture.  Also, I left out the cranberries.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy to make!  I used a rotisserie chicken to make it even easier.  It was delicious.  It makes a lot!

Only alteration was I used all mayo, no miracle whip. Everything else was exactly as the recipe is written. I will say The Bomb Dot Com!! Expensive to make but worth it. So yummy good. Sweet and salty. I always laugh when someone changes 1/2 of the recipe and gives it 2 or 3 stars. Don't rate unless you are using 90-95% of recipe ingredients.
