I found this recipe years ago and it is my husbands favorite holiday cookie.  I lost the recipe last year and was thrilled when I did a web search that it came up here!  Thank you for a delicious recipe!

so many flavours to this cookie, vanilla, almond, and maple. They seem to cancel each other out. I chose to make them with a round cookie, filling and a star, just because I was lazy.

Been making this recipe since 1986 when I found it in a Southern Living Christmas book. This version is the same with the exception of the  almond flavoring. Made this recipe as listed here but did not notice any difference in taste by adding the almond extract. Cookie is always popular.
