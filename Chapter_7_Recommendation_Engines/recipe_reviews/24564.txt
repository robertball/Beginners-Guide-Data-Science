This recipe is very similar to a Steamed Sago Pudding recipe my Australian mother-in-law gave me on my last trip to Australia. It is a classic Christmas dessert "Down Under".  I had to use tapioca instead of sago since you cannot find sago in an average US grocery store.  After the tapioca soaks overnight, cook it over low heat in a saucepan until soft and clear - otherwise your tapioca in the finished pudding will be crunchy.  Serve it topped with a warm custard sauce.  Can be made 3 days ahead and freezes well.
