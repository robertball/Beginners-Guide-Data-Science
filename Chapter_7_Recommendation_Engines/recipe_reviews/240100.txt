These turned out like homemade granola bars but without the processed sugars! I used organic coconut nectar in place of honey only because I was out. The nectar has the same consistency as honey and it worked well for this recipe. I added the shredded coconut and large pieces of walnut. I also added a sprinkle of coarse sea salt on top which I would recommend for added interest.

These are every bit as good as my usual recipe that uses loads of butter and white sugar!

These are no-bake cookies.  'Wish I'd realized that before I made them/it.  Mine looked much more - muchhhh more - chocolately than the photo.  I used 1c mini chips, & reduced honey to a quarter cup as reviewers suggested.  Subtle coconut flavor - even with adding optional coconut.  I was thinking this was more of a granola bar.  Eventhough it isn't, here is one ...  It uses crispy rice cereal.  'Haven't made it either so it may be the same story - not a bar; no-bake cookies in a dish.

So easy!!! I added wheat germ for 1/2 cup of the oats. I only put in 1/8 cup honey, and just sprinkled the top with 1/8 cup
