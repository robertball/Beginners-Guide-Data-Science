It seemed like a lot of cornstarch to me (1 cup), but I followed the directions and they tasted okay, but would have tasted better without so much cornstarch.

Great recipe!  I followed the directions precisely with great success.  The cornstarch gives it that "melt in your mouth" texture...literally, it melts in your mouth.  And the vanilla and almond flavors are yummy together.  A really good cookie!

I agree with some of the comments about the flour-y flavor.  I used unsalted butter but the last time I loaded my cookie press I mixed in a little salt.  Next time I would put in more and I think it helped the flavor.  I might also use some sprinkle sugar on top for sweetness.  I would consider making this recipe again.  I also used whole wheat flour (only flour I have) and substituted the vanilla for almond.  The WW worked fine.

The dough was very dry and crumbly so wouldn't go through my cookie press.  I added a little milk to make the press work.  The flavor of the cookie was very bland and as other reviewers said "flour-y."

Got my first cookie press and decided on this recipe after reading through a great many here at allrecipes and other sites.  Had the butter and sugar creaming and found I did not have enough flour - far short at only 1 cup.  I subbed in 1 cup of sorghum and 1 cup of mochiko (sweet rice flour).  The cookies were fantastic!  Light as air, melt-in-my-mouth good!
