These were just ok for me.  They were moist, but the flavor was not anything outstanding.  I did substitute Baste N Glaze for regular teriyaki, and the griller basted them with extra while cooking.  I also added about 1/3 c. breadcrumbs because they wouldn't hold together well without it.  We're trying lots of new burger recipes his summer and I don't think this one will make the menu rotation with the other outstanding ones we've tried.

My Husband loves these, instead of the tomatoes he likes to add a slice of pinapple which goes great with the teryaki, served with potatoe salad

I had a Teriyaki Pineapple burger while at a restaurant a few months ago and just had to try it on my own.  Followed this recipe just as it is, and it was perfect.  Then I sauteed fresh pineapple rings and onions in Teriyaki marinade to make the burger amazing!

I also used this recipe for meatballs.. turned out very good.. I took the advice and added addiontal teriyaki and baked covered 30 min.. and 10 min uncovered.. I also added a tea. ginger... and a tea. of garlic powder and serverd them with egg noodles. A big hit for my 4 children aged 5-13 and my husband as well.. next time I will add some bread crumbs, because they do fall aprt a bit.
