Not as tasty as I imagined it while reading the recipe.  Definitely needs seasoning, either salt or maybe some soy sauce in the sauce.  The grocery I stopped at didn't have adzuki beans so I used small red beans.  Black beans might have been a better sub.  I added half a thinly sliced jalapeno too.

This was awesome!  I substituted 2 cans of black beans (rinsed) for the adzuki beans, though.  One of the best recipes I've ever used!

The way this sauce tastes with the mango is unbelievable.  Found red adzuki beans (sometimes just called red beans) at the asian grocery store and had to soak/boil them.  Next time will just use canned black beans for the time savings.  We served this over rice.  Will definitely make again - especially the sauce!

This was very tasty! I substituted the Adzuki beans for tofu and I left out the green pepper only because I didn't have one handy. I also added cumin & coriander to the sauce. I think the cumin is very important. It was delicious though, I was licking my bowl clean!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  The seasoning was excellent, but we both thought it was a bit too salty.  Next time, I will reduce the soy sauce by half.

I feel badly giving such a negative review, but I thought the flavors were strange, they didn't meld well, and the sauce was too thin. I really don't know what I would do to improve upon this. I did execute exactly as written, except my aduki beans were dry so I soaked them overnight before cooking. Maybe this just wasn't suited to my tastes.

Delicious! Especially if you're a fan of Thai food. I wonder if some of the other reviewers gave it a lesser rating because they weren't that familiar with coconut milk based sauces. But as for myself, it was a great combo of savory and sweet. 
I added maybe a teaspoon of salt to the sauce, and I didn't have agave nectar so I substituted it for sugar, but other than that followed the recipe.

Sounded way better than it tasted. I'm always nervous when a recipe doesn't call for salt and this one definitely needed it. The sauce actually tastes fantastic (once properly seasoned), but doesn't seem to go well with the other ingredients.

This was amazing! I used dry adzuki beans (soaked overnight then simmered for 45min-1hour) and forbidden rice. The contrast of the black rice with the bright stir fry was beautiful! We loved this!

This recipe was  a dissapointment.  I spent over an hour preparing it  only to discover that I am not a fan of lime, coconut, cilantro, and ginger.  I enjoy cooking with all of the items separate but together they were too overpowering.

I just made the sauce and used entirely different ingredients (chicken and other veggies). I added a teaspoon of soy sauce and used regular, not light coconut milk, but I thought it was great! I liked the coconut and ginger mix.

I absolutely love the combination of lime, coconut milk and ginger, so I knew I had to try out this recipe. I used canned coconut cream which is thicker and richer than regular coconut milk. Also used canned red beans as time didn't allow for a trip to the Asian store. Definitely agree that the sauce needs a salty element - I added fish sauce and a pinch of salt. The mango I used was slightly underripe, which I think worked well. Husband wasn't crazy about it, but my 2 year old and me scarfed it down. Served it with plain steamed white rice. Thanks, Tori!

I loved this sauce! Very refreshing. Everyone raved about it. It is a thin sauce and next time I will add some chili flakes to spice it up.

I had adzuki beans and mangoes that I needed to do something with, and came across this recipe. I made it exactly as written, and it turned out great! I actually caught my picky husband licking his second bowl clean. Served over jasmine rice. I will definitely make this again!

I've made this at least 10 times since I found this recipie. I have no idea where to find adzuki beans but black beans work well. It's really easy tweak with quinoa instead of rice or adding different veggies. Canned mango also works really well without the mess of cutting one up. It's a lightly sweetened flavored dish but I think the flavors work really well together

I made this a few days ago and was very happy with the results.  I used black beans instead of adzuki beans, a yellow onion instead of red, and added cumin, coriander, salt and pepper to the veggies while they were sautéing.  I also added fresh parsley to the sauce (accidentally, but it worked).  Served it over white Jasmine rice.  Next time - and there will be a next time - I'll be adding something just to give it a little kick. Thanks for sharing!

Added shrimp and this was fantastic.
