Very yummy recipe and was a hit for a large crowd of chocolate/peanut butter lovers:)  This recipe does take some time and I recommend using wax paper instead of a towel to roll up the cake in.  I also just sprinkled some powdered sugar instead of using the chocolate glaze on top.

This was definitely different than your typical pumpkin roll.  It was good with the peanut butter flavor in the middle of the chocolate cake, but my first one was a disaster.  So, for the peanut butter mixture, I substituted the whipping cream with cream cheese and it came out a lot better.  The whipping cream make the mixture runny.

I made this for our family dessert tonight but I accidently mis-read the ingredient where it says Reeses Peanut butter chips, I thought I read Reeses PB cups.  It was too late before I noticed so I use the PB Cups.  This filling was lush!  Also I didn't have any powdered suger for the frosting so I use the base recipe with about 3/4 - 1 cup of granulated sugar and boiled it for several minutes while stirring until smooth. I drizzled that over each cut piece.  The  dessert was a HIT!  There were 13 adults and we all just died for it.  I also used a very heavy whipping cream that I purchased from a restaurant supply.  It made it all the better, sinfully good.  This would be a hit anywhere except weight watchers! Thanks for this one!

I found the whipped cream center to be too runny as the other reviewer said. Although the cake itself looked perfect, it was not a great chocolate taste like I was expecting. My husband enjoyed it, though.

The chocolate cake is really good. I made this cake for my daughter's birthday, but I didn't follow the recipe beyond making the cake.  I made my own filling with 4 oz. cream cheese, some smooth peanut butter, 1 Tbsp. butter, some vanilla, powdered sugar, and a  little milk.  The combination of cake and peanut butter was incredibly delicious.  A note about bake time: don't overbake because it will cause the cake to be brittle and not roll easily or without cracking.

This was pretty good. The cake was slightly dry and I would recomend lining the jelly roll pan with parchment rather than aluminum foil - the foil had a tendency to stick. Also, I had a really difficult time with the glaze...the chocolate seized twice before I tried making it without the water and adding milk before pouring for the desired consistency. Next time I'll make a different glaze recipe. Went over pretty well, though.
