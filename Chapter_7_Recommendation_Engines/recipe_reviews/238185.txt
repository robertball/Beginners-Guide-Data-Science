10.19.18... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/238185/cinnamon-sugarloaf/... As bread o-kay; as toast muchhh better. I only added 2t cinnamon. With that it seemed like too much sugar. It isn't cake-sweet but a bit too sweet. The half & half gives a buttery flavor. This is a dense & on-the-dry-side loaf. I like panettone toasted too - rather than "straight.":)
