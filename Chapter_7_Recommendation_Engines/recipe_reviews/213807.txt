This is crunchy, sweet, sour and very, very colorful!  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with Bev's Orange Chicken from this site. A keeper!

Very good stir fry sauce! Easy and yummy! I used broccoli, zuchinni, and sliced portobella mushrooms and some seasame seeds! I cooked all the veggies by stir frying, and then added the sauce to warm it up and stired some cooked  brown rice with it. Next time I think I will add some fried tofu!

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a new "stir-fry" sauce and this was AWESOME! I didn't have any fish sauce on hand so I used 1/2 tbsp. more of soy sauce and 1/2 tbsp. more of oyster sauce. I am cooking it for the second time in the same week, which says a lot for me! Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious!  I did add a touch of chicken stock to the sauce just to thin it out a bit and calm the oyster sauce down for my taste.  I was worried about the cucumber and if I would like it cooked.  I liked it!  Forgot the peas :(  Oh well regardless I loved it!  Served over some warmed up leftover rice sprinkled with some chopped green onions for garnish!

This was so delicious! I found this easier to cook in a wok rather than skillet.

I made the sauce  using 2 T of regular cane sugar, and doubled the fish sauce as I had no oyster sauce.  Used vegetables I had on hand--onions, lots of peppers (one hot), shredded cabbage, a little broccoli, and 3 small tomatoes.  Substituted chick peas for the peas and used canned pineapple.  Very versatile!  Thank you!

This is very savory.  I made quite a few changes because of what I had available. Used agar instead of palm sugar, broccoli instead of cauliflower, orange juice instead of lime, chicken broth instead of fish sauce, no cucumber, corn, peas, or tomato. Squeezed 1/2 tsp lemon on veggies at very end before serving.  Super savory!

The sauce in this recipe has become a new family favorite for vegetable stir-fry side dishes.
