These were pretty good. It works best if you drop in some batter, then the cream cheese filling, then another drop of batter on top. This helps the cupcake bake upright. If you just put in the batter and drop the cream cheese filling on, then bake, they come out flat. I made my own buttercream frosting, with a few drops of almond extract.

These cupcakes were delightful. One suggestion - make sure the filling is placed in neatly and slightly indented in the mix. If not, it will not end up completely on the inside.

I don't have kids, but I made these on a "just because I feel like baking" day & brought them to work.  Everyone loved them.  They are yummy!!  I did use the mini chips, which adds to the cuteness level.

I had a blast making these! A few things I did differently were, I mixed half cool whip and half frosting, to ice the cupcakes, and I added sprinkles also. They turned out beautiful.

These cupcakes are very good!  My kids always request them when bringing a snack to class. I sometimes double the filling.

I made these for my husband's birthday dinner. Everyone liked them! I do agree that adding an extra spoon of cake mix on top of the cream cheese filling will help the cupcake to bake properly and keep the filling inside

I made these for a dog themed party and it was the first thing gone.  Everyone raved about them and they really were easy to make.
