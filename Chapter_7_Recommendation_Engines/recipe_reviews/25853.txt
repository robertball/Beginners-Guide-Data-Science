Very easy and quite popular at the office party today.  I substituted cranberry juice cocktail for most of the OJ, and added about 1/3 c. of peach schnapps and one orange thinly sliced and each slice quartered to the punch bowl.  2 colleagues asked for the recipe.  Next time I'll try it with the Edy's orange sherbet/vanilla ice cream instead of straight sherbet.

Very tasty punch and enjoyed by many, but it was quite 'frothy'--I had to constantly peel the foam from the top.  I also added frpzen strawberries (highly recommended) and a portion of cranberry juice which makes the mixture less orange'y'.

Very delicious and easy!  I made a few changes.  I'm not completely crazy about all orange tastes so I added strawberries and more champagne.  In addition, to make it more fruity, I added (believe it or not) fruit punch juicey packs (2) of them.  That really gave it good "tang".

I mixed all the ingredients an hour prior to serving (minus the sherbert).  I let it get cold in the refrigerator.  The reason I mixed it an hour prior is because I wanted the champagne to get soaked in by the strawberries.  

Awesome recipe and so flexible.

Husband gamely volunteered to provide the drinks for a small work function, then panicked because he didn't know what to do! I was relieved to learn that this recipe was a success! We made one batch as written, and another with mango sorbet; used about the cheapest champagne you can get too. He was able to freeze the pitchers before the party, and the punch stayed nice and cold the whole time. Great recipe, Owen. Thanks so much!

Made this for New Years and it was great.  We made it in a pitcher using raspberry ginger ale and raspberry sherbert omitting the oj and it was excellent.  Everyone loved it.  The guys were slightly embarrassed by the pink hue but they drank it anyway:) BTW I used 1 bottle champagne, about 2 c ginger ale and 1 pt sherbert.

Very Good!  2 bottles of champagne was more than we could drink, so I made it with 1 and it was very easy to scale down.

We've been making a version of this recipe for years and love it! We mix a gallon of orange juice with two bottles of champage. Pour the mix into a tall glass and add a tablespoon of orange sherbert on top.  We call our version Mississippi Mimosa. Enjoy!

This is delicious & soooo easy to make. It's a big hit everytime I make it. I do half the OJ & substitute it w/extra ginger ale b/c I found it to be a bit too "orangey" tasting. When I have time (& remember to put them in!), I freeze grapes & put them in to help keep it chilled. I make this at every party.

We had a Masquerade Ball this New Year's Eve and this was a hit (besides the firework show)!!! Frozen strawberries were a great add. We used plain orange sherbert and followed the rest of the recipe and we had everyone asking how to make it-- We had large pitchers filled the whole night!!!

Made this for a bridal shower this weekend.  I don't drink alcohol but judging from the comments our guests made and how quickly the first batch was consumed I'd say this was a hit!

This was a big hit at my New Year's Eve party last evening.  Even folks who turned their noses up at the idea of champagne punch with sherbet ended up enjoying it after tasting.  I took the advice of another reviewer and made it with raspberry instead of orange.  1 quart raspberry sherbet, 1 bottle champagne, 1 liter of cranberry Ginger ale, and frozen raspberrys as the "ice" to keep it cold.  Sherbet was rock solid and liquids were very well chilled.  It got better as the sherbet kept melting in it.

Perfect for New Years! Next time I will add another champagne and leave out the sherbet..when it melted there were little gummy parts floating around. I also used frozen strawberrys to keep cool. Def will make again and again!

I have made this for every major get together or holiday and everyone just loves it!  Make sure you tell those under 21 it has alcohol in it because it does look like a yummy soda/ice cream drink.  I have also made it without the champagne and it is still really good.

I have used this recipe on 2 big occassions, my daughters bridal shower in the spring and my annual Christams Tea.  It is a huge hit.  I give it 5 stars for ease of putting together, taste and guests' reactions.

This was really easy and a great way to dress up champagne (or get rid of a HUGE bottle of cheap champagne).  I also used only 1 liter of ginger ale, added a frozen ice cube of OJ (in the shape of a Christmas Tree) and frozen whole stawberries.  It was great!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party.  I halved the recipe.  It was good.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I did add orange slices in the punch.  I wish I would have added frozen strawberries.  I will make it again.

Fixes this for a holiday open house before NY eve.   Had to make 2 batches as everyone was diving in for another glass.  They said it tasted like a milk shake with a kick.

It was ok, though I was a bit disappointed.  Seemed like a sweeter version of a Mimosa.  Probably won't make it again.

This was a HUGE hit at a potluck I went to. It was a little messy looking, but it tasted amazing, so no one minded. I would definitely make it again!

I used Raspberry sherbet & cran-raspberry juice in stead of oj & orange sherbet, then followed the rest of the recipe.  I received rave reviews & the punch did not last long!!  Several requests were made for the recipe; one guest, who travels the world & can be quite fussy, said it was the best party punch she ever had!! I used Freixenet Brut (Spanish) sparkling wine/champagne; tastes expensive, but it's not.

This was meh. Expected this to be much more flavorful but it tastes very diluted and bland. Won't be making this again.

I was surprised some people said this wasn't a hit. My family thought it was delicious. I cut everything in half for 4 people.  The flavor was delicious not to sweet, but not dry either. It was perfect and I'll make it over and over again.

I had this at New Years and  I did not include the champagne.  Everyone at the party loved it and it ran out very quickly. I thought this was a simple and great recipe. I am going to be using this recipe again and again.

Made it for a bridal shower and it was a big hit!  Used mango sorbet instead of orange sherbert.  Only made half and it still almost filled the punch bowl! There was more than enough for 15 people.  Felt bad throwing out the left over but glad I didn't make the full recipie.
