The chicken had a nice flavor of lime, not too overpowering. I might put a few more spices in it the next time. I grilled instead and did not shred the chicken I just sliced it. So with some avocado, sour cream, salsa, peppers and onions all was a nice combination. I like having a fresh marinade recipe that is easy to make instead of buying something with preservatives, thanks recipe group.

Recipe Group Selection:  28, April 2012  I used all the listed ingredients, but changed the cooking method.  Due to time conflicts, I marinated the meat overnight and the next morning put the marinade and the chicken breast in the crockpot.  They cooked all day and I then took 2 forks and shredded the meat.  We had this for dinner as fajita's with grilled peppers, onions, lettuce and tomatoes.  Also served as a fajita salad using the same ingredients plus salsa as the dressing.  The lime flavor was very prominent with this method, but we really enjoyed the taste of the chicken.  I am going to make and  freeze burritos with the leftovers.  Thank you Lauren for sharing your recipe.  I think RG made a great selection for Cinco De Mayo.

I gave it 4 stars only because I doubled the spices and halved the lime juice based on the reviews.  We used the chicken to make tacos and we loved them.  The leftovers are wonderful on sandwiches.

I use lime when I make fajitas, but it is not the main ingredient of the marinade, so I thought I would try out this recipe.  I made it as directed, and it was not really what I was hoping for.  The lime dominated the other flavors, to the point that I could barely detect there was anything else in the marinade besides the citrus.  Normally, I squeeze 1/2 a lime over my chicken fajitas prior to serving, and I enjoy the brightness that gives.  Overnight in lime juice is much too long, also, as it changed the texture of the chicken and made it sort of grainy when cooked.  Probably won't make this again.

Good simple marinade with the kick of red pepper. The 2 things I did change was first adding cilantro to marinade. Second, I always slice the chicken before marinating, and grill the chicken, peppers, and onion mix on a George Foreman or like grill and serve with warm flour tortillas.

Made this for Recipe Group...This was very good, but I felt the lime was a bit much, IMO (though I cannot fault the recipe b/c I did it differently). I sliced my chicken and threw it into the marinade w/ sliced onions and green and red peppers, and marinated all of that overnight. I then drained off the liquid and cooked it in a pan on the stove until it was done. It had great flavor, just a bit too lime-y for me (hubby liked it as it was). I served this on warmed flour tortillas w/ shredded cheddar, tomatoes, sour cream and salsa. Very nice dinner! I would def make this again (just reduce the lime juice)! Thanks for sharing. :)

Like others, I was worried about 8 hours in lime juice "cooking" the chicken. It was not an issue at all. I had smallish breast pieces, thin like cutlets, so it only took 1/2 cup lime juice and one Tbl oil to cover them with the marinade. I used the full amount of spices but I feel like once the meat's "surrounded" any additional liquid is just wasted. I marinated the full 8 hours, turning the bag a couple of times and then grilled them, which didn't really lend to shredding so I sliced it for tacos. The lime flavor is pretty strong but we like lime and chicken is so boring. I don't think I would prefer this just as a piece of chicken but in the tacos or on a salad the lime really adds to the dish, in my opinion.  I made this for recipe group, good pick.

Made this for the weekly recipe group. I followed the marinating instructions and ingredients except I accidentally put in a teaspoon of cumin and chili powder instead of 1/2 tsp, but that turned out to be a good thing because I think it benefited with the extra spice. The chicken was very tender, but a bit strong on the lime flavor for us. I'd try it again but will cut down the amount of lime and add a bit more spices (we are just spice lovers here). We enjoyed the fajitas and felt it was a nice healthy meal. We topped with stir fried bell peppers, onions, jalape√±os, fresh avocado slices and cheddar cheese. Served with a nice ear of corn on the cob.

Made for Recipe Group. This definitely had a strong citrus flavor with a lack of spices. The juice needs to be cut back and up the mexican flavors on the spices. Thanks for the recipe.

Recipe Group selection of 4/28/11.  I had rather large BLSL chix, so I sliced them before I marinated them.  I used the full amount of lime and thought the flavor was fine.  What I found lacking were the other flavors so I would increase the cumin, chili powder and red pepper.  We will make these again.  I think the chicken would be wonderful on the grill.  Thanks for sharing, Lauren!

I made this for Recipe Group. It was quite good - I did reduce the lime juice to 1/2 of what was called for, but other than that followed the recipe and chopped, rather than shredded the final product. I used this chicken to make "Southwest Chicken Quesadillas" also from AR.

I used this as a basic idea for what I made.  I only marinaded it for a few hours, I think overnight might have overpowered it as it was a really strong lime scent.  I added a can of diced tomatoes to the marinade.  This was really yummy with onions/yellow bell pepper.  I will probably do it again made my way.  Great combo of flavors though.

I didn't use this as a marinade, I just plopped all the ingredients in the crock pot and set it for low. At about 7 hours, I shredded the chicken, and we ate it an hour later. It was so delicious. After dinner, my husband said he then needed some dessert and went straight for the chicken again. Thank you for the recipe!

It was great! I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon. It turned out great but I think next time I will cut back on the lemon or lime juice and replace with something else. I would highly  recommend.
