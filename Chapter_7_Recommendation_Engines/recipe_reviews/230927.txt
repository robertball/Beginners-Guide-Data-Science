I made this with half and half and the sauce curdled when I added the lemon. I don't know if having full fat cream would have made a difference? Acid + dairy=curds. Next time I will add the lemon juice at the end.

This was tasty. Added some red peppers cause I needed to use them, and used boxed spaghetti noodles. Only recommendation would be to get the water boiling first then start making the sauce, that way the meal is prepared in a more timely manner.

This was a nice change from the normal pasta dishes.  I liked the freshness the peas and lemon gave the dish.  Definitely a summer meal.

Loved the flavor.  Didn't have any problems with curdling, though I added the lemon after the cream.   Didn't have any fresh sage so substituted ground sage at last minute.....a mistake as it affected the color.  Lesson learned......definately need fresh sage.  Taste was still very good though.

This was a lovely addition to my Easter dinner. The freshness of flavors was so nice.
