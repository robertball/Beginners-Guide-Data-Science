I did tweak this one. I took everyone's advice... Cut back on the butter, only 1/4 Honey, cut up the nuts & carrots more so they didn't sink to the bottom & I tossed in a dash of garlic powder & chopped a small 1/4 onion -Onion in the carrot mixture & garlic went in the egg... This is great! It was a hit & fun to hear my son tell me how he was so surprised that it wasn't awful like most other quiche recipes! lol (He normally doesn't care for Quiche!)

After reading the reviews, I made a few changes to the recipe. 
I shredded the carrots in the food processor, and used another attatchment to break up the cashews into smaller pieces. With the previous comments on the carrots and nuts settling to the bottom, I think that might solve part of the issue. Mine was loaded from top to bottom.
I skipped the honey completely and added more egg (I never measure my quiche mix. It's just habit). 
I tossed the carrots and nuts with the cheese before filling with the egg mixture. Since I had enough to fill 2-3 shells, I added spinach to one shell. Fantastic.

great idea on flavors--the technique just needed a litle tweaking.

Simply nice, so very, very nice. I loved it and thought a nice salad would have been so nice with this nice quiche. But alas, only crude cupboard items were at hand - what a pity!

After reading the other reviews here, I was thinking that maybe these flavors were going to be too weird for us in a quiche, but we totally loved this. It got even better the next day as well. Other than lightly chopping up the carrots and cashews in a food processor, I didn't change a thing. I served this with the avocado quick bread also on this website. A great brunch or light lunch dish and we thought delicious either hot or cold. Thanks for the recipe!

This dish has a lot of potential. I think it's way too heavy on the heavy cream, which tends to overwhelm the eggs and makes you forget that it's a quiche. Also, the next time I make it, I'll cut way back on the honey.

Fantastic recipe but I decreased butter to 1 tablespoon; crushed the cashews; decreased honey to 1/4 cup and changed heavy cream to milk and only used 1 cup.

Really enjoyed this - always looking for something different - Got rid of the honey and used fat free half and half. Chopped the carrots and cashews in food processor.  Will make it again

I'd like to rate this higher, but the flavor, while good, was not stellar. As my daughter and I ate it, we were thinking, it wants to be sweeter or it wants more egg and something like onion and/or garlic flavor. With the nutmeg and honey, it wanted to be dessert, but because of the egg, carrots, cashews, and cheddar, it wanted to be something else.

The taste was incredible and everyone loved it.  However, there is more than enough saturated fat in this!  Cut the butter to 3 Tbs (seriously) and use half and half instead of cream and this will actually be better (it is too fat as written, it's awfully heavy).  This could even be reduced further and still have the great flavor.  This is going to be a new staple meal and I can't wait to serve it at church functions.

This is a very unique and tasty recipe.  It was all the rage at a potluck brunch I attended.  I altered the recipe by adding one more egg to give it a bit of bulk and reducing the honey to about 1/3 C.  The one problem with the recipe is that I found that the cheese and carrot mixture stayed at the bottom while the egg rose to the top--it didn't all mix together the way quiche usually does, and I'm not quite sure why this happened.  This made the quiche hard to eat because the carrots and cashews kept tumbling around the plate.

I agree with the comment that this tastes almost too heavy to be a quiche, next time I will cut down on the butter, honey & cream a bit to see if that helps.  
It was nice to try this recipe and even my meat & potatoes hubby enjoyed!

Huge success at our Mother's Day brunch.  My picky mom and meat-loving hubby and step-dad took  second helpings.  Like other reviewers, I was bummed about the carrots and cashews settling on the bottom but clearly, it didn't bother my guests!  Also, I only put in 1/3 c honey, which was perfect for me.  I will make this again and recommend it to my vegetarian sister!

Still not sure on this one.  A little too sweet for my liking even with the following changes:  1/4 C. butter, shredded carrots, chopped cashews, 2 Oz. honey, 1 C. heavy cream & 1/2 C. milk. It was good; it's just that I prefer a more savory flavored quiche.

I didn't really like this, neither did the kids.  Hubbs did, hence the 2 stars.  It was way too sweet, felt like more of a dessert.  I was interested in the carrot/cashew combo, but this didn't work for me.  I won't make it again.

I was intrigued by this flavor combination.  Basically, I like it a lot, but it was just too heavy the first time I made it. So I reduced the amount of butter rather drastically to a mere tablespoon -- just enough to saute the carrots and nuts without sticking.  I also reduced the honey to just 2 tablespoons and replaced the cream with half-and-half.  I took the advice of other reviewers and chopped both the carrots and nuts in a food processor, but I don't think I'll do that again.  Just as the flavors in a stew are more distinct when the veggies are in larger chunks, so the nuts need to be more distinct and less all-pervasive.  But I'll definitely look forward to making it again in the future, probably when I'm serving savory quiches at the same meal for variety.

I agree with the other reviewers that there is too much honey - I only added 2Tbl and it was still too sweet. Otherwise, both my 2-year old and I ate it up! Yum!

This recipe is a hit, even with the non-quiche eaters. I'm delighted to call it a dessert quiche.

This was very different!!  I'm still not sure about the flavors.  If i do make this again i would cut the honey in half and probably chopped my nuts a little finer.  Its a unique different option for Quiche so i gave it 4 stars for creativity!

I made two versions of this quiche recently - one as published, and one with tweaking.  

After reading the reviews, I wanted to try a version that was a little more savory, so I cut the honey in half, and added a teaspoon of curry powder.

Unfortunatley, neither of the versions turned out to be very tasty.  I think the base recipe (without my tweaking) was the better quiche.  If I were to make it again I would probably add a little more salt.

I left out the honey altogether, added a bit of oregano, fresh parsley and pepper to make it completely savoury - although the carrots and cashews ensured a sweetish taste anyway. Loved it!
