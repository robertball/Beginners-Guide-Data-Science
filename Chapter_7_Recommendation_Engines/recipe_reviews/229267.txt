My report is just a little different from the others because somehow the flavors just seemed like they were swimming in oil and couldn't be savored.  I wondered if there was an error in the amount of oil.  I tried to cook down the sauce after removing the chicken, but that didn't really work.  The chicken itself turned out moist and tasty, but I had to dunk the leftovers in Trader Joe's Sweet Chili Sauce (a nice complement).  I think I will try this again using only a tablespoon or so of oil and orange juice concentrate----or maybe the orange juice, a little oil, and Dijon mustard.  I'll give it another try!  Sorry about my review!

Really good and fresh tasting. I was glad to see a citrus recipe that didn't automatically turn to an Asian flavor. This didn't really make a glaze. It was mostly liquid, but really good flavor. I will definitely make this again!

This so good! I put everything together (half the salt because I'm on a sodium restricted diet)in a large plastic zip-lock bag breaking up the orange zest in the bag and marinated it for an hour. I took the chicken out onto the baking sheet and poured 1/2 the liquid over all of it and baked it for 1/2 hour. It wasn't as brown as the photo but it was definitely orangy and very moist. I highly recommend!

Great and easy recipe. I switched mustard with cumin but still game out great! Very good meal to make in the week or ahead of time to heat up during the week.

This wasn't terrible, however, it was very bland.  I also added cumin along with the paprika as someone mentioned cumin in a review.  The "sauce" never really turned into a sauce.  It was more of a juice.  The chicken was juicy, but not very appealing.  Everyone ate it, but I wouldn't make it again.

I added all the ingredients except for the mustard and substituted that with cummin. I also added 3 tsp of brown sugar hoping it gave me the syrup consistency in the sauce but it didn't. It did add a nice flavor to it but it was still kind of bland. My husband wasn't impressed but my kids LOVED it. My 2 and 1 yr old both had seconds.

I just made this and it's good but I would use lemons instead of orange next time. I did cut the oil in half and used corn starch to thicken sauce after removing cooked chicken.  Will do again. Thanks for a simple recipe.

I made this tonight and my family liked it, however i think the 1/2 cup of oil is a little excessive.. 
I cooked this in my pressure cooker then baked it for 15 minutes at 400 for a crispy edge.

I should've read the reviews before I made this recipe. I was the only one who really liked it. The reviews by my family were "fine" and one person refused to have the sauce.

I think the main problem is that there seems to be WAY too much oil in the sauce. It seemed to dilute the flavor. It also definitely isn't a glaze. It was just liquid. I thickened it after baking which helped a little, and TRIED to skim off the oil...but that didn't seem to do much. 

I'd like to try it again with less oil â€“ but I don't think anyone would eat it after tonight's dinner unfortunately. 

On the plus side the chicken came out moist. So maybe the juicy sauce helped with that?

I agree with other reviewers' comments that this recipe was tasty enough; however, if I were to make it again I'd use only a fraction of the oil. I'd also likely add more cayenne and orange zest, maybe try the cumin for more zing. Tender, tasty but a bit mild.

Great tasting meal and simple preparation! I made some white rice and broccoli to go with the chicken and to mop up the sauce.

Placing aluminum foil in the baking tray saved me lots of clean-up!

I didn't have vegetable oil, so I used not quite a 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I also put the chicken and the sauce in a baggie to marinate for about an hour.  It was delicious.  The entire family loved it.

Not really impressed with this recipe. Though the chicken was nice and moist it lacked flavor to the point that the inside tasted like plain boiled chicken. Followed the recipe exactly and it didn't even get your typical glaze. Very bland dish.

I probably won't make this again, but if I did, I would brown the chicken and use WAY less oil. What's the point of using skinless chicken breasts if you use half a cup of oil? The flavors are good but the sauce doesn't cook down, so they are not concentrated. Ultimately, this is a bland, high-fat meal.

Only one teaspoon of oil. Based on other comments I tried a little corn starch to thicken the sauce and would use more next time. Also soaked chicken in sauce first and then dipped in plain bread crumbs before pouring over the chicken in the baking dish. Seemed to work.

I made a few changes, 1/4 cup of oil ,added 1/4 cup more juice. I also added onion powder and basil one ts each, as for the sauce I only used half on meat in slow cooker saved the rest to make a gravy using powder gravy mix to thicken the sauce. on the stove . to make a cup for gravy I mixed the rest of liquid with orange juice. the chicken came out moist and with the gravy was very good.

I'll make this again as it was super moist and had a nice appearance even though the chicken wasn't browned before baking.  But I'll cut way back on the oil, as it was much much more than needed.  Didn't think the flavor was outstanding, but the orange and spices made for a very pleasant combination.

I could not taste any orange flavor and there was no glaze - just a lot of oil that the chicken was swimming in.

I used just 1 tbsp of olive oil, and the flavor was great-- really light and refreshing. A half cup of oil seemed excessive and would have weighed the chicken down. As others mentioned, a glaze never forms, just an orangey soup, but it's overall a yummy dinner.

Followed the recipe exactly but the end result was too bland and too liquid-y. The 4 stars are because it had a lot of promise - the meat was very juicy - I used breast meat as well as thighs. The next time I added 1/4 c. Thai Chili Sauce, 1/4 c. brown sugar, a little vinegar and more orange juice mixed with cornstarch to thicken it up.  The thickened sauce stuck to the chicken really well - the meat acquired a beautiful color from baking. Served with steamed rice and cut up sauteed fresh asparagus.

A nice change for the standard chicken breast. Served it with toasted brown rice - plenty of sauce and very healthy. :-)
