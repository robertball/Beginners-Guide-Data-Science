To be honest, I never tried the recipe "as is" so I'm not sure that I am qualified to give it a star rating...  However, the dish that this recipe inspired was fabulous!  We used a 1.25 lb swordfish steak instead of chicken; a can of pineapple rings instead of chunks (the large can, so extra juice, but only used about 3/4 of the juice in the marinade); 3 garlic cloves crushed into the marinade  and the juice of one lime; olive oil instead of Crisco(R); we roasted a whole red pepper black, then peeled it and diced the entire thing into the salad; we grilled one small onion sliced and all the pineapple rings, then chopped the onion and all but 4 pineapple rings into chunks and put them in the salad (the reserved rings were eaten as snacks and used for garnish);  We used one small serrano chile, roasted black, peeled, seeded, chopped into the salad. Then we served the fish with the salad relish on top on a plate with carribean baked black beans (added orange juice, garlic, cumin and honey mustard to the beans) and a wild rice/brown rice blend sauteed before adding cooking water, in olive oil with cumin and cinnamon until wild rice roasted, then added the remaining pineapple juice to the cooking water.     We then garnished the plates with low-salt roasted peanuts and cilantro.  Awesome tasting and visually beautiful meal.  Fried plantains on the side would have been a lovely addition.

This recipe is fantastic! I pretty much double the amount of the salsa...Extra spices, 2 cans pineapple, and used 1 green, orange, yellow and red pepper for extra flavor.  I also omitted the sugar...Served it for a dinner party of 6, and it was a hit! Thank you!

This is wonderful!  The only changes we made were to double the amount of pineapple (to allow for massive quantities of pre-dinner tasting)and set aside 2 Tbsp. of the marinade to add to the pineapple. Since the rain here in SoCal hasn't been conducive to grilling, the broiler worked just fine.  Can't wait to try it on the grill!

I followed the recipe exactly....mostly.  I did do like another reviewer suggested and reduced the marinade and then added about a tsp of corn starch to 1/4 cup orange juice and mixed it into the marinade.  I loved the Pineapple Salad, which is really more like a pineapple salsa, my daughter and husband weren't fans, but my son was.  I did pulse it a couple times in the food processor to break up the chunks.  This will absolutely be  on the menu in the future.

Wow! This is so good!  The only thing I did different was  used fresh pineapple and added fresh mangoes to the  pineapple salad.  I served it with rice.  Yummy!

These were wonderful!  Tender and juicy...I marinated for about an hour.  Next time I will marinate longer.

Great recipe!  I like lots of flavor so I used more pineapple & basically tripled all of the marinade ingredients, I also used two large jalapeno peppers in the salad instead of one small.  I reserved the marinade while the chicken was grilling & reduced it by half in a sauce pan & added cornstarch.  After straining it drizzle a little over the chicken.  This is very pretty & colorful dish, I served it with cilantro rice.  This would be an easy dish that looks & tastes great for company, I will make it again (soon)!

Fabulous! The longer you marinate it, the better the flavor.

The chicken was just all right. It didn't really taste like anything except for chicken. We didn't taste the marinade at all and I let it marinade for 2 hours. The salad on the other hand was delicious.  We ended up putting it on top of the chicken and eating that way.  Next time I think I will bake the chicken with the salad on top for more flavor.

I made the full amount of marinade and pineapple salad for just two chicken breast halves.  I used brown sugar for the white, used a mix of red and orange bell pepper, and I subbed parsley for the cilantro.  I reserved some of the marinade to use as a basting sauce and marinated my chicken for about 1 1/2 hours before grilling.  Even though I had hoped the basting would add flavor, both Hubs and I thought the chicken was sort of bland.  The pineapple salad, however, was quite good, although I think it would have been much, much better with fresh pineapple.  I might compare this to other similar recipes and see if it can be improved.

We liked this, and it was a great opener to summer for our grilling season! I used fresh pineapple, so I had to make up the juice, and used regular canned juice that I had on hand. I am sure glad I used that fresh pineapple - it didn't matter for the marinade, but it was fantastic in the salad! Next time, I would marinate longer, and probably poke the chicken with a fork before marinating the make sure that delicious flavor really permeated the main dish!

Wow! This is good stuff! Very fresh and packed with flavor. Only difference is I doubled the pineapple salad ingredients (which I find is much like a fruit salsa, it tastes great with corn chips) and the marinade. I also used semi-fresh pineapple (the kind in jar in refrigerated section of store) cutting the cubes into 1/2 inch pieces. Loved the salad on top of the chicken so you get a little bit with every bite of chicken. YUM!

I followed the directions exactly except I did not use canned pineapple because I didn't have any. I did however have fresh pineapple. Because fresh does not have that 1 cup of liquid the marinade asks for I popped some of the fresh pineapple into my food processor and made a cup of pureed pineapple to take the place for the juice. It worked decently. Grilled on my indoor grill. Be sure to clean out the ribs and seeds of the jalapeno well for the pineapple salad or it will have bite! SO good! Will make this again! I just loved the salad over the chicken.

We made the recipe as is. I thought the chicken was a little bland even though we marinated it overnight. The pineapple salad was good but I think it would have been better with fresh pineapple.

Love love love the pineapple salad - it really made the dish.  As others have mentioned, the chicken itself was rather bland (which was surprising as I marinated it a good 2 hours).  This would be delicious with a teriyaki type sauce to go along with the chicken and (in our case) the rice we served along side.
