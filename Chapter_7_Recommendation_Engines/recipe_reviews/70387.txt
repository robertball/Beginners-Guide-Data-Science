Followed recipe to the letter - and when springform pan (sides) were removed, cheesecake did not retain shape... It literally started to slowly spill out onto the counter.  Needless to say, this recipe was a disaster - and I sure won't use this one again.  Seriously - what's supposed to hold it together?  It's not baked, so there's no eggs... yet there's no gelatin to keep it firm...  Ricotta cheese isn't firm enough to hold a shape - and yet there's nothing in the recipe to help it along...  Very odd.

I must have done something wrong, the only thing I changed was using a store-bought crust instead of making my own, and I didn't put the whipped cream on top. It came out grainy and the crust got soggy by the time it set, because the cheese separated after it was mixed... It tasted pretty good, but the texture was pretty bad. I'll try it again and see what's up, though.
