This recipe is really great, I have been making it for a couple of years now out of a Lipton recipe cookbook.  The main difference in the Lipton book is you use 16 ounces of sour cream rather than one cup.  This cuts down on the saltiness of the dish and the texture is creamier.  I also add 1/4 cup chopped pepperoni.  Whenever I ask someone what I can bring to a party, this is what they request!

This is great, but has to be eaten hot.  As it cools it gets too thick and hard to scoop (why it lost a star).  
I added chopped pepporoni to mine and served with ritz crackers.  Everyone loved it and there was none left over.

A very good appetizer. I made it on Memorial Day for a cookout and everyone filled up on it. I loved it with French bread chunks!

The idea is awesome but it is way to salty(due to the whole dry herb & garlic soup pkt to the 1 cup sour cream). I added some minced green onions, some diced pepperoni, red bell peppers in with the mix and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. My friends and family couldn't finish the bowl and I ended up tossing what was left. However, I really like the idea of this so I might try 16oz of sour cream and maybe half a pkg of the soup mix and see how it goes. It DOES have the taste of pizza...if it hadn't been so salty.

This is awesome. If you mix in all the mozzarella, instead of putting some on top, you can serve it cool and it wont clump.

When I served this everyone went right to it. Thanks to other reviewers suggestions, I added 2 cups of sour cream and that cut back on the saltiness. I also diced some pepperoni, baked it for 10 minutes to get some of the oil out, and added that to the mix. This makes a ton so be prepared, you'll need extra bread. Merry Christmas!

My kids scarfed this down!!!  I didn't have enough ricotta, so I used half ricotta and half french onion dip.  I added chopped pepperoni "after" (because of the grease) removing from the oven.  Only used 1 teaspoon of the dry packet seasoning. Although the dip didn't look too appetizing, I will make again.

Love this recipe!  Have made it four times in the last two weeks and will make again for this coming weekend.  Very easy to make & everyone loves it, kids included.  I added prepackaged pepperoni slices chopped up each time and one time I added sauteed mushrooms (diced), too.  EXCELLENT.  Also, stir in some extra mozz. cheese to the dish before cooking (and some on the top as suggested).  Wonderful!!  Great with the French bread and the new flatbreads.

This is a GREAT DIP!!!  Very easy, and travels well.  I do add the pepperoni, and also cut up extra bread.....I toast the bread, brushing w/ olive oil that I have heated w/ crushed garlic.  I double the recipe b/c this one goes fast.  Everything can be done ahead, including the bread....just pop it into a ziploc bag!

This dip is so incredibly AWESOME!!  I added grated parmesan cheese to the mixture and some to the top under the mozzarella.  I also put the whole amount of mozzarella into the dip and more on top to make it extra cheesy and delicious.  I wasn't sure if I should use whole milk ricotta or part skim so I used part skim, and it was fine.  I also made it a little earlier in the day and pulled it out of the refrigerator to take the chill off when I turned on the oven to preheat it.  My guests and I really loved this dip.  I will definitely make this on a regular basis.

I was looking for an alternative to the regular spinach and nacho dips...this dip worked out really well. It was a hit with everyone! I added green peppers and tomato-which worked out well. I also broiled the dish for the last couple of minutes so the cheese would brown. I would recommend this recipe.

Love, love, love it!  Sometimes I can't find the soup mix though so I just use an "Italian seasoning" spice and it's just as good!

I made exactly as the recipe stated but I found it too runny. It was better after it sat for an hour. Next time I think I would add cream cheese. I agree it also had a grainy texture from the ricotta. I gave it 4 stars because even though I wasn't crazy for it a few people told me it was excellent and there was none leftover! I served with italian bread chunks and bagel chips.

Edited 11/12: I made this yesterday for a football party subbing 8oz of cream cheese for the ricotta. It was gone in 15 minutes and I had to whip up another batch!! With that sub I would give this 5 stars!!

I've made this numerous times, all to rave reviews.  After baking, it sits well on a buffet line for hours in a fondue or crock pot.  Pepperoni, sausage, red pepper flakes, mushrooms and/or artichoke hearts make great additions. I've also used pita wraps cut in triangles and crunchy breadsticks as dippers.

This dip was awesome!  I did add the pepperoni, and got rave reviews! People were asking if it was alfredo sauce, and that gave me an idea,  so I used this recipe,  left out the pepperoni and added 2 cans of crabmeat, and made crab stuffed mushrooms... they were to die for.

I made this for a Super Bowl Party.  It was a huge hit.  I browned Italian Sausage and mushrooms and added it to the dip.  It was great.  I brought what was left over to work and have given out the recipe to 5 people.  What a find!  Thanks

I have been making this recipe for years and absolutely LOVE it!!  I serve it with plain bread sticks and garlic bagel crisps. I have never been able to find herb & garlic soup mix so I use 1-2Tbs of Mrs. Dash garlic & herb seasoning.

This is an awesome recipe! I took it to work for a Potluck and everyone loved it. I didnt have herb and garlic soup mix, so I added 2 lg cloves of garlic (minced) some seasalt and pepper to taste. I also added a tablespoon of oregano and chopped up 2 green onions into the mix. It gave it a nice splash color. I'm sure the soup mix tastes as good and it would be quicker yet. Thank you for sharing this Juliet!

This was very tasty -- and versitle.  I added scallions and it was a big hit.  Would also be very good with other "traditional" pizza toppings -- I'm thinking spinach next time!

Very good dip, I made it with sliced french brend, toasted in the oven with garlic powder and parmesean cheese sprinkled on them.  Next time I think I will add some italian sausage or pepperoni or something to give it more than just a great cheesey flavor.

This was inhaled. I stirred in about a half cup of chopped pepperoni and sprinkled fresh parmesan on top. This came out of the oven and we swarmed. As is, it's a solid dip. Only thing I might change for next time is maybe add my own spices. My boys didn't care but I might like some fresh basil, oregano, and maybe some red pepper flake? Maybe some chunks of onion? I agree with Navy Mommy. This really should be eaten hot UNLESS you have a food processor to meld the ingredients together and make it smooth. Bagel chips went awesome with this.

Everyone at my New Years Eve party loved this!  I had loads of guests asking what was in it.  One remarked that it was like a liquid white pizza - lol!  I did put in a bit more sour cream than was called for to finish up a container, and added some pepperoni.  We dipped with some yummy multigrain crackers and it was perfect!  Delicious served piping hot.

Wow, this was fantastic! I added chopped pepperoni like the Lipton box suggested but I stuck to the 8oz of sour cream instead of 16 like the box recipe says. I cut thin slices of french bread for dipping and heated it in the oven first. Yum!I used low fat ricotta and regular sour cream.

I used fresh ricotta from a cheese shoppe and it was absolutely delicious. It made all the difference. For those who can get fresh ricotta (from a salumeria) try it. It really does remind you of white pie.

Great appetizer! I couldn't find herb and garlic soup mix, so I can't remember what I used...it was either some type of garlic OR herb soup mix. This was sooo good! I also added pepperoni like another reviewer, and it was delicious! I think next time I will serve this with homemade toasted, garlic crostini. I may also whip in some cream cheese since I don't particularly care for the texture of ricotta. This has nothing to do with the recipe though, just personal preference! Excellent recipe!

I couldn't find the herb and garlic soup mix anywhere so I used herb and garlic salad dressing mix.  It turned out just fine.  I took it to a potluck and received RAVE reviews and had to email out the recipe afterward. I will make this again for sure.

My Mom made this when I was younger and I loved it.  I kept the recipe and I've made it several times for parties and its always a hit.  I had to switch my seasoning packet to tastefully simple bc I cannot find Lipton Garlic & Herb soup mix in any of my local grocers :(  But thank heavens for tastefully simple - so I can keep making this!

Boring.....I was expecting so much more out of this recipe after reading the reviews.  It was totally bland, and I even added some chopped pepperoni to mine.  Out of all the appetizers we had for Easter, this one was barely touched.

Yummy!*!*!  I mixed this the night before, then added pepperoni and cheese (including some parmesan) before heating.  I toasted thin slices of french bread brushed w/ olive oil.  I also added the 16 oz of sour cream as recommended by other reviewers.  Will make again!!

Great party dip recipe.  It was a huge success.  I made this twice and the second time i just mixed the mozzarella in with it and didn't add it to the top.  The first time the top browned too much.
  Also make sure you double the recipe.

Very Easy and great tasting Dip. I made it for a family party and everyone ate it up. I did as others have suggested and upped the amount of sour cream (mostly because I didn't want just a little sour cream left in the container) and added about half a stick of pepperoni that I pulsed in the food processor. Instead of bread I baked cut up some pita bread into triangles and baked them to make pita chips. And be prepared for leftovers unless you have a lot of people- It makes a lot! But that wasn't a problem for us, it reheats fine.

So-so.  I've been making a tradition pizza dip with red sauce for years.  Always a big hit.  I figured a white version of this would be awesome.  My guests like it -- but I thought it lacked flavor.  I did add pepperoni, lots of fresh garlic and some fresh herbs.   Think I'll stick to the red sauce version.

I just didn't like this dip. It lacked a richness,I think cream cheese could have helped. The texture is not appealing, because of the ricotta, it isn't smooth, it has a grainy feel. I won't make this again.

This recipe is so easy, and so delicious!  If you are looking for a truly easy, comfort-food type of appetizer, this is it! I think you have to be a cheese lover though, as some of my guests did not like it as much as others. I used the one cup of sour cream and found the texture to be just right.

Dip was very good. Used 16 oz. of low fat sour cream and didn't add any extras. Found it to be a bit runny, so only gave it 4 stars. Maybe it was the "low fat" that made it runny. Will make again though.

This was a huge hit at a Birthday Party last weekend. Everyone loved it! I made it exactly as written adding extra mozzarella on top with some of fresh parsley. It was a last minute decision after I realized I did not have all of the ingredients for the original recipe I was going to make.

I loved this dip, when I could still find the garlic herb Lipton soup mix, but I cannot anymore and there's no other way to make it??

This was good and went over well at a holiday picnic - used 2 pints of sour cream (per other reviewers) and made my own garlic spice mix (per recipe on here) - topped 1/2 with black olives and 1/2 with pepperoni.  Held up well through the day and got great reviews.  Personally, felt like this was too much "creamy" and not enough substance for a dip.  Still overall a good recipe.

The flavor is creamy, cheesy garlicky and delicious. Next time we'll be eating it with Tomato Basil Wheat Thins instead to give it even more "pizza" flavor!

I made this with with few modifications. I put all the mozzarella into the dish (none on top) and I added turkey pepperoni. I really didn't need the pepperoni though. this is such a great tasting dip. it would also make a great pasta sauce.

Made this for my holiday party and it was the first dip to go!! I only used 1/2 of the soup mix and added in oregano.  I scooped the dip onto warm crostini's and added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. They were gone in minutes!!

Tastes just like white pizza! Everyone loved it. I prepared it in a slow cooker. If you do that, make sure you don't leave it there too long cause the bottom does turn a little golden.

Love it! I make it with turkey pepperoni and i double the cheese. When I reheat it the next day I throw it in my mixer and mix the pepperoni into it so it's a red/beige color and then I add a few more pepperonis in it and rebake it for 10-15 and it's just as adored as the first night.

My friend started this recipe and it never lasted long at our get togethers! So I had to steal the recipe! She has always made it in the crockpot, which keeps it from getting to cold and hard to dip out. You can also substitute the herb and garlic dry packets with Liptons Onion Soup and dip mix dry packet. I would definately suggest using the double amount of sour cream. We both have always just used the pepperoni slices,diced. This will also help with grease not being such a problem by thinning out your dip. This is by far a crowd please!!

Was kind of monotone in flavor. Next time I do this I'll try different kinds of cheese to mix in. I saw this recipe in a cookbook but it called for 2 cups of sour cream, not 1 which may explain why some said it was too salty. I added oregano and chives.

WOW! Wish I could give this ten stars! I substituted 1/3 less fat cream cheese for the ricotta based on other reviewers comments and used 16 oz. of light sour cream and it was still very very rich and delicious! I also added diced turkey pepperoni and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. I cooked it in the oven for 30 minutes, then broiled it for three minutes and kept it warm in a crockpot  for as long as it lasted, but that was Not long! LOL Try this and you will not be disappointed!!

I substituted 1 cup cream cheese for the ricotta as I had a feeling it would be  too grainy for my liking, and after I read the other reviews I didn't want to chance it.  It came out wonderful!!  I give it 5 stars for the substitution I made, and for not wanting to penalize a recipe just because I didn't follow the original ingredients!!

Very good! Definitely use the real mozzarella cheese. I did fat free by accident and it made the consistency different and it did not taste as good. The taste is in the fat! And it won't hurt once in a while. Very good dip, though.

I only added about 1/2 the package of the soup mix, but I still found the garlic to be over-powering. I liked that this dip was different from the norm, but I can't say I would make again. It just didn't impress me that much.

I liked this O.K. Need to eat it fast. Looked pretty and tasted pretty good for the first few bites but then it just lost interest. Added chopped pepperoni that I had partially cooked in the microwave in order to get some of the fat out.

Maybe I messed this up by putting it in a small crockpot to heat it and keep it warm, rather than heating it in the oven.  I did add some diced pepperoni, with the fat rendered in a skillet first.  I just didn't care much for the flavor, or the texture.

Excellent dip!  Glad to have a new and easy recipe for my "party food" collection.  I used 16oz. of sour cream and added pepperoni also.  It was perfect and everyone really enjoyed it.  Thanks!
