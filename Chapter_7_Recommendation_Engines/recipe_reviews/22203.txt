I have always loved these since I was a kid.  I like to mix and match cereals.  One of my favorites is 1/2 rice krispies and 1/2 fruity pebbles.  I also like to fill the middle.  You just separate the recipe.  Press half into a lightly greased 8x8 pan, then spread with whatever filling you prefer.  You can do peanut butter, chocolate chips, jam, frosting, whatever sounds good.  Then, press the second half over carefully. 
This is a really fun recipe to play with, so get creative.  Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar, add sprinkles or your favorite candy, or use cookie cutters and make shapes.  I really like the sushi idea.  Very cute! 
Today I made them with a variety of cereal I had on hand.  I did two cups of each Rice Krispies, Cheerios, and Kix.  My kids love them and when I make them with whole grain cereals, it turns out to be a very healthy treat!
Tips for the stickiness:
Lightly spray your spatula, knife, cookie cutters, and hands with a butter cooking spray.  This will make it much easier to spread, cut, and handle the treats!
Thanks for the basic recipe!

was cleaning out the pantry and used all sorts of cereal mixed together with great results (wheat chex, kashi go lean, kashi good friends, toasted oats, rice crispies). I also added a heading 1/2 cup shredded coconut to it - YUM! As I was mixing in the cereal it seemed like I could add more and still be ok so I added about 3/4 cup more cereal and it mixed in fine. Love that I can use up all those bottom of the barrel cereal boxes from the pantry in one treat.

My mom told me about a recipe she came across making candy sushi, PURE FUN and it was the absolute hit of the Halloween party (all adults mind you). Fruit rolls, fish candies and anything that looks like sushi, go for it! Butter your hands frequently-maybe not the best project for little hands as the treats need to be warm and it's so sticky. Yes, I got ill eating candy while I rolled.

Since it said any cereal was fine, I used the natural food kind of rice cereal, which might have made it less sweet than it could have been.  I stirred in chocolate chips at the end, so that made up for it.  My parents didn't like them very much (or so they said, though I caught them sneaking some) and they're really sticky, which is why I took a star off.  Other than that, they're a good quick treat.

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for to get rid of a box of cheerios that nobody wanted to eat. I added some milk chocolate chips as well. It came out not as sticky as I thought it would and not too sweet. I'll definately keep this in mind when I need to use up cereal again.

The gummi sushi idea was a big hit! I used less butter (about 4 Tbs.) and added 6 cups of rice cereal to make mine. Loved them!

These were so good.  I made a batch for my daughter and I yesterday afternoon, and they were gone in the next hour.  I didn't use the full 1/4 cup of butter...more like 3 tbls. Will definitely make again.

We used 4 kinds of cereal, including 1 cup of Cocoa Pebbles. We added a handful of Christmas M&M's----turned out
yummy and colorful. My daughter said, "This was fun to make!"

Very versatile recipe! For rice cereal though, I'd either add more cereal or less marshmallows. The treats were very tough - enough to make my jaw hurt yet I kept eating them LOL! I used a non-stick pot to melt the marshmallow on the stove top. Made cleaning sooo easy.

I made these with Frosted Flakes Gold cereal and it just didn't taste right.  I think it would have been much better with rice cereal.

It's very easy to make and tastes pretty good. Unfortunately, the marshmallows make it way too sweet.

Oh yum!!  I only had a 16 oz bag of mini marshmallows, used about 5 c. rice crispies and 3 c. corn chex, and 1/4 c. butter.  I did add about 1 tsp vanilla to the melted butter/marshmallow mix before the cereal, turned out yummy, not sticky at all, a tiny bit greasy on the fingers, but I did spray the heck of the pan.  Can't stop snacking on these.  Really like the addition of the corn chex, gives it more of a crunch.  Will make again, cant wait to try different variations of cereal!

I usually don't stray too far from the original recipe when I make something, but since I've made these in the past, I decided to try something different.  Instead of the butter, I used 1/4 cup of natural peanut butter and used Cinnamon Burst Cheerios for the cereal.  I'm not sure yet how well these will set up, but the taste is fabulous!  I could only get 4 cups of cereal in there before it got too hard for me to stir, but, like I said, they are fantastic!  Next time I might add a little butter to the mix to see if maybe they will be a little less stiff.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Good recipe.  I opted to use 3 TBS butter just because I like the flavor better and the calories and fat weren't too much more.  I used Fiber One cereal and my husband and grandchildren both said they liked it better than the original recipe.  They are better just made, though.

Perfect if you're looking for a traditional rice crispy treat! Works awesome with just about any kind of cereal and really great for cereals that you need to use up.  However, in our house, it's a rare occasion if we can wait 2 hours to let them cool before eating them!!

I used about a tablespoon Country Crock light instead of 1/4 cup of butter.  I also added vanilla after the marshmallow was melted.  I used what cereal that was on hand cornflakes, Captain Crunch and Peanut Butter Crunch.  This was an excellent way to get rid of leftovers that no one wants.

A little sticky but great! It helps if you just add a little more cereal. It's quick and good with every cereal that I've tried it with. I also added toffee pieces to cocoa crispy cereal and they came out great!!

OK, 2 words for you Chocolate Cheerios. So good! I used the cheerios and then sprinkled semi-sweet miniature chocolate chips on the final product!

Cheerios and Cookie Crisp was a great combo.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla--but it HAS to be added after the butter and marshmallow mixture is melted.

This recipe does not taste good with MultiGrain Cheerios. :( I bet this recipe would be good with regular Rice Krispies. You can use more cereal too.

Great way to use the left over cereals that have gone stale!!  We used a combination of Chex, Honey Nut Cheerios and Rice Crispies, and it turned out really good. It was supposed to be for the kids, but I think I ate the most!!!

I love these. Today I used cornflakes and leftover Quaker Oh!s. I accidentally used the entire stick of butter, but it's a very forgiving recipe, so I added a little extra cereal to make up for it. Thanks for sharing!

Great traditional crispy rice (or cereal) treat recipe. I like some others threw in some vanilla. 

We also made them into the sushi, like the picture showed, which I think is the cutest idea ever...only wish I could say I thought of it. If you do make the sushi, be sure to pam your hands!

Looks wonderful, and tastes great too!

I made these egg shaped for Easter, using Cocoa Pebbles. They were amazing! I will make these over and over, experimenting with different cereals. Cocoa Pebbles were definitely a hit. I stored them in the fridge, but they do taste better at room temperature.

I had to revise a little due to what I had on hand, but the basic recipe is perfect. I ended up using about three cups of cocoa puffs that needed to be eaten, and sprinkled about a cup of mini chocolate chips on top. These did not last long.

I've been making these for years and they are so delicious! They only take 5 minutes to make and are so easy. I can't wait to try them with different kinds of cereal.

I used about 6 cups of fruity pebbles and they turned out wonderful. I also added a little bit of vanilla just for taste. And of course they were sticky, isn’t that how they are supposed to be! My new son and I just loved them. Thank you for the recipe!

I used the "red berries" cereal for this.  YUM! Great way to use that half eaten box of cereal that you forgot about in the back of your cupboard :-)!

I love these. I use the same recipe but use an 8 inch square pan because I like my squares a little bigger. I also add 1 tsp of vanilla extract after melting the marshmallows.

This was very easy and not sticky. It spread easily and cut/served after 30-45 minutes. The kids said they were a lot better than the school's marshmallow treats.

These were a hit at a game night with friends! They were super sweet, so I only ate about 3. In a large group, they went fast!

These were great!  I made the recipe using corn Chex cereal and sprinkled mini M&M's on top!  YUMMY!!!!  Only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is they are slightly greasy on the fingers
