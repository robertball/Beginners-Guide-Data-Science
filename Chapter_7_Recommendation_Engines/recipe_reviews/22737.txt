This recipe is very good and easy to make.  I think I got the biggest compliment last week about it too...my boyfriend and I went out to eat at a local, well-known Mexican restaurant.  He ordered the enchiladas....as he pushed his half finished plate away he told me "your enchiladas are better"!

I have made a few modifications to the recipe to suit my tastes.  Instead of the cream of chicken soup, I use Campbells Nacho Cheese or Southwestern Cheese soup.  I add a jar of medium or mild green chile salsa to the sour cream/soup mixture for texture and spice.  Instead of chopping the chicken for the filling, I shred it and add a few tablespoons of the sour cream/soup mixture to moisten the filling, otherwise it tends to be a bit dry to me.

Excellent! I used 1 T of Olde El Paso Taco seasoning mix instead of chili powder and pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar for more spice. For my "picky" child I just put aside some chicken, (no onion or chiles) mixed with sauce, used cheddar and put hers on one side of the dish.  She loved it.  
Just a few tips for those making this for the first time.
1. Don't start this from scratch, if like me, you get home at 5:15 unless your family likes to eat late.  Next time I will have the chicken cooked and chopped ahead of time.
2. Double the sauce.  It's worth it.
3. SPRAY the baking dish with PAM.
4. Wrap tortillas in foil and put in oven for a few minutes.  They are much easier to wrap. 
Try this recipe.  It is very good.

I have to admit, I only used this as a basis for what I ended up creating!  Mine turned out wonderfully...with all of my alterations, but thought I'd share them with you.  I mixed 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can cream of mushroom soup and added the 4 oz can of green chilies to this mixture.  I sliced and sauteed 8 boneless/skinless chicken thighs with 1-2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp chili and 3 garlic cloves.  Then to assemble...lay out your 8 inch tortilla, put 2 tbsp soup mixture, a tbsp of cottage cheese, a big handful of fresh spinach, some chicken and top with a bit more soup mixture.  Roll it up and place in a 9 x 12 pan that you've added some of the soup mixture in the bottom of to avoid sticking.  Repeat - this quantity made 6 tortillas with a bit of chicken left over which I chopped and added to the top.  Cover it with cheddar, bake for one hour at 325.  Remove foil for last 10 minutes and allow to rest for 10 minutes before dishing up.  I prepared this for family - and it was a huge hit.  Thanks for inspiring me.

Excellent! Just the recipe I've been searching for.  I added a couple of things and they turned out wonderful.  I added a can of Rotel to the chicken after browning, and added a can of green enchilada sauce to the cream of chicken and sour cream.  Just the kick it needed.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Love, love, LOVED this recipe!  The only thing I changed was added a tablespoon of cumin with the chili powder, stirred in some canned enchilada sauce to the soup mixture and added cheese inside each enchilada.  These are the BEST enchiladas I've ever tasted.  (You made my husband a happy Man!) Thanks Jeri!!

Everyone I have made this for loves it!  I have change one thing after making it several times.  I now throw 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts in the crockpot with some peperoncini's & juice (sp) let them cook all day and then shread the chicken.  It really gives it a good flavor that is not too hot.

I've made this several times for groups of people; everybody loves it!  I made a few modifications....I added chopped green peppers and celery with the onion, replaced the can of green chilies with a can of Rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilies) and put half of it with the soup mixture, half with the chicken. I also put cheese inside each enchilada. These are SO good, definitely one of our favorite meals now.

Delicious!  I doubled the soup (used the Healthy Request version) and the sour cream(low-fat), used half a packet of taco seasoning mix instead of the chili powder, and used a reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend.  My entire family loved it.

while i'm sure this recipe is good with the chili powder, I substitute it with Hot Taco Seasoning. I like things spicy! I also add a little of the seasoning to the cream of chicken and sour cream mixture, but just a touch. For the chicken, i buy a pre-cooked chicken from the deli section at the grocery store and shred off some breast meat. Just before I put the cheese on top, I place a few jalapeno slices on top of each one. Like i said, I like things spicy!

These are wonderful! Try playing around with some of the ingredients...shredded Chipotle cheese gives a nicely spiced kick. I serve this with  Absolute Mexican Cornbread found on this site,also Wonderful!

We love this. My Husbands favorite of all Enchiladas! I myself would have to agree. Just add a little bit of home seasonings and our own cheeses makes it oh so yummy!

This was the first Enchilada recipe I tried and I'm not trying any more. I LOVE this recipe!! First I boiled 4 chicken thighs ..when they were done I shred them. I added some green chile salsa to the soup and sour cream mixture. I added some taco seasoning and 1/2 a can of black beans to the chicken mixture. I added some cheese in each enchilada as I rolled it up. I then topped it off with the soup/sour cream mixture ..then some red enchilada sauce (store bought) ..Boy was this yummy!! I served this dish with my family's spanish rice. Looking forward to making this again really soon!

Very tasty and ohhh sooo good!!!  Recommend for sure!  And these freeze well so make the whole pan full or two like I did.  My husband and I had these several more times over the next couple months and it was easy to take them out of the freezer, thaw and bake or pan fry!!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes, but sorry to say it's from a Campbell's Soup cookbook that I've had for years.  This is the EXACT recipe from the cookbook.

These are perfect chick. ench. I browned my chicken with a little liquid smoke and garlic, then simmered in broth for a little while. I used corn tort. instead of flour. And used half monterey jack and half blanco queso(white processed cheese loaf which you probably won't find unless you live in South Texas. Sliced olives sprinkled on top would have set these off!

Awesome and simple recipe!  I made a few adjustments.  To save time and add major flavor I purchased a rotisserie chicken and chopped it up.  I added a can of RoTel to the filling.  I added a can of mild enchilada sauce, 1/2 to the filling, 1/2 to the soup mixture.  I also sprinkled cheese into each tortilla as well.  I topped the finished product with salsa, sour cream and jalapenos.  We ate the entire pan!  I will definitely make this again!

My Wife made this for our family dinner.  Everybody loved it.  It is a definite keeper.  We doubled the recipe and added another can of chicken soup and 1/2 cup of sour cream. It was outstanding and for the wimpy eaters in our crowd we didn't add any additional spices, but we still loved it.

This recipe could not have been better!  I LOVED it!  I added a can of enchilada sauce in with the soup/sour cream mixture and other than that stuck with the recipe and it came out perfect.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This is a decent recipe as written which explains why I am only giving 3 stars. As you might suspect, I did make changes.  I used corn totillas since flour ones would have turned to paste. They also add a great layer of texture in the mouth as you are eating. It's best to blanch them for a few seconds in hot oil before adding the filling so they don't break after rolling. If you don't mind that then don't bother. I also added more chili powder to taste.   A note about the soup mix. As written, the soup mix will not be thin enough to properly cover the enchiladas or provide enough moisture for the mixture to come together properly. You will need about 1 1/2 to 2 cans of soup the regular amount of sour cream and some milk or chicken broth to thin the mixture out enough to drench everything nicely. Just eyeball it. Adjust your seasonings accordingly.   Finally, when filling the tortillas add a pinch of shredded cheese inside each one. You will thank me for it.

Fantastic Meal. The only thing I did differently was boil my chicken in water that I had mixed half a pack of taco seasoning in...Wonderful!

Family said these were better than enchiladas at a restaurant! The creamy sauce was fantastic with the chicken filling. I omitted chiles and subbed some taco seasoning for the chili powder. I didn't have an onion so I used chopped onion flakes and onion powder. Also used canned chicken for chicken breasts.

Make this for my family of seven and have to make two pans!  Doubled the recipe and it was a hit.  Hubby added some sliced jalapenos to his but just right for the kids.

As-is, I give this recipe a 3. It lacked serious seasoning, but was a great base. I made it per the instructions, then after it was done, added a few things. Here's what I added: one packet McCormick brown gravy mix, extra kosher salt (to taste), a few dashes of Tony Chachere's seasoning. I'll make it again, but next time I'll add a can of sweet peas (I think they're important in beef stew) and extra carrots. It's yummy with the additions, though. Also, I didn't have red wine (the only part I initially didn't do per recipe), but I deglazed the pan with the same amount if water.

On top of given recipe - Alterations:
1 can mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken
1/2 can of chile stewed tomatoes
2/4 pkg taco seasoning
1 chopped jalapeno
4 cloves garlic
Everyone loved it, I thought there would be too much sauce but ended up just having enough, sister even said more sauce would be good - because it was delicious. 
Everyone had thirds until there was nothing left. 

*I also split it into two baking dish's and one was made without cheese  - you can honestly make this recipe without cheese and it as just as delicious, nobody could really tell the difference except me, as I'm lactose intolerant. 
DEFINITELY making these again!!!!

Awesome with a few changes, I added cilantro, and instead of cheddar cheese I used Monterrey Jack. Sooo Good!

This is an excellent recipe, I did tweak it just a little and it turned out wonderful! The only thing to be aware of is, you have to use the small tortilla shells if you want this to make 8 servings, if you use the large shells it will make 4 servings. Also, I cooked 3 large boneless, skinless chicken breast and that made about 2 3/4 Cups this was the perfect amount. I doubled the chili powder, and green chili peppers... not the onion tho!  My husband and I both liked this a lot. I plan to keep this on the dinner menu! A side of refried beans and spanish rice make great sides!!!   Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe :O)

The recipe, as is, would be bland.  I used one can of Enchilada sauce along with the cream of chicken.  Next time I think we will use no cream of chicken and either use 2 cans of Enchilda sauce or 1 can of enchilda sauce and 1 can of something like Fiesta cheese.  I didn't change anything else.  It was very easy to make!  I made 4 with real chicken and 4 with veggie chicken (morningstar) all in the same pan.  My husband LOVED it but agreed it needed a little extra zing.

This was very good and easy to make. I didn't add the can of green chile peppers because I didn't have them. But I used Campbell's Southwestern Style Pepper Jack soup and instead of cream of chicken soup and it added some extra flavor and heat to make up for it. I also followed what others suggested and used taco seasonings (doubled the amount) instead of chili powder and corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. It turned out very good. I would definitely make this again.

Yum!  My husband and I loved this.  We love red enchilada sauce, so I had to add a large can to the recipe.  I simply poured the red sauce over the whole thing before topping with cheese.  We couldn't get enough.

Used this recipe several times now.  DH loves it.  I follow all except:

1. I use left over taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  I do not sautee the onions with it.  Instead, I add it to the cream of chicken/sour cream mix directly.

2. I shred the chicken using a food processor (the slicing made with light push down pressure.)

3. I sautee garlic with the onions and do not add chili.  

4. I butter the baking pan and add a small amt of sauce under each enchilada only to prevent stickage, but also to have the max amt of sauce (I stir the sour cream/cream of chicken sauce together with the chicken right in the onion pan until I get the right consistency that we like :)

I made this recipe last night and was extremely disappointed and misled by the high rating--it lacked the flavor and spice that I anticipated from the description.  The soup mixture seemed heavy and insubstantial...I would add stronger chiles/peppers to avoid the blandness.

These hit the spot! Corn tortillas are a must. Also added a can of hot rotel to soup mixture, which gave it a perfect kick. My new discovery, is the Havarati cheese sold in slices at Costco. What a great melting Cheese! Added 1/3 of a slice inside the tortilla, and grated cheddar on top.

These were delicious. I used Jalapeno peppers and it was spicy! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. I'm definitely keeping this recipe and will make it again and again. You can also add other favorite ingredients you want! It's great!

This is a great recipe. I had to add salt and garlic to the chicken filling, but other than that it was perfect, just what I was in the mood for. We used whole wheat tortillas, lowfat sour cream, 98% fat free chicken soup, and a little extra cheddar to replace all the fat we tried to avoid. :)

Delicious recipe, and so easy!  Absolutely double the sauce...you'll regret it if you don't.  It will seem VERY saucy, but it bakes right down.  I used 98% fat free soups and light sour cream, and I didn't miss a thing.  I used a little extra Mexican cheese blend, served it with yellow rice and corn.  A wonderful recipe!  OOH...definitely spray your baking pan with non-stick spray.  We had a MESS with sticking tortillas, but it still tasted great!

Yuck! I was not impressed with this recipe, which is unfortunate because I read a bunch of reviews saying how great they tasted. If you like real mexican food, this will taste like a little kid's recipe or something. The chile powder gave an awkward flavor inside, and I could barely taste the green chiles. The sauce was too salty and tasted like chicken (go figure considering it's chicken soup). I was really hoping for a different type of mexican dish but this was not it. I'll never make it again, sorry everyone but this just didn't cut it for me.

This recipe was wonderful! My husband loved it. I did read the reviews and made few changes. I added 1 tsp. cumin, about a half a package of mild taco seasoning and 8oz. low fat cream cheese in the filling. I also used equal parts of low fat cream chicken soup and hot enchilada sauce for the sauce. I probably used about 1.5 cans of soup total in this recipe. We like a lot of sauce and it turned out perfect. Not too much sauce at all. The seasoning I used worked out well. It had a great flavor but wasn't too spicy. I know I'll be making this again and again. It made great left overs  too!

Very tasty. I used one of the review ideas and cooked the chicken in chicken broth and water in a crockpot on HIGH for 4 hours - this made it perfect for shredding. As for the recipe, I doubled the sour cream and soup so I'd have more sauce mixture which seemed ideal. I sprinkled a few diced tomatoes ontop rolled tortillas before topping with cheese. Add shredded monterey jack cheese with the cheddar.

Excellent recipe. The second time I made it, I shredded the chicken and used 1 tbsp of chili powder (I love chili powder).  Everyone I served it to raved and I was slightly embarassed as to how simple the recipe was to take such credit.

I cannot believe a recipe that calls for canned soup and I actually liked it! Needed to use up some fresh chicken breasts so I just boiled and shredded them. Added a can of green chile sauce as well as doubled the sour cream and cream of chicken soup. Only had four tortillas so I really stuffed these enchiladas to be nice and big. We like spicy foods and did think they could have been spicier even though I added the sauce. Served with some tortilla chips on the side.

This is a great base recipe! I found lots of great suggestions from other reviewers for altering this recipe to fit my own taste. I added about 4 oz of Velveeta cheese and 1/2 tsp cumin to the chicken mixture. I also used 2 large cans of chicken (yes, like tuna, but chicken) which saved A LOT of time! Lastly, I added about 1/4 cup of enchilada sauce to the portion of soup/sour cream that I poured over top of the enchiladas. Next time, I'll add twice as much enchilada sauce and maybe even some chopped jar jalapenos for some extra kick. Thanks!

I love this recipe, I've made it several times! I only give it a 4/5 because I make some significant changes that would make it a 5. To the soup mixture I maintain the soup/sour cream ratio but add about a cup of green enchilada sauce. To the soup/chicken mixture I add a LOT of cheese as well as frozen corn and plain white rice (that I like to add chicken bouillon to while cooking). This basically doubles the recipe while adding some substance to the enchiladas themselves, and the corn is my favorite part as it adds a sweet crunch. So I end up making about 12 hefty enchiladas that are spread between two 9x13s. I smear the soup mixture as usual on the bottom before placing the stuffed enchiladas, then add the rest of the mixture to the top. After that I take more enchilada sauce and pour on top, followed by a WHOLE lot of cheese to the top of that. I probably double if not triple the amount of cheese, but we are a cheese loving family ;) I buy the big can of enchilada sauce then leave it on the table for those that want more, and it's usually almost gone by the end. Even my picky 3 year old who was hesitant to try said "Mmm this is good!" I made it in less than 45 min (including cooking the chicken) and the whole family loved it. Definitely a keeper.

I've made these twice; the first time, they were a bit too hot for my children and husband (I like spice!) so the 2nd time I used medium salsa instead of the green chile peppers, and it was perfect!  I also added about 3 T of cream cheese into the soup mixture, simply because I'm addicted to enchiladas with cream cheese in them!  
Anyway, just wanted to say these are great!  Super easy, too!!  Thank you Jeri Reed for the wonderful recipe!

Not sure I will make this again.  It was too creamy and not enough "punch" of Mexican flavor. If I do here's what I would change: use 1/2 cup onion instead of 1 cup.  2 teaspoons chili powder and/or a package of taco seasoning.  Use 1/2 can condensed soup instead of a whole can.

I made a few changes that were a big hit. First, I cook the chicken in the crock pot with a jar of pepperocinis and their juice (added some water to cover the chicken).  This gives the dish some extra heat without adding more spices.  I also add some green enchilada sauce to the soup mixture.  Instead of using chopped green chiles I use chopped jalepenos.  I garnish the dish with olives and green onions to make it pretty.  Love, love this version!!

I have made this for my family on many occasions as I've had this recipe for years. Most often they ask me to double the recipe just to have leftovers.  They love it!

These are delicious! I didn't have any cream of chicken soup so I used broccoli cheddar, and I think I will use that from now on. My husband said the enchiladas tasted like they came from Qdoba! When he warmed up the left overs at work the next day his boss said it smelled like a restaurant! I will definitely be making these again. It's a nice change from the usual red enchilada sauce.

This is a great recipe to build on! I recommend poaching the chicken breast ahead of time with chicken broth, cumin, paprika and salt and pepper. Then shred with 2 forks. I added garlic and fresh diced jalapenos to the saute before adding chicken and soup mixture. I also used enchilada sauce and pepper jack cheese on top during baking. Delicious!

This is an excellent recipe.  Of course I cahanged a few things, but not much.  I followed many of the reviewers and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and added pepper.  I also used cheese inside the tortillas as well as on top, and I only used a few spoonfulls of the soup mixture on the bottom.  Will definitely make this one again. Delicious!

I changed up the chicken a little when I made this.  I took 3 chicken breasts and cooked them with olive oil in cumin, chili powder, a bit of red pepper, and garlic (along with the onion, of course).  I shredded the chicken in the pan and let it simmer in the soup mixture a bit to let the flavors all mix together.  Also, I used corn tortillas rather than flour as I prefer them for "enchiladas".  Next time I will probably try to incorporate some velveeta in the soup mixture and attempt a salsa or red enchilada sauce to top it off for more dimension.  Still, very tasty overall!

This is pretty much a knock off version of Chicken Enchiladas II.  It's good but there's really no difference.  Gave it a good rating because of taste but the serious lack of originality is disappointing.

Surprisingly satiating meal. I was skeptical of the cream of chicken soup, but it wasn't too heavy. I added some cumin, red pepper, and spinach. I also used corn tortillas; be sure to warm them beforehand to prevent breakage!

4.5 rated.im a begginer so i thought these were good.if you dont add these things then it will be too plain.so i added a can of tomatoes with green chiles and a lot of spices including garlic and garlic powder,onion powder,chill powder and cumin.i also added a can of red enchilada sauce.i later started to add green enchilada sauce and liked it better(in my opinion).use this an it will add more flavor.

THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!! This was an easy dinner, and so delicious, that I got so many compliments! Someone even said I should cook for a living and after tasting a bit, they wanted one! :)

I took some suggestions, and instead of the chicken soup I used salsa velveeta cheese (in the box) and used the recipe on it. It says to slice up the velveeta and add 1/2 cup chunky salsa, then heat it in the microwave for 3 mins. This I used to mix with the sour cream instead of the soup. (It made a huge bowl so I poured it into the sour cream mixture to my liking)

I also used someone's suggestion and when I spooned the chicken mixture on the tortillas, I also spooned some of the sour cream mixture as well. Keeps it moist and yummy. :)

ALSO -- I dont think 9x13 pan will hold 8 burritos. I suggest making 5 instead, to put more filling in!

Once again, THANK YOU so much for this recipe. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Spanish food, or anyone who wants to please guests at dinner with these magnificent enchiladas!

This dish is a huge, huge, hit with my family and friends.  I always double the recipe, but I add two cans of Old El Paso green enchilada sauce to the doubled sauce recipe.  It is very creamy, and I always catch someone scraping the last of the sauce out of the baking dish before it gets rinsed and washed.  I don't put the cheese on till about 10 minutes before the baking is done, for a creamy melty texture rather than browned.  I bake this in Pyrex or Corning Ware, which is not non-stick, so I highly recommend spraying the pan with a non stick spray.  Chipotle powder is really good added into the chicken mixture, too.

I made quite a few changes to this recipe! First, I poached 6 chicken breasts in chicken broth, lime juice, 4 jalapeno peppers (sliced w/ seeds), 1 tbsp. of whole peppercorns and a big handful of fresh cilantro. I poached and shredded the chicken the night before to save some time. I made the filling pretty much as directed except I added 2 tbsp. of minced garlic, 1 tsp. of cumin and substituted the cream of chicken soup for fiesta cheese soup. I like a red enchilada sauce so I splashed some into the filling and poured the rest on top. Good and spicy!!

This was by far the best chicken recipe  I have made.  The ONLY change I made was really to use the bag of Mexican cheese which has chedder/jack and 2 other cheeses in it...but that is all I changed...and it was incredible!

only 4 stars because the littlest one (3) wouldnt touch it, but my 8yr old loved it and so did the adults.  Modified only slightly.  Tossed chicken breasts in taco seasoning, browned with garlic in olive oil.  Mixed with dbl sour cream, 1 can crm of chicken and 1 can crm of mushroom.  Skipped the peppers  to make it kid friendly.  Will do again and give 3 yr old peanut butter sandwich for dinner that night....lol!!

These were delicious! I was looking for something to do with chicken breasts instead of the same-old thing (breading and frying). I seasoned the breasts with olive oil, cumin, garlic pepper, and onion powder and then grilled them. I didn't have enough sour cream (only about 1/3 c.) so I added a little milk. I used the "mexican" cheese mix and sprinkled a little on the chicken mixture before rolling up the tortillas. Only had 5 x-large tortillas (left over from last week's taco night) and no green chiles, but that worked just fine. My husband and picky teenager loved them. I will definitely make these again.

Excellent dish with a few changes. I deleted the green chiles and added hot salsa instead. I also added taco seasoning to the chicken. I used 2 cans of chicken soup and 2 cans of nacho cheese soup for flavor. I used 1 cup of sour cream instead of 1/2 cup. I added cheese to the enchilada. I poured 1 can of enchilada sauce over the enchiladas before I added the cheese when it was ready to go into the oven. Everyone loved it!!!! Perfect amount of spice!

I have a more involved recipe similar to this...but no time, so I tried this one.  My family enjoyed it, however if I were to make it again, I would use double the soup/sour cream mixture.  I found just 2 TBSP's of the mixture IN the rolled tortilla's wasn't enough.  I will make again.  Very filling.

EXCELLENT!  I doubled the soup mixture then added red enchilada sauce on top.  I also put cheese inside the enchiladas as well and I added some garlic to the mixture.  It was awesome! I used a rotissery chicken to save time.  I will be making this again!

These were very good!  I did make a few modifications.  First, I doubled the recipe (large group).  I boiled 5 chicken breasts, and seasoned with TexMex seasoning.  To the soup mixture, I added 1 can enchilada sauce.  I topped with fresh cilantro prior to baking.  Would also be great to add mexican rice to the stuffing mixture.  Thanks!!

It tasted like the enchiladas at our local Mexican restaraunt.  I doubled the recipe and froze the extra portion to cook later. Each recipe had 1.5 cans of soup, but it still seemed a little dry.  I added 3/4 can of red enchilada sauce and a small can of black olives over the top.  Baked for 25 min. then garnished with shredded lettuce and parmeasan cheese.  Even my daughter thought it was great.

These were yummy. I added a can of green enchilada sauce so there would be more sauce after reading the other reviews, but then I put too much chicken mixture per tortilla which resulted in less tortillas used. So... mine came out a little too saucy, but that does give you more alternatives. Make more sauce and use the amount of tortillas called for or make the sauce as written in the recipe and just use fewer tortillas. Either way we loved it tonight.

Easy to make.  I doubled the soup and I used both cheddar and  monterey jack cheeses. Also sprayed the baking dish well with PAM. This was very good tasting and everyone liked it. Freezes well for saving some of those leftovers.

Absolutely terrific!  I made a couple of changes: I added another can of green chiles to the soup mixture and I used whole wheat tortillas with no difference whatsoever (and much healthier for you!)  I highly recommend this recipe.

Wow... what a success.  I thought they were okay and every person who ate them
RAVED!  My friend, a chicken enchilada 
connoisseur, said they were the best she'd ever had and I didn't think they could get any better than the ones SHE makes.  :)
Repeats are requested.  These were at least a five-star success.  BTW..we froze a pan before baking.. they turned out great too.

This was a very simple & very yummy dish.  Since the recipe has simple ingredients, it was very easy to cut out a lot of extra calories & fat by using reduced fat sour-cream, Healthy Request Cream of Chicken Soup & fat-free flour tortillas.  I would definitely recommend this dish for mexican food lovers!!

This is a really great recipe! I've made it several times for my family now and even shared it with my sisters who both enjoy it as well. After a few times of making it I did tweak it a tiny bit and now add about half a can of green chile enchilada mix to the soup/sour cream mixture. Just our preference, though! The recipe is also great as is :)

Love this recipe! My husband and son were very pleased, this is now one of my sons favorites! After reading comments I shredded the chicken after cooking chicken breasts in melted butter instead of margarine, seasoned with chili powder, onion powder, taco seasoning and cumin. I didn't use onions. After shredding chicken I cooked with 2 tb soup mix and 1/4 cup Rotel instead of chili peppers. I added shredded cheese on top of  filling before rolling tortilla and sprinkled on top as well. Delicious !

There are 5 in my family and we never have any left over!  I add chilis inside & outside of the enchiladas.  I think I also added some cumin before. Will continue to make these every few weeks.  It is a favorite at my house.

Everyone at the dinner table agreed this was quite possibly one of the tastiest versions of a classic we've ever tried. Didn't put soup inside the tortillas, only in the pan and on top. Also added some red onions, green peppers, and jalapenoes when I sauteed the chili powder & chicken to give the whole dish even more of a kick.

Yum! Yum! Yum! These were so good! And easy to make!  I especially liked them because they didn't need enchilada sauce which I really don't like.  They were creamy and delicious!  I left out the chili powder because we don't really like spicy.  I also only used 5 tortillas and put them in a smaller baking dish (8X8) so each tortilla was very stuffed. And I used Mexican blend cheese instead of just cheddar.

Very tasty.  I also added some salsa to the sauce, and added black beans to the individual enchiladas cause I didn't make enough chicken... But all was well.  Will definitely make again!

Most recipes I try on here have been rated so many times I don't even bother to write a review.  I liked this one so much I had to give it my endorsement.  We do like things spicy and cheesy, so I did sprinkle some cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt on the chicken as I cooked it.  And I sprinkled a little bit of cheese inside each enchilada too.  Perfect!

Very good. Similar to the recipe I have been using for enchiladas but a lighter, not so rich version. I add a chopped zucchini to the filling to blk it up and get in some veggies. My family doesn't even know it's there.

Very good!  I used a rotisserie chicken for the meat which added even more flavor.  I didn't realize until I was in the middle of cooking it I was out of chili powder so I just left it out, it was still great without it, will probably try it with next time.  I also left out the onion because my husband can't stand onions.  But everyone loved it, all 3 of my boys (3, 6 and 8) especially liked it.  It was very easy too, will make again.  I think next time I'll thin the sauce just a tad with some milk, my husband likes it more runny, the sauce was very thick

This recipe has allowed me to really try different flavors w/ enchilidas... I even received a tip from my roommate once!! I do spice the chicken heavily w/ cumin, chili powder, garlic, salt & pepper. The spicer the better w/ this dish!! And I definitely recommend shredding the chicken instead of chopping - also, must use the corn tortillas!

Awesome...I used onions and green onions and spiced it up a bit but only because we like some spice.  Great base to play with for your preferences or good as is.

These were a huge hit with everyone in the family. My 3 and 5 year old ate everything on their plate. My parents loved them, too. It's going down as one of my  favorite meals. I know I'll make this many more times, it was that good. The only changes I made were to use taco seasoning instead of chili powder, and I probably used 1 1/2 tsp of it. I didn't have chopped green chiles, but I did have 7 oz can of whole green chiles, so I just chopped those up instead. I probably used more like 5-6oz of chiles. I had filling left over after putting 1/4 cup in each tortilla, so I ended up using 11 tortillas, which ended up fitting in my 9x13 better. I used a little extra cheese on top, because we love cheese in this house. And after I pulled it out of the over I sprinkled some fresh cilantro and green onion on the top while it cooled. Sooooooo amazing! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this for dinner last night and have to say it was just so-so for me.  I try not to deviate from original recipes here unless there is strong opposition in the reviews, but like some other reviewers have said, the flour tortillas were just too mushy.  I would recommend making this with corn tortillas instead.  Aside from the texture, I thought the inside flavor was bland, so I will keep looking for a recipe that better suits my tastes.  Thanks anyway.

This is a terrific recipe! We had to double it and did not have cream of chicken so we used one can of cream of mushroom and one cane of golden mushroom soup. I also only used 4 oz of green chiles and one tsp of chile powder. This is an AMAZING recipe and will definately be added to our family favorites!

This was very good! I was a little wary of the cream of chicken soup, I thought how can it taste like enchiladas with cream of chicken soup? I added mild red enchilada sauce to the soup mixture and that really made it. Definitely will be making this again.

Phenomenal!  Better than restaurant quality!  The leftovers also taste wonderful heated up the next day. The only changes that I made were to use shredded chicken (boiled 2 chicken breasts for 1/2 hour and the shredded) and used 1 T taco seasoning instead of the chili powder. This one is a keeper!

Great recipe! It's relatively fast, easy, and delicious. Minor variations: I didn't have any green chiles in my pantry, so I used a 10-oz can of Rotel instead (barely drained, half in the meat mixture, and half on top for some color). I used post-Thanksgiving turkey instead of chicken, olive oil for margarine, and added 1 t. of cumin to the meat. Delicious!  I tried cream of onion soup once; I recommend sticking with the cream of chicken. If that's too much creamy stuff for you, go easy on top with the soup/sour cream and cheese mix.

I love this recipie.  I have made enchiladas, many different times, with different recipies, and this by far is the best!  I made it exactly by the recipie the first time, and they were GREAT!  My boyfriend begged me to make them again all week!  The only adjustments I made the second time was to add cheese inside the tortilla, I also used pepperjack along with the cheddar, and I used about a can and a half of the green chilis.  It needed just a bit more spice.  It was great both ways!

My family was OK with this, but the green chiles were too strong for their taste. I would consider another option for adding some pizazz for taste

I used this recipie also as a base and made a few minor changes. I parboiled the chicken in chicken stock and then shredded it instead of chooped. I added a few tbps of green chilis to the soup mix as well as my enchilada sauce.  I added about 4tbsp of soup/chili mix to the chicken to keep it moist and follow the remainder of the directions.  Once all the tortillas were in place, I poured over the remaining soup mixture along with some red enchilada sauce and the remaining chilis.  Then sprinkled a fair amount of monteray jack cheese for the extra kick! Turned out great!  Thanks for posting the recipie!

Just made this last night, while it was good it definitely wasn't spicy. Make sure you season the chicken or else it lacks flavor. I made shredded chicken and filled the enchiladas with that. I think it needs more sauce as well, but my boyfriend is obsessed with sauce so it's just our personal prefence. Overall it is a good recipe, next time I'll just make more sauce! :)

Why anyone would want to change this recipe, is beyond me! Everyone loved it, and my Uncle said it was some of the best enchiladas he's had. Excellent recipe! (FYI: I used flour tortillas, and they didn't turn to paste.)

I made these exactly as is the first time and they were pretty good, but a tad dry on the inside.  When I've made them since I've added a good bit of the soup mixture to the chicken inside the tortilla and they are much better that way.  Thanks

Very yummy recipe!  I added a can of Rotel to the chicken mixture before making the enchiladas.  If you do that, I recommend leaving out the chopped peppers, unless you like your food really spicy!

Quick, easy, but lacking taste- BIG time. The cream sauce is a nice change from regular red sauce, but next time I will throw in some taco seasoning with the meat as the chili powder did nothing for it. Also, the meat mixture looked pretty dry, so I had to put more of the soup mixture in with that than called for.

Wow, wow, wow! Creamy and delicious is how I would describe this meal. Truly a delicatble Enchilada. I tweaked a bit though. I added fresh garlic and cilantro to meat mixture. And I also added ground black pepper and chili powder to sauce mixture. The only problem was....NOT ENOUGH ENCHILADAS!

These are wonderful.
I made a few changes 1)I boiled the chicken with salt, pepper and chili powder then shredded it. 2)I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom. 3) Added chopped jalapenos.
4)Added 1 can of mexican corn. 
5)Added a little onion powder to soup mixture. Baked covered for 40 minutes and served with chips and salsa. 
Oh so good!!

As many others have said... great starter recipe. I made a few changes such as adding green enchilada sauce to the sour cream and cream of chicken soup and rather than just cheddar cheese I used a 4 blend Mexican cheese. Something is missing from this recipe and I think it just me wanting something more with a little kick. I will surely make this again, but will play around with things. The great thing about this base recipe is you can do almost what you want to it and NOT screw it up!

Low sodium chicken broth mixed with yogurt is fine. In house chicken stock is even better. save all the backs and necks in the freezer when you butcher up your whole chickens. add the heat to the stock such as a diced Habanero or Jalapeno. All those spice mixtures contain a ton of salt!

This recipe is fantastic...with a few changes.  I followed the other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce.  I also spiced things up by adding salsa, cilantro, cumin, and garlic to the chicken mixture.  I also added pureed onion, cilantro, and jalapeno to the sauce.  It turned out so good, I'll be making this recipe often!

My family LOVED this recipe! Instead of chopped chicken I shredded my chicken after I poached it in water with chicken bouillon. I also added a tiny amount of the sauce to the inside of each Enchilada. Wonderful recipe! I see this one becoming a main staple in our house.

Awesome! I only made a couple of minor changes: added one can cheddar cheese soup to the soup mixture and added a jalapeno to the chicken mix. Layered tortillas, chicken, then soup mixture for more of a casserole style. Also added a layer of refried black beans. Topped with more tortillas strips and pepper jack cheese...it is fantastic!

Made these for my boyfriend and he couldn't rave about them enough. There are only 2 of us and the recipe made 6 and we ended up reheating them for the next 2 meals in a row. I made some changes that others had suggested - used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of fiesta cheese soup, also added a little of the soup mixture to the filling before wrapping.

Lightened this up and LOVED it! As others suggested, I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and I added green enchilada sauce to the sour cream & soup. How I lightened it up!  I used extra lean turkey breast instead of chicken... fat free cream of chicken soup, light sour cream, reduced fat shredded Mexican cheese and carb balance flour tortillas. Think it came in under par with all those light changes? No way!! Full fabulous flavor... half the calories, fat and carbs! Enjoy!!

I had family over and they all loved it and it's not too spicy for my little kids(4&2)! This is such an easy recipe that I wouldn't mind making it every night!!! I did make a couple changes after the first time I tryed it. 2 cans Cream of Chicken Soup and 1 cup Sour Cream. I found that the recipe was slightly dry and the change made it a lot more moist!

Excellent! The first time I made these exactly as the recipe states, and they were delicious. The second time, I made a few additions as recommended by others, and they were even better! 
I definitely liked the addition of a can of green enchilada sauce to the soup mixture...gives it way more sauce and a good flavor also. Then I added some cheese in each enchilada before rolling up. Then I topped it off with red enchilada sauce before adding the cheese, then added diced ripe olives on top of cheese. 
I served this for my parents, husband and 16 year-old son...they ALL raved about how good they were. This is a SUPER chicken enchilada recipe....a keeper!!

This is such a great emergancy dish, I've made it twice now when I had unexpected guests. Have gotten loads of praise both times.
  It is so basic that it would be very simple to alter it to personal taste.  Hatch peppers are in season right now, so I roasted peeled and chopped one up to add to the mix, yum. I also mixed a can of Rotel with about 1/2 cup of extra sour cream and poured over top before baking, kept them nice and soft.
I am anxious to try what one reviewer suggested with adding spinach to the mix; also want to experiment with some different cheeses. Thanks for this great recipe!

The enchiladas were delicious and easy!  I did add a few things to bolster the flavor.  To the chicken breast mix, I added 1t. cumin and 2t. taco seasoning.  To add a little flavor variety, I created 4 regular enchiladas and 4 spicy.  For the regular, I added chopped tomato into each tortilla with a sprinkle of cheese.  And for the spicy, I added chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce with a sprinkle of cheese.  After rolling each tortilla and tossing the cheese on top, I sprinkled fresh chopped cilantro and tomato.  The flavors really came together and tasted great.

Excellent recipe! The only changes I made were to use taco seasoning in place of the chili powder, and I also used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis. Half for the sauce and half for the chicken mixture. Delicious and I will definitely be making these again!!!

Fantastic recipe for Chicken Enchiladas. Changed a couple things the second time around: added 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper; sprinkled green onions on top with the cheese; and used a little less of the soup/sour cream mixture. It turned out excellent!

Excellent recipe but I made a few changes. I mix everything but the cheese and spoon it into the tortillas and top with some cheese before rolling up. Then I put more cheese on top and drizzle a can of green enchilada sauce over the whole thing and bake. Yum!

Wow, this was so delicious!  I changed a few things from the original recipe to make the enchiladas like some at a local Tex-Mex place:  (1)  I left out the diced onions and chili powder, and substituted onion powder, cayenne, and cumin.  (2)  I mixed in some nacho cheese soup as another poster suggested.  (3)  I added diced Roma tomatoes and lettuce to the filling.  (4)  I topped the cheese sauce with some green chile enchilada sauce.  All in all, this was a very satisfying dish, and I plan to make it again.

Really good enchiladas! I kept tasting the chicken mixture because I knew there was something missing: I recommend adding CUMIN-it makes a huge difference. Also, to reduce the amount of fat just a little, I bought 98% fat free cream of chicken and mixed it with enchilada sauce instead of sour cream. It turned out soooo good! I will definitely make these again!

This turned out so good!  My husband absolutely loved it.  I think it's definitely a "Midwestern" chicken enchilada recipe - not too spicy.  Most definitely a keeper!  Easy, quick and delicious!

A wonderful basic recipe that you can just about change anyway you want to make it spicier or tangy-er. I used a small onion, a little extra chili powder,  a couple tablespoons of salsa and a couple dashes of hot sauce in the chicken/onion/chili powder mix.  It was just great. Not too mild, not too spicy. Thanks for this recipe!  Iam adding this on later---Next time I may also add a little milk or water to the soup/sour cream mixture to make it a little saucier.

My boyfriend is usually complimentary about the meals I cook, but he RAVED over this one! Since others had said that it was a little bland, I went ahead and added a package of taco seasoning to the "soup" mixture, before spooning it onto the chicken. Very yummy. I'll definitely be making it again.

Mmmm,Mmmm!  I added some of the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce (easy!) found on this website and a can of sweet baby corn to the chicken mixture. I also replaced the chile peppers with roasted red peppers since hubby has a sensitive tummy. I added the enchilada sauce over top of the tortillas too-I love red sauce. Can't wait to have the left overs for lunch!

Everyone loved this recipe!  I felt they were a little dry so I doubled the soup recipe and added a little milk to thin it down a bit.  I also spooned some green salsa over the top before baking and it added the perfect kick!!

These enchiladas were great! Very easy to make. Knowing that chicken enchiladas aren't usually spcy, I added chili powder and a dash of red pepper to the soup mixture. I also used frozen cooked chicken breasts that had already been seasoned. It made all the difference. I'm not a big onion person, but used 3 little green onions, my husband gave it 3 thumbs up! This has become a personal favorite. And yes, I did double the soup mixtures because we like sauce.

I love this recipe, but I did make a few changes: I used two cans of soup, doubled the sour cream, and seasoned the chicken mixture with cumin, garlic powder and chopped cilantro.  I used small "taco" sized flour tortillas too (the regular-sized ones are too big).  Oh and I added more cheese, too.  On the whole, this is a recipe that adults and kids just love.

Very good.  I had family over for dinner and they all cleaned their plates :)  I doubled the soup as recommended by others.  I cooked the chicken breasts in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high with chicken broth & water.  This made the chicken shred and taste great in the enchiladas.  Enjoy!

I made this the other night for my daughter and her boyfriend.  Outstanding!  I used a Emeril's chicken rub on the breasts along with a squeeze of fresh lime juice and let sit for 1/2 before sauteing in butter.  I already had sour cream that was mixed with dry ranch dressing and salsa so I used that mized with the soup.  I too added cheese on top of the chicken mixture along with sliced jalepenos before rolling up.  I poured some enchilada sauce on top with more cheese before baking.  Spicy, tasty and moist.  I was told this is definately a keeper.  Thanks for the great idea!

These are so good!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers by adding an extra can of soup to avoid dry enchiladas.  I think next time I'll leave the recipe as is though, was just a bit too much sauce, made the enchiladas a bit soggy.  But still tasted great, especially the yummy chicken filling, and lucky for me my husband refuses to eat leftovers...more for me!  Thanks for the recipe.

I kinda took some advice and changed  this one.  I cooked my chicken in the crockpot the day before with water and some taco seasoning.  I poured a little enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan.  When I mixed everything I wasn't paying attention and I mixed all the sour cream and soup with all the chicken.  I rolled them up with extra cheese and then made a second batch of sour cream and soup and spead it over top.  Then  baked.  It was awesome and perfect not dry at all.  I also excluded the green chile peppers.  NOt one person didn't ask for this recipe.  Great to make ahead for large party

Good recipe - I agree with the other reviewers who said that it could use some more filling for each tortilla - they come out a bit dry.  Great overall and I will definitely make again!

I had been looking for a good chicken enchilada recipe and I've found it. I didn't have any flour tortillas on hand so I used corn tortillas (I cooked them for a few seconds in vegetable oil to soften). I also stretched the sauce a bit (it didn't look like quite enough) with about 1/4 cup of chicken stock and 1/4 cup of additional sour cream and it was perfect. I also used light sour cream and I don't believe it made any difference. I also added a bit of Kosher salt to the filling to perk it up a bit. They tasted just like the ones at my favorite Tex Mex restaurant.

I changed the recipe around on this one and loved it!! I cooked ground beef with a onion, garlic, and jalepeno slices. I put mozzarella cheese in the enchiladas and then doubled the soup and sour cream mix, the more the better on this one!

I used half a can of green enchilada sauce instead of the chiles, and it turned out very well, though a little rich for our tastes.  I will leave out the sour cream and use a full can of sauce next time.

This was really good, but I took a number of suggestions and made some modifications. First, I doubled the soup and sour cream. I also added a jar of green enchilada sauce to the mixture. I had some chicken tenderloins already boiled, so I added those to the onion and chili powder, which I also doubled, and threw in about half a package of sliced mushrooms. I drained a can of Rotel and blended a little less than 3 oz. of cream cheese with a chopped and seeded chili pepper in the blender and stirred that into the chicken and mushroom mix. I finished it up as the recipe said, only adding some black olives and sliced jalapenos on top of the cheese. I did have some of the sauce left over, but I don't think there would have been enough for my liking had I not doubled it. These were terrific. Thanks for the recipe and the suggestions!

YUMMY!!!!  I had left over pork roast that I chopped up and used mexican shredded cheese.  I topped with a dollop of sour cream and served with mexican rice.  This is one terrific way to make use of my left over meats.  I will make this again and again.

Great Recipe!!! We double the sauce part - using one can cream of chicken soup and one can nacho cheese fiesta soup.  Also added quite a bit of the soup mixture to the chicken mixture so it wouldn't be dry.

This was great.  I seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning and baked wrapped in foil for 40 minutes (two chicken breast = two cups cubed.  I cubed the chicken after cooking.  I used yogurt in place of sour cream.  I will make this again.

I made this last night and my husband who "wasn't very hungry" had two servings.  My 8 yeard old loved it and said it is now his second facorite meal after pizza.  The only thing I did differently is top the enchiladas with about one cup of green enchilada sauce before putting on the cheese.  It mixed very well with the soup/sour cream mixture.

I made this for my Swedish fiancé who had never heard of enchiladas. He loved this and I must say I enjoyed this too. I did however add 2 cups of sour cream instead of the recommended amount. It wasnt dry at all.

I loved the recipe, I'm sure it would have been even better had I used all the traditional ingredients, however, I am trying to eat healthier and sometimes we get so familiar to "what tastes good' that really forget why.  Those things that have been included like extra salt, sugar, fillers and artificial flavors to keep us coming back for more!  However, I used whole wheat tortillas, homemade condensed cream of chicken soup (with wheat flour), cottage cheese for sour cream substitute and of course olive oil instead of the margarine.  My boys liked it and they really didn't know what changes had been made.

My husband and I really liked this. I used 1 whole package of taco mix instead of chili powder to my 4 shredded chicken breasts (doubled the recipe so I would have one to freeze). I added 1/2 can of red enchilada sauce to soup mix and added a dollop of refried beans to each enchilada, then used Mexican blend cheese on top.  Nice adaptable recipe. Will make again.

Love this recipe! I make a couple of changes. First, I cook the chicken in the crockpot all day with some picante sauce and taco seasoning. Instead of the green chili's I use rotel which adds a lot of flavor. I double the sauce mixture and add a little cheese inside the tortilla's! Yum!!

I thought this would be better.  It would be improved by adding 2/3 of thesoup mixture to the chicken before wrapping it in the tortilla.  As the recipe is written, you're eating a tortilla filled w/ chicken w/ some sauce on top.

I made this recipe exactly as it calls, except, my wife boiled the chicken with some spices then shredded the chicken rather than chop. That's it! It was awesome!!!!  warmed up the left overs the next day, still awesome.

This was very good as is.  For a cheese lover to stop at one cup seemed to be a stretch, but we went by the recipe and the quantity was perfect, all flavors were perfect together.  Thanks for posting!

I really wanted to love this recipe, as so many others have done.  I have to say I was just underwhelmed.  There was no clear-cut enchilada flavor.  It was more like a casserole I would find at a potluck at church.  I will not be making this again.

This was a very good recipe.  I followed the advice of JENNYB5149, as we like things with a kick.  I was unable to get the soup that JENNYB5149 recommended, so I used the cream of chicken soup, but I used Mexican blend cheese instead of regular Cheddar.  It was very good, but if you're looking for a real kick, I'd recommend doing some additional tweaking.

Loved this recipe.  Only thing I changed was doubling the sauce and adding a couple spoonfuls of it and some cheese (used cheddar/jack mix) to inside of tortilla.

We tried this today for the first time and everybody was kind of disappointed.  The food was not bad, but I have honestly found better boxed frozen enchiladas. This far south, we prefer big flavor.

I don't know, maybe Enchiladas in the UK are completely different.  I followed this recipe and thought it was very bland.  Even extra chillies couldn't save it!

I made the recipe as written. The only modification I made was substituting the chilli powder for crushed red chilli peppers, as that is what I had on hand. This turned out great. Even my picky 2 year old loved it! Thanks for sharing :)

These were good, but we really felt it was lacking in the filling.  The sauce on top tasted too much like the chicken soup mix, in our opinion.

This recipe was very easy to make and had remarkable flavor, but it was pretty salty, probably due to the can of soup that's used.  I served the enchiladas with a jarred salsa and the combination was excellent.  The soup/sour cream mixture was very thick and next time I'll try to thin it out a bit with broth or skim milk, which will probably also help reduce the saltiness.

AMAZING, with some modifications. Added all of the sour cream/soup mixture to the chicken mixture to stuff the enchiladas with. The chicken/onions mixture alone was way too dry without it. I then topped the enchiladas with a mixture of 1 can red enchilada sauce + 1 can cream of mushroom stirred together then poured on top. Sprinkled Tony's seasoning all over the top for a little kick, plus a little mozzerella cheese on top with the cheddar cheese. Me & hubby think these are the best enchiladas ever!

This was delicious! I also used a big can of green enchilada sauce and splashed a little bit in the pan before adding the enchiladas, and then poured the rest of it over them. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was a big hit in our house. The only thing I did differently was I used Chipotle Sour Cream instead of plain sour cream. It gave it the perfect amount of kick! TY for a great recipe Jeri!

Good recipe but I have better.  Needs more kick.  Maybe more chiles or something else with some guts.  Not bad.  My kids liked it!  So it will be worth making again for them.  Just not for my husband and I.

A quick, easy recipe, perfect for leftover roast chicken!!! I modified it slightly per other reviews, added some hot enchilada sauce (1/2 can) to the soup mix. Cooked up the onion with some green pepper, then added the shredded chicken and about 1/3 of the soup/sour cream mix. Spooned 1/3 of the soup mix into  bottom of dish, filled the tortillas as directed and the other third I mixed with some salsa and spread on  top of the tortillas, then covered it with grated cheese. Served with mexican rice and beans - the family loved it!!

This sounds like a strange recipe, but I am so glad I tried it.  Add a can of Rotel instead of just chiles if you like some spice.  My family loves this recipe and I have made it quite a few times.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was really good! The only thing I changed was that I used Cream of Mushroom instead of Cream of Chicken and the chili powder I used was Ancho Chili Powder.   Recipe didn't state how to cook chicken so I boiled mine in water, pinch of salt and a pinch of Thyme.  My super picky 5-year-old kept saying, "Yum, this is SO good Mom! I'm going to eat it ALL!" Which she did. This is the same child who throws a fit about dinner every single night. My 11-month-old baby ate it up, too. My 3-year-old ate everything but the chicken (not a big meat eater).  It's creamy without being soggy; there's a perfect amount for each enchilada. I liked sauteeing the onion in the powder; it gave it a yummy carmelized flavor and appearance.   I lined my pan with foil and carefully removed enchiladas when done cooking. I would recommend spraying the foil with some Pam for easier removal. Cleanup was a breeze!   I think next time I would put some red sauce over the enchiladas before adding the remaining sour cream/soup mixture and cheese.

Very good, easy meal.  It definitely needed more spice..I shredded the chicken, added a packet of dry taco seasoning and added most (minus about 1/2 C) of the soup mixture.  I added some salsa to the remaining soup mixture for the top.  I use this recipe a lot!

These were great, my whole family loved them. I didn't have any chilies, but I did have a can of chipotle so I dumped that into the mix. They came out pretty spicy but good if you like spice! I also used butter instead of margarine. Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious, quick and easy. I added a 16 oz. can of refried beans. Spread equals amounts on each tortillas. I also subsituted one 13 oz. and one 4.5 oz. of canned chicken instead of cooked chicken and it was still just a good as the first time I tried it with cooked chicken.  I also used 98 percent fat free cream of chicken soup. By adding that soup, it cuts down the fat and adding refried beans adds 24 percent more fiber. Thanks for sharing this recipe for us to enjoy...very often.

these are one of my family's favorites. We got the recipe years ago from a friend. If you are in a hurry, you can substitute the chicken for canned chicken, which I usually do. I also add a bit of taco seasoning and some onions to it. I also use some diced canned jalapenos to spice it up.  It is good topped with sliced black olives too.

I'm honestly not sure how this recipe got such high ratings! After about two or three bites, I was done. The soup and cheese flavor was just so overpowering. The inside mix was yummy! Next time, I'll probably just omit the soup and spread sour cream on top after it's done cooking.

Excellent and easy. Adult and kid friendly and so easy. I used low fat soup,low fat sour cream and skim milk cheese and it was amazing with less fat.

I dont know why there are so many rave reviews for these!?  very, VERY bland with a mushy, soggy texture.  Sorry, but even with the addition of green enchilada sauce and some chopped tomatoes I still did not care for these.

This was wonderful!  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth and a splash of juice from a jar of jalapenos for more flavor.  Instead of chopping the chicken, I shredded it with a fork.  I added salsa verde (green mexican sauce) to the soup/sour cream mixture.  My boyfriend, sister, and brother-in-law all give it 5 stars and I can't wait to make it again!

I used this recipe EXACTLY, but threw two cans of red canned enchilada sauce on top.    I swear on the food bible that these were the best enchiladas I had ever eaten.  OMG DELICIOUS!

Great recipe.  I cooked my own chicken breast and added about a 1/2 cup of the broth to the sauce to be sure it was moist enough.  I also threw in a little left over jarred queso dip, which added a lot of spice.  I topped it with sliced jalapenos and cilantro leaves.

Delicious and super easy to use. I made a few modifications. I didn't have any cream of chicken soup so used cream of mushroom instead. And since my local store does not carry green chilis, I used some thinly sliced jalapeno peppers instead. Covered with foil for all but last 10 minutes of cooking to let the cheese brown. Yum!

Made this tonight and it was very good.  I made it as is and can see there are lots of ways you can mix and match with this.  I read in alot of the reviews that they doubled the sauce?  I don't even know what you would do with all that extra sauce.  I found the as is amount more than enough.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Quick, easy & tasty! I made a total of six, so I did not have to double the sauce--but I see why people do.  I added a couple of tablespoons of medium salsa to the chicken/onion mixture, and used 1/4 of an onion instead of the whole onion and added a little shredded pepper jack cheese to the mixture before filling the tortillas.  This is a definite keeper for my arsenal! THANK YOU!

These enchiladas were fantastic! I changed it up a bit to suite our taste. I omitted the margarine,(would've used olive oil, had I sauteed the onions) and onions. I used turkey rather than chicken. I added taco seasoning to the sour cream/soup mixture, as well as to the turkey. I used corn tortillas, rather than flour. I layered the ingredients, rather than mix them together. I also added black beans (my kids love beans:) I topped enchiladas with sour cream/soup mixture, cheese & enchilada sauce. My whole family loved this dish! Thanks for sharing.

Yum!! I doubled the soup and sour cream as suggested by many and used chipotle taco seasoning instead of chili powder to season the chicken which I shredded after boiling for about 1 1/2 hrs. Will make again. Thanks!

PERFECT!!! I added a little more chili powder to the chicken onion mixture to make that flavor stand out, plus a little cayenne pepper and white pepper to make it a little spicier.  I also added a chipotle corn salsa to the soup/sour cream mixture and I added about four tablespoons of the soup mixture to the chicken/onion because I wanted it to be creamier.  I also poured mild enchilada sauce over the top instead of the soup mixture to give it more flavor variety and to make it taste more authentic.  Seriously amazing!

I made these for my dad on Father's Day. He loved them along with everyone else in his office. I prepared everything and froze the pan. I gave it to him with baking instructions so that he could heat it up and eat it whenever he wanted. I followed the recipe without any modifications and it came out great (or so I hear)!

I use light sour cream and the healthy request cream of chicken soup and it still turns out great.  I bake my chicken with lots of seasoning and add a can of black beans or pinto beans to the mixture.  Great recipe!!

This is an awesome recipe!  I was leary with the chicken soup, but it turned out perfect.  I followed the recipe as written here and made it for a family mexican dinner.  Everyone raved about it, went back for seconds, and asked for the recipe!  This is definately a keeper and will be made in my house again!

This was so delicious.  I love refried beans, so I added a can of refried beans to the first layer of the soup mixture along the bottom of the dish.  I also mixed diced red peppers and spanish rice into the chicken mixture.  Mmmmmmm.

I made these and was a bit nervous using flour tortillas rather than corn. I figured they would be healthier and my boyfriend would like them more because he prefers flour. The only change I made was using taco seasoning in place of chili powder, they came out great. I topped them with shredded lettuce and fresh diced tomatos. Very easy, nice presentation and most important, very tasty.  thanks Jeri for a great recipe.

I absolutely love the dish. My fiance says these are the best chicken enchiladas he has ever had. The only thing that I do different is, I don't use only 1 cup of cheese...I pretty much cover it with cheese. LOVE IT!!!

These were impressive.  My husband does not like onions, so I substituted the onion for a tsp of onion powder instead.  Very good!

My boyfriend is a hard to please food critic. I made these enchiladas for him last week and he complimented me at least 30 times! We like things spicy, so I did add one addition to the recipe...1/2 packet of hot and spicy taco seasoning. Absolutely perfect!

My family celebrates "Tres de Mayo" yesterday at my house. (We were going to be unable to celebrate Cinco de Mayo on Tuesday, so we celebrated early...lol)  I made these Enchiladas for the first time and followed the recipe as writen.  My family and friends loved them.  Next time I think I want to try it with steak or sausage. Very very good with wonderful flavors.  Super easy to make too!

I've been making these for years and everyone loves them.  Easy meal to put together.  I make it even easier and buy pre-cooked baked chicken breasts from the deli at my grocery store and shred them.  Couldn't be any simpler....

This was great but I'll have to cut back on the chillies next time (and we like spicy food).  I will also grease the sides of the dish to stop the ends of the tortillas sticking.

This is a real crowd pleaser. One trick I learned to avoid 'tough' or 'chewey' torillas - warm some oil (any kind you prefer) in a skillet (about an inch deep - not real hot) and dip the tortillas in the warm oil just until moistened, then blot on paper towels before filling and rolling.

I made this recipe yesterday, took the advice of the other cooks, doubled the sauce mixture, used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken soup.  Used 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning and used a mexican cheese blend. I followed pretty much the recipe to build the enchiladas. My boyfriend who doesnt care for the red enchilada sauce absolutely loved these chicken enchiladas.  He couldnt believe how good they were.  Thanks for a tasty recipe.  I will be making these again.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used another persons advice and used Rotel with chili's instead of just chilies.  I also felt it wouldn't have enough of a Mexican flavor so I added about 1/4 can of enchilada sauce to the soup/sour cream mixture.  I also drizzled more on top before I baked it.  I think this made it much better, with a little zip but not crazy spicy.  I did also put cheddar cheese inside the enchiladas. We will have it again.  Next time I think I would sprinkle some diced lettuce and cold tomatoes over the top for some crunch.

Ehh...this recipe was just okay. I mixed some mild Picante Sauce and chili powder into the soup and sour cream mixture. I also added Pepper Jack Cheese to the chicken mix.  I added about 3 Tbsp. of the soup mixture into the chicken mix before filling the tortillas. Once everything was all cooked, I cut up green onions and added them on top of the finished enchiladas.  These are not something I'd make often, but maybe twice a year.

I did not add the chili powder, but instead added 1 package of taco seasoning mix.  This seemed to give it the flavor that it needed (otherwise, it seemed a little bland)  My family really enjoyed this EASY dish and I will make it again.

This is a tasty enchilada recipe. After reading the reviews, I tweaked it by cooking my 2 large chicken breasts in canned red enchilada sauce and shredding. I also added 1 cup of jack cheese and sprinkled some in the enchilada before rolling it up. I only gave it 4 stars because it really only makes 5 enchiladas. I used an 8x8 pan and didn't have to change the recipe amounts.

The whole family really enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used some seasoned taco meat (ground beef) that I had already in the freezer.  I have had this with chicken, and It's very good.  ALSO very good with taco meat.  We garnished with guac and pico de gallo and had a side of refried beans.  It's a keeper!

Very good!  I followed some suggestions and doubled the sauce (2 cans of cream of chicken and 8oz of sour cream).  I also added a can of Rotel and added a sprinkle of cheese inside each enchilada.  Before sprinkling the cheese on top, I also poured a small can of enchilada sauce over the whole concoction for a little extra kick.  Both my husband and I were very impressed!  I served it with Mexican Rice III also on this website.

Great recipe.  I tried using flour tortillas and corn to see which tasted better.  The corn definitely won.  It tasted more authentically Mexican.

I made these for guests, and ate it too. I had an average rating of about 4.  We all thought they were pretty good. Instead of flour tortillas, I used corn tortillas.  It gave better flavor, but made the enchiladas fall apart easier.  I also used a can of enchilada sauce. However, you couldn't really taste it.

great tasting dish, fairly easy to prepare and it's easy to alter the spiciness to desired taste. We like it spicy so we add a bit of chille powder and extra green peppers. Also, a tip for making it more spicy is to saute the onions in the chille powder before you add in the rest of the ingrediants.  A very tasty!

I used corn tortilla instead of flour (warm them in the microwave for a few seconds so they are pliable for rolling before filling) and for the chicken, I used one of those pre-cooked whole chickens from the grocery store and shredded/chopped it.  Very easy to make, very good- my husband loved it.  It makes great left overs for lunch the next day too.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I use left over chicken and shred it instead of cubing it.  Along with the onions I sautee some bell pepper with the chilli powder and cumin.  I use low fat sour cream (you can't tell the difference).  To the filling mixture I add home made salsa to give it a little more color and flavor.  I serve along with refried beans and spanish rice.  I hate sour cream and cream or anything soup, but I still love this recipe.

I made this tonight and it was DELICIOUS! I did not have all the ingredients needed, heres what I used: 1 can mild Rotel, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 cup chicken breast ( the pre-cooked kind) and chili powder. I heated that up in a skillet and then filled each tortilla with the mixture and I also added cheese inside each enchilada. I then poured the excess chicken/soup mixture on top and then sprinkled alot of cheese all over. I used about  2 cups of monterrey jack cheese ( personal preference). Then I baked about 15- 20 min. uncovered. I am going to try this over penne pasta next time I make it (with the ingredients I used tonight)  Thanks for the recipe...

I add some extras to this recipe, after i cooked the chicken I used a taco seasoning and mixed it in with the chicken, I also added a can of enchilada sauce over it and sprinkled with cheese before I baked it. This is now my husband's new favorite meal.

Our meal schedules have been out of sync, so I have been trying to make some dishes that are easy to throw together and that my teen likes and can grab and heat up when she needs to.  This was very easy and well received.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and added about 2/3rds of a cup to the chicken mixture. I used fire roasted green chile peppers and they added a lot more flavor than regular canned chile peppers.  If I was making this for myself and not the finicky child, I would have added some roasted red peppers as well.  Instead of chili powder I used roughly 2 Tablespoons homemade taco seasoning from this site.   I will always have these on hand in the freezer for an emergency dinner.  Not gourmet, but good!

YUMMY YUMMY!!!  I added a can of hot enchilada sauce to the soup/sour cream mixture, added close to a half cup to the chicken/onion mixture and put just a little bit of cheese inside the enchiladas as well as on top.  Also, I cut off about 1/3 of the tortilla before rolling.  I thought they rolled up nicer and were less bulky.  Awesome recipe.

This is a great recipe! I highly recommend keeping the chiles and chili powder as it can be bland without them. We use green onions. They add a bit of color and they taste just as good.

This was so good. It doesn't take long and its very easy. I added more chili powder and also some cayenne pepper in mine for more spice. Also I used monterey jack and cheddar. This was even better the next day for lunch! Thank you and good job

I have been making a similar variation of this recipe for years and it is always a winner. The only difference is I never thought of the chile powder...duh! Really adds to it and I overdo the cheese like I do on everything. A budget friendly tip is to use rottiserie chicken, already nice and flavorful, but go pick these up around 2-3 pm and they have some marked down, usually to half their original cost and they are as good as their frecher brethren.Thanks for posting.

Was a hit at for my son's birthday, he had THIRDS!  I added garlic salt and chipolte when coking the chicken, and it gave the recipe just enough kick. Will make this again.

Delicious - I omitted the green chilies, replaced them with about 5oz of medium salsa. I reduced to only 1/2 an onion, and added 1/2 a green bell pepper. I also reduced to just a dash of chili powder and replaced w/ 1 tbs of taco seasoning. To top it all off, i replaced the cream of chicken with cream of mushroom and it came out fabulous.

Very easy and very good! I added 1 can of enchalida sauce but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband loved these! I would have liked them a little spicier so in the future I may tweak the recipe a bit to add a little more spice. This recipe is very versatile and can be altered to your preference.

I made this, substituted 1 T Taco Sauce for the chili powder. Added a can of green enchilada sauce to the sour cream / soup mixture, and then added a can of black beans.

It was AMAZING. And super easy.

I really wanted to give this more stars.  It is a recipe I WILL use again, but it definately needs more of the sauce.  It didn't say to grease the pan so I didn't and the bottoms of the tortillas burnt to the bottom of the pan.  I'd double the sauce, put more sauce in the chicken mixture, and more under and on top. So it was minus one star for burning to the pan.  And one for a lack of sauce which made the tortillas crispy.  But I still recommend this recipe!

This is my absolute favorite way to use leftover roasted whole chicken in a meal.  This recipe is also the healthiest of all the chicken enchilada recipes on this site, and it's still delicious.  I even sub light sour cream in this recipe with no compromise on taste.  I add cumin, red peper, cayenne,  and garlic to the chicken while heating.  I also add some salsa to the sour cream/ soup mixture and add about 1/4- 1/3 cup to the chicken instead of 2 T.  I also used 8" tortillas 'cause 10" tortillas are unwieldy and tend to break apart when wserving.  Excellent recipe and a staple in our dinner lineup.

This was good, but I agree with others was bland,I had to eat it with Salsa...next time I will use the Taco seasoning instead of the Chili Powder like someone recommended and I will add Jalapeño Cheddar for some kick. 
It definitely needs a bit more flavor! But is a great base to build on!

I just made this less than 20 minutes ago and it was a big hit with my family. When I boiled my chicken breast I added 2 bouillon cubes, my onion, garlic and sliced bell peppers, allowed that to cook for about 45 minutes on low and than allowed it to cool off in the water before shredding everything together. I also added jack cheese to the soup mixture, and then I had some leftover meat mixture and placed that on top of the enchiladas.
Once again thanks, let's keep-em coming.

These were amazing.  I made them for a dinner party last night and we are still talking about them today! (Although I accidentally left out the green chiles-oops!)  So  I put them in a serving bowl to put on top.    I also cooked the chicken in salsa and put all the "cooked salsa" in with the chicken mixture.

This was so easy to make! Adding the soup/sauce at the bottom before adding the enchiladas is a nice touch. I seasoned the chicken breasts before cooking, and seasoned the cream mixture too. My husband loved it. So this will be a keeper; once a month!!

Very good! I made no changes and it was excellent! I've also tried this with black beans instead of chicken and its great!

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago and I must say it was very tasty. My husband loved them. But like the others said, next time I will use some fajita or taco seasoning for the chicken and add some chopped jalapenos to the mixture. Very good, not spicy enough for my liking.

I sent this along with my college student to spring break. It was a giant hit at the beach condo of 8 girls. Made the following changes: grilled boneless skinless chicken breast and shredded meat. Used low fat tortillias, spread tortillia with nofat refried beans, did not use the chillis since the group was picky about green specs, poured a large can of enchillada sauce on top and then added grated cheese, used all low fat items, added granulated garlic and taco seasoning mix.

Awesome dinner that even the picky kiddos ate!  I added a jar of salsa to the soup mix for some more flavor, shredded the chicken after microwaving it with cumin, garlic, onion and chili powders.  Next time  I will not add so many onions for the kids, but we loved them in it! Thanks- super easy too!

This was very good. My husband, who usually gets tired of me trying Mexican dishes, even said is was really good! I did double the sauce by adding one can of cream of chicken with one can of fiesta nacho cheese & a full cup of sour cream. I don't think there would have been enough without it. I also used a roasted chicken from the deli and just pulled the meat apart. Added more than 2 tbs of soup mixture to the chicken, along with just a little salsa and cumin. Next time I'm adding in jalapenos to add extra kick but this recipe is a keeper for sure!

The only things that I added to this wonderful recipe were chopped black olives sprinkled on top before baking and  substituted the cheese with packaged white queso cheese. It comes with jalapeno peppers already in the cheese. we love spicy foods so I still used the poblanos and everyone loved it, even my 7 year old grandaughter ( who had seconds). My husband thought that he didn't like chicken enchiladas, but he does now.

Great recipe!!! I mixed the chicken soup with mushroom soup and added sweetcorn to the chicken mixture. Add a little nutmeg and paprika to give the Enchiladas a rustic and rich bite. Serve with refried beans and a baby leaf spinach and feta salad - see how impressed your family will be... mine was!

I love this recipe!! I would give it 4.5 stars actually. I have made this over ten times now and it is always wonderful. I use leftover rotisserie chicken breast for this. I add a few tablespoons of green chili sauce to the filling and sprinkle cheese inside as well. Then I also pour green chili on top before I add the cheese. I usually make 4-5 with this, making them nicely stuffed and find there is enough sauce for them in an 8x8 pan. They even reheat well!

I doubled the sour cream and added 1 cup of cooked corn to the filling.  This was very good, but I felt it definitely needed more sauce inside.  It was more chunky than I expected.  Also, next time I will use fajita seasoning on the chicken.  It needed a tad more flavor.  Other than that we enjoyed it.

I love this type of chicken enchilada and this recipe was great - sauce on the top and on the bottom, inside...  I added cheese to the interior and made extra sauce.  Wonderfully simple but a favorite of mine.  thanks

I really liked this but since I had to make some adjustments I gave it 4 stars.  I needed to add some color to this, it was too white...I added some enchilada sauce to both the meat mixture and the soup mixture, it just looked better to me.  Plus, it gives it more kick!  Of course, more cheese...is it ever possible to have too much cheese, I don't think so.

This was good. I've never had enchiladas before so I don't have anything to compare them to. My husband and father said they were "okay", my mother said they were very good and my four year old daughter said it was "yucky". After a mixed response like that I don't know that I would make them again but I imagine that if enchiladas are your thing than you'll love these.

Wow. These were so good. I ended up using 3 chicken breasts that I chopped and cooked in a skillet with the onion and some ground black and cayenne pepper. I also added about 10 jalapeño slices (minced) to the mix since my husband doesn't like green chilies.  It turned out great and made 2 9x9 pans.

I doubled the sauce as others had suggested, using 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 of queso cheese.  I also used ground turkey because I didn't have chicken on hand, but it still turned out wonderfully.  Definitely a keeper!

This dish is DELICIOUS! I myself made a few adjustments to fulfill my taste; I followed every step of the cooking process but added a few things. 1. I added Thick N’ Chunky Salsa (make mine medium) and Campbells condensed Nacho Cheese soup to the soup and sour cream mix (enough to satisfy you) 2. I seasoned the chicken while boiling and instead of chopping the meat I shredded it 3.I added 1 tablespoon of butter instead of margarine, then added the onion and chili powder and sprinkled a little taco seasoning while sautéing 4. I added the chicken and soup mixed along with about 3-4 tablespoons of the condensed nacho cheese soup and stirred until heated through and spooned a bit of the soup mixture to every enchilada before wrapping. 5. After the wrapping  process I spooned enchilada sauce along with the remainder of the soup mix and then added the cheddar cheese. I served this dish with a side of sour cream and salsa, everyone loved it!

Yummy!  First really good 5 I've had on here for a while.  (I reserve 5's for the really good stuff.)  I cheated a bit and used canned chicken cause I was being lazy, and that certainly made this recipe a snap.  About all I can say is that for me they only filled 6 tortillas, and also didn't consider it 8 servings.  They were filling but didn't seem to 'stick' for long.

I love this recipe!  Since I like a lot of meat in my enchiladas, I use extra chicken. Also, if you don't like things too spicy, cut back on the chili powder, 2 teaspoons is way too much, I only use 1 and it was plenty! I also use more than 2 tablespoon of the soup mixture and use reduce fat sour cream, you can't tell the difference, still rich and creamy! I top it off with enchilada sauce and for the last 10 mins of baking, cover with cheese on top, it was perfection!!!

I thought this recipe was very good. I made a few changes to suit our tastes. I boiled three chicken breasts in chicken broth first and then shredded it. I then doubled the sauce (2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 full cup of sour cream). I used 98% fat free soups and light sour cream in order to reduce fat and calories. I used the same amount of green chilis (4 oz) and felt I could have doubled that as well. I think the chicken paired with the onions and chili powder was a great filling for the enchiladas. I sprinkled low fat Mexican cheese on top and added chopped green onions once it was done baking. Took 45 minutes to bake at 350 degrees. Good recipe!

An added suggestion for those of us who are home even later than 5:15 (more like 7 for me!) I used canned chicken and sauteed in some pepper jack cheese with the chicken, chiles, and soup mixture. The prep time was obviously cut way down. It turned out great!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! I have made it several times, most recently for my daughter's 9 year old friends during her birthday sleepover. I had 2 very picky eaters there, and they asked for seconds, ALL OF THEM! My daughter continued to ask for this this for the next 2 days, and became disappointed when there was no more left. My husband loves it too. Doubling the sauce is a must, and preparing the chicken ahead of time - the day before is necessary if you are short on time. I use my George Foreman grill to speed things up. Excellent, this has become part of my regular menu.

This is a definite keeper.  I seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning while it cooked and it was awesome!

I was looking for a recipe to at least come close to my mother in-law's chicken enchiladas without having to call and ask... and my husband finished his plate (rare) and just loved it!  It's hard to compare to mom so I'm excited to have found a winner!  I did add some ground cumin, coriander, and cayenne for flavor and spice, but otherwise, stuck to the recipe. I agree w/previous poster that a double portion of sauce would be well worth it.

Great recipe! I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions and tweaked it a bit myself to great reviews by my husband, 10 y.o. and 2 y.o. I used about a pound and a half of chicken and boiled it in chicken broth then cut into small pieces (chopped). For the sauce I used 1 can of cream of chick soup, 1 can of Campbells chicken verde soup, 1 cup of sour cream, the browned onions and some chili powder and cumin and salt and pepper and to it all I added about 1/2 cup of enchilada verde sauce I'd bought in a can. I added a little of the sauce to the chopped chicken so it wouldn't be dry, filled and wrapped the tortillas up then covered them all in the casserole dish with about 1 cup of the canned enchilada verde sauce then added the remaining sauce and topped w/cheese and baked for the recommended time then broiled to brown the cheese a little. Added cilantro to some as a garnish.

i took people's advice, i added green enchilada sauce into the soup mixture and it was SOOOO yummy ...i used more onion because my husband LOVES onions and a little more cheese...i doubled the recipe and froze it so my husband can take them to work and they freeze great! instead of flour tortillas i used yellow corn and doubling the batch made about 20.. these are really good enchiladas as a base :)

this is a good basic recipe although I modified a bit to fit our tastes....increasing the sour cream to about 1 full cup, seasoning with chili powder & cumin, cilantro, and using white corn tortillas.

This was prety good. I only made a few changes. I sauted the onions, and I added taco seasoning when I mixed in the chicken and chiles. The recipe didn't seem to call for enough sauce, so I topped with enchilada sauce. Will make again!

This is by far the best Chicken Enchilada recipe, I have tried others on this site, and this is not only the easiest to make, it is the best! I have followed the recipe exact but I find it easier to make the chicken the night before and I put the majority of the soup mix in with the chicken and the rest of the sauce I put on top. This is definitely a favorite.

This is DELICIOUS! I did change it up a bit just to add that little extra oomph. I add a can of enchilada sauce to the soup/sour cream mixture. I also like to add green peppers and sometimes jalapenos when I saute the onion with the chili powder. This adds extra spice to the dish if that is what you like.

These were so good that I couldn't get enough!!  I cooked the chicken with just a little olive oil and crushed garlic before shredding.  I used 10 inch torillas and made 5 large enchiladas.  I also used Mexican blend cheese.  I will def be making this recipe again and agian!!

Out of all the chicken enchilada recipes on this site that I've tried, these are my favorite! I add jalapenos on top because my boyfriend and I like spicy stuff and I use a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of chicken. We top ours with salsa and more sour cream. They always come out soooo good!

I loved how easy to make and tasty this recipe was. To reduce the fat, I substituted with fat free sour cream, low-fat cheese, and used PAM to sautee the onions. Everything was wonderful. We will use this again.

We loved these! Great weekday meal if you have leftover chicken, but even if not, purdue shortcuts are perfect.  We like them cheesy, so I add some cheese to the chicken mixture.  Yummmyy ... and never a leftover!  This one gets 5 stars.

Our guests loved this - it was hearty, easy to prepare, and looked good on the plate.  I served it with the guacamole salad bowl, also from Allrecipes.com and it made a great meal.

Be sure you use the 8 inch tortillas, as the recipe calls for - I bought the larger size and had to trim them to fit in the casserole dish.

Also, as others have suggested, double the soup and sour cream mixture so you can be sure you have enough to go around.

This is a great recipe for using up leftover chicken! I made some changes...used cream of mushroom soup, a can of diced tomatoes & green chilis, and had no tortillas so used pita bread...it actually turned out REALLY good, my 3 year old had seconds! :)

This recipe made my first time making enchiladas a success! I only gave it four stars b/c I did not fix it exactly like the recipe. I seasoned my chicken with garlic powder while cooking and then shredded it by hand. I also used a half of packet of taco seasoning instead of chili powder and salsa instead of chili peppers. I used a mix of cheeses that I had on hand and added it to the mixture also. I thought the soup was too thick so I added some naco cheese and covered that with more shredded cheese. It was delish! My husband is begging for us to have it again tonight and my 3 year old even liked it! Thanks for the recipe and the ideas!

Easy and great recipe, but needed a little spice- I added 3 Tablespoons of Cayenne Petter Sauce and doubled the chili powder. Also poured a little chicken taco seasoning (liquid form) on top to add flavor to the zing

This was terrific!  I added in mushrooms and peppers and accidentally forgot the chiles, and I used half chili powder and half taco seasoning - but it was still delicious and so easy!  Makes a LOT!  We will definitely make this again!

This is FABULOUS!!!!
I made this for dinner tonight and it was sooooo good. Really good on a cool autumn night.
Instead of chilis I used hot salsa.
I was disappointed because my tortillas were old and stale and when I tried to roll them they just split down the middle. I used them anyway and after taking this out of the oven the tortillas were softer and it was just wonderful!!!!
I love it and it will be made everytime I get craving for Enchiladas.
Thank you so much for this recipe!

Pretty good, nothing amazing. The sauce is too thick and the chicken is a little bland. Much, much better the next day, though, as the flavors blended a little more.

A little tricky to serve (contents of tortilla spilled out the sides a bit), but guests raved.  I doubled the sauce as per others recommendations.  What little was left over reheated nicely.  Adding this to my dinner rotation.

Very good.  I was skeptical of the soup - I have had others that used soup and they seemed balnd, but this is a good combination of spicy meat with smooth souuup sauce.  This will be our new regular enchiladas.  I used turkey and corn tortillas instead of chicken and flour tortillas.

It was surprisingly very good. The sauce was a little too chickeny and thick for us though. Overall I will be making it again and maybe play with the sauce part more.

I have had Chicken Enchiladas in the past and they were not that good. This recipe is delicious! My husband is not one to compliment a meal except to say its ok, and this one he said was good and ate three of the enchiladas. I added cheese to the inside of the enchiladas like others had suggested. Other than that I did what the recipe said exactly! I am making this again soon!

Everyone in my family liked this, even my picky 10-year old.  It was a little bit bland.  If you have not tried the smoked chipotle Tobasco sauce, this would be an excellent place to sprinkle some on top.  It gave this dish a wonderful flavor.

Absolutely repulsive. Overly salty, and cloying creaminess. I should have paused when the recipe called for cream of mushroom soup.

this recipe was okay.  used precooked chicken from the store and served with a side of refried beans.  wasn't very spicy (might not have used enough chili powder)

I gave this 5 stars because the reviews on Christmas Eve were great - everyone loved them.  I think I'd change something in the sauce though to either make them more sour creamy or cheesier - maybe use a different kind of soup?  I don't know - they are delicious though and the filling is fantastic.  Thanks!!

This impressed my mother-in-law when she came to visit. We have it at least once a month - sometimes doubling the cheese. Yum! Works well with reduced fat sour cream and fat free soup.

These enchiladas are fantastic!  I used a little bit less than the recommended soup/sour cream mix so they wouldn't get soggy, and they were great.

Loved this recipe.  I used mild chile peppers and cut the chili powder in half (we can't handle spicy) and was still great.  Used some milk to thin out the sauce which is very thick.  Can't wait to make again!

This is a great basic recipe. Feel free to experiment. The main thing is the sauce: I added a cup of Enchilada Sauce to the Cream of Chicken/Sour Cream mixture. By mistake, I had purchased "Hot" sauce instead of mild. Turned out to be serendipitous--if I had purchased "Mild" the flavor would have been somewhat lacking. I also added, besides the chili powder, a healthy dose of Lawry's taco seasoning. otherwise I think it would have been a bit bland. Also, to save time: cut up raw chicken into 2" chunks: immerse into boiling water--it will take less time than sauteeing. When done, shred with two forks.

I thought the basic recipe was a bit bland, so I added some red pepper flakes and extra chili powder to the chicken mixture. Also added a can of red enchilada sauce over the top to make it not so dry.

I made this recipe for my picky boyfriend and he loved it. I took the addvice of other reviews and used chicken verde soup instead of the cream of chicken. I also added 1/4 cup of salsa and taco seasoning to the chicken mixture to give it more of a kick. With a few small changes, this is a great and easy recipe.

Very good!  I added 1/4t of cumin to sauce, along with garlic salt and pepper to taste. Made with fat-free soup,low-fat sour cream, and it was still great.

I sliced some chicken breasts into thin pieces (vs shredding). Used 99% fat free soup, reduced fat sour cream, and added most of a can of green enchilada sauce.  Also used whole weat tortillas (husband didn't notice).  I usually shy away from any recipes that call for condensed soups (for fear of gloppy messes) but this one was good-- next time I may increase the sour cream to soup ratio to get some more tang!  Thanks for a new way to eat leftovers!

Great Recipe.  Hubby and I enjoyed and will make again.  I did add a can of rinsed black beans with the chicken.  Next time I will probably add another can of chili's and on hubby's some chopped Jalapenos for more kick.

This was really good.  However, I will scale the onion back to 1/2 or 1/4 of an onion next time I make it.  One whole onion was just too overpowering.  But, overall, this was a fantastic recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

My first time making enchiladas and I hit a homerun!  Fabulous recipe.  Only ingredient I added was a small can of enchilada sauce for some zip.  You could also top the enhiladas with salsa for some spice too.  I used a store-bought rotisserie chicken to save time, too.

The recipe that I have made for years is so similar that I don't want to submit a recipe that is so similar, so I will just add a few options:  first, I always grill the  chicken (4 or 5 chicken breasts)---It is the timeliest step but the flavor is unbeatable...I don't add seasonings, just grill the chicken.  Then I cut in bite sized strips.  I occasionally  add olives, always add garlic powder and  I top with a ton of cheddar and offer additional sour cream as a topping.  They are so creamy with all the sour cream and the soup mix.  I have never had anyone refuse them and while I was still dating I would make them for boyfriends.  They were always impressed and delighted.  For the sides, I would serve blue tortilla chips, home-made salsa and home-made blended margaritas. ole!

This is the best recipe for chicken enchiladas! We loved it & it was very easy to prepare! Tastes just as yummy as going out to eat mexican. Definitely serving this again but next time I will double the soup mix as suggested in the reviews! Thanks.

These were great! I didn't change anything about the recipe and it only made 5 enchiladas but I might have been using tortillas that were too large.  There were only 2 of us anyway so no big deal.

This recipe was great but I did tweak it a bit.  I doubled the sauce mixture and added 1/4 cup salsa to it as well with a pinch of salt and 1/2 t. taco seasoning.  When I sauted the onions I put the green peppers, chili powder and 1 t. taco seasoning in it as well and then transferred it to a blender with 1/4 cup sauce and 1/2 cup salsa.  Blended it so that my kids would eat it. They don't like chucks of peppers or tomatoes.  Returned it to pan and mixed it in with my chicken.  Rolled the tortillas up with a little cheese in with the chicken mixture.  I used a whole bag of cheese too since i put it in the tortillas and I sprinkled the rest on top of the dish. Any left over chicken I also mixed in with the soup mixture and poured it over the top. I got rave reviews over this.  My 7 year old loved it too.  Very yummy and I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked this, but should have looked at reviews and doubled the soup mixture.  The only things I changed was I used 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder (I put garlic powder in just about everything) and I used only half a can of chiles knowing my 2 and 4 year olds wouldn't go for too much of that well!! Very good and will adjust it and try it again very soon!!

SO EASY!!  I added Jimmy Dean hot sausage to the chicken (and ended up with closer to 3 cups of meat), one more can of green chilis, and used the mexican three-cheese already grated.  Agree that a little more soup would be good.  It was superb.  Best enchilada recipe I've found.

These are pretty good enchiladas.  I did do a few things different, though.  I chopped up some fresh anahiems rather than using canned peppers.  Instead of using extra soup, I added some fresh salsa to the mixture and added an extra dollop of sour cream.  I used corn tortillas and had to double the cheese because I put some inside the enchiladas in addition to on top.  I will be making these again!

This was so good both my husband and I loved it! I took the advice of a couple of people. Some said to double the soup and others said to leave it as is. I used 1 1/2 cans of soup and thought it was just right, not dry, not soggy. I also added cheese inside the enchiladas and served it with mexican rice and refried beans. This is definetly one I will use again.

Delicious!  I used whole wheat tortillas and light or fat free ingrediants and it was still awesome.  My only suggestion is to double the soup and use one can of green chiles with tomatos to add some flavor.

My family really enjoyed this, the sour cream flavor is very nice.  Instead of "rolling" enchiladas I made it "casserole" style.  I ended up using only four of the tortillas (used two for each layer) and doubled the amount of cheese, using half as a layer in the middle of the casserole and then as the recipe says sprinkling the rest on top.  Thanks!

These are pretty good, but are very dry. I would top with some green enchilada sauce or something before baking next time.

This recipe was delicious!  The only thing I would change is to double the sauce.  I would have given the recipe 5 stars, but it was a little dry, nothing that doubling the sauce wouldn't fix.  Will definately make again, but will just make that one adjustment.  Overall, good recipe!

Very Delicious.  My husband couldn't stop talking about them.  I used a whole frozen bag of Tyson pre-cooked fajita chicken. A lot easier and a lot tastier. A similar recipe from a church cookbook that I have, doubles the sauce, chicken, and cheese as other reviewers have done.  I had enough filling for 9 enchiladas and also had plenty to put on top.  It seemed a little too soupy before I put it in the oven, but when I took it out it was perfect. I definitely prefer the flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas as most enchilada recipes call for.  Thanks so much!

I make these a lot:  I have started using the Southwest pepperjack soup instead of cream of chicken.  I double the sauce.  I also use chopped jalapenos instead of green chilis.

This was fabulous!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I sliced  uncooked chicken breast into strips and cooked with the butter and onion then removed chicken and shredded it before adding it back to the onion,then added the chili powder. I also added some Hatch green chile enchilada sauce to the chicken mixture and put some on top after the soup mixture.  Hubby loved it!

This is now one of my family's favorites!  I also add chopped black olives to the top when I bake, and then I put the cheese on top of it.  I serve with a generous dollup of sour cream as well.  YUM!!

Excellent recipe for entertaining!
I doubled the sauce recipe and added shredded kraft Nacho cheese to the meat mixture.  I also added 3/4 jar of Herdez green sauce to the remaining sauce mixture which i spooned on the enchiladas and then loanded with Nacho cheese on top.  My guests loved them and wanted the recipe - a new "fave" to add to my personal collection of recipes!!!!

This is a really great recipe!!! My family loved it!! Just make sure you spray some pam on the casserole dish before you put in the soup mixture. My enchiladas stuck to the dish. Other than that is was great!!! Would recommend to friends!!!

This was very good.  I sprinkled some extra chili powder, onion flakes, black pepper, and cilantro under the cheese.  I put a few jalapenos inside the enchiladas and used a mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar.  I used the lowfat soup and sour cream also.  My husband loved this, and he is kind of picky about mexican food.  This is a great alternative to a sweet red sauce!

Very very good! I used 2 fresh jalapenos and used only 4 large tortillas for the recipe. We like our enchiladas very full and I found the amount to be just perfect! Delicious recipe, will definately make again.

Just awesome!  I made it for the first time when company was coming over.  They wouldn't stop talking about how good it was.  I've made it again many times since.  I serve it with a recipe for dirty rice that I found on this site.  What a great meal, Barb in BC Canada

This has quickly become one of our favorite recipes!  I've modified it for our tastes and now use, fat free tortillas, low fat cream of chicken soup and low fat sour cream.  Still works wonderfully!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely amazing!  The first time I made enchiladas, and they were better than most restaurants.  Couple of changes/additions: I cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast in salt, pepper, garlic & ginger paste, a stick of cinnamon, a couple of cloves, and a cardamom.  then for the step in the recipe, before sauteeing the onion, I added cumin seeds to the oil, and added chopped serranos.
Huge hit!  Served with canned vegetarian Trader Joes refried beans, and canned corn kernels as two sides.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe.  I decreased the sour cream to one cup, added a bit of cumin seasoning, and increased the cheese to 2 cups.  I also pour cream or half & half over the top before adding the cheese.  Leftovers are as good as the first day!

They came out soggy for me...the enchiladas didn't get "toasty brown" or stay wrapped. Just very soggy. Lost the taste; I will not be making this again.

These were a big hit! I didn't use pre cooked chicken. I sliced very thin raw chicken breast( shredded chicken is more authentic) and added to onion mix ( used only half onion) with additional margarine to fry. Also added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder. I only got 6 enchiladas out of this :o( I wanted more! Also added some grated cheddar to the filling. I also would like more sauce. My Mexican sister in law makes fantastic food and she uses a tomato sauce in her chicken enchiladas so I was leary of trying this, but was pleasantly surprised. I would try this version on her, I think she would like it. Please don't leave out the jalapenos, they are very important to Mexican cooking. Thanks Jeri,loved it!

Thanks for this easy to make recipe Jeri. I did add more sour cream to the soup mixture and added garlic and a can of tomato sauce to the meat mixture. I was a bit leery of this recipe because of the soup, but it was very delicious.

So easy and simple!  Tastes GREAT!!  Very easy to put together and bake.  I made some spanish rice to go with it and my husband and I loved it!  I had this at a friends house (see next review) and knew I had to make this for my husband.  I think my husband tends to doubt my cooking capabilities at times, but he said he really loved this.  Definate keeper!  Thanks Jeri!!!

Simply fabulous!!! This recipe was so easy to make and we had NO LEFTOVERS!!!! My best friend was over for dinner and she couldn't believe how easy and tasty it was to make!!! We boiled the chicken and shredded it. Next time I might use 2 cans of soup and 1 cup sour cream instead of 1 can and 1/2 cup sour cream. It wasn't dry or anything, I just liked the sauce! Thanks so much Jeri...this was great!!!

I will start by saying that I'm not a big fan of recipes that contain cream of chicken soup, so why I tried this I do not know! I didn't care for this dish much.  It wasn't bad tasting. It was just that the cream of chicken soup made it very rich and I missed the enchilada sauce that the cream of chicken soup seemed to be a substitute for.  If you like cream of chicken soup in your recipes you will probably feel differently than I do about this one.

OMG this is the bomb recipe.  I normally do not alter recipes as written, but after viewing the rave reviews of this recipe, I spiced it up a bit as others mentioned using the chili powder, taco seasoning and diced up jalapenos inside each enchilada (yes my family does like it spicy).  I additionally doubled the sauce as was just perfect.  Thank you for your recipe, it was a high hit with my family.  I know this will be my go to recipe for chicken enchiladas.

I made this recipe exactly how it reads with the only swap being real butter for margarine. I made it earlier in the afternoon for dinner the same night which made for an easy dinner. 

Overall, it was a great recipe. My hubs and I both really enjoyed it and I now have another yummy dinner to add to my dinner rotation. Two thumbs up!

love it. though i gave this recipe my own twist. adding minced jalapeños, onion, cilantro, red & green peppers & a couple splashes of lime juice to the chicken. putting a tad of that soup mix onto the enchilada tortillas with the chicken/salsa mix. then roll the enchiladas. then cover enchiladas (in bake-ware) with red   enchilada sauce, & cover with. then bake.

I made a few changes that have made a world of difference: 
1) I use rotisserie chicken
2) I mix one can of soup and one can of MILK instead of sour cream over medium heat until combined and sauce like. 
3) Instead of adding chiles, I put pepper jack cheese inside the tortilla and cheddar on top.

This is an awesome recipe....it’s definitely a keeper. I made my chicken in the crock pot with alittle bit of jalapeño juice and a tablespoon of taco seasoning and then shredded the chicken when it was done. I did double the sauce and added some jalapeño juice for some spice. It’s an easy and delicious recipe!

My husband raved over these enchiladas. I only gave them 4 stars because my true enchilada loves are made with corn tortillas which aren’t American main stream. This is what I did to add to the existing recipe. I doubled the soup/sour cream sauce mixture (using 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of green enchilada sauce, both 10 oz). I also used a 2 cup cheese bag of shredded cheddar. I used 16oz pack of seasoned shredded chicken (this cut down on a ton of time). I also seasoned with about 1 tbsp cumin. I added an additional 1 cup of the soup mixture in the chicken to give it more moisture when laying into the tortillas. Served it with my Spanish rice and refried black beans topped with cojita (white crumbly Spanish cheese) or similar type cheese on top. Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly. It had a very rich, slightly sweet taste. I can only assume the taste was due to the sour cream. If I make this again, I will use less sour cream.

It’s an ooey gooey American casserole, and quite a tasty one. It is perfectly designed to make use of leftover poultry in the refrigerator that becomes magically rehydrated and tasty.  I use reduced sodium cream of chicken soup and put a tiny sprinkle of Lawtys on the onion while it sautées, otherwise the dish can easily become too salty.  Really nice recipe.

This is a good go to recipe on a weeknight. I use taco seasoning instead of chili powder. I also add a cheese sauce like queso or regular Velveeta to soup mixture. I also add cheese before I roll each one. So good!

My family liked this dish, I had four cups of left over chicken that I wanted to use up so I added an additional can of soup ......... Cream of Cheddar. Since the volume was larger, I decided to layer this dish especially since all the tortillas I had were corn and wouldn't be getting soggy.  It was more like a Mexican Lasagna.  I doubled the chili powder, added a tablespoon of cumin and Mexican oregano.  I also added a small can of sliced olives, a handful of chopped dried scallions and one chopped tomato ( I soaked up most of the runny juice with paper towels, and spread them over the top of the casserole with the shredded cheese).  This casserole made enough for  four hungry people (adults) to finish or enough for 6-8 sides if your serving other dishes or desserts.  I did serve this with sour creme, salsa and guacamole.  Four adults eat every morsel! 
I do notice on All Recipes that a lot of people complain about blandness of some of the recipes, you have to remember that these are all BASE recipes and that every recipe is open for you to make "your own to suit".  I myself have been know to take a 3 star and "make it my own" until I consider it a 5 star!  Try it, you'll be much happier with All Recipes in the future!

I've lived in the SW US most of my life, and rarely if ever have I ever had any kind of enchiladas from a Mexican restaurant made with flour tortillas.  When I decided to try to make my own, I was surprised that most of these enchilada recipes use flour tortillas - and, I've made a few of these recipes, AND, without fail every time I have used flour, they are always soggy!  The filling makes the bottoms wet and sticky, and for leftovers, forget it!  So, I decided to make my variation using this recipe as a filling (VERY good!), but using CORN tortillas, like the restaurants do.  Dipped each tortilla in red enchilada sauce well, filled with this recipe's filling, rolled and put in lightly sprayed glass 9X13, then topped off all of them with rest of the soup/sour cream mix per this recipe;  further, poured thick dribble of red enchilada sauce over entire pan of food, topped with healthy dose of shredded cheese- trying to be as short as I can here.  Turned out WONDERFUL!!!  I did add fresh roasted green chili from New Mexico to the filling - just my preference.  I'd HIGHLY recommend trying the corn tortillas by dipping them well in the sauce, fill, etc.  Sorry so long.

I used a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup instead, added a can of salsa with chilies as well, and shredded the chicken, but the chicken came out dry and the wraps soggy. Kinda the opposite of what I wanted to happen.

This was great! I personally don’t like sour cream so I didn’t use any and I used more of the soup on the inside and added some red enchilada sauce ???? perfect!

I added this to my cart without really looking at the ingredients. I think this recipe, as is, seems half completed. But I added to it and the finished result was great! I mixed the soup and sour cream before realizing it needed some finishing touches. Because I had already mixed the entire amount I ended up adding 2 whole jars of green salsa to the mix to make it flavorful and give it a little kick. I then sautéed the onions in a little extra butter and added the chicken UNCOOKED. I cooked the chicken and seasoned to taste with garlic powder, hot chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and then added the can of green chilies. I then mixed a bit of cheese into the chicken mix before rolling, coating in the sauce mix, adding a layer of cheese, and then baking. I did NOT need to add any of the sauce to the filling since I cooked it together the chicken stated very moist. It would have been way too wet with sauce inside. Spray the bottom of the baking dish with cooking spray, do not put sauce in the bottom unless it is a very tiny bit. It takes nothing for them to become very soggy on the bottom.

My fiancée says these are better than what you can expect at most restaurants and finished his plate in about 5 minutes! I followed some of the tips below including:         1.   Prepping the chicken prior! Saved a lot of time and gave the mix more flavor after sitting.    2. Used 1/4 of an onion added half a can of Rotel! Gave it some delicious flavor.     3. Heated the tortillas in some foil for about 5 minutes and made them easier to wrap!     4. Also added some taco seasoning to the chicken which made it very delicious.    5. Made double the sauce, but think next time I’ll add some spice and Chile’s to the sauce too!       In case you can’t tell from the way I’m describing the process, the food turned out absolutely delicious! Highly recommend making.

This was easy to make, especially if you have precooked and shredded your chicken breast. With the chicken prepped, this is easily a come-home-from-work-and-have-dinner-on-the-table-in-under-an-hour meal. That said, I recommend tweaking it a bit. I followed the recipe exactly except I was out of chili powder so I used a tablespoon of taco seasoning instead as other reviewers have recommended. The chicken mixture that goes inside the enchiladas is delicious. I found the "sauce" that you spread on once the enchiladas are rolled and in the casserole dish to be rather bland. I would definitely recommend adding a can of enchilada sauce or Rotel like other people have suggested. Also, even with a very small amount of the chicken mixture in each tortilla, I only got 6 enchiladas. I'd definitely double the chicken. I served this with chips and salsa and salad. Next time I might also make guacamole and have sour cream on the side too. I'd make this again.

Followed the instructions as stated and the taste was fine for my wife.  For me I could have used additional flavor so I will add 1T of adobe the next time.

I added 1 cup of homemade chicken stock to the soup/sour cream mixture to thin it a little. I also added about 1/4 cup of chopped roasted tomatoes to the chicken & peppers mixture. They were so good!!

This was Excellent! Easy to make. I made them in my electric skillet. Once the cheese melted and they bubbled a bit, they were great, with the underside toasty - added to the flavor.

I liked the recipe, but having read the suggestions of the previous reviewers and tidbits from all of the other enchilada recipes posted, I made a few changes.
I doubled the recipe and thank goodness I did, it was gone! I added half a cubanelle pepper, 1 tsp cumin & 1 garlic clove and added 1C cheddar to the chicken mixture. I also added about a half cup broth to the soup mixture as it was quite thick. I also fried the (corn) tortillas in a scant amount of oil for 5 seconds on each side. I loved it, they didn't break at all when rolled. My big mistake was using lowfat mexican blend cheese to top (2C) as it doesn't really melt. This made a batch of 20,  9x13 and 8x8 pans. Thanks for the inspiration!

This is very good followed exactly as recipe states. We experimented by substituting the chicken with shrimp & scallops, leaving out the chili powder. We used shredded white cheeses (a mix of Mozzarella/Parmesan/Provolone/Asagio/Romano). FANTASTIC! We complimented the dish with a light salad: arugula w/chopped mango and a dressing of lime juice and olive oil.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I made it for my partner and our roommates a few weeks ago, and they STILL rave about it! I didn't use the canned chilies and instead used fresh jalapeños, which I really enjoyed. I doubled the sauce per other reviews but didn't think it was really necessary (so good no matter what). I thought just cheddar cheese would be boring or overwhelming, but it absolutely wasn't. One day I'll try adding pepper jack, but I'm so in love with the recipe as is that it won't be for a while. I served it with homemade guacamole

These were excellent! Gave 4 stars because I did make a few changes. Cooked about 2 chicken breasts in the slow cooker ahead of time with some taco seasoning and cut into chunks when cool. Used half an onion because that’s what I had and 3 green onions (saved green parts to sprinkle on top) and a teaspoon of cumin along with chili powder. Added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes, drained, to the chicken mixture and the other half to the soup mixture. I had to add about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the soup mix because it was too thick to pour. Added a little cheese inside each enchilada and I got about 7 after filling pretty full. We topped with avocado, fresh diced tomato, leftover green onions and sour cream. I will keep this one and make again.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written with one exception. I used green enchilada sauce because that is what my husband likes.   I took to a beach party and everyone loved it.  It is full of flavor and very moist. My husband said it was the best dish at the party.  I will make this one again.

I followed this pretty close except added about a cup salsa verde into the soup mixture.  I bought a rotisserie chicken and cut that up.  Tortilla package had 10 in them, used all.

Meh...  I think recipe is off a bit as I used 3 cups of chicken and only rolled 5 tortillas.  Tasted good, but too American, maybe needs some salsa roja or verde before serving up?  I'll def mod this dish up next time.

Loved the dish. I added some hot sauce and homemade taco seasoning to the mixture to spice it up.

I made it exactly as it said too no added stuff no changes I hate when people rate the recipe and it not even the recipe listed it's something they added to it or changed. It is a required taste out of seven people only three of us liked it myself included. It's not spicy at all and if your someone that has problems with eating textures like bananas this is not for you because the sauce on the top. It has a good flavor though and it's not hard to make.

no changes for the first batch... minor seasonings added for subsequent batches...yes, BATCHES...My main addition is usually more shredded chicken, and more cheeses.  I like to mix some shredded cheese into the sauce mixture as well. This is a super simple, good tasting mild enchilada.

This is a good recipe if you have little ones. It tastes very good but is kind of bland. A lot more ingredients could be added to spice it up. My biggest complaint is that there is not nearly enough filling to  make eight enchiladas. There is only enough for about four which isn't enough to feed a family of four. You would need to double the recipe to make eight.

These enchiladas were great. I used Campbells nacho cheese type soup instead of the cream of chicken. It was delicious. I also used Green Chile sauce instead of just green chili's themselves. It made the chicken really moist, and added some great flavor!

I didn't double the sauce and they were still delicious and plenty moist. I did do 1 cup sour cream and added about 1/4 cup of taco sauce.  I also added peppers with the onions and spinach in the tortilla, per another review's recommendation. Best we've ever had!

I am not reviewing the original as I think this recipe was originally Campbell Soup's and I've used it for years. I use this the second day after a roast chicken dinner where we always have half leftover. I always add enchilada sauce, sometimes red, sometimes green depending on what I have but always have one of them. I don't cook the onions or chicken again as they get to temp during the bake - usually I put it together the night before and slap it in the oven when I get home from work. The wife and son love the fact it freezes well and they can eat it when I travel for business.

I used cream of mushroom because I felt the flavor added a new special note to it. Very tasty.
I also used 2 cans of green chilies. I felt that made it more flavorful and brought out the tangy flavor more.
I also put half the cheese into the chicken/ sauce mixture before filling the tortillas. I personally prefer corn tortillas thus I used those instead of flour. 
This was a very tasty and easy recipe to make. Thankyou.

If you want to add extra flavor  I recommend adding:
-Seasoning to the chicken my favorite way to cook it is:
  +Coat breasts in sprinkling of Garlic Powder and McCormick Chipotle & roasted garlic spice
  +Melt 2 Tbsp of butter in a skillet, add 1 to 2 Tbsp of Vegetable oil
    ++Brown chicken breasts (6 minutes per side on med-hi)
    ++Pour 4 oz of beer over the browned breasts, squeeze in one fresh lime.  Let simmer in this mixture 3 minutes per side
-1/4 cup of cream cheese to the onion/chili powder/margarine mixture
-A sprinkling of cheese on the inside of the tortilla with the mixture

My husband and I LOVE this recipe! I made a few small tweaks - I added some fajita seasoning to the chicken while cooking it and I shredded the chicken instead of dicing it. Also, I used two cans of green chilis instead of one since we love green chilis. For a slightly healthier option, I used 4oz of plain greek yogurt and 4oz of sour cream for the soup mixture. We couldn't tell the difference.

Took some advice of others. Used cumin in it. Next time I will add some milk to the soup mixture to thin it out some. Otherwise it was a hit!

These are my wife's go to enchiladas when I'm working late. Always a hit. When I make them I use a can of Campbell's nacho cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken for a little more kick and cheesyness!

I make this all the time.... I add sautéed bell pepper (sometimes tomato and mushroom too) to the chicken mixture and instead of rolling up individual enchiladas. I cut the tortillas in quarters and line the bottom on the baking dish... Then add chicken mixture... Then another layer of tortillas. Then the sour cream mixture and cheese. I prep everything on the weekend and assemble everything in less than 10 on a weekday.

I did love this recipe but it really goes better with shredded chicken. We still tore it up, which is why I will rate it this high but shredded chicken makes it easier to roll, more likely to keep moist and holds flavor better. Unless you choose to buy cooked chicken already flavored and heavily sauced, the chicken would do better but the soup/sauce combo saves it.

Loved this recipe with my own version of tweaks: sautéed 2 chicken breasts in olive oil and removed from fry pan when no longer pink in center.  Added to chicken/olive oil essence in pan about 1/2 C chopped onion and 1/4 C chopped green pepper and sautéed to soften. Meanwhile, I diced cooked chicken and set aside in bowl. In separate bowl, I mixed together 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1/2 C sour cream. Spray 9X13 casserole dish with Pam. Spread two spoonfuls of soup mixture to bottom of pan. To softened onion and peppers in fry pan, add about 1/2 pkg of McCormick's Fajita Seasoning (I only had half pkg on hand) and about 1Tbsp Taco seasoning. Stir ingredients. Add remaining soup/sour cream mixture to fry pan over low heat and stir to evenly distribute through out onion/peppers and spices. Add chopped chicken and stir to evenly coat. Turn off heat to fry pan. Add 2 lg spoonfuls of creamy chicken mixture to flour tortillas, sprinkle with shredded queso cheese then roll. Place seam side down in casserole dish. Pour 1 jar taco sauce over top of all enchiladas in baking dish, finish by sprinkling more shredded queso cheese on top of taco sauce. Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Made 5 enchiladas. My 'picky eater' 15 yr old son loved this!

It was ok. The flour tortillas make it too doughy. If I make it again, I'll make some alterations such as using corn tortillas.

Loved loved loved this. Both my picky eaters went nuts. I doubled the sour cream and soup mix and added taco seasoning and green chiles as I went. Topped with sour cream and salsa is just perfection

I substituted nacho cheese sauce with jalapeños for the cream of chicken and used diced tomatoes with green chilies. My husband and I loved the recipe! Definitely something I will make again.

So delicious!!  I shredded the chicken, used white sharp cheddar and added a little inside the enchiladas, and added a block of cream cheese to the soup mixture (after I had doubled the recipe).

Love this recipe! So much flavor! I've tried 5 or 6 enchilada recipes over the years and I've by far gotten the most compliments on this one! Also yummy to throw in a can of corn or back beans!

Nice and easy and tastes even better the second night. I layer it in a 9x13 like a Mexican Lasagna & I sometimes add a black beans layer. 
Works great.

My family really loved it! I skipped the canned chilis, but instead added: 1/8 cup chopped jalapenos from a jar, and 1/2 can of black beans to the chicken mixture. Also added 1 can Rotel tomatoes with chilis & pepper to the soup mixture.

When I made this recipe the first time I made it exactly by the book. I thought it had a good flavor except that it was wasn't spicy enough for me. Also next time I will make more of the cream of chicken soup and sour cream mix for the entire because its a really good mixture when blended with the chicken and then baked. Also, baking the cheese defeats the purpose of putting cheese on the dish in the first place. I would bake it, then once its out of the oven sprinkle the cheese of the top of it so that it can melt and be tasteful, instead of being hard and with no taste.

This recipe is excellent as printed, and my rating is based on that. The only change I made was to add a clove or two of garlic, diced, with the onion, sauteeing both. My family and guests loved it, and there were no leftovers to enjoy the next day..

The second time I made it, I used corn tortillas, as that was what I had on hand.  The corn seemed to add another dimension to the dish, and were really good.

The third time I made it (we're just finishing it now! ) I changed it up a bit.  I sautéed the onion and garlic, added the chili powder and let it cook a couple of minutes, then added raw chicken cut into chunks.  Once the chicken was thoroughly cooked, I added all the sauce ingredients, increasing the sour cream to a cup.  I let it simmer for awhile, then filled corn tortillas with the mix.

Then I poured mole sauce over the top, sprinkled it with Mexican style shredded cheese, and put it in the oven for about 20 minutes until the cheese melted and the sauce was hot.  This definitely is a keeper!  There are several good mole recipes here...I don't like the jarred stuff.

Since I don't use processed foods I thicken the equivalent amount of chicken broth and milk with corn starch then season with celery,  thyme, pepper,  garlic and salt to taste.

I loved the recipie. I added cumin with the chili powder. I also put half a can of rotel with the chicken and the other half with the soup mixture. I used fiesta nacho cheese soup instead of cream of chicken. I'm glad I did because it added a lot of flavor.

This was so easy and tasty, and my whole family loved it - even my 2-yr-old, who rarely eats chicken! It's a great base recipe, and I tweaked it a bit: I baked the chicken in the oven with Taco seasoning before shredding it and adding in some of the sauce; to the soup mixture, I added about 1/2-3/4 cup of Enchilada sauce (10 Minute Enchilada Sauce from this site); and I added some chopped tomatoes and green onion before baking...It was really tasty and not too spicy. The only thing is that my tortillas still stuck to the pan even after pouring some of the sauce to the bottom :/ Other than that this recipe is a keeper :)

Great recipe... I love sauce so I doubled it with a can of enchilada sauce.  In stead of sour cream I used a mix of sour cream and French onion dip.  It was delicious!

We normally eat enchiladas with red sauce so I wasn't sure how this would taste with cream of chicken soup. I made it very close to the recipe, except I used taco seasoning on the shredded chicken, and added 3/4 of a can of diced tomatoes w/green chillies. It was very good, my family loved them. I thought they were very good, but boy are they "heavy". Definitely more of a comfort food that is very high in fat.

Came out excellent! It takes a little bit of time but worth it. I took others advice and added extra soup mixture and a little bit of salsa to the chicken mixture. Yummy!

We thought these were a little bland, but they were still good.  It is definitely a recipe that you can adjust to your taste.  If I make these again, I will probably use some cumin and other spices in the filling mixture.

I really don't like to leave bad reviews, but this was one of the most disappointing recipes I've tried on this site.  To be fair, I should have been able to predict the outcome by reading the ingredients.  The canned soup gives it such an artificial taste, that is so unnecessary.  These tasted like something you would buy in the frozen food section.  The taste was actually not terrible, as in they were edible, but they don't taste anything like how an enchilada should.   A good enchilada sauce is a key to good enchiladas, and canned soup is definitely not a substitute.  I guess maybe this could be a recipe to throw together with what you have on hand though.

Great recipe and easy to make. I made a couple changes. I stewed 3 boneless chicken breasts in a frying pan by adding 1/4 cup water and 1/2 package of taco seasoning and cooked on low heat letting the flavour soak in. Cut up the chicken in the pan when it was almost cooked and let it simmer longer. Add water if the pan is dry. I also substituted whole wheat flour tortillas and used a tex mex shredded cheese mixture. Before putting in oven, I added a can of enchilada sauce, which gave more flavour and colour. Baked for 20 minutes then added cheese and baked another 10. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley. Served with a salad and warm cornbread. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I tried this for cinco de mayo and we loved it! I omitted the chilis because my daughter was having stomach pains. I generally don't like things too hot but I really wish I'd used the chilis. This was anything but too spicy and was also very filling. Patsu

This has become my go-to enchilada recipe. The addition of the soup is genius! I like to cook the chicken on low in the crock pot while I'm at work then just shred with a fork before adding to the pan. I also top with enchilada sauce before baking. Thanks for the recipe!

My picky young children ate this and asked for seconds!I followed the recipe as written and served Mexican Rice III on the side. This is by no means gourmet, but from entering the kitchen to sitting down to bless the food only took 45 minutes. That counts for a lot when you have starving, whiny children scavenging for snacks.

I have some cans of cream soups that need used up, so I've been looking for recipes using them. I don't usually use cream soups in my enchiladas, but this one sounded really good. I did do some tweaking to suit our tastes. I boiled some chicken breasts the day before with chopped onions and garlic, salt, pepper, and cumin. I removed the meat and let the broth simmer down some to use with recipe. Next day, I shredded the meat and heated up corn tortillas while my sauce heated on the stove. I left out the sour cream (hubby doesn't care for it) and added a can of cheddar cheese soup. Added a small can of green enchilada sauce (I love that stuff!) and a soup can full of my chicken broth, 2 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, and the green chile peppers. I poured part of the sauce into my shredded chicken, then covered the bottom of my baking pan with the sauce. I dipped my tortillas in the sauce before spooning in the chicken mixture, rolled them up and poured more sauce over the top. Can you tell we like lots of sauce with our enchiladas? lol Topped with shredded cheese, chopped onions, and sliced black olives and baked. Served them with chopped tomatoes on top and Mexican rice on the side. Yum yum - and I have enough leftover for todays' lunch!

This was so easy to make. I doubled the soup/sour cream mixture. I think it would be too dry if I didn't do this. I used Old El Paso taco seasoning. We like things really spicy. It was a big hit.

I've made this twice now, and LOVE it! I left out the chiles because my kids hate anything near spicy, and I used homemade cream of chicken soup and doubled the sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe. Next time I'll keep some sauce separate and warm it up because everything gets absorbed--it's absolutely delicious but we love having sauce with our food! Thanks for a great recipe--now I can have what I love about enchiladas without the kids complaining about the sauce!

I made this for dinner tonight. While I loved it, the rest of the family had mixed reviews. My eldest and youngest each only took one bite. My daughter and husband ate it, but disliked the onions. I have a very picky bunch and finding something we all like is next to impossible. 

The recipe was easy to follow, but it takes a bit longer to cook when starting with raw chicken. I would eat it again, but probably will never make again for my family. Maybe as a pot luck type thing.

This recipe is pretty decent, however I made some changes that kicked it up a notch.  As well as the can of cream of chicken, I added half a can of cream of mushroom.  I added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 cup of frozen corn. I doubled the cheese. I added half of the cheese and soup mixture to the chicken filling.  And saved the other half for on top of the enchiladas. Turned out much tastier! Enjoy!

Definitely making this again. Made it a bit different: Used olive oil instead of butter, cooked onions and chicken together (just because I was lazy,) used a can of enchilada sauce (since I hate peppers) in soup mixture and it smelled amazing. Put a little cheese in each tortilla and a dab of the soup mixture since I read about some blandness. Everything else was normal and it tasted great. Only part I was disappointed about was that they were terrible leftovers, so we will have to remember to eat them right away.

This was really good, I made some changes.  I didn't have the green chiles and I used more than a cup of cheese.  We love the cheesy baked dishes so we covered the top with cheese.  I will definitely make this again but I will increase the amounts that make up the filling.  There wasn't a lot of chicken in each but some pieces were still a little dry.  The bites that had the sour cream/soup mixture were really good.

Really tasty and easy to make.  First time they seemed a bit dry so I doubled the sauce which then seemed too overwhelming so 1.5x is perfect.

We love this recipe!  We just add a little bit of montreal chicken seasoning to the chicken while it's cooking and double up on the amount of chicken as we are feeding a family of 7.  I pour the cream of chicken OR cream of mushroom soup into the pan when chicken it cooked and mix all together.  I spoon it into the tortillas and pour a jar of Enchilada Sauce over top, sprinkle with cheese and bake.  YUM!

I made this recipe followed the instructions, used extra large tortillas and it made four.  My husband complimented me on this dish several times. For the cheese portion I mixed Mexican Four Cheese and the Cheddar.  Worked great, highly recommend this even for company.

Really liked this recipe. It was easy and fast and very tasty.  I added a can of enchilada sauce(will add 2 next time) to the soup, and added some cumin like others suggested.  I also put in pico de gallo while making the chicken mixture to add some more spice. And I shredded the chicken as other suggested.

Made this recipe last night and my Mexican food- hating boyfriend loved it!  What's nice about this dish is that you can alter it to it your tastes/what you need to get rid of...

That being said, I added green peepers, minced garlic, salsa and some extra spices (chili powder, cumin, salt) to the onion pan. 

The cream of chicken/sour cream mix was good, but I think next time I will try it with the Campbell's "nacho" cheese I saw at my grocer.  I forgot to put the mix inside the enchilada, but that didn't seem to make a big difference...

All in all this was pretty good (but not mindblowing) and will be made again!

When I made these last night I was expecting to have leftovers for lunch today. My family and our friend devoured them in one sitting. Everybody loved them! I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used buttermilk, and the only cheese I had was pepper jack. Otherwise I followed the recipe. They were delicious; I will be making them again.

This is fairly straightforward to make, and my family enjoyed it, but I think the taste suffered from the use of condensed chicken soup.

I tracked this recipe down after a friend made it for me years ago, it was exactly the same and delicous! I added fresh mushrooms sliced to my onion mixture and served with salsa and guacomole. Very yummy!

I changed the sour cream to non-fat greek yogurt for added protein and it was so creamy and delicious!  I also did not drain the chiles thinking it may need more liquid and used white corn tortillas instead.  Not huge variances from original recipe.  My family enjoyed this dinner very much!  Thanks!

After reading the other reviews I made some minor changes. Prior to cooking the chicken I liberally applied salt, pepper and cumin, and browned the chicken in a little butter.  Drained it well and then chopped it up in the food processor.  I added 1/2  can of rotel to the soup/sour cream mixture The other half I added to the meat mixture. I also used a teaspoon of cumin in the meat mixture along with the chili powder. This was very tasty and surprisingly easy. 
Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe is awesome, however I kept it the same and added a couple of things to make it extra flavorful & cheesy! I use a 10-pack of corn tortillas; wheat tastes just as good as white!! For that reason I use double on the chicken soup and sour cream. I also grilled & pre-seasoned my chicken, I have done both indoor and outdoor grilled...seasoned with lots of cumin and a teeny Cajun spice since I'm in Louisiana!! The grilled flavor makes it so deliciously smoky and authentic tasting. I season the soup mixture with salt, pepper, oregano, cumin again and chili powder. I also added a can of chopped spinach, shredded cheese and Rotel tomatoes with green chilies, stuffed the tortillas with the chicken mix and a dollop of sour cream in each before rolling. I place them on top of canned black beans topped with shredded Mexican cheese in the bottom of the casserole dish. Then I poured red enchilada sauce over all of it, the leftover chicken mixture, and tons more cheese!!!! I baked at 400 to get the top a little crispy. I drizzled diced green onion tops across once it came out of the oven. I think the spinach and grilled chicken were the missing elements!! A little cilantro and diced black olives would be the finishing touch, but hubby dislikes cilantro and I dislike olives :)

This has become a staple dinner at our house.  We have my sister over and a few friends as this recipe (combined with some mexican rice, corn, or a salad) feeds a crowd.  I followed a few recommendations of others and altered a few things on my own.  1. I use 2 cans of soup--usually whatever I have on hand (Healthy Request cream of mushroom or cream of chicken, or nacho cheese soup).  2. I use low carb, high fiber, whole wheat tortillas--just a personal preference.  3. I put a dollop of the soup mixture on the tortillas with the chicken before rolling them up, it keeps the chicken moist. 4. I make a double batch whenever I make these (they do take some time) and freeze 1 batch so I have it on hand for a quick meal.

I followed the receipe exactly and it turned out really good! The only ingredient I would change is the flour tortilla. The brand I purchased, Guerro, was has a sweet taste to it that ruined the whole entree for me. I would either use a different brand of torrillas or just use corn tortillas. Other than that this is an easy recipe that I will use for years to come! Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic - everything everyone says it is!  I added a little red enchilada sauce over the top - under the cheese.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

I am one to give credit where credit is due, and I absolutely love this recipe!  I've made it three times and everyone raves about it.  I did add a few things to the recipe, just because I had it on hand and thought it would incorporate well.  I added half a can of red enchilada sauce to the cream of chicken and sour cream mixture, pouring the remaining half of the can directly onto the enchiladas prior to baking (on top of the mixture and under the cheese).  I also sauteed chopped mushrooms with the onions simply because I love them in everything!  I also added cumin and dried cilantro leaves to the mixture.  And lastly, I added a 1/2 can of crushed tomatoes to the mixture. Yummy! Thank you Jeri for submitting this recipe!

This was delicious! It made it for a date night with my boyfriend, and He said it was better than both his mom's and his grandma's recipes for enchiladas! I used shredded chicken instead of chopped, and I added some store bought green chile to top it, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. Everyone who has tried it is begging me to make it for them again!

OK, if you want a FAST and DELICIOUS meal...this is the one.  Here's a tip, I buy the rotisserie chicken (already cooked).  One night, the kids will eat the legs off the chicken and some breast.  The next night, I chop up the leftover chicken breast and make this outstanding recipe.  Thank you for this recipe!

These are really good when you use corn tortillas and mix in some red enchilada sauce with the soup mix and also pour over the top.  Whole family loved them.

It was excellent.  I baked the chicken with a bit of salad dressing to keep moist.  With two forks, I then shredded the chicken.  This is not the typical recipe for enchiladas.  We were pleasantly surprised and will make again.

I chose this recipe mainly because I had all the ingredients. I usually try to avoid recipes with "cream of anything" soups, but you just can't seem to avoid them sometimes. Now I will have to make sure I keep cream of chicken soup on hand just to make this recipe. I used whole wheat tortillas, and added a little cheese inside the enchiladas, but otherwise followed the recipe. This is a keeper and will be made again and again! Thanks, Jeri!

I didn't like these at all. I was looking for a recipe similar to one that my mom made when we were growing up and this is not it. The ingredients seemed close to her recipe, but the chili powder threw the entire thing off. I will not make these again. My search will continue.

This was an exceptional recipe! I loved that it was sooo easy.  I prepared the filling earlier in the day and assembled later.  Served it with yellow rice and was a very satisfying meal.  The only thing I changed was added 1/4 cup milk to soup mixture to thin. This recipe is a keeper!

I took some of the others advice and used cheddar cheese soup in place of the cream of chicken soup.  I also omited the chili powder because my bf doesn't tolerate extremely spicy foods.  This dish was scrumptious and I plan on making it again.  Thanks for sharing.

Not at all your typical enchalada becuase of no red sauce. BUT a wonderful change. Light and creamy. I call these my "california enchaldas!" Great to throw together for a small gathering, or to make and freeze for later!

These were very easy and very good!  I did add 1/2 teaspoon of garlic to the skillet when the onions were almost done.  I also used monteray Jack chees on the top of the enchiladas with just a small amount of cheddar.  I will definately make this again and again!

I cooked up the chicken with season salt and lemon juice, added green enchilada sauce to the sour cream and soup mix, and used pepper jack cheese.  Turned out great!

Yum. I made mine with rotisserie chicken purchased at the local grocers, shredded and mixed up with a couple of tablespoons of the soup mixture. I have also tried this with chicken thighs I threw in the slow cooker with a bit of broth and taco seasonings. Both seemed to work fine but the rotisserie chicken was less time consuming. Also, I stirred in a couple of small cans of green chilies and a couple cans of green enchilada sauce stirred into the soup mixture and it adds such amazing flavor. I was really wary of making enchiladas with cream of chicken soup but it turned out awesome!

This is the BEST recipe, I have been making this for YEARS!  My children all loved this and my youngest one will still request it, I have to make TWO pans and one is for him by himself!  I love how you have the exact measurements for everything, I have been making it so long, I can't tell you how much chili powder I use (but I have a heavy hand)  I have to use a whole bag of chicken tenders, so I have to double the ingredients: to like 1 stick of butter, 1 large cream of chicken, 1 large sour cream, anyway I use the same ingredients as you Jeri!   Wonderful receipe, this will be a hit for you for sure!

This was so good! I doubled the sauce and because we were having a chicken dinner the following day, I used ground beef. It was really good this way. WE all loved it and I will make this again. I served this wilth my mexican rice and warm nacho chips with salsa.

I read the other reviews and suggestions.  This is a great base recipe.  To add some more spice & flavor I added enchilada sauce, cilantro and oregano.  Sliced black olives, red & green pepper and jalepano slices.  A few drops of hot sauce in each one.  Cheated and bought Chi Chi's shredded chiken at the Acme.  Already seasoned in taco sauce.  Just threw everything together, did not cook stovetop first, and baked for 40 minutes.  My boyfriend gobbled this up, really, really good!

Like some of the other reviews, I thought this recipe was a bit bland... I added rotel, salt and pepper, chipotle :) pepper, and the listed ingredient to the chicken (which I did shred)... It was ok... but definitely needed something else. Thought the sauce was also bland.... just needs some more ingredients!

My husband usually stays far away from chicken because it's "healthy and dry" (his words, not mine)....but...not only did  he devour these, but I got a "those are the BOMB, baby!" from him!  very impressive!!!!!!  The only things I did differently, was add some rotel to the chicken mix because my tortillas were huge and I needed more mixture to fill them!  And I also topped with fresh shredded Monterey Jack and Sharp Cheddar cheese for oooey gooeyness!  Will make again and often!  yum and thanks!

My husband liked them, now that may not sounds so great, but he doesn't like chicken, and so no matter what Ive done with it his usual reply when I ask is, "It's chicken", so for him to say he liked them and to keep the recipe is a GOOD thing.

this is similar to my recipe i learned from my mother.  i use taco seasoning instead of chili or if short i use 1/2 and 1/2 of each.   toss in a can of diced black olives and mix in some shredded pepper jack with your cheese mix.  they come out so gooey and good.  these are goobled up fast.  want to give it a kick, toss in 2 deseeded jalepenos or habenaros.

Very disappointed in this after reading all the rave reviews.  It was very dry and bland.  The chicken itself needs spiced, and there needs to be way more sauce. Though this sauce wasn't the best tasting (bland, salty), so I don't agree with the reviews that just say to double it. Oh well, won't be making again.

My family (Even my picky daughter!)  really loved this. I used a can of Tyson all white meat chicken and it worked great and really cut down on the prep time.   Super easy and really yummy! We'll be adding this to our favorites.

I had to get rid of some left over grilled chicken so I chose this recipe.  I had very little time so I didn't read the reviews or make any dramatic changes, other than I added 2 tsp. cumin and used monterey jack cheese because that's what I had on hand. Also, to reduce on my dishes and kitchen clean up I heated the butter, onion, etc. in a bowl in the microwave. My kids loved it and it was so simple!  I will use this again and again.

This dish was great!  My husband and I both loved it.  Next time I think I'll add some more chicken as mine were a little thin.  Probably my fault since I didn't measure the chicken.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious.  Even the leftovers were eaten within 12 hours of being made.  I will most definitely make this again.  I used precooked chicken and steak strips found in the lunch meat section.  Quick, easy and simply awesome.

Very good. I added chopped olives.  I used corn tortillas and aslo added a can of green enchilada sauce.  I will be making these this weekend for a family get together.  I am going to try using the pepper jack soup that Campbells has with the green enchilada sauce.  Going to buy enough to make it the original way just in case I don't care for it.  I also put chopped green onions and cilantro on top with the grated cheese and olives.  Even my husband, who in the past has not liked chicken enchiladas, enjoyed these.  He said they had a very good flavor.  Easy to change up to suit your tastes.

i LOVED them, but my boyfriend has this thing about using camp bells soups. he says that's all he tasted when i told him what was in it. (before i mentioned it, he didnt have any complaints.) keep that part a secret for the nit picky people in your life. i sprinkled some green peppers on top, made the dish come together.

A different twist to traditional enchiladas, but very good and easy to make.

This is one of my favourite recipes.  I do make a few changes however.  I sometimes add extra sour cream (low fat).  I also add one and a half jalapeno peppers (instead of the green chile peppers) and sautee that with the onions.  I cook up a package of Mexican rice and add that when I stuff the tortillas (we usually end up with about 10 small tortillas).  And my last change is that I add a can of dice tomatoes on top before sprinkling on  the cheese. So good!

I loved this recipe. I made it for my in-laws and even my father-in-law who won't even try anything slightly mexican loved it. The only change I made was to add a can of rotel to the mix rather than the green chilis to reduce the spicyness without sacrificing flavor. It turned out perfect. Thanks for giving me a great crowd pleaser!

Excellent!  Instead of rolling up the tortillas, I just layered them in a round casserole dish.  I added a little salsa to the mix as well.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe!  Next time I'm going to cut back on the onions - the kids just didn't like that part.   I also added a small amt of shredded cheese to each enchilada before rolling it up.  We just love to have layers of cheese!

This is a delicious, I did use other reviewers suggestions and added 1 can Rotel tomatoes to the chicken mixture, also to the soup mixture I added one can green chili enchilada sauce, a little cheese before rolling, yum yum!  You can make this recipe just as described and will do well also:-)

I have made chix enchiladas before with way more ingrediants and took longer and this recipe was WAY better. This was the best recipe for chix ench. i have ever used and it was sooo easy. ONly thing I did different was I did not use an onion, only because I didn't have one and instead of using cheddar cheese I used mexican mix because it was what i had. AMAZING!!! Loved it!

We really enjoyed this dish.  I used Campbell's Nacho Cheese soup instead of cream of chicken based on another review, and I put a can of Rotel on top during the last five minutes of baking.  I'll be making these again!

I would have given this 5 stars, but since I took the advice from another review and added green enchilada sauce, it only deserved 4.  Adding the green sauce is essential in this recipe--it was so delicious! Taste just like authentic chicken enchiladas with verde sauce that you get in a mexican restaurant.  I doubled the recipe so that I could fill an entire 9x13 pan.  Any extra sauce not used to cover the enchiladas can be refridgerated and used to reheat your leftovers.  My family loved it and asked for the recipe. I will use this recipe again and again.

This was a really great recipe to use as a base.  I read other comments and noticed some saying double up on the sauce and seasoning.  I used twice the peppers, twice the soup, twice the chili pepper and twice the cheese.  I also made a Red Enchilada Sauce to put underneath the cheese on top and also put some cheese in each enchilada.  To die for!!

I made these for company and they turned out really good.  I ended up with only 6 enchiladas instead of 8 (personal preference for more filling instead of more tortilla) and the entire pan was demolished!  I made it a lite by using 98% fat free cream of chicken and fat free sour cream and no one could tell the difference.  This recipe is a definite keeper and very versatile - I look forward to trying it with spinach and shrimp!

We love these enchiladas! I am a big fan of chili powder, so I've always doubled it. I also add a can of red enchilada sauce to the top before adding shredded Colby-Jack cheese. Yummy!

I really liked this recipe.   I felt like it could use more than 1 cup of cheese since my family lives close to Wisconsin and loves their cheese, I had to add more cheese!!  It is very easy as long as you already have some cooked chicken.  I like to use the chicken leftover from making homemade chicken soup.  I might try next time to add a red enchilada sauce on the tortillas under the cheese to give it a totally different flavor with the same basic recipe.

I enjoyed the simplicity of the recipe.  I am not a very skilled cook and it was nice to have a good warm dinner turn out very tasty.  This is definitely something the whole family can enjoy.  I think overall I enjoy a more traditional Enchilada style with a red sauce, but it looks like when chicken is used this is often the path taken.

Too dry!  Next time I will double the sauce.  Make sure you season the chicken and don't make the mistake I did by spraying the bottom of the pan with cooking spray, the sauce wouldn't spread out and just slid around the pan in clumps.  I would season the sauce too, it was too bland.  I will put the diced chiles in the sauce next time and cheese inside of the enchiladas as well as the top.

Really Great!  I added a small can of green verde salsa to the chicken.  Cooked the chicken in a slow cooker with the chic. soup and the sour cream and added some chopped canned jalepenos.  It was great!  Oh and added sliced olives to the top.

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  It had great flavor and didnt have an overpowering "cream soup" taste like a lot of recipes.  I sauted my chicken in taco seasoning and i didnt have any chilis in the pantry so i skipped them and but i did add some green onion.  Thanks for the great recipe I will make again!!

Yummy!  I read a lot of reviews before I made this dish and I took bits and pieces of advice from several different folks.  First, I took help from the store and shredded a rotisserie chicken.  I doubled the sauce but instead of using an extra can of cream of chicken, I used Campbell's Fiesta Nacho Cheese.  Then, instead of the teaspoon of chili powder to the sauted onions, I added a teaspoon of taco seasoning.  Then, instead of the can of green chiles, I added half a can of Rotel to the chicken mixture and then added the other half to the soup mixture. My husband loved it!

My whole family loved this recipe.  I cooked the chicken w/ the chilis and chilli powder in crock pot on low for 5 hours, so all I had to do was assemble them when I got home.  I also used a little enchilada sauce because that is what we are used to.  SO GOOD!

We love this recipe! I did change it up a bit, I used the 25% less sodium cream of chicken, I used a lighter sour cream and I used a rotisserie chicken for ease!  We are having it again tonight!

I love this recipe!!  Following the advice of other reviewers, I did make a few changes. 1)  I did not put in the green chiles.  Instead I split a can of Rotel - half with the soup mixture and half with the chicken mixture.  2)  I doubled the cheese and put 1/2 of it in with the chicken mixture before I rolled up the tortillas.

I'm not a huge fan of this. However, I still gave it a 4 star rating because it of its flavor. I would probably call it "creamy chicken tortilla casserole." I much prefer the more traditional chili sauce enchiladas.

This was soooo good!!!  Next time I will double the sauce mixture adding 2 cans of soup and 1 cup sour cream.  The only alterations I made were, added green pepper to onion to sautee along with half a pack of taco seasoning.  Added the chicken (already cooked) and added about 1/2 cup salsa.   Let this all cook together and then added the sauce to it.  I also took someone's advice and added cheese to the inside of it.  Very good, even kids enjoyed this dish.  Served it with some spanish rice and it was a very filling meal.

This is a great recipe and I've made it many times with varations.  The can of chopped chilis is drained and the liquid is added to the sour cream and soup mixture. Montery jack cheese was used instead of cheddar and the whole dish was topped with 12-16 oz. picante sauce.

This recipe is wonderful!  I added cumin has one other cook suggested.  Also, to make it a little lighter (got to fit into that swimsuit ya' know!) I used 99% fat free soup, light sour cream and 2% cheese.  Yummy!  It's a keeper for sure.    Thank you!

I made these last night and they were great.  I did not have a can of green chilles, but I did have pickled jalapeno pepeppers and substituted them.  I'm looking forward to sharing this with friends.  Best chicken enchiladas I've ever had.

Tasty and delicious, Made the first time exactly as the recipe stated. Second time I substituted the original cream soup for Campbell's Cheddar Soup. Lovely both ways. A surprisingly tasty and easy to throw together meal. Sure to satisfy any 'cheese tooth' lol

What an easy, delicious recipe!  I substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes for the green chile peppers and used a Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar cheese because that's what I had on hand.  Using shredded chicken that I'd prepared the night before, I was able to assemble this dish in about five minutes and have in on the table 30 minutes later.  We had it with refried beans and a green salad, making it a quick, tasty family meal.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious.  It's the only recipe I've used.  But instead of using chicken breast, I've bought the whole roasted chicken that the grocery stores sell and tear it up.  It gives it so much flavor.

The taste was more casserole than enchilada. While it was flavorful, the taste did not resemble authentic Mexican food. I would not make it again.

I made this with fake soy-based chicken and it was a great vegetarian dish.  Per others' suggestions, I took a half can of enchilada sauce, a can of diced green peppers, half a container of light sour cream, and a little cayenne pepper and cumin in another bowl, then stirred half of it into the fake chicken. This went into 8 corn tortillas.

I just made this recipe tonight for dinner and it was a hit. But but my personal preference the next time I make it would be to use corn tortillas and add some extra heat to the filling, but all in all, this was a great recipe.

These were very good recipe the only thing I changed was seasoning the chicken breasts with chilli powder for a little extra spice. Next time a may put some chili powder in the soup mixture as well.

Wow- if I could give it 6 stars, I would! This recipe is wonderful- the only thing my husband begged for while he was home on leave from Iraq. Even my sometimes picky 5 and 7 year olds cheer when they know it is for dinner. Thanks for making it so easy to be the "best mom cook"- lol!

This has become a favorite at my house.  One time, after I had started making it, I realized I didn't have any cream of chicken so I used cream of celery in it's place.  My family liked it better that way and I've been doing it that way since. Very tasty!

The enchiladas I made turned out very good, though I did modify the recipe quite a bit, based on other reviews and personal preference. I boiled three boneless, skinless chicken breasts in chicken broth for 40 minutes, then shredded them with a fork in a large bowl.  I mixed together one can of Campbell's fiesta nacho cheese soup, a half can of enchilada sauce, a can of diced green peppers, half a small container of light sour cream, and a little cayenne pepper in another bowl, then stirred half of it into the shredded chicken. I then put the chicken mixture into four wheat tortillas, added some fresh baby spinach leaves on top of the chicken, and folded them over. The rest of the soup mix and filled tortillas went into a greased baking dish, and I baked them for 15-20 at 325. Husband and I both loved it, though we wouldn't mind it spicier.  I might try mild hot sauce or more pepper next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe but I made it as a casserole instead of rolling them. I cut the chicken up in small pieces and cooked in olive oil with coriander and cumin. Then when cooked tru I put it in the food prosessor to shred. Mix with cream of chicken soup, 1 cup sour cream, and T of chilie powder, Dip corn tortillas in enchilada sauce to make first layer on the bottom, spread the chicken mixture, top with cheese and start another layer of dipped tortillas, chicken ending with dipped tortillas on top, cover with cheese blend and bake for 25 minutes, every family member loved it even picky grandson.

These were okay. I followed another's advice and used Nacho cheese soup instead of cream of chicken soup. It didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting. I made extra and had it for lunch the next day and it was so much better. So next time I will make this a day ahead of time and let the flavors mix and meld. Over all, I was pretty satisfied.

This was my first time making enchiladas and it definitely was worth it!  I tried to make the recipe somewhat healthier. I am trying to limit my sodium, so i used low sodium cream of celery instead of cream of chicken and mixed that with fat free sour cream.  I didnt have chedder cheese, so i usedd low fat mozzerella on top instead.  I also added some red enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan as well as a little bit on top of the enchiladas before putting it in the oven. I added olives and tomatoes on top once the enchiladas were cooked. Great recipe, i will definitely be making these again!

I fixed this recipe for my family the other evening for the first time and received raves!  Quick note:  I tried the cumin suggestion and added cream cheese to the cream of chicken mixture.  This is definitely one good easy recipe to make when you don't have a lot of time and want to impress! By the way, it's good cold the next day too!

Very good!  I doubled the sauce and added taco seasoning instead of the spices it called for and I also used some Rotel tomatoes with the green chiles instead of just green chiles alone.  I also added some cheese inside the enchiladas as well as on top.  Will make again!

These were ok for me, but nothing special.  I did make them with corn tortillas instead of flour, but that was the only change I made.  They need something to take the cream of soup taste out, because unfortunately, that was the dominant flavor.  Maybe more spices would have helped.

My hubby loved these! He doesn't normally like leftovers, but he polished these off without complaint. I didn't get any leftover enchiladas! :) They'll be a staple around here. Very tasty and relatively simple to prepare.

Super easy which is great.  Ingredients that I changed: cheese soup rather than cream of chicken, added taco seasoning and enchilada sauce to soup mix.  When preparing, I shredded chicken rather than cubing.  And in addition to putting soup mix on top, I poured on some more enchilada sauce.  Very good.

I almost doubled the meat in this recipe and then put a little cheese inside the enchilada. Made it for a party of 20 and everyone raved about the recipe. Family all liked it as well, it will stay on our regular rotation.

This was great! Took the advice of some of the previous reviewers and used Campbells Cheese Soup instead of Cream of Chicken soup. I made these for my boyfriend and he ate 4 enchiladas in one sitting, definitely one of his favorite recipes. Thanks for sharing!

Just tried this tonight, and it turned out WONDERFUL! I did add some jambalaya rice (since my family loves rice) and doubled the sauce mixture since we like it really saucy. Thank you! Now i have a new recipe to make during parties and potlucks! YUMMY YUMMY! Definitely a 5 Star!

I made these tonight for dinner. Husband and I thought they were pretty good! The only thing I would do differently next time is to use more soup/sour cream mixture and maybe add some enchilada sauce. They weren't dry, but could have used more sauce in my opinion...That is why I gave it a rating of four stars..

I made a few changes by adding left over Rice-A-Roni & green olives to the chicken mixture.  I also substituted cream cheese for the sour cream (didn't have).  It was fabulous!!!!!!!!!!  My family loved it!

I made this for a group of 15.  It was very easy to make a triple recipe! I agree this recipe needs a little more flavor.  I added a can of original Rotel to the chicken but next time I will try a can of the spicy Rotel instead.  I thinned out the "sauce" with chicken stock.  I also chopped up a jalapeno and some cilantro that some chose to put on top.  I did cook the chicken in a crockpot all morning while I was out of the house.  I had chicken stock and a can of spicy Rotel as the liquid.  This was very good by itself!

I really don't care for the sauce.  It's
a bit too salty and does not taste authentic enough for me.

These were amazing!  I shredded the chicken and added enchilada sauce and a bit of salsa to the soup mix. I substituted taco seasoning and added cumin to the chicken mix and added extra cheese in each enchilada. Sooo good and easy, I will definitely be making these often!

This recipe was recieved really well by my family =. I only gave it 4 stars because we have never had enchilada's before and have no idea what to compare them too.  I did cook my chicken in a crockpot with taco seasoning and peppercini's it was fabulous.

This is a great recipe to build on. I cooked my chicken in a crockpot with salsa all day and then shredded it. I added black beans to the filling also. Needed to make extra sauce so I used to cans of condensed soup and extra sour cream and then had left sauce for another time..
Mmm Mmm Good.

Delicious, but I also made a few changes. I cooked chicken breasts, which I'd sprinkled with cumin and chili powder, in a little olive oil. Covered to steam the chicken. I did eliminated step 3 altogether and didn't saute the onion etc. I simply added it raw, to the filling. I increased the sour cream, but next time may add a little milk when I pour the mixture over the top. I also put a little cheese inside each enchilada. The best change I made: Drain one can of Rotel tomatoes and add a couple of tbsp. to each enchilada. After putting the soup mixture on top, add any remaining onion and tomatoes. My family loved it!

This was very good and easy to make! I sauteed some garlic with the onion - in oil instead of butter, substituted taco seasoning for the chili powder and also added mushrooms. This will be a constantly used recipe at my place!

this recipe is awsome just by itself.i made the chicken enchiladas from the recipe and then the next time i made them i made a couple of changes.first off when making the sourcream chicken soup mixture i used 3/4 cup sourcream.when i sauteed the onion i put double the chili powder and instead of margarine i used a garlic basil butter i made from another recipe i found on this site that is really easy to make.i put a 7 oz can of chilis in instead of a 4 oz can and i made 2 1/2 cups chicken.making these changes to the mixture adds a an extra flavor and makes the enchiladas larger.the final change i made was i used extra sharp cheddar instead of medium cheddar.tillamook makes 2 different kinds of extra sharp,one thats aged 15 months and one thats aged 2 years.i used the one that was aged 2 years and it makes all the difference.

We LOVED this recipe! My sister-in-law and I both made it for our families and they all raved about it! The only change I made was, like others, I replaced the chili powder with taco seasoning. I'll definitely be making this again!

It was an easy recipe, and they tasted good, but didnt have the yummi-ness that I wanted in an enchilada. Way too bland. Next time, I am going to substitute enchilada sauce for the cream of chicken soup, add garlic, cumin and Rotel tomato jalapenos to the recipe to kick it up.

Another excellent enchilada recipe, very tasty and easy. The only slight changes I made were green peppers for the chiles and some mild salsa on top along with the cheese. Will make these frequently as I can enjoy a Mexican favorite without the drive to a restaurant (saving on gas). Highly recommend.

This was a very good recipe and everyone really enjoyed them! I know it is annoying when people change the recipe, but I had to because of what I had on hand. I used both boneless skinless thighs and breasts, which I dont think harmed the flavor at all. I also had a can of red enchilada sauce on hand and put it over the top just because. That was wonderful, as I think they might have been just a touch dry without it. The integrity of the recipe is wonderful and they are wonderful as leftovers!

This was a great recipe. I had made this for a group of friends. My GF comlimented me on again yesterday - and told me she wanted to come for dinner again. I had follewed the tip from another review  - about using taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  I also added a small amount of black beans to the top of the mixture when filling the tortilla.

The other tip - I would recommend - but did not follow - is if you are on a tight schedule - prep the chicken the night before. 

Thanks! -- Stacey

an easy, forgiving recipe. Had to do it from memory (haha) as I didn't have a chance to print it up.  Added milk to the soup & sour cream mixture as it seemed too thick. added green onion, a little cheddar, cumin, green chili (remembered that) and forgot the chili.  The family GOBBLED it up- even the "picky, never wants to try anything new" child, and the "never can finish what's on the plate" child.  Making it again tonite. I may stick with my modifications....

Excellent with modifications. Rubbed garlic powder and pepper on chicken breasts and then boiled for 10 min with a bay leaf. Shredded chicken. Sauted onions in small amt of butter and white wine and spice. Added cilantro and garlic (frozen "cibes" from Trader Joe's) then added shredded chicken and mixed together with small amt shredded cheese. Mixed soup and sourcream and placed some on bottom of pan and then place rolled enchiladas with rest of mixture and shredded cheese. Baked for 20 min till bubbly and absolutely divine!!

This is practically inhaled by my family!  I've made it several times and it is impossible to mess up,  I've even substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes for the green chilies, and it tasted great.

This was an awesome recipe. My only suggestion is double the sauce, and use low fat soup and sour cream. Otherwise it's super rich.. But they were awesome. Will eat again!

I love these enchiladas.  Much better than an older, blander version my husband and I used to make.

Not really a "Mexican" enchilada because of the use of the cream of mushroom, so to the soup, I added another 1/2 cup of the sour cream and also a whole can of enchilada sauce to make it more authentic.  I think if I only stuck to the original recipe this would not be called an enchilada but with these variations it was much tastier and more of an "enchilada".  Would make again, but not really a fan of the can of soup in an enchilada. Perhaps a can of the cheese would work better as another reviewer suggested, but definitely use enchilada sauce in it.

My husband and I are both trying to eat healthier these days, but this is this is one of our few "splurge" dishes that has remained in the lineup. As one reviewer already said, these are better than most restaurants' enchiladas. I do like to add taco seasoning to the white sauce for a little extra kick!

Great base recipe but too bland for my taste.  I used hot chili powder but next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and use taco seasoning and cheese soup not cream of chicken.  Will definitely make again and modify it to suit my preferences.

This was okay.  The addition of the cream soups perturbed me and I was disappointed in the flavors that they lent to the dish.  I have made this dish without the cream soups and instead covered the bottom of the baking dish and the tops of the enchiladas with red enchilada sauce.  The results were superb and a lot more in line with how I feel enchiladas ought to taste (and look).  It is key in this recipe to season, season, season! I was very liberal with the pepper and added "doses" of taco seasoning, chile powder, and season salt.  I also added an extra can of the green chiles and the end result was awesome: A perfectly seasoned, moist blend of chicken breast that was so yummy inside the enchiladas.  Without the extra spices and seasonings, the recipe is, in my opinion, lackluster.

Delicious!  I changed a few things.  1. I used corn tortillas (9).  2. I added 4 oz of green salsa verde to the sour cream/soup mixture. 3.  I shredded the chicken. I can't stop eating them. I wake up in the middle of the night, grab a fork and sit with the fridge door open sneaking in a few more bites.

This recipe was a hit with my family!  I followed some of the others' advice & added extra seasonings (Adobo, cumin, and pepper).  I also included some of the cheese into the chicken mixture.  I have a 3-year-old & a 1-year-old; they loved it, too!  My husband told me I could make it for him anytime!

These were very good. My only complaint would be the texture of the flour tortilla after baking. Flavor was good. I made this for my friend and I and she loved it. She even took the recipe and made it for her husband not long after. Thank!

this is the best enchilada I have ever tasted! I made this for a dinner party with a group of a few friends, and they would not quit eating! I made a double batch, but I wouldn't double the onion part again.. not a huge fan on onions, but it was still good. They freeze really well, so I froze leftovers, and my family found them in the freezer and devoured them, thinking they were something from a restaurant!

this recipe is a great place to start. i cubed and cooked the chicken with chili powder and fresh cilantro, as well as salt/pepper/garlic to taste. next time i'm not sure i would use a whole can of cream of chicken. i'd probably play with the proportions of sour cream and soup - 8oz (one small tub) of sour cream and about a half a can of a nacho cheese soup. i also used shredded Cheddar jack cheese instead of Cheddar. you should also note that these can be very filling. i served two a piece with a salad, and could only finish one enchilada.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe and I agree that the soup mixture should be doubled, as it was not quite enough.  I will probably make this again.

These were bland, and the sauce was very heavy.  Tastes very Americanized. I will go back to making Gerry's Enchiladas (also on this site).  Lots more work, but worth it.

after reading other reviews for helpful tips and adding a few of my own this recipe was delicious!!  from other's advice i added green chiles to the sour cream/soup mixture and put that mixture in with the chicken while wrapping in the tortillas.  i also added red enchilada sauce and salsa to the sour cream/soup mixture.  i cooked the chicken with taco seasoning instead of chili powder also.  adding some cheese to the chicken while wrapping in the tortillas gave them a little extra added flavor.  i also made the double the amount of the soup/sour cream mix and smothered the top completely with sauce and then shredded cheese before baking!

I like my enchiladas with more stuff, so I add a can of black beans to the chicken mixture.  I also add a second can of green chiles, more chili powder, and a tablespoon of cumin.  I also increase the amount of the soup mixture so I can stir more into the filling and spread more on top.  It usually ends up being 2 cans of cream of chicken and a whole 16oz container of sour cream.  My picky 3 year old actually eats when I make this!

So very good. I doubled the sauce as suggested using a can of cream of chicken and a can of fiesta cheese. I cooked my chicken in the microwave seasoned with a chili seasoning mix. Then I shredded it. These were gone quickly.

This was really good. The only thing I would change is it neads more sauce and I will have to use corn tortillas, instead of corn because the flour made it too chewy! but over all it was very good =. My husband really enjoyed it!

This recipe definitely exceeded my expectations. I used fresh chili peppers and put them on at the same time as the onions, and then I was out of chili powder so I used cajun seasoning instead. Also, I added some of the soup mixture in with the chicken mixture when putting them in the tortillas. But it turned out wonderfully, everyone who tried them really enjoyed them.

very yummy. i thought they might not turn out due to no red or green sauce, but the soip mixture was great. I took the advice of some others and doubled the sauce. also I used one can of cream of chicken and one of the fiesta nacho cheese. I also added a little of thick and chuncky salsa to it for some spice. I will definatly make this again, thanks for the recipe!!

This was as close to restaurant quality as it gets! I doubled the sour cream in the sauce mixture.I substituted green bell pepper for the green chiles (too spicy for this reflux bunch!)I cooked the chicken with olive oil, cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper and paprika. I also served this with chopped cilantro, green onion and tomatoes on the side.

UNBELIEVEABLE!!!  This is now a favorite dish in our house.  Can't say enough about it- even my 2 year old had seconds.  And my finicky husband loved it.  Can't ask for more than that!  Thanks

Surprisingly excellent! I expected it to taste a little processed and "Americanized" but it was pretty authentic for creamy enchiladas. Changed the flour for corn tortillas. Only made 4 instead of 8 (though had extra sauce). Rich and delicious.

This was VERY GOOD!  I made it and used the recipe for "ten minute enchilada sauce"  that is on this site -- it was so delicious!!!  My kids who thought that they didn't LIKE enchiladas ate every bite - and one even had seconds!

This dish is just so delicious and easy at the same time.  I used canned chicken (a real time-saver).  I used a can of fiesta cheese soup and a can of cream of chicken.  Also, I mixed in a can of Mexicorn with the soups and sour cream and I think the corn really makes the dish.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I will make this again and again.  Next time I will mix a can of Mexicorn with some Spanish rice and spoon this mixture at the bottom of the rolled enchiladas.  Yum!!!!!

my husband and i loved it. it's not a traditional enchilada, which is fine. i took the advice of a couple of others and added the chunky salsa, shredded the chicken, and used a little cheddar cheese soup. my husband requested that i pack up the left overs for lunch tomorrow. this is a keeper!!!!!

I used the Campbell's Nacho Soup as suggested by a previous post.  It was a good meal.  I liked the creamy texture.  I may add some jalepenos next time.

This was a very good recipe. I doubled the sauce and I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. One suggestion don't reheat in the microwave it ruins the taste! Other than that, awesome enchiladas! I will definately use this recipe again!

I followed the recipe given and the tips in reviewers' notes about doubling the sauce. This turned out great! I fed around 40 guests a mixed dinner of Mexican foods and this was by far the favorite.

i changed this one quite a bit but it was delish! i used 4 chicken breasts and made the "10 minute enchilada sauce" instead of the chicken soup. i also added one red bell pepper to the mixture of onion, chili peppers, and chicken. after the chicken was cooked through i took the pieces out and shredded them then added them back into the mixture for a bit. i added a couple ladles of the enchilada sauce to this mixture and then filled my tortilas. topped with more sauce and cheese then baked for almost 25 mins this recipe is amazing! :D

This was an excellent recipe and easy to follow. Very basic ingredients and easy to modify to your liking. Also very fast! I used 2 cans of diced chicken and also added can of enchilada sauce to the top, plus some salsa to the soup mixture. Definitely a keeper.

Just finished my leftovers from this recipe...yum!  Did alter a bit--I left out the green chili peppers (just didn't have them) and added a tablespoon of taco seasoning along with chili powder.  I also added another 1/4 cup of sr. cream, some tabasco, and about 1/4 -1/2 cup of salsa to the soup/sr.cream mix.  I think this really helped add something, though maybe you wouldn't need the flavor if peppers had been added.  It did make for more soup mixture, though, which was needed.  This did not make 8 servings at all- it made 4 servings (filled 5 large tortillas).  I would either buy small tortillas and stuff them more, or double the recipe to fill a 13 by 9" pan and more tortillas.  Otherwise, it tasted great, and I will definitely make it again.

These were awesome!  However, I am only giving the recipe four stars because I added a can of red enchilada sauce and I don't think the meal would have been complete without it.  I poached and shredded my chicken.  As other reviewers suggested, I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  I also added more of the cream of chicken soup/sour cream mixture to the filling.  I served seasoned black beans on the side.  Delicious!

It tasted good, a little blah. I would suggest adding some of your favorite things for flavor. I also had to cook it for longer because it was so runny.

This was my first attempt at enchiladas, and I was VERY impressed! It was delicious!! I used a hot tomato/green chili mix and put the cheese in the enchiladas as I was rolling them. DELICIOUS!

I'm glad that I looked threw the reviews! Doubling the soup mix was right on the nose and subing taco seasoning for the chili pepper was right on as well. The only thing that I would add is LOTS more cheese and cut down on the onion by about half. Over the finished product before baking as well as inside as you roll them up. But otherwise it was a huge hit and they dissapeared like magic!

Delicious! I really didn't change much at all. Added a tad more sour cream than called for and used red onion as that's all I had. When I boiled my chicken breast, I used chicken bouillion to give it more chicken flavor. 5 stars!!

I added a 1/2 can of enchilada sauce.  Also, I only had enough to fill 6 tortillas.  Everyone liked the final result.  Thanks.

This turned out really well.  The only modificatins I made was to add a small can of green enchilada sauce to the soup mixture and I also added a can of drained black beans to the chicken mixture.  Next time, I may try adding a can of black bean and corn salsa to the chicken mixture.  This is a keeper, hubby loved it.

I thoroughly enjoyed these enchiladas. I took a few of the other reviewer's suggestions. Instead of Cheddar cheese I used a Mexican blend. I also added enchilada sauce on top. My boyfriend loved them, and I will definitely make them again.

I took this to work for our party and everyone LOVED it! They were still talking about how great the chicken enchiladas were several days later. I doubled the sauce and used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas and I used a Mexican mix of shredded cheese rather than just Chedddar. When using corn tortillas, heat some olive oil in a pan then heat the corn tortillas for a few seconds before putting the chicken mixture into the tortillas. These enchiladas are incredible!

This is a pretty good recipe for a base.  It works much better adding a few other ingredients such as spinach, otherwise it's a little plain.  Would be great for fussy and/or simple eaters and kids.

These are good but a little on the bland side. Maybe more chili powder and enchilada sauce would help? They are very easy to make.

Pretty good - added one more can of soup since I didn't have enough sour cream and I like lots of sauce. Also didn't have a can of jalapeno chiles so I used a can of Mexican tomatoes w/chiles and threw in a couple of mushrooms because I think everything needs mushrooms! This one can go in the rotation.

LOVED IT!  Very easy to make....and easy to tweak.  I used leftover Mexican style BBQ chicken from a restaurant, shredded the meat. You could also get a grocery rotisserie bird and season her up. I also added a can of green enchilada sauce to the soup mixture.  Delish!  This is a keeper.

These were awesome.  Pretty easy too.  I took another reviewer's advice and added some taco mix to the filling as I like my tex-mex on the spicier side, and I think without it it might be a little bland(for me anyway).  This lends itself to all kinds of variations for fillings; shredded beef, bean and cheese.  We've made these several times now in our house and it's always very satisfying.

We all really enjoyed this enchilada recipe. I did add two cloves garlic and sauteed with the onion. I cut back a bit on the chopped onion. Used lo-fat cream of chicken soup, lo-fat sour cream and lo-fat mexican cheese blend. I would add an extra 1/2 can of soup and a bit more sour cream (with extra seasoning) to make it a bit more creamy. Thank you for the recipe!!

I thought these were great. I would definitely add less onion next time (or skipt all together), since the onion taste was overwhelming. We used colby jack cheese and added it the last few minutes of baking, so it would melt but not scorch.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years.  The addition of the chili pepper was good, but my husband prefers this recipe without.  Try using poblano cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom or chicken, I love it!  I always use shredded rotisserie chicken, it really cuts down on time.

YUM -I used the southwestern soup instead of cream of chicken and doubled the sauce recipe.  Definetly spray the pan with non-stick spray.  GREAT inexpensive way to use up leftover chicken breast.

I have made this several times now and my family prefers this recipe over any other chicken enchilada recipe we have tried.  It is a quick fix and freezes well too.

Fantastic Chicken enchiladas you can make in a snap!  I didn't have flour tortillas, so I sub. corn tortillas, It worked great!  I preheated to corn tortillas in the micro for 10 sec. to keep them from cracking.

These are awesome - I used alot of enchilada sauce though. One can in the mixture and the other to coat them when they bake.

OUTSTANDING!!

I was searching for a quick recipe that would quell my overwhelming desire for Mexican food & this sure did the trick! I thought it had a really great texture, creamy goodness that screams comfort food... I felt it could have used a bit more spicyness but I can do that myself next time. Big hit in our house! Thanks so much - I will defintely be making this again!

This had good flavor, but I had some problems with the texture--the enchiladas were kind of slimy and the soup/sour cream mixture was too much like gravy, rather than sauce.  I think  next time I'll use cream mixed with a can of chicken stock, with the peppers and some cumin.  And I think I'll bake the dish for 45-60 minutes.

Very good flavor. Easy, quick, and very versatile. I added corn, red beans and threw some cheese in the filling as well. ( We are a cheese loving family) I will be making this again. Thanks!!

Very good recipe with just the right balance of seasoning. I roasted and chopped fresh green chiles, otherwise followed it exactly.
Thanks Jeri!

In essence, this is the perfect base enchilada recipe from which to take off. I made my own corn tortillas - just a note, I will NEVER buy the icky rubbery store kind again! - and then pretty much followed the recipe but with some of my own ingredients. One frying pan gets the meat and onions and filling stuff, one saucepan gets the sour cream and cream soup mixture, and then just spread around the cream soup mixture, some under the enchiladas, a tad in the meat mixture for creaminess, a bit of cheese inside the enchilada, then the soup mixture and cheese on top, and you're done. Only the second time I've made enchiladas and they turned out perfect! Thanks bunches for this wonderful recipe!

Loved this recipe.  It came out perfect on the first try and was delicious. You could probably also leave off the tortillas and use it as a dip with some sort of corn chips. Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe before exactly as given and it was wonderful. Last night I tried it with shrimp instead of chicken and substituted the cream of chicken soup with 98% fat free cream of mushroom and it was fabulous! I sauted the shrimp with the onion and chili powder and did everything else the same. Will definitely make again!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I wanted to try something different and it turned out great!  My fiance loved it.  I added some Pace Mild Salsa on top then sprinkled mexican 4 cheese blend (instead of chedder) after it baked for 25 minutes.

THIS WAS A GREAT RECIPE! I CHANGED A FEW THINGS THAT I WILL SHARE: FIRST, I SEASONED THE CHICKEN WITH SALT, PEPPER, GARLIC SALT AND TACO SEASONING SO GIVE IT FLAVOR, THEN I ADDED 1 LARGE CAN OF HOT RED ENCHILADA SAUCE WITH THE SOUP AND SOUR CREAM. I ALSO ADDED CHEESE AND ENCHILADA SAUSE IN EACH ROLL. IT WAS THE PERFECT AMOUNT FOR 8 LARGE ENCHILADAS!

Super good!! I added red enchilada sauce, cajon seasoning to the meat, and extra chilies for more heat. My husband LOVED them and he's picky. Will definately make again and again. Thanks for the recipe!:)

I unfortunately was not impressed with this recipe. I have had lots of luck with almost 50 recipes off of this site but this one just wasn't that great. It didn't have any Mexican flavor to it, it was very mild and almost an Americanized version of enchiladas. Not like any enchiladas I've ever had in a restaurant. The chicken filling was pretty good though, we ate the insides of the enchiladas and that was not too bad. The chicken filling would be excellent added to a quesadilla.

This turned out wonderfully with just a few changes. First, I omitted the onions. Second, there was too much of the white sauce. I only used about half of it along with part of a bottle of Trader Joe’s Mexican sauce (any good red enchilada sauce would work too.) I made a half and half mix of red and white sauces, layered the enchiladas on top, then topped with red sauce and lots of cheese. The result was delicious! This is a great way to use up leftover cooked chicken. They also reheat beautifully.

This tasted great!  As usual, I was short on time and used canned white meat chunk chicken and instead of a can of green chiles I used about 3/4 of a can of drained Rotel.

This recipe is a winner.  I did however make a few changes.  I only used half a can of soup which I added to the skillet with the cooked chicken, half of the cream cheese and half of the sour cream. I also added corn and black bean salsa and topped the finished enchiladas with a little enchilada sauce. Loved it!

My husband & friends LOVE this recipe... I changed it up a little bit.  I use 1 Tablespoon of Veg. Oil instead of the butter and I also add some chopped jalapenos to the onion mix.  I also use some Adobo seasoning to add some more flavor.

I think this is the best dish I've made from allrecipes thus far!  We loved it.  I made some changes of my own - I added corn and used corn tortillas rather than flour.  I also didn't have any peppers, so I used a couple of teaspoons of salsa instead.  I added a little low fat refried beans to each tortilla before filling with the chicken mix.  And I used low fat cream of chicken soup and low fat cheese to make the dish a little healthier.  But it came out delish!

So simple and a great family night meal. I cooked the chicken along with onions and garlic. I also buy uncooked flour tortillas from Costco (refrigerated section) and brown them then add the chicken chili mixture.  These enchiladas are very mild in flavor so if you like spicy you'll need to kick it up a notch.  Only 4 stars because it's good and easy but not mind-blowing.

Great recipe, but I did alter it a bit.  I used shredded rotisserie chicken and only ¼ of an onion.  Instead of cream of chicken soup, I used Campbell's Condensed Creamy Chicken Verde Soup and substituted fiesta blend cheese for the cheddar.  Substituted salsa for the green chile peppers (also sprinkled some salsa on top before adding cheese).  Used 5 tortilla shells (instead of 8) stuffed fully.  In the future, I’ll probably double the soup and sour cream mixture, because my husband loves extra sauce.

These enchiladas were absolutely amazing!!!  The only things I did different was add extra chili powder and used red and yellow onion for color.  My husband said I should cook at our favorite Mexican restaraunt because they were better than the ones they serve there.  Delicious!!!

Oh, just delicious!  I was a bit skeptical of the undiluted soup, but the flavor was fantastic!  I did leave out the chili powder, substituted Colby/Monterey Jack for cheddar, since it's what I had on hand, and I only used 5 tortillas - stuffed them real full! My whole family loved this and I will surely be making again!  Thanks!

Recipe was a great "safe" one for traditional guests, but not one to impress refined eaters. Would not recommend using SHARP cheddar with this recipe because it would overpower the rest of the flavors. Stick with the salsas to add a kick.

These are very good, the cream sauce has a wonderful flavor. I have added some tobasco to jazz it up a bit.

This recipe was delicious.  I read other reviews that said it would be a bit bland, so I added Trader Joe's Enchilada sauce to the top in order to add flavor and spiciness.  I was a bit dissapointed when I was stuffing the tortillas because as soon as I put together an enchilada and placed it in the pan, the corn tortilla shell that I used would crack.  In the end, though, it didn't matter because the incredients along with the melted cheese caused the broken enchiladas to stick together and you couldn't even tell the shells were broken.

My boyfriend likes this recipe better when I use a southwestern cheese soup (rather than the chicken soup), or something of that sort.  He also likes me to add enchilada sauce.  I don't eat meat, so I put black beans in mine and use a veggie-friendly southwestern cheese soup.  I personally like the recipe w/o the enchilada sauce.  We give this a five, but only after alterations.

I had a surprise visit from my boyfriends family and I made this recipe because I had all the ingredients.  My boyfriends father wanted the recipe.  It isn't like traditional chicken enchiladas but it's pretty easy to make.  The flavors blend well and I like the concept of the rolled flour tortillas with the cheese on top.  You definately need a knife to cut them while eating.

We make this all of the time and everyone loves it. Really good meal for using up leftover chicken. I give it four stars because we prefer corn tortillas instead of the flour ones in the recipe. We made the dish with flour tortillas once....we don't like how the soggy and chewy they get when baked with sauce. Besides, we think the corn tortillas add better flavor. Using corn tortillas I'd give this recipe 5-stars.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! My husband and I both loved it and my husband even ate the leftovers(which he RARELY does). I did make a few substitutions simply cause I had them on hand. Instead of canned chilis I used a fresh Anaheim chili and I used Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar. I really liked the flavor of the Monterey Jack so I will probably continue using it instead of cheddar. This recipe is definitely a keeper and would be great for entertaining!

I though this was going to be an awesome recipe because of all the reviews raving about the enchiladas, however, I will never make these enchiladas again--they were so bland! I had guests over for dinner and they just ate them not to be rude. They were so bland that I did not even eat them! This was by far the worst dinner I have ever made. I was practically in tears because I thought they were going to be the best enchiladas. Therefore, if you want to make these enchiladas go for it. I just hope you enjoy them as much as others have enjoyed them. :)

Delicious and fast! I gave a 4-star only because I changed a few things based on other reviews. I used a small fresh roasted chicken from the deli (shredded with a fork) and only half of an onion. As several reviewers mentioned, I doubled the soup mixture. The chicken was prepared as instructed, but used  a packet of Taco Seasoning and simmered with 1/2 cup of water to combine the flavors. I poured red enchilada sauce on top of the casserole, and topped everything with cheese. It received great reviews from the peanut gallery! Thanks for the post!

This was so YUMMY!  The only thing that I did by mistake was that I didn't drain the green chilies and I cooked the chicken right in the sauce instead of adding pre-cooked chicken.  It was moist and delicious.  When it was ready to serve I topped it with green enchilada sauce.  I served this with the Mexican Rice III and a side of re-fried beans and I'll tell you my guests left asking for the recipes.

For my own personal taste I added red enchilada sauce to the soup mixture. Also, used whole wheat tortillas, 98% FF soup and light sour cream.  My husband loved this dish and said it was company worthy.

These are good and pretty easy, but my husband and I discussed ways we would adapt them while eating them. Basically, we just like things a bit spicier. I used green onions  and extra chili powder, some cumin and garlic powder. We ate them with enchilada sauce and hot sauce over the top. I used large tortillas, which resulted in 6 enchiladas. We did enjoy this; it just wasn't a favorite. I might make again with modifications.

The only thing I changed about this recipe was I used mozzerella cheese (it's all I had) and I poured 2 table spoons of enchilada sauce on each one after they were done because they didn't seem authentically mexican tasting. I wasn't too impressed with this recipe but I gave it a 4 star because my daughter and husband really enjoyed them.

I got two thumbs up for this recipe.  I didn't have green chiles, so I added a touch of Cayanne to the filing and mixed in a half of a can of hot enchilada sauce to the soup mixture.  I ended up with 5 enchiladas which was perfect for two of us with leftovers for lunch.  Yummy!

I doubled the soup/sour cream mixture and used the reduced fat soup and fat free sour cream and it tasted great.  I also used somebody else's tip and added some cheese in each of the enchiladas.  I will definitely continue to make this again and again.

YUMMY!  These were a hit in our house, and the one that was leftover, heated up great for lunch the next day.  The perfect amount of seasoning/hot spices.  I may have overstuffed them a bit, though, because I only ended up using 6 tortillas.

This was a hit! I used creamy chicken verde soup (2 cans) instead of the cream of chicken and it gave it a little more zing. This will become a favorite.

My husband gave these a shot and I have to update from 4 stars to 5. He went with 1 1/2 cans of soup, some Carne Asada seasoning in the chicken, then topped with cheese and enchilada sauce. They were GREAT!!

This was fantastic!  We're huge fans of green chilis so I think next time I'll add another can on top as well.  I found the one can of soup to be adequate but in addition, I poured a half can of Hatch's green chili enchilada sauce with some splashes of habanero for some kick.  These were so easy!  Now that I know the original recipe is *perfect*, I'm going to try to lighten it up with low fat soup, sour cream, and cheese next time.  Stay tuned!

These were the best, I'm not a big fan of enchiladas, but these were delicious. I did add a can of Rotel to the chicken mixture and a little on the top, also I did double the sauce. I made Mexican Rice II from this site, it was a very filling satisfying meal. Definitly a keeper!!!

I put a little extra cheese inside the enchiladas and added velveeta to the topping as well as the cheddar cheese.  We just like things cheesy.  But it is simply a wonderful dish.  I will definitely make it again.

These were fantastic and I will for sure make them again! My boyfriend & I like spicy food so I added an additional 4 oz of chopped jalapenos, which added a nice kick. I agree with past statements that this recipe does not yeild 8 servings...I got 5 out of mine. Enjoy :)

YUMMY! I made this for the first time and it turned out fantastic. My hubby isn't fond of really hot food, so I only used 3/4 of the can of chilis. I also added about 1/3cup of mild enchilada sauce. I stuffed 5 tortillas with the mixture and there was plenty of sauce. It did turn out a little mild though, after dinner my husband asked if I could make it spicer next time. I served it with Best Spanish Rice (also from this site). It was a tad on the rich side, next time I will serve on shredded lettuce and top with fresh tomatoes.

My only complaint is that it took longer than expected to prepare. I put sliced chicken in with the onions and then when cooked removed it and shredded. This took longer than expected, I would want to have that ready ahead of time or plan for the extra time it takes. Also maybe with practice this wouldn't take so long to make.

This was pretty good, as well as being quick and easy.  I used leftover marinated and grilled chicken from our bbq the night before, gave it a little more flavor.

Excellent recipe!My first time making enchiladas.I used mozarella cheese instead of cheddar.I was very carefull not to use to many peppers seeing my family is not into to much spicey food.Overall! Very easy to make! I doubled up on everything seeing I could really stuff the tortillas with the filling.Served with lettuce and tomatoe and side of guacomolie.Would like to try deep frying the wrapped tortillas for about one minute next time and then baking them.Guess they would be like chimichangas. Thanks and Sorry for my spelling. Thanks

Very good I added green ench. sauce to the sour cream mixture so it wouldn't be so creamy. Suits our tastes better with some ench. sauce to bring down the richness but other than that very good.

I've made these three times now, and they've been great each time.  I roll cheese in some of the enchiladas sometimes to make them even more cheesier.  Very easy and very good.  I definitely recommend these!

This recipe is wonderful.  I tried the recipe doubling the sauce mix and then keeping the sauce as is.  I thought doubling the sauce mix made the recipe too rich.  The second time I made it was with less sauce mix.  I also added a little bit of salsa and chili powder to the sauce to add some flavor and spice as  well as some mushrooms to the enchiladas.  They were to die for.  Paired with some mexican rice for a side, this recipe makes an excellent meal.

what can I say.  My family loved it. I lightly fried the tortillas in olive oil before filling and wrapping and they werent too soggy. I garnished with fresh avacado because I had some on hand and we love it.  I also followed another reviewers advice and mixed in a can of green enchilada sauce with the soup mixture and used a mixture of moneray jack and chedder cheese. ( I was low on chedder) My family raved. thanks!

Yum!  We loved this recipe.  We substituted butter for the margarine and a can of extra hot Rotel for the green chile peppers.  We ended up with six big enchiladas instead of eight, and served with a small green salad.  Delicious.

Delicious. I took others advice and doulbed the soup mix just to make sure I had enough and it worked out perfectly. My Enchiladas also stuck to the dish like others, but that's nothing a little cooking spray won't cure before you spread the soup mix onto the casserole dish!

Wonderful recipe!  First time making them and they were great!  Did some modifications as others suggested: green peppers & enchilada sauce. Yum!  A new house favorite.

I make this all the time now.  I add one can of red enchilada sauce to 3/4 can of cream of chicken soup. Then add a few scoops of sour cream.  I also cut my chicken into small pieces and sprinkle with taco seasoning before baking (wrap in foil). Excellent, easy recipe!

This was an incredibly yummy recipe!  I did make minor modifications to it though.  Instead of using green chili peppers, I used 1/2 can of "Mexican" style Rotel Diced Tomatoes.  For an even cheesier flavor, I added to slices of American Cheese and 1 Cup of Cheddar Cheese to the meat mixture.  That helped keep the enchiladas moist.  Also, I will be working on tweaking the recipe because I didn't think there was enough "sauce" to spoon on the top - although if I doubled the soup/sour cream mixture, I believe that would be way too much sauce.

I almost gave this 5 stars, but I can imagine there are even better enchiladas. Still, this was a fabulous dish. I enjoyed them fresh, and as leftovers. As a beginning cook, I was surprised that awesome enchiladas can be made without tomatoes in any form (salsa, etc.). This is one of the few allrecipes.com recipes I've put in my online "recipe box". Thanks a bunch!

I had never made chicken enchiladas before, but this recipe was very easy!  We absolutely loved it, even the kids.  The only thing I did different was used can chicken!  It was delicious.

I just made this recipe last night and my husband who usually doesn't like chicken enchiladas loved them.  I will definately make this often.  I will double the sour cream/soup mixture, not because of dryness, just because we liked it a lot.

I cooked this for my fiance's family and we all loved it! To make it a little more heart-healthy, I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and whole wheat tortillas. I think next time I will probably also add a bit of salsa to the top for a little tomatoey taste. All in all, though, this is a great recipe just as is!

Wonderful flavor!  Definitely different from the chicken enchiladas I normally make in corn tortillas with a red enchilada sauce...nice change!  I used 1.5 cups of sour cream instead of 1/2 as in recipe because I like a lot of sauce.  Came out wonderful and tasted great with the 'Spanish Rice Original' on this site.

This was great.  My husband and 2 year old both loved it.  Of course, I left the chiles out for the 2 year old!  It was very easy.  I used the canned cooked chicken breast and it didn't take much time at all.  Great with salsa and mexican rice.

Not really exciting.  We did leave out the chiles, but I don't think they would have helped the overall bland feeling the soup imparted to the flavor.

My kids weren't that crazy about it, but they are very picky! My husband and I absolutely LOVE it and make it every week!

Entire family, from Grandpa to toddlers, enjoyed this dish.  Easy, tasty and not to spicy for all to enjoy.  Has become a classic at our home and my daughter and daughter-in -law have both added this to their collections.
