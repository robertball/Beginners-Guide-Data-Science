This was great!! We used 4 shallots but added more mushrooms. We also used jalape√±o bacon for a little more zing. With the left overs we added cut up carrots and potatoes! This made a great stew!! We were thinking for another meal adding beef broth and barley for a beef and barley soup.

Another outstanding success although I did cook for a little longer than the recipe stated. Made no changes at all - served with sweet potato mash and sweetheart cabbage

I used a chuck roast and cut it into pieces. I cooked it all day so it was nice and tender. This was an easy and tasty recipe but it was missing something - just can't put my finger on it. Send with roasted carrots and homemade white bread.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it turned out amazing! I will definitely make this again. My family loved it and best of all I have great left-overs.

found it tasteless and the gravy/sauce very thin. I followed the recipe faithfully

Very easy recipe and the meat was very tender. However it lacked something in flavor. It needs just a bit of zip.
