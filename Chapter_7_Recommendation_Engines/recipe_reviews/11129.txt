I made these cookies for a charity bake sale.  They came out perfect!  The second day of the sale, a classmate came by to see if there were any left (there weren't), but I gave him the recipe.

The cookies are excellent for texture. I was a little unsure about the caraway flavor (it isn't easily suited for "sweet" things), but I soon started to appreciate it.  The underlying flavor of the cookies is truly wonderful, and I think next time I'll try using cardamom instead of the caraway.

I like caraway seeds and think it makes a great combination in these cookies. Turned out great!
