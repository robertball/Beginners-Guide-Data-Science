A variation of this recipe has been in my family forever. Pure comfort food. You can vary the ingredients to suit your taste. We normally make it with french fried onions on top and bake rice in it using 2 cups of rice and 4 cups of broth.

Looks disgusting, but tastes good! I wouldn't serve it to anyone, but I definitely would eat it while alone on a Saturday night.

Totally American, but a great grandma dish! I always leave out the cheese as I didn't grow up with it on the farm. It is what I crave when I am sick. Thanks for sharing! I didn't change anything else.

I Love this old casserole my mom used to make. Sometimes I will add mushrooms and maybe some water chestnuts, sliced. Just a little extra crunch.

Wow! This stuff is so good! It's the epitome of comfort food. It was so easy to make, too! I followed the recipe except for the nuts. Didn't have any and it really didn't need them. I'll be cooking this again!

Everyone liked it including my picky kids. I served it with white rice and soy sauce, was perfect mix.  I froze the leftovers and they were great. Making again, which I rarely do.

Followed the suggestion of adding rice and broth.  Also my chow mien noodles had gone stale, but I did have a extra can of french fried onions,  substituted those for the topping.  Hubs and littles loved it, only wish I would have doubled the recipe.

Very tasty dish.  Only thing I changed was I added some chow mein noodles to sprinkle on top after serving.

This was delicious, but there was one major problem: too much liquid. Without the water, the consistency of the dish would probably be just about right. As it was, the water didn't evaporate much and left too much liquid in the bottom of the casserole. I toasted a piece of bread for one of my *three* helpings (yikes!), and besides tasting really good, it helped soak up some of the excess liquid.
