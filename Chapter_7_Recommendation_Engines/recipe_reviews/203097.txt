There isn't much to add to this dish. It's spicy & easy to make. The only things I did different were: 1)didn't measure the onions/green peppers 2)used about 1/4 a white onion, 1/2 a red onion, and 3/4 of a large pepper. 3) used a local, southern spicy, packaged sausage 4)used 2 boil-in-bag brown rice, cooked seperately and added with 1 1/2 cups water at the end. 4) excluded the green onion(didn't have) and served. I tip my hat to you. This is the best jambalaya I've had; Beats any restaurant.

Having a Cajun grandmother, I love Cajun food. This is a really good recipe. It reminds me of weekends at Grandma's house. Thanks Ernest!

This is really good! I make it just as the recipe states, except I use chorizo sausage. I'm actually making it for the second time tonight.

I made this a couple of nights ago...it was amazing!  I used Red Bell Pepper (cuz I like them better) and I used shrimp (no chicken...its a texture thing).  My boyfriend and I both loved it!  I am ready for it again!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

this recipe worked as a good starting point for me which is how I prefer to cook. it is an excellent recipe and would be good with no change. i chose to add extra meat and spice, plus some chopped tomatoes that I like in jambalaya. it worked well for my tastes and the rest of the group at my place for football.

loved a good jambalya recipe with out tomatoes!  Grew up in South Louisiana and never had it with tomatoes.  Only substitution I make is to use either beef  broth or chicken broth instead of water.   I also use dehydrated celery instead of fresh due to my kids.

I love this recipe! I have grown up eating and making jambalaya and I like getting away from the same old tomato base variety.  My only twist to this recipe is after browning rice I throw everything into my rice cooker and let it finish the job.

Fantastic and Easy to Make! 
Only changes made was that I used whole grain rice and served with spinach, which I mixed into my dish.
