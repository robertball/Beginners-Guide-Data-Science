Great flavor, I agree the combination sounds odd to some but the flavor is wonderful.  I did change a few things, I cooked the onion and garlic then added everthing else for the sauce except substituted the cloves for 1/2 tsp. chili powder.  I then poured it over bonless skinless chicken breasts in my crock pot and let it cook on high for 3 hours.  It turned out great.

Very tasty!  the only changes I made were a lot more cayenne since my kids like spicy food and 2 Tbls of chile powder.  Also, I always marinate any meat before using it in a dish.  put in a ziplock bag with oil ,garlic, chile powder, cumin salt and pepper for a few hours.

Delicious and easy.  I used three pounds of boneless skinless chicken breasts (cut into thirds), 1/4 teaspoon cloves instead of 1/2, and added a chopped yellow bell pepper after reading the other reviews.  Served with brown rice.  Definitely try this if you are bored with your chicken recipes.  The combination of ingredients may look odd but it tastes great!

Made this for a wine-pairing dinner at a Paso Robles winery with Chef Andre and the result was fabulous!  Adjustments: Used fresh ripe tomatoes, added crushed chiptole pepper & more cayenne at the end.  Used chix thigh meat only, 1/2" dice.  Omitted sesame seeds.  Salted modestly (since fresh tomatoes were used).  Served inside a crispy cup (wonton).  Best if made 1-2 days in advance.  Flavor development was amazing!  I'll make again (for fewer than 65 people!) and will serve w/mini tortillas as a gourmet taco.

This is fabulous - very rich and savory, full of wonderful fragrance and flavor.  The first time I made it it turned out a bit too sweet for my taste, so now I leave out the brown sugar entirely and go a little heavier on the cayenne.  That makes it perfect for me.

I made this for the first time ever for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  So much better than the mole I've had in restaurants. Instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used a bar of chipotle dark chocolate from World Market, and I finished it in the oven instead of on the stove - 325 for 2-2 1/2 hours.  It made the chicken fall off the bone. I just wish there were more leftovers today...

Loved this.  The only thing I would change is that I would put the sauce in a blender or food processer to homogenize it before serving.

Disappointing and not what I was expecting.  Good flavor which is why it's still 3 stars in my book.  I followed another review and did this in my slow cooker for 3 hours on high so it would be really tender.

Outstanding!  I had never had this before but I always thought it sounded interesting, so I made it for Valentine's day (since it has chocolate in it) and my husband and I LOVED it.  I just used boneless/skinless chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand but maybe next time I'll buy the whole cut up chicken.  I'm sure it's delish w/ the dark meat, too!  We'll definitely be making this one again.  Thanks!!

This isn't a "real" mole but it's a great substitute if you don't want to work on one recipe for 3 days. I did add some dried peppers to add a nice smoky flavor.

Great flavor but I would lightly salt the chicken before browning.  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and they did not absorb the flavor from the sauce as much as I would have liked.  A great quick change for weekday chicken dinners.

yum!  this was as good as our local mexican place.  i had to leave out the raisins and sesame seeds b/c of the kids.  I will probably reduce the brown sugar by half and all a little more cayenne next time.  this was a keeper!

Yum! I really enjoyed this sauce as something different to serve to my bored family! I added some chopped bell peppers to incorporate a vegetable. We had it with tortilla chips and rice--the sauce makes a great dip for the chips.

This may not be an authentic recipe for mole but it is  good! I added 1/4 tsp smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder and it came out wonderfully. Just the right amount of heat and sweetness. My friend loved it so much that he went home the next day and made it again for his family, who also loved it! I served it over Spanish Rice. Amazing!

Made exactly as written, didn't taste like any mole I've ever had. After simmering for 4 hours & not liking the flavor we added 2 Tablespoons of chile powder, then tried salt, then tried mexican oregano, anyway we kept trying to add something to "fix" the sauce but to no avail. I tested this last night for a party Sunday & boy am I glad I did.

I've never had mole sauce before so I've nothing to compare it to but we really enjoyed it. The kids aren't fans of the raisin so I left those out. Served this over rice. Yum and thank you so much!

Really good! I only changed a couple things: I made it a little spicier and I add some diced green chilies. I also replaced the sesame seeds and raisins with 1/2 cup crushed almonds because that how my friend makes it. Huge hit...and really easy to make. Will make again.

Followed the recipe to the letter (except for using sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds) and it turned out rather bland and lackluster. I feel like reducing the sauce may have produced better results... But the recipe didn't call for that. I also think I'd use cocoa powder next time instead of chips.

In all honesty, I have not ever made mole before, nor have I eaten a lot of it.  However, my family loved this dish and my husband raved for a couple of days.  My stepdaughters are Mexican and have an abuela that makes "the best mole in the world!"  But they really enjoyed this dish as they told me all about hers ;-)  They did convince me to add some more cayenne pepper and chile powder, as they like it a bit spicier.  I also did not have sesame seeds on hand, but I'll try that next time.  I really appreciate how simple this recipe was and how fragrant and flavorful too.  As another review recommended I used an immersion blender to puree the sauce. (Removed the chicken first, of course.)  Great recipe.  Thanks!

Very good, easy mole.
I took a lazy turn. Browned the onions, garlic and spices, added 4 frozen chicken breasts and the liquids. Cooked it very low for about 3 hours, then removed chicken, shredded it and used emersion blender on sauce.  Cooked this down to a thick sauce and added raisins, added back to chicken.  Super yummy, super easy.  Served for a dinner party the first time I made it and got rave reviews.

First time I ever made a mole and it turned out GREAT! 
Changes: 
Cut up chicken tenders so cooked pretty quickly. 
Didn't have any bay leaves so I completely omitted that. 
Didn't have sesame seeds so I used sesame oil to Brown my chicken.

Very good. My whole family enjoyed it. I would like to try to thicken the sauce a little more next time as mine was thinner than I wanted.

Not a keeper. Too strong of ground cloves. There's no chili powder which would have been better.

This was a fabulous tasting recipe. I used a rotisserie chicken and took it off the bone. Then once mole was finished I put it over rice with fresh cilantro on top. I'm definitely going to make this again many times for the family. They loved it!

We used deboned chicken thighs. Excellent results, but would use unsweetened chocolate next time, rather than the chocolate chips.

very good flavors!  I didn't put in the brown sugar as someone posted.  It would have been way too sweet.  I pureed the sauce so that it wasn't chunky and it was more like the mole sauce that I know.  I would used 1/2 the amount of cloves and I did add more cayanne pepper, for the sweet and spicy.

Absolutely, I would definitely make this again!!!!   I may even try it with a little more heat, as a few of my family members like spicy foods!   I had an incredible Mole at a local restaurant one time, and have been looking for a recipe to match it.... This is as close as I have found.  Loved it!

I made this with all ingredients listed. I did add 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and I love garlic so I added more minced garlic and more comino. I also added a teaspoon more of cayenne pepper. I puréed the sauce after I let it cool down that way you don't have chunks of tomato in the sauce. Love combination of flavors. I have made this for many potlucks and have had request from friends to make this. By the way I don't eat this the same day I cook it I cool in the fridge and the next day put in a crockpot and taste so much better the next day.

The first time I make a recipe, I stick to it closely so the only change I made was adding a few more chocolate chips.  This recipe is easy and yields a lot of bang for your buck.  Feel free to add more cayenne if you like heat but if you make it as written, you won't be disappointed.  Delicious!

Loved this recipe. We like food on the spicier side, so made some adjustments to make it spicier. Also followed the recommendations in the reviews to bake in the dutch oven versus cook on the stove. After the sauce was prepared, I put in the oven at 350 for about 2 hours (added a little extra chicken stock) and the meat came out deliciously soft and well flavored. Super easy and quick recipe, will be a go to recipe.

Made this tonight with no major changes, just added bell pepper to use some up. Followed another reviewer's advice by using the slow cooker. Love it! I didn't really know what to expect, but a new favorite, I think!

I followed this recipe to the letter. It is a winner! It has the perfect blend of spices that will surprise and please even the harshest critic. I was skeptical about the 3-layers of sweet: the brown sugar, chocolate, and raisins, but combined they only enhance the melding of flavors. I served it with brown rice and homemade refried beans. The meal was intended for expected guests the following day. It didn't last that long, which creates a dilemma. What in the world will I served tomorrow??? This chicken mole is better than any I've had in even my favorite authentic Mexican restaurant.

Was delicious! Made it with left over turkey and puréed the sauce before adding the turkey. Definitely will make it again!

Very interesting flavor and a really good mole 'cheat' recipe. We wrapped the chicken in tortillas with some adobo sour cream. Also, I added anise seeds. Yum!

Loved this sauce. I've made mole before and although it was good it always tasted like something was missing. This will be my go to recipe for mole from now on.

Great recipe. I made a few modifications. I used only 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, added 1/4 teaspoon chili powder, crushed almonds instead sesame seeds, fried the chicken in bacon fat, and added a 1/4 cup mole sauce (Dona Maria brand). Thanks!

Every time I have made this recipe it has been a hit. Even my husband (who does not like mole)likes it. Although I do leave out the ground cloves. I also blend everything after I add the chocolate and raisins. I then pour the mixture over the chicken and let it simmer until the chicken is cooked completely. I also use boneless skinless chicken but that is just my preference.

Yum!! Hubs made this with chix halves in a slow cooker for at least 5 hours.(til it fell off the bone!) 
He also threw in 1/4c of Hershey kisses before he realized we had the morsels. Still not too chocolatey. :)  
We served it over white rice.

I made this in my Dutch oven on the stovetop and it turned out to be the best Mole we have had. I used an extra tbsp of cayenne and added a tbsp of cumin. One and a half onion and 2 bay leaves. Simmered an extra hour and served it with. Homemade Mexican rice and red refried beans. Wow!
