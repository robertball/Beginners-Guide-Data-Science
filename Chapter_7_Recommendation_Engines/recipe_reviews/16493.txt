My husband and I eat a version of this meal at least once a week (we started several years ago when I was still in college).  Although I don't use cilantro or lemon juice, I usually do add some cumin and garlic to the beans.  I make a big sticky pot of white rice and stir the beans (and all of the juice) into the rice.  Sometimes we'll grill some chicken breasts on the Foreman, cut it into strips and mix them in as well.  We top with salsa, cheese, and sour cream.  Makes a great burrito filling, too!  A filling, healthy (a few ounces of black beans has 10 times the antioxidents as the same amount of blueberries!), and tasty meal.

Sounded too bland for us so, I sauted an onion in about 2 tbls. butter until soft then added the black bean juice and enough water to make 2 cups liquid.  For my spices I added chili powder,  cayenne pepper, garlic, cilantro, and cumin. (No lemon juice)  Brought all that to a boil, added 2 cups rice.  Cooked 20 minutes.  Once the rice was cooked I added the black beans and cooked spicy link sausage.  I think it would also be great with chicken or shrimp.  Mine was pretty spicy, but everyone asked me to make it again.

Pass around a bottle of good red wine vinegar and a bowl of finely chopped onions to add a little extra spark. Loved the beans without the extras too.

I made this with my own little twists.  I used fresh cilantro and garlic.  I also used lime juice instead of lemon.  I also added some cayenne pepper for an extra little zing!  I'd say it was pretty good.  :)

This recipe was really good, but it needed a lot of tweaking  I also sauteed the onions with butter and garlic, while cooking the rice.  Then I drained the beans, and added everything to a pan, and had it on top of the stove for a while.  While doing that I added a little celery, cilantro, and parsley.  It came out pretty good, but I forgot to spice it up so everyone added hot sauce, which also worked out b/c everyone likes it at different levels of hotness.  Will make again, and was pretty good, but I think it will be a "nothing else to make" recipe.

As is, I didn't care for it... very bland and unappealing.  I made it again, but this time omitted the lemon juice, cilantra, and garlic-- instead I added 2 packets of Goya Sazon and some black bean salsa, which improved it somewhat.

This truly is an easy recipe, although I would go easy on the cilantro next time.

We enjoyed this dish with just a couple of changes.  I cooked the rice in vegetable broth, used fresh cilantro instead of dried along with some fresh parsley, and also added 1/2 tsp. each of cumin and turmeric.  I also had sauteed some chopped onion and garlic in the pan before adding the rice and beans.  Served it in whole wheat wraps, with sour cream and salsa.

I found this recipe to be quite good after a bit of tweaking. There was no meat thawed for dinner, it was a rainy day, and I was pressed for time. 

I prepped my rice in a rice cooker, used Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning instead of garlic powder, added some diced Vlasic Roasted Red Sweet Peppers, fresh lemon juice, and a teaspoon of bacon drippings. I went easy on the Cilantro, too. I added more water as it was warming up and let it simmer down. Good stuff! I bet it'll taste even better later. Thanks, gypsy!

I love recipes that call for ingredients I have in the house without having to run to the store. The fact that its a healthy recipes is even better. Now combine this with good taste and I'm in. I added a bit of grated cheese when it was done.

The lemon juice is a big mistake. I had to add hot sauce and honey to make it palatable. Onion would probably be good in this.

Easy to make, but definitely could use some onion. It also lacks the amount of oregano in the ingredient list; and oregano is an interesting spice choice.  I also added corn, and served it with cheese and sour cream.

Very quick and easy! It was a little bland, though.  Next time I would spice it up with a little hot sauce and maybe some lime juice.  I made this dish just as the recipe directed, but next time (and there will be a next time as it was so easy) I will definately make some changes.

As an "emergency-meal" I liked it.  After a trip to the supermarket I'll probably add chopped tomatoes, diced red onion, and fresh cilantro.  And definitely fresh lime juice rather than lemon next time.

I was not int this dish.  The garlic powder is overpowering and the whole meal has a very flat flavour overall.  My husband doesn't like cilantro, so I substituted parsley - maybe that was a game-changer.  I won't make this again.

This is quick and pretty good...but bland. I'd put tomato sauce on it for flavor if I made it again. Chile!

I'm sorry...I normally don't give recipes a bad review, but this just was not good.  I tried to eat it by the recipe and couldn't.  I added a little Cajun seasoning, which helped a bit, but I just couldn't even eat a whole serving of it.

This recipe is very bland and needs a lot of help.  I think that it gives you a good starting point, but the next time I prepare this recipe I will use the tips from the other reviewers.

Changed this to my family's tastes. Cooked the rice in the bean juice and chicken broth with garlic and onion. Then added the beans at the end. Delicious!

I use minced garlic, 1 T, rather than powder, and 2 T meundu mix in the water to cook with the rice, and do not use dried cilantro. Use significantly less lemon juice (1.5 T) and less beans for more of a rice mixed/beans. Use fresh cilantro once complete. With edits, becomes side dish one night, left overs go into tacos the following.

I'm not a good cook so I love very basic recipes.  I always follow recipes exactly but I got very scared about the 1 TABLESPOON of garlic powder. I went ahead and put in about a half Tablespoon.  Husband will be tasting it as soon as he's home from work.  I hope he likes it!  Thank you!
