I have been looking for a ramen noodle stir fry for the longest time, and my search is over. This is just fantastic! However, we substitute the broccoli flowerets and cauliflowerets for red and green bell pepper, but that's just personal preference; this is also quite tasty with the second addition either almonds, peanuts, or cashews, and some hot pepper flakes for spice. Follow the instructions and everything else as is, and there's no disappointment to be had.

Very good, healthy and fast weeknight recipe. My sons both liked it a lot.  I doubled and skipped the flavor packets and used 1c chicken broth with cornstarch instead.  Also added 1tsp chili paste with garlic and used snowpeas, shredded carrots, red pepper and sprouts for veggies.

Good concept. I like the noodles and the flexibility with the vegetables. The addition of the flavor packet from the ramen noodles made this dish incredibly salty (I only added half of it as I spilled it all over the counter when I snipped it open). Next time I will add chicken broth with a little cornstarch. I love salty foods and this was over the top for me.

I changed this up a little and used a frozen pkg of stir fry vegtables.  I also opted to use a 1/2 cup of bottled stir fry sauce and a little water instead of the soy or teriyaki sauce.  Very Yummy!  We'll make this one again for sure.

This was great!  I regretfully gave the leftovers to my fiance for lunch.  I would have loved another bowl.  I omitted the bean sprouts; I don't really care for them.  I also used 2 of the 3 seasoning packets for the noodles.  I think their spice packets are pretty salty.  Also, for those out there who don't have a wok, don't be afraid to try this in a regular skillet.  That is what I did and it still turned out delicious.

Very, very good. The only change I made was to use two packages of noodles instead of one. Next time, I'm also going to add some eggs, water chestnuts, and green peas. Other than that, the dish is delicious.

Really great and so easy!!  Basically you can add in any veggies that are leftover in the fridge.  I would substitute whatever's on hand but will always use at least the onions and cabbage.  I also added nuts to the dish which was a great addition.  I used 2 packages of ramen noodles and only 1 of the seasoning packets (had the oriental on hand which was great because the seasoning packet from that added to the dish). Used soy sauce because that's all I had and it was delicious !!  Will definitely make again!!

Doubled recipe and added a 3rd pack of ramen noodles (not the extra seasoning). Used 1/2 the recommended soy sauce. Fed all 5 of us.

I followed some of the other reviewers advice and doubled the Ramen noodles (we like noodles) and threw out the seasoning packets.  Instead I used a can of chicken broth thickened with flour.  I used the veggies I had on hand - broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and a bit of leftover yellow bell pepper.

This is an excellent recipe as is.  The salty taste is apparent when the recipe is first made.  I used 1/2 cup lite soy, 2 ramen noodle packs with only 1 package seasoning.  I am not a cauliflower fan so I added pea pods and used canned bean sprouts.  However, give this recipe a day for the flavours to meld and wow!!  No salt.  Glad I have leftovers!!

Very quick and easy recipe! I just used frozen stir fry vegetables and put as much soy sauce and teriyaki that I liked. The ramen noodles did become soggy, but thats because I cooked them too long before adding them to the vegetables. I will make it again!

The soy sauce with the seasoning packet made this recipe way too salty.  I will try this recipe again using teriyaki sauce next time.

was surprised how good this was.  had a package of ramen and didnt know what to do with it.  i added about a tablespoon of minced garlic to the oil while it heated.  i also seasoned the chicken with sea salt, black pepper, and ginger.  came out excellent, even my picky 4 year old ate it...with her addition of parmesan cheese!

Sweet and Spicy - is the way I made it. It was declicious. I used coconut oil instead of veg, since it is so much better for you. Added a clove of garlic and about the same of ginger, sliced up with chicken. Used 1/2 c. chicken broth & about 1 tbs. of cornstarch instead of seasoning packet (as others had mentioned). Finally, added about 1-1/5 t. of sriracha (rooster chile sauce) and a few shakes of red pepper. Was still a little sweet for my taste, but definitely a perfect mixture of sweet and then spicy. Will def make again!

I was looking for a simple , quick, and relatively cheap stir fry with noodles and this was a great starter recipe! I hadn't even considered ramen, thank you! I used frozen stir fry veggies and added bamboo shoots, orange bell peppers, and baby corn for my veggies then added the chix seasoning and the teriyaki. Turned out great, I can't wait to eat leftovers!!

I don't know if we did something wrong (we followed instructions to the letter) but this was honestly the worst thing I've ever cooked. The soy overpowered everything until it sort of makes your tongue crinkle up.  I am going back to Italian food and will henceforth get my Asian cuisine in restaurants!

I made this for our experimental diner. I used chow mein noodles and they would work good for this however don't cook them as lond as the bag says. Also don't use as much soya sauce as the recipe calls for. I might try this again with different noodles and less soya sauce.

Ok so I made this as written and agree it is way too salty.  It is a good base recipe, but definately needs tweaking.  I will make it again and make some changes. Thanks.

This was really good.  Used a bag of fresh stir fry vegetables, onion, garlic, yellow peppers, mushrooms, bean sprouts. You can really use ANYTHING from the crisper!  We omitted the chicken since we are vegetarians. I doubled the noodles since they are a favorite. Otherwise, a ver QUICK and EASY meal!  This will be in our weekly rotation!

I made this last night for dinner for my teenage children & husband.  I thought it was ok.  I think I would have rated it much higher if it was not made with Ramen noodles. I found them to be too soft.  The kids seemed to think it was ok - not their favorite.  I will make this again if I can find a different thin noodle to subsitute with.

This was super easy, quick and surprisingly full of flavor!  To make it even easier, I used a package of julliened vegetables so the only thing I had to chop was the onion.  I doubled the recipe so we would have plenty of left overs and it turned out great.  This is a keeper :)!  Thanks for sharing.

This was good. We used some frozen stir fry veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, pea pods and baby corn) and threw in some fresh mushrooms. I added some hot chili sauce to the adults plates and everyone ate it like crazy. I double the recipes for 3 kids and 2 adult and there was very little left over. Quick and easy, would use this recipe again.

This was really good!  I did make a few changes.  I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables instead of the fresh vegetables.  I also added half a brick of extra firm tofu (about 7 oz) cut into cubes.  Then I added about a tablespoon of sesame seeds.

I only used half the amount of sauce, and it was still way too salty.  I can't imagine it being edible with that much teriyaki sauce and ramen seasoning.

My hubby loved these, which I think is due to the noodles.  The kids gobbled it down too.  This was quick, easy, and tasted very good.  This will probably wind up in the monthly rotation.

I was not in love with the flavors of this dish. As other reviewers stated, it was a bit salty for my liking. In an attempt to add more/different flavor, I mixed in garlic pepper paste. This gave it a zing but I still wasn't thrilled to reheat the leftovers the next day. Three stars for bein' easy!

This is simple and delicious! I have made it many times using a variety of veggies and one time I fried tofu in place of the chicken. This recipe is foolproof. 100% recommended.

Should of known a gal from that part of the country, and I know it well, could cook such a tasty and inexpensive dish. I remember you from the bus drivers lunches we used to have. Enjoyed seeing your recipe and I will be trying it...always have Ramen noodles around for quick-fix meals. Say "Hi" to the rest of the gang for me...if you see them. Cudo's kiddo. Yeah Sublimity...I live in Salem, OR now...but make trips your way quite often.  Great recipe!!

This is SO GOOD. Quick, easy, healthy. I added fresh Ginger, garlic, basil & mint, sesame seeds, cashews, subsituted ground turkey for the chicken (because that's what I had) and used a rice noodle bowl from Trader Joes instead of ramen noodles to boost it's healthiness. I'll make this one again for sure.

This was awesome. Everyone in the family loved it. I added a few more veggies like sugar snappeas and fresh mushrooms so their was a boot load of veggies. And I didn't measure them either. Plan of making it again later this week..

This is too salty for me.  I did use half of the chicken flavor packet from the Ramen noodles.  Next time, I would half the soy sauce too. The Ramen noodles worked well in it.

This is a keeper - Changes I made - 2 lbs of chicken -  3 noodle packages - 1 1/2 pks of seasoning mix - 2 bags frozen stir fry veggies - 1 can of bean sprouts and 1/2 c light soy sauce.  Excellent - made a huge batch - can't wait to make it for a party.

This recipe was very easy and the kids loved it. I'll be making it again! I made two at the same time - one pan for my kids with the veggies they like (added shredded carrots and green beans and omited the broccoli), and one pan for me with the veggies I like (added shredded carrots, celery, and omitted the cauliflower). I used both teriyaki sauce and splashed with soy sauce. Both pans turned out great and I made the vegetables crisp enough that it made good leftovers too!

This was really, really good.  I used lite soy sauce, 2 pkgs. of ramen noodles but only 1 packet of seasoning.  It was still salty, but I think next time, I will put some crushed pineapple in at the end to help cut the saltiness some.  I love stir fry and I think it's time to get a wok.

This is a very flexible recipe, you could use a number of vegetable combinations (i used cabbage, green & red bell peppers, broccoli, zuccini, onion and garlic), or different flavored ramen noodles with beef or shrimp. My family enjoyed it, but I don't think they will ever ask me to make it again. However, when low on funds or time, I could easily make this without having to buy anything special, and that's what I like. Instead of boiling the noodles, I just soaked them in warm water while I cut up all the veggies. Also, I didn't use a half cup of soy sauce, I used just enough to darken it up and added sesame oil and hot sauce.

Mine came out REALLY salty, even after following the suggestion by some to use half the package of seasoning.  Next time I'll definetly try low sodium soy and devise a way to use less of it ... Good, quick meal otherwise.

We liked this... including my husband who doesn't usually go for anything with soy sauce.  I didn't have the sprouts or cabbage, so I substituted left-over green beans and a half of a red pepper because that's what I did have.  I actually ended up having to use two pans because there were so many veggies... so, one got made into stir-fry as directed.  The other didn't get soy sauce, I just added chicken broth and rice and now I have chicken soup for lunches!  I'm going to do it on purpose every time I make stir-fry from now on, since it doesn't take any extra time but will save time during the week!  I will probably add two packages of Ramen to the stir-fry next time, just because my girls love noodles so much!

Super easy and good! What a great dish to make on those busy evenings. I didn't have cauliflower or celery handy but everything else tasted great.  The hubby asked that I include this in our monthly recipe rotation. Thanks!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was really easy to make and tasty too. The only vegetables I used were carrots and celery but next time I want to also add in onions and bean sprouts (but you could use whatever veggies you prefer). I used teriyaki sauce instead of soya sauce. I also am going to try to find a whole wheat version of the ramen noodles to make this recipe even healthier.

I thought this was nice for a change. I didn't use the flavor packet because my family & I are allergic to MSG. The kids loved it. Leftovers were good too.

I thought this idea was a great concept, but in my personal opinion, it was just way too salty. I think if I ever try it again, I will either cut out half the soy sauce, or the seasoning packet.

Great recipe!  My whole family loved it.  I doubled the noodles and used veggies I had on hand, including baby corn and water chestnuts.

This was really very good! I omitted the cauliflowerets and celery and added red and yellow bell peppers. I also cooked the chicken with some ginger. Fast and good! Will definitely make again!

This is really easy and a very tasty meal. I added another packet of ramen noodles and an extra cup of shredded cabbage. I also used frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrot mix. I would definitely make this again and again.

This recipe was good, but I made some modifications.  Used grilled chicken, green pepper and sugar snap peas with soba noodles.

I have used different vegatables than the ones listed, and also used olive oil for cooking the chicken, but I like this recipe very much.

I've made my own variation of this recipe for a few years now, I think it's great!  Just be sure to not over cook the noodles.  I also use only half the seasoning packet or it can get pretty salty.  I love this recipe for something quick and easy when you don't really feel like cooking.

Very good!  I used two packages of the ramen noodles & cooked them in chicken broth instead of water.  Didn't use as much soy sauce, and it wasn't missed.  Thanks for this recipe!

I used 2 packages of ramen noodles, and I felt there was still too much soy sauce.  Next time I will either use teriyaki sauce or less soy.  I also made this with frozen veggies (steamed first) and it worked well.  With a few "tweaks," I'll make this again.
