Delicious!  Substituted one of the cans of cream of mushrooms with cream of chicken.  Added a couple dollops of sour cream to the mix.  Didn't bother with trying to julienne carrots, just chopped into small, somewhat flat, bits.  Peeled the zucchini and did the same thing. Also sauteed chopped 1/2 onion with it.  I don't know what fried onions are so I put a layer of crumbled potato chips on top instead which Hubby loved.  I loved all the vegetables.  I had planned to add canned mushrooms and forgot.  Definitely would have added even more to the dish.  Will also add a dash of pepper next time too -- personal taste.  Great recipe.  Will be making this often.

Was the best I've ever tried, but was a little too crumbly (not creamy) to get 5 stars.  I would add some sour cream and maybe another can of cream of something to it.  I left out the carrot but added some chopped onion to the mix.  The fried onions on top were delicious!  Oh and I will also use less than 12 oz. pasta next time.

I'm giving this a 5 IF you add the following:  1/2 onion and 3/4 c. sliced mushrooms to sauteed vegetables.  Also, add 1/2 c. reduced fat sour cream and 1/2 c. milk to the mushroom soup & tuna mixture.  This was a huge hit & the vegetables made it even better! Will definitely make again and again!  

One note:  I didn't add green & red pepper 'cuz my family doesn't like them. Also, I only had three 3 pieces of string cheese to use for the mozzarella. So I shredded those & it was fine.  For pasta I used 8 oz. noodles.  I agree with othe reviewers that 12 oz. would have been too much. Thanks to the other reviewers for the tip on adding onion and mushrooms.

Rave reviews from everyone who ate it!  I added a dided onion & celery and used 16 oz. of whole wheat pasta.  This filled an 8x8 and a 13x9 inch pan!  I covered with foil to bake then removed after 30 minutes to let the fried onions brown for about 10 minutes.  Next time I'll add some sour cream and maybe more tuna and I'll dice my carrots smaller.

This was really good for a tuna casserole! I took some reviewers' suggestions though and would recommend making these changes: add at least a cup of mushrooms, maybe only use two carrots (way too many in the end product!), 1/2 cup onion, replace one cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken, add a couple dollops of sour cream and a bit of milk when stirring the soup & tuna together.. finally, don't use an 8x8, use something longer so the casserole is thinner and there's more room for the toppings! Yummy!

I don't know that any tuna casserole is capable of 5 stars. This is a good one though.

This is a really great recipe.  With the following changes, I would give it five stars: I used 8oz of medium egg noodles.  I also diced the carrots and zucchini as someone suggested, added about a cup of fat free sour cream and about half a cup of milk (based on some of the other reviews) as well as some sliced fresh mushrooms and a chopped onion.  When sauteing the vegetables I added about a teaspoon of salt free all-purpose seasoning. I didn't have any French fried onions and used seasoned bread crumbs in stead. I think it turned out great, the color added by the vegetables makes it a winner in my book!! Will definitely make this again.

My family loved this recipe!!  The only change I made was the soup - I didn't have any Cream of Mushroom, so I used one can of Cream of Chicken, and one can of Cream of Celery.  Very good, thank you!

I cut the recipe in 1/2.  I didn't have red bell pepper, so that was omitted (though I am sure it would have been great in this dish.)  I didn't julienne the veggies, but I diced them quite small. I also used macaroni noodles, and monterey/colby blend cheese.  I did add a little milk (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup), thought it might be a little too dry otherwise.  This is a great dish, I do have to say though, that even cutting it in 1/2 it filled up an 8x8 dish for me.  Thanks for the great recipe.

When I made this I added diced onions and instead of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken with herbs. The end result had so much flavor!! My husband, who was hesitant about eating it, went for seconds and had it for lunch the next day.

Awesome! Did add 1/2 cup half/half for more moisture. Shredded the zucchini and carrots. Reduced pasta to 8 oz, as recommended. For the the reviewers that substituted this to death, I highly recommend making without omitting all the veggies, otherwise you may as well make tuna helper!

You should change the name to "Vegetable Casserole".  There were too many for me personally; I would suggest eyeballing the amount while cutting, so you can adjust it to your liking.

I only gave this 4 stars because, honestly, who loves tuna casserole??  Not me.  But this was a good improvement on the original.  I of course only used the veggies I had on hand ~ frozen peas (run under the faucet to defrost a bit) and fresh carrots.  I used 3 cans of tuna and a one pound package of pasta, keeping it at 2 cans of soup and topping with cheddar cheese only.  It was a winner for all -- even if it WAS tuna casserole!! :)

Without a doubt the best tuna casserole ever! (And I've eaten alot of tuna casseroles)  Other than omitting the bell pepper, (which hubby won't eat)I made the recipe as written.  Delicious!

This recipe was quick and easy. I had to substitue some of the veg and even used frozen veg. I left the veg chunky and added some sour cream and some milk to rinse out the soup can. Even my husband like this - he is not a fan of tuna dishes generally.

I used this recipe for a base but used mixed frozen veggies instead of carrots and zucchini. It's easier. I also mixed mozz cheese and cheder cheese. I added 2 cans soup and it came out perfect. Not too dry. Made it for youth group and kids loved it. O

This was okay.  I believe tuna casserole is only made out of desperation when you are pretty much out of groceries, which is why I made it.  It was nice with the veggies but still kind of blah.

I added green peas instead of zucchini and used cheddar instead of mozzarella. I also added a little red onion. It was delicious and I would make it again. Great one dish casserole.

Really good!  I added canned mushrooms & used 1 can of cream of chicken along with 1 can of cream of mushroom, left out the zuccini.  Also put it in a larger dish so there would be more toppings.  My kids all liked it-especially the carrots.

My family thought is was a good meal. The only thing I did different was use a little garlic powder instead of two garlic cloves. Thought is was very good. Ps also lest out zucchini, yuk.

Great recipe, it makes a lot, you need a larger pan.  I added sour cream, milk and water, just enough water to wash out the soup cans.  It turned out great. I put bread crumbs with herb spice instead of the onions on top, as I don't like onions.  I will make again.

I love this tuna casserole. Very simple and tasty. Huge amount of calories for even one serving of this dish....I have made this several times, but it's usually on one of my splurge days

SO GOOD. My whole family loved it. I added a couple dollops of sour cream, half a cup of milk, and some ground pepper to the soup mixture, and also added some lawrys seasoning salt while frying up the veggies. I also used three cans of tuna. It makes a lot and the leftovers were still great and all got eaten up!

Good!  I used leftover turkey (didn't have any tuna) and a blend of cheeses (didn't have mozzarella), chopped the zucchini and shredded the carrots...very filling meal with good flavor.

This recipe was easy to follow, even for a neophyte like me and super yummy!  I added corn to it for extra flavor.

I used whole wheat egg noodles and I only used about 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount  called for.  I used cheddar cheese instead of mozerella.  It was very delicious, I liked it with all of the vegetables.
