My family LOVED this!  We all thought the rosemary was a wonderful flavor with the cranberry. I made a few changes though... Instead of grilling the chicken I browned it first, poured the sauce over and then baked it.  I served it with whole wheat couscous and poured the sauce over everything.  TASTY!

Absolutely delicious. I heated the sauce ingredients on the stove so they would blend. I couldn't get them to blend well otherwise. My kids loved it. (3 yrs and 2 yrs)

I don't have a grill so what I did was brown the chicken on the stove, doubled all the sauce ingredients except the corn syrup, and once the chicken was browned I poured the sauce into the pan and let the chicken finish cooking in the sauce. After the chicken was cooked I took it out and set it aside, let the sauce reduce slightly, and served it over the chicken. Everyone loved it. I didn't have to beg my 6 year old to eat! He devoured it!

Wow, I was stunned that this was sooo yummy! I did not use the corn syrup, I didnt have any, so I put a splash of molasses instead. It worked fine!

I make this in the oven rather than on the grill and it turns out great.  To the sauce, I add parsley and then pour it over the chicken on a baking sheet.  I bake it for about 25 minutes at 425 and it turns out wonderfully.  (Time may vary.  I usually start checking it around 25 minutes)

This sause is a great base recipe that is easily modified to fit a variety of uses and tastes. Instead of using the cranberry as a glaze for grilling here is what I did and it turned out great.  My hubby thinks this is a keeper.
-Sauce, combined all the ingredients in a microwave safe dish and microwaved for 3 min to blend the flavors.
-Chicken, browned bonelss-skinless breasts in skillet. 
-Cover chicken with the sauce and bake at 350 for 30 min.

To make it more Diabetic Friendly - I use no additional Sugars.  I put the cranberry sauce directly onto the Chicken with my Papa John's Spice.  I wait until the chicken is almost done and pour the sauce over the chicken so it does not burn.  I have sometimes done it just before serving.  This is a fantastic recipe also for pork loin or chops. (my private Recipe available to those interested.)

This recipe was very good.  I gave it four stars (it's hard to get 5 from me).  I did make a couple of changes that I liked:  I added parsley, sage, and thyme to the recipe, and shortly before finishing grilling, I tossed the marinade into a saucepan and added a little cornstarch with water as a thickening agent, and brought it to a boil for three minutes.  I then poured this over the top of the chicken.  This worked very well.

I can't believe how long this solid recipe has been waiting for a picture! The lemon is a good balance to the sweet cranberry sauce.  I grilled indirect on a gas grill.  I would, in the future, marinate the chicken in a cranberry vinaigrette.  I use bone in, skin on thighs.  They worked out perfectly!

This chicken was delicious!!! I did it exactly the way the recipe mentioned step by step without any subtitutions. I decided to try a new way of preparing chicken and this was good. All of the ingredients went well together. I did not have a grill available, so instead I grilled chicken in a shallow pan and used the stovetop. It still came out just fine. I liked the texture of the chicken after it was done. I saw no need to constantly baste chicken, but I keep turning chicken every 3-4 minutes and  poured more sauce over chicken about 5 minutes prior to doneness. The type of chicken I used were chicken legs to prepare this recipe. Great recipe and I will be preparing this again!!

Very good flavor.  I had to use fresh rosemary and I didn't know how much to put in to equal the dried...I used one Tbsp.

I used whole berry canned cranberry on drumsticks.  It was good even though it was done in the oven.  I'm sure grilling it would have improved the results.

Best looking and tasting chicken I have ever cooked.  I heated the sauce ingredients on the stove as suggested, brown the chicken, then pour the souce onto the chicken and cooked the chicken in the sauce.  I then transfer chicken pieces on a cookie sheet and baked ~ 10 min in 375 degree oven.  Remove, pour reduced sauce over the chicken before serving.  My familiy loved the dish.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

My family loved this recipe!!  I didn't feel like grilling so I browned my chicken in a pan first and poured the sauce over them in a baking dish and baked at 400 for about 28 min.  Next time I might bake at 425 for more crunch.  Yum Yum!!  Can't wait for the leftovers.

I spatchcocked a whole Smart Chicken and cooked it on my drum smoker with apple wood for smoke. I set my GURU temperature controller for 325° and once it got the smoker up to temp. I put the chicken on skin side down and basted with the sauce. After 30 minutes I turned the chicken skin side up and basted that side. I basted it three times before it was done. Pulled it off the smoker and let it rest 20 minutes before cutting. MOST FINE!!!

It looked really good,but I did not use the corn syrup, because I live in the usa and most all our corn is now GMO, so i made a simple syrup instead with organic raw sugar and water and it worked great, kept the cranberry sauce on the chicken and sweetened it.

Surprisingly good.  We're not huge cranberry fans but this was delicious.  Kids ate all their chicken which made me happy!  My husbands wasn't up for grilling so I used the George Foreman and it worked well enough.  I'm sure the grill would have been better.  I kept the sauce the same but I only had half the amount of chicken.  I liked having the extra sauce though to serve on the side.  Warning: use the small can of cranberry of half a can or regular.  I thought I was cutting the sauce in half but then realized the can was not the same as called for in recipe.  Still great flavor!

I added jalepeno to this recipe.  Gives cranberry a little kick.  Add amount equal to your desired kick.

Delicious!  I actually used this recipe as a sauce for a roasted chicken I picked up at the grocery. After tasting, I added more rosemary, a little sage and a little tyme.  Next time i will add a little jalepano. It was a little thick and lumpy from the cranberry sauce so i blended it to make it smoother. My guests loved it.  It's so easy and I will definately make again. Even my husband loved it and he does not eat cranberries!

The recipe was great! The flavor was suttle to me and I'll make again. It will totally be on the grilling rotation. Plan on doing this with plain chicken breast and trying whole cranberry sauce next time to see which way is better...thank you though ;-)
