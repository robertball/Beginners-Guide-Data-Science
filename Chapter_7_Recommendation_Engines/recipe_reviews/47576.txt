I loved this quick/easy/delicious recipe & fwd'd it to all my friends; you can tone down the hotness or use red pepper powder instead & to make it more elegant, for a thai dinner party, use rice noodles not pasta, serve with a bowl of crushed peanuts for topping, and garnish the plates with lime wedges & a flower blossom.

This was tasty.  I couldn't find whole dried red peppers so I used crushed instead.  This is a very simple meal - not fancy enough to serve to guests, but just fine for a busy weeknight.

I found this recipe bland. It needed more sauce and more spice! I will not make it again

I made this for my family tonight and it was just okay.  The flavor wasn't bad but just a little too mild.  My kids ate it but it won't go into my favorites file.

Good recipe but to make it five stars, add chopped basil and mint right before servine. I needed mored than one dried chili. Needed a bit more sauce so I added a cornstarch/water/soy sauce mixture to better coat the pasta. Excellent and would be good for a casual dinner party. Thanks for sharing!

This was rather bland,  I tried to add some spice with red pepper sauce so it wasn't terrible.  My husband said that we can do better, so we probably won't make this again :-(

I thought this was very spicy but not very flavorful, but my boyfriend, who likes very spicy foods, really loved it.  I would make this again, but maybe try adding some vegetables to give it some flavor.  I served it with Oriental Green Bean Salad (from this site) which was a nice complement to this dish.

Awesome simple pasta dish. I've found that I just read what the recipe calls for ingredient wise and do it all "to taste." It makes me sad when people say a recipe is bad because they can't adapt. If it's not spicy/salty/whatever enough just add more! Once you learn to do this you can make anything taste awesome no matter who wrote the recipe down. :)

This was very good with a few slight modifications to ingredient amounts.  I was looking for a recipe to use what I had on hand and this recipe fit the bill for most of the ingredients.  First, as I didn't have dried red chili peppers, I used about 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper.  As I like a medium spice level I could have used more crushed red pepper.  I also used ground ginger instead of fresh since I didn't have any fresh.   Lastly I tripled the amounts of the soy sauce, lemon juice, and white wine and probably should have increased it more.   I served it with diced red, yellow, and green bell peppers and whole wheat shell pasta.  Next time I want to try it with the dried red chili peppers and the fresh ginger as I think that would make it better.  However, 1/2 tsp grated FRESH ginger is a very small amount.  Next time I would probably triple that amount as well and quadruple the amounts of the soy sauce, lemon juice, and white wine.
