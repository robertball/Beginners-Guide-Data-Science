I made this last night and it turned out delicious. I didn't add the pepper because thought would be spicy and didn't have any. Will be doing this again. It was different to have fried turkey wings instead of baking them. Thanks for recipe.

These were a big hit with everyone. Didn't have any cayenne so I substituted some Frank's hot wing sauce and they turned out great. Let them marinate overnight and cooked them the next day. Have had requests to make them again already.

I decided to try this recipe and it was great. I tweaked it a bit because the skin was pretty brown but tough after frying. After frying all the wings I placed them in a baking pan and added my favorite sauce to them (homemade jerk sauce) and baked on 300 for about 30 minutes or so until skin was fork tender. The Bomb!!! Most of all this recipe gave me some ideas for the next time I try this.

this recipe is great but one thing I wonder if it will help....after frying the turkey's the skin is very tough. I wonder if I peel the skin off before frying it will it be easier to dig in? lol.....but over all it great thnx...

I always marinate white meat in Buttermilk overnight dry off then cook in oven 400 for an hour. This will give you a tender and crispy turkey wing. You can add bbq sauce when it's almost done as well.

I baked them, as I didn’t want to add extra oil, then broiled them the last 5 mins.

Fried them in peanut oil then put them in the oven for about 10-15 minutes at 250 after frying. This softened the meat and it was still deep fried moist.

Great recipe! I usually try to stay away from fried foods but this was well worth cheating. Followed the recipe as is and they turned out really good. Packed with flavor and super moist. Will definitely be making these again sometime.
