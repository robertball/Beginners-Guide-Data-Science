I have made menudo for many years and, after reading the comments, have some 'hints' to offer.  Yes, the tripe smells awful when cooking and one thing that helps a lot is adding 6-8 cloves of garlic and a lemon (cut in half and the juice squeezed in) in step one.  The garlic cooks and doesn't add a strong garlic flavor.  In step two, I would add broth in place of water and some cubed, sauted pork. This adds the hearty flavor that is missing when only tripe and water are used.  I also use pureed New Mexico red chili, adjust to your taste. I hope you enjoy my tried and true 'hints'.

This is an excellent Menudo recipe. I added two pork feet and some bone marrow in step no. 2, making a richer broth. Also, I bought whole tripe and washed it first in several exchanges of cold water, then rubbed in the juice of two whole limes and about two teaspoons of Kosher salt, washed it again and sliced. I did this only because this is how I learned to prepare the tripe.

this is a delicious recipe, no question. however, there is no reason at all why it should take 8 hours. once i knew the tripe was clean and tender (about 2 hours preparation), the soup was done in another two hours. the chiles used in this recipe are produce a spicy flavor, and i used one less arbol.

For those who do not like the smell of menudo . I soak it in 1/4 cup of distilled white vinegar and cold water soak for 3 hrs and rinse and continue cooking. Been cooking this for 33 yrs. this way no smells .

After reading the reviews, I was excited to try this new recipe.  However, I was very disappointed with the results.  It came out way too spicy, (& i love spicy food) so I had to drain some of the water and I blended up some dried Guajillo chiles I had on hand to give it some additional flavor and color since the color wasn't the true aunthentic version I'm familiar with.  It was very watered down.  My family enjoyed it, but my husband (who raves about my cooking) didn't care for it at all.  He said he prefers and loves the way I originally make it because it's tastier and has a more richer and redder color to the juice.  I use a combination of chile California, New Mexico and Guajillo in my own recipe.  I think I'm gonna stick to my own version afterall.

This was great!!!!  I followed the recipe to a T the only thing I can say is that it came out really spicy.  The peppers I used were kinda big so next time I'm gona cut down on the peppers.  I served some to my neighbors who are from Mexico and and they love it but they thought it was a little to spicy also.  I will definitly make this again.

One of the best tasting menudo I've had. I followed this recipe to make menudo for the first time. Everyone loved it!! My husband doesn't like to eat leftovers but he ate this for three days straight. Most of our guest were impressed on how flavorful it was.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  I will definately save this and make it again.  It's takes a long time to prepare but since everyone loved  it ---it was worth it!

I make menudo and the pigs feet were not in your recipe.  The tripe that we use is the honeycomb cost a little more but is more tasty and tender. Also have the butcher cut the pigs feet two or three of them into 4 pieces. Pigs feet add to the flavor. I use the powder chili. California Chili cause the New Mexico is too hot spicy. Also add "menudo Mix" it has all the spices you need in it sold in the Mexican spice section to the menudo then you only need to add salt and the red chili powder all our relatives always ask me to make menudo when they are coming to visit....you will love it!

Wonderful recipe! I sliced the honeycomb tripe in 1/4 x 1 inch slices after parboiling tripe in salted water for 2 hours. Used the slow cooker to pull it together. This is a keeper! Very dubious DH & friends were amazed at how unbelievably tasty. Served with fresh chopped onion, cilantro, mint & jalapeno peppers - most delicious!

In case you don't already know, the tripe really stinks up the house when you cook it initially so a good idea to do that step outside far, far away.  My wardrobe smells like tripe now. Very good recipe though. Yum!

I COOKED MINE DIFFERENTLY, I CLEANED THE TRIPE WITH WATER & VINEGAR OVERNIGHT (HELPS ELIMINATE SMELL). 
NEXT, PLACED PATA DE PUERCO(FOOT)IN POT & SUBMERGE FOOT WITH WATER, HALF AN ONION & 1 GARLIC HEAD, DOESN'T NEED TOO MUCH WATER BECAUSE IT WILL LOOSE FLAVOR. COOKED FOOT FOR 1 1/2HR OR UNTIL FOOT IS TENDER.
NEXT, ADDED TRIPE AND COOKED FOR 1HR UNTIL TRIPE IS SOFT. ONCE TRIPE WAS COOKED I ADDED THE HOMINY.
AFTER ADDING HOMINY I USED 4 CHILES GUAJILLO AND 4 CALIFORNIA REMOVED SEEDS AND SUBMERGED IN BOILING WATER UNTIL SOFTENED, THEN PLACED IN BLENDER WITH A LITTLE WATER AND ADDED TO POT WITH TRIPE AND HOMINY. COOKED FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES AND FINITO! GARNISHED WITH CILANTRO, ONION, RADISH AND LIME JUICE.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I give it only 4 stars because it is too spicy (I am NO wimp) and it is not as rich a broth as I am used to nor as red as I like.  I incorporated the preparing the tripe hint given by reviewer "MAJORGSP"....using lime and kosher salt.  I would love to try the pork feet and bone marrow idea but I have no idea how to even find bone marrow.  I assume I just buy pig feet but would like to know what to do with them....when to add, do they fall apart and incorporate or do you pull them out?  I did find it too spicy...and I am NO wimp. I would love more red color so I don't know what to add or what peppers to lessen in order to tone down the spice.  Any help would be appreciated.

It was okay but too spicy for menudo... i will keep my original recipe using chile guajillo. As for the people who had questions about the feet i have always been taught to cook in a seperate pan when you start the menudo since it takes a little but longer to cook through and produces a lot of grease so its easier to mix them together once they have cooked through

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made this a few times as the recipe reads (less some of the pepper) & now my family wants it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every other day.  It seems I can never make enough because they devour it no matter how much I double even triple the recipe.  I made an experimental batch for dinner tonight putting my own twist on it and suprisingly it turned out AWESOME!!! I added 2 lbs hog maws, 6 slices of bacon, 4 medium potatoes (cut into 4's), and 6 pig tails.  I let it cook on the stove for two hours (minus the potatoes and bacon). I let it cook down and then added my second gallon of water letting it cook for an additional hour.  I then transfered everything to the crock pot (adding potatoes and bacon) and let it slow cook for an additional 4 hours (didn't even need the third gallon of water).  WOW....I know this goes against what menudo may be, but try it.  You will be suprised how flavorful and meaty this turns out to be.  I hit a home run with my family and neighbors making it this way.  Happy eating....

our family always uses chile ancho, we split them open, remove the seeds and veins then soak them in boiling water for about an hour to make the skins easier to remove before we blend them with the garlic and spices.  all the skin does not come off just to let you know. then we add them to the soup to finish cooking with the meat.  we also use beef feet and legs. makes for a great broth.  just boil them with the second water.

When i first read this recipe I thought they had accidentally put tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the spices, but i followed it exactly. After tasting, and reading the coments about how hot it is, I am convinced. I mean, 1 1/2 TBL salt? The nutritional info says that is 73% of the daily requirement in each serving. I use way too much salt, and I use pepper flakes or Tabasco on everything I eat, and my first impression was this was too salty and too hot. The recipe seems solid, but next time I will substitute teaspoons and adjust upwards if neccessary.

I tried this recipe yesterday and I DID cook the tripe in the pressure cooker for 4o minutes. I cooked the pigs trotters in another pressure cooker for 15 minutes. Turned out beautifully and eliminated hours of cooking. I borrowed from another reviewer and rubbed the tripe with kosher salt and the juice of two limes and let it sit for a few hours. I rinsed it prior to cooking.
I used dried California chili's that I soaked in hot water and scraped the flesh from the skins. They were absolutely devoid of heat. So I used 4 tablespoons of red pepper. I did not use the jalapenos. This dish turned out wonderfully well. It's time consuming - but I'll make it again.

It is way easier to make a puree instead of finely blending peppers into a powder. Also, de arbol chiles are too spicy for an all around soup. California or New Mexico chiles are best suited for Menudo.

I really liked this recipe. I'm posting this review to answer the question about the "redness" of the broth. Most people I know that make menudo use a can of "el pato" brand tomato sauce or salsa de chili fresca. This has chilis and salt in it. So you may want to adjust your salt and chilis if you're one of these people saying this recipe it "too hot." hope this helps!

I've made menudo before that came out way too hot. This time, I'm following this recipe with the powder spice mix, no jalapeno peppers but California peppers. I'm not adding any sodium but I am adding pig's feet for the flavor. And to infuse the flavors into the meat, this will cook all day, with the spices in the first addition of items.

i prefer lemon with mine. and i have found that this is not an inexpensive dish. tripe is not cheap. i like a lot of tripe in mine and I put ten pounds in my personal recipe. but i do not measure, i just add to taste after the tripe has cooked for a few hours.

A couple things can be changed after this experience. First, don't drain the broth!!! Scoop out the unhealthy fat but the broth is what gives menudo it's distinct flavor. You would drain your chicken broth from your chicken soup! It's the same concept with menudo. Second, it came out very spicy, I'd say cut the japonese and arbol peppers by one each. I added a teaspoon of cumin and about 3 more table spoons of salt for flavor.

Great recipe for the exception of the measurements for the black pepper. I thought 1 1/2 tablespoon was way too much, and cut it back to 1 teaspoon, and still that made it spicy. When I make it again, I'll use only 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, if that. I also used 4 New Mexico red peppers, and the broth vs. water in step 2.  For step 1, I cooked the tripe with all the garlic and lemon, and added more garlic when I got to the broth stage. While I grew up with the smell of menudo cooking in the house, it's probably not the lost desirable scent, so I recommend cooking it outside if possible.

I have to agree with other people on this--it was too spicy for me. I couldn't even finish my bowl. My husband loved it, though.

This was very good. My husband cooked the tripe outdoors so we didn't get the smell in the house. This is truly a make again.

The first time I made this recipe, I had never made or eaten menudo before. It turned out very spicy but my mexican husband and his mexican friends all loved it! I liked the soup broth but I personally didn't like the texture of the tripe in my mouth. Today Im switching up the recipe and adding 2 pigs feet & a 1/2 lb of bones with marrow and wanting to give this another try, its starting to cool down here in Utah so I thought Id surprise my husband again when he gets off of work. I love this soup!

I love this recioe.  This was my first time to make menudo and it was super easy!   But I have to admit,  I  did a lot of tweaking to it because we just like certain things a certain way.  I washed the tripe really well and then soaked it in a bowl with salt and vinegar (about 15min) before boiling it.   For the next pot, I am going to let it soak for at least an hour or so before cooking.   

I  also 1/2 the water and added beef stock, beef shank, doubled the garlic (because we like our garlic), and added an extra Tbs of the red chili powder because we also like a little heat to it.    

The other thing I am going to do for the next pot of menudo is add more of the beef and tripe and cut back on the hominy just because I don't like hominy that much.   But the amount suggested in the recipe is spot on to what you would normally get in a restaurant.   

The other thing is what one other reviewer stated: this should not take 8 hours to make.  Maybe 8 hrs in a crockpot but definitely not stove top.   Speaking of which,  I did finished cooking this in a crockpot.   Next time,  I will be cooking must of it in a crockpot.   Word to the wise: since I have never cooked with tripe before,  I didn't realize it smelled SO BAD!!!  Be sure to ventilate well.  Next time I am going to cook the tripe outside first.   

But overall,  it was delicious and we are super pleased with the results.   Can't wait to make another pot.

I prefer more gelatin in my menudo so I would skip draining the liquid and adding fresh water. The recipe is a good one though.

Make it all the time.  I only add tomatoe sauce 14oz can or two.  Depending on size and change out the tripe for chicken, pork or beef.  Very good spices as is.

I have never eaten nor made Menudo before, but this was delicious! I only added 1 T. red pepper flakes, and 4 Hungarian Hot wax peppers that I broiled until blistered. I also used 2 Qts. of chicken stock in the 2nd step, rather than water. I will definitely make this again!

Very bland and too spicy! Added 1 additional tsp salt; just enough. My family asked to cut chili in half, double meat and double hominy. They said it was to soupy. I actually like spice so didn't mind that. But, it could use more meat and hominy. Could definitely cut cook time down. I'll try making it again.
