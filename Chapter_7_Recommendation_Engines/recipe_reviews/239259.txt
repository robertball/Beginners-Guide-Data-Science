Made this recipe exactly as written and wouldnâ€™t change a thing.  I had it for lunch yesterday, but I think this would make an outstanding dinner salad with grilled shrimp.  The pomegranate-cranberry dressing is sensational, and I think toasted pecans sprinkled over the top would be a nice addition.  Enjoyed, very good recipe.

Excellent! This Spinach Salad was tart, sweet and savory.  I did use 7-Up to prevent the apples from turning brown. I also used my salad spinner to rinse the spinach. Due to the fact my family likes different amounts of dressing on their salad, I served the dressing on the side. Therefore, I had a lot of dressing left over. I will definitely make this salad again. Thanks, Mazola for the great recipe!

Delicious! There's something about making your own dressing that makes you feel like a good cook??  The whole family really liked this salad- will definitely make it again.

Loved this salad!  The dressing was easy to make, so flavorful, and I didn't have to use a lot of it on the salad, which is great since dressings tend to be calorie heavy.  I used a clean recycled glass dressing bottle to store the leftover dressing in the fridge.  I did substitute extra virgin olive oil for the Mazola because I didn't have vegetable oil on hand.  It came out great!

Really tasty salad. I absolutely love pomegranate anything and this was no different. It's a very versatile recipe that is a perfect dish for Fall. Next time I'll try it using goat cheese instead of feta, and dried cherries instead of cranberries. This would also be good with pomegranate seeds sprinkled over top, or toasted pine nuts.

A delicious and healthy salad, and the dressing was very good, too. I subbed blue cheese for the feta and also added some sweet and spicy pecans that I had on hand.

Delicious salad. I used freshly prepared pomegranate juice, olive oil, regular vinegar and had to sub asiago cheese for feta cheese. Also I added some sunflower seeds but walnuts,  pecans or pine nuts would be great too.

This recipe doubled was a big hit at a holiday party/potluck for 17 people.   I added candied walnuts, which gave a needed crunch.  I would have added finely sliced red onion as well, but I knew that one diner was allergic, so left that out.  I do think it would complement the other ingredients.

The dressing is wonderful---but be sure to use a blender that won't leak.  I learned the hard way that my food processor was the wrong gadget for this task!
