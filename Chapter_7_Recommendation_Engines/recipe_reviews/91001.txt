I made this tonight for supper. it was very good, even made with frozen broccoli (I cooked in it the boiling water for about 3 minutes)

I added the cooked broccoli to the pan with the cooked chicken, onion and garlic and set it off the heat while the pasta is cooking.
This kept the broccoli nice and crisp the way I like it.
          
The reserved water helped the grated cheese melt into a sauce. It semed to be needed.   
I used more grated cheese than was called for in the recipe and I used a Parmesan/Romano mix (what I had on hand).Next time I will add more onions. 
This was quick and tasty (and healthy to boot) and I usually will have all  the ingredients on hand.

I thought this was quite good, but I don't think the extra cup of water is needed.  I preferred it without, since there was not much to make that water into "sauce"...so you just had watery pasta!

I finally got a chance to try out this recipe and we absolutely loved it.  My son actually asked for seconds.  I too omitted the extra water from my recipe and it came out just fine.  I cooked my broccoli in salted water and then removed it, cooked the pasta in the same water and then mixed the pasta, broccoli and cooked chicken together (I wanted to keep my broccoli firm).  It came out great.  I have enough left over for tonights dinner and maybe even for tomorrows lunch.  I am already thinking about substituting shrimp for the chicken next time to mix it up.  This is definitely a keeper.

I really liked this one a lot.  I agree with the prior reviewers, too much pasta.  I used about 3/4 of what was in the recipe, but in the future will cut it in half.  I grilled the chicken then put it in right at the end.  I had grilled some asparagus to have on the side, but will probably add it to the pot in the future.  It was a good addition. I had some the next day cold, and that was good as well.

This recipe is amazing. It's delicious just the way it is--I won't even cook it without the recipe, because I don't want it to change. We first made this dinner to celebrate our first anniversary, and we have made it every anniversary since! Five stars.

If you like a sauce this is not for you. it was a very light garlic flavor that i really enjoyed. i added a little extra cheese. after boiling the broccoli and then sauteing it in the pan it just fell apart on me. so you may want to undercook it a little so it will hold up later.

We liked it well enough but next time I will double the amount of chicken and use only 3/4# of the pasta.

My fussy 14 year old daughter even loved this. Only change: more garlic. It gets lost when you mix it with the penne. I used 6 cloves. 8+ would suit it better. But GREAT. My whole family says this is a keeper

Great recipe!! Simple and tasty. I didn't let the repeated instructions stop me from trying this recipe, I winged it based on previous experience. A few changes I made to bump up the flavor: 1)I grilled my chicken verses sauteeing; 2) reduced the oil to 1 Tablespoon; 3)used about 1/3 cup of the water and 4)increased the Romano cheese to 4 Tablespoons.

I was very dissappoined with this recipe. It smelled so good as it was cooking and we LOVE garlic. When it was finished, it was so bland. There was no sauce of any kind with it. I had to throw in a can of cream of mushroom soup, just so my guys would eat it.

This recipe sounds great but it is bland bland bland.  I have tried to add red pepper flakes, sour cream etc etc.  It is just a very very bland recipe.  I will not be making it again.  The only thing I can think of is do not do the olive oil, onion, garlic but make a cheese sauce.  Trust me this is bland.

I thought it was ok but needed more of a sauce it was a bit dry to me.  Also wish it came with some serving suggestions for sides and things.  It did  have good flavor though and wasn't overpowered by the garlic.

Like others this was a little bland but it is a nice healthy meal - I used shrimp instead of chicken and the kids said they liked it. Maybe next time some more garlic I used 5 and that just wasn't enough !

My husband, toddler son, and I loved this recipe when changed to our liking.  Based on the previous reviews, I did the following: added 1/4 cup olive oil and 1 tsp Italian seasoning to the sauce.  I used approximately 2/3 of the 16 oz box of pasta.  I added somewhere between 10 and 12 cloves of garlic (I lost count).  I also used 3 oz. of cheese, which gave it a great flavor.  Oh yes, and I only used about a 1/4 cup of the additional water that is called for.  The day I made this, I was REALLY craving garlic, and with the additional garlic, this hit the spot--garlic lovers take note!  I think the recipe as printed would taste a little bland, as some reviewers have stated.

Simple to make and the kids just ate it up.  Kept it plain for them and added a bit of crushed red pepper to mine to give it a bit more kick.

We found this to be a tasty one. I like my broccoli tender, but not mushy so I cooked it for a few min. more. I only used one half cup of the pasta cooking water for the sauce. But then doubled the cheese. My family did not request it in the weekly rotation, but it will come up on the monthly menu.

Thumbs Up..they cleaned out the pasta bowl on this one!  I did add chicken boullion to the water, plus more garlic...thickend the sauce a bit with a little cornstarch.  Will make again.

Made this last evening for my husband and myself.  I cut recipe in half and still had lots left over. The recipe was okay, but I felt something was missing.  I added more onion and seasoning which helped.  I had another plate today for lunch and felt it was better today than when it was first made.  Simply reheated a plate in the microwave.  Maybe this needs to be made ahead sor the flavors can blend.

Very good! only suggestion is: when you are stirring everything together in (pasta with the chicken) add 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 tbsp of butter. I also added a tsp of "Italian Seasoning" and a little more salt. And either cut down on the pasta by 4oz or double-up on the chicken. Very good recipe, fed all "the girls"....

Won't be doing this again.  We like flavor & spice, which this had neither. We added more garlic & cheese like others suggested, but it really didn't do much.  If you like plain, fast food then this is for you.
