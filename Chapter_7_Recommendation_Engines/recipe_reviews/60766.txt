This was good, but it kind of separated out on me a little, due to the long simmering time after the addition of the flour.  If I were to do it again, I would just add the flour and broth to the veggies, let that cook until the taters were tender, and then add the milk and let it thicken up.  When I first added the milk, it had a beautiful texture, but broke up with all the simmering.  I simmered at a low temp too.  I used one Yukon Gold and one red potato.  I used a mix of skim milk and fat-free evaporated milk, and added a bit of both extra milk and broth.  Omitted the wine.  I cut the cheese down to 1 cup.  It was very rich and creamy, even with the skim milk.  Served with focaccia bread.

I read through the reviews before I made this soup, finding WhatADish's review quite helpful so I made one minor change regarding the milk. I didn't add it until right before I took it off the heat, right after I added the cheese. I also did not add a whole cup and cup and a half. I used about a quarter cup or so, just to give it a touch of creaminess. Next time I make this, I'd use different spices, I think. I just wasn't a fan of the spices in this soup, but that's really just personal preferance. I think I'd add chunked ham, too. Oh! When I sauteed the onion, I also added a mess of fresh minced garlic.

This was a wonderful recipe.  It smelled so wonderful.  I did make a few changes in it though as I made it.  I used about 1/2 cup wine.  I added 1/4 tsp cracked red pepper.  I also used I stalk of green onion instead of chives.  I made this with a friend and we finished it the same night.  I hope you enjoy making this as well as eating it.

Very delicious!  I made a couple of adjustments - I toasted some minced garlic and added to the mixture while it was simmering.  I also cut down the amount of cheese.  I thought the full amount would overwhelm the other flavors of the soup.  I will definitely make this again - maybe add some bacon next time.

Thanks for the tip about it separating! I also waited to add the milk until close to the end. I did add a little more chicken stock (about 1/2 cup more) after the flour to make up for the lack of milk, otherwise the liquid would have been too thick. When you do add the milk be sure to first whisk some of the hot liquid into it, so you're not adding cold milk to the pot (as that can also cause separation).

Very good.  Followed recipe exactly with the exception of not adding the wine because I didn't have any.  Plus I used dried chives and parsley because that's all I had in the house.

I had this last night at a little get together and it was a hit! I added bacon and used the bacon fat instead of the butter to saute the onions and potato's. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very warm and comforting.  I halved the cumin and put in 1/2 tsp basil instead of the sage (didn't have any)  I also used green onion instead of chives.  It came out lovely.  I didn't have any seperation problems and simmered it a long time.

Perfect for a snowy winter evening. Only thing I substituted the tops of green onions for chives (since that is what I had). Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! So hearty and comforting. The only changes I made were to omit the parsley - don't like it - and I used a little more cheese. Also, it took less than 30 mins for the potatoes to cook. Thanks!

I used vegetable stock and I didn't have any chives or wine so I had to leave them out. I only simmered this for about 20 minutes as the potatoes were done by then. My daughter and I really enjoyed this and it's on my make again list. Many thanks.

Great recipe!  So delicious!  I followed the recipe nearly exactly, just omitting the chives and parsley because I didn't have any.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was just ok to me.  I feel like the seasonings are a bit off or maybe it's missing something.  I'm just not sure what.  It's a decent recipe, but I think it needs a bit of tweaking.

So GOOD!  I used frozen hash brown potatoes so I only did about 10 minutes instead of the 30 minutes.  I did use fresh corn kernals off the cob though.  Delicious and great thickness!

This was delicious!  Will make it again.  I used oil instead of butter.  And I left out the sage, chives, and wine - just because I didn't have them on hand.  It was still a big hit, but I will add those ingredients next time; we like big flavor.

LOVED THIS SOUP! I doubled everything, except the cheese (I used Velveeta(R), because it melts better for me), cumin and sage, which I kept the same. I did not have dried sage on hand, so I used poultry seasoning. I ended up simmering the potatoes in the chicken broth and wine only, until tender and then adding in the milk to prevent curdleing, and allowed that to heat through before continuing with the recipe, which worked out perfectly. I am a salt fanatic, lol, but felt that the finished soup was seasoned perfectly and didn't need any, but I did add pepper. This was so easy to make and super flavorful...this is definately going into our rotation! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was soooo delicious!  But I made some adjustments: I used olive oil instead of butter, veggie stock instead of chicken and omitted the bay leaf, cumin, sage, chives (I didn't have these).  Because I'm always trying to get my man-friend to eat more veggies, I also added 3 celery hearts and 10 baby carrots along with the potato.  I felt as though there might not be enough broth, so I adjusted the portions of flour/water/milk.  This let me use more corn (I used a full 16 oz bag).  I also decided to add half a bunch of fresh chopped flat-leaf parsley.  I only added about 1 cup of cheese, and that was perfect.  Because I'm a boozehound, I also upped the wine to 1/3 cup.  One tip:  If you coat the veggies with the flour and add the milk/stock SLOWLY, there will not be a need to whisk (yay!).   Definitely a keeper.  Thank you!!

This is so good!!! I added about 1/2 cup of wine but didn't have the parsley or chives so I added some dried oregano and a little basil instead. Also, added some minced garlic to the onion and potato mixture as well as some grond white pepper. YUMMY! This is a great, interesting recipe....definitely a keeper!

Nothing wrong with this chowder, though it isn't one we could eat often, maybe once or twice a winter. It is very filling, with an unusual but pleasing  blend of flavors, and my husband liked it even more than I did.

This was delicious, and very simple to make. The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Next time, I would use fresh sage, added with the onions, and add w little cayenne or hot sauce. Not very much, but just to give it a little hint of heat. Thanks!

Turned out great! I didn't have any parsley but added about a cup of chopped cauliflower and 3 strips of cooked bacon. yum! I didn't have to simmer it more than 20 minutes myself, but that may be only because I liked the potato cut small.

Pretty good.  Corn chowders can be boring so it's always nice to find a good one.  I think the cheese kinda makes it.  It didn't make as much as I'd hoped - I feel it's only 6 servings if used as an appetizer, but it's maybe 3 bowls.

Cumin!  What a great idea.  My girls love potato soup and I was afraid adding cumin and sage would turn them off but they said "Awesome 10 Stars"   I used homemade veggie stock, red potatoes, and frozen mixed veggies for the corn.

The sage and cumin put a different spin on this, making it taste a lot different than other chowders with similar ingredients.

Followed recipe exactly, except did not put the full amount of cheese (probably little over 1 cup used) as we didn't feel it was needed after tasting. Very flavorful and my whole family loved it!  Will definitely make again.

This was really good.  Very fresh tasting and I loved how easy it was too make.  My only complaint was that I wish it had made more as there weren't any leftovers!!  Next time, I might double the recipe.  Thanks!

We love this soup. It's hardy and flavorful. I discovered that I only had about a 1/2 cup of the cheddar cheese, but did have a cup of "Mexican mix" cheese, thankfully. Half of the corn i used was fresh home grown, the best! I'm planning to make a huge batch of this to freeze for the winter months!

My family absolutely LOVED this corn chowder! I actually made it with lobster stock from the lobster I cooked the night before, used a cast iron skillet to sauté some bacon and fresh corn to top it off at the end, and omg, DELICIOUSNESS!!! WILL be making this again once the local supersweet corn is available at the local farms! (Gotta love living just outside Amish country lol) THANK YOU for sharing this recipe! It was absofreakinglutely delicious! Oh did I mention corn chowder happens to be my favorite food, and this is BY FAR my favorite recipe!

A family hit. Instead of using butter, I cooked some bacon in the soup pot, set the bacon aside for garnish bits, and cooked the onions and potatoes in the bacon fat. YUM!

This is the best corn chowder recipe I have ever made.  Yum!
Don't add any salt, it's perfect without it because of the cheese and I also added sliced turkey kielbasa and added it in when I put the corn in.  Some fresh cracked pepper and this was the perfect chowder!  My husband doesn't even like corn chowder and he loved it!  I served it with roasted garlic ciabatta bread.

I added 1 pound  sausage 1/4 tsp marjoram and used milk & half and half to the ingredients list.
 I sautéed the onion with the sausage instead of the butter.  I also made a white sauce with the butter and flour(I would used 2 T flour instead of 3), then added a combination of Swiss, Monterey Jack and mostly cheddar cheese to the white sauce to prevent the separation.  I had dinner guests and there were no left overs.

Holy moly! Recently became a vegetarian, and I was really missing a good seafood chowder on a cold fall day. This was better! My BF and roomie (both non vegetarians) said it smelled divine as it cooked, and were full after one bowl each! I got a little worried there wouldn't be enough, so I added a can of pinto beans with the corn. I also subbed veggie broth for chicken, tarragon for cumin (seriously try it!) and I didn't have white wine, so I added red. Made the colour a bit grey, but the boys didn't care. They've demanded this on a weekly bases.

It was very easy to make and came out great! I made some adjustments: instead of regular milk, I used Almond Milk; I added sausage to the recipe; used fresh corn instead of frozen corn, and reduced the simmer time to 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe. It was great.

I actually loved this recipe as did everyone who tried it. Two different people mentioned that 1. it could have used some ham or 2. I would have added bacon. Even without the pork it was awesome but I will add it next time I cook it.

I made a few changes.  I had no sage or parsley, so I added dried tarragon.  I also was out of wine so I used extra dry vermouth.  I added a couple of cooked chicken breasts.  The results were yummy.

Very good. I did not follow exactly- diced onion and five large potatoes, threw in a pot with about 5 tbsp butter and cooked until a bit soft, then added flour and mixed together. After the flour, I added three cups chicken broth and a 1/3 cup chopped celery. Added some salt, black pepper, white pepper, sage, and garlic. Cooked until potatoes were cooked through and soft and broth had thickened. The frozen corn went in for a few minutes so it did not over cook. Last I added the milk and cheese, and cooked until warmed through. It was very thick, the texture was nice, and the spices worked. A bit different from the original, but the essential elements were the same.

I made this soup recently but did not add the wine as I didn't have any. It still tasted good, the rest I followed exactly. My husband thought it wasn't substantial enough to be a full meal, but I did. He tends to think every meal must include meat. I found it to be very tasty and filling, particularly if you add bread or some other side. I also liked it because it was easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand.

This was delicious with a few tweaks. It was a tad bit bland for us. I doublee the recipe and to it added another tsp of cumin (we love cumin) and added 1 1/2 tsp of paprika for a bit more flavor. I also removed bay leaved and used an immersion blender after the potatoes were done cooking prior to adding other ingredients. Made a smooth, thick chowder. YUMMY!

THIS IS A KEEPER!  Great flavor!  My kids (very picky) loved it and all had seconds!  I only used one cup of cheese.  Pair with a salad and a glass of wine...Yum!  Great comfort food on a cold winter night!

Yum! This was delicious! I will make this again! For personal preference, I did not add wine. I only added about 1 cup of cheese. I also added an extra cup of frozen corn. It just seemed like it needed more. Before adding in the cheese, I used an immersion blender to blend it slightly. I like that consistency better than chunky. Also, I recently got my wisdom teeth removed and can't chew very well yet, so it was necessary.

I made this recipe tonight, as my husband was hankering for some chowder. Now, I had never had corn chowder, never mind make it, up until tonight. It was actually really good. We throughly enjoyed it. I believe it would have been even better if I had used fresh parsley instead of dried, also the cumin I used was older (probably past its shelf life, sad but true). Even so, it was very good. I would probably make it again in the future as I play hostess for dinner guests, but next time with the freshest of ingredients :)

Very good recipes. I made some changes (like everyone else it seems..lol). I used a can of Cheddar Condensed Soup instead of cheese, 1 cup of chicken stock and 1 cup of water, and added a chicken breast chopped up. I also cooked it in a crock pot for 6 hours and then blended it so it was smooth, which I prefer in soup. I served it with bacon garnish and my dad liked it with a little tabasco. It was a huge hit.

This was just ok....sort of bland. All of the herbs made the soup too much and it looked funny with all the greenery in it (my kids wouldn't touch it).

What a hearty, one-dish meal.  Because I'm a vegetarian, I switch the chicken broth for vegetable broth, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Not only was it delicious, but it was so filling too.  This one is going into my 'permanent' cookbook right now!

Fantastic! Great flavour--I loved the sage! Yum! I had to leave out the chives & wine as I had none, and I added garlic, carrot, and celery. I used goat's milk cheddar. It was fantastic!

I don't think I would change a thing on this recipe. I did use a very good extra sharp white cheddar cheese and I think I could have cut back on it to lighten this up a little. Both dh & I think it's a keeper. My only problem was I only made 1/2 the recipe.

This was good, but I don't know if I'll make this again.  I have an older recipe that I think I'll stick with.  Thanks though.

This is a great recipe we have used for years! I have recently modified to use light cream and reduced fat cheddar.  The creamy taste is still there, but hopefully, fewer calories!
