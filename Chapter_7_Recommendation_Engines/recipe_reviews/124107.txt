This was a big hit at a recent brunch hubbie and I hosted.  Read all the reviews and followed good advice of adding some chopped bell pepper and cutting back on amount of milk.  I soft scrambled the mixture, placed it in baking dish, covered with cheese, and baked at 350 for about 10-15 minutes.  Came out perfect.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This is a good skillet-breakfast recipe that we learned from my m-i-l, we leave out the milk, though.

A quick, easy breakfast-for-dinner meal!  I left out the milk, added a little chopped bell pepper, and didn't really measure anything.  It was tasty!  Thanks!

Good and easy breakfast recipe.  I added chopped green pepper to the hashbrowns and onions.  I also left out the parsley.  My family said it would make a great filling for a breakfast burrito.

A little on the tame side as far as the sausage goes. I think I'll use spicy sausage next time.

a great fast meal! We Used a little less milk like the other reviews said and made breakfast burritos.  Even the 1 year old loved it!

Mmmmm!  This is what my mom makes on camping trips in the last morning to use up all the left overs!  I substituted diced ham for the sausage and added onion powder in place of the regular onions.
