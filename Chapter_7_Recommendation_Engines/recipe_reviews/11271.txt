I'm happy to be the first reviewer of this recipe and say, great cookie Kevin Ryan! Nicely written recipe with a simple list of ingredients and easy to follow instructions.  Better yet, with your onesy-twosy list of ingredients idea you've come up with a really nice, classic peanut butter cookie.  I also loved the additional boost of peanut flavor and texture with the addition of the peanuts.  These baked up real pretty too!

Best peanut butter cookie recipe on this site, and I've tried a lot of them! I didn't have the shortening and salted nuts, so I used butter and chunky natural peanut butter. These cookies were rather flat, but they were so yummy that I didn't care. I used salted butter (and the exact amount of salt called for), so the cookies weren't incredibly sweet. But that's good!

Update: I subbed semisweet chocolate chips for the chopped nuts upon making this recipe again. Amazing!

Excellent cookie! Made these for Thanksgiving and even the people who weren't fond of peanut butter LOVED them! I have to say it is the best peanut butter cookie I've ever made! Chewy in the middle and crisp edges....not dry at all, like the kind the you have to have milk with or you choke? Not this cookie!

These turned out freaking beautiful. I used butter instead of shortening and added four small packages of Peanut Butter and Jelly M&M's. 12 minutes was the perfect time for these cookies, just pulled them out and let them cool on the sheet. PERFECT chewy-soft awesomeness. Thanks CindyLepp for the recommend. NOTE: I found the Peanut Butter and Jelly M&M's at Walmart.

Great pb cookie. Soft and crispy all at the same time. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 regular shortening. They did flatten out some. They don't crumble when you eat them. Good pb flavor. Thanks Kevin!

These are a bit drier than I expected them to be.  It could've benefited with a few tablespoons of milk.  If you read the Crisco container it actually says to add it when substituting butter in a recipe.  Good flavor though.

This is by far the best peanut butter cookie I've ever made.  I found the recipe by asking on the AR Recipe Exchange and as always, you can count on getting the best advice and recommendations there.  This recipe is perfect as is, not changes needed.

Best peanut butter cookies ever!  I have gotten so many requests for these.  I omit the peanuts (because I don't have any in my pantry) and they are still fantastic.

The classic peanut butter cookie! The only changes I made -- I used butter instead of shortening, and didn't have the chopped peanuts so omitted them. I was also impatient, so I didn't refrigerate the dough after mixing. It didn't make too much of a difference, I don't think -- the dough was just a little sticky to work with. Thanks for sharing!!

This is really an outstanding cookie.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cookie is a crispy cookie and I like my cookies chewy.  The flavor was very peanut-buttery.  I used chunky peanut butter instead of adding peanuts and added white chocolate chips.  My husband said they were the best peanut butter cookie he had ever had.  The whole batch was gone in 2 days.  Thanks so much!  Will be printing this out for the cookbook with all my favorites.  Makes it a little easier to grab.  :)

Absolutely delightful and beautiful cookies...I had a few setbacks while making them though...no butter-flavored shortning so I subbed in butter. No vanilla extract so I used 1 teaspoon of Almond extract and one teaspoon of water (because I hate Almond extract). I also had no normal peanut butter, instead I used Honey Crunchy peanut butter (with honey already in it). In the end, they turned out great anyway. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is the PERFECT peanut butter cookie! Wow. I did use butter instead of shortening and they were fine. I wasn't sure what to think after reading the reviews about runny/flat cookies... Mine stood up beautifully! Thick, chewy, peanut buttery perfection!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly; we only had butter, not shortening, and we didn't have peanuts so I left those out.  I doubled the recipe and baked at 335 (that's as hot as my crappy propane fired oven will get.) I was a little disappointed that my cookies didn't turn out with the pretty criss cross pattern on top; they flattened considerably.  Perhaps this was caused by the substitution of the butter for shortening.  So my review is based on the flavor.  This is a fantastic cookie!  I love peanut butter cookies and have tried many recipes, and this one is top notch.  I will use this recipe again, making sure I have the exact ingredients on hand to see if I can get them to hold their shape. Thanks! Yum!

I am not sure what I did wrong.. I think I am just not at all good at baking, haha. But the cookies, after being put in the oven, melted out and into each other, and off the sides of the pan. I managed to rescue most of them, and even though they look weird and really made my oven a mess, they STILL taste really good. So that rules.

I followed the recipe except I did not add the peanuts and I made the dough balls a bit larger than 1".  They were very tasty, but not as chewy and as peanut buttery as I prefer.  I could also taste a lot of sugar.  I think next time I will try to add an extra 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter to the mix.

Hands down, the best Peanut butter cookie I have ever made! The perfect crispness, the perfect peanut butter taste..YUM! So eay to make, my 11 year old daughter did most of it! And the only reason why she didn't do all of it was because she's a kid, and she lost interest when it needed to be chilled for 2 hours. Folowed this recipe to the tee!

11.8.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11271/onesy-twosy-cookies/ ... Yum, yum, yum! I use regular shortening, only 1t vanilla, no nuts.  My directions are a little different: Cream shortening, sugars & vanilla. Beat in eggs. Stir in peanut butter. Combine dry ingredients & stir into creamed mixture. Ungreased, 350, 10... This is Bev's recipe that I hunted down for Roxmj on the Buzz. :)

This is a great classic peanut butter cookie. My hubby and the folks at work RAVED about them.   The only change I made was to the fats.  I used 3/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of shortening instead of butter flavor shortening.   Cookies came out crisp but chewy and SO full of peanut butter flavor.

This cookie was ok, but mine turned out far too flat to be the perfect peanut butter cookie. I'm still on the hunt for one with real substance.

The best and easiest peanut butter cookies ever. Used extra chunky peanut butter instead of adding salted peanuts and substituted shortening for butter. Recipe stands up well to substitutions for what you've got on hand.

I will never look for another peanut butter cookie recipe again! Did not have shortening on hand, but will use it next time - excellent with butter.

Edit 12/14/12 - Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and instead of chopped peanuts used peanut butter chips - excellent!!

Good flavor and a nice soft cookie.  Mine turned out a little too soft and broke when removing from pan, even after allowing them to set a few minutes.  Added extra flour to the remaining dough.

I subbed butter for shortening and also used chunky peanut butter and left out the nuts. They came out perfect when baked 12 minutes. Chewy in the middle and crispy outside. If you keep them in an airtight container, they stay soft for a few days. They won't be in the house longer than that!

Great peanut flavor, and so easy to make.  My 4 and 8 year old made them with minimal help!  The 12 minute baking time was spot on.  The cookies were crisp at the edges and chewy in the center, just perfect.

this is the absolute perfect peanut butter cookie! the only thing i did different was to use an extra chunky peanut butter, and omit the extra nuts.

I love this cookie.  I am so glad you invented it.  I didn't heave peanuts, so I added peanut butter chips instead.  I could eat these cookies by myself.

Really yummy!  I did as many others suggested and used 1/2 c. shortening & 1/2 c. butter and used creamy peanut butter & no chopped peanuts (I'm not a nuts in cookies kind of person.)   Normally, I'm a soft, chewy cookie kind of gal, but these aren't like other hard, crispy cookies.  These cookies bake up light and crispy and literally melt in your mouth!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yes,these cookies are THE BEST!!!  I used chunky peanut butter and hand crushed my peanuts which made them irregular, the texture was wonderful. I brought them to a Thanksgiving dinner and can tell you that over and over my fellow diners said, "these are the best peanut butter cookies I ever had!" Not exaggerating. Regarding yield: I rolled 1 inch balls that became 2 inch cookies after baking  10 min in a reg. size gas oven and aluminum cookie sheets. Note"It was important to follow directions and let them cool on the sheet for 2 min. after they come out of oven.  It turned out to be approx 5-6 dozen. This way everyone could enjoy a "taste" without too much guilt. Plus, they were perfect kid size. I'll add pictures later but I wanted, slash, NEEDED to review this outstanding recipe. Thanks Kevin.

This is a very good cookie, but I have one warning.  The recipe says it makes 18.  I doubled it and because I was making these for my 6 young grandchildren I cut the size in half (my balls of dough were 1/2 inch instead of an inch).  I anticipated 72 small cookies, but I wound up with 200!  Good thing I have a chest freezer!  This recipe makes a lot more than what it says.

Melt in your mouth yummy!! I skipped the peanuts but I let my son gently push a smartie into the center of each cookie after I pressed them with a fork. 10 minutes in the oven was perfect for mine. I will definately make these agian:) Thanks for sharing!

These are great - I left out the peanuts, and they're still great.  Which means I give it 5 stars.  :)  Thanks!  Edited to add:  Gave them to a houseful of kids home from school today (snow day!) - everyone loved them.  We'll up it to 6 stars.

I was on the fence whether to give this recipe 4 or 5 stars. I have no complaints, but I wasn't wowed by the cookies although they were very good. This is a great traditional peanut butter cookie recipe. I always bake cookies about 2 minutes less than specified, but even these didn't stay quite as soft and chewy the day after as I would have preferred. Definitely recommend to all of the peanut butter lovers!

These cookies were very easy to make and SO SO GOOD. I only had creamy peanut butter and no shorting or extra peanut on hand. I wasn't sure how they would turn out using butter and not shorting but they are great. You MUST TRY THEM!

PERFECT!!!! I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and used half cup of butter and a half cup of shortening. I also didn't have the chopped peanuts but next time i will maybe add m&ms. They are very good. Crisper on outside and chewy on inside. They do flatten quite a bit so my next round i just pushed down on them a little less and baked  for 10 minutes exactly.

These are rich and sweet, and excellent cookies.  I used my small cookie scoop, which is a bit smaller than the recipe called for, so I put them in the oven for 8 min instead of the 10-12.  Otherwise, I kept everything the same.  Bf kept stealing them and so they are a success in our house.  ;o)  Very easy to make, too, although I almost forgot the peanut butter.  I had mixed everything in, was getting ready to put in the fridge, and realized I hadn't put in the pb yet.  So I added that in--at the end--but the cookies were just fine regardless!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been having craving for Peanut Butter Cookies for a while and decided to search for it today. One of the major reasons I decided to use this recipe is because I had left over shortening in my cupboard & the recipe was simple...everything was in ones & twos. After I made the recipe I was not disappointed. I loved the texture & taste of this cookies which are light and fluffy. After the first batch my family and I decided to try and add some chocolate chips to the cookies & we loved it. I will be using this recipe for a long time to come. Thank You so much Kevin Ryan for sharing this recipe with all of us.
