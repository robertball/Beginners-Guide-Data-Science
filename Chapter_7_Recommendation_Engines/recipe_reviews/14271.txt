This is an excellent recipe.  I agree with the other poster that it took awhile, but maybe that's because I was multi-tasking. Definitely get the eggs boiling and the bacon cooking and then start on the dressing. My husband loved the sweetness, but I also think I would cut down on sugar. One warning: don't overcook.  Whisk continuously, just until the onions get tender. I went off to work on another dish and the oil separated, and I ended up with a sticky, dark brown caramel ball. Had to start over.

Excellent salad Terra. I omitted the lettuce and doubled the spinach. The dressing was great with only 2T sugar. I'm not sure we would have like it with 2/3 cup. With modifications to the dressing, this salad is a winner! Thanks.

The dressing to this recipe is incredible in itself.  I adjusted a little because I didn't have white wine vinegar.  I used rice vinegar instead and it was delicious.

This was delicious with some mods.  I made 1/2 of this recipe to make 4 servings.  After reading lots of reviews, I changed some things for my 4 servings: used 1 Tbs. sugar (plenty sweet), used a combo of dry white wine and plain rice vinegar (didn't have white wine vinegar), subbed water for about 1/4 of the oil, used a 9 oz. bag of "Leafy Green Blend" (and omitted the iceberg lettuce), subbed 1/2 cup Mrs. Cubisson's Herb Seasoned Dressing for the croutons (next time I would not bother with either), and also added a bit of blue cheese.  This made a huge amount of salad, more like a good 5-6 servings.  Very good!!!

Hello Michele - Get a clue!  I have finally come to the conclusion that I just DON'T like sugar based dressing.  The sugar in this pretty much ruined the taste of the salad, mind you the salad itself is AWESOME.  The dressing  - UGH!  Thanks for the salad idea Terra.

I make this dressing often and keep it on hand. I use it for all kinds of salads...not just spinach. I do find that it mixes better if you let it come to room temperature before you serve it. It doesn't mix well cold.

I did not decrease the amount of sugar and this salad was a HUGE hit at Christmas.  I doubled the amounts to feed 25 and there was plenty!  Everyone loved it and had 2nds and 3rds.  Great Recipe!  Thanks!

I was so excited about this recipe, but found I was a bit disappointed in the dressing. I was expecting a little more "zip" to the taste. I also cut back on the sliced red onion in the salad portion. Would like to try again, maybe with a variation to the dressing.

I cut the sugar to just under 1/4 cup, used a lot less bacon, and left out the iceberg, and the recipe was perfect for a soup and salad dinner.

The salad dressing for this recipe is WAY too sweet for my taste.  The sugar needs to be reduced and the flavors balances with LOTS more pepper and perhaps some garlic.  The one good thing about the recipe is that it makes a large amount of dressing that will keep.  Otherwise, too overpoweringly tangy for me.

I made this salad for a special "just us" meal with my husband - we loved it (I did take many people's suggestion and cut the sugar to a little less than 1/2 c.).  The dressing also was wonderful when tossed with diced or baby red potatoes.

I have made this salad several times and someone always asks me for the recipe. Even my 9 year old son loves it. The dressing is delicious!  Only modification I made was to add small cubes of cheese and I double the spinach and eliminate the iceberg lettuce.

This salad was easy to prepare. I followed the recipe to the tee, but the dressing was disgusting. It messed up the entire salad. I will try it again, but not with the same dressing.

This had become a family favourite and whenever we make it for company, they love it too!  I have modified the recipe in that I use only one bag/bunch of spinach.  This is usually enough to satisfy my family and I save half the dressing for another day!

Excellent recipe.  Served it for a PTA Board of Directors meeting and had two requests for the recipe on the spot!  I ommitted the iceberg lettuce, however.  Wanted a true spinach salad.  Thanks Terra May!

The dressing was way too sweet, next time I will decrease the sugar by half.  The crushed crutons didn't really add much.  Overall though a really good dressing.  I used half spinich and half red leaf which worked out great.

This is a wonderful recipe! 
I made this for a baby shower, and got raves (and an empty salad bowl!!)
I added 1/3 cup sunflower seeds, and used two bags of spinach, instead of the iceburg lettuce.
You've got to try it!

Quick and easy version: I used 2 servings of the dressing, 1/2-clamshell baby spinach, and 4 slices bacon.  You can just microwave the dressing until boiling (~1 min), much easier than stovetop!

This salad did not work out for me. The dressing was awful. It came out in a gloppy gluey mess and wouldn't coat well. Plus the onion flavor was too strong for me. Since everyone else seems to like it, must just be me.

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe!  Although we did not make the entire salad, only the dressing, we found preparation easy and the flavor delightful!  We have saved this versatile recipe and use the dressing for everyday use or for special occassions!  We hope you enjoy it as much as we did! 
P.S.  In our initial preparation we substituted white for red onion and it worked very well!  We tossed the dressing with a spring/spinach mix salad and whole roasted almonds and it was fantastic!

DELICIOUS!! Every family party for the past 10 yrs. I am asked to make this.  Its always a huge hit! The differences is I use only spinach, no iceberg. I use 1 tsp eaxch-celery seed and Prepare Mustard (like Grey Poupon. Instead of the croutons & onion rings-right before i serve it I pour about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of Peppridge Farms dry stuffing mix then the dressing. I agree that the dressing is the reason this salad is so delicious!!

This salad is so good - everyone should try it.  My friend gave me the recipe and I lost it - and found the exact same one on here.  The dressing is so good!

Thanks for a great new twist on spinach salad. Even some of my picky eaters who would not normally eat spinach ate this and loved it. The dressing definitely made this. I had to make another batch for the next night's dinner as everyone wanted more.

Pretty good.... I made beef bourguignon for my hubby last night (we celebrated Valentine's day early). A spinach salad seemed to be the perfect complement to our meal. I was on the lookout for a dressed up, slightly elegant salad and this fit the bill perfectly!  Loaded with bacon, egg and croutons, this was definitely not lo cal. :) As with all new recipes I try, I made a couple of slight changes. I omitted the romaine called for and used all spinach instead (the entire bunch of it). I also halved everything (again, I was serving two people and even then, only as a side dish), substituted bacon grease for some of my vegetable oil  (I can't imagine not using it, especially since it added SO much flavor!) and reduced the amount of sugar by half (i.e. 2.5 T + 1/2 t). I added chopped egg only to my portion because my hubby HATES eggs.... My only regret is that I didn't pour my dressing over my greens while still warm. This is how traditional spinach & bacon salad is served (at least the ones I've tried). All said and done, this is decent, but I'm not sure it's what I'm looking for. I think I'll continue my search, maybe for a recipe that also includes some sort of cheese (i.e. blue, gorgonzola, etc.). Thanks anyways, Terra! :-)

This is a pretty good spinach salad.  The recipe makes an abundance of dressing so you could definitely cut it in half.  I have tossed the salad with the dressing at room temperature, but I have also heated it briefly in the microwave before adding-both are tasty.  On the sweet side, you may want to play around with the sugar to prepare a slightly more tart version.  The kids in my Foods and Nutrition class thought this recipe was delicious--many of them had never tried "fresh" spinach before.

Delicious, but the recipe makes alot of dressing.  Our family doesn't drown our salads in dressing, in the future I will only make 1/4 of the dressing recipe.

Salad was okay as is, but I agree there was WAY too much sugar in the dressing! Next time I'll just try 2 Tbsp. I also omitted the croutons. I think that with changes, the salad could be quite good!

When I first made this, the salad looked a little plain so I added a bunch of cherry tomatoes for colour.
The dressing turned out great (like many others I used half a cup of sugar and added a little water to it). To prevent my dressing from turning gooey, I let it cool on the counter and poured it over the salad at room temperature. The unused portion of the dressing was refridgerated and did, in fact, turn into a thick goo. 
But I'll be making this one again.

I made this yesterday for a friend's birthday spa party and all the ladies loved it.  Everyone wants the recipe.  It was light and filling at the same time.  Just enough. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical about putting the crushed croutons in, but it definitely helped make the salad a success.  I also took Feta cheese to sprinkle on top, and lots of people liked that added touch.

What a nice salad this is.  I cooked and cooled the dressing as directed and then hit it with the immersion blender.  It tasted great!  (I did use romaine and spinach instead of iceberg) Why this recipe with 62 good reviews has been waiting for a picture for 12 years is a mystery. Try it - you'll like it!

I loved this salad, and the dressing.  May I suggest to those whose dressing was thick and pasty, you cooked it too long.  I cooked mine on a very slow boil for approx. 6-10 min.  Don't let it start getting too thick!!

Really delicious.  My changes: I didn't use iceberg lettuce, just increased the amount of spinach.  I didn't use croutons, either, but I added mushrooms.  My husband said, "Mmmm" when he took his first bite.  The dressing recipe is wonderful.  A word to the wise: if putting your dressing in a shake canister, make sure it has cooled before trying to close it up and shake it.  I made the mistake of bottling up hot dressing; the pressure built up and blew the lid off, exploding 3/4 of the dressing I had made all over my kitchen wall!  Don't be stupid like me.  :-)

I finally found it - a perfect hot bacon/egg dressing for spinach salad.  Although this recipe says to cool it before serving, it's perfect served warmed.  Instead of cutting down the sugar or halving the oil with water - I just added water to the recipe.  It made it seem less sweet and sticky than what other reviewers seemed to imply.

I loved this salad.  Because I am a diabetic, I used Splenda instead of sugar in the dressing and it came out tasting almost better than with real sugar.  When I make the salad I tend to add what will suit the occastion.  I am always asked to make this for family gatherings and we are talking a large family (sometimes 30 to 40 people).  I always start with spinach and use another lettuce besides iceburg. Always add the onions and  I add cherry tomatos, some type of cheese and a veggie with a different color (just a little like some yellow and orange peppers for Thanksgiving).  I do add the croutons and mix the dressing with the salad right before serving.  I serve the bacon and eggs on the side due to the amount a vegetarians in our family.  There is usually very little if any left.  What is left over is great with ham or turkey added.  Wonderful salad and I have become the official salad maker of the family.

I made this salad for company on New Year's Day, and it was delicious.  I used just 1/2 cup sugar.  I also used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup vegetable oil, then 1/2 cup of water.  It was perfect for us....just sweet enough and thick enough to stick to the spinach.  I'll use this dressing recipe often on any salad.  Delicious!!

I LOST my "Spinach Salad" dressing recipe and after looking at Emeril's, etc., I felt like this one was pretty close to what I had made before.  I had to scale it down for two and it was just absolutely wonderful...I used baby spinach leaves and added a splash or two of Raspberry Vinegar to give it just a hint of a "kicked up" flavor.  We enjoyed this recipe on New Year's Eve with our Lobsters...it was just perfect!!  THANK YOU!  PS ~ If it's "gooey" or whatever like some other comments, then just add more liquid, vinegar/oil, etc OR just LEARN to mix it RIGHT  LOL ~ This recipe is great the way it's written...for me anyway ~ ENJOY and THANK YOU!

I've made this for 2 group dinners and it was a hit.  I don't like really sweet dressings so I reduced the sugar in the dressing to 1/3 cup and added 1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms.  It was a hit - one guest threatened to lick the bowl.  The 2nd dinner was during the spinach scare so I substituted a spring mix blend (no spinach) for the spinach and it was still a great tasting salad.

This was delicious but , like others, I had to add a little extra. I sauteed one sliced onion (almost to caramelization) and also added some shallot to the pan. I then put the spinach in and heated it with the cream cheese so I could mix it. I left out the lemon pepper and instead added nutmeg and salt and pepper. I then baked it in the cast iron skillet it was in. Delicious. I think this makes a good base for adding a lot of different ingredients that you might have on hand; mushrooms, a handfull of frozen veggies, whatever you think might work. As is tho' I think it's just too bland.

I loved the salad... it was exacly what I was looking for.  The dressing needs work.  I might of over cooked it...  it turned into a thick gooey mass that needs thinning.  I will try what others have said and use some water in place of some oil.  Also, the sugar could be cut back a little.  The dressing is very tasty however and makes the salad if the consistency is right.

Great salad that is different from the norm. The only change I made was to use a store bought honey mustard dressing instead of making the dressing in the recipe. My husband loved it too.

Thanks for your recipe. It is a good basic one, I'm just not sure about the dressing. I made it per the recipe but I wasn't thrilled. It wasn't bad. I'm think there may have been something missing but I'm not sure.

Excellent spinach salad!  Usually I do not like sweeter dressings, but this was very good.  I will make this one again! Thanks for sharing.

Wow!!  I took this to a potluck event--it was one of the first to go--the dressing is soooo good.  I omitted eggs, and iceberg lettuce, just to keep things simple--and it tasted very good!
