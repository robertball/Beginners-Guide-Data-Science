I made this tonight and my husband and I love this meal.  I gave it 5 stars because I will make this again and again.  I made a few changes.  I did not have ramen noodles so I used egg noodles and cooked them in beef broth.  I also used portabella mushrooms.  I tenderized the steak before cooking.  I did use cabbage since I did not have it on hand.  The only negative, it was a tad bland.  Next time I will double the amount of peanut sauce.

I made the dish and it was great.  I did not have the chili with peanut butter so I added a TB spoon of Jif to the chinese chili sauce I had and the flavor was so good. I will be making it for friends and family. Great blend of fresh veggies and sauce inter mingled with the noodles.

This was good however the raman noodles were mushy cooking them 3 minutes as the package instructions indicated.  I would recommend not cooking them more than 2 minutes (not sure all raman noodles are the same as far as cooking directions, we got ours at an Asian market).  The meat needed to be tenderized and it needed a little more kick.  Otherwise it was pretty good.  We had Peanut sauce on hand so we just added some Chili pepper sauce.  Probably needed to add a bit more.

I have made this two times so far, with slight modifications.  The first time I used diced chicken breast instead of beef, which worked well.  The second time I used chicken top ramen and no meat, but the noodles came out a bit soggy.  Either beef noodles hold up better, or a few seconds makes the difference between firm and soggy noodles.

This was soo easy and delicious! The noodles were a bit soggy as other people said. May use different ones next time. People also suggested more flavor which was a big help so I used more peanut sauce soy sauce and sautéed ginger with the steak. I'll probably use more peppers next time. The biggest hit was that I added peanuts to the dish. It gives a great crunch and flavor. Perfect intro to cooking!

This was ok, but I wasn't too fond of the texture of the ramen. My partner decided to make this one for dinner a few weeks ago, and we did like the overall dish, we think next time we will use a better noodle (perhaps lo main) instead of cheaper ramen.

I found this recipe while using the all recipes app on my phone and looking for something quick to make for dinner. This was super easy to make and everyone LOVED it. I did not have cabbage on hand so I did not add the cabbage and I could not find the peanut chili sauce, so I followed another review and added 1T of JIF peanut butter to sauce mix.  I will be making this one again and again! Thanks

I just tried this recipe out last night.  I'm more of a BBQ guy rather than stove top, so it took me a while to prepare everything, but it was well worth it.  The ramen noodles were surprisingly good... I had my doubts that it would come out good because of the packaged ramen.  I think if you boil the noodles in too much water it'll cause it to become mushy and slimy.  Mine came out perfect.  My girlfriend LOVED IT!  This was my first Asian dish and I am very happy with how it came out.

This was delicious.  I made it for Mother's Day.  And we all really enjoyed it.  I doubled the recipe as we had more than 4 people.  It was a big hit...except my sister didn't eat it because she dislikes mushrooms.  Oh, and I used baby bella mushrooms, instead.

Well, like some of us do, I improvised with ingredients on hand. I used frozen stir-fry veggies and some thin sliced pork chops to make this. Yikes! I even substituted chicken broth and used the chili flavor ramen (we like spicy). I shouldn't be rating this, but we enjoyed the sauce so much I wanted to let Audrey know. I know i will make this recipe again hopefully with all the proper ingredients. At least I didn't submit a picture ;)

Made this for dinner tonight using left over Tri-Tip. It was wonderful. Very versatile recipe that can take lots of additions to increase it for extra portions. I used 2 packs of ramen soup noodles, half a bag of cole slaw cabbage and 1/3 a bag of shredded carrots. My hubby is not a fan of spicy food so I combined a little bit of chili paste with peanut butter, beef stock, fish sauce and soy sauce. Don't over cook the noddles and maybe rinse with cold water so they don't stick together and don't continue to cook while you are sautéing the veggies.  Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper!

I used thin spaghetti instead of ramen, pork tenderloin instead of beef. 
I added 1/4 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of Frank's Red Hot sweet chili sauce to get the flavor and heat we like.
we will make again, hubby loved it!

Hi, guys! You know what? I read the reviews before I made this, so I sorta blanched the noodles in the boiling water for a minute. But this recipe was fantastic! Me and my grandsons thoroughly munched this dish! In fact, we liked the cabbage and Ramen noodles cooked together so much that, next time, I'm just gonna make those with a little broth and seasonings! Great!

Excellent! Used Louisana Cajun Shrimp Boil as seasoning vs. regular Cajun, holy cow - nice kick! Also used Rice Noodles and there was enough liquid left in the vegies and meat to coat them but next time, I would season the noodles with a bit of ginger in the pot when cooking. I didn't have bean sprouts or green onions so I used a can of fancy Chinese vegatables which worked out great! Will definitely make this again!

the noodles came out soggy and i thought it was tasteless overall. I'd stick with some of the suggestions posted if you're making this for the first time.

Made this last night. used Spicy Thai Peanut sauce from this website with a couple of modifications. see my review there. I used striploin steaks in response to some reviews that found the steak tough. I removed excess fat and sliced thin and marinated with a little soya sauce and hoisin sauce and minced garlic. I used almost all vegetables stated except celery. The cabbage I used was chinese cabbage. I did not use ramen noodles. I used chinese egg noodles boiled in 1 cup of beef broth and 1/2 tsp of sesame oil. The noodles soaked up most of the broth. I then placed in a colander. For the stirfry, peanut oil infused with a little sesame oil for authentic flavor. Fried meat up in small batches until just cooked...still a little pink...and removed to plate. Stirfried veges with juices from resting meat and then added peanut sauce mixture. When veges were tender crisp added noodles and stirred...then added meat. stirred until everything was hot. Plated with additional green onion. This recipe was so good. You do need to use sesame oil for more authentic flavor.

Family loved this so much with the tweaks I made the first time, they requested a second time this week! Here are the changes I made:  used pork chops thinly sliced and seasoned with 1 ramen noodle packet (pork flavored ramen). Coated the slices in cornstarch and fried until just crispy. Removed and sauteed a roughly chopped onion and a large carrot cut into matchsticks in a bit of sesame oil until crisp-tender. Threw in a 16 oz bag of coleslaw mix and doctored up the sauce by adding peanut butter, sesame oil, sweet thai chili sauce, extra soy sauce, minced garlic, onion powder, extra ground ginger, and a few crushed red chili pepper flakes. Cooked down the cabbage/sauce mixture while boiling 2 packs of ramen noodles. Drained noodles and tossed them in, along with the crispy pork slices and heated through. Served in bowls that we all topped with our own touches (sesame seeds, sriracha, extra soy sauce, etc). I suggest making the noodles LAST and only boil 2 min vs 3, as they'll soften a bit more when added to the cabbage mixture. Serving them separately would be just as easy as well. This recipe served as a springboard for changes I made based on what I had handy, as well as family tastes.  It will remain on the weekday dinner rotation due to the simplicity and flavor.

Really delicious. I replaced the Thai sauce with a beef and broccoli sauce I found at the store though so it wasn't so spicy. Just a personal preference.

I made it with turkey breasts and chicken flavored ramen and chicken broth! I also added red pepper flakes to spice it up and did away with the peanut sauce for allergy reasons, and it was really good!

We just made this for dinner and it was very yummy. Good favor with a decent mild to medium spice. I love spicy Asian dishes so I could certainly have tolerated more but thought this was perfect for a group with varying tastes. We will certainly be making this again.

A simple version of Thai need and noodles, but very tasty. I'd refined this for both the beginner wanting to learn about creating Thai flavors, and the time pressed experienced home cook.

This was delicious, and I rarely like the results of my own cooking (even after following a great recipe).  I went to multiple stores and could not find Thai chili peanut sauce, but I finally did find Thai peanut sauce and added ground chili pepper. I also swapped out the bean sprouts and mushrooms for bamboo shoots since we prefer them. This dish wasn't difficult, though it did take several dishes and a bit more time compared to what I'm used to, but the end result was worth it! I would recommend using only one packet of ramen, though, unless you really like a lot of noodles. This really turned out to be a huge hit in our house! I will be making this again!

I made it with vegetables I had on hand - Cabbage, carrots, and onions. I accidentally put in fish sauce before I put in some soy sauce, but I think it was a good addition. I also put in a little extra ginger.   All the kids enjoyed it.

I made it with rice vermicelli. I plated the pasta, then added the meat/veggie/sauce.

Made this with left over pork chops.  We have a nut allergy so was not sure about the noodles.  We used rice noodles and skipped the peanut sauce…  We added Hossin sauce and curry instead.  Did not give it a five star only because the ratios seemed off.  My three teens ate it but did not go back for seconds.

this came out super nice.. instead of using ramen noodles i used angel hair pasta.. i still used both seasoning packets while cooking the pasta.. i didnt have thai chili peanut sauce so i used half pb and half garlic chili sauce.. i feel like the beef could have used a little salt while being cooked.. because although i dont feel the dish is bland.. when i bite into a piece of steak.. there's no real flavor there.. also i would have liked to have had more sauce.. didn't have any red bell pepper or bean sprouts unfortunately.. im sure they could have added something more to the dish.. but i wasn't missing it.. i always make sure to tenderize tougher cuts of meat to hell and back to ensure it's not going to be chewy.. didn't have that problem with this dish.. ty for the start of something good

I would make this recipe again but with a few tweaks of my own. I'd use a better quality steak because the top round would've been better if it were more tender. Definitely only pre-cook the ramen noodles briefly (like 1 min.) before draining because they are going to soften a lot more once you add them into your stir fry pan and you don't want them to be overly mushy. Or if you can spare the time just use a thicker type of noodle instead of the ramen and substitute the ramen beef seasoning packet with beef stock or a small beef bouillon cube. We didn't have thai spices, or peanut sauce, and improvised by adding curry seasoning, peanut butter, cayenne pepper, & soy sauce - it came out very good! I'd recommend this meal if you're looking to make a quick, easy, and delish weeknight meal!

I started the evening with 7 ppl to feed & 3/4lbs of top round.  I came upon this recipe and scaled it up to 6 servings.  That converted the Peanut Sauce to 3 cups.  3 cups would have made this a soup!  I also couldn't find Thai chili peanut sauce but my local store had Thai peanut sauce.  I used the entire 13oz bottle but no more.  I also didn't use the broth.  Again I think it would have been too soupy.  I cooked the noodles with one seasoning pack but put the other two in the sauce (there's the broth flavor, right?) Everything else I left the same except omitted the mushrooms (kids don't like).  It was outstanding!  It was easy and healthy and really delicious.  I usually serve stir fries on rice so this was a nice change.  The only person who didn't like it was my daughter's 16-year-old friend.
