Great for a quick meal on the grill.  I had all of the ingredients on hand, which made it easy for me.  I marinated it before reading you were supposed to brush it on while grilling, but I liked it this way.  Also butterflied the chops to get more flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very yummy, I broiled it instead of grilled and it came out great!

All my family liked this recipe. Coming from an area where we get more rain than sun--and therefore less barbecuing experience--I needed something quick, without needing to marinade. We used a really good quality bbq sauce to start with, but the extra kick from the pepper sauce was nice. Thanks for posting something that really is PDQ, and tasty.
