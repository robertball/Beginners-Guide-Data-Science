this was delish! i used strip steak because that's what i had, and also belle mushrooms because i like them better than shiitake. the one thing very incorrect about the recipe is the cook time/temp of the steak; 140° is too well done, i cooked mine to 125° and was perfect medium after resting.

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought the flavors were rather subtle, maybe to let the flavor of the meat have the leading role. So be sure to start with a quality steak. I might try red wine on a redo.

What a great twist on steak. We just had marinated grilled steak a few days ago, so I was looking for something different, and this recipe was an excellent choice. There are such a variety of flavors going on and they all come together beautifully in the final product. Tarragon is a great call. We like bold flavors so I used a tablespoon of dried since we did not have fresh and it was spectacular. Our steaks were about an inch thick and on high heat, I did not let them cook for four minutes per side as instructed in the recipe, which would have resulted in well-done meat. For steaks of that thickness, 2 1/2 minutes per side is about right if you are looking for medium-rare on high heat. This one is a winner!

I used sliced green onions instead of shallots, added fresh spinach and topped with grated Parmesan. Only complaint was the sirloin was a little tough

Made this for me & the bf last weekend & we loved it. Made the following modifications:
*Omitted wine - doesn't need it & we don't drink alcohol
*Used regular ol' cap mushrooms
*Omitted tarragon b/c we're not fans
*Thickened gravy at end w/1 tbspn corn starch to 1c. hot water, shook vigorously until mixed & slowly added to pan as I stirred

Served w/side salad & garlic parm pasta & we loved it!

The tarragon really added a nice touch, making me pleasantly surprised. This is a lovely dish. Due to limited ingredients at my grocer, I used Portobello mushrooms. Yummy. Def will make again. This was nice as I'm not big steak eater, but my husband is, it gave me a variety of flavors. I also always pull out my meat from the fridge early, to reach close to room temperature before cooking, it really brings out the flavor.

Doubt if I'll make this again.  Not familiar with tarragon or shitake mushrooms but, something made it taste of licorice, which I don't care for.

I used Shitake mushrooms and think they were too  mild in taste.  Also a little chewy.  I would definitely make this again but with different mushrooms.
