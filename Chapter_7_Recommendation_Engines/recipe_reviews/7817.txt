I needed a recipe for white cake so I used this one without the lemon filling (I hate lemon filling) and it came out great.  I made it with strawberries and whipped cream icing and I added an extra splash of milk to make sure it was moist, and it was eaten up within 2 days!!!

I made this cake for my son's birthday. I used Splenda rather than white sugar so the layers did not rise very high. Although he loved the cake, I thought it had too much orange which overpowered the lemon flavor which gave it a "funny" taste. I think my son said he loved it because he didn't want to hurt my feelings. I doubt I'll be making this cake anytime soon.

I really loved this cake.  I gave it four stars because despite liberally greasing the cake pans it stuck to the bottom making have to make two batters for one occasion.  I used wax paper on the second attempt.

The flavor and texture of the cake were excellent.  For the filling, I used a little more lemon juice and a little less orange juice, and I threw in some lemon zest, too, because I wanted a more lemony flavor.  It turned out really nicely.

This cake tasted very good. HOWEVER: 1. It stuck even to wax paper! 2. The batter was a weird consistancy and looked curdled. 3. It was terribly crumbly. It did not stay in one peice. 4. It was overly sweet. So if looks don't matter this is a good cake for you!

I thought this recipe was excellent!  The filling was superb!!  I love not-so-sweet cakes; topping the cake with wipped cream and strawberries worked well.  I would recommend this as a summer cake, also good with tea.
I didn't find the cake heavy as one reviewer did, although, I wouldn't classify it as light either.  The cake base it self was of good taste, one of the best basic white cakes I have made.
Thank you for this lovely recipie!

We too had to make a cake for family bday, but cake is too small, weird cornbread like texture, stuck to pan even though I greased and floured. Very Dissappointed, but will use this cake in a triffle instead. I say dont waste your time on this one...

I followed the recipe exactly, and had the same problem as another reviewer - the cake stuck to the pan. Maybe try greasing and flour - but I tossed the recipe and will try a different one. (My rating is for the cake, not the filling. I was using a chocolate filling.)

This cake was very light and tasted great. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The only reason I gave it four stars was that I had problems with it sticking to the cake pan, as others described. I would probably use wax paper if I made it again.

was very crumby but I added a few tablespoons of raspberry jam to the batter to add a touch of flavor. I did not make it with the lemon filling, I used the brownie frosting found on this website. I will try making this again without the jam to see if it is still crumby. Tasted very good though!

Everyone thought the cake taked great, the only problem is the filling made icing and cutting rather difficult. The filling was oozing out everywhere, and did not look all that appetizing. Thank goodness for my brave family who tried it.  Next time I make the fililng I will not use the whole recipe in between the layers. I will also refrigerate the cake prior to icing and cutting.

Can t understand some of the problems encountered with this simple cake   I do suggest you use cake flour (sifted before measuring) which gives a lighter texture.   Also you will need to add about 2 tbsp. more.

Used ingredients just as the recipe specified, but baked a little differently because I was making a multiple-layer cake.  I creamed the sugar, shortening and milk before adding the flour, so as not to develop too much gluten and make it tough.  Then I split the batter into 3 portions (by weight) and baked in three 9-inch pans for 13 minutes at 365.  Greased and liberally floured the pans and my cakes all came out with no problems at all.  

Delicious!  My hard-to-please hubby said it was very moist, and we both ate it up.

I made just the cake section of the recipe. With it i made 20 cupcakes. I discovered my milk had gone bad, so I supstituted vanilla soy milk added a nice texture and extra flavor.

this cake was way too dense for me. The filling tasted good, and so did the icing, but the cake... well i think next time i'll just go out and buy a box mix or something.

This is good and looks pretty. Once assembled, cover and put in the fridge until serving time, for easier slicing. I substituted 2 eggs for the 4 egg whites and lemon extract for the vanilla. I used Carol's Lemon Icing recipe to frost the top of the cake and also between the 2 layers. Yummy! Thanks, Carol.

The cake tasted like flour.  It was dense and too sweet.  The flavour was really flat.(Maybe because i didn't add the vanilla?)
 
Also because the cake was so dense and heavy, it was very difficult to stop the orange/lemon filling from squeezing out.

I have been waiting all day to write this review. For a week I had planned to make this cake for my husband's birthday. This morning I did just that. I wondered about the shortening amt. & felt something was wrong once the batter was made, the consistency was 'off'. But because of all the rave reviews I hoped for the best. Now I feel making dessert recipes is not hard- follow the directions, it's that simple. I always review my recipes after ea. step & ingredient. That being said- this cake was awful. I almost cried, I was so in disbelief and now I had no cake or time to make a new one for my husband. I saved the cake for when he did get home- we both agreed, it tastes like weird cornbread, now how is that??

The flavor and texture of this cake were outstanding, but I had a little trouble with the filling.  It was either too much or not thick enough and it oozed out from between the layers as I was frosting the top and sides.  Maybe I didn't cook it long enough.  I will probably try this again another time.

I found this cake to be a lot heavier than I'd anticipated.  The lemon filling was nice but I won't likely be serving this cake any time soon.

For some reason the cake tasted like pancakes. Perhaps it was all the baking soda, and the unusual way the recipe tells you to mix the ingredients.

cake tastes okay.  nothing special.  but after making it twice it sticks in the pans no matter what I did.  I greased liberally, I floured and greased, in nice, heavy duty non sick pans and it stuck Badly both times.  it is an easy cake for my kids to help with making since it' s made differently than most recipes, but I will not make it again. there are better recipes on here.

This recipe is fantastic. I used it to make an Easter Bonnet cake that we used on a Buffet table. It looked good, and tasted even better.

Only used this recipe to make the cake portion.  Used butter instead of shortening and two whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites, since that was all I had on hand.  This cake had good structure and was it was moist.  A little on the sweet side.  Used my own lemon curd for the filling and iced cake with my own vanilla frosting.

My daughter wanted to make a white cake for christmas dessert and this turned out great! It was moist with a good flavor. She did not use the lemon filling, but made a buttercream frosting for the layer and the top. We will use this recipe again.We always use this recipe every single time we make cupcakes or cakes.If you want an awesome cake for family, friends, even reunions this is the cake to make.

I used this as a base for my recipe and tweaked it quite a bit and it turned out really good. I used 1/2 cup butter (your could use shortening like the recipe states), 1 1/2 cup white sugar, 4 egg whites, 2tsp vanilla, 2 cups of flour, 1 tsp salt, 1/2tbsp of baking soda (no baking powder), reduced the milk to 3/4 cup and used 3/4 cup of sourcream. 

First I whipped butter and the sugar together. added the egg whites 1 at a time. incorporating each after each addition. Then I whipped the batter on high for 2-3 minutes until nice a fluffy. Then mixed in the vanilla.

In a separate bowl I combined the flour, salt and baking soda. I alternately added the flour mixture with the sourcream, incorporating each addition before adding the next. I scalded the milk and slowly added it to the batter.

looking forward to tweaking it more for different flavors!
