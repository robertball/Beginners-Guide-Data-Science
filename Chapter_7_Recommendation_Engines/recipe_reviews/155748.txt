Back yard figs never tasted so good! Gave it 30 mins in my new oven, then an additional 5 mins to finish it off. I added whole figs to the top of the Tart, splitting them open like starbursts, sprinkled with brown sugar and brandy and broiled everything until sugar melted and figs were heated and limp. Serve with real whipped cream and Pistachio chopped nuts.

I will make this again. The flavors are absolutely superb. Between the lemon, brandy, pistachios and figs, the combination smells and tastes amazing. I actually made this in a single tart pan, and I used a teaspoon of vanilla instead of a vanilla bean. Note that you do mix some of the figs into the crust, and the crust will be a little bit softer than your typical crumbly tart.

This was absolutely divine! I wish it was lower in carbs, but oh well! It was worth it. The pistachios, brandy, lemon rind, vanilla and figs came together perfectly. A very elegant dessert.

The photo showed 1 large tart, but the directions were for 4 individual tarts. I made them as individual tarts and liked it that way even though the portion was perhaps slightly big (given it's nuttiness and sugar content) after a medium-sized dinner. Note: The directions said to use four, 3 3/4 " tart pans, but  I used four 4 3/4" round creme brulee dishes and that worked out perfectly. I did bake them a slightly shorter time than the recipe called for. I just ran my knife around the edges and it came out nicely onto the dessert plates having just sprayed the dishes with PAM spray.

This tart is delicious, especially the next day.  It is very lemony though, so cut back on the lemon zest if you don't like a strong lemon flavor.  I only had 1 1/2 tablespoons and it was enough for me.

What a shame more folks aren't making this! Recipes for fresh figs are a bit hard to come by, and this one hit it out of the park! Creamy, flavorful, and the lemon flavor to complement it all is perfect. Made exactly as directed except adding figs to top, and it came out perfect.
