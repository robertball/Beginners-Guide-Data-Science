Thanks for this reminder on stacked caprese salad. So impressive as a salad and everyone is always so surpised at something so simple but so delicious. I usually use the big beef tomatoes and then I don't have to stack so high.

This is YUMMY- it really doesn't need to be grilled though. Served fresh its so good. Also, next time I might just toss it in a bowl with the dressing and serve like that, with mozzarella balls and cherry tomatoes. These little towers look lovely, but are impossible to eat without dismantling anyways. Yummy either way! You don't need the zucchini either. It looks nice, but you don't really taste it, and its a pain to slice them so thin. Oh, and where did they get the nutritional facts for this? 50 grams of fat and 584 calories per serving? Ummmm I don't think that would be right even if you ate 20 of them!

This was good, although not as good as I hoped it would be.  I only cooked the zucchini, and not the cheese or tomatoes, and I sprinkled dry basil in the dressing instead of having basil leaves.  And I totally forgot the salt and pepper and Parmesan cheese (I know, I'm ridiculous).  But what I didn't like about the recipe was the dressing, which I followed exactly.  My boyfriend loved it though, so maybe it was just me.  I would make this again but tweak the dressing...I'm not sure how though!  It's obviously just my personal preference...otherwise great recipe. The tomato, mozzarella, and zucchini goes really well together, and look so pretty stacked up.

This is sooooo good.  It is annoying to slice the zucchini so thin, so I'm just going to slice it crossways next time I make it.  Also, I chopped the basil and added it to the dressing instead of using whole leaves. I forgot the paprika but didn't miss it. I think the oil content here is a bit much as well (this IS a Bertolli recipe).  I used much less.

Wow, this was so good! It was nowhere near as pretty as the picture, but it was delicious!
