Yummy! I kept the recipe mostly the same. However, I did not use a pie-crust (since I didn't have it and it just adds calories). I simply put the ingredients a casserole dish. I used butter and garlic flavored instant potatoes and mozzarella cheese instead. VERY good! Will make again! Thanks!

I was pleasantly surprised - this was really really good!!  I used a frozen pillsbury "roll-out" crust that had been in the freezer since the holidays.  I thawed it out for half a minute in the microwave, and then prebaked it for 10 minutes while I browned the groundbeef.  I added about 3/4 cup frozen chopped onion to the beef while it was browning, and while that was going on I made Betty Crocker packaged mashed potatoes in the microwave, which only take 4 minutes. When the beef and onion was done I drained out the fat, and added the rest of the ingredients right in the frypan instead of dirtying another bowl.   I doubled the worcestershire and ketchup amounts which worked out fine and gave it a really nice taste.  Then I baked it only about 20 minutes since I had already prebaked the crust.  Yum. Everyone really liked it, my husband wanted to know what I added to the beef! Next time I'll make two since there wasn't any left for anyone to take to work today!  Thanks so much.  This is going to be a regular at our house.

This is so yummy!!! My whole family LOVED this, including my picky one and two year olds! It is a recipe that has been added as a regular to our menu planning. 

I made just a couple changes. I cut the recipe in half except for the corn and Worcestershire sauce (I used all it called for), and I upped the ketchup. I used a deep dish pie crust and the half recipe filled it perfectly. 

One thing that I think I will change the next time I make it is that instead of putting the corn on the bottom I'll put the meat mixture on bottom with the corn between the meat and potatoes. When I cut into it to serve the corn just went everywhere. I figured the potatoes would make them "stick" in the pie a little better. 

Regardless of the minor changes I made, this is a very yummy and hearty meal!

Very easy to prepare. Everyone enjoyed this dish, including my mother-in-law. CHANGES: Browned the crust. Used 4 TBLS ketchup. Layer meat first, corn second, next the potatoes, then 1 cup blended coby & american cheese.

An easy and good recipe!  I added minced garlic and several seasonings to the meat (Creole Seasoning, garlic powder, seasoned salt, onion powder and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper) and increased the ketchup to 4 tblsp.  I boiled a carrot when boiling the potatoes for homemade mashed potatoes.  I sliced half the carrot and put it with the corn and mashed the other half of the carrot in with the mashed potatoes.  It turned out pretty well!

I also didn't use the pie crust, which reduces the fat a lot.  Delicious, comfort food.

Very good!  I didn't change a thing as far as the ingredients.  Per one reviewers suggestion, I put the corn on top of the meat mixture (made perfect sense) and that worked great.  Next time I will pre-bake the pie crust because the bottom stayed doughy.  I used instant potatoes and a frozen pie crust (I know some cooks would never use either one) so it was a very easy dinner!  We will make this again and again.  Thank you Alicia!

I too "upped" the spices a bit in the meat by adding pepper, garlic and a tablespoon of brown sugar, which with additional ketchup gave it a slightly sloppy joe taste.  I blended the cheese into the potatoes rather than having them lay on the top, sprinkling a touch of paprika to the top to give it some color.  I sauteed some mushrooms with the beef too.  A pre-baked crust worked really well and I didn't want the juice of the corn sogging the crust, so I followed the advice of the other reviewers and put my corn on top of the beef - although I don't know why you couldn't just mix it in as well.  It was a nice, hearty winter meal that my meat and potatoes family really enjoyed.  I served it with the recipe for Sweet Dinner Rolls and it was a hit!

SOO GOOD ...My only change was cooking mushrooms in with the hamburg and onion...and  hamburg was 1 1/2 pounds so I added one more egg and about tablespoon bread crumbs to hold together a little.. and baked a little longer

Excellent recipe!!!  Will make this on a regular basis.  Didn't change much at all; the only thing I did was increase the cheese on top and left everything else the same.  My entire family loved it!  I'm now passing it around at work!

Really enjoyed this.  Sprinkled a little Lawry seasoning salt and garlic salt on the meat while browning with onion and a little chopped green pepper. Added frozen corn to pan just before the meat was done. In the bowl I put 2 Tblsps. of ketchup, 2 Tblsps. of  Worcestershire sauce and the egg, mixed up and added the ingredients in the frying pan. Mixed and put in casserole dish (did not use a pie crust to save fat and calories). Made Hungry Jack Instant mashed potatoes and spread over meat mixture. Sprinkled top with Sargento 4 Cheese Mexican blend and baked for 25 minutes. Will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely the worst thing I've ever made on this site!  Just disgusting!  I even added more spices to flavor the meat, because this recipe calls for nothing except browned onions with the meat.  It was absolutely awful and I'm so upset that I chose to serve this to my family.  Save yourself the misery and just make a decent meatloaf with potatoes and corn on the side.  And if you're really craving the pie crust then make a pie for dessert and you will be much happier!

I made a few adjustments to this recipe. I pre-baked the pis hell for about 15 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also put the meat on bottom then added the corn. The meat and potatoes smelled rather bland so I added 2 more tbsp of ketchup, tsp of minced garlic, red pepper flakes, italiam seasoning, & garlic powder to taste. It came out amazing!! The only thing I'd change is I'd add more cheese to the middle of the pie instead of just having it on top of the mashed potatoes.

I was really surprisned at how good this was, and how simple.  I did add mushrooms to mine, but I feel it had little effect overall.  Very good recipe.

This is our "go to" dinner now! I make sure I always have the ingrediants on hand. It's really fast and easy to make.   I too doubled the amount of Ketchup and worcestershire, and as I hate chopping onions, I used dehydrated onions mixed in with the meat & it worked great! I also added a few spices to the meat while it was cooking, (sometimes I use a packet of meatloaf mix) as it was a little bland the first time.    Also, as others have suggested, I pre-bake my crust for about 10 minutes before putting everything together.  We also sprinkle a little cheese between each layer, which seems to make it stick together a little better.  Good reheated too!  Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

This was an excellent recipe for these colder months.  I followed the recommendations of another user and doubled the ketchup and worchestershire sauce and with the egg -- I added it in with the cooked beef and onion as not to dirty another dish.    I also used Pillsbury refridgerated pie crusts and pre-baked them ten minutes and then filled -- reducing the cooking time afterward to 20 minutes only.  I did however cook my meal at 450 degrees instead of 350 to account for the shorter cook time and it worked out nicely.  My husband really enjoyed this recipe and I think the only changes I would have made would be to add some salt and pepper to taste into the meat mixture.  We will definately make this again.

Loved this recipe!  Made a few changes.  I did not use the pie crust - recipe doesn't really need it!  I did not have any canned corn so I heated up some frozen mixed veggies and added them to the cooked beef/onion mix which I liberally seasoned with seasoned salt.  Added about 1/4 cup of ketchup and about 2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce.  Used homemade mashed potatoes with sour cream added.  Next time will add 2 eggs to the meat and maybe one to the potatoes.  Was really tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an old family favorite. EXCEPT I don't use the crust and I use taco seasoning when browning the meat. I have also used French-cut drained green beans and it's still just as good.

Very good recipe - I used 3 Tbs ketchup, but it still could've used a little more.  It was a little bit bland, but I really liked it - I think that adding more seasonings will make it great.  We'll be trying this again!

I liked this recipe. It was different. My husband and kids are so picky that supper can seem overwhelming, trying to find something the whole family will enjoy. There is nothing in this recipe that isn't liked by anyone in my family.

Great recipe, I followed the directions the first time and it was pretty good, but we knew it had more potential, so the next day I did it again, made a few changes and added some latin flavor and it was the perfect dish! I prepared the meat with spagetti sause and some sazon & oregano, I made the mashed potatoes homestyle and put more cheese between the meat and the mashed. HMMMM!!!!!

thanks!!!

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  I used frozen pie crust and instant mashed potatoes, and I upped the amount of ketchup.  It was super easy to make, but it's kind of bland.  I think that I will try this recipe again, but will add salt and a little bit of brown sugar for flavor.

This was great Alicia!  I actually had leftover hamburgers which I threw in the food processor with the onion, my own seasonings, the catsup and worcestershire sauce. I took Janices's advice and put the corn between the potatoes and the meat and used lots of good Vermont cheddar. Thanks so much!

this recipe is excellent ; easy to make and delicious. I replaced beef with chicken. I put peas after the chicken mixture ( I added 1/2 tbsp hot chili powder) and I also added shredded cheddar cheese on top of peas, then covered them with mashed potatoes and on top of it, is cheddar cheese.

I have been making this for years with frozen corn and ground moose or caribou, whatever I have on hand (we never have beef).  It is a family favorite!  A friend with a larger family doubles the recipe and lines a 13"x9" pan with pie crusts and layers it that way.  She says it works great.  I just make two pies.

I made this last night for dinner, only we didn't have a pie crust on hand so I made it more of a casserole.  Followed everything else and my family loved it, and I have a 7, 5, and 2 year old.  It is amazing to find something all three will eat.

This was outstanding!  I read the other reviews and like others I did not use a pie crust (that sounds disgusting to me) and placed the burger on the bottom of the pie plate with a layer of cheese, a layer of corn, mashed potatoes and another layer of cheese.  To give it flavor when I browned the ground beef I put Montreal Steak Seasoning in the burger with some sea salt and garlic.  I used bold A-1 steak sauce as well.  This was a HIT!!! YUM

This was Quick, easy, inexpensive, and GOOD. I always use ground turkey instead of beef, and i accidentally used the itallian kind... Still turned out great.  This recipe is pretty much fool proof.

I used flavored mashed potatoes, it was great. I also used combonation flavored grated cheese. Next time I will try adding some rotel tomatoes. This recipe is a great one and so easy.

I really enjoyed this dish, and so did my family! Although it tasted more like shepherd`s pie, it was good and filling. Everyone had seconds. I would add some pepper or other seasoning to the mix, though. Also I used 3tbsp of ketchup.

I found that 2 cups of mashed potatoes were not enough to cover the pie, also it needed more flavor. I added some garlic but would have added more of the catsup and worstershire. I'll try it again.

Nothing too special about this dish.  I rather back regular meatloaf with mashed potatoes on the side.  There wasn't too much flavor (I know I could have added) and the pie crust on the bottom was too mushy.

This was really good! I doubled the ketchup and worchestire sauce as another reviewer suggested. This recipe made enough meat for two pies so I froze half of the meat for another meal. Really good as leftovers also!

This was quite good.  I needed to throw something together quick for lunch today, and found this on the ingredient search.  For the crust I used a pat-in-the-pan pie crust recipe I found on the internet, because I was too lazy to roll a crust out.  (www.exit109.com/~mstevens/lrccookb/PATINPAN.htm)  I boiled 3 medium sized potatoes and mashed them up with a little milk and sour cream for the potatoes.  When cooking the ground beef, I added about a clove of minced garlic, and when mixing the meat with the binding mixture, upped the ketchup to 1/4 c. as others recommended.  Overall, very good, simple, and something that I always have the ingredients around for.  We will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this last night.  It was very tasty and very quick and easy, which is important to me after work.  I quadrupled the ketchup and doubled the worcestershire (I think I'll quad that too next time).  I added minced garlic to the mashed potatoes, and used onion flakes instead of real onions-made no difference in taste.  I also pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes-made a big difference! Layered meat, then corn, then potatoes and monterey jack cheese. I also did not drain the corn because the recipe didn't call for it.  I'll make sure to do so next time.  My brother liked it so well, he had 3/4 of a pie by himself.  I only gave 4 out of 5 stars because it's a great base recipe that needs a little adaptation.

Wow, not too bad.  I wanted to make a hearty meal, so I tried this one.  I added a little more ketchup and also added some chili sauce.  I put a bit of garlic in the mix as well.  The flavor was good, but still needed a bit more.  Next time, I will try using taco seasoning per suggestion.  I think it will make an excellent taco meat pie.  Thanks for a great idea for a hearty dinner.

This was SO good! I left out the crust as others have, and added some tomato sauce to the meat instead of ketchup.  I also put the meat/onions in first, then corn, then potatoes, then cheese. Great way to use up our leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes and corn!

This was wonderful!!! My husband and I really enjoyed it.  We put a little more Worcestershire sauce and a bit more ketchup in it.  Also, I put a tad more potatoes and used the extra buttery kind.  This is definitely a remake!

This was pretty good!  Made pretty much like the recipe.  Made my own mashed potatoes, put the corn on the bottom but will put ground beef on the bottom next time.  Added some salt and onion flakes to the meat (along with the small onion) and doubled the Worcestershire abd Ketchup.
To me, this is more like a Shepherd's pie than a meatloaf.....

This is super easy and a favorite at our home.  Makes lots so perfect when you want/need leftovers.  I use micro steam corn and peas for filling - and mirco steam potatoes - so it couldn't be easier and is YUMMY!

Needed something for a leftover pie crust from Christmas, and this was just the thing.  I pre-baked the crust, and used 4 tbsp of ketchup.  I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, so I used some Country Bob's Steak Sauce.  It was just a tad bland, so I'll add a little bit of mustard to the meat mixture next time to give it a little more flavor.  Other than that, it was a winner with my family.

I did not make this in a pie shell and just layered the beef mix, corn and potatoes in a 9X9 casserole dish instead of in a pie shell. I eyeballed the seasonings, but I think I must have doubled the amount of ketchup and worcestershire. To increase our vegetable intake, I added diced carrot and red pepper in with the beef mix. I served with green salad on the side and ketchup on top of the potatoes. It is a bit of work but it's a great recipe if you have a load of mashed potatoes you have to use up. I've made this about 5 times, so I will be sure to make again.

This is a really good base recipe that you can tweak according to your family's taste. I was looking for a recipe to use one frozen pie crust and this was perfect. I parbaked the crust for 10 mins but that wan't long enough. The crust still tasted a little doughy. I also cooked up a few more veggies and added spices to the meat mixture. I loved the corn layer. I also broiled it after cook time was done to get a little more of a crisp cheese crust on top. I would make this again.

I was excited about this recipe, but a little let down. It seemed a little bland, I would have liked more seasoning in the meat, to give it more of a meatloaf taste. Also didn't enjoy the taste of the pie crust mixed in. Overall it was super easy to make, and I already had everything needed to make it!

It was ok. I used the cheesy quiche crust recipe on here (which is fabulous) I added an extra egg, doubled the worcestershire and ketchup, and added 2 Tbs bread crumbs. Only had a little bit of corn, so I added peas in too. Might make again.

I love the concept of this recipe, but it needs some tweeking. I did not make mine in a pie crust, but used a pie plate and just greased it. The meatloaf section of the pie was pretty much just browned burger. Next time I will make meatloaf like i normally do, with saltines, etc. and layer it b/w the corn and potatoes/cheese.

I've made this twice now and I'm really surprised my family likes it.  It's kind of the KFC dinner bowl idea - everything together.  I use a can of golden shroom soup in the meat mixture for more moisture/gravy with peas, corn and mashed potatoes on top.  I use the premade mashies sold in stores now.  This is really easy and good.

Great Staple. Made this 3 times already. I like to mix it up. Second time I added green pepper and used pasta sauce instead of ketchup. Yummo! Third time I added 1 pkg of oniion soup mix and an extra half cup of V8 juice! Even better!!! Thanks!!

I have made this a few times. We enjoy it, and it I like it because it is easy. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. The second time I made it, I forgot the egg, and couldn't tell the difference. So now I leave it out. I do add a little more ketchup & worcestershire than called for. I also use frozen corn, and the last couple of times I have added a drained can of green beans.

The family really liked this one. I made it with ground turkey instead of beef. Added 4 tablespoons ketchup and a few healthy dashes of worcestershire. Next time I'll add the condiments sooner in an effort to get the ground turkey more tender.

Yum, I really liked this one but I ate it with ketchup, tasted much better that way.  Used frozen corn instead of canned and probably a little more cheese.  Served with Buttery Cooked Carrots (recipe from this site.)

I was looking for a recipe to use up some mashed potatoes from yesterday and this is what I decided to try.  It was actually pretty good.  I wouldn't skip the crust though--that was the best part (I used a ready made deep dish pie crust and pre-baked it 10 min).  I also used a cup of frozen corn in place of canned, and doubled the ketchup & worchestire.  Oh, and I added an egg, sour cream, and shredded cheese to the potatoes.  Then topped it off with more cheese.  It seriously took just minutes to prepare and the family ate it right up.

This was an awesome fast easy meal for my family. I used all left overs for the potatoes ( cheezy potates that my hubby made) and left over vegi's. Becuase we have a larger family and like left overs I used 2.5 lbs of hamberger, and 3 eggs, 1/4 cup of ketchup and A1 steak sauce. IT did take longer to bake as it was in a 9x13 pan, and no pie crust. Thanks for an easy tasty meal!!

Whole family liked!

I baked the pie crust first as others had suggested (jiffy crust mix) and doubled the ketchup and worcestershire sauce, also as recommended, and drained the corn (didn't see where in the recipe it said to do that but I knew it needed done) and it came out pretty good.

We had ketcup on the side to dip our bites into and my picky toddler gobbled it up so I'll keep this recipe as a definite stand by for a night when I need to have something I can whip together quickly.

Thanks!

The recipe wasnt specific. So i used a frozen pie crust. I did have it out thawing for about an hour. But all in all i cooked the pie nearly double time and the pie crust was still mush. I followed directions to a tee and found it to not have much flavor.

I forgot to add the ketchup, worcestershire sauce and egg to the meat!  A blonde moment, I guess...But it turned out really good without.  Next time I will remember.  I fried onions and garlic w/hamburger.  I also made homemade mashed potatoes and added several garlic cloves to the water when boiling.  Next time I will make it as written...I also used puff pastry as the crust, and baked the crust for 15 minutes before filling with fillings...

Good, quick (prep-wise) and easy.  I cooked the meat a day before and put extra worchester and ketchup, used hash browns instead of mashed potatoes and seasoned them with salt, pepper, parmesean and feta cheese (it's what I had on hand).  I also used frozen corn instead of canned.  Per other suggestions I layered the meat first, then the corn, then the potatoes.

I didn't eat it but my husband loved it. Didn't use a crust, just baked in a casserole dish. Also didn't have corn so I used peas, and made garlic mashed potatoes to use, which added a lot of flavor. I added oregano, parsely, and s&p in the beef mixture.

It was good, but needed some more flavor.  Next time I will use garlic mashed potatoes and more ketchup, maybe some chili sauce.  A good base to start from.

this was great, my husband absolutly loved this.  I think that I will pre heat the pie crust a litle more next time.  Like on 400 for 8 minutes would be better.  But other than the fact of putting th meat on bottom then the corn, then the potatoes, then the cheese that is how did it.  But alos I did add garlic, italian seasons, and dried onions to the meat mixture.

Yummy! I too didn't use the pie crust(used a meatloaf pan) and added about 1/4+ cup of ketchup to the meat mixture & used boxed garlic mashed poatoes. Not a drop left after dinner!

Delicious, I also added a can & a half of brown gravy to the meat which made it more moist so had to add 25 mins more cooking time but worth it

I really liked the flavour of this meat pie.  It was what I was looking for: a recipe to use up a single pastry pie shell I was trying from scratch, ground beef and ingredients I had on hand. I substituted a sweet potato but everything else was as listed. Next time I think I will incorporate some veggies which I guess would shift it from a “meat loaf” to more of a traditional beef pot pie, but I like to include/‘hide’ veggies wherever I can. Thanks for sharing!

Used 1/2 cup of ketchup, instant potatoes,  extra egg, frozen pie crust and no cheese. Also increased bake time by 10 min with foil on pie crust. I mixed in peas and corn in the meat mixture. My family loves it.

This recipe is a good place to start, but it needs more flavor. I liked the idea of making it into a pie, but the beef was kind of bland. I would also probably add more to the potatoes to kick up the flavor a notch.

I used this tonight as an April Fools joke.  No pie crust.  Skipped the corn, didn't have any.  Skipped the cheese and colored the mashed potatoes pink ;-).  It was fantastic!  Husband loved it.  Whoever made it and thought it was disgusting, should have watched what spices they added extra..because it turned out just fine here.

Easy to make dinner.  Followed the recipe exactly, but the taste was a bit bland for some of my family members.  Will definitely make again, but with 2 tbsp of ketchup and sauce to make the flavour better.  Thanks.

We love this! The only thing I do that is different is I do not use a pie crust.  I put it in a pie pan, meat first, then corn, potatoes and top it with cheese.

This was just ok for us.  I agree that the meat layer was lacking in flavor, and I more than doubled the ketchup and W. sauce.  I also added garlic powder and onion powder, but it wasn't quite enough.  For a budget meal though, this was good!  I used ground turkey and frozen corn, since we don't like canned.  I also did the potato layer half potato, half pureed cauliflower.  I mashed my potatoes with buttermilk, and to me that was the saving grace of this meal, because that's where all the flavor was!  We might try this again, but play around with the meat layer till we get something tastier!  Thanks!

This was pretty tasty. I did double the amount fo worcestershire sauce and quadruple the amount of catsup. I think it would have been too bland without it. I mixed the egg, onion and beef before I browned the meat, then the catsup and w sauce with just a few minutes to go. I didn't use a crust and i think it was just fine that way. I didn't care for the mashed potatoes I used, but that didn't have an effect on my rating. Real are always better!

Just finished eating this for supper. Yummy, all my family loved this even my nine month old couldn't get enough. I did pre-bake the crust for 10 minutes and added more ketchup. When I asked my family to assist me in rating it they all said it was a four star recipe because it was lacking in flavor.  I will prepare this dish again however, I will kick it up with more spices next time.

Wonderful comfort food. Like everyone else, I doubled the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. I laid: meat - pork - mixture (with extra garlic, s&p), thin layer of cheese, corn, mashed potatoes (with red chill pepper flakes) and moderate layer of cheese.  I also make it a two pie crust, so I cook it for 30 minutes at 425 until the pastry is lightly browned.

Great recipe! I don't think the whole thing cost much over $5.00. I didn't have any canned or frozen corn, so used red kidney beans instead.(I did sprinkle a little hot sauce on top of them) I used a 50 cent package of Idahoan garlic mashed potatoes on top and took another reviewers recommendation to double the amount of ketchup & Worcester sauce. Very yummy. Husband loved it. Quick, easy & cheap.

I of course made some changes, but overall I really like this simple dish, and my boyfriend devours it everytime I make it.  I doubled the worcestershire and ketchup and added a small amout of italian breadcrumbs, seasoning salt and pepper to the meat mixture, added in some minced garlic while cooking the beef and onions, omitted the corn altogether, and added 2 cloves of garlic in with the potatoes while they were boiling.  I also used a combination of chedder and colby and monterey jack to top it off.

I thought this was really good. I had to make some changes, like many of the other reviewers. I used frozen pie crusts (not deep dish) so I had way too much filling, so I just made two and froze one for later. I also put the corn in on top of the meat and added a little more Worcestershire and Ketchup to the meat. I thought this was very yummy comfort food and fairly cheap and easy. I will definitely be making again this winter. Thanks.

Followed suggestion of others to double the ketchup and worcestershire (since I love woozy!)  Served with glazed carrots, this was a great comfort food dish and will make again!

This recipe is delicious! My husband and my 16 month old twins LOVED IT! I am definitely putting this recipe on my meal plan again for this month. The only changes I made were putting the pie crust in the oven to slightly brown while cooking my beef/onion. When it was draining, I took the pie crust out. I also layered it, beef mixture, one can (15oz) of corn, and topped w/ home made mashed potatoes, and cheese! DELICIOUS! I may add a little bit more ketchup to the mixture next time.

My family really liked this version of sheppard's pie.  I used a deep dish pie pan, prebaked the crust and added a little more ketchup.  I also layered as follows: meat mixture, corn, potatoes and cheese...turned out perfect!

Made this twice.  First following recipe exactly except could not fit it all in.  Maybe my crust was too small.  Second time just threw corn, leftover crumbled meatloaf (Rempel's Family Meatloaf from this site), and leftover mashed potatoes on top and froze it.  Baked it a few weeks later with a sprinkling of cheddar cheese and that worked great too.

This was pretty good. Although not so healthy. :-( I have made it a couple of times and always follow the recipe exactly. I make the mashed potatoes from scratch but buy the refridgerated pie crust, so it's a pretty easy meal and goes well with a salad.

My whole family loved this.  We all went back for another serving and then my 11 yr old went back for 3rds.  my husband said it was a keeper.  I used 3 potatoes(mashed with butter, milk, pepper, salt) and I used 4 fastfood packets  of ketchup and added one tbsp brown sugar to the ground beef mixture.  I did not use a pie crust like others suggested.  I doubled the cheddar cheese on top. It was perfect.

This was a huge hit with my family; I will definitely make it again. I followed some of the suggestions in the other reviews: pre-baked the pie crust for 10 minutes; doubled the Worchester sauce and ketchup; added one tsp each of chili powder and garlic for extra spice; and put the ground beef mixture as the bottom layer.  I also added mushrooms to the ground beef and peas to the corn (frozen, not canned) just because I had them. My mashed potatoes were garlic Yukon Gold, so that added more flavor too. This was a great use of leftover mashed potatoes!

My husband and I were not crazy about this one.  I thought there were too many mashed potatoes and just nothing special about it. Reminds me of sheperd's pie, but I prefer the sheperd's pie.

We really enjoyed this although I made some changes out of necessity.  Instead of mixing the hamburg with egg, I used a can of golden mushroom soup.  I also added a half of a red pepper, a grated carrot and about 5 mushrooms all of which I needed to use up. I used the delicious Cowboy Mashed Potatoes (also from this site) and I put a can of cream corn over the meat because that is what they did on a local cooking show and I had already bought the cream corn. I think the cream corn made it a little sweet.   I sprinkled a little garlic and celery seed over the browning meat.  I know it sounds like a lot of changes and I hate it when people really deviate from the recipe and then rate it but it was just so good. Thank you for a thrifty forgiving recipe, Alicia. Oh yes, I did not use any pie crust.  I just put the meat in the casserole.

I loved it and so did my fiance - I added a little extra ketchup because I'm weird and like it, and we baked the crust a little bit before hand because we like a more crispy crust.  I used yukon gold instant mashed potatoes - and it turned out SO good.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

I gave this recipe a 3 because I found it to be dry.  I will try again but I'm thinking of adding a can of oregano/basil tomatoe soup to the meat mixture and mixing the corn into the meat mixture.  It's a great idea it just needs a little tweaking.

So yummy! Made a homemade pie crust from this site first, baked it for about fifteen minutes, then layered meat/onion mixture, then corn (sticks to mashers better) then mashers, then cheddar. I used Resers already made mashed potatoes ( keep them on hand for quick dinners, they are SO good ) will defenitely make this over and over. So delicious. We ate it two days in a row!

Made this to the letter. Good, but felt it was missing something. My husband said that if the meat had more of a gravy, then it would have been excellent. Maybe mix in some brown gravy, perhaps.

I made this for the first time tonight.  Used ground bison, instead of beef (because we prefer it), used 2 Tbsp. each of ketchup and w. sauce and omitted the mashed potatoes on the top.  We loved it!  My husband and I agreed that we would make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I appear to be in the minority here, but I didn't like this that much.  The canned corn was not good.  I did bake my pie crust for about 15 minutes before I added the meat mixture and it would not have been cooked if I hadn't.  I increased the ketsup to 1/4 cup and the worchestershire to 2 Tbsp but it still lacked something in flavor.  Not something I'd make again.

My husband and picky daughter gobbled this up!    I stirred the very well drained corn in with the beef mixture before pouring it into the pie crust, which I had prebaked for 7-8 min at 350.  It was easy to throw together for a weeknight meal.  Will make again!!

Too sweet, oddly sweet.  The corn and the catsup, probably the main culprits.  And the pie crust, maybe.  My crust wasn't cooked beforehand, so it wasn't the right consistency.  I usually like one-dish wonders, but I won't make this one again.  Lose the corn and the pie crust, and spice up the meat seasonings, and use julienned zucchini and squash, perhaps, for starters, but then that'd be a totally different dish...

This is a tough recipe for me to rate because i didn't have any. (i don't eat beef) My husband didn't like it but he is very devoted to my traditional shepherd's pie. I brought some to work and got mixed reviews. It is not as much like a shepherds pie as i thought it would be, but it's not supposed to be. It's a meat loaf pie. I thought it looked beautiful though.

yum-o i loved it husband didnt.  I doubled or tripled the worshire and ketchup added the meat and corn together.  I didnt have a pie crust and for some reason it reminded me of breakfast casserole so i put cressent rolls in the bottom of my dish and baked for 10 min and then finished it off. Very good comfort food.

Such a great recipe! I made this the other night and even the picky 3 year old ate it! The only thing I would do differently is to add some more spice to the meat, I thought that was a little blah but other then that it was great! It heats up fine the next day too. I put it back in the oven at 350 for about 15 min. Also I put the corn between the potatoes and hamburger and it all stayed together really well. Will totally make this again! Everyone loved it.

Super recipe! All kids & husband enjoyed it, it's a keeper!  I used a medium sized onion, rather than a small one & made a hot water pie crust from scratch.

When I made this I used mixed vegetables and garlic instant mashed potatoes instead and it came out wonderful! My fiance LOVED it and he was wary of the Worcestershire sauce at first! So easy and SO good! Will definitely make it again!

Tried this recipe for the first time, and I loved it! Of course, I believe I am a bit biased because anything that slaps on mash potatoes and corn is awesome. Heh. I will say, however, it is a bit bland, but I am not one for strong tastes to begin with. I didn't use pie crust, don't even need it.

This was ok, but not super.  Probably wouldn't make again because it was so bland tasting even though I doubled the ketchup and Worcestershire.

This was very good. I made one small addition, a teaspoon of course prepared mustard (Grey Poupon). My guest really enjoyed it & it makes great leftovers (reheat in oven to keep the crust crisp). I will make this again.

This was a WONDERFUL and EASY recipe! My fiancé just loved it and wouldn't stop eating it. I had a ton of leftover mashed potatoes from Easter. So, I just used this recipe to finish them off. What a great way to use leftovers!! 

One note- I didn't use the pie crust either. I didn't want to add extra calories or carbs. And I put sweet peas at the bottom of the pain instead of corn. It was great!!

Other than skipping the crust, I made this as stated. We liked it very much as a quick and easy weeknight meal. Full of flavor and   a great way to get the feeling of a comfort food without a lot of fuss.

This was a great base recipe... I didn't use a pie crust, used pork sausage instead of beef and doubled the cheese. It turned out very nice, and when I added chives to the potatoes it looked nice to serve.

I baked the crust ahead of time, added some garlic to the meat and mixed in the corn as others had suggested. I also used barbecue sauce instead of ketchup/Worcestire and it was great. I used boxed butter and herb potatoes. 
Yum!

This was just OK.  I might make again someday but it wasn't anything out of this world.  I made as is so the hamburger mixture tasted just like regular ground hamburger so if I do make it again I would double the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce like some had suggested. The mashed potato part was the best.

This was really good, I was surprised it was so good.  Like others, I baked the bottom crust first til crispy.  I mixed the corn with the meat too, why bother layering that?  I pretty much followed the directions exactly and it was great! It did need more catsup and a little extra worchestershire sauce. I used packaged cheese potatoes for the top, and only a little shredded for effect.  Thanks!  The kids loved it!

Gosh, I wish I could have liked this better. I cooked the pie crust a bit before filling it but it still had a mushy taste. I also added garlic and other seasonings to the meat mixture. I don't know, I never do well with recipes that call for pie crust! I know it's not the fault of the recipe, it's the fault of this cook!!!

I skipped the ketchup and worcestershire in favor of a little taco sauce and chopped spinach. I added a chopped garlic clove when I browned the meat and onion. Next time I think I will add some peas to the corn for more vegetables. Also, I precooked the pie crust to keep it from getting soggy. Very tasty!

I have now made this many times for my family and they all love it!  I've used both store bought and homemade mashed potatoes and either way is great!  I also layered meat, corn then potatoes on top.  I used a store bought pastry which was easy and good.  Delicious!

This was a good one. As per previous reviews, added more ketchup, garlic. I have now made with crust and without. (I like the crust, as I am a bread lover) Although, maybe need to cook crust slightly prior to putting in the filling. I did layer corn on top of meat instead of on bottom and saved a "slice" and did not put corn for my picky one. I make meatloaf all the time and this is a bit of a different take and a welcome change.

It was good but we felt it was too dry; 'bring on the ketchup'!  I loved the way the crust turned out and my family said they wouldn't mind having it again.  Overall, not WOW but OK.

My husband was apprehensive when I said that we were having "Meatloaf Pie" for dinner, but he liked it!  I should have paid more attention to the reviews.  Next time I will add more seasoning to the meat and garlic to the mashed potatoes.

WE COULD NOT EAT IT DUE TO THE PIE CRUST NOT COOKED ON THE BOTTOM. DO YOU BAKE THE CRUST FIRST. THE RECIPE DOES NOT CALL FOR THAT. I WILL NEVER EVER COOK THIS AGAIN.

This was pretty good.  I added more ketchup and that helped make it tastier.  I used instant mashed potatoes and think it would have been a lot better with the real deal.  I also forgot to put an egg into the mixture, but it still came out ok just a little bit crumbly.

I was pleasantly suprised with this recipe, it was so good. I took the advice of other revewiers and added extra ketchup and worchestshire sauce. I also added seasonings to the meat when I cooked it. The flavor of the meat was just perfect. I will be making this again. Thanks!!

Overall ok but kind of lacked flavor. Felt like adding ketchup just to bring the flavor level up a bit.

This was great. The worcestershire was a little strong for my taste so I will use less next time and possibly more ketchup instead as I will definately make again

This is okay, but just that, okay.  Not bad, but not great either.  Not sure what would be needed to make it great, but I do not believe I will be doing this anytime soon.  On the upside, it was quick and easy to make, just the lack of flavor makes it just okay.
