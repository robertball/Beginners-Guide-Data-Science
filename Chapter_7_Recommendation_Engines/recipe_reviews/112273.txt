I have made this before ... it's a great to serve with crackers and cheese.  After mixing the ingrediants though, I roll it into logs then wrap each log in plastic wrap and let sit in the fridge for 24 hours before baking.

I think this is a great recipe!  The only change I would suggest for those who think it comes out dry is to wrap the logs in tinfoil and poke tiny holes in the foil. That way some of the moisture can escape but the meat will not be as dry. It will still firm up nicely and once unwrapped and cooled for a few minutes before putting in the fridge, it will still have a great color and texture.
I have made this many times and it freezes very well.

With following the recipe exactly, the salami logs were very dry and not much taste.  Will try another recipe next time.

Very good recipe. Years ago I had a very similiar recipe but unfortunately lost it. This one is almost identical. For those who think it turns out dry here's a tip. Venison no matter what you do will always be dry! I make mine with 4 lbs venison and 1 lb beef or pork (whichever you prefer). Just helps add some fat and adds a little flavor as well!

It's good.  It's easy.  It is missing something and I'm not sure what.  Next time I might increase the garlic powder.  A big change was that with an internal thermometer, at 250 degrees, mine was done  in only about an hour.  I had wrapped a 2 foot long log in foil and punched holes in it to keep it from drying out.  Maybe since it was a smaller diameter and wrapped it was ready sooner.  It seem very moist so I raised it on a cooling rack and put it back in the oven for another 30-45 minutes.  This dried out the exterior but the inside was the right consistency.  Other than a little lacking in intense salami flavor, a nice addition to my l;ist of venison recipes.

I made this with venison and I love it! I did leave out the liquid smoke, and I ground all my peppercorns because I don't like the big chunks of pepper. I'll be making this again.

Not a favourite, edible but not as flavourful as I would like and the texture isn't very pleasing.

My family loves the flavor.  I did the aluminum foil wrap but still dry.  I will add some fresh sausage and peppercorn to the mix next time, to see if it adds moisture and zing to the flavor.  This was very easy to do!

Making it right now for the second time.  Iâ€™m using this recipe for summer sausage and exclude the liquid smoke.  I mixed a 3-1 ratio of venison to pork 225*F for 3 hours in an electric smoker using mesquite chips.  Also I stuffed it into casings.  The first batch was eaten so fast by family at thanksgiving that I am going round two now before X-mas!
