YAY! Truffles even I can make! These were great! I made an assembly line with crushed almonds, coconut, crushed walnuts, powdered sugar, and white chocolat drizzle. They came out perfectly.

Good! White chocolate is easier to work with than semi-sweet, but both are delicious. I used more Krispies than it called for, especially when using semi- sweet chocolate for white chocolate.

These were very hard to get made correctly - the problems of seizing chocolate, etc.  But, even after correcting those problems and getting around them, there isn't a lot of flavor here and they are difficult to eat.

I found this difficult to accomplish because white chocolate is so hard to melt without having it seize. I would like to try them again but I wasted a lot of white chocolate baking squares trying to get it right, very frustrating.

This was an incredably easy recipe. I used regular Rice Krispies and those worked just fine. They were a big hit.

Good, but very tricky to get chocolate the right texture.
