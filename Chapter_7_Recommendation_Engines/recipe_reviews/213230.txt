A friend and I followed this recipe almost exactly (we doubled the green onion because we love them) and it was SO good!  We were a bit skeptical about the coleslaw dressing but it added a wonderful touch of sweetness to the ingredients.  The salad was even better the 2nd day so I'd recommend making it the night before if possible to allow the flavors to meld together... YUMMY!  Thanks for sharing!

This is one of the best recipes that I have found on this site. Fabulous does not even come close to describing it! Everyone loved it and raved about it. Do not hesitate to try this. You can't go wrong. I used a frozen package of tortellini which I believe was 19 ounces instead of 18oz. the recipe calls for. I also chose to use cherry tomatoes because we prefer them over grape. The salad was easy to make, too. I used my kitchen scissors to cut up the bacon and onion so the process went quickly. I also used a full 12oz. bottle of coleslaw dressing. That's what was available and I didn't want a partial jar left in the fridge. I added it slowly to make sure I wasn't killing the consistency, but it turned out great. Bottom line here is that this recipe is also very forgiving on proportions used. Above all- if you are reading this recipe, don't hesitate to try it. My many thanks to the submitter! My family thanks you, too!  UPDATE: I can't stop making this!! This is my most repeated recipe from this site! Make sure to make it the day ahead. It is much better after the ingredients have had a chance to meld together.

This is an old recipe from Betty Crocker and I have been making it for years.  I am always asked to bring to potlucks.  The original recipe calls for 1/4 cup unsalted sunflower seeds.  These make it even crunchier.

Since posting this, I have started making a few changes.  Now, I cut the bacon up into small pieces, several slices at a time, and then just put the entire pound of bacon in a skillet and cook it together-- MUCH easier.  I also throw in my favorite spice at the end, which is lemon pepper, so I encourage you to kick it up a notch with your favorite pepper or spice too.  I love the addition of a handful of sunflower seeds.  And feel free not to use refrigerated tortellini-- you can use whatever kind of tortellini you like (as long as it's cheese!).  One more thing, I try to make varying degrees of crispiness for the bacon-- some chewy, some crispy.  Thank you guys!

Too bad it isn't possible to give 'only' 5 stars.  OMG.....this was OUTSTANDING.  I made no changes whatsoever.  Just to die for yummy!  I agree with the poster; who would have thought coleslaw dressing would have worked so perfectly.  DH agreed.  This one is a real keeper.  Go to the head of the class MostAwesomeChefEver!!

Really great!  I can't wait to try it tomorrow, can't imagine it tasting any better.  I bought pre-cooked bacon and crisped it in the microwave, worked well.

My favorite broccoli salad.  But I did tweak it a little bit.  I blanch the broccoli by throwing it into the water with the tortellini for one minute (when the tortellini is almost done) and then drain tortellini and broccoli together, and rinse under cold water to cool.  I add 1 large stalk of celery, finely diced.  I use a thick sliced applewood bacon for this recipe, and cut into 3/4 inch pieces.  For the dressing, after frying the bacon and draining off the grease, I add a little bit of water (3 tbsp?) to deglaze the bacon pan, and stir to scrape up all the tasty bits.  To this I add 1/2 tbsp. horseradish and a scant 1/4 c of bottled poppyseed dressing. This salad is a flavor explosion.

This recipe was easy to make and my guests loved it!  I did add some diced red onion. I doubled the recipe but only used the one pound of bacon and one pt of the grape tomatoes and it was fine.

What a great salad!  I used light dressing and also did not need to use the whole bottle of dressing.

This is very similar to a broccoli salad that I make.  I made this one according to the directions, but I cheated and used Hormel Bacon Pieces in the jar instead of cooking bacon.  Next time I make this, I think I will make my own dressing, the one that I use on my broccoli salad recipe: light mayo, white vinegar and sugar.  It tastes similar to the coleslaw dressing, but it's cheaper and lower in fat and calories!  A good recipe though....very tasty!!

I love this Salad!  I've tasted this dressing before on another broccoli salad and never knew what it was.  So glad the mystery has been solved.  I'll be making this salad many times this summer.  Made exactly as stated only I added 1/4 cup sunflower seeds like another reviewer suggested.

This salad is incredible! I couldn't stay out of it! I had to divide it up and "share" it with friends so I wouldn't eat the entire bowl by myself. Thanks for a wonderful new dish!!!

Made this recipe for a party. I have made lots of different broccoli/pasta salad recipes but this one is exceptionally good. Very easy to make, takes no time at all. Will definitely put this one into my recipe box. Love, love, love it.

YUM!!  This was the hit of my son's birthday party.  I made as directed for the most part but used red onion and threw in a 1/2-3/4 cup of shelled sunflower seeds(I got the idea from another broccoli/tortellini salad on this site).  I made this several hours ahead of time and it was perfect.  I had several requests for the recipe.  I will be making this again.

MADE AS DIRECTED.  iT'S THE ONLY FAIR WAY FOR THE FIRST TIME.
Hint for cooking bacon.  Place a paper towel on a paper plate, lay about 6 or 7 strips of bacon on the paper towel, cover with another paper towel and microwave for about 3 minutes.  Bacon will be crisp, no need to drain, and you can just break it up and throw away the messy paper plare and towels.  Will try the mayo/sugar/vinegar dressing next time.

This was good, the hubby liked it a lot.  The broccoli should probably be blanched, it was too hard raw.  Thanks.

Very good!  I used 1/2# of bacon and that was plenty. Instead of Cole slaw dressing, I used 1 cup of mayo mixed with 2 tsp. sugar,2 tsp. vinegar, and 1 tsp. celery seed. I took it to a pot luck and brought back an empty bowl.

I knew I was going to love this recipe from the moment I first saw it and now, after making it today, I am not disappointed.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, which I almost never do, and wouldn't change a thing.  I've already eaten 2 bowls of this and I only made it not even an hour ago!  So I can't imagine how much better it's going to taste once it's had a chance for the flavors to mix a little more in the fridge overnight!  This one is definitely going into my recipe box.  Thanks!!

This was absolutely fantastic!!! The bacon did not get soggy and we even ate it the next day. I'm not a fan of people who review recipes they have altered or changed so please know that! I did not have tortellini on hand but I did have four cheese ravioli. I was too impatient to wait till the next day so I did use the ravioli. I cut each piece into fours so it would be smaller like the tortilin- just too darn impatient!! I used Marie Callendars coleslaw- the whole jar is just about 2 cups. OH man was this good!!! Keeping, keeping!! Thank you so much!!!

I halved this recipe. To make it a little prettier, I did break the broccoli down into little flowerettes instead of chopping it. I increased the green onions to a small bunch and I used a homemade low-calorie buttermilk ranch dressing as I don't keep coleslaw dressing on hand. Great cheap base recipe I could bend up to use what I had on hand and make a quick healthier side for my family.

I just finished making it and it is delicious!! The good thing is you can make as much or as little as you like. Keeping with my "I'm a Pusher not a User" motto, and I won't be eating any of it I only made one package of the tortellini and then adjusted the rest of the ingredients. The bacon I burned because I was talking on the phone, so I didn't salvage much of that. Instead the dog got a little bacon treat. So anyway, its easy, quick to throw together and is pretty looking! :-) Great for a potluck or party or for a loved one's lunchbox which is the reason I made it.  My guy is gonna love it!

This was a huge hit at our house warming party. I would like to say that it was my skills as a cook, but lets be honest; nobody can resist crispy bacon. On the topic of bacon, I made 15 servings of this dish, nothing says home like the smell of 2 lbs. of bacon frying up on the stove.


Outside of that the coleslaw dressing was a twist. I like to make my own when I make coleslaw, but what a great way to keep it simple and really wow your guests.

Excellent...  I have made several times and it's always a hit..  I
did decide not to buy the cole slaw dressing (to expensive) but made my own using mayo, sugar, cider vinegar and pepper. I have also made adding dried cranberries and shredded cheddar cheese.  I too bought the pre-cooked bacon.  This is a great crowd pleaser...

I have made this for 2 church dinners it was a big hit. So easy to make
I also topped it off with fresh Parmesan cheese. I put the cheese in a dish next  the salad so people could add the amount they wanted.

This was a hit ...but just a little too sweet.  As I just read through the reviews I saw someone else felt the same and thought of maybe trying it with Creamy Caesar dressing ...I thought exactly the same thing ... but I may have went a little heavy on the dressing , so will try again.  Great base though!

Very good, I added the bacon at the end so that is didn't get to soggy.  I also added the whole bottle of dressing, if I didn't the salad would have been way to dry.  Everyone loved it!

This was a huge hit at my Easter table!  Everyone loved it.  I knew I would be really busy on Easter Sunday, so I cooked my bacon the day before to save some time.  I also cut it up before I cooked it.  This will be made again!

Are you kidding me? This was freakin' awesome! I used turkey bacon and about half a bottle of the coleslaw dressing - everyone loved it at our party. I think the right coleslaw dressing makes a difference too.

Just whipped this up for a gathering tomorrow.  So nice to find something that's actually better made ahead!  I like that the recipe is so adaptable.  I threw in a cup of shredded mozzarella I didn't know what else to do with and also a small can of sliced black olives.  It's a beautiful dish!  Thanks so much for sharing!  Can't wait to make it again.

This is the first cold salad I've EVER been able to get my pasta salad-phobic husband and sister-in-laws to eat.  Even my 5 year old had second helpings.  I used one green onion (personal taste) and added fresh ground pepper.  This is my new picnic favorite!

I just have to say I took this to a birthday party yesterday and everyone raved about this salad.  I was asked several times to provide the recipe.  This is a great summer salad and it so easy to make.  I cut the bacon into 1/2 inch strips and cooked the day before so the real mess was already taken care of.  I will definitely be making this again.  YUM....

This is awesome! I made it this past weekend for our annual Indy 500 party. I hate coleslaw, and just like other reviews said, with the coleslaw dressing, this is superb!  I added diced red onions instead of green and this was gone really, really quickly!!  A keeper for sure!

This was delicious!  We had some friends over for dinner and served this - it was a big hit!  The coleslaw dressing really works well with the broccoli.  I found two kinds of coleslaw dressing at the grocery store - one with celery seeds and one with mustard; I opted for the one with celery seeds, and then mixed in a little mustard when I was making this.  Served with shredded cheese and croutons for people to sprinkle on at the table if they wished.

My family loved this!  I chopped the broccoli and onions with food chopper and added Serrano peppers. I made extra dressing - used light mayo and Splenda then added cayenne pepper. Can't wait to make it again.

Yummy and easy.  I try to make everything from scratch, so I used the dressing from the Creamy Spiced Coleslaw recipe on AR.  It was quite good and if you want to add grilled chicken, you've got a meal in a bowl!!

I did the unthinkable.  I had purchased Cole slaw dressing as the recipe called for, but ended up after a discussion with my husband using a lite creamy Caesar dressing.  Also, used diced onion instead of green onions.  This recipe is fabulous.  Can't wait for lunch so I can have the leftovers.

Try this one--its very good. Coleslaw dressing was yummy! We used turkey bacon to be healthier, and I was nervous that I might be disappointed with it, but was pleasantly surprised. Probably will try the real bacon next time though.  Also, just because, I added dried cranberries to the mix, and they were a good accompaniment.

With a few modifications this recipe was a hit at Mother's Day.  I'm not a fan of store bought coleslaw dressing, so I used a creamy italian.  Which I thought was more fitting for the tortellini.  I found the recipe recommendatin of (2) 9 oz. pkgs. of tortellini to be way too low for 10 servings especially with 4 cups of broccoli.  I wondered if it was a misprint and should have been (2) 9oz. pkgs? Anyways I used about 30 oz. of pasta, 4 cups broccoli, and about half a bottle of dressing.

Took this to a Mother's Day cookout yesterday...frankly, nobody cared for it.  The flavors just don't go together well.  I think it was the dressing (I used Marzetti's coleslaw dressing, which is very good) that didn't do anything for the other ingredients, even overpowering the bacon.  It sounded really good, but just didn't pull together well.  With the cost of bacon, dressing, and the tortellini, this was not an inexpensive dish to make; I will not make this recipe again.

I just made a half sized batch of this to test it before a ladies lunch, and it got huge "thumbs up" reviews in our house! I improvised on the dressing because I didn't have any, nor the ingredients to make it, so I doctored up bottled ranch (about 3/4 c) with a splash of cider vinegar, about 2 T sugar, and about two t. poppy seeds. Worked great! I look forward to making this often in the future using the coleslaw dressing and maybe switching up the pasta. Thanks for sharing! UPDATE (5/19/14)  I have made this several times since my last review, and it's made even better with tiny cubes of cheddar thrown in, about 2 oz worth. It's a bit finicky to cut the cubes, but my husband thought I'd bought it from a caterer the first time I made it this way, which I guess is a good thing. UPDATE (AGAIN)4/9/15: if your crowd doesn't like onions (my hubs HATES them raw), try mixing in large chunks of red onion, then selecting around them when you serve. The onion flavor is still there, but the haters won't crunch down on an unwelcome surprise. LOVE this salad, as it's an especially good way to use the broccoli stalks (sliced thinly and par-cooked and shocked), so they don't go to waste.

This is awesome, and it's always nice to have a recipe that can be made a day ahead. The only thing I did that wasn't in the recipe was that I steamed the broccoli for 30-60 second to set the color to a beautiful green and to make it less tough to the bite. Also, this will serve many more than 10 people. I served it as a side to 20 people and still had lots left. However, it keeps well and we still enjoyed it later.

Great salad. I blanched the broccoli, added sharp cheddar, and used Green Goddess dressing instead of Coleslaw. Left out the tomatoes. 
Everyone loved the taste and I think it would even be great as a baked casserole. Enjoy!

This was yummy! I read some other reviews that said they didn't use all the dressing called for....I'm not sure how that's possible. I put in twice the amount, and the salad sucked it right up! It ended up being a little dry (I made it the day before), but still delicious. Next time, I'll make sure to have extra dressing on hand to mix in right before serving.

I had such high hopes for this recipe!  But it was a big disappoinment.  I followed the recipe precisely.  I will not make this again as written.  My husband, who will happily eat just about anything you put in front of him, didn't like it either.   We both agreed on the two star rating and both agreed that it was the coleslaw dressing that didn't work.  Please keep in mind that we both love coleslaw dressing and use a good quality brand.  To us, it just did not work with the other ingredients.  Thanks for posting this, though ... I'll tweak it a bit and hope for better results next time.  :-)

I thought it was delicious! I made it for a church picnic and there was only one serving left which I had the following night for dinner (even better!). I did make it the night before the picnic so that the flavors could set in. And I used the whole bottle of dressing...I didn't measure the veggies out and used the full 20oz pkg of tortellini. I gave it 4 stars because although it was good, there is room for improvemnet. Thanks for sharing :)

Made this for two gatherings in the last two weeks and it was very well received and devoured quickly.  This is a nice twist on the usual "pasta" salad.  Only made minimal changes:  omitted the green onions and added an additional 1/4 cup of the cole slaw dressing (Marzetti's).

My only change was using 1/2 the amount of bacon.  I thought the coleslaw dressing was weird, but it was really good and an interesting twist in flavor.  I've made this several times and sometimes use sundried tomatoes instead of fresh - just as good either way.

Made exactly as written, I really didn't care for the coleslaw dressing on it.  Found it way too sweet for my tastes (used the Lighthouse coleslaw dressing).  I will certainly make this again, but make my own ranch type dressing for it.  Thanks for sharing.

Really didn't like this at all.  I didn't care for the coleslaw dressing (and so did my company).  I will stick to making it with the vinegar/mayo/sugar dressing...much better!

Very good.  We liked it better the second day.  Next time I'm going to try using ranch dressing instead of the coleslaw dressing.  A quick and tasty salad, good for a summer picnic.

This was very tasty and easy to put together.  I added the entire jar of lite coleslaw dressing though. Thought it needed it. Was great for the entire week.  This was one of the few pasta salads that I thought didn't get soggy after it set a day or so.

Made this exactly as written and it deserves all 5 stars. I used Marie's coleslaw dressing which is excellent. Made it again tonight as a main meal with the addition of 12 ounces of ham and served it with crusty french rolls.

This is great.  I did add 2 teaspoons of minced garlic for flavor as other reviews suggested.  I used the whole 15 oz bottle of slaw dressing, and a 20 oz pasta. The bacon really makes this salad. It was a hit at my BBQ.

We were not fans of the coleslaw dressing.  It really didn't go well with the rest of the ingredients. I made it again with blue cheese dressing and it was very good.

Followed the recipe as written and it was great! My BF was a little worried about me using the coleslaw dressing on this, but he loved it! I blanched the broccoli before I added it to the salad.

I made this for my husband to take to work for his lunch.  I used bacon bits (no strip bacon on hand) and he liked it.  It was a good way to use up the frozen tortellini from my freezer.  I'll make this again this summer, I'm sure.

I was not sure that everything would go together and frankly I left out the onions and the tomatoes, mainly because I don't like them. I didn't think this would go, but it was one of the first dishes emptied when I brought it to my family Christmas dinner and I has almost tripled it. I am definitely making it again in the future!

Good recipe. Very tasty. Was a little nervous about using the cole slaw dressing, but I gotta say it was awesome.  Passed the recipe along to quite a few people and they were glad I tried it out. Thanks!

I'm sorry but the coleslaw dressing just didn't work for me.  I used my favorite brand, but it was very disappointing.  Because neither the tortellini or the bacon is cheap, I couldn't bring myself to just throw it away.  I ended up using my salad spinner to spin off the rest of the coleslaw dressing and used bottled ranch that I had on hand to appease my household.  Next time, I'll just make my own dressing.

Took this camping for the weekend and was well received. The bacon was a little soggy by the end of the trip so I think its best when used the same day or the next. My husband has asked for this again but with a different noodle as the 3 cheese tortellini was a little overwhelming and very filling.

WOW! I am very picky with my 5-star ratings, so when I give one, you can take it to the bank. This was a wonderful salad, and I think you could even add in some cooked chicken or turkey for a main dish (maybe even some sliced strawberries, because of the sweetish dressing.) I thought I had fresh broccoli but had already used it up, so made this dish without it, and it was still divine. I did use an 8 oz bottle of coleslaw dressing, which was the perfect amount, so if I had added in the broccoli, it would probably need more dressing. And I agree with the submitter, the coleslaw dressing is the secret ingredient!

Quick and easy dinner to put together.  I fixed the bacon as 'Bacon for the Family or a Crowd' an AR recipe in the oven.  That way I could bake the entire pound at once.  The tomatoes and green onions were from our garden.  I used Kraft (R) Coleslaw Dressing in this recipe.  Family enjoyed it and I paired with 'Balsamic Bruschetta' another AR recipe.  Thanks for sharing MostAwesomeCookEver, it is a keeper in our house.

I love tortellini in salads and have been looking for one for some time.  Glad I came across this one.   Simple ingredients and it doesn't take long to put together.  This salad has a similar flavor to the broccoli salad that we have at Thanksgiving. We really enjoyed the addition of the tortellini.

Everyone who has had this at my house has asked for the recipe. Delicious! My changes are minimal: I use 12 oz of bacon, not 16, and I don't use the whole cup of dressing (prefer Marzetti's). We just love this recipe. Thanks!

I made this last weekend and it was great. Colorful, EASY, tasted great, and was quick. Can I say EASY again? I used the 19 oz package of frozen tortellini, and everything else as listed. I was surprise at the great taste. Will definitely bring to a party, etc -- great presentation. This weekend for the holiday I may add a little shredded cheese, too.

Very tasty!!!  Loved the combination of flavors- I did double the green onion and it tasted great!  Crisp up the bacon and I also didn't use the entire bottle of dressing- didn't need it!

I’ve made this recipe several times. I usually double the amount of coleslaw dressing and add some garlic salt, celery salt, pepper, and celery seed. I make the tortellini the night before and use a cup of the dressing and let it soak overnight then add the other ingredients in the morning. I have also replaced the broccoli with romaine lettuce before and its great  that way too!

This is delicious!! I used a bunch of green onions because I love them and two didn’t seem like enough, chopped the bacon before cooking it, and blanched the broccoli before cutting it up. I also made my own favorite coleslaw dressing: 2/3 cup mayonnaise, 3 Tbsp vegetable oil, 1 Tbsp white vinegar, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp poppy seeds. It hasn’t even been thoroughly refrigerated yet but I tasted it and I didn’t want to stop eating it!!!

I was definitely skeptical about the use of slaw dressing however, it really does tie everything together nicely. The flavor of the bacon goes so nicely with the sweetness of the dressing, while the onion gives just the right punch of flavor. Overall its a very nice recipe and I will make it again.

I prep my salads into mason jars. I layered the salads in this order: coleslaw dressing, grape tomatoes, broccoli, tortellini, bacon, green onions, dried cranberries, raisins, and pumpkin seeds. I was hoping to add a spinach mix on top, but ran out of room. This pasta salad is the perfect mix of salty and sweet.

It was ok but my family was not a fan of the tortelli in the salad.
We might try it again with a different pasta.

This was even better than reviewers said!  The ingredients all complement each other so nicely.   I was very skeptical at the cole slaw dressing but it was the best!  I used Marie's Cole Slaw dressing usually found in the dairy section in the fresh produce section in the grocery store.  I didn't have any onion but that's the only change I made.  I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us and wish I had made the full recipe.  My husband asked for seconds.  That NEVER happens.  The downside of this recipe is the number of carbs in it so it will only be a once-in-a-while treat for us, or for when company comes, or for when I have to bring something to a potluck, or when I'm in a bad mood, or when I'm in a good mood.  Love this stuff!   

I forgot to add that I added my broccoli into the tortellini about five minutes before the tortellini finished cooking.  Not a fan of raw broccoli!

I've made the Fresh Broccoli Salad (I use grapes instead of raisins-very good that way!) on here and the Bodacious Broccoli Salad also on this site. I like the Fresh Broccoli Salad better but like the dressing on the Bodacious one better-less sugar, more vinegar. Anyway thought I'd try this one, still using the other recipe combinations but adding tortellini and it was good but the tortellini didn't really add anything but making it more of a complete meal. Otherwise to me it tastes fresher and better w/o the pasta. I love broccoli salads and have made it a few times since discovering the recipes recently.

I made this before and enjoyed it. I didn't get much of a reaction from anyone so I forgot about it. Recently I needed an easy side to pair with broiled garlic chicken thighs. I made this recipe but used more chives and added diced red onion. I threw the fresh broccoli in with the boiling pasta for the last forty-five seconds to make it more tender. I used Marie's cole slaw dressing and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. Also, I chopped the bacon before I fried it. I've read that it's better the next day but I wouldn't know. I doubled the recipe for twelve people and they ate it all (almost all, someone took the little that was left home). Several people asked me for the recipe, I even got a text the next day. This went right into the favorite list. I have a barbecue this weekend with a different group of people and plan to make it again. Easily five stars!

This was great, I made my own slaw dressing as I always do. I do agree with some of the other viewers that the regular sized tortellini may be too much pasta for the dish. I would be fine without the pasta and just add diced cheese instead. I left my broccoli raw and cut into small bites and left in the fridge a few hours. This is a great summer dish and how could you go wrong with BACON!

Made it just as the recipe is written, and loved it.  Getting ready to make it for a 3rd time to share with friends at a picnic.

I made this for my daughter's bridal shower and everyone raved about it!  They even wanted to take some home! I mixed my tortellini.  I bought one bag of 3 cheese and one bag of spinach ricotta; that was the only change.

I made this exactly like the recipe.  The Cole slaw dressing is sweet.  I may try ranch next time as suggested by another reviewer.  I made this on a Sunday and had leftovers.  We didn't eat at home again until Wednesday and it still tasted great.

Added fresh ground pepper to taste and sprinkled some garlic powder in to give it a little more robust flavor.  Substituted garlic chives from my garden for the green onions, too. Family loved it.

I have used this recipe many times because it is SO good! I have made it as stated exactly, without bacon, added roasted and salted sunflower seeds, added dried cranberries, added diced red onion, and unfortunately once without cheese tortellini. Such a wonderful salad. I do agree that it is even better after sitting in the fridge overnight.

I wasn't sure how the coleslaw dressing would taste with this, but was very pleased with the taste. Also, it is better after it has sat for a day. Makes a great lunch to bring for work.

This is absolutely one of the BEST salads I have ever enjoyed!! It's not only really over the top tasty, but  relatively simple to make - not much chopping involved!  I actually made the tortellini and broccoli a day prior just because I had the time.  The coleslaw dressing really does just send it into the stratosphere!

Thank you so much for this recipe! By far the best pasta salad ever! It may not be the healthiest, but my family devoured it and are ready for me to make some more. I was a little hesitant about the coleslaw dressing but it definitely made the dish.

I made this recipe spur of the moment the night before a family cook out. It was easy, quick and tasty. I added some cooked red peppers for a little kick which turned out well. I also microwaved brocoli a bit. I used light coleslaw dressing and nobody knew.

At first I didn't think this was all that great, but the next day, it totally lived up to the hype. Leaving it to combine flavors overnight is a must!

I made this as is, no changes and I loved this salad! All the flavors just went together so well. I couldn't find a big selection of dressings and went with Kraft; wonderful. This is a keeper and I will make it again.

I made this for my granddaughter's First Communion lunch and everyone seemed to really like it.  As some reviewers suggested, I added some sunflower seeds.  I had to make it a day in advance, so I saved some of the dressing to add just before serving so it would be nice and moist.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this again.

Almost didn't believe the reviews - too stellar. But I made this (with the only change being homemade coleslaw dressing) and it really is delicious. I used a pack of pre-cooked bacon from Trader Joes, so didn't even have to mess with the real thing. Very, very goo d7 came together super fast. Thanks, MostAwesomeChefEver!!

Not re-inventing the wheel here. These are all ingredients I like and use regularly. I had never used "Coleslaw Dressing" before, but I bought a bottle. Then, when I got home I noticed the first ingredient is High Fructose Corn Syrup...so I made a Lite Mayo, garlic, Dijon dressing instead. I also blanched the Broccoli since I'm not a big fan of the raw version.  This all came out quite nice.  Good and flexible recipe.

This was a huge hit!  I did as another reviewer suggested and cut the bacon with a kitchen scissors prior to cooking and it made the task much less messy!  Will make again!

I made this salad to serve with dinner tonight for my husbands birthday.  The only things I did differently was (1) I used onion powder since we do not like raw onions and (2) I did not add the bacon with all the other ingredients, as stated.    I prepared the bacon just before serving and that way it was crispy and not soggy.  My son, who is an extremely picky eater, stated he "would not be trying that salad" decided that he would after hearing others say how good it was. He  absolutely loved it and said whenever I made it again to please let him know.  Everyone raved about it and I will definitely be making it again and again.   I may even try putting shredded cheddar cheese in it too.  May even double the bacon since we really like bacon flavor.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.
