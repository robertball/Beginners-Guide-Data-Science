I liked this soup a lot. I wasn't sure at first, but it grows on you, you have to give it a try. It was easy to make, pureed nicely. And what's best it was very satisfying. 
I made minor changes:
1) to make it vegetarian I used seasoned water instead of chicken stock. a veggie stock would work as well.
2) added basil
3) served with a dab of unflavored yogurt in the middle (if you love sour cream as much as I do, this is a nice substitution to avoid heart attack)
4) topped with fried mushrooms (seasoned with salt, black pepper, parsley flakes and garlic powder)  This adds a bit of a kick and crunch :)

I used water instead of chicken broth, and soy milk instead of cow's milk.  Instead of pureeing this smooth, I left it chunky, the way my family prefers!  This is a "comfort" food.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really quite good....very few ingredients and all I had on hand...fresh broccoli a must. I used fat free/low sodium chicken broth and fat free half and half instead of the milk. Pureed in batches in my food processor and served with red hot pepper flakes on mine. Very hearty and healthy with all of the broccoli and all of the fat free ingredients. I really enjoyed it and it was super quick to make. Thanks!

Unique flavor. I enjoyed this. FYI it is also tastey if you add diced leftover fried chicken

This was really good but it was too thick for me, next time I will use more liquid.

Excellent soup....I added about a cup of shredded chicken and 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3 (medicinal purposes).  Also use evaporated milk instead of non-fat milk. 

The combination of the broccoli, onion, & garlic all complimented each other. 

I both shredded the chicken  and pureed the broccoli in a food processor before cooking.  This left little chunks of tomatoes.

I had 1 cup of frozen has browns leftover from Christmas...this was also tossed in.

I cooked all in a slow cooker about 3-4 hours. 

Will I make it again....you betcha!!!

What a wonderful soup!  I used the fire roasted, diced tomatoes, and I did not puree the soup.  This is simply a personal preference as I like the texture.

7.10.19 .... 'Hate to be the party pooper - & maybe it'll grow on me by tomorrow - but this didn't do it for me today.  'Only sub was a can of Rotel.  The directions are kind of odd.  There wasn't enough liquid to come close to covering the broccoli & cooking it that long just didn't make sense to me.   I blended & now have a blender to clean for a soup that I hoped had some magic like some other recipes with simple & few ingredients do.  'Maybe I missed something or it's just me.

I hate tomato soup, but I thought I might like this with broccoli in it.  LOVE IT.  Used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes with basil because I didn't have diced tomatoes, used a sweet onion, 1% milk, and wow.  This is what I want to eat with grilled cheese sandwiches.

I followed the directions exactly, using a Vitamix blender. I did include the stalks, pared and chopped.   It did not come out chunky, as pictured.  It was scrumptulously pur√©ed!  I added pepper only at the end; additional salt was not needed.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will add this one to my collection and definitely make it again, especially  coming into the colder seasons.

what great flavour and a great way to get your veggies.  I used to say I don't like cooked broccoli, I like it now!
