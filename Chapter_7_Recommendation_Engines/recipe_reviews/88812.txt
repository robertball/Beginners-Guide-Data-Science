I made this last weekend for company and it was a hit.  Here are some of the things I altered though:  I used frozen mango instead of fresh (less work peeling and chopping, also adds to the frozen elements). I also made a simple syrup and added about a jigger of that to the mix to add a little sweetness, as the mango nectar isn't that sweet.  I never use triple sec, just a splash of oragne juice and Rose's sweetened lime juice.. buzz away in the mixer with plenty of ice and you're seconds away to happiness in a glass!

VERY GOOD..and very MANGO tasting! I didn't have triple sec..so I used simple syrup with orange zest instead.  Also, I freeze the Mango Nectar in ice trays...makes it more slusshy!

I Love mango. I LOVE Margaritas. O M G this was spectacular. I used Patron gold and Grand Marnier because that's what I had on hand. De-lic-ious !

Made this, omitting the fruit juice - felt it was plenty sweet already.  Was quite nice initially but the taste became a little cloying after a while.
Makes a nice change from the usual margarita and was handy to use up some mango pulp I had.  Grandma thought it was very good!
***
Also tried this as a slushy - left out the ice cubes and froze it until slushy, spooned it into a margarita glass and then poured over some soda water - was good that way!

Did not peel the mango-just lazy.  Used a whole key lime instead of the Roses sweetened lime juice-great flavor!.  Did not add mango nectar.  Added more ice.  I don't like things too sweet.  I liked this a lot!

I personally liked this recipe, BUT it wasn't suitable for the misses. So, I doctored this recipe adding 1 oz. more of Tequilla, 1/2 oz. more of Triple Sec, 1 oz. of cointreau (orange liqueur), 1.5 oz. more of lime juice, 6oz. instead of a 1/4 cup of mango nectar, 3 tsp. of sugar, 3 cups of crushed ice, and 1 cup of water. She's not much of a drinker so this waters down and sweetens the recipe and fills up a blender for a party. Enjoy!  :)

This is a delicious mango margarita, a great summer treat, I often make this. But be sure, you mango is ripe enough or use canned mango, otherwise, you feel lack of flavor.

Awesome drink. Perfect for the backyard dinner I made for my husband. I served with fajitas, mexican rice, grilled corn and the best margarita recipe I've come across. He loved these....thanks!!!

These were great! I used both fresh mango and frozen mango pulp, in order to have some freshness to it, but also to save a bit of time. I made it with a silver tequila and Patron Citronge. I actually forgot to add the lime (oops!), but it was still great and everyone agreed, even the people who don't like margaritas. I did make them a bit on the strong side, but I was able to "water" it down a bit with some extra mango pulp for those who aren't lushes like me. =D  Will make again.

Delicious. Would best be served after a light meal, almost as a dessert. If you like to drink a lot, don't drink this, it is too filling!

Very good! I used Rose's sweetened lime juice & used cointreau instaed of triple sec. I aslo added quite a bit more ice. I wish I had used frozen mangos though so I wouldn't need as much. I used all the mango nectar but it still wasn't quite sweet enough so I added a bit of raw sugar...it added a nice depth of flavor to the sweetness. Thansk for a very enjoyable recipe...this one will become a classic!

It wasn't great.  It needed some sweetness to it and the thickness of it was unappealing.  Also, the tequila was very strong (I added it after).  We won't be using this recipe again.  Thanks.

Rediculously strong - lots of ""pulb" to trigger your gag reflex. Even the watered down version posted below is definitely a heavy drinkers drink. I love it but no girl could stomach it.

Very good..I mixed in the tequila last for a stronger taste. Blending will dillute tequila.

Made this for someone special and we both loved them.  I have not met a margarita that I haven't liked but this was so refreshing and different to enjoy sitting out on a perfect sunny day.  I will make these again for sure.

I've had mango juice sitting in the pantry and been trying to find a good recipe for it.  I bought my mango juice at Dollar Tree!

I doubled the mango juice and had to subsequently add more tequila to get this one to taste better.  It tasted pretty bland without.

Hey this is pretty good...I didn't have any mango juice so I added a tiny bit of sugar (the tequila has quite a bite!) and it turned out great!
