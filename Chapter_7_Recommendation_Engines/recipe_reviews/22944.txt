YUMMY!!  I needed some extra icing for those refrigerated cinnamon rolls (they never come with enough icing for me) and this was great.  I didn't add the milk and cut the recipe in half, cause I didn't have that many rolls.  Very quick indeed.  Thanks Lisa.

I cut this in half and used butter instead of margerine and used a full teaspoon of vanilla. This worked out perfectly. Half a recipe was just right for twelve cinnamon rolls.....maybe just a touch overkill, but the family will love that. ;)

I used this as the frosting for my pizza parlor cinnamon bread sticks. Super easy and very delicious. EDIT: I had some leftover from this and used it to dip strawberries. It was wonderful. I bet it would taste good with other fruit as well.

I loved it! It was perfect! It was sweet with a good amount of a cream cheese taste. Goes nicely with the 90 minute cinnamon rolls.

I made just a small amount of this recipe to drizzle over Orange Cake, also from this site.  It is very good and I wouldn’t hesitate to make it again for cinnamon rolls or other cakes/coffee cakes.  This, in my opinion, is better than your standard confectioners sugar glaze, due to the richness the cream cheese provides.  This worked beautifully for me and was just what I was looking for.

Perfect!  Not overly sweet or gritty.  Made plenty, too!  I subbed maple extract for the vanilla.  I also used soy cream cheese.

This was just Ok. The sweetness overpower the cream cheesey taste that I had hoped for. Not bad if you really like sweet with a hint of cream cheese.

This is some seriously yummy icing that is more like frosting. I've never been satisfied with the runny, too sweet homemade cinnamon roll icing, so this rich & creamy recipe is the perfect solution! Don't bother halving it if you don't think you have enough cinnamon rolls to cover. You'll want extra!

I made half this recipe and still got a lot of icing. I read the reviews before I made it and decided to follow the recipe exactly as written. I am so glad I did because it turned out perfect for my taste. It had just the right amount of sweetness with a slight tang from the cream cheese, nothing overpowered the other. I made it to have with slices of Apple Nut Bread (recipe also on this site) and I cannot wait to use my leftover icing on another baked good. Thanks for sharing.

I very rarely write reviews but I just made this icing and OMG! It is SO good. I cut the recipe in half because I only have 9 rolls. I used neufchatel cheese after reading some of the reviews about the cream cheese flavor being overpowering. I also slightly reduced the amount of confectioner's sugar by 1/4 cup (to 1 1/4 cups). I have never been able to get my 2 1/2 year old to eat a cinnamon roll with icing until today.
Definitely a keeper!

This icing is absolutely delicious!  Even my finicky husband loves it, which is saying a lot.  The only change I made was to substitute unsalted butter for the margarine.  I used it both on cinnamon buns and a banana cake.  It was great on both and is so easy to make.  It tastes so good that I could eat it by the spoonful!

My quest for the perfect cinnamon bun icing has come to an end. This is amazing! It definitely reminded me of Cinnabon icing. I made half of the recipe, and still had a lot left over. The only change I made was using butter instead of margarine. I used the leftover icing as a "dip" for monkey bread, and it was delicious! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I used this for the frosting on my homemade cinnamon rolls and it was great!  A hit with everyone who eats it.  This recipe does make enough for two batches of cinnamon rolls, so bake away or cut the recipe in half.

I liked the balance between the cream cheese and the sweetness. I used butter instead of margarine and beat the  out of it. It came out nice and fluffy and made more than enough for 24 buns. I left the milk out because I liked the thicker consistency without it. It went great with pumpkin cinnamon buns.

Wow....waaaay too much sugar, and this icing had waaay too much left over...If I ever decide to try it again (not likely), will use 2 oz cream cheese, and 1 cup sugar. even then it might be too sweet.

Good base recipe, but calls for far too much sugar for my tastes. Tasted perfect after adding just one cup of confectioner's sugar to the rest of the ingredients, but then I added a half-cup more sugar (trying to stay somewhat true to the recipe) which made it too sweet and really cut down the delicious cream cheese taste. Next time I will stick with the one cup of sugar.

This was a good cream cheese icing for warm cinnamon buns. I have tried over 30 recipes to try and find the perfect icing and this is almost there.  PROS-Spreads easily over warm buns; easy to make while buns are baking; most us have these ingredients at the ready. CON-(there really is only one and it is personal preference) The flavor has a very strong cream cheese taste.  I like cream cheese frosting but I don't want to feel like I am eating a bagel.  I will try cutting the cream cheese in 1/2 next time.

Really good and easy. I like more of a cream cheese flavor so next time I may increase the amount of cream cheese and reduce the powdered sugar.

This is a wonderful icing.  Very tasty!  I have found it hard to find a icing that doesn't taste to buttery,  and this one is excellent.  The best I've ever made for certain :)

Yep! Just as delicious as you would think it would be! I didn’t put the full three cups of sugar because I knew my cinnamon rolls needed a less sweet icing and I was right! Sooooo good! Made a lot... I frosted 30 cinnamon rolls and still had a ton leftover.

Perfect recipe.  I cut all the ingredients in half  and had enough for both a 13 x 9 pan and a 8 x 8 pan of cinnamon rolls.  I didn't want it piled on too thick.

Wonderful thick frosting/icing for cinnamon rolls or other sweets,!  Made 6 dozen medium sized rolls , doubled the recipe here and have lots left to frost sugar cookies (basic sugar cookie but crushing pepermints into the remaining frosting and adding colored sugar for festive touch!)

Loved it. Though I didn't have any powdered sugar the icing still turned out great. My mom especially liked it because she'd been craving cinnamon buns all week.

OMG!! This recipe is to die for good. I was so scared to add all of the sugar and you might be too but DON'T BE!!!!! It is far better than the store bought stuff and if I could give it 10 stars I would!

I did not have any cream cheese so I used Ricotta cheese and it turned out so smooth and tasty! Healthier too! I halved the recipe but still used full teaspoon of Vanilla. This is definitely a recipe to keep on file.

Absolutely perfect. My family always gets Cinnzeo buns for Christmas morning, but I made buns with this icing instead. My family said this icing was better!  I will absolutely make this again.

I substituted neufchatel cheese to make the cream cheese taste less overpowering and keep the same consistency.  I used this recipe over some cinnamon rolls I took to an early morning tailgate and everyone raved.

This recipe made about eighteen ounces of icing. i substituted olive oil for margarine and used organic confection sugar and unsweetened organic soy milk.  This would have been a great recipe if it wasnt for the fact that it was TOO SWEET! Something told me to stop at two cups but i wanted to follow the recipe completely. Also it came out a bit lumpy so there were balls of sugar in the frost. Also it was really hard to stir. If i were to follow this recipe again then I would use less confection sugar and mash it before i add it to the mixture.

Delicious! I had a late-night snack attack and used the icing on a tortilla shell, adjusting the recipe for a single serving.  I added raisins and cinnamon, wrapped it up, and put it in the toaster oven for 5-10 min on 350 degrees. Definitely hit the spot!

It turned out great. It made so much that now I need more cinnamon rolls. I love the cream cheese flavor so I added 12 oz of cream cheese instead of 8 oz.

Super yummy and super easy to make! I cut the receipe in half and that was plenty for a batch of cinnamon buns with plenty left over. I used an hand-held electric mixer and it was done in 60 seconds!

This icing is amazing... I prefer to put it in the fridge for a while before spreading it on the buns (usually make the icing before the buns and allow the buns to almost cool before serving).  I also add about 1/2-1 teaspoon of orange extract.  It's just a HINT of orange, and it tastes AMAZING with the cinnamon.  I use my favorite roll recipe: 90 Minute Cinnamon Rolls.  I definitely recommend that recipe, and this!!!

Very good, works 'as promised'.  My co-workers are nearly forcing me to bring back the cinnamon buns I made using this recipe, and the Best Basic Sweet Bread recipe on this site.

I have tried adding a little lemon juice (and more icing sugar), and it worked too.

Very quick, easy, and delicious recipe. This recipe really does make enough icing for 20 cinnamon buns. So, you might want to cut it in half if you have less.

Love this icing.  But too sweet for me, I like to taste more of the cream cheese so I only add 1 1/2 cups of icing sugar.  And I like to you real butter.  But overall, the best I have ever had!
