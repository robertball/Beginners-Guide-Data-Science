What was left out was to first peel, core and chop the chayote then boil for 10 minutes. Drain chayote and place on paper towels to absorb the water. Heat oil in skillet until very hot. Add potatoes then add the drained chayote and fry for 10 minutes stirring often. Lower heat to medium, add onion, chicken and garlic and cook for another 10 minutes stirring occasionally. Add salt and pepper to taste. Very good. But boiling the chayote first saves a lot of time because it takes longer to cook than the potatoes.

Really this is more of a 4 star recipe, I just thought it was too good to let it get lost at the bottom of the list because of the other rating that was only quibbling with instructions.  You just need to cut the chayote smaller than the potatoes to make it cook in the same time.  There was a lack of flavor though, if I end up with chayotes again I will probably use this recipe again but roast the garlic and add some chicken bullion.

A simple recipe using chayote which I had a hard time figuring out how to use.  I tried the recipe both with pre-boiling and w/o.  Both ways worked out for me.  Much more flavor than anticipated.

Good, simple recipe! I live in Mexico and was just given a bunch of chayote. I needed a good "quick" recipe. This fit the bill. Was glad to see the suggestions to boil the chayote first. If you peel chayote while raw, wear rubber gloves as it can cause your fingers to go numb.

I liked this. The squash does take longer than the potatoes so cook that a bit first and then add potatoes, cook a bit and then add chicken and onion. I did top it with a ketchup as the recipe submitter mentioned.. without it I think it needed seasonings but the ketchup was good with it. I used a banana ketchup

I made this tonight, and the family gave it rave reviews.   This is the first time we've had potatoes in a dish of this type, and it worked out quite well!  

I made three alterations:

1. We had no Chayote, we used Zucchini and Star Squash instead.

2. I seasoned the chicken with organic vegetable seasoning blend.

3.  I seasoned the vegetables with powdered ginger, ground cardamom, and 'Emeril's Original Essence' spice blend, along with some fresh ground pepper and salt as the recipe called for.

4. I used double the garlic called for.

Overall, great recipe and will be part of our regular rotation now!

I am only giving four stars because I changed the recipe so much, I'm not really sure what the original one would be like! In browsing for an idea for what to do with some leftover ham, and a chayote squash, I found this. So -- I halved the recipe and used my one portion of leftover ham -- it was really very good, very easy, and I'll remember this for making good use of some leftover ham in the future!

I made this without chicken, and opted for more of a vegetarian meal. I also used sweet potatoes instead of regular, and this added to the overall cooking time. I could have diced the sweet potatoes a little smaller to decrease cooking time. I laid it over a bed of Israeli couscous.  This was super simple, and I was even able to make my 2 boys food (something that was faster because they were hungry). I would totally make this again!

This was a big hit in my house, and when the chayotes look good, I pick them up - so it's a fairly regular dinner here.

Found this while looking for a chicken and squash recipe.  Had to change it to what I had on hand which was a butternut squash.  We enjoyed it.  Will definitely  make it again.  I also froze part of it.  Hopefully it will turn out good.

In all fairness, I am not a big chayote fan so I was hoping this recipe might change that. Unfortunately it didn't.  While Hubby liked it, I thought it was just too bland.

Love this dish but instead of chicken I use Italian sausage along with Kabasa sausage
