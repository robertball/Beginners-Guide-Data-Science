A truly wonderful pizza. The sauce was perfect. I added some broccoli florets to add a bit of crunch and it was a nice touch. Next time I will add the green onions at the very end of the baking time, though, because they burned a bit.   Made with 'Jay's Signature Pizza Crust' from this site. My family loved this pizza and keeps requesting it--be sure to give it a try!

It was very good.  Next time we will add chicken and artichoke hearts and it will become our favorite pizza - Garlic chicken from Papa Murphys!!!  We loved it

I was looking for something different pizza-wise and this hit the spot.  Great flavor combo.  I used homemade crust (which makes any pizza better!) and black pepper instead of white. It probably would have tasted similar with mozzerella, but the montery jack was a nice change.  Seemed a little greasy, but I guess that's to be expected with so much bacon and cheese - but that's also the reason it was oh so good!

This is a delicious pizza.  The sauce gives it a rich gourmet flavor that rivals some of my favorite pizza joints.  I added some chicken, and some additional veggies, but no matter how you arrange your toppings it's a great pizza.

Yum! I used raw pizza dough bought from the bakery section of my grocery store. I was looking for something different then the usual red sauce, white cheese & pepperoni, and this was great. My husband and I both really enjoyed it.

YUM!!  Good out of the oven and good the next day!  I used mozzarella as that is all I had, but I don't think it made a difference.  Nice pizza recipe for a change from the usual.

What a great idea for someone who is not a tomato sauce fan.  I loved this pizza, although it is a bit rich.  I added sauteed mushrooms and used mozza instead of monterey jack and sprinkled the fresh green onions on just before serving.  I made a whole wheat version of the Master Pizza Dough from this site for this pizza and we loved it.

This pizza is awesome! Very flavorful. The only change I do is I use mozzarella instead of monterey jack and I make my own pizza crust using the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe from this site. The two recipes combined make either one thick crust, heavier pizza, or two thin crusts.

I made two, one exactly as shown in the recipe which turned out ok. I discovered that the chicken concentrate I used was more powerful than superman, that plus strong garlic accounted for the just OK result. the second I made with half of the chicken concentrate and half of the garlic. The results are so much better when adjusted for local products. I added shredded chicken breast and its pure magic.

This pizza was great! I didn't have white pepper, so I added a mix of red pepper and black pepper instead. Tasted great heated up for lunch the next day as well.

This pizza was AMAZING! I could've eaten the whole thing by myself! I made the crust with Pillsbury's thin crust and it was so yummy. Thanks for sharing!

The sauce was really good.  I did alter it a little.  I didn't add the dicd onions, and I added some prepared pesto.  I also used it with pepperoni pizza and it was fantastic.

Could not give enough stars for this! We absolutely love this pizza! I made about 5 different pizzas from this site including: Reuben Pizza, Chicken Fajita Pizza, Philly Cheesesteak Pizza, Barbecue Chicken Pizza, and this one- I got requests from every guest for all the recipes!

I made as is and it was perfect!  But I might try adding a little grilled chicken as well next time to make it meatier.

A new favorite at our house!  My husband made the crust himself and the rest was perfect.
