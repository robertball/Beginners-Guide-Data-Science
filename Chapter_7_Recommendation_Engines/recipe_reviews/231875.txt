This was so easy and delicious. I toasted the bread first, and since I had no mayo or arugula, I used yogurt and baby spinach. Yum, I will definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe! It was so easy and amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. This recipe is so good i would make it anytime day or night.  Arugula is the perfect combo. Great job!

I LOVE this sandwich!  Of course, with the garlic and mayo as the base, how couldn't it be yummy?  I had this for a late breakfast this morning, and I may just have to make another one for lunch.  I scaled this down to one sandwich leaving the dressing for the arugula for two.  This was very yummy!

Super tasty, would skip the olive oil on the arugula next time and I toasted the bread to add a bit of a crunch.

07.28.17 ~ YUM! Delicious breakfast.  I downsized to only make one serving.  I didn't have arugula, but I did have Romaine that I cut very thin.  I liked the lemon mixture that was stirred in the lettuce.  It added just a little zip to the sandwich.  Quick, easy and worth repeating. It also makes for a pretty presentation.

This is one of the most flavorful combinations we have come across. We chose Francese rolls lightly sprayed with olive oil and warmed in a toaster. Rest of the recipe is a piece of cake and fantastic! Thank you for creating this

Man, this was SO good! Since I was making it just for myself, I scaled it down, using 1 egg and 1 cup of arugula. I used a slice of multi-grain bread that I had on hand which I toasted first. Great for late breakfast, lunch or even dinner! This is a restaurant-quality dish that is so simple to put together, and I'll definitely make it again!

I toasted the bread---I do not recommend. It dried it out too much. Maybe lightly toasted but that's all.  Delicious blend of flavors.

Great base recipe! It's easier to eat if you toast the bread before assembling. I've played with different combinations...chorizo & watercress, chèvre & kale, mushrooms & rainbow chard. All taste great with the arugula, garlic, mayo & egg as the base. Yum!

Deelish! Quick for Breakfast, Lunch, Brunch or Dinner! Add some fruit afterward, and you'll be satisfied. Wine required for brunch and dinner.

Mmmmmmm.....quick and yummy recipe.  I put mine on a slightly toasted English muffin since that's what I had on hand and topped with a little grated parmesan.

This was good, I followed others and toasted the bread and skipped the oil for the salad and poached the egg to cut back on calories,but still tasty.

I had to make this with gluten free bread so I'm sure that took away from the flavor some. I tried this as directed and it was ok but then the second time added jarred pesto to the arugula mixture (plus the squeeze of lemon) and also sauteed some sliced Roma tomatoes for a minute and put on underneath the arugula mixture and really liked that. The Mayo might not even need the garlic if you use pesto as I did. Nice vegetarian option.

This is my favorite thing to do with arugula!  It is wonderful.  I make it exactly as stated.  It does give me garlic breath for the rest of the day, but it is worth it!

What a great little recipe! I used Ezekiel raisin bread, toasted it and spread it w the garlic mixture over two pieces of bread instead of one. Put the salad, olive oil, lemon juice mixture down on the bread and added an egg on each slice! We had two eggs each. It was a meal for my husband and I that we will do often! Great job. Thanks!

I sprinkled some garlic and herb feta cheese to ours. It was really good and super fast! I like my egg a bit more cooked so I flipped it and cooked the other side a bit.

Very tasty! We lightly toasted sourdough bread before adding the rest.. also added a piece of pancetta to each :)
