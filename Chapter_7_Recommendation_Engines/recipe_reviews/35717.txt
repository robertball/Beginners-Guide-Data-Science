Iwould give a higher rating if the texture was smoother, the flavor was great though !!! I will juice the orange next time instead of just peeling and putting it in so the texture will be nicer , great combo of banana and orange, will make again !

This was a little too sweet for me.  I did not use the honey that it calls for either.  I might try it again with plain yogurt.

Pretty good. I used two mandarin oranges,
rather than navel.

Made as written, this was thick like ice cream, not a smoothie. It wouldn't pour out of the blender. I added two cups of milk to make it a smoothie. It was also extremely sweet. The two frozen bananas would make this sweet enough on it's own. The honey takes it over the top. The orange and raspberry flavors were lost in this recipe. The only flavors that come out are nutmeg and banana.

I agree with other reviewers, this was WAY too thick, I had to eat it with a spoon.
