I've made vegetables this way before, except that I marinate the veggies in the italian dressing for the whole day while I'm at work.  Then when I get home I pop them into a grill basket and grill them until they get nice grill marks, and then toss them the the cheese and maybe some balsamic vinegar.

Fantastic! Was making this for just my girlfriend and myself so I used 2 Zucchini, and one of each pepper. Added low-fat Italian dressing (the normal kind looked too oily) until it was lightly coated, and did the same with fresh parmesan, not the kraft stuff. Also added a very small amount of course chopped onions to the veggies.

Simple & delish.  Like others, I marinade in dressing first before grilling.

What could be easier? These are delicious, a real favorite at backyard BBQs. I did add mushrooms, yellow summer squash and tomatoes, and substituted green bell pepper for some of the red and yellow bell pepper. Very colorful. They were even good the next day, reheated.
