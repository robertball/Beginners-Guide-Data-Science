The best veal I've ever had. I made a few changes....didnt have any asparagus...and didnt use the red peppers. I used 2 packs of veal scallopine (about 8 pieces),egged,breaded and fried them. Transfered them to a baking dish and layered them with procuitto and provolone cheese. I made the wine sauce with one whole pack of white button mushrooms sliced and used beef broth instead of the chicken broth....thickened it slightly with cornstarch. I placed a small amount of sauce upon each piece of provolone(which was ontop of the veal) and covered the pan with foil and baked for about 15-20 min. on 300 degrees until the cheese was melty and bubbly. Served with more of the mushroom wine sauce on top. The veal was so tender and delicious! Hubby loved it. This is a true keeper. It tasted like I went out to eat at some fancy restaurant!

Excellent recipe! Not as time consuming as I anticipated but I did make some changes and they turned out great!  First, I decided to layer the provolone, prosciutto, and asparagus, instead of making pockets and baked to melt the cheese. I sauteed the mushrooms with the onions and roasted peppers, not separately. I made the sauce as directed, then, I added 1/2 cup marsala wine with some cornstarch to thicken.I added some butter at the end to glaze the sauce. I then poured over the cutlets and served. Do NOT salt the sauce, as the proscuitto is salty enough. Delicious!

Made this tonite with Chicken instead of veal, and it was amazing! Everyone loved it!  I added more asparagus and deleted the mushrooms (not a big fan of them) but it was wonderful!  I will definetly make it again, and will definetly do it with veal!! Thanks for the great recipe, I can't wait to put it on the "rotation"!

This was really good!.  I made a few changes...I only had thin veal strips so I seasoned and breaded them and browned them seperately.  I lined the bottom of a baking dish with the strips then did the layers of chz, prochuto, & asp. w/ more strips on top.  I didn't have roasted red peppers so I used a reg. red pepper and it was great.  I reduced the sauce a lot and then drizzled it over the meat and baked for 1/2 hour.  My husband couldn't get enough!!!

I took a shortcut -- the original recipe just sounded too time-consuming.  After breading and frying the cutlets, I placed them in a baking dish, topped them with the proscuitto, asparagus (partially cooked) and cheese.  Baked them for about 15 minutes.  I didn't let them cook in the sauce because I figured they would become soggy.  Made the sauce as directed and topped the stacks with the sauce and served it over pasta.  Restaurant quality.

I have made this at least a dozen times, trying it tonight with chicken cutlets instead of veal. I always use 4 spears of asparagus instead of 3 and roll the cutlets instead of making packets, it is easier to handle and comes out just as good. Last time simmered chicken thighs in the leftover sauce with a little more wine, they were excellent and it is a cheap follow up uses up the sauce and the thighs are very inexpensive. Usually serve the recipe with creamy augratin potatos (from this site)

EXCELLENT!  A bit of work, but can be made ahead then cooked when ready. The sauce is wonderful and could be used in other ways.  One short cut I have used is to lay the Aspar., etc in a layering to cook rather than making the packages.  Saved some time, but both ways are excellent

Great recipe!!  I am already thinking about how many different variations I can do with this!  I omitted the mushrooms (not a fan) and the proscuitto (didn't have any) and still thought it was to die for! Thanks for sharing, I'll be using this alot!

Better than 5 stars!!!  I made this for a special occasion dinner party and my guests said it tasted like it was made in a gourmet restaraunt.  It takes a while to make but well worth it!!!

This is truly delicious.  Even my three small children enjoyed it.  I used veal scallapini filet for them with only one asparagus spear.  I'm not sure they even knew it was there.  My husband gobbled his up and then waited for the children's left overs. (there weren't any)  He immediately suggested I make this again.

Followed the recipe to the letter.  My guests all gave this a thumbs up but I think I can improve on it the next time with white wine instead of red, add in a half can of cranberry sauce and decrease the amount of both wine and broth by half.   All in all it's an impressive dish... But, it's labor intensive and expensive to make.

Family thought this was outstanding! I removed veal from pan after browning,as it was thin,  then prepared the other ingredients separately in the same pan and reduced the mixture a lot; put cutlets into a a glass pan then poured sauce over then baked.  Baking time was not nearly the 30 minutes as listed.

I'm sorry! I really wanted to like this. I really like all the ingredients and so I thought this would be a home-run, but, I just thought all the different flavors were really overwhelming and also it wasn't very aesthetically appetizing. Thanks anyway!

Very good and surprisingly not as difficult to make as I thought it would be.  I served with homemade mac and cheese and fresh string beans.  I gave it 4/5 because I would have liked the wine sauce to be thicker.

I followed the recipe exactly. I was torn on my grading, because even though the veal was terrible (I agree that the provolone was overpowering, and the "breading" ends up being more like a layer of bread pudding), I will make the mushroom wine sauce again.

This is by far the most unappetizing thing I've cooked from All Recipes.   It makes no sense to bread and brown packages and then add 2 cups of liquid.  The prosciutto totally overrode the flavors of the asparagus and  provolone.

This is one of the most delicious dishes I've ever had. Well worth the time spent preparing this meal. Next time, I may simmer the mushrooms seperately and spoon a very tiny amount of the wine+broth mixture onto the veal before cooking instead, to preserve the breading a bit more.

The flavors are really strong; it's a really filling dish. I liked it, but didn't absolutely love it, and no one really cared for the prosciutto. After it comes out of the oven it tastes more like bacon.

Fabulous taste and presentation. I did think a total of 8 ounces of veal per serving was too much so I chose the stacked version with only one 4 ounce veal cutlet

This recipe was excellent and very easy to follow. I did add more wine/chicken broth to have extra to pour over the linguine! I purchased the veal in wider and longer strips and then added filling, and just folded the veal piece over. My boyfriend loved this dish. It is definitely a keeper in my book.  Am thinking about trying this with chicken for those who dislike veal! Thanks again for a great recipe.
