Wow!  This is delicious!  As other reviewers suggested, I used 1 cup of melted butter instead of the 3/4 cup and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  I think that this really made a difference in the yumminess of the dessert.  I also had to bake it for approximately 1 hour 15 minutes, which is a little longer than the recipe calls for.  I made it for my Mom's birthday and served it with a big dollop of whipped topping.  Make this...you won't regret it!

I've made this pumpkin cake many times, but I use a spice cake mix. What a spicy treat--everyone loved it better thank the yellow cake mix.

Move over, pumpkin pie! So easy and soooo good.  I have made this cake twice, and I prefer to use pecans instead of walnuts. For some reason this cake is much, much better if it sits a day or so before serving. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I make this recipe all the time.  However I've done a couple of things differently.  I add about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon with the pumpkin pie spice.  I also use Almonds in place of the walnuts.  I top with cool whip and sprinkle the cool whip with toffee bits...it's fabulous, and I never come home with leftovers when I take it to a party!

This is a great recipe!  I love how fast and easy it is!  Next time I think I might substitute some brown sugar for some of the white sugar and cut the butter into the cake mix and then sprinkle on top of the pumpkin.  It's a great recipe as is, but for me, I think those changes would be even better.

The pumpkin part turned out GREAT but the cake topping was only ok.  If I make it again, I will increase the melted butter to a full cup.  Half of the cake topping was still powder with the nuts burnt while the other half had absorbed the butter and the nuts sank into the cake. I spread the butter as evely as I could but it just didn't seem to be enough.  Overall it was pretty good, very delicious "pumpkin pie meets nutty cake"

It seems like people are using a cup of butter, but I actually used less than 3/4 cup.  It still came out good, but it was A LOT better 2-3 days after. The top was hard and crunchy the first day, and difficult to cut coupled with the soft pumpkin base (maybe because I used less butter). But a few days later, the top had softened and it was so good I couldn't keep my hands off of it. The guests seemed to enjoy it as well, unfortunately they only tasted it the first day it was made. I'd recommend this, but make sure to make it a day or 2 in advance, and next time i'd use less cake mix on top so the pumpkin flavor can stand out more.

I made this for my company Thanksgiving party and everyone raved about it(well, everyone except those who don't like pumpkin). I used a cup of butter like everyone suggested and when it first came out of the oven it was swimming in butter but after about 10 minutes it sets up beautifully. I also sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking and added a little bit of salt to the pumpkin mixture to cut the sweetness. Very good recipe. A definate keeper!! :O)

I took this to a Church cooking group meeting and everyone loved it.  I did add a lot of extra spice to the pumpkin mixture. I added a tablespoon of Cinnamon and a tsp of cloves in addition to the 2 tbsps of pumpkin pie spice called for in the recipe.

Try this and your pumpkin dessert will turn out perfect.  Mix the dry cake mix and the chopped nuts together and instead of melting the butter, keep it cold and using a pastry cutter, cut it into the cake mix and nuts.  Spread it on top of the pumpkin layer and then press to seal.  The butter will be mixed in perfectly throughout the cake mix when it's all done baking.  Like your classic 'dump cake' but with a delicious layer of pumpkin instead of fruit.  Perfect for the holidays!  So good!

FANTASTIC!!  This recipe was so easy and really yummy! I used a spice cake mix instead of the yellow and added 3 tsp. of cinnamon.  I chopped up pecans to put on top of the cake mix and then used 1 C. instead of 3/4 C. melted butter to drizzle over top.  In addition, I drizzled a vanilla glaze over the top. I will be making this recipe for many years to come!!

I took this to a church luncheon and everyone asked for the recipe.  Some changes I made from other reviews I've read:  I used a slightly smaller pan than a 13x9, so that the pumpkin would be thicker.  I also poured the melted butter into the cake mix and mixed it until crumbly instead of pouring it over the cake mix.  I only used 1/2 cup of butter, not the 3/4 cup suggested.    (No powder left after baking this way!)   Some said there was too much topping.  I didn't use all of the topping, and had about 1 cup of topping left over.   I covered the cake with foil about half way through baking so the topping would not be hard and crispy.  I cooked it 5 minutes longer, due to the slightly smaller pan.  It was a hit!

I found a great version of this by mistake! I had it ready for the oven and then realized I forgot to add the sugar! So I had to mix everything together instead of layering it. It turned out better the the original version! Tastes like a sweet pumpkin bread! Now every time I make this - everything gets mixed together before cooking! Try it!

I have made this for the last four family Thanksgiving/Christmas dinners ever since seeing Paula Deen make it. (She calls it a Gooey Pumpkin Butter Cake.) Only change I make is using pecans instead of walnuts. This always recieves rave reviews and it disappears quickly. When I made this for the first time, my nine month old nephew couldn't get enough of the filling. 

This is to die for. A must have for winter/holiday family dinners.

I have found that if you cut cold butter (not melted) into the dry cake mix with a pastry blender, then sprinkle it on the pumpkin mixture that it works much better.  That way, you don't have areas of the cake mix that is not covered with butter.  Just try it next time.......Great dessert!

So this is amazing! The only thing I find different from my version, is this one isn't an upside down cake! If you line your baking pan with foil or parchment, bake it, cool it, then turn it over it makes all of the difference because it can absorb some of the moisture from the pumpkin filling. It is best after several hours of cooling or over night is even better, it tastes spectacular!

It's a week before Halloween and this was the perfect Fall dessert.  I followed the recipe although made the changes that some of the other reviewers had suggested, adding 1 cup butter, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and using spice cake mix.  I also used chopped hazelnuts just because I prefer them over walnuts.    I took the suggestion of another reviewer after reading that some people had trouble with the topping.  I melted the 1 cup butter and mixed in the spice cake.  I placed spoonfuls of the butter/cake mixture on top of the pumpkin mixture and then sprinkled with the nuts.  I cooked for 65 minutes -- the knife came out clean and they looked beautiful.  I let them cool so they were just slightly warm and served them with whipped topping.  So good!  Some people said that these were better on day 2 and 3.  Mine were absolutely delicious on day 1, 2 and 3.  I will make these again.  Great recipe!

Maybe it's me, but this did not work out for me at all. I found the whole thing waaaaay too sweet. If I ever do make it again, I would only use a 1/2 cup of sugar since the cake mix topping is already really sweet, especially when it's used as-is.

I DO recommend this recipe, but be advised that it needs to be served the same day as baking.

I made 2 pans of this on Thursday afternoon for a school festival Saturday-- of course we had to taste-test them Thursday. The 'bar' was delicious! My only 'nut' eater and I couldn't get enough. The top is reminiscent of the classic 'Dump Cake', a flavor I love. On Thursday the lower layer had a nice firm texture and was easy to cut and serve on a plate.  But after refrigeration until Saturday it was quite difficult to lift out of the pan, as the lower layer had become quite soft, as another reviewer stated, almost custard-like. And the top layer had become quite moist without that original crunch. The flavor was still good but it just didn't have that "wow" anymore.

This is a fast, easy pumpkin dessert that is out of this world!  I made it slightly different than the recipe states.  Instead of the pumpkin pie spice, I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves and a dash of nutmeg.  One cup of butter drizzled over the top to make sure that it was covered and instead of walnuts I used pecans.  They taste better to me.  I also rake the top with a fork to ensure I have the cake mix evenly spread out over the dish and all clumps are broken up.

Delicious!  Made this for a family bbq today and everyone raved! My Mom, who lives for pumpkin pie, said it was the best pumpkin dessert she'd ever had! My 4 year old niece said, "I can't stop eating it, Auntie!" No leftovers!  Some changes: Used pecans instead of walnuts, didn't have pumpkin pie spice..but improvised with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.

EXCELLENT!!! Wanna make it even better? Try adding a few raisons (if you like-em) and I used a "cinnamon swirl" cake mix - it comes with a pkg of cinni-topping and I added it on top of the cake mix and before the butter - VERY VERY GOOD!!

This stuff was fantastic. A bit like a cross between pumpkin bread pudding/ cake and crumble. We used a Duncan Hines yellow cake mix, which was a bit too sweet, so I think next time, we'll try a Doctor Oetker organic mix, as they're a little mellower. But there will definitely be a next time. 
Sooo good. Also, we substituted pecans for walnuts which was delicious as well.
What a quick and easy recipe!

My whole family loved this!  It was gone almost as soon as it came out of the oven.  Then I tried making it with a spice cake mix, and I could hardly get rid of it.  It just sat, uneaten, for days. I'll definitely stick with the  yellow cake from now on!

This is really quite delicious. It's been many years since I've had a "dump cake" which is basically what this is.  I subbed in 1/4c brown sugar with 3/4c of white sugar; I may do 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar next time.  I also used 1c of butter as many reviewers recommended to prevent dryness; used a Duncan Hines "Butter Recipe Golden" cake mix; wanted to try a spice cake mix, but the grocery store was out; thought carrot cake mix might be good too.  This was sweet, but not too sweet, in my opinion (and I'm not a huge sweets eater); the hint of salt in the butter with the sweetness was a nice combo.  I might up the pumpkin pie spice a bit, as some have suggested, but it was fine as is, too.  Had to scoop up a couple of squares of it to take to the neighbors so we wouldn't overindulge!  Thank you for an enjoyable dessert tonight, Nancy.

I'm not sure how this will turn out... 
I'm asking myself as I write this, "why didn't you read MORE reviews?"   I did make more melted butter than it calls for, so hopefully it will be OK.  I love trying new things, but EESH!  I feel bad for the girl who said her's burned and only a 1/3 of it was presentable. That stinks...  I'm making this to share with my neighbors, and let them know there's a prowler/thief in the neighborhood.  Baked goods as a gift will surely make the news easier to swallow.  :)

Update:  Eleven mins and it is done... I checked it.. half was more dark on top than the other, not too bad, though, so I rotated it.  It really smells devine.  Yaay!

I forgot to put the nuts on top, but still a hit. Will definitely make again! I did mix the melted butter into the cake mix before crumbling on top of the pumpkin mixture. I think this gives a much more uniform crunch/crumble instead of drizzling butter over the dry cake mix.

We loved this one!  I used spice cake instead of yellow cake.  Also, instead of walnuts I used caramel bits (my daughter is allergic to nuts).  The trick is make it a day ahead of time and serve it cold.  We are having it instead of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dessert.

Great recipe!  The whole family loved it. I personally thought the pumpkin layer needed to be doubled. It seems a little out of proportion compared to the crumb topping. Next time I would double the pumpkin portion. I also agree that maybe you should cut in the butter with the cake mix before putting the pumpkin for more even coverage.

Very good pumpkin dessert! We all really enjoyed this. I have made something similar to this in the past, and am glad to have this recipe. I followed the recipe to a T. Next time I make this though, I will hold off putting the nuts on top until halfway through the baking as some of the nuts(especially in the corners) were a little too crunchy and brown or burnt. Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year for the first time. My husband, who does not like pumpkin said that I can make it anytime. I used pecans. I thin kit is a delicious cross between pumkin and pecan pie. I served it upside down so the "crust" was on the bottom and dolloped it with Cool Whip. A real keeper!

Sooo delicious... and easy! I've made this twice now, once with yellow cake mix and once with a spice mix. Definitely prefer the spice but both were wonderful. Didn't have pumpkin pie spice blend so I used cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Served with vanilla ice cream. Have been asked for recipe by everyone both times. Thanks so much for sharing!

Funny me-  I did not read this recipe since I supposed I knew what I was doing-  I mixed EVERYTHING together including the cake mix and had to bake it quite longer till a toothpick inserted came out clean which was about an hour.   I didn't realize my mistake until I came back to rate it today!  It didn't look too pretty- but was great that night when i served it at room temperature topped with whipped cream.  It was very dense and moist.  What I liked about it was that you can serve so many more people with this dessert in a13 by 9 pan then you can with an ordinary pie that serves 8 -I usually serve very large pieces of my desserts.  This recipe could serve 16 since it was so dense and heavy.  I refrigerated it that night and it wasn't as good in the morning as the first day, but I would definitely make it again.

I found this recipe here a few years ago and it has become a tradition every Christmas Eve. I add some cloves and cinnamon and replace pecans instead of walnuts. Then I serve with vanilla ice cream while it's still piping hot. This is sooo easy and everyone loves it! This may be what heaven tastes like :)

Yummy!! this is so good and so easy.  I sprinkle the nuts first, then add the butter.  65 mins the bottom is like pumpkin pie and the top is like cake. 75 mins the pumpkin layer is more like cake(also patted the dry cake mix down into pumpkin a little). Both ways are great.

This recipie was very easy to make.   I added 1 cup of butter instead of 3/4, and after turning the oven off, I left the cake in the oven for another 20 minutes or so.  It came out crispier.  very yummy!!!

I was searching by ingredients and came across this recipe. Of course, I didn't have exactly what was required so I adjusted. I substituted a can of sweetened condensed milk along with half a can of 2 percent milk in exchange for the evaporated milk and sugar. I did also increase the pumpkin pie spices, also the melted butter to one cup and sprinkled the top with chopped roasted pecans. Great warm with whipped topping. Cannot wait to taste is cold.

This is similar to pumpkin cobbler with a much easier crumble topping that magically manages to partially fall through the pumpkin layer for a great taste combination.  I doubled everything in the pumpkin mix, added one pkg Jello Custard Pudding & Pie filling and still used the 13 x 9 x 2 pan.  It made a much thicker pumpkin layer (yum). I lower heat to 300 and baked for an extra 10 minutes.  The one pkg of yellow cake mix was plenty; however next time I think I'll cut in the softened butter to a crumble mixture, rather than pour melted butter over the top of the dry cake mix.  Some spots were real brown and powdery where the cake mix didn't get moist.  All in all, a great pumpkin dessert.

I did as others suggested and used the spice cake mix instead of plain yellow. I mixed the melted butter and cake mix before sprinkling it on top of the pumpkin layer. When it baked, the topping was crunchy and very good. I will definately make this agian

I actually used the pumpkin pie mix in a can that already has the sugar and the pumpkin pie spice in it, mainly because I couldn't find the spice at the store.  I did add the evaporated milk and the eggs because the can directions call for milk and eggs when you just make a pie with it.  I only used the 3/4 cup of butter but I drizzle it so slowly that I can usually coat it pretty well.  It doesn't cover ever inch of the dry cake mix but mostly and the moistness of the pumpkin mix helps with the dry cake also.  I took mine to a Christmas party for work and only came home with a small dab left.  I judge how good something is by how many ask for the recipe. I had 4 ask.  That is a good recipe!

i made this dessert for Thanksgiving.  I failed to read all the reviews which indicated that everyone changed the recipe.  I made it just the way it reads.  It is bland and not enjoyable for those of us that like something sweet and tasty.  I would not recommend this recipe as it reads.  Follow some of the suggestions below.

THIS has REPLACED traditional pumpkin pie at our family Thanksgiving meals.  We like to serve it warm with vanilla ice cream.  Anytime I suggest trying anything else, such complaining!!  I've taken this to potlucks and received RAVE reviews!!  You can't miss with this dessert!

We LOVED this.  I followed some suggestions and used spice cake mix, pecans, and 1 c melted butter.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, but made my own using: 2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Will definitely put this on the fall rotation, as it was a real winner.  Thanks!

I love this recipe! Making this is one of our fall traditions; it's so easy my 8 year old can whip it up while I make dinner. I use pecans instead of walnuts. Really delicious with a scoop of cinnamon or vanilla bean ice cream or even with whipped cream. It's making me crave it just writing this! Yum!

This was pretty good. The pumpkin layer was very yummy but the topping, for my taste, was way to sweet and definately tastes like it came out of a box. I used a spice cake mix

Excellent!  We are having this instead of pumpkin pie this Thanksgiving.  I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand.  I also served with fresh whipped cream.  The flavor is amazing.

AWESOME!! Made this & everyone has asked for the recipe!! I have always liked the traditional "dump cake", especially the topping. This is that topping with a creamier version of pumpkin pie. Great warm with vanilla ice cream. If you take this to a dinner or potluck be prepared to take home an empty dish!!

Yum! I made this exactly as written, and it was excellent! This got more attention on Thanksgiving than the pumpkin pie. It does get mushy in the refrigerator so if you can't finish it in a couple of days, I suggest halving the recipe. Adding this one to my holiday recipe box.

Definitely a keeper :)  I've made this twice now, & it was delicious both times.  I did try it with both quantity options of butter (1 c vs. 3/4 c)  Better with 1 cup & 1 tsp of cinnamon added nice flavor.  I forgot those changes the 2nd time I made it, and it was missing a little zip :)  Make a few days ahead of time...definitely improves with a few days time in the fridge.  (I wouldn't hesitate to make it if you are running on a last minute basis, just better if you can make in advance!)

LOVE this dessert!  I have made it many times and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews! Made it again today but decided to try it with fresh pumpkin (from a pie pumpkin, about 2 cups), a spice cake mix and pecans- it is delicious this way too! Other than that I don't change a thing. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream, or room temp with whipped cream. One suggestion- I sift or stir my cake mix before I sprinkle it over the pumpkin to make sure it spreads evenly. You and your guests will not be disappointed!

I have made other pumpkin deserts that were difficult due to the fact that you were to turn it upside down(NIGHTMARE) or you had to scope it out which is fine but I'd rather not. This recipe Was perfect!! I did make it the day before as suggested and it cut into squares perfectly I and I do think the flavors mingled better the next day. I adjusted some of the flavors by pinches because I was afraid of it being too sweet or not sweet enough. I felt it was sweeter then I would of liked but EVERYONE LOVED it. Will be my one and only pumpkin desert!! Oh yeah....I told everyone it was an old family recipe! I want them to beg me to make it.

This dessert could use a bottom crust and it would taste a lot better. Without it, I think the bottom is too mushy and it doesn't hold up well. I ended up cutting small, bite size bars, carefully turned them over so the pumpkin side was on top and sprinkled some finely chopped walnuts on top to give the bars a better appearance. I'm going try this recipe again, first with a pastry crust and second with a graham cracker crust to see which one turns out better.

It was super good! Just totally unhealthy. Next time I would cut sugar in half as well as the salt - the cake mix has more than enough of each.

I made this dessert as is and it was pretty good but too salty for everyone that tasted it. It did taste better the next day! I tried it again the next week and it was even BETTER when I made these changes..... I used a spice cake instead of yellow cake. I then added 3 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and 1tsp. of cinnamon. I used 1 cup of UNSALTED butter!! I let it bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. I added the nuts halfway through so they didn't burn. Duncan hines sells this really good vanilla glaze( i would've made my own but I had it on hand) and I drizzled in over top after I took it out of the oven!! This was a HIT!!! I made it the night before and chilled it in the fridge. This dessert is definitely better the next day!!! Very Good!!!

Wonderful and easy. My 10 year old made this while I supervised. She was so proud of herself! We used spice cake mix, 1 cup butter, and no nuts.  I has such a great texture, and rich flavor.

YUM!  Be sure to use Spice Cake mix, it makes a big difference.  I've made this a few times and everyone loves it.  Personally, I think it tastes best after sitting for a about a day and a half so when I make this, I plan to make it a day in advance.

I found this dessert to be very odd. The bottom pumpkin layer was very soft and smooth-- much like pumpkin pie. The top layer was very dry and crumbly. The two layers did NOT go well together. It was just very, very weird. I took it to a party, and only one person had a piece. My husband (who usually loves what I make) only had one bite and couldn't eat any more. I followed the recipe exactly, but it just turned out very strange. Also, it didn't really have any flavor-- it was very bland.

Wonderful!  Made this for a couples Bible study, and got rave reviews. Used the spice cake mix, but followed the recipe for everything else.  I expected this to be similar to a dessert I've made in the past that is more of a pumpkin custard with a crisp type topping, and was pleasantly surprised ... this was much more of a very moist cake, with the pumpkin and cake layer seeming to pull together as it baked.  This is definitely one I'll make again!

Very good! I used egg substitute and fat free evaporated milk to lighten it up and it came out great. I also replaced chopped walnuts with finely chopped pecans. Only thing I would suggest is to maybe cut down on sugar or pumpkin pie spice; it was a little sweet. I would rather have this than pumpkin pie any day!

I made this a few days ago.  Great recipe.  Better when served warm!  If you've ever had a dump cake this is similar only with pumpkin.

Fabulous. I had to cook it longer, it never got to a cake consistency so I scooped it out of the pan, placed it in a lovely serving bowl. It was a HIT! Suggested serving with whipping cream or ice cream.

I made this yesterday for a family get together & it was fantastic. I followed the advice of the other viewers and melted an entire cup of butter, not sure if that made any difference or not.  I was a little concerned when I was making it that the filling was so thin... but it baked up beautifully.  The bottom of this cake is like pumpkin pie filling with a cobbler like top to it.  It was really good.  I served it with whipped cream (ok, cool whip, I don't whip my own cream...) and it was perfect.  It was a bit rich the way pumpkin pie is, so ice cream would have been too much for me.

What an excellent recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks Nancy!

Very good.  I also used 1 cup of melted butter.  Not because I wanted to but because there was not enough butter to cover the cake mix which I agree with other reviewers would have been like eating dry cake mix.  Next time I will leave out the nuts because the kids did not really like them.  Thanks

THis was really yummy...we ate the whole thing!!!  I couldn't find Pumpkin Pie Spice, so I just followed the directions for the spices on the can of Libby's pumpkin.  I also substituted Splenda for sugar and followed other recommedations to use 1 cup of melted butter.

This is a terrific cake. Not too sweet or rich. I took the advice of other reviewers and used spice cake mix  instead of yellow, added 3 tsps of cinnamon to the pumpkin mixture and used just under 1 cup butter for drizzling on top. I also used pecans instead of walnuts as that is what I had on hand. Will definitely make this one again.

AH-MAZING! I did what others recommended; I added cinnamon and did 1 cup of melted butter. I didn't have pumpkin-spice, so I added nutmeg instead(1 or 2 tsp.). I used walnuts and it was still good. I may try pecans next time and maybe even top-off the dry cake with some brown sugar. It is a little too sweet, so I'll probably try adding 3/4 cup of sugar instead next time. I loved it and my roommates loved it!! ****TASTES BEST WHEN WARM****

Delicious.  Even my picky husband likes it.  I gave it only 4 stars because I prefer pecans over walnuts.  Everything else in the recipe was spot on!

This is delicious and so easy to make! Like someone else suggested, I melted the 3/4 cup of butter and added it to the cake mix and then crumbled it on top of the pumpkin mixture. The topping wasn't powdery or hard after it was baked. I also added 2tsp of cinnamon to the pumpkin mixture in addition to the pumpkin pie spice and used pecans instead of walnuts. Great right out of the oven or cold out of the fridge!

I am not a big fan of pumpkin (but I will eat it).  On the other hand, my family LOVES PUMPKIN PIE etc...  I made this dessert, my 8 year old son and I tasted it and thought that it was just OK.  I chilled it in the fridge for a few hours and the two of us thought it tasted MUCH BETTER.  When the rest of my family came home, they tried it and DID NOT LIKE IT.  I gave some to my PUMPKIN LOVING Mother, and she was not thrilled.  SORRY, but this was not a hit with my NON PICKY FAMILY!!!  I actually made it to try out on my family before bringing to a school function and I decided that this would NOT be the dessert to bring.  SORRY, we just weren't fans!  I will not be making again.

Fantastic, a must try if you are a fan of pumpkin.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and used cinnamon in place of the pumpkin pie spice.  Top with whipped cream and you've got yourself an easy, yummy dessert!

I have made this dessert and it's good.  There is another way that has less fat and so I now use a 28 oz. can of pumpkin and make it in the same size pan and also only use a single size cake mix, (smaller than the pkg'd) and only use 1/2 cup melted butter and have the same amount of compliments and the serving sizes are ample.

I tried cutting the margarine into the cake mix and crumbling it on top of the pumpkin mixture. Disaster! The cake mix part totally sank into and was absorbed by the pumpkin mix, resulting in a very cake-y texture throughout.  It tasted okay but was a huge disappointment.

I made this last night and made a few adjustments to my liking. I added some butter and vanilla flavoring to the pumpkin mix along with some nutmeg and cinnamon. I did mix the butter and cake mix together as some has mentioned and also added some quick oats to the topping to give it more of a texture. I also added pecans and not walnuts. It was amazing! I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped topping. Definately try this!! I love pumpkin but don't care for pie crust so this was a great alternative!!

Everyone who had this did ask for recipe.  I picked this because the other versions called for 20oz of pumpkin and I only had 15oz.  After reading reviews I did stir/swish the dry mix and butter after adding it to make sure all of the mix was moist.

I enjoyed this. I only used 1/2 cup butter in order to reduce the fat. Next time I will mix the butter with the cake mix before adding to the pumpkin, as others have suggested.

I was really looking forward to this dessert, since the ratings were so high. I wasn't a huge fan. It was ok; but I found areas where the dry cake mix didn't cook as well tasted very salty. You also need to eat it warm - the pumpkin part doesn't taste very good cold. I'll stick with pumpkin pie, I think.

YUMMY!  It's a dessert but nice to get a great amount of vitamin A bonus from it :-)  I didn't use pumpkin pie spice - substituted 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/3 tsp ground nutmeg & a pinch of ground cloves. Took over reviewers suggestions of upping the butter for the topping. Since in my area, cans of plain pumpkin puree is sold seasonally, I purchased a few more cans to tide me over for summertime baking so my family can enjoy this recipe without having to wait to the Fall / Winter.

This was great- tasted just like pumpkin pie but without the crust (which I hate anyways).  Easy and I followed the directions exactly.

Made this recipe as a change from Pumpkin Pie this year.  Somewhat disappointing.  Very little pumpkin flavor.  Mostly tasted sweet and crunchy from the nuts.  It was OK but I wouldn't make it again.

I cook "a lot" for a lot of people and I must say this is a perfect "time saver" dessert.  Easy, good and a crowd pleaser.  I added some fresh ground nutmeg to the topping (but then I add nutmeg to almost everything at HOLIDAY time) and mixed walnuts with pecans.  this one is a keeper.

I've had this before, but lost the recipe.  I made it recently again for a party, but knew several of the people attending weren't fond of walnuts, so I crushed some gingersnaps to put on in place of the walnuts!  It was great!

I use a butter pecan cake mix instead of yellow.  It gives the cake a flavor richness that is lacking with plain old yellow cake.  You might try melting your butter in a measuring cup.  It makes drizzling over the top really easy.

Wow!  My whole family raved!  It's almost like a crustless pumpkin pie with a walnut crumb topping.  The cake mix as topping is ingenious.  I plan to make this dessert for my next dinner party.  May consider adding cream cheese to the pumpkin mixture next time so it's more like a cheesecake.  Might be a good variation.

I used the bundt pan and the presentation was gorgeous.  The taste was good but nothing spectacular.  Perhaps if I followed advice of others and added more pumpkin then it would be better but I am rating recipe as written!

Soooo tasty!  I chopped the nuts fine and then mixed them with the yellow cake mix, and I topped it with Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting (available on AllRecipes).  It was decadent and loved by everyone - this will be a fall favorite with us from now on!

I've made this twice now and got a bunch of requests for the recipe. Honestly I followed it exactly to the letter, maybe a little extra cooking time. Turned out perfect.  The second time I made it I did change the nuts to a caramel sauce drizzled over the top because of people with nut allergies. Just as good!

Great and easy pumpkin dessert. It makes a nice change of pace from pumpkin pie. I've made it several times - usually without nuts due to my picky eaters. This time I did add nuts halfway through baking as per other reviewers. The pecans still got a little too brown. Next time I will mix the nuts with the cake mix instead of sprinkling on top.

This tasted very good. I had one person say it was a little too sweet, but I didn't think it was too rich. I only give it 4 stars because the topping came out very hard/crunchy almost like a cookie and it was hard to cut through

I make this recipe every year and it's a huge hit. If you don't have pumpking pie spice I've always used 2 tsp of cinnamon. I usually use Pecans instead of walnuts. It's really good with a caramel sauce too. Use 1 cup butter, 2 cups ligh brown sugar, and 1 cup heavy cream. Cook over low heat until melted and well blended. Whisk sauce. Serve warm. Also make sure you chill the pumpkin dessert to set.

I got this recipe from a friend and have been making it for potlucks for years. It always is a favorite. I have modified it a bit by using canned pumpkin pie mix instead of the plain pumpkin, sugar and spices.  I have used lots of different kinds of chopped nuts and they all work.

I will be the first to admit I'm not fond of pumpkin pie. These knocked my socks off! So easy and quick to prepare; I've made these twice in the past week, exactly as directed and they have been gobbled up. I did leave them in the oven 5-6 extra minutes. On the second batch, I used pecan halves instead of chopping them up. Excellent fall/holiday treat. Thanks for the recipe!

Reading some of these reviews, is baffling.  I have made this several times, and it is easy and very good.  The spice cake is my favorite, but the yellow is also good.  A good cup of coffee is a must.

This was absolutely delicious.  I used Spice cake mix instead of yellow cake.
As I had made this early in the day, I served it cold with cool whip that evening. IT WAS MUCH BETTER THE SECOND DAY. Just reheat till warm and serve with vanilla ice cream.

This received rave reviews. Everyone wanted the recipe. I made it with spice cake mix, 3/4c white sugar and 1/4c brown sugar Splenda.  Served with whipped cream and drizzled caramel sauce on the plate for garnish. Delish!

Even though it's a cake mix, I thought the topping ended up too sweet.  Didn't go over very well and most ended up eating the "pie" portion.  I expected alot from all the 5* reviews, didn't meet expectations.

This was soooo good!  Baked it while my hubby and kids were carving pumpkins. They loved it! I used a spice cake mix and used 1t.cinnamin instead of pumpkin pie spice-didn't have any.  I baked it in a metal pan, so it only baked about 50 min.  It was wonderful-even better when it cooled!  Thanks!

This is so yummy!! And so easy!!  Can't believe how great this turned out.  I used the spice cake mix and pecans instead of walnuts.  I also used 1 full cup of melted butter and just sort-of dragged the back of my spoon over the top to make sure the butter was evenly distributed.  This was done in 50 minutes, so watch your cooking time.  Fantastic, definitely a keeper!!! Gonna go eat some more.....

This recipe was great! I made some changes: I  pressed a thin layer of the cake mix on the bottom of the pan, on top I mixed the cake mix with brown sugar... It was very yummy

This cake is great, so simple and easy to make! I omitted the nuts because some people don't care for them.Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactley. Served with cool whip, it's an excellent dessert. This will become a holiday traditoon in my home.

This was really good but I not sure what I did wrong. It was cooked in about 45 minutes and my nuts burned. Once we got through the burned stuff it was very tasty.  Maybe it's my oven. next time I will cover it with foil.

This is sooooooo good! I was very surprised because of the simplicity of it, but it is wonderful! I made it for the first time with guests and we all looooved it, in fact I have made it several times since the first time only a few weeks ago. Perfect for fall time...a perfect dessert for company!!! If you are looking for something new to do with pumpkin THIS IS IT:)

This cake was excellent - the hubbie & I enjoyed it right out of the oven w/ a scoop of ice cream on the side.  However, I could not bring myself to use 3/4 c. butter (seemed like ALOT of fat).  I used 1/2 c. butter and substitued 1/4 c. applesauce to keep the moisture.  Also, I only used 3/4 c. sugar instead of the the 1 c. called for.  Cake was still incredibly sweet - a little too sweet for my taste.  If I make it again, I'll try it w/ less sugar.  Also used pecans instead of walnuts, and it reminded me of pecan pie - the sweet gooey pumpkin underneath, and the crusty buttery pecans on top.  Very good recipe!

This has got to be one of the best desserts I have EVER made. I made them with pecans instead of walnuts and I think that went over extremely well. Everyone raved about them and I will most certainly make them again.

This is exactly the dessert that my grandmother has made for holidays since I was a little girl! She omitted the nuts, probably as a family preference. I have since tried this recipe with both my homemade buttermilk and spice cake mix recipes and both were delicious variations. This gets devoured every time I make it. Try it with praline pecans if you've got a big sweet tooth.

OOPS!  In my haste, I mixed all of the ingredients together.  This was terrific and certainly did not need icing.  I will use whipped or vanilla ice cream next time.  I made cup cakes and they are bite size, so really don't need anything extra.  Everyone at work loved them.

I made the recipe again (the right way) and it was very good.

I had a lot of evaporated milk in the cupboard that I did not know what to do with and I did an ingredient search on the website and this recipe came up so I tried it.  This was very easy to make.  I had rave reviews at my family gathering and had many people ask for the recipe.  I also increased the butter and the spices.  I will do this one again!

I brought this to a social function and everyone loved it!  I thought it was very tasty but a little too sweet.  I would cut down on the amount of cake mix next time to let the pumpkin flavor come through.It was very easy to prepare and looked great also. I added extra walnuts to completely cover the top and used 1 cup of butter.  Thanks for this fun holiday recipe.

I took this recipe to work for our Thanksgiving gathering and had seven requests (from our office of ten - three were men) for the recipie within a 1/2 of an hour!  It's wonderful.  It's replaced pumpkin pies at our house for Thanksgiving! :)  Thank you to whoever posted it.

Fifth time I've made it and 5th time I've been showered with compliments and asked for the recipe- I can't recommend this one enough!  The only change I have made over the course of all this cooking is to cover the dish with foil at the 30 minute mark.  The walnuts have a tendency to brown too much if you don't and then they taste somewhat rancid.  Simple step and you have perfect results!

I followed the suggestions of others regarding mixing butter with cake mix and it worked beautifully.  The thing I didn't do is double the pumpkin part of the recipe and I wish I would have.  Not enough pumpkin for me but everyone else loved it!    I cut in 1. c cold butter with spice cake mix and pecans and added additional spices for a bolder flavor.  I'll try it again but will double the pumpkin part of the recipe and re-rate.

I served it on Xmas and people raved about it.  The next time I will cut the butter into the cake mix instead of pouring the butter on top of it.  Pouring it on left dry areas that I had to scrape off.  I served it with fresh whipped cream, delicious.

I’ve made this recipe twice. Once with walnuts & once with pecans. The walnut dessert won by a landslide! Somehow the walnuts really do enhance the flavor overall. This was also such an easy recipe...fun making something so simple but family/friends think you baked all day!! LOL...

Absolutely amazing!!! I didn't have pumpkin can, so I cooked a pumpkin and mashed it. Also instead of the spices I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp ginger powder that's all. I used exactly 3/4 cup butter and it was enough. I baked it for 1 hour 15 minutes, and despite these small changes It turned out AMAZIING! Everyone loved it and I'll make one again next week.

Like some other reviewers, I tried this recipe using a spice cake mix instead of the golden cake mix.  I cut the butter into the dry mix before I sprinkled it on top of the wet ingredients and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I was really curious as to how this combination would turn into a cake, but it actually worked very well.  The dessert was moist and delicious and tasted like fall!  I will definitely add this to my recipe box.

This is just like my grandma's recipe for Pumpkin Pie Cake. When my grandma died she left me her recipe. I always seem to misplace it.. I'm glad I found your recipe as a backup. This is the best pumpkin dessert ever! And the suggestion of a cup of butter and a teaspoon of cinnamon does make it perfect. I just made one for Thanksgiving tonight.. I can't wait to eat it!

This pie/cake was spectacular!! Based on other reviews I did make some changes to this recipe. I used spice cake mix instead, I ran out of the pumpkin spice seasoning so I added 1 tbsp of cinnamon, and I used 1 cup of butter instead of the suggested. the butter caramelized with the walnuts and made it so perfect. This is a melt in your mouth mind of recipe. 2 thumbs up!!

Delicious and quick! I only used 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup butter. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so used cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Only had 8 oz pumpkin, but had an extra ripe banana to replace the missing pumpkin.  Even with all my changes it was really yummy...like a combination of a pumpkin pie and cake!  I think this recipe is fool proof, meaning you can change it up using what you have (within reason) and it will work!  Thank you....this is a keeper, especially for holiday time.

I made this as directed and it is identical to "Pumpkin Pie Cake I" on this site.  It is not sweet enough for me.  It's like a pumpkin crumble with streusel topping.  In some places the dry cake mix did not become moist.  Perhaps it can be swirled around on the top of the pumpkin or mixed in with the melted butter. It is worth experimenting with.  Third time: I used all cinnamon and swirled the dry mix through the pumpkin mixture just a bit.  Baked for 65 minutes in a 13x9 stoneware pan.  Perfect.

Delicious!  Like others, I increased the butter to 2 sticks which gave it a buttery, golden, and crispy top.  I decreased the pumpkin spice to 2 teaspoons (I'm not a fan of ginger, clove and some pumpkin spice flavors) and added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  I agree to let it sit for a day before serving.  I had a small piece when it was still warm and it had a rather unpleasant consistency, gooey and very soft.  The next day it had set up perfectly and I couldn't get enough.

The first time, I made this as written. Very good, but felt it could use more spice. Second time, I used spice cake and less sugar which came out a "better" fit for family preferences.  Second time I also used a glass pan, not one that is a darker metal which overbaked and overbrowned the top.

I made this for the first time for a Christmas dessert.  Thanks to the other reviewers, I made a few adjustments.  I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, so I used approximately 3 tablespoons of cinnamon (I will probably use 4 tbsp. next time).  I also used one full cup of butter instead of 3/4 cup. It may look like a lot, but it turns out wonderful! I baked for a little over one hour. After taking it out of the oven, I let it cool off entirely and put it in the fridge overnight (I highly recommend this).  On Christmas Day (24 hours later), I served it with whipped cream and it was AMAZING!!  This is my new "go to" pumpkin pie dessert for the holidays!  Everyone loved it!  Thank you so much for the great recipe and thanks to the other reviewers for the helpful hints!

I made this recipe in tandem with the "Pumpkin Crumb Cake" on this website since the ingredients were very similar.  My tasters at the office chose the other recipe over this one, but they did like the crunchy topping from this one.  I made this as written except I mixed the cake mix with softened butter and crumbled on top; that way the butter was better distributed.

Amazing! I used spice cake instead of yellow, which made for a delicious spicy fall pumpkin cake. I added 1 cup of melted butter to the cake mix, which was probably too much butter. It was difficult to sprinkle the cake on the pumpkin mix, but turned out great anyway. I omitted the nuts for allergies, but pecans would be great. Instead, I melted cheese cream frosting and drizzled it on the cake after it came out of the oven. YUM! The cake was great the first day and great the second...if you get leftovers at all!

Very flavorful and moist.  I just added everything into one bowl and mixed (excluding walnuts), poured the mixture into a 13 x 9 pan and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.  It is very good - almost creamy.  Would recommend for ease, quickness and taste.

I have been making this for years. My original recipe calls for mixing 1/2 cup melted butter with the cake mix and nuts, then crumbling over the top. It's so good that EVERYONE tries to pick off all the topping! Very good and easy.

I have been making this cake for years. Fantastic and popular where ever I take it. A few things I do differently. Butter is 1 cup. I line the metal cake pan w 2 layers of wax paper. Substitute pecans for walnuts. Drizzle the butter evenly after the nuts. Bake...allow to cool in pan for 6 hours...very dense pie takes forever to cool. Then flip onto serving platter...carefully. Pound on the bottom after flipping and the cake will drop out. I ice with a cream cheese/whip cream icing. Sooooo good!!!!

I love this recipe. It is basically the same one my neighbor taught us to make growing up and I never get tired of it!! 

Suggestion: Here is one thing that would help with the crust problem people are having. Instead of melting the butter, grate it and spread it evenly over the cake mix. This way when it melt it spreads on its own and keeps the cake mix from sinking. I hope this helps. I also think it needs to be cooked a bit longer.

I was having a huge pumpkin craving, and I ended up having everything in the house for this dessert, and everyone loved it! The bottom is just like pumpkin pie, with a cake on top. I did change a few things, though. I melted 1 cup of butter, and mixed it in with the cake mix. It was no longer a crumble, but actual batter. I just poured that on top of the pumpkin pie layer, and just let it sit. While baking, it spreads, so the whole thing is covered. Also, I did not just used nuts for the topping. I combined cinnamon, brown sugar, and an assortment of chopped nuts. It was like a streusel on top! Very delicious, and it took me under 10 minutes to make and put in the oven! :)

Wow! My pumpkin Pie for Thanksgiving has just lost its place. My husband said, this is better than any pumpkin pie I have ever eaten. Lets not have pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving ever again and just eat this instead. I said sounds like a winner to me. I made this EXACTLY as stated! This will be not only my recipe for Thanksgiving now but will also be my Potluck dinner recipe to take in the Fall/Winter. LOVE IT!!!!

This is a fantastic fall dessert! It's so easy to make, and it's especially easy to please a crowd with this dessert. I served it with homemade whipped cream. I usually don't like walnuts or any other type of nut in a soft dessert (it's just a texture thing for me), but I thought the walnuts were great because of the already "crumbly" top. Definitely a keeper in my Recipe Box.

I have made this recipe for years.  The only thing that I do differently is use half of the cake mix on the bottom of the pan, and the other half on the top of the pumpkin.  Otherwise it is too thick and often comes out powdery.

This is by far my favorite dessert for the Thanksgiving season! Ive been making it for 3 years now and I have people calling asking me for more! One hint to perfection, cinnamon whip cream! Cool whip makes it during the holidays and its amazing on this!

This was simply amazing!  If you like pumpkin pie you will love this!  I let it rest in the refridge over night & it was just how we like our pumpkin pie...cold with homemade whip.  I did omit walnuts.  I will use the other reviewers suggestion of mixing butter with cake mix prior to pouring over the pumpkin mixture before baking.  It was sooo good!  Everyone loved it & my son said first bite....this is amazing!!  My husband couldn't help himself & went back for thirds!  YUMMMMMMOOOO!

This recipe is really good, defiantly a crowd pleaser. I would make some recommendations. First cut the cold butter into the cake mix using a pastry cutter to avoid uncooked patches of dry cake. Also as others have mentioned you will want to add more spices than what is called for or it may be a bit bland.

I served this up at a barbeque/party last night and everyone was just raving about it!  I added extra spices - 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp all spice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg (maybe a bit more), and 1/2 tsp cloves.
I also used white cake mix instead of yellow and it tasted great.

I made this for my "friends-giving", and they all flipped out.  I've been instructed to make this for every get together from now on. The only variation was that I used spice cake mix instead of yellow.   I'm thinking I could use this same recipe but with cherry filling and make like a cobbler, or maybe lemon curd...so many possibilities!

OMG!!!!!!! Wow this is one great and easy recipe. The only thing I did different was used rounded teaspoons for the spice and added 1/4 teaspoon each cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the cake mix. I used 2-9 inch cake pans and divided equally. Cook time was the same. This worked out really well. 1 to keep for yourself and 1 to share. WOW it came out great. You won't be sorry for making this cake.

Wow was this good!!  Yes, the bottom is moist ( I wouldn't say "mushy") and the topping is so tastey.  I added cinnamon and vanilla to the pumpkin mixture for a bit more sweetness.  A nice combination of pie and cake!  Who would have thought?

This is the best pumpkin pie I ever made. It was a perfect blend of taste and texture. My husband loved it too for one who doesn't like pumpkin pie. The pecans were a great accent and garnish. A KEEPER.

Family and friends love this recipes. Instead of using melted butter, I cut the butter and mixed with the cake mix. The first couple of times, I sprinkle the nuts on top, and it was burned little. I decided to mix the nuts with the cake mix after the butter.

Our dinner company really liked this.  My husband says the bottom layer is a little too "mushy."  I wonder what it would be like with some kind of a bottom crust made with part of the cake mix and baked first?

I made this recipe according to the recipe except that I did add the extra cinnamon and sugar. It needed the extra sweetness and spice. My family thought it was tasty but not fabulous or outstanding. Maybe I would have been wild about it if I were a real pumpkin afficianado ... but it's just okay for me. I would make this again, but in place of the traditional pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving if I wanted to do something different and already had a bunch of other pies.

I enjoyed the pumpkin taste of this recipe, however, I did not like how sweet it was. If I were to make this again, I would place in an 8x8 to make the pumpkin part thicker (it was too thin for me) and use less of the cake topping as it was very thick and too sweet, which ruined the dessert for me.

Made this for a Halloween Open House and all that tasted gave a thumbs up! Great twist on traditional pumpkin pie... crust is on the top. I did take a few suggestions from others - Sugar 1/2 cup - Cut cold butter into cake mix which I sprinkle over the cake then added crushed nuts then sprinkled cake topping over the nuts. I will try it next time with a spice cake mix. This is a keeper! Thank you!

This is delicious!  It's very easy to make and it turned out to be more like a pumpkin bar.  I cut into squares and put them each in a baking cup on a platter for a family gathering.  The walnuts add a nice dimension to the flavor, I wouldn't omit them.

This didn't turn out well.  Like a couple of others have said, some of the cake mix stayed powdery, and the nuts were scorched.  Maybe if I mix the butter and nuts into the cake mix and sprinkle it over the top it would work better? I want to love this, may try it again doing that.  (Will edit my review if I do that.)

This is so easy to make. The only change I made was I added some qcinnamon on top w/ the nuts. Next time ill only use 1/2 a cup of sugar in the pumpkin (it was a little to sweet for me w/ the cake mix on top), and ill use brown sugar instead of white just for flavor preference. Id also add some extra pumpkin pie spice and a splash of vanilla to pumpkin next time. I only used 3/4 cup of melted butter like the recipe says and had no problem with any of the cake mix not being cooked in certain spots like some others complained of, just take your time drizzling the butter, don't leave any big gaps of cake mix without any butter and it will all come together when it bakes. *EDIT* I made this again with white cake mix & I liked the a lot better than the yellow mix for some reason.

I made this just the other night on a whim! Wonderful flavor, consistency, and easy to make. The butter gives a rich taste and the topping is like a streusel. Top with whipped cream or ice-cream and an extra dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. Thank you for a great recipe!

EXCELLENT!!!!  I didn't have nuts, so I used granola and it turned out great!  Next time, I'm going to try unsalted butter (1 cup).  Wish I could write more, but I'm going to have another slice of this gem!

This dessert is absolutely delicious! It has become the dessert all my friends and family request for fall parties and holidays. Like many of the other reviewers, I use a full cup of melted butter on top. Can't wait to make it again!

Basically, this is a pumpkin dump cake.  Typically, I love dump cakes, but this recipe has a very unusual texture and consistency that didn't work for me or anyone in my family. The pumpkin, egg, and evaporated milk mixture was really "eggy" almost like a souffle or soft quiche.  YUCK!  But, the flavor was really bland, too!  I served to my in-laws who are visiting from out of town and they ate it out of politeness, but at least we had a good laugh about it this morning.  DON'T MAKE THIS DESSERT!!!!

Ugh. This is the second time I have made a dessert with cake mix topping and I have decided it is just not my thing.  I don't like how overly rich it tastes and it makes me feel yucky.  I don't know why.  I decided to try this recipe based on the rave review and how easy it is. My 4 year old didn't like it.  

My dh on the other hand really liked it and said he wanted it on Thanksgiving!  He is so easy to please. Gotta love him.  LOL

Great recipe!  I was out of evaporated milk, so used sweetened condensed, eliminated the 1 cup of sugar, and cut down to 2 eggs.  It turned out great!

Very easy, very good dessert. I've made this a few times now. I made a mistake when making this then made it according to the recipe. I prefer my mistake.
I used a golden butter recipe cake mix,3/4 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. ginger, 1/2 t. nutmeg, and 1/4 t. cloves. I mixed the cake mix with 1 c. butter then spooned batter over top and swirled to marble with the pumpkin. I then topped it with pecans. After baking 1 hour, I shut off oven and left for 20 minutes. My kids' friends, family, and ladies group have all loved it. It's kind of between a custard and a cake. Moist and dense. Bonus: it serves a lot.

I like cake much more than pie, but my husband had requested pumpkin pie.  So, I tried this recipe and it did the trick.  It's almost between a cake and pie, so both of us were happy.  I left off the walnuts.  I think what made this so tasty for me was the yellow cake mix drizzled with the butter on top; it made it taste a lot less pie-like.  I added more cinnamon as some of the others had suggested.

Not bad, but not what I was thinking. I guess I did not realize it would be so close to pumpkin pie in texture. The flavor was good. We did enjoy it much more the next day.

The pumpkin filling had a good texture, and that's about all the good I can say for this recipe. The filling had almost no flavor, or maybe it was just masked by the inch-thick topping that completely overwhelmed it. That topping was awful. Too thick, completely took over the dish, and tasted like nothing but the gallon of melted butter poured over the top in several places. I have no idea how so many people loved this dessert.

I make this every year, its always a hit with adults and kids alike. I'm all about the custard, so I only use 1/2 the cake mix and a tad less butter. I also skip the nuts, just as yummy.

I wanted this to be so much better than it was.  It was easy to make and would serve a lot more than one pumpkin pie would.  I used spice cake mix, but I still thought the butter and walnuts overpowered the pumpkin flavor.

If you like pumpkin pie you need to try this recipe, I used a spice cake mix, 1 tsp  cinnamon,1/2 tsp ginger, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves instead of the pumpkin pie spice. A hint for no more "dry cake mix spots" Melt your butter in a  measuring cup in the microwave, then use a teaspoon to drizzle the melted butter covering the dry cake mix as much as possible, this will eliminate dry areas. I agree after cooling over night in the refrigerator the flavor is much better. I'll make this  recipe again.

Very yummy even though I had to leave off the nuts because my husband is allergic to them.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing - we ate some within minutes of coming out of the oven and thought it was a bit too sweet but after it cooled down it was perfect.

Ok, I was thinking it would be really spectacular w/ all the ratings.   It was very custard like the first day, while still warm. Cake topping was not crunchy.   Don't know if I will make it again.

Super Easy! Super Tasty! Salted butter topping with nuts a little salty - might try unsalted butter. Definitely blend in some brown sugar for more pumpkin pie taste - pecans will be an awesome variation too. Overall wonderful!

This is a very simple and absolutely delicious recipe! After reading several reviews, I decided to use the spice cake mix in place of the yellow, and went with the full cup of butter...I was amazed at how easy this extra special dessert was to make. There is only one problem...I can't leave it alone! ;)

Drizzled butter didn't wet all of the powder layer and we had a lot of dry powdered cake mix in the finished product.  Was good on edges where the butter penetrated, but the rest was trash.  Not sure what I did wrong.

I made dinner for some friends tonight and had this for dessert.  OMG everyone, including the kids, loved it.  It was super easy and smelled so good while it was baking.  I did cut the sugar back to 3/4 since 1 cup seemed like a lot. I did not use walnuts or pecans because I'm not fond of nuts on my desserts.  For a twist, I also thinly sliced 2 granny smith apples and placed them in the middle and then put the remaining mix on top.  Not sure why I thought this would be good, but it was. I served it with Cool Whip on top.  Just plain yummy.  I will definitely make it again.  Next time I think I will try the spice cake just to see what it tastes like.

After one bite, my husband said "We've just found a new family tradition!"  Just delicious.  Did use the spice cake, 1 cup butter and pecans.  Took it to a party and people raved.  Very different and super easy.

This was super tasty and super easy.  The only downfall was that is didn't "look" that appealing - but once people tasted it word spread fast and it was attacked! :)

This one is a keeper!  I made it to bring to work today, it was a definate hit!  The only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts on top.  It'll be a staple at Thanksgiving from this point on.

This is an extremely easy dessert, and so yummy.  It is very sweet...but delicious.  I served it with vanilla ice cream as suggested, and my family loved it!  I use 3/4 of a box of Spice Cake mix in place of the yellow mix.  mmmm.

Delicious and very easy!!. Made it for a cub scout fall campout and it was a hit. I made it the night before and refrigerated over night. I didn't use nuts (in case of any allergies)...and I spread cool whip on like frosting. One hr cooking and 3/4 C butter is just right! Going to make a couple other batches this week - one for work and one for home!

This was fabulous!!!!! I made it for a party at my house and everybody wanted the recipe. I did increase the butter to 1 c like others suggested. Also replaced walnuts with Pecans. I baked additional 10 minutes to make sure the center was done. I'm putting this one in my KEEP pile! Thanks!

I had this at the office and then came to this website to find the recipe.  I've made it twice and everytime it disappears immediately.  Much better than the name sounds, you're not even sure you're eating pumpkin.

Sooo soo delicious!! Even better the second day! I thought I messed up when adding the cake box topping but I believe it made it better.  The last step I mixed 1 cup butter with the box cake and chopped almonds. I then poured the mixture over the pumpkin and spice mix. It began to sink in so I used a spoon and spread it out making a swirled design. Soooo good!!

I had approx. 3/4 cup pumpkin frozen so added that to the 15oz. called for.  I was worried that it wasn't going to set since it was so pourable but it turned out just fine.  I did cut the butter into the cake mix as others have stated.  I also mixed the nuts into the cake batter mix since i am not a fan of any topping being over baked at all.  That also worked well.  Not an over pumpkiny tasting dessert which is good since it's so common this time of year.  Using spice cake mix will work well with this recipe.  Received thumbs up from others.

I was expecting more than it delivered.  The only redeeming thing about the cake is the fact that it is easy to make.  The texture is all wrong, I expected crunch and got mush.  There are better things to do with a can of pumpkin than putting it in this recipe.

I followed the advice of others regarding the increase of butter and spices and am thrilled with the results. This cake is moist and decadent. It’s also super sweet so if that’s not what you’re after, do not make this cake!

I made this for a Halloween brunch potluck and we had so much food, but this was still half eaten! I liked that it was basically pumpkin pie with cake. I used pecans and the topping was just delicious.

Instead of walnuts, I use almost a whole box of crushed Keebler Pecan Sandies cookies with a little extra melted butter  for extra topping.
*We* Love* This* CAKE* --Even my father in law, who doesn't like pumpkin (I made it and called it crumb cake and he doesn't even know it has pumpkin in it).
Just try it and it is sure to be one of your favorite go to fall dessert recipes.

I’ve had this recipe for years and it’s sooooo good! It’s like pumpkin pie on steroids - so much better. It’s the crunchy topping that puts it over the top. My girls made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.

Easy to make, but nothing spectacular. It was good, but nothing that makes me go wow that was great.

Huge hit & so easy. Even people who said they don't like pumpkin loved it and went for more. That said, it's not a 'light' dessert and a little bit goes a long way.

I made it the day before and it was delicious!  I took out the walnuts and added toffee due to allergies, but that was still quite delicious!

Yummy, but I'm glad I reduced the sugar in the pumpkin mixture to 2/3 C. And I didn't use all of the cake mix. Left out about a cup. I did as others did and cut in the solid butter into the cake mix, then added the nuts. Made a nice streusel topping. We liked the final product better after it was in the fridge overnight.

Took this to a dinner and got several compliments. Love how easy it is. I used a French vanilla cake mix bc that's what I had. Also, my (1c) butter was frozen, so I shredded it with a serrated knife and tossed it with the cake mix before sprinkling on top. Then, topped w walnuts. Turned out great! No dry spots on the flour.

I made this for an alternative to pumpkin pie for our large family Thanksgiving gathering, minus the nuts. It was mostly eaten by the kids, but they all loved it! My husband is not a huge fan of pumpkin, but he gave it his seal of approval: "It's not too pumpkin-tasting, it's good." Personally I think it has just the right amount of pumpkin taste.

super simple dessert. For whatever reason, i thought the top was supposed to be similar to coffeecake of blueberry muffin. the top of this dessert was rather mushy (it turned out better after in the fridge). i made the changes that others suggested- 1 cup of butter rather than 3/4. next time i will stick to 3/4. too much butter. Other changes:: added cinnamon to batter and added more walnuts to the top. may even add more next time. they made the dessert!

This is fabulous! I listened to other reviews and made two slight changes. I used a full cup of butter and I replaced vanilla cake mix with a spice cake mix. Everyone loved it and most asked for the recipe.

The only change I made was I added pecan pieces instead of walnuts and that was just because I have pecans I need to use. It came out great! Tastes more like a pie with a crumble on top. Very rich in taste. I saved what was leftover in the fridge. I tried again a couple days later and it seemed even more sweet to me.

Turned out great! Made couple changes. Used an orange flavoured cake mix as that's all I had on hand, added extra spices allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg. Reduced the sugar to 1/2c (personal preference). And like other reviewers used 1c melted butter over cake mix. Everyone liked it! And it's super easy and fast to make. Will be making this again!. Thanks.

This smelled amazing, but it only tasted OK. It is nice and moist, but the flavor was bland. I put in 3/4 C sugar, as suggested by some, and added cinnamon in addition to the pumpkin spice, but I think I should have added the full 1 C sugar. With a traditional yellow cake, you get the sweetness of a frosting, so the additional sugar may have helped.  I also stirred the cake mix and the 1 C melted butter together after pouring the butter over the cake mix, as I was concerned the cake mix wouldn't be incorporated otherwise.  I'm glad I did - the cake mix was still in powder form in the areas where I didn't mix it!  Not sure if I'll make it again, but if I do, I'll use the full 1 C sugar and will mix everything together before pouring it into the pan to see what happens!

This is a yummy quick dessert! I have made a few additions to the recipe. I add vanilla and cinnamon to the melted butter. Also, I have used crushed graham crackers for the topping when I didn't have any nuts!

I made this dessert this weekend.  It was SO so good that my husband and I can't leave it alone!  As other reviewers suggested, I used a full cup of melted butter, a spice cake mix instead of yellow, and pecans instead of walnuts simply because I don't like walnuts.  The recipe is simple and makes a truly decadent dessert.

This was a hit! I used a Gluten Free yellow cake mix, I used 1/2 cup sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar and I added another teaspoon of spice. I also incorporate the softened butter with the cake mix using a pastry blender.  
Really yummy!

As many people suggested, I used spice cake mix instead of yellow cake mix and added cinnamon to the top. I let it sit for a day before eating it in the hopes that it would soften up but I still found the top to be very hard and almost impossible to get through with a fork. Since the bottom has no crust or cake layer to make it easier to pick up the cake was very hard to eat. I also used one cup of butter instead of 3/4 cup and found the cake to be way too buttery tasting.

So delish! My husband even ran back for seconds and he is not a real dessert person. I told my sister that I will bring dessert for Thanksgiving.  I did use pumpkin pie filling and cut the sugar out. I also just sprinkled tea spoon of the pumpkin pie spice. Still delish!

MAKE SEVERAL DAYS AHEAD.   I made a double batch of this Tuesday evening for a Wednesday event.  I modified with extra cinnamon and butter, per other reviewers, and also combined the nuts, cake mix and melted butter together before spreading over the pumpkin mixture and pressing down slightly.  My pans were done baking in 55 minutes.  Served with whipped cream, this dessert was very well-received.  One of my guests suggested adding finely chopped apples and/or dates to the pumpkin.   Note that a rectangular cake pan yielded at least 16 generous servings rather than 12 because it's very rich.  Anyway, the leftovers got exponentially better each day....on Friday it was dessert heaven!

I cut back on the sugar to 2/3 c. When I made it with the 1 cup, thought it was just too sticky sweet for my taste buds! Love it  though and I will never make a pumpkin pie again, this is better!

Have been looking at this recipe for awhile and finally made it - the Gluten Free way! It is soooo delicious! 

The best news is that you can substitute gluten free yellow cake mix (I used Betty Crocker). I used 1 cup butter and baked for 45 minutes but otherwise followed the recipe. 

Delicious!

Otherwise known as Pumpkin Dump Cake. Only change I made was to serve (warm or room temperature) with some whipped cream on top, and a nice cup of coffee on the side. Always a great hit!

I have made this for years. The only change I have made is that rather than yellow cake mix I use spice or carrot cake.  I think it adds more flavor. This has replaced pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving in our house.

I made a gluten-free dairy-free version of this and it turned out great! I only had to cook it for about 30 mins longer since it had too much water in it due to dairy substitutes.

Instead of evaporated milk, I used about 1.25 cups of Silk's Unsweetened Coconut/Almond milk blend whisked with a bunch of cornstarch to thicken it up.

I used King Arthur's Gluten-free Yellow Cake mix.

I drizzled about 3/4 cup of Earth Balance's vegan baking buttery sticks. Next time, I probably will use more to see how it works.

I substituted a nutmeg/ginger/cinnamon/clove mix for the pumpkin pie spice since I didn't have it on hand, and added some brown sugar on top.

You don't have to use the nuts and it tastes great!

It's way too sweet. I may try this again with far less sugar, and mix some of the cake mix into the batter.

This was so moist and very yummy. I did as suggested earlier and mixed the melted butter with the cake mix and then added it on top. I put wax paper on the bottom and flipped it over after it had cooled. It was brought to a church picnic and everyone liked it a lot.

My mom makes this recipe all the time for treat day at work and we always beg her to make extra for the family. Two years ago I took over hosting Thanksgiving at my house and served this instead of a traditional pumpkin pie. My guests raved about how great this is and didn't miss the traditional one bit! It is so simple to make and always comes out perfectly for me exactly as the directions are written. I make this every chance I get for a party or fall treat. Throw on some home-made whipped cream and it's a true winner.

the bottom, and... I cooked it 45 minutes longer than the recipe

I loved this! Other reviewers said it was better the next day, I agree (because I ate some for breakfast :-) ). When I baked it, I sprinkled nuts on half only, and I preferred it without the nuts. Also, I don't think it needs whipped cream, liked it better without.

This was so easy to make with ingredients I already had at home. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used sweetened condensed milk and left out the sugar listed in the recipe. It's super sweet and would have probably been better following the original recipe. I served it with a little whipped topping and it was delicious.
Tip: make sure you drizzle the butter all the way to the edges of the pan to make sure the corners will cook well and not just have dry cake mix.

Made this recipe the day before halloween to eat after trick or treating. Came out perfect. I followed the recipes to the t and my family raved about it. The only thing I did different was bake it in 2 9'' round baking pans because I didnt have a 9x13 baking pan. Will be making this every halloween.

Great recipe for fall, but I did cut the sugar in half.  And I think next time I will use brown sugar or coconut sugar instead of white sugar.  I also served it with salted caramel sauce and everyone loved it!

I made the recipe almost exactly as the recipe, only instead of walnuts I used pecans. The pumpkin part was perfect! So smooth and creamy and delicious! With the cake on top it was wonderful! The only thing I will change next time is to use unsalted butter and I will omit the nuts. There was a strong salty taste so I want to get rid of that! If people want nuts, I have them separate and put them on top after wards!

Yummy!!! I have and allergy to walnuts so i used slivered almonds instead. Increased the butter to 1 cup as others suggested. This is so good. Not overly pumpkin and the almonds gave it a slightly crunchy nutty flavor. I was going to leave the nuts out all together but i think it would have changed how the topping cooked. I plan on taking this to work to share with my coworkers but I am not sure how much will be left!

Very good! Have made it twice and the second time I used a can of pumpkin pie filling that already has the sugar and spices and it was just as good if not better. Just omit the sugar and spices.

Good flavor. Smelled wonderful. But it's definately NOT a cake: more like a custard with a cruchy crumble on top. Maybe I'll try it again and swirl the cake mix in the top, cooking it a little longer than an hour and using foil so the nuts don't burn. I was so disappointed!

The only reason I gave this a four instead of five is due to the adjustments necessary.  I cut into the cake mix, with a pastry blender, unmelted butter and a beaten egg.  Used one tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. each of ginger, nutmeg and cloves.  It was good.

This turned out really good!  However, I did make a couple of changes.. I used a spice cake mix instead of just yellow and used a full cup of melted butter.  Yum!

I have made this recipe several times. Both ways, with spice cake and with a butter pecan cake mix. Really yummy! After it cools I top it with cool whip mixed with a few tablespoons of brown sugar and a splash of vanilla. Refrigerate and its soooo good!

I live in Cairo,Egypt. I crave anything with pumpkin in the fall. It's difficult to find canned pumpkin so when I do, I buy many cans. I tried this recipe last weekend for some friends. SWEET...way too sweet. I would cut out some of the sugar and maybe even use less of the cake mix. It was good though, but sweet.

Such an easy and delicious recipe! I didn't spread my cake mix out enough so the cake mix in the middle didn't completely bake.

Awesome... Agree it's better day 2,3,&4! I didn't melt the butter I cut it up like a traditional dump cake. Next time I will sprinkle cinnamon on top and skip the nuts. No complaints!

I read some of the suggestions shared for this recipe, so I added a full cup of butter, and like some others had done, I cut the butter into the cake mix instead of melting it.  I also added cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, ground ginger and cloves to the cake mix.  The house smelled absolutely heavenly while baking and really brought the Autumn season to life.  It is delicious and my whole family keeps digging a spoon into it every time they pass through the kitchen.  I am going to have to put it out of sight to keep them out of it.  Thanks for the recipe, Nancy!

This is delicious!  I only changed the butter to 1 stick and cut it into the dry cake mix, rather than melting it to drizzle on top.  I like both walnuts and almonds on top.  Also I used a lemon cake mix which didn't interfere with the pumpkin flavor and actually brightened it up just a bit.

So yummy!!!! I ate a piece as soon as I took it out of the oven. I did read the reviews and used 1 cup melted butter. All I had was white cake mix which worked fine. I had no pumpkin pie spice so I used a 1 tsp.  cinnamon and 1/4 tsp each of allspice and clove. WOW! New favorite dessert, and so easy to make.

I followed another similar recipe's suggestion of adding a "crust". I reserved one cup of the dry cake mix and the rest of the cake mix I combined one egg and 1/2 cup of melted butter.  I used this as the crust only because I worried the pumpkin mix might be too mushy. This came out great, I would love to try it next time with a graham cracker crust!

I loved the pumpkin middle, but I didn't much like the bottom layer. Maybe I used the wrong cake mix. I don't know.

I was so sad when at 38 minutes, 60% of the nuts had burned and about 1/3 of the topping remained dry powder. I had to tae it out because of the burning. 1/3 of it was presentable and tasty, the rest not. Perhaps it was the high altitude? Or just not enough butter to cover.

This tasted great!  It somehow cooked a little bit hard, maybe because of the butter?  You had to fight a bit to push your fork down into it.  But it tasted great, my guests enjoyed it.

This is unhealthy goodness! My friend made this once and we were addicted to the buttery topping. I was shocked when she shared the recipe and I realized how simple it was. I make it as is except for the nuts as my hubby doesn't like them. He is however crazy for the dessert, even asking for it in lieu of a cake for his July birthday!

I made this dessert for Thanksgiving dinner at my niece's house. I followed the directions and had no troubles with any of the measurements. I did use a white cake mix instead only because I needed to make sure no food coloring was involved. The butter amount was perfect. I suggest using a table spoon to drizzle the butter over the entire cake mix layer. You should have no problem getting good coverage that way, as apposed to pouring it from a measuring cup. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I made my own using allspice, cinnimon, nutmeg, and ginger. It was amazing! Everyone raved and I had to hide a few pieces to take home with us. Thanks for the great, and very easy to make recipe Nancy!

Delicious.  I used egg whites instead of regular eggs and pecans vs walnuts... not a big walnut fan on baked goods.. It was very good, esp with some whipped cream on top and a tall glass of cold milk.  My husband really loved it too.

Very good !! Easy and tasty. I thought the spice cake was a little spicey considering all the spices that go in it ( yes I did add some cinnamon ). Will use yellow cake next time.

This recipe was so easy, and everyone loved it including my kids.  My kids are such picky eaters, too.  I added more cinnamon.  I added cinnamon on top of the pumpkin layer before the cake, and then added it in with the cake topping.

THIS IS A MUST TRY DESSERT!!!! I love this dessert! I decided to sprinkle spice cake mix on top instead of yellow cake mix. I also used the pecans and walnuts that come in the little bag that are for snacking on they are sweeter and make this dessert absolutely mouth watering. It was a hit at my thanksgiving party last year.

This turned out just ok for me. The bottom layer was very mushy...it did not set up even after over an hour in the oven. If I had left it in longer, the topping would have been burnt. The flavor was good, especially the topping. I was somewhat underwhelmed.

DELicious!! I am not a baker and this recipe was so easy to make! I followed other reviews and added cinnamon which I thought was a nice touch. I did have to bake it longer and even then, it was very crumbly when I took it out--I had to let it sit overnight and then it held together better. So make this a day or two before you want to serve it and I promise it will be gobbled up immediately! =)

Very tasty. I will make again. Although I wasn't completely satisfied with the topping the first time. I will probably try it a different way next time. :)

I used some of the comments of others but in a different way.  I used 3/4 - 1 cup melted butter and poured it into the dry cake mix.  Then I stirred it to a  make a crumbly mixture and I sprinkled that on top of the pumpkin mixture.  Came out great but have to say that this desert is indeed MUCH better the second day.  It has much more flavor.

Excellent alternative to pumpkin pie!  Great taste!  I like the idea of drizzling a glaze over it when baked too.  As far as the butter is concerned, I used 3/4 cup but poured the melted butter into a squeeze bottle which helps to distribute the melted butter evenly over the surface of the cake mix.  I also stirred some ground ginger into some whipped cream that I used instead of ice cream.

Very delicious, but not quite as good as I thought it might be.  I cut in my 3/4 C butter to the cake mix before putting it on top of the pumpkin mixture as one user suggested.  Worked good.  I used half the sugar and couldn't tell any was missing.  I also add 1 tsp of cinnamon as many users suggested.  For all of the spice in this dessert, it wasn't nearly as flavorful as I expected.  Pretty good dessert though.  I might try a spice cake mix next time.

Yum.  This one is good.  I can't wait to try it again tonight with Ice Cream or even a really good homemade whipped cream.   My husband went back for seconds in less than 2 minutes!  That might be a record.

This was very good.  It was extremely moist.  I don't like pumpkin pie spice so I used 2 t of cinnamon instead.  Topped with vanilla ice cream.  YUMMY!

I too would cut the amount of sugar, but other than the sweetness, it was great.  I used a turkey baster to drizzle the melted butter on.

I just made this tonight and it was wonderful hot!  Can't wait to have it tomorrow, not sure how it could get much better, but I'm trusting the other reviews on this one that it is going to get better.  I did use 3/4 cup sugar, 1 cup butter mixed into spice cake mix with about 1/2 the nuts.

This is awesome! I even made it with a Gluten Free cake mix for my Mom who has Celiacs.  Tastes much better the next day and I used a full cup of butter.  Very nutty but love the crust the cake mix and the nuts make with the butter!

Ok, so I made this yesterday and wasn't quite thrilled with it but after reading the other reviews decided to give it a day of rest before making my final assessment.  Well today I L-O-V-E it!  Wouldn't change a thing except maybe cook it a little longer (maybe it's my oven).   Well, gotta run now and eat some more!

This recipe was very easy to make and very good, I would however change a few things....less sugar-1/2 cup should be enough use 1/4 white and 1/4 brown sugar- with the topping (Spice cake mix) I thought it was too sweet, more butter 1&1/4 Cup -hard to get the melted butter all over the dry top.  I think next time I make this I will swirl in the topping so it isn't all on top and then have less dry on top.  Very good over all!

I followed the recipe exactly, very easy to make.  It tasted and smelled wonderful.  I was expecting a different texture, it's more like a pumpkin pie with a crust.  But it is really good, great for this time of the year.  Tis a keeper in my kitchen.

I made this recipe last night for the first time, and I really liked it, but it definitely needs more spices.  I also used a sifter to put the cake mix on top of the pumpkin mixture to spread it more evenly and there wasn't any lumps of cake mix.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this for my family tonight. They all gave it five stars! The only changes I made was to make it in a jelly roll pan, cook for 50 min @ 350, and used pecans rather than walnuts. Will certainly make again! Thanks for sharing.

The first day it was just so so. It was much better the second day after sitting in the fridge. Made exactly as directed. I think it could have used a bit more flavor.

This was good, but we thought there was a drastic difference between the soft pumpkin base and the hard cake topping. Too many nuts. I won't be making this often.

This dessert is really good. I might mix more sugar and spice into the pumpkin next time and 1 hour was too long in my oven but still a hit.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

I thought the pumpkin part of this dessert was very good, but I thought the topping part was too sweet.  It still tastes very good, I would just prefer less sweetness.

I made this for the first time this weekend and took it to our church potluck.  Everyone loved it! I din't have any leftovers! It is very easy to make. There is no way you can mess this up!!!  Very similiar to pumpkin pie, but the topping really adds twist to traditional pumpkin pie!

I'm not really into pumpkin, but I made this because my husband really loves pumpkin desserts.  This was amazing!  It tasted more like sweet potato to me.  A different kind of dessert.  Really enjoyed this recipe, thanks!

This is a great recipe.  I have been making this for years for large gatherings and everyone loves it.  The only different is that we call it Pumpkin Dump cake.  Excellent.  I like it better than pumpkin pies.

We didn't think this even came close to comparing to pump. pie as a substitute. I thought it was too sweet. Neither of us liked the texture. I feel there needs to be a greater difference in texture between the pumpkin and the cake. ( I used the spice cake mix)I won't make it again. Certainly wouldn't call it great.

My family has asked me to bring this dessert to Thanksgiving for the past 3 years - they love it! I think they actually like it more than pumpkin pie.  It's a great, easy alternative and serves a lot of people! I make it according to the recipe instructions (except I used pecans instead of walnuts) and have always used yellow cake mix. It's really best when made the day before and refrigerated until serving.  Serve with whipped topping - mmmmm! You really can't mess this one up!

Wow, talk about a great fall dessert!  I used a scant cup of sugar based on reviews of the sweetness and I used only a 1/2 cup of melted butter (just seemed like to much).  I also had to make my own pumpkin pie spice and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  This was a big hit with some carmel cheesecake icecream on the side!  Everyone loved it!

SUPERB!!!!!!! I added cardamom, vanilla extract and rum in the pumpkin mixture. In addition, I substituted light brown sugar for the white. I also took the advice of another review and added cinnamon in the yellow cake mix and a stick of butter (a little much)With a nice cup coffee it is a great breakfast treat..HMMM

This was very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly and I loved it. Only complaint was from my fiance who said the topping was a little salty and he would have rather had pecans instead of walnuts. I will use unsalted butter next time and maybe do half the pan in pecans and the other in walnuts (i liked the walnuts). Other than that I loved this recipe. I will be sure to make this again.

I ended up eating almost all of it, but it wasn't great. I won't make this again.
I did not care for the cake topping at all and the consistency was a little off for me.

This is a great recipe!  I don't know how anyone can go wrong with this one.  I took it to the company potluck and they scraped the dish clean. Everybody wanted the recipe. I used pecans instead of walnuts because they usually make a better flavor combo with pumpkin than walnuts.

This recipe is wonderful! I don't usually like pumpkin pie, so I was worried I wouldn't like this either, but I loved it. It was gone within an hour and 4 people asked for the recipe. I did as some suggested and used spice cake and pecans, other than that I followed the recipe as written. So good!

This was definitely quick and easy, and unconventional.  I, too, used spice cake mix and topped with chopped pecans.  I drizzled spray butter vs. real butter, used 2% evaporated milk, and drizzled more butter over the pecans. It came out tasty and buttery and with less fat and calories!

I am not a fan of pumpkin pie, made this recipe for a friend who loves pumpkin pie.  Must admit I enjoyed it also, would make it again.  It will be on the dessert table during the holidays.

GREAT! It is just like streusel topped pie but in a cake pan. It turns out like a pumpkin pie IF you follow the instructions. Use evaporated milk as stated and bake as stated or until you test it with a knife and it comes out clean. I think next time I am going to bake it in a deep dish pie pan and put the streusel on top as this states but maybe use half the streusel amount then. It is quick and easy and will be made by me many times.

UNREAL!!! This dessert rocks! We had company over and they were fighting over who was going to get the crumbs after the dish was empty!! Can't wait to make it again this weekend. Per other readers...I tried the 1 cup of butter and used 1 tsp of cinnamon. This recipe rocks and now I have to forward this on to my mother-in-law b/c she loved it too.

This recipe is a keeper!I made it with pecans,and chilled it overnight before digging in. I don't even want to think about the calorie count.  I think I like it better than dump cake. It will be an annual treat.

So easy, and so good! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and a little mace, trying to come up with a combination that was around 4 tsp. Even with my imprecise measurements, it turned out just fine. Great Recipe!

This was so easy and so yummy.  Next time I will only bake for 50 minutes because it was a little over-done around the edges.  I also added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.

This was amazing! A big hit for all pumpkin lovers.... and very easy as well! I used pecans instead of walnuts because I like them better. Next time I might use a little less butter (maybe 1/2 cup-1stick), just seemed like I had alot on top..... but everything about this dessert was delicious! Everyone really enjoyed the layers.... bottom being like pumpkin pie, and top being crunchy crumbled cake! Yum!

This was soooo good!  I used canned pumpkin and used almost 1 cup of butter.  I made one for our church bake sale and it was sold within the first 5 minutes they were open!  I cooked it for about 70 min. to make sure pumpkin was thouroughly cooked.  The bottom layer tastes like pumpkin pie and the top is a wonderful cobbler type crust.

This is such a great recipe and so easy.  This is a great alternative to pumpkin pie.  We took the advice from the recipe and added a dolup of vanilla ice cream and a little whipped topping!  Thanks for posting this!

I took this dessert to my Bible study group last night and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I also used 1 cup of the melted butter.

This is an easy to make dessert as well as delicious.  My family loved it so I made it for a potluck.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I didn't change a thing, but did find 45 minutes baking time was perfect.

Very, very good, DH and I loved it.  I also used one cup of melted butter.  I found that I had to bake it a little longer than an hour for the middle to get done.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic and is similar to my Mom's dump cake recipe (uses fruit pie filling instead of pumpkin).  I used about 3/4 of a large can of Libby's pumpkin with the spices already included, and omited the sugar.  I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon and used a cup of melted butter as others suggested. It came out great. My husband loves this piled with whipped cream!

This is an awesome dessert!  I have been making this very dessert for years.  In fact, I'm not allowed to come to Thanksgiving dinner on my husband's side if I don't bring this along!
