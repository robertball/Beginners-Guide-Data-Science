Delicious! I sauteed a red and yellow bell pepper, a sweet onion, and added them to the chicken while I was boiling the rotini. Everyone loved it! I will use fat free italian dressing next time though as it was too oily in the crockpot and I had to dip that out before adding the noodles.

This was very good, and even better, super easy! I substituted a Tomato Basil Romano dressing (Wishbone Bountifuls) which is somewhat an Italian variety and it was delicious! I was a little skeptical because I didn't think it would be that great with so few ingredients, but I was very wrong! I will make it again.

This was lovely. I got the Baby Bella mushrooms from the local asian market on the cheap and added a sliced sweet onion. We ate it over steamed, buttered brown rice with steamed broccoli. There were no leftovers, my husband made sure of that.

It was good. I followed the recipe exactly - added nothing extra. The portabella mushrooms were "delish" they shrank big time and the chicken was very moist and just fell off the bones - ... I served the crock pot meal with rice or pasta for those who wanted either and a red sauce on the side for those that wanted that too.

I changed the Italian dressing to balsamic vinaigrette, the chicken just fell off the bone and the mushrooms added a lot of flavor. Definitely a family favorite and will be made again.

This recipe is def a keeper. I used the light italian dressing like stated in the reviews and baby bella mushrooms. I also added carrots and onions so we would have a more rounded meal. Everyone loved this and I have made it more than once now.

I wasn't real fond of this.  Maybe it was the dressing.  I used wishbone light itallian and it all came out tasting very vinegary.  I may try it again but definately pick your dressing wisely.  Perhaps a cheesy itallian with less vinegar in it.

This was amazing! The chicken was cooked perfect and fell right off the bones. I also threw in some fresh red peppers and asparagus while the water was boiling for the pasta, and deboned the chicken, letting it all simmer in the pot for 10 minutes. This is fantastic, and will be a favourite for years to come!

This smelled great while it was cooking but needed something else to bring out the flavors.  It tasted blah to me.  I used Kraft italian dressing.  It may have been better if I had used a better dressing such as Ken's or a Paul Newman dressing.  I was happy with how tender the chicken was.  I may try this recipe again with some added ingredients.

Sorry - I forgot to add the fat-free on the Italian dressing - big mistake - Loved the reviews too because I can't seem to follow a recipe without "tweaking" just a bit as well! Added all your goodies to  my version with jasmine rice tonight!! Thanks and Happy cooking!

Very simple. Very good. I made two small adjustments: I used boneless chicken breast and baby bella (crimini) mushrooms. The sauce from the dressing made a wonderful dressing for the angel hair pasta. We loved it! Next time, I will add a lot more mushrooms!

Well, it is the first time I have ever given a recipe a really bad review.  I was dubious before I decided to cook it only because the portobello mushrooms could make it really funky and dark but forged ahead anyway since our family likes chicken and mushrooms.  Plus it is hard to pass on a 4 ingredient recipe.  I followed the recipe as is with the exception of using a low fat dressing as others recommended.  The food did not smell good, taste good or look good (as I expected).  I ended up chopping up the mushrooms and some of the chicken, sauteing an onion, adding some peas and pesto to the whole mess in the pan and was able to then make something that would work on the pasta that was not entirely scary looking or nasty tasting.  I am really sorry, but this recipe did not succeed!  I would not recommend it.

This one did not turn out well. First, I don't know if my crockpot is not as big as normal, although it always has been plenty big, but I could only fit 3 portobello mushroom caps in. And it was in the crockpot for only about 4 hours and the chicken was dry. The mushrooms were slimy. The flavor of the italian dressing was good, but nothing else worked.

Excellent and it's so basic and easy! Took other's advice and used a fat-free dressing (Italian Caesar) and served over brown rice. So yummy!

This is very easy and cheap to make, so that helps it get a good rating. It's also pretty good. Not really amazing or special, but it is tasty.

If I ever try this again, I'll use double the amount of mushrooms. I used one container of mini portobellos. I also used half a bottle (8oz) of generic lite zesty Italian salad dressing. I don't like the lite stuff, but considering it is mixed with the chicken broth, I knew it'd tasty fine.

I left it in the crockpot for a full day at work (around 10 hours). The chicken was very good, moist, and falling off the bone. The mushrooms were my favorite part. 

Overall, it's a good recipe. I think adding some more mushrooms, onions, and maybe some diced carrots would be a nice addition.

Great recipe.  The chicken was really juicy and the dish was perfect over pasta.
I definitely altered it some:  I added baby carrots, garlic, and sliced onion.  I also used a sun dried tomato vinaigrette instead of regular Italian.  I think it's most important to pick a good-quality salad dressing and go with whatever variety you usually like best, since it's the main source of flavor in the meal.  
I also used fresh bone-in chicken breasts instead of frozen, so I reduced the cooking time, of course.  
All in all, yummy!

Wow!   Simple and delicious, my favorite kind of dish. I decided to make this when my husband and I were out in the woods, working on our cabin, with limited electricity and water - a crock pot dish seemed like a good solution, this was quite fancy for camping!  Definitely company worthy.  FYI, I read the reviews and used  2/3 of a bottle of Wishbone Romano Basil excellent! Don't think twice make this recipe!

I tried this because my family loves port. mushrooms  and chicken.  We were not thrilled with the final product, but it was acceptable for one meal.  The whole thing was a little greasy and overall just didn't produce a taste that wow'ed.  Maybe it was the dressing I chose, but I probably won't try the recipe again.

I followed the instructions to a T but I couldn't handle the taste, way too vinegary from all the dressing. However my boyfriend thought it was great! Won't make it again but clearly some may like it while others do not.

This was honestly inedible.  I followed the recipe to a tee, but the mushrooms just soaked up the acidity of the dressing, and it was incredibly bitter.  We took about 4 bites and threw the whole pot out.

Not our favorite.  The chicken did get dried out and the flavor was not quite what I had thought it might be.  Good, just not great.

Very good.  I only cooked half of the recipe.  I used one can of mushrooms, because I didn't have any portobellos on hand.  I also added sliced onion and sweet red and yellow peppers.  Cooked on high for 4 hours.  I used Wishbone House Italian dressing, and the flavor was good but not overpowering.  Next time I'll add some chopped spinach too.  I served this over white rice.  Thanks!

I tweaked this recipe because as a basic recipe it is just okay.  I used 1 can of Healthy Request Cream of Chicken soup (no MSG in this soup); 2 cups of Bernstein's Italian Dressing; 1/2 finely diced yellow onion, 1/2 package Baby Bella mushrooms that I thickly sliced and 1 Tablespoon of Mrs. Dash Original Seasoning and of course salt and pepper to taste.  OMG - was this ever good.  I also defrosted the chicken breasts first because of the salmonella issue.

The chicken wound up being pretty dry, despite sitting in a puddle of Italian dressing. The mushrooms soaked up a lot of the dressing, so their flavor was too strong. The noodles were only very vaguely flavored. This dish really didn't come together; it tasted like three separate (and not especially good) items on the same plate. That said, it was completely edible.

Its a pretty simple recipe but I think for me I should have cooked it on low while I was at work instead of high. It made the chicken extremely dark and I wasnt happy with that but it still tasted fine. I also want to try it with different dressing. Not a bad recipe just needs some tweaking.

This was very good! I did add one onion. Next time I will add peppers and spinach. YUMMMM!
I also used sliced portabello mushrooms since that was what I had on hand. Will be on our rotating schedule!

I followed the recipe exactly and they only part I really liked about this was the mushrooms.  The pasta was very bland since the juices from the dressing and chicken weren't enough to give it flavor.  The chicken was tender at least, but very bland as well.

I loved this! It was so easy to prepare and tasted absolutely delicious. I followed the instructions almost exactly...only difference was my chicken breasts were fresh, not frozen. I cooked it on low for about five hours or so and it was so tender it literally fell off the bone. It was also great as leftovers over pasta.

This was very easy to make on a humid day. You really don't need all that pasta. Next time I will make white rice instead. I will also add in an onion, and a pepper. I used 3 packages of baby bellas. It tasted pretty good. Nothing to rave about, but a definite keeper

I cut the recipe in half, and used boneless, skinless chicken breast rather than boned.  Cooked on low 5 hours.  Chicken dried out.  Mushrooms didn't have the wonderful flavor they usually do.  Might try this recipe again, using bone-in chicken breast.

Made it according to the recipe, I used the big portobello caps. I chose the recipe because it was very simple and I was very surprised how yummy it turned out.

Always follow the recipe exactly the first time and then tweak it next time if I feel like it needs it. This was a really good, and we enjoyed it but did think it was a little bland, so next time I would probably either use the zesty Italian dressing or add more spices.

I did make changes, and I will make it again! Instead of zesty Italian dressing, I used Wishbone Creamy Italian with Romano cheese. I then added some vegetable broth, some onions, and red pepper.  It turned out very moist and tasty. Definitely making this again!

This had a great flavor, but the chicken ended up very dry. Next time I might try with thigh meat instead of breasts.

So easy.  I added more mushrooms than recipe. The juice from the mushrooms combined with the Italian dressing made a delicious sauce.  Chicken was moist and delicious.

This recipe was super simple and tasted way better than expected. Next time I will add some baby tomato halves as I think they would go well with the Italian touch.

This chicken was amazing! I used 4 boneless frozen chicken breast, added them to the crock pot, used 1 8oz bottle of wishbone light Italian dressing, added a little garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste from other reviews, and added 1 can of cream of chicken to have more thickness and flavor. Cooked on low for 3 hours. Chicken came out perfect, very very tender and full of flavor. Made this with a bed of rice.

The chicken was dry and found it kind of flavorless. I would add water and italian seasoning in addition to what it calls for. Very filling though.

I won't make this again.  The chicken came out bland and tough (from cooking too long) and the recipe only calls for 8 ounces of dressing which is not enough liquid to even cover the chicken.  I had to add water.
