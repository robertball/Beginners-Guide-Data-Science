really great and easy. I was short on time so microwaved the beets instead (10 minutes on high). Thank you!

Very, very good!  It was way too hot to turn on the oven, so instead I peeled and cubed the beets, mixed together everything except the parsley and feta and wrapped in a double thickness foil pouch - roasted on the grill for about 15 minutes or so, then sprinkled with the parsley and feta.  DELICIOUS!  And good cold, too, as I'm still picking on the leftovers.

The best beets we've ever eaten.  I used green onions instead of shallots and I didn't have wine vinegar so used balsamic instead. These were so good we were craving them the following day and I think they were even better. Until yesterday I thought canned beets grew on trees!  They were much easier to cook than I imagined. This will be a regular recipe for us.

Just tried this recipe and loved it! I did make two changes though. I'm not a fan of raw onion flavor, so I carmelized the shallots in some of the olive oil first, and added a little garlic (who doesn't need more garlic?). The carmelization really bought out the sweetness in the shallots and balanced with the saltiness from the cheese and the tang of the vinegars.

Very good recipe! I bought some fresh beets at the farmer's market this morning and was looking for something different to do with them!

For those of you new to working with fresh beets some pointers. After you take the beets out of the oven let them rest for about 30 minutes. Put on a pair off latex gloves (the kind you wash dishes with) and just rub off the skin over a trashcan. Then using a sharp knife slice them as thinly as possible.

This recipe should be called Steamed Beets with Feta since that's what cooking in a foil packet is. If you peel and slice or dice the beets then pan roast with a little olive oil, S & P the natural sweetness of the beet comes through. It takes the same length of time and flavors are much more intense,

It is very rare to get a good beet recipe. This is a real good one - made it tonight, will make it again. My two and half year old also gobbled it up. Next time I will try to sprinkle some walnuts.

This recipe was delicious. It even enticed my feta-loving, beet-skeptical boyfriend. I used minced garlic and onion instead of the shallot, and it turned out great. It's equally good hot and fresh, or as cold leftovers.

pouring 1 tablespoon of water while wrapping the beets into aluminum foil helps to peel easily.

Very good, not much to improve upon.  I made the recipe just as is, and my husband and I enjoyed these tremendously. Little effort for an impressive dish.

This recipe is delicious as is, but I've made some modifications that IMO make it even better.  I saute the shallot in a little olive oil.  Once it's softened, almost carmelized I add rinsed, ripped pieces of the beet greens, then add 2-3 tablespoons of the dressing.  Once the greens are wilted I add the feta, give it a swirl, then dish it out, placing the sliced beets on top and drizzle some of the remaining dressing overtop.  I could eat this every day.

We like this a lot.  However, our beets were softball-sized and took 3hrs to soften to the center.  I recommend smaller beets!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used some sweet onion instead of the shallot, and omitted the red wine vinegar as I didn't have any on hand (instead, I increased the balsamic vinegar to 1.5 tbsp).  I will be making this often, especially since DH raved over it! Thanks so much for sharing.

This recipe is truely more than the sum of it's parts. I prepared the vinegarette and roasted and peeled the beets and refrigerated them overnight. The next day at lunch I sliced the beets and microwaved them for a minute. I then poured on the vinegrette and feta. Delicious! I used reduced fat feta and next time I will try the recipe with only one TBSP olive oil to cut the fat.

Wow! Yum!! So simple, but so good. I used golden beets, which have a milder flavor that the traditional red. A pinch of fresh chopped garlic was the only addition I made.  This will be served again in my house.

Fabulous!!  I made this two days ago... roasted the beets in the morning before church, and mixed up the vinaigrette, then sliced the beets and finished the prep right after church.  Ate them for lunch.  Today I'm eating the leftovers cold, and it's just as tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using 1/8 cup of finely minced onion instead of the shallot (didn't have).  Thanks for this tasty and simple recipe!

I think I just don't like beets. I followed the instructions... and I found a recipe b/c I decided to grow them in my garden, but I wasn't a huge fan. I may just not be a beet-liker.

I ADORE this recipe!! I followed the recipe to the "T" until I had to season with salt and pepper. After a liberal application of both, I deemed a dash of milk necessary - it diminishes the "bite" of the vinegars but leaves a very flavorful vinaigrette. The result was fabulous; I am so happy I made extra for lunch! Bon Appetite!!

I really enjoyed this, but my family did not.  I suppose I can make it for one from now on.  The beets were not quite tender after the 45 min, so I microwaved them for another 5 min.

I've only recently started using feta and I'm not sure how I like it with beets.  Otherwise, this was really good and I'll be making it again.  Thanks, Shandeen, for the recipe!

This was wonderful. Flavorful, pretty and easy to boot. I had to substitute garlic, spring onion and a little sweet onion for the shallots, rice wine vinegar for the red wine vinegar and goat cheese for the feta; but it was still terrific. So flavorful I forgot to save the last bite so I could try it cold. Can't wait to do this one again. UPDATE: Tried this with golden beets today, still excellent. Because I'm on low sodium restriction I'm sticking with the goat cheese, and I crumble it fresh over each serving to help it stay a little crumbly.

Easy & delicious. I served with a spinach salad & it was just great. I had never roasted beets before but they looked so good at the farm stand, I bought them and checked allrecipes right off. I did not change a thing except for using chives as suggested. Thanks Shandeen

We all loved these beets- even my husband who had already decided he'd hate them. Now, that's a good recipe!

I've never cooked fresh beets before.  So I printed two recipes from allrecipes, and both were great!  I do think this is my favorite.  They were wonderful!  I don't know what took me so long to try them.  Thanks

Can't stop eating this. Peeling them was a pain, but I'm sure it was my fault as I never cook beets and I have to figure out a way to do this better. Looked like there had been a murder in my kitchen by the time I was done... but was so worth it! YUM.

I loved this! It was my first time ever preparing beets and I don't think I'll need to look up any more beet recipes. i did cook them in the microwave instead of the oven, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. I will make it again for sure.

Wow!  I put these in foil on the grill and then added the feta after.  I also only had the balsamic vinegar, but it worked just fine without the other kind. HUGE hit with everyone.

Excellent, easy, and delicious! I happened to have some canned beets, so I used those and will probably do that again. 
The dressing is EXCEPTIONAL - so tasty. I'll use it for other salads as well.

generally have to be in the mood to eat beets, but these are yummy.  The Feta cheese and the balsamic vinegar give it just the right tang!!   Made a large batch and very glad I did, as we ate half of them with lunch. ;)

After being recommended beets to increase my iron intake I decided to try this recipe. If I knew beets were this good I would have started cooking them years ago! Terrific combination of subtle sweetness from the beets and salty from the feta with that wonderful balsamic acidity. I didn't have any shallots so I sauteed some onions in the olive oil before adding the vinegars. Even my 4 year old gobbled it up. Will be making this one over and over and over.....

This recipe changed my mind about not liking cooked beets ... what a wonderful flavour!  The only substitution I made was minced garlic (2 cloves) for the shallots (allergy).

I grew up eating so many beets that I vowed to never eat one again once I was on my own!! Well I am a convert!!! This recipe is just as good cold as it was warm. As a matter of fact I think I prefer it cold!! Just a warning with the feta though... add it when you serve it & don't overdo it... it can overpower the beets!! Great salad!!!

YUM!!  I've always considered myself a fan of beets, but to be honest, I'd only had them pickeled.  My friend brought me some fresh beets, so I decided to try my hand at cooking them.  This recipe is so easy and delicious! I actually roasted the beets two days prior to preparing this recipe.  I had peeled,sliced, and  refrigerated them.  I mixed the vinegar mixture together, while microwaving the beets to reheat them.  The flavor from the vinegars in combination with the feta is great.  I too used apple cider in combination with the red wine vinegar, since I didn't have any balsamic. I really enjoyed this "salad" and look forward to making it again.

I love beets! Roasted them a day or so prior, peeled and kept in the fridge. I liked the dressing but I add the oil last, drizzling in with an immersion blender to emulsify. You could also do this using a whisk to get a more blended, thicker dressing. I did add a bit more oil and a bit of sugar. I cut the beets into wedges, heated the beets back up, tossed with dressing and placed in small Boston Lettuce cups. I then topped with the cheese, I prefer Goat Cheese but Hubs likes the Feta. Either way, this was good!

I steamed the beets instead of roasting.  Recently, I read that aluminum foil was bad to use with food items.  I know it sounds crazy, but I figured might as well steam them instead to possibly be a little safer.  I added 2 cups of cooked quinoa to this as well.

Thought I didn't like beets, but these were delicious!  I've only had beets once or twice, years ago, and I had never cooked them myself.  I picked this recipe because of the great ratings, and it didn't disappoint!  To speed things up a bit I peeled and sliced the beets into 1/2 inch wedges, drizzled with a little olive oil, and salt and peppered lightly before roasting at 350 degrees.  They were done in 30 minutes.  I used onions instead of shallots, but otherwise no changes for the vinaigrette.  Wonderful!  Wish I remembered to take a picture before we gobbled them up because this recipe makes and elegant, gourmet-looking dish.

Very nice beet recipe. I followed the recipe as stated but had a flavored (pomegranate) balsamic vinegar. By the time we got around to eat the salad it was more room temp then warm. I love the way the parsley added a freshness. I think the only thing missing was a hint of garlic. That would have made it five stars for me. I will probably attempt this again adding minced garlic to the dressing.

I wanted to make this quicker than stated, so I took hint from another reviewer and cut the beets into cubes, put them in foil with the shallots, oil, and both vinegars, and put it on the grill for around 15 minutes.  Delicious!

I've never been the biggest beets fan, but we received a bunch of them in a local produce basket that we ordered. Happened to have all ingredients called for in this recipe. LOVED IT. It was way better than I expected. The feta cheese really makes all the difference.

Not much beats these beets!! I made this per the directions but added minced garlic because we like things garlic-y. I recommendation to wrap each beet individually really works so there are no over-cooked and under-cooked beets. There are so many good ways to eats roasted beets. We also like crumbled goat cheese, minced green onions, balsamic vinegar, sunflower seeds and, of course, minced garlic!

I loved this recipe!  Made it exactly as written (but carmelized the shallot in the evoo) and used fat-free President brand feta.  This one is going in our regular rotation.  Bravo!

Delicious! I only had onions, so I used those as well as canned beets. I cannot wait to get my hands on fresh beets and make this again!

Amazing...loved it...my only change was not to wrap in foil and roast my beets, but to clean and cut into chunks and roast with a lil olive oil, sea salt, pepper and some dried oregano. They were a perfect match for the dressing, I used low fat feta cheese and also added some sliced red onion. Delicious!

This recipe made me like beets.  I grew some beets in my garden for my neighbor and decided to try some myself.  This recipe is really delicious even for a non-beet lover as I previously was.  
I found it was not necessary to wrap the beets in foil.  I coated the beets in olive oil, then roasted them on a baking sheet.  The red wine vinegar and feta is also a great combo in case you're out of balsamic.

Wonderfully simple to make, yet divinely delectable! I love it. I substituted sweet onion for the shallot and skipped the parsley, and it was excellent. Thank you.

These were great! I don't like beets, but hubby does and wanted to try something besides boiling for an hour. I peeled and quartered them and roasted on the grill in a foil covered pan. Seasoned with olive oil and spepper. Made the dressing as per recipe and voila! I think I love beets now! Woo hoo :}

On our recent trip to NYC we tried beets and feta salad off of a "Schintzel and Things" food truck. It was soooo good that I started looking for a similar recipe. This one tastes even better!

I didn't like these warm at all, but I put them in the fridge and had them cold the next day and they were great. I also added a little sugar to the dressing.

Delicious!  Overpowered the taste of the beets a bit, but maybe I had too much of the dressing for the few beets I had.  I'll try with less dressing next time for more of the beet flavor.

DEEE-LISH! Simple and great way to prepare beets. I 86'd the shallots to keep things balanced. I used a cinnamon pear balsamic that put the beats over the top! I would imagine most fruit balsamic would work but you just can't beat pear!

I really liked this recipe. I wanted to make it on a work,so I tried baking the beets in a crock pot. I wrapped them in foil and set the crock pot for low. When I got home (8+hours later) they were cooked. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written

Nice, easy dish.  I roasted the beets with a roast I was making (make sure you put them in a baking dish b/c they'll leak!).  I used a green onion instead of the shallot and it worked well.

I can't get over how differently delicious this recipe is. I kept snacking on the leftovers. It's fabulous. My husband didn't care for it. The kids liked it. It was a really nice presentation. I used onions instead of shallots and I sauteed them in some of the oil.  I think that this would be a wonderful dish to take to a potluck. I tasted even better the next day cold.

This was delicious! I used fresh parsley and green onions from my garden and a nice red wine to replace the red wine vinegar, since we didn't have any. To make it into more of a main course, I made some homemade bacon bits and even my fiance who hates beets thought it was the best beet dish he had ever eaten!

absolutely loved LOVED it!   Will be using more beets and this dish is simple and so easy, I didn't have red wine vinegar but I did have some blueberry vinegar which I used -  Hope that helps - I will be trying the original version (with red wine vinegar)  next time!

This was plate-lickin' good.  I used green onion instead of shallots b/c that's all I had...paired with fresh parsley from my garden, it was summer fresh and delicious.  The beets I used were golden & I just put them all in one pan and covered it with foil to roast.  Peeling them was a bit of a pain, but it was well worth the effort.  I also used a really really good balsamic, so I'm sure that contributed to the flavor - overall, a really really great dish.

Yummy! I used two small bunches of beets from my co-op and they were so delicious. I never ate beets before, I wonder if supermarket beets would be just as good or if they were so delightful because they were picked a couple days ago. Either way, this is so tasty and my mom said "I would serve this to company".

Delicious! The colours in this dish present beautifully.  I used red onion instead of the shallots & the parsley added a wonderful fresh crispness.  I look forward to making this with shallots - tastes great!

This is just unbelievably good, one of the most beautiful and tasty dishes I have ever had.  We make this often.  I usually just use onions instead of shallots in the dressing and usually add a little extra cheese.

Made this pretty much as listed.  I "eyeballed" the dressing ingredients and used a bit more of everything.  It was very tasty and pretty.  Will definitely make again. (And will add a bit of minced garlic next time!) Update:  I use garlic and onion in place of the shallots.  I just made these for someone who said she didn't like beets and she went back for seconds!  Definitely toast the walnuts and sprinkle them over the cheese before serving.

I don't even make the dressing separately sometimes, just pour in all the ingredients and stir.

My husband is really into growing his own vegetables this year, and even though he says beets make him gag, he grew them. I used this recipe for our beets, and we finished all of them. I'm not a beet eater either, but I liked this recipe and would do it again. He only gagged once.

I was looking for a "different" side dish, and my husband suggested using beets - something we've not had before.  I found this recipe, and was intrigued by the ingredients and simplicity.  Not really knowing what to expect, I was surprised by how good it was, and my husband loved it!  Will definitely make again, although probably for an adults-only dinner, as my 15-yr-old took one taste and gave the rest to us.

The beets were tender but needed a brief reheat before serving. I've tried boiling the beets, but roasting improves the flavor.

Great flavor combination! I really enjoyed this recipe. The only change I made was to use finely chopped red onion instead of the shallot. The market had run out of shallots, still great with red onion.

The roasting method worked perfectly.  The flavour needed a bit more.  Maybe marinating the beets, then reheating would work.  I'll have to try this next time.

I actually used this as a guide to make a raw salad. I substituted carrots for half the beets and grated it all. I also used fresh cilantro as my herb because I didn't have parsley. I made the dressing as directed and mixed it and the feta through the shredded veggies. I thought it had a very nice flavor.

I've been on a "beet kick" lately so I've been trying a number of beet recipes from this site and this one is a definite keeper. I've always liked beets, but they've always been a "hard sell" in my household. Until last night, that is. I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used cider vinegar instead. For some reason I think that combining two different types of vinegar (regardless of which types?) is what makes this dish especially "special".

Excellent salad recipe that was a hit at Thanksgiving even with people who normally avoid beets! I used goat cheese instead and mixed into a bed of spring greens and baby arugula. This will be my go-to salad dressing at home-simple and delicious and healthy!

This recipe is the bomb! It’s currently late November and I still have beets sitting in my garden. Thought this would be a great way to use them. Turns out it was an AMAZING way to use them. I had a lot of little ones so I wrapped those together in a single packet, and the big beets as singles. Pretty simple. Followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely do this again!

I mixed half of the cheese into the beets and created a coating then garnished the top with more cheese. It created a lovely pink dressing and was well received.

This was outstanding!  Used fresh beets, green onion, chives and parsley from the garden.  Only modification was to top with  some chopped pepitas for some crunch - cuz' we love them and everything is better with pepitas.  ;-)

Love it!  Thinly sliced roasted beets on a bed of arugula.  Topped with walnuts, crumbled feta and sliced goat cheese, drizzled with a balsamic vinegar reduction.  I think this will be a salad for special occasions!

I don't usually like beets particularly but I got some fresh beets as part of a food coop bag.  Anyway I found this recipe and made it and it turned out I liked them.  I followed the recipe as written with no changes.  One reviewer had mentioned using latex gloves when you remove the skin from the cooled beets.  That was an excellent suggestion because the beet juice is very red and abundant and this kept my hands clean.  Again,  very good way to cook beets even for people who aren't crazy about them.

Love roast beets, but this is the last time I get sucked in by a recipe that tells you to roast beets in an hour or less. No way - you've got to either cut them small before roasting them, or pre-cook before putting in the oven. I'm still waiting for them not to be hard and it's been an hour and a half.

I got beets with greens in my CSA box this week. I boiled the beets until almost done. Peeled and sliced into wedges. Put on the roasting pan with some olive oil , onions, garlic, Roasted until the onions were done, then added the beet greens, the dressing and feta. So yummy!  Hubby liked it and he doesn't care much for beets. He does like the golden ones better.

OMG, so good!  I've had a hard time finding a recipe to use the beets I get at my local organic garden that I actually enjoy eating.  I've finally found it.  Stir fried some diced onion instead of raw onion and substituted white wine vinegar for red as it's what I had on hand.  Came out great.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was beautiful not to mention delicious.  It was gobbled up by adults and children alike.  Buy some surgical gloves  to keep your skin from being stained while peeling.

This is a great recipe definitely a keeper! I boiled instead of baked beets because I was in a hurry and it's a little faster but everything else was the same and they're very good!  I'll be making again

I improvised by cooking the beats the day ahead in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes, refrigerated them and peeled easily. I use golden beets, same flavor but no red stains on hands etc. this salad is a summer treat served chilled.

Yummmm!  Delicious!  I halved the recipe as I was making  it for 1 person.  I used green onions as I did not have shallots on hand. I also used dried parsley but much less than recipe recommendation as dried herbs are more potent than fresh herbs.  I took the advice of a previous review and added chopped walnuts to the top for a little crunch. Good call - thanks for that tip!   Lastly, I topped it with radish sprouts (micro sprouts) to give it a little kick.  Sprinkled with Feta.  So good!  I will definitely make this again.  Definitely wrap beets with tinfoil and cover 1" of greens sticking out of top as burnt beet drippings are difficult to get out of the pan.  Use latex gloves to peel skins as peeling beets are very messy.

Delicious! Lite, fresh, easy appetizer or side. I peeled the beets first then I wrapped them in foil. Mine took longer than an hour but they were delicious even without the cheese. I realized I was out of feta and used goat cheese instead. Delicious!! Will make them again with the feta.

I am already a beet lover, and I thought this is just another way of serving roasted beet. It was, but a unique one..! I just couldn't get enough of that combination of sweet, sour and salty !
This salad is pretty,  tasty and nutritious. I had to make some changes, but I don't think they affected much the overall taste. I used green onions for shallots. The only vinegar I had was apple cider vinegar. So I used it with a touch of sugar as it's more acidic than Balsamic vinegar.

I've made this many times now. Very versatile. I've used red onion or green onion. I ran out of balsamic and just used red wine vinegar. Always turns out. Delicious and when I bring it somewhere, people are always surprised beets are so good! It's also good cold the next day as a salad or on salad. Love it!

I am not a fan of beets and I must say that this recipe is very good. It actually can potentially entice me to eat beets more often as it was that good! I would highly recommend to read the article about 7 tips for roasting beets from this website especially, if this is the first time you try roasting beets in the oven or grill.  I prepared the recipe as is and needless to say it was tasty and really not that hard and elegant indeed!

What flavor' unexpected with beets. The key I think is good quality olive oil and vinegar. It's well worth the extra money. Going to be a staple on my list of vegetables.

A great way to prepare beets. After roasting, they are much easier to peel, which reduces the mess inherent in preparing beets.

Looking for a way to use beets grown in my garden.  This recipe was SUPER tasty. I did not change a thing.  I was skeptical but honestly, it was really fantastic !  Wow.

This was my first attempt at making raw beets.  This was fabulous and very easy.  Made it to the recipe using green onions rather than a shallot.  My husband can't stop raving about them and asking for more.

So tasty, and the dressing really compliments the flavours of the beets and the feta - I added a it of balsamic glaze with the two vinegars, which tempered their acidity and the shallots' sharpness. Will definitely make again.

This is soooo delicious!!!  The only change I had to make was to cook the beets for about 2 hours.  I had very large beets, but the first time I made it I had smaller ones and it still took longer than one hour to get them fork-tender.  If you don't get them fork-tender, the dish is still very delicious, it's just crunchy

I loved this recipe, it was a simple way to highlight beets. I only had 3 beets so they took a little less than an hour. The sweetness of the beets and the sour of the dressing combined with the saltiness of the cheese really balances everything.

I made this exactly as suggested.  My beets are the longer type and they were fabulous.  I ran them under cold water when I took them out of the foil and the skins slipped off easily.

Perfect as it is. I substituted chives for the shallots since that is what I had in my garden (and reduced the amount) and it turned up lovely.

I don't eat beets because I don't know what to do with them. However, I was determined to figure it out! This recipe was SUPER easy and quick; a great intro to cooking with beets I think.  AND YUMMY! I loved it. I ate it cold for my lunch the next day at work, and it was still great. Everyone at the office came over to check out my salad. I looked like someone who actually knows what they're doing in the kitchen...Thanks for this recipe!

I adapted this recipe a little.  I had two cans of red beets in the cupboard instead of buying fresh red beets and roasting them in the oven.  I just heated them up microwave for 3-4 minutes.  I also added 2 tsp. of lemon juice to the recipe.  Very tasty dish served warm or cold.  Will make again!

Love feta, love beets. This recipe was a perfect fit for me. Fairly simple to throw together. I followed the recipe as is and salt and peppered to taste. It turned out great. The flavors blend well and the consistency is on point. No complaints. I'll be adding this to my recipe book. Many thanks for sharing this with us.

Yes I tried it. It was great. I used red onion instead as I didn't have shallots and added cooked red quinoa to make it more of a main dish.  Yummy. Thanks.

I have made this recipe now twice in 1 week because it is so good.  Found that changing up the recipe brings out of course different flavors but both are amazing. I dint want to put down.  Just made a triple batch for a Christmas party.

Made in crock pot. Wrapped beets in foil and drizzled with olive oil. Caramelized onions and garlic before adding to vinaigrette. Delish!

I love beets and we grow a lot of them. I like this recipe because it's versatile but also good as is. A great basic recipe. If I have the energy and ingredients, once they've roasted and I can handle them, I peel them, cut them into wedges and toss with the vinegar and usually some toasted walnuts, S & P. Then I arrange them in individual dishes containing different salad greens. I drizzle olive olive over them, sprinkle the feta cheese on top and serve. Deelish!

I keep trying, but overall I really don't love the taste of beets... This recipe is really pretty good though. The vinegarette, feta, and warm beets blend really nicely. I will make it again and keep giving beets a chance! :)

Made several times and always turns out well. I have only tried with green onions and not shallots and don't bother exactly measuring. At a potluck I was told by people that didn't like beets that they liked this recipe! My mom says she just thinks roasted beets are better than boiled beets.

This is absolutely delicious!  The only thing I would change is to double the recipe.  I don't know if the beets I used were small (from my garden--first time growing them)but my husband and I ate the whole thing!  No leftovers to try cold like some people suggested.  I will be bringing this to the next pot-luck.  Thanks Shandeen :)

I cooked the foil wrapped beets on the top rack of my gas grill.  Everything came out perfect.  My wife who said she doesn't like beets, loves them now.

This recipe is a simple one for pickled beets and is very good as written. However I added extra balsamic vinegar (used 3 TABSP) and sliced rather than diced the onions. Instead of roasting I boiled the beets for 45 minutes (they each weighed about 6-7 oz). A little crumbled feta cheese on top when serving made the beets special.

Pulled the beets out of the garden, rinsed off and started cooking right away.  Instead of roasting in oven I roasted in the gas grill outside.  Turned the two side burners on and placed the beets on the other side of the grill.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great.

These were pretty good, though require a bit of messy work. Beets are notoriously messy and the juice will stain anything. I wore gloves so it wasn't too bad. These had a decent flavor, but they cool quickly. I think they would taste better warmer.

These beets are amazing! Using this recipe was my first ever attempt at cooking my own beets and it was so good I've made them twice this week. Only change I made was using goat cheese instead of feta. Highly recommend!

I loved this recipe, but my family didn't. I used yellow beets instead of red, so it may have tasted different. I loved the idea of combining feta with cheese.

I enjoyed this recipe. I wanted more of a traditional salad feel, so I served this tossed with baby greens. The salad dressing was very good. My husband is usually the dressing maker, so I was relieved that it needed no doctoring. I used the green onions from our waning garden, but I'm sure shallots would have been great. I roasted the beets with some chopped garlic on top as I saw suggested in another similar recipe. YUM!

This recipe was really great. We used golden beets from the farmer's market and I actually served it chilled, which was nice because it is HOT out. We will definitely make this again...maybe tomorrow!

My whole family loved everything about this dish. It's really easy and tastes great. I have used fresh and canned beets- fresh is better of course but canned worked well. Thanks for sharing.

I have to say, baking the beets in foil rather than cooking them, preserves all of the nutrients. I've also made this without the feta cheese and added some chopped garlic to the dressing. Amazingly delicious either way.

Used green onions instead.  DELICIOUS!  My husband is a picky eater but he loved it.  The onion and feta flavors go well together.

These were delicious! I have to say though, that I needed to roast my beets for about 1 hr 20 min or longer. Next time I think I will boil them then roast them. Otherwise the flavours worked great. My husband loved them even though he's not a huge fan of balsamic. I didn't change anything as I had all the ingredients on hand. I did however slice them in about 1/4 inch thick round slices, which looked really nice when plated. Thanks!

I didn't think I was much of a beet fan, but I've changed my mind. After getting some fresh beets from a friend, I tried this recipe (microwaving, rather than roasting). Loved it! Quick and pretty easy (but stains your hands temporarily).

I substituted crumbled chevre for the feta, which gives it a creamier flavor. Still my favorite way to make chard, though. Earthy and delicious!

Wow! these were exceptional. I have been trying beets various ways lately and these are the best yet. The roasting combined with the nice dressing is just wonderful. I found I only needed 1/2 the dressing called for and saved the rest for my salad tomorrow.

Very good recipe.  I omitted the shallots and after allowing the beets to cool just a bit more after applying the cheese, I placed them on a bed of arugula.  I normally put goat cheese with beets.  But, the feta was a nice change.  Thanks!

I do not like beets, but I like beets prepared this way.  I substituted green onions for shallots and followed the recipe as instructed.  I did add my own twist and serve the beets over a bed of lettuce.  A nice healthy meal.

I had a roasted beet salad with blue cheese and pecans that was delish and thought this was very similar.  I bought 6 small beet- with the greens already trimmed.  Next time I would make more "dressing" for this amount.  I ate it cold as a salad.  Next time will also try blue cheese instead of the feta.

Addictive! I almost didn't try the recipe b/c I'm not a feta fan.  I found Vigo Sheep's Milk Feta at Publix - Amazing.  Speed the prep time by plunging the beets in ice water, foil and all, for about 15 minutes when they come out of the oven.

I have absolutely HATED beets my whole life. And I'm not a picky eater; I would even eat canned spinnach as a kid sometimes! (ew, I know!) BUT I love this salad. This is a perfect beet recipe. I like to add walnuts as well and it's delicious.

Best Beets I have ever eaten.  (I hate beets) and this is a weekly favorite now.  I use lots of the green onions, and changed the red wine vinegar to raspberry wine vinegar. I added about a tablespoon more or less of Ideal 0 cal. brown sugar substitute. I left out the salt because the feta is salty enough. It's sweet and tart, and we can't get enough of this.

By far my favorite beet recipe, the only change I made was that I used green onions in place of shallots because that was all I had on hand.  They were so good my wife and I ate the entire batch before we even looked at our main course.

This is a nice recipe, I like keeping some roasted beets on hand and usually use them (cold) as a salad topping. Also, I like golden beets better. I have a very small enamelled cast-iron pot which I drizzle a bit of olive oil into. Then quarter the beets and toss them into to pot with a fat pinch of rosemary, and another of thyme. I cover the pot with foil and put it into the back of the oven when I am baking other things and just forget about them for 45 or 50 minutes. Once they are cool I put them in the fridge to have on hand for my salads. I also enjoy the beets with goat feta (great pairing), and sometimes use a balsamic/olive oil/black pepper dressing, but generally because of the dense flavours of the feta and beet, I will opt for olive oil with fresh lemon juice dressing. The bright flavour of the lemon is a nice contrast. I also like this with lots of fresh tomato wedges.

My first attempt at roasting beets.  I used the toaster oven and it worked perfectly.  Used 1T dried parsley instead of fresh and cookecd the diced shallots in spray butter before adding to the dressing.   My DH who didn't even want to try them loved them.  Who knew?

Great as a salad.  I didn't have many beets, but I had dinner guests coming. In order to make the beets stretch, I roasted and chilled them in the morning and that evening when I got home I dressed some arugala with olive oil and lemon juice added the chilled beets and feta. Fabulous!!

I had never made fresh beets, but ended up with a ton of them and found this recipe. This dish is so simple and delicious. I made the vinaigrette in my mini food processor and it was so easy. I followed the recipe almost to a T (except I added 1t. of sea salt to the vinaigrette). Will definitely make again.

Perfect recipe for my CSA beets!   I had left over dressing and used it on salad the next day.

Very good. We aren't beet lovers, but we got beets in our CSA box this week so I needed to find a way to prepare them. This was delicious.

Excellent.  Try substituting the feta with goat cheese for a slightly richer flavor.

This recipe is easy and full of flavor. I loved the backed version vs. boiling the beets. I made little sample bowl and it didn't last 3 minutes at dinner table.

Great way to enjoy beets.  I have converted beet-haters into beet-lovers with this recipe!  If subbing green onion/chives for shallot, I would add a bit of minced garlic as well.

I made this for a potluck.  Everyone who liked beets liked this.  I'd never had beets before and still liked it with a little extra feta.  It's good hot or cold.

This is the most delicious recipe for beets I've ever tasted.  I was a little skeptical, but the combination of flavors was really amazing.  No modifications needed...try this recipe :)

First time in my life that I cooked real beets and it so easy and they were so good!  We love any dish with Feta and this was a hit with everyone.  It also brought a lot of color to the meal.

this is soooo good! and easy!  I just roast the beets while I roast baked potatoes & the Spicy Rapid Roast Chicken by Nancy from this website -all of the above cook in the same time frame so you are getting a wonderful meal that is "green" to prepare because you are using just one heat source-very efficent.  Thanks for the super good recipe!

I loved roasted veggies, and beets are no different! I didn't have shallots, so I used so finely diced onion. I also didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I left that out. I added a handful of toasted walnuts because I thought the crunch would be nice and the flavor would complement the beets and feta. I was right! Yummy!

The flavors didn't mix for me.  There was beet and then there were the other flavors.  It was fine, but not wonderful.

I make my beets on a baking sheet with oil, salt and pepper on 350 for 1-2 hours covered in foil. I was looking for new ideas and the dressing for this salad is great.  Thank you,

These are delicious!   I probably could have eaten the beets straight out of the oven!  I would cut the olive oil to 1 T.  I would also make the dressing ahead of time to cut down on the raw onion taste from the shallot.  Other than that, delicious recipe!  Thanks.

We all loved this.  Our garden beets were already boiled and peeled and sliced so I was looking for a different way to serve them.  This dressing was very nice and tasty. The only downfall was that I didn't make enough...

Super yummy side dish - this one is a keeper. It is really simple and with the beets in the oven you are free to prepare other things. My guests loved it and asked for the recipe. :)

Love it.  My husband says it's the best vegetable recipe he's had in a while.  I did not have shallots, but next time I will add them.  There will be a next time!
