These didn't taste like an apple pie
moonshine like it should be.  Although, it is smooth tasting but could use more everclear and a hint of something else.  I would lessen the vodka since it stuck out a lot, other than that, it's a lovely treat for the holidays especially for those who like to give out homemade gifts in mason jars :) .  I should mention that the state of california does not sell 190 proof only 151.

Not like grandmas moonshine, but it's not bad. Easy to prepare. And you can get 190 proof in CA, only on military bases though.

I made this and used spiced rum and apple vodka in one batch and spiced rum and caramel vodka in another batch.  It was such a hit for Christmas that I have already had two people requesting more.  Tonight we are making it and I think I am going to cut the sugar in half and see if it is a little less sweet.  It's a pretty easy and fun gift to give!

I really like this. I made this yesterday. I used 2 different vodkas a 80 proof and the vanilla vodka. I do think it is way too much sugar for this. It is very sweet. I will cut the sugar in half next time and see how it is. I am over all happy with this. It really does taste like Apple pie with vanilla ice cream. I will be giving my family some of this...=) I notice if you leave the cinnamon stick in it gets a very strong cinnamon flavor. If you don't like a strong cinnamon flavor don't leave the cinnamon stick in the jars.

So I use a gallon of cider and a 1/2 gallon of apple juice. For those commenting on cutting the sugar, once you store it for a bit the sugar helps if ferment and it gets more delicious. I made the mistake of making it one day before a party. People liked it, but it was so much better after a couple of weeks.

Way too much sugar, not enough liquor and I used 151 and everclear. I'll be adding a bit more of each and cutting the white sugar in half on the next batch.

I made it, very very sweet and could taste the vodka so I'll cut the sugar quite a bit next time. But I couldn't figure out where to use the apple pie spice it mentioned in the ingredients list but not in the cooking directions -_-

I like to use vanilla or whipped cream flavored vodka.  Also adding a little whipped cream is a nice touch.

Made with a few modifications:
- Used 3 cups of brown sugar and one cup of white
- Added 2 tsps of vanilla
- Added spiced rum

Was a hit!!!!  Had to make a second batch.  Hid a bottle so I could let it sit to see how it tastes after sitting for a few weeks.

So Cider was on sale, and I've wanted to make this stuff for while.  Changed the quantity to 50 servings, refuse to use apple juice.  So ALL Cider, and no vodka, just grain alcohol.  I am going to add Vanilla.  I made 1 batch with (4) cloves, this batch has none, but doubled cinnamon sticks both batches.  I have made other cordial type things and the longer you let it sit in the fridge the better it gets.  The alcohol will blend if you give it time, so its not as present.  I simmer for 2 hours, and put pot in sink of ice water.  chills in 1/4 of the time.

I have made this recipe many times and it has always turned out great! I am not a big fan of cinnamon or added sugar and have always stuck with the below even simpler recipe.

1 gallon juice
1 gallon cider
1 liter Everclear

This time I tried a different websites recipe which called for 1 gallon of Indian Summer brand juice and 1 gallon Indian Summer brand cider and 1.75 liters of Everclear. I only put in maybe 1.25 liters of the everclear cause I didnt want it to taste overly powerful of grain alcohol and it still is nearly undrinkable. I have added 4 cups of brown sugar to each gallon jug and it still tastes terrible, I think ill probably just dump it all down the drain at this point!

The takeaway of this lesson is never use Indian Summer brand juice as it doesn't cut the grain alcohol worth a .

1) The alcohol content of this is roughly 10%, putting it at slightly less alcoholic than wine. It's got some kick to it, but it is a cocktail in itself vs being a flavored liquor. 
2) No, it does not become more alcoholic in time. There is nothing in this (ie yeast) that would ferment the sugar.
3) The other reviews are right; this is horrifically sweet as-is. I actually thought it was best fresh. At one week it was disgustingly sweet, two weeks was slightly less terrible, but still worse than the day I made it.
4) All that said, it's a nice blend of flavors and I'll be trying a modified version of this (with much less sugar, maybe more alcohol) soon.

Not hard to make, but a little bit too sweet. Cut the sugars to about a 1/2 cup might do.

I substituted spiced rum for the vodka, and cut the amount of sugar by half. Came out amazing! Also, doesn't need to be stored in the fridge. I stored mine in Mason Jars in my pantry over 8 months.

We made at Thanksgiving and just got done making for Christmas. Big hit and super easy! We are trying caramel vodka this round! I say keep tweaking with different kinds of alcohol to your preferred taste!

I liked this quite a bit, I did use dark brown sugar instead of white, and added two cups of vanilla vodka, two cups 90 proof spiced rum, and everclear. Too sweet for more than a little at a time but it is exactly what you think it would be.

This stuff is amazingly simple and festive! It makes great holiday gifts for those hard to shop as well as for  colleagues. Just remember to label as potent alcohol!
