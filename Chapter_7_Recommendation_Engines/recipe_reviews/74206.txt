I was worried that this recipe would not turn out as the batter was really runny but it firmed up and came out well.  My kids really enjoyed eating this loaf and it was extremely easy to make.

I've had a recipe similar to this one for a long time, the only difference being that the recipe I have uses a teaspoon of vanilla in the batter as well.  Its incredibly handy when you need to make something for a take-a-plate and you arent sure if there will be vegetarians there.  This recipe has many fans, I get regular requests for it :)

I am also a seasoned baker and found this recipe to be super easy and quick ...I did make a few additions like I added about 1/2 cup more flour,1 teaspoon vanilla and a small can of coconut milk instead of milk...also added about 3/4 teaspoon baking powder and a pinch of salt...I used about 3/4 cup water as well....it rose higher and wasn't squishy and was perfectly dry on the bottom and done..not like others results...it is moist and scrumptious!.awesome loaf..family loved it!

I was very skeptical about this 4 ingredient recipe.  It turned out lovely.  It isn't too sweet and mine came out very dense.  It is really good with jam.  I would make it again.

Bread was delicious.  Did not have self-rising flour.  Made my own by adding 1 1/2 teasp. backing powder & 1/2 teasp. salt.  Then increased temp. to 360 degrees, used 9x5 metal, greased pan. Baked for 50 minutes and probably could have baked another 3 minutes or so.  Bread a little gooey at bottom.  Bread did not rise very high.  I did not expect it to from other reviews.  My husband said this recipe is a keeper.  Will make again.

This recipe is so unique and easy that I had to try it.  My mom LOVES coconut so I made it for her.  I had to bake my for quite a bit longer than the recipe calls for (after a while I gave up keeping track) and it still was a little underbaked.  It is very dense and very moist with a good flavor.  My mom loved it and said that it tasted like macaroons so she was happy.  I'm going to make it again and bake it for even longer and I think I will be happier with it.

I'm really good at baking and I guess I should have known that this sounded too good to be true.  I baked this lots longer than it called for and it still wasn't done.  I ended up throwing it away.  Hmmm, not sure why I expected it to be simple and good...

My cake turned out squishy and without much flavor--all of the coconut floated to the top and the bottom was not very appetizing. I would suggest doing this in a shallower pan instead of what the recipe says. Also, adding vanilla, coconut, or almond extract would give it that extra kick.

I didn't have enough milk so i used sour cream as a substitute and i put the batter in a shallow 9" square pan making it very thin.   It cooked nicely but was as well a bit under cooked at the bottom so i sliced the loaf up and put it back in the oven for another ten minutes and voila!! i make it into biscotti!!  
Thank you this recipe is great.

I found this recipe while searching for a recipe that included the only ingredients I had in my cupboard at the time. The idea of it was great! However, the recipe didn't turn out well for me at all. It turned out gooey and sticky, almost pudding-like. My husband really liked it though! I ended up picking at it, and the taste was good, I just couldn't get past the consistency.

The first time I made this recipe I didn't make any changes. It was flavorful but a bit dry. The second time, I added chopped dried apricots and coconut flour. It was a little sweet and very crumbly. If I add dried fruit next time, I will use half a cup of sugar.

I didn't have self-rising flour, so I followed another reviewers lead and added 2.5 tsp baking powder. I added 1/3 cup more flour and decreased milk a little. I used a combination of raw coconut powder and flaked unsweetened and  added 1tsp vanilla. Baked at 360 for 55 minutes. Came out dense and moist, not too sweet. We love it. Will definitely be making it again!
