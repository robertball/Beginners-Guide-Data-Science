I made a half recipe of this. The cream cheese I used was reduced fat. This was a tasty spread but a little light on the garlic, very heavy on the cream cheese flavor. I think this would be outstanding with some fresh minced garlic. I'll try that again next time.

Definitely creamy and rich, a nice take on traditional garlic bread for sure! I did use 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder and opted to used a some fresh minced garlic . I also added in just a little oregano. Overall, very tasty.

Pretty darn tasty. . . I think real garlic always supercedes using just powder when the occasion arises. Other than that keep to the recipe. Watch out for that always tricky broiler though. The thick creaminess of the topping is more susceptible to burn than most things. Literally a window of just a few seconds between done and burning. But just slice it up once its done and toss the pieces in a bread basket like you would with any other loaf and I guarantee it will be a party favorite. . .

This was good, but I found it to be a little heavy on the cream cheese and a little light on the garlic flavor - I'd use about half the cream cheese and add in minced garlic for our personal tastes and preference next time. :)

This was kind of heavy, due to the cream cheese, I guess.  I have had better.
