I used this recipe at my sister's 4th of July cookout for about 25 people so I bought 30 ears of corn. I used a roaster to cook some and we put several on the grill as well. I did not use horseradish in the sauce and also I used about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of the mustard per recipe ( I made about 5 times as much) but the sauce turned out excellant, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. This is a keeper!

This corn turned out fabulous cooked right in the oven. It was perfectly tender and the mustard took an already excellent vegetable to the next level. I actually took out the horseradish from the recipe because I don't like it but it was still terrific! I'm making it again tonight.

This was good! My husband got a gas grill and we were trying it out, and I was asked how to cook corn on the grill. I had no idea so I snuck into the office and got on my computer, AR of course! Anyway, it turned out really good, however, I might omit the horseardish next time. I think it gave it a bit of a weird flavor. Thanks for the recipe/letting me try something new!

I disagree with most of the reviews in saying that the horseradish ruined it. I loved the "sauce mix" and thought that it really made it delicious! It was really easy to make and I already had most of the ingredients so it didn't cost a dime. I will certainly make this again!

This was delicious!  It probably helped that I had the best sweet corn.  I brushed the butter, mustard, horseradish mixture on as soon as I took the corn out of the oven.  It was perfect, the best new recipe I have found for corn on the cob.  I will definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe to a T, only exception using butter instead of cooking spray on foil. Huge hit!  We loved it...second day cut it off the husk and ate it as the "creamed" version.  Would not change a thing!

What a nice change.  I like a lot of different seasonings for corn-on-the-cob (butter, lemon pepper, paprika, and Cavendar's Greek Seasoning)  this is nice one for even more variety.  Thanks.

Awesome!!! I just shucked the corn and brushed them with butter then rolled them in foil and baked it for 25 mins.  My husband immediately gave me a "thumbs up" :-)  I was a little leary of adding all the other ingredients/spices for fear of ruining some good ole sweet corn in its own beauty :-P

Perfect. Put them in the oven while everything else was going on and the family Loved it.  Didn't use the horseradish either just for family preference.

I roasted my corn in the oven.  It was delicious.  I did brush the sauce on the corn after 25 mins and put it back in for 5.  Yum.  My husband and daughter loved it.

Gives a great "kick"; I went the oven route and cooked the corn for 30 minutes. I brushed the ears as soon as they came out of the ovem and my husband added a ton more as he was eating it. Will use this recipe again.

Prepared it exactly as written, only adjusting down for serving size.  Cooked the corn on the grill and slathered the sauce on right after.  Delicious~ found the bite of the horseradish and mustard to be just right. Definitely will try again when I have more people around to serve...

This was great.  I usually cook corn this way on the grill.  I cooked the corn on 425 degrees for 20 minutes.  I didn't make the sauce, just put some marg. and wrapped in foil.  Great corn!

Not great, but okay.  I would have given this 3 stars but I don't care for horseradish in the first place, so I might try again and omit that component.

thanks for the easy way to make corn. Much tastier than just boiling it, and more fool proof than grilling.

I didn't think the flavors blended well on this dish.  I prefer mine with just butter, salt, and pepper.

We have worked this into our regular rotation. We'll make a batch of the sauce and put the leftovers in the fridge for next time - it keeps really well!

This is a great recipe!  I didn't use the horseradish & used Honey Dijon mustard & it was still outstanding.  My boyfriend was raving about them.  This recipe is definitely a must have for summer corn!

This is delicious! So easy to do. I didn't have dijon or horseradish but I did have horseradish mustard! Works great, everyone who has tried it has loved it.
