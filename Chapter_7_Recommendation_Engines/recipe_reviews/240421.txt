I didn’t need a full 9x13 pan so I made half the recipe, baking it in a 9 inch pie pan.  I used three eggs and baked it for 60 minutes.  This is an incredibly easy recipe if you are looking for a recipe that is quick to put together.  It’s simple and light, and wonderful served with a fruit topping.

I also cut this recipe in half as there is just the two of us now.  Very quick and easy.  I reduced some raspberries and added to a simple syrup and top this 'pie' with it.

I left out the cinnamon & added the zest from one orange, together with 1/4 C.  mini-chocolate morsels.  I used 1/3 C. Truvia instead of a cup of sugar.  The problem I had was all the liquid in the bottom of the dish after the pie was cooked (and I used lowfat ricotta cheese).  Next time I will let the ricotta drain over cheesecloth over night to see if this makes a difference.

Even though it wasn't what I intended or expected, it was delicious. Super easy to put together. It was not the consistency of Italian Ricotta Pie, more like a Flan. VERY moist, almost wet. I added zest of an orange. I think for next time I'll halve the cinnamon and try to find a way to make it less moist. Nice high protein, sweet treat!!

I was looking for something to use up some ricotta cheese, and this looked good. I scaled it down to 5 servings, which used 2 eggs. My 15oz container of cheese was about 3/4 full. I would cut back on the sugar just a bit the next time; if I want sweet, I'd rather have it from a fruit topping. I used a 1.5 qt rectangular casserole dish.  Also, several reviewers mentioned the texture was smooth like a flan (from using a mixer?).  I wanted a grainy texture, so I mixed it by hand for about a minute, and it came out the way I wanted it. I took it out of the oven after about 50 min as the sides were starting to brown. Having it warm is not the best, but I was anxious to try it.  I did omit the cinnamon and did not miss the crust at all. I'm sure it will be better after being refrigerated. Thanks for this very good recipe!

This was okay.  The consistency wasn't very smooth and a bit grainy.  Tastes similar to a flan, but you can taste the ricotta.
