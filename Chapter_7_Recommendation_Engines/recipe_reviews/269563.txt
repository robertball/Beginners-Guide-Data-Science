12.30.18 My scallops were previously frozen, and although they were defrosted and drained as well as possible, I knew that additional water would cook out of them, thinning out the soup.  Knowing that, I made additional roux, so the soup was super thick (the way we like chowder) before the scallops and potatoes even went in.  Only did a couple things  differently.  I had no vegetable broth on hand, so I used chicken, and it was fine.  These were "small"  bay scallops, not sea scallops,  and I could not see the need to cut them into smaller pieces.  Honestly, I wouldn’t dedicate the time to do that with a pound of bay scallops ever (too labor intensive).  This turned out well, and I wouldn’t hesitate to serve this for a company dinner, especially an appetizer portion.  Bekka, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I transferred the soup base to a slow cooker and let it simmer for an hour or two, then added the scallops an hour or so before I wanted to serve it.
