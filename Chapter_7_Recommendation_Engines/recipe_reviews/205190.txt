Hubs and I each had a downsized version of this for fun, because it sounded good, because it caught my eye as I'm originally a Minnesota girl and because we were curious to see if it would clean the Colorado Bulldog's clock.  (It did, by the way).  As instructed, we made the drink in layers and drank it the same way, without stirring. The layers slightly blended, but we could still taste each layer. This was good!  And  interestingly cool looking too! The Bulldog on the other hand, a similar drink made with cola instead of root beer, was simply not in the Poodle's league!

Surprizingly, this was real good. I used Diet A&W and FF half and half. After taking a sip, I did add one more jigger of vodka, only because I like my drinks stronger. I like this!

Yum. This tastes like a root beer float.

Like the beautiful love child of a Black Russian and a root beer float. I'm saving  this recipe for sure!
