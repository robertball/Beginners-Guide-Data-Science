I made this as a side for my chicken, and it turned out great. Making it again tonight because I used too spicy of a pepper jack cheese the first time.

I had some broccoli and cauliflower florets from a veggie tray that I needed to use and found this recipe.  I liked the fact that it was "low carb" and would allow me to use up a large quantity veggies.  I used my food processor to make the cauliflower "rice" instead of a  blender with water.  I also did not boil it as recommended in the instructions.  I had fresh chicken breasts that I cut into cubes and cooked it in a skillet with olive oil and chopped onion.   I added some garlic, salt and pepper.  When the chicken was cooked, I placed the mixture in a casserole dish.  Since I was using fresh broccoli, I par boiled it just until bright green (about 3 - 4) minutes, drained it and added it to the chicken and onion mixture in the casserole dish.  I decided to make a basic white sauce in the same skillet that the chicken had been sauteed in (1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour, salt, pepper and about 1 3/4 cup milk).   I stirred in the cauliflower rice while the sauce was thickening.  After the sauce thickened, I added about 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese.  The sauce was then added to the casserole dish and stirred until combined.  I topped it all with about 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese.   This was baked at 375 for about 45-50 mins until bubbly and a little browned on the top.  It was very tasty!

HH is lactose intolerant, so the cheese presented a challenge.  I had to substitute lactose free milk for the cream, and used only a small amount of aged Parmesan instead of the  cheeses. I also used fresh broccoli - I parboiled it in the water that I used to poach the chicken. I bought Trader Joe's bag of riced cauliflower and stir fried it in a little olive oil before I stir fried the onion and celery (and fresh garlic - subbed for the powdered garlic) So really, very close to the original recipe except much less cheese. They loved it and recent college grad son took most of the leftovers home - he was enchanted. XXOO from us, and thanks for the great recipe. BTW, this made enough for 8 hungry people.
