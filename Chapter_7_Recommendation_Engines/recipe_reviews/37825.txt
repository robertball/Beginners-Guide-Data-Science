Fantastic summer pie. For a less tart flavor, just use less lemonade. Very refreshing.

We made this recipe last month. It's not very good at all. You can't even taste any lemonade. And the Cool Whip ruins it all. Don't waste your time. =(

I have made this recipe with non fat frozen yogurt, and non fat Cool Whip.  Also have subsituted limeade for the lemonade.  Who knows, I may try frozen pina colada mix or bacardi mix next.  ALWAYS A HIT WHEN I SERVE THIS PIE !!!

This was a very simple recipe to make. I substituted Limeade concentrate and 2 tsp of lime zest for a "Key Lime" style pie. It was delicious!

My family loved this pie.  The only draw back to this recipe was having to wait for the pie to freeze.

Great!  Always great for family gatherings on hot days.  I use only about 1/2 the lemonade and add 1 packet of Crystallight lemonade mix - makes it really lemony and a little thicker for mounding.  Have recommended the recipe - and all have enjoyed.

I have been making this pie for several years and it's always a BIG hit.  I often add a few drops of yellow food coloring just to give it the nice yellow color.
