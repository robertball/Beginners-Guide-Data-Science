Made these for church on Sunday, one batch with peppermint and one with almond. I didn't even get to sample one they were gone that quick.

Used tsp fresh lemon juice as I didn't have cream of tarter, twice the color first batch and 5 drops more second batch (I was making them to appeal to a 4 year old),  3/4 cup each of sugars, and 1 cup each of Bailey's Irish cream morsels semi bitter sweet chocolate . Cooked 13' for slightly mounded tablespoon. It didn't  say when to add color but I would add with extracts the next time. I would make again.

10 minutes was definitely not long enough for mine.  I baked for around 15 minutes until the edges were slightly brown.  When I tried taking them out at 10 minutes they were very under done.  Baking time aside, these were delicious. I used mini chocolate chips.  I will definitely make these again.
