This is a favorite and very quick to prepare.  My only comment is 2 minutes for the meringue under the broiler can be too long ... you need to watch that carefully.  The first time we made it, we just set a timer for 2 minutes and the meringue burnt ... we had to start all over.  The 2nd time we kept an eye on it and took it out at about the minute point and it was perfect.

this turned out pretty good, but we had to try the meringue part 3 times.  a whole tsp of vanilla extract is too much, and makes the meringue fall flat/stops it from becoming stiff.  a single drop is MORE than enoguh!

Pretty good, but next time WAY less salt, perhaps none. Then I feel this would be a 5 star recipe.

My family loved this, especially my husband!  I read the reviews and followed the advice of not using any salt.  That worked well forus.  I aslo use cane sugar so I had a hard time making the egg white topping as it should have come out. I added food coloring (light pink) for an Easter pastel color and the kids loved it.  My husband has already started a list of combinations to try in the future -chocoalte ice cream with mint extract, or orange extract, etc.  Thanks for a nice fun and easy recipe.

Just browning the top on broil doesn't make it baked. As written, this is just a ho-hum ice cream pie topped with meringue. Graham cracker crumbs and vanilla ice cream, topped with almond-flavored meringue just didn't do it for us. A genuine Baked Alaska is made with cake as a base, not crumbs, and it's baked in the oven, not merely broiled (meaning heat source only applied to the top.) We didn't care for the meringue with its heavy almond flavoring. A more suitable meringue for this dish uses brown sugar for appealing color and full flavor, and a dash of vanilla. Although quicker and easier to put together, we felt it was a poor substitute for real Baked Alaska, and it only served to make us long for the real deal.

Made this in individual servings  for our GOT Fire and Ice party.  Everyone loved it!  I did change the ice cream flavor, but I’m sure most flavors would be delicious.  Takes some prep time, but overall it’s a pretty simple recipe
