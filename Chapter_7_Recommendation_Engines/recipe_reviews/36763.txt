I loved this recipe. Quick, Easy, and Delicious. I did change a few things though. I added 1 egg to help keep the meat together.  I also used 1 can of diced jalapenos instead of fresh ones.  I used minced roasted garlic too.  I cooked them on the stove due to it snow outside, but they turned out great! Will make these again for sure when I can use the grill!

These were great!  I like to leave the seeds and membranes in the jalapenos for extra kick, but you can remove them for a more subtle flavor.

Ohhh these were good....I'm a fire-breathing native Texan so I love this spicy stuff.  Awesome on toasted buns with a big spoonful of guacamole.  I did add a teaspoon of Montreal steak blend just to balance the flavors a little and a good shake of Frank's hot sauce.

These were very satisfying... I was in the mood for jalapeno peppers and had ground beef defrosted. I used a couple Tbsp. of canned diced jalapeno instead of the fresh, and added a few diced sun-dried tomatoes to the mixture. GREAT BURGERS, and thanks for posting!

I thought the taste was awesome but they didn't stay together very well... I didn't add egg or anything but I think it might have helped hold the burger form better. But they do taste mighty darn good!

Delicious! I made half of this recipe, and I added about 1/4 teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder along with a dash of salt for flavor and an egg to hold it together. I did cook the burgers in a skillet, but I imagine these are amazing on the grill! I didn't have any pepper jack, so I used colby jack instead, and served on toasted 9-grain ciabatta bread. SO good!

Oh my gosh, this is the best burger recipe ever!!  I added 1-2 tbs salsa and I took the patties and made them really thin.  I placed a slice of American cheese on one of the thin patties and then placed another thin patty on top.  I pan fried them and they were so tastey, good and juicy!!  My husband said that swiss cheese would have worked well too.  Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe!!

Good. I used 1/2 tsp. ground cumin with garlic salt and mild chili powder to taste. Topped 'em with Chihuahua cheese. Only condiments used were ketchup and avocado slices. Will make again but will use an extra jalapeno for my husband.

Thumbs up for a great burger. I used sliced jalapeno from a jar, and only 1 Tbs. of dried minced onion plus a little low sodium seasoning salt. Although I didn't use fresh onion, it seems that the patties would have trouble holding together with that much onion. 1 small onion is a lot of onion for only 1 lb of beef. These were not quite as moist as the jalapeno/cheddar burger with the cheese mixed in but still good enough for a thumbs up. Thanks Steve.

These are so freakin good. The best burgers I've ever had. Even my husband who is usually wimpy about anything with jalapenos loved it. I did add hot pepper sauce, black pepper, and worcestorshire (sp??) sauce. I also used lots of jarred jalapenos slices. In the end it had a little bite to it but not extremely spicy. My dad thought they were so great that he hid the last one on us so he could have it later in the day.

These were great! I used cheddar as I didn't have pepper jack which I bet would be fantastic. I nixed the buns and ate with a fork. Very satistfying. Thanks Steve!

Great burgers! I added an egg and some salt to make sure the burgers wouldn't fall apart. Next time I'll definitly add some jalapeno seeds to give it an extra kick. But very very good!

Great burgers, I didn't have the pepper-jack cheese, so used cheddar instead, I grated the cheese and mixed it in the burger also, a dash of Worcestershire sauce also. Held together perfectly on the grill.  Great way to use up the garden jalapeños and onions. Thanks Steve. Update, we made these again on our camping trip with ground turkey, which almost tasted better than the beef.

This was good for the stuffing part of it, the jalapeno, garlic and onions, but the meat needed flavor too.  I did add my own grilling seasoning to give it something, which helped, but next time I will know to add this.  It was good, just didn't wow me with anything special.

Nice blend of burger mix-ins, not a very strong flavor though. I didn't have pepperjack, so I added another jalapeno and "stuffed" the patties with cream cheese. I also used a little worcestire, though I don't know it really did anything.  Either way, a good quick and simple recipe to use as a kick-start for many ideas. You could top with cheddar instead, or season with cumin/red pepper, etc. I topped mine with some Defcon hot sauce.

Delicious!  Tasty with a bit of a kick.  If you don't like onions or spicy stuff go for a different burger, but if you do these are just right.  You can adjust the amount of peppers, just don't overdo the onions or the burgers won't stay together well.  Great on whole wheat buns.

Well, I'd say these burgers definitely have possibilities!  Since it hasn't been grilling weather here in Ohio I had to do these stove top.  I think grilling these would have really enhanced their flavor.  I did add Montreal Steak Seasoning to the outside of our burgers as I always do.  If not these definitely will need some salt and pepper.  I'm going to try these again when things warm up around here!

These were pretty good. They were simple to make but I thought they would have a little more flavor. I love the idea though. Next time I will add some more seasonings to it. Maybe a little hot sauce too.

I added a diced Halbenero pepper! Didn't use egg because I'm allergic and was just careful when flipping so they wouldn't fall apart! Also, I used swiss instead of pepperjack cheese. I served the burgers on toast. They were amazing and weren't too spicy even with the Halbenero. Everyone (5 people) rated 4.5/5 that I made them for!

This is one good Burger!!  I chopped the pepper, garlic, and onion very fine in the food processor, and mixed with the hamburger in the morning, then pattied them out and grilled that evening.  Were good, but much more flavorful the next day as leftovers.  Will be making again soon!!

As is the recipe lacked flavor, which is why I only gave it a 3.  To pump up the flavor I doubled the amount of onion, then sauteed the onion and garlic till caramel colored, added 1 TBSP of freshly ground black pepper and 1 tsp salt. I used diced pickled jalapenos instead of fresh.  I skipped the cheese and I missed it.  Next time I think I will try extra sharp cheddar.

This was okay. I read reviews that it could be bland, so I followed another review to add a teaspoon of Montreal Steak Seasoning. That was to the halved recipe so I thought it'd be extra flavorful. I also left the seeds in the jalapeno for spice, and made guacamole to top it. It was unfortunately still bland. I'll stick with the Tex-Mex Cajun Burger from this site. It has the same base as this burger, but the Cajun seasoning makes it outrageous. Thanks for the recipe - it's a good basic burger.

Not sure if I should be rating or not since I deviated from the original recipe.  I didn't have fresh jalapeno so I used canned.  I should have added more though, not spicy enough with the canned. Also only used one clove of garlic, and added about half a tsp of mccormick hamburger grill seasoning, salt and peppered the outside, and served on grilled texas toast with some grilled onions.  I think with the fresh jalapenos and a little extra salt, these would have been perfect. I did add an egg to make sure it didn't fall apart on the grill as well as a small toss of bread crumbs to soak up some of the egg.

My husband and I really liked these. I didn't use onion as my husband doesn't like it. We had these on big bulky rolls with blure cheese dressing which helped to kepp the heat in check.

Sorry, have to give these a three, not the best burger I've ever had, and it wasn't even as spicy as I would have thought.

Very good flavor, but definitely not spicy! I even left all the seeds from the jalepeno in. A good change from plain burgers, though. I cooked in the broiler in my oven, and did not have a problem at all with them falling apart. Next time will spice up more.

Great way to spice up hamburgers!  This recipe takes so little time to make, but the peppers make ALL the difference.  I halved the recipe--but still used an entire jalepeno.  I can't imagine how people could find this bland.  If you use an fresh pepper-with seeds-you will be plesantly surprised.  Also, I found it was great with mustard.

Hurts so good! Makes it hard to eat a plain ol' burger again. Add a little jalapeno mustard to your bun and you're ready to go . . . if you think you can handle the burn. For all of you spicy food lovers, this is a must taste.

For as many zesty ingredients as this had I really expected it to have more flavor.  If I were to make this again I would have to double or triple the peppers.  Just didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  Thanks, though!

We like our burgers plain and use a burger press to keep everything together.  My 11 yr old daughter loves these burgers, I did remove the seeds to give it more a subtle flavour and less spice kick.  Defiantly going to make again but I’ll do one batch with jalapeño and another batch with some home grown  habaneros. Although I said these were good I’m giving 4 stars because when looking for a recipe to flavour up a beef patty I’m looking for something to really add to the “extra wow” to the patties. The added flavour from the onion, garlic, and jalapeño did not give what I was looking for at the time. But as I said we primarily like our meat plain and pressed through a burger press so these will be part of our burger rotation.  I see people using egg etc to hold their burgers together etc.  Use a press; it will firmly hold the meat together and medium ground will let you cook to well while maintaining the juiciness. Don’t push the fat out while cooking you will end up with a hockey puck. Being in Canada ground beef is not always fresh ground and so we have to cook well done (can’t even get medium rare from a restaurant where I am). For those who have the ability to do fresh ground lucky you for being able to do medium rare.

Good recipe! I did make some changes based on other reviews I read.  I used a package of beefy onion soup mix and Worcestershire to add some flavor and keep juicy, in addition to the onion, garlic,  and jalapenos, and an egg to hold it together.  Served it on whole wheat buns with grilled red onions,  and veggie tots.  DELISH, and makes for a wonderful Saturday night dinner!

These were sooo good! Like many other reviewers, I too added an egg to keep them from falling apart. Served them without the bun  - just with home-made guacamole on top. My husband isn't a big fan of spicy food but loved these. Will definitely make them again! Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

These were great! I used jarred jalapenos instead of fresh, added 1 egg, 1 slice of bread, crust removed, blended into crumbs, 1/2 tsp of worcestershire sauce and I only used 1/2 a small onion. While grilling, I basted with BBQ sauce of choice.

I have to fess up to eating these two nights in a row.  I did not have pepper jack the first night and just used cheddar and they were great!  The second night I used pepper jack and wow!  I added a tad of worcestershire sauce and some red hot to the meat and did as another person suggested and made thin burgers and placed cheesed on top of one and sandwiched another burger on top.  I don't think I will ever make a cheeseburger (of any kind) without doing this step!  They cooked perfectly though you do need to be careful flipping them! Yum!

I used organic grass fed ground beef, organic sweet red/yellow peppers and organic American cheese! Came out great. Still want to try it with jalapeño but used what I had on hand. Juicy and big thick burger! Yum

These were alright but did not have the kick I was expecting. The only modification I made was because I had no hot pepper cheese so I used Colby Jack. But if the cheese is what gives these burgers their kick I'm unimpressed. If I make these again I will modify the meat mixture to enhance the flavor.

These were pretty good. Quick and easy with lots of kick, but needs something more to give it more flavor. I added some chili powder and cumin to give it some more interesting flavors, but it still needs something else that I just can't put my finger on. Also highly recommend adding an egg to keep the burgers together. Might make again.

These were excellent!  They even impressed my husband.  I will definitely make these again.  The only thing I did differently was add a little bit of Accent salt and add a bit more jalapeno pepper.
