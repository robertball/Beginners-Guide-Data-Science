Hey can we get some extra stars for this recipe? It was just fabulous. I made a few minor alternations: Left out the red bell pepper since it bothers my stomach, used ground turkey breast, used pinquito beans since that was what was in the cupboard, used frozen corn since I had an open box and went heavier on the chili, cumin and garlic. Oh yes. I also added some fresh chopped spinach.  I tasted this last night after cooking and it was very good. Today I had this for lunch and I couldn’t stop saying “ Mmmmmm” the whole time. If you can make this the day before you plan to serve it, I really recommend it. I served this with a savory corn muffin.

This would be a great recipe for thanksgiving leftovers.. Used diced turkey meat and leftover pumpkin. Any additional veggies would be good in this as well. I’ll make this again soon, that’s for sure!

I made a vegetarian version, used 2 cans of black beans and one can of pinto beans.  I increased the spices/seasonings, added extra corn and some chopped green bell pepper also.  I blended my tomatoes up before adding as I don't like tomato chunks in my soups/chili's :-)  This is really good and so good for you!!

I don't know how I first came across this recipe but when I did, I was very intrigued!  Thank goodness for the positive reviews because I never would have given it a second thought otherwise!  I had a can of pumpkin left over from the holdiays that I wanted to use up.  I regularly have all of the other indgredients on hand, so I decided to try it.  I browned the turkey, onions and garlic on the stove and then threw the mixture in the crockpot, along with everything else.  Cooked all day on low.  This chili is great!  I was wary to eat it because I was afraid it would taste like pumpkin.  It does not taste like pumpkin!  It's a great, tasty, thick chili.  (Easy to make, too).  I didn't tell my husband about the "secret indgredient" until after dinner was over.  He was totally amazed!  He loved it too.  I served it with sour cream, corn muffins and a green salad.  Even my almost-3-year old ate this and loved it!  What a great recipe.  Will make again!

I’ve never been a fan of chili, so when I make it it’s to please others who are.  But I sure did love this!  The fact that I might taste the pumpkin didn’t concern me - I wouldn’t have cared if I could.  But the fact is, you don’t taste it – what you taste is incredibly darn good chili, that isn’t overly seasoned with chili powder.  I don’t ever use ground turkey (icky) so I used ground beef instead.  I used my own tomato sauce put up from my garden. As for the green chilies, I substituted chopped, fresh roasted poblano peppers.  I also added a good pinch of dried Mexican oregano.  I could tell Hubs wasn’t quite as fond of this as I was but I should have never told him there was pumpkin in it, which I think made him think there had to be something weird about this.  As for me, I thought it was perfect.  It didn’t really need it, but I served this with a dab of sour cream and chopped green onion which made it look all pretty.

Pumpkin in chili?!  I had to try this.  It was really tasty! Turkey is the perfect meat to use because of its mild flavor and the corn gave it all such a fresh taste.  A keeper in my book.

I made this early in the morning, followed recipe except doubled spices.  I wasn't thrilled with the results (the consistency was great,  the taste...not so much).  I even asked members what to do to give it more "chili" taste.  I ended up not doing anything more to it.  NOW IT'S ABOUT 6 HOURS LATER and I just came home.  Couldn't resist another taste test.....WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  This is very good and I would definitely make it again.s

We loved this chili -- very hearty! I also loved the extra healthiness the pumpkin provided, and I think that made the food taste even better in my mind (an added benefit to all already great tasting chili). As other reviewers said, you don't even taste the pumpkin, but I think it adds a nice texture and thickness to the chili. **Added note: I made this again and made it a little healthier the second time around by using olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and using "no salt added" canned products where I could (tomatoes, corn).

I've been making this for over a year now. Have never used ground turkey, only leftover baked turkey. Made it once with chicken & it was still great. You'll have a pile of empty cans & wonder what the heck you are doing, but believe me..IT'S SO WORTH IT!!! Trust the pumpkin!!! I freeze half to enjoy later!!! LOVE IT!!!

I was very concerned with the pumpkin ingredient but the chili came out surprisingly good and my family loved it. I did end up modifying based on what I had at home. I didn't use the ingredients I didn't have on hand (vegetable oil, bell pepper, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, green chiles, corn, cumin). I ended up with more turkey because I added one entire package of Jennie-O turkey (1.25 lbs). I heated olive oil and then added garlic and onions. After adding the turkey, I seasoned with 1 tsp salt and crushed red pepper; 1 TB dried oregano, basil, and chili powder. I didn't need to drain once the turkey was browned. I then added 2 cans stewed italian tomatoes, pumpkin, 2 cans of beans (undrained), 1/2-3/4 cup salsa, 1/2 cup beer. Instead of 30 minutes, I actually cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours. I would have cooked it longer if I had the time.

I really enjoyed this dish. My family are hard sells and even they liked it. You would never guess that it had pumpkin in it. Definitely will make again.

If I hadn't read the reviews, I probably wouldn't have tried this recipe. I mean, pumpkin in chili??? But it tastes great! You really can't tell there is pumpkin in it. I do recommend that you wait until the next day to eat it. All chili tastes better after the ingredients get to "know each other". A smart way to add extra vitamins and your kids will never know. Great served over brown rice and topped with a little sour cream and hot sauce.

I love this!  It’s so good but inexpensive and guilt free!  I followed the recipe exactly, taste tested, and then added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg just to hint at the secret ingredient (pumpkin).  It wasn’t needed, but I love cinnamon and nutmeg so any excuse I have to use it I will and I liked the light spicy flavor it gave the chili.  You can’t taste the pumpkin at all, it just lends to the texture making a nice creamy decadent sauce without adding those pesky fats and calories.  I fed 4 people with it, and still had most of the pot leftover so I froze the rest for another dinner another day.  This stuff is so good I couldn’t stop eating it, and you know what?  I don’t even mind!

Do you know how healthy this is? It has 5 of the top 16 foods in it!!! Beans, turkey, pumpkin, onions, & tomatoes! I used the full 1 1/4 lb of ground turkey breast. You might want to add water, as mine was really thick. (my canned tomatoes' juice was pretty thick- I added 1 cup of water to the chili) I also would suggest using 2 cans of kidney beans! It is mild, so if you want it hot, go ahead & add more kick. So easy & fun to make, too.

Loved how easy this is to make, and it's good, but I had to add a lot of extra chili pepper and cayenne to spice it up a little.

I think this is my new favorite chili recipe.  Great chili flavor and you would never know it contains pumpkin.  My only changes were to add an additional can of beans and I used an entire can of corn.  I can't wait to share this one at a potluck!

This is great! I did not add the green pepper because we do not care for them too much. I, also, did not add the salt. The canned veggies have more than enough already. After cooking the turkey, onions and garlic, I threw everything in the crock pot and let it cook on low for a few hours. It was an easy dinner to have while watching the Cardinals in the National League playoffs.

This was okay, somewhat bland for my tastes. It did seem to get a little better the next day. If I were to make it again I would really bump up the spices and use ground turkey that contained some dark meat.  I find that all white meat ground turkey can be bland.

Very nice!  Sub'd out turkey for some roasted chicken.  Decreased oil to 1T and added 1/2T butter (for carmelization).  Started chili at 3p, followed recipe then let cool for 1.5 hrs and reheated.  Marrys the flavors well without having to wait overnight.  Will make again!!

Don't let the pumpkin scare you off! This recipe was GREAT and SUPER easy!! After cooking the ground turkey with veggies I put all of the ingredients into a slow cooker. I left it alone for about 2 hours stirring it occasionally. When it was nice and hot I served with a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar. Verryyy yummy! Salt, pepper, and sugar to taste =)

It's still simmering and I already love it! My package of extra-lean ground turkey was just over a pound, but I used it all.  I used light kidney beans and added a can of drained black beans, as well as a whole can of corn.  Like another reviewer, I added some extra liquid, but I used low-sodium chicken stock.  I also left out the salt.  It smells wonderful and looks so pretty!  Can't wait for supper!

This is a very quick and easy recipe. I did use canned pinto beans instead of the kidney. For my familys taste I doubled the chili powder and cumin, then added some red pepper flakes. I guess we just needed a bit more spice. Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper for us.

Wow, what an odd ingredient for chili, but this is good.  I was looking for something to use up my pumpkin left over from the pumpkin roll up (excellent also!)  This is a great healthy meal and fits into the South Beach Diet that I am doing.  I used black beans instead of kidney...that is the only change.

Great chili recipe! I doubled the chili powder and cumin as we like our chili spicy. I also added one small diced hot pepper to the chili. This is a very healthy recipe.

Fabulous! I made this for a friend and saved some for myself. It was great, and I never would have guessed there was pumpkin.

This was excellent!  No one had a clue that it contained pumpkin, although I do think the pumpkin gave it a slightly creamier texture than normal chili.  I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I substituted a 15 oz. can of chicken broth.  It was still very thick and the flavor was great.  This is a keeper.

So good. A big hit with my family. I didn't add peppers, but it didn't seem to matter. My husband was shocked when i told him there was pumpkin in it! You'd never know. Turkey is soooo good!

I thought this was pretty good, but it wasn't an "Oh I must make this again immediately!" recipe. The pumpkin was somewhat odd, but still good. I found it was all better the second day.

1.11.20 ... Score on this one thanks to DIZ!  I had cooked ground beef in the freezer so subbed that for the turkey; only black beans, ya know.  One of the cans of tomatoes had jalapenos & habaneros.  It toasted up the chili perfectly.  The pumpkin thickened it nicely.  Thanks! Next day:  I.  am.  in.  shock.  E, 22, likes this.  He isn't a spicy guy.  That one spicy can of toms really upped the heat much.  Okay, okay, ninety -literally - percent of the cornbread is gone - so maybe that helped.  Winky.  Next next day:  I'm in deeper shock.  He asked if I'll be making more soon - with cornbread.  Someone check me.  ;)

This is a pretty good pumpkin chili. It's not nearly seasoned enough though. I added a LOT more chili powder, cumin, Mexican oregano, and a couple other things to mine, but each to his own. Thanks for the recipe!

excellent..I didn't tell my husband about the pumpkin but asked him what he thought and he said "sweet".  I used hamburg instead of the turkey, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. This might replace my chili recipe that I have used for years, it was that good.  Thick, sweet yet a bit of spice and just really good!  A Keeper!

This was fantastic. As others have said, you can't taste the pumpkin but it has a thick texture- very hearty and yummy! My husband, who freaked a little when he saw the pumpkin, loved it! I do think I will add a can of chicken broth to it next time- just to stretch it a bit. Will definitely make again! Thanks!

Great recipe! I made the chili this weekend for the Men's Chili Cook-off at my church. I won first prize! It has some kick to it, and everyone loved the texture. Excellent chili.

Very flavorful chili.  I love the thickness and flavor the pumpkin gives to it.  I do put a TBS of sugar in mine to cut the acidity (at least that's what my mom always did with chili!).

Great recipe!  I loved the "secret" ingredient.  We have young kids and they like their food mild, so it was just fine for us.

Great!  Super thick and good flavor.  My boyfriend couldn't taste the pumpkin at all.  I used leftover cooked turkey and let it go in the crockpot all day, and it was still a nice thick consistency.
