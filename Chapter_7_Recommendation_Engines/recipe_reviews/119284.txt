I have to say I was a bit hesitant to try this recipe because I am accustomed to making my fried rice on the stove top. Two things went through my mind before I started and during my making of this recipe  - I thought the veggies would be overdone and if it would be too salty (cause bouillon here seems to have lots of salt and adding soy sauce on top of that?!) Boy was I wrong, this was delicious! My worries were all for nothing. Admittedly this takes longer than just frying up leftover rice on the stove but it is great nonetheless. I also thought it was "pale looking" but after giving it a mix with the eggs it turns out lots of the soy sauce settled to the bottom of the dish. My rice got a nice colour at the end. In a pinch when all you have a microwave to "cook" ;) with...this recipe would be top of my list. I left out the ham and added in a chopped sweet pepper. Thanks for sharing!

We found this to be too salty for us and also the rice did not cook. I don't know what happened, because all of the reviews say how good it is.  Maybe it was the ham I used or something? Sorry, it just didn't do it for us.

Simple to make. I couldn't wait to taste it. It was pretty good. I thought it needed a touch of salt, I used low sodium soy and bouillon in this, maybe that's why. It tasted a little bitter or sour to me. I added just pinch of sugar, shake of salt and pepper to my portion and it did make it better.  I would make this again as a quick and easy fried rice. Thanks for the recipe!

Although I prefer the "true" fried rice, this recipe saved me because the main chicken dish I had to go with it was a disaster. This rice tasted very good and flavorful. We all liked it and it was easy to make.

This was so easy and so good. I admit, I was a bit skeptical about the whole meal being from the micro...but I thought it was wonderful! I did skip the ham and used some leftover chicken I had from another dish. I ate it for lunch two days in a row and will definitely make it again. For me, I actually like it better than the other more traditional fried rice recipes I have tried from here. Thanks for sharing!

I just made this for my mom and I. I followed the directions to the T until the rice wasn't cooking. So I had to add an extra 1 1/2c water. Then finished it off how the directions said. We sat down and agreed, it had a little too much soy sauce in it. I'd maybe make it again but use less soy sauce and more water.

THIS IS DELICIOUS!! It's also easy for an after school snack because I can just pop it in the microwave and start my homework. While I was making dinner, it was easy to focus and make the main dish (I ate this as a side). Basically, TRY IT!!

This was pretty good, even though I used chicken broth instead of water (I had no boulion) and forgot the soy sauce (duh). The main thing is: use white long grain rice, not brown long grain rice, and the cooking instructions are spot on--which I appreciate b/c I can never make rice right. I hate when a recipe says "serves 6" but not what the serving size is. I meant to measure, but I think it's at least 1 cup per serving. It was a ton, whatever it was! This is a good basic rice recipe that you can do other things to. It's a keeper.

I had some leftover instant rice and leftover mixed veggie that I used to make this recipe. I cooked my egg per the recipe and just warmed everthing up in the microwave. Yummy lunch!
