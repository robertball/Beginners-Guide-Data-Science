I LOVED this recipe the first time I tried it, but I've made it even easier... I don't see the need to dip each individual ball. I mixed all ingredients for the "goo" including the butter and corn syrup, then I formed all the balls and gently folded them into the goo, just until coated, dumped into the pan, DONE! It's just as good! Try it!

My family goes GAH-GAH over these sticky buns. When my children know I'm baking these, they run to get their friends. My husband doesn't want to share! I have to double the recipe and bake in a bundt pan. It really looks impressive too when turned out on a plate. It looks like you spent hours on it, but it is sooooo easy.(DON'T try tripling it though. It won't get baked through without the outside getting way too dark.)I also increase the cinnamon by 1/2 tsp, the margarine by 1 Tbsp, the brown sugar by 2 Tbsp, and the pecans by 1/4 cup. Otherwise, the topping is too scant for our taste. If you use the extra large biscuits, you'll need to cut them into thirds, and I wouldn't recommend using the large biscuits for both cans (when doubling). It's just too much dough. For my oven, I have to reduce the heat to 415-425 so the outside doesn't over bake before the inside is done. This is a favorite we'll be baking for many years to come!

I lowered my oven temp. to 425 and baked about 12 minutes.

The buns were both soft on the outside and inside.

Delicious!

Quick, easy, and very awesome recipe! I cooked mine at 425 for the same time, and they came out really soft. I discovered though that they come out so much BETTER if you cook then in a smaller glass baking dish. Stuff 'em in there and they'll come out perfect. In a metal cake pan, they were a bit on the crispy side. I made a simple powdered sugar and milk icing for them. Super yummy!

I used two cans of biscuits in a round pan.  These were fast and delicious.  I drizzled with maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Mine turned out pretty good.  The outer biscuts did get a little too brown making them really hard but the center was nice and gooey.  We used to eat monkey bread when I was younger and this was a quick version.  Thanks for sharing.

These were really good.  I had to use 2 packages of biscuits cuz the ones I had were only 7 ounces.  Nice and gooey and yummy.  Will make these again.  Sans pecans, cuz I am not a nut person.

This was so quick and easy and tasted just like I remembered as a kid.   Hubby liked them so much he ate the whole pan before the kids got up and I had to make another batch!!   I will definitely be making this one a lot as it fits are hectic weekend schedule.

This was a great quick way to make a cinnamon bun last minute.  My family really enjoyed them.  I used light Karo because that's all I had and they turned out great!

I love this recipe and so does the whole family. Even though the recipe is super simple I sometimes mix the dry ingredients the night before and store in zip top bags. In the morning I dip the biscuits in margarine and simply shake in the bag. So good you can't stop eating them :)

I didn't have any pecans or corn syrup, so I made this without them and I used a Tbsp of pancake syrup instead of the corn syrup and they were DELICIOUS!  My family thought that they were better than the cinnamon rolls that we usually have (Pillsbury) when we are having breakfast for dinner.  Can't wait to see how they taste with pecans the next time we have them.

Threw half the dough balls in the marg then the sugar to a cake pan, then the other half and in the cake pan as well. Drizzled with a little low cal maple syrup (its all I have) baked at 400 for 12 min.

We loved this recipe.  Yummy, quick and easy fix for an early morning sweet tooth.  I will definitely make this again.  (I used a 7.5 ounce can of biscuits, and it still worked out great.)

I really liked this recipe! Super easy to make. Tasted great. :)

I ended up doubling the "sauce". I sprayed the smallest frying pan I had with cooking spray. I poured half the sauce into the pan, spreading it evenly. I rolled the biscuits into balls (didn't cut them in half I had the big 8 can of biscuits) and rolled them into the remaining sauce. I arranged them into my frying pan and put them in the oven for 17 minutes. 

**I started my oven at 445 for 12 mins but some of the biscuits didn't cook all the way so I change the temp to 450 and keep them in the oven for 5 mins. 

I placed a plate over the pan and flipped! End result was amazing. Thank-you for the recipe.

My Husband loves sticky buns and raves how great his Mom's are so I thought I would try this recipe and it was a hit with him! We loved how easy and quick they were to make. I didn't use 2 tablespoons of corn syrup though instead I used 2 tablespoons molassess.

These sticky buns could not have been easier or tastier.  I used Grands and divided each in half and rolled into a ball. Used butter because I never use margarine for anything. Used honey in place of corn syrup.  Remember to turn the pan of buns onto a plate as soon as you take it out of the oven. Wait until they cool a bit before you eat or else your teeth will stick together.  Great warmed up again the next  day.

These were quick and yummy, but...we all sat down to eat them while they were warm and then as they started to cool,  hardened caramel literally started forming between our teeth as we chewed!  Not sure why this happened, I've made sticky buns and monkey breads plenty of times before and never had this problem.  Will stick with other recipes.

These were pretty good. I didn't have the right kind of syrup so I used pancake syrup instead, which worked out just fine. Also, if you use the 'Grand' biscuits, like I did, then increase your cooking time by 5 minutes, otherwise the biscuits will still be too doughy.

Absolutely great for someone who doesn't have a lot of time. They were delicious and will make them again with cinnabon biscuits!

Oh yum.  Made these because I didn't know what to do with the big biscuits I had in the fridge, tried this anyway.  It was fantastic!  I think the big biscuits worked great because they were so flakey and tend to be tender anyway.  I also used a butter flavored biscuit.  I tried it with the coconut instead of the nuts, and it was very good.  We liked them better than monkey bread because it's so darn gooey!!

Great Recipe. The only thing that i did difernt was to use the big biscuts instead of the regular sized ones. 

Yum!

Husband said possibly the best thing he’s  ever put in his mouth! 
I used the Pillsbury frozen buttermilk biscuits. allowed them to thaw  overnight in the fridges, in a casserole dish, sprayed with Pam and covered with plastic wrap.  Next morning cut it half, rolled into ball and then into the melted butter and DARK brown sugar and cinnamon .  Rr-sprayed casserole dish with Pam and back in they went. Baked for approx. 13 min. 
When  they were done, drizzled them with caramel sauce. YUM YUM ??

everything turned out really good, we don't think we need to add anything to it. We believe that it would've been better if there were no pecans.

The quick sticky buns were very outstanding. It was very sticky indeed, but we changed the dark corn syrup to maple syrup and the margarine to butter. Overall, the buns were great and I think that we'd want to make these again.

I followed a reviewer’s advice and mixed all the sauce ingredients together first and then dropped the dough balls in, tossing to coat. Then dumped it into pan and baked 12 minutes. It was quick, easy and hit the spot for a warm sweet snack. To me, it’s like monkey bread but a lot faster to make and eat.

We were not as pleased with this recipe as we had hoped.  We forgot to grease the pan which made clean up a bear.  We tried it for the quick and easy aspect but didn’t like the biscuit as the bread part.  Flavor was good.  We followed one review that said to fold the biscuits in the goo and that did not work well.

These were a hit with mom-in-law...can't ask for much better than that!  I drizzled the leftover melted butter on top with the corn syrup too.
