I like to make 3 Bean Salad often in the Summer, picnic, months. I made this salad one day when I didn't have the wax beans and kidney beans. It really is very simple. While very tasty I think I still like the 3 bean look of the salad being more complex and fancy. Anyway, instead of using Italian dressing, which is fine in a pinch I'm sure,it's a little too tangy and I like it a little sweeter. I used a 3 bean dressing,
3/4 cup white sugar 
2/3 cup distilled white vinegar 
1/3 cup vegetable oil 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 
1/2 teaspoon celery seed 
Still very easy and fast. Of course, better affter a long marinate.

I used this for a camping meal for 100 people.  Drain the canned beans really well, I put the cans of beans open end down in the sink while slicing the onions.  We also let it marinate overnight, sweet... too easy.  Thanks Dale for such a great recipe.

I must admit, I was totally skeptical of such a simple recipe that didn't seem to make any sense. I made it for our recent office St Pat's party and it was a hit! This is a great summer salad that is light and refreshing. I only used around 10oz of dressing though and my beans were swimming! Great recipe. Try it out!

Rinse cans of green beans, always.  It really makes a better difference in the taste!  Takes the can taste out.

So simple, quick and GOOD!!  My oh-so-picky boyfriend had 3 helpings!  I did only use half a bottle of dressing, it seemed like plenty.  Will definitely make again and again and again!!!

You'll like it even better if you add: - 1 tablespoon of sugar to the Italian dressing, and - 1 can of sliced water chestnuts. The additions turn it into a 5-star recipe, in my opinion. I also make it with a can each of green and wax beans for a little more interest. Yummy!

It was a bit hit at the family reunion.  I used a can of regular green bean and a can of wax beans for a bit more color.  I also substituted  Newman's Own Low Fat Sesame Ginger Dressing.

Easy to throw together very quickly, that is for sure.  Hubby prefers a mix of different beans instead of all green beans.  I do agree with another reviewer, rinse the canned beans before adding to the salad.

Changed the servings to 24 for a party--then accidentally got French cut green beans--6 cans of beans only required 1 bottle(16oz) of Italian dressing--Holy cow! Any more would have been pucker-mouth city! And, no chance on three full onions--I only added 1/4 of one!! Cannot imagine eating this at its full ingredients amounts!!

This was very good and everyone really liked it.  Although, I did NOT use canned green beans.  To make it more healthy I used frozen beans and steamed them in a small amount of water, then placed them in a serving bowl and added the rest.  I also make my own Italian salad dressing:  1/2 c. olive oil, 1/4 cup balsamic/apple vinegar mixed; then I add to taste garlic powder, salt, pepper, oregano, and basil.  I took this to a friend's house for lunch and everyone (even my children) commented on how good it was.

I thought this tasted good. I was surpised because of how simple it is. I would consider making it again, if I need a quick side dish for a bbq. I used Tuscan style Italian bottled dressing. I also used half the amount of dressing and red onion. The grean beans would have been submerged otherwise. We also did just eat some of it right away. I didn't want it getting too tart or the beans to get too soft by sitting.

So good and SO EASY!  I used french style green beans and zesty italian dressing since I like a lot of "zing".  Even better after sitting in the fridge overnight!

Super easy and super tasty!  It was a hit at a dinner party.  Although it didn't go over well with people who think green beans can only be eaten when served hot.

This was tasty and oh so easy. I added some yellow and orange bell pepper as well as some sliced cucumber along with the onions and green beans. I didn't add the entire bottle of dressing I just added enough to kinda cover and shook them around every couple of hours. I let it sit for about 10 hours. Family enjoyed it and its soooo easy I will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe!!

You have to like canned green beans to like this recipe.  The texture was unappealing--I guess I thought the dressing would perk it up/disguise it. But I was wrong. NO ONE at my gathering liked this!

This was alright.  My daughter loved it.  I let it marinade for 5 hours, and it tasted rather bland to me.  I used Kraft Zesty Italian dressing.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was good, but not the best vegetable side dish ever.  1 bottle of dressing is WAY too much.

One of those recipes that I really wanted to like more.  I love 3-bean salad - but with only green beans it didn't make it for me.  Sorry :(

Very good - I did use a bit less onion (perhaps the onion I bought was quite large).

I got fantastic results with this recipe!   I am always looking for a way to use all those canned green beans I stock up on when they're on sale.  This one is a keeper!

I used a lot less dressing than the recipe calls for.  It was still a little too tangy for my taste but maybe it was the kind of dressing I bought.

This recipe is great!  It is very easy and the result is wonderful!  I made it for a 4th of July picnic.
