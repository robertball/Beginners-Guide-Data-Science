I used 3 pheasant breasts in this recipe and should have only used 2. I used california blend frozen vegetables which included brocoli califlower and carrots. The recipe was very good - awesome flavor!! I would recommend this to anyone who wanted a new way to cook wild game. Quail would be a good subsitute too. My husband said this was the best pheasant he had ever tasted!!! I will definately make this recipe again.

I used chicken only because that's what I had on hand. I will be making this again but with the real thing. Thanks!

So so. I think it's kind of a waste to use nice pheasant meat with such bland unoriginal packaged food. A good weekday meal but a little salty. Use with chicken save your pheasant for something better.

This was very good. I kept thinking that I would surely take a bite of bird that would taste gamey but every single bite was delicious. The kid even loved it.

Really not impressed with this recipe. I have made it on two occasions to try and use up some of our pheasant. Really not very good. I am still searching for good phesant recipes that are not time consuming. I would not even make this with chicken since there are so many better chicken recipes out there. It really tastes like a boxed dinner.

I ran accross this recipe searching for something quick to make on the nights I work. I used chicken and followed the rest of the recipe. Very easy very quick and simple ingredients. Great for busy moms and the kids even like it. I gave it 4 stars because everyone in the house liked it and I'll definitely make it again (but it's more of a family friendly type recipe than a knock your socks off type recipe).

I made this with chicken just because that's what I had. This was so good. I used califlower broccoli mushrooms corn and carrots and I couldn't have asked for more from a cassorole. Thanks so much for a great simple delicious recipe. I will definetly make again.

This was very tasty. I did not have the canned chicken gravy so I used a powdered gravy mix with the required amount of water and added a can of cream of mushroom soup.

Thanks for sharing this easy recipe for pheasant! I have made it twice and will make it again as I always seem to have a freezer full of pheasants. Like another reviewer I was concerned about sodium but I was able to find both lower a sodium stuffing mix and gravy. The one change I did make in the recipe was to add more gravy--in fact I almost doubled the quantity.

We all liked this. I used frozen broccoli because its what I had on hand. TIP... soak your pheasant in milk over night to get rid of the "gamey" taste
