I made half the recipe using gluten free flour and the other half with all purpose flour (all King Arthur flour, of course!).  The gluten free bunch is still out on their review, but we who ate the regular recipe thought these are delicious!  I cut the walnuts smaller for the streusel topping than I did for the filling.   I got a total of 18 muffins--which leaves us some for freezing for future eating!  Thanks for the recipe, Mel!  I will make this again!

I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup in the batter, and that's all you need. These we're fantastic!

Nice and moist, good flavor. I did not have enough banana so I added applesauce to make up the difference. My husband even likes these!

Really delicious but a little too sweet. I made it with truvia brown sugar blend on top and pecans, so that could be the reason. I would definitely make them again after cutting back on the sugar.

These turned out beautifully!  Moist with just the right amount of spice. The crunchy topping really set it above a plain banana muffin.

I would use less flour with the crumble topping. If it doesn't get mixed well with the butter/sugar combo, it cooks as adusty top that gets inhaled when eating.
