I grill pizza on the grill all the time! It's amazing how much the pizza ends up tasting like it came out of a brick oven pizzaria!! I highly recommend everyone try to cook their pizza on the grill, I am sure it won't be the last time you do it!

Delicious! This was so easy to put together and yet tasted so good. I used regular sausage and "Pasta/Pizza' sauce from this site. I added some onions, olives and sundried tomatoes on top and this was wonderful! Perfect with a nice glass of wine! Update: I made this again using Al Fresco chicken sausage and it was wonderful - who knew chicken sausage could taste so good!

My husband raved about this pizza (and doesn't believe in chicken on ANY pizza!!).  However, i did have to substitute.  Betty Crocker Pizza crust- baked w/o toppings for 6 minutes, then pizza sauce (out of a can), onions, lite mozzerella, feta, 15 kalamata olives sliced, and spinach/garlic chicken sausage. Then I sprinkled garlic and oregano over all of it.  If I would have had a tomato, I would have put that on, too.  Super Yummy!!

This was really good!  Had on hand garlic chicken sausage so used that and otherwise followed exactly. Will make again and add the seeded olives and sundried tomatoes, perhaps some artichokes. YUM!

This was really good and easy.  I did not grill this.  I used asiago/spinach chicken sausage and added sundried tomatoes and kalmata olives.  I baked at 450 for about 10 minutes.  Will make again.

Amazing pizza!  I used local made chicken sausage with spinach and asiago cheese.  I had to use the oven since it was raining, (450 degrees for 8 minutes).  I don't have garlic olive oil, just brushed olive oil on the whole top and then sprinkled garlic powder over it.  The whole pizza probably only had a total of one cup of cheese since I was lower on it than I thought, but nobody even noticed it was so good.  We will be having this pizza again!

I tried this for the first time tonight. Like one other reviewer, I added some olives (yum) and mushrooms to this and it was absolutely delicious! A little pricey but so completely worth is. Thanks for the recipe - we will absolutely make this again!

My hubby made this last night. So delicious! We followed another reviewer's advice and added Sundried Tomatoes and Kalamata Olives. Didn't have garlic oil so just brushed crust with olive oil and sprinkled fresh minced garlic on top. Our only complaint was we wish there was more! Definitely a keeper.

Yum! We really liked this pizza. Followed the directions other than baking it in the oven rather than on the grill because the weather wasn't cooperating. I bet this would be good with a white sauce too. Thanks! :)

I loved this pizza recipe, I made individual pita pizzas with this.  On some I added sliced kalamata olives for those who liked them, and others I add sliced cherry tomatoes.  This would be a great appetizer pizza for parties as well.

The Boboli crust grilled up beautifully with almost a crusty wood-fired pizza texture.   We enjoyed this, but I will add some caramelized onion and sliced black olives the next time I make this.  I did only use two links of the sausage which filled up the top of the pizza nicely.

This was really good! The whole family enjoyed this pizza and especially the sundried tomato chicken sausage! I did make a couple of changes: I used uncooked pizza dough and added caramelized onions on half and mushrooms on the other half.  This was a really quick meal to throw together and the family has asked to have it again soon!

This pizza was excellent, but I would leave off the feta next time.  Didn't need it, the other cheese was fine by itself.  The chicken sausage was a nice touch and I diced it up small so it wasn't an overpowering flavor.  My husband wants me to add this to our list of "fav" homemade pizza recipes now.  And I can keep some Al Fresco in the freezer so that's not a problem.  Overall really good and satisfying.

Really good pizza! I added onions since they are a must on any pizza we have, and I also added baby spinach near the end after the cheese was mostly melted. I found that one package of sausage was enough for 2 pizzas, so that's what I made. There was still lots of sausage on each one. Good stuff!

I made my own pizza base.  I am a huge feta fan and loved the combination of feta and oregano.  The sausage tasted a little rubbery for my taste, next time I will slice the sausage into small cubes.

We really enjoyed this pizza. I found the tomato basil sausage to be more mild than the other flavors that had fennel. I have been avoiding pepperoni and sausage on pizza, to lower cholesterol, so this was such a rare treat. I wanted the pizza to be more fresh, so I used fresh dough. I also just made my own sauce. I mixed a 4oz can with about 1/4-1/2 tsp or oregano and a little minced garlic. I also made my own garlic olive oil by adding some minced garlic to olive oil, making the same amount. I cut the sausage about 1/4" and cooked them in about a tsp. or two of olive oil on medium until they were browned. I sprayed a 12" pan with olive oil, sprinkled it lightly with cornmeal, and then spread the crust onto it. I rubbed it with the garlic olive oil and pre-baked it in an oven at 425 deg for about 10 minutes. I took it from the oven and layered the ingredients as suggested. I used about 2/3 of the 4 oz can of sauce. I am not a fan of feta on pizza. I added only about 1 Tblsp, only, of plain feta. Since I cut back the feta I did 1 1/2 cups of the Italian cheese blend. I didn't want to overwhelm the pizza with oregano, so I just topped it with 1/2 tsp. I then baked it about 11 more minutes. Very filling, ty.

I made this in the oven, since it was too cold to grill.  Love the flavor of the chicken sausage.  Nice and spicy!  I also skipped the feta and used all pizza cheese.  Delish!

We loved this.  I made small pizzas and we tried one with basil pesto instead of the pizza sauce.  We really liked it both ways.

We enjoyed this recipe as an easy dinner during the week. I used the Garlic Chicken Sausage instead of the Tomato/Basil the recipe called for, then tried tomato/basil feta cheese and also used Indian flat bread in place of the "boboli" type pizza crust. The flavors were perfect and it was so simple to put together.

Very simple to make.  I think this pizza could stand to have a bit of roasted garlic on it as well.

I enjoyed this pizza.  It was very easy.  I used a package of Al Fresco pre-cooked Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage and it was so easy and delicious.  I used a package of shredded cheddar and mozzarella since that is what I had on hand.  I will make this again.

I was not particularly a fan of this dish.
I didn't like the taste combo of the sausage and feta cheese. 
My husband and his friends did enjoy this pizza though, and ate the whole thing. 
To each their own. There's nothing wrong with the recipe, just didn't suit my personal tastes.

I was pleasantly surprised how much we enjoyed this sausage!   The pizza was so simple to put together and was really flavorful.  Definitely will make again.  I think it would be really good with some sauteed mushrooms added also.  Al Fresco - you have some new fans!

Delicious.   The only change I made was to add sundried tomatoes and used the “Master Pizza Dough” recipe on the Allrecipes website for the pizza crust.  Grilling it on the grill gives it a great brick oven flavor.  This was a great pizza that we’ll be making often.

I made this today for lunch!!  I tried to use the outdoor grill, but couldn't get it to stay lit.  So, I grilled the sausage inside on my grill pan and then baked the pizza crust in the oven on 350.  Once I had all the toppings on, I baked it in the oven until the cheese was melted.  It was delicious!!  We will definitely have this again!

MY first attempt at grilling pizza. ALthouh I did manage to burn the bottom of the crust, this pizza was delicious anyway. Will definitely try again and watch the grill temperature closer.
