I made this for my fiance and we both loved it alot. I used my favourite chili instead of the pace sauce. Also my fiance suggested adding rice to the meat next time which I thought sounded good. It was super easy and super fast and tasted amazing!

This has some potential but be very careful, that cheese soup has lots of salt in it.  I cooked the beef as normal but with the soup it came out very salty.  I could taste that under all that salt is could be good, but was not this time.

I mixed the cheese soup in with the beef mixture. It was difficult to spread evenly on it's own. Even my picky nephew (10) loves this.

Very good!  I mixed the cheddar soup with the beef and salsa as suggested by another viewer for easier spreading. I also added fresh garlic and minced jalapeno.  I did not have Pace Picante so I made my own salsa which I thought would give it a fresher taste.  Much of the flour tortillas were not permeated by the sauce so next time, I will stack in twos or maybe even put the mixture between each tortilla instead of stacking 4 flour tortillas as suggested by the recipe. The flavor was wonderful!  It was delicious--and so, so easy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious but made some changes.  First, I used less than 1/2 the amount of chili powder and only 6 tortillas.  I added a can of corn.  I used green chile salsa instead of picante (yukk).  Also, I used the Progresso Recipie Starters cheese soup instead of the condensed.  Not only is it a larger can but is creamier than the condensed soup.  I decided on this after reading other reviews about there not being enough moisture/sauce to moisten all the tortillas.  I mixed everything together in the skillet and poured it over the tortillas in order then baked it at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes.  There are only 3 of us and it was almost gone.  Very good recipe.
