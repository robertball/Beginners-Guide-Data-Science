Cooked in a ceramic Primo grill. Temperature of meat came out perfectly all the way through. Smoked the piece the 2.5-3hrs but given the relatively short smoke time the flavor was primarily in the outer layers of the piece; the more traditional palate may do without the smoking (I personally like it). Highly recommend.

Good roast, nice smoky flavor. I pulled mine out of the smoker at 125 degrees, and wrapped it in foil until it reached 135 degrees.
