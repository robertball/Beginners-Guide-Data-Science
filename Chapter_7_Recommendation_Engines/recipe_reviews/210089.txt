I've made these and they are really good.  I prefer Cream Cheese stuffed in mine with the wrapped bacon...identical recipe but with CC instead of PB.  But the PB is very good, too.   Just curious to Lilysmom...why would you give a recipe 1 star and post a "review" with absolutely no critique of the recipe whatsoever?  My assumption from you "seriously?" is that you've never made these.  So why give a review at all?  If the recipe doesn't appeal to you...simply move on to the next.

Wow I was very skeptical about these but curios, so I decided to make a small amount using 4 peppers (enough for 8 pieces) when I hosted dinner for another couple. That way I figured one each to try, if they were good we had one more if not then I wouldn't feel bad throwing them out.  Let's just say everyone wished I had made more!  They were so good.  One thing I did extra was broil them on each side after baking for the first 25 minutes. I can't stand soggy bacon this way the peppers got nice and soft from baking and the bacon was nice and crisp from the extra step.

Made these for Christmas Eve, sounds weird, but they were delicious!  Who doesn't love peanut butter and bacon, and then the subtle kick of the jalapeno, yummy!

This was a pretty good version!!  Good Job!    I used to make these in the 90's but crisped the bacon and added to the Peanut Butter before stuffing. (then there was no issue with soft bacon) and I placed a small strip of bacon down the top.  I make a Cayenne Cream Cheeze drizzle to put over the top also.  Satisfies all the cravings! :-)

I wasn't sure these would fly...BUT THEY DID.  So weird but really good. Used Turkey Bacon and after the bake time broiled them until they got good and crispy.  TIP: don't cut off the top of the jalapenos- this way the PB won't run out.  GOOD ONE!

Okay, so you can't please everyone 100% ;-) I decided to give one 1/2 of one jalapeno a try using the peanut butter when just making a batch of my version of bacon jalapeno's and I am sorry to say I didn't like the combination :-( Don't get me wrong, I do love peanut butter and bacon sammies or burgers but there was just something about the peanut butter and jalapeno combination that didn't sit well :-( However, I am rating your recipe a 5 for originality ;-)

An okay way to eat stuffed jalapenos.  If you are stuffing some jalapenos with cream cheese and wrapping them with bacon anyways you might as well give them a whirl!  We used creamy Jiff and baked them in the oven as directed.

Better stuffed with breakfast sausage and cheese and cooked on a grill over indirect heat, toothpicks hold the bacon on better and if the stem is left on the jalapenos they look like burnt mice they are good though.

It seems so wrong, but it is so right.  Everyone loved them.  Because I generally don't like things wrapped in bacon because the bacon doesn't get crispy, I pre-baked some of the bacon on a cookie sheet until about halfway cooked and then wrapped the jalapeños with it.  It worked great.  The bacon was so nice and crispy.

I didn't think these sound very good with peanut butter but since i eat peanut butter and jalapeno sandwiches i thought I'd try them. I liked them. Now I'll make a few of these and a few with cream cheese to mix it up a bit.

My husband and I are certainly in the minority on this recipe. I can't offer any ideas on making it better. I guess it just wasn't our thing.

1. As many other have said, at least par cook the bacon to give it a head start. 
2. Leave on the stems to prevent oozing ingredients
3. I tried swirling cream cheese/peanut butter (cool, then savory, then spicy/hot from the pepper.)
 Which cried out for?  Jelly of course.  It's a bronco berry sauce thing.
Outstanding.

I loved all the ingredients and made just as directed but my jalapenos were soggy and all my guests only had one.  I was having a thai chicken main dish and thought these would have been perfect.  Will not make again.

Pretty good! During our camping trip, I prepared our traditional bacon wrapped jalapenos with cream cheese on skewers to grill...  But I snuck a few of these peanut butter varieties on there. My husband laughed at me but after he ate one, he was impressed.

10/10 so delicious! Great for a get together/board game night :) Can also substitute the PB for cream cheese or do half and half.
