This has the potential to be a 5 star recipe, but for me personally the balsamic was too overpowering for the dish, I think I will tweak it a bit and would be a great recipe. I will probably omit the balsamic and the chicken stock and just sautee them in butter and then do the bacon with garlic and sauteed onions. Thanks for the start!

One thing to remember when using balsmic ordinaire is that it is not as sweet as aged(expensive) balsmic.  We add a little sugar(old chiefs trick) to simulate the good stuff.

Never did I think I would rate a brussels sprouts recipe as 5 stars. I thought about tossing the sprouts when I got my weekly delivery of organic veggies and saw those in there. but not wanting to be wasteful I figured I would try to find a good recipe to use them in. This was a perfect recipe! I added some cooked quartered red potatoes with the sprouts during the last 10 minutes of cooking and it was so good. Be sure to use good quality balsamic. I used an 18 year aged BV that was slightly flavored with cassis which worked well.

Great recipe! Took a little longer than I had thought it would to reduce the sauce, but very worthwhile in the end. My son has always despised brussel sprouts, but he actually liked this recipe. Will definitely make again! Thank you!

This recipe really spruces up Brussels sprouts! I've made this version a few times, and it is really good, however I think you can definitely cut back on the calories and fat. Instead of using 1/2 pound of bacon (wayyyy too much if you ask me! Why not just have bacon for dinner?) I only use about 3 slices. This will give you about 2 tbs of fat to work with, and you won't have to drain any of it. I also use center cut bacon which has less fat and more flavor.  I eliminate the butter altogether, I find it really unnecessary considering all of the other liquids that you add in later, and there is enough bacon fat to coat and cook the onion and garlic. I also add a whole small onion, and more garlic to enhance the flavor. Using chicken broth also works (I sometimes don't have chicken stock), but use the stock if you have it as I think it's a little more flavorful that way. Overall, a really good recipe--one that even my mother asked me for! Which is saying a lot.

This was an easy and flavorful recipe. I love using fresh, colorful ingredients like these. I didn't have any Balsamic vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar, and the flavor wasn't too overpowering. Toward the end, I also added the Cherry tomatoes pictured in the recipe photo and they added great texture and flavor. Overall this was a hit at out dinner table. We will be trying this one again!

I thought this was an excellent recipe, with a wonderful combination of flavors.  I brought it over to my in-laws for Thanksgiving and thought it might be a little too strange to be a popular dish but everyone loved it.  I'm a little ambivalent about brussels, but these flavors really work to complement these strange little guys!

You can be sure I'll make this again. My wife and I like Brussel Sprouts but this recipe is fantastic. We had the left overs the next night. I did add rice that I had already cooked, to the recipe. Also I did add about 1/2 tsp of sugar as mentioned by other reviewers. My wife and I give this a high five star rating. Loved it.

I haven't eaten Brussels sprouts in about 25 years, I didn't like them when I was little.  My husband and I decided we would search for a recipe, we just knew that we would like them if "cooked right".  Tonight we made these...I loved them.  My husband liked them.  I don't eat bacon, so I just add 2 more TB olive oil.  I messed up and mixed the vinegar with the broth...it was still great!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! The flavor is very surprising with this recipe.  The bacon and butter offer just enough salt to make the dish savory and wonderful.  I let the sprouts simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.

Maybe it's my love of brussels sprouts but I really liked this dish. The bitter element of the dish offset the tanginess of Tantalzingly Tangy Meatloaf and slightly sweet Red Garlic Mashed Potatoes.

Really tasty.  I'm not normally a big fan of brussels sprouts, but boy oh boy.  Recipe is similar to how I prepare collard greens.

I added about a tsp of sugar as others suggested to sweeten up the low-end balsamic I have.  It did make the difference! 

*I would strongly suggest tossing the sprouts into the pan to sautee in the bacon squeezins for a little while before adding the balsamic and stock.  That helps infuse the sprouts with the bacon and garlic flavors even more.

I can now say I like brussels sprouts.  
 I omitted the vinegar because my husband can detect trace amounts of it in all my cooking and despises it.  That was the only change.  yummy!  thanks for the good recipe.

Had this for Christmas eve dinner last night.  Every body seemed to enjoy it, even a few who said they don't like brussel sprouts.  I followed the recipe pretty close but was a little short on balsamic viniger and a little heavy on the butter.  I would definitly make this again

After reading the reviews I was really hoping for a great recipe...but no one in my family liked it, not even those that love Brussels sprouts. I would have given it no stars, but I gave it 2 because its easy to make, and most of the ingredients are usually in most kitchens. A lot of other reviews say its good, so it probably comes down to taste. But I wont make this ever again.

I really didn't care for these.  Just way too much of a vinigar taste.  I might try it again and alter it to much less balsamic or possibly change to a malt vinigar but still in all less.

FANTASTIC! I tend to follow the recipe exactly as written and each time it turns out delicious. I make this a lot and my husband loves it. I think it is best if you really cook the bacon all the way until it's almost crunchy. And you have to make sure to really reduce the vinegar down, which gives it a rich flavor. Overall - this is one of my favorite dishes!

Delicious sprouts! I usually just fry mine up in bacon grease (I'm southern, after all) but wanted to try something new. I omitted the EVOO and butter and just use the bacon grease. Didn't have regular BV so I used a balsamic glaze that's more like a syrup and only a turn of the pan. These were so good, my very picky 9 year old ate all the leftovers and asked me to make them again the next night.  A winner in my book! Thanks for the recipe.

Given that this recipe is very simalar to one with green beans that my family loves, I had very high hopes for this one.  I followed the recipe exactly and even added the 1 tsp sugar as recommended by others.  It was bland.  Just blah.  Between the bacon, the onion, garlic, and vinegar, I expected a nice flavorful balance that (at most) would have only needed a little tweaking.  I even added additional salt and pepper, balsamic vinegar, and some red wine vinegar at the end to give it a little more zing.  Didn't help much.

Wow!  These were really great brussel sprouts!  The bacon gives it a great flavor.  I didn't use the whole 1/2 pound either though.  I also added just a touch of sugar as reccommended by other reviewers.  Just wonderful.  Thank you!

The number one complaint on this recipe is the strong vinegar taste. The longer you cook the mixture with the balsamic vinegar, the less sharp your sprouts will tase. I cooked mine uncovered until the vinegar smell was nearly gone. The rest of the vinegar should boil off as the sprouts cook leaving a nice flavor with only a hint of vinegar.

I followed the directions exactly as listed and while it was very good, I found that balsamic vinegar to be too powerful for me and my family.  I will definitely make this again, but will use half the amount of balsamic vinegar to see if that makes the flavor not so overpowering.

I am so proud of myself (and owe a huge "thank you" to my friend who made these for a Thanksgiving recipe exchange I hosted) - b sprouts were my #1 most hated food, stemming back to childhood. Out of politeness (and the need to not be hypocritical in telling my kids they "need to TRY new foods, otherwise how will you know if you like it or not??") I tried one of these, and it ended up being my favorite dish at the exchange! I made them last night for our first Advent dinner and was thrilled with the results. I omitted butter, used chicken broth, less b vinegar, scallions, did cook the bacon (in oven) until crispy (tossed with sprouts the last few min of cooking,) used more grease than suggested and forgot to halve the sprouts (next time need to - they will cook quicker - core stays hard longer otherwise.) So pleasantly surprised by this recipe!!

Everything is better with bacon! I didn't grow up with brussels sprouts, but I happen to love cabbage, so this wasn't much of a stretch. This dish is absolutely delicious! I normally make modifications to recipes, but this one I follow exactly as is and it turns out wonderful every time.

This is the first time in my 47 years of life that I ever ate Brussel Sprouts. They were to die for! I won't ever eat them any other way. I cooked them for only 5 minutes cuz I like my vegetables crunchy. Thanx Belle!

Made this for Thanksgiving last year. I hate having the same old sides every year. My daughter and I liked it a lot, but I think a little less vinegar next time.   It was even good leftover.

Excellent recipe.  I let the sprouts sit in the flavors for an extra thirty minutes on low and they really absorbed the bacon and balsamic flavors.  I am anxious to try with red wine in lieu of balsamic.

Made exactly as written - very good and a tasty alternative to plain old boiled & buttered brussels!

Delicious recipe! I boiled 2lbs of halved sprouts for 4-5min prior to placing them in the final broth. Also reduced the balsamic and added 1 tbsp sugar to cut the acid. Definitely will make them again!

The chicken stock took way too long to cook down.  The brussel sprouts and bacon both ended up soggy.  Next time, I'll omit the stock and add the bacon at the end.

I made this recipe for the first time as a side for Thanksgiving to take to my daughter's.  I usually try a recipe at home first, but this one just sounded so good that I thought it would work. Everyone loved it, and I was elected to make it again for Christmas Day! Yummm!

Everyone loved these and like other reviewers said, even the ones who didn't like brusselll sprouts!  They take longer to cook than the 10 minutes stated. around 30 minutes.  I fried my bacon crisp and added it at the end.  l definitely will make again!

Thank you for an easy to follow recipe! I had never cooked brussel sprouts before and they turned out great. I read all the reviews on changes etc., but decided to stick with the original the first time. I will definitely make these again!

Loved this recipe.  I used good balsamic vinager and pre-cooked bacon, I opted not to use salt, but instead, I added 1 tablespoon of capers.  My husband started to make a face, but decided to give it a chance.  Now this is another way to eat this veggie.

I love this recipe. I use red wine in place of the balsamic vinegar. I find I sometimes have to push the sprouts to the side to reduce the stock down. The brussel sprouts taste as good as they possibly can.

Oh. My.  Goodness!  This recipe is delicious!  I had never tried brussels sprouts before I made this recipe so I wasn't sure I was going to like them.  I definitely do! So much flavor from the chicken stock, garlic, onion and balsamic vinegar.  And the BACON!  Wowee, the bacon gave it fantastic flavor too!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Can't wait to make this for people who supposedly don't like brussels sprouts.  I bet it will definitely win them over.  Thank you!

Really Yummy and a colorful addition to your Holiday/Festive Dinner. I made this for Thanksgiving last night and it really impressed everyone! Probably the best part is that this dish is prepared entirely on the stove top which is nice when the oven is on overdrive trying to get the turkey/Yams/Stuffing etc...done all at once. Really worth a try!

The first time I tried this I wasn't so sure but when I just allowed the brussels sprouts to cook a little longer it came out amazing. The extra cook time allowed the bacon flavor to come through. Even my 3 year old ate some! Thanks for sharing!

this was so awesome!  i cut this in half and used closer to 1/2 pound of brussel sprouts b/c that's all that i had.. but i kept everything else the same.. for the chicken stock i used 1/2 tsp of bouillon (instead of the 1 tsp it calls for to make 1 cup of chicken broth) and the 1 cup of water.. i didn't feel the need to add sugar even though i used cheap balsamic vinegar.. but we aren't fans of sweet anyway.. i can't wait to make this again.. ty so much for the recipe

I was looking for a new Brussel sprouts recipe for a holiday dinner party and this one got great reviews and sounded good. In general I liked it but I doubt I will make it again. I used aged Balsamic vinegar and followed the recipe exactly. It was quite thin, sauce-wise, and really didn't have a great deal of "wow". The fact that there were leftovers was the proof.

The taste of the vinegar was too strong. I poured off most of the liquid and added some garlic to try and mask the vinegar taste. Even so this was not very popular. If I made it again I would omit the vinegar completely.

Loved this recipe. Poured off just about all off the bacon grease, and used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic. Came out wonderful. Very easy to make. I love it and I used to hate brussels sprouts. Taste even better the next day. Wish I found this recipe sooner.

Made this for the first time because I had fresh brussels sprouts about to go bad. I had the rest of the ingredients in the house already. A great dish, you can omit the bacon if you are vegetarian. Was a hit for sure and will make it again.

Very tasty....i added more garlic and red hot chili pepper flakes for a kick. Took longer for it to simmerbut i like my sprouts really tender. the balsamic vinegar should be good quality or sugar can be added for a cheaper one. overall very good

I thought I would try one more brussels recipe and if my children hated it - I was done trying to make them eat them.  SUCCESS! (Note: I cut the balsamic in half and added a touch of honey to appeal to the kids.)  Good stuff!

DELICIOUS!  I only used 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar (that was all I had!) and added a tsp of sugar per others suggestions since my balsamic was not high quality.  This is the first time I have ever wanted more brussels sprouts!  The reheated leftovers were even better - the  sauce soaked into the veggies making them oh so delicious!

The balsamic adds a great flavor.  I would say that I've done this recipe thrice now and you have to cook them longer than the recipe calls for.

This dish was delicious and fairly straightforward and easy. I think it's important to have a real quality balsamic for this as that is one of the dominant flavors along with the bacon. The picture seems to have tomatoes so we added a few cherry tomatoes sliced in half towards the end. Make sure to trim down the tough and chewy ends on the brussel sprouts to get them to their tender best.

This is a wonderful dish that has converted several Brussels sprout haters.  I have made it with pan-roasted shallots instead of onions, or sometimes with wine and no balsamic in the simmer, but I drizzle a balsamic reduction over the finished product.  I also cook a little of the bacon a bit crisper to reserve and crumble over the top.

This is very flavorful! I really love this dish, and even plan to eat it over rice for lunch tomorrow. The flavor combination is delicious! That being said, here are my adjustments to my palate:
1. 1/2 the chicken broth - mine came out too soupy
2. 1/2 the  called for balsamic vinegar - it's a little too much of a good thing for me 
3. I second the other reviewer's suggestion to add a little sugar to the balsamic vinegar to improve it - wow, it's good!

I omitted the butter because I used bacon fat in its place.  I sautéed the onions, garlic, salt & pepper in the bacon fat.  I sliced the sprouts in half,  brushed them with bacon fat and drizzled a little red cooking wine on each half.  I placed the sprouts in the oven on 300 degrees for 20 min.  Then, I placed the sautéed items on them and put them back in the oven for 15 min.  At the end, I needed just a little more salt and they were delicious!  I will definitely cook the sprouts this way again.....

This was excellent! I made exactly as written the first time, but the second time, I used less vinegar (just personal preference) and will use much less from now on (1/4 cup is plenty for me). This time -at the very end- I took the skillet of brussels and broiled them on high for the last few minutes in the oven...have mercy!! Everything browned and crisped up a little and it was so good! Will broil at the end from now on. So thankful to have found this recipe!

Used turkey bacon which did not create the grease.  But used olive oil to sauté the onion.  Did not use Butter to get the fat down.  Did not have chicken stock so used bullion.  Still turned out amazing,  I will definitely make it many more times.

Very good serve hot Try not to let it get warm because of the Bacon grease. Excellent flavor and simple.

Don't really like this and I love bacon and Brussels sprouts. This is like a German potato salad .....except with sprouts. Also with so much liquid the sprouts aren't crispy.

I followed baker girls review and it was delicious without the balsamic and chicken broth. I actually added a little Worcestshire sauce just for a little taste of it.

Loved this way of presenting brussels sprouts!  However, instead of boiling the sprouts, I roasted them in the oven.  Added a touch of cayenne pepper and cumin.  Made the mistake of leaving them in the oven a bit too long after baking, "just to keep them warm" before serving.  So the sprouts got a bit soft, rather than tender crisp.  But I'd make them again and again.  So tasty!

I've made this several times and each time people just rave about it.  I would only recommend two things:  Buy good quality bacon, it's worth the extra dollar, and don't spend a whole lot on the balsamic.  I've made it with very expensive stuff and cheaper grocery store stuff without much difference.  

Enjoy this just the way it is!

This recipe has way too much liquid-next time I would not use 2 cups of chicken stock.   Two bouilllion cubes would be fine.  Great flavours.

I make this all the time with a couple minor changes. I do add about 1/2 tsp of sugar. And I don’t add any butter or oil. I just reserve a little extra bacon grease. Delicious!

I followed this recipe and brought to a gourmet pot luck. This dish was the one people raved about. Kind of a surprise- I thought people didn't like brussels sprouts but they loved this. 
I cut the bacon into small bits and think the neat little dices added to the appeal. 
To bring it to a pot luck I undercooked slightly, then put it in the oven when I arrived to warm up for a few minutes and finish cooking. I didn't add the balsamic glaze until the last minute.

These were delicious! Many non-brussels sprouts eaters got seconds. The sauce was a little thin, so I reduced it further after the sprouts went in. They were even better the next day, so cooking them in advance would be great, then all you need to do is heat and enjoy!

Took longer to cook than recipe calls for. Otherwise, great taste and will keep making them.  Might experiment with roasting them in oven for a crispy finish.

I have made this several times and the whole family loves it. I have made a few changes, instead of onion I use shallots, instead of the balsamic vinegar I use a white wine. I also add sundried tomatoes at the end. Perfect :)

Love the recipe but I used a sweet balsamic salad dressing in a bottle.
What a difference!  Try it and cut a cup of the chicken stock back.

I followed the basic gist of this recipe.  Didn't really measure anything and I didn't use any onion, but the overall flavor of this recipe was really really good.  I will definitely be making this again.  The bacon and balsamic really brought out a nice flavor.  Thanks!

Made this with the substitutions of turkey bacon and vegetable broth and it turned out insanely delicious. Took much longer to reduce and was still pretty juicy but that made for an excellent sauce. Also added +1/2 tsp sugar to the balsamic as suggested by other reviewers. Will definitely make this again!

I am sorry to say I served this recipe for Easter dinner.  Terrible! For all the preparation, these didn't even RESEMBLE the taste of brussel sprouts. I am glad I had a back-up vegetable side because these were hardly touched! And yes, I even purchased the aged balsamic for this disappointing dish.

Just tried it for the first time.  Substituted .25 c apple cider vinegar, as it's what I had.  A definite keeper.

This recipe was OK - let me start by saying that this was our first time trying brussel sprouts and that I used frozen. I had gotten them cheap & from a store that doesn't normally carry them.. I thought "why not just try!".  I sought out a recipe that had other ingredients that our family loves. 
The bacon, onion, and balsamic flavors were amazing. I cut down the balsamic to about half, because of what other reviewers had said. 
The only problem is that we simply don't like the bitter taste of brussel sprouts. I ate my usual serving size of veggies. My boyfriend had one bite. And our 3 year old had a few bites before deciding he didn't like it. 
I can't knock the recipe too much though, as I would loooove it for green beans.  Just beware that it won't magically change veggies for ya.

These are amazing!  I usually 'tweak' recipes I use on this site, and I've never tweaked these one bit - they're PERFECT!

I like to use the leftovers to make a pasta with sausage, tomatoes, and spinach/cheese tortellini.

A very tasty way to serve this veggie. I didn't use butter or oil because there was so much bacon grease that I couldn't justify the added fat. On the same note, I didn't use a full half pound of bacon & it was still plenty... I'd say about 4 thick slices. My only issue was that putting the bacon back to the pan to simmer ruined the crispiness of it. Next time Ill add it back at the end.

I didn't think I liked brussel sprouts, but they were appropriate for a traditional "English" themed dinner party, according to my husband who remembers having them frequently as a child.  So I found this recipe.  It was a big hit.  Several people commented that they'd never been especially fond of brussel sprouts either, but that this was really good."

We all loved this recipe, and I don't generally like brussel sprouts.  Very easy to make.  I did cut back slightly on the balsamic vinegar to make it less tart.

Absolutely wonderful!! I was little scarred because of previous reviews stating cooking time was longer, but I had no problem & it was quicker than I expected. The taste was fantastic since this is my 1st time trying BS. Gave a few people @ work the recipe,,loved it!!! My son was my biggest fan thanks for opening my eye to one of most LOOKED at veggie in the produce section but everyone is terrified to try... you go girl!

I've tried many brussels sprout recipes and by far, this one will be the only one I make from now on.  When the balsamic vinegar reduces, it's so sweet and complements the sprouts and the bacon adds a great flavor.  Thanks for sharing

With my slight changes this was an incredible meal.  I used thick cut apple wood smoked bacon, no balsamic vinegar and added tomatoes.  I served it with Risotto.  Terrific combination.   Thanks for the recipe!

I will def be making these again... My all time favorite sprouts recipe is shredded sprouts with bacon, but this recipe takes less time to make since I don't have to chop the sprouts. I used low sodium chicken broth and it was too bland so I added about 1tbs of chicken bouillon granules while it was simmering (simmered for 20 min covered). Then I uncovered and added cornstarch/water mix to thicken the sauce. I had my doubts since I love the other recipe so much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I will try to make them without the vinegar next time. The vinegar taste was my only gripe, but overall tasty! THANK YOU FOR POSTING!!!

I made this as directed but cut the recipe in half because there are only two of us.  We both enjoyed it.  The only thing I did differently was to thicken the sauce a bit with cornstarch because it was too good to leave in the bowl.

It is an absolute must try!  I made two minor substitutions that being I used Duck bacon which yielded less grease but more flavor, and I used wine in place of the balsamic.  It did take longer than listed, by about ten minutes, but the finished product was great.  Well done Bella!!

Wow! I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. Thanks so much. My wife kept telling me that there is only vegetable that she wouldn't eat and that was Brussels Sprouts. If it wasn't for one time I had them before when I liked them I would have agreed. They usually turn out hard and bitter green balls that I can't stand. All I remembered was the balsamic vinegar and how wonderful they were. This was so wonderful that my wife and I both loved them. I will make these over and over again. Thanks again.

The memories of brussels sprouts as a kid can still get the gag reflex going, that said these are wonderful.  I followed the recipe as written and was delighted with the results.  This recipe would be easy to turn into sweet and sour with the addition of some sugar or honey.
