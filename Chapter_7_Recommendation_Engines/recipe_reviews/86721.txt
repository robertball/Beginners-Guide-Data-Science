I think the ranch dressing just doesn't go with this salad. It's far too heavy. Use a balsamic vinegar dressing or a dressing made with olive oil, light rice vinegar or regular rice vinegar, a small amount of sugar or Splenda, a quick dash of salt and pepper. This will allow the flavors of the actual salad to come through.

This is a great salad!  It's easy to make, fast and very filling.   I substituted mushrooms for the broccoli (Mom loves mushrooms and I hate raw broccoli in salads) and added 1/2 cup of almonds to the second batch.  Turned out real well.

I love this type of salad.  For tose who don't like raw broccoli, just blanche it in  a couple cups of steaming water for about 15 seconds until it changes to a bright green color. Much tastier!

Easy and delicious, plus it was a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken! I subbed cherry tomatoes for the broccoli and added a couple of hard boiled eggs.  I also used real bacon vs. bacon bits.  This was great with warm rolls for a weeknight meal.

This was sooooo good it quickly found it's way into the recipe boxes of other family members.  I didn't have broccoli so added fresh mushrooms instead, which made the broccoli-hating grand-daughter that was eating with us happy. This will be eaten alot in our household.

Very quick and easy to make.  I was looking for something on the lighter side so I didn't bother with the ranch, or the chicken really.  I used balsamic vinegar.  It turned out great and I will make it again!

My family thought this Spinach Salad was one of the best they had tasted.  I left the chicken out as I used it as a side dish with chicken on the grill.

This recipe was quick and delicious.  I have already made it twice this week.  We are eating low fat so I substituted with low fat feta, fat free ranch dressing and cooked turkey bacon.  It was yummy!

This was pretty good and might have been even better had I remembered to add the bacon I cooked and crumbled and planned to use.  I'm not crazy about raw broccoli so I didn't use it, choosing instead to toss in some sliced yellow bell pepper and halved grape tomatoes. I also made my own ranch dressing, a doctored up version of Creamy Buttermilk Dressing (Pam Anderson, USA Weekend) also from this site. This salad, topped with sliced "Parmesan Crusted Chicken," and alongside a bowl of "Broccoli Cheese Soup V," was just what the doctor ordered after heavier holiday meals, snacks and desserts.

A nice change from regular spinach salad. The addition of feta cheese gives it a flavour boost. This salad will be a part of our menu planning.

Fab! I didnt add the chicken to the salad, as i wanted to use it as a side dish to the meat dish. I did add a tomato as i had one laying around. This was so tasty! I didnt even want the main course, i could've just eaten salad for dinner!

Spinach Ranch Salad Haiku: "Surprisingly good! I followed the recipe, and really liked it." I had some leftover shredded chicken, so it wasn't really small chicken pieces mixed in, but otherwise, I used all the same ingredients, and found this to be a nice combinations of flavors. (I dribbled ranch on at serving, b/c I don't like a pre-mixed salad that's swimming in dressing.)  I think hunks of tomato would be a nice addition, but still, this was a salad that worked well as a side salad, or in a larger portion, for a full meal.

Good salad, would probably be even better with the addition of fruit - perhaps chopped apples or dried cranberries.  Maybe some slivered almonds, too, or sunflower seeds?

This was a great salad. Lots of flavor and a nice variety of textures. II didn't care much for the raw broccoli, so I would leave them out or blanch as another reviewer suggested. I used ranch dressing but next time I will use sweet onion dressing instead. This would have been better with some sesame seeds or toasted nuts of some sort also. Thanks, I had a nice meal.

Great  Salad...although i used romain as I forgot to get spinach.  also used mushrooms instead of broccoli.  Next time i would add avocado - I kept wishing I'd thought to buy some as i was eating this for dinner tonight.  I also think hard boiled eggs or apple chuncks would have been good too.  Topped with a generous sprinkle of fresh ground black pepper.  uym.

This is good but Im like Mermaid-I dont think the Ranch, though one of my favorites is the best for this one.  I went with a sweeter pomegranate seasoning.  Also, I left out the cumcumbers and added dried cranberries and chopped pecans-I got rave reviews, even from my BROTHERS-so it had to be really good.  Tasted like something from a 5 star restaurant.

This is a very healthy and versatile recipe.  I'll occasionally add toasted almonds or some crumbled blue cheese, or omit the bacon or even the chicken.

Delicious and spot-hitting. I subbed some leftover homemade Caesar dressing for the ranch, which to us was a better pairing. Thanks for the tip from this column to steam the broc for 15-20 seconds, we appreciated that flavor boost. Also added almonds and cooked up a strip of bacon rather than those awful bits in a bottle. Overall, very glad to have this recipe in my r-box now.

So good you don't even know you are eating salad.  I left off the bacon bits since I didn't have any and added fresh mushrooms.  Very good.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was very quick and easy. The combination of ingredients was super tasty! I added fresh ground pepper and a little lemon juice to give it a bit of a kick, and I used white onions which worked as well.

Really nice salad but as has been said already, ranch dressing is just too heavy.  A vinaigrette type is much better.  Add a piece of crunchy French bread and you've got dinner.

I fried up some thick bacon and chopped it up.  For the dressing I used an avocado ranch.  Everything else the same and it came out really good!
