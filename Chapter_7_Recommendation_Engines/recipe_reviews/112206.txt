This is delicious! I changed the recipe to 4 servings and made the following changes: black olives instead of green, lemon juice instead of lime juice, and 1/2 can refried beans in place of cream cheese. I made these changes because of what was in the pantry at the time. Besides we like refried beans with our chimis. (I warmed the sour cream and beans slightly in microwave to make mixing easier).  I also used pepperjack cheese, which gave it a nice kick. Also after rolling them up I sprayed them with cooking oil and baked on a cookie sheet for 12 minutes in a convection oven at 350. They were nice and crispy and right before serving I poured the sauce over. Very Very Good and WILL make again. thanks for a great recipe.

How to fry a chimichanga with NO MESS: Pour 1/2 inch Oil in your electric skillet and heat to 360 degrees. Place the filling in a recangle fashion. Leaving 2" of the tortilla dry at the top and bottom.Leave the SIDE 1 & 1/2" dry. Fold the botton of the tortilla up first, then carefully fold the sides up. Roll over, making sure you keep your fingers on the bottom edge of the tortilla. Gently lay/roll the chimichanga into the hot skillet, folded side down. Fry 3-4 minutes on each side. Always use TONGS when turning your Chimi's. It's really easy and the crispy texture of the tortillas is fantastic. Best of all, NO MESS!

Pretty good but I would say to bake them!!!!!! We made 4 the way the recipe instructed and fried them. The rest we did various things - baked as is, baked with non fat spray butter, and baked with brushed oil. We could not tell a difference between the baked varities, but we preferred them over the fried in oil!!! Healthier too!
Also, as others said- too much cheese! We didn't even use 1 package of the cheese it called for. But still I would say, use only half of one bag (so use 1/4 the cheese that the recipe calls for unless you love cheese.)Would make again using these adjustments only!

WOW, this is the best recipe I've tried in a very long time.  My husband, who loves chimis from a favorite Mexican restaurant said that these were definately restaurant quality.  I followed the recipe as is; I used Louis Rich Grilled chicken strips and shredded them, and used whole wheat tortillas.  The sauce I thought was different, but it really does compliment the chimis.  So easy and delicious, and can't wait to make this again!

Yummy- sooo good!!  I also sprayed with cooking spray and baked 15 minutes on each side at 350 degrees.  The sauce is surprisingly perfect with the chimis.  I only used 5 oz cream cheese because others had said it was too much- but I thought it could have used more- so next time I will do the whole 8 oz as the recipe says.  I only made half the sauce and it was more than enough.  I used black olives instead of green.  Really great!

Overall this was certainly a crowd pleasing recipe! 
I used a store bought rotisserie chicken, that made making this so quick and easy. 
One tip I would suggest is to watch the temp of the oil. The oil should be hot enough to brown the tortilla, but not too hot so that the tortilla browns too quickly not giving the chicken and cheese mixture time to melt. 
Mine browned too quickly so after I set them on a paper towel I transferred them to a cookie sheet in a warm oven. This actually worked out well for me, it allowed me to finish other dishes I was working on, and gave the cheese more time to heat up and melt. The tortilla remained crispy and delicious! 
Also, I made too much…but the leftovers were easily reheated in my toaster oven. I will never be able to have “taco night” again, without making this recipe too! I look forward to making it again soon! 
Thanks for posting it!

I agree with the rest of the reviewers that this is an excellent recipe. Easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. I followed the instructions to the letter except for one variation.  A previous reviewer recommended adding garlic and salt to the chicken to give it more flavor. My variation is not for the fat conscious cooks, I melted a half cube of butter in a pan with about 4 finely chopped garlic cloves then tossed the mixture with the shredded chicken before adding to the cheese mixture. My wife and I agree that in our memory this is the best Chimi we have tasted.

This recipe was quick and good. I thought the chicken part could have used  a little more seasoning, maybe a little garlic and salt. Also if you fry them at the recommend heat they will burn.  I cooked them on low until nicely browned. I will make them again.

WOW!!  Boy were these good!  My whole family gave them a five.  Best chimichangas I have ever had.  I did bake them instead of frying, and they were perfect.  The sauce was delish.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

You know what? My family loved 'em! I had to make changes to accomodate what was on hand but I feel the original recipe created the inspiration & deserves the stars! Okay, I only made 1/2 of the sauce & omitted both the jalapeno & olives so used 5oz. green chiles (had opened a 7oz can), made plenty was still yummy, family couldn't believe it was canned soup! Only had 4oz. cream cheese so added 4oz. refried beans, 2oz. green chiles (leftover from the sauce), about 1/2 tsp. garlic salt & used 8oz. cheddar along with leftover bbq chicken (wiped off the sauce of course!). Did a quick fry in hot oil on both sides then baked in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. By the time the chimi's were done the sauce had gotten a bit thick so I added a bit of chicken broth (had an open carton in the fridge) to bring it to the desired consistency...I'm still kinda surprised at how good these actually were! I can see how the green olives may add a brineyness(?) so will try it next time & though we loved 'em with cheddar I really wanna try 'em with Jack. Really tasty, pretty easy & I think a creative way to use leftover chicken.

Great recipe..although I did make several changes..I used canned green sauce with added chopped green chilies, onion and some of the shredded chicken..that was all for the sauce.  I love baking the olive oil brushed chimies in the oven..the best!  My husband ate them like no tomorrow.

Oooh, SO yummy!! I took a reviewers' advice and baked with a bit of cookiing spray instead of frying and was so glad I did. (note - turn them halfway through). It saved a ton of fat and mess and the tortillas were plenty crispy and tasty. Loved the sauce! I halved the recipe and it fed my husband and I. No leftovers tonight! Next time I'll add some refried beans and use lowfat cheeses. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

You nailed it, Bobbi!! Way to go!! I've actually made it a couple times and I change nothing. OK, I eyeball the amounts and I might substitute a type of cheese, depending on what's on hand. Oh and I fry the chicken with garlic and onions and incorporate that into the filling it,and coat it with flour and taco seasoning. That's it, the rest is all you and it rocks!! I always add at least 6 more chimis to the list of ingredients because they freeze great! I don't put the sauce over the top of the ones I freeze, of course. But they go together so fast, there's no reason not to do another ten and have them around for afternoon snacks. But every time I made these, I do a fist pump and scream, "I nailed this one!" Thanks a bunch!!

The hubby said 'I want to take a picture of this because it looks like it came out of a restaurant!' I agree, this could have used maybe 2/3 of the package of cream cheese but overall a delicious recipe and a great way to use up extra cream of chicken soup in the cabinet, which is how I found this recipe ;).  Made a full recipe but half the sauce (and that was more than enough!)

These are good, but VERY heavy with cheese! Eater beware! And I'm a cheese lover! It's the cream cheese that makes the filling heavy and you don't have to make them very large... just a little filling goes a long way. I also baked them at 350 for about 15-20 minutes, after brushing melted butter on the tops to help make them golden and crispy. Here's what I did differently for the sauce:  I used a can of Stoke's Green Chile Sauce with Pork. HIGHLY recommend!!

We loved these!  We baked them (without any oil) at 350 for 15 minutes each side.  Perfect!  We didn't have olives or jalapeno, so I just made the sauce without them.  It still turned out great.  We will add this to our dinner rotation.

This was really good.  I did not add any olives or lime juice to the sauce.  Also, I only had one can of cream of chicken soup so I had to sub cream of celery for the other and it still turned out pretty good.  The filling was awesome.  I did not have any montery jack cheese so I just used cheddar instead, but it was still great.  Thanks for sharing.

I think I would search for a different sauce. The chimis themselves were ok (a little dry without sauce) but I didn't care for the sauce.

Abolutely wonderful recipe.  I took the advice of spraying them lightly then baking them and they are great!  Have made them twice now, very successfully.  A family hit!

I made recipe as written and ended up burning the chimis - I may try baking them next time, or just lowering the oil heat.  I found the sauce a tad salty, as canned soup tends to be, so I'll have to check for a low sodium option, and perhaps skip the olives.  I would call these restaurant quality taste, even when burnt!  You could cut down on the shredded cheese a bit, and recipe doesn't call for softened cream cheese (maybe it's assumed?), but it's hard to mix without being softened.

I was quite disappointed with this, not only because it didn't float my boat, but also because I have been wanting to try this for a while and the anticipation that had been building up didn't meet my expectations in the least. On the flip side, my hubs liked this more than I did, but wouldn't necessarily want it again either. What we both agree on is the sauce. It was not to our liking at all. And it makes WAAY too much! Half the amount would have been enough for more than 8 chimis!!! The sauce was the worse part, but the actual chimi itself wasn't great either. Perhaps if the cheeses were heated FIRST and THEN added to the chicken, the consistency would have been better??? As is, the filling isn't gooey-cheesy-creamy like it should be. NOTE: You can eliminate the frying step alltogether by brushing your chimis with a T of melted butter. Just be sure to bake on the very top rack of your oven, turn at least once and brush once more. It may take longer than a half hour to crisp up, but the calories saved is worth it. :) Served with Mexican Rice II and refried beans, this was just an "OK" meal. Thanks anyways, Bobbi. :-)

These turned out great! They're kind of a lot of work, but worth it when you have the time. I baked mine on 450 after brushing with oil. Serve with lettuce and sour cream.

these were very good, i did make few changes. i added fresh cilantro to the green sauce, and to the filling i added green onion, black olives and some crushed red pepper flakes for extra kick. then i deep fried them. i did have some trouble keeping them together in the fryer, so they looked kinda funny and messy, but they were really really good. thanks for a great recipe

Wonderful recipe!  Great tasting and easy to make.  I brushed the tortillas with melted butter and baked in the oven for about 10 minutes on 500 (I got the idea from another Chimichanga recipe) instead of frying, and they were great.

Delicious! We don't make the sauce though (which I know sounds odd since that is what the majority of the ingredients in this recipe are for). We just make the cream cheese and chicken mixture. Then we add black beans and a type of rice (we have used white rice at one time and mexican rice at another time) to the inside of the tortilla with the chicken mixture and then deep fry it. SOOOO GOOD!! We top it with sour cream and salsa and if we have the ingredients I make a little veggie garnish consisting of diced avocados, diced tomatoes (fresh, NOT canned), diced red onion, parsley, garlic salt and pepper. We top the chimi with that as well. LOVE this meal!

These were ok, I think it was the cream cheese that I didn't care for.  I did add some onions and bell peppers to the meat/cheese mixture as I had them on hand and normally add them to my chimis.  Might make again but omit the cream cheese or at least cut it in half.

The sauce was 5 stars, but felt the flavor of the chimichangas only rated a 3-1/2.  I baked them for 10 - 12 minutes at 450 degrees, with no oil added, and the texture was great.  Nice and crispy.  Very easy to prepare and freeze ahead.  simply put the portions of sauce in separate containers from the chimichangas and put the whole thing in the freezer.

Made this recipe against my better judgement.... don't mix cream cheese with mexican... I only used half the recommended amount but still flavorless... even after throwing in cayenne and bottled hot sauce.

These were excellent!! Made them for dinner tonight had this recipe in my recipe box for over two years and finally made it. I'm mad at myself for waiting so long! My kids devoured these  and asked for seconds! The only sub I made was  lemon juice  for lime juice in the sauce  but still delicious never the less!

My family was skeptical at first, the ingredients sauce do seem a bit strange, but they work wonderfully. My husband and brother had me make the sauce again for plain grilled chicken. High in calories, but a worthwhile splurge.

I've made these once, and everyone loved them. I will be taking them to my family Christmas party because we do a Mexican themed Christmas every year. I think they will be a huge hit! What made this so easy was that I used a store bought Rotisserie Chicken and shredded it. This made it so quick and easy!

Love this recipe!  Wondering, though, if the sour cream is supposed to go in the sauce or if it is just to use as a topping at the end?  It's not mentioned anywhere in the recipe.

Just comparing it to the other recipes off this site for chimichangas I could tell this one had some serious potential to be outstanding and more authentic and I was right!  What really surprised me was the condensed chicken soup, its so much better for you than I anticipated (so little sodium too) and it brings the flavor together so don't leave this one out!  I didn't have jalapeños or olives but it was still fantastic.  If you do want to add jalapeño, please be sure to take out the seeds AND the ribs or your mouth will catch on fire (personal experience).  I always have pre-shredded cheese, so I just used the Mexican blend which works fantastic with this and I eyeballed how much I wanted.  I also have taco seasoning in a jar, so I used 1 tbsp and it worked great (I halved the recipe).  For the chicken, I baked 2 small chicken breasts at 400 degrees for 20 minutes with olive oil, salt and pepper, then shredded it.  I also baked the chimichangas at 350 for ten minutes and they were done to perfection.  We also ate these with raw onion (personal preference) on top though I don't suggest you do this if you're on a date ;).  These are making it into my recipe folder for sure.

My family loves these chimichangas!  I have made these several times, serving them with Best Black Beans and Mexican Rice III (recipes from this site).  The only changes I made were to only make half the green sauce leaving the olives out and there is always plenty of sauce left over.  I only used half the shredded Monterey Jack cheese called for to fill the tortillas with the chicken mixture and used the other half on top of the chimis after I put the green sauce on them.  I also did as others suggested, & brushed the tortillas with oil and baked the chimis at 350 degrees for 20 min.   Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I thought it was really good. I love the sauce!! I didn't seed the whole jalapeno. The stuffing tasts a little like my chicken enchiladas, so I'm gonna experiment with stuffing ingrediants.

We really didn't care for this.  The chimis themselves weren't bad, although I would've dialed down the cream cheese and probably added some diced chilies or jalapenos to the filling.  We did not care for the sauce at all.  Even after I attempted some tweaking, we didn't end up using it.

Yum! I was hesitant about the green sauce only because of the cream of chicken soup. I didn't think that it would stay true to the Mexican chimichangas. I was wrong; it was great. the chimichangas themselves were wonderful with the chicken, cream cheese mixture. The shells were crispy but not soaked with oil (I let them sit on paper towel after being fried). The whole dish was very easy to make. I ended up yielding 12 for 5 people and they were gone before dinner was done!

my boyfriend and i thought this was extremely delicious!  i baked mine like some others said (350 degrees for 12 minutes), and i didn't even put the sour cream, cheese, or chives on top, and it was fantastic.  i thought the sauce was especially delicious.

Awesome recipe! I used jalapeno stuffed green olives and added fresh cilantro to the green sauce. Followed twistedsister's suggestion and baked them.I sprayed with PAM in place of cooking oil, they turned out crispy and re-heated okay the next day. This is a definite keeper. Am making it tomorrow for the vegetarian daughter and her husband; they are getting black beans in theirs and I am going to try cheddar cheese soup in place of cream of chicken and hope the color is not too weird. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Awesome! I put about a 1/3 can of refried beans in the chicken/cream cheese mixture, and then also put a layer of refried beans down on each tortilla before putting the chicken mixture down. I also added onions to the mixture (might add tomatoes next time). I didn't use olives or jalapenos. Then I deep fried the chimis and they are amazing!  I also baked a couple of them at 350 (sprayed w/ olive oil first) and they were good, too, but deep fried was better of course!

This was super delicious!  The sauce was incredible.  My husband made it and instead of using separate monterey jack cheese and cheddar cheese, he used a blend of the two.  We used very large burrito tortillas and because they were so big, it only made 4 chimis.  Also, as a warning, don't let the sauce simmer too long, we did and it cooked down and it was a little salty and thick.  This is definitely restaurant quality!

Very Very good.  My husband really enjoyed it.  I was a bit worried at first because he doesnt like cream cheese, but the cream cheese blended well and made the filling nice and creamy.  We will definately make this again.

These were so good! I didn't have any green olives on hand so I just ommitted tham and the sauce was still great. I might try to add some chopped green chiles to the filling next time and use a bit less taco seasoning.

An hour & 20 minutes?? I made this in 45 minutes. Absolutely delightful, but, just too similar to what my neighbor makes and brings over to me. Great taste, but, just not new for me, at least.

These are pretty good. The chimis were great but the sauce was just okay.Maybe I'll use this as a base recipe and mess around with the sauce a little bit.

Super good! Takes just like something you would get a popular fast food mexican restaurant. Next time I will just roll them like an enchilada, mine unfolded. It doesn't matter because the minute the tortilla hits the oil it puffs up and seals everything in.

I love the chicken mix. Very tasty. Not a fan of the green sauce. Its not bad just very 'olivey'. If you like olives its not too bad. Think I'll make a couple changes next time.

LOVED this - my husband is an extremely picky eater - and he raved over them.  After reading other reviews: used 4 oz of cream cheese; should have halved the sauce; baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes each side

Everyone loved these! The only thing I did differently was bake them in the oven at 350, brushed each chimichanga with oil, and baked for 15 minutes on each side in a 9x13 pan. These were requested for the usual dinner rotation!

These tasted good, but fell apart. Eating them was tricky. The grease soaked in to the tortillas and tasted delicious although it was very unhealthy. I had toothpicks all over the place but food was falling out while it was frying so I used forks pressing strategically to hold some ingredients in. Didn't work well and I burnt my fingers several times.

This is an amazing recipe!  I used an electric skillet.  WOW!  I topped with not only the sauce but guacamole and some mexican hot sauce.  HALVE the sauce ingredients. Makes WAY too much. But it is so delish I may just use it on... everything.

AWESOME; Nothing more needs to be said, but I will!  Time and time again, I make chimis (beef/chicken), this is the "go-to guide" for this dinner.  I tweek the recipe to what I'm feeling or have on hand, use the reviews that suggest quick fry/bake, and the chimmis just turn out beautifully, every time!

We all loved these chimichangas!  I used black beans in place of chicken, to make one for my vegetarian daughter and that could easily be done for the whole recipe if desired.  Other than that, I followed the recipe, using slightly less cheese than called for.  I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes per side, as other reviewers suggested and they were wonderful. We will be having these again soon!  My husband LOVED the green sauce!  Easy to prepare too!

This was sooo yummy. I halved the recipe and used black sliced olives(6 oz can). I did not pured the olives with the rest of the liquids, however. I didn't have taco seasoning, so used a Santa Fe spice I had in my rack. I really reduced the amount of cheese. I added a handful in with the cream cheese and just sprinkled a little over the chimis at the end. There is so much cheesyness with the cream cheese, that a little cheese goes a long way. I used  mexican taco cheese for my cheese. We loved it and it was a very simple dish to fix. Oh, I also baked instead of fried...sprayed with Pam and cooked for 10 minutes on one side, flipped, sprayed the other side and baked for an additional 10 minutes. They were not as crispy as deep fried, but crispy enough and I enjoyed them more than if they had been fried in oil.

I really liked the sauce and would make this again for other recipes. The chimichangas themselves wouldn't stay together and so I had to bake them and I didn't like the filling. I might try it again with cooking creme instead of cream cheese and taco seasoning and hope for better results.

Turned out great - it's hard to go wrong using that much cheese. I think next time I will try it with the re-fried beans to make it a little healthier. I served re-fried beans on the side, as well as a bed of lettuce and chopped tomatoes and fresh salsa.

Super easy and delicious. Loved the green sauce. My husband loved these so much; I had to limit him to only three. He said he could have eaten the rest (4) of them. I felt very successful! I will definately be making these again...SOON.

Pretty good & super easy. I would recommend softening the cream cheese before mixing with the chicken, otherwise you get a tuna salad-like consistency.

Delicious! I made a few adjustments based on other reviews and to save time. I put 3 bone-in, skin-on chicken leg quarters in the crockpot in the morning with 1c. of water, 2 packets taco seasoning and about 1-2 tsp of garlic salt. I cooked all day, removed the bones n shredded the meat. Then I added the 8oz cream cheese n a bag of shredded mexican blend straight to the chicken in the crockpot to make the filling. Much easier! I made the green sauce as recipe stated. (Thought it sounded gross- but YUM!) After constructing chimis as stated, I then put in a baking dish, sprayed with cooking spray n baked the chimis at 425 for about 20-25 mins til crispy. We then topped with green sauce, cheddar cheese, sour cream n green onions. Seriously, my boyfriend almost consumed the entire dish on his own. We had leftover filling n tortillas- but good for nachos or some more chimis now!

I made this for my "Cooks Club' and it was a hit! I've been requested to make them as appetizers for a party. Oh, so good. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except for I did add a little bit of the sauce to the chicken/cheese mix and I added another chile to the sauce for a little more heat. VERY GOOD! Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly except for that I left the olives out completely. I thought the recipe was quick, easy, and very delicious. I will definitely make these again.

This was quite good. I didn't follow everything for lack of a few ingredients and my wife's disdain for soft cheeses. The sauce: we don't like olives - nixed. But wow, so simple and yet to awesome. Would make a great soup on its own. We had chillies that were frozen from however long ago instead of the canned, which would have made it a little thinner I think, but taste-wise, about the same. Only used pepper jack cheese for filling and a left over grilled chx breast. I do a homemade taco seasoning (recipe might be around here somewhere) to cut out the salt and control taste.  Would rather have deep fried, but don't have a deep fryer and didn't want to deal with the after from using a pot. Next time will try to bake as suggested in comments.

I tried this recipe because my boyfriend and I love Chimi's and we don't have many options for them where we live, we were both quite skeptical; however they turned out great....the only thing I would do differently is roast my own chicken; unfortunately the store bought rotisserie chicken we used didn't exactly shred, it turned to mush.  Fortunately the flavor was good enough to overlook the mushy inside.  Since I fried them in a pan with a little grease, I put them in the oven for about 15 min on 350 to finish heating the center through....Thanks so much for putting this recipe online.

Really good meal. I'd pass on the olives in the sauce next time plus add a bit more lime juice. I would also use a bit less cream cheese. This is going in the "Make Again" file. Thanks Bobbi for sharing.

This has been a family favorite since 2006. Due to preference, I omit the olives and the 1 jalapeno pepper from the sauce. I use the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe from this site for the seasoning. Instead of frying, I put softened butter on the tortillas and bake it at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes.

These were really good, rich, and different. The only thing I changed was to omit the olives because I didn't have any on hand. My family really enjoyed them.

The chimi's were delish! I omitted the green sauce and added a white cheese sauce instead (that's how they're served at the places we eat them). They were really yummy. I did bake them for 15 mins @ 375. Also I cooked a pack of chicken tenders  (boneless and skinless of course) in the crock pot all day on low while I was at work with chicken stock and 1/2 the taco seasoning pack. Definitely helped ensure the chicken was shredded, moist, and flavored. yum!

We really liked this one too!  Very easy to make.  I used canned chicken and rinsed it really good, and I'd cut the amount of sauce in 1/2, as it made a lot.  Either that, or make extra & freeze :)

I didn't have time to puree the sauce so I just diced the olives and jalapenos really finely. The only real significant change I made was to roll the chicken/ cheese mixture in wheat tortillas, place them in a dish, pour the soup mix over the top, then bake at 375 for about 20 mins. Oh, and I skipped the sour cream. Husband couldn't get enough of it! Great recipe, Bobbi. Thanks!

My husband liked it. My toddler liked it. I just wasn't really impressed. These chimis were okay. Not bad. Not great. Just okay. But since the family liked them, I'll give it a four. Personally, I'd give it a three.  Also, the sauce tasted better once I mixed some sour cream in with it.

Made these as written and found them to be great but i didn't love the sauce. It wasn't bad but i didn't think it was worth the effort. These are just as good without the sauce. Like others, i experimented with frying and baking them and we prefer the baked variety, just make sure you bake them until crispy. 375 for 25 minutes worked for me.

Excellent, my family loved it, especially the sauce! I didn't have any green olives so I threw in about 2 tablespoons of chopped black olives and it was great. Next time I'd like to use the green olives, just to see how that would taste. Great recipe!

Very delicious! My family didn't like the green sauce, but I really enjoyed. I was surprised at how good it was, made from a canned soup base: the fresh jalepeno and olives took the "canned" flavor up to "nice & fresh", (similar to a tomatilla sauce). I, like many others, choose to bake (375 for 20 minutes). I sprayed with a buttery spray first, and when it didn't brown/crisp up, I brushed with butter. I used only half the Jack cheese inside and thought that was PLENTY cheesy. We topped with the stated, sauce, cheese and sour cream and added chopped fresh tomatoes. WILL make this one again with a few very minor changes.

This recipe is a keeper.  I baked the chimichangas instead of frying spraying with Butter flavor Pam. Came out great. The sauce was fantastic. I made sauce in the morning. Boiled chicken w/garlic powder in the morning, so all I had to do was assemble and cook.  It is really a 5 star recipe. Restaurant worthy.

This is a great recipe!!  I baked the chimichangas on about 425 degrees and sprayed with canola oil.  The sauce was also very good.  The sauce adds just a little bit of heat to the dish.  Serve with gaucamole and chips.

I made this recipe for a large group of people we had over for a holiday party.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, and was worried because I thought the sauce tasted really strange on it's own. (I added some cumin and chili powder, but it didn't affect the taste a whole lot.) Once the sauce was added to the chimis though, it was absolutely delicious.  It was by far the favorite dish of the party, and we recieved endless compliments and people telling us how delicious they were. My husband said that this dish made him completely forget about all the other food that was on his plate. Everyone ate them all, there were no leftovers! Not only was it incredibly tasty, it was super easy to make.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

VERY yummy.  If you're looking for low cal, continue your search!  They are also very putsy and very rich.  One suggestion- don't use cold tortillas, as they will crumble when you fold them up.  We all loved the chimichangas, and am definitely adding this to my recipe collection!

Oh my gosh! This recipe was absolutely delicious!!!  I don't normally cook Mexican-style foods but thought I'd give this a try. The only thing I suggest is let the cream cheese warm a bit so it's easier to mix. Also, I initially put the chimichangas in the oven, but after 15 minutes, they still weren't brown at all, so I ended up frying them for about 2 minutes on each side in the skillet with olive oil. They came out so good. And the sauce was divine. One of the best recipes I've come across on this website. Thanks!!

I have made this over and over by now and it keeps getting better and better. Of course, though, I had to mod. For 2 people, use 1 can chilies, 1 can soup, 1 tbs lemon juice, 3 olives and 1 full jalepeno for sauce; only added a little more taco seasoning and fold it like a simple burrito. Top with sour cream and tomatoes. Serve it resturaunt quality at $12+ a plate easy.

This is an excellent recipe!  After reading the nutrition information, however, I decided to make some substitutions.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 2% Milk Cheeses, and a  light sour cream.  Also, I decided to follow others' advice to coat the chimichangas with cooking spray and bake them.  The result was a delicious (and nice looking) meal.  I think the green sauce needed a little more kick, so next time I'll probably double the chiles and jalapenos.  I will definitely make this again!

I have made these a few times exactly as the recipe states. This is by far my favorite recipe on this site as of yet! The last time I made them I put a couple to the side and baked them to see if they were as good, and I didn't like them as much. Everybody loves these!

Fantastic. I used a cheddar/jack mix and fried in oil heated just to medium. they turned out golden brown and cooked thru. I thought the sauce complimented the chimis perfectly. Nice one!

I found this recipe by mistake. I never thought of making them myself at home.  They turned out good.  I did make a couple of changes.  I suggest cooking the chicken with the seasoning, using 1/2 of the cream cheese and 1/2 of the sour cream. I found them easy to wrap if you warm up the tortillas first.  I will make them again.

Really creamy and good.  1 per person is plenty if served with rice and beans - I didn't think it would be enough, but they are just right.  Left off the cheese on top, wasn't necessary, and the sauce was great.  Served with homemade salsa.

Too much cheese.  If you do not like a lot of creamy cheese, stay away.  If you do, then I guess this is ok.

I was a little leary of this at first as it had Cream of Chicken soup in the sauce.  But it ended up being VERY GOOD!  I used a roatisery chicken from the market.  Like others I sprayed with cooking spray and baked to help make a bit more healthy! I only used one can of soup and one can of the chillies in the sauce also added a handful of fresh cilantro.  Left off the Cheddar on top and put a dallop of Sour Crean and Guacamole on instead.  Served alongside spanish rice.  Everyone went back for more will be making this again soon!!!!

Wow!  This was awesome.  I have to admit, i was very skeptical of the sauce whilst cooking it, as it has an unusual flavour, but  the flavour complements the chicken filling very well.  The only change I made was using fat free cream of chicken, and this worked out just fine.  I used precooked boneless breasts from the grocerry store and just chopped the chicken.  I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested frying on a lower heat.  My first one came out of the pan golden-brown, but was cold in the middle, so I turned down the heat for the rest.  We served with a side of Mexican rice.  The filling was so quick and tasty that we're going to try it in enchiladas.  Thanks for such an unusual, yet tasty recipe!

these were pretty darn tasty. we felt the green olives gave off quite a strong flavor in the sauce but it still went well with the whole thing.
i also used whole wheat tortillas and baked them in the oven, same thing without making them too greasy.

My family loved this recipe; my 4 year old even had 2nds (minus the sauce of course!)  I used a store bought roasted chicken and added 2 cups instead of 1.  I also used a spicy green salsa from my favorite restaurant in the sauce instead of the jalapenos and omitted the green olives.  Was a huge hit and am in fact making it again tonight for neighbors.  Very quick and easy, great served with guacamole too.  Thanks Bobbi!

There wasn't any leftovers, and I loved how easy it was. The green sauce was really good, but if I were to make it again I would probably change some of the inside ingredients.

Fast, easy, and flavorful! I took the advice of some other reviewers and baked them for ease and health. They turned out great!  We turned the broiler on right at the end of baking to help them crisp, but don't put it on for long! They crisp quick!

This recipe is Amazing!!!  The only things I did differently was, I halved the recipe and coated them with an egg and milk mixture.  Then we air fried them at 350 for 12 mins.  So Delicious

I confess I never rate recipes but had to for this one.   used can of green enchilada sauce,  cayenne, and half cream cheese and half refried beans.   baked instead of fried.  HUGE hit!

I made half a recipe and made it as stated. I served it with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and a dollop of sour cream, and corn on the side. It tasted very good but I have recipes I like better. I enjoyed my meal, as did hubby, but I don't think I will add it to the rotation. It went together quickly and was ready in about 30 minutes. I used leftover turkey so I didn't have to cook it. I'm glad I tried it.

As is I would say 4.5 stars. A really great recipe! 

Whenever I try a new recipe, I make it as is the first time so I can rate it on that. After, I tweak it to find what works for me and our family. That said, I have 5 kids, rarely is everyone happy. The first time, hubby and the teens complained with the sauce on top the additional toppings of Guacamole and sour cream, etc. was melting, fell off, they wanted to pick it up with their hands...etc (waaah).

Second time I made it, I combined the sauce with everything else. I admittedly cheated, put the soup mix along with the sour cream and cream cheese in the microwave and nuked it. Whisked it together then added the shredded store bought chicken and cheese mix and folded all together. Then I placed the rolled chimis on a spayed cookie sheet seam side down. Sprayed with olive oil and baked at 350° for 15 mins, flipped over, sprayed again and baked for another 15 mins.

This was a good recipe although you do need to soften the tortillas before you try to roll them or they might rip depending on how you roll them up. I also made homemade taco seasoning vs. the packet which I felt was a lot better.

Couldn't find green chiles so used peppers. Still very good. Also, accidentally got chicken broth instead of cream of chicken soup, but added some flour and it was great.

I left out the olives and jalapeños because I can't handle too much spice. And then substituted a Mexican mix of shredded cheese. It was delicious!!!!

I fried them and them came out Loved this recipe. It was the perfect solution to some leftover chicken I was looking to use. I am much more of a salsa and sour cream girl so I opted out of making the green sauce. The actual chicken mixture with the cheese is what made this recipe absolutely amazing. I fried them and they came out perfectly golden and flaky.  Next time I will try baking them.

WOW!  I made this last night for dinner and we all loved it!!!!  My son (4) and my daughter (1) both ate these up!  My husband said that the way they looked and taste that they should have come from a restaurant.  I used a rotisserie chicken bought at the store.  And for the sauce I used all canned items!  I also did as others said and sprayed these with cooking spray and baked for 12 minutes on 350.  I cannot rave about this enough!  This is going to be made again and again in my household!  Thanx for such an awesome recipe!

I stuck to the recipe for the most part. I scaled the recipe to half though. I used Adobe seasoning for poultry on the chicken and cooked, then shredded. I mixed the monterrey jack and cheddar together. I also put an equal amount of refried beans to the cream cheese and brushed the chimis with butter before baking at 350 for 12 minutes on each side. Muoy Bien!

I doubled this recipe and did exactly what it said but also added some garlic powder and would have minced an onion in the sauce had I had one on hand. It still seemed to be missing something in flavor but overall we all liked it.  We also added a little salsa to the top and it was Great.  Thanks for sharing.

Yummo!  Even my 4 and 2 year olds ate this.  4 oz of cream cheese was plenty, and be careful not to burn them.  2 minutes a side was plenty for mine.  I'm sharing this with my friends!

These were very good!  Followed the recipe exactly!  I was skeptical about the sauce but it turned out really delicious!  I did add some extra jalapenos into the sauce though, as we love super spicy!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Absolutely delicious. I don't like olives but decided to try recipe as is and it was amazing. The only changes I made was I sauteed a medium white onion and added it to the chicken mixture and I baked them like others have said. I loved them and so did my parents who were over for dinner. We were all amazed by the flavors. I will be making these often. Thank you so much! btw - I did a few with the low carb Mission tortillas and they tasted and came out the exact same as the others. Thats a huge bonus!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I halved this recipe but still used the whole jalapeno.  (We love hot food)  We also baked instead of frying it.  Our kids loved it too minus the green sauce.  This recipe is now up there with our favorites.

The family loved this recipe.  I only adjusted it slightly.  I used black olives instead of green and I baked them instead of frying.  The Green sauce is too die for.  Will make this recipe again and again.

These were wonderful.  I did add a little garlic to the chicken mixture.  The only other thing I would change next time is to add a little more jalapeno to the sauce and maybe some in the chicken mixture.  They weren't quite as spicy as we would like.

These were so good, and the green chili sauce, amazing. I used caned black olives, what I have and they are already cut. Used cheader and Mozz. (what I already had). I did cut the recipie in 1/2, all but the sauce. Was the right about for us. Servered over refried beans, topped with sour cream, green onions and the left over black olives. Yummy. Will make again.

Wonderful recipe! I didn't have left over chicken to use so I chopped and sauteed up a few boneless skinless chicken breasts with butter, salt and pepper. When they were about done I added some onion and red pepper. I ended up adding more cheddar than jack cheese to my filling. And either it needed a little more chicken or a just a tad less cream cheese. I also baked them. Very delicious and I will definately make these again!

Yummy!!! Everyone in my family loved these Chimmies. I followed the recipe exactly except, I baked mine. My husband and I thought the sauce was good, even the kids loved it; they said it's not too hot for their little taste buds. I will be using THIS green sauce recipe from now on. Thank you for the GREAT recipe!!!

THESE ARE GOOD! WHEN I MADE THESE I DIDN'T USE CREAM CHEESE. NEXT TIME I USE THIS RECIPE I WILL CUT THE CHEESE PORTION IN HALF, THIS RECIPE USES WAY TOO MUCH CHEESE FOR MY TASTE. ALSO WILL NOT USE THE JALEPENO IT TASTE KIND OF FUNNY IN THE SAUCE.

I have made these Chimichangas about 6 or 7 times now and they are an absolute hit with my whole family. I have always baked them and found that 400 degrees is the perfect temperature. I omitted the olives but otherwise used the recipe exactly as described. They are also great microwaved the next day for a great lunch at work. This recipe is a keeper for sure. Thanks!!!

I made 3 different chimi recipes for Cinco de Mayo & these were, hands down, the favorite! I was hesitant to even make these in the first place because the recipe is so out of the ordinary but they were really good!! The green sauce is a perfect addition! I'll definately make these again! Thank you!

I made this last evening for group of ninety people. This is the best I could not believe there was green olives in the green sauce. I was a bit anxious about it but its the best green sauce I have ever had. Everyone said it was wonderful. I actually forgot to put the lime juice in. The other thing I did was used some of the green sauce in the chicken mixture which gave it an extra kick. This is a home run..

These looked Beautiful served over a bed of shredded lettuce.  The recipe made 12 ten inch flour tortillas, but not even my husband could eat more than two. My family loved it so much that they are having it two nights in a row with no complaints! 805 calories is a lot though, so here are the changes I made in an attempt to lighten it up: fat free versions of cream cheese, cream of chicken soup, and sour cream. I completely left off the Cheddar. Baked, not fried. And I used the spices from Taco Seasoning 1 instead of packaged. Also, in the sauce I used a small squirt of sriracha chili sauce in place of the jalapeno.

I made this last night and it was a big hit with my family.  My son-in-law hates Mexican food of any kind and he loved it also, which is huge as he is a very picky eater.  I just didn't add the jalepeno peppers to make it milder for my family.  I served it with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, extra cheese, salsa and sour cream and let my family add what they wanted.  It is a keeper here in this family.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

We really liked the chimis, but I have to admit that the fillings are quite skimpy.  I weigh all of my ingredients so I can keep track of how much I'm eating and their wasn't much to fill my tortillas.  So, next time I'm going to either increase the filling amount of decrease the number of tortillas.  The green sauce however was excellent and has to be made for this recipe.  Overall, good stuff.

Restaurant-quality chimis!  They were so tasty!  I made them as is except we skipped on the olives as my family does not care for olives. The green sauce just really sets them off.  My hard to impress husband was impressed with this recipe.  I will definitely make these again.

These were good, but were missing something. Didn't make the green sauce, covered them with the "white cheese sauce" recipe from this site. Tried to make them how the Mexican place here in town, but not quite.

This was fantastic. I made this tonight, and used the recipe for 8. I added mexican rice on the side and ended up with leftovers enough for 2 whole dinners. The entire family loved it. The only change I made... instead of green olives, we used black.  I took a packgage of boneless skinless chicken breasts and boiled them. Once done cooking, we shredded them with a fork and a knife. Took only a few minutes! This was fantastic and my 13 year old daughter and I had a great time making it.

Really good! I didn't have taco seasoning or cream of chicken soup, which I left out completely, I made them with crean cheese and seaonings inplace of the taco seasoning, really good. The green sauce was good the way I made it too!

Wow! That's what my whole family said when we tried them.  Just like a restaurant.  And how easy is this... I printed the recipe and gave it to my 15 year old son to make.  Next time, though, I'll probably skip the canned soup and use my own chicken broth as a base for the sauce, adding the peppers and a bit of jack cheese and sour cream to thicken it up a bit.  But, I'm just prejudiced against "cream of anything" soups.

These were good but too rich.  I will use less cream cheese next time.  I think I'm going to try baking next time like the previous reviewer since I'm not big on frying things.

YUMMY :) This was the best chicken chimichanga I have ever had, and I order chicken chimis almost every time I eat out Mexican! I cut the recipe in half to make only 4 chimis. I pretty much stuck to the recipe but I CANNOT make a recipe without adding garlic so I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic in with the chicken filling mixture and fried them in garlic olive oil. I cook everything in olive oil because it makes everything taste better! My husband absolutely LOVED it and said this was one of his favorite meals ever :)

OMG!! These were fantastic! Definitely will have again. I doubled the recipe to serve 5 adults & have leftovers. Made some without refried beans for my son's girlfriend, the rest with and substituted lemon for lime juice cause it's what I had. Only made one batch of the sauce & still had some left~not bad on tortilla chips.

Very Good.  However, I tweaked the sauce a little.  Using 1 can of green enchilada sauce, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 clove of garlic, and 1/2 a green chili pepper.

We absolutely loved this recipe! My Finace moaned the entire time she ate. I made it for 4 instead of 8 with a few minor changes. I doubled the chicken amount using grilled chicken breast using salt, pepper and garlic powder then hand shredded. I also added a diced jalapeno to the chicken cheese mixture to give the inside a kick. The last change I did was I cooked by dropping each one into the DEEP FRYER till brown, about 2-3 minutes and they were perfect! Crispy all around and the inside was oozing with cheese and chicken when cut into. Will be making again soon!

These are good. I was surprised by my hubby who kept saying how much he liked these. I didn't use the olives in the sauce but it still had good flavor. I browned the chimis in a pan w/ pam then put in the oven to heat through. this is a keeper

I make it a point to avoid recipes that call for frying but this one just called out to me. I am dieting but I owed the kids and hubby a treat. Followed the recipe to a "T" but threw in some chopped black olives. The kids could not get enough (even the 2 picky ones). These came out like the kind the vendors sll in Mexico. Kids have this down as a favorite! Will definitely make again!

Really good chimichanga recipe. I was a bit worried that the sauce would be too hot because of the jalapeno, but this is actually my new favorite sauce. We ommitted the cheddar and sour cream and used fat free sour cream. Still a winner by far!

I found this recipes in an allrecipes magazine and this is by far one of my favorite recipes to make.  I've used it for dinner parties, to make for friends, and just to enjoy for myself.
I have a gluten intolerance and corn tortillas and I just don't do well trying to fry them like a chimichanga, so I changed the recipe a bit.  I make the chicken mixture, spread it in a 9x11 pan, top it with cheddar cheese, pour the sauce over then heat it in the oven at 325-350 for about 20 minutes, then top with sour cream before serving.  Yummy!

I've made this recipe twice now and it was a hit both times! The kids wondered how this Scots/Irish grandmother could pull it off!! All 3 of my kids have worked in Mexican restaurants and thought it was great. Served with rice mixed with Rotel's and re-fried beans. Thx for sharing!

This recipe was GREAT!!!  I used canned jalapenos instead of fresh and it was fine. Watch to make sure your oil doesn't get too hot in the pan, it will burn your shell very quick.

Great - but a little spicy for the kids. I am not sure what a can of chile beans looks like? Is that a cultural reference to jalapeno peppers. If not . . . that is how it is packaged in the grocery stores that I shop at. I thought this was a really good recipe for anyone able to handle the spice!

My husband loved these. He thought they tasted very authentic. The lime was pretty powerful and I thought the chicken soup may be too strong but after a while I either got used to it or it blended in with the other flavors. I will make it again

Thanks for posting this recipe! I have had the same one and have used it for the last year or so, but couldn't find it last time I needed it. I did a search and found this one.  I have made these SOOO many times; it's my favorite dish to make and favorite dish to serve. It's one of those recipes that everyone asks "Can I have your recipe for this?" after they taste it! The sauce is so yummy; we save what is left over and pour it on tacos or whatever. I also make a batch of these with ground beef instead of chicken (for the picky husband who prefers red meat!).

I say three and a half stars. I can't put my finger on it but I didn't love these. Hubby is so easy to please, he loved them but he didn't like the green sauce (too much jalepeno). 12 year old didn't care for the cream cheese in them & also didn't like the green sauce. I think it goes back to my aversion of canned soup. Probably just me. They did look beautiful. The fried tortillas were the best part.

These were pretty good, but they were a bit too cheesy. I wish that I would have seen the other reviews that recommended cutting the cream cheese in half before I made this.  I think that I would have liked them better. They were, however, pretty easy to prepare.  I used a rotisserie chicken.  Served with sour cream and salsa.

These where a huge hit with my family.  I forgot to add the green olives, but, still good sauce & only ended up using less then half of the sharp cheese to put over top of each one.  I would of given it a four star rating because I'm not a fan of cooking with Cream of anything canned ingred., but,  my kids & husband raved about these during the whole time they ate them!  These where actually very easy & fast too make too.

I stayed close to the recipe with a few exceptions...I'm not a fan of peppers or olives, so I omitted those ingrediants.  The filling was nice and creamy and cheesy, and I was surprised how easy it was to "fry" the folded tortillas.  I loved this recipe, and I'm looking forward to making it again.  Because my husband and I are trying to follow heart smart eating plans, I'm going to try and make it a low fat version using low/no fat ingrediants and see how that tastes compared to the original.  That way I will feel a little more comfortable making this more than once every few weeks! Oh, I did use Goya Salsa Verde (green tomato salsa)in place of the peppers in the filling, and also with  sour cream for a topping...delicious!  Added just the right amount of "kick" for my taste (I'm not a "kick it up a notch" kind of girl) without it being too much.  Thank you for sharing the recipe...it became a quick hit!

I thought this was really good.  Even my husband and kids liked it and they don't normally like tex-mex stuff at all.  The kids didn't use the "green sauce".  I do think that next time, I will definitely make only half of the sauce. We had a LOT left over.  Also, I realized I didn't have enough cream cheese, so I only used half of that (or less, even)and it still came out fine. It was less fattening that way, too. :-)  I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

A couple things - first, I   think I used tortillas that were to large and thick as my chimis were large and flat.  So I think I'd experiment with that a bit.  Also, I did not expect them to brown up so quickly in the oil.  The insides were not warm - again, maybe because of the size of the tortillas.  The filling and sauce were very good.  My husband even agreed!  I did need to thin the filling out a little with milk, it was a little too pasty.  All in all a very good recipe - next time I'll know what to do better.

This recipe probably would have been good if I followed the directions by dividing the chicken mixture among 8 tortillas.  I have a tendency to make everything larger-than-life, and I only divided the mixture among 4 tortillas.  The chimis were waaay too big and overly cheesy.  The green sauce turned out really good though.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was GREAT! I omitted the olives because hubby dosn't really like them.I do agree with other reviews that say the oil was too hot as listed and my first batch was a litter darker than I preferred. Overall the flavor was delicious and I will make this again for sure!!!

Great Chimichangas.  I wondered about the soup but this recipe was really really good. I halfed the green sauce and skipped the olives.  We don't care for olives.  My husband is from AZ and he loved this.  I will make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Everyone in the family is clamoring for more.  The only difference I did was use regular cheddar cheese since I didn't have any jack cheese on hand. This is being added as a regular for my house.

Tasted pretty good, even though I baked instead of fried them.  I'm sure they'd be even better fried.  The sauce was interesting, I think next time I'd only make a half recipe of it...we didn't use all the sauce.  The filling is great, you can't go wrong with cream cheese and chicken!

Quick & Easy recipe.  Cut the recipe in half & followed the recipe.  Did not include olives or top Chimichangas with cheddar cheese.  I wasn't quite sure about the sauce at first but after pouring over the chimmies, the flavors really blended and it was good.  I brushed butter on both sides of tortilla and baked at 350 for 30-35 mins, turning after 15 minutes so that both sides would get golden brown.  I have a feeling that these might be better tasting if I had actaully fried them, isteand of baking.

Really liked th recipe & easy!! Didn't have green olives or canned chilis so used two jalepenos unseeded & little extra lime juice.  Maybe next time will add a little sour cream or yogurt to the chiken mixture to soften the taco seasoning taste.  Brushed with a li9ttle butter & baked.  YUMMY!

The whole family loved these! A very easy & satisfying dinner. I served them over shredded lettuce & one chimichanga was plenty for each person. I used a cold rotisserie chicken - This is a new family favorite!

I liked this recipe, didn't love it though, not yet. I made a few changes trying to save some calories and fat and I don't think it turned out as well as if I followed the recipe. I used the low carb tortilla shell and baked these in the oven. I used a rotisserie chicken which gave the chicken good flavor but I left out the cream cheese and cut the other cheeses in half. I think I will still use half the shredded cheese but I WILL add the cream cheese, maybe onion and chive cream cheese would be good. I also added a bit of cumin to the sauce. So when I make these again I'm sure I will change my rating.
