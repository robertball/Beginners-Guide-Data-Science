Very good pie! Like others suggested, I used vanilla instead of maple extract. And make sure you don't use a sweetened crust.

Pecan pie has always been my favorite.  This rates right up there!  I cut back slightly on the brown sugar and added a cup of coconut.  I also chopped the walnuts and turned the oven down a bit half way through baking. Yummy!

Very good but I wonder if it is really necessary to heat the syrup/butter mixture first?  I almost ended up with with scrambled eggs untill I waited for the syrup mixture to cool.  I think next time I will just melt the butter on its own and proceed as with pecan pie; no need to heat the sugar mix.  Also, since I am fortunate to have access to real maple syrup, I didn't use the artificial flavoring, cut back brown sugar to 1/3 cup and still this was too sweet; I will eliminate the brown sugar altogether next time- but there will definately BE a next time- YUMMY!

This is a great recipe! I altered it slightly to turn it "low-free"! I replaced the brown sugar with brown sugar Splenda, and used a sugar-free pancake syrup for the maple syrup. It really tastes similar to pecan pie to me. (Similar in texture, too) All it needs on top is a dallop of whipped cream and it tastes like perfection!

This pie is excellent! I added more walnuts then it called for and it turned out perfect. My family absolutely loved it and my grandma wants to get the recipe.

I have made this a couple of times.  I used 1 Tbs bread flour and 1 Tbs wheat flour.  The second time I used AP as the recipe states.  I also used walnut pieces instead of halves.  This is very good.  I make the crust using a recipe from this site.  The crust I like best is in the "Danish Apple Pie Bars II" recipe.  Just make sure to refrigerate the dough before rolling it out.

This pie is delicious and very easy to make.  I found it to be a little too sweet with the added maple extract, so instead I substituted vanilla extract.  I've taken this pie to several family events and it is always a crowd pleaser!

Good, but not great. All you can taste is the crazy ridiculous amount of maple syrup.  Easy and fast, but ultimately forgettable.

This was pretty yummy!  Based on other reviews, I  reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and I did NOT heat up the sugar and maple syrup.  Just melted butter in the bowl, then added all other ingredients.  I threw in a handful of chocolate chips too, which didn't hurt at all!

This was the second pie I have ever made and it it was AWESOME!  My friends were blown away by it.  It is very similar to a pecan pie.  My 4 starts are only because I didn't have maple flavoured extract and instead used vanilla....and I will keep it that way.

I made this pie today.  I did use the suggestion that instead of Maple extract to use vanilla.  Plus I used chopped walnuts instead of walnut halves (cheaper).  It is FANTASTIC!!!  My husband said do not lose that recipe and that he wants me to make it once a month.

Made just like the recipe and it was perfect. So good I won a blue ribbon at the Vermont State Fair on pie day ;) Several people have mentioned using vanilla extract instead of maple extract thinking it will cut the sweetness. Extract does not add sweetness only flavoring. Being from Vermont we are all about  maple :) If you don't like pecan pie this will not be something you like>remember this is the kind of pie you eat a very small slice of.

It turned out great, I also used vanilla flavoring instead of maple. I coarsely chopped the walnuts and used about 1 1/4  cups.  Sometimes a walnut half doesn't cut as nicely. I have a walnut tree, so the more walnuts used, the better.
