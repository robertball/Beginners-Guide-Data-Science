I added 1lb. of browned ground turkey and topped with monzerella cheese for a main dish recipe. I omitted the sharp cheese and used 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese instead.  My kids loved it.

I omitted the pepperoni, used all sharp cheddar, and sprinkled parmesan ontop after baking.  It was very simple and very good.

I don't recommend using tomato paste.  It came out so thick, even combined with the tomato sauce.  I personally could not eat this dish.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but it was awful!

This dish is what my husband would call a "garbage dish" - his favorite!  I also substituted 1/4 cup parmesean for the sharp cheddar.  And I did not combine the pepperoni with the other ingredients, but rather placed them evenly on the top of it all and then covered with more shredded cheese.  Great!!

This is at the top of the list for my husband's favorites...so I give it a 5!  My picky 6 year-old liked it also...he usually doesn't like anything...my 11-month-old also liked it! 

I did not change a thing to this recipe.  Soo good as is!

This was okay. I agree with the tomato paste issue...I only used 1 can and it was still too thick.  Also, there wasn't much left to it in regards to taste. It wasn't bad but I've made many lunches that are just as simple but have more taste.  Perhaps the addition of some bell peppers or onions would help do this dish more justice? Thanks anyways April.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I followed other reviews and cut down on the tomato paste and added canned tomatoes but it still came out rather dry.  I also found it to be bland even with all the additional spices I added.  This might be a good recipe for kids.

Had to change it a little but then it is a keeper.  Used a recipe for 4 servings, used a bottle of spaghetti sauce, eliminated the tomatoes and tomato paste, used sharp cheddar as shown, substituted Mexican cheese for the other cheese, mixed pepperoni with all other items, added some parsley, thyme, and herbs de provence and a pinch of all spice. Mixed everything together in a buttered casserole, add cut up pepperoni on top with Mexican cheese sprinkled on that, covered and cooked 45 minutes.  Delicious.

i could tell by reading this that the sauce was not right. WAY too much tomato paste. and when the sauce is wrong...the whole dish is wrong. it would have been MUCH better with a jarred spaghetti sauce..and i'm a homemade gal! i don't think i've EVER used two cans of paste with anything....the cheddar cheese blended much nicer than i thought it would but i will not be making this again.

This was OK, but nothing exciting.  It was easy & a good way to use stuff up.  I thought the pepperoni would give it some added zing but it really didn't.  And I didn't think it was a tomato paste problem; just not the most exciting thing.

This was great! Easy to make, freezes well and very tasty. I did take other reviewers advice and used only one can each of tomato paste and tomato sauce. My husband raved about this and went back for thirds. Thanks for the recipe April!

After reading the comments, I made a few adjustments to this recipe to use up some leftover pepperoni.    I used real garlic, but did the salt and pepper and onion powder to taste as in the original recipe.  I used a tall can of Hunt's Italian Tomato Sauce and a tiny can of Hunt's Tomato Paste.  I only had Medium Cheddar and mixed a bit into the casserole, but reserving most of it to scatter on top along with some shredded Parmesan. Based on a tip I learned from having Honduran, Japanese, and East Indian roommates in my college years, I threw in a tbsp or two of white sugar.  it helps take the edge of hotter dishes, tomato dishes, etc.  I do that in my meat sauces, lasagna, etc.   Mixing in some kernel corn worked out to be a nice compliment.  I only baked this for 30 minutes at 350F.  My family liked it and I'll be making it again with these modifications, though I'd like to find a slightly milder pepperoni sausage than the one I had on hand.  However, that's personal taste.  This is a nice change of pace, filling, and tasty.

I enjoyed the flavors of this dish even though I agree with a lot of previous reviewers that there seemed to be too much tomato paste in it, and it was pretty dry inside. I made it exactly as written, using sea salt for the pasta water and sea salt and ground white pepper for seasoning the dish. It was "done" at 45 minutes, but the cheese inside wasn't quite all melted, and there was quite a bit of tomato paste that didn't disperse throughout the dish. I did enjoy the whole thing for meals over three days, but if I were to make this again, I'd skip one of the cans of tomato paste and/or add more tomato sauce or even just some water. It was pretty tasty, but not quite perfect as is.

Alot of people commented that this recipe was bland but ill tell you how you give it a great twist... Sounds discusting but its very good...after you cook the noodles mix in italian dressing, mayo and sugar to the noodles before mixing with other ingrediants. Its very good...I left out the onion/garlic powder

I will make it again, but instead of mixing all the cheese in with the other ingredients I will place it on top like it shows in the picture.  It was very easy to throw together.  I love casseroles and this one now has been added.

Made this to bring to a social gathering, but husband and son seen it and wanted it. My son especially liked it, no leftovers. I used 2 cans diced tomatoes which I put in the blender and added garlic and basil. Also used 4 different cheeses, cheddar,mozzarella,parmesan and cotija along with green pepper and corn.

Followed the recipe but only thing I did different was added cheese during the last 15 minutes of baking. The added cheese on the top made it super cheesy! Casserole was delicious and hubby loved it!
