The sauce recipe is really awful. Why on earth would you want to ruin a dish with instant lemon pudding? Instead, use about 1 cup chicken broth, the juice of 2 lemons, 1 tablespoon honey and 1 tablespoon of corn starch (aka cornflour). Whisk all of these together while cold, then bring to a light boil while stirring constantly. Cook until the sauce becomes transparent and begins to thicken, then remove from heat and top chicken. This will make a much tastier and healthier sauce. Don't forget to throw in some steamed broccoli or asparagus!

My husband loved it and requested I make it again soon.  I added breadcrumbs to the flour for some extra crispiness.  Next time I will make more sauce.  A great dish!

I would leave out the 3 tablespoons of sugar in the sauce, it was too sweet for my taste, you can always add it if you think it needs more sugar.

This recipe was really good. The flavors melded well, although I would have added a little more lemon to the sauce. I don't eat chicken thighs, so I made it with boneless, skinless breasts and it was really really good!

I tweaked this receipe and my husband and family loved it. I used leftover cooked chicken,omitted oyster sauce,used 1tsp. splenda,reg. flour,omitted the 3 Tbls of sugar and sesame seeds. I sauted some pineapple chunks,cut in half,in a little butter/oleo and brown sugar and added to the dish. Excellant!

This was pretty good!  We only used half the sugar, and it was still sweet enough.  I would not recommend cutting the chicken before cooking; it was harder to 'bread' lots of little pieces.

We really loved this recipe. I never added the 3 Tbsp.sugar.  I marinated my chicken for about 5 hours. Will definitely make this again and again. Tasted just like the lemon chicken at our favorite Chinese Restaurant.

I made this dish with a vegetarian twist and used 1 package of extra firm tofu instead of chicken.  I first cut the tofu into 3 cutlets and marinaded them.  I doubled the marinade ingredients and added the juice of one lemon.  After marinating the tofu I cut it into 1/2 to 1 inch cubes and tossed with 1 tablespoon corn starch and two tablespoons flour to coat.  I then pan fried the tofu in vegetable oil and drained it on paper towels.  For the sauce I doubled the ingredients and added the juice of 1/2 a lemon.  I was hesitant on added the pudding mix as I did not want a dessert flavor but it actually turned out quite well.  I recommend this dish for its delicious taste, easy preparation, and the ability to change it to suite individual tastes.

I love love loved this recipe. I changed a few things, like no oyster juice & I didn't have a lemon so I used lemon juice, extra water & honey. Also I used chicken breast rather than the chicken thighs. For veggies I added sliced asparagus that I fried with the chicken & some butter. Served over rice this meal was a hit & everyone wants me to make it again. The trick with the sauce for me was to use 2 cups of water, it makes more sauce & isn't too thick :)

Mine didnt turn out so great.  My lemon sauce seemed to be too thick, but it tasted good.  And I couldnt find corn flour anywhere.  So I just fried my chicken.  I will try again and add a little less lemon pudding.

I'm gluten intolerant, so it has been difficult for me to find good asian recipes that I could make. When I found this one made with corn flour I was thrilled. It has quickly become a household favorite and I have shared it with many of my gluten free friends and they love it.

I loved this recipe! I've been looking for an easy lemon chicken recipe and this is the one. We used lemon juice instead of lemon, and accidentally used lemon jello mix instead of pudding mix. It was terrifically sweet - just like restaurants - you could leave out a little of the sugar I think. Served with steamed broccoli, it was an easy dish for Sunday night. I highly recommend it if you like lemon chicken!

The chicken has a great taste, I am having problems with keeping the sauce from getting lumps when the pudding is added. Working on that one. Good recipe overall

I gave only 3 stars because I thought it was alright but my husband enjoyed it.  I didn't like the lemon sauce at all!! Also, I am a little unsure how 3 chicken thighs are to feed 4 people!!  I cooked 7 chicken thighs, with enough sauce, and it was enough for 4 people.

this was an ok version of lemon chicken,with a chinese husband I am always trying new recipes that he grew up on.  I definately omitted the sugar in the lemon sauce and I added soy sauce in the marinade and rolled the chicken pieces in corn starch and that seemed to work o.k. for me.

It was an easy dish to make, though much too sweet for my family.  I will leave out sugar and see what happens.  We all loved the flavor of the chicken though.

Nice. Although I prefer chop the chicken into bite size pieces _before_ marinating.

I also used vanilla pudding mix as I could not find any lemon pudding mix in the store, so I compensated by using extra lemon juice, adding sugar to taste as the sauce thickened.

Yummy and easy to make.

The sauce for this recipe didn't turn out so great for me. I might have used too much pudding mixture and thats why it wasn't as thick. It wasn't as sweet as i thought it would be either. Things i would change next time i do this recipe would be : first, buy a deep frier (i think that would make things a lot easier and make the chicken taste better). Second, let the chicken marinate a little longer than an hour (possibly overnight). Third, don't use this sauce recipe (there are other lemon chicken recipes that don't use pudding to make the sauce and they taste way better). okay, that's all.

I used chicken tenders, added lemon zest to the sauce. did not  add any sugar, since the pudding has sugar in it already.. no oyster sauce ( don't have)… I did add extra water to the sauce.. Next time I plan on using chicken broth in the sauce instead of water...  had very nice lemon taste.

This recipe was way too sweet, way too gloopy and just terrible.  I had my hesitations about making it to begin with, but was looking for a little change and thought what the heck, maybe it's better than the ingredients indicate.  I should've stuck to my gut and not made it.  Absolutely disgusting.

this recipe was very easy and fun,but when i made the sauce for the chicken with the jello it was way to thick.i would use less jello for the sauce,and anther thing i have more people in my family and this only makes four servings.other than that it was great!

Based on a friend's recipe, I added mustard to lemon pudding mix, no extra sugar. We'd make it again.

Did exactly as the recipe says, and it was a mess! I tweaked the recipe a lot and made a decent meal from it. I wish I would've read the reviews first and saved myself so much trouble. Learn from my mistakes and always read the reviews!
