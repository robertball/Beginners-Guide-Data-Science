I wasn't sure what to think about this recipe because I had never heard of a cantaloupe muffin, but, it sounded interesting!   The texture of the muffin was soft and moist and did taste like cantaloupe.  The crumble topping was crunchy and had great flavor.   My husband liked them very much and thought they were a nice change.  I thought they were good also, but, seemed to be missing a little something for me.  I will make again, but, maybe add a little more vanilla or take the suggestion from the cook's notes and add some blueberries.   The only thing I did different was to add the crumble to the top of the wet muffin before I baked and didn't add after partially baking.  They also only took about 22 minutes to bake, so, it is will just depend on the size of your muffin tin.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious. No need to partially bake before adding praline topping though; just top the batter and bake. (Don't skip the topping; it makes the muffins special!)
I only had half a cup of cantaloupe puree (which I really squeezed the juice out of), so I added one mashed banana. I also added half a cup of unsweetened coconut flakes (Bob's Red Mill), skipped the lemon zest, and used only half cup of white sugar. They were ready after 23 minutes bake time. Very moist and delicious. I was glad to use the bit of overripe melon that I had.

Made as directed except doubled the batch - which made 3 dz standard size muffins.  Consistency was good but definitely need to add the crumble topping earlier in the baking.  Removed stars because so many steps, and the muffins were somewhat bland.  Still good; but kind of a let-down after smelling and tasting the delicious batter!

I love this recipe! It is a great way to use that melon that got a little overripe or doesn't have a great flavor for eating. The praline topping creates quite the "Wow" factor, although I usually just sprinkle w/cinnamon sugar. The most important direction missing in this recipe is that you must drain the juice out of the fruit puree,  which usually removes half of your volume, so measure your cup of fruit after this step.  As with most of my baked goods for home use, I substitute whole wheat pastry flour for some of the flour,  and add no more than 1/4C ground flax seed for added nutrients.

I changed this quite a bit.  Used only 1/2 cup of sugar and added a few chopped strawberries.  Additionally as I don't like pecans I just put a little apricot jam on top of each one after cooking. They tasted awesome! Kids loved them.

Moist with a hint of cantaloupe but they were missing something.  Needs an extra kick of something ...  I also should have read the other comment to go ahead and put the praline on at the beginning.  Adding part way through was messy and didn't really stick.
