OMG this is good. That is the first thing I thought when I took my first bite. That’s even after I messed up the recipe, a little. I just cannot handle chopping onion and in trying to stop the tears, I missed a couple steps and added ingredients later. Just imagine if I hadn’t made mistakes. I’ll definitely be making this again.

I used the Spanish rice Knorr side, which, next time, I’ll use the pilaf mix. I think all the seasonings in the Spanish mix took away from the lime and chili in this recipe, but overall, it was delicious, and the poblano added so much more than I thought it would!  Delish!

I substituted chili pepper with cayenne chili pepper powder and it was absolutely delicious!
