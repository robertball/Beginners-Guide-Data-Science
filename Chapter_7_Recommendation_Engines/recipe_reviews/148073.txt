I was looking for a basic honey roasted peanuts recipe and I used this one minus the spices in the sugar. And they were wonderful! Thanks for the recipe

These nuts are incredible! I followed the instructions exactly, which is rare for me, and they turned out perfect.  I did use a jar of unsalted roasted peanuts so mine were basically double-roasted. I was worried about the outcome--thinking they might taste burned--but they are wonderful.  I don't think you can go wrong here!

These are fantastic!  They give you the little spicy kick just at the end.  I served them for a neighborhood BBQ, and they were gobbled up.  I even had a couple people ask me for the recipe.  I made another batch a couple days later and I keep them in my cupboard for my family.  
If you don't like extra "zing!", don't add extra spice.  I made this exactly as written and I like things "medium" and I think they are perfect.

#1 - DO NOT BE A DOPE like me and try to make this recipe with peanuts AND cashews.  Cashews will burn very quickly at 350.  Save yourself some money and just go with the peanuts.  

#2 - The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because it's really sweeter than it is spicy.  Maybe it's just my taste, but I thought other reviews were ridiculous when they said to double the spices, but they were right.

We’ve made these many times for friends and family. Made as directed they are a medium spicy level. You can adjust the chipotle to your taste. Everyone asks for more!

It is a very good tasting mix, however when I sprinkled the dry mix into the peanuts in the bowl it all clumped up.  So I have chunks of seasoning and some nuts with very little seasoning.   Next time I would sprinkle the dry mix onto the peanuts in the pan, before pouring them into the bowl.

These are delicious I didn’t have chipotle chili powder so I just used all chili powder and it still turned out great although next time I would like to use the chipotle.  All the sugar melts so I did end up sprinkling 2 more tablespoons of sugar over the nuts once they had cooled for 10-15min.

Pretty difficult to find chipotle powder. I finally found flakes in a grinder top bottle. My wrists are tired from the grinding. I used 2 teaspoons of the stuff and upped the chili and garlic powders from 1/4 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon. I used 1/2 salt skinless roasted peanuts from Trader Joe's. I did not read the instructions correctly and put the salt in the dry mixture instead of the butter/ honey mixture. These turned out great. Not very spicy. So, if you like spicy, I would add a sprinkle of cayenne. I don't really care for peanuts but these were hard to resist. Keeper recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe--it was surprisingly easy (I thought it would be more complicated with all the pans), and they had the perfect taste combination.  Sweet and salty, smokey with a little kick at the end.  I really recommend the chipotle seasoning--definitely an important part of the recipe.

I bought a bunch of raw Virgina peanuts at the health food store and wasn't quite sure what I was going to do with them until I found this recipe.

I used evaporated cane sugar and smoked chipolte powder.  We have a hard time tolerating chile powder so I substituted smoked paprika instead.

I really enjoyed this recipe and will use it many times throughout the year.  Thanks for sharing!

Made these with cashews and they are wonderful. If at all possible, use the chipotle chile powder. (Walmart has it). It really gives that smoky taste.

After my family inhaled my first batch of these peanuts, I quickly prepared a double-sized order.

I tweaked the measurements a bit, but not the ingredients.

Definitely a keeper of a recipe!

I used a 12 oz can of peanuts, but still kept the measurements the same for the honey/butter mixture.  Since I didn't have chipotle seasoning, I made some adjustments there.  Added a very liberal 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper,1 and 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp garlic powder.  These were a hit at the bonfire I took them to; the guys especially liked them with their beer.  They were tasty with just a little kick of spice at the end.

I was hoping for more of a spicy taste. To me, these were mostly sweet "honey chipotle" peanuts.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have chipotle, I left it out and it turned out great.  NOT SPICY at all this way- just perfect!

Just for kicks, I'm going to try 2 other versions - using dry mustard and cayenne or hot Chinese dry mustard instead of chipotle. And since I don't usually have chipotle powder on hand, I'm going to try using cumin and cayenne. Oh yum!

These were really good I was out of chipotle powder so I used chili powder and cayenne for the heat as well as some cumin to make up for the smokey flavor that the chipotle has. I made these to much on through the week but they are already half wiped out. What a nice little treat sharing with us.

Pretty good. I made some to include in gift assortments, and some to eat myself. I thought they were not too hot but rather had just the right amount of kick to please a wide variety of people, but I like spicy foods. My friend, who is not big on hot stuff, thought them too spicy. I took them out after 25 minutes because I was afraid they were going to burn, but that's probably just my oven.

I made this for snacking at a party and everyone raved and proceeded to polish it off.  So I decided to make it again, this time as a little take-home-treat for birthday party guests.  I did this as a double batch two times and it worked out really well.  The peanuts tasted excellent and a lot more unique than just canned peanuts.  This recipe is worth it, and VERY easy!

These were absolutely delish!  I had some extra roasted peanuts from Costco which I had originally used to make a chinese chicken salad.  I served them at a new year's party and before I knew it they were gone!

Made this recipe for the first time tonight.  In short, peanuts never tasted better!

Next time, I will try doubling the chili powders as some have recommended.  These were not terribly mild following the recipe, only it could have more kick as well.  Given my username, I like things spicy.

These are very good made as the recipe directed.  I like spicy foods so I might have enjoyed a little more chipotle but I think that these are perfect for the average bear.

Awesome recipe! I used unsalted dry roasted peanuts. I initially followed the recipe exactly (see notes below) so I was a bit worried after 30 min in the oven they would turn out 'over roasted' but nope!

The Chipotle chili gives it a nice smoky flavor. My Chipotle chili is hotter than most so after the initial test coating of a few nuts I wanted to tone the heat down a bit so I just added more sugar to the spice mix. I'm munching on some right now.

They're going to look too wet right out of the oven but don't worry. The honey/butter coating will harden so don't forget to break up the clumps as they cool.

I made these with peanuts that had the skin still on them and they turned out great! I did not use the chipotle chile powder, other than that I made as is.

I've made this thing like three times, all with varying amounts of peanuts, and occasionally a replacement ingredient because I ran out of chipotle after the first go, haha. Love it. Didn't think a killer snack like this was gonna be so easy.

Great honey roasted peanut recipe! I left out the other spices and just tossed with the sugar. I will definitely  be making these again to use up the 10lb bag of blanched peanuts I bought!

I have made these many times now and people LOVE them. I have trouble getting smoked chipotle seasoning though and have to bring it from the US when we go back.  I can't buy skinless peanuts here and I wonder if that is why the sugar always seems to melt and then clump up.  Anyone have any suggestions?

This is my go-to recipe for Christmas gifts and parties. Everyone loves them--they have just the right amount of sweetness and spice. I use mixed nuts instead of all peanuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans, peanuts).

These are PERFECT!  My husband LOVES honey roasted peanuts, so I made these as a Christmas treat, I had to buy 2 more pounds of peanuts because all my guests ate them!  They are very easy and I love the extra kick the spices give.

I made these for a book club meeting and they were very popular! They are addictive too. So easy to make my husband declared that we should always make our nuts using this recipe instead of buying them pre-made at the store! For those who have had trouble finding Chipotle Chili Powder, they carry it at Penzey's Spices

These are a little weird. I love the honey chipotle sauce at Chili's so I thought I would like these, but I think the other spices give it an odd flavor. I also made these like candied nuts where I boiled the sugars (I used brown and white), butter, honey and spices to 234 and then tossed in the toasted nuts and spread over waxed paper to cool. The texture was awesome, but I think next time I will just use the sugars, butter, honey and chipotle.

These are the best peanuts I have ever tasted!  They are just spicy enough to be addictive, yet still so spicy that I don't want to eat the entire batch in one sitting!  I have made them several times, exactly as written, with two exceptions: for my oven, it only takes 25 min. to roast the peanuts, and I always sprinkle a little extra sugar on the peanuts after coating them with the sugar/spice mixture to ensure that they don't stick together. Try this recipe, you won't be disapointed!

I took the advice from someone else and omitted the spicy ingredients to make just honey roasted peanuts. The only reason I gave it a 4 was "about 30 minutes" was too long. I only baked them for 22 minutes, while turning then every 7 to 8 minutes and they still were a little burnt. They were tasty though, so I will certainly make these again!

Very Good. I combined everything in the recipe. Roasted at about 250 deg for about 2 hours than increased the temp to 350 for about 1 hour. Stirring every 15 minutes. Once done dumped in to a metal bowl and continued to stir every 5 to 10 minutes. till cool. This will give you a coating like toffee coated peanuts. Everyone loved them.

These are excellent, even better the next day! I thought they were going to be way too salty because I tasted them before the sugar mixture, but once dipped in the sugar they were great! I used more Chipoltle Chili Powder & no regular Chili powder, otherwise followed the recipe. I took mine out a little bit early because I felt some pieces were getting a bit too dark. Thanks for the recipe!

I acctually discovered a happy accident with this recipe.  I mixed the dry seasoning and butter into the nuts before baking them.  After realizing the oops I just made another batch of the seasoning and recoated the nuts after they came out of the oven.  I took them into the work and they were devoured, with rave reviews!  I 1 1/2x the spice so they are extra spicy...I have been getting requests for them ever since!

This was fantastic & so easy, no sticking, worked perfectly. I used 1Tbsp of Carolina Reaper powder & added 1tsp cocoa powder. This to half a recipe since I didn’t have 1# of peanuts on hand. Extremely hot but very good.

I have made this recipe many times, but as a honey-roasted peanut recipe.  I don't believe I should take off of the rating for not using the chili and garlic powders because that is very much a personal preference.  This recipe is a solid basis for whatever flavors you would like to make your honey-roasted peanuts.

AMAZING!  Crunchy, sweet, salty, spicy and the perfect nibble with your beer.  5x-ed the recipe and served this at a wedding as snacks before the buffet was served and everyone went nuts for it.  Followed the recipe as written, except roasted for an additional 20 minutes due to the large amount of nuts I had and because the pan was possibly too small.  Gauged doneness by the golden color of the nuts (like they've had a perfect tan) and not by the crispness of the nuts.  The nuts really crisp up after they've cooled.  PERFECT RECIPE.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I have made it a dozen times.  I do leave out the garlic, because I don't have garlic powder.  Everytime it works out great.  These the perfect combination of sweet, salty, with a hint of fire and depth.

Followed the recipe to the letter, and these peanuts turned out fantastic.  When the nuts came out of the oven I just had my wife slowly sprinkle the powder seasonings while I stirred the peanuts.  Got the occasional couple of nuts stuck together, but vast majority stayed separate.  Seasonings were distributed completely evenly.  Absolutely will make again.

Fantastic! But the peanuts burn if left for recommended time, so I left them at 15-20 mins at 325. Gave as Christmas gifts. Well received!

This recipe works really well. I tried several other recipes with different ratios of ingredients, and this one is the tastiest. I thought I might not need the sugar at the end - but it actually helps reduce the stickiness of the peanuts, making them more pleasant to eat and easier to store. And its not enough to make the peanuts too sweet! I have not tried this - but it seems as though you could easily replace the spices with whatever you feel like.

Super yummy snack!  There is the perfect amount of spiciness vs sugar and my family goes NUTS for them! I would definitely recommend these but make sure you wash your pan asap so the leftover honey/butter doesn't harden.

Excellent. I couldn't find chipotle powder anywhere so I used smoked paprika instead. I followed the directions exactly as written and they turned out REALLY good. Not really spicy, but a nice flavour.

I did 2lbs of cashews instead of peanuts, and gave them out as part of my Christmas cookie packages this year. I received great feedback. These are delicious.

Not too spicy, very good flavor.  Big hit with the kids.  I doubled my batch so made sure to mix the peanuts in the oven every 10 minutes.  I did not have Chipotle powder, so used a chipotle seasoning that I ground down by using a coffee grinder, worked well.

Use less sugar (1/4 cup) and/or substitute coconut oil for butter. Also, this recipe can be used on Pumpkin and other seeds.  After nuts are cool, Mix in blanched Almonds and/or dried fruit/coconut for a spicy sweet tropical flavor.

I loved these!  I used Hoody's dry roasted salted peanuts from Costco so I didn't add the salt the recipe calls for and I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar.  These would make a great holiday gift.

I've made this quite a few times & it's super easy & delish. This time I was short on peanuts so I added sunflower seeds (raw & shelled). They turned out great. Recommendation: measure out the the dry ingredients while the peanuts are roasting to save time.  Also, I substitute taco seasoning for the chipotle seasoning.

Yummy!  I made two batches, and increased the spice a bit on the second one.  But, a few people thought those were too spicy, so go with the original recipe the first time.  This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

Could not get the spice mixture to stick.  It stuck to the peanut halves but not the whole.  We loved the taste.

I made this recipe to jar and give as Christmas gifts to some friends. I went by the recipe and found it to be a very nice balance of warm chipotle and sweet honey. The only thing I did different was the final steps after taking the peanuts from the oven. I poured the peanuts in a wire strainer sitting on top a large glass bowl. So the excess butter would filter through and not clump up the seasoning. I also added the spice a little at a time and  shook the peanuts in the strainer each time I added the spices to make sure all of it was covered. Then I put the peanuts out on a long piece of wax paper to cool.

This was a very good, easy recipe.  We like our food spicy, so I doubled the spices as other reviewers suggested.  (Very spicy, but very good).   I also couldn't find chipotle chile powder, so I used a mix of cayenne and normal chile powder.  The chile and garlic powder add a good bit of a smoky/savory flavor that I personally didn't like.  Next time I will just use cayenne.  Overall, however, these were a big success and I will definitely make it again!

I expected these to be spicier. THe heat hits you at the back of the throat at the end. Not too bad, but I thought they were a little too sweet.

These are great.   I was afraid they might be too hot for me, but they're not.  They have a wonderful sweet, smoky flavor, that has just a slight kick at the end.    Thanks for sharing.
