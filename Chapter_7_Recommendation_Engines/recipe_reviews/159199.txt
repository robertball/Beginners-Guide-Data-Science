Well, I have to admit that it was very good. I have never had kale, or any other "southern" type of green. They used to sound kinda gross to me. But, my CSA box sent me a bunch of kale and I wanted to try it one time, to see if I truly did not like it or not. I wanted a simple recipe. This recipe fit the bill perfectly, and it tasted really good too.
Way to go Surja! We will be making this again. Only changes will be halving the sugar in half and greatly increasing the dried cranberries. 
Very easy and quick to make. Make sure the Kale is dried off very well.

Great recipe. I cut the sugar as others suggested, and knew there was NO hope for hubby to like it if I added the cranberries and nuts, so left them out. Turned out GREAT anyway!

Wow! I've never made Kale before and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this recipe was.  I searched the internet for a recipe for Kale and this one appealed to me the most.  I did not have dried cranberries and almonds so I left them out and it tasted just fine without them. Thanks for a great recipe and I'll  definitely make it again.

I totally messed with this recipe, but have to say that the essential greens/dried fruit combo was even better than I had hoped. We didn't have enough kale, so used half kale and half mustard greens, raisins instead of cranberries, and we forgot(!) the sugar but the final dish didn't seem to care.

I don't understand, though, how to boil down the 1 1/2 cup chicken stock without overcooking the greens--we ended up removing the greens and cooking down the broth separately. Still, very tasty!

We had this recipe for dinner tonight. It was excellent. I couldn't find the dijon mustard so I used whatever mustard I could find and it was still good. It was more sweet than savory but that was probably due to the honey mustard I had to use. We had it with a small amount of thinly sliced steak on top, but it would have been enough without the meat. 

This recipe probably would not be for someone who gets grossed out by wilted greens, but kale remains quite crunchy even when wilted so we found it very satisfying. The cranberries and almonds really add to it. I think the only way you could mess this up would be if you cooked the kale too long.

I have never eaten kale in my life, but am making an honest effort to put more leafy greens into my diet.  I can see where it may be too sweet for some and it wouldn't hurt to cut out a bit of sugar, but I liked it the way it was too.  I added a little bit of chopped ham to make it a one dish meal and I was very impressed.

Needed something to do with the Kale from my CSA that wasn't a soup.  I've never had Kale before.  This was very good.  Next time I'll go lighter on the mustard.  Once it cooks down, I'd say it's closer to enough for 2 large side portions vs the 6 mentioned in the recipe (like spinach, it really cooks down!).  We'll make it again.

Being southern I love all the leafy green vegetables - my Yankee husband is not accustomed to them - so when he loved this dish I was thrilled. I didn't have enough dried cranberries, so I added a few raisins - other than that I made the recipe just as it was written. I will definitely make it again.

This dish was quite nice.  I didn't realize till I got in that I didn't have any Dijon mustard.  I added mustard seeds and french's instead.  I only added about 2 tsbp of sugar, and personally I thought that was plenty.  Next time I'll try it with real Dijon and add less sugar.  Oh, and I added pinenuts instead of almonds.    Thanks for the great recipe.

Hands down the most delicious kale recipe EVER!!! However, would just like to note that the olive oil is completely unnecessary- Bring the chicken broth to a boil then throw in the chopped onions- they will cook while it boils, no need to cook separately in oil. Then mix in the other ingredients. I substitute stevia for the sugar to save on calories too. When you cut out the olive oil and sugar this brings this recipe down to about 80 calories per serving!

I was worried about the sweetness, so I only put two tsp of sugar in. I'm glad I didn't put in any more, because we thought it was pretty good the way it was. Next time I think I'll skip the sugar completely until I taste the cooked greens.  I used kohlrabi greens because that's what I had and because I thought their faint cabbagy-ness would be good with the sweet/tangy thing. And they were. The sweet/tangy ingredients completely overpowered the greens, though. This dish doesn't taste like greens at all, really.  For us, that was a good thing, as we are completely overcome by various sorts of greens from the CSA right now. But for folks who are looking for greens flavor, this is not it at all.  This would be a very gentle introduction to greens for someone who is worried about the nasty olive-drab thing and noxious fumes you get from overcooked greens. It kind of reminds me of thanksgiving with the cranberry flavor.  All in all, my changes would be to skip the sugar and toss the greens in AFTER you get the sauce reduced so you can cook the greens just long enough to wilt them. I prefer my greens just-cooked rather than cooked-til-dead. Other than that, this is a very good recipe.

Very good recipe.  I actually cooked the kale for about 15 minutes longer than what the recipe stated making it less chewy and more "mushy."  But that's just my taste.  I also subbed pecans for almonds.  Thanks for this easy, tasty recipe.  Now I can get my family to eat more greens.

This recipe is fine if you don't want to taste kale. Even if you quadruple the amount of kale, the vinegar and mustard taste just over powers the flavor of everything else. 1.5 cups of chicken broth is way too much liquid to reduced down.

very nutritious and satisfying! I used half the sugar as most have suggested and added another clove of garlic. This recipe will take care of an entire bag of kale on your hands! If you add some sort of bean and serve over rice it can easily become a main dish. Thanks for sharing!

Let me just say, made as written, and this recipe is THE BOMB! I have never had kale before and this dish will be making a repeat appearance at my table. Wow. I scaled it down to serve 4 people and found it was really only enough for two, so I will bear that in mind for next time, increasing the scale to 8 to serve my family of 4. I had to laugh tho; hubs, who isn't a veggie fan, period, complained after supper that he 'must be allergic to that new vegetable' because he really wasn't feeling well. LOL I wasn't falling for that.....and I'm still laughing.....

The basic recipe is good, especially for folks who find the kale flavor too strong for their taste.  I cut the sugar in half and still found it too sweet.  I also felt the mustard was overwhelming--next time I will cut it in half too.
I always throw the stems in with onions and garlic to saute them and then let them cook until they are soft.

Wow! This was really good. I'm a Yankee living here in the South and I'm not too crazy about a lot of Southern food. But I do love kale. I usually add some to my salad from the salad bar at Whole Food's. I finally broke down and bought some but wasn't sure what to do with it. I made the recipe exactly and it was delicious. Thank you!

This was my first time making Kale.  I did lower the sugar and left out the almonds (b/c I didn't have any).  I used frozen diced onion and minced garlic. I though it was pretty good.  I probably would not have given it 5 stars (probably 4) except for the fact that my 2 yr old and 5 yr old ATE IT.  My 5 yr old even asked for more.  I almost fell over.  If toddlers eat this, it's a winner.

I used vegetable broth and it came out delicious! Because kale is tough make sure you strip it from the stem. Also, I took my good scissors to it after it was cooked.  I suggest doing this before cooking.

After battling cancer this year, I have had to change the way I eat. I had never tried kale until this recipe. Like the others I reduced the sugar and left out the cranberries. Tastes great! I will be making again. There are so many other nuts and fruit you could use to jazz it up!

What a mediocre recipe!  First off, it makes 6 servings?  This makes enough for 2 servings of about half a cup.  Yes...kale wilts down a lot folks.  Also, the ingredients just seemed thrown together.  Cranberries were odd, though not exactly awful, and the almonds added nothing.  This is closer to a forty minute dish.  There are simply better kale recipes out there that are just as easy.  I won't make this again, and don't recommend it.

I made this recipe with beautiful late harvest organically grown kale.  The marriage of mustard, broth, and cider vinegar is inspired and the dried cranberries and nuts further elevate this succulent side dish.  I could eat this often.  This is an ace recipe!

I've tried many recipes for Kale and this is my favorite.  Reminds me of a sweet and sour cabbage my mother made that was her signature recipe.

Great tasting and easy. Will do what some suggested next time and cut the sugar in half, no need for that much as the dried cranberries have sugar in them. Will make this again.

I didn't have dried cranberries OR almonds on hand, but I followed the directions otherwise and it turned out delicious. I did, however, reduce the sugar to 3 tsp since others mentioned 4 was too much, and I think it worked well.  I'm glad I read the reviews and knew to expect that the kale would retain some stiffness rather than wilting down to mush like spinach. I think I would have been worried that it hadn't cooked sufficiently.

WHOA! This was seriously sweet! I scaled it back to 3 servings & didn't think the amount of sugar called for was excessive but my dried cranberries added quite a bit of sweetness along with cooking down the cider vinegar which added another level of sweetness that wasn't needed at all.  I actually think one could skip the sugar altogether. Thanks, though. :o)

Does not need the sugar at all!  Used spicy brown mustard + some powdered mustard, is great.  Eating it again now, the leftovers are very tasty too on the second day.

WOW!!! I was totally blown away by this recipe. For once in my life I had all the ingredients, so I followed this to the letter and it was sooooo good. It transformed my wilty, questionable kale into a tasty, hearty dish that my meat-loving husband and I really enjoyed. I served it with quinoa.  YUM!

Ohmigosh! This is soooo good! DH rarely compliments a side dish, but this one earned approval reserved for Thanksgiving sides. Even my baby, who usually hates the texture of cooked greens, gobbled this up.

Absolutely loved it! Followed it to a T & was perfect. Next time I will use 1 less tsp of sugar. That's bc it was a tad too sweet for me however my husband loved it! Best kale recipe. Didn't need to substitute or change like some of other recipes. Def 5 stars!!

I agree with Heidi....I got only 1 serving out of this as well.   It was the most salty/sweet combo type of food I've ever eaten, even though I never got around to adding salt or pepper.  It was also very chewy.... like to the point of "beef".  I didn't like that part of it... It made me feel like I was eating tough weeds.  I actually liked the flavor of it while eating it but I like extremely salty foods.  The sweetness cut it just the right amount.  I give it 2 stars because I'd like to try it again but will have to tweak it quite a bit.  I think the "4 cups" of Kale was a typo..... maybe it should have been 14 cups or 4 quarts of Kale.  I have know idea how one could get 6 servings out of this unless you consider "2 tablespoons" a complete serving.  Really disappointed.

This is an awesome recipe. It tastes delicious and it's so easy and quick to make. I had a huge bag of Kale (prewashed and chopped) in my fridge and wanted to use it. This recipe was perfect. I ate this dish for dinner just by itself. I followed the recommendation of other reviewers and only used 2 tsp of sugar. Maybe one would be enough too, because the cranberries add sweetness. Thank you so much for sharing this.

I loved this, I took others advice and only used 1 cup of broth and did not add any sugar, it was sweet enough. I've made it 3 times and used dried cranberries, tart cherries, and prunes, so any dried fruit will work. Also, there is no way this makes 6 servings, more like 3 small or 2 large.

We loved it!!  I never made kale before but my daughter brought some home and I found this recipe.  My daughter is running out for more because she and I ate almost the whole thing before dinner.  Didn't have cranberries and substituted pecans!!

yum yum! I made this with curried quinoa and apple marsala pork chops. The mustard flavor comes through so be careful not to overdo it - or the vinegar for that matter. I cut the cooking time way back too - it would have been mush after 20 minutes of boiling! The cranberries and almonds made it really unique - dont leave them off!

very good recipe, maybe a tad on the too sweet side.  Kids liked the flavor but the dark green color was very unappealing. Too bad the kale is too tough still when it turns that beautiful emerald color briefly before turning an  ugly dark green.

What a great reduction/sauce this is...  Next time I make it, I will probably add more than 4 cups of ripped kale, mine reduced down quite a bit.    I did also add Butterbeans to this during the last 5 minutes of cooking, just enough to heat them through, they were delicious and gave the dish a little more substance.

Excellent, even for people who don't necessarily like kale.  Definitely cut back on the sugar (I used 1tsp).  I also eliminated the first 5 minutes of kale cooking, as I prefer my kale less done.  Also, it's fabulous if you substitute for cranberries the Super Cranberry & Pomegranate Blend from Trader Joe's.  The whole family liked it, including our 8yo daughter!

It is really sweet -- I only added a teaspoon and a half after reading the other reviews, and it was still too sweet.  If you like the taste of kale/greens, then this is not the recipe for you.  On the other hand, if you are trying to mask the flavor of kale for people who don't like greens, this would be a good recipe.

This was excellent!  Followed the recipe except decreased the sugar by half.  The cranberries add plenty of sweetness. No other changes are needed. Update: next time reduce sugar to 1tsp.

I am delighted to say my first experience with kale was a good one!  I made this as written and did not find it too sweet at all.  The almonds add a nice crunch to the kale, which is kind of chewy.  This is delicious and I was sad when it was gone!

I thought this was good - my husband really liked it. I toasted the almonds lightly (in a dry pan) before adding - but didn't find that they added much to the flavour, so if you don't have any on hand for the garmish, the recipe is still great.

Love this recipe! I have made it multiple times, but with some modifications. I use spicy mustard instead of dijon, red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar, and 1/4 cup of preserves (usually strawberry or raspberry) instead of dried cranberries. I also usually leave out the almonds unless I have them around. It is a hit every time!

Made this recipe last night and it was a hit.  Kale is something we are adding to our diet since it is such a healthy vegetable.  Followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I were very pleased.  Delicious and easy to prepare

This is very flavorful and tasty! I didn't have dijon so I used yellow mustard and used walnuts instead of almonds. Delish!

I hate hate hate kale.  I only eat it because I know its good for me.  HOWEVER... this recipe has given me a different opinion on this nasty, curley leaf.  I think I may have started to appreciate it.  Well done.  Good recipe.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I followed the recipe closely, even using more kale than called for. With the temperatures and times called for, it was reduced to about a cup and a half of green mush in the bottom of the pot.  I won't try it again--certainly not in accordance with this recipe.

Kale is a superfood* but most nutrients are destroyed in this cooking method. "Healthy steam" the Kale and add at the very end. It turns out chewier but if you're going to eat it, you might as well get the most out of it. *Kale is one of the healthiest vegetables around and one way to be sure to enjoy the maximum nutrition and flavor from kale is to cook it properly. It's recommended to Healthy Steam kale for 5 minutes. To ensure quick and even cooking cut the leaves into 1/2" slices and the stems into 1/4" lengths. Let them sit for at least 5 minutes to enhance their health-promoting qualities before steaming.

I made the full recipe, strained most of the remaining liquid and divided it into thirds to eat as 3 lunches instead of a side. Used all measurements exactly.  Definitely enough Craisins. Used the following subs for health or convenience: low sodium chicken broth, white vinegar, 50% less sugar Craisins.  I only added almonds just before eating (2 Tbsp).  Followed cooking directions exactly.  The vinegar could be slightly less. This was a great way to get kale into my diet and it fills you up.  Accompanied it with a slice of wheat toast.  I'm watching calories via MyFitnessPal, so divided into thirds with all substitutions, it's about 230 calories and 288 with a slice of bread.

Not bad!  This was my first time eating kale and I'd be willing to make it again.  I'm not a veggie lover, so the fact that I couldn't taste the kale was key.

Good, but too sweet. Next time will leave out the sugar and add chopped kalamata olives to make it a bit more savory. We also added some leftover cooked rice to soak up the extra juice. This made a great side dish.

I liked this recipe a lot, thank you! 4 cups of kale once slighted steamed though, turns out to be just a few bites worth.. certainly not enough kale vs everything else in the recipe! I used the whole bunch of kale, and it worked out well. I also didn't need to cook this as long to get the liquid to reduce, and I used vegetable broth. I think the type of broth you use will have a lot to do with the success of the recipe, because the broth flavor shined through a lot! 

Not awesome to just eat a bowl of on it's own, but great as a side with a home-style meal. I'll make this again!

Absolutely the best Kale recipe I've ever tried, and I've tried a lot of ways to eat this super green since it's packed with nutrients. I have to say savory is the perfect word to use for the finished dish. My husband and I enjoyed this so much we're going to make it again tonight! The only changes I made were using spicy brown mustard instead of dijon (b/c we didnt have any dijon) and no almonds, other than that it was great!

This is the first highly rated recipe I've tried that didn't really measure up for me.  I followed the recipe exactly except I halved the sugar as others suggested, and it was still too sweet.  I'll try another recipe next time.

The flavor is great without the added sugar. The dried cranberries (or craisins) add lots of sweetness. I also substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth. Balances really well with rice and beans.

Delicious!  I did not add any sugar or cranberries because I am following an clean eating diet plan.  Guess what??  It had a sweet flavor without them!  I also used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon.  Maybe it was that or the apple cider that sweetened it??  Either way, this is going into my veggie rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

I have only ever had Kale once and it was so so, But wanted to find ways to cook it that were tasty as it is so good for you.  This recipe ROCKS.  Thanks!

This is a delicious recipe!  I cut the sugar down to only 2 teaspoons, and it was still very sweet.  If you have good ingredients (and especially if your cranberries are slightly sweetened), I think this would be better without any sugar!!

If you actually enjoy eating kale, this is probably not the recipe for you.  The cooking process gets rid of its naturally "healthy" bite in deference to the other sweet/sour flavors.  As a lover of kale, I have to say this was a no go for me--although kale haters with certain taste might think it's OK.

I made this almost doubling the kale and used 3tsps of sugar.  I slightly increased all the other ingredients to adjust for the added kale.  When I first tasted it, I thought it was great, but after eating a portion of it, I felt kind of sick from the sweetness.  Which is strange since I have such a sweet tooth, I thought it would be perfect for me.  The next day it was not good at all.  the sweetness had intensified and I couldn't eat it.  I will try making it again maybe cutting out the sugar all together, and reducing the cranberries.  My husband thought it was much too sweet as well.

I'm not a fan of kale, but my 19 yo made this for dinner one night (leaving out the cranberries, almonds and onions due to allergies) and I loved it.  Not only did I love it, but I had thirds and four of my other daughters (ages 10, 9, 7 and 4) also had seconds and thirds!  This one is a keeper.

I liked the combination of almonds with kale, but I found the overall recipe too sweet for my tastes.  The leftovers on day 2 were better since the flavors had a chance to mellow out a bit.

A little too sweet for me, and too juicy, but that might have been because of hsie I made it: I didn't have the exact ingredients called for a few times,  and just made do. If there were going to be a next time, I might cut the sugar entirely. I was skeptical of the value of using golden over dark raisins, but I must admit, they were a nice touch. A lot of different consistancies going on.

This was a very tasty recipe, and the combination of sweet and sour was perfect.  Be sure to cook it long enough, as it will be "chewy" if you don't.  My husband didn't like it, but he is notoriously picky.  I think spinich would be better, but kale is really good for you.  Bacon would add extra flavor, but also extry calories and fat.

This was very good.  It was the first time I have ever tried to cook kale.  Got a bunch at the farmers market and this is what we did to it.  My only variation from the recipe was to leave out the almonds (hubby doesn't like them).  Even my 9 yo liked it.

I'm a huge lover of kale to begin with, but I think I would have devoured this even if I'd had it back when I hated all veggies.  This dish is divine, and I can't wait to make it for a dear friend who is a majorly picky eater: I bet she snarfs it down happily! :)

My husband and I enjoyed this, my kids not so much, but it was the first time I ever made kale so it could just be they weren't used to it.  I used water instead of broth, both to make it vegetarian and eliminate the sodium.  Used 3 tsp of sugar, and added some golden raisins in with the cranberries.  I also used 1/2 cup of almond to give it more crunch.  I used this as a main dish, adding some whole grain rolls to go with it.  I found that I didn't need to add any salt or pepper-there's enough flavor for the dish to hold it's own.  Thanks!

My husband and daughter (and me) actually had seconds of this dish.  I made it almost exactly as written - only change I made was to add only about a cup of chicken broth.  I'm actually glad of that because the only reason I didn't give the recipe 5 stars was that it was still a little soupy.  But the taste was great and it made kale (a veggie I consider NOT likeable) actually good!

Very, very delicious! Since kale is so healthy and good for you, I'm always trying new different ways to make it and this dish is really great. I followed the recipe exactly as is, just forgot to add the almonds at the end. Served with grilled salmon and roasted sweet potatoes.

I've really learned to love Kale by way of receiving it every week through my CSA (Community Supported Agriculture).  This is by far my favorite preparation of Kale.  I shared this recipe with a friend and she used regular mustard and says Dijon is a must.

This kale recipe is wonderful!  I would recommend cutting the sugar at least in 1/2.  Prepared with 1/2 it is still plenty sweet.  Also, doubling the recipe if you are feeding more than 3 people would be good.  kale cooks down and this stuff goes fast!

This is a really good Kale recipe. I made it for a pot luck dinner last night and everyone enjoyed it. I halved the sugar as suggested and used dried Tart Cherries instead of the cranberries as that is all I had. I also added a bit extra kale as I wanted to finish off the bunch that I bought. Definitely a hit and super easy to make.

This was quite a unique dish but my wife and I weren't "gaga" over it. I thought the apple cider vinegar taste was a bit too pronounced but my wife disagreed. Although it was pretty easy to fix, I'm not sure we'll try it again.

The only change I made was 2 tsp. sugar. The next time, no sugar or a little diabetic sugar instead. My husband and I are Diabetic and I am always looking for fresh kale recipes. This is wonderful as written except for the sweetness. Cranberries tho tart are still sweet. This is now one of our favorite kale recipes even reheated next day. Must be the vinegar passion.

Nice way to prepare kale.  I liked it a lot, my husband thought it a bit too sweet so I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.

Good recipe, but...this was my first time trying kale, and guess I'm just not a big fan! Kind of a stringy texture and an almost bitter flavor. Plus it was very time-consuming to stem all the kale leaves. But if you have some kale on hand, I'd recommend this recipe.

Excellent!  Changes I made include:  no sugar, using spicy brown mustard and cooking kale for only half the amount of recommended time.  (I like my kale a little crunchy.)  I would definitely make this recipe again.

This was good. I subbed agave for sugar, used veg broth, and skipped the step of simmering the kale covered for 5 min (I prefer mine less cooked). I liked the sweet/tangy combination. I'm pretty sure this recipe originally called for 4T of sugar, which is probably why early reviews say the dish is too sweet. I found it just right (and I don't like overly sweet foods).

I liked this recipe even though it was really sweet (I even halfed the sugar). Unfortunately, none of my kids or husband liked it. They don't like sweet veggies. I also thought the Kale was cooked too long. All the vitamins went away into the broth.

I doubled the recipe and used approximately 2 tablespoons of honey instead of sugar.  It was delicious as is for a regular family dinner, but I would use the almonds and cranberries to make it prettier for company.

This was delicious. I used shallots because that is what I had on hand, and I did not use almonds or cranberries.  In the future I would use a little less sugar (probably about 2 teaspoons)  but overall, this was a good recipe. My fiance doesn't really like Kale and he enjoyed this. Thanks!

I thought this was delicious, but with my experience cooking Kale I did add a couple of things, and I changed the chicken stock to vegetable stock for a vegetarian dish. I added some red chili flakes to the onion and garlic, and then grated fresh nutmeg after adding the Kale.  I think Kale always needs some citrus, so I squeezed fresh orange juice at the end. I'll definitely make this again!

it smelt amazing but could only last through 4 bites. Its super salty from the chicken broth so I recommend using one without a lot of salt and add your own seasoning to improve it.

Great easy recipe for combing savory and sweet.  Increased kale, also added some spinach because it was in the fride.  Used a mix of dried cranberries, cherries and topped with fresh pom seeds.  Delious!

I loved the taste of this delicious side dish, but instead of ending up with 6 servings, we had about 4 appetizer size (read: tablespoon or so each) servings.  I followed the recipe exactly, but those 4 cups of kale wilted away to nothing.

Awesome!  We are not big kale eaters, but it comes in our produce co-op fairly frequently, and this is our go-to recipe to make it chow down-able!  It's delicious as written.  I tweak a few amounts to make it easier to remember: 1 T sugar (so it's 1T of each), 1 can of chicken broth (about 1 3/4 cups), and I also double or triple the garlic according to the conventional wisdom of a wise Italian woman I know. :)  Thanks for transforming kale for us!!

Yes - I cut the sugar to 3 Tbsp. and added a handful of bacon bits (Hormel) - gave it a more home style flair!

The tart and sweetness are perfect to offset a more savory dish.  I substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth to make it a vegetarian option!

This recipe is to die for. First time my husband ever had kale in his life and absolutely LOVED THIS! I used a Honey & Balsamic dijon mustard for a slight kick in taste. Here is where this took 1st place.... I added red, yellow and orange peppers after I sauteed them for a bit and added so much flavor and made it look beautiful to serve! This is one of my favorite recipes on here! A MUST TRY!!!

The sauce the kale cooks in is outstanding! This is the first time I have eaten kale & I hated it. It is very, very tough. I will be making this again, but substituting spinach for the kale.

I just made this last night and really, really liked it. I didn't use the craisins or almonds and used less sugar than suggested to avoid it being too sweet. I found that you have to cook it longer than suggested for the kale to wilt. We enjoyed it. Thanks!

Yum. Usually my family of 5, with very different tastes will offer up complains at every meal and only compliment when prompted. This kale dish served over brown rice and lentils was a hit! 
I cut the sugar in half which will be replaced by a healthier alternative next time and used vegetable broth and a bit of fresh grated nutmeg.
Delicious. This recipe replaces my favorite kale dish.

My husband's mother wasn't a gifted cook and so he grew up hating anything green on his plate.  I fixed this recipe for him tonight. "Hmmm...that's quite tasty.  Feed me more like that and I'll get to liking greens."  Served with pork chops and quinoa, this made a delicious, nutrient-dense dinner.  I, too, substituted the sugar with honey.

Delicious! My only problems were that it was too sweet and too soupy. Made it again with just the sugar on the cranberries and 1 t added sugar and about 1/3 cup broth and simmered it covered and I liked it much better. Keeper!

I'm from Louisiana so I am accustomed to eating "greens". We usually eat collard or mustard greens but this was my first time cooking kale in this manor. The vinegar is a must! I cooked mine about 30 minutes because I prefer a very tender green. I will definitely try this again!

I really liked this recipe!  I, too made some changes- reduced the sugar to 1 tsp (I may leave it out next time- don't think it really even needed it), left out the onion b/c I didn't have any and added extra garlic.  I also followed another reviewers recommendation and reduced the liquid before adding the kale so it wasn't too mushy.  I gave it 4 stars because of all the tweaking, but I did like it very much.

I had never cooked kale before but wanted something that would go together with my chicken breasts that were sautéed in marsala wine and on the sweet side. This kale recipe was amazing and very unusual. My family all agreed it was v good and I will make it again

I followed this to a t and came up with one serving, not six. I have a family to feed here. Delicious and nutritious and all, but not satisfying when you have more then one mouth to feed. Or even two for that matter. 4 stars. Lost half a stat for that.

Great alternative to caldo verde. I saw on PBS that kale has more micronutrients than any other vegetable; so we need more of these tasty recipes using kale. I used 2 tsp of honey in place of the sugar and also used 1/3 cup dried cranberries. My cooking times were about half as long as in the recipe; I judged based on the colour of the onions and the amount of liquid reduction. To me, the cider vinegar is the key ingredient that should not be substituted; it adds the right combination of tanginess and sweetness. I also think adding a touch of heat, like chili flakes, would make it even better.

Very good and very healthy! We used fresh Kale from the garden and made just a few changes. We used organic fructose instead of sugar (it's better for you) and cut the measurement in half. Also, the we didn't have almonds on hand but it tasted fantastic anyways!

Incredible.  Even the 11 year old wanted seconds.  I doubled the recipe and it all was eaten!  The only thing I changed was adding capers and not putting almonds (didn't have any).  YUM.

This was excellent! I whipped it up really quick and the flavor was fantastic. The ingredients in here are packed with nutrients and it is so colorful on the plate as well. This may become a weekly staple.

This is SO delicious!! My husband is not a big fan of vegetables, but he asked for seconds of this. It is the perfect combination of sweet and savory, and, BONUS - you are getting the benefits of kale.

I recently bought some kale for the first time and was looking for a way to prepare it and this recipe stood out and I'm so glad it did! This recipe is super easy, not too time consuming, and super tasty. My husband, who really isn't one for vegetables, and I both just loved it and Kale is now going to be a regular part of my weekly shopping trip.

I made this exactly according to directions, except I cut down on the sugar just a bit.  I used fresh young kale straight out of my garden.  My husband and I both really liked it and I'm planning to make it again.

This recipe was a real surprise! My kale had been in the fridg a little longer than I would have liked, but it wasn't bitter at all. The sweet from the sugar and cranberries and the counterpoint of the vinegar are wonderful! This is a real keeper!

This was very good - I didn't add the nuts because I thought it would be too much but next time I might try some of them toasted. Maybe even pine nuts instead of almonds would be good. I also think this would be great with golden raisins instead of craisins. I used half the sugar and it was still too sweet so I will reduce it next time.

MY FAVORITE KALE RECIPE! I was never thrilled to make kale but still served it for its nutritional value. After trying this recipe, I'm glad to say that I will serve kale more often. Served it with "Exchange Gang Pasta with Shrimp."

Great recipe! I used 6 cloves of roasted garlic instead of sauteing fresh cloves & it turned out really nice - perhaps reduce the amount of white sugar by 25%.

My husband always buys the greens because I just do not care for them. I found some as usual in the bottom of the fridge waiting to rot and saved them with this recipe. Fantastic joined All Recipes so I could thank you for my first plesant experience with greens.

Very good! I've never particularly liked kale, but I try to eat it because it's so healthy. I actually really enjoyed this, though it was a little bit sweet. I think next time I will reduce or maybe leave out the sugar.

I have not been crazy about kale in the past but I am trying to get more variety with greens in my diet. This recipe was terrific - there was none if the usual bitter taste to it. 

I used regular vinegar since we didnt have cider and I left out the almonds (allergies). I didnt cook it as long as the recipe called for because I didnt think it needed it. Next time I will add more kale as it shrunk so much, the recipe was almost half onion and a bit too soupy. You can easily reduce or cut out the sugar also - it is very sweet!

This was my first experience with kale.  This has a nice flavor, sweet but not too sweet.  It does not, however, reheat well.  Enjoy it immediately!

My family isn't crazy about kale, but loved the flavor of the dish.  My husband suggested adding some cooked/diced chicken at the same time as you add the cranberries.  It turned it from a side dish to a main course and was really well received!

Delicious! I added a bit more mustard, 1/3 cup pre-sweetened dried cranberries and no sugar. Kale has just become standard fare in my diet.

Cranberries are a great item to pair with kale. I tossed in a chopped portabello, which added a different texture and flavor. I think you can use less liquid and definitely less sugar.

I have never cooked kale but it was in my CSA box so I gave it a try.  I changed the recipe slightly by taking a tip from another reviewer and using 2TBLS honey instead of sugar.  The recipe was an excellent side dish that I would make again.

This recipe did nothing for me. I love the taste of kale but with this recipe I could not taste the kale only the cider vinegar. I made it just like the recipe and will not try this one again.
