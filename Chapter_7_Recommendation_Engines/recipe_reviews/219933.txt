Saved the best for last. Just when I thought I was not going to find a popper recipe that sounded right....i got to the last one. And just in time for Superbowl!! Love the crunch of the corn and the mix of cream and cheddar cheese. Love them bacon wrapped and grilled rather than breaded. Worked great in the oven!! Made a test batch today, don't want to mess up the Superbowl snacks ;) Thanks for the recipe!

I make this recipe all the time without corn BUT I roll the bacon wrapped jalapeno in a mixture of brown sugar and chili powder! Absolutely love them and so do all my friends and family! My mother requests them every time I come home to visit and so does my mother in law! I don't go to a party where I don't get asked for the recipe!  Just put more chili powder in if you want them spicier, or more brown sugar if you like them sweet!  The husband likes them really spicy so for him I put alittle cayenne powder and chili powder in the cream cheese mixture!

Loved the corn added to the mixture for this popper.  It gave the popper more substance and they were very filling.  I used jalapeños and mini red, yellow and orange peppers for the people who couldn't take the heat from the jalapeños.  Both types were very well received.  I made as written and used turkey bacon to help cut calories.  This will be made often this summer as grilling season starts.  Thanks Bennyh614 for sharing your recipe.

I love making these, but I like to drop the heat and cook longer. I go about 325-340 for about 40 minutes. Bacon renders nicely and the peppers get a nice roasted quality to them. Plus, you can take that bacon grease and make the best hashbrowns and eggs the next morning :D

When using a bacon-wrapped recipe, I always half-fry the bacon before wrapping - it guarantees crisp results.  Excellent recipe along-side rumaki.

I made these without the corn.  My husband made fun of me for making about 50 of them, said there was no way our little crowd would eat that many.  Well guess what, everyone loved them and they were gone in no time flat!  They are simple, but time consuming to make, but maybe if you're not making 50, it wouldn't take that long... Will be making these again. Make sure to give them enough time in the over/grill for the bacon to crisp up a little.

Awesome recipe.  Added chives and chopped bacon and added to cheese mix as opposed to wrapping pepper with it.  Baked at 400 degrees for 20 min.  Deeeelicious!

Terrific recipe, Bennyh.  The addition of the crisp/fresh corn kernels made the recipe exceptional.  If I have particularly hot-smelling jalapenos, I de-seed them under running water, to help with the side effects of taking the seeds out.  Since I opted for baking these in the oven, I followed another reviewer's advice and used the fried-up bacon bits in the filling.  I couldn't think of a way to hold the poppers up off of the baking sheet so they wouldn't be swallowed up by the fat from the bacon. I took another's advice and added chives. Since I added the bacon bits and chives to the filling, there was filling left over.  We found this filling made a very tasty dip on crackers.  It would probably make a nice cheese ball too.  I can't emphasize enough what the fresh corn added to this recipe (texture and taste).

These are to die for!  Made them for a 4th of July party, and they were gone in no time...  I used red sweet peppers that were the same size as jalapenos and baked them (broiled at the end) in the oven.  I will file this recipe away for sure.

I didn't have bacon or corn but I did sprinkle real bacon bits on top and they came out uber delicious! Mine were done in 15 minutes in the oven at 400 degrees. Very easy to make!

We made these last night & they were yummy, but completely mild (my 10yo liked them & she doesn’t like too spicy)!  
Here are some suggestions…

…To the cheese mixture, add:
Add 1 clove minced garlic (or garlic powder)
Add minced chives or onion
Add 1-2 dashed cayenne pepper (or creole seasoning) - a little flavor boost, but not a lot of heat.
For more heat, add some of the seeds to the cheese mixture.

…Sauté the bacon to get the cooking started or you’ll have a hard time getting it cooked enough on the grill.  (We started on the grill, but had to finish in the oven – the peppers we done, but bacon undercooked)

…Also season the wrapped poppers with pepper before grilling.

Hope these tips help!

These were really good.  The only thing that was kind of annoying was that the cheese melted out of the jalapenos and made a huge mess on the grill.  So maybe next time I would arrange them differently so the cheese was more "sealed in".

These were awesome!! I took the advice to pre-cook the bacon half way and assembled them ahead of time.  They were a big hit and I will definitely make again!

10.12.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/219933/bennys-famous-jalapeno-poppers/ ... I prefer cream cheese to cheddar poppers so just doubled the cream cheese amount. 'Skipped the corn.  Also, baked the bacon; then crumbled. Put a little panko on then baked the poppers.  Pushed the bacon pieces on top.  I liked 'em.  'Think I'll whip the cream cheese next time or somehow lighten the texture.  Some that had more were too cream-cheesy.  (I got over it :D)

Tried these today for a football game. These were great and not really spicy. I will definitely be making these again.  I left out the corn because I didn't have any. They cooked fine in the oven at 400 for about 20 min. I also added chopped fresh chives that I had on hand to the cheese mixture. Thanks for the recipe

5 stars all the way! We did these on the charcoal grill and they came out incredible. I was worried that the filling would fall out but it wasn't a problem. I was excited about the corn because I'm big on different textures in my food, but I hardly noticed it. You could probably leave the corn out and it would be just as great. Excellent recipe; we'll be making these again soon!

I make poppers all the time but always use pickled peppers instead of fresh peppers. I like the addition of the corn. My brother will add crushed peanuts to the cream cheese mixture - not my fave, but it is good.

Have a similar recipe to this one I've been using for years. The only difference in mine is we cut cubes of different cheeses (pepper jack and sharp cheddar were always the predominant favorites) and when we grilled them, we also coated them with barbeque sauce...never fails to be a crowd pleaser though!

I would add to this recipe the steps to cleaning the peppers and what NOT to touch after you've de-seeded them.  I made the mistake of touching of lips and ouch that's a burning sensation I've not felt since getting jelly fish in a cut out fishing!

Great recipe. Like the combo of cheddar and cream cheesse.  Will try pepper jack cheese next.  I usually make the Williams-Sonoma recipe and this one meets the mark ! I freeze my peppers from the summer and hollow them out in advancem,  stuff and grill.  Delish.

Easy fun and very delicious! I would advise wearing disposable gloves when working with the fresh jalapeños. I did not know this before LOL. Won’t make that mistake twice.

This is a good recipe, I love the addition of the corn to the filling! But I like to spice up the cheese filling just a bit with some smoked paprika, garlic powder, and a bit of grated parmesan cheese.

My hubby's work group loved the last batch I made ( I haven't tried making it with the corn yet) and there were NONE left over!!  I haven't been able to do them on the grill yet but this time around I put them on a normal roasting pan and a "roasting pan" we fashioned out of a lined cookie sheet and lined wooden skewers (which operated as slats to keep the jalapeños out of the grease).  This time around I accidentally miscounted on the bacon and didn't have enough slices so we dredged the tops of the remaining filled jalapeños in crushed Fritos.  Will let you know how that comes out! :) a few things that helped this time around were:

Used Philadelphia Chipotle cream cheese mixed with equal parts sharp cheddar pub style spread. Also added a few dashes of cumin. These things were wonderful.

These were the first poppers I've made like this, and they were a big hit!  I only had one cob of corn that came to 4 oz, so I added a little Parmesan cheese (an idea from another recipe).  I also baked these in the oven because I didn't have the time to watch them on the grill outside.  They are very delicious--and quite mild, all things considered!  I loved the idea of the corn!  I informed my guests that these were our veggies for the night (besides the salad I served), and they were totally happy with that!  Thanks for the recipe, Benny!  I'll be making these again!

Made these without corn and they were delicious baked in the oven.  Everyone loved them and there were none leftover.

Remember to turn the ceiling fan off while you are cleaning the Jalapeno's :{}

We used both Cheddar cheese, on some and Pepper-Jack cheese on others, (to give it an extra kick)!

These were delicious! It's winter and snowing so I hit them on a fry pan first then finished them in the oven instead of using the grill. Realized I didn't have corn so I left that out but they were still very tasty! I will definitely add this to one of my favorites!

My Family LOVES these things!! I also tried a different "TWIST" by using the Little Smokies vs the Cream Cheese mixture & wrapped those in bacon. Baked in the oven @ 400 for about 15-20 min. instead of grilling!! Man Oh Man were they ever delicious!!

The filling is very good, but made on the grill and it was not that good. Next time, I would either bake it in the oven or just omit the bacon.

These poppers are the best! Pretty sure it's the fresh corn added to cheese mixture. I've made these before w/ no issues, but this time had issue with bacon not crisping----maybe my oven? (Next time I'll try pre-frying bacon half-way as suggested by another reviewer.) So, took a bit longer but still awesome! Great Super Bowl appetizer.

So yummy. Had grilled fresh corn night before and used one whole cobb of cut corn; abt 3/4 cup. Took a few while still warm to a couple of friends and they to loved them. Took time to seed but worth it. Our jalapenos were fresh from the garden and 2-3 inches long.  My daughter puts sausage in hers so will try that next time. A winner for me and my husband.

Really Good! My tweeks: I added some cayenne, a little hot sauce and cumin. I had pre-cooked bacon so I cooked the Jalapenos for about 10 minutes on 425 and let cool, then stuffed with cheese mixture, wrapped with baconnd cooked for another 15 mins on 425. YUMMMMMYYYY!

making it kosher style use scrambled eggs instead of cheese (we do not mix meat and cheese together in any recipe) and use salami strips or pastrami strips instead of bacon (bacon is non kosher).

These are sooo good. I prefer them baked to avoid grill flavor & cheese spilling everywhere. 420 degrees for roughly 40 mins (or until bacon is cooked to liking) in the middle rack usually does the trick. Or to quicken it up pre cooking the bacon about half way on a skillet will speed up the baking process. Hope this helps! So happy to have found this recipe

These were awesome! Didnt wrap the bacon cooked it until crisp and just chopped it up and added it in the cream cheese mixture.  Yum
