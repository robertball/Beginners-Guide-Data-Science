This was a very good dish, different and easy to make, I def. recommend this for a quick chicken fix.  I used snap pea stir fry veggies instead ot the snow pods it gave it a little more color.  I really wouldn't change anything about it,

I was surprised that such a simple recipe would turn out so well.  Served it to a few impromptu guests and they loved it.  One asked for the recipe.  Like another reviewer I used a frozen sugar snap stir fry mix so there were all different veggies in it.  I will definitely make it again.

This is a "keeper".  Very good and very easy, would not change a thing. Whole family thought this was good.
