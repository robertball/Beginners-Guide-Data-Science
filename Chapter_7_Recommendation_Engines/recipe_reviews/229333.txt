This recipe was just what I needed for my white rice! But I didn't add cheese, I went very light on the cayenne pepper, and I added red bell pepper sautéed with the onions. I will definitely be making this again

Tried it tonight, though I ended up using regular Onions. A Nice blend of spicy, sweet and savory. Would probably make again

I wish I could give half stars because this recipe would get 3 1/2 stars. I didn't care for it but my husband and mom really liked it.The recipe is very easy to make and doesn't take long to prepare. I may try this again only serve it different like maybe wrapped in lettuce.

I've made some questionable things before , but this topped the list. I made this to a T and have came to the conclusion it is not good. Save your ground beef and make something else.

This was the oddest thing I’ve ever made. First of all, due to the egg and honey, this stuff can not be “crumbled” into the skillet, but all things considered, not that big a deal. The honey is just very unnecessary, making this dish sticky, sweet and a bizarre combinations of flavor. I’m adventurous, but this was a bridge too far.

What a really quick and tasty meal, I followed your recipe to the letter and it was very tasty but I felt it was missing something so as I’m a garlic freak, I chopped up a couple of cloves of garlic and it just gave me what I was looking for.

Recipe was very good and very easy. I  only used a 1/2 tsp of Cayenne Pepper, because I like spicy not SPICY.

I thought it was pretty good. Sweet and spicy! I actually used this recipe for burgers instead. I used one pound of beef and used only half the honey the recipe requested. Also, since I doubled the recipe, I used 2 eggs, but next I think I'll use only one.

Made for supper tonight, it was okay.  The only changes I made was  I used 1 pound of ground beef and only  1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I was not sure what to  serve with it  any suggestions?    I did not think rice or potatoes was a good side dish. I served it with grilled  asparagus, but  I did not think it was a well rounded  dinner.
