Fabulous!!  Because there is a lot of chopping...(and I double the recipe)..i make the topping a day ahead.  The flavors really combine together. I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar and added a little fine chopped red onion.  I don't put them back under the broiler to heat, serve it cold.  My family and company raves about this recipe!!

My husband and I went to Italy for our honeymoon. Bruschetta was one of our favorite appetizers. One thing that I would omit doing is broiling the tomatoes once on the bread. I like the tomatoes uncooked, the way we had it in Italy.

This was good, however we added a lot more garlic to it to give it a little  bit more flavor.  We also brushed one side of the bread with olive oil before baking.  Balsamic vinegar also seemed to bring out more of the flavor.

Extremely easy to make and tates impressive.  Since I wanted my tomatoes room temperature, I toasted the bread in the toaster oven and omitted the broiler entirely.  Try this with a hearty red wine-- excellent!

This was very easy.  I added some balsalmic vinegar to bring some more flavor to it.  My first attempt did end with burnt bread because I had it too close to the broiler - so be careful!

A delicious recipe-tastes just like it does in Italy. Remember to move your oven rack to the furthest level away from the heat when you broil it though, or it will burn.

I don't even have to try this recipe because it is exactly how I make mine. Poeple tell me it ROCKS.
For the bread part though, I cut french bread thin and brush both sides with olive oil and broil it. You have to watch it closely  as it will get brown too fast.Turn the bread over and brown the other side as well.
The bread can sit overnight in a closed bag if you have to let it wait. It will stay nice and crunchy. After you spoon the tomato on top of the pieces of bread, we don't broil it but if you do you can also sprinkle a few shreds of mozzerella cheese and melt it. It really does ROCK.

My family and I have been making bruchetta like this for quite a while now, and we love it! Something that makes the recipe absolutely heavenly is adding fresh mozzerella in with the diced tomatoes, salt, and basil, and tossing together before spooning onto the bread to bake.  I recommend using a crusty bread for this recipe so that the tomatoes don't make the bread soggy.  DON'T let it set out before cooking.  Make sure you watch the time carefully.  Just as it is turning golden brown edges, that's when it is the most succulent.

Awesome!!!! this is soooooo yummy. I ate this like 10 min ago and am planning to make it tomorrow again. I gave the toasted bread a rub with one of the garlic cloves, then minced it and added it to the tomato mixture. Oh, i also added fresh oregano from our garden!! The taste is amazing, the toasted bread, fresh tomatoes and garlic combine to perfection.... THANX FOR THIS RECIPE!!!! Ada, you're an artist

Simple easy go-to recipe, especially if omit or substitute some of the seasonings, like Italian herbs for basil and oregano or leave out crushed red pepper to be more kid/teen friendly.

I made the prep for 2 I should have made it for more even though it was just 2 of us for the dinner.... it was fabulous.  I had bought balsamic vinegar to spice it up just in case but not needed.  I toasted the bread on the the BBQ, top open as we combined this with a grilled chkn pasta dish.

The roma tomatoes worked really well with the recipe. My friends said it gave the tomatoes a more tender bite. Only thing I did differently was add a bit more salt/pepper and another clove of garlic, but that is just because I like saltier foods. If you enjoy wine I discovered a Malbec by Alamos an Argentinian company worked very well with this recipe.

I love bruchetta but not broiled.  In Italy, the bread is grilled and then rubbed with a garlic clove.   The tomotoes are served raw.   That is the best way.  IT's Great!!

Yum! What a great way to use some of the fresh basil and tomatoes we have right now.  I too added a little extra garlic, some minced red onion and balsamic.  I make a double batch and we put any leftover topping on cold pasta for a refreshing salad.

Very very good!  I added a bit of shredded parm to the bread when I toasted the last side.  I too did not warm the tomatoes it was so good room temp.  I'm going to make this again this weekend and I know it'll be a hit.  I think I may add fresh mozzarella this time.  Thank you Ada!

Definately brush olive oil on one side of the bread before baking. This adds quite a bit more flavor. Personally, I didn't think the garlic was too much but I really like garlic. I used already minced garlic from a jar.

This was very good. The garlic was a little overpowering, and that is coming from someone who uses garlic in everything!  My husband liked it, but picked his garlic out. Next time, will probably sautee the garlic in oil to reduce the strength of the taste.  Not good if you let it sit; need to eat it right out of the oven.

I can hardly believe that I'm saying this but I really thought there was too much garlic in this. I also discovered that I much prefer a little cheese on my bruschetta. If I were to make this again I would probably use garlic powder, and sprinkle with Parmesan. Thanks anyway.
