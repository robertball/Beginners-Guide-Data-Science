This is very tasty but also very, very spicy!  Next time I will cut back on the hot sauce.  We really liked the sweetness of the fruits but had to make it without blackberries (which were not available right now).

LOVED THE SPICY SWEET TASTE.  I ALSO CUT BACK THE HOT SAUCE, BUT LEFT ALOT OF BITE STILL TO THE RECIPE.  GOT RAVE REVIEWS FROM FRIENDS AND COWORKERS.

YUMMY! Would be good to have a spicy rating and suggested amounts to reduce spicey level. I LOVE spices, but my guests may not be as taken with it. I'm serving with "hint of lime" chips and mini pitas. N

I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again and again.  The only thing I changed is the amount of heat in the salsa.  Most people won't be able to eat it that spicy.  I love spicy though and it is soo delicious and refreshing at the same time.

Quite an unusual salsa and spicy enough even when only using half of the hot sauce and cayenne pepper.  Delicious served with lime tostido chips.  I did not add all the "liquid ingredients" (jelly, green salsa, hot sauce) to avoid the salsa being "too runny". Chopping and assembling ingredients take way longer than 15 minutes prep time and served way more than 12.  I ended up freezing half.  Would I make it again~~YES!  It is yummy!  :)

A fresh and fruity alternative to regular salsa for eating with tortilla chips.  After reading the other reviews I started with only half the cayenne and hot sauce, and then added a bit more to my taste.  I used Golden Delicious and Macintosh apples, and red salsa since that's what I had on hand and it was still yummy.  Definitely allow more time than 15 min. for all the chopping!

I made this for a 4th of July party. Instead of the black berries I used blueberries. Not only did it make the recipe red white and blue, they were alot cheaper than the blackberries because they were in season. I only used 1 and 1/4 tablespoons of habenero sauce, and only 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne. It had just the right amount of kick. I can't imagine how hot it would be if made it as it is called for. Sweet, spicy, and refreshing for a hot summer day!

Ohhh it burns so good!  I found this recipe a few years ago, and my family has been begging for me to make it again. It's yummy. Don't think of it as chunky salsa. Think of it as a sauce with spicy sweetness, that puts a twist on the style of salsa.

this was tasty, but it was very runny. i don't know if i would classify this as "salsa" more of a dip really. it was very interesting though!!

Wonderful! I have used mango jam and pepper jelly and both turned out so very tasty. A few small preference changes. I used apricots instead of Kiwi to please my husband and I used fuji apples because I read somewhere they dont brown as easy. I also chose to use honey instead of sugar once and it was great. I paired this with homemade cinnamon tortilla chips. It makes a great pic nic item. Yum!

I actually enjoyed the heat. Rather than using as a salsa pureed it as a sauce over al pastor quesadillas. Awesome!

Like the other reviews noted, this does turn out watery. I remedied that by placing the salsa into a colander lined with paper towels for about 20 minutes, and it was perfect. Since the other reviews noted that this is super spicy, I cut the cayenne and habanero sauce both in half, and it was still plenty spicy. I also added a teaspoon of salt, and I think it needs a little more of a zesty lime flavor - like maybe some grated lime peel or something along the lines of the lime chips.
