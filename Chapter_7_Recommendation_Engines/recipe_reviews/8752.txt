I've been making and enjoying recipes from allrecipes for many, many years but this is my first time ever leaving a review.  That's how good this is!  My husband and I love this chicken recipe!  We've made it many times over the months and it is super easy, requires little effort and is always GOOD!  I make three minor modifications to the recipes; I use boneless/skinless chicken thighs or breasts, instead of grilling, I bake them for 45-60 min at 350 and lastly, I have yet to find ginger juice at either of my local grocery stores so I add a tsp of dried ginger spice.  It's a GREAT recipe that I know I'll continue to make again and again.  Thank you for sharing!

My husband & I were curious about the ingredients so we decided to give it a try.  WOW!  Very delicous.  We've made it twice already and once for a group of our friends that loved it!

This was a superior barbecue marinade from scratch.  It has an eastern/indian flavor and i bought the expensive jar of cardamom and do not regret it.  I would put fresh garlic if time was not an issue and I put diced toms instead of tomato soup.  The buttermilk seemed strange, but I obeyed the recipe and man, the SMELL was wonderful, topped only by the taste.

This turned out to be a fantastic way to grill chicken. Usually, grilled chicken is a bit boring, but this recipe provided an interesting asian twist - something between Indian and Thai.  I omitted the buttermilk, but was actually curious if coconut milk would have been more appropriate... Also, I used thighs and legs instead of a whole chicken and it turned out excellent, everyone loved it.

I had to mess with this a bit because I didn't have all of the ingredients, but it still tasted great!  I substituted ginger powder for ginger juice, omitted the cardamom and the salt, used plain soy milk for buttermilk, and used apple cider instead of the lemon juice and brown sugar.  I marinated it overnight, like the directions said, and grilled it on my George Forman (ah, the woes of apartment living). I served it with raw mushrooms, red pepper, warm naan, and garlic hummus. Definitely making this again!

I had scaled this recipe down for two people, and boy did I regret that. It was soooo delicious, we really wished we had enough for seconds. I actually baked it in the oven in the sauce since we didn't have a bbq. I will definitely make this again. And probably soon.

We tend to not go for spicy, so I knew this was a risky choice. Having four kids and a picky husband means that I rarely cook something that no one complains about. However, this was a big hit! I made it as is and everyone loved it and asked for seconds. I'll make more next time!

Everyone (including my friend's very picky daughter) LOVED this.  My kids even went back for seconds!  I may try baking it next time, just to see how it turns out when done that way.  Loved it!

Served this recipe for the first time on Labor Day but since it sounded so good, I decided to risk a new recipe for a dinner party - and got rave reviews from everyone!  I followed the recipe exactly and we LOVED it!

I used coconut milk, omitting the buttermilk, and added it from the get-go, also used ginger powder out of convenience.  I taste-tested the marinade before adding the chicken and ended up increasing all the spices and flavorings (minus the salt).  Good thing because after coming off the grill, the marinade were very faint.  I have similar complaints when making Tandoori chicken, where the flavors ride on a yogurt marinade.  I want to give it 3 stars but since I like charred chicken and didn't marinate the full time, plus the marinade tasted good with my changes, I gave it 4.  I'll give this one another go, but maybe I'll try baking instead.

I wish I agreed with the great reviews...but this chicken was less than exceptional.  I was really looking forward to a wonderful BBQ chicken but this chicken left a funny aftertaste and my husband actually said this was one of the worst meals I've made in years :(....I followed the recipe exactly except for baking the chicken and omitting the buttermilk.  I can't imagine this would have made that much of a difference...oh well, I will be deleting this one out of my recipe box to never be repeated...sorry!

The chicken came out nice and tender, but the flavor was disappointing. I was hoping for more of a Tandoori Chicken flavor and this just didn't have much kick at all.

I made this in the oven because it decided to rain when I made it. It cooked up nice and crispy on top but was very greasy on bottom, maybe I should've used a broiler pan. Also, I left out the ginger juice since I couldn't find it anywhere. It still tasted good, I'd like to try it on the grill next time, weather permitting.

This is a recipe I make regularly now and it is fabulous! The catch with this is you need to use chicken with the skin on or it doesn't come out quite right. I haven't tried it in the oven, but if I did I would probably try to broil it instead of bake it. 

The only changes I make to this is that I usually use the whole can of tomato soup (I hate wasting the other half), I use 1tsp ginger powder since I don't have ginger juice, and I use frozen leg quarters instead of a whole chicken (I hate cutting up a whole chicken).
