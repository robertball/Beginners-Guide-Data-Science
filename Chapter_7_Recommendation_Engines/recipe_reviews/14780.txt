I admit it, I was a big doubter on this one but I really wanted to try it.  My whole family, even 4 kids, loved this.  Who would have thought these ingredients combined so well?  To make it a quicker recipe though, I browned the chops, removed them from the pan, then sauteed the onions in the drippings.  In a separate bowl, I put in my chopped Granny Smith apples and then sprinkled the corn starch over these and tossed it to coat.  I only had a 14 oz. can of sauerkraut, so I increased brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  I then added the sauerkraut, brown sugar, and sauteed onion with all the drippings to the apples and mixed well.  I placed the pork chops in a casserole dish, covered them with the sauerkraut mixture, covered with foil and baked for 45 minutes at 350.  Perfect!  Served with potato perogies and crusty bread.  One of the few nights where there were no leftovers to put away.  This is a keeper for us.

Really good recipe, but you know that every cook has to add their own personality to the dish, so here are the "enhancements" that I made.  I used all ingredients except the vegetable oil and cornstarch, and I used a 12 ounce package of refrigerated sauerkraut, so I increased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  I sprayed a skillet with Pam, and browned the chops.  I removed the chops, and sauteed the onion in the same pan until tender.  In the meantime, I mixed the kraut, brown sugar and apples, added the sauteed onion, deglazed the pan and added the drippings to the kraut mixture and seasoned it with salt and pepper.  I love my slow cooker, so I place the chops in the bottom, and poured the rest of the mixture over the top.  Cooked it on low for about 6 hours.  The chops were tender, the sauerkraut nicely sweet and sour and my husband ate every bite, which is my barometer of a good recipe.  Definitely added this one to my recipe box.  Thanks!

This was very good and satisfying.  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and added a cup of water, then let simmer for about an hour.  I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch due to the extra liquid.  The porkchops were very tender and my husband said they were the best he had ever eaten. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so fast and easy... and delicious!  I must admit,  when I saw the results sitting in the pan,  I was more than a little nervous.  But that first bite was a pleasant surprise. Good German fare!

Very yummy, I just threw it all into the crockpot (minus the corn starch) on high for 4 or so hours and the chops were very (almost falling apart) tender.
Very good with buttered egg noodles.

This was great and easy, will definately make it again.  Didn't change a thing. However, I had very large pork chops (better for stuffing) and I would recommend making this recipe with thinner pork chops.

This was great.  Don't add extra water, unless your sauerkraut is very dry.  We found the sauerkraut liquid was more than adequate.  I used a mix of golden delicious and granny smith apples with this.  The flavor was WONDERFUL!

Excellent! This was very easy and relatively quick, would've been great for a weeknight. I actually used pears instead of apples, since that was what I had in the house. It probably made it a bit milder than it would have been with apples, but no less delicious. Kids loved too!

Quick, easy and delicious!!  Followed directions for 4 exactly (except-used 14 oz can of sauerkraut and stayed with amt. of sugar for 8 oz. can - adjust to your taste). Two of us ate the whole thing and we were glad of extra kraut.  Dinner was made in no time and I served it with buttered egg noodes - there is lots of gravy for it and buttered rye bread.  It's up to you whether you want a thin sauce or not - I waited until the very end of cooking and added a bit of cornstarch and cold water to thicken it to the consistency I wanted. I think kids would really like this dish.

This was very good and simple. Be aware that the sauerkraut turns out pretty sweet. I'll make this again. My husband liked it too.

This recipe suprised me. Very skeptical. The ingredients didn't seem.....right together. Wanted something different. I saw the good ratings and figured,  why not? Well...it was great! Smells good, taste good. Next time I'll brown the pork a little better so that the finished result wont look so bland. I used both green and red apples. Hubby and my 3 and 7 year old was happy with it. Yum!

GREAT! My husband, who doesn't like Sauerkraut, loved it. I browned the chops and then removed. Sautéed the onions with bacon and then added back chops and topped with the sauerkraut mixture. Because I'm Diabetic, I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend instead of regular B.S. in the sauerkraut. I garnished it with chopped Pecans.

WOW! This was great! I halved the recipe, left out the oil and cornstarch and did as another reviewer suggested: threw it all in the crockpot.  2.5-3 hours and done! So easy! So good... I don't like pork chops, but the toppings were great! My boyfriend loved this, said it was one of my best. Thanks!

Very good! I used a little less brown sugar because my husband doesn't like sweet meat dishes, and I didn't add the corn starch. It didn't seem to need it. I think it depends on how much juice is in your saurkraut. It was an excellent dish and we will be making it often!

I tried this recipe and was really pleased. It was quick, easy, and very tasty. My husband didn't care for the apple sauerkraut mixture, but liked the flavor it gave the pork chops. I definitely would recommend it.

This was amazing.  i only used the sauerkraut recipe.  used granny smiths.  Made Knedliky from this site, and used the sauce from Easy Roasted Pork from this site.  I put the prepared sauerkraut in a bowl, put the Knedliky on top and covered with the sauce from Easy Roasted Pork recipe.  sliced pork roast over.  We had NO leftovers.  It was delicious.  yes you have to use a few recipes to get this amazing dish but it was well worth it.  Oh and also, in the sauerkraut, i fried bacon separately and let it crisp and then broke that up and put that in the sauerkrat also.  Sorry for a long review, but this was AMAZING... THANKS EVERYONE!

Very Good!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The only problem I had was the ingredients say diced apples and the instructions call for sliced apples.  I went with the diced apples and it turned out great!

This is surprizingly very, very good! I was skeptical at first, but like trying new things. And I'm glad I did! I will say that you should definitely let it cook for the recommended 15-20 minutes so that the flavors can cook together. I tasted it early on, and it wasn't very good. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only changes I made were: I used less brown sugar, just because I didn't have enough; I didn't use corn starch, because I didn't think it needed it; I used an entire onion; I used the whole can of sauerkraut. If you like sauerkraut, I would recommend this recipe!

WOW! I love this recipe. I used stir fry pork strips because it's what I had. I also used a whole can of sauerkraut (undrained) so I didn't have a partial can hanging around and left the brown sugar as is. I served it over buttered egg noodles. Yum! My 16 month old loved it and my husband, who hates sweet foods, raved over this recipe! I can't wait to make it again! Thank you Shirl Soots!

I usually change recipes around for my own taste but decided to try this one as is since it sounded like such an odd combination of flavors and I am glad I did.  This was fantastic.  The only difference I made was salt and peppering my chops before searing.  It was phenomenal I will make this often.

This was wonderful!!!  I used a 14 oz can of sauerkraut and didn't use any cornstarch though -- didn't need thickening.

This was delicious! Even the picky eater loved it. I made it as written but I used slightly less sugar, added some fresh corn and about 1/2 c. of apple juice because my sauerkraut was a bit dry.

Since I had 6 rather large chops I doubled the recipe.  I baked covered in the oven for 1 hr at 350f.  A bit sweet for my taste and a bit too juicy.  Next time I would cut down on the brown sugar and remove lid for last 1/2 hr of cooking.  Company seemed to enjoy.  Chops were very tender!

I too tweaked. I used a slow cooker, browned and drained off the grease. I used a 15 oz can of sauerkraut, drained and rinsed to get rid of the bitterness and salt. I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and added diced, fresh tomatoes which somehow always goes well with kraut (to me). Very nice meal.

I have made several recipes from this website (and food network) and have been completely delighted by the results.  This is NOT one of those times.   Maybe I'm looking for more flavor punch in my food, but honestly, when you take a bite of these (all ingredients I enjoy), it tastes like three flavors that don't go with each other or complement each other at all.  I wound up eating each component separately to get through the dinner.  Not returning to this...might be good for kids or people who enjoy bland food.

Followed the changes suggested by Podger1: browned the chops, removed them from the pan, then sauteed the onions in the drippings. In a separate bowl, put in my chopped Granny Smith apples and then sprinkled the corn starch over these and tossed it to coat.  If using a 14 oz. can of sauerkraut, increase brown sugar to 3/4 cup. Add the sauerkraut, brown sugar, and sauteed onion with all the drippings to the apples and mix well. Place the pork chops in a casserole dish, cover them with the sauerkraut mixture, place lid or foil over.  Then, cooked at 300 for several hours.  Tender, flavorful, filling, easy.   Thanks for sharing.

Mmmmm, yummy.  If you think that combining these ingredients sounds odd, don't be fooled.  These chops are moist and the dressings are syrupy and sweet.  No "sour" in this kraut.  I'll make this a regular in our home.  Thank you for this sweet pork recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly except I cooked it on low for a longer time because we weren't ready to eat right away.  After cooking it on low for about an hour,I ended up putting the whole pot in the oven on 200 for about an hour.  It was like slow-cooked pork- very tender and everyone loved it.  It's a keeper.  Thanks!

My family loved this. I doubled the recipe somewhat and used 8 chops, a huge 32oz. bag of sauerkraut, 2 apples, 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 2 onions, about 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar, & pepper. I might even add more apples & onions next time! Made some garlic mashed red potatoes with it .

I don't care for pork chops or sauerkraut and LOVED this.  Instead of doing 4 chops only did 2 (normally hubby is the only one who'll eat chops).  Next time I make I'll definitely make the 4 chops but will double the rest of the ingredients (they were THAT good!).  I never added brown sugar to sauerkraut before but loved the result.  Will make again and again and again....

I don't like sauerkraut but I really liked this recipe. It was very tasty. I used pears instead of apples. The only downfall was that the pork as a bit tough.

This was good.  It had a lot of flavor, but I couldn't help but think it was missing something.  I don't know.  Maybe I will try breading the pork chops, and adding the topping after the fact.  I don't know if I would make it as is again, but I think it is a great platform to expand upon.

WOW!!! This was the best recipe I have made so far. It was sweet and slightly sour and the perfect alternative to plain chops. I added some more brown sugar just to give it some more substance. This will be a staple in my recipe book

Loved this recipe!!! I followed others advice and cut down on the brown sugar. What a clever & simple way to dress up pork chops. And the meat turned out very tender & juicy.

I followed the directions exactly but had to cook the pork about 5 extra minutes. I chopped the onions and apples into bigger pieces, so the cornstarch helped thicken the juice from the apples and sauerkraut. I really enjoyed the sauce more than the pork, but that may be because I ate too much. It was good, definitely worth trying.

Follow the directions and you can't go wrong.  I only wish I could find a few things in my cupboards and assemble a meal like this from scratch.  Delicious and will become a regular meal inmy home.

This was pretty good.  My husband really liked it, I thought it was okay.  I'm not sure why the recipe instructs to add 1T of cornstarch.  Perhaps you're not supposed to drain the sauerkraut?  I did drain my kraut and ended up adding water back to the pan to give the cornstarch something to do.  It was a little sweet for me and came out rather greasy.

I was looking for a way to use the 4 pork chops I had browned last night and came across this recipe. I used a 14oz can of sauerkraut and almost a cup of brown sugar, 1 apple, 1 small onion and no cornstarch. It is a little sweet and I probably would only add the 1/2 cup of sugar to the whole can of kraut if I make it again. Hubby said it was tasty but "it isn't his speed". I will probably be the only one to eat it,since my 4 yo dd and 2 yo ds will not even try it...

Okay, I only used 2 pork chops, but the same amount of everything else, and it was way too much!  If you're going to halve it- halve everything. I also cooked it in a cup of apple juice for an hour, and it ended up much sweeter than I would've liked.  Will try again without the brown sugar and maybe cook in water.  Not a failure, but not a favorite.
