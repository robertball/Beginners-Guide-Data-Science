Very tasty! I swapped half the butter for applesauce and half the all-purpose flour for whole wheat, and they still turned out thick, rich, and moist. Thanks for sharing!

Ignore the negative reviews-- this recipe is excellent.  Brownies were thick and moist, and cut really well.  My coworkers loved them.

I made these brownies and they were awesome.  I used Ghiradelli cocoa powder and substituted the butter with oil and they tasted even better than the box brownies.  Thanks for this good recipe.

These were very good. I had to bake them a little longer than stated in recipe. I added a pinch of cinnamon and cayenne pepper...I know it sounds strange but those two spices are wonderful in chocolate.

Really great, what i like 2 do is add some white chocholate chips, this adds a litte moisture and a little something extra 2 these brownies which makes them just perfect.

(These did not come out. After 20 min. it was bubbling so I put it in for another 10 minutes. When I took it out, all the butter was on top of the actual brownie and it all tasted bad. Maybe I did something wrong, but I don't think so.) sorry for the bad review the first time, I just found out that i put in doble the butter. i made it again-it was awesome!

There seems to be way too much butter in this recipe.  Mine came out with a layer of oil fat bubbling on top.  Oh well.  Onto the next.

OMG!!!!! These brownies are amazing! I do think that need a bit more time, say 10 minutes. But overall these brownies are chewy, milky, and totally unhealthy! But isn't that what they are supposed to be?! These are to die for!!!!!!! YUM!!!!!!!!~

I'm sure I did something wrong (I halved the recipe, and used half veg oil/half margarine) but the brownies were....well...horrible.   Like some other people pointed out, there was too much fat/oil, and it was everywhere. I removed a couple tablespoons from the batter as it was just collecting on top of it. I didn't add extra oil/fat as some people did, so I don't know why this happens.  Needless to say, they weren't nice, but I will try again, exactly as the recipe says, and come back to rate this once more if I get different results.

This was my first time making brownies that did not come from a box! Excellent recipe! The ONLY changes I made is that I did not have the nuts so I added chocolate chips and they are heaven! Done exactly what the recipe said only I had to cook them signifacantly longer, they still came out chewy and moist and like I said before DELICOUS!

These brownies are amazing. I only had 3/4 cup of white sugar so used 1/4 of brown plus added a pinch of cinnamon and cayenne as suggested by another reviewer. They turned out so moist and delicious! As a treat, I melted some chocolate mint buds on top for icing, it added just the right amount of minty sweetness. Definitely a keeper recipe, thanks for sharing!

These are amazing!  I love the soft, cake-like texture and how rich they are.  I made them twice within a week and took a batch to work.  Thanks!  I will definitely make them again.

UGH.  I don't know what happened, but I did what another reviewer suggested, and substitued half the butter for applesauce...it was awful!  The brownies were in the oven for over half an hour and just wouldn't cook all the way. =/  Not the best recipe for brownies...

Wow, just wow. Very nice. Halfway between fudgy and cakey, it's a chewy very chocolaty brownie.   Granted, I added coffee (strained out of the melted butter/cocoa) and extra cocoa. I also added an extra half cup of sugar to counteract the bitterness of the coffee and upped the walnuts to three quarters of a cup, but still the base recipe is strong. Just as good hot out oven (gooey) as cooled (chewy.)  Five stars, easy!

Meh. Nothing amazing or fantastic, my Husband didn't even finish one brownie before he decided he didn't like them. They don't stand alone, you need frosting or something to top them off.

My boyfriend and I tried this recipe because we were out of the boxed brownie mix. I had high hopes that it'd be even better. That was not the case. I used Crisco in place of the butter (I didn't have any butter) because the research I did said it'd be okay. Maybe that was the reason they were very greasy, which is why I gave 2 stars. They stayed "jiggly" and weren't very chocolatey. It's too bad. :/ I hope whoever reads this has better luck!

nice and easy light taste.  I used margaring rather than butter and skipped the nuts as it was a for a peanut free school event.  It made 28 - 2 bite sizes.  My son loved them. Next time I'll add chocolate chips to make it a bit more rich and gooey.

I made these according to the directions and after the time required to bake they were still not done. I baked them for an additiional 5 minutes and still all undone in the center. I will retry this recipe again using less butter and maybe a larger baking pan.

Really dry and not sweet enough.

Followed the recipe exactly, did not over bake or over mix. 

There are much better recipes out there.

Too bitter. Maybe it was the cocoa I used. I'm not sure, but they were very buttery and a little too bitter. Wanted something sweeter like the boxed brownies.

These brownies are soooo delicious.  I have always made them from a box and now after tasting these I will never use box brownies again.  I added a few pinches of instant coffee which really brings out the chocolate flavor without it tasting like coffee.  I also found adding chocolate chips makes it even better.

While vanilla is in the ingredients list, I nearly missed it since the directions never mention adding any vanilla in. I added about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips before baking. These required more like 30 mins to bake. Very sweet, gooey, not a cakey brownie.

I just tried this recipe and they are cooling as I type this.  They look and taste amazing! I could not resist taking a small bite.  I just increased the cooking time by about 7 minutes because the middle was a bit runny.  Yummy!!

Okay, these brownies haven't actually finished cooking yet, but my 4-year-old daughter and I felt compelled to rate based on licking the beaters. Mmmmmm....

Okay, now they're done cooking, and the final product is just as good as the batter. I did have to cook them 10 minutes longer. These are a nice cross between a cake-style and fudge type brownie. Super duper!

I followed the the directions exactly and the brownies turned out alright. They were moist, however tasted a bit floury for my taste. An easy, simple dish to whip if you are short on supplies and just wanting something sweet for the house.

Yum, yum and yum again! Such an easy recipe with very satisfying results! Everywhere I've taken them (work, kindergarden, parties) people keep telling me how great these brownies are and at home they don't last for more than an hour or two! I really like the fact that these aren't overly sweet but taste moist and chocolaty. Thanks for this yummy recipe!

These are a 5 plus recipe.  We loved them.  I made recipe exact except for the butter, I used 3/4 cup .  They are perfect, almost cake like around the edges and gooey in the center.  It's nice to find a recipe where I don't have to melt the hard unsweetened chocolate.
Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I live in a high altitude city so I ended up having to bake them an additional 15 minutes.  These taste pretty good, but if you are looking for the typical thick brownie consistency, these are not a good bet.  Also, don't forget to add the vanilla because the directions do not include adding it for some reason.

There's only one problem with this
recipe. It yields very few squares.
When I baked it, it simply vanished
right away!
I'm still looking for a recipe that
tastes the same but yields much more.

This recipe is okay, I  added in some chocolate chunks which was good. I did bake it a little bit to long, so it was more cake like. The directions forgot to include adding the vanilla, so I forgot to. I would make this again, but next time I would add a bit more sugar, remember to add the vanilla, and bake it do that it is still a chewy brownie!

The brownies are good and I prefer cocoa to using chocolate chips.  I adjusted this recipe quite a bit.  I used half the butter called for and just a couple of tablespoons of grapeseed oil to the batter.  The batter was very clumpy and greasy.  I was really concerned that it would be a fail but the brownies were good.  The were much flatter than the picture.  Also, I live in New Mexico and because of the altitude and because I made them in a glass pan, I only baked them for 15 mins.

Sorry guys this recipe lauded terribly dry brownies!  Was it just me or did the directions forget to mention the vanilla extract?  I might consider adding chocolate chips and milk to make them moist if I make them again... These were a bad dry chocolate cake version.

The very BEST brownies ever! 1000xs better than store bought, and everyone loves this recipe,  I've been using this recipe for at least 2.5 years now.

I doubled the recipe and used half butter and half coconut oil. They turned out really good, chewy and cake like. Not too sweet. Kids loved them, me I would add chocolate chips to give it that extra something.  I have been on the hunt for the perfect brownie, something to pleas everyone's tastes. This one is pretty darn close!!!!

I added a bit of table cream to increase moisture per other reviews, and they came out perfect.... somewhat moist and fudgy in the center and harder on the outside.

Delicious! I freaked out because I'd forgotten to sift the powder ingredients first but they came out awesome. As weird as it sounds, they came out moist and sort of cake-y too. Perfect!

*EDIT*  Question:  Can this recipe be doubled?  I'm going to try it anyway but if I can get an answer sooner, I'd much appreciate it!

Very tasty! I noticed the recipe did not mention when to add the vanilla so I added it after the eggs (same as a cake mix). I also had to bake them longer, about 10 minutes more. I made 1 batch plain and 1 batch with craisins and walnuts. Both are yummy! I will try subbing 1/2 the butter with applesauce next time!

Followed this recipe to the letter. The end result did not take much like a brownie. Very cakey and too much butter taste. I would not make again.

I thought this recipe was great!  The only thing I did differently was I cooked it for 30 minutes.  I used an 11x7 pan for it.  Everyone liked them.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

It was decent. 2 stars because a boxed brownie looks better, is easier to make and tastes better. I love to bake. This one was a let down :/

This recipe was amazing, it was the best brownie recipe i have ever tried! I highly recommend it and my family and friends loved it and begged for the recipe! But i tweaked it a bit, i used 3/4 cups of butter instead of one whole cup. I also put in 1/8 a cup of shredded milk chocolate hershey bar and it turned out very well!

The brownies were awesome but just a little hard. But really chewy on the inside. I had to use a lot of Pam so the brownies would not stick!

Pretty good; added some sour cream to help with moisture, but didn't add more sugar so the result really needed the frosting I added. Thanks for this recipe that doesn't need baker's chocolate!

Not the sweetest brownies I've made, and the next day they were dry and chewy. But it has a great rich chocolate taste.
