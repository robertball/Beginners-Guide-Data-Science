I made this recipe exactly as posted, although I was a bit hesitant because ingredients sound a bit unusual. I was glad I did. It was GREAT! My family loved it! I made it, tasted it and then put it in the crock pot with ribs - YUMMY! If you use crock pot, be sure to watch it as it may get too dark (due to sugars) if cooked too high and too long. Thanks for the recipe!

this was way too much sugars so I cut them all down using only 1/2 1 cup of ea they were still sweet but they were good. Fixed exactly as recpie called only using 1/2 of all sugars next time I will use only 3/4 cup each or maybe 1/2 very yummy they were all gone but still very sweet Do brown ribs first wouldn't hurt to cut most of the fat away..Will make again :)

Very tasty indeed! I added a good half cup of apple cider vinegar as well for a sharper tang!

I've been looking for something to put on my turkey burgers since the frozen ones can be pretty bland. I pared this down to 6 servings for 8 burgers and had sauce left over. We basted the burgers while they were cooking on the grill and then added more sauce on top (that I had set aside) instead of ketchup or mustard.I didn't use any oyster sauce and i used regular yellow mustard instead of the spicy brown.  EVERYONE loved it!! DELICIOUS!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe! I used clam instead of oyster sauce; less sugar; 2 Tb of freshly ground mustard seeds and 1/4 c prepared yelllow mustard instead of spicy brown; no worcesteshire (didn't have any) but some soy sauce and stir-fry sauce instead; fresh garlic grated instead of garlic powder....and WOW! Made the best ribs we have ever had!

Barbeque sauce is a real taste-preference type of thing, and this one was too sweet for us.  Followed the recipe to the letter, tasted it, and then made adjustments to suit our personal taste.  Thought the molasses dominated way too much, so I would cut that back in the future as well as the sugar.  Wanted more of a pop of spicy flavor, so I added a healthy dose of hot sauce (instead of more cayenne) which brought it up to speed for us.  Seriously, I was expecting a sauce that had an Asian tang to it, but the hoisin and oyster sauces were lost IMO.  Finally, the recipe doesnâ€™t call for heating the sauce, and after stirring for a long time, the consistency still was granular, so I heated for a while allowing the sugar to dissolve.  None of this is to discourage any of you from trying this recipe.  Again, we all have different tastes, this one was a bit too sweet for us, but may be exactly what you are looking for.  My rating is based on the tweaks I made.
