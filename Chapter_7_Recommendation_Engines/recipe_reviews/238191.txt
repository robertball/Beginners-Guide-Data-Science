These turned out great!  I didn't have any coconut flour or xantham gum, but I decided to try out the recipe anyway.  The scones turned out slightly crunchy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside.  I will definitely make these again!

I followed the recipe exactly. It's quite light and fluffy on the inside. My oven cooks fairly quickly, so I dropped my time to 14 minutes and they were still a little more brown than I wanted. So, I'd suggest watching yours a little more closely than I did... This is a great base recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. I followed the advice of another reviewer and did not add the coconut flour or the xanthan gum. I used greek yogurt, added a tablespoon of pure maple syrup and a cup of chocolate chips. The crust was crispy and the inside was perfectly moist. I will definitely make these again using the base for either sweet or savory scones.

I substituted the all purpose flour for a mix of flours... almond, brown rice, millet and oat. Very good!
