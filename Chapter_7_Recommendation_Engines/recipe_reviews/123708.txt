Key to this is to use sea salt on the onions when cooking, for the most awesome taste.

These beans are a family tradition at the holidays although I make them all the time since everyone loves them.  My mother was born in 1918 and she learned to cook these from her German mother-in-law. So this goes back to the 1800's!  The only difference in making ours is that we add 1 tbls. of vinegar (or more depending on your liking) to the onions whent they are cooking.  I like to use extra black pepper on mine but that is only a preference.  I don't remember anyone not liking these beans.

This was a very good recipe.  Because of the bacon fat, I will only make them for special occasions at home (they're very rich for our day to day consumption).  However, I will definitely make them for potluck dinners because they're sure to be a hit with a crowd!

Oh my goodness!  These were fabulous.  The only change I made was to up the bacon and decrease the onions.  Served them with Wiener Schnitzel, Spaetzel and Streudel for dessert.  it was a great meal, not one you want to be concerned about calories for, but just great!

Excellent!  My family and I aren't huge green bean fans, but we devoured this.  Be prepared if you bring this dish to a potluck because everyone will be requesting it from then on.

I do not particularly like green beans, but they are pretty good made this way.  This is the most requested recipe by my family and friends.  It seems like I make them at least once a week.  Even the kids like them.

My grandmother use to make green beans and lima beans both this way. When fresh beans were out of season she would use canned. I always preferred them the next day when all the flavors had blended. Ahhh fond memories. 8+)

Our family loves these!  They are even better the second day!  To take them over the top, I just add a splash of apple cider vinegar and some sea salt to the onions while they are cooking.

The red onion infused with the bacon flavor is excellent! I've made these for 2 holiday dinners in the past and everyone ate them up!

Very good.  I used canned green beans and this just made them out of this world.  I will make these again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
