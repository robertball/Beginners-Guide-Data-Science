I made this salad for a 'healthy' potluck lunch and it was a huge hit.  I made it the night before and kept refrigerated until we were ready for lunch, which allowed the fruits to blend together.

I also added some sweet onion to this mix with really good results.  Very low calorie, and very good for you too!!!

I didn't measure anything....I used one mango, 3 strawberries, a handful of blackberries (I used frozen), the juice from half a lime & added half a sliced banana & a drizzle of honey. I also used only a sprinkle of cilantro (all I had was dried) but added quite a bit of fresh, chopped spearmint. This salad cooled down an overly spicy dish very well...hubby & I ate it all! Will have again over & over...thanks for the recipe!

This salad is very refreshing.  The cilantro adds
a little zest to what could otherwise be a regular and sweet fruit salad while freshly squeezed lime juice adds just the right sparkle.  It is colorful and as pleasing to the eye as it is to the palate.

I made this recipe and it was great. I added about an 1/8 to a 1/4 cup of fresh mint as an afterthought - that made it perfect!

I loved this salad.  It has a beatiful presentation and the flavor is lovely.  Very refreshing.  My 3 yr old is not a huge salad fan, but asked for seconds of this one.  Will absolutely make again.

I can't believe I found a recipe that called for just what I had in the fridge! Left out the cilantro as I don't care for it (tastes like soap to me...) and used blackberries that we picked from our backyard. The addition of the lime juice (which I love on everything anyway!) was inspired. Excellent with breakfast or as dessert (with ice cream? hmmmm...).

Incredible!  I was a bit afraid of the cilantro in it, but it MADE the salad!  I had it plain, then on buttered toast (yummmm), and the next day I cooked it with a little cornstarch and orange pineapple juice to make a compote and had THAT over toast.  DELICIOUS!!!  Even my hubby loved it, and he doesn't like healthy food.  ;)

Very nice flavor.  I wasn't sure if I'd like cilantro with fruit but it was nice.  The salad was even better by later when it had sat for a while.

This was okay, but I didn't like the cilantro as much as I thought I would.  I wonder how it would taste with mint.

We love mango, strawberries and blackberries. We also like lime, the only reason left to dislike this salad so much is the cilantro. We like cilantro in salsa recipes and charro beans, etc. but just didn't enjoy this at all.

I really liked the lime and cilantro, blackberries and strawberries, but the mango did not taste good at all. Maybe with pineapple instead, this could be a 5 star.

This is excellent.  Everyone at our house likes it and wants me to make it again.
