Ok so I reviewed this a few months ago and I said I added some sweetened condensed milk to sweeten up the milk & coconut cream bcuz the coco cream was not sweet at all. Today I made the cake again and this time decided to use Goya brand coconut cream and it's sweet! So there's sweet coconut cream and unsweetened coconut cream...never knew that until today! Hope this helps!

I was a little apprehensive about trying this cake. I usually don't favor Tres Leches cake, as it is usually to wet for my taste. This recipe sounded promising and I found that it was perfectly moist, with the right amount of sweetness. The flavor of the cake is on the delicate side so if you are looking for an intense pina colada flavor, or something that is very sweet this cake isn't it. Otherwise enjoy!

Everyone that tried it, loved it. Next time, we are going to add some rum to it. Loved the whipped topping, made it a lighter-tasting cake.

Love  this cake!  I am not a fan of traditional tres leche cake.  It is just too wet.  This cake is moist and light and delicious!  I made it last week for my family.  They loved it.  I want to make it again but I'm having trouble finding cream of coconut! I wish I remember where I bought it before.

Amazing! I thought this might be too soggy once I pored the coconut cream on but it wasn't. Also, instead of regular milk, I used coconut milk. I also whipped 2.5 cups of heavy cream with 1/2 cup sugar and it turned out to be a perfect ratio. RAVE REVIEWS a!!

Cake mixes are not as large now. The one I bought, Duncan Heinz,the only one I could find without pudding, was 16.5 ounces, so we added 1.7 ounces of flour. I was worried about whether or not the pineapple should have been drained or not. I didn't drain it. I used more toasted coconut on top, probably about a cup. We also added a little rum to the whipping cream. The cake was a HUGE hit at the dinner party to which we took it.  We'll probably cut down on the milk next time. YUM!!

Everyone that tried this cake, LOVED it (even people who claim to NOT like cake)!  It is not too sweet and not too wet for my liking...just perfect.  But, as other reviewers have done, I also used about 1/4 of a cup of toasted coconut on top.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved it.  I added coconut to the batter, used apple sauce instead of oil, and cut down the water to 1 cup.  Also used light cool whip instead of whipping the cream myself.

A really moist, light, not over-whelmingly sweet but sweet enough to hit the spot. Really simple to make. Everyone one loved it and had at least two pieces, even people who claimed not to like coconuts could not resist seconds.

I made this for a coworker's birthday and everyone loved it!! I thought it was great, but I will definitely substitute rum for the water next time. Easy, light, and delicious! I also used quite a bit more than one tablespoon on top of the cake, probably more like 1/4 cup.

We made this for a group at our son's 24th Birthday Dinner.  Everyone raved about the dessert.  Our family has Latin heritage - so we like Tres Leches cake.  But this is much better.  It is less sweet, and just as moist!  The pineapple gives is an extra special flavor.  I find it so much more interesting and special than a regular Tres Leches, or a regular Birthday Cake.  I searched desserts extensively on this website for something special for this dinner, and I am so glad I came across this one.  I made it prettier by making a raspberry puree sauce to write the birthday greeting with his name on top of the cake, with a decoration.  This cake is a winner!

I liked the flavor, though the texture was a little too wet for me. I think I would cut back on the milk/cream of coconut mixture next time. I used more coconut on top than it called for. Probably a half cup or so. Super easy. Thanks for the recipe :)

I made this for a Mexican dessert  at Taco Night at my kid's school. I cant say enough Good things about this recipe! Cans of coconut cream are now 13.75oz, instead of 15oz, but it was a perfect amount. I used a white cake mix. I added 1tsp Coconut extract to the whipping cream frosting, but didnt change anything else. This cake was so incredibly decadent, it was almost too Amazing for 'Taco Night'. THX for a 100% Awesome recipe! I cant wait to make it for Cinco de Mayo!

Just made this for a party this weekend. I made it in a 9 in round pan, it turned out great, I added some vanilla to the icing and the extra some of the extra pineapple juice to both the cake batter and the icing. It was not too sweet, I especially like how the frosting turned out- nice and light. Most people had seconds and I was asked to make it again! This is a really easy recipe and seemed to be a crowd pleaser!

I barely detected the pineapple in the end product.  I would have liked it to be more pineapple-y.  I wasted sure how long to let the cake absorb the liquid, so I tried a piece after a few hours and it was pretty soggy.  But the next day it was much better texture, so I recommend to let it sit overnight.

I used Thai coconut milk, sweetenend condensed milk, and evaporated milk as my "tres leches," and the result was all the rave! Had to mass distribute my recipe (with due credit given to the starter recipes of this dish)....and now it's been voted at work that I have to bring this cake to every social occasion!

Love, love, love this cake! So easy, delicious and unique. Followed recipe exactly except the box cake mix was less than recipe called for, so added a little flour (suggestion from other reviewers. I used Goya brand cream of coconut. YUMMY!

It was unclear whether the pineapple should be drained . I drained it. Next time I will add more pineapple and drain it. The cake was wet enough without the extra juice.

First time making this, but NOT the last. 
Easy to follow. 
Made it for a church choir potluck, and it was a hit for all. 
Cream of Coconut was found at a Mexican food store, and used Cool Whip instead of heavy whipped cream for ease. 
Giving this a 5 Star Rating! *****

I was a little apprehensive about making this cake after reading all the mixed reviews: too wet, too sweet, not sweet enough. I thought this cake had the right amount of moisture and was just sweet enough. Very refreshing.

Was really easy! It was loved by all my guests & I got lots of complements. You only need half of the cream of coconut though, so I put the rest on the side to be added at will. Really good!

The only change I made was i added 3 ounces of pineapple cake (all I had on hand) since the recipe calls for a bigger amount than what I could find in the store. I also used the Goya brand cream of coconut since it is sweetened. I made this for a office pot luck for Cinco De Mayo and it was a hit! Everyone loved it many requested the recipe and a few even said it was the best tres leche they have ever had or well dos leche since that is technically what this is, I loved it as well it wasn't too wet or too dry it was just the perfect amount of moist cake with the pineapple pieces through out I am a fan this is now my go to cake for any gathering, thank you! I will be adding rum to it next time this time I didn't since it was a work function. :)

This was okay. Won't make again.  I realize it's a Tres Leche cake but it's just too wet for us.  Recommend using only half the amount of coconut cream on top.  Extremely hard to find coconut cream these days so I wouldn't be likely to try this again anyway.

I can't really give this recipe a true review because I couldn't find coconut cream so I just skipped that step. I did everything else as per recipe with an addition of coconut & 3/4 cup flour (my cake mix was smaller than recommended) to the cake mixture. I made about 2.5 dozen cupcakes & they were sooo yummy. I'm going on a hunt for coconut cream and will revisit this recipe when I find it.

I made this for someone that wanted a tres leches cake for his birthday.  I have only had Tres Leches once and didn't love it.  I looked for alternatives and found this.  It was a great hit and I am making it again.  This time I am making two so I get some.

I liked this but didn't love it. It was good and unique, though, and a nice summer dessert.

This cake is awesome! I’ve made it twice. I wanted it a little sweeter so I put a splash of vanilla in my batter and a splash of rum in the topping. People are already asking me to bring it to get togethers.
Thanks for a great recipe

This was a BIG hit with our friends, all of whom had eaten traditional tres leches cake previously, including one who ate it more than once in Costa Rica. I drained the pineapple and substituted the juice for part of the water called for in the cake batter. The only other change was making a larger quantity of toasted coconut and serving it on the side, since not everyone appreciates coconut, and those who did could enjoy it to their personal taste. I will definitely make it again and will probably make it the same way.

I would make it again. I bought the coconut milk instead of the coconut cream. But it turned out ok.

Gluten free cake mix, reduced water to agree with box instructions. Otherwise, followed instructions.

Too sweet. The cake at the bottom was very soggy, and the top didn't have any coco/milk at all. I would pour that mixture over the cake in thirds over a couple of hours to allow it to soak in in more slowly instead of running to the bottom. Probably also would squeeze the crushed pineapple dry before adding,  to reduce the sweetness.

I know the additional instructions advised to used coconut cream, but that might have been part of the sweetness issue. I would halve it and replace with milk next time.
