This was okay, nothing too special but definitely super quick to prepare and was made with common household ingredients.

Quick and easy but COMPLETELY bland.  After reading the ingredients, I substituted the Cream of Mushroom for Cream of Chicken, and with the Paprika I added some Thyme, a touch of Ginger (I was using the frozen Stir-Fry veggies) and some Cayenne.  It smelled delicious, but unfortunately it was completely tasteless.  Will not be making agian.

I did some things different,instead of water i used milk,and a spoonful of sour cream,to make it creamier..To make the chicken more flavorful I dressed it up a bit,with some garlic powder sprinkled on both sides, Goya seasoning on both sides,a little bit of dill on one side,a sprinkle of sazon Goya on both sides,instead of the paprika. Than i placed the chicken on top,and sprinkled some lemon juice over it,was a nice touch,other than that I followed everything else to recipe.

Had to do some substitutions based on stuff on hand.  Here is what I did: used brown rice with a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Dips seasoning, used mixed frozen vegetables (carrots, peas, green beans, and corn) about 2 cups, and instead of paprika used plain salt & pepper on the chicken.  This was delicous!  Both my dad and I ate 2 salad bowls full.  I would recommend doubling the recipe for more than 3 people- we barely had leftover between the 2 of us (plus my 2 year old daughter).

This recipe turned out to be a train wreck for me! I followed it exactly and after an hour of baking the rice is completely under cooked and hard. I had to separate the chicken from the sauce/veggie/rice mixture and put it in a saucepan to try again. I'm hoping I can salvage the rice but at this point it's a lost cause and I've waisted lots of good ingredients. I will never make this again. Ever.

This was ok. I added extra seasonings to my taste, and cooked the rice a bit first so cooking time would be accurate for the chicken and rice, but it was still just very bland, but not inedible.  There were no textural problems, but I wouldn't make it again because I don't want to have to excessively doctor up a recipe.  Also gave points for how easy it was to make.  Thanks for sharing!

I took a note from others and used cream of chicken just to help the chicken flavor come out more. I also noticed the recipe didn't season the chicken AT ALL! I seasoned my meat to my own preferences and added a little seasoning to the mixture as well. Also added some parmesan cheese to the cheddar cheese. Baked an extra 30 min without foil for a lil brown on my chicken and put in oven for a bit to melt the remaining cheese. I will defrost the chicken next time or use fresh chicken since the chicken was almost too bland. Luckily my flavorful rice saved it!  will definitely make again!

It's a great tasting recipe anyone can make super quick and easy.  No, it's not anything fancy but isn't that the point.  Great tasting and no complicated ingredients, just put everything in one dish and bake.  The ones who say that this dish is bland just don't have much of an imagination or creativity in the kitchen.  Use a different flavor of soup since there are so many different kinds now.  Use a can of cheese soup instead of a cream soup and you wouldn't even need the shredded cheddar cheese but I'd add it anyway, well, because more cheese is better and would give a more gooey texture to the recipe.  Add a different meat into the mix or even already cooked meat, spices, milk instead of water.  Doesn't anyone have any ingenuity or originality?  Be creative people!!!  It's only food, not a life or death situation.  Have fun with your food.  If you haven't made this yet, you should definitely try it.

This was very good. I used chicken thighs instead of boneless skinless chicken breast and white rice because I didn't have flavored rice. I left the skin on for flavor but didn't like the rice being a little gummy. Once it cooled down the rice was better. I will try it again with boneless skinless thighs or breast.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I did differently is replace the water with chicken broth. I have also used fresh veggies in place of frozen twice. Once with baby carrots and once with sugar snap peas~great both times.
