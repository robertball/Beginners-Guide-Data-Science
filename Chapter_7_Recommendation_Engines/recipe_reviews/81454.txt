This was very good! I omitted the macaroni, and took my immersion blender to the stew a tiny bit. Delicious, and you're right the cheese on top was perfect :)

I thought this was an interesting combination and it tasted good.  I omitted the red pepper because I didn't have any and used a white potato because it is what I had on hand and thought it was pretty good.  I also used protein penne noodles because I didn't have any elbow macaroni, but think elbow may be better.  I would add this recipe to my weekly rotation.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
