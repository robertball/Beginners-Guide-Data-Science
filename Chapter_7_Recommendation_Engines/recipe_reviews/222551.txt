This was nice, though I must admit, as written it's a little perplexing to me.  It's too much for a shooter, yet not enough (and too sweet) for a "cocktail" (though it's called a "cocktail").  I solved this by simply topping it off w/Diet 7-Up for a very enjoyable cocktail.  Cheers!

This is a southern classic!
Expect sweet!!!
To some the name suggests a shooter but it is a Collins glass cocktail. Slammer refers to its dangerously deceptive sweet over strong nature.
