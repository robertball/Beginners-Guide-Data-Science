This salad is very good. After I chopped the avocado, I soaked it in lemon juice for 5 minutes, then added to the salad, as I knew I wouldn't eat all the salad in one day.  Very good flavors and the cucumbers were still crunchy the next day.  Will add it to one of my favorite salads.

This was great! First time I use avacados other than in quacamole salad, or garnish. Nice sweet/tangy flavor. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used an italian vinagarette, and used 2 full teaspoons of dill weed in place of fresh dill.

Wow, I was surprised at how good this is. The avocado gave this a creaminess that I really liked taking marinated cucumber/onion salad to another level. Really good. I will serve this again. Thanks for the great salad!

this was ABSOLUTELY delicious! Make sure avocados are not too mushy bc this salad runs the risk of becoming mushy. Also I used garlic powder as I didn't have garlic and that worked fine! a keeper!

Deliciously Refreshing. I substituted basil for dill, and rice wine vinegar for red wine vinegar and added a little tomato for color. Yummmm.

Really delicious! I added cherry tomatoes like one of the pictures had- it didn't add tons of flavor, but the color really popped. I also didn't bother draining the mixture before adding the vinegar and saw no issues. The whole family, including the almost 3 year old, loved it!

Just okay for me.  I wished as I was making it that I had fresh dill since dried tastes completely different, but I REALLY wished as I was eating it that I had left out the sugar all together.  It just made the cucs taste like sweet pickles.  I ended up just eating the avocado out of the salad and leaving the rest.  Not sure why there are so many steps either...just mix and serve.

I was so surprised at how quickly this came together; I forgot to save out the avocado till the second "chilling", so it all went in together, but didn't hurt the taste at all. Not sure that the quartered garlic added any flavor, but it didn't hurt, of course. I had no fresh dill, so used about 1/2 tsp of the dried dill weed. This salad is SO good; a keeper!

I really enjoyed this salad, I could taste all the different ingredients and the combination of dill, avocado and cucumbers went very well together! It was a crisp and refreshing side dish to a barbequed steak and roasted potatoes.  I will definitly be making this salad again!

This is good no doubt.  It is crisp, refreshing, and the flavors blend well.  I'm an onion lover and this was a little too much for me, although this could be the result of the sizes of vegetables I used.  The taste of the avocado was lost a little, will add more next time.

This was a really good, very light and refreshing. Next time I make it, I will put more avocados and less sugar. I prefer my salads less sweet, and more sour.

Wow, this was delicious! I left out the onion and cut all of the spices and vinegar in half. Next time I will just make the whole salad ahead of time and refrigerate it until ready to serve.

Wonderful Flavor!  Reminded me of a traditional polish dish of cucumbers, dill, and vinegar but with the addition of avocado which made it even better!  Only thing I did differently was just combine all ingredients in a bowl and let chill, didn't follow the recipes other instructions and it turned out great!

This was a little too vinegary for my taste, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. I used green onions instead of red because I prefer the milder flavor. Very easy to put together!

This sounded like a yummy idea, andI made it as written, but for me, there was way too much dill. Might try again with less.

Just finished making this. I did not have fresh dill so I used dill weed. I used Splenda in place of sugar, and not as much as I should have.  A teaspoon of dill weed, less onions, and not as much of the vinegar.  I tasted and tested as I slowly drizzled in the Italian flavored red wine vinegar. Absolutely delicious. Thank you for submitting.

Good flavors but the cucumbers were not crisp enough and the avocado was a little mushy.  Maybe slice cucumber a bit thicker as well as the avocado.

So tasty and fresh! I used dried dill and it came out fine. I also diced up the garlic and left it in because we're big garlic fans in this household,  taking it out is just silly ;) Overall a quick and easy recipe,  I'll definitely be adding this into our rotation!!

I used half the sugar and chopped up the garlic and left it in. Good stuff.

We didn't like it... it was too wet, too sour, ... color was too dark. May be the avocado was too soft...

I also used the dried dill weed in place of the fresh dill because I didn't have the fresh.  Everyone loved it and will be a keeper!
