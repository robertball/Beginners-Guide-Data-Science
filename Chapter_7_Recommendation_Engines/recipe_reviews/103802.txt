My family loved this salmon. The only change I made was, as someone else said, dried dill for the fresh, because I failed to tell my husband that it should be fresh. Hehe. One thing you should try is to squeeze the citrus slices over the fish after it's cooked. It really added a punch to the flavor! I also had to make a modified lemon pepper, because I didn't have any. I used lemon and lime zest, and pepper, but I think I needed salt, too. All in all, it was great! I'll use this cooking method for fresh fish again, it came out better than any I've ever made! Thank you!

I cooked salmon several times using this recipe. The first time, I had it in the oven too long. I wanted to make sure the fish was completely cooked. Even with the parchment paper, the result was a dry and somewhat tough fish. The second time, I cooked the fish for 15 minutes, the time stated in the recipe. What a difference! The fish was incredibly tender and juicy! The blood orange, lemon, lime and fresh dill provided a wonderful subtle flavor. Other times I used dry dill from McCormick and a standard Florida orange due to the unavailability of fresh dill and blood oranges. Even with these ingredients, I found the salmon still had an incredible amount of flavor.  I can confidently say this is the best salmon I ever had! This was also the first time I ever used a blood orange. I was shocked to see after slicing the orange, a purple color, not the familiar orange. Instead of throwing out the orange, I did a Google search for blood oranges and discovered this is a normal color. I ate the left over blood orange and was pleasantly surprised by itsâ€™ exquisitely wonderful flavor.  I also learned blood oranges are more popular in Europe than in the United States. I only found the blood orange available during the winter/spring.  Bottom line, I highly recommend this recipe!

Kudos to the author of this recipe!  This is an excellent method for fish which produces beautiful results.  The flavors are subtle and will depend on the quality of ingredients used.  My only recommendation is to lightly salt the fish along with the pepper.  Thank you for such a well written recipe!

I have made this on several occasions now, and have gotten rave reviews.  No need to go crazy with size or shape of parchment - just cut a piece big enough to make a package out of it.  I often use a sprig of rosemary as the herb -tastes and smells fantastic. This is a great meal to bring to someone elses house - just make the packets at home and bake them when you get to the house. - serve with green veggie and couscous.

This was excellent. It was my first time making fresh fish and it turned out so well! It was also a big hit with my family, including the "fish haters". I used regular oranges and it worked out great.

I just prepared this recipe tonight for dinner and couldn't wait to review! This is so yummy - definitely a keeper for my family! I followed the recipe except added sea salt in addition to the lemon pepper seasoning. I love fresh ground sea salt with all of my fish recipes! This was no exception - it really brought out the flavor of the salmon. I loved using the parchment paper - made the salmon so tender and juicy! This is an awesome recipe to add to summer dinners! I added roasted red potatoes and sauteed asparagus as side dishes. I also poured the juices left over in the parchment paper over the salmon and we used fresh sliced french bread to dip in the juice - yummy!

We really liked this salmon.  The only alteration to the recipe I made was to use dried dill instead of fresh and I think my dill needs to be replaced as it wasn't very flavourful.  The lemon pepper is needed for sure because the fresh citrus doesn't really impart a huge amount of flavour...we found it was primarily for presentation.  A nice light dish which I will very likely make again.

The salmon in this recipe came out so moist and so flavorful.  (I cooked it for 15 minutes.)  The orange, lemon, and lime flavors were very fresh and delicious.  I only had dried dill weed but I didn't see where it made a difference in the final dish.  I served the fish out of the parchment on a bed of baby spinach, tomato wedges and carrot matchsticks.  The sauce made a nice citrusy "dressing" for the spinach.  Thanks for a great recipe, Empress!

I couldn't find a blood orange anywhere around me, but a regular orange fits as a perfect substitute. I have made this about 4 times, and it hasn't lasted very long in the fridge not once. This takes some time to prepare, but once it is finish, it is worth it. I am not a big fish person, but this recipe is a winner. Make sure to rub in seasoning before you place citrus pieces on the fillets.   This one is a keeper!

with the same ingredients listed, but a few tweaks in how they were used, this turned out wonderful! what did i do differnt? i only used half of each fruit for the garnish, meaning i sliced it really super thin, as really it's not there to eat, it's just meant to look pretty. the other half of the fruit, i jusiced into a little bowl. i actually chopped the dill fine and added that to the juice. before putting the slices on, i spooned the juiice/dill mixture over the salmon, which i had made a few cuts in to allow the juice to penetrate into the salmon more. i cooked it as directed, and it came out looking beautiful, and tasting really good. only gave it 4 stars because i had to change some of the production to make sure my salmon actually had a citrus flavour.

Very moist, tender salmon.  The lime flavor outshines all the other citrus flavors in this recipe.

Though this recipe was delicious.  I did not have any organges or limes on hand so I just used extra lemons, which worked out great!  I also added salt for additional flavor.

My favorite part of this recipe is cooking in parchment paper.  It is a really clean way to cook salmon (no spatters) compared to the broil method I usually use, and minimizes the smell in the house.  One thought for experimentation:  use gomasio (sesame seeds and salt) and herbes de provence (which has dill in it) instead of dill and lemon pepper.

Everything about this recipe is perfect!  The seasonings are spot on and the end result is FANTASTIC!  I halved the recipe since it was just two of us and I cannot remember the last time the hubby kept on and on about how delicious a recipe is.  When that happens, I know it's a keeper!!  I used one naval orange instead of blood just because I couldn't find it.  Still so great!  No fishy taste, ridiculously healthy.. what is there not to love?!?!

I used a regular orange and added some salt.  Joe loved it.  Said it didn't need the salt. I served it with sauteed mushrooms and rice.

Made this twice, now. First time, followed the recipe exactly, was a little bland; second time, added a sprinkle of sea salt and a pinch of toasted, cracked cumin to bring out the sweetness and flavor of the salmon, magnificent!  Also, the second time, i snipped the first sprig of dill over the fish to allow more flavor to come out.

My only addition was some sea salt as other reviews had indicated.  My husband loved the citrus flavor of the salmon, so it's sure to become a regular.  450 degrees for 15 minutes was perfect timing.

Excellent way to prepare salmon! I didn't have lemon pepper, so just used salt and pepper. The citrus flavor was really nice. I'll be doing my salmon in parchment from now on!

I didn't have dill or oranges, substituted mint and basil and grapefruit. It was delicious and moist. Lots of times my salmon is dry not with this recipe.

This recipe is great!  It's my favorite way to cook salmon and it turns out perfectly every time.  I make it and serve it to guests without hesitation.  It is great because I can place the salmon in their packets and the baking sheet fits nicely in my refrigerator while we enjoy cocktails and appetizers.  I can then just preheat the oven and pop in the pre-made packets and dinner is ready in a snap!  Everyone seems to love it.  I'm making it tomorrow and looking forward to it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, my favorite for salmon.

Easy to prepare and absolutely delicious. I used steel head trout which is very similar but milder than salmon. I brushed with olive oil and swirled a little concentrated balsamic on the fish. Then squeezed a little lemon and a little orange on top, topped with lemon and orange slices and flat parsley. Baked at 450 and it was wonderful.

Will definitely make this again! So easy and flavorful. And an added bonus, as the only salmon eater in my house,  this method doesn't stink up the house like pan frying salmon! My family isn't  complaining about the fishy smell! I love to make several packets at a time and save for lunches. Thank you for a keeper recipe. Oh,  and I added salt. with the lemon pepper.

What a  versatile recipe! I used the suggested herbs, and then added a dash of paprika for color on top of each filet prior to placing the citrus slices. No blood oranges on hand (as others have said) but I had both lemons and limes -- so I sliced them up and placed on top. Finally, for added moisture, I splashed a few tablespoons of white wine (Sauvignon Blanc) and a tablespoon of lemon juice around each filet. Perfection! Hubs and I both loved!

This is a new family fav! I didn't have lime, fresh dill (just dried) or lemon pepper seasoning so I just added salt pepper and a little garlic powder with extra lime. Super simple and no mess. Cooked for exactly 15 mins for a perfect fish though I thought it was undercooked because of the blood orange. It bled into the meat to give the exact color of uncooked salmon! Did the flake test just to be sure and it was perfectly cooked. Thank you for an awesome and simple dish!

The citrus salmon in parchment was delicious. I did tweak a few things simple because I didn't have what was called for. I substituted the lemon pepper with Simply Organic Chophouse seasoning- ( blend of sea salt, garlic, black pepper, dill seed, coriander, chili pepper) lightly sprinkled it on the filet-added the olive oil and rubbed both into the salmon-Didn't have fresh dill but used fresh  parley, thyme and a small amount of  fresh marjoram. Layed it over the citrus as not to add too much flavor to the fish.   folding the parchment paper, I threaded toothpicks at each corner to secure the seal. Laid  the salmon on a white platter to serve and simply rolled back the parchment paper , added the left over fresh slices of lime, lemon and orange as a garnish and sprinkled pomegranate seeds for color
Served with salad and plain boiled butter potatoes. Wow- all gone!

I wasn't too pleased so will have a go at this recipe another time using fresh salmon. Served with Oven-Roasted Asparagus, Spinach and Spring Mix with Hot Bacon Dressing, and Fresh Rhubarb Pie.

I read what other folks said about not tasting the citrus, so I used a bit of grated peel of the lemon and lime and I did't have fresh oranges so used some dehydrated ones I had, used lots of lemon pepper and it was absolutely phenomenal!  Its a keeper for sure, loved it!  My spouse loves salmon and has had it many many times (pretty much her dish of choice in a restaurant if they offer it) and she adored t!  I had never cooked successfully with parchment so I watched the video referenced on the recipe page and it helped me close the "bag" so it didn't pop open and dry things out!  Very pleased!

My husband was so impressed, and I'm an acclaimed good cook in his mind!  He said it's better than a restaurant.  I didn't have lemons, limes, or oranges....all I had was lemon and lime juices and tangerines.  I sliced the tangerines and sprinkled the other citrus juices when I drizzled the oil and sprinkled with garlic salt and black pepper b/c I was out of lemon pepper.  Fresh dill was great!  I'm glad I followed 1 reviewer's advice and didn't stress about the size and shape of the parchment paper, just made little packages.  Cook time is perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Maybe because I didn't use citrus, it seems 10 minutes would be enough. I also cracked an duck egg in the paper and turned out great!
