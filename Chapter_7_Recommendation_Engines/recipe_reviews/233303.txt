Definitely will be making this again. Just added some extra spices, since I love spicy food. I also boiled the peppers for five minutes and then put them in the oven with all the contents. Saved me some time. This was also good for lunch the next day, so even better!

The peppers were ok but  I did find them a bit  bland . I would prefer to make a pepper recipe that has more ingredients ie. beans.

Delicious!!! I was looking for a stuffed pepper recipe without meat that is still on the healthy side, and this was perfect! The first time I made them, I wrapped the peppers a little too much and they didn't cook enough. The second time, I boiled it for 5 minutes first like another reviewer said, and it was much quicker and cooked perfectly!
