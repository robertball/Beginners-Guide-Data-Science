My husband and I thought this was GREAT! we did a few things differently. In stead of cayenne, I used Pennacook Peppers "Purely Pepper Powder" and added mint flakes to the marinade. Then, instead of baking, we grilled them. It was great and we will definitely make this again!

I was looking for chicken and yogurt dish with more middle eastern flavoring.  This recipe was delicious and easy to make.  I didn't have the fresh oregano and used dried it was fine but next time will use the fresh and boost the flavor.

This was wonderful. Great flavor and easy to make. I paired it with saffron rice and sauteed green beans. Marinating it the night before meant less time in the kitchen and less mess to clean up after company left.

Absolutely delicious!  I have made this recipe 3 times in the last 2 weeks--baked it once, grilled it once, and have a batch marinating to cook tomorrow.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which cook faster than the breasts.  Otherwise, I have used the recipe exactly as it is.  The kids love it!

Loved this dish!! I think I may change out the cumin for curry (and add a little more red pepper ) the next time I make it!

I have made this recipe many times over the years. I use Greek yogurt and sometimes add a pinch of cinnamon. I also leave some of the yogurt marinade on while the chicken bakes.

This was very flavorful and easy to make. I left out the cayenne pepper because some of my kids don't like spicy things and used dried oregano instead of fresh. I'm sure with those two ingredients it would have been even better.
