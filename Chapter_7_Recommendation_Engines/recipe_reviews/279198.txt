Nice sticky buns.  I haven't baked in a while, and this was a good recipe with which to bake again.  The dough is very nice; a little tacky, but easily worked with.  I used the bread machine to make the dough as I'm a walk away type of baker.  The most difficult part of this recipe for me is that my brown sugar was hard so I had to get it out of the container and soften it in the microwave; otherwise, pretty easy.  I didn't oil the pan but didn't need to; the topping, which has butter in it, helped the buns come out easily.  I didn't even notice until after I baked this, served this, and we ate it that the recipe called for a 375 degree oven.  This is where it's handy to know your oven.  Mine always bakes bread and sweets (unless it's pizza or baguettes) on 350, so that's what I set it on.  Perfectly done at 45 minutes.  This is a good recipe, but the dough is a bit plain for us.  I'd maybe add vanilla or cinnamon, but we like a tad more flavor.  Most people would like this as is, I think.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe. I followed the recipe as closely as I could and I’m pretty sure I didn’t do it as well as it could have been done and the results were phenomenal nonetheless. I may have heated the milk and water a little too much in the beginning of the process and stunted the growth of the used a little bit, if that is a thing. I also did not have a suitable metal pan and used stone bakeware. To top it off I somehow made eight rolls instead of 12 and used no pecans. The finished product did not last long enough for a photo to be taken. The whole family love them. Great recipe chef John!

These were absolutely amazing! I've never had a sticky bun with such a soft and delicate dough, but it made all the difference! I only had to bake them for about 25 minutes as they were already at 200F. Thank you for another amazingly delicious recipe, Chef John! As my husband said: Chef John did it again!"

I had to make it twice, because the first time I used almond flour instead of regular all purpose flour. The second time I made then I used wheat flour because all the All Purpose Flour was sold out everywhere. But in the end. The sticky buns can out victorious. I just substitute somethings because my beautiful wife is vegan. So good.

Did not have pecans and admittedly forgot to butter my glass baking dish, but otherwise these came out deliciously! These are sweet and fluffy and I cannot wait to make it again.

YUM!  Not being able to leave home due to the corona virus, I decided to spend the day baking.  I was low on flour so I halved the recipe.  I replaced the pecans with raisins and maraschino cherries that I chopped as that was what I had on hand.   I used an 8" square glass dish.  This was another wonderful recipe!  Thank you Chef John you never let me down!

I followed the recipe exactly except a rounded tsp of cinnamon. I turned oven down to 350 last 8 minutes. 
I’ll make again.

Such an easy recipe and turned out perfect! The only thing I will do different next time is use fewer pecans and double the topping. My family loved them but wanted them even more sticky.

Excellent. Chef John recipes are always easy to understand and follow. Not having a Stand Mixer- made the dough with a wooden spoon and it still turned out great.

We loved them. The dough was really airy. Melted in your mouth. I just used a knife to cut mine and it worked out fine. Unfortunately I don't have a metal 9X13 so I used my metal roasting pan, which is larger, so I made more buns (cut them a little smaller) so they would fill the bottom of my pan.

Very tasty. I had one modification while preparing the dough and will make another modification next time. I only needed about 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 cups of flour total and the dough was tacky, but maybe not quite as sticky as Chef John's. I live in a dry climate, so that might make a difference. The dough came out nice and soft after baking. The one thing I would change right away is that I would try using only 1 tablespoon of sugar in the dough next time, since it was a tad too sweet for me. I baked mine in a ceramic dish and it turned out just fine. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Full disclosure: I forgot the egg, and I used half whole wheat flour. Still, despite that, the rolls were delicious! I will say the sticky part was a little too sweet for my tastes, but I think if I used a regular white sugar and cinnamon mix on the inside, it wouldn't be. I will give it a try, next time I make this  - and next time, I WON'T forget the egg!

Sorry Chef John but wasn't crazy about the buns; hubby asked me to go back to the old recipe: his Grandma's. Dough 100 %, sweetness 100%, ease of making and baking, 100%...taste far too bland. But I love 99% of the recipes from you!!

These were just fantastic. Couple of notes: 

* I didn't have a metal pan, so I used a glass one of similar size. The sizes weren't as high as John's, so I had to be extra careful to put some foil on the rack below to catch drippings

*I cut back the sugar in the filling to 1/2 cup, which I personally enjoyed more. 

* I used a 50/50 split of peacans and walnuts, which was a-okay. They both became deliciously candied in the oven

Something is off with the measurements. 320 g of liquids + butter and egg for 940g of flour. That's low hydration. I put in half the flour and it was almost too much for the cinsistency

Another awesome recipe Chef John! It’s not too sweet, definitely a must try! It’s really important not to dump all the flour at once, 75% is definitely enough.

Chef John , thank you so much for your wonderful recipe! Super Easy and easy to follow with your video. It is so nice to be able to have them in an afternoon...4 hours! I used whole pecans because those who don’t like nuts can pick them off.  Also, I doubled the topping! My family loved them. I also made them 1 1/2 inch , measured... got 15 rolls.

Not bad for a 1sr try. 375F definitely too high for suggested bake time which we shortened by 12 min. The were getting crunchy.  We will try again when these are done.

We did the "sticky" a bit differently, but the dough was per the recipe. Yum!
