Have made this recipe with pink and yellow lemonade, it is the best!!  When I use pink, I add red food coloring to the mix, and when I use regular lemonade, I put yellow food coloring in the mix, it gives the dessert such a pretty color, I also cut lemon really thin, cut it halfway to the center, then pinwheeled it back and set it in the center, so pretty!!! Have made it 4 times, and people ask for it again and again.

My husband got this recipe from somewhere and loves to make it. I think it is good too, but super sweet and rich, I can't eat very much of it. The salted crackers (we use Ritz) make the crust a nice contrast, I think if you used a graham cracker crust it wouldn't be as good because the filling is so sweet.

Excellent recipe!!!   lLight, sweet, refreshing dessert and so very easy to make.   I use it everytime I have a mexican dinner as it refreshes the palate and doesn't weigh you down.   At my last office potluck, they licked the pan clean and asked over and over for the recipe!

I made this for one of our Christmas desserts. The prior reviews of being Rich & Sweet are spot on so if you like super sweet, this is a great recipe. I like sweet and was only able to eat a small piece because of how rich it was...which at Christmas time is probably for the best anyhow. The reason I gave it only three stars is because it was very loose. I made it exactly as the recipe instructed but it doesn't really set up the way I felt it should. I will make it again because it was tasty but I will probably take out 8oz of the S&C milk and replace it with 8oz whipped cream cheese. I think those flavors would be equally as appealing and it would set up more like a dessert and less like a no cook pudding.

FANTASTIC recipe! MAKE SURE YOUR FROZEN concentrate is a 6 oz can........also, the sweetened condensed milk is 14 oz. This sets up perfect, it is very light and fluffy. I do not find it overly sweet at all......Never had it runny and for sure never had it rejected at all by family or freinds. I have made it approximately 15 times without any issues. I also followed one suggestion and used food coloring to make it pretty. It is a great dessert for pot lucks.

This was sooo good but I did make a modification. I used NO sugar in the crust, and I added an 8 oz brick of cream cheese to the filling as suggested by another reviewer (but did not reduce the amount of sweetened condensed milk). The taste is really unusual & excellent. If I had the freezer space I'd freeze it and try it that way :)EDIT: 6/19/09: Made this again without sugar in crust, but this time didn't have a brick of cream cheese. It's very good even without (my recommended) brick of cream cheese. Be SURE you notice that your can of lemonade is probably 12 oz (not 6). I noticed this time, but did NOT notice originally--makes it much more tart if you have accidentally doubled the lemonade! (But tasty either way.)

Yikes!  This was super sweet!  It really started out well, but by the time I served it, it was a bit much.  I would love to try this one again, but am wondering if anyone can clarify the ingredients for me?  Maybe I made a mistake.  1/ I used Minute Maid frozen lemonade concentrate.  Should I have used an unsweetened concentrate?  2/ Sweetened condensed milk is only sold here in 300ml  (apx 8.5 oz) tins, so I had to use almost 2 tins to make up 14oz as specified in the recipe.  Is this the correct amount of s.c. milk?  Any advice would be appreciated!

I made this with the intention of trying it before making it for a party. It was great! My family loved it. They couldn't tell that the crust was made with Ritz crackers. The amazing thing is that I made it two days ago and the crust is still crispy. I expected it to be soggy by now. The party that I tried it for is tonight, Cinco de Mayo. I know my guests will love it. It will be refreshing treat after all of the spicy Mexican food I will be serving. Thanks for sharing your recipe Cindy.

Big hit!!!  So very easy.  My mom always makes lemon icebox pie that tastes just like this, but without meringue and baking.  I don't like meringue too much anyway, so this is the best alternative. Oh and it is very good with pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top.  Thanks.

We thought this was "ok".  My Hubby thought it would be better if I added a package of cream cheese, and I think he is right.  It's not a dessert that I would believe everyone would say WOW about.

The recipe says 9 X 13 pan but if you use the recipe as is that will result in a very thin layer of lemon.  Use the same ingredients but a smaller pan or even a pie plate.  Vanilla wafers are the small round cookies crushed in a food processor.  Also, I added 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice/lemon oil and some food color because it seemed too bland.  I also toyed with the idea of using whipping cream instead of Cool Whip (I usually hate artificial cream!) but time constraints prevailed and I think it turned out fine.  Fruit (strawberries, blueberries) for garnish really adds to the final appearance.  My friends all enjoyed this immensely!

OMG! I love this recipe! I've made it so many times, I can't believe anybody has a hard time with it. The can of lemonade has to be used frozen, don't add water and make it into lemonade. It has to be 6 oz.   I love the salt and the sweet together! My family loves it, I also color the filling like suggested, it is so pretty!

If you like ultra sweet and very tart all in the same bite then this recipe is for you.  I was embarassed serving it at work luncheon.  The dessert appeared to set up in the refrigerater, but when it came time to serve it the consistency was very runny.  I wasn't pleased with this recipe at all.  I would never make it again.

It was a pretty good dessert, but I probably won't use any sugar in the crust next time, as recommended by another user, and maybe add a block of cream cheese to the filling as well. It was really good, but just a little too sweet for my taste...and I like it sweet!

Used 3/4 of the condensed milk, large cool whip, 2 tbls of confectioners sugar with crackers and 3 oz of softened cream cheese as suggested in some reviews.  I also added the yellow food coloring to make it look lemony.  I didn't use the 9x13, instead an 8x8.  It was wonderful!

I  made this recipe with my friends, but since we are from Latin America some of the ingredients are hard to come by. We used the juice of 3 lemons (could have been more but that's what we had) instead of the concentrate, unsweetened milk cream for whipped cream, regular sugar for confectioner's, and Ducales (kinda salty) for grahams. Plus we added half a cup of milk to get a "tresleches" effect. It was amazing! Absolutely recommend, and it has less sugar because it has no whipped cream! :)

I've been making this recipe for MANY years.....if anyone has problems with it not setting up properly....make sure you are using only 6 oz of frozen lemonade. Most of the frozen lemonade around here only comes in 12 oz size and it will not set up....learned this by mistake one time......LOL!!

Yum!  Took this to a pot luck and by the time I got through the line it was GONE.  Will definitely make this again, and it seems like it would be easy to "lighten" up.
