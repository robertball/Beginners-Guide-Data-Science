This was really good as a side dish. After the onions were tender, I used croutons instead of bread crumbs, tossed with cubed tomatoes, and only cooked about 5 min. Not soggy .Great.  Joan

I saw another review that said it was too moist, so I tried cooking it as dry as possible, squeezing the moisture out of the tomatoes and using whole grain bread (not as mushy as white), but it turned out really mushy anyways. It smelled really nice when cooking though.

I like this recipe all except how soggy the bread gets after adding the tomatoes. I think I will try this again adding curry powder to the spices and not cooking the tomatoes.

This is quick and easy and can be made with tomatoes that are blemished.  Try cooking it in a preheated cast iron pan, stirring often. We've never had a problem with soggy bread.
