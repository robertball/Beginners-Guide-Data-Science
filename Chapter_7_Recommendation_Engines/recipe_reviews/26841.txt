I usually don't review any of the recipes from this site. The dish was pretty tasty but too time-consuming for me to make it on a regular basis.

i've never had this type of dish before so i wasn't sure what to expect. the combination of meat vegetables and spices is good (i added a little extra cayenne). the bread is very simple to make as well. for a simple dinner/appetizer this is a good recipe because it's pretty simple.

I haven't tried this yet but it sounds REALLY good. I have a copy in a cookbook called "The Original Baltimore Neighborhood Cookbook" that is very similar. However they call for an equal mix of beef & lamb. Also they do not call for cayenne pepper. Instead they call for 2 cloves of garlic & salt pepper & paprika to taste.

I love this dish. I ate it at a childhood friends house every time I visited. I used refrigerator rolls instead of making biscuits saves some time. It is a big hit in my house!
