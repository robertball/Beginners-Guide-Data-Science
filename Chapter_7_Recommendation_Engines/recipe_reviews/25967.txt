Before I even made this I knew my biggest challenge would be to camouflage the characteristic artificial taste of a yellow cake mix. I used an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and substituted melted butter for the vegetable oil to give it a buttery flavor.  To compensate for the moistness I knew would be lost by using butter, I also added 2 T. of vegetable oil.  I used a full pint of blueberries. Most of that tell-tale cake mix was gone, the butter added rich flavor, the addition of 2 T. of oil contributed the moistness I was after, and the cake was just bursting with plump, fresh blueberries.  I used a specialty, swirled Bundt pan and the cake was just beautiful as well as delicious. I drizzled the cake with a shiny, white glaze of 2 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1 T.corn syrup and 2 T. hot water. A commercial bakery couldn't have turned out a finer cake!

This cake was delicious.  It disappeared quickly.  I used the vanilla cake mix as recommended by previous users.  I also baked at 350 for 55 minutes.  I coat the blueberries with flour before adding to batter.  This keeps them from all falling to the bottom of the cake!  Great Recipe!  I am making again today!

AMAZING recipe. 
I have made this two ways. French Vanilla Mix, 2 cups blueberries, and baked at 350 for about 45 minutes.  I used vanilla glaze recipe from this site, glazed it, and put vanilla shells around the bottom. RAVE reviews.
I also did this adding some cinnamon and 2 cups diced apples (instead of blueberries). I coated the apples in brown sugar, white sugar, flour and nutmeg before adding them to mix. After baking, dusted the top with cinnamon and sugar.

I used egg beaters, fake sugar, fat free cream cheese, and apple sauce in place of the oil.
Even with those 'diet' options, this was still an incredible cake.

A very big hit with the family.  Took the advice of others and used French Vanilla cake mix, increased blueberries to a pint, and baked at 350 for 55 minutes.  Will definitely be making this one again...very simple with excellent results.

I  love this cake, very dense and rich.  I used lemon cake mix (which is a great accent to the blueberries), extra blueberries, and sugard the bundt pan rather than flour.  The only downfall is the presentation.  It doesn't really need a glaze or topping at all, (not even whipped cream), but it needs something to make it more visually appealing.  The next time I make this I'll try a light sprinkle of powdered sugar, hopefully it'll help!  I plan on making this many more times!

Having made this cake a few times over the years, I can say that it's tasty and easy to make. However, it is a stickiness nightmare; removing it from the bowl, spatula, and fingers ends up taking close to the same amount of time as making it. I just don't have the kind of time and patience this cake requires.

I followed the advice of others and this cake was fantastic! I used french vanilla cake mix, coated a pint of blueberries in flour to prevent them from sinking in the batter and I put the oven up to 350 for 30 then covered the bundt with foil and baked an additional 10 minutes.... It was moist & delicious & devoured! I used the recipe for Vanilla Glaze from this site too and sprinked powdered sugar & cinnamon.... perfect coffee cake & after school snack!! I will be trying strawberries next time, thanks for all of the helpful hints!

Delicious and very easy.  I'm eating a warm slice right now as I type up this review.  I baked at 325 for approximately 1 hr. and it came out perfectly.  I haven't iced it at this point and don't believe I will.  This cake stands very well on its own without the extra sweetness an icing would provide.  I'll be making this one again.
By the way, I used a white cake mix and a full pint of blueberries.

Great taste, very moist.  I used a bag of frozen blueberries and it was fine.  Cooked some of the blueberries with the sugar to make a thicker glaze.  (crushed the berries before cooking) I also had to bake the cake 20 min. more than the recipe called for, but it was great.

I've made a few pound cake recipes from scratch, and this recipe does NOT even come close!  Although it is moist, it is light and spongey in texture.  Pound cake is heavy and dense.  You need to use fresh blueberries to if you decide to make this to give flavor.  I did use a french vanilla cake (what I had on hand).  I subbed 1/4 cup of melted butter for the oil.  Make to sure grease and flour the pan very well for it not to stick.

This cake came out fantastic. After reading the reviews, I make these adjustments. I used DH Lemon Cake Mix, 1/3 less fat Cream Cheese, added both 1t vanilla and 1 t lemon juice. Batter was very stiff and allowed for this easily. 2 cups frozen blueberrys, slightly thawed as batter was being prepared. Baked in Bundt pan at 350 degrees for 60 minutes. Checked at 50 minutes and it was definitely not done. Would recommend checking at 55 minutes due to oven variousness. I turned my oven off at 55 minutes and just let it set in oven for another 5 minutes as top was definitely brown. So good my son had a second piece . Very rare for him. I didn't frost as cake speaks for itself.

This blueberry cake was just EXACTLY what I was looking for.  Now mine took a little longer longer to bake than the recipe said but that may have been my oven or my bundt pan.  Excellent

Awesome!  I replaced half of the oil with melted butter and used French vanilla cake mix and a whole pint of fresh blueberries.  My blueberries were pretty evenly distributed but i put about 1/3 of the batter into the pan, then mixed in the berries and added the rest.  It was fantastic.  I think I'll try a lemon cake mix next time.

This recipe was easy to prepare and tasted good. I used a pint of fresh blueberries plus extra berries. Putting the ingredients together was easy. I sprayed my bundt pan with PAM baking spray, poured the batter into the pan and baked it at 325 for the time specified in the recipe. I found that I needed to bake the pound cake a few more, totalling 60 minutes. Next time I will bake at 350 degrees versus 325. The cake was a nice light brown color with bits of blueberries all over. After the cake cooled I finished it off with a glaze instead of dusting it with powdered sugar. GLAZE: 1 cup powdered sugar and juice of fresh lemon.

I should have read the reviews first, this cake took forever to cook.  Next time I will try baking it at 350 like suggested.    The cake was wonderful though.  Thank you!

Very easy and good cake.  I made it with white cake mix since that was all I had, and cooked for 10 minutes more at 350 degrees for the last 10 minutes.  It disappeared fast at work!  Next time I will add lemon zest and cardamon so no one will know it is not from scratch!

This was very good. I didn't add the sugar, only 1/4 cup oil and 2 eggs. Added about 1/2 cup buttermilk as it was very thick. Also added 2 cups blueberries, also took 65 mins at 350 to bake. Would make again but with lemon or orange mix as I felt it was lacking depth. Very moist and a hit with my dinner guests.

Fabulous - plus it's so simple to make! You'd really never know it was a boxed cake - it's that good! It's very moist and bursting with blueberries - what more could you ask for from such a simple recipe! I did opt to use 1/2
cup of melted butter and a couple of Tbsp. of oil. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! This cake is perfect when you don't have time to make a scratch cake but want something that tastes like you did! It baked perfectly in no time at all. Once it was cooled I dusted it with a bit of powdered sugar. Since everyone liked this so much I decided to make another one and changed it up a bit by adding the juice of one lemon, 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract and 2 Tbsp. of lemon zest to heighten the lemon flavor. I can't wait to try this with other fruit combinations!

This was really really good.  I have made it twice now and it was wonderful both times.  I did use 2 cups of blueberries and did coat them with flour.  Also 55 minutes was exactly the right amount of time in the oven.  Oh, and I also used the vanilla glaze recipe from this site.  Thanks to other posters for these suggestions.  This cake could win a contest!  It looked so pretty and tasted wonderful!  Thanks again!

I made this cake this past weekend for some visitors from out of town. The cake was good, but not great. For as quick and easy as the recipe is, it turned out well. The name "pound cake" really isnt true because this came out too light and fluffy (just like a regular yellow cake would).  I used fresh blueberries as recommended. The batter is awfully thick and I was a little skeptical when putting it in the bundt pan, but it turned out much better than I thought.
I might make this again if I need something quick, but otherwise I will be looking for a recipe that really is more of a pound cake texture.

This cake is delicious!!!  I have made it several times and everyone who's tasted it thought it was delicious also.  Several people have asked me for the recipe.  They can't believe it when I tell them how easy it is to make.  I make my glaze with a little bit of blueberry juice and it looks so pretty.

Amazing! This recipe is so decadent and rich tasting. I made it to use as a dessert, but after tasting it I realized that it would be much better as a coffeecake for breakfast. This recipe tastes so much more complicated than it is! I used extra blueberries, but I think 1 1/4 cups would be just fine. I also added more vanilla extract. We ate this for three days and heated individual servings in the microwave to make this even more scrumptious :o) This cake is great and I will be making it many times in the future. I had two peope ask me for a copy of this recipe!

I made this cake today, and it's very moist and is delicious. I did flour the blueberries as I read to try that in one of the reviews.
I may try putting a lemon glaze on the cake next time, though it really doesn't need it. I also thought of maybe trying the same recipe with a lemon cake mix, since blueberries and lemon flavor go well together.
Either way, I would definitely make this again. It was easy to make and a good way to use up the blueberries I had on hand.

Baked this for a church dinner.  Turned out very nice.  However, it was not done at 45 minutes.  I baked it for another 10 at 355 - this did the trick.  I used vanilla cake mix, egg beaters, and light cream cheese.  Next time I might also substitute applesauce for the oil.

Excellent easy cake. I used a vanilla cake mix for this and a whole pint of blueberries. I used the sugar to coat the blueberries before adding so they did not sink to the bottom. I also mixed the eggs/cr. cheese/oil/vanilla together to blend and then added the cake mix so everything blended well together and then beat  for the 4 minutes. I baked a full 55 minutes in a bundt pan. I have been asked to make this again soon.

Delicious!  If you like blueberry muffins, you will love this cake.  The only thing I did differently was I used a pint of fresh blueberries which I tossed in 2 tbsps. of flour, so the blueberries would not sink to the bottom.  The blueberries were dispersed evenly throughout the cake.  I also used a 10 inch tube pan.   I baked it at 325 degrees for an hour.

Wonderfully moist cake. I left out the sugar as some of the others did. Definitely was sweet enough without it. I tossed the blueberries with some of the dry cake mix before adding them, but actually the batter was so thick I'm not sure that was necessary. I used a little cinnamon sugar in the bottom of the pan as mentioned in another review before adding the batter and didn't have any problem with the cake sticking. It easily fell out of the pan after cooling for 10 minutes. I alternated layers of batter and blueberries as I filled the pan rather than folding them into the batter. Made a glaze of 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla and enough lemon juice to make a glaze consistency. Turned out beautifully. A definite keeper.

Great desert for after a BBQ!! I bought some blueberries because they were on sale and then, I didn't know what to do with them! I used some in a fruit salad for the family BBQ, and then I found this recipe and realized I actually had everything I needed on hand (well, except the bundt pan, so I an used angel food cake pan, which turned out just the same). This cake was very, very easy to make and came out perfectly moist, with just the right amount of lightnes and sweetness to top off the burgers that we gorged ourselves on. I followed the recipe exactly but I did have to cook it a little bit longer, but that may have been due to my mother-in-law's oven, not the recipe. Without even having a glaze, this cake disappeared in an instant--didn't even make it to plates, everyone just ate it right out of their hands, barely even dropping a crumb! Terrific!

We love this cake.  I followed some suggestions of other reviewers and I used vanilla cake mix, substituted a stick of softened butter for oil, added zest of 1 lemon, and used 1 pint of berries.  It took 65 minutes to bake.

I wouldn't call this a pound cake as the consistency is much lighter than that.  But it's definitely delicious!  I wish my bundt pan would have released it more nicely--most of my berries sunk to the bottom despite following the advice of one by rolling them in flour.  So mine doesn't look that terrific, but it sure tastes good.  I'm sure I'll have no complaints at work tomorrow.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!

Very good cake, really not a pound cake as it is too light and moist for that.

Rather than add a glaze on top of the cake, I added some cinnamon to the cake batter.  This made the cake  have a little more flavor and goes nicely with a cup of tea or coffee. The cream cheese gave this cake a nice background flavor and I expect this cake would be good with any kind of berry in it.
The cooking time was off. I had to cook it for 55 minutes and if I ever make this again, I think I will stick with a cake mix without the pudding in it, it just took a really long time to bake.

This tasted fine, it just wasn't anything very special. It was a nice recipe to use up the excess blueberries I had and the cream cheese did add a small background flavor to it. But it still was a mix with stuff in it.. not awful. Just not stellar.

This was a very moist delicious cake.  The cream cheese lends a very subtle background taste.  The blueberries I had were sweet, so I cut back on the sugar to half of what was called for. It was still a little too sweet for me.   Next time, assuming I have very sweet berries, I will cut out the sugar all together.  I did have to cook for an extra 20-30 mins covered with foil, so I would highly recommend using the other suggestions of a higher temp.  I also added chopped walnuts to the top of half of the cake, while it was still warm.  I then topped that same half with a lemon glaze.  The other half I left plain for my son and hubby if he didn't like my additions.  All in all this is a great recipe and I will be making it again.  Thanks for posting it!

I took this to a pot luck for fathers day and boy oh boy was it a hit!! Everyone loved it. I made Vanilla glaze for it (also from this site) and added some blue and red food colouring. I drizzled it on the top and added a few blue berries for garnish. Sooooo pretty and delicious too!!

This cake was very moist and pretty tasty, but really didn'taste much more special than a box cake with blueberries thrown in it (and I used the recommended vanilla cake mix).  The crowd was fond of it though.

This cake is divine!!  My husband had three pieces of cake for dessert(he is not a sweet lover!).  I also added a lemon cream cheese glaze for the top of the cake, delicious! Also had to cook the cake for an extra 15 min with foil on top.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Good summer take-along cake; turned out well with a few changes suggested by others (using French vanilla cake mix and baking at 350 for 45 minutes). V. thick batter; more blueberries would have been fine. I sprinkled the cake with a cinnamon/sugar mix when it was still hot for a little extra flavor.

The taste was just what I was looking for.  TO keep the blueberries from sinking to the bottom (or top, once you invert it), I mixed 2 cups of berries with about 2 Tbsp of reserved cake mix.

I don't know what went wrong but this cake is a COMPLETE disaster! Only thing I did different than the recipe stated is I used a lemon cake mix instead of a yellow one and I used a bit more blueberries (2 cups). This cake took an hour to bake (close to it anyway) and when I took it out of the pan it STILL wasn't cooked. I put it on a cookie sheet and put it back in the oven. 
I will NEVER make this again. What a waste of perfectly delicious berries. I've never been so disappointed. I wouldn't even give this recipe a 1 never mind 5.

I agree with naples34102, the yellow cake mix is just too artificial tasting. I made the recipe as is and it was just okay, because of the cake mix.

Wow!  This cake was so easy and soooo delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and topped it with a vanilla cream cheese glaze.  Everyone that tasted it absolutely loved it!  I had so many compliments.  The cream cheese gives the cake a very distinct flavor and perfect texture!  I will definitely make this many, many more times!

I was really nervous about how this cake was going to turn out because it did take much longer to bake than directed, and the outside was really brown.  However, the inside was moist and delicious!  My grocery store does not carry lemon cake mixes for some reason, so I used French vanilla.  I also substituted 1/2 cup melted butter and a couple tablespoons of oil as another reviewer suggested, and I tossed the blueberries in flour before adding.

Excellent mix-based pound cake. I used 2 cups of blueberries, otherwise followed recipe exactly. I did have to bake it quite a bit longer than the recipe called for - about 1 hr 10 min @ 350. I'll be using this recipe again!

This was OK. It still tasted like a mix, but was heavier/denser like a pound cake.

I'm a major oinker when it comes to cake so for me to say that I loved it and ate half the cake is not that big of a deal.  However, my husband doesn't usually care for cake, and even he ate two huge slices.  We both loved it.  After the 45 minutes of baking time, I ended up turning the oven way down and letting it bake for almost another half hour, the outside of the cake was a little bit crispy and the inside was super moist.  Will be making this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent but quick to make recipe!  Like others, I have made this a couple of ways and both are great.  The first using a french vanilla cake mix and the second using a lemon cake mix and substituting 1/4 t lemon extract for the vanilla extract.  I also iced it with a powdered sugar glaze using additional lemon extract for flavor.  Terrific!!

This was very good, but nothing spectacular (I couldn't really taste the cream cheese, even though it was very moist).  I did use a lemon cake mix and fresh blueberries - I also created a glaze with lemon extra as one reviewer had recommended - and the trick with greasing and putting sugar in the pan (instead of flour) was great!

I don't give bad reviews very often, but this cake just didn't work for me. First of all, the cooking time is definitely wrong--45 minutes might be ok if you bake it at 350 but at 325 it needed more like 60 or 70 minutes.  Also it does have a cake mixey taste and I used the French vanilla cake mix.  My kids ate it but I didn't like it at all.

First time I made this it was a total disaster.The cake just wouldn't cook.
Second time, I bought a yellow cake mix with much less pudding in it, only 1/2 cup.  I raised the oven temp to 350 degrees. I let it cook for 1 hour and 5 minutes.  
Now that I got through the quirks, this will be a regular, as my toddler can't get enough!

My husband says this is the BEST blueberry anything he's ever had! I used the Golden Vanilla cake mix, lite cream cheese, applesauce instead of oil and Splenda instead of sugar. I also added an extra 1/4 cup bluberries. WOW!!!! I also had to bake an extra 20 minutes before done. May try at 350 degrees next time?

I tried this recipe for the first time with French Vanilla cake mix, and I'll never do it any other way.  Absolutely delicious!  Also, I baked the cake at 350 degrees for 40 mins (not 325 degrees).

This is a super easy recipe...I will agree.  I mean what can be easier than using a mix!!  But as far as flavor this recipe leaves as lot to be desired.  I love cake mix based recipes but the issue with using a yellow cake mix is covering up that yellow cake mix flavor which is VERY noticeable with this recipe.  The cake turned out fine but wasn't one worth talking about because to me it just tasted like a yellow cake mix with blueberries added.  I feel like I wasted my blueberries on this one....  If you can find a way to "mask" the cake mix taste then definitely try this one, otherwise pick another recipe.

I thought this was quite good.  I was about to make it when I realized that my daughter had gotten into the block of cream cheese.  I only had about 5 oz left.  I asked on the recipe buzz for suggestions and ended up adding about 3T of sour cream to it to compensate for the missing cream cheese.  I was a bit surprised at how thick the batter was.  I could not "pour" it into the pan, I had to spread it in the pan.  I ended up baking it about 45-50 minutes.  Was very good, and was gone within 1 day.  (I did not coat my fresh blueberries with flour as the batter was so thick, I thought it would be fine.  It was.)

great taste--but the cake is nowhere near done in 45 minutes.  A little over an hour at 325, and the slower bake time adds to the sogginess of the berries.

Revamped, it would make a great recipe.  Due to appearance, I left it at home, and did not take it anywhere.

This is a nice cake if you don't feel like starting completely from scratch.  It lacks the density of a pound cake, but isn't as light textured as an undoctored cake mix.  It doesn't rise a whole lot, either, making it a fairly small cake.  I took some reviewers suggestion and used a lemon cake mix, and I dusted it with powdered sugar when it was cool.  I used nearly 2 cups of frozen blueberries that I dusted with flour while they were still frozen, hoping they wouldn't sink into a gooey mess at the bottom of the pan.   They remained well dispersed in the batter.   The cake required more time than stated in the recipe.  Good cake.

Delicious cake1. I used  a French vanilla cake mix, added both vanilla and almond extract with some fresh lemon zest.  Sprinkled finished cake with a little powdered sugar.  It,s delish and a breeze to whip up!

Wonderfully moist! I saved a little of the cake mix to toss the blueberries in before adding them to the batter. I used frozen berries that I picked last summer. Used lemon extract instead if vanilla and baked the cake for 60 min and it was perfect.

This was such a great recipe!  I did swap out applesauce for the oil, but with the looooong mixing time, it was still not too dense.  It was just a little too sweet for my taste, so I will probably leave out the extra sugar next time.  I even used reduced sugar yellow cake mix and it was still very sweet.   Great recipe for brunch or dessert!

Instead of yellow cake mix I substituted lemon cake mix then followed the recipe as written.  My family prefers the lemon taste.  I've made it many times for family and to take to church dinners as dessert.  Always a hit with everone.

I just made this pound cake, and we couldnt even wait for it to completely cool off before we tried it! It smelled so delicious cooking in the oven! My 3 yr old is already on his 2nd piece! I've already sent this recipe to 2 friends, and I know they'll be more requests for it once I start telling everyone how good and moist it was! I made it with a lemon cake mix, only because thats what I had on hand, and that was the only thing I changed. I also sprayed the bunt pan, then sprinkled a couple tsps of regular sugar in there and tapped it around to coat the pan. Made a delicious sweet crust on top. Then I made a blueberry glaze to drizzle on top out of 1 c. of confectioners sugar and 2 tbsp's of the juice I drained from the blueberries. Definitely a keeper! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Very tasty and so simple. I have made this several times and I have alternated between yellow ans white cake. Recently I have tried lemon cake and it was wonderful. I do add a little more blueberry (2 cups) and I also coat them with a little flour so, they don't sink to the bottom.

I made this as the 'grown-up' cake for my daughters birthday party- only change I made was that I used a lemon cake mix (didn't have a plain yellow). It turned out wonderful and moist but not too heavy.  I also used frozen berries and served with a mixed berry topping as opposed to a frosting.

Yeah, I know- some of you DON'T like the reviews where someone gives it 5 stars and changed the recipe, but I love it. I always read all the reviews and make changes if there is a consensus or if I like the idea. I used a lemon cake mix as lemon and blueberry really compliment each other well. I used 1/4 c. oil and 1/4 c. butter. I added 2 TBSP of sour cream to help with moistness. I added another tsp of vanilla. I also did coat my blueberries with flour to prevent sinking. I put a lemon glaze on it afterward and it was absolutely mouth-watering delicious! Yum!

This was so good! I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. The blueberries I used were frozen and I baked it for about 63 minutes at 325 degrees (350 for the last 10). Great recipe and will definitely make again!

wonderful!!! I used white cake mix and followed the rest exactly as is... It is great.. Went blueberry picking yesterday and  was looking for some recipes that I can keep together for each yr when we pick.. and this is one of those.. Had to bake 10 minutes longer though. May add 1/2 cup extra blueberries next time

Love this recipe!  I used butter instead of oil and added a 1/4 cup plain yogurt for moistness and used a full pint of blueberries.  I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for but I think that was due to my changes.  The girls at work ate it up and DH said it was like a giant dessert blueberry muffin.

My husband and I loved this cake! Great for breakfast, dessert or any time. Like the other reviewers I used butter instead of oil. And instead of a regular yellow cake mix, I used a "butter recipe" yellow cake mix. I also added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. It came out moist but still with the density of a pound cake.

I was looking for a recipe so I could use up some of last years crop of blueberries.I could not have found a better one. I am making a second one tomorrow. The only change was the way I mixed it. I first creamed the cream cheese, then added all the other ingredients and mixed til smooth. Then I added the cake mix and mixed on low until blended well. I can't say this way is any better than the original recipe, because I haven't tried that way. I do know this is an excellent cake though. The fresh taste of the blueberries against the creamy richness of the cake cannot be described; you have to taste it for yourself.

I substituted the oil for 1 stick of non-salted butter plus 2 T of canola oil, and I increased the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons. I, too, followed the suggestions of others and dusted the blueberries in flour.  It turned out FANTASTIC!  My kids don't like fresh blueberries, but they gobbled this cake up in minutes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I used Lemon cake mix, butter instead of oil and extra blueberries. I work with people who bake alot and this was a hit. My husband's coworkers also loved the one I sent with him. Used the Vanilla glaze which was perfect for this. It did need longer baking but that's not a problem. I baked just until toothpick came out clean. Easy, practically foolproof and very adaptable to types of cake mix and flavorings. Update: We tried this with vanilla/white cake mix. Really preferred the lemon cake mix.

This cake was delicious but it stuck to the pan which affected its appearance.  I would make this again but use wax or parchment paper to prevent sticking.

I found this recipe to be quite satisfying. The cake did not rise very much, but that may be due to the fact that I used a "pudding-in-the-mix" golden vanilla cake mix. I used the amount of blueberries called for, and I dusted them in two tablespoons of flour before folding into the batter. They were beautifully suspended in the cake. I believe the cream cheese masked the cake mix taste, and I found the texture of the cake to be much like that of a scratch-made pound cake! 
I agree that some combination of increased baking temp and time are necessary. Next time I will try it starting at 350degrees. Enjoy!

For me, this did not live up to expectations.  It had the taste and texture of a  "mix" cake, even a bit more wet and sticky than usual.  I'm glad others have enjoyed it, but I consider it a waste of cream cheese and blueberries.

Very delicious cake, however, I agree that the oven should be at 350 degrees.  Center was not cooked at 325 degrees after 45 minutes.  Increased the time and baked an additonal 12 minutes and it was just fine.

I think that 325 degrees is a typo; it should bake at 350 for 40-45 min. as it states on every cake box.  Recipe was ok.  I added 1/2 t. cinnamon and confectioner's suger glaze.  I think I'd just like to make a blueberry pie instead but I like blueberries!

Wonderful - have used this base recipe for all kinds of variations: vanilla and raisins, lemon and blueberries, even added apricot brandy with no fruit for a plain but devilishly good pound cake.

This cake was absolutely delicious, and didn't last long!  I used a white cake mix (not a big vanilla fan) and extra blueberries and it was wonderful!!  Drizzled with cream cheese icing and it looked as impressive as it tasted.  Everyone thought I bought it from a bakery!  Trying with raspberries next.  Thanks for a new favorite!!

A keeper for sure!  I made this using the french vanilla cake mix & 2 cups of blueberries as suggested in previous reviews to take to a brunch.  It was very moist and rich enough without adding frosting or glaze.  The cream cheese gives this recipe a nice flavor. Several people asked me to give them the recipe.  This is a great one to serve as a coffe cake or dessert.

Wonderful taste.  Cream cheese adds a subtle flavor.  A friend made a fruit sauce that went so great with the cake.  It had strawberries and apples.  I used blackberries instead of blueberries and it turned out delicious.  I would make this again.

I have made this for several friends and relatives and they have all asked for the recipe.  They cannot believe how easy it is to make and how incredibly delicious it is.  My family is not usually big on blueberries, but this cake is gone in about an hour.  Definitely stock up on blueberries when in season and freeze them so you can make this all year long!!

This wasn't quite as good as I'd hoped it would be... if I make it again, I'll take the advice of others and use vanilla cake mix.  I'm afraid, though, that it just tasted like normal cake with blueberries in it, and the cream cheese wasn't very noticeable.

Served this absolutely wonderful cake on Father's Day (my husband loves blueberries).  Everyone raved and all asked to take some home.  Great with coffee the next morning.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used the french vanilla cake mix...will continue to use this.  I sprinkled top of cake with powdered sugar...made a nice topper.

This was excellent, has a great texture, even after I substituted applesauce instead of the cooking oil, for a "close to" fat-free version.

I loved this cake. Just as is and with my own tweaks. I used white cake mix as it tastes the least like boxed.  I added an extra egg yolk,3/4 C flour,1/2 C of sugar,1 C skim milk,2 tsp vanilla,1/2 stick very soft butter and 1/3 C oil. Mixed dry ingredients. Beat cream cheese,butter and sugar. Added eggs one at a time. Added oil and vanilla. Added dry ingredients alternately with milk and vanilla.  Greased and sugared pan. Layered blueberries as suggested. As everyones oven bake as needed till done.  Perfect cake.  Thank you prissycat!

I followed it like many reviewers did, using lemon cake mix and applesauce instead of oil. I thought it was still kind of dry. Maybe I should use one of the recipes that adds the pudding to the batter too. Not bad, and leaving out the sugar actually made it kind of bland. I will try again, but with more tweaks.

Great and easy! I used frozen blueberries- didn't measure just threw some in! Was enjoyed by all at our weekly married bible study and by me for breakfast this morning :)  I think I will try this with a vanilla or lemon cake mix next time.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and it came out super moist and yummy.  The only thing different I did was add a few sprinkles of cinnamon to the batter before baking.  I also used lowfat cream cheese.  I ate it with vanilla ice cream.  My only question is whether anyone would recommend refridgerating it to make it last longer or would that ruin the taste?

Really good.  It would be bad to eat it for breakfast with all the sugar, but it is great for a lunchtime dessert for a fancy occasion, especially with the sugar crust from "flouring" the pan.

Just made this cake and it turned out great! I had to eat two slices!  I did bake it for 10 minutes longer and did not add the extra sugar.  It was sweet enought without it.  It was very easy and I will definitely try it again.  Thanks for sharing...this is my very first review on this site.  yummy!

Wonderful tasting cake, took some of the other reivewers advice and used french vanilla cake mix (loved the flavor!) added whole pint of blueberries, which was way too much for me, also used 1/2 cup margarine in place of oil, then added two tablespoons of oil for moistness.  Did not put any sugar, and was sweet enough.  Will make again for sure, thanks .

I've been making this recipe for over 2 years.  People ask me to make it all the time.  In fact, my daughter insists I should make them and sell them. Everyone loves the blueberry but this weekend I decide to try something new.  Instead of using the yellow mix  I used a white cake and instead of blueberries I diced up some fresh strawberries.  My mom liked it better than the blueberry, my daughter said every bit as much.  Grandkids ate 2 pieces each!

This is AWESOME!  I'm not big on blueberries, but had some to use.  I made a glaze to go on it, but decided to put on side because it was so moist.  This is a keeper.  Didn't change a thing.

I thought it was perfectly fine the way the recipe was. I had no problems with blueberries sinking to the bottom, but I did use fresh blueberries. (I'm thinking maybe they people that had problems with them sinking used frozen blueberries).  I did have to cook it for longer.. about 50-55 minutes or so.  I made the vanilla glaze from this website to put on top, but I'm not sure it really needed it. Maybe just some powdered sugar on the top to make it pretty like someone else suggested.

I used a white cake mix and followed others suggestions of additional vanilla and melted butter.  It was tasty and easy but still tasted like a cake mix with blueberries in it.  I would make it again if I needed a quick dessert (as I did tonight!)

The cake was very dense and moist, absolutely delicious. Only change I made was to make a glaze out of lemon juice, lemon zest and powdered suger. While the cake was still a bit warm I used a pastry brush to coat it with several layers of the glaze. Turned out great, the lemon was a nice compliment to the blueberries. Also didn't think it needed the 1/4 cup of sugar. Will be leaving it out next time.

This is the best recipe I've found on this website.  Unbelievably yummy, this moist cake has great texture, and the fresh burst of blueberries plus my addition of lemon zest make it fabulous.  Company devoured it!  It's a keeper, especially because of the cake mix shortcut, when you need to make something quick!

I followed the recipe and one reviewers advice to let it sit a day befor slicing it.  It did not have a pound cake texture and also tasted very much like a cake mix to me.  I won't be making this one again.

This pound cake is the best yet!! I made 3 in 2 days and divvied it out to my neighbors. Like everyone else I had to bake it 10 minutes longer. I won't change anything in it because I love it as it is!! well.... I am off to pick more blueberries at the farm down the road...yum!

I made this recipe for the first time for a bake sale today, out of everything there this cake went the fastest.  I never made this one so I took my chances and it was a huge success.  We are planning to have another bake sale next week and I plan to make atleast 3 of these.  I followed another review and tossed the blueberries in flour before tossing them into the batter and they were evenly distributed troughout the cake when it was baked.  Wish I would have taken a picture.  This was a very moist and delicious cake recipe.  Thanks.

Sooooo Easy! Made it 3X for incoming groups doing mission work. I did take the adice of on reviewer and coated the berries in flour and they were evenly distributed throughout. I did use a cream cheese glaze on one of the cakes because I was making a carrot cake and had some frosting left, but it is just as good without frosting. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe for the first time last year for my Son's Birthday.  I used the suggestion made about the french vanilla cake mix and flouring the blueberries before folding them into the batter.  The cake was amazing and everyone loved it!  Today is my son's 7th birthday and he asked me to make him the blueberry cake again! I can't wait to serve it up to everyone!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Well!  you did it.  You got my sweet husband to love blueberries.  I made this cake for our son's birthday dinner (I knew they liked b'berries) and it was a huge hit!  Thank you.  PS I only had 4 oz cream cheese so just added a bit of water.  and only powdered sugar sprinking. I have to add, Ihad a picture with my son and his wife with this cake I wish I had submitted.  I have made this 4 times since and everyone wants more and more and more.

it is an awesome cake! I did not add the 1/4 cup sugar and i did not add the glaze. It was nice without the added sweetness. My husband and son are not lovers of sweet/rich deserts. I added a pint of blueberries and they were sweet so it turned out perfect. I will make this again.

I made this recipe with all the adjustments that people suggested:

-rolled blueberries in flour/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture
-added cinnamon
-Traded butter for Oil and then added 2 T. canola for texture.

I made them in a muffin tin and they slide right out if you butter and flour the tin well. About 22 minutes or until they're golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean. My family loves them and my boyfriend eats them like skittles. Definitely a recipe to try.

To me, this tasted mostly like a yellow cake with blueberries added.  Not a bad taste, but not what I was hoping for either.

I used butter cake instead of yellow. My family has inhaled 4 of these cakes in 2 weeks.  I also used frozen blueberries which I had to thaw and drain so the cake wouldn't be too wet. This recipe is delicious!

Wonderful!!!!!!!!! Very moist & dense. I used lemon cake mix and loved this cake. I glazed it with apricot preserves. Yum  Second attempt was as even better than first. I subbed all lowfat ingredients: 6 egg whites, 1/2 c applesauce, left out extra sugar.

I'm giving this 4 stars for flavor & overall appeal, however - I think the bake time needs tweaked. I followed the recipe to the letter & in a 325 degree oven, 45 minutes did not cut it. It was golden brown & looked done - even when I tested with a toothpick it came out clean - but after 10 minutes cooling in the pan, I flipped it onto a cooling rack per the instructions & half the cake fell through the rack. It was a complete MESS and I was so upset. I slid the pan back down over the cake, flipped it, placed the collapsed pieces back into the pan & thought about naming it "Blueberry Mess". Not to be outdone by a cake, I upped the temperature to 350, and baked it for an additional 25 minutes. I let it cool in the pan overnight & when I took it over to my parents' house the next day, I flipped it onto a plate & you'd have never known the dilemma I'd dealt with. It looked beautiful & tasted AMAZING. 

Next time I make this, I will bake at 350 for at least 50-60 minutes.

Used lemon cake mix.  Absolutely fabulous!  I sprinkled sugar in my bundt and a small bit of flour.  Only had 1 cup of frozen blueberries.  By time I got them in the mix, they were very defrosted.  The cake turned out moist with a nice "crust" on the outside.  Will make again and again.

This was so good! I made some changes tho. I only had a trader joe's vanilla flavored cake mix and used only 2 eggs. I also used 1/3 C sugar and added cinnamon to the batter. Dusted the bottom of the bundt pan with sugar and cinnamon and poured the batter on top. When it was done I made a lemon icing! It was so good my husband couldnt stop eating it.

I made this cake tonight for a family dinner and everyone really enjoyed it.  I did add 1 ripe banana, that I needed to use, to the batter and sprinkled the cake with powdered sugar before serving.  Will definately make again.

This was an incredibly moist cake...perfect for summer.  I omitted the sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I baked this one in a shaped bundt pan.  Then I made a glaze with powdered sugar, milk, and lemon zest.  Once the cake cooled, I drizzled it over the top and served.  You could use frozen blueberries in a pinch, but fresh ones are best.

Fantastic! It did take a little bit longer to bake (about 10 minutes), but you will not a find an easier or yummier cake. I sprinkled mine with a little powdered sugar, but it would have been just as good without it. Thanks for the great recipe!!

If you live in NJ during the summer, it seems as though its a requirement to make something with blueberries as a dessert. This cake is UNBELIEVABLY moist and tasty. Just a suggestion- after about 45 minutes I covered my cake so it wouldn't get overly brown on top. It worked. Everyone loved it. A fight between a younger woman and and 80 year old woman almost broke out for the last piece.

Good cake but didn't have a pound cake consistency. Also, per other reviews cooked at 350 for about 45 minutes and used about 2 cups of blueberries. I also use sugar instead of flour when preparing the bundt pan. You don't get that flour film on your cake this way. Thanks for the recipe. Will make again.

I tried this recipe using my pound cake recipe as a base.  I bake from scratch as I don't like the taste of store bought cake mix.  The cake came out great!  I bake it at 350 degrees in a cathedral style bundt pan.  The cake was nice and moist, and not too sweet.  I used fresh strawberries, since that is what I had on hand.  Perfect for breakfast with a cup of coffee.  The cathedral style made the cake impressionable.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

The core of this recipe is so fantastic that I've taken it and instead of blueberries I've done other things.  The blueberries were wonderful!  For fun I tried subing in guava puree for the oil (cuts out fat and adds flavor), and adding in raspberries.  Chocolate thips were great too.

This was an easy recipe!  As suggested by other reviewers, I increased the oven temp. to 350 and baked for 45 minutes and it came out perfectly.  I also omitted the 1/4 cup sugar.  This cake is not a very sweet cake and it has a mild cream cheese taste.

This cake is perfect. I did add about 3 oz. of vanilla pudding mix and more blueberries. I also baked it in a 13x9-inch baking dish, since I don't have a bundt pan. I baked it at 325 for 30 minutes and then increased the temperature to 350 and baked it for the remaining 10-15 minutes. This cake tastes very good and was a great way to use up the blueberries I had. Thanks, Carol!

Yum! We enjoyed this very much. The only thing I'd change is to add more blueberries next time. I added a powdered sugar/milk/vanilla glaze on top, which made it even better.

I thought this recipe was just average.  It was simple, thats for sure.  Maybe I am more of a chocolate person.  I would make it again for a work function or something like that, but not for my family.

While this recipe WAS tasty, it wasn't spectacular, even a little dry.  Perhaps it was because I used white cake mix instead of yellow?  At any rate, I don't think I'll be making it again.

This cake was fantastic!!  So moist and sweet.  Even my mom, who's not a sweet eater, had two pieces and asked for the recipe.  Per others' suggestions, I used a pint of blueberries and baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.

Delicious, moist, and very yummy!  Easy to make, freezes well and is great with vanilla ice cream on top. I used the French Vanilla Cake mix as suggested. This cake cooked in the alloted time noted on the recipe...55 minutes.  I suggest you start checking after 50 minutes. I think I will try dried apricots diced next.

I added two cups of blueberries and used the French Vanilla cake mix.  It definitely took over 40 minutes, even at 350.  I would suggest cooking it for a little over an hour.  I was very impressed with the moistness of the cake and blueberry taste.

I made this cake and a friend served it at a family get together yesterday.  It disappeared in a hurry once someone tasted it and said how good it was.  I just made a copy of the recipe to pass along to the people who were there.  It was a great tasting cake, especially since I love anything with blueberries in it. Thanks!!

This cake was wonderful!  One person said, "This cake is so good that I can't stop eating it!"  I used frozen blueberries instead of canned, and it was fine.  I plan to make this again very soon.

I made this using a lemon cake mix but it didn't taste/feel like a pound cake, just a regular cake, extra dense.  The flavor was good, but the texture was off.

Used Duncan Hines Butter Recipe cake mix.  I used 1 stick unsalted butter, 1 T oil, 2 eggs,  1 extra  t. vanilla and 3/4 cup water (batter was thick).  Remember to use a bit of the cake mix to coat your blueberries.  Cake came out delish without glaze.

This is an awesome recipe. It is so easy to make. I made it almost as written but used a lemon cake mix and zested a lemon and then added the zest and juice which I mixed in the batter after all else was combined. I beat it for four minutes and it was the perfect consistency.  I coated my frozen blueberries in flour and added them last I sprinkled them over the batter and ever so gently folded them in. I sprayed my pan with spray and sprinkled sugar on instead of flour. I so want to try this with other berries.

Super easy to make. I coated my fresh blueberries in flour after rinsing them off so they wouldn't stink to the "bottom" I'll probably layer the blueberries with the batter next time to get a more even blueberry ratio. Definitely will be using this recipe for my Daughters next birthday cake!

After making this cake i was indecisive as to whether or not i wanted to make a drizzle. (I made it pretty late at night) Having no control I absolutely had to try it, and to my surprise it was moist & delicious. In my opinion, it really didn't need an icing. Not to say one wouldn't take it to the next level, no doubt it will.

I'm not much of a baker, but this recipe made me look like a star!!!  Delicious and gorgeous.  Friends loved it and couldn't get enough.  Followed the recipe but modified with suggestions from other reviewers.  Baked at 350, covered top loosely with foil and continued baking for another 10 minutes.  Lightly coated blueberries with flour (used two cups of BB, which is a bit more than than the recipe called for).  Mixed eggs / cream cheese / oil & butter mixture  / vanilla together then added to cake mix.  (substituted 1/2 cup melted butter and 2 Tbs oil for 1/2 cup oil).  Sprayed bundt pan  with cooking spray.  Let cake cool thoroughly before removing from pan (fell right out). Thank you for this wonderful recipe and thanks to all the reviewers for their  excellent suggestions.

Made this last minute when a coworker gave me blueberries from her garden.  I used a Betty Crocker Super Moist cake mix because that's what was available at the corner store. I increased the berries to 1 1/2 cups. My oven is accurate, but I had to bake this an extra 10 minutes. It turned out beautifully. I added a simple confectioner sugar glaze to dress it up. It was a hit at our coffee hour at church. Will definitely be making it again. It's a very moist cake and I think it would probably freeze well.

I made this with a gluten free cake mix (my husband has Celiac disease) and it turned out great!  Nice and moist - which is unusual for gf cakes.  So easy to make!

Everyone loved it at work!

I did cut some of the cream cheese out and added a lemon yogurt and some lemon juice.  It came out super moist.

I made this using a lemon cake mix and followed the directions pretty much to a tee. I did add some lemon extract as well as the vanilla. I also only added a tbsp.of sugar instead of a 1/4 cup. I'll be making a lemon glaze for it. All and all a darn good cake! Thank you!

I used " super moist" lemon cake mix otherwise as written. I made it in a bundt  pan and then filled the hole with blueberries and dusted with confection sugar. GONE!

This is wonderful. Pay attention to cake mix size...I had to add two additional 2oz to cake mix. I added homemade lemon curd as topping when served.

Very good. A quick easy cake to make.  I mixed the blueberries with a little flour before adding in to batter so they wouldn't sink.    A nice cake to make during blueberry season

Excellent cake! I took the recommendations of others and floured the blueberries, and also baked at 350 for 50 minutes. I also topped it with the Vanilla Glaze from this site. No other modifications made. My family gobbled it up!

I've made this for years! I use a butter golden cake mix. But the French vanilla sounds really good! I've also use mini loaf pans to use for gift giving. Freezes well too!

While you really can taste the cake mix its not too bad. I think it could use more berries ( I used 2 cups frozen )and a little cinnamon helped too. Overall pretty good had a nice crisp crust the first day.
 Be warned it really is a thick sticky batter. Hard to mix.

I rarely use cake mixes doctored or otherwise but this one is actually very very good.   My family devoured it.   I did substitute French Vanilla cake mix for the other suggested and also, as I usually do, used 1/2 butter.    Am sure it is just as good as written but am used to using this method.

I made this as a bottom layer to my three tier wedding cake. It consisted of French vanilla cake on top and a blueberry cream cheese filling and this cake on bottom all covered with a creamy white frosting. I didn't even get a piece to take home everyone loved it and I have been asked to make it several times since.

I have made this several times and it is a hit every time!  I use the french vanilla cake mix and add extra berries.  I never have a problem with the berries going to the bottom - they  mix in perfectly.  Last time I made it, I used FF cream chees - could not tell the difference.  Watch the cooking time - you do not want to overbake this - I usually pull it out when moist crumbs are sticking to the toothpick.

The cake was very good, but as others have said it took much longer to cook than the recipe indicates.  I coated the blueberries with flour as some of the other reviews suggested.

This is a great recipe that travels well. We live in a coastal community and always have friends and family visiting. This cake is often found in our picnic basket whether we take our company for a day at the beach or surprise them with a day trip to a nearby island!!!

This is a super-moist, delicious cake. However, I wouldn't call it "pound cake" because it isn't dense at all. We love it, though, and next time I'm going to make a glaze for it.

This cake is awesome!  Very easy to make and so light.  I used 2 cups of fresh blueberries and cinnamon.  I also took the advice of someone else on this site and used the vanilla glaze.  My brother tasted it and called me the next day to ask me to bake him is own cake.  I will definately make this one again.
Thanks Carol for sharing.

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3 stars because of the rave reviews I received when I brought it to work. I thought the cake itself was tasty and a very smooth texture.  It is not heavy and dense as a pound cake.  I saw several reviewers state that this does not taste like a pound cake and that is true.  I just didn't like the brown outside this formed from baking in the bundt pan.  I really felt that this needed some type of a glaze.  It looked like a naked cake!  I would love to try making it again in a square pan with a crumb topping.  I really like the taste of the inner cake; just not the outer portion that came in contact with the Bundt pan.

Yummy.  Certainly need to let it sit overnight for best taste.

I made these for our Father's Day brunch and they were a hit.  I used a cakelet pan from Williams~Sinoma and they turned out just perfect, moist and delicious!

I just made this cake this week for a baby shower and everyone asked for the recipe.  I added extra blueberries as others recommended and it was delicious.  I plan to make this again, soon!

All claims true!  The addition of cream cheese probably reduces the rise, but the melt-in-your-mouth texture more than makes up for lost volume.  I'm looking forward to adding cream cheese to other recipes to control moisture loss.  Many thanks!

The recipe was easy and the taste was wonderful. Although, the cooking time had to be increased by 40 minutes longer. This would have been an embarassment if I was planning on serving this on a time frame.

I had to cook this about 20 minutes longer than the recommended time but it turned out so moist. I also used fresh huckleberries instead of blueberries and it was still great.
