I made this for Valentine's and it was excellent. I used it with Ahi Tuna and broiled for 8-10 min on each side and it turned out perfect.  We really enjoyed this.

This was the first time that I had ever made tuna.  I did not have any ginger, and I used a bit less Splenda instead of sugar, and it was still very good.  Thank you for the recipe.  I will make again!!

The flavor of this is fantastic!  I cooked the remaining marinade to use as a sauce when the fish came off the grill.  I was amazed that the amount of sugar used did not make the sauce overly sweet at all.  Outstanding!

Instead of using this recipe as a marinade, I used it as a dipping sauce.  We bought some fresh yellowfin tuna from the fish market and grilled it until just seared on the outside (still rare inside - - the only way to eat fresh tuna!)  Followed the recipe except I mixed wasabi paste in mine for a kick!

I cut the sugar back to about half a tbsp, and that was plenty sweet enough for us. This was absolutely the best tuna marinade I have ever tasted. Really outstanding. I cooked the tuna on the Foreman grill, and it was perfect. Thanks so much!

Used this as a sauce on top of yellowfin tuna.  It was delicious.  I didn't marinade it and I did add just a tablespoon of brown sugar and a splash of orange juice.  I also grated the ginger so I wouldn't have big pieces of it.  Thickened it in a pan while the tuna was seared and it was great.  Thanks for a great idea.

I used this marinade on Trader Joe's Mahi Mahi pieces. (A great fish bargain, btw.) It tasted authentic, and my husband thought I had used bottled marinade.  I used low sodium soy sauce and still found it a bit salty, so I will reduce the amount next time.  Large pieces of meat or fish may absorb less of the marinade, though. I served it with TJ Kimchee, white rice and steamed pea pods.

I have used this sauce three times now.  My husband and kids both LOVE this and request the "yummy" Ahi tuna.

Definite keeper!  I went a little lighter on the sugar, but don't be afraid to use it as the end result is surprisingly mildly sweet.  Almost a smoky flavor.  I let the tuna marinade for about an hour and 20 minutes and used black sesame seeds for toasting.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

very good - surprisingly extremely mild in flavor.  Nice if you have bold flavored veggies to go along side.  Husband says I must make again, so it's a keeper.

The marinade was absolutely delicious.  We used it on fresh tuna and the mean was just wonderful.  Very easy to prepare.  We will be using this again and again.

I used pork neck bone for the meat. Here were actually I boned but just nerves. I also used a sauce nothing of my own unfortunately called b!b??go Korean BBQ Sauce. I saut√©ed the veggies this time instead of steamed for time sake. Everything turned out great!

I enjoyed this recipe, and served-it with pasta with tuna and green olive tomato sauce. The pasta sauce had the more dominant flavor but the light-tasting marinated albacore tuna played a great supporting role for this meal.

I used this marinade on a pork lion for a change... It was delicious! After marinating the meat I reserved the rest and let it simmer and thicken... After the pork was removed from the grill I drizzled a small amount of the reduction over it. Served it on broccoli slaw and topped with toasted ramen noodles and almonds. I tried a different angle on 'ramen noodle salad'

A new favorite! My husband fishes for albacore tuna and we always have a lot. I am always looking for recipes that counteract the "fishy" tsste, and this recipe did it! I substituted agave syrup for all of the sugar, and I was only able to marinate in the syrup alone for 10 minutes, and then in the marinade for 1 hr. We grilled it and it was amazing! I will be using this marinade on salmon and chicken as well - fantastic! I, too, cooked the remaining marinade and poured it over the cooked fish. It was a little too salty for me, so may not do that next time, or use low sodium soy sauce.
