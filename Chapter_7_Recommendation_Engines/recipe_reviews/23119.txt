Excellent pasta! The nutty taste of the chestnut gives the past an exquisite touch. It is a very flavorful pasta. I made changes to the sauce though. I sauteed 1/2 cup of minced wallnuts and 1/2 cup of scallions in olive oil and added to the cooked pasta. It was delicious! It can be stored dried too. Thanks Dave!

I used it as a starting point for making ravioli filled with truffled chestnut puree in a sage browned butter sauce. Just needed a jump off and this helped.

I have not actually made this recipe, but I think the general ideas are very good. Being a Chef I can usually tell by reading. I was just wondering where you would get chestnut puree, really don't think I want to go to the effort of making my own.

I used roasted chestnuts I ran through the food processor as there is no puree sold here (and the chestnuts are a seasonal item so I may be making this only a few more times). First of all, I measured everything out carefully and the dough was way too wet. I ended up adding almost another cup of all purpose flour just to keep the dough from sticking to my gloved hands and the pastry mat. As a result, the dash of pepper and nutmeg got lost as I tasted neither. The roasted chestnuts added very little moisture so I'm not sure why the dough was so wet.

The flavor of the pasta was nice, however, the texture  was not like an al dente pasta but was instead pasty. Since the whole roasted chestnuts had a texture of a cooked kidney bean, maybe this added too much starchiness to the pasta. I will be making this again as I like the taste. I'm going to try playing around with the amounts and types of flour.
