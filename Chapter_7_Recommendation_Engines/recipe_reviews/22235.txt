I'm not an eggplant fan, but this was a great dip for our party. Fresh basil would work much better than dried, I think, since the dried added a grainy element to the recipe. Our guests certainly thought it was a hit though! Great vegetarian recipe and appetizer!

This is more authentic if you add capers, otherwise it is good.
