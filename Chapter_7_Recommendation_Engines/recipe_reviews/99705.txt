I used a package of frozen diced potatoes with peppers/onions and that cut down on the chopping.  Excellent soup, best I've found on this site for beer cheese.

Very good, but used Newcastle Brown Ale, and should have gone with a darker and sweeter beer.

Very Good! I used an aged Parmesan Cheese..made it a bit salty. Would recommend using a less aged cheese or cutting back a bit. Otherwise great!

Made this recipe exactly but omitted the potatoes and added mushrooms and smoked sausage. I thought it was a little too salty for my taste. Next time I will use the potatoes and use less parmesan cheese. Otherwise a good recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it began sticking to the pan.  I salvaged the soup to another pan and added 3 T. of butter to aid in the sticking.  (I was stirring frequently) It did not taste like the smooth creamy Beer Cheese Soup I have had before.  Sorry but I did not find this appealing nor did my family.

Instead of a food processor, I chopped and cooked the veggies according to the recipe until soft, about 60 minutes. I then used a stick blender to pur√©e directly in the pot, prior to adding beer and cheese. If you like your soup a little chunkier, the stick blender lets you dial that in to your liking. This could also be outstanding if you added sliced, cooked smoked sausage or bacon crumbles, along with chopped green onion for garnish.

We've made it twice now and found it pretty flexible as to ingredients.  One of us doesn't eat meat so we don't use chicken bouillon, and we used a blend of sharp and extra sharp cheddar only, and varied the vegetables based on what we had on hand.  As long as it has cheese, onion, and beer, I think the other add-ins are pretty flexible!

I cooked the chopped vegetables in the broth and blended them with a stick blender once they were soft.  I then added the beer (Claymore Scotch Ale from Great Divide Brewery) and worcestershire followed by the cheese. Best bowl of beer cheese soup I have ever eaten!

Very good but I used half the fake cheese and added sharp cheddar white and Colby jack. Added one more bottle of amber beer and 4 slices of thick cut bacon. Used better Than Bouillion instead of cubes, yummy!!

Made this exactly as stated and used Guinness, no one would eat it.  It did not have that great of a taste and the texture was not very appealing.

I was very excited about making this, but ended up being disappointed.  The texture wasn't creamy enough, which is something I did wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't like the taste and texture.  I may try this again, but omit the celery, carrots, and use cooked potatoes and cauliflower instead to give it a creamier texture.  I would use chicken broth instead of the bouillon cubes because it was very salty.
