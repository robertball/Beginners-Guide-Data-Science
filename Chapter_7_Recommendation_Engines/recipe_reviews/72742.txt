I wanted to make a couple comments since I am the one who submitted this recipe and parts were edited out or changed before posting.  First, any flavor of jam will do. Use your favorite.  I just happen to like homemade strawberry freezer jam.  Also, this recipe does NOT require the milk to be 2%.  Whole milk is fine.  And, for optional added elegence, you can use a creamed mixture of 8 oz cream cheese, (softened) 1 cup confectioner's sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  Beat until creamy and spread on roll before spreading jam if desired.  This creamed part is just a nice added bonus.  Sorry, I don't know why this were changed or left out of the recipe.

This recipe is perfect. If you have problems with breaking there are a few things you need to check or be aware of:  1. Using cake flour or a low gluten flour is best. If this is not available, add corn starch (1/3 corn starch to 2/3 flour). High gluten flour is good for breads and pizza dough, not jelly rolls.  2. Be sure you are not OVERBAKING the cake, this will dry it out and cause it to break. Try the lower end of the baking time first. Overbaking is the most common issue. 3. Roll the  cake while still warm, if you wait too long after removing it from the oven it will break.  If you do experience breaking while rolling, do not throw away your cake, cut it into petite fours and  fill them as normal. You can salvage what you have and make it useable and still yummy.

I am an expert at making other cake rolls - I followed this recipe exactly and it was a very dry crumbled mess. I can't recomend this.

This recipe is AWFUL! It was dry and cracked every time. I actually tried it 3 times, determined to get the recipe to work.  Finally after an 1 1/2 hours and a huge waste of supplies I pulled out my Betty Crocker cook book and snap I took a perfect Jelly roll out of my oven 20 min later.

My husband asked me for a jelly roll out of the blue and though I love to cook I feared it was going to be a challange but this recipe is fool proof and the jelly roll turned out great.  I added the cream cheese recipe and it was perfect!!!!

EXCELLENT!  This was my first time making a jelly roll.  I followed the recipe exactly as written including the times alloted.  It turned out perfect!  Thank you Barb Maxwell, not only for the recipe but for your review telling about the cream cheese mixture as an added bonus.  It was a real hit at our house.

This recipe turned out perfectly! I have a hard time making jelly rolls without them cracking or breaking, but this recipe provided just the right "sponginess", so it didn't break when rolling. I let the cake cool for a few minutes before I attempted to roll it the first time.

I really was hoping for a better result.  I even tried it a second time when the first one didn't turn out.  However, I only baked for 8 min. and followed the recipe EXACTLY and when I unrolled it to put the jelly on, the cake cracked and fell apart.  The cake itself did had a good flavor though.

This is an excellent recipe!  I have tried so many recipes for what we call swiss rolls (same as a jelly roll), but they are usually eggy and bland.  I overcooked mine a little, so no fault of the recipe.  I used a combination of whipped cream and caramel as the filling to duplicate the swiss roll made by a local deli and it was bliss!

I doubled the recipe since I have a bigger tray/sheet. It broke a little when I rolled it, but no major issues. I added cream cheese mixture and then the jam. Looks fantastic! My husband asked me if this was for work and I said no. It is for us. He gave me a big smile. I topped it with cherries. Yummy. Just like my grandma used to make.

Followed the recipe exactly w/o the 2% milk, whole. It turned out perfectly. The jam in my photo is homemade Elderberry jam, made by my son & daughter-in-law.
One hint: if you use the cream cheese filling, you might want to reduce the amount of jam. The cream cheese prevents the jam from sticking to the cake and the excess oozes out.

I've been making jelly rolls for a while and this recipe is the best one.  Easy fast and looks and tastes amazing!!!! Just watch the jelly roll carefully as it bakes, one minute extra and its too dry and will crack. I find it a bit sweet so I use less sugar and dust my towel with flour.

I was very disappointed with this reipe. I followed this recipe to the letter and it did not turn out. When un-rolling it cracked so bad it could not be used. I gave it 2 stars for a great taste. All the jelly roll stye cakes I've use in the past require seperating the eggs and whiping the egg whites. I alway get a light soft fluffy cake from those. Wanted something easier. Guess cutting corners doesn't always work.

this cake is dry and crumbly. I am an experienced cook who has made several cake rolls;  I did not think there were enough ingredients in the recipe. This did not begin to fill my cake pan of 10" by 15" Should have stopped right there! I wish I would have read the reviews first, but this is the first recipe from this website that has not worked for me.

This recipe is so delicious with the cream cheese & icing sugar filling with my homemade strawberry freezer jam.  Instead of vanilla, I used almond flavouring.

Yum! Is cake did not last 5 minutes in our house. Instead of plain jam or the cream cheese filling I mixed the strawberry jam into whipped cream and filled it with that. Also instead of powdered sugar I used granulated sugar for the outside. Our taste buds were in heaven!!!

On the downside I could not get the cake to not crack. The second time I made it ( the day after the first!) I tried to tip to cook it shorter (8 min) and found it cracked even worse and was a little raw in the middle. Will keep trying-- so worth it!

I am not much of a baker but I tried this recipe to be sold at a church fundraiser and took samples and everyone loved it. I followed the directions and every time I have made it, it has come out great! One of my sons friends request it every time I see him.

I thought maybe it was me just having an off day baking, but after trying again, this just isn't working. The cake just does not bake well. It tears, and cracks, if it comes out of the pan in one piece that is. I will be going back to my original recipe. The flavor was not so bad, but not good for a jelly roll. I actually took the pieces and made a trifle with them.

this was pretty good, but I didnt use jelly. I used ice cream. I got the idea from a recipe book I had on hand. I used butter pecan ice cream with cream cheese frosting. Not low-fat, but definitely yummy.

I was so sad this did not turn out.  Something must be missing.  I did not over bake it but it seemed like there was not enough cake there.  This even stuck to the parchment paper.  I still continued on with this and wasted almost a whole jar of my strawberry preserves.  Sorry.

I followed this recipe exactly and the cake came out very dry and chewy.  I did bake for more than 8 mins because the cake was definitely not ready to come out of the oven.  Other than that, I did not do anything different.

Ladies:  All ovens bake differently, it is not the recipe-it is the oven.  I stress to my daughter all the time the importance of baking exactly what the recipe calls for.  I love this recipe!

This was my first attempt at a jelly roll cake and it was a success!  My husband went in for a second piece.  There was a tiny bit of cracking, but I was able to work with it.  This recipe is a keeper

I was really bummed about how this turned out.  It didn’t even begin to fill the pan I used, so I doubled the recipe.  When I pulled it from the oven, the majority of it stuck to the parchment paper. Ended up using a different recipe.  I would suggest that perhaps this might work better (as far as removal from the parchment paper that the paper be sprayed with Baker’s Joy or another type of flour/oil spray so that it doesn’t stick to the paper).  Might make another go at it another time...

if you use vanilla sugar (sweden) use 3 times as much and instead of a towel use parchment paper and if you don't have parchment paper use canola oil soaked aluminum foil

Made this for my nostalgic husband. You really have to watch the time or it crumbles. Make sure you roll it very tight or you will have a flat layered blob. Very easy and delicious to make.

I made it exactly as directed.   Came out great, rolled great and I’m a newbie at the rolling part.  I used raspberry filling, one of our favorites.   But honestly the cake was dry.  But in fairness I was full of junk (cause I was in the kitchen) so I have wrapped it tightly and going to walk away and taste later.  Has anyone ever use a cake mix for a rolled cake.  If so how much batter?

I agree with many others here, something is missing from this recipe.  Not enough liquid.  Measurements are off.  Came out dry and crunchy.  I took it out of the oven when it had just blushed golden on top.

Haven't  tried this yet  but just wanted to comment that my first jelly roll was a failure and it was due to not beating the eggs  long enough.

Ok, first time ever making a jelly roll and I followed this recipe exactly aaaaannd, as my OH said, "nailed it"! Lol!
I was concernes with the mixed reviews but I mae sure to keep an eye on the sponge, adjusted the temp/timings as I have a gas, fan oven (also used the bottom shelf to be safe).
Once out the oven, I worked quickly turning it out, peeled off the paper and carefully rolled it up and allowed it to cool per the instructions.  Again, working carefully, spread the jam and rolled the sponge back up.  Voila!! ??

I used this recipe to make a Buche de Noel. It turned out great!!
Thanks BARB MAXWELL! 
Not my first jelly roll, but I'm not an expert either. I did make some adjustments / changes - I'm a purist, by no means. 
We had no cake flour, so I used regular + a bit of cornstarch as suggested by The Dutch Girl. I left my eggs out to warm up a bit, because I read somewhere that warmish  eggs were the secret to a perfect sponge cake.  Also I used brown sugar in stead of white, and I added a couple spoons cocoa powder & a big dollop of sour cream. I happen to know my oven runs a bit hot so I watched it closely and only baked it for about 6 min until it was done. 
For the filling I used the cream cheese idea, some more sour cream, icing sugar, vanilla, a splash of milk and yep, more cocoa powder. 
I know some of you are thinking - that I've made a completely different cake than this recipe, but all the other chocolate roll/ yule log recipes I could find had half a dozen eggs separated & ain't nobody got time for that. 
The biggest problem I had with this recipe was the fighting over the last piece at my holiday party! I will definitely make this again, maybe with some homemade jam this summer!

The taste was okay but the texture was awful. The flour and sugar ratio are not well ballanced. The cake was  crumbly and dry. Rolling it was impossible without breaking it.

this is one amazing recipe, i made this with home made peach marmalade and sweet whipped  cream in the role.
it was as fine a pastry as any french pastry and looked totally commercial looking.  put it in the freezer for a couple of hours wrapped tight in wax paper and take out 20 min before serving.
i have two advise:
1- after baking and before rolling in the towel, cut with a sharp knife 1/4" off all 4 sides
2-since the dough does not have any butter, adding whipped cream on the inside adds a lot.
fun baking everyone,

There is definitely something wrong with this recipe, The only reason it got 2 stars is because I was able to salvage it into something else. There was nothing wrong with the taste, however, I barely had enough batter for the jelly roll pan. I've made a jelly roll once before many years ago and it turned out beautifully so I do know how it's supposed to look. I'm still determined to make a jelly roll today so I'm going to find another recipe that would be way different than this one.

I added an extra 1.5 tablespoons of milk. It turned out really well, very happy with it. Next time ill add the cream inside with the jam, i think the jam on its own just wasnt complete, but still taste

The roll is yummy, perhaps milk would be a better substitute for water. and make sure not to OVER cook the cake, not even a few minutes longer... you'll get a not so fluffy, spongey taste. I wish there was an EASIER way to keep the roll, rolled! :o) perhaps even sticking toothpicks in it to hold it in place until slicing it onto someone's lucky plate ?? :o)

This turned out exactly how it should have!  Very simple, quick recipe.  I made mine into a yule log for a Christmas party:)
