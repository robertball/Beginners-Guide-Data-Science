Great recipe! It's easy, delicious, and good for you too!  I left the raisins in because I like them and added some pecans that I had on hand which gave this an added crunch. It's great as a snack by itself or over vanilla yogurt.

I really enjoyed this granola.  It was my first time and it came out great!  My only suggestion is to bake it on a large enough pan so it is a single layer.  Some of the pieces browned before the others were ready. Other than that, great!

This is fantastic!  My son has nut allergies and it is difficult to find a granola recipe without them.  I was out of coconut so I left that out but I added some flax seeds, seseme seeds and sunflower seeds which were a yummy addition.  

I have made this twice.  The second time I doubled it and used real maple syrup instead of  brown sugar.  Because it is already in liquid form I could skip the step of heating it on the stovetop and mixed the maple syrup, honey and oil directly into the dry ingredients.  

I cooked it a bit longer than the recipe calls for - closer to 30 minutes, but I watched it closely.  It has a wonderful toasted flavor!  My kids like this better than store-bought cereal and we have gone through a double batch in about a week because we also put it on yogurt and snack on it straight.

I first made this recipe because it called for things that I actually keep in the pantry, and have made it a couple times since. As written, it definately is more of a "fine" granola. After making it as written the first time, I increase the sugar and honey to 1/3 c. each and like it much better this way. It adds enough to give you some little clumps and makes it just a bit sweeter. Definately watch it closely while cooking. It browns fast!

If you like your granola crumbly, this is for you!  It was wonderful.  I increased the Vanilla Extract to 1 Tablespoon and it just added to the wonderful taste of this recipe.  If you like bar granola use the Granola III from this site, its fantastic, I also increased the Vanilla on that recipe to 1 Tablespoon and the Cinnamon to 1 heaping teaspoon.  Both these recipes are great in their own different way!  One crumbly and one bars!  Yum

Great granola!  I did not necessarily "change" the recipe except added 1/2 C less of the oats.  I just added extras:  1/3 C each of raisins, golden raisins, and dried cranberries, Wheat Germ, sliced almonds, sunflower seeds and white chocolate chips.  Just trying to use up some stuff.

This is really good granola- if you leave out the raisins.  ;)  Ok, I just don't like them, so I left them out, and in their place I added 1/2 cup sunflower seeds and 1/2 cup coarsley chopped almonds.  Added a pinch of salt to the wet ingredients.  Baked at a lower temp (320) for about 15 minutes longer than stated- just checked on it a lot and stirred.  Had this with yogurt and fruit this morning and it's very good!

I made this today to use up my excess supply of oatmeal. This was my first attempt at making granola and it went pretty well. I didn't add the coconut because the rest of the family aren't big fans and I used a cup of dried mixed berries in place of the raisins. Turned out well for my first try. Would like to attempt something harder next time.

Yummm...this was my first time making granola.  I made the recipe as stated, though it might also be good with dried cranberries or dried dates.  I think it tasted better than my favorite store bought granola cereal!  Thanks, Tammy,  for a great recipe!

I made this the other morning and it is very good.  My chunks did not stay together and I'm not sure why.  It does taste good just the right amount of cinnamon and vanilla IMHO.  The only change was to leave out the raisins and use dried blueberries.  They are very good in it. *edit* I made this today and upped the honey, oil and brown sugar to 1/2 Cup each.  Much more like commercial granola where it held together in little chunks instead of loose oats.  This is much better.

Excellent flavor and crunch--I love the boil & mix method--saves time in the oven! I might add just a tiny pinch of salt, and I always leave out the raisins ;-) I'll add some nuts next time.

Excellent granola recipe. Did change a few things to make the granola clump together better. Instead of 1/4 cup used 1/2 cup of each brown sugar, canola oil and honey. Used 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1 and cut back vanilla extract to 1 tsp so it did not over power cinnamon taste. Sprinkled cinnamon on top of granola after spreading out on cookie sheet before baking. Baked exactly 15 mins. at 350 and stirred granola every 5 mins. to keep from sticking to bottom of cookie sheet and browning to fast.

Good
granola recipe with an interesting flavor. I've made granola for the
first time, maybe my fault, but mine turned out a little overbaked. Very easy to make and doesn't call for many ingredients.

I love this recipe.  It's simple, fast, and turns out so good.  I've made it countless times and use it as both cereal and a snack.  I've left out the coconut and raisins when I didn't have any and it still was good.  I do use more cinnamon than the recipe calls for but I love cinnamon.  I dump the oats into the saucepan like for no bake cookies and combine it that way because I don't want to dirty another bowl and it comes out just fine.  I'm about to go make some more right now!

I've been making this granola for over a year now and just love this recipe!  It doesn't make super big clumps but I don't mind -- I sprinkle it over yogurt and eat it for breakfast or an afternoon snack.

The base recipe gets 5 stars -- and it is also very customizable.  I've added almonds, peanuts, dried cranberries, and also subbed 2 tbsp of peanut butter for 2 tbsp of the oil, and it always turns out delicious!

This is so delicious and easy to make, just make sure you keep stirring it every few minutes so it doesn't burn. I put some in a nice canister, added some pretty ribbon, made perfect gifts!

An excellent basic granola recipe. Naturally I made some substitutions and additions, namely pureed prunes for the majority of the oil. I included 2 Tbsp coconut oil, a cup of ground flax (omegas and fibre) and a cup of rinsed quinoa (for the crunch). I will be making this over and over again for my morning yoghurt!

What an inspiration!!  I refuse to buy granola in the stores OR make mine own with many, many ingredients.   I love plain yogurt, raisins, cereal and sliced bananas.  I have even been known to use plain cereal (whatever) but it was lacking the next level ... major crunch and some sweetness.  Today, I melted some honey into a frying pan, added my already mixed raisin bran type (CEREAL) and oat-type (CEREAL), then cooked and mixed well.  I filled a cookiie sheet of this and baked in a 350 oven for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.  Yummy  Thank you so very much.

My first try at granola.  Great recipe! And versatile.  I cooked it longer so it was really toasty, added almonds, pepitas, and flax, and left out the raisins.  The only reason it lost one star is that it didn't stick together and I was looking for more clumps.  Other than that it's delicious thanks!

Crunchy, sweet, and simple.  It's a cinch to make and probably a lot less expensive than buying a box of granola cereal.  I made 1/2 a recipe, since I am the only one eating it, and instead of brown sugar, like another reviewer suggested, I used maple syurp and didn't boil.  I used 1/4 cup of maple syrup because of its higher water content than brown sugar, and for my sweet tooth, it may not be enough.  I adapted this version, and made maple raisin nut granola, with walnuts.  I did not use coconut, I didn't have any on hand.  I'll be having this with milk in the morning from now on.  Mmmm.

The first time i followed the recipe exactly, though did not add the cocnut as i am not a fan.  I didn't like the flavor of the cinnamon so have not added it since and i LOVE this granola.  I have it with my yogurt almost every day.  I have friends who keep asking me to make them some more...giving them the recipe just didn't work.  I end up making 4 times the recipe most times, i just lower the temp to 325 and bake for about 5-10 mins longer.  I add all types of dried fruits and nuts to it when its cooled but recently added sliced almonds to the oats (was making a 4 times recipe batch) - substituting 2-3 cups of the oats with the almonds.  Put the hot mix over it and baked as usual...made it even more amazing!!  Thank you Tammy!!

This was wonderful. Made it gluten free by using GF oatmeal. It was delicious. I put it in parfaits for a brunch I just had. People thought it was wonderful!

Needed salt. I added 1/2 tsp salt, then it was delicious! I also added 3/4 cup sliced almonds. It really went well with the flavor.

This was a great, quick and easy granola. Yes yes yes people freak out if some users don't follow the recipe exactly but I ALWAYS tweak my recipes. I followed what one of the previous users said and used maple syrup instead of brown sugar to make it quicker. I also microwaved my oil, maple sugar and honey and that significantly cut down my cooking time. I tossed my oats in this syrup and then added some salt which really made a difference. 

I would highly recommend added the raisins AFTER you have finished cooking the granola as my raisins were almost burnt in the oven.

Great standard recipe, and QUICK. Took me less than 5 mins to make

I made a batch of this last night and just finished the first taste in my breakfast yoghurt...delicious!!! I didn't have any coconut, but it still tastes great, I might add a little more cinnamon next time just because I love it, but I think this recipe is tasty all on its own!!

The granola has been cooling for the last 20 minutes, and the small bites I've had taste wonderful. I'm giving this recipe four stars because, though the basics are there, it seemed like the proportions and cooking time were both off.

On the recommendation of other reviewers, I doubled the quantity of brown sugar and honey to 1/2 cup each; I added 1/3 cup of oil. I'm glad I did both of those things, because as I was coating the oats/coconut mixture, I was afraid I didn't have enough, even after doubling those ingredients. I also added slightly more vanilla and cinnamon,  and also added a pinch of salt to taste. Although I did include unsweetened coconut (flakes; I didn't have it in shredded form), I think it caused some of the oats to brown more quickly than others, and eventually to burn a bit. I would leave that out next time or add it in the last five minutes to get a toasted taste without the risk of burning it. Would recommend with incorporation of these changes.

I loved it.  I did increase the oil, sugar mixture by 25% and spread on two cooksheets to brown.  I added peanutbutter chips and chocolate chip while it was cooling. As they melted they cooled into clusters.  Awesome snack and cereal.

This was a really easy recipe, and I was able to change it up without problems.  My first try making granola came out AWESOME!!!  I added banana chips to the recipe, it was pure genius on my part.  So excited to munch on this for a long while!!!  And I made mine gluten-free!  :)

I used olive oil because it so healthy and it's hard to taste when it's covered by sweetener. (I've also acquired a taste for it so...)

This recipe is very good, and can be adjusted for personal taste.
I added...
1/2 cup of almonds
1/2 cup of sunflower seeds
1/4 cup wheat germ

I bumped up the oil, honey and brown sugar to 1/3 cup each for the added volume, and also soaked my raisins in boiling water for 10 minutes to plump them up.
Sooo good!!  Will make again, great pantry clean up recipe!

Great flavor, but not clumpy enough and the bake time wasn't long enough (so I cooked it longer, but then it burnt the coconut. I say leave the coconut out until the last 5 mins, so it doesn't overcook. Add a touch of water or more sugar to the wet ingredients to help liquid cover more and therefore clump more.

Excellent recipe.  I've added sunflower seeds and slivered almonds with tasty results.    The only thing I've tried that didn't taste good was ground flax seeds.

Great!  I added crushed pecans and didn't have coconut, so it wasn't exactly like the recipe.  a tip to get crunchy clusters - press the granola down on the pan when you take it out of the oven to cool.  it will cool and dry together, and you can break up the chunks.

This recipe is incredible! I love granola in vanilla yogurt but it's so expensive to buy. Thought I would give this recipe a shot. Very much worth it!! I did however change up the recipe. I followed it to the T but the brown sugar, oil, honey & cinnamon wasn't enough. It was too loose with the oatmeal. So I doubled it, the sugar, oil, honey, cinnamon, & vanilla. After it came out of the oven and cooled for a while it was like a huge rice krispie treat. Thank goodness I used cooking spray. It slid right off. I took a spatula to break it apart and it gave me clusters. Which what I was aiming for. I did change vegetable oil for olive oil and changed coconut for krisp rice.

AWESOME! I used agave nectar instead of honey, and upped both that and the sugar up to 1/3 cup each.  Also, I used a dried cranberry/blueberry/cherry mixture for the fruit.  It's great as a cereal with milk, or just as a snack.

I thought this worked out perfectly to put on my morning yogurt.  I did replace the oil with Sunsweets Lighter Bake fruit puree, just because all I had was olive oil.  It still cooked up nice and crunchy.  Next time I will add a little more sugar, but that is a personal preference.

Soooooo good - and so much better than store-bought granola!

The second time I made this I substituted about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil for Dark Seseme Oil and added seseme seeds to the mixture before baking.  Added a fantastic nutty flavor!

I added golden raisins and cranberries instead of regular raisins... this is wonderful! The granola wasn't even completely cooled before I snacked on it and snapped a quick photo! Quick, easy, and delicious...a must-try if you enjoy granola!! No need to buy granola again!

This is my 1st review and actually my first successful recipe attempt. I LOVED it, can't wait to make more. Easy too. I used virgin coconut oil in place of the veg. oil just cause I had it. I also happen to have a bunch of dried apples that I never know what to do with. So I cut up the dried apples and some dried apricots that I had and also some flax seed and almonds just cause I had it and I felt like it added to the nutritional value. I Love this site!

Very Good!  The only change I made was adding more cinnamon.  Next time I will be sure to only cook for 15 min not the full 20 b/c it was on the verge of burning after 20 min.

I looked everywhere for a gluten/wheat free granola and found this - it was the best! I did double the amount of honey for a less crumbly, more crunchy texture and also added sunflower seeds and nuts. Great recipe!

I substituted margarine for half of the oil to cut down on the fat, and only used 1T of brown sugar.  I used 3t of cinnamon, and used 1c of crushed cheerios in place of oatmeal to give it a little different texture.  I also cut the raisins down to 1/4c to help knock out some sugar & calories.  Turned out great!

Finally, a recipe without nuts.  I added a combination of dried fruit (including the raisins).  We sprinkle it on yogurt.  Excellent and easy.

Just okay. My coconut is a bit overcooked and has left my granola with a slightly burnt taste. Perhaps next time I will add it at the end.

This is like a healthy snack as well as for a delicious breakfast.  Easy to put together.  I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins.  I also added 1/3 cup of crunchy peanut butter to the honey and brown sugar mix to be melted together.  It was a big hit in our house.

The ingredients were excellent, I just added dried cranberries when it was slightly cool.  I just found the amount of ingredients to make the granola slightly dry, so I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, vegetable oil and honey instead of 1/4 cup.  It was more moist!

I added more honey and brown sugar (as one reviewer suggested). Delicious! But, I also added cocoa covered toasted almonds. It added a nice crunch and gave me the little chocolate treat I wanted without the actual fatty chocolate. I also baked it for 20 minutes, then fully cooled it. Then, I gently folded the large chunks and baked for another 10 minutes. After it's entirely cooled, it's all a nice golden color and is in much chunkier pieces.

This is great & less expensive that store bought granola. Plus, I can control what is being added. I used maple syrup rather than brown sugar so that I wouldn't have to put it on the stove. We like our granola crunchy so I cook it until it starts turning brown then let it sit on the cookie sheet for a while after I take it out of the oven.  This is great in yogurt, with mild or plain. YUM!!

This was my first attempt at making granola and found it to be very simple (and tasty!) First, I cut the quantity in half. I didn't have honey, so I used all brown sugar. Since that (with the oil) wouldn't make a syrup on its own, I added a couple tablespoons of cranberry juice to the pan. Additionally, I didn't have coconut but I did add chopped walnuts instead. After 15 minutes, I turned off the oven, stirred up the granola and put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes. It came to a lovely golden brown. I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing!

Not the clumpy granola I was looking for- I even added more brown sugar and oil than required. I also omitted the coconut and added a handful of sliced almonds. It is really brittle and falls apart to the touch. It was nice warm and fresh (I had it on yogurt), but I don't think I would make this again without many alterations.

I was looking for a fairly easy recipe that had ingrediants I had on hand for granola.  I did leave out the coconut as my boys probably wouldn't like it too much, but I followed it to a T otherwise.  It came out delicious! You could definitely play with this recipe by adding other dried fruits, nuts, seeds, etc.  I know I will!  The consistency was fine for me, a little clumpy, but not really cluster-like (I'll probably eat it with a spoon).  Great recipe!

My husband and 8 year old ate the whole batch in two sittings and now they insist they want to eat granola for breakfast "every day"! It's such a simple, great-tasting recipe, which can be tweaked to your own tastes so easily, that it definitely gets a 5-star rating for versatility.

Yum -- yum, yum, yum, yum!  My three-year old helped me, and after putting the oats and coconut in the bowl, I let him add some extra ingredients and mix it up.  He added a bit more coconut, craisins, pecans, and chocolate chips.  It was yummy before we even put it in the oven.  In hindsight, I should have mixed the chocolate chips in as it was cooling as they formed little chocolate clumps, but it still tastes great.  Unfortunately, my son won't taste the finished result (he's just at that difficult food age), but I'm hooked!  No more expensive store granolas for me -- they pale in comparison anyway!

I am in love with this recipe. I tweaked it a little by adding chopped almonds and 1/3 cup (instead of 1/4 cup) of brown sugar, vegetable oil, and honey. The result was delicious granola clumps. Yum!

This really is the best granola recipe. It's involved enough to make it good, but basic enough that you can add extras, like various dried fruits and nuts. My wife and I loved it.

This granola was very simple to make and used common ingredients. I am not a fan of this alone but as cereal its so good! I have a craving for it a few times a day. Am going to make another batch tomorrow, also thinking of tweaking the recipe a little and instead of adding cinnamon adding more vanilla and mixing in dried blueberries and almonds instead of the raisins. Great recipe that I will use time and time again!

Great base recipe!  I'll definitely be trying this again, playing around with different add ins (this time I used craisens- in the future I think I'll add some seeds and maybe flax seed).  Also, might try to figure out how to make it a bit clumpier.  Thanks for the recipe :)  Edit: a friend and I have been playing around to figure out how to get this clumpier--- we've found that if right when it's about done you turn the oven off, open the door, and let it cool completely without stirring, it'll clump up nicely!  Also- I've added some wheat germ and sliced almonds to the mix and it's great!

I doubled the recipe but made the following changes (trying to make it a tad healthier): -decreased the brown sugar by half -decreased the oil (I used canola for a healthier choice) by half -in place of the oil, I used 1/4 cup of apple butter (I didn't have apple sauce on hand) -added 1/4 teaspoon cloves -added 1/2 teaspoon allspice -added 3 cups of nuts (pecans, almonds, & walnuts) -added 1 cups of wheat germ  I baked according to the directions.  Stirring the mix at the halfway point.  Ohhh and I also cooked the nuts and coconut right with the oats-the whole bake time-nummy toasted nuts.  I've made recipe as stated (except I always add nuts) prior so I can compare the "new" version vs. the old.  I couldn't tell the difference between the two..I don't think you can mess this one up!

Great starter recipe.  Based on what I had on hand, I used coconut oil, fresh coconut chunks, raw peanuts, and dried pineapple chunks.  Really tasty and substantially cheaper than store bought granola. Thanks!

Love this recipe.  I'm always trying new stuff with it.  Different dried fruits.  This time subbed applesauce for oil.  No need to heat it up since br sugar dissolved in applesauce.  Came out yummy.

perfect recipe!  I have made granola before and burned it, but this one is just right.  I added about 1/4 cup flax seed meal and 1/4 cup chopped pecans to the oats, and I don't think I'll add the raisins this time.  I stirred it about 3 times, cooking it at 300 (my oven is hot) for 15 minutes.  I also stirred it quite a bit while cooling.

This granola is so good!  I just made some to add to my homemade granola bars since I didn't have any trail mix.  I made a few changes: 1)added walnuts and craisins, 2)used apple pie spice in place of cinnamon, 3)omitted the cocconut and vanilla (forgot about vanilla but I didn't miss it).  It tasted so good I didn't want to add it to the granola bars!  I'll definately be making this again.

Delicious....I made this morning and ate some over my yogurt for breakfast. I halved the recipe, but kept the same amounts of cinnamon and vanilla for flavor. I also used canola instead of veg oil. I added 1/4 c. of chopped pecans for crunch. I love it and love the coconut. Flavorful and easy. Thanks!

I love the flavor and how healthy it is. I just wish it clumped together a little bit. Perfect for yogurt, not so much for snacking out of the bag.

Awesome!!!!  I added 1/3 cup extra of each : wheat germ, unprocessed wheat bran flakes, and nonfat powdered milk.  I also added 1/2 cup slivered almonds and doubled the syrup. I did also use unsweetened coconut flakes ground fine in the food processor. It was delicious and my husband said it tastes like Post Granola cluster cereal!!!

This is delicious!!! I quadrupled the recipe so there would be a lot to eat with milk or sprinkled on top of yogurt and parfaits. I have made this recipe with the ingredients - as stated. I placed the sauce ingredients in a microwave safe bowl and microwaved it until all the ingredients combined smoothly. I poured it on top of the granola and baked it at a lower temperature than stated - at 300 so that the granola wouldn't burn. UPDATE - i made this for PASSOVER - but substituted matzo farfel for the oats. It is delicious and so addictive!

Great starter recipe. I usually add wheat germ, flax seed, and sliced almonds. When it's done I leave it plain, toss in some craisans, (we're not a raisan family, so...) or even dark mini chocolate chips. This is the healthiest version I've found, and my entire family LOVES it! Thanks for the recipe

I love this granola! I made some up last week and ended up taking some to my grandmother who also loved it! I made up some more this week only doubled it this time and put it in a plastic cereal container. I plan to keep this on hand now. It is so much better than any store bought stuff! =:)

This is a wonderful, simple granola recipe. From doing this recipe a few times I have learned that 15 minutes is plenty of time in the oven. Anymore than that and you might have burned granola!

This was the first time I had ever made granola. Overall the recipe was very simple and tasty, but more like a cereal than a real crunchy granola. I think its a good base to work off to make a better granola with different add ins.

Very good and very easy. Why would you buy a cereal when this is so much better? Although my kids are grown, I would think young children would like this. It would be a great alternative to the packaged sugary stuff.

Great granola!  I only made minor modifications.  We love cinnamon, so I upped it to 1-1/2t.  Instead of only raisins, I used a mix of raisins, dried cherries and dried cranberries.  My only recommendation is to add the dried fruit in the last 5 minutes of baking.  This softens the fruit and gives the granola more flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used to make a microwave granola, but this is so much better, just as fast, and easier. It needs more cinnamon...2 teaspoons was good. I added 1/2 cup sunflower seeds (roasted and salted), 1/3 cup wheat germ, and 1/4 cup sesame seeds. I skipped the raisins, but cranberries and white chocolate sound excellent. Baked in a roasting pan and stirred every 5 minutes. That was probably overkill, but I wanted to make sure it didn't burn. Perfect by itself, with yogurt, or my personal favorite...on top of Cheerios.

Yummy! Granola made by me - no way! Made three changes: cooked 26 minutes so it was super crunchy, added sunflower seeds and roasted chopped almonds, and used maple syrup instead of brown sugar, which meant I didn't have to boil the liquid mixture and saved time. Easy to make and delicious, just ate a bowl with vanilla soymilk!

Excellent- loved this recipe.  It came out perfectly done.  I substituted 1/2 cup of slivered almonds and some dried cranberries instead of the coconut (my fiance doesn't like it)- and it was better than store bought!  Just sweet enough for breakfast.

This was also my first time making granola and it turned out delicious.  I made half the batch with coconut and half without.  I also used maple syrup as one of the other reviewers did.  I added half a cup of oat bran just for some more nutrients.  It has so much flavor and is delicious in yogurt.

This granola is great! This is the fifth time I've made it...and what I've done with it is add a little bit of sea salt and some walnuts or hazelnuts to it. I then break it up and store it in baggies and portion it out onto my yogurt in the morning.

I've made this recipe several times. Although I think it's absolutely delicious I really wish it was more clumpy. Today's version I doubled the honey and used pure maple syrup instead of brown sugar hoping that would help but it didn't. :-(

Really tasty. Probably one of the better granola recipes I've tried. I added a little wheat germ and it still tasted great.

Could do with some more brown sugar and cinnamon.. but that's just personal preference.
