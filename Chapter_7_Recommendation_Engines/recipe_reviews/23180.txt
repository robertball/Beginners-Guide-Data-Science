Good with English cucumbers, a great baguette, and a small batch of the Creamy Dill Dipping Sauce recipe.

This was a GREAT recipe.  Only 3 ingredients so it's as easy as it can be!  We made it for our 25th wedding anniversary party and everyone loved it.  I will make this again many times!!! Two thumbs up KK!!!!

This was really nice! I whipped up some dillspread using greek yogurt, and garden fresh dill, thyme, oregano and bail with some cracked pepper and paprika. Homemade whole grain baguettes and cukes from the garden. I think this might be served for lunch today as well!

Some one from work brought this in for our food day. Everyone loved.  The only difference was that the dill dip & cuke were on small pumpernickel slices of bread

Easy and inexpensive. The hardest part was slicing the cukes correctly. Once I got out my mandoline and sliced lengthwise all was good. I used a chive flavored cream cheese and a small shrimp on top. Sprinkled with a bit of dill weed. Nice presentation!

Tried with thousand island and mayo also (whatever I came across), pretty good.
