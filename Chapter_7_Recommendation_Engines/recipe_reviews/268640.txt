I was interested in trying this recipe because of the atypical spices. It sounded different. While tasty, it was a bit disappointing, as I didn't get the layering of flavors I expected. I think it could be made better and faster on the stove top, rather than in a slow cooker.

Very nice change from the standard beef stew! Full disclosure - I don't tend to actually *measure* ingredients on recipes like this, but I used the full ingredient list. (Except for the baby shallots - couldn't find them at my grocery store so I used pearl onions instead.) The only real change I made was to do this on the stove-top instead of the slow cooker since I didn't decide in time. I let the beef simmer in a little beef broth for an hour or so to get tender, then cooked most of the liquid off before adding the wine, tomatoes, herbs, and spices. I'm sure letting it stew all day in the slow cooker would have blended the flavors even better, but the stove-top version was very good.

What kind of vinegar please?
Balsamic, white, apple cider, malt? I am sure using the wrong one will be a game changer 
Thanks

This was very good on a cool fall day. I didn't have six hours to cook it so  used a clay pot. You didn't specify what type of vinegar so I used sherry vinegar.  Next time, I think I'd add some oregano. Thanks for the recipe. I'll make it again.
