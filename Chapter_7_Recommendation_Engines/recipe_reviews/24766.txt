Hi all! I am Carol Graham that submitted this recipie. I use pecans now instead of walnuts.  The leftovers are only good cold, DO NOT MICROWAVE because the frosted flakes get soggy.  Those of you that add marshmellows, I think that would not allow the topping to be crunchy.  I do bake it a little longer, until the center is firm.

This was just the best!  It's so good, so addicting!  I used 2# fresh yams, changed the white sugar to 1/4 c. brown sugar and used Total Brown Sugar and Oats, slightly crushed.  It was fantastic.  Made it for the Holidays once and EVERYONE raved, now it's a tradtional dish.  Thanks!

I cooked this for Christmas and my whole family raved about it. I was out of brown sugar, so I used all white sugar. The family didn't seem to mind one bit. Great recipe!!!

Excellent dish!  The kids really liked it.  I didn't have frosted flakes or walnuts so I substituted Special K and and sliced almonds.

My family refuses to eat Yams/Sweet Potatoes ... until now that is! Once again this year for Thanksgiving I bought fresh Yams in hopes of finding a recipe that my family would actually eat. I will never have to search or hope again. This is the recipe I will use going forward. Only change I made was to use fresh Yams. I simply washed the Yams well with cold water and threw them into the oven with the Turkey. No foil, no butter/oil ... just as they are. Pulled them out of the oven after about 45 minutes. Let them cool for about 30 minutes then peeled and mashed. Followed the recipe from this point on omitting the corn flakes and nuts. My husband refuses to eat anything with nuts too but that's another discussion. I made everyone take at least 1 small "no thank you" bite and was amazed when they actually LIKED it and scooped on a regular serving. Thanks for posting this great recipe!

I've been making this sine 1999 and have made it for 120 and made it for 8.  It gets rave reviews from everyone.  I've even been strong-armed into giving out the recipe a few times.  It is a bit sweet, so sugar can be cut back a bit.  Also a note if doubling: the topping will become visibly (and taste) oily if you double the butter, but go ahead and double the rest of the topping ingredients.  If you are looking for a dish to wow with, this is it.

I cannot believe that I got myself and my family to eat yams...
I made this for Christmas and again, last night..
And it was my kids who asked for it this time...
We all love this dish.. Thank you for putting it in Allrecipes.

I have never met Carol Graham, but I thank her a million times over for submitting this recipe.  I've made it about 5 times now, and when I lost it, I was thrilled to be able to find it again on this website.  It truly is the best yam casserole I've ever had, and my family/friends say the same.  Also, I'm allergic to walnuts, so obviously I make it without them, and it's still INCREDIBLY good!  Thank you for submitting it!

Was extremely sweet. Too sweet for our family but it was good. I made it into a dessert, I put a grahm cracker crust on the bottom of a 9x9 dish and used it as a dessert because it was so sweet. I liked it better like this. I also added a dew marshmellows on top.

Was a hit at a Holiday Picnic! Turned my back for a moment to get turkey, and turned back around to see it half gone! Got great raves from people there. I didn't use the cornflakes but sub marshmallows, and used pecans instead of walnuts. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Thank you so much for this WONDERFUL recipe! This is so delicious! I plan on making it for Thanksgiving and Christmas too!  The topping is what makes it so good and sets this recipe apart from other yam casseroles! (I used a 9 inch round) Will become a tradition in my family too!

Leftovers - what leftovers?  I have a big family Christmas at my house, but in the past, almost the whole sweet potato casserole would be leftover.  Not this year!  It was practically licked clean and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  I did substitute regular corn flakes for the frosted because that was what I had on hand, but otherwise followed it to the letter.  Thank you for bringing sweet potatoes back to our holiday gathering!

Wow!  Everyone loved this - even one guest tried a small bite sure that she did not like yams.  She did love it and filled a big spoon for her plate!  I only wish I had found this recipe sooner!

Note:  I gave an A to under ten percent of students while teaching college.  But, I had to give Carol Graham's casserole five stars. Two changes made on the first dish (Jan 2009, taken to a church lunch):  1) Use pecans instead of walnuts and 2) use straight corn flakes ("already enough sugar").

This was the runaway hit at Christmas dinner - it was loved even by devout yam haters!

I did not have white sugar, so used all brown sugar and it was still delicious.  It is sweet, but no sweeter than the normal yam marshmallow concoction we usually make, so if your group digs that - this will not be too sweet for them.

Again, an AMAZING yam recipe.  Don't let the frosted flakes scare you off...it seems strange, but the end result is magnifique!

All I can say is WOW!! I've made this 2 years in a row now. The first year I made it, only we yam-lovers indulged. The non-believers only nibbled. The next year, even the non-believers indulged, and this year, I've already had special requests to make it...like I have a choice!

My husband said there were only two things he didn't care for at our Easter dinner and this recipe was one of them (the other was my MIL's layered lettuce salad). No one seemed to care for this dish. It's very sweet and tastes more like pumpkin than yams, which would have been fine for Thanksgiving but not Easter. Sorry, looks like I'm the only one not rating this a five-star.

I was looking for somthing different too make for me and my b.f. and this turned out great, except it seemed a little thin.  Next time I am going to reduce the amount of milk.  I did not add any nuts, simply mixed butter and brown sugar.  It was all I had

Fabulous recipe... I made it with fresh yams, left out the butter and sugar in the casserole (I thought it was sweet enough, and the texture seemed fine without the added butter). I didn't have evaporated milk, so I substituted eggnog (a bit of extra sugar in that). Also, as in other reviews, I used regular cornflakes instead of frosted flakes.
It was a hit with everyone at our family gathering, and I've already passed on the recipe. Thanks so much!!

4.75 Stars! A little sweet but it was a nice alternative to regular old yam recipes. Only change I made was as another poster suggested, I used Rice Crispies vs. Frosted Corn Flakes. A huge hit with the family.

While I don't care for yams, my family does, so I decided to make this dish.  They all loved it!  I did try it myself, and although I still didn't care for the taste of the yams, the topping was yummy!

I made the Yam casserole for my birthday/thanksgiving dinner yesterday and everyone loved it. I wasn't too sure how they would like yams but they just devoured the yam casserole. I know it's a keeper. Thankas for posting a good recipe.

I make this with fresh yams, just bake in the oven like a potato.  Peel the skin off and continue this recipe. I don't use the cereal but substitute with flour.  My family & I normally do not eat yams, but this recipe is loved by everyone in my family.

This recipe ROCKS. My sister in law doesn't like sweet potatoes/yams but loved this. She didn't even know what it was. It is sweet and I loved it this way. I substituted pecans for the walnuts. I will make this every year now. Thanks to all the other people who rated it, that is why I tried it.

YUMMY!!  2nd year in a row that I made this for big family Thanksgiving -- rave reviews from everyone!  I probably have the "sweet potato" job for the next 30 years!!  Most people commented that they enjoyed the change from the old marshmallow recipe and the little bit of crunch on this one!
THANKS!!

My Family AGREES w/ the 5 Star rating. Next time I will use Splenda and light brown sugar w/ light butter ie. (I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Lite) to cut calories...

I forgot one other change I made besides the fresh yams and a little less sugar... I used pecans in the topping instead of walnuts.

I have used this recipe for the last 4 years, have made it for large groups and always get asked for the recipe. I use pecans, but no other adjustments and I bake til the center is done. Everyone raves about it so much that now I get stuck  making this for our company thanksgiving dinner every year.

Can I give it 5 stars if I only made part of the recipe?  Well I wanted the topping part of the recipe. I baked 5 yams. Peeled them. Mashed them. Adding nothing they were so yummy. Placed them in a 8x8 baking dish.  For the topping I used a 1/4c butter, 1/4c br. Sugar, 1/4 t cinnamon, 1/4 t nutmeg 1/4c chopped pecans. In a small sauce pan I brought the all the ingredients to a rich bubbly consistency. About 5 min. Then I added 14-12c of 1/2&1/2. Smothered the top of the yams with the pecan Carmel and refrigerated till the turkey came out of the over baked at 325 1/2 he. Yummy

I decreased the white sugar to 1 rounded TBS. It turned out to be the best yam or sweet potato dish I have ever tasted.  Everyone who tried it on Thanksgiving liked it.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't want to make any changes but the lack of corn flakes prompted a last minute change. I made the casserole and baked it for about 30 minutes then I added marshmallows and baked until the marshmallows were golden brown. It was a complete hit! I will definitely make it again!

I reduced the brown and white sugar just a smidge and used regular corn flakes instead of frosted. I added clove to the recipe and sprinkled some honey roasted pecans on top as well.

I had this at my BFF's several years ago & begged for recipe after I moved away. I cannot stand typical yams at Thanksgiving & was hesitant to try this when she made it. I am so glad I did since I LOVE this, and it's my most requested Thanksgiving dish behind my green bean casserole. It's not Thanksgiving without it. I have to double it to get any leftovers.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I'm no fancy cook and the directions were easily followed. I will be using pecans and a lot more of them next time.  I too, cooked it longer and it came out fabulously! I made it for a potluck so i had to make it the night before then reheat the day of. So i did the 35 minutes the day before, and another 30-40 min day of. it was the best yam dish there.

I already reviewed but would add that for meal planning, I do not make this dish in the same meal as Pumpkin Pie, I find the flavors redundant, and honestly like this dish better than Pumpkin Pie. I like to pair this dish with the Grandma Ople's Apple Pie recipe on this site from user MOSHASMAMA.  If I am taking a side dish to someone else's house for Thanksgiving, etc, I make sure they are not making Pumpkin Pie, because someone at the table always says, "this is better than Pumpkin Pie," and I feel badly for the host:)

My family all liked this recipe, even those that don't normally like yams. I did make one change and that was to use fresh yams instead of canned. I steamed them then continued with the recipe. I didn't think the yams were too sweet which was good because the topping is somewhat sweet, which balanced it out.

I made this casserole for our Thanksgiving dinner and my family LOVED it!  I did make a couple of changes which included baking the yams instead of boiling them (personal preference because I think baking brings out the natural sweetness of the yams)   I used half brown and half white sugars and for the topping I used pecans (my favorite w/ yams) and rice crispy cereal (all I had).  This is now my all time favorite "sweet" yam recipe!  I will make this again and again!

This recipe will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth!  Everyone mentioned that it tasted more like a desert than a side.  But it was delicious and the leftovers were just as good.  I did microwave them, but just stirred it up so the topping "disappeared" into the dish.  The nuts give it a nice crunch that lasts.  I think next time though, I might cut out the white sugar or use just standard corn flakes to save on some calories and future dentist bills ;)

This has been my go to holiday recipe for a couple of years now.  I have used frosted flakes and have substituted rice krispies.  We like the rice krispie topping better!  I also use 4 medium size fresh yams instead of canned.

This was great! I didn't add the sugar, because I thought the ones I had were sweet enough. I made a quadruple batch for a Thanksgiving dinner for 23 people. Many of them told me they never eat sweet potatoes but they liked this!

This was good.  I liked the crunchy topping.  I didn't have corn flakes so I used honey nut cherios.  I like yams.  I was disappointed that when you add the milk it dilutes the flavor of the yams.

Actually got my family to eat sweet potatoes!  Very delicious recipe! I thought it was a little too sweet, so next time I will not add the white sugar, and a little less brown sugar.  I didn't have any corn flakes, so I substituted flour, and it still turned out wonderful.

I made this for thanksgiving. All 18 people there loved it even those who thought they didn't like sweet potatoes. I make this with sweet potatoes. I microwave them and scoop out the inside and mash. I also cut back on the sugar in the casserole part. Really delicious!

I have never had so many comments from a yam dish.  I've had moms, grandmas and aunts tell me this is the best yam casserole they've ever had, and I've passed the recipe to them...In the yams I use brown sugar instead of white, and in the topping I don't add walnuts and use more cereal.

The most mouth-watering and delightful yam casserole you will ever put in your mouth.  Had rave reviews at the Christmas table, with "this is a keeper" and "I don't even like yams, but I'll eat this any day of the week."  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Enjoy!

I personally enjoyed this dish, but my guests would prefer it without the frosted flakes.  So I say add them if you want to add a little crunch.

I started making this about 3 years ago for Thanksgiving and it was a huge success!  Now I make it for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. The topping is what makes it so very yummy!
