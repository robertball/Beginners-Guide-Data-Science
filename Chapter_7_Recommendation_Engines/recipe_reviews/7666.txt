This is the recipe that I use with one small change. Instead of using 1 cup pitted chopped dates, I use 1 375 gram package of jaffa dates. I hadn't made this cake for some time and inadvertently made the cake first with the 1 cup called for in the recipe. The next time I made it I tried 2 cups of dates. Finally, I realized that I had always used one full 375 g package. This makes all the difference in taste! Try it and enjoy!

I have made this cake many times and each time it is a hit, young and old.  I like to serve it with a dallop of fresh whipping cream.  It's easy to make and take and trust me not a crumb will remain.  (I also substituted milk for cream in the broiled topping and it turned out just as good)

I used pecans instead of walnuts and depending on my mood, sometimes I "double up" on the topping...doing this makes for a VERY rich cake, but super moist! One of my favorite recipes!

One of the best cakes I've ever made. You can make as is, but to make it a bit more adult, I soak the fruit in 3/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of dark rum, brandy or cognac. Any dried fruit works great, too. I use apricots and dates, dried cranberries or even dried apples. NEVER is any cake left when I make this.

This is a wonderful cake that my grandmother had been making for over 60 years. It's in demand for Xmas at our house. It's a treat for the adults, not a kiddie cake, althought they love it too. I use the topping on a cookie base for squares as well. I came in to add this recipe and was really suprised to see it here. DEFINATELY A MUST MAKE!

This is a great standard cake recipe. To fancy it up I add sliced almonds with the topping with or without the coconut.Looks more impressive with the almonds and tastes even better.

I have made 4 of these cakes in the last week. It is WONDERFUL!!  My boss asked me to make it for his B-Day.  He said his Grandmother made it for him every year and he had not had it since he was a boy.  I doubled the recipe and made some cupcakes, worked great.

I toasted the coconut and almonds for the topping (which I added per earlier recommendation).  Otherwise, I made it as given but I felt it was a bit dry and it cooked in less than 25 min when using 2 9x9 pans.  Next time I will use more dates and cook in one pan. Very good recipe.

I made this cake for a couple of potlucks and both time it was a hit! I find the overall quantity a bit skimpy for a 9X13 cake pan so I double the recipe and make a smaller one on the side (adjust cooking time accordingly). I also replaced the cream for a soya base product and it worked just fine. Finally, I added the nuts to the icing mixture at the last minute just before spreading/broiling rather than in the cake batter- makes for a nice crunchy topping.

The only thing I change is that I put a tea bag in with the dates and boiling water....removing it once the dates are soft enough.....just an old trick my gran used to do.

I thought i really messed up on this cake. But no matter how many mistakes i made, it made no difference. The cake turned out beautiful.  The icing is great.  I had no walnuts so i used pecans. I had no coconut but used almonds sprinkled on top of the  warm icing.  Everyone who has tasted it so far....loves it.  I can't get enough of it. I am in big trouble.  :)

Have been making this recipe for years as my relatives before me.  I find it easier to put the dates, hot water and baking soda in a food processor.  Makes the dates finely chopped throughout the cake.  Also, original recipe said to boil these ingredients for 1 minute, then slightly cool and add to rest of cake.  It's definitely a winner and always a new favourite for anyone who tries it.

Wonderful recipe.  I've introduced it at the retirement home where I work as a chef.  I substituted pecans for walnuts and brown the cake under the salamander - quick and crispy.  Thanks.

Awesome! Made this for my mom's birthday and it was a huge hit. It was just as yummy, heated up a bit, the next day. Definitely eat it while it's still warm. Made it exactly but left out the nuts. Thanks!

First helped mom make this when I was about 6. And continued to make it regularily as a family dessert until my late teens.  Now in my mid-thirties, remembered how good it was and decided to give it a try again.
Was just as great as I remember.

My aunt gave me this recipe and it is such a hit with everyone. Made it for our family Christmas dinner last night, to rave reviews. I cut the sugar amount in half though, because 1 cup sugar to 1/4 cup of butter is way too much, and the dates are full of sugar as is. Turns out perfect!

Awesome - though I soak the dates in either rum or brandy for a week beforehand and I've even made version with cocoa. I learned about this recipe from a friend who makes it every year for Christmas.Now it is the most requested cake ( we adults like the rum soaked dates version)....the only other change is that I add twice the coconut and more nuts to the icing. A keeper for sure!

Amazing.  Made it in a bundt pan and used sweetened condensed milk instead of cream for the toppings, reduced brown sugar a tad and it was phenomenal.

it pleased everyone, and I really don't know why: my teenager boy and his friend were waiting for it to come out of the oven to have a slice and didn't even want me to put the coconut on top...waste of time, they said. So, 5 stars it is: cannot imagine what it would have been with the proper finishing touches

Made this cake in a Bundt pan.
Just had about 4 tablespoons of extra batter remaining as it wouldn't fit in the pan.
Cake tastes fabulous, and is beautifully moist.
However, I'll have to give it only 4 stars as the top got very burnt.

I used whole grain flour instead of white flour and it was just as good. The "frosting" reminds me of praline. Great recipe.
