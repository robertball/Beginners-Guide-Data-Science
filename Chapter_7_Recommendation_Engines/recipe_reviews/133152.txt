These are so yummy.  I think I may have cooked them a bit too long as they flattened out a bit more than I thought they would, but they still taste fantastic!

Really great. I made double quantity and they disappeared in minutes. Everybody loved them!
I made them with wholemeal flour, instead of plain, but they still came out great.
