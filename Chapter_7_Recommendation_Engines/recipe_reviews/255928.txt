I added a fresh Serrano Chile instead of the ground chile powder only because I wanted it to remain a white/green chili rather than red. I also added a handful of chopped cilantro. Turned out pretty good.

my kid & I loved it. however with a few adjustments. I think it's too runny I like this type of soup to be thicker,creamier  so I thicken it with a little corn starch. also the directions don't  say whether or not to drain the beans ( which I did).  and it definitely needs salt.  this is my 2nd time making it & will continue to do so. it's a fave.

I roasted my chicken with seasoning salt and used thighs.  I forgot to add chili powder and I added tomatillo from the garden.

I added another garlic clove, a can of white corn, and substituted ground turkey instead of chicken. I also added more oregano and salt. I had two cans of small white beans and one can of cannellini beans on hand so I used those. I just canâ€™t help tinkering with a recipe. :-)

Everyone loved it. I doubled the green chilies...well, just because we can never have enough of those.
