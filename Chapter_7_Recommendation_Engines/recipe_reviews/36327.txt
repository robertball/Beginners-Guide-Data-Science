This tasted excellent -- the only thing is our pork ended up being a little dry.  We had to cook it for 45 min on the grill for it to get to 160 degrees.

I use this recipe several times a month.  It's perfect for pork chops, pork roasts, etc!  HIGHLY recommended - I always get compliments, and it takes just minutes to throw it together!

This was wonderful. I used on a loin that we served for New Years Day, and everyone raved about the tender tasty pork. I will definatly use it again, maybe this time on the grill!!

Wonderful. Had planned to grill this outside, but it rained, so just baked it in the oven. Great with scalloped potatoes, peas, and homemade applesauce.

What great flavor this lends to pork!  We used it on pork chops and it was delicious - not too sweet and not too spicey.  I highly recommend this!

I have used this on country ribs, pork loin and baby back ribs.  It is great!  The best were the country ribs steamed with a little water in a foil packet and 1/2 an onion, then finished off on the grill. (The onion acts as a tenderizer believe it or not)  Excellent rub!

Didn't alter ingredients.  Vacuum sealed (3 lbs pork loin) w/rub for 2 hours.  Slow cooker for 4 hours on high (w/meat placed upon a few balls of foil), but I meant cooktime to be 2-2.5 hours(!); meat was tender but dry due to error in my cooking too long.  HOWEVER... the drippings moistened the meat well.  Very tasty.  Chili powder was dominant flavour.

Yea, I was brave enough to try this for the first time on my co-workers.  We had a big meeting and I increased the recipe for 35 pounds of pork tenderloins!  It was great!  However I did also inject some marinade.  But the reviews were excellent on the rub.  Worked out great for me, and the flavor is outstanding...I will be a permanent part of my grilling toolbox!  Thanks for the recipe.  Next I will double the size again for a college tailgate party I am planning!  70lbs. of pork!!!!

Excellent! It must have been good because the friend I fixed it for raved about it hours later on the golf course to my husband. I used it on pork chops and it was a nice change of pace to how I normally cook the chops. Will definately use again.

Awesome recipe!  I used boneless pork chops and they turned out wonderful.  My husband said they were the best pork chops he's ever had.  I made them for dinner last night and already passed the recipe on to my in-laws.  The left overs for lunch were great too.  Thanks.

My thanks to McCormick's for the excellent pork rub. I rubbed pork loin and then let it marinate for 2 hours. I had to roast it in the oven because I'm grill-less at the moment but it turned out great.

Excellent, Excellent Rub!  I cooked this under the broiler but I look forward to the summer when I put this rub on some tenderloins to bring to a host or hostess at a BBQ.  I think everyone will like these puppies and they are so easy to prepare.  Thanks submitter.

This was good- it is kind of on the sweet side for me. My husband thought it was just okay. I used boneless pork chops- maybe it is better on tenderloin?-will try again and maybe tweak a little.

Outstanding rub!  It was a hit with everyone on both sides of our family!  Great flavor.  I rubbed down a pork loin with extra virgin olive oil then rubbed this in... put a 4.5 pound pork loin on the grill for about an hour.  One word of caution:  The brown sugar tends to want to burn easily.  Be careful with your flame!

I used approx 3/4 amt of ingredients for 1.5 lb porkloin, then marinated in a sealed plastic container in fridge for approx 2 hours.  Gas grill heated to 325 - 350* for approx 15 minutes each side (what is indirect heat?).  Then I placed the roast in foil with 3 TBS water, for moisture, and 1/4 cup honey bbq sauce poured along the sides of the roast, to add a smokey flavor. I finished baking it in the oven at 350*  for approx 1/2 an hour, or until the meat thermometer read 160*. Juicy and tender. Yummy!

We used this for a grilled Pork Loin. It was a hit! It is the best rub I have ever used and it was everyone's favorite at the barbeque! I love the fact that it consists of "normal" ingredients that everybody has in their pantry.

Awesome, Awesome Flavor! Very easy recipe using ingredients that are common staples in my pantry.  I cooked a 14 lb loin for about 2.5 hours on the rotisserie of my gas grill.  The roast was moist and delicious...a huge hit at our picnic.  I am making it on Father's Day per my husbands request!

This was very good.  I will definitely be keeping some in my cupboard at all times.  I used boneless pork chops and they were yummy, very juicy.  I just slapped the rub on and put them on the grill, I didn't let the rub sit for 30 mins as suggested, and I thought they had plenty of flavor.  It ended up more like a glaze after they were grilled.

I rubbed this on baby back ribs right before grilling and they were delicious.  They even tasted great cold the next day; although when you make these, you'll have very few leftovers.

We make this rub recipe, keep it in a jar and store it with our other spices and dry meat marinades. Have used it on pork chops and pork burgers. A little kick to it and it keeps meat tender.

I would really like to give these a 3 1/2 star rating because my husband liked them better than me.  So me a 3 and him a 4.  These weren't bad but because all of the rave reviews I was hoping for something a little better.  I think I will cut the chili powder down to 1 teaspoon and increase the brown sugar next time.

This was great!  My husband does not like Chili Powder so I left it out and it was still wonderful.

Awesome flavor!  Super easy, too!  I used this rub on boneless pork loin that I had sliced into chops for grilling.  I didn't have enough garlic powder left, so I used two pressed cloves of fresh garlic, which worked very well.  I can't wait to use this recipe again, especially when we have company!

I cut the recipe in half and used it on two thick-cut pork chops. Made the recipe exactly as directed and the chops turned out moist and very tasty. I've tried lots of pork rubs, but this one is by far the best I've come across. Even my 3.5 y/o and 1 y/o gobbled the pork up! I'm passing this recipe along to my friends. Thanks!

Excellent, I also added dried dill to the mixture.  I am a barbeque sauce fanatic so I brushed some on right at the end.

My whole family loved this one!  I only marinated it for about 2 hours, next time I will marinate it for at least 4 to give it a stronger flavor. I cut the recipe in half and used it on 1 pound of boneless skinless chicken breast.

Absolutely the best rub I've tried on pork. The meat was soooo moist and tender (I marinated for about 3 hours). I'll probably never cook a tenderloin in the oven again! Thanks McCormick!

Very close to five stars.  I chilled my rubbed-down tenderloins for 3 hours.  The rub is yummy.  While the meat was juicy, I wished it had more flavor (and we love pork).  Next time, I'll cut some small slits in the meat and add some extra flavor (garlic, herbs, etc.) before using the rub.

Pretty good for a dry rub.  I rubbed this on boneless pork chops that I had pounded fairly thin.  I let them marinate all day and broiled them since it was too cold for the grill.  Hubby and I thought it was a tad too sweet so I would cut back on the BS next time :)
