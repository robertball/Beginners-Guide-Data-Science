I used russet potatoes because that's what I had in my cupboard, and it turned out great. I didn't use the microwave to cook the potatoes because I was running my stove anyway, but I'm sure the microwave instructions would be a bit faster. I also added in some red pepper flakes for a bit of extra kick.

The only chile my store had available was a Pablano but that worked nicely in this too. This salad was delicious and such a nice change  from your every day potato salad that are usually smothered in mayo. Definitely a keeper!
