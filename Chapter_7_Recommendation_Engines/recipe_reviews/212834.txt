This is my recipe.  I just wanted to let people know that the dough in this recipe is not of the flaky pastry variety. This is more of a very thin strudel-like casing.  If you are looking for the flaky pastry type dough, you could roll out a thawed puff pastry sheet and use that.  :)  Oh, and you really don't need 1/4 cup of vegetable oil for the onions...I think that's a typo.  Just use enough oil to saute them.

Excellent.  To see photos of these being prepared, visit my facebook page (look up Izenberg's Catering - in Conshohocken, PA).  When there, click on photos and look for them.

This is an excellent, easy recipe!  The filling is simple yet flavorful, and you can easily create variations by adding cheese, meat, or other vegetables.  The pastry was easy to handle, cooked well, and tasted delicious.  The one problem was that the filling bubbled out the bottom and sides during cooking, so seal them nice and tight, and leave a vent in the top. I will definately be making these again!

The flavor was excellent, however it did not look like yours.  Yours looks like you wraped the dough around the potato mixture individualy, and pinched together on top.  Where did I go wrong?  Your instructions were a bit ambiguious

These came out perfectly!  I was so impressed.  I am typically not good at making any kind of dough, but I followed exactly and it came out the perfect texture and thickness.  It was also very pliable, and I found it easy that once I cut the logs into pieces, to pull the edges together and kind of wrap them around the bottoms to form a ball.  I know it's not kosher, but I added cheese and butter to mine and I thought the potato mixture was some of the best I ever had. I think I will start using it for my normal mashed potato recipe.

The filling was amazing. That being said, I've talked with my fully raised Jewish grandmother and more than a few devout Jews who keep kosher and they've all agreed that the casing is all wrong. I'd suggest using a casing more flaky/buttery with club soda and margarine for a more savory and delicious taste. This casing will only taste good with intense meat flavors, imo.

These were fantastic!  I made them for a New York-themed potluck at work.  No one here had eaten a knish before, but everyone enjoyed them.  The dough is thin and delicious and the potato filling is surprisingly flavorful for something so simple.  Thanks for the recipe!

Well I was in a rush to make these last night for a potluck and they turned out great. Thanks for a simple recipe! My Jewish and vegetarian friends liked them a lot. I used Irish butter instead of veg oil and served them with Gorgonzola cheese sauce. Yummie.

I have never had traditional knish, so I am not sure how close to that, this is.  I can say that even the picky eaters loved it.

I made this recipe three times and I think it is a really good one! They taste very authentic. I did make some changes though. I used two fresh garlic cloves, chopped fine and  added them to the onions once they were translucent. I used the sugar to caramelize the onions rather than add it directly to the potato mixture and added some chicken stock for smoother mashed potatoes. Finally, after I rolled the dough I cut it into squares and put a 2-tbsp scoop of the potato into each square and pulled the dough around it so it looked like a beggar's purse. I found this method much easier than cutting the logs into 1-inch pieces. I plan to make these again very soon!

Came out delicious, Sarah. Thank you!

I've been on a quest for good knishes ever since I left NYC and the craving hit me really strong today, so I decided to find a recipe and try to make some myself. This was super easy and came out just right.

Side note: I used margarine instead of veg oil and added cream cheese to the filling because I love cream cheese. :)

Amazing recipe.  It's a labor of love but so worth it! Make sure you pinch the dough very well or the seams will come apart and the filling will come out!

WONDERFUL!  Made these last night - plenty of leftovers for the next few days.  I wasn't able to make neat rolls to slice (it's me, not you), so after doing that with the 1st 1/3 of the dough, I began cutting out circles, filling them and then gathering the tops, like a shumai.  

Looking forward to making these again!  Thanks for sharing Sarah

Brought these to a party, and they were a hit. Great flavor! Dough was very elasticy, so I let it "rest" for a 5-10 minutes, and that helped in rolling out.  Hand shaping them took time, but I will def make again.

Coming from Irish parents, I've never had anything Kosher, but I wanted to try a knish, and this was GOOD!! Thank you for explaining how to pinch the dough closed! I had tried 2 other recipes before this, and most reviews on others had so much modifying they weren't even the same recipe. I don't know if I made it the way 7 generations ago did, but it was tasty to me!

Prepared this for dinner last evening as an appetizer with a simple butter sauce on top. 
 Guests were very complimentary. One guest had never eaten knish and was quite pleased.

This was really good. My only complaint is that it's a whole lot of onions. It's really overpowering, and I love onions. Next time I think I'll do 1/4 of the onions and add cheese. I didn't have the counter space to roll it out so I just ripped pieces off and treated it like pizza dough. It worked fine.

The recipe for the dough was solid. However last night when I made these I found them to be a bit bland. I salted every step of the way and even added a hint of grainy mustard to my potato mix, but still after all that they still needed salt after. 

But again, the dough was easy to make and tastety (DO NOT FORGET THE EGG WASH, IT MAKES A WORK OF DIFFERENCE) I plan on using the same dough to make a variation of pizza pops soon.

Our family loves knishes! This recipe was excellent, easy to make and a big hit. It makes a lot of little knishes,  which is my preference,  instead of big ones......I cut the recipe in half  and wound up with 25 knishes. Thanks

I made no changes, and I will make it again. It was good. The big difference was that  the breading was not the same as the knish I use to eat in New York. I still gave 5 stars because the potatoes was awesome. I had leftover potatoes and melted cheese over them.  I will make them just for a dish.

I used a different dough so my review is for filling only. Filling is good but use butter instead of veg oil and double it. Use 1 and a 1/2 times the amount of pepper (3tsp). Also use 4 cloves fresh garlic and cook it with the onion. Double salt. I made a half batch to go with this dough recipe and made about 24 knish. 
Dough recipe: 2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt  mix dry set aside. 1 egg lightly beaten. 1/2 c. veg oil, 1tsp vinegar, 1/2 c. warm water mixed. mix wet with dry let sit at room temp for an hour covered in plastic wrap. (will be greasy. Roll out in small portions super thin. Fold into little buns. Brush with and egg wash. Bake 375 for 30 min.

I decided to make this after not being able to find them in the store anymore. Recipe was super easy and I had everything I needed for it already in the house. I think I would cut back the pepper and maybe the minced garlic but thats about it. I'll be making this again and passing it along to my mother in law.

I just made this recipe but cut the amount in half as there are only 3 in my family. The dough came out really nice and just assembled the potato mixture and filled the little dough pockets and brushed with the egg wash. I just tasted them and they are great!

Holy  balls on a dragons dick. This dish is the popes holy semen on my life. On bite and i had trips like i was in a jump rope factory.  My mouth exploded and got replaced with a different mouth, in an orgasmic way. I have to go to rehab now because it was all i ate 24/7.
