Good way to eat sardines.  I varied it based on ingredients at hand.  I used green Thai curry paste, substituted rice milk for coconut cream (No coconut cream/milk on hand, and thought regular milk would curdle), stirfried a stalk of celery first, and added some minced candied ginger.

I didn't have coconut cream, so I just left it out.  It tastes just fine without it and makes a nice savory appetizer.

Made exactly except that I used the green end of scallions instead of shallots. Came out great, but was even better after a day in the fridge and used as a fish dip for crackers. Will definitely be taking it to the next party.

Yummy! (And I generally don't like sardines!) I accidentally bought cream of coconut, which added a sweetness that paired well with the heat. I mixed in cooked rice at the end. I will be making this again!

I accidently added 'cream of coconut' but it was still yummy - more spicey-hot with a sweet edge... I added a can of petite diced tomatoes at the end, mmmmmm. Next time I will serve it over rice!!

Fabulous meal in just a few minutes. Used wild caught sardines, coconut oil instead of canola oil and coconut milk instead of coconut cream. Served it on mashed potatoes that I moistened with a little coconut milk. Delish!

Loved this. Only deviated once with coconut milk - not cream.  I enjoyed this with my homemade crackers made from the pulp of my morning green juicing ritual.  Already looking forward to making this again.  So easy and yummy.  Thanks for posting

Not as spicy as I thought it would be, which is good. It dresses up the sardines nicely. I smashed up the fish as it cooked. Iâ€™m looking forward to eating the rest for lunch tomorrow.

My wife was stunned.  She anticipated spitting it out; instead, I couldn't get my plate back and had to prep a second can.

Changes: used green curry paste, 2 cloves garlic, 2 scallions in place of shallot, and cashew cream in place of coconut.

What a delightful recipe with room for customization! I used massamun curry paste and added chopped tomatoes and frozen peas to use up some veggies. Coconut cream is good,  just adds more calories. 

Served over black rice for some added iron.  Will make again and again.

I really liked this recipe. I added chopped cilantro to the mix to give it even more flavor, and spinach too. I also added green onions instead of scallions, and it gave it a more well-rounded flavor.

My family just isn't fond of sardines! I don't think I'll make this again.

I made a quintuple batch with a 1 lb can of sardines in tomato sauce.  Added a pound of sauteed cubed tofu.  Served it over rice.  The husband "tolerated" it, he said, but ate every bit; both teenaged sons liked it (!) and ate it up; the housemate and I liked it a lot.  There are no leftovers.
