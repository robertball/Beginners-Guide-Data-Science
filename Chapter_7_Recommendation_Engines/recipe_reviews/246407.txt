Very good.  I roasted some baby red potatoes and tossed them with this sauce and some chopped green onion and parsley - it was delicious.  It's not too spicy; if you wanted more heat a few shakes of Chipotle Tabasco would be perfect.  I'll make this again.

Very good. I didn't think this was too spicey and went well with the burgers we made. My son dipped his fries in it instead of ketchup.   It's important to allow this to sit and get happy before you use it.

I made this as a dip for french fries, and it was a little too heavy on the citrus for that, but it’ll be great the next time I make fish.

01.23.17 ~ I made this aioli and 'Sriracha Aioli' from AR to go with burgers and sweet potato fries. Loved the taste of the chipotle peppers, but really liked how the lime flavor came through. I put all ingredients in my mini chopper and had it made in a flash. Great on the burgers and the sweet potato fries.

Easy peasy- I put all of the ingredients in my mini food processor , gave it a few pulses and done.  I followed the recipe as is-not too spicy but a little kick.  This could easily be adjusted to taste if you want more heat or more lime.  Put it on turkey burgers. YUM!!

Yummy stuff!  Made as a dip for veggies and sweet potato fries.  Would be great on a sandwich or as a white BBQ sauce.  Will keep this recipe handy to use often!
