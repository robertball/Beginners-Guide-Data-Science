I think the first reviewer may have had trouble with her rice if she didn't read that the recipe called for Minute Rice. It wasn't until I was reading the recipe for the third time that I picked up on that. Since I had only normal white rice I did what the second reviewer did, which was to microwave the rice for four min. The rice turned out just fine. I also put everything in a dish with a lid and baked it...which also worked... All in all my husband and I did not like this. It was worth trying once..the artichokes and tomatoes were a wonderful idea  which I may use in something else, but the rest was too bland for us. I tried to think of ways to tweek the recipe but gave up since in reality I'd be making a whole new dish.

I was really looking forward to this dish, but it really turned out horrible for me. Although the smell coming from the oven was so yammy, I found that my rice was practically uncooked. I even left the dish in the over for an extra 15-20 minutes and still- the rice was not even close to getting cooked. I have no clue what I was doing wrong...I would also suggest more salt - although tomato/artichoke combo was an excellent idea. Glad I tried it, but wouldn't do it again.

Due to the previous review, I cooked the rice for 3min in the microwave before putting it in the foil and adding all the rest of the ingredients. I also used large whole chicken breasts, but cut them into strips before cooking. Although the rice came out just a slight bit soggy, my husband and I LOVED this meal! Easy to make, and a great combination of flavors. Next time I think I'll only cook the rice in the microwave for 2min and use a bit less water since the tomato and chicken juices mix in during cooking.

I loved the flavor of this meal. I did not have minute rice so I cooked my rice separately. I used grape tomatoes which it gave it an amazing pop and made my own pesto sauce as I did not have any. My husband is not a huge vegetable fan so he did not eat the artichokes or tomatoes, but really liked the flavor they brought to the chicken. I'm curious as to how this would work as a foil dinner while camping -- will have to try.

this recipe was good, and fast! I have a rice cooker so i didn't bother with putting the rice in the packet. I also added some black kalamata olives and feta cheese. I made the whole meal in 30mins!!

These were not that good. I used the recipe because I had all the stuff on hand. The rice was not cooked thoroughly and there was a lot of water left over in the packet. Also, the chicken was very bland. I won't make this again.
