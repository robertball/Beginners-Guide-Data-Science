I was a little doubtful about this at first because it didn't have a lot of cheese inside, but it was great! The sauce on top really completed it! Next time I'll use 2 cans of beans (mashing one for texture) because I would have liked it to be a bit thicker.

Thanks for the inventive recipe! Due to diet constraints, I used either fat free or lowfat dairy (FF mozzarella instead of the delicious Gruyere,sorry!) added a cup of FF cottage cheese w/ a little egg white mixed in to up the protein and served it with a bit of marinara mushroom sauce on the side. Scrumptious and satisfying.Brought the calories down to 291 per hearty serving (1/8 of 8x8 pan) and only 8 grams of fat. I loved the bechamel with the beans and tomatoes. Who would have thought?AAA+

WOW-this was SO GOOD!  We absolutely loved it!  I have to admit, at first I thought "Beans in a lasagna?!"  I love beans and lasagna so had to try it.  I was amazed at how much I loved it.  It's not heavy at all; such a nice change from many vegetarian lasagnas that are super cheesy and rich.  This will be a definite favorite from now on.  I made 2 and froze one for later; am so glad now that i did!

The only slight complaint was that it was a bit runny and didn't hold together very well; although this improved significantly once it had sat for several minutes.  It may have been because I used petite diced tomatoes as they tend to have more liquid.  Didn't matter-we ate it right up!

Thank you for this great recipe!

I liked this, but didn't *love* it, although someone who I served this to liked it enough to ask for the recipe. Not the recipe's fault, but the lessons I learned from this: Use as deep a dish as you can and don't fill it to the top; try not to assemble this ahead of time. I had to let this sit on the counter for a bit after assembling the whole thing: hot bean mixture, white sauce, cheese and all, and there were consequences. I had puddles of yellow all over the top of my lasagna by the time I put it in the oven, mostly butter from the bechamel sauce, I think. I had to pat the top dry after it cooked for a while - even with a pan under the dish, there was butter overflow and things got smoky. The gruyere cheese is expensive, and given this expense, I expected more of a taste payoff. If I make this again, I might try for a less pricey cheese with a similar texture & a bit of a stronger taste.

I made this for my vegetarian Mom's birthday dinner---and she really enjoyed it. It was an interesting twist on lasagna--the Gruyere cheese is the key to it's flavor! I doubled almost all the ingredients so I could make it in a 9x13 pan.

this is a delicious recipe!  i served it to a table of vegetarians, and everyone really enjoyed it.  i used jarlsburg cheese though, rather than gruyere, because it was much less expensive.  next time i will add an extra can of red beans, but its great as is!

This dish was a pleasant surprise. I was a little skeptical about this recipe because I don't like pasta dishes that are too heavy and rich.  but I eventually tried it because, like another review said, I've been looking for good vegetarian recipes with beans.

And this one turned out to not be nearly as heavy as I expected.  I used fresh basil and some extra bell pepper, and combined with the Gruyere the flavors really popped.  When I make this again (and it'll definitely be soon!) I do plan on doubling the beans and tomatoes because I like my lasagna a little thicker.  But otherwise this was absolutely delicious  :D

made this into a mexican treat.  Added spinach to this and mexican spices instead of basil and oregano. Topped with colby/jack cheese.  Will be a staple in our house from now on.

This is a great recipe, but I found that there was not enough filling in it for our taste. I doubled the bean filling and it's prefect! I definitely recommend the Gruyere cheese, it's SO GOOD with this! But, sometimes it is hard to find at the grocery store. Last time I made  this, I used a mixture of romano and asiago cheese and that was good also. Overall, great recipe! Even my "meat and potato" eating friends love it!

I have made this twice and both times it's been great! We have been using beans in place of meat to save on the grocery bill and honestly, we don't  miss the ground beef in the recipe! I love that the two of us can eat off of it for a few days then freeze the rest for later in the month for a quick lunch/dinner and it thaws just fine. Thanks!  Changes: Omit Gruyere Cheese- topped with Mozzarella, soaked and boiled kidney beans instead of canned, 8 oz container of cottage cheese mixed with pasta sauce to layer with as well

yes we love this lasagna :) 
I don't use canned beans, I cook the dry beans, so usually end up with more lasagna ... have also used flour tortillas in place of the noodles.

This sounded strange but my vegetarian mom and all 4 of my kids ages 5-11 loved this.  We doubled it and put it into a 9x 13 pan.  Also, we assembled it the night before and then baked the next day.  It was yummy.

Fantastic! I made it last week and I couldn't get enough of it- neither could my family. I did double the beans and the tomatoes, as another reviewer suggested.  I'm making it again tonight!

I used mushrooms instead of bell pepper, kidney beans instead of red beans, and regular lasagna noodles just because that's what I had. I heeded the warning of reviewers who said the filling wasn't saucy enough, so I did not drain the tomatoes and added some of the bean juice, and that did the trick. It turned out really good and fantastic as leftovers.

Very good, I really enjoyed the simplicity of the recipe.  Quick, non fussy, just a few ingredients.  I baked it longer to develop a nice browness.  I also used parmesan with cheddar, since this is a bechamel sauce any aged cheese works well so don't be afraid to experiment.  My son was initially let down as there was no meat in the lasagna, but I told him it was a different type and the flavors were meant to be more subtle.  By the end of the meal he seemed to be enjoying it more.  Not sure if I would make it exactly like this again, but I do think it's a good idea.

This is a wonderful main dish for 3 or 4 people. I put some sliced olives on top (chives would have been good as well), otherwise you just end up looking at a creamy looking, nondescript casserole.  Delicious though!  Next time I will use fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned.

I am giving this 4 stars because while the flavor was awesome (I'm not kidding, perfect flavor combination) I used the no-boil lasagna as recommended and it didn't work out as well as I had hoped. It baked longer for 20 minutes so the noodles would cook. I will make this again and will definitely sub in pre-boiled lasagna noodles. Stellar recipe otherwise!!

I rated this based on the changes I made. I didn't have everything the recipe called for so I didn't use garlic, I used yellow peppers instead of red, I used italian stewed tomatoes instead of regular diced, I had romano beans on hand and I used cooked spinach lasagna noodles. I also changed the white sauce by using cream cheese in place of butter, adding only about 1/4 cup light parmesan cheese and putting in about 1/3 cup of light shredded mozzarella. I topped it with a bit of light cheddar and mozzarella (no gruyere). SUPRINSINGLY my whole picky family loved it! (Even my pepper hating brother)

This recipe is so YUMMY. I have really never tasted anything like it. I make my own beans, which I added some barely to. I added the extra 15 oz's. Instead of canned tomatoes, I added a can of traditional spaghetti sauce (used the whole can). I read the other review where they added thin slices of zucchini on top of the noodles. so I did add zucchini also. It was so yummy, My meat eating son thought there was meat in this dish. I think the cheese sauce makes it taste more "meaty"  Oh and I didn't use the expensive cheese, I just used what I had on hand.. Mozzarella and sharp cheddar.  I didn't have red pepper so I switched it out for green pepper, I had on hand. Super deliciousioso!!

Very good dish! I doubled the red beans and diced tomatoes to make the filling thicker as well. I prefer it that way. I also used mozzarella cheese instead, it's cheaper and still tasted great. The white sauce on top is a nice touch. I recommend this dish! My family of non-vegetarians thought it had good flavors.

Love, love, love this. I didn't know how well this would come out of the casserole dish with the beans at the bottom, so I did a layer of noodles at the bottom. Also, I used whole wheat pasta and I used 2 cans of red beans and I smashed them slightly for better texture.

Oh, I was so excited for this - and, alas, kind of disappointed.  The flavors are good and it's a wonderful idea, but there was way, way, way too much white sauce.  The Gruyere vanished into the sauce and never turned brown, and the end result was like mac and cheese with beans, tomatoes, and not much mac.  If I make it again - and it's worth working on to get right - I'll decrease the white sauce and increase the bean/tomato mixture; I'll also add half the white sauce in the middle, and maybe another layer of pasta.  I'd also add a bit of nutmeg to the white sauce; I almost did this time, and wish I had.  I loved the use of Gruyere, though - a nice variation!  Fontina would have been tasty, too, and I might try that.

Everyone really liked this recipe. Doubled the beans liked recommended and thought it was yummy. A bit too much white saucy for me, which is why the 4 instead of 5 stars.

This was very good and even better the next day. As suggested, I mashed the bean mixture in the skillet for a better consistency.

Excellent vegetarian option.  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  I used only 1/2 the guyere cheese and it still came out cheesy enough for us.

Turned out really nice. Interesting alternative to meat or ricotta-based lasagnas. Next time, I'll probably use less dried herbs, though.

This is really good!  I tried to make it a tiny bit healthier/cheaper to make for my own needs so I made a few little changes.   Added a bit of cottage cheese and grated light cheese in between the layers.  Used light pizza mix cheese on top (much cheaper!) instead of gruyere.  Used light soy milk instead of regular.  Added in some diced carrots.   That's about it! This was super tasty and a bit addictive!

What a great, simple recipe!  I only added 1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese to recipe and subbed mozzarella for the gruyere. My meat eatting hubby even loved this one...this will definitely be in my weekly rotation..yummy!

This was really good! I did notice the topping of the milk and parmesan turned out great but it seemed there was too much. Really drowned the dish. Maybe use less topping or more filling.

Very good!  I did as suggested and doubled the amount of beans but it was still runny.  It didn't matter because it tasted good!  I also added a little bit of red (cayenne) pepper.

This is the best lasagna I've ever had!  I doubled the recipe and added an extra can of beans (at the recommendation of other reviewers).  Next time I'll mash a can of the beans and layer the cheese in with the beans and lasagna noodles so the top isn't the only part with the cheesy goodness.  I also want to find a good alternative for the gruyere cheese so I can afford to make this more than once a year (it's $20/lbs here! Oy!).

This dish was served twice at The Well Intn'l. It was a big hit the first time but I add more veggies from the garden, what I had on hand. The second time I stayed closer to the recipe, it was still all eaten but I don't think had quite the flavor. I remember adding a variety of cheeses to the first one too.

SO good! I doubled the receipe and just put it in a bigger baking dish. I also used fresh basil and an extra can of the red beans for texture, mashing them while leaving the other 2 cans intact. everyone loved it!! the cheese is a MUST :)

Interesting and different. Like other people, I found that it wasn't quite thick enough. I'd probably add more garlic next time and double the beans/tomatoes as some have suggested. The Gruyére was wonderful! As a whole, though, the lasagna didn't stick together well enough. Maybe adding some cheese inside would help, or mashing the beans. Will make again.

We found this to be just OK.  It was fairly dry and lacked some flavor.  If I make it again I might put some cheese in the layers as well as a little more spices.  However, it's a healthy alternative to traditional lasagna.

This is my all time favorite! Made it a number of times.  Don't need to change a thing.  Although you could make it gluten free substituting cornstarch for the flour and using rice lasagna noodles.  Everyone loves it.

Absolutely delicious! I added a green pepper and sliced cherry tomatoes with 2 greated carrots and sprinkled a bit of feta cheese between the layers.  I doubled the recipe and froze half.  Freezes nicely!

This was a big hit. The only thing I changed was to double everything on the list for 4 people. Fantastic...would  recommend to anyone that is having vegos for dinner or just a change from meat lasagna.

I didn't have any red pepper, but I used 2 cups of raw spinach that worked out well.  I was concerned about the sauce, but the consistency was perfect  Next time I will add artichoke hearts.  Good choice of cheeses too!

I would not recommend using the no-boil noodles for this. It was not saucy enough to really cook the noodles so they were kind of dry and crunchy.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I don't cook with beans a lot. I have this feeling that I don't like them, although when I eat a dish with them, I don't mind it. I actually found myself scooping up all the beans in this dish. I didn't use all the sauce, it seemed like a lot. Otherwise, followed the recipe as it's written. Looking forward to making this again!
