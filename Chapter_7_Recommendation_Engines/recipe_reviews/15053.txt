Lovely! I thought it was missing something so I added crushed garlic and that rounded it out nicely.  DO taste your sauce before adding your prawns or other seafood. If it tastes like flour it means that the flour wasn't cooked off with the butter before the milk was added. Throw it out and go again, the temperatures of the mix once the milk is added are not high enough to cook the flour.  What I prefer to do is to melt the butter first and then add the flour - equal parts butter to flour by weight. Cooked off properly, this will not taste like flour.

I added some garlic, it just doesn't seem complete with out garlic-1 clove cooked with the flour and butter.  Also added a little half and half and topped with fresh grated Parmesan Reggiano.  I liked this pretty well and would make this again.

I've been looking all over for a good Newburg recipe, and this fit the bill.  It's a "keeper" as far as I'm concerned.

This was a great dish! Very simple and very tasty, I added about 1/2 cup sherry, to my taste.  
I put fresh broiled (3 - 6oz) lobster and 1# frozen shrimp.

I used Pepperidge Farm Frozen pastry sheets, thawed, cut into 4 squares, put shrimp and lobster chunks, a little sauce, sealed the pastry and 20 minutes at 350.  Serve hot with sauce, try twice baked Potatoes as a side.

Awesome

I've been looking for a great Newburgh recipe to replace the discontinued Knorr sauce mix. This comes the closest to it.

I would make this again. You may want to substitute cocktail sauce for the ketchup to give it a little more zip. I also substituted some claw crab meat for 1 can of shrimp.

My husband and I really enjoyed this, the kids less so.  It was really easy and quick (always a plus!).  I used imitation lobster since I am allergic to shellfish and it turned out fine.

I made this for my first cooked meal in my apartment.  I added some flounder to make it Seafood instead of just Shrimp.  Served over a couple of flakey biscuits and it was just perfect.

Put sauce with shrimp, scallops and fish over soy noodles and the kids cleaned their plates. I grabbed a Knorr Newburg sauce, started to make that and decided I wouldn't have enough, so I jumped online and made this recipe in a flash. Tasted both sauces and much preferred this one to the "packet". :)

I doubled the sauce because I was going to add 1 lb fresh shrimp.  I did one thing right.  I tasted the sauce before I wasted the shrimp.  This tastes like flour.

I made this yesterday as dinner for my mother and I. We really enjoyed it, it was a very good meal, except when we were cooking it I added white wine instead of sherry, and then the alchohol didn't cook out because I added it late. However, it was delicious all the same (:

Great recipe.  I also took the advice of others to spice this up a bit.  I cooked the flour and butter mixture longer than 2 minutes, until it started to brown.  I added some garlic, horseradish, and salt and pepper to the ketchup.  I added uncooked peeled medium shrimp and cooked them in the sauce for 4 minutes. Served over wheat pasta. The shrimp was so tender and flavorful, the sauce complimented them perfectly! Will definitely make again.

I just finished making this recipe and it was good. I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked it at a higher temp to cook off the flour. I also threw in some imitation crab along with the shrimp and was pleased with the outcome.

This was delicious, and my family loved it!  The recipe doubled easily.  I followed advice & added garlic with the butter and flour and left out ketchup and worcestershire (b/c I didn't have any).  Great advice! I added catfish, shrimp & scallops & they cooked up quickly and beautifully.  The great part is you can control the paprika to your taste & remember some Pillsbury biscuits to sop up the sauce.  A great birthday dinner for my sister-in-law. I would make this again and again.

I made this recipe in about 5 mins...it was terribly easy and quite tasty.  As commented earlier, it is very important to cook off the flour with butter until there is no longer a flour taste otherwise you have a tasty watery buscuit mix.  I didnt particularly care for the taste of ketchup so next time, i will look for alternatives but the consistency and flavor (other than ketchup) was superb.  You make dinner quick and easy....thank you for sharing

I made this to go over some lobster ravioli, and it was quite good.  Next time I might cut back on the ketchup just a tad and add a little more paprika.  Also, my sauce got a bit too thick, so I will watch that more carefully next time, maybe cutting back on the flour or else keeping a little extra milk handy to thin it out.  Since it is a very rich sauce, I will have to resign myself to making it only occasionally, but this is the recipe that I will turn to when the occasion arises.  Thank you!

I thought this recipe was delicious, but I added garlic, cayenne pepper, and dill weed.  I also added Cod and flounder.  It turned out great.

Easy to make.  My husband didn't like it at all, it grew on me with every bite and our 2 yr old LOVED it. I used shrimp and imitation crab and served it over spiral noodles. It was like a rich mac & cheese sauce with a slight sherry taste (which goes away when reheated).

This is an amazing recipe, thank you for posting it! I too opted for cocktail sauce in place of the ketchup. One thing I have to point out, just because I'm a perfectionist. If a new, I mean, new green cook were to look at this recipe, I'm quite sure they would only add the 2 6oz can's of shrimp. That is all this recipe calls for. I did do a double take and scanned the ingredients twice looking for the "seafood". LOL Just thought I'd point this out. 
Thanks for the great recipe! I had never made nor eaten Seafood Newburg before! It was great and company enjoyed it as well.

Delish!  I followed a few other reviewers suggestions and was thrilled with the result.  I was careful about making sure the flour was cooked off.  I added minced garlic, omitted the ketchup, added a touch of cayenne pepper, and substituted white wine for the sherry.  I used about 3/4 pound of fresh (frozen) prawns instead of the canned shrimp.  Served over rice, my hubby loved it!  Can't believe how easy and quick this recipe is!

Easy and quite good.  Modified the recipe a bit by adding garlic and substituted chili sauce for ketchup. I also used heavy whipping cream along with a touch of milk   Instead of lobster I used shrimp, scallops and imitation crab and served it all over a bed of brown/white rice.  A definite keeper and I will be making this dish again.

I'd use less sherry and make sure the flour and butter is fully cooked.  Came out great each time.

Very good simple recipe, perfect for family dinners.  I usually use a package of fake crab meat and frozen salad shrimp so that the sauce is very plentiful with "seafood."  If the sauce tastes likes flour, that is a result of not cooking the flour with butter long enough before adding the milk.

This is awesome.  Taste just like the Newburg I had at a very expensive restaurant.  SO easy to make and quick.  I forgot to mention that I used Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2  because that was all I had and it still came out awesome.

I made some minor changes, so that I could add partially cooked pasta and then bake a casserole.  Came out great.  Two semi picky eaters loved it.

needed added flavor, added a tad of red pepper and garlic.  cut catsup back to two TBSP.....over powering flavor.  double the worcestershire sauce and paprika. saluted shrimp separately (like scampi) and added along with fresh crab....my husband had 3 servings. don't make as listed.

I really shouldn't rate it because I didn't make it exactly like recipe says to. 1} I didn't have sherry so I used the wine we drink  2} I used thai chili sauce instead of ketchup  3} I added shrimp, mussels, and clams,  My husband said it was ok. Kids thot just ok  I liked it, but since it wasn't a big hit I wont make it again.

I used 2 Tbs. ketchup instead of 3 and added about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the flour mixture. It was so good ! I will be making this again.

I made this recipe but it needed a little more pizazz. I used some imitation lobster and crab meat and added cocktail sauce instead of ketchup . I also added garlic and Old Bay seasoning. I cooked the flour a little longer as well.
