I've been making this for about as many years as Japanese steak houses have been around and I had the opportunity to watch how they prepared this. As do these steak houses, I don't use the teriyaki sauce, just the soy sauce, and add a dollop of butter and a squeeze of lemon at the end. Delicious, especially served with some grilled chicken, steak, or shrimp!

Great recipe, but I made a few changes: (1) Replaced vege oil w/seasame seed oil (2) Sliced the zucchini w/a potato peeler [for a more appealing/professional look] (3) Reduced zucchini cook time from 5 min to 1.5 minutes (4) Served over white jasmine rice. This recipe and these changes made a delicious dinner that even my 2 year old loved.

I took a chance and made something with no ratings at all based on the ingredients, and boy was I happy I did!  I'm always looking for a way to make zucchini since I love it so much and this did the trick.  It tasted like something out of a Japanese restaurant.  I did add several cloves of fresh chopped garlic since I don't make anything especially veggies without it, but the rest kept the same.  My teen even liked it.  Thankyou and I hope more people try this recipe, it's so worth it.

This is a great basic recipe with lots of possibilities! I used sesame oil and added cubed firm tofu and some diced garlic to the mix.  I also added a splash of rice vinegar. That really made the other flavors pop and reminded me of something from a hibachi restaurant.  Put this over brown rice and you have a nutritious and filling meal. WONDERFUL!

What a great idea! Make sure you are adding just enough soy sauce though, cause it may turn out too salty. In any case taste before you add. Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

This was excellent - Very correct it tastes just like a restaurant entree.  I will make again - but use more zucchini and onions because you will want more.

A friend gave my tons of zucchini and I was wanting something different to fix with them. 
I gave this one as try as I happened to have all the ingredients. Everyone was right, this is a keeper! I am taking this one to work tomorrow and give it out. 
You won't believe how delicous and easy this dish is. As a matter of fact, there might not be any left for anyone else, excuse me while I get another helping!!

I really enjoyed this as a side to my grilled salmon. My boyfriend was happy, too. I added a little sesame oil, and plenty of sesame seeds to make sure it got full flavor. i also added shitake mushrooms which were a nice mix. next time i will be sure to cut zucchini even thinner so that it absorbs flavor easily.

Oh my, this is excellent!!! I was looking for a dish similar to the Kobe Steakhouse and I found this one, so delicious. I used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the teriyaki sauce as suggested by other reviewers, I'm glad I did because otherwise it would be too much sodium. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious! There is a place I eat lunch at just for this side dish.  Not anymore, this is an exact replica! I was making this just for myself and had one large zucchini. So, I just used the whole large zucchini and halved everything else. I am glad I did that because I would have had no room in the pan if I hadn't halved the receipe. I also left out the sesame seeds and the black pepper, not a fan of it.  The japanese restaurant doesn't use the sesame seeds either.  Thank you submitter!!

Excellent! In fact, these were so good that my husband enjoyed them,(even had seconds), and he DOESN'T EVEN LIKE ZUCCHINI! However, he did like it cooked this way... now that sure speaks volumes regarding this recipe! On the other hand, I LOVE zucchini every which way; raw or cooked in every variation... never tried any that I did not not like. But this definitely stands out as a great side dish; well worthy of a 5 star rating. I'll be serving this a lot this summer!

Wonderful recipe. I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. And a little bit of chopped garlic to it. I plan to make this recipe at least once a week for a while. I can't get enough of it.

So simple and easy, but so delicious! This went perfectly with teriyaki chicken. I added half a red bell pepper, thinly sliced for color, sauteed that with the onion. We all loved this one, thanks!

This is a great recipe.  My fiance' can't stop eating it.  The only thing I did different was instead of the oil I used butter.  It gives it a richer, deeper flavor.  Awesome Recipe!!!

I really loved this and think it would be a nice compliment to any asian entree. I had this with "easy teriyaki chops" (also on this site) and lo mein. I substituted onions thin sliced carrots with great results (just cooked the zucchini and carrots together for the same amt of time). Also, used only 1tsp each of vegetable and sesame oil, with good results. Will definitely be making this again =)

It took about twice as long for the zucchini to cook and it cooked out a good bit of water which diluted the sauce, so I cook the zucchini for a few and drain before adding sauces, and it's perfecto!

Re. Soy Sauce. Japanese soy sauce is better for marinating (is saltier than the other kinds).  Chinese soy sauce is sweeter and better for adding to dishes ready to eat.  My favorite, probably because I lived in HI for many years is Aloha Soy Sauce.  Sort of middle of the road and good for marinating or seasoning.

This was very good. I was trying to get something close to a Japanese restaurant I love so much and this was very close. The times listed worked very well for me. I added some steak to the recipe & some sesame seed oil worked out well.

Very simple, yet delicious way to do up zuchini. This is also very good with other veggies. I added some garlic to it and cooked it in garlic and ginger wok oil because that was what I had on hand. Whole family loved it. I'm pretty sure that this will be in regular rotation. :)

Rather than serving this as a side dish, I added some chicken and called it a meal. The flavor is great but I do think the texture suffers from the long cooking times. Next time I'd cut it down to 1-2 minutes so the veggies keep some of their crispness. Also, the sauce is pretty thin so if you want it to coat the veggies I'd recommend adding some corn starch.

This is the BEST recipe!!!  I didn't even use the sesame seeds and it was still great.  My kids love it!  I served it over brown rice and it was a yummy, healthy, complete meal. I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a great side dish if you are making anything asian for your main coarse. The best part is you can substitute other vegetables according to what you prefer. I usually make it with zucchini, squash, carrots and onions because it is tasty & colorful.

Very very good... This recipe tastes great as a stir fry served over rice but also tastes excellent by itself as a side dish... either way the toasted sesame seeds definitely add a great flavor!!

Not too impressed with this one.  Only thing I did differently was only use 1T teriyaki.  Could've added some sesame oil, hot chili sesame oil, etc, but as is kinda bland.  I added leftovers to Szechuan Spicy Eggplant

as is, i would rate it at 4.  however, as other have suggested, I used sesame oil and a splash of rice vinegar and skipped the teriyaki sauce.  Also, it probably didn't need it, but I also added a tsp of chicken broth powder for added flavor.   All these minor changes brings it to 5 for our taste.

Such a quick and delish way to prepair zucchini. I left out the sesame seeds as the teriyaki sauce I used had them in it. I kept everything else the same and I will be making this again soon!

Made it exactly as written - very salty and too much liquid for the amount of vegetables used.  Will make again but will use less teriyaki and soy sauces.

I would say that this was a good recipe. I didnt have any sesame seeds but I had sesame oil and I had a teriyaki glaze that had sesame seeds in it. This was good along side my bulgogi and jasmine rice. I would certainly make it again.

Follow recipe exactly.  Wish I'd used garlic, along with some red pepper and sesame oil.  And for a more complete meal use shrimp or chicken as suggested by others.  Will try one more time as I found it was a bit strong on sauce.

This is a great recipe with lots of possibilities! I made a few changes for myself: (1) Added garlic with the onions (2) Used sesame seed oil instead (3) Used very little teriyaki (4) Used a potato peeler for the zucchini and yellow squash so they would absorb more of the flavor (5) Added mushrooms and (6) I added a dollop of butter and a squeeze of lemon at the end before serving over rice with salmon.

These were very tasty.  I followed the recipe - but did add a dab of butter at the end. Just like the hibachi grilled version at your local Japanese restaurant! Thanks for the recipe.

This was a pretty good side dish. It definitely just tasted like the sauce-- the veggies were pretty covered up. It did remind me of what you get in a hibachi restaurant. I would probably reduce the sauce next time.

YUM! what a great summer recipe.  The only change i made was to use olive oil and saute garlic with the onion. I think next time i may try making it healthier by omitting the oil completely and sauteing the vegetables in the soy and teriaki sauces. This recipe is quick, easy and delish...

One word "YUMMY".  I did use 2 tbsp of sesame oil instead of vegetable oil which was very good.  I think either way would be delicious!  Such an easy way to to do veggies for my Asian meal.  I will do this from now on.  My daughter LOVED them.

Very good.  I always appreciate new ways to eat zucchini!  A little bland, but I actually like bland sometimes.  I used toasted sesame oil instead of teryaki sauce (I didn't have any).  Next time I'll add straw mushrooms.

It tasted fine, but I just didn't get it. It tasted like zucchini and onions that were cooked in the same pan as soy sauce.  Neither veggie really absorbed the soy sauce.  I liked this dish, because it was pretty healthy. And it wasn't bad by any means, but it didn't have anything extraordinary going on.

I thought that this turned out good. However, it works better if you use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. It was a little bland so I added butter and garlic.

Tasty!! We like having this as a side dish with shrimp friend rice. It goes well with other Asian style meals, too.

Tried this since I had all ingredients in the kitchen.  Very tasty.  I too changed to sesame oil.  Julienned the zukes.  The splash of rice vinegar was a good idea too.  Will be serving this over Pad Thai noodles as I have those in my pantry as well.

This is delicious!  Our whole household (including two young children) loves this.  It tastes very similar to the Japanese style vegetables you get in hibachi restaurants.  I always make the Shrimp Sauce recipe from this site (with adjustments) to accompany this.  The only thing I do differently, is leave out the sesame seeds.  To me, it's good enough without them.  This is very quick and easy to make.  A great way to enjoy zucchini, which, in my opinion, can be a rather bland vegetable.

I loved this! It was easy to make and it turned out fantastic! Instead of 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, I did 1 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and a 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil..that way the sesame oil wasn't too overpowering. It didn't taste exactly like my favorite japanese place, but I sure didn't care! Yum yum!

I must first admit that zucchini is not my favorite vegetable. That being said it is not bad either. I had lots of it and looked for something to make it great. This recipe wasn't it. This was good but I probably won't make it again.

This really is a keeper!  I can't say enough wonderful things about this recipe!  I took advice from others and used only soy sauce (no teriyaki), used veggie peeler to make really thin strips, and used sesame oil in place of vegetable oil.  This is definitely going to go in our rotation of veggie dishes!

Using all of the wonderful Asian style recipes I have enjoyed from AllRecipies, I think I could host a themed party, surprising and satisifing everyone. The choice to add additional vegetables easily works without comprising the basic flavour. Using different colours of zucchini (maybe yellow) could make it even more attractive. Great texture, quick and easy, inexpensive and most importantly delicious.

Having it for lunch right now!  This is such a great change from steamed zucchini and zucchini bread!  Thanks so much!  Going to test it out on my husband later this week.  I think I'll throw in some chicken strips, serve it over rice and call it dinner.

We've been eating a lot of summer squash lately, so I thought that this was an nice variation.  I didn't have the actual seeds, but sesame oil works fine.

Just regular zucchini and onions in soy sauce. Nothing above average or outstanding here. You don't need the teriyaki or butter or lemon at the end. I tried it both ways and don't think you can taste the difference as the soy and sesame are the dominant flavours.

Wife, 2 year old and I loved this recipe!  Onions really soak up the flavor and complement the zucchini very well.  Added a dash of salt to please our family's taste but other than that, the recipe was followed exactly.  Had it with teriyaki baked chicken and white jasmine rice.  My baby said, "Yummy, daddy!"

Very tasty. I used PAM to saute the onions. I used my mandolin to get nice thin long slices of the zucchini and it worked well. I added a teaspoon of sesame oil along with the sesame seeds at the end to get more of that flavor. I'll make this again, maybe add some shitake mushrooms

Look out Benihana, this is it. Add Japanese Shrimp Sauce II from this site and some fried rice and you're all set. I've never added the Teriyaki sauce, but add some steak or lobster, it's delicious!

I don't know what I did wrong as I followed this almost exactly (added a splash of sesame oil per previous reviews) and mine was a mushy as all get out.  

Really, I did follow!

Please enlighten me.

I used 3 summer squash and a green pepper in place of the zucchini. I could have used 1 T soy sauce and 1 T teriyaki sauce instead of 2 T of each because it was a little too salty for my taste.  I also took someone's advice and added some lemon juice.  Overall, this was a great way to prepare either zucchini or summer squash!

Very nice flavor and a good way to use up all that extra garden zucchini.  Use a good quality teriyaki sauce. I like to use extra in the dish and pass the bottle around the table. Great!

this was a really good base recipe.. instead of using teriyaki sauce i doubled the soy sauce (used low sodium), added about the same amount of rice wine vinegar (maybe a little less), a couple cloves of garlic, and a sprinkle of powdered ginger and garlic salt.. super tasty.. ty for the recipe

OK, this was very good.  Even my zucchini-hating husband liked it.  I am always looking for Asian veggie side dishes and this one is perfect. I served it with Sake Ginger Glazed Salmon from Simply Recipes.   I used black sesame seeds because that's what I had on hand and I used 1T olive oil and 1T toasted sesame oil.  Delish!  Will definitely make again.

Served this with Bulgogi.  My husband's only suggestion is to double the recipe next time.  Literally, nothing left in the pan.  It was that good.

great recipe!  This is my "go-to" side dish when I'm picking up things at the farmer's market.  We have super sized zucchini here on Maui, so I only need to use one.  Also, using a Maui Sweet onion gives it such a nice kick with the Aloha Teriyaki and Shoyu sauce (all Hawaii local).  I only used 1/2 T of seeds, because a full T seemed to overpower this recipe.  I also add a 1/2 Tbsp of butter to this recipe, like I do with Japanese Fried Rice, and it turns out great.  So glad I found this recipe...makes me think of all my yummy meals at Benihana!  Adding hibachi steak next time, I'm sure it will be yummy.

I really love this recipe.  It's my favorite way to use zucchini now.  I've tried it with and without a splash of sesame oil, and really, either way is great.  I like making some extra sauce to make sure there's some to splash over a steaming bed of rice.  Thanks for a really great, easy recipe!

I followed the instructions exactly. My helper said it tastes like "nothing". Not sure what I did wrong but there was very little flavor. After trying to eat it as is, I added some crushed red pepper and granulated garlic. I had some liquid in the pan, so I added 1 tbsp corn starch mixed with a tiny bit of water. Much improved with 1/4 c Parmesan Cheese sprinkled on top.

I used zucchini and yellow squash and thought this was good, but I added some lime juice for extra zing. Kids liked it too! 
My tip: I would have used a mandolin to do the slicing, if I were smart. :)

I was given a bunch of Zucchini and I wanted to do something different with it.  It was delicious.  I did not have teriyaki sauce so I skipped it.  I did what naples34102 suggested and used some butter and a splash of lemon at the end.  I also used a teaspoon of hot chili sauce for added flavor.  Toasted sesame oil was what I used for the veggie oil.  This is so good!

Delicious!  I added some thinly sliced red pepper as well (put in the same time as the onion).  Used equal parts sesame and vegetable oils.  Instead of teriyaki sauce I used a bottled spicy schezwean sauce. So so good.

I left out the soy...didn't seem to need it with the teriyaki...but everything else was the same. Simple, and very tasty. Will definitely make this again...it's a perfect side for almost any Asian dish.

Loved it! I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I improvised with an additional spash of soy sauce, a splash of sake, a pinch of ginger, and a little bit of sugar. I also subbed sesame oil for part of the vegetable oil. Will definitely make this again.

Fantastic! I didn't have any teriyaki sauce on hand, but I'll be sure to pick some up, because I will definitely make this again!

I'm giving this recipe five stars for it's flavor profile and ease of preparation. I did not have sesame seeds or oil on hand (I don't care for the taste too much) so I just started with the veg oil and about 1/2 tsp of butter. I used an even amount of teriyaki and soy sauce and added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and a splash of rice vinegar as other reviewers suggested. We served it as a side to Tuna and Tilapia and even the picky 10 yr old boys ate this one! Easy as pie and delicious. Thanks!

This is great.  I made it by the recipe, other than adding a few pea pods and a small tomato.  So delicious.  I've had it twice in less than a week and will make it again soon.

This was SO GOOD!  I was sad to not have anymore left.  Even my husband loved it and he's picky!  I made a few changes.  I used 1 T veg. oil and 1 T. sesame oil.  I used my peeler to make the zucchini and onions into thin strips.  I also added garlic in the beginning with the onion.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was soooo good! I made this for myself and 2 other people and every bite was gone.  I will double it next time.  I served this rice, and salted pepper pork chop and it was sooo delicious!  I left out the teriyaki sauce and used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  This is going to become a staple side dish!

This is a very good recipe.  I had one whopper of a zucchini and I was not in the mood for anything fancy.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It was not swimming in cheese or tomatoes that tend to hide the nice clean quality of a simple veggie.  I'm sure I will make this often when summer's bounty threatens to overwhelm me.

I used only the teriyaki seasoning since that seemed to be what most of the reviews supported.  This was not something that we really enjoyed and I will not make again.

I tried this last night and loved it. I didn't have any zucchini but used yellow crookneck squash that I did have from my garden. It's essential to toast the sesame seeds in a pan with no oil to enhance that nutty flavor. Like many of the previous posters I added a few drops of sesame oil. Thanks for sharing the recipe. It's a keeper.

Very good. Personally, I think it would benefit from a little extra soy sauce to boost the flavor a bit more, but this makes for a tasty and very easy side dish (or vegetarian meal for my husband, when I add mushrooms in with the zucchini and make some rice). Thanks, Michelle!

This was soooo good! We will definitely be making this one of our regular dishes from now on! It was easy to prep/ cook and tasted delicious! We did use a spicy stir fry sauce in place of the teriyaki sauce, but it tastes alot like teriyaki sauce. If you're thinking about trying this recipe, I highly recommend it!

A very tasty side dish that my whole family loved!  I used sesame seed oil instead of vegetable oil.  I didn't use the teriyaki sauce, just soy.  My 18-month-old held a slice of zucchini in each hand and kept eating more and more!

I replaced the teriyaki sauce with Yakiniku sauce (Yakiniku no tare) since it's so popular here in Japan, otherwise followed the direction to a T.  Tasted great, but thought the zucchini were overcooked.  Next time I'll cook it for one minute instead of five at the end for a more quick stir fry cook.

It's not like everyone has toasted oil, IF you have it use it. I have been using this site for a while and I think this is my first review. This recipe was so quick, fresh, uncomplicated with such complex flavors.

This was very tasty! I am trying to eat healthy so I substituted sesame seeds with flax seeds and used olive oil instead of veggie oil. I also added some eggplant and mushrooms to the dish. It was so good. I served over soy noodles ( any pasta will do.)

Just delicious! I used sesame oil for 1T. of the vegetable oil. Other than that no changes. I did have to cook it a little longer, probably 10 min. to get it as tender as my family likes it. Wonderful way to use up summer zucchini!

This is the best way to eat vegetables!! The flavor was excellent! I added broccoli and carrots to the veggie mix to add some color and because I love broccoli, I also omitted the sesame seeds, definitely a keeper, loved it loved it loved it, oh did I mention I LOVED it?

i liked this a lot, but instead of teriyaki (which i thought i had on hand but apparently didn't), i used more lite soy sauce and a tiny bit of sesame oil. i'd say if you don't have sesame seeds, you can leave them out without compromising taste. also, i lightly sprayed the pan with oil spray rather than the amount it called for.

I took the advice of other reviews and added butter (like they do in Japanese restauarants) and also some minced garlic. I thought the flavor was a little plain so I might try sesame oil next time instead of vegetable oil like many other reviewers did. I will definitely make this again since we love Japanese food!

I was looking for something to do with all the zucchini I'm about to be over-run with and this even passed muster with the fussy teenage boy.  My only variation was adding 1lb of chopped chicken while the onion sauteed and ,as another reviewer suggested, I served it with jasmine rice.  Quick and yummy!

This was the BEST zucchini recipe I had ever made!  It tasted like something out of a fancy Japanese restaurant!  The first time I made this side dish, I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding a tablespoon of sesame oil to the regular oil at the start of the cooking for flavoring.  However, the second time I made it, I added yellow straight neck squash and some red bell peppers for coloring and presentation.  Tasted great the first time, but absolutely DIVINE the sencond time around.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!!!

This is a great recipie; it's super easy and was surprisingly quick to make. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil cuz it's all I had and I a dash of sesame oil in with it while it was warming and also omitted the ground pepper cuz I prefer it a bit sweeter and it turned out incredible.

This was delicious, tasted just lik what we have eaten at Japanese Hibachi restaurants. I took suggestions from other reviewers:substituted 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil with sesame oil, added minced garlic and at the end sprinkled ginger on top.

I was not a big fan of this dish, I followed the recipe to a t and found it still needed doctoring up for flavor. I would have been better off if I just boiled it and put butter on it.

Delicious!  I only had soy sauce on hand - so used about 1 and a half tablespoons plus just about a 1/2 teaspoon of fine sugar for my sauce. The toasted sesame seeds add a great flavor! This is a keeper!

Excellent. My husband thought it was great. It is a great way to use some of the many zucchini we are getting from our garden. I did use EVOO (guess I watch too much Rachel Ray) and added yellow squash as well. I doubled the recipe and was so glad as there was just enough left over for lunch. I served it with grilled chicken breasts. A wonderful summer meal.

This is a super way to prepare zucchini!  We both loved it.  The zucchini is not soggy like a lot of pther zucchini recipes.  The flavor is fantastic.  I had to use Teriyaki Baste and Glaze from Kikkomen because I didn't have any regular on hand.  I think it worked great.  When I make it again I will use the same teriyaki.

Delicious! I used both zucchini and yellow squash for this one. I used a honey teriyaki marinade instead of the teriyaki sauce. This was a nice, sweet contrast to the Firecracker Salmon and Mashed Wasabi Potatoes from this site.

I added sliced mushrooms and about 1 tsp. sesame oil as other reviewers suggested because I didn't have any sesame seeds. It's a keeper!

My DH and I really enjoyed this quick, new way of eating zucchini. I sautéed in a small amount of light olive oil with a bit of sesame oil. I also added some summer squash since I had it on hand. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is foolproof, and tasty to boot.  I don't even like most Asian cuisine but found myself fighting for the last bits of onion in the pan. It halves easily, as well. I definitely will make this again!

I was amazed at the simplicity of this dish.  It might be the quickest dish I've ever cooked.  I found the flavour was very good considering the effort, but not spectacular.  I meant to add garlic but forgot.  That might have done the trick.  I threw in about 1/4 of a red pepper that I needed to use up and also added some cooked chicken from my freezer to make it a fast, complete meal.

We prepared this recipe for the very first time at a foodies party where te theme was Japanese cuisine. This dish was the winner hands down, and yet it was one of the simplest thing we made. The taste was out of the world.

I spiralized the zucchini which made it super thin and absorbed all the flavor! Even my 3 year old loved it, so it is definitely a keeper

I made this nearly as written; just used sesame oil and teriyaki that had sesame seeds in it.  This was so easy - I spiralized the zucchini which made it even faster. The flavor was amazing!  Will definitely keep this in my rotation!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Delicious recipe! Though I did use oyster sauce instead of teriyaki, added chopped garlic, and served over brown rice. I used a simple vegetable peeler to get the zucchini sliced thin. Next time I’ll add red chili flakes to give it a little spice. Overall, great flavors and texture!

Delicious. I didn’t have Teriyaki, so I just used 2 Tbps of soy sauce. I put some red pepper flakes in as well for a little kick. I read someone squeezed a little Lemon on it too. I thought that was a good idea. I used some baked Tofu I had in the fridge for the protein. Next time I want to add sautéed mushrooms.

I give it 4 stars. It's good tasting, easy to prepare and doesn't take long to cook. Not 5 stars because all those seeds got in our teeth. Next time sesame seed oil, no soy sauce but more teriyaki. Maybe cornstarch to thicken it a bit  to stick to the veg. The joy of cooking is everyone makes it their own.

This was great! I followed the directions exactly except I used white pepper instead of black pepper.  The prep for the zucchini was quite time consuming because I hand cut them into somen size noodles for the most part.  the taste and texture were really good. I could have kept them a bit more crunchy and that would have been good too, but I wanted the zucchini more like noodles.

I made a double batch (over supply of zucchini’s) I followed receipe as written.  Delicious.  Today while heating up the left over, I put some garden peas and small tomatoes, and added another tbsp of teriaki sauce.  Yummy.

Delicious combination of squash, zucchini, and onion.  The mix of flavors was unexpectedly good.  Will make again for sure.

I didn’t make any changes to the recipe. Served over rice. My parents liked it. My kids liked it. Very easy to make. Good choice for a crowd or all ages.

Good enough to make again, just maybe add some additional spices. Tasty and healthy.

All my boys loved it!! :) the only change I made is the oil. I used sesame oil instead and only had squash on hand (no zucchini :/ ) The flavor was on point and I would definitely recommend!

I made this over white rice as a side dish.  Was absolutely amazing.  I did add fresh garlic before adding zucchini to pan.  Will make again and again.  Fantastic!!!

EXCELLENT! I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and added 1 tsp hoisin sauce (yes, I know this is Chinese and not Japanese - but what the hay) and splash of rice vinegar.

Changed it for my needs.  used my spirilizer for green and yellow zucchinis.  used onion and half a left over leek.  only used 1 t of sesame oil and 1 T soy sauce.  didn't use anything else.  i thought it very good and in keeping with the food plan i am on.  thank you for the idea.

My family loved it.  I did use sesame seed oil for frying, and added a splash of rice vinegar at the end as someone suggested.  It went so well with the grilled teriyaki chicken that we served.  I love to have new ways to cook zucchini.  Thank you for this one,  it's a keeper.

Simple base for a recipe.  Will make again.  Good on it's own but you could add so many things to your taste.  We added shredded cheddar on top of some.  Have a similar recipe we like that we add bacon crumbles and diced tomatoes to as well.  The possibilities go on...

Good recipe! Only thing I did different was after adding zucchini to pan, I threw in a bit of water and covered to let it steam a bit.  Then added sauces.

it was very good I used a lot of mushrooms and I sauteed in butter and garlic and then I cooked red onion and green and red peppers separately and then I combined them together and then I added the tomatoes I use quite a bit of garlic and I think the butter with the mushrooms really brought the flavor out and I had a lot of juice I didn't need to add water but I did use 3 tablespoons of chicken broth powder and then I cook the pork chops separately and then brought them all together for about an hour or longer on the stove it was delicious

I used just soy sauce. This was delicious!  Soy sauce is subtle in this recipe and not over powering. This recipe doesn't have to be made with a Chinese or Japanese menu, will pare well with any meal

Loved this one for its simplicity and taste. Used a spiralizer to make "noodles" and my non-zucchini-eaters tried it and liked it. I did use sesame oil since I did not have sesame seeds, and chopped up blanched peanuts in lieu of the sesame seeds. If you're looking for a little heat, try adding a squirt of sriracha or even a chili garlic sauce. Definitely will make again!

I made this tonight for the first time, when I was looking for ideas for zucchini. I did not have sesame seeds, so I put a bit of sesame oil in with the regular oil. I enjoyed the blend of the teriyaki and soy sauces. Depending on the size you choose to slice the zucchini, you have to make a judgment call on when it's time to stop cooking it, so it doesn't get soggy. This recipe didn't have a lot of complicated ingredients, so I didn't expect a very complicated taste. It was very much as expected, and it's something that's quite easy to put together quickly. BRAVO! 

I served it on a bed of "pilaf" made with some chopped onion, basmati rice, farro, and quinoa, made with vegetable broth. I would enjoy this with some sauteed chicken on top to make a complete meal.

I buy a cup of white sauce from our favorite Japanese restaurant, so it tastes exactly the same as dinner there, only a lot cheaper. I'll definitely be making it a lot.

Tasty and easy to make! I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and since the flavor wasn't quite strong enough for me,  I added some extra soy sauce, teriyaki, and hot chili flakes.

I made this recipe and added grilled chicken to it, serving it over rice.  Wow!  This was very good.  Hubby's favorite vegetable is not zucchini and he enjoyed this as well.

Really liked this! As another reviewer said, if making this as a main dish rather than a side, I highly recommend doubling the ingredients. So easy to make, and so tasty! This will be another regular for us.

This was VERY good and surprisingly flavorful! The only variance I made was that I was out of sesame seeds, so I added just a few drops of sesame oil to provide the added flavor.

Also, I did not have bottled teriyaki sauce, so I threw together my own. Will definitely make this again.

I took some of the suggestions from the reviews and found this the best summer squash recipe I've ever tasted.
I used 1 TBL. canola oil and 1 TBL. sesame oil. I sauteed the onions for 5 minutes and the added thinly sliced red pepper, yellow summer squash and a pale green squash and and cooked for another 5 minutes. I then added minced garlic and then 1 minute later added the sauces including a splash of rice wine vinegar.  I sauteed until the squashes were tender, added the seeds and served it.

Mmmm! Loved the flavor! Mine sauce was quite watery with the zucchini juices, so I sprinkled in some corn starch right into the juice whisking it until it thickened up ever so slightly.

Took advice & added garlic. Hubby thought it had a crunchy taste, even though the zucchini was cooked through.  We both liked that.

very tasty. I must admit that we like our food rather spice so I made changes to this first time out. I added 1/2 tablespoon each of Ponzu,  and sriracha and 3/4 tablespoon Tiger sauce. really yummy!

Fresh and delicious. I have never liked the taste of teriyaki, so I just added a little more soy sauce (gluten-free) and I could not find my sesame seeds so I used a toasted sesame ginger seasoning that I had on hand. This one is a keeper.

Delicious! Made it exactly as written, except my sesame seeds were not toasted. And I always use low-sodium soy sauce, so it wasn't too salty. Really good, will definitely make again!

We really enjoyed these Japanese hibachi style vegetables.  The only thing I did different was salted them.  I figured there would have been enough in it with the teriyaki and soy sauces, but it wasn't to our liking.  I'll definitely make them again, especially with the abundance of zucchini we seem to have in the summer!

Simple and Delicious!  Made as directed and now THIS is how I use up all my extra garden squash! Have made it several times and sometimes keep it as a side dish or add some leftover chicken and toss with pasta or rice depending on what's on hand , Thank you !

Simply loved this.  Wouldn't change a  thing!  (I'm allergic to sesame seeds, but didn't think it was missing anything.)  Used a mandoline to slice the onions and zuccs, and made a double recipe.

Loved the ease and flavor of this dish !  Zucchini was on sale and I wanted to do something different.  I had sesame seeds for another dish I had tried because you have to have the sesame seeds.  Made as explained, loved every bite.

Tried to slice our zucchini thinly...., but perhaps we did not cut our zucchini thinly enough?  I have to admit that our family is less familiar with Japanese cuisine, and thus cannot compare this to 'the real thing', just with what we do and do not like to date.  This time around, our zucchini and onions were quite bland, though redeemable by serving them alongside a flavorful chicken dish (all on rice).  First, however, we added some salt, sugar, and rice wine vinegar.  If we try this again (which we probably will since we love zucchini and have it in our garden):  we may try this again using a potato peeler as one reviewer suggested.  We'll probably also make other changes (adding garlic and perhaps ginger and/or red pepper flakes or chili sauce).  Might try another reviewer's suggestion of skipping the teriyaki sauce, upping the soy and adding lemon and butter as he had seen in a Japanese restaurant?  Still might keep that touch of sugar we used this time though (just enough to season, not sweeten - not to say that such changes would be Japanese in nature, just more to our liking.....).

I love this simple recipe as a base because I can add just about any veggie in season or in the fridge.  Tonight I added sliced carrots to the onions and cooked them until they started to caramelize then I added the squash.  I added 1 tsp minced garlic then added a mixture of Dynasty hot chili oil (1/4 tsp), soy and Teryaki.  I also had fresh corn on the cob so I cut it off the cob and tossed some sesame seeds on the top.  Wow was it good!

I think my onions got overcooked because the zucchini wasn't ready yet, but it was great! I added it to the soup I made and it was to die for.

This was fantastic and so close to the veggies we have at hibachi restaurants.  I plan to use broccoli, carrots and such the next time I make this recipe.

Delicious!  And easy to make.  I cooked the zucchini a bit less than instructed, but otherwise followed the directions and it turned out great!  My boyfriend loved it too, but he'll eat anything...

What a great way to prepare zucchini! I cooked the onions longer than 5 minutes prior to adding the zucchini because I like my onions cooked to a light brown color.  I also used half vegetable oil, half sesame oil.  Aside from that, I followed the directions exactly and it came out wonderfully!  Will make again and again.

This was an okay side dish.  Served with Sweet, Spicy, Sticky Chicken on AR and it complimented it well.   A nice way to prepare the abundance of zucchini when it comes in season.

This is a wounderful recipe that even my picky eaters loved. the sauce is a perfect blend not to sweet not to salty (depending on your soy sauce brand) if using kikkomon i would use less. we will be making this one again.

I loved this recipe!  I used yellow squash and zucchini and it was great. I ate almost the entire pan while waiting on the rest of dinner to cook.  I was out of teriyaki sauce so I used soy plus lemon as suggested by another reviewer.  I also added a splash of sesame oil since I was out of sesame seeds also.  The recipe was so good and I am sure even better when prepared exactly as listed.  Thanks for a great way to prepare zucchini, I usually don't know what in the world to do with it!

I started this recipe with low expectations but was amazed by the change of flavor compared to the same old pan fried zucchini. Served with "Oyako Donburi" and "Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans."

As another reviewer put it, Easy and Delicious.  Adds flavor to a somewhat flavorless veggie.  I still couldn't get my kids to eat zucchini though :-(

Great recipe, I have made it 3 times, each time using a different combination of teriyaki and soy sauce . . . my husband and I thought using just soy sauce was the best and closest to what is served at a restaurant.  My husband says he could eat this at least once a week.

Easy and delicious!  The whole family slurped it all up.  Didn't have teriyaki sauce but it still was a keeper.  We like our zucchini well done (almost mushy) so next time I'll put it in first...then the onions last so they don't get too soggy.  Nice change in using all the garden zucchini on hand right now!

Yummy!  This was the first time that everyone in our household ate all of their veggies.  We'll be having this again, except next time I may try to use sesame seed oil as others have suggested.

My neighbor had given us some fresh zucchini from his garden, I tried this recipe and loved it! I did however do what the Japanese steakhoses do, and put a few "dollops" of butter on top, and I didn't have any sesame seeds, so I had to do without those. But it definately reminded me of eating at the japanese steakhouse...YUMMY!

I fixed this for my visiting family - everyone loved it. The only thing I did different was not to use teriyaki sauce  (I didn't have any) & added yellow squash Next time I'll skip the sesame seeds - didn't need it. Wonderful side dish. THANKS!

These were heaven, the only change was I couldn,t find sesame seeds in the store, so had to omit. All my kids gobbled up these veggies. I served them with brown rice and Oyako Donburi(from this site).

Yum!  My entire family loved it.  I intended to make the recipe exactly as stated, but I accidentally did something different.  I used my food processor to cut the zucchini into strips, but I had the blade turned up-side down.  As a result, the zucchini was very finely chopped.  It didn't matter, though.  The dish was excellent.  With the zucchini being so finely chopped, the dish resembled fried rice and tasted like it, too!  Anyway, I will definitely be making this over and over.  It's delicious!

My whole family loves this even though they all say they dont like zucchini. I have made this several times now and by mistake, I've found that I like to add the sesame seeds right at the end.  For some reason I thought this tasted better. This is going into our permanent collection.

This was so good and so easy.  I used a vegetable peeler to slice the zucchini really thin.  Added a little garlic.  Will make this often.

This was a great, quick side dish.  I didn't have any teriyaki sauce so i substituted with hoisin and some chili sauce - probably not quite the same flavor but this still turned out really good.  Made a nice sauce considering how little liquid went into it.

This was simply delish!!!  So easy and the taste was marvelous.  I will make this again and again and recommend it to family.  I served this as a side dish to Firecracker grilled salmon recipe, also on this site.  I thought the zucchini and onions stole the show. Thanks for a wonderful fall vegetable staple.

This was really good. I made some changes, added a dash of salt and a dash of sugar. I omitted the sesame seeds because I didn't have any. Also i used sesame oil to coat the pan before tossing in the onions. This is similar to a side served at a popular japanese grill. I served it with firecraker alaskan salmon from this site and fried rice.

So yummy! I used a little sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil to give a bit more flavor.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I added a little more sesame seeds and used a garlic teryaki sauce.  Turned out great.

This was the highlight of the meal!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  The Teriyaki sauce added a good flavor without over-shadowing the Zucchini, and I loved the addition of the toasted sesame seeds.  This will be a permanent addition to all of my Asian-inspired dinners.

Very good. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Also added chopped garlic cloves before sauteing the onions. I love Yoshidas's Gourmet Sauce and used this in the place of terriyaki and soy sauce. Twelve year old suggested that we throw some mushrooms in next time!

Good. This would be good with some other veggies too. I used a teriyaki marinade sauce that I don't think worked as well as the product that I normally use. Lesson learned.

This was sooo good. My room mate and I are always frequenting the Japanese restaurant but now we can throw together our own Japanese style dinner. I did add a little more teriyaki and soy sauce; it all depends on your taste buds. This recipe is great, already made it twice!

This was a tasty way to serve zucchini. I added one clove of garlic and a handful of mushrooms, both of which added a lot. Next time I'd cut the teriyaki sauce to 1 T., the dish was a bit strong.

Nice different way to cook up zucchini.  I didn't use teriyaki sauce and I eye balled everything I added to it.  It was tastey and crisp.

YUM! I have never been so satisfied with someone else's recipe before. This tasted just like you would order from a Japanese restaurant. Sesame seeds added a great nutty flavor. We had bought garlic-flavored teriyaki sauce already to use on grilled salmon, so this went perfectly. Thanks!

Really good.  Veggies were still crisp.  I didn't have teriyaki so I used hoisin sauce and it still turned out great.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I halved it (for just 2 people) so there wouldn't be any leftovers.  As my zucchinis overproduce in my garden, I have another delicious use for them.  This would pair nicely with any grilled meat.  Since this dish is very flavored, make sure the flavors of your entree will not compete.  Thanks for the recipe!

VERY TASTY!!  Made this for supper last night.  I used zucchini squash which I found at my local Safeway.  It is smaller than zucchini and I think tastier.  Like other reviewers, I too used a combo of evoo and sesame oil.  I used Kikkoman Honey and Pineapple Teriyaki Baste & Glaze.  I also added carrots cut into thin strips. I took some of the leftovers to work for lunch and I think it tastes even better as leftovers.  

Guess what we are having for supper again tonight?  This time I am going to add fresh minced garlic.  YUMMY!!

Very tasty and refreshing use for zucchini. It was delicious as an Asian style of cooking. I did add some sesame oil to the oil while cooking the onions. I did not use "toasted" sesame seeds and the regular came out fine. I did add some ginger at the end. I like that addition to complete it. It was very good

Very good. I only used 1 T of the teriyaki (half of the amount stated) and that was enough for us, left everything else the same. No, hold on...I'm lying , I did add minced garlic with the onions.
