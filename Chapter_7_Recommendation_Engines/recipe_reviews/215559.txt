Didn't have celery, but used celery seed and it's been my most favorite egg salad thus far!

If you love savory tastes, this is wonderful.  As a variation I added garlic chives, slivered radishes, fresh parsley, fresh dill, and a tiny bit of mint leaves.  I would have loved it on pumpernickel, but instead served it over mixed greens to cut carbs.  This was a wonderful use of the arugula.

Yummy!  The arugula gives it that peppery bite that makes this sandwich perfect!  Thanks!

When I changed the serving size above to 1 serving it changes the Mayo from 2 tbs to 7 1/2 cups! Haha- that is definitely a glitch :P

I thought this was yummy but needed a little kick. It's very creamy but was a little on the blah side. Maybe a little horseradish would do the trick?
