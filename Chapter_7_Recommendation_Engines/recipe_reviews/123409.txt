I used five full free range eggs, four egg whites. I used only 1/4 cup of Black Forest Ham to cut back on the fat, 2% sharp cheddar cheese and I added one chopped red pepper and two cloves minced garlic. My family really liked this. I ate mine with a tablespoon of homemade salsa over the top.

I usually make this on the weekend and cut the recipe in half for me and my husband.  I add some salt, pepper and to make the eggs a little fluffy a bit of half and half.  I serve this with toast and fresh fruit.

I have been using Allrecipies for a while now and I can't believe this is my very first review. I made one serving of this for myself (1 egg, 1 egg white, 1 Slice Ham, 1 Slice Cheese, 1/8 cup onion and added 2 mushrooms) for breakfast this morning and they were great. I am on Weight Watchers right now so I changed the cheese to a slice of 2% Kraft sharp cheddar, I did not add salt and used Ms. Dash table blend seasoning for flavor. For those of you that thought there needed to be more flavor, try that, it was really good. I did not use butter, but instead I used olive oil to saut√© my onion and mushrooms. I kept the basis of the recipe; only changed how healthy the ingredient was. This is my new favorite breakfast item. Thank you for the recipe.

These are very good. I feel the ham and onions lend enough flavor to the eggs without additional salt or pepper. Garlic powder would add an additional variation on flavor.

Easy recipe for really great eggs. I substituted bacon for the ham and onion powder for the onions and added a splash of milk to the egg mixture along with salt and pepper. Served the eggs in a warm tortilla. Fantastic!

My favorite way to eat eggs for breakfast, but usually in an omelet.  This recipe needs some milk or water.  If you like your scrambled eggs or omelets creamy, add milk; water if you prefer them fluffy.  Shredded rather than diced Cheddar, I think, is a better choice.

Hearty scrambled eggs means just that... any less and you take away the "hearty" portion.  This is an excellent recipe to satisfy any man's appetite.

This is outstanding as is.  Easy and tasty!  I did make changes as I was the only one eating it at the time. I cut the recipe in half to have leftovers for myself, added a slight dash of salt and pepper, and topped the cooked eggs with diced tomato when I plated them.  Perfect quick breakfast!  Loved it.

Delicious eggs, Easier than an omelet as I have trouble trying to turn those and have it still look pretty. I left out the mushrooms as I don't like them and used onion powder instead of fresh. This made a very good breakfast, thanks!

Good recipe. I omitted the mushrooms since my family doesn't like them, but did add green peppers and crumbled bacon. This is good!

This was yummy! I scaled it down a bit to feed 2 people. I sauteed the mushrooms and onions in the butter before adding the ham, egg, and cheese. What an easy breakfast!

Nice variation on scrambled eggs, but I agree with the last reviewer--definitely needs more seasoning.

Good but you need additional seasonings like black pepper.
