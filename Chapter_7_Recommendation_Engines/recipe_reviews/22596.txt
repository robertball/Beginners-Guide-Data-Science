I really liked this recipe, though everyone else in my family thought it was too sweet.  I would make it again, though.  It was chocolatey enough and looked really nice.

Chocolate Lover's Torte, it's what's for breakfast! I made this for my dude for Valentine's Day breakfast. Coupled with coffee, milk, and a giant heart shaped box of chocolates I knew I was alive-heaven on earth!

Fairly simple to put togeher. Came out great - didnt settle too much. Tastes great. I used Almond meal in the first, and grated chocolate in the second. Next two are going under lock and key so the kids dont eat them before I can frost them!

I made this for co-workers birthday, and I was embarrassed.  The almonds overpowered all other flavors, and the presentation was terrible. I found it to be a sloppy mess.  I would never recommend this or make it again.
