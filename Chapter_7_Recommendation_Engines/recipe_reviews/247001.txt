I had to add more oats about halfway through, because the batter was too soupy, and the cookies turned out flat.
I probably would use 3 & 1/2 cups of oats instead of the listed 2 & 1/2 cups.
Otherwise, they were delicious!

I had cookies like this once at an apple orchard, that I loved so I went looking for a recipe. These are so good!  Unlike the other reviewer, I didn't have any issues with the batter - it turned out perfectly. I used Red Mill extra thick rolled oats.  The cooking temperature and time, however, left them a little dark on the bottom yet under-cooked inside. So I turn the temperature down to 325 and baked for 15 minutes. Perfect cookies!

Can only give it a 4 star as I love the idea and flavor, but mine came out flat, FLAT! Carmel baked right out of most of them. Two pans in I add about 3/4 tsp baking powder. I live at 9,100 feet and regularly have issues with baking. Read somewhere that baking powder would make them lighter, fluffier, more cake like...This did nothing to help. I like this well enough to try them again, maybe smaller batch and try more baking powder to baking soda.

Really loved these; I did cut back on the brown sugar slightly (about 1/4 cup) and I skipped the salt.  I used crushed up dehydrated apple chips for super intense apple flavor; and, I cut up Wer**** soft caramels for my caramel bits.  I also let the dough rest overnight and rolled into balls and pressed them down slightly to get a consistent size for my cookie exchange.

Soft, chewy, yummy.  These would be super good hot out of the oven with really good vanilla ice cream.
