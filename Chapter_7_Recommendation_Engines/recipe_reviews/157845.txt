This recipe, minus the chicken stock, was made by my grandmother who was born and raised in Ireland. She would just use a ham bone. In Ireland, then did not eat corned beef and cabbage, it was always ham and cabbage.  When Irish immigrants moved to Boston, the jewish neighborhood was nearby. They suggested the corned beef instead, due to the fact that at that time in Boston, corned beef was much cheaper tha ham.  That is the reason for the change, however ham and cabbage is actually the Irish original recipe.

Hubby loved it.  I used leftover Easter ham and frozen hash browns.  He suggests adding carrots and onion to make it heartier.  Easy.

My ham hock was a raw smoked one which needed soaking overnight with regular changes of cold water. I then simmered it in fresh water for 1.5 hours to cook it. After this I used thisrecipe as a base as I didn't fancy a hock and beans/lentils dish but used potatoes, carrots and parsnips as that was what I had. I know that this review is not accurate for the base recipe but as the author hints at it's a great flexible starting point.

Very basic.  Cheap.  Easy.  If you have a good ham hock, you can just use water (even cheaper).  Nothing spectacular, but very good none the less.  I added two small onions and was very glad I did.  They added good flavor that you could really taste because of the few ingredients.

What a great base! I was looking for something to do with Ham Hocks that didn't involve beans.  I made a huge pot and added carrots, onion, garlic, celery and kale (which was amazing) and subbed evap milk for the cream.  Will definately be on the list for my next ham hock.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really tasty and good for you.  I don't think I added any cream (can't remember).  I did use a ham bone and a slow cooker.

This soup was sensational and I've shared it with others many times.  I did make some changes but only because I had extra vegetables sitting around and I didn't want them to go to waste.  That is what is so great about this recipe, vegetables can be added and subtracted easily so the versatility is high in this soup.  Prior to adding any of the ingredients, I saut√©ed carrots, onions, celery and garlic in some olive oil in order to sweat them slightly (about 2-3 minutes).  Then I followed the recipe as directed.  The meat on the ham hock just fell off the bone and tasted so tender.  It was amazing.  My husband and I could not get enough.  Do not pass this recipe up!

I used to eat this when I was younger as I grew up with a garden.  
I did not have a ham hock, so I cubed a small ham steak, still delicious.

This was an awesome recipe. I made a last minute decision not to make fried cabbage and potatoes and went searching for casserole ideas when I found this recipe. I added onions, sauteed garlic, and broccoli. I used leftover honey-baked ham instead of the ham hock, and chicken bouillon because I didn't have stock. I made a roux, whisked in some of the broth and added it when the soup was almost done for thickness. A generous dash of adobo seasoning... Delicious. Next time... I'm thinking of adding broccoli, and fresh grated Parmesan.

My version was Poor Irish/Grenadian Soup. Instead of potato, I used christophine or chayote. Halved all ingredients to reduce to 2 servings.

I'll definitely make  this again. I swapped the chicken broth for vegetable broth, added one medium onion and a splash of vinegar, and left out the cream.  It was delicious!

I made this  in the crockpot as written adding some minced onion.  It did not look like enough broth when starting and there wasn't so when it was near done I ended up adding 2 more cups of chicken broth.  We will be making this again.

Hubby calls this "comfort food." I add whatever I have - carrots, leeks, turnips, parsnips - but the base is always the same. I like to serve it with warm bread from the bread machine. It packs well for lunches, and tastes better the next day.
