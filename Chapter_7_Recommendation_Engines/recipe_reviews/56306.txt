..This was excellent !! - Prepared everything almost like the recipe says. One of the things I did different after reading everyones reviews was - slicing the onion - too many people remarked on the water in the bottom of the pan - so - I cut the onion about an inch thick, then sliced it in half again.Then I spaced the onion in the bottom of the pan so that I could balance the hamburger on top of the onion. I used a glass dish. I also added some cheese - any kind you preferred would work ! I used a blend of mozzarella, provolone, romano, and parmesan. The other thing I did on accident - was I used deer meat. I dont do deer meat- I did that night! Cant wait to try using hamburger !  MY HUSBAND loved it ! Add some fried potato's - I have to admitt it was awesome! Thank you so much! I really enjoy reading what you guys write in about the recipes you try. Thanks!  Daygoingraham

I initially read this recipe because it sounded so odd, then decided to give it a try. I had a bag of frozen hamburger patties I'd previously made up from a big package of beef I'd bought earlier, so I was not able to put anything in the hamburger patties. Instead I sprinkled them with Montreal steak seasoning about an hour ahead of time. I then followed the recipe except I used beef broth in the dish rather than water. I also made up some gravy to serve over them which just seemed to fit with the delicious onions. I followed the advice of others and sliced the onions pretty thick to keep the patties out of the liquid, consequently I felt I had to bake them at least 45 minutes to have the onions cooked well. The onions were so good, I think next time I will fill the entire bottom of the dish with onions. The extra onions will be gobbled up. My picky eaters thought this was one of the best things they'd ever eaten. It reminded me somewhat of a country fried steak. A definite Keeper!

This was very good. I used a large red onion and with the little water, the onion flavor simmered through very nicely!  It is important to note that the burgers should not be "in" the water, they will get soggy so make sure you use a hearty onion.  My husband (a beef farmer) really enjoyed this one, thanks!

These really turned out great!  We ate them on hamburgers buns but I think next time we'll opt to eat them solo, maybe with mashed potatoes on the side.  Be careful how much water you put in the bottom of your casserole dish, once the burgers start cooking, the juices from the burgers mix with the water, and the level raises a bit. Really a great recipe, and will be making again!

I don't eat meat, but my husband said it was good.  The onions soften as the cook, so they don't support the burgers up out of the water.  My burgers produced more oil while cooking in the oven so there was more liquid and the burgers got soggy on the bottom.  I flipped them over and placed under the broiler till they weren't soggy.  I'll cook this again but next time I'll use a broiler pain to hold the burgers up away from the juices.

Scrumptious! My family loved this tasty and easy meal to prepare. I did follow the advice of other reviewers, making sure I only used just enough water to line the bottom of the pan and not too much (covering the onions). I also sprinkled a light layer of breadcrumbs and some grated parmesan cheese over the onions before placing the meat on top to bake. This added flavor to the onions, combined with the juices from the meat after it was done. To complete the meal, I put each burger with some of the onions on a toasted hamburger bun with a side of broccoli and a side of macaroni.

This was tasty and easy. Husband and kids enjoyed it. We did add cheese on top. Good option when you don't have buns on hand.

These were good. A nice change from the plain old hamburger steak that I usually make. I did not have a problem with them coming out soggy, although I did cut my onions pretty thick so the hamburgers were not in the water. Both my 3 year old daughter and my husband loved them. I prepared them pretty much as the recipe shows, except I added about a 1/4 cup of bacon bits to the hamburger mixture. I also made up a batch of brown gravy to serve alongside the steaks. Will be making this again. Thanks

This is delicious!!  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs for added flavor.  I would have like the breading to be a bit more crispy but didn't want to overcook the hamburger.  Next time, I will use less oil and fry a bit longer.  Doesn't need worcesterhire sauce.  Omitted it.

Wonderful!  I made this for dinner tonight along with homemade french fries.  Hint: Cut your onion slices thick so that the patties can sit on top of them without touching the water.  The onions end up tasting like they are sauted.

A little dry.  I prefer my burgers more on the rare side and wasn't sure how to time them in the oven.  They tasted a little more like mini meat loafs than a hamburger.  My son just smothered it in ketchup and devoured it, so it worked out.

I made these according to the recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars  was brcause it took longer than 25-30 minutes to finish cooking.We just don't eat red/pink hanburger. Other than that it so good . Thanks for the post.

This was not a hit at our house.  The burgers were dry and didn't have enough flavor.  I may try "tweaking" it to see if I can improve to our liking.  Just didn't go off well! :(

These were delicious! They turned out so juicy and with a really great onion flavor from the baking. The onions from the bottom of the pan make a great topping for them, too.

I didn't change anything and I don't think I ever would. This one is great as is!

I thought the breaded hamburgers were very good. I was just looking for something new and different to try with hamburger. I had to improvise because I didn't have some of the ingredients available. I subsituted soy sauce for the worchistier (lol can't spell) sauce and used stuffing bread crumbs. It turned out great. I was afraid it would be very dry, but it was juicy and yummy. Thanks for the great idea and recipe!

My sister and I grew up and a similar version we still call the "Hungarian Hamburger", breaded and deep fried.  No need for all the fuss with putting it into the oven - just continue frying it in the pan.  If you're concerned about fat and calories - use leaner beef or turkey and make sure your oil is hot enough to begin with which keeps your food from soaking up too much oil.

I make this all the time and we are never disappointed! The only thing I changed is that I only seem to need one egg - that's always sufficient. Other than that, I haven't changed a thing and basically know the recipe by heart now. Thanks for the yummy recipe! A family favorite  :)

I followed the recipes, minus the garlic powder...  I also used seasoned bread crumbs...  it was yummy!  Husband also loved it, so much that he wanted it again the next day!  1st time I sat it on the onions and added beef broth to the pan, 2nd time just placed them on a rack in the pan with water added to the dish...  to me it was a waste of onion the 1st time...  still tasted yummy!  I served them on top of mashed potatoes and poured gravy all over it! Mmmmmm!

It definately wasn't the best, but came close.  I like to change it up when it comes to meals that are always prepared the same way.  This was not only easy, but had a really good "burger" flavor to it.  Good alone or served on a bun.

Surprisingly good spin on the traditional hamburger.  These come out yummy and moist.  My husband and I just love them!  I actually use more than one onion so that I can completely line the pan.  I also make sure the rings are two or three layers deep.  This keeps them from breaking down, so your burgers won't drop into the water.  I never would have thought to cook burgers this way, but I really like it!

I made these tonight for dinner and we thought they were pretty bland.  Unfortunately, the onions didn't impart a lot of flavour (even though we used more than called for and used chicken broth instead of water).  On the plus side, the burgers were moist and the bread crumb coating with crispy...but apart from that, they were forgettable I'm afraid.

Very good, twist from a regular hamburger pattie.  Added my own surprise taste with diced cheese (used pepper jack, my favorite) to hamburger mixture.  Definite keeper.

I really liked the breading on these.  I thought they tasted pretty good.  My husband cleaned his plate, but said they tasted like meatloaf.  The onions didn't have a lot of flavor to me, but were nice and soft.  Good, easy dish for the weeknight!

Very good recipe, just wanted reiterate the fact that the burgers should be on the onions above the water.  Otherwise soggy burgers are the result.

Thanks Baybers this was really good and the king of the castle loved it. I substituted some of our favorite BBQ sauce for the worcestershire sauce but otherwise did exactly as the recipe stated. Very moist and very different. I actually was looking for some ideas to spice up hamburgers and was thinking more grilling but this made them so moist its worth the extra effort.

I really liked this recipe-and so did my husband. I kept everything the same but I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I added a grilling sauce instead. I loved it and it had a great taste. You can add anything in place of the sauce, like BBQ, ketchup, and it still tastes great. I also like it that the hamburger isn't cooking in its grease-like most meatloafs. Thanks for this idea!

I stuck mostly to the recipe but added chopped up bacon pieces to the burger patties. My big difference was that I didn’t have an onion to do rings, I had already chopped onion. I thought I could balance them on that, but then decided they weren’t big enough and after reading reviews, tried putting the water and onions on the pan and balanced the burgers on a rack above it.  It did end up making the bottoms a little soggy anyway as they steamed. But everyone still liked it quite well, so I’ll definitely try them again with the actual onion rings.

I served then over garlic egg noodles.  A little greasy but moved them from oven to broiler and made them a little firmer and crispier.  Easy night and clean up.  Thank you.

I made this as is but then fired up the smoker and smoked it with mesquite for 2 hours. On top of the burger I added smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, mustard powder, brown sugar, chilli powder and a smidge of celery salt. Once the burgers we’re covered in the rub into the smoker they went. I then mixed zucchini slices with olive oil and Parmesan and grilled on the bbq. Pulled the burgers out after 2 hours added our favorite cheese, topped the cheese with the grilled zucchini and a nice freshly picked tomato from the garden. Heaven! The bread crumbs was a nice base to start and retained the moisture in the burger.

Cheers!

This was a big hit. The only things I changed were I used Panko breadcrumbs and added cheese and a bun. On the onions I seasoned them with olive oil, salt, pepper and smoked paprika. I did not add the water, only because I’m not a fan of super soft onions.

My husband enjoyed it.   I did put  several onions on the bottom to separate the water from hamburger.  When the meat cooked it also added juices to the water and then the bottom of the burger got soggy.  So I suggest adding enough onion to separate the burger from all juices on the bottom.

It was a really good recipe, but I added a 1/2 package of lipton onion soup mix to the meat and used very little water. Only needed 1 egg to dip the burger in and used kellog cornflake crumbs for breading mix. I cut the onions really thick--about an inch.

I feel bad about this one.  This didnt go over well but it didnt go over bad either with the family.  My mother ended up adding bbq sauce to the top of her burger to get it down but she did eat it all up.  My boyfriend said it was not bad at all but it lacked flavor and that might be my fault.  My son watched me season the meat and when he tasted it he said that with as much seasoning i put in the meat he thought the taste would be stronger than what it was.  So I would suggest ensuring the seasoning is appropiate to really capture the taste folks will enjoy.

I guess I really don't get this recipe, but it is good. I think the burgers tasted more like mini meatloafs. I sliced the onions large and set burgers on top, but they still fell....glad I used beef broth instead of water! I also made up some brown gravy to go along...it just isn't a regular meal for us, but it was good.

This was very good and easy.  I put fresh mushrooms and bellpepper and used terakyi suace instead of worsh.  My family liked it although one of my sons thought it was too much like meatloaf. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe. Try with Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. The kids have fun breaking them up and you get a slightly different flavor.

This was a great hit at dinner.  Very simple.  I did add more seasoning kind of winged based on others comments. I garnished with american cheese and the onion the burger sat on and fixed a size of oven rosted potatoes.

I tried this and it turned out like it was supposed to and I did not like the flavor at all and ended up cooking something else. My husband did not like it either. My son on the other hand loved it.

I made this recipe as is but I must have used a baking dish that was too heavy and hamburger that has too lean.  If making this recipe I would suggest cooks use 80% or more fat and a baking dish that is a simple casserole or thin metal.  I used 85-90% lean hamburger and a stoneware baking dish and the hamburgers were dry and the onions didn't get cooked.  The stoneware is heavy and probably didn't heat up quick enough to cook the onions before drying out the lean hamburgers.  I have high hopes for this one so I will try it again.  I hope this helps others.

This was a little unusual for our tastes.  We didn't particularly like the breading on the outside of the hamburger.

Fried hamburger is a pretty plebian meal, but I am still giving this 5 stars.   This will be the way I make hamburger patties from now on because it was much better than the usual fried-in-a-pan burger..  Both my husband & I liked this recipe. Loved the crunch on the outside.  Thanks for the recipe Baybers!

Baybers-Your greatgrandmother was right on the money with this recipe.  I have some very picky eaters in my family and they all cleaned their plates with your breaded hambergers.  Thank You

Very good, it went over very well in our house.  My 6 year old boy liked it and then my husband really liked it the next day!
