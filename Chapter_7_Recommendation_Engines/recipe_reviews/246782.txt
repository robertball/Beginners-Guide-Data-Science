My husband made these and the flavor was amazing!  He didn't make them in the packets. He pan fried the sliced chicken and veggies and added the sauce and cooked noodles.  The veggies were delicious. (Omitted the mushroom)
Ps I am a huge Reynolds wrap fan.  It use it daily for wrapping my kids mini subs for school lunch. So chances are when I make it again I'll use it.

I loved it.  I used gluten-free ramen noodles that were made with millet and brown rice.  I used Sriacha so my husband had some issues with it.  I will make it again to suit his taste better.  Like the other reviewer, I did not use the pockets.  I also made it vegetarian.  It's fun to change it up with whatever vegetables you have on hand.

We really liked this dish. Made it exactly as written and I don’t think we’d change a thing.

I was looking for a way to use up leftover chicken and vegetables.  OK, I made a lot of modifications because I didn't have all the ingredients - but what a great idea!  My husband ate every bite and asked for more!

This was great.  I used 1 lb boneless/skinless chicken thighs, and broccoli slaw instead of the red cabbage. Cooked it in the foil packets, then poured it all in a big bowl to serve. The foil packets made it very easy. Will definitely make again.
