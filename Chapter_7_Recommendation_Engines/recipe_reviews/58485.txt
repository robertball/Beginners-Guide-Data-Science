I added fresh garlic which I sauteed with the onion a bit before using.
I also omitted the wild rice (to reduce carbs), used an entire quart of chicken broth, and pureed the soup before serving.  To each serving I then added a dollop of plain nonfat yogurt, toasted slivered almonds, and fresh thyme leaves.  This was a perfect autmnal soup.

SO YUMMY!!!!  My husband and I really enjoyed this hearty vegetarian soup.  I did add 3-4 more cups of chicken broth, an extra 1/2 pound of yams, a rice mixture with wild, brown, and white rice and only used 1/2 an onion and it was delicious!  I also left out the onion powder since I didn't have any.  I will make it again for sure!

This was very good - I didn't have wild rice, so substituted brown rice and added it in at the beginning with all other ingredients.  Moderately spicy, depending on the curry powder used.

This is a definite 5 star soup! I double the chicken broth, and lightly fried the yams before adding to the boing broth.  I then sauteed the onion, adding chopped cellery and garlic cloves (about 5) for a few minutes before adding to broth, and sauteed and added a diced potato instead of rice. It has become my favorite soup!!

Wonderful recipe. I used 4 cups vegetable broth instead of chicken and added a dash of poultry seasoning. Even with the extra broth it turned into a very thick, chunky stew, which I actually loved! My husband loved the thickness too and all of the different flavors. I agree about the wild rice - its adds the only contrasting color in a sea of orange!

My husband actually called his mother and told her about this soup the next day. She called and asked for the recipe! Mother-in-law asking me for cooking advice? Let's just say that's never happend before!

Used 6 cups of broth and 1 1/2 pounds yams and found this made for a balanced consistancy. Added a clove of garlic instead of the powder and a touch of tabasco. Please try to use wild rice! It makes for a beautiful presentation!

I loved this! I too added fresh garlic, and also added in some celery. I didn't add much extra broth, because i wanted it to not be very soupy. But it would of been easy to add adjust the consistency. Its a nice something different meal. Delish!

WONDERFUL SOUP! And so easy!  The only things I changed was I omitted the onion powder because there was already onion in the recipe.  I also used minced garlic instead of the powder as others had suggested.  I cooked the rice seperate in chicken broth.  Then followed the instuctions for boiling the yams (about 20 min.  40 min. would be too long.)  Once yams were tender I added cooked rice.  I was afraid that the rice would not get cooked and that is why I did it this way.  It looked really good but I decided to use a potato smasher to "messy smash" some of the potatoes and leave some of them not smashed.  The result was a thicker soup that was just WONDERFUL.  I will make this again and again. Thanks!

Wonderful flavor and easy, easy prep, but I tripled the amount of chicken broth; three cups wasn't even close to enough.  Also added a bit more curry powder and black pepper.  Super with an Indian themed meal or just with a green salad on the side and some white wine.  Kicked up, easy, vegetarian comfort food!

My hubby loved this, I didn't have 2 pds of yams so I used 1 pd. yam 1 pd. sweet potato.  Still very very yummy:)  I was scared they wouldn't cook so I cooked them separately(the yams and potato) from the rest.  I also used 4 cups of broth, didn't add the onion powder and cooked the rice for 25 min. in the broth then added the potatoes just until they heated up again.  Very very yummy and easy.  We had this on a hot evening and it still was great! Thanks

My wife made this and I thought it was boring. It tasted like pureed yams and curry powder. It wasn't as elegant tasting as an Indian dish, tho it smelled like it. We are vegetarians, so we omitted the chicken broth and used veggie broth instead. Maybe it's better with chicken broth? I tend to like dishes with many facets of flavor and this wasn't my cup of tea. I prefer my wife's white bean soup which is just as simple, but bucket loads more flavorful.

I'd been looking for a warm, filling soup for the Fall and Winter, and I think this is it!  It was very easy to make.  I took the advice of others and used about 6 cups of chicken stock.  I already had some wild rice that was cooked, so that was even easier!  Thanks!

Hello. Yes it needs more chicken broth, and a bit longer to fully cook the rice. I would say reduce the first 20 min, and give the rice longer. This way it doesn't get too mushy. It was delicious! I added some baby carrots :)

a great combo of sweet and spicy. i used 4 cups of chicken broth and 1.5 lbs of yams. the only reason this wasn't a 5 is because i'm not the biggest fan of spice, but that's not the recipe's fault ... if you really like curry, you'll love this. i peeled the yams before dicing.

I think this is so tasty, but I made some modifications. I used 1/4 teaspoon of curry as I don't like strong curry flavor, added a dash of cinnamon, and I added some boiled chicken to the soup, so it's yams, chicken and rice. I also pureed some of the yams/onions to add some thickness and more flavor to the broth. Also, double your liquids; 3 cups is not even close to enough broth. Tasty and rich, perfect for Fall/Winter!

This is a tasty soup that both my husband and I enjoyed.  It was slightly sweeter than I expected (and than we both prefer), which is why it didn't get 5 stars.  I used a high quality yam that was quite deep in color, which potentially contributed to the sweetness.

My mom, being mom, of course said "This soup is WONDERFUL dear, it's just PERFECT." (Ah, moms. So nice even if your dish tastes like doggy poop.)Sadly, my bro and I followed the recipe exactly. The big problem was it turned out too spicy and the rice didn't fully cook. Texture was good though, and the taste could have been a lot worse, I guess.Only OK.

I used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian.  The box was just shy of 3 cups since I used it for another recipe and added close to a cup of water.  I used Bismati rice instead of wild rice.  There were 2 yams on hand, which might have been around 2 pounds.  I used actual garlic instead of the powder and sauteed it with red onion and omitted the onion power.  While tasting I added a touch of garlic salt, and more of the spices to the soup.

This was a really easy dinner.  I added a can of navy beans for protein and used a handful of pearl onions instead of one big one.  The curry with the yams was suprisingly good.  Warm and creamy.  Thanks!

We made this in a slow cooker. We we're going on a hike and wanted something warm when we got home. We added one extra cup of broth and didn't add rice. We had one chicken breast left over from the day before so I fried it up and added. Cook time 6 hours on low, it came out excellant.

I love the sweetness with the spice. It's a flavorful dish, less soup but more of the consistency of a risotto dish as the rice takes up most of the liquid. I find that using wild,rice just takes too long for the rice to cook, so,stick with white rice only.

This was ok. I had to double the broth as there was not nearly enough and it was a bit too spicy for me.

Very yummy! I fried the onions, fresh garlic (substituted garlic powder) and diced yams before putting in the soup. I think this gave the soup an extra wonderful flavor.

I used this as a base recipe. I added more veggie broth and water to sauteed leeks and garlic. I also added some brocolli and beet greens. I tend to prefer creamier soups and I found using my food processor on a few ladels of soup when it was near done helped to "bulk up" the soup. Only 4 stars because it was a but too sweet for me.

Great soup! I doubled the broth, added rice earlier but still wasn't ready. Next time I'll rice together with yams & onions or skip the rice and add different veggies. I also added 1 lb of chicken at the beginning and 1/2 tsp of coriander and cumin.

Delicious soup.  I used a mix of brown and dark wild rice and added it at the same time as the onions and sweet potatoes because it takes longer to cook.  I did add additional chicken stock as the rice soaked it up.  Love it!!
