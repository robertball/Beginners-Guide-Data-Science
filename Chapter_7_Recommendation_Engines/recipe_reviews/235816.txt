Made this today...a huge hit...everyone was hesitant at first (being "City People") but after a little coaxing it wasn't long before I received rave reviews!

This is how we made it when I was a child. The only other thing we did was add a touch of vanilla extract. So delicious and brings back great memories!

Add one can of evaporated milk plus a pinch of salt and 1 Tbsp of vanilla extract and you have a real winner without the raw egg that a lot of recipes call for.

I made this recipe today (during winter storm PAX...lots of snow). It sooo reminded me of my Moms Homemade Ice Milk she used to make for us when we were kids back in the late 50's/early 60's....YUM!!! Such memories. I did use my HUGE stainless steel mixing (for catering) bowl...probably too much snow for the recipe. Due to that, I definately would have added a second can of sweetened condensed milk. I also added 1 Tablespoon of vanilla. Try it and enjoy!

My mom made this for us when we were kids, I've made it for mine & now I still make it just for me. It's great to still be able to have something of the past that was really good.    Brenda
