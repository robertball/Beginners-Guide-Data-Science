This is a great breakfast treat - tastes like sticky buns, but pulls apart.  I always spray the bundt pan with Pam so everything comes out easy.  I do nuts (walnut instead of pecans) add some raisins and 1 tsp. of vanilla to the butter / sugar mixture. I also use a mix of brown and white sugars - for the remaining sugar mixture. When it's done, just invert the whole thing onto a plate and get out a ton of napkins!

I used four cans (7.5 oz) buttermilk bisquits and cut them in halves instead of fourths.  My kids loved this recipe and it is easy enough they can help.  I thought it was better the second day warmed with a little butter.

Wonderful, quick and easy - great for church on Sunday mornings or a holiday morning.  I have assembled everything (other than the butter/ topping mix) and refrigerated the covered bundt pan overnight - wake up, add the topping and bake!  Good stuff.

OMG! Absolutely delicious. I was in the mood for a little something different so I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar & 3/4 cup of white sugar instead of all white sugar, and added just a dash or so of cocoa powder in with sugar and cinnamon. I also sprinkled just a handful of chocolate chips on top before baking.

i followed this recipe to a t and when i turned over the bread onto a platter 95 percent of it wasn't cooked. I don't understand how it worked out for everyone else. But it didn't work at all for me.

This is easy and really good! I think 35 min. was a little too long to bake.  I will cut down 5-7 minutes next time.

First of all ...I'd like to clarify a point within the recipe  It says " bundt pan".  I read in some reviews where people had an overflow problem. I used a 12 cup bundt pan and it baked all the way to the top edge of the pan but did not overflow.  There are some bundt pans that are an 8 cup capacity.  So I can see where some people using an 8 cup may have had overflow problems. Secondly, another reviewer wrote that monkey bread was not entirely done in 35 minutes.  I took mine out of oven at 35 and stuck a toothpick down in middle . and found it to be doughy. I baked it another 15 minutes.    Recipe does not specify whether or not to cool the monkey bread prior to inverting it onto a platter.  I opted to to that using oven mits, straight out of the oven and it came out beautifully.  I could only imagine the carmalized butter sugar mix, glueing to the pan once it was cooled.  Lastly I sprinkled nuts in the well greased bundt pan as the recipe calls for.  this was ok, but next time I make it I will put a few in the bottom and then scatter them as I layer the cut biscuits... which by the way, I used two cans of Grands Buttermilk.  Using the poultry scissors dipped in water each time it was hassle free to cut them.  This is an awesomely easy and decadently delicious sweet treat.  My husband and son love it!  Thank you to Betty Shell for an awesome recipe!  This one's a keeper.

I followed this recipe to the T and the center was still gooey and the "sauce" was just crystallized sugar... Reading the reviews, I thought I was in for a treat!  I was very disappointed.

I must admit that my overall optimism was high while putting this together to bake. I was pretty excited! However, once I baked the bread, and turned it out onto to a platter... well. It was pretty to look at, but the butter crystalized the sugar while cooking, so the top and sides were a crunchy, sticky mess, and not in a good way! The flavor was OKAY, but it certainly could use a little more zip, or pep, because it was a rather bland tasting sweet bread. I wouldn't recommend this. The idea was good, but the bread was a fail. :( Sorry.

This recipe didn't get as gooey and delicious as other recipes I have tried.  Save the biscuit dough and the calories for a recipe that's worth it.  Keep looking.

Great recipe.I was looking for a recipe to use up a few cans of Pillsbury Grand biscuits.  I cut them in quarters. I also don't have a Bundt pan, so I used a 9x13 cake pan.  I used real butter instead of margarine.  I had to make a bit of extra cinnamon/sugar/butter mix...but it turned out great.  The kids all raved about it.

I've made other versions of Monkey Bread and this didn't work out so well for me.  I used butter instead of margarine and the melted butter/white sugar mixture didn't filter through the pieces while baking like other recipes have.  It left me with a chunk of butter/sugar candy on the top (which is the bottom when removed from the pan) which was tasty, but wasn't the desired result.  I also used raisins instead of pecans.  Overall this is a great "simple" treat, but not the best version I've tried.  I've used a brown sugar version that I'll go back too if I can find it!

SUPER YUMMY- I have a fast version that is great too. Same ingredients, only I melt the butter, stir in the sugar and cinnamon to the butter. Cut up my pieces, stack in the bundt pan and pour the mixture over top. Bake 30ish mins. Its great for when I'm in a hurry!

Excellent and easy.... Even with generic buttermilk biscuits.  Next time I might try the "Grands" brand.

This took about 15 minutes prep time. Not the 5 as stated. I omitted the nuts but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I didn't have any problems with it being under or over cooked. I think it turned out great. All 8 kids that were here loved it. It was gone too quickly to have any left overs. This was the first time I ever made monkey bread and being so easy to make, I will be making this again for the kids.

this one is pretty good! i like to have a lot of the drizzle on mine, so i think is the one with a lot. also, i used the buttered Grands biscuits. NOTE: if you do decide to use the grands, only use TWO tubes or else they suck up all the drizzle and itll be a little dry; also itll be more done on the outside and gooey in the middle. to reheat wrap in foil and bake at 350 for about 5-10 minutes, tastes like it was fresh!!! shalom and happy baking

While I agree this recepie is easy yo make & it does taste great, the only problem I found was by pouring the butter/sugar mixture on before cooking, once its cooked & you invert the pan, all the carmalized suger ends up on the bottom. Maybe next time I will drizzle it between each layer.

We are stuck at home due to flooding today and I decided to try something different for my fickle 3 yr old. Usually if I let him help cook, he will at least try it so I let him help make this easy recipe. And he is still gobbling it down as I type this, so I would call this one a great success! :) I did cut the recipe down for just one can of biscuits since it is just the two of us and I used walnuts instead of pecans. I also just a teaspoon of nutmeg but otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter and it was wonderful! Definitely a new family favorite and we will be having again and again I am sure.

This was really good, but I think I improved upon it by adding miniature marshmellows sprinkled throughout the biscuits. It made it more sticky and yummy. Really good!

I made this recipe this morning -- halving the ingredients, but still placing in a bundt pan.  I had to put in for an additional 15 minutes, and I'm still not convinced the middle was completely done.  But the taste was wonderful -- and I will definitely make again (just allow for more baking time!)

I followed this recipe exactly as the instructions said, and it did not come out good at all. The bottom did not cook, however that was not what bothered me. There was too much sugar left to mix with the butter and the top caramelized, instead of soaking through the bread. I saw another recipe which said to mix the butter with 1/3 cup sugar, I recommend that.

I found this recipe too doughy and too while-sugary. Next time, I might increase the cooking time and decrease the sugar mixture put on top.

I have had monkey bread before & could not find my recipe.  This one sounded a lot like the one I had so I tried it.  I followed the directions to a T & it did not turn out the way I remembered monkey bread.  The gooey butter mixture did not ooze throughout the bread so only the top was carmelized & stickey.  If I make this one again I would use more butter.

This came out great. I did add 2 cans of fried apples to it though which brought it to another level of wonderful. I have made it without apples and it is wonderful either way.

For the sauce that is pours over the top, i added 2 tablespoons of corn syrup, some caramel sauce i made, vanilla, and nuts/dried fruit. I did not use Grands biscuits though, i made my own dough because i am broke and i have no money to go buy cinnamon rolls or biscuit dough. Over all this recipe was great! If you re-hydrate your dried raisins/cranberries its even better!!!

I made this for our Christmas morning brunch.  It was easy and relatively fast.  It was good, but not great.  I was not fond of the taste of the dough - the canned, store-bought flavor was too prominent for my liking.  I guess I prefer home-made dough, but of course that is much more work and time.  I used only  two cans of the biscuit dough which filled the bundt pan produced a large ring of sweet bread.  I don't think I"ll make this again.
