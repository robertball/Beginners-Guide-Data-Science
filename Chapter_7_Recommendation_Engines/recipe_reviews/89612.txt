What an excellent recipe!!! First off let me say that this does not quite feed 6 people(more like 2.5). I bought a little over 3lbs (exactly 6 oxtails) and it fed 2 people with very little leftovers. I did trim my oxtails a little so that I would not end up with a pot of grease. Also I slightly altered the recipe (I always end up doing that) by adding 2 cans of beef broth, doubled both the Greek seasoning and season all, used a little worcestershire sauce in place of browning sauce, and doubled the garlic. Oh and I cooked for 3 hours(TENNNDER). The gravy is sooo good. I served this with Jamaican style rice and peas and fried plantains (from this site). I will post a pic soon of this wonderful dish. It certainly is a soul food blast from the past. Thanks so much for posting this!!!

Nice recipe!  A few  tips...BEFORE adding garlic, onions and dry seasonings in step 1, bring the oxtails to a boil and skim off the gray scum that comes to the top, then add seasonings.  This makes for a clearer, purer tasting broth.  Also, if time permits, refrigerate broth overnight when the oxtails are cooked.  The next day the layer of fat will have hardened and can be removed completely...so much healthier and and the flavors marry overnight for better taste.  I also omitted the additional teaspoon of seasoning salt since my broth was just fine with the 1 tablespoon of salt.

I was really nervouse when making this dish but it turned out perfectly. I didn't use the "greek seasonings" just Lawry's seasoned salt and pepper and it was fine. And oxtails are relatively fatty, so if you've never had them like one of the commenters below then don't be surprised. You can trim it down though. But that's where most of the flavor is in my opinion.

This happens to be a very good recipe for good ol' oxtails. Oxtails are fatty (for those who don't know) and are traditionally cooked this way. It is best to boil them first, to get rid of some of the fat. They will still have fat on them. Add tomatoes if you like or whatever! Normally, it ends up "stew-like" because of the cooking time and gravy. The meat should fall off the bone when eaten. I would love to hear other variations as far as gravy or sauce. I myself can't help but eat oxtails swimming in gravy! If you are overly concerned about the fat...don't make it. Thanks! Great recipe!

I am txnurse5 and I must admit that it does not feed 6.  My recipe is written as an "observer". This recipe is strictly an observer recipe.  I watched my mother, grandmother and aunt make this meal.  It's all a matter of seasoning and tasting.  That's how it's done in the south.  Don't be afraid to experiment with different spices and techniques.  I have grown up with this rule, so don't be afraid to experiment!!!

Usually cook oxtails in a crock pot so next time I'll follow the recipe and slow cook on low for 6 hrs.  Great mix of flavors and the gravy was awesome.  This is a keeper!

I made this just the way that it was written! When I tell you AWESOME! I MEAN AWESOME! My children ate it, everyone ate it and it was phenomenal! It's a must eat...and must try! The gravy was so good, I kept some and froze it for when I make homemade mashed potatoes in the future. I used yellow rice for this recipe, since we love yellow rice so much and it was a perfect twist for this recipe~ If you have never eaten OXTAILS, try this recipe! You are sure to fall in love~

Great recipe!  I'd like to share at tip from a Julia Child cookbook -- place oxtails in a baking pan, add 1 carrot, 1 rib celery and 1/2 onion with skins - all chopped coarsely.  Place on rack in top third of oven preheated to 450 degrees.  Bake for 40 minutes, turning and basting every 10 minutes.  This eliminates the browning in oil and spatters.  Drain and pour off fat, deglaze pan with water or red wine and proceed with recipe.

Wonderful recipe! Make sure you double the gravy, there was a "fight" over the last ladle full left in the bowl (I won)

Have made this dish once before as writen and fell in love with it.  I do add bay leaf when boiling along with garlic and onion. Since then I have experimented with some ingredients like once the tails are cooked down. I put in a pay some brown sugar just two table spoons with little oil let it cook down till it forms bubbles then add in oxtails until they are coated then add in celery, scallions, and cilantro that I placed in a blender to get to a smooth paste and added that to the tails, and broth and then back to the cooking.  Just different take on it.  You cant go wrong unless you forget to double the gravy. Lord nothing better than the gravy and rice a day later.

Yummy! I made this last night and it was amazing. I cooked the oxtails the night before and the only thing I did different was use onion powder and garlic powder instead of onioin and garlic. I cooked for 3 hours and the water reduced down a lot. I put the broth in the fridge so I could take the fat off the next day. The next day I warmed the oxtails in the oven on 275 for 30 min. I took the fat off the broth and warmed it in the microwave and I only had about 1/2 c of broth so I tasted it and it was really salty so I just added water to it to make a cup and used low sodium chicken broth for the other cup. Made gravy as recipe says and used worchester for browning sauce. When it was done I put the oxtails in the gravy and cooked on low for about 30 min. I give it only 4 stars bc the broth doesnt make 2 cups but thats ok bc it probably would have been too salty. Make sure you add broth slowly when you stir it in (about 1/4-1/2 c at a time).

I had never tasted oxtails before and wanted to try something different. Maybe I should've trimmed the fat first because they were very fatty. The taste was okay, but tasted too "stewy". I browned the meat first and sauteed the onion and garlic before adding the water. Glad I can say I've had them, but probably won't make again. Sorry!

This recipe was amazing! I trimmed some of the fat off the meat before cooking.  I made this in a big pot as called for and didn't realize before hand that the long cooking time would lead to evaporation.  I just kept adding a mixture of water and chicken broth (I would have used beef broth but didn't have any on hand) so that the oxtails were always covered by liquid.  I did not find this recipe too salty at all and the meat of the oxtails fell off the bone! The gravy was also amazing. I made Jamaican rice and peas (from a family recipe) to go with the oxtails and gravy.  I will definitely make it again!

Fabulous ! I have milked cows and the thought of eating a piece of cow tail was never on my list of things to do. But, I ran across a pound of tails marked down from $3.99 to $1.99 a pound so what he heck. I read some other reviews, some sounded right. Boil tails and skim the scum before adding the veggies and spice, let tails and broth settle overnight then pick off about 75% of the white fat cap. Also, two pounds of tails and this recipe would be a streth for 3 servings. The gravy makes this dish, I think it is more brown sauce than gravy. I WILL be back.  Thanks for the recipe !

I really didn't use the top portion of the recipe, but I can't knock it.  I used the Gravy portion and received rave reviews from family and friends on New Year's Day as to how well the Oxtails came out.  I loved the gravy and saved it when all the oxtails where gone and just had a great bowl of rice and gravy.  This was a very pretty color gravy and thicken quite well. Will use this recipe again.

I only season with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning.  I put the onions in a crockpot and let them cook on low overnight.  They come out so tender.  I remove tails from the crockpot and place all the juice (and fat) in a container and put in the 'fridge.  Then I skim off the fat and make gravy with the essence.  Oh so good!

Very good and filling!  Used suggestion (ala Julia Childs) to brown tails first for 40 min at 400 with onion, celery, and carrots deglazing pan with red wine.  Cooked in slow cooker for 5 1/2 hours with ingredients (minus season salt).  Added sauteed onions and carrots (don't saute in bacon grease next time--flavour too overpowering).  Served over rice.  Will try with potatoes next time. If planning on doubling gravy, double oxtails for more meat.

This was fabulous!!  Great flavor and extremely tender.  Only one suggestion - skim off fat before making gravy - as meal is a bit fatty.

This recipe is perfect. These came out just like my grandma from Louisiana used to make and my 7-year old LOVED them, too. He's really picky but he ate all of them up and I only got 3! I will be using this recipe again and again. THANK YOU.

OMG what an unexpected treat!!! These were sooo good and rich! I used a greek seasoning recipe that CindyLepp gave me on the exchange and it was PERFECT for this recipe!!!! My DH wouldn't eat it because of what it was. They are a bit fatty but totally worth digging around the fat for the awesome meat that is hiding. I did cook mine for about 4 hours to get them tender but I'm sure that depends on the size. Thx a million for sharing this recipe! BTW, me and Granpa loved this one! He said its been 40 years since he had ox tails and never tasted any that compared to these. I took that as a compliment!!!

Love this recipe!!! I looked all over for a simple recipe of this dish, and I kept finding it with beans and carrots and tomatoes, etc., which is not the oxtails with gravy that I grew up on. This recipe was exactly what I wanted! It is so easy, and it came out wonderfully! I serve it with buttery white rice and fresh collard greens. My husband loves it so much that he's taken to making sure we always have oxtails in the freezer!

This recipe was great.  I'm just beginning to "really" cook, and this dish was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  My family used to make this all the time.

I have never eaten or prepared oxtail, but my husband is South African and was craving them.  I found this recipe, and prepared it exactly as written, except I only used a teaspoon of salt since several reviewers mentioned that it was too salty.  Even though I cut back on the salt, it was still WAY too salty!  I had to add additional beef broth and flour to dilute the salty taste.  Other than that, it was perfect!  I would definitely make this again, but I would only add either the seasoning salt or the table salt...not both.  I'm also wondering if the Greek seasoning put additional salt into the dish?

My hubby and friends, liked it.  I doubled the spices.  I boiled oxtails for 3 hours.  Reserved 4 cups of broth for the gravy.

I'm not sure how this got rated so high but I thought it was very bland. There are others on the site that are better. I won't use this one again. It wasn't bad, just not great. I'm keeping the best in each category.

First time making oxtails and this recipe was really great, good flavor, and lovely gravy. But, we think in the future we will buy oxtails and use them more like you would a hamhock in beans and soups etc. 
Not a lot of meat on oxtails to justify the price, or cooking time for this recipe IMO

If you love oxtails already, try this recipe.

Delicious! Just like my mom used to make it when I was a child.  I used Worchester sauce instead a brown sauce and I didn't have Greek seasoning, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'll let the broth cool and scrape the fat off the top so that my gravy isn't so greasy. But it was still delicious. I plated it on a bed a garlic mashed potatoes. I can't wait until I'm hungry again.

I hate to admit I do not know what Greek seasoning is, I followed the directions otherwise. I did add a whole hot pepper to it to give it a bit of pep. Very flavorful

I also changed the recipe a little, but the overall recipe gave good guidelines to follow.. And maybe we eat too much, but I scaled the servings to 18, and only fed 6 of us..  So I actually cooked about 7lbs.. that's 1lb of oxtail per person.. that is.. uncooked weight that is. ENJOY!

Let me say first that we really liked this recipe... it's good comfort food. But, I'm giving it only three stars for two reasons: 1) it didn't step up and knock my socks off...DH didn't rave and say "make this again soon!" but he said it was good.  And 2) there is NO WAY this serves 6 people!  There is not much meat on oxtails, it is mostly bone.  I started with 2.21# and with the mashed potatoes and the gravy (which was good) it just served the two of us.  I will admit that DH is a big eater, but I am NOT so we even out.  If the amount listed was for two people, I would raise it to four stars, but for novice cooks who don't know, it's very misleading, hence one less star.

I followed the recipe and while it tasted quite good and the gravy was very good, I will not be making this again (and it was a unanimous decision). This was way to greasy. As I'm typing this, it feels like my arteries are clogging. I am ok with some greasy meals. But even boiling for 3 hours, there is still too much fat. And the broth you use for the gravy has the fat you just boiled off (and I skimmed off 1/2 cup of grease before making the gravy. How this meat is so expensive, is beyond me. If I was starving and had nothing else to eat, would be the only way I'd make this again. This is similar to pot roast, which is what I'll make next time. So if you know what oxtail tastes like and are ok with the grease, you'll like this. If you've been thinking of buying oxtail and trying it for the first time, just get a pot roast.

This was an easy to make recipe and I enjoyed doing this. I had tried other oxtail recipe and I think this one is the best. the only problem I had with this one is that it is a bit salty. Nothing I can not fix by toning down the amount of salt. That is the reason why i rated it a 4 star. This one is a keeper. It has potential. Also The meat was so soft and it does not require a slow cooker which is a plus. Good job on this recipe.

This recipe was awesome I made it for a friend and he fell in LOVE with it! The only reason i am giving this recipe 4 stars is because I was kind of salty, but the italian seasong made it taste AWESOME...The only thing I added was Lousiana hot sauce while the oxtails cooked...and I cooked for 3 hrs...much tender...THANKS!

This receipe is fantastic. I didn't refrigerate overnight so of course i had more fat/grease but next time I will. The gravy is delicious. I also used Lawry's Garlic & Seasoning Salt along with some cajun seasoning from Tony Chachere.

This was a very tasty recipe that my husband and I enjoyed very much. I don't like using the grease or shortening in the gravy though, and I don't think it needs it.  Next time I will just use the broth with the flour only to make a gravy, like in the smoothered porkchops recipe on this site.

I skipped Greek seasonings, used a little curry powder instead. I also used Worcestershire  sauce instead of brown sauce. I let the oxtails marinate overnight in the dry spices. I browned them and sautéed the onions, garlic and bell pepper before the boiling process. Finally, once the oxtails were in the gravy, I added a little sugar to the sauce to help cut the tartness of the Worcestershire  sauce.

I have never had Oxtail before, we buy our meat from a local farmer so it is easy to get.
 I followed the recipe as it said and this was so delicious, I served it with brown rice and doubled the gravy. It is very easy to make and I will make it again and again. This recipe is a keeper, thank you so much for sharing.

Very very good.  I agree this does not feed 6.  You need at least 2 tails to feed six.  The Gravy is awesome.  Wonderful for a grits and gravy combo.   Yeah I know grits are for breakfast, but I'm just saying.  :-)

Well I boiled my oxtails last nite for about 3.5 hours.  Let em cool wrapped em up and put them in the fridge along with the broth so that I can get most of the fat out when I get home from work today.  I'll finish up the recipe as written with a few extra touches for dinner for the family today.  I had some collard greens in the freezer from a previous meal.  Got those thawing too.  Plan to make rice and cornbread to make a hearty southern meal.  BTW...of course I tasted the oxtails....shhhhhhh....don't tell the rest of the family.  They were GREAT!

YES, I will make this again & as one other review said, I seriously increased all the spices: first dredging the ox in flour,  s/p & simmered in fat until nice  & browned on all sides, then proceeded as directed, using a pressure cooker for  1-hour>  Delicious, tender, succulent, served over egg noodles

Very good recipie. Nice change to my normal way of cooking oxtail. It is very rich but very good just the same. Per another reviewers recommendation used beef broth instead of water. Will make again.

A bit greasy, but otherwise delicious!!!1 You may want to strain grease off of them twice rather than once like the recipe suggests.  There will still be plenty of oil left to add flour for gravy.

I've made this recipe several times and I just LOVE it!!!  I used to only make oxtails in 15 bean soup, and I wanted to find a different way to prepare them. I think this recipe is perfect. The oxtails come out nice and tender and very well seasoned. This rocks on flavor! The extra gravy (if you have any) is great on rice or biscuits the next morning. Great recipe! I keep coming back to this one time and again...

Excellent and very easy!  I love this recipe.  I saved three years ago and finally got around to preparing it.  My family loved it.  The gravy recipe is terrific and I think it would be great on lamb chops too.

I must say this recipe was perfect. I made it for dinner for my friend & I. And it was perfect. I did had to add a little more seasoning to give it some more flavors. Other that direction was perfect. I did mine in a crockpot. Did the gravy in a skillet then poured it in the crockpot..

I have made it 3 times.  I am no longer a regular at soul food restaurants because I can make oxtails myself now, and my children say it's better that the restaurants!
Modifications:  
I add half the salt and bring the oxtails to a boil, and skim off the scum.
I add a bottle of beef bone broth while it is cooking.
During the last 30 minutes of braising, I quarter and add a green, red, and yellow bell peppers with the seeds removed for flavoring.  (Tip given to me by a New Orleans Chef)
I add more minced garlic because we LOVE garlic.

I would use beef broth as the gravy to make it richer, and maybe some cornstarch to make it thicker, but really authentic soul food!

Many sincere "Thank You's" for this great recipe...My mother didnt make them but all my Grandparents did and coming from a strong line of family cooks to add this to my kitchen meals is an honor...I greatly appreciate it...I never tasted oxtails until as an adult now...Unfortunately my timing was off for a long long time my Mother didnt make them yet my Grandparents did BUT when I came to visit it was a day or 2 after they made them...now that my parents and grandparents have passed on...Im caring for 2 elderly loved ones & they remember so when I said Ifound a recipe & will try my best... they both said "we'll be praying for you"...the judges are very happy...Today will be my 3rd time making..Again Thank You so much from one cook to another or Chef...Thanks

I’ve made this recipe twice. The second time I substituted Campbells sauce for the gravy and I was not impressed. I will stick with the very easy original recipe from now on!

I couldn't find my pressure cooker, but this recipe was on the mark.  I added some meat tenderizer to help.  Oh boy!!!!  This was simple as well as tasty.  Took half a day to cook though.  Make sure you have time!

Great base for adjustments.. doubled the seasoning. used worscheshire sauce and really watch the salt. Also watch the liquid as it cooks because it can dry out. if adding more water adjust seasoning accordingly

Very good recipe!!!Some family members enjoyed who never eaten oxtails before.  I should have trimmed off more fat but still it was excellent.   Made it exactly as instructed.except for the bacon drippings, used canola oil.

Me personally , the meat seasoned up enough in the broth no seasoning was needed after! I think it helped using a 100 year old cast iron pot and my granny's 50 year old cast iron skillet! ;-) Love this recipe!

I loved it!  I didn't have any browning sauce or bacon dripping  but in its place I use beef broth in a can. No onions because my boyfriend hates them (his loss) and instead of Greek seasoning I used my own combo of seasonings. When it was done boiling I used all of the juice from the oxtail to make gravy. I wanted it thicker. So I mixed more flour in with the beef broth & worcestershire sauce and a little bit more seasoning till it was thick enough for me. I made this with white rice and red kidney beans. Very filling!

Great recipe.  Next time I will try to make it without the bacon drippings/shortening.  I think the gravy is just that basic gravy/roux so you can prob find a lower fat alternative.  I also used small frozen oxtails from the farmers market along with big fresh ones from Publix and the big ones taste way better.   Very tender.

First time making oxtails. I usually find me a soulfood or Jamaican restaurant but I wanted to try it myself. I followed the recipe as it is and it was amazing! If you're heavy handed like me be easy on the salt!

WOW. This was my first time making (or eating!) oxtails, and I am now a fan! Time consuming, but easy and soooo delicious. I could have licked the plates clean. Definitely make sure you serve with some rice - you do not want a drop of that gravy going to waste! I even saved and froze the rest of the stock so that I can use it in other recipes. This one is a winner!!

This was easy and absolutely delicious! I will agree with other reviews be sure and skim off the white film after boiling a few minutes, 2lbs doesn't feed six people and if you use beef broth more than water. The final gravey comes out superb. Enjoi

I wanted a different way to make oxtails than cooking them in a crock pot or braising and making a soup. This the perfect soulful way of cooking oxtails for a Sunday dinner with vegetables and other side dishes. I followed recipe exactly except I used no salt and had to use Italian seasons, will have Greek seasonings on hand next time. It was delicious and a keeper. Thank You.

It was my first time ever making or eating oxtails, I knew that my boyfriend really loved them so I wanted to make them. I have made this recipe 3 times now, and he says it's the best. I love how rich, tender, and flavorful they turn out. Once I tried to use canned beef broth to boil them in, instead of water, and it turned out too salty, so just follow this recipe as is, it works out great. I found a tip that I used, and it was after washing the oxtails give them a bath in cold water with a little vinegar. Not sure what this was supposed to do, but I really enjoyed them.

let me say this recipe is delicious. The grease is a lot but I remove the oxtails from the broth and put broth in refrigerator. grease hardens into a thick layer on top and then just lift off. I then use the broth to cook rice in and add oxtails back into rice. People who don't know what these are, all can't get enough and are shocked to find out it is oxtails and that they love them. OH, also I do NOT make the gravy of this recipe as I use the broth strictly for the rice flavoring.

Just made the gravy, and that too vegetarianized it, still gave me a good starting point.
