I needed a recipe that could cook on it's own while I was at class.  I tweaked this a bit and WOW!  It's very easy and super delicious.

I used boneless pork loin.  Browned in skillet.  Layered the ingredients as instructed in a casserole dish.  Deglazed skillet with beef broth and poured over potatoes and onions.  Placed in a 300° oven for 2 hours covered with foil.  The meat was fork tender and the sauce was to die for.  Thanks for sharing.

OK, I saw this recipe this morning, thought about it all day and came home and made it.  And it managed to live up to all that expectation!  A couple of little tweaks and  a twist: I coated the chops in cornstarch (as I'm gluten-free), browned them, moved them aside and then sauted the onions.  Then I left the onions on the BOTTOM, put the chops back on, then the potatoes, which I sliced with a mandoline, so they were nice and thin. The whole thing was simply delicious, a perfect late fall hearty dish.  Going right into heavy rotation.  Thanks for it!

VERY, very good!! The smell coming from my kitchen was so wonderful that I could hardly wait to eat and I was not disappointed. I am always looking for new ways to make pork chops and am so glad I came across this recipe. I did a couple of things differently but overall followed the recipe as is. I used new red potatoes because that's what I had on hand. Next I sauteed the onions and mixed them with the potatoes for layering. I added paprika, garlic powder and salt/pepper to the flour and lastly I only used 2 boullion cubes as several others said it was too salty with three. It was perfect with only 2 so I will continue to fix it this way. Thank you for a delicious, easy, one-skillet meal!

This was fairly easy to make and quite tasty. I'm giving a 4 star just because I had to modify it.  I only put 1 onion because 2 just seemed overpowering.  I fried the pork chops, removed, added a bit of butter, then browned the onions slightly.  I did the rest of the recipe as stated, but I did not put any salt and I replaced the beef granules by 1/2 salt beef concentrate.  It was not salty at all and even my children liked it.  My 7 year old who hates potatoes, liked the potates this way.  Oh, and by the way, I used red potatoes, sliced with the peel on to get some extra vitamins!  Thanks for the recipe, we'll be doing this one again!

This recipe was FABULOUS.  Real stick to your ribs comfort food.  I did a few things different, I only used one onion (it was pretty big) and sauteed it in a little butter first for flavor.  I also opted to bake it in the oven, my pan didn't have a lid so I covered it with foil, baked for about 1/2 hour then baked uncovered for another 10-15 minutes.  Definitely something I will make again, it was simple and easy.  I will probably add some spices next time to play around.

My husband and I loved this. The potatoes were so creamy, and the pork chops were awesome. I added tarragon, thyme, oregano and garlic powder. It was a little salty, so next time I wont add any additonal salt. And make sure that you're using a very large skillet with a good fitting lid. My skillet was too small, so the grease that spattered onto the stove started a minor fire the next day when I used that burner;) This is definitely a keeper though!

I cooked this in an electric skillet, making 6 chops.  I had to make about 6 times the potatoes(yukons are tiny) to fill the pan. On 1 side I made as instructed. The other side I flipped the ingredients, putting the onions & potatoes on the bottom. Here's the deal. The flour leaves a mushy coating on thbe chops no matter what you do. Kind of a turn off. Whatever is on the bottom of the pan gets ALL of the flavor. The potatoes on the bottom were especially awesome but on top, just blah. I actually threw out the chops that were on top. They were....not good. I would not make it again but I would maybe just cook potatoes this way. They were really a hit(those that were on the bottom).

I served this about 6 months ago and continue to prepare it every two weeks or so.  I usually add some "Garlic Plus" for a extra flavor.

Oh.  My.  God.  This is fantastic.  I made this for date night, and one of the nicest things is, after the 40 minutes of cooking I turned off the stove and it sat for 30 minutes no problem.  Chops were tender, made a nice gravy, potatoes were perfectly seasoned and creamy.  I was in a hurry and forgot the lemon juice in the bouillon, and it apparently didn't take anything away from it.  Huge hit, easy to make, and you don't have to rush to serve it when it's done.  I had no issues with saltiness and I used the full amount called for.  The type of bouillon I use is called "better than bouillon" paste, has no MSG, and is generally just as salty as regular cubes.  I used the cheapest bone-in pork chops available, and unpeeled red skinned potatoes.

Pretty good. I skipped the flour part and sprinkled some onion/garlic powder when I added the potatoes. In fact, these were done quicker than stated in the recipe but who can complain about that? Thanks!

This was a really good and easy dish.  It did turn out a little salty though (I left out the onions because they don't agree with my husband and that might make a difference.)  The broth turns into its own gravy.  I'll definitely make again provided that I can find a away to make it less salty.

I had every intention of following this recipe exactly but kept thinking of things to add....I'm glad I did. I browned my chops in oil then set them aside. Sautéed my onions in the same pan. I layered onions, chops, Parmesan, potatoes and more Parmesan. I heated 1 1/4 cup beef broth (instead of the bouillon) in the same pan and added a 16 oz carton cream of mushroom soup, heated and blended these together then poured over everything else. Sprinkled a bit more Parmesan , covered with foil and baked in a 350 degree oven 1 hour. Uncovered and baked another 15 minutes. Oh and I left the lemon juice out and used salt, pepper and garlic powder in the flour. Absolutely delicious!  The mushroom soup added creaminess and another layer of flavor.

Most moist and tender chops I've had in a while. I halved the chops, potatoes, and onion, but kept all the other ingredients the same (I did cut the salt and only use 2 bullion cubes, which was perfect saltiness). This is my go to recipe for chops from now on, you will not regret using it.

According to my husband, this is a strong 4 star recipe, I say it's a weak 4.  I did make some minor changes though.  I browned the chops on the stove as stated, but put garlic powder, white pepper, seasoning salt and garlic salt in the flour mixture in a ziploc bag and shook the chops up in that then browned in the oil.  I used three very large boneless sirloin chops from Costco but doubled the sauce amounts except for the onion.  Instead of simmering on the stove, I put everything in a casserole dish layering except again I switched it up. first I put the onion in, then the chops with the cheese, then the potatoes sliced very thin with my mandolin, more cheese and then the boullion mixture.  Covered with foil and baked at 350 for about an hour.  The over all flavor I thought, was a tad bland, but the chops were super tender and the potatoes were done, that's always a plus! Next time I'm thinking more spice for more flavor and some sliced carrots would be great but with a bit of tweaking, this will be a 5 star I hope. Served with basic frozen peas which went well with it.

This dish was absolutely fantastic -- like making pork roast (a family favorite) in a skillet.  The chops turned out so tender and flavorful, and the onions cooked down into a yummy, caramelized sauce.  Like many reviewers, I precooked the potatoes slightly (whole in the microwave for 2 minutes) and sauteed the onions in the fat remaining after browning the chops.  I left the  onions on the bottom, replaced the meat, then layered the potatoes on top.  I also left out the  extra salt -- the boullion was salty enough.  For our family of four hearty eaters, I used six potatoes and four chops and every speck of it was gone!

Excellent!  I can't wait to make this again.  It was a bit salty, so next time I will use beef broth instead of boullion.  ADD: I've made this several times again using beef broth instead of boullion and it is the way to go.  You just need to add a little bit of salt to give it some flavor.

Very tasty. As another reviewer suggested, brown the pork shops first then remove from pan. Saute the sliced onion and about 3 minced garlic cloves for 5 minutes. When softened add the sliced potatoes. I also added 2 sliced carrots to add a little color plus 4 small sliced frying pepper (the long light green ones) for additional flavor. Topped with the pork chops and let simmer till everything was tender. Any remaining flour was added last to thicken the gravy.

Delicious! Changed it slightly by carmelizing the onions and my husband said that was the best part! Easy to make, you just have to have the time to let it cook.

I used block parmesan cheese.  At the end of 1 hour it was very watery so I whisked 1 tablespoon flour into 1/3 cup sour cream and pushed potatoes etc to the side and whisked into simmering liquid -perfect sauce, I also skipped the browning ( I used 1" chops) but did add onion and garlic powder the beef bouillion I used was "seasoned" so it added flavor - from the description I could be a little bland

I made this dish once and fell in love with it.  I've passed the recipe onto many friends, all who loved it just as much as me.  It's easy and delicious, one of my new favorites.

I followed the recipe straight. …except when I added an extra half cup of water (gave more gravy in the end) I'm typically a really bad cook but this turned out pretty awesome! Def only use 2 bullion cubes, though. It wasn't overly salty but, could've done with just a bit less. This has officially made it to the dinner rotation!

I have been making something similar to this for years, using canned soup, but have been looking for a version that doesn't use the soup - this is very close.  I must have had very juicy onions, because the sauce was very thin.  I also was able to taste the lemon juice, so next time will only use half of what is called for.  Like others, I finished this in the oven (we are remodeling and I knew I would not have access to the cooktop later in the day - so browned the pork chops and assembled everything in a large covered casserole dish, and refrigerated until time to pop it in the oven).  If I can figure out a way to thicken the sauce a bit, I would rate this a 5.

I have made this recipe many times.  The first time as written, then with some changes.  I mix Montreal Steak Seasoning with the flour to coat the pork chops; brown the pork chops, remove from pan and saute the onions and minced garlic.  Add the pork chops on top of the onions, add the Parmesan, add the potatoes on top of the pork chops, add more Parmesan and pour lemon juice mixture (sometimes I use chicken bouillon) over all.  When potatoes are soft, I remove potatoes and pork chops and add a slurry of corn starch and water to thicken the sauce.  When it has thickened, I add back the pork chops and potatoes.  I do not add any salt to this dish.  There is plenty with the bouillon and the cheese.

I did tweek this recipe a bit to make it similar to an oven baked pork chop recipe I sometimes use. I added 2 tsp. rubbed sage to the flour, along with salt & pepper to taste. I did NOT add salt to the cheese, it's salty enough! I also used only 2 builion cubes - one beef and one chicken. After browning the chops I sprinkled them with a little lemon zest, then the cheese. I used 4 potatoes and one large onion, layering as stated. It turned out great, very flavorful and easy.

Maybe I did something wrong?? 3/4 cup of water didn't seem to be enough to even cover the bottom of the pan so I did add a little more.... my end result was pork chops covered in a mushy coating. And the potatoes weren't tasty either, according to my whole family. Sorry, it didn't work for me. :(

I make this all the time & have passed the recipe on many times.  The only things I do differently are:  season the flour with garlic or onion powder; fry the chops until they are a golden brown & put the onions on the bottom of the skillet, under the chops, they get really carmelized.  This is my favorite way to have pork chops!  If I could give 10 stars, I would!

This recipe is perfect for everyday cooking. I browned the onions in butter for a few minutes and only used 2 bouillon.  Use enough oil to barely cover the pan when frying each side. Amazing how simple this recipe is, yet so much flavor!  It was better than a 4 but not quite a 5, IMO. Keep tight lid on pan and lowest setting for heat.  35-40 miunutes is perfect cook time.  Will definitely make this again!

Simply said, absolutely delicious. The pork chops were sooo moist and all the flavors blended so well together. I added
some mushrooms for some additional flavor. My husband said don't change a thing. Thanks for Sharing

This was so good! At first I was worried about the lemon juice but in the end it gave the pork an awsome little kick! I will be making this a lot!

A hit with my family! I actually used 6 thin pork chops with this recipe. I seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper before I floured them and added a little more water to the beef bouillon mixture so that it wouldn't get too salty. Wasn't sure about the lemon, so I left it out. Turned out awesome. Really easy that even my cullinary challenged husband can make it! I'd definitely make it again.

I made this last night & my husband is still raving aboud it!  I sauted my onions first in a tbsp of butter then removed from pan.  Added onion powder, garlic powder and fresh ground pepper to the flour.  Others have said this turned out oo salty.  I used reduced sodium beef cubes and the salt called for and it was perfect! The Yukon Gold potatoes are perfect for this dish! We will make this often!

I have to say this is by far the best way to cook pork chops! I do not change a thing when I make this recipe, it is perfect just as it is. The flavor is wonderful and I make this dish at least once a week now.

This recipe is a keeper.  My family enjoyed the taste and the tenderness of the pork chops.  During the last 10 minutes of cooking, I placed the potatoes on the bottom of the skillet to brown.

I wanted an easy recipe for pork chops and this was it. I wasn't sure how the taste would be since there are hardly any seasoning in the recipe but made as directed anyway. I did use only one onion though since it looked like a ton once it was sliced. It was very good and the pork was so tender! My husband and son loved it, and between the three of us, this meal was all eaten with no leftovers at all!

Meh. We weren't impressed. We were hungry though so we ate it. It really needed some flavor. It was simple to fix. Mine took quite a bit longer though to cook the vegetables through. As always I enjoyed fixing a new recipe and trying out a new dish.

We just got done eating this meal.  I was concerned about the parmesan cheese, and was a little worried that the amount of bouillon was too much for the amt of water, so I used 2 instead.  Also, I didn't have any onions, so I used some onion powder.  I gave it 4 stars based on the recipe as written, I think having onions would have been much better, and I really should have added all the bouillon.  The chops turned out tender with a very tasty, crispy bottom.  The potatoes were evenly cooked and the sauce wasn't overpowering.  Once you have everything put together in the pan, put the lid on, don't stir or turn it.  Will definitely make this again... this time following the recipe exactly as written... once I get some onions.  ;)

My boyfriend and I really liked this dish.  It is very easy to make once everything is in the skillet...basically, you leave it alone for 40 minutes, so that is super easy.  I might use a little less oil next time because it kind of makes the potatoes a little greasy.

This dish was very good. Its a quick and easy recipe to make for dinner.  Yet I have to agree with other reviewers that the pork was bit too salty, even if you omit the salt from the Parmesan cheese mixture.  I used chicken bouillon because I didn't have beef but I don't know if that makes a difference.  In the future, I plan to replace it with low-sodium bouillon.  Other than that, thumbs up on this one!

The is delicious. My husband raved about this. The only thing I changed was instead of using bouillon I use beef or chicken stock depending on which I have. To me that gives it a richer taste. I did not use the Parmesan cheese since I didn't want any cheese in this dish. It is good with or without it.

This was fabulous.  I followed the instructions exactly the first time I made it. The second time my skillet was busy, so I popped it in the oven (covered). Big mistake.  No carmalization.  It just stewed.  So don't do that.

I add the pepper (no salt) to the flour mixture, then just use the parm on the layers. My very picky husband hates cheese (!) so I go light on the parm on his chop and he really enjoys this dish. I do add about 1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary to the flour as well for a nice subtle dash o' fancy.

Loved this recipe! I made a few variations which I think made the meal. I used small golden potatoes (they are creamier and have a slight sweetness to them,) a couple handfuls. I sauteed onions along with a few shallots which made it so flavorful! I also used chicken stock instead of beef bullion to reduce the sodium content. It was delicious!

Apologies but this was average at best.  The pork was not tender and the flavor was bland.  It did smell good, but will not be making again.

Good recipe! Easy, simple, yummy! I would follow what others have said and use less salt.. or even leave it out next time. Also, I did cook my potatoes for a bit in a separate skillet while the chops were browning.. however.. I think next time I won't do that.. They turned out a little too tender... but they were still quite tasty!

This was a very good and easy recipe to make. I did layer everything in a casserole dish, deglaze the pan using the beef broth and draining excess grease off. Poured over top and baked 325. for an hour. Was very good. I will make again. Thanks for sharing.

This is a good, easy, tasty staple. We thought the potatoes were especially delicious (I for one, couldn't get enough!). I did cut down on the onions and used just one onion instead of two, which was still more than enough. Will make again!

Absolutely five stars! I like to fix new recipes so I seldom fix the same one more than once.... this is one that I will fix often 'cause it's REALLY good!! You don't need a knife to cut the meat, it just pulls apart with your fork and it's really moist... and the potatoes and onions are great!

Fantastic! The chops melt in your mouth, perfect winter time meal! And I love that you can walk away from it once it is assembled.

I thought that this was great.  Very delicious.  My husband and I enjoyed it very much on a cold winter night, and so easy.  I also modified it a little by adding some garlic powder to the flour and added carrots into the skillet!

I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand.  Dredged the pork chops in the flour mixture with parm cheese, garlic salt and pepper, then browned as directed.  Removed them and added onions and sprinkled with the leftover flour/cheese mixture.  Added pork chops back to the skillet and poured in the beef broth w/ lemon juice (reduced to 1 cube after reading other reviewers comments).  Very tasty -and the extra flour made a nice saucy gravy.  I can't wait to try it with potatoes next time.

Very very good, simple recipe.  I tweaked it only a tiny bit -- I chopped one of the onions, and used it to deglaze the pan after browning and removing the pork chops, tossed in a minced clove of garlic, then a few spoonfuls of the boullion mixture to completely deglaze the pan before adding the pork chops and the other ingredients.  I also used only two boullion packets (I used a liquid packet version).

This is a pretty easy recipe and it tastes so good!  Love that it's a one-skillet recipe, too.  I also sauteed the onions for a minute, then put the chops on top of them.  Very Good!

I made this last night using the recipe listed, except we had 6 slices of pork loin instead of the chops.  YUMMY!  It was so good and we had the leftovers for lunch today and I thought they were even better than last night.  Definitely going to keep this on the list to make again.

I didn't tweak a single thing and this was one of the best pork chop dishes I have ever cooked.  Served it with sauteed musrooms and cornbread and we're still raving about it!

This is a tasty and simple recipe. Two buillon cubes and 1 onion is plenty, but I did double the amount of parmesan cheese. The flavors mesh very well and the pork is so tender!

Wow- this is outstanding!  If I could give it 10 stars I would because I was licking the plate!  The only change I made was putting the onions (and some mushrooms that I needed to use up) on the bottom.  So good!

I would leave the potatoes cut a little thicker, as well as the onions. The thicker the ingredients, the longer cook time, yes, but also the better texture. I usually make ours in a large pot which works just fine.

Excellent meal.  My Husband loved it.  I sauteed the onions with the pork chops so they were nice and tender.  Also added paprika and some other seasoning.  Came out awesome.

Super good. I did a few things differently. I used red-skin new potatoes, put the onions on the bottom, used beef broth instead of the bouillon, and thickened the sauce afterward to make a gravy.

There are some wonderful recipes on this website, but I think this is the best one I've come across. Not because it's somehow extremely tasty (which it is, but that's not the point I'm trying to make). It's because of the basis it gives to expand on. I'm not a chef or particularly great at cooking, but the variations I've made on this recipe have been vast, and every time it's turned out supremely delicious. From using other meats, to other spices etc. etc. If anything, it needs a tad more cheese. I'm had it so much over the last few weeks that I'm completely sick of it, but my family is begging me to cook it! :)

Really good recipe.  I made it somewhat easier in that I didn't mix everything in separate bowls I just added it all to the skillet.  Also I used already made beef broth instead of boullion.  This also helped control the salt a little better.  The only minor change I made was to add a little garlic, although it certainly didn't need it and I cut back on the onion a little.  Since my skillet is oven safe I threw it in the oven instead of cooking everything on the stove.  Tip: Make sure your potatoes are evenly sliced otherwise some will be over cooked and others won't be cooked enough.  A mandolin is a great idea.

Great recipe!!!  We left out the cheese, and used low sodium bouillon cubes.  I have been telling everyone about this recipe since making it three days ago.  Will make again.

Awesome, I have made this several times and I believe it is my husbands favorite way to eat pork chops.  I have also added a bit of white wine instead of water and it adds a great flavor.

Very good and so simple.  I used 4 regular russet potatoes in place of the yukon golds and it was delish!  My husband loved it and even mentioned to me again today how good it was last night.

These are quite good! Tender and flavorful!  I modified as others have and baked this at 350 for an hour.  I put the layered chops and potatoes in a 13x9 glass dish and covered it with foil.  After an hour, I took off the foil and cooked for 10 more minutes.  Will be making again!

This tasted pretty good. It was salty, even though I used reduced salt boullion. I would leave out the added salt next time. I would also skip flouring the chops before browning. They didn't look very appetizing. I'll just whisk in a bit of flour towards the end of cooking. I will definately make this again, perhaps experiment with seasonings. I'll also try it in the oven, as suggested by Linda323.

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I seasoned the flour with garlic salt and pepper but I really didn't need to.  It was just a tad too salty but I served it with chunky applesauce , my husband's request, and that balanced out the saltiness perfectly. Oh, I also used regular russet potatoes because that's what I had on hand. Used my mandolin to slice them and the onions. Will definitely be making this again.

Easy & delicious. I used 2 cubes instead of 3 as suggested by others. I love to make smothered pork chops and this recipe is a much healthier alternative without compromising the flavor. I will definitely make again. Thanks chefjenwin.

I'm a complete noob in the kitchen; my usual territory is the barbecue, pizza delivery or the drive thru. This recipe was simple and easy to follow and it made some of the best pork chops I've ever eaten. A couple of tweaks in spices with the flour and other than that I prepared it as shown. Excellent!

I can't even explain how much I love this recipe. It's SO easy, and I have always had trouble cooking pork chops - they come out perfectly this way. I almost always have these ingredients in the kitchen since I buy big packs of pork and bags of onions and potatoes. It tastes fantastic, and even the resulting gravy is amazing - my boyfriend liked it so much that he saved it to put on rice the next day. 

The first time I made it almost exactly as written - the only change was that many people said it was too salty, so I just used some leftover broth instead of bouillon and water (hard to take away salt, easy to add more if needed!) Wonderful! I've changed things since, but not because it needed it - just substituted whatever was on hand.
Recommendations:
- Use broth or stock, or reduce the number of bouillon cubes. If you think it's not salty enough when it's done, just sprinkle on some garlic salt. 
- I agree that the ratio of onions to potatoes and pork is a little much, but this wasn't a problem for me as I love onions. If you're not a huge fan, use two small or one large.
- Super flexible recipe: try adding mushrooms at the beginning or maybe peas in the last few minutes. I suspect that you could probably even put the rice in the same pan, adding the proper amount of liquid, but I haven't tried it.

Very easy and very tasty.  We both loved it, but found it too salty.  We only used two bullion cubes, and next time will probably shoot for just one and no other salt.

This was pretty good. Easy to put together. Not super quick but very hands off, so it works for me for a weeknight. 40 minutes was a little too long for anyway, the potatoes were completely falling apart. I did what another reviewer did and removed the pork from the pan after browning and quickly cooked the onions, then putting the pork back on top of the onions. Not sure if it made that much of a difference. The pork itself could have used more flavour, and the parmesan cheese felt a bit out of place (not unpleasant but a little strange to me in this combination), but overall not bad at all.

everyone seemed to like it per the reviews so i tried it... I i made this as directed except for the cheese, all i had was a 3 blended cheese i use for stuffed shells... I believe the cheese i used overpowered the flavor.. i will try this again, BUT stick to just the parm. the pork chop however was wonderful.... it was just the onion mixture that wasn't so hot for me. however my son loved it.

This recipe was amazing! I made a few adjustments but it was delicious! I used a blend of flour and season salt,pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, Parmesan cheese and lemon pepper. Then I used red potatoes with the skin on and low sodium chicken broth instead of beef bullion. I has some very thick pork sirloin chops so I left it in the skillet for about an hour. The sauce was wonderful and the potatoes were creamy but not mushy and the pork was tender enough to cut with a fork. I will definitely be making this recipe again. It is a great meal for a cold day.

Very tasty one dish meal!  I did find that it was slightly on the salty side so next time, I'll try to cut down on the beef bullion cubes.  thanks for sharing!

Great one dish recipe. Made as written, but for the last 15 minutes of cooking time I shifted potatoes to the bottom. I guess I didnt cut them thin enough, but that helped. Overall very easy, potatoes were phenomenal, the pork was enjoyable. If I make it again, I will adapt for slow cooker.

Delicious flavor! Only thing is I somehow dried out the chops a little bit, maybe next time I will add them about 10 min after onion and potato start simmering. Because there WILL be a next time...its that good! Thanks!

The potatos did not cook up. I had to remove them and place them in the oven for a good hour more. We had finished eating the pork chops and dessert before the potatos were done. We took a couple bites and they were not worth it. However, the chops and onions were divine. I made it again a week later without the potatos and again was an extraordinary dish. We will continue to eat these chops and onions!

I just finished making this, but I do not recommend it. It came out very bland (even with my own tweaks of adding some sauteed garlic and a little onion) and just made me long for something better. It's passable when you're hungry I suppose, but other than that, it's kind of a waste of time. 

It ends up feeling like just a messy and all too bland mixture. Very disappointed.

The pork was super moist...but there was a lot of flavor lost because keeping the lid on for the duration of the cooking time resulted in this being watery in the end.  I added lemon pepper, basil, and onion powder to the flour.  Deglazed the pan with the juice of two lemons, and threw in a handful of diced celery and julienned carrots because I needed to use them up.  I will definitely try this again, with the change of allowing it to cook covered for the first 15 minutes, then venting the lid so the sauce will reduce and the potatoes/onions will have the opportunity to carmelize.  My house does indeed smell AMAZING even two hours later!

it was easy and different then what i usually do. I forgot to do the flour, and i didn't know how thick the juices were suppose to be. so after it was all cooked. i made a slurry to thicken the juice some.  My bf and I didn't really care for the taste of parm in the recipe. So i think next time i'll leave it out. i'm thinking about adding cheddar cheese instead after the meal is cooked.

Quite good and easy to make. I used 2 tsp of chicken broth and omitted all other salt. And added some seasonings to the flour. The pork came out nice and tender. The only thing my husband wished for was more sauce.

My family loved this. They say they particularly liked the potatoes. I think this is because it's flavorful but doesn't have all the cheese and canned creamed soup like other equally tasty pork chop recipes.

Quick to prepare, moist and delicious!  i was worried the potatoes might be kind of "steamed", but on the contrary, they were quite buttery in texture.  I guess from the fat in the chops, and the bit of fat in the bullion. Either way, we'll make this again :)

DELICIOUS!!!! Made this earlier tonight and my hubby came in and said it smelled really good, it did! The only thing I added was 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic.  We loved it and our 1year old son ate some too. Thanks so much for the recipe. Will definitely be making this again.

I prepared this recipe as it's written and I enjoyed it.  The pork chops were tender and the potatoes and onions cooked perfectly.  I will prepare this again.  However, next time I will season the meat and veggies separately before combining all the ingredients to cook in the skillet with the broth.

Extremely yummy. I took the advice of the most helpful reviewer and browned the chops in the skillet and moved everything else into a 9x13 pan covered with foil and baked.  I also caramelized the onions in the skillet after I browned the pork chops.  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

Awesome!  So easy and a definite keeper.  I accidentally left out the lemon juice, but obviously it didn't hurt it!

Great recipe.  I seasoned my chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and tony chacheres for a couple of hours just to give extra flavor.  The chops came out very juicy and tender.  This will be a staple for chops.

I made this for my boyfriend and 2 brothers. The pork chop was nice and not dry, but not much flavoring to them. I may try and make it again and see how it comes out again.

What an excellent one skillet meal. I too sauteed the onions in butter, removed them and then followed the recipe exactly, except no salt. After 25 minutes it was done.  I removed the meat, potatoes and onion from the pan and used a little cornstarch to thicken the juices in the pan to use as gravy over the meal.  My husband had his doubts looking at it, but ended up having seconds.

I was afraid this recipe would be too bland, but was pleasantly surprised by its flavor.  The parm cheese gives it a nice zip. We are not normally big fans of pan cooked pork chops (because they dry out so easily), but these were very moist and tender.  It's a "keeper"!

I have made this recipe several times already.  This is without a doubt my husbands and my favorite recipe.  My husband is general manager of a restaurant and says that if there was a way that these could be made faster he would love to put them on the menu. Thanks for the recipe, these are totally AWESOME CHOPS!!!

One of my family's favorites. Don't use any other kind of potatoes, the Yukon Golds give this dish a very rich flavor. A good dish for a cold day, all you need is a salad and you have a complete meal.

This was a great recipe.I had cooked 4 fried pork chops the day before and I didn't wnat the same pork chops again, so I used this recipe,but I ran out of beef bullions so I used 2 tablespoon of Lipton's Beefy onion soup and dip mix. I followed the rest of the recipe. Wow it was great. My husband cleaned his plate.

A definite keeper.  This was a robust, hearty, and filling dish that my family, all guys except me, really enjoyed.  I especially liked how tender the pork turned out.  I used all the specified ingredients, but made minor changes in the cooking method.  I seasoned the flour with salt and pepper before coating the chops and did not need to add either to the broth.  To speed things along and assure everything cooked evenly, I placed the sliced potatoes in just enough water to cover them and microwaved them until they were tender-crisp.  I also removed the pork chops after they were browned and sauteed the onions in the remaining oil until they were tender-crisp.  I layered the onions on the bottom, then the chops, covered with parmesan cheese, then the potatoes.  I reserved the water I used to microwave the potatoes and mixed in the boullion (granules instead of cubes) and lemon juice.  Using the reserved water preserved the potato starch and helped thicken the gravy.  Once I brought everything to a boil, I turned down the heat to the lowest setting (to avoid burning the onions on bottom), covered the pan, and let it simmer till the potatoes fully cooked.  Served over white rice with a side dish of brussel sprouts.  My guys all gave it 5 stars!

i skipped the potatoes in this recipe.  i carmelized the onions first, then browned the pork chops.  i used garlic olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  then, i used low sodium boullion cubes (3) and increased the hot water to 1 1/2 cups.  i used the parmasan as described, then braised, covered, for about 45 minutes.  dh called this the "best pork chops ever".  be sure to use thin, well marbled chops.  they were soooooo tender!!  served with baked potatoes and greens.

I enjoyed this recipe but will start cooking the potatoes in the microwave before adding them to the dish. They took longer than the pork chops and the chops started to dry out.

I had taken pork chops out for dinner, so was glad to see this 'Daily Dish' using ingredients I had on hand. The recipe was tasty - like others, I used 2 beef bouillon cubes. I did add the lemon juice and used freshly grated Parmesan cheese. I found it only took 25 minutes to cook. A definite make again recipe.

I made this for my honey-be's tough co-workers and they loved it. For these guys the display and look of the dish alone made it seem fancy and difficult. I am now the most popular wife there. A little parsley on top made it perfect.

Very good, lots of flavour. There's nothing really special about it, however. I should have added more broth during cooking, as the meat wasn't as tender as I would have liked.

The was a great recipe!  My hubby, 4 year old and I ate it all up.  What a nice change of flavor for pork chops.  I did substitute the parm with romano though.  I am sure it didn't make that much of a difference but that's what we had in the house.  YUM!

I came to AR yesterday looking for something different to do w/potatoes to go w/my usual pork chop recipe.  Found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  Of course I tweaked it to fit my tastes, etc. but thought it was wonderful.  Was afraid leftovers would be soggy but it was still good today.   This is definitely a new go-to recipe in my kitchen.

This is a keeper, my pork chops stayed moist and soft, I didn't have yukon gold potatoes so I used red potatoes.  It was easy and very tasty.  I am always looking for ways to make pork chops that aren't dry.

Really like the one skillet method of this dish and it is very good with some minor changes! 3 cubes bouillon/3/4 C water will be overwhelming in salt and trust me, I love my salt! Ratio is usually 1 cube + 1 cup water. I subbed beef bouillon/water with 1 cup veg. broth and would use beef broth if on hand (I'm GF and don't buy bouillon). So, maybe go 2 cubes/2 C water. Used GF All Purpose flour and would reduce to 1 T. Add some seasoning to the flour (garlic/onion powder) to give chops more flavor if desired. Next time, don't think I'll use flour and will lightly season chops. Sear chops both sides & remove from skillet. Added 1/4-1/2 cup broth to scrape up bits for flavor and removed to small bowl. Continued to follow recipe and sauteed 1 large red onion (sliced) in 1 T. Earth Balance butter (dairy free), placed chops on top of onions as others did. My yukon golds were little larger than avg. and increasing amount p/other reviews was unnecessary. Flavors great, but there is noticable cakey/flour coating. Top layer of potatoes took longer to cook. After extra 10 minutes cook time, removed chops to avoid overcooking and covered w/foil; potatoes took additional 15-20 min. to cook. 3 star rating due to overly salt flavor of bouillon/water combo, but will make again and adjust layering: Onions, cheese, potatoes, cheese, chops. Overall, great and will be a go to recipe in our household! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

After assembling all the ingredients as written, Using an oven proof skillet I baked it in the oven as another reviewer suggested. 350 degree oven, covered for 30 minutes and another 20 minutes uncovered. Fantastic, flavorful tender porks chops and potatoes. A real hit out of the park.

My husband LOVES this dish and I love how easy it is to make. He requests this all the time and sometimes I change it up by making it with chicken instead. He does prefer the pork. I double the water and parmesan because he likes more sauce with it. I also season the meat with garlic powder, onion powder and pepper.

I made this for dinner tonight and it is delicious!  The only change I made was that I added about 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.  The flavor of the potatoes and chops - so good!  My hubby liked it too!  I will definitely make it again - very easy to make!

OMG!!!  Loved it!  I used 7 thin pork chops  and cooked for 30 min instead of 40.  I used Gold white potato.  You can use anything!   So easy. I used 1 cup boiling water with 4 beef cubes because I had more pork chops.

This was a winner. Added spices to the flour and used beef broth. Sautéed the onions and set chops on top as others recommended. Sliced the potatoes pretty thin but still took an extra 20 minutes to cook. Will definitely make again.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. The pork chops were super tender and the juices had a wonderful flavor. I added a little seasoning  to the flower and more onions and added mushrooms. Only because my family are huge mushrooms and onion lovers.

Made thus exactly as directed (added s&p to flour) except after browning chops I deglazed pan with a splash of cooking sherry and a splash of white wine, removed pan from heat, layered as directed then covered and baked at 350 for 1 hour instead of cooking on the stovetop. I might not use 2 onions next time, but we did eat all of them so maybe I'll use 2 haha :-) Think I may skip flouring the chops next time since it doesn't seem to thicken the sauce much, seems like a step you could skip without much flavor/texture change. The flour won't stick to the chops even after browning with all the steam and moisture so it probably isn't necessary. A very delish recipe anyway. Will certainly make again, Yum!

The pork chops were great. Very tender. But the onions on top were tasteless. I don't think the broth covered them at all. I would make this again with these changes: Salt the potatoes more than the 1/2 tsp mixed with the cheese. Remove the pork chops after browning and saute the onions in the oil and drippings before layering. I may put the potatoes on the bottom to give them a little color as well.

Made this for dinner last night - absolutely delicious!!  I made it in my electric skillet with the onions on the bottom, then the potatoes and then the chops.  I used canned, sliced potatoes and didn't add the lemon juice.  Simmered it for an hour on 300 degrees and not only did it smell heavenly, it tasted out of this world.  Even my "gourmet cook" brother loved it!  Definitely a keeper and will make it again and again.

This recipe was great!  I altered it a little…...made it without the cheese as I'm allergic to dairy and disregarded the bouillon to limit the sodium for my husband…….and it was good for the whole family.  Added a side of sautéed asparagus.  yum!

This was so easy and my husband absolutely loved it. I gave it 4 stars because of certain modifications: I omitted the lemon juice and parmesan cheese (my hubby's not a huge fan and I wasn't sure how powerful a flavor it would be), added carrots and leeks (because I had them on hand), and per everyone's suggestion, used only two bouillon cubes instead of one. 
As for the pork, I seasoned with pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a small amount of cayenne and thyme beforehand. I also left out the flour part, because I often feel that floured meats become very mushy when they cook in sauces. Because of this, my sauce was a bit thin at the end so I mixed up some flour with a few tablespoons of water and mixed it in to thicken it up to more of a gravy. 
I also left out the potatoes in the skillet, opting to make and serve the finished product over mashed potatoes. Though I'm sure it would have been delicious, it seemed a lot of people were having trouble with cooking them all the way through (though I'm sure if you sliced them thin enough they'd be fine). This recipe is definitely a keeper, and it just oozes with possibilities. I'm tempted to try a version with dried cherries or prunes and maybe some sliced almonds. Yum!

I made this in the Crock pot for my hubby today.  It's probably my fault but he thought it was bland.  However, I did not put any bouillon cubes, salt or lemon juice in it.  He did like the potatoes and onions, but overall the dish was very bland.  I'm not sure what I could have added for additional flavor.  I definitely will not be making this dish again as is.

I made this for my husband the other day and we both LOVED it! The only changes we made were only using 2 pork chops, since there are only two of us, and substituting 6 small Russet potatoes for the Yukon Golds because that's what we had. We did everything else according to the recipe and this turned out fantastic! The only thing that would make it better is if you added carrots or some other vegetable to it so you don't just have meat and potatoes for dinner.

I followed the advice of others and removed the pork chops after browning, added the onions, and then after the onion softened, I placed the chops back on top of the onions, and then continued with the directions  However, I did not add any salt to the mixture.  The 3 beef bouillon cube add PLENTY of salt by themselves.  We loved the potatoes, and not only was the meat tender and juicy, but we used older chops out of the freezer, and the flavors of the onions and bouillon covered the little bit of freezer-burn wonderfully.  This is a great base recipe and we'll play around with additional ingredients to personalize it to our tastes.  Thanks for posting this!

The whole time I was making this I just didn't have much faith that it would turn out to be anything great.  I'm so glad I was wrong.  This is surprisingly good and so simple.  After the first bite my father-in-law announced that this was definitely a keeper.  I did have one issue - I made six pork chops but my pan wasn't big enough for the six chops and all of the potatoes and onions.  So I cooked the pork chops with everything layered on top, and then about 3/4 of the way through I switched everything and put the pork chops on top and the potatoes and onions on the bottom so they would cook better.  Yummy.

Really delicious meal. The gravy was great, I caught my husband sipping a puddle off his dinner plate which is not typical (I hope!). I subbed sweet potatoes for the Yukons which I do often and it worked well in this recipe. Due to our schedule that night I only browned the chops and made a thin gravy in the skillet (1c water). Then I layered the sliced potatoes and onions in the slow cooker with the gravy mixed in and chops on top, cooking on low for 6 hours. Though that was a lot of cook time for the lean loin chops I used they were nice and tender. I seasoned all with Lawrys seasoned salt and omitted the cheese due to the slow cooking. This will be a definite repeat chefjenwin, thanks so much for sharing!

This was DELICIOUS! I made a few modifications. My husband doesn't like onions, so I added green peppers and red peppers instead. I also added a couple chopped carrots in with the potatoes. I used 2 beef bouillon cubes instead of 3, and I omitted the lemon juice. It was amazing. My sons ate all of it, they even liked the vegetables, which is unheard of! My husband can't wait for me to make it again!

Excellent recipe! My family loved this dish and there were no leftovers.  The only thing I did different was to saute the onions first before browning the chops.

Our family really enjoyed this.  I did add a bit of tarragon, paprika and garlic powder (to suit our family's taste).  Quick and easy to make, plus clean plates all around.  Thank you for posting it!

Had to make a quick dinner before going to work and decided to try this one. I had to make a few changes but it all came out good! I sauteed the onions  and used canned sliced potatoes because I had so many cans and no fresh potatoes on hand. It turned out GREAT!
Thank you for such a quick and delicious dinner

This turned out very very good. I really liked that I could come home from work and have this on the table with such little effort. I have a seasoning mix of garlic, onion, & pepper which I used in place of the salt. Also I only had regular potatoes but I hope to make this again with the Yukon Golds. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this dish exactly as written by the author. It turned out too salty and oniony, but I could tell it would be really delicious if it hadn't been too salty and oniony. So next time, I am going to omit the salt from the parmesan cheese mixture. I am going to reduce the cubes of beef bouillion to only 1.5. And reduce the onions to just 1 small onion. Also it seemed like too many potatoes too, so I will reduce to 3 medium-sized potatoes. I am willing to make this again with these modifications.

This was fantastic! I traded regular onions for green onions, and used chicken bullion, since it was all I had on hand. I also only used 2 low-sodium bullion and salted to taste. Finally I added some thyme, basil, and parsley. Absolutely delish!

I was a little bit skeptical about this recipe while it was cooking because there seemed to be too much liquid. Taking the lid off at the end reduced it down very quickly though and the result was quite delicious. I give it 4 stars mainly because it isn't the most appealing looking recipe, but the taste is good and I will definitely make again.

DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! I had to make a couple of changes because of ingredients I had in the house. I had to use chicken bouillon cubes and only used 2 based on other recommendations. I didn't have yukon gold potatoes. I used whatever I had in the house...I don't even know what they were. :) Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was great!  Picky husband loved it.  I only wish there was a way to brown the potatoes.  Looked a bit lifeless, but the flavor made up for it.  I also only used two bouillon cubes and it was just right.

This recipe simple and fun to make. The results were tasty too. The pork chops were so tender and juicy. My only complaint was that I think the beef bouillon cube was very overpowering and I only used two instead of the three that the recipe calls for. Next time I will only use one. I took the pork chop out of the skillet after a few minutes on each side and sauteed the onions and some garlic. I then layered the chops on top of the onions and then the potatoes. I will make this again with said adjustments.

My husband and I loved it! My daughter did not, she said she thought the chops were soggy. So I am not sure this recipe would be all kid friendly. I did reduce the boullion to 2 like others said. Also I seasoned the flour with basil, oregano, garlic and onion powder. I also did as others said and cooked the onions instead of putting then in raw. Other than that I followed the recipe.

I just tried this recipe this evening. I have to say it was awesome. I absolutely loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe said...I didn't change a thing. The pork chops were so tender and juicy you could cut them with a fork and the potatoes and onions just melted in your mouth. I will definitely be making this again!!

Delicious.  I was surprized by how good this was. It was really, really good!  I used only two bullion cubes as I was concerned about saltiness.  It was perfect.  Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe.

I love this, but I make several modifications: I did not add potatoes (but serve it with mashed potatoes or brown rice).  I add fresh mushrooms.  I skip the water and beef boullion, add enough white wine to cover, and simmer until the mushrooms and onions are tender.  I love the flavor that the lemon juice and wine add.  One of my favorites!

First I want to say the Potatoes were excellent! However, the pork chop not so much. They turned out a little dry and not much flavor. I did bring leftovers for lunch the next day so it wasnt too bad but I will defiantly not simmer it for so long next time. I too browned my onions a little and it gave the potatoes a great flavor. I think next time I will add a few baby carrots as well.

This was great! The only thing I did different was add some season salt to the flour and use chicken bouillon because I couldn't find beef at Albertsons. This was nice and simple. Thanks a bunch.

This is oh so good!  Great comfort food at its best.  I made only a few simple adjustments.  1. Deglazed the pan with beef broth after browning the chops. 2. Omitted the regular salt and used 1 tsp. garlic salt instead. 3. I chopped the onions and placed a few under the chops.  The chops really did come out fork tender and the potatoes and onions worked well.  I recommend this even to the most expierenced cook, you just can't beat the simple things.

This recipe is awesome! Thank you so much. I did however alter it a little. I omitted the flour. And after I browned the pork chops, I added 2 Tbls of butter and added the onions which helped get the bits off the bottom of the skillet, and added a tbls of minced garlic. I then layered everything in a 9x14 roasting pan, and instead of beef bouillon, I had chicken on hand, and I didnt have lemon juice...this recipe turned out great. I put the pan in the oven at 375 for 30 mins....everyone loved it!

Forgot the lemon juice, but the dish was great anyway!  Put in carrots and some celery to round off the nutrition while it cooked and it came out wonderful! Try it!

I liked this a lot as is the first time! I made it a second time and changed/added a few things...  I used red potatoes, sliced thin... I added sliced green peppers and onions. I added garlic powder, italian seasoning and pepper to to the flour, and garlic powder to the parm cheese. After browning the chops, I took them out of the pan and added all my veggies, plus salt and pepper... let that saute a few minutes with a little splash of balsamic vinegar. Yum! Then I added the chops back to the pan along with 3/4 c beef broth and 1/2 c of white wine. Then added the cheese, covered and simmered for 30 minutes... took the lid off and let it simmer another 10 minutes and served over rice... It was very tasty!!!

Hmm. The sauce was a little too strong and salty. Kind of boring. Might make again with some changes. More vegetables like carrots, mushrooms, etc. and less bullion. More spices. Might thicken the sauce to more of a gravy consistency.

I followed the directions as written. The only things that I will change next time are: 1)Make beef bouillon sauce first so it is ready to use and 2)Season pork chops prior to flouring so they have a little more flavor.

This was an easy and delicious recipe! We used only one bouillon cube and fresh lemon juice. We let the dogs lick our plates and they sat at the stove howling for some more! Too bad we ate it all.

I thought this recipe was very good and very easy.  I only had one onion on hand, and that seemed like more than enough.  I sauteed the onion first, then browned the pork chops.  I used 2 tsp Better than Bouillon dissolved in one cup hot water.  I used lime juice rather than lemon since that was all that was on hand.  I peeled and sliced about five large red potatoes and I also grated about 1/2 cup of fresh parmesan.  After browning the pork chops, I removed them and deglazed the pan with the dissolved bouillon, then poured the bouillon back into the measuring cup and followed the directions.  Near the end of the cook time, I was worried about the potatoes being a little bland so I threw in some more pepper, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning.  I thought it was really delicious!!

Really good and very simple.  Did saute onions in 1 Tbsp butter beforehand.  Put in order as recipe states.  My family doesn't mind when everything is together so to make this even easier, I'd put either frozen peas or green beans on the top during the last 15-20 minutes of cooking.

Was a wonderful simple recipe. My only problem was that it was REALLY salty. Like other reviewers have said I would omit the salt the next time i make it and allow the broth to salt the dish.

Like other reviewers, I browned the pork and then sauted the onion.  I left the onion on the bottom of the pan and added the pork and potatoes.  I used beef broth instead of boullion cubes and increased the amount to 1 1/2 cups. I also left it on a low boil instead of a simmer since the potatoes were taking a long time to cook.  Will make again!

I thought I sliced my potatoes (I used red potatoes) thin enough but it took much longer than suggested in order to get them cooked through. Otherwise the taste was good.

I'm not big on pork chops because they never seem to turn out moist.  HOWEVER, this recipe is amazing, they were SO moist we could cut them with our forks.  Just amazing how simple but yet delicious it was.  Will be making this very often!!

Easy and delicious.  I have tried this several times with pork chops and they are tender and moist everytime.  Last night I tried this with boneless chicken breasts and it turned out delicious.  I added a little garlic powder and parsley to the parm. cheese mixture just to add a little more flavor.

This was an excellent recipe. The wonderful aroma of this dish cooking kept making my family return to the kitchen to ask me if it was almost time to eat. My whole family of 5 loved it. I didn't feel the need to make any modifications. The pork chops were really juicy and this had an overall good flavor. Not the least bit bland.

This was one of the best recipes that I have gotten from Allrecipes. I had never cooked with Yukon Gold potatoes before and they were excellant. I used "breakfast" pork chops and they came out very tender. The meal seemed like a crockpot dinner but was done on the stove and in record time! As my four year old daughter would say "Enjoy"!

This was delicious!  My husband and picky children loved it !  It was a tad salty adding the salt along with the 3 cubes bouillon.  I will probably cut the salt in half the next time I make it. The time was innacurate.  It took more like 75 mins until the potatoes were tender enough.  Nonetheless....great dish~!!!

Awesome!  I added about 1/4 cup of extra water to the beef cubes and steamed dumplings over the sauce during the last 15 min of cooking, and added a little more parm cheese...... absolutely delicious.  Thank You!

I didn't love this one.  I really wanted to.  I made it for my dad for Father's Day & followed the recipe exactly.  It was very dry & not very flavorful.  I listened to the comment of another reviewer who said her Parmesan-hating husband couldn't taste the cheese - big mistake.  My dad couldn't even force it down.  But my mom & I couldn't taste the cheese, so... maybe if your spouse is not a Parm fan you should skip this one.  I'll keep looking for another yummy pan-fried chops with onion type recipe.  This one missed the mark for our family.

This is wonderful!! My family loves it! I also cut down on the bouillon cube.. still I found it a bit salty and add more water to it.. I really simmered the chops until very tender but I lost a lot of the liquid even though I added more water. When it was cooked, I placed the chops on the platter and made gravy from what's left on the skillet (oil, drippings, remaining liquid).. I had fun preparing this dish! Thanks! This is a keeper!

We were really excited about trying this recipe but this recipe disappointed us more than all the rest.  Wonderful aroma while cooking however it was very dull and boring.  The pork tasted good but that was simply good meat.  The potatoes were not fully cooked though the pork had cooked well past 160 degrees.  The onions added flavor but the parmesan cheese was just not right!  The beef bullion was OK but I expect that chicken broth would have been much better.  I need to talk with Ina or Lidia and get their advice but with this recipe maybe Paula Dean - maybe deep frying would help.

AWESOME but WAY TOO SALTY! Still give it five stars. Per other reviewers, I added carrots, and sauteed the onions in a little balsamic before adding. I brined my pork beforehand and it was super tender. I did cut the bullion and only use 2 cubes instead of 3 but next time I would only use 1 or half of 1. Nevertheless, this was delicious, and my pork chop hating hubby had two servings! I highly recommend this recipe. Like someone else said, it does sort of taste like an old fashioned roast but in much less time. Delicious!

Very flavorful meal, despite a couple variations based on ingredients in my cupboard - used bread crumbs instead of flour; chicken bullion instead of beef; cut back on onion, and no lemon juice.
I used a deep, heavy skillet and this was quite easy to make.
This recipe's a keeper.

Great meal. I used regular potatoes and chicken boullion instead of beef, as that is all I had on hand. Precooked the potatoes in the microwave. Delicious.

Very, very tasty!  Followed the recipe with a small addition of some garlic powder.  The whole family loved this.  I used bone-in chops.  Contrary to some other suggestions, I didn't precook anything.  I did make sure to THINLY slice the potatoes, as per the recipe. I also THINLY sliced the onions.  Definitely in our rotation. Pretty sure you could omit the flouring of the chops if you so desire.

Great comfort food! Have made it several times and everyone - even the kids - enjoy this one. I used red potatoes and 1T of beef base instead of bullion. I accidentally ommitted the lemon juice and it was fine without it.

I made this for the first time today. We  blend out Parmesan 50/50 with Romano cheese. Also I added 1T. of minced garlic. Very moist and very good flavor. Will definately make this again. with a little more cheese.

I tried to prepare the recipe as written, however followed other reviewers suggestions and only used 2 cubes of bouillon. I sauted the onions for a few minutes after I browned the pork chops, and left them in the bottom of the pan. I used 1 tsp. of black pepper, and almost double the amount of cheese. I only had about 1/2 an onion, so I added a tsp of onion powder to the cheese mixture. The potatoes needed a little longer to cook than stated, but the pork chops came out VERY moist and tender! It is refreshing to see a pork chop recipe that doesn't include cream soups and tastes as delicious as this one. I will definitely make this again, and can't wait to try it with lots of onions!

My family loved this recipe (even the onion-hating 5 year old). The potatoes and onions taste like they have been roasting all day. This is the ultimate comfort food. I didn't have lime juice, so I made it without. It was still yummy!

An excellent dish.  The sauce was tasty the onions added flavor and interest and the pork chops were tender enough for the kiddies.  We just scraped the onions off theirs and then there were more onions for us!  This recipe will certainly be added to our "regulars."

I'm always looking for new ways to cook pork chops so they won't come out dry, and THIS IS THE ONE!!!! I literally licked my plate! I made the recipe exactly as listed, I did use "Better than Bouillon" instead of bouillon cubes and disolved them as indicated in the recipe, and I added some pepper to the flour before coating the chops. They came out VERY tender, not dry and we all loved it! This is my new staple pork chop recipe. Also, I did use boneless tenderloin chops that were about 1/2" thick. enjoy!

Very Good! I used Red Potatoes, left the skins on and sliced on my veggie slicer so they were very thin. Cut back on the salt a little, What a great flavor,I followed the direction almost exactly. The lemon juice  really enhances the potatoes. Bottom of potatoes were crusty and yummy!Pork Chops tender, nice change from the mushroom gravy recipes( which I like also) Thanks for this one, it is a keeper!

Wow!  I was excited to make this dish as soon as I read the recipe, and it did not disappoint - the flavor was fantastic!  I did as a previous reviewer suggested and caramelized the onions first, then browned the pork chops in the same pan.  It was so easy to make, and my family loved it! I served it with baby sweet peas in butter and the Sauteed Apples recipe (submitted by Jenny) from this site - also an excellent recipe!

I made this recipe today. And I turned out great. The only change I made was to use more cheese.... I prepapred it in the morning already, so the pork chops can sit and soak in all the great gravy flavour. We are going to have it with a bowl full of green salad for supper tonight. Thanks for a great recipe. Greetings fron Germany...:o)

Not hard to make, but not a super speedy dinner. My husband and daughter (I'm vegetarian) seemed to relly like it. Didin't use as much onion as the recipe called for (used about 1 medium onion), and only 2 bouillon cubes, but other than that, didn't change anything.

This recipe is wonderful!  Great flavor and easy.  Put on the stove to cook and go on with other chores.  It was a little salty, probably my own fault as I added salt on top of the boullin.  My family enjoyed and will make this one again!

The sauce is good, but missing something, maybe fennel or sage.  Make sure to slice the potatoes very thinly.  After an hour of cooking mine were still too firm.  Added extra cheese last 15 minutes of cooking .

Excellent!  I only changed a few things.  Increased pepper to 1/2 tsp, only used 1 1/2 onions and increased cooking time to 50 minutes.  This was so tasty and simple.  I wonder how this would taste using chicken and chicken broth instead of the chops?

Yum!  This is so delicious!  The only thing I added was garlic and onion powder to the flour.  Also I only had beef bouillon powder, so I used about three tablespoons of that, and I omitted the extra salt.  Will definitely make this again.

I didn't care for this recipe.  The porkchops tasted good, but I didn't care for how the potatoes and onions turned out.  If you like French Onion Soup, you will like this recipe.

We really enjoyed these chops. It wasn't until I started browning the chops that I realized I was out of Parmesan cheese, so I just left that out. I also didn't flour the chops just put pepper and garlic powder on while browning. I used red potatoes b/c that's what I had. The potatoes and onions were super moist, and the chops were tender and had a nice carmelization on the bottom. Will definately make again.

This was a hit!  A little on the salty side, but great flavour.  The only change I made was adding some thinly sliced carrots. The potatoes were the best part of the meal.

This was awesome!  You could cut the pork chops with a fork!  I was out of lemon juice so I used lime instead and had no parmesan so used Romano.  Definately eliminate the extra salt.  It's not needed.  The Gold potatoes are a must.  They have that buttery flavor that enhances this dish altogether.  This one's a keeper.

I will reduce the amount of bouillon next time and add a little extra parmesan (or mix it up with some romano cheese).  Very tasty one-skillet dish.

I thought this was a very easy and tasty recipe. It was slightly salty (which I like) so you might want to skip adding more salt. We also used 2 cubes of vegetable bouillon instead of 3 of beef. Our chops needed to be cooked for an hour. The potatoes came out perfect!

I think I had my temperature a little high -- the pork came out well above 165F and very dry.  I'll want to work with that.  Also,  I halved the spices, and used chicken bullion rather than beef.  Flavor was good.  Will likely make it again, sometime.

I bought the pork chops at Costco, with bone in.   Instead of bouillon cubes, I used a generous amount of chicken broth so I was able to salt to taste later.  I used a large vidalia onion that cooked into the built in gravy.  I loved this recipe and will make again.   Leftovers were on point too!

We LOVE this dish. It's so easy and delicious. Our only change is to use lime juice rather than lemon - and we're generous with the Parmesan.

Likely to become a regular meal. Easy to make, ingredients I always have on hand. I used sliced pork, not too thick, and it cooks really quickly. Reheated leftovers the following night and they were as tasty as the first time.

I used chicken broth instead of beef broth and added some Italian seasoning.  It was tender but I could have cooked it a little longer, because I like it when the meat falls apart.  It was delicious.

I used pork steak instead of chops and I omitted the lemon juice. I spread about 1/2 tsp of minced garlic on top of the pork before I added everything else. Also added 1/2 tsp soy sauce to the beef broth. Very satisfied with the results. Will definitely be making this again!

I have made a similar recipe except it was baked. I seasoned the chops with Lawry seasoning salt and fried in Tuscan Herb olive oil.  Used beef broth but chicken could be used, too.
Sprinkled some salt and pepper on top of the potatoes.
Great flavor and moist tender chops.  Will make again.

Oh, my gosh. This was just as easy as she said.  I think the brining made a world of difference.  I had never done that before and forgot about it overnight.  It turned out perfectly and was not salty at all.  Pork  pulled apart  with a fork.   I added a sliced yellow bell pepper and then a sliced red apple after.  Just wonderful.  (and a handful of brown sugar on very top)  I wish I had read all the reviews and probably would have added more potatoes, too.  

Thanks for a great discovery for me. :)

This is one of my favorite comfort food recipes.  My mom used to make it and it's soo tasty and satisfying.  The pork comes out so tender and flavorful and the potatoes and onions with the parmesan make it complete.  

I'm trying to adapt it to the instant pot... but I have to figure out how to make it using a glass insert pot-in-pot method because otherwise it gets too soupy and sort of burned to the bottom.  and it needs to come out, almost like a casserole.  If anyone has  suggestions I'm listening.

This recipe was amazing!! I loved the flavor and tenderness of the potatoes. I made a few changes. I sautéed the onions in the pan drippings left by the pork chops until tender. Then I placed the pork chops over them, the parm cheese mixture, then the potatoes, and the remaining parm cheese. Then I sprinkled potatoes with paprika abc parsley. Delicious!!

Excellent recipe, although it involved some time-consuming prep work.  We all enjoyed it, it was super-easy to cook, and it makes great leftovers.  The only thing I would change is the amount of the Parmesan cheese mixture... but that is strictly personal taste, I just don’t care for a strong taste of cheese (which isn’t in every bite, strangely).

Myself, my hubby, and our son loved this dish! I didn’t use lemon juice because didn’t have any. I grated the Parmesan myself and used probably 1 & 1/2 cups of cheese and 5 pork chops. I also used zatarans seafood breading to coat the chop, I was out of flour...and it was amazing! The flavor to the dish is outstanding. We will definitely keep this one for the future! Cooked exactly as instructed. MUAH ??

Definitely will have this again. Pork chops were so tender, did add more onion and garlic because I love both, also additional spices but the base recipe was excellent.

This turned out delicious!!! I usually find pork chops super bland but this was really good. I put only 2 beef cubes and it was perfect and I put minced garlic as well. I did what a few other posters suggested, I browned the pork chops then removed them and softened the onions with some garlic and then put the pork chops on top of the onions followed by the parmesan mixture and the potatoes on top. Simmered for 30 mins and it was perfect. Will definetely do again.

I was tired of the same old skillet chops. I found this recipe and had all of the ingredients on hand... that's a key factor for trying a new recipe for dinner that night. I did make adjustments though. I reduced the amount of onion and only 2 boullion cubes.  The flavors are fresh and comforting and the pork stays tender and juicy. It will be added to the frequent flyer list as my boys loved it. I've even shared it with my daughter's.

I made the recipe pretty much exactly as written.  The only change I made was I used red potatoes because that’s what I had on hand.  Overall my family liked it, it was easy to make and I will definitely be making it again.  Next time I may cut back a little on the Parmesan cheese a little bit, but I think this is mostly personal preference.

I followed the receipt except used slightly less parmesan cheese. It was tasty, different, I we loved the little Tang of lemon. It is definitely a "Do Over"!

I added a little bit extra parmesan (I used a mix of shredded Asiago, Romano and parmesan that comes nicely packaged from my local HEB) and I hate beef bouillon cubes (raised in the UK), so I substituted my beloved Bisto. Came out wonderful!

I will make this again.  I added 1/2+ tsp garlic pepper to parmesan (no salt). I put the onions on the bottom of the pan. Added extra potatoes. Simmered but my 1/2" pork chops were cooked in 25-30 min.

It is fantastic! I've made this for  many years. Before I brown the chops I sprinkle on both sides of the chops Italian seasoning, paprika, thyme & oregano.

This is for the lady who said hers was way too salty.  Try this, don't put ANY salt in it, for one thing Parmesan AND bouillion are very, very salty, most people know this. I would leave out the salt, and use a low salt canned beef broth for the liquid.

I was out of the bouillon cubes, so subbed in some soy sauce instead for the salt, and it worked a charm.  Also only had russetts, so ran with those instead of the yukon gold, and it worked out fine with the same cooking time.  Great recipe!

It was good.  I made it per the recipe and sliced my potatoes and onions about 1/4 inch thick.  The boneless pork chops I used were perfect.  The potatoes and onions need to cook a little longer.  I didnt have a large enough lid to cover the frying pan so I covered the pan with  tin foil

This was not bad.  Even though I browned the pork chops quite well, the flour coating turned out kind of wet and slimy.  That made me unhappy.  I'll probably make this again - skipping the flour coating - but not in the near future.

This recipe was exactly as written from an old cookbook of mine - except the meat was veal chops instead of pork chops. It works great with either, and pork chops are less expensive. I use beef broth instead of bouillon cubes, but sparingly because the potatoes release a lot of liquid.

I made this tonight for the first time and now it's a favorite. The chops were so tender that we didn't need a knife to cut them. I didn't have but 2 potatoes so I used the shredded Hash brown frozen potatoes I had in the freezer. I thawed them under hot water & added them to the skillet. They turned out great! Love this dish..

I made this tonight with some minor changes. I used 1 full teaspoon of beef bouillon paste instead of the cubes. I cut the vegetables in half; I was only cooking for 2.  Everything was the same. It turned out very flavorful and satisfying. Hubby says ‘keep that recipe, it’s a winner’. He is a very picky person when it comes to what he likes and doesn’t like. I would highly recommend this recipe. And it’s so very easy and quick to put together.

Accidentally left off onions so it was good but onions would be additive.   Very tasty.

I made it exactly as is and it was delicious!!!!   It was something we needed to make quickly and happened to have all the ingredients.  The gravy was delicious and the pork was so tender (something hard to do with pork chops). The only thing I would change is I would add more cheese and lemon juice.

This is a very good dish!  It was easy. I had most everything on hand and it was delicious.  I used my cast iron skillet which is my go-to for skillet recipes.  My husband does not like spicy food  and  he loved it!  He even had two helpings!  He doesn't like pepper so I used a spice mix of Oregano, Basil and Parsley which gave the dish very good flavor without the pepper.  Just before serving I placed it under the broiler for a few minutes to put a little color on the potatoes and cheese and it turned out great.  Will make this again!

This had really good flavor and the chops were fork tender.  My only complaint is that when turning the heat to simmer (I used med/low), the cook time was considerably longer than 40 minutes.  It was more like an hour on my stove.  Overall, a very good recipe,  though!  Thanks for sharing!

Husband LOVED it!  Was very good and wouldn't change a thing with ingredients.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used a mandolin slicer to make the potatoes thin and uniform.  35 minutes and dinner was served!

I made it as written for the first time, which I think is only fair. You can always tweak it later, if you want. The only thing I had to change was to use russet rather Yukon Golds, because that was what I had on hand. Everyone agrees .. a quick, easy, and very tasty meal! Try it, you'll like it.

This was delicious!! I was surprised because I thought it would just be "meh" going by the ingredients.  There are a couple things I will make sure of the next time I make it.  My recipe was a little salty and that could be  because my beef bouillon cubes are large.  I cut it down to 2 cubes (rectangles), but it was still a little salty  so next time I will only use one.  Also, I used a very lean cut of meat.  Next time I will find less lean chops so the final product will be nice and tender.  Excellent flavor!

We cut the recipe down to two servings.  We kept the liquid at the recipe level, and it worked very well. Pork chops fell apart ficely and the potatoes and onions were just fine.

Not sure where I went wrong, followed the recipe to a T yet the porkchops ended up with a  crunchy hard layer on the bottom, 
aside from the bottoms of the pork chops the potatos came out good (too much beef bouillon if you ask me)

this recipe should be revised and rewritten

This was yummy and very satisfying.  I did what others suggested and used chicken broth instead of water.  I put it under the broiler  before serving to brown it up a bit.

I am sure this is excellent as written, but I avoid dairy and gluten, so I read reviews and tweaked...  First I used arrowroot powder instead of flour.  I also eliminated the cheese, so I used ghee and cooked the onions before adding the pork chops before simmering for some additional flavor..  I also used beef broth instead of the water/boullion.  It was excellent. I don't think I have ever had such moist pork chops.  Excellent recipe!

Great flavor!  It was salty but not too salty as others have stated. The only adjustment I made was to sauté the onions before adding them. It turned out great, I will definitely make this again.

One of my ALL TIME FAVORITES!   I always double the recipe (especially the parm mixture) and add way more of the broth mixture than what is called for  (it adds more flavor throughout as it cooks).  It's a bit of work and time consumming but it's worth it and my family LOVES it.

My pork chops were a thiner than the 1/2 inch recommended and were a little too brown when done.  Other than that, it came out pretty good following the recipe except I used red potatoes instead of Yukon gold (that's what I had on hand).

We love this recipe with no changes: however,  one day I had some green beans fresh from the garden and decided to add them on top and they turned out great. It was nice having every thing in one pot.

Delicious! Subbed romano for parmesean because it is what I had on hand. My meat and potato loving hubby loved it even with the large cuts of onion in it! Will definitely be making again!

Great recipe. Used my large iron skillet to make sure it was all cooked evenly. Will make it again.

AMAZING!!!! I cooked in a skillet. I didn't have the parmesan so I topped the chops with swiss cheese instead & put the onions on the bottom. Then topped the potatoes again with swiss and sprinkled with Lipton's soup mix. Yums!!!!

This is a new favorite recipe in my household. I used the thinner-cut chops, which came out melt-in-your-mouth tender. I also used chicken bouillon, as I didn't have beef, and it still turned out delicious (I think the chicken flavor went better with the lemon juice). Also sprinkled a little parsley on top.

I am just smitten with this recipe. It proves that simple food can be so delicious. My daughter will not eat any potatoes except mashed. She inhales these potatoes and asks for seconds. I use one cube of beef and one cube of salt free vegetable bouillon and it's perfect (use GoBio brand cubes since it'sGF). I've tried it with boneless and bone-in chops and I think I prefer it with bone in because they're more flavorable and tender. I can't wait to try substituting one of the potatoes for carrot or rutabaga. This will be my go to weeknight dinner recipe because it is so easy. No stirring or worrying about if it's okay. Just put it on, cover and set the timer. The only thing I have to deal with are the hungry diners who ask every 5 minutes if it's ready because It smells so good!

This is one of our family favorites. I like to add mushrooms and frozen green beans. Also I add a little more water and bullion or beef broth and use the juices to make a gravy when its done.

This was really easy and SUPER delicious!!!  We ate this meal for the first time 2.5 hours ago, and we haven't stopped talking about it!   I never rate recipes online!  I HAD to rate this one!  I only made very minor tweaks:  I added some salt, pepper, cumin and cayenne to the flour the pork chops were coated with, and like another reviewer, I put the onions on the bottom of the stack.  I also cooked this in a dutch oven.  I won't make it ANY other way going forward, and this immediately made it into the (very) regular rotation!  This is my most-favorite pork chop recipe!  The pork was SO tender and flavorful.  I accidentally used chicken bouillion, rather than the beef it called for - and it was still SO amazing!  Can't wait to have it again!

Really, really good. Prep time was minimal, the chops are tender and the onions sweet and almost caramelized.  I will be making this again.

No changes to this easy meal other then using pork steaks instead of pork chops. The prep is time consuming but after that, all ingredients in the pan, put the lid on and you have a wonderful dinner in about an hour.

Really liked it. We tweaked it as we only used two pork chops. Cut back on onion, used russet potatoes as that's what we had. It was really tasty; we're going to try it on chicken breasts too!

This was excellent! I didn't have boullion cubes, so I used 3/4 tsp. beef base - plenty of flavor. I used russet potatoes, since that's what I had on hand. The chops were incredibly moist and the flavor perfect. They were a hit with all of my family.

This was fantastic!  The only thing I changed was I used 3/4 cup of beef broth instead of bouillon only because that is what I had on hand.  It was easy and tasty!  This will be added to the rotation!  Even DH loved it and he hates cheese.....shhhhh don't tell him!!!

I've made this twice now and its turned out great both times. It's very similar to how I make my salisbury style cubed steak. It's perfect for those chilly fall nights. I did make some tweaks to it. Instead of using a beef bullion cube, I used beef broth and instead of yukon potatoes I used a bag of baby dutch and sliced them up. I also stirred my pan around periodically to meld the flavors better and topped off the dish with another sprinkle of parmesan before serving.  I'm not really sure why some people were saying that this was flavorless or disgusting. If your pork chops came out mush, its because you didn't sear them at a high enough heat.

I just made this for the first time, and will definitely be doing it again!  It was so good.  I sliced my potatoes really thin using a mandolin slicer, and it turned out almost like an au gratin.  Very good.

Great recipe,  just a tad too salty.  The next time I make this dish I will not add salt and  add an additional one third of water. Other than that  it's a delicious meal.

I just want to comment on the choice of recipes that showed up when I came onto the website.  I have a husband that spent a couple days in the hospital with suspected heart problems and they kept him on Heart Healthy diet while he was there and we were told his heart was fine, but he needed to stay on the heart healthy and low sugar diet.  So I came to find recipes for his next weeks meals and they are right there and looking so good.  Thank you, All recipes for doing that for me!!!I am 83, Mathew is nearly 88 and we really need the help.  So appreciated.  I will be using my membership every day!!!

This was really good.  My family enjoyed this.  I cut back to 2 beef cubes based on other reviews, and this seemed like a good decision.  I also cut back on the salt which I'm glad I did otherwise this might have been too salty (& I love salt!) .  I didn't have any lemons on hand so I added 1 sprig of Rosemary instead (a personal favorite) from my garden.  This came together lovely and I will make again.  I served with Homesteader Cornbread & fresh green beans from my garden.  Thanks for submitting.

Delicious! The only change was that I browned the onions first.  So, I browned the pork chops, removed them from the pan, browned the onions, then added the pork chops back to the pot and continued with the recipe.  I've made it three or four times now, including for company.  Everyone loves it!

Excellent!  Used more flour (maybe 1/4 cup), added salt & pepper.  Put in ziplock bag, put in one pork chop at a time, shake to coat.

Added a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce to a gravy. 

Used beef stock instead of bullion

I followed the recipe exactly! It was delicious! It tastes alot like pork roast with all the yummy trimmings (even a delicious gravy for an added bonus)! I did not think it was too salty as others have stated, but maybe thats just me. The only reason it was four star was because I'm not a huge pork chops fan, but still yum. My family enjoyed it as well! Thank u for sharing!

Delicious!  I followed others' tips by browning the onions after the pork and putting the pork on top of the onions and adding more potatoes.  I also put on the second half of the parmesan mixture after putting half the potatoes in, and then put some shaved parmesan on top.  The flavor was amazing.

Really 10*s.  My husband looked at me and said, "do you like it" because he knows if I don't, I won't make it again.  I didn't like it, I LOVED it.  What a terrific recipe.  I did it exactly as printed.  I used bone-in 1/2" pork chops.  I had a butcher cut them so they were the stated thickness.    The potatoes were the big surprise, so creamy.  The small amount of parmesan (I used Romano) was perfect.  Since I made it in a cast iron skillet that has no cover, I put a cover from another large skillet and weighed it down with pizza stones.  WOW, is all I have to say.  Will make this for company because the result is impressive.  I love peas and told my husband I might add them, but he said not to change a thing.

Months later:  I have made this for company a couple of times, for my son, who loved it and for dinner tonight.  A great recipe.

It was so easy. My changes: had no bullion cubes so used 3/4 cup beef broth. I took someone else's hint and covered it with foil when finished layering it and baked 2 hours at 300°. Heavenly. Will make again...soon.

I loved this recipe.  I did not have bouillon cubes so I substituted one pack of Beef Flavor Boost which I mixed with the warm water.  I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt and white potatoes instead of Yukon Gold.  I will definitely be making this again

I made this recipe twice. Both times I used beef broth and followed the recipe as written but baked in 350 oven. The first time I used raw onion and the second time I browned the onions. Both were delicious but preferred the later. I will definitely make again.

Was looking for a hearty dish that required little attention. This was easy and delicious. The few tweaks I made were using olive oil instead of vegetable, using cheddar cheese instead of parmigian as I am not a fan. Even my picky eater of a husband loved this. I will definitely make this again.

This is delicious! I followed the recipe as written the first time I made it, and since then doubled the sauce amount (can you ever have a enough sauce? :) and tweaked the recipe based on some of the top reviews: added paprika, sautéed the onions, then returned the chops to the pan after a partial de-glaze using some of the beef broth instead of bullion.  

Using less salt than written helps too, and the last time I made this I added rosemary to it and wow! what a great complement to the flavor (even if I say so myself ;o) I don't recall using rosemary with pork very often but it was great with this dish.  (Which btw has already gone into rotation because it is wonderful).  Thank you!

This was truly delicious, but I did have to modify it some or it would have been waaayyy too salty. First, I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the beef bouillon cubes for two reasons. First, much less sodium and second, I simply prefer chicken broth to beef broth when cooking pork. And because there is already sodium in the broth, I left the half teaspoon called for out entirely and it was seasoned perfectly. The second change I made was to add some freshly grated garlic. This really gave a great flavor to the chops and the potatoes! Great recipe with just these two little changes!

My Mom made this...a good farm recipe. It is best with a pork steak, a marbled cheaper cut as it won't dry out.  I like to do the onions and taters par cooked as others have said. I am thinking of adding a layer of rinsed sauerkraut and grated apple for Octoberfest meal.  I will adjust my salty ingredients accordingly .

This was pretty tasty I thought, the family wasn't too enthused. I accidentally put some pumpkin spice in with the flour, meant to put poultry seasoning. It actually gave it a nice taste of fall.

This was really good!  Our picky teenage daughter liked it, too.  I followed other reviewers advice and backed off on the salt and bouillon.  I used 1/4 tsp salt and 2 bouillon.  I added a little garlic powder to the liquid.  We'll have this again!

Well instead of waiting till fall ....I fix the pork chops on one of the hottest days of the summer. Since it is cooler to cook on top of the stove...it was not bad..the only thing I changed was I used a can of french onion soup instead of beef cubes & 1/2 can water..I got a thumbs up from my husband. :)

I used less oil & made it in my bean pot (like a soup tourene) baked it at 350 for 2 hrs. while I was at work.  It was really delicious & as a Weight Watcher, only 9 pointsplus.

I added a little seasoned salt and pepper to the flour thinking the chops might need more seasoning.  Next time I will follow the recipe as written.  There is plenty of flavor with the original ingredients.  I will definitely make this again.  It was so quick and easy and delicious!

I made this dish this evening.  It was great.  Flavorful and the pork chops were very tender.  I aslo used a mandolin to slice the potatoes.  I added carrots also sliced with the mandolin.   Everything was done perfectly.  I will definitely make this again.  FYI to KFoutz - I use green onions in everything that calls for onion.  They are sweet and don't upset my stomach like regular onion.  Also you  mentioned the dish was salty - I did not use the boullion cubes. I used Kitchen Basics Beef stock.  We didn't find the dish salty.

Made exactly as recipe directs. Next time I will try boneless chops for convenient consuming. I made two recipes and used two different "every day" fry-type pans. The shorter, wider version had the best browning.

Very easy to prepare and very tasty also.  Even though it seemed like Scalloped Potatoes with out the cream sauce.  All I changed, not being a fan of bullion, is I used beef broth and I did throw in one cube.  I also seasoned the flour a bit with salt, pepper, and ancho.  My skillet was a bit small so I covered it with parchment and cooked it slow for 20 minuets pressing the lid down now and then.  Then in a 350 oven for 25 minuets.  You could cut the pork with a fork.  The onions reminded me of French Onion Soup with potatoes.  Not much better than that.  I would make again.  Nice Sunday dinner.

I have been making this recipe for over 25 years and now my boys make it for their families.  I don't think there has been anyone who doesn't like it (except those who don't like pork).  I do it as a slow cooker recipe  I brown the chops in the slow cooker on high and then layer everything.  I even put onions in the middle.  In my families opinion, there can never be too many onions!

It was absolutely delicious! The pork was so tender, other then the taste, I couldn't tell them apart! I was full, but still had to have a little more. Good thing I used the biggest skillet I have to make extra. Going to have some more for lunch tomorrow. Just "Off The Chain" FANTASTIC !!!

Only used 2 pork chops, 1 large onion and 3 large red potatoes with skins left on.  This was SO good!  Even hubby, who is not a big potato eater, thought this was extremely tasty.  Adding to my regular rotation for pork chops. Thanks for posting this really great recipe!

This is so delicious!  I added 6 cloves of chopped garlic, and sprinkled lemon pepper on the potatoes.  I will be making this again very soon!

I was looking for something different to do with pork so I made this last night for dinner. A big hit!! Even my picky picky son ate it!  I didn't have beef bouillon so I used beef broth instead.  I am thinking next time I will only use one onion because there were a lot of onions left.  Smell was awesome! This will definitely be made again!

I've made this recipe a few times and for some reason I always struggled with getting it right.  The meat would be too dry or the potatoes undercooked.  I found the secret ingredient!  Or rather tool: cast iron skillet!!!!  OMG this was absolutely fabulous when I used my cast iron skillet.  The meat was so tender, the potatoes were perfect!  Great recipe!!  I'm so happy I finally figured out how to do justice to this recipe.  I don't use onions since my husband abhors them but other than that, I follow the recipe to a T.  Now just in a cast iron skillet!

Yummy recipe. I will adjust next time. Slightly salty as I marinated the pork chop as well.  But it was tasty and kids loved it!

Delicious! I made this tonight and loved how easy it was. I didn't have Yukon Gold potatoes, so I substituted Idaho Russets, but it was still tasty.

These chops were so very tender.  Not sure why so many sad the dish was bland.  We thought it tasted great. I didn't have yukon so I used russet potatoes and I didn't have beef cubes so I use a cup of beef broth and two packets of veg. bouillon(since it called for 3 cubes).  It worked well. Must not be as salty as the cubes.  I did also salt and pepper the chops before I floured. Will make again, it takes a while but very easy and tasty.  The onion flavor was nice.

Excellent flavors and very easy. Followed others suggestions to brown the chops and glazed the onions. Served with pan fried asparagus from this site.

Easy and delicious, and the cooking smells create anticipation from everyone in the house!  Make sure to use your larger skillet.  After browning the meat as directed, I removed it from the skillet, added 1 tsp olive oil and sauteed 1 large onion until opaque, stirring occasionally. I removed the onion, replaced the meat in the skillet and layered the ingredients as directed (except for using 3 tsp beef bullion granules stirred into 1 cup of hot water).  Covered and cooked as directed. The broth thickened nicely and the potatoes were perfect.  I served this with Hawaiian sweet rolls, whole kernel corn and cottage cheese and had no left overs!  This is definitely a keeper!

This is great! I made it with chicken boulion b/c my husband doesn't eat beef. I also didnt use any additional salt. I eye-balled the parm & pepper, but this is great. My very picky 5 & 6 year old kids ate it. I would recommend.

Very good.  Made as written except subbed white wine for the lemon juice and used all purpose potatoes.  Very tender and yummy chops with a bit of gravy.  Hubby loves anything with gravy and was pleased with this dinner.  My only change for next time would be to saute the onions first in olive oil or butter to give them better flavor and season them with salt, pepper and maybe a bit of thyme.  The bouillion that I use is the powdered salt free kind so the salt wouldn't be overkill if added to the onion.

We LOVED this. The only change I made was to sauté the onions first in 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon evoo. Then when it was all layered, I topped it all with a little more parmasean cheese. First time that I have made pork chops and they were not dry!  Yummy!

I used three pork chops (they were large) and 1 large onion. I don't keep bouillon around so I used a packet of sazon goya. maybe that was the problem, but I found this pretty bland. I'd probably skip it in the future, or at least switch it up to a crockpot dish and move to a pork tenderloin.

I had one layer of 6 chops with potatoes on and around them and onions on top. Because I live at a high altitude I covered everything with beef broth from a can and cooked for an hour and a half adding snow peas on top after an hour and since I had to use up an ear of corn - I threw that on top as well. Wow!  I hadn't used my big electric fryer pan with lid in years but with the temps exceeding 100, I wouldn't dare turn on the oven.  Great recipe.  Saved the night. Easy and taste great. Everyone enjoyed it.

Followed recipe exactly. Not sure what I did wrong, but after cooking, the potatoes were mush. So, I mashed them all the way! Made an interesting mashed potato. Pork tasted good.

The pork chops were not as tender as I hoped so I will adjust the timing cooked. Also, I will add a little more potatoes. My children approved of this supper!

We first tried this in our electric skillet and the potatoes took a really long time to cook, maybe I just had to much in one pan because it took well over an hour but on the plus side the pork came out amazing, it was so tender and the taste was really good.  Since it tasted so good I decided to make it a little easier and quicker for a work night so I prepared it ahead of time so I could pop it in the oven when I got home from work.  Big mistake, to me it made a huge difference!  The meat was not as tender and it just didn't taste as well.  I will always cook this in the skillet as written! Oh and my only complaint were the potatoes they were very bland and just needed seasoned a little more.

Thought this was just average. I thought the potatoes were too mushy and the whole dish was a little too salty though I only added two bouillon cubes and no salt.

Delicious!  I was really skeptical about this, but I was surprised at how good it was!  I used two really large red potatoes, and only half a large onion, but followed the recipe exactly from there. The chops were very tender and the potatoes were almost of a scalloped quality. My husband likened the chops to a Swiss steak.  I think I just found myself a new way to cook chops!

Just okay.  I really like the lemon beef bouillon sauce that was my favorite part of this recipe.  The chops were fine, but just not as flavorful as  I would have liked. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and sauted the chop first, then sauteed the potatoes and onions, layered the chops with the potato and onion mixture and then baked it all in the oven for an hour.

I made this for my family this weekend and my 5 yr old said "What did you do to these porkchops mom, they are delicious!"  Easy to make and tasty!  I microwaved the sliced potatoes for a few minutes to speed it up.

My husband and very picky 3 year old loved these pork chops. Followed the recipe almost exactly. Used 2 bouillon cubes instead of 3 and only 1/2 of a large onion.

Wonderful dish. Flavor was so delicious. Pork was so tender too. I was afraid the 3 buillions would make it very salty so I put less salt in the cheese mixture. Was not salty at all. My husband just loved these pork chops. It is a keeper.

YUM!  I have made this recipe 4 times and my whole family loves it!  I have noticed this recipe comes out better when I hand slice the potatoes, using the food processor only cut the slices too thin, and while it was still tasty, my husband said he liked his potatoes thicker.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would!  I found this tonight because I had pork chops thawed and I wasn't too excited about cooking them.  My husband actually made this dish after I found the recipe and man oh man was this awesome!  He followed the directions exactly except he used frozen diced red potatoes and it was just fabulous!

I read the reviews before preparing mine for dinner and I added the salt and pepper to the flour with some garlic powder.  I sauteed the chops in galic oil and removed them from the pan and sauteed the onions and some mushrooms and removed them from pan and placed the potatoes covering bottom of pan topped with chops, onion and mushrooms and cheese, then added the sauce ingredients.  We were very satisfied with the results.  I will double the sauce next time , it made a great gravy. Thanks JAWINFREE for a keeper.

This was a great dish. My entire family loved it. Definitely a keeper. The only two things I did differently is that I used Idaho potatoes since I did not have Yukon gold and I added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the parmesan mixture. Very yummy!

Chops and potatoes turned out great. Onions were still a bit sharp, but not enough to dampen the overall quality of the dish.

This was good.  Instead of the water and buillons, I used chicken broth.  If I make this again, I will use more than 3/4 cup.  I decided to skip the salt, as I thought the parmesan would be plenty enough taste.  I was right.  No salt necessary.  I think it could use a bit more taste, though, in the form of herbs and/or spices.

I made this recipe for the first time and it was absolutely amazing!  The only thing I did different was I baked the whole potatoes in the oven for about 25 min or so on 375 degrees first (due to some saying potatoes were still a little raw) then I followed everything else exactly. Will make again for sure!

We eat pork and chicken often but i get tired of eating them the same old way. I found this recipe interesting because it was only one skillet. I'm usually leary about trying new recipes because when I do my husband never likes it. I made this last night and doubled the recipe using 8 pork chops. After supper, there were 2 pork chops left. My husband LOVED this dish. We will definately make this dish many more times. I would definately call this "comfort food". I would recommend this dish.

Made this a couple weeks ago, and only just got around to reviewing... Only change I made was to use pork loin because I couldn't find any good thick cut chops and added sage and thyme to the potatoes.  Taste was very good and even the kids ate well.  The only problem I had was also mentioned by others - the potatoes didn't cook completely from raw, even sliced thin on the mandolin, so I had to put the potato mixture back in when the loins were already done.  May try this next time in the crock pot to see whether the longer slow cooking works better.  Definitely keeping this in rotation, I'm just going to play with it a little.

I followed the advice of some of the previous reviewers and cut the salt to about 1/4 tsp. I also added just about 3/4 of an onion since I'm not a big onion fan. It turned out fabulous! My husband raved about the potatoes and I was so happy with how tender the chops came out. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my "keeper" file. Thanks for sharing.

I made the recipe as described but really didn't like it. I realize I'm in the minority. Kind of bland and overly salty. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth for a long time afterwards.

My husband really liked this recipe but my kids weren't crazy about it. I think it was partly because of the Yukon Gold potatoes, they have never eaten that type before. I thought it was really good and had a great flavor. I will make again and maybe try a different potato.

We love this recipe!  It's so easy to prepare and the flavor is awesome.  I do make some slight changes though - I season the chops with garlic powder and onion salt.  I only use about half of an onion over the potatoes and I use enough parm cheese to fully coat chops and potatoes (I don't even measure).  Also, I use about 3/4 c. beef broth.  I let this cook for at least an hour over low heat and the meat practically falls off of the bones.  Delish!!!

I have made this recipe several times.  It is a great way to make pork chops.  They come out tender, not dry.  I increase the amount of liquid slightly and add sliced carrots to make it a complete meal.

Very good and easy skillet meal.  I don't normally like pork chops but the parmesan cheese adds a nice flavor I think.  Maybe a bit salty - so I'd try to cut down on that next time.

Great recipe.  I modified the recipe slightly, adding garlic powder and Montreal Seasoning to the Flour mixture, and to the Parmesan mixture as well.  I had no beef bouillion on hand, so I used a can of beef gravy.  My husband and children loved it and commented that the potatoes and gravy would also be great paired with chicken.

I did have to adjust this recipe.  I had 8 pork chops which I place on my George Foreman grill. Grilled pork chops.  I cooked just enough for it to get juicy and not drain out all the fat.  Seasonings that were added to the meat was salt, pepper, parmesan cheese, lemon juice, garlic salt.  I chopped up one onion; browned set aside.  I cut and sliced about 3 potatoes placed on the skillet and browned the  sliced potatoes on each side. Once the potatoes were cooked on the skillet on each side I added garlic powder on top of the potatoes and a little bit of salt. It makes the kitchen smell so good. I call my dish Grilled Pork Chops with Potatoes and Onion.  I would suggest everyone try this it is so good!!! My children love potatoes so that is why I altered this dish

This was a big hit. I browned and cooked in an electric skillet, and had to make two layers of browned pork chops to feed everyone. It worked great. One change: I season the flour that went on the pork chops with Emeril's seasoned salt and pepper. The meat was tender, and the potatoes and onions had a nice flavor. This is a keeper!

This was delish!  The pork, potatoes and onions all have a great flavor done this way.  I sprinkled the pork with Prudhomme's chicken seasoning before browning and only used one bouillon cube, as I think mine (Knorr) are double strength.  Did not use salt, as there is plenty in the bouillon.  Used bone-in chops and cooked about and hour to make sure they were tender - and they were! Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was great, very comforting.  I didn't have any lemon juice, so I used some dijon mustard instead.  It still turned out great.

I made this for my family and they loved it. I used red potatoes, leaving the skins on. I sauted the onions first before adding them to the dish. I also browned the pork chops.Very easy to make and the results were great!

This is one of the best dishes ever.  I normally don't like pork chops, but I cannot get enough of them when I make this.  My 2 young boys even love it and they are picky eaters.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I leave out the onions though and because I didn't have the Yukon Gold potatoes on hand, I used red potatoes and they were great! Thanks!

This was very good, and it was easy to make.  I only had to simmer for about 30 minutes before the potatoes were done. I also only used 2 bouillon cubes and it was just right, would have been too salty with 3.

I've made this twice now & we've loved it both times.  I prepare it exactly as stated in the recipe and I think it's great.  I also love it because it couldn't be easier.  My picky husband & 2 year old are fans also.  This is a permanent addition to my dinner rotation.

this was so very good. i used too thick porkchops so they didn't tenderize as much, beware.
i substituted one of the yukon golds with a yam because i love them with pork.
the potatoes under the chops became so nicely crispy and a little charred, yummmmmmm.
for sure a keeper.

The pork chops were wonderful, I took the advice from others and used 2 beef cubes. BUT THE POTATOES i think i simmered them for almost 2 hours and they were still not done. I had to feed the family so made some rice instead.

This is a really tasty recipe, it had a nice Parmesany taste with nice crispy potatoes at the bottom. Definitely would make again, just not for company as it has an odd look to it.

I would have absolutely no problem making this dish for company.  It was so easy and it tastes wonderful. I did use 1 onion and 2 bouillion cubes because I had only 3 pork chops. Such great flavor and a great recipe for "cooks" who doubt themselves in the kitchen!!!

This was really good.  I still like our recipe that has saurkraut and tomatoes and onions on top of the pork chops better because of the flavor, but this was a good change up.  I browned the pork chops and then put everything in a baking dish and put it in the oven for an hour at 350 degrees.  I also deglazed the pan that I used to brown the pork chops, with the beef bouillon and added a bay leaf while it simmered.  My kids liked it much better than our saurkraut version....especially the potatoes..yummy.

Simple to prepare and taste excellent! The only thing I did differently was to use low sodium beef broth instead of the boullion and water.   I can't wait to make it again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe :)

I gave this 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe ecactly.  I forgot to flour the chops and just browned them in olive oil.  I also put the onions under the pork chops and sauteed them.  This was a DELICIOUS recipe!  Will make again and again.

This recipe is a good inspiration! I change a little though as I prefer to bake the pork chop in the oven. I marinated the meats for 10 minutes with beef bouillon, garlic & onion powder before coating them with flour & browning them in the skillet. It gave a better taste. With the potatoes, I mixed the potatoes, onion and rest of beef bouillon in the bowl before pouring at the meat before sprinkle it with parmesan cheese. The meat & potatoes are moist, tender & have good taste. I think it’s a little bit too salty but my husband & even my son said they love it. Thank you!

I thought this was just ok, though my husband loved it. I will definitely make it again, though next time I will skip the flour part as another cook suggested. The nice part is that it was all done in one pan, which I did love, so clean up was easy.

I really loved this meal.  My husband doesn't like onions but it gives the pork chops a really great flavor.  I would recommend checking the pork chops 1/2 way through cooking to make sure they don't stick to the bottom of the pan.

WONDERFUL!!!!! My husband and I simply love this dish... my only changes were 2 boullion instead of 3 and I just eye balled the cheese as to what looked good tossed in. Perfect in every other way...
I would give it more stars if I had the option.

Fantastic dish!  The pork chops were very juicy and tender.  I followed the recipe exactly, but would make some changes the next time.  I thought the dish was too salty for my taste, so the next time I would omit the extra salt and only use one or two at the most of the beef bouillon cubes.

This is my first review since joining last year.  My husband is a big pork chop lover, but me.. not so much.  He really loved this recipe and said it was really good through out dinner.  He said it was definitly a keeper.  I thought it was good too for pork chops).  I will make this again.  Good flavor and very tender pork.  I left out the onions because the don't agree with me.  All and all a good recipe.  Next time I might add some other veggies.

This is a terrific recipe! I made this last week but discovered I was out of pork chops, so I used boneless chicken breasts- my family loved it! Only complaint was not enough potatoes and onions. I made this again last night, with pork chops this time, and increased the amount of potatoes and onions and my family was very happy! This is a quick, easy, delicious recipe and will become a staple in our house! Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! A little on the salty side- next time I will just use one buillion cube, and again, not use any extra salt. I also sauteed the onion in some butter until semi-transparent with 1 clove of minced garlic and a small can of mushroom pieces. I added it to the recipe when called for. The chops came out perfect! THANK YOU!

My husband really like this recipe and I liked the ease of preparation. The pork chops are very tender. It did need to cook for longer than 40 minutes,more like an hour or so for the potatoes to be tender.Next time,however, I will marinate the chops before hand for a little more flavor.

Wow! I made this for the first time tonight and it was fantastic!  I did substitute chicken broth for the beef because I had run out of beef and didn't realize it until it was too late.  I also garnished with fresh parsley.  My husband said it was the best pork chop recipe he's ever had.  Thanks so much for posting!

We were really anxious to try this after reading so many positive reviews and even made a special trip to the market to get all of the right ingredients so it could be be prepared without any substitutions. I hate to say it, but to us it was just a very basic meat and potato recipe with very little flavor. Not quite sure how you might want to "punch it up" a bit. Doubtful we will do it again....sorry.

Pretty good, I didn't have any beef bullion, only veggie, so I added some beef gravy powder to it.  Also, added some spices to the flour for the chops.  I would add mushrooms next time.

This was soooo good and pretty easy.  The only thing I might change is to use less pepper.  I thought it was perfect but my husband said a bit too much pepper.

I was pleasantly surprised how tasty this dish was.  I was really stuck for something to make for dinner and thought this sounded easy buy wondered if it was good. Well, it was good and even better the next day for lunch. Will make again.

This dish is very good!  I added paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the flour, also I sauted the onions a little and layer the chops on top of them.  Instead of beef I used chicken bouillon.  The family loved it and asked me to cook it again.

I was looking for something quick to make with the pork chops I had thawed out for dinner.  I found this recipe at the last minute, read a few of the reviews and since I had all the ingredients on hand, I made it.  I do agree with many other reviewers...the smell of this dish cooking was phenominal.  The only thing better was eating it! My husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow for lunch! I will definitely make this one again and again! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

The pork was so tender and the veggies were just right.  What a delicious combination of flavor!  I was skeptical at first but this is a home run.  It makes a fantastic gravy too.

I had actually anticipated that this dish would be boring, but used it anyway because I was in a rush and had an empty pantry.  Turns out it was really good!  It had great flavor, enhanced I'm guessing by the lemon juice (something I never would have thought of using). The added bonus is that it's super easy to make. Followed directions to a T, no need for changes.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was a perfectly adequate meal.  It was very easy to put together and tasty.  I wouldn't say it's anything fantastic, though.  I'll probably make it again as it went over well with my husband.

Good old fashioned recipe and quick to make. I cut my potatoes very thin so had no problem cooking them in the alloted time. The chops turn out moist and delicious and the onion/potato mixture was very tasty.

This recipe is excellent. Has a real old fashioned homecooked feel to it without all the trouble. I took just a few extra steps. As previously suggested I sauteed the onions but I added a tiny splash of balsamic vinegar to the onions while they are frying. They soak it up and it adds alot of flavor.

This recipe is the best. Had limited time. It cooked in less than the time listed in my electric skillet. I didn't have potatoes so made it with just the butterfly chops sprinkled with extra cheese mixture, onion on top and the broth gently poured over all. WILL make it again and again. Served with parmesan noodle pasta. Delicious!

Very good recipe!  I just made it today for the first time and my husband and three year old loved it, too.  I took others advice and used two bouillon cubes instead of three and cut the (Idaho) potatoes really thin and used less onion (just because of my husband).  I also added some carrots.  Because of that, I cooked it a little longer but the potatoes were done on time.  My husband said he's going to tell his Mom about this!  We will definately be fixing this again.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe - I have added it to my recipe collection.  I did double the pepper and next time I will eliminate the salt, since I found it a bit salty, although my husband thought it was perfect!

Made exactly as the recipe says and it was very good!  It cooked in a little less time than stated, about 30 minutes, but that may have been because of the temperature that it was cooking at.  Thanks, we will make it again!

Absolutely the best pork recipe we've ever tasted.  I love how the pork stays so moist and the flavor is excellent.  This has made it's way into our weekly rotation for the winter months.  
Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Very good. I followed this recipe exactly(as I think you should do the first time, especially for reviewing). The pork chops were flavorful and tender. The potatoes and onions were a nice side dish. I will make this again.

I'm giving this a four only because the sauce was soupier than I would have liked for a pork chop dish.  Next time I'm going to thicken it up and it will be perfect for me.  My kids loved it--especially the toddler, she gobbled it up.  I will definitely make pork chops this way again! I grilled it all up in my electric wok.  That made everything SO easy!

OMG! This was a really great dish. Very simple to prepare. Taste is great. I used boneless pork chops and they were so tender and juicey; you could cut them with a fork.

My DH gives this dish 3 stars, but I would have given it 2.  While I'm not certain what I was expecting, the dish was very, very bland in the end.  The only change I made was to season my chops with some garlic powder and pepper and I used about 1/2 can of beef broth instead of the water/bouillon combination.  The end result wasn't offensive, but it was  pretty boring and lacked any real flavour.  On the plus side, my two year old really liked it and ate it all up (could be because he wouldn't eat his lunch though!)

I don't cook often so this recipe was easy and quick for me to attempt.  It turned out delicious!  My 12 year-old daughter is very picky and she gave it two thumbs up. I couldn't get the chops I wanted so I ended up using a thick breakfast chop and that was fine. I didn't have the lemon juice.  We ate the whole thing.  This recipe goes in my Box!!  Thanks!

I was kind of disappointed as I had high hopes for this recipe. The porkchops turned out delicious, but the potatoes left a lot to be desired. I followed the directions exactly (just skipped coating the chops with flour and reduced to two boullion cubes as other posters recommended). Knowing that others said the potatoes didn't seem to cook well, I sliced them VERY thin. I actually used the thin slicing blade of my Salad Shooter (we're talking potato chip thin here), and they still didn't cook in the 40 min. It took almost an hour! If I ever make this again I will DEFINITELY pre-cook the potatoes. Actually if I ever make this again, I think I'll just make the pork and I'll make a different potato side.

This recipe is really tasty and easy to make! I used a large baking potato cut into thin slices. It seemed to take a long time to cook the potatoes through. I left it on 10 extra minutes and they were still slightly crunchy, but we were so hungry we just ate anyway. It may be because I have a gas stove and the low temperature was TOO low. Nonetheless it is a good recipe that I will make again.

I cooked this for an hour, but the potatoes were still on the firm side.  I would have let it cook longer, but my kids were about to go nuts from starvation.  I'm not a huge fan of parmesean cheese, so I thought this was a big, smelly mess.  The pork chops were tender though, and my husband and kids seemed to like everything.

Pork was extremly tender and the potatoes came out perfect. Be sure to slice thin for even cooking.  Used only 3/4 of 1 onion which seemed plenty since I was feeding to my 2 young kids - they don't like onion.  I also sauted the onion prior to layering it on top.  My 2 finicky girls loved this dish so it will be a definate redo.  I think this would work well with chicken in place of pork and will try this way next time around.

This is a good, filling recipe. Added garlic into the the cheese mixture but it could still use a little more flavor. The hubby liked it so I'll keep experimenting!

This was really nice but as one review said it can be very salty I would leave out the salt next time I cook it. Also I made recipe with chicken stock cubes instead of beef bullion and it tasted great.

Made this for the second time, and everyone raved again.  I did add a little garlic powder to the flour for added flavour, and only used 1/4 tsp of salt. This time I didn't slice the potatoes, but used small new ones, cut in half.  We actually like that better, and like another reviewer, I moved them to the bottom of the pan for the last ten minutes of cook time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Awesome!! The reviews were right, the chops were so tender they just fell apart. Tasted great without the lemon juice (didn't have any).  I used store-brand parm. cheese in the can that I had in the fridge, but I'll bet it tastes even better with freshly grated cheese! My potatoes sort of dried up quickly, (but no complaints) so serve it up right away after cooking.

This recipe was pretty good and had a good flavor, but I will cook them longer on each side first next time because the batter was soggy after it was finished.  I might add more parmesean too because I didn't taste it much.  But we did like it, and it was super easy and perfect for a tired night after work because you just throw it all in and you can relax for 40 minutes while it's cooking :).

I've made this many times and my family always raves about it.  How can you miss with meat and potatoes!  It's really easy, too!

Pretty good, but something is missing.... I added garlic powder and onion powder while browning the chops. Nice and easy for that busy day tho. I will made it again.
