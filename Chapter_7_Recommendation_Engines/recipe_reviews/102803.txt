This dish was awesome! Cooked the chicken exactly as directed. Made a sauce using 2 minced garlic cloves and 1 diced white onion sauteed in olive oil, a can of italian stewed tomatoes (undrained) and a little tomato paste. Let that thicken up and spooned over the chicken when it came out of the oven. Topped with shredded mozarella and baked about 5 min longer, until cheese melted. Served over spaghetti tossed with olive oil, salt and pepper! This will be a regular in our house. Simple and Delicious! Thanks for sharing!:)

Foolproof way to make chicken and come up with something delicious.  I used a 1:1 ratio of crumbs and cheese, substituted fresh oregano for the dried, and butter for the margarine.  The aroma made your mouth water as this was baking. Cooking time spot on accurate - the chicken comes out moist and tender.  Quick, easy and satisfying, this is a consistently reliable way to prepare chicken breasts.

This dish has become a weekly standard at our house since finding it on here.  We often substitute regular salt for garlic salt to add a bit more of a kick.  And we always serve on a bed of fettuccine pasta, and (when in season) cooked zucchini on the side.  Got extra coating left over?  we cook it, flake it out, and its a great topping to add a bit of extra jazz to the pasta.

I will definitely be making this again. Simple and delicious. I only had two chicken breasts when I made this so I cut the chicken into smaller pieces so I would have more surface area for all the breading that I made. It was a hit!

This recipe made me look like a super star!! This was easy, and to the point. I followed the recipe to the T, except had to use Italian seasoned bread crubms(was all I had) I borrowed Amyrenee's idea about the sauce and noodles.(made an even better dinner!) Thank you for this Grandma Bogie, I will make this again and again!!

Great recipe.  Used five boneless, skinless thighs and used up all of the coating.  They were moist, tender and delicious.  Will make these again.

Wonderfully easy, delicious chicken. I used chicken tenders for this and baked mine a little longer since I was using a lower oven temp of 375*F. This got raves from everyone. Thanks for sharing Grandmas Bogie's chicken!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I used rice cereal that was crunched up in a bag to bread crumb consistency.  I used rice cereal because one of my family members must now eat gluten-free foods.  Substituting the rice cereal for the bread crumbs did not seem to affect how juicy or flavorful the chicken was! :)

Kid approved - they LOVED this!  Tip - you can use the seasoned ITALIAN breadcrumbs and it will replace the need for the individual spices to be added.  They asked for the leftovers for lunch the next day - that says it all!

I cook for a VERY picky eater who normally likes chicken sprinkled with lemon pepper and baked in aluminum foil.  So imagine my surprise when she loved this recipe!  The only substitution was using cilantro in place of the parsley.  This is easy to make and delicious

Delicious!  Hard to mess this up, unless you over cook the chicken (like I did a bit ... whoopsydaisy) Loved the breading, and (for once) the recipe makes the perfect amount based on the amount of chicken so you don't waste.  Kept to the recipe, although I did not measure the herbs, I'm sure I used a bit more.  The leftovers are great cut up and then warmed in a toaster oven.  I did not serve this as the Italian Chicken Parmesan (with marinara and pasta), but it would be great that way.  I didn't use a sauce at all but served it with Green Beans with Almonds and Caramelized Shallots and Roasted New Red Potatoes, both here on AllRecipes.  Great dinner.

Great basic recipe!  I made a few tweaks to suit our preferences (and what we had on hand!) and did the following.  First, I pounded the chicken breast to about 1/4 inch to reduce cooking time.  For the breading, I used Panko bread crumbs, eliminated the oregano and paprika, and added some basil, marjoram, and garlic.  Fabulous taste, fabulous crunch, and it is now part of our regular rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Wow what a grear recipe.  My 2 1/2 year old eats a whole piece with ketchup of course and she loves it.  My husband who is Italian says it is better than his Mom's.  Now that's a great compliment.  So easy to make!

Very easy to make. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I did add Season Salt tothe recipe in lieu of regular salt. I also dipped the chicken in an egg wash before dipping them in the bread crumb mixture. I also made this a second time using flour to substitute for the bread crumbs since I didn't have bred crumbs on hand. It was still good, but I do prefer the bread crumbs.

I'll admit the only reason I tried is because my dogs name is Bogey!  This was quick and easy and have really nice flavor.   I'm doing low carb so I couldn't use bread crumbs. Instead, I used ground pork rinds. The pork rinds didn't get as crispy as bread crumbs or panko would have, but still delicious.

This dish was good but just seemed to lack flavour.  I tried it again over rice and it was better.  It definitely needed a sauce so to a white sauce I added diced tomatoe, sauteed garlic & onion and some tomatoe juice to give it a nice colour.

This is an incredibly easy recipe.  I've made it not only with chicken breasts, but with boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Super each time.  So easy, and the chicken is always so moist.  An added bonus:  if you have any leftovers, the chicken, sliced thin, makes for an excellent base for a "wrap" in a pita or tortilla with lettuce and tomatoes.  YUM.

I melted Smart Balance in an oven-proof skillet, added chicken tenderloins to coat,removed the tenderloins and added them to a gallon storage bag containing the coating, put them back in the skillet and popped them in the oven for 14 minutes. This was very good and I only used one pan!! All three of my young children asked for seconds-really that says enough.

This was awesome!  The only thing I did different was use Italian bread crumbs, so I didn't add the oregano or paprika!  Very moist and tender!!  Thanks for this recipe!!!

Really good and easy to make.  Since the chicken breasts I had were very large, I cut them in half and pounded to make  thinner.  We didn't have any leftovers and even my very picky eater loved them.  I will definitely make these again.

Grandma Bogie's Parmesan Chicken Haiku: "Not enough bread crumbs, and too much parmesan cheese. Should've read reviews." This was pretty good chicken - put mine on a foil-lined rack so the bottom of the chicken would have the change to get crispy too, rather than sitting straight on a baking pan, soggifying. Could benefit from some garlic powder, or garlic salt, but overall taste was nice, and texture was moist; just not thrilled w/ the 2:1 cheese-to-crumb ratio.

I've made this recipe twice and it is awesome. The only changes (and I hate it when people say they never change the recipe and then go on to list a dozen changes) I made were to the bread crumbs. Instead I used ground almond flour which I grind myself as I am SCD. Thanx LDPS this is a great recipe!

A co-worker emailed me this recipe and I love love love it it.. Super easy and delicious. This is the trick make sure that you beat the chicken breast to make it tender & flatten it out a bit. I also added herb de provence to the mixture. This will be in the weekly line up!

So yummy! Chicken was very tender. And, I didn't use all the spices the recipe called for (I don't typically keep those on hand), but did use Italian bread crumbs. I served over whole wheat spaghetti, and then made a sauce with Italian chopped tomatoes and tomato paste (Italian herb flavor).

Definitely the best breading I've ever used.  Made a nice thick crust that stayed on the chicken.  I'd never tried melted butter instead of eggs or milk, but that may be why it stuck so well on the chicken.  Everyone in my family loved the chicken...didn't even need the marinara sauce I made for it!  :)  I followed directions exactly and had enough for 5 boneless skinless breasts. 
I'm going to try it next with nuggets!  Can't wait!

This was easy and delicious! I used a bit more parm than called for, because we love cheese. Served it with Chicken gravy and  potatoes and parsnips roasted in sea salt and olive oil. Will definitely make this one again!

This recipe tastes better with A1 steak sauce, and with this dish I put olive oil in place of margarine, which made it taste better. Green bean casserole is a great side dish for this meal, you can dip the Parmesan chicken into the green bean casserole's juices. But all together this dish won over the taste buds of my family.

WONDERFUL!  I made the following changes, freshly chopped cilantro instead of parsley, and olive oil instead of butter.  I had 4 lbs of chicken breasts and cut them up into 8 pieces.  I doubled the mixture to be able to coat them all well.  I had to cook it for about 50 minutes but my oven is way off.  I served it with marinara as an option and green beans.  Soooo delicious, everyone loved it in my house, make extra.

This was amazing! I had to alter it slightly because I didn't have all the exact ingredients. Instead of grated Parmesan, I used finely shredded "Fiesta Blend" cheese, and instead of bread crumbs I crumbled up Saltine crackers. I also used lemon juice, rather than margarine, to wash the chicken and hold the dry mixture in place. As a personal touch, I sprinkled a little bit of rosemary on top. It cooked through perfectly, and my uncle and mother both raved about it. Definitely will be making this again!

This is easy and delicious!  I made this almost exactly as written.  I used about 1/2 cup of Panko breadcrumbs, and about 1/4 cup Parmesan because that was all I had.  I also sprinkled in a little garlic powder.  I cut my chicken into 1 1/2 inch strips, like chicken tenders to help them cook quicker.  This was a hit with my entire family.  My son told me to make sure I make this again.  I will!!!

I doubled this, because it wasn't enough for me to do a brief double dip on the chicken. I did add a little garlic powder and I used fresh breadcrumbs made out of toasted homemade bread. Simple and tasty. I served this with Fried Garlic Pasta and broccoli salad.

This is my favorite chicken parm recipe ever! I use italian breadcrumbs. I make it for over 100 people at my job and it’s amazing! I dredge the chicken pretty well in liquid margarine, I believe the more, the more moist it is!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came great! Super quick and easy...the boxed rice I put on side took longer! The chicken came juicy and tender with an awesome buttery flavor.

Overall I think the chicken tasted great! It had a lot of flavor ! The flavor was also strong, I would suggest cooking it for 10 more extra minutes instead of the 20-25 it says to do ! Because when I checked the middle of the chicken it was still a bit pink ! I also added in some little slices of butter on the bottom of the pan to help keep the chicken moist and cook with even more flavor ! All in all this recipe was very delicious!

I saw this recipe this morning and it looked really interesting.  I tried it for dinner and my husband loved the spicing.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts as that is what I had defrosting and they were great!  It would make a good company dinner.

I was looking for an easy chicken parmesan recipe and this one worked well.  It's good and cook time of 20 minutes was perfect.  2 Tablespoons melted butter was perfect for the 4 breast halves I had. For Gluten Free, I used GF Italian Seasoned bread crumbs. As others have noted, there isn't enough bread crumbs. I ended up adding more (1:1 ratio bread crumbs:parmesan cheese). Topped with a little marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese in the last 5 minutes of cooking for my husband and served with spaghetti. Overall, a good recipe that is quick to prepare, but some minor changes are needed for the amount of bread crumbs you will need. Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent, according to my strictest critic (my wife). 
I did make some changes:
1. I used chicken thighs because we both think they have more flavor and they're more forgiving of overcooking.
2. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs because that's what I had on hand, but I also added a little Italian seasoning. And I added smoked paprika because I like the smoky taste it imparts.
3. I used a good quality olive oil instead of margarine.
I'll definitely make it again.

Very good! Used Panko, and added fresh Parmesan to the top. Only change I would make is probably wait to add the Parmesan about 10 minutes before ready, instead of at beginning of bake, as the cheese layer got too crunchy for my liking. Wife also loved this.

Very easy, very good.  Being a garlic lover, I did add some garlic powder to the breading and garlic powder to the melted butter and put just a little bit of the melted butter over the top of the chicken breasts.

This recipe is quite delicious. Instead of whole chicken breasts, I cut them into strips/tenders before breading them. In the oven at 400 for 15-20 mins does the trick. I've actually made them twice this week as my husband, 2 and 6 year olds all love them. I may try them on a roasting pan next to let some of the butter drain, but it's great anyways.

This turned out so good and was incredibly easy to throw together after work. I made one addition - a 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the spice crumb mix. I used Italian bread crumbs and butter instead of margarine because they're what I had on hand. I used about 1.5 lbs of the presliced chicken tenders  (quartered chicken breasts) and it cooked in 20 minutes. I always screw up baked chicken recipes, but this was a total winner. Paired well with broccoli and couscous.

Awesome recipe! I used butter instead of margarine and cut out the parsley (because I ran out)! I double coated the chicken breasts and it was a huge hit even with my almost 2 year old. Definitely will be making this again!

Tasted great even though I forgot to add the breadcrumbs until after I had dipped chicken in egg & rolled in parm spice mix.  The breadcrumbs were the outer layer.  I might intentionally do it that way next time.  And there will be plenty of next times.  So good!

This is SO much better than anything like shake n bake. Just use panko breadcrumbs, swap granulated garlic for the salt (Parmesan cheese is salty enough). Very good! Will make it again!

Meh it was okay. My husband loved it but the kids and I weren't really fans. I made 2 pans: one exactly how the recipe calls and then the other I used ranch to dip the chicken in instead of the butter. I preferred the ranch chicken over the butter dipped.

Followed this recipe exact and it came out great. My husband usually just shovels the food down and doesn't say if it's good or not. This time, he actually complemented the breading. I'll never forget it Lol

Great recipe!  I had some leftover Romano cheese, used it instead of Parmesan.  Loved it!  Also, if you any leftover from the meal, keep it and pour spaghetti sauce on it, piece of cheese, and have wonderful Chicken Parmesan spaghetti!

I keep going back to this recipe and have made it many, many times. I like to use thin-sliced chicken breasts; gives a better crunch factor when it's thin. Thank you for sharing a family treasure!

I bought one large chicken breast and cut it into three even slices.  I used 2 rounded tablespoons Panko, 2 tablespoons parmesan, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and 2 tablespoons butter.  I really coated the chicken with the bread crumbs (multiple times and pressed it on).  I baked it at 450 for about 30 minutes or until it was golden.  Husband loved it!  :)

I tried this dish tonight and was nervous because I have two very picky children who have different tastes and they almost never agree on foods.  But much to my surprise, they BOTH loved it and asked for seconds!  So, thank you for the recipe - I know it will come in handy!  Suzanne

I really liked this recipe. I used Emeril's spagetti sauce that has the bits of garlic in it. I used alittle of it on the bottom of the pan, I served it with caesar salad & gnocchi with more of the sauce on top. yummy!

LOVED this recipe! I played around with the seasonings a bit, but didn't really need to do much at all! Its a great AS-IS recipe! I served it with cheese canneloni and some cheesy garlic bread! It was perfect! Even the picky members of my family gobbled it up!

I made this for dinner last night, and my husband LOVED it. It was super easy to make and very good. I wasn't sure what sauce to use, so I made my Grandma's spaghetti sauce (without hamburger meat of course) and put it on top of the chicken and linguini. It was great. This will definitely become a regular meal at our house!

I thought it was a lot of work and just okay.  In my opinion, it needed a dipping sauce so I made some honey mustard.  I probably won't make this again.  I'm hoping my very young kids will eat the leftovers tonight since it's basically a big chicken nugget.

I followed this exactly other than added 1 tsp of granulated garlic. We gave this a 5 because everyone in our family devoured it, even the kids ages 7 and 5. The 5 year old is especially picky and he was the first one done. I will add this to our dinner rotation for sure.

This was an easy and quick recipe.  My husband are watching calories and fat, and this met our needs.  It has nice flavor and we served it with small salad and side of spaghetti.
