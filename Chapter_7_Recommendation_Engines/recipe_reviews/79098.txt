Delicious wrap sandwich! Perfect for lunch on the go! I cut the recipe in half so I'd have one and my husband could take the rest to work.  I didn't have cream cheese with chives, so I used lite cream cheese and added my own fresh chives. I decreased the dijon a bit (2 tsp.) and used flour tortillas. I also used a smoked deli turkey and sliced swiss cheese vs. shredded.  The addition of the bacon and avocado took this over the top! The flavor combinations in this wrap are simply perfect! You could easily substitute another kind of cheese, but I love swiss.  My husband loves bacon so he definitely gave it the thumbs up!

These were yummy. I wanted to make these freezer friendly so I made a couple of substitutions.. instead of reg toamtoes, I used sun dried and instead of lettuce , I sauted up some broccoli slaw. I left out the avocado. I stuck everything in a wrap, froze them and then took them to work. The bacon makes these  yum!

Wheat tortilla was wonderful.  A little to mustard for me.  Added fine chopped onion and no bacon for taste and keep the fats down.  Will eat again.

I made these for a Birthday party and I cut them in 1" pieces for an appetizer.  I had a few of my girlfriends ask for the recipe.  They have since joined this website for more recipes and tips.  I made them again for my kids lunchbox.  They are picky eaters and my 16 yr. old LOVED them!!!  I made them with low fat chive and onion cream cheese and low fat swiss cheese.  I also added some finely chopped sweet onion as well for extra flavour.  I loved the combination of the dijon mustard and cream cheese.  Next time I may use turkey bacon instead of regular bacon to cut even more fat.  I really liked the avacado and I am wondering if cucumber might be a nice addition as well....This has been added to my recipe box!!!

I was a little scepticle of the dijon mustard mixed with chive cream cheese but it was good.  Spinach tortilla are a must so is the bacon and avocado.  I would like to try this with a more flavorful cheese like havartee.  This would be fantastic with "real" turkey instead of deli.

I will be making this again and again.  I followed the directions almost exactly.  I substituted low fat cream cheese with chives instead of regular, and used turkey bacon.  Also, I didn't have swiss, so I used low fat colby jack slices that I broke into pieces.  These substitutions made it a little healthier and so delicious I am thinking about when I can make them again.  My husband loved them too and thought they were better than any wrap he's had before.

Nice cool wrap for summertime.  The only tweaking I did was that I used bacon bits (sparingly since they can become quite overpowering taste bud wise) & I used plain cream cheese and bought fresh chives which I cut up and mixed together with the cream cheese.  I did use Dijon but sparingly, my husband is not a big fan of mustard and I really wanted him to enjoy the wrap!    Super simple to make, rolled them up and off to the picnic and music in the park we went! Tasted great.  Will definately make again.

I have a picky adult in my household who liked these so much she asked me again the next week.   I used spinach tortillas instead of whole wheat, a mixture of smoked gouda, cheddar, mozzarella and provolone instead of the swiss, and 3 strips of bacon per wrap instead of crumbles.   Definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious! I have made this twice for tailgates, slicing them into smaller wheels for the perfect appetizer size. And have received rave reviews both times. I will definitely make this again.

This was really good I made it for lunch for myself today.  It was so good I had to take a picture of it with my phone and send it to my husband.  I can't wait to make this for him! What I did do different was use plain cream cheese mixed with spicy brown mustard and I used a whole leafy green lettuce leaf. This is a quick, easy and delicious meal.

We had smoked a turkey for some friends the day before heading out on a week long camping trip. We ate these wraps with the smoked turkey for three days...we were pretty bummed when we ran out of turkey...so delish! We added some fresh cilantro the second and third time...even better.

We really enjoyed these. Followed the recipe except I used a heaping TBS of Dijon (kids have commented in the past that it is too strong) instead of the full 2 TBS and it was perfect for us. Having them again for lunch tomorrow to use up the rest of the ingredients. We will make these alot this summer. Thanks for sharing!

Good, quick and easy!  I halved the mixture for 3 wraps and still had some left over.  I also added 1 tbl ranch dressing to the mix.

Bacon, Avocado, Cream Cheese! What's not to like?! But I made the mistake of making the night before and the lettuce wilted & bacon got soft. I have lots of sauce left to make a fresh wrap tomorrow.

This recipe turned out a little dry for my liking. But I didn't use as much dressing as I could have. For the dressing I used 2tablespoons of plain Greek yogurt with a dash each of lime juice, onion powder, garlic powder and chives. Overall they were delicious and felt healthy:)

This makes a good sandwich, sort of like a California club sandwich but rolled up in a tortilla.  I forgot to add the dijon mustard (which would have given it more flavor), but I think it would just be better with ranch dressing.  Turkey is so bland that it needs all the extra flavor that you can add.  The combination of creamy avocado, cool tomato and crunchy bacon adds nice texture and mouth feel to the roll-up.  We'll definitely make this again.

Made these for a road trip and got rave reviews. I was lucky enough to find a ripe avocado right at the store, otherwise I would have tossed this recipe right out.  Used pre-cooked bacon which was fine, and reduced fat Swiss (grated myself), which surprisingly actually had a little flavor. Also used reduced fat chive/onion cream cheese (which I couldn't quite taste, especially over the dijon).  Next time would probably go full fat on everything but everyone was quite happy.  The only bummer was to spread the spread on the tortilla, which made the tortilla mushy over time.  Luckily we ate about an hour into the trip. One more hour on the ice packs and the condensation from sitting on an ice pack would have done it in for sure, but this honestly is a solid wrap.

Made these for a bridal shower over the weekend...What a hit!!! They are sooooo yummy! Only thing I changed was that I mushed the avacados into a paste to spread on the tortillas...

I was making lunch for some friends and wanted to try something DIFFERENT.  I made these wraps and they were wonderful!  I used cracked black pepper turkey, sliced swiss, and added scallions, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I might even add more dijon next time. I'm vegetarian so I left out the turkey and bacon on mine and I thought it was delicious.

Made this for a volleyball tournament (needed some variety for the weekend...lunchmeat on wheat bread gets boring if you have to have it too many days in a row right?!).  I had some slight variations.  I did not get the cream cheese with chives, I got plain cream cheese because it was on sale.  I did not use avocado (I don't like it) or bacon (my daughter didn't want it).  I made 1 wrap without the mustard in the cream cheese (for my daughter - she wasn't sure if she would like the dijon) and 2 with the mustard (she ended up liking both).  I didn't put as much dijon as the recipe called for and I will definitely do that next time because it really adds a nice flavor to the wrap.  I also used a shredded mexican cheese blend because that's what I had on hand.  THIS WAS YUMMY and I will definitely make again with the avocado and bacon for the family because I know they will love the actual recipe version.  Thank You - we enjoyed!

These were very good.  The combination of mustard with the cream cheese and chives was inspired!  I used fresh spinach because I had it, and we thought the wraps were fabulous!  As a matter of fact, I may have to make them again tomorrow!  Served with corn and black bean salad.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe, Rochelle!

Super simple to make one at a time. Ingredients can be taken off or put on for individual taste. I haven't had one yet, but I made one for my boyfriend's lunch today, minus tomato and avocado. He LOVED it and asked for it again today.

These were fantastic. Everyone loved them. Followed the recipe just as written, but I cut down on the serving size and just eyeballed the amounts of mustard and cream cheese to taste as it seemed like it would make just a bit too much for our liking.  I also used real bacon bits for convenience. Great tasting wrap. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband is not a big "wrap" guy, but I made these for lunch this weekend using left over cooked turkey breast meat and we both thought that they were fabulous!  The cream cheese mixture really sets this apart from other wraps that I have had!

I made these without avocado, and used spinach instead of iceberg lettuce. I used the spinach tortillas, and I also mixed up the meats, using roast beef and ham as well, and using about 5-6 super thin slices on each one. I cut them into three's and served them for lunch when a lot of family was staying at my house. They were so great. Everyone raved about the cream cheese spread. I loved that I could make them before hand and keep them wrapped in the fridge until time to serve. Thanks for a great idea.

excellent taste; family loved it!  This beats the ordinary sandwich any day.  Because of personal preference, I left out the chives, used only 1/2 of the dijon amount and added sliced raw mushrooms.   2012 Update: still making these delicious wraps! Most of the time I just use flour tortillas as that is what I have on hand.  Also, I use provolone or pepper jack grated cheese for an extra spicy kick...delightful!

Very good!  Substitutes:  low fat cream cheese and turkey bacon instead of regular bacon.  Also, I did not shred the lettuce or Swiss cheese in an effort to make tidier wraps - worked like a charm.  Everything stayed together nicely.

These are delicious! The recipe makes way more spread than needed for just six wraps. I added bacon bits to the spread to make them stick better. I used 10 tortillas and about 3/4 pound sliced turkey. I think the proportions of the fillings of the original recipe need adjustment.

I gave this four stars because I didnt try the recipe as is so I dont know if the measurements are good or not. I added my own amount of everything to mine. I also changed the wheat tortillas to flour. 
It was wonderful!! I really enjoyed the cream cheese as the spread on this and I made some for my husband when he got home from work and he loved it too! He told me its a "keeper" and that its one I should make "All the time" 
Thanks for sharing the recipe, I'll be making these again

I was very happy with these wraps. Made them for my recipe club, and they were a big hit! I left out the avocado, but made no other changes. I would def. make them again. A great picnic food idea!

These were very good.  They were filling for the amount of calories.  We have been counting calories and using the whole wheat tortillas really cuts back the calorie count.  We can also adjust the calorie count by using less cream cheese spread (or fat free spread), less meat and more veggies.  Thanks for a recipe that we will be using often.

I would cut the mustard in half (and will do so next time I make it) as well as adding a pinch of salt & pepper.  Very filling & tasty!

These wraps are pretty standard fare.  It was the first time I used whole wheat torillas.  I wished I had used flour ones as they are so much more tasty, less tough like the whole wheat.  I left out the advocado nd the bacon because of a dieter in the house.  Next time I'd add the bacon in like it calls for, but likely would still leave out the advocato.

For the dressing, I used whipped cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese (less calories and fat) and this turned out DELICIOUS!! It was so easy to make and pleased all.

Great recipe!  The only thing I changed was to minus the avocados just because I do not like them.  It is high in sodium though, so I used lower sodium bacon to try to diminish a little.  Over all we loved them.  Thanks!

This is a very good wrap. I left out the avocado because we don't like it, and used pre-cooked turkey bacon. We like the unique taste with the cream cheese. Thanks for a good recipe!

I'm on the fence on this.  I was not a fan of the cream cheese with chives/dijon mustard spread.  I'm not a huge fan of mustard to begin with but I was hoping the cream cheese would bury the mustard flavor but it didn't.  I'm going to keep making these but just spread mayo on my tortilla.

Yes will make again. Don’t make them too far ahead as the wrap will get soggy.

Excellent, always looking for new ways to make turkey wraps. Wasn’t sure about the Dijon & cream cheese at first but I made it and it was great and complimented the wrap perfectly!

We made these for a road trip to eat for dinner.  I made them the night before and wrapped them in tin foil.  They were outstanding and I followed the recipe exactly.  Even our picky 9 yr old ate the entire wrap!  Next time I want to try Boursin Cheese instead of the cream cheese.

I made these and they were good! I'll add a little salsa next time to bring it up to a 5-star recipe. By the way, I filled in the recipe in my Weight Watchers app and each wrap calculated out to 19 SmartPoints. That's a bit high for a single meal.

I've made this multiple times! Once, instead of dijon, I used honey mustard and spicy mustard, and I used cheddar instead of swiss. Every time it's delicious!!

Pretty good. Nothing to jump up and down about. However, it wasn't blah and boring. It was a good average rating, I would say. :o)

We really liked these but changed them up a bit. We used cream cheese with chives and onion, and didn't use any mustard or avocado. These were really good. We'll have them again!

We loved these for lunch!  I played around with different flavored tortillas and flat breads I found.  I also didn't crumble the bacon and just put a full slice or two in each and left out the tomato.  yum!
