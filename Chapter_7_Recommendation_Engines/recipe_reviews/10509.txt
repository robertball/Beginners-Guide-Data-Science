These are really great. Better than regular chocolate chip cookies in my opinion. However you can taste the coffee in the batter but hardly at all in the cookies. Next time I will add more coffee. Still awesome though!

Great cookies. I added a little extra coffee and about 1/4 cup extra flour. The cookies were crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. Perfect!!!!

I hate to disagree with the other reviews but I didn't care much for these cookies. I generally love anything mocha flavor but these had an odd almost burned taste and they spread like pancakes even after refrigerating the dough for several hours. Not at all pretty to look at. I ended up spreading the remaining dough in a square pan and making bar cookies which were more attractive.

Well what was originally a mistake turned out to be very good! I added a bit too much melted chocolate and ended up with something more like cake batter. So I spread it in a greased 8X8 pan and baked it about 35-40 min. Voila! Mocha chocolate chip brownies! Extra coffee really does boost the flavor and my only suggestion would be less sugar. They're almost too sweet but very yummy (especially topped with whipped cream!)

I make this recipe with white chocolate chips; the lightness of their flavor sets off the richness of the dark chocolate and coffee. I love that these cookies come out nice and chewy.

These cookies are absolutely amazing. The photo someone submitted makes them seem lighter than they were for me. Mine were pretty dark due to the melted chocolate in the batter. HUGE hit with the people at work.

I made this recipe using 3/4 espresso chips and 1/4 regular chocolate chips and it was fantastic. A coffee and chocolate lovers fantasy.

These were too crunchy and thin for me - not chewy at all! And the coffee flavor was overwhelmed by all the chocolate! The idea is great though and they are good if you like crunchy chocolate cookies but I will work on tweaking these cookies until they come out perfect - thanks for the idea!

This was the first recipe I made from CookieRecipe.com; I loved the chewy texture and deep chocolate taste. I am considering adding more coffee on my next batch to bring out more of the mocha flavor.

"Moaners" is a great description. These cookies are addictive and absolutely sinful. I do modify the recipe very slightly; I use 1 cup semi-sweet 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and use macadamia nuts rather than walnuts. I'm currently making my second batch this time using baking Splenda rather than white sugar (regular brown though) and they seem to be coming along just fine.

Love it! I took them into work and everybody loved it. They're now asking me for the recipe so they can make the cookies for themselves.

A great tasting crisp cookie but I have to agree with some of the others-- the dough is far too "liquidy." I had to add an entire extra cup of flour to it. They do spread so be sure to put extra space between the cookies. Also makes more like 3 dozen rather than 4 so you may want to consider doubling the recipe. I also cooked them for only 9 minutes.

Fabulous -- rich and delicious! I used dark choclate chips instead of semi-sweet and left out the nuts. I'm not sure if they last well because I made them for someone else but the one I had was yummy!!

I loved these! I used pecans and almonds instead of walnuts and used 3 tbsp of coffee instead of 2. I dropped bigger spoonfuls onto the sheet and baked for 10 min or less. They were less crunchy and burnt. These are wonderful but extremely chocolaty!!!

The cookies had a good taste. My mom who loves dark chocolate liked the cookies. My only complaint was that they were not soft they were more of a crunchy cookie which I really don't care for. If you like dark chocolate and a crunchier cookie this is a good recipe

As some other reviewers said these turned out to be thin. We didn't have any instant coffee so we used a small amount of (believe it or not) coffee grounds instead. It helped with the missing-coffee-flavor problem. The flavor turned out well enough that we still all ate and enjoyed them. In fact the thinness made them FABULOUS with coffee ice cream.

The flavor of these cookies is wonderful. However mine look nothing like the picture posted with this recipe. Mine resemble more like lava rocks than cookies. I drizzled some extra melted chocolate over the top and made them even better!

I brought these into work and everyone loved them! I was worried that they would be too rich but no one noticed the coffee flavor until I told them that it was in there. They just thought they were chocolate cookies.

Even after doubling the amount of coffee you still couldn't taste the coffee flavor after the cookies were baked. You could taste it just fine in the dough though. However the dough was more like a batter. Very liquidy should chill for a while first. The cookies stuck to the bottom of the pans pretty badly. I even tried greasing the pan for my last batch but it did not help much. In the aftermath the bottoms were scraped up the cookies were crunchy around the edges soft in the middle and tasted just like chocolate cookies.

I found a similar recipe that calls for 2 TEASPOONS of boiling water rather than 2 TABLESPOONS. This change would probably thicken the batter for all the reviewers who found it too runny. See "Mocha Walnut Cookies" by Carmela Sagendorf

From the moment I mixed the espresso powder into the boiling water something smelled burnt. Crazy as it sounds the cookies tasted burned because of the smell. The cookies were very crispy despite being convection baked and they were hard to get off the cookie pan. I considered doubling the recipe glad I didn't.
