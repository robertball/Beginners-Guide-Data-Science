This was really good! The closest store didn't have chipotle peppers, which would have made this even better, so I used Chipotle Tabasco sauce instead. I used the extra marinade as a dip. All four people that ate it, loved it. I also added mushrooms, which I marinated. YUM!

This was okay, but not fabulous.  My husband wanted more heat, my two-year old less heat.  It was hard to taste the "ranch" base of this, which is either really good or really bad depending on your position on ranch.  She did enjoy the grilled mango and pineapple though. Don't think I'll repeat this one.  There are too many other really good skewer recipes out there to put this one in the "permanent" file.  Worth a one shot test run for anyone though.

YUM!!! I've made this twice now. I didn't care for the mango the first time I made it, so this time I used all pineapple. Also used freshly made ranch 'cause I think bottled ranch is gross.:) Definitely worth making, especially when these norcal days reach the triple digits and cooking indoors is out of the question!

I loved this! The pineapple and mango were different, but what really made this stand out was the way the Chicken and onion flavors combined with the marinade. I will be making this again...and again!

Really good kabobs!  I used regular Ranch, not organic, which worked fine. Next time, I would marinate these longer to get more flavor.

This was good. Not too spicy for my 11 yr old son. He loved it. My mango, unfortunately, wasn't too ripe, but man...the onions!  I gobbled them up! I saved a bunch of the dressing and will have it on a salad today. I loved it!

My boyfriend and I both LOVED this recipe! It had just enough zing to make your nose run a little but sweet enough to make you want more.  My guy is a man of few words, but he can't stop talking about how good it was!

I made this last weekend for a small cook-out.  A definite hit!
