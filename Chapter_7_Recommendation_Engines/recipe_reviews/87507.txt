This is the best soup ever!

I'am not one to sit over a stove, so I figured out how to cook it in a crockpot.  Throw all ingrediants into a crockpot (I also add parboiled chopped red potatoes) and cook on high for two hours.  Add crab and cook for one more hour.  Enjoy!

Original review 11/3/05---This was very good! I used canned corn & canned crab (I only had 12 oz. of the lump crab & used a 6 oz. can of fancy white....I didn't care for the fancy white & will make sure I have enough lump for next time), I added a tsp. of Old Bay & also a can of cream style corn. Next time I think I will try the suggestion of using whipping cream instead of the half & half to add thickness. I meant to top it w/ parmesan cheese but it tasted so good I forgot! Update 5/28/06--- Made this for lunch again today but this time I used fresh king crab leftover from last night...fresh is definitely best but then we knew that already. ;o) I also used fresh corn this time & to be honest, I like it better w/ canned or frozen. Instead of sprinkling w/ parmesan, I made Parmesan Crisps (from foodnetwork site) to garnish them w/ & they were so cute!

Great recipe.  I, too, substituted Old Bay Seasoning (1 1/2 tsp) for the cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper, and also added 1/2 tsp ground marjoram.  Be sure to thoroughly rinse the lump crabmeat; I sprinkle it with lemon juice BEFORE rinsing it to help remove the "crabby" smell and taste.  We live on the Gulf coast where this dish is a staple; this recipe is as good, if not better, than most local restaurants serve.  We sprinkle parmesan cheese on top-- delicious!

I did what I always do with a new recipe. I made it exactly as described to get an idea what the author had in mind. Then I made it again and tweaked it to my taste. What I noticed right away was that the bay took over and gave the entire dish a cloying bay flavor. So I just used one leaf and at that I took it out after the 10 minute simmer. That brought the bay into balance. The other thing I noticed was a lack of seafood flavor in the finished product. So, I substituted 28 oz of clam juice for 28 oz of chicken broth. I also substituted 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning, which has a minimal bay contribution, ironically, for 1/2 tsp Cajun Seasoning. These changes  mellowed out the bay while adding seafood flavor.

Made this dinner tonight and it was fan--tastic! Never made any sort of crab meal before as my wife hates seafood (it's a texture thing), but she loved this soup.  The only thing I did different from the posted recipe was to add three strips of sliced, cooked bacon, because, well, bacon makes everything better.

This recipe was very easy to follow and sooo tasty, my guests all had second helpings! I made a few modifications - for thickening I used heavy cream instead of half and half and added a  litte extra, as well as 2 extra tablespoons of flour. I also omitted the cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper and instead added 1.5 teaspoons of Old Bay spice. Tasted great and with lots of flavor!

This recipe is awesome! It is different from the crab bisque that I have had, but it rates right up there. Also, super easy to make. I used whipping cream instead of half and half and shredded the imitation crab up instead. I also used a can of muchroom soup in place of one of the chicken broths. You have to try this recipe!

This recipe was super.  I omited the cajun seasoning all together, halfed the cayenne and used Old Bay seasoning as well.  I used canned corn and it worked fine. Also used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half, think it helped with the consistency.

All I can say is "wow."  This recipe is amazing.  My husband proclaimed at first bite that this was by far the greatest thing I have ever made him!  THank you so much!  A few quick things: I even used canned corn (for speediness) and it was great, AND I added the ol' family staple, a heaping tsp. of Old Bay!!!  Yum!

I love this bisque. I'm a college student so I'm always looking for something to make and then freeze and use for a few days. I used imitation crab flakes instead of lump crab ($1.99 vs. $16.99) and it still taste wonderful. Just crumble the flakes. This is an amazing and easy recipe.

I've made this recipe for a few years now and it's always excellent!  I usually go lighter on the chicken broth though, and heavier on the half and half (about 1 to 1.5 cans of broth and double the half and half), and I feel it tastes much better that way.

Very yummy!  I had some crab that needed to be used up...  It was excellent the for dinner, and made great left-overs also!  I did follow some of the substitution suggestions: heavy cream instead of half and half, old bay instead of Cajun seasoning, and canned corn instead of fresh.

This was just ok for me...I'd really expected to LOVE it.  Surprisingly, it was a bit..bland.  I'd even taken the advice of a previous reviewer and caramelized a little corn w/the onion in the hopes it would really make the corn pop.  Not so much.  This soup was also VERY hot, and I really like spicy foods.  I had to add some sherry to try to tone it down a bit.  My guests *said* they enjoyed it, but would anyone really say anything else?

This soup is excellent!  My husband loves it ~ way too spicey for the kids.  I cut the recipe in half (only 2 of us will eat it) and then cut the cajun seasoing in half again and it was still hoooot!  But great!  Thanks!

This is pretty good, but more of a soup than a bisque.  It could be thicker and have more of a kick.  I pretty much made the recipe as listed, but added a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste and added some hot pepper sauce.  Next time I would add at least one can less of the chicken broth to thicken it and add more of the seasoning and pepper sauce.

Really liked the kick this soup had! I would highly suggest to follow the recipe and use fresh crabmeat. I used canned crab and didn't like the texture with the soup. Next time around I may also try and use whipping cream like the other reviewers said. The soup could of been a little thicker. However overall great recipe and got the hubby's approval!

This was a very good bisque - served to 5 people and they all really liked it.  Fairly easy to make as well.  Came out thinner than what I had imagined for a bisque, but was still good.  I even used the whipping cream in lieu of half and half and threw in some extra flour to try and thicken it up but still pretty thin.   But great flavor overall.  Would make again.

Loved this recipe.  Easy and good.  My whole family loved it.  Remember it is a bisque and not a chowder - I was expecting someting a bit thicker. I added more seasonings than called for and also put in some of Emeril's Essence.  I used sweet frozen corn instead of fresh.  Pefect recipe for fresh caught crab.

This had a great flavor but I thought it could have been a little thicker. I ended up adding some extra flour to do this. I used canned lump crab meat and canned corn and it was still good. I also used fat free half and half. Thanks for the great tasting recipe.

Came out great and was VERY easy to make!  I made a couple changes...I eliminated the cayenne and cajun seasoning.  I used old bay as i had seen others suggest, I also mad a rue with the flour instead of adding the flour to the broth.  If anyone is looking for a way to make it gluten free, I was successful at making my rue with potato flour and a little bit of xanthan gum.  I was so excited that it worked....no one was the wiser.  I also used a cup of heavy cream instead of the half and half and milk.  For the crab meat, I used canned lump crab meat.(blue crab brand I think. $17.99 for the 16oz can)  I did use fresh ears of corn but i am not sure that was necessary.  My husband and daughter loved it and are fighting over the leftovers.

Excellent just as it the recipe states.  I did accidentally puree more than 1 cup of the corn base, but it came out quite lovely, smooth with small bits of corn and (LARGE) bits of fresh. dungeness crab from the Pacific.  WHEN I make it again, will try and use something with a bit of color to brighten up the presentation (perhaps microdiced carrots or red pepper)and possibly a dash of sherry to impart some depth of flavor. As it was, the recipe came out creamy, spicy (just right) and a big HIT!!  My family loved it!!

This is a very good soup.  Did a few things others suggested including using old bay in place of Cajun seasoning.  I also added a can of cream of mushroom in place of one of the chicken broth cans.  Used all half and half (no milk).  Whole family including 10 year old loved it.  I also added about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar which really made it great. Mmmmmm

Made this for a quick Sunday dinner and it was delicious.  Unfortunately, I only had imitation crab so I had to use that.  But we did have fresh sweet corn so that just made the soup.  We would prefer it a little bit thicker and I think it's b/c I used soy flour, not all purpose that it didn't get as thick.  Also used Old Bay instead of the cayenne and cajun.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I didn't have half and half or any heavy cream. So, I added about 3 Tablespoons of cream cheese and WOW! It was super good, but maybe a little too thick so I would use a little less cream cheese next time. I added it to the food processor.

Very good! I added two diced celery ribs  and a diced carrot to the onion, used two cups of frozen corn kernels instead of the fresh ears, and imitation crab instead of real crabmeat (due to the price), but otherwise kept it as written. The flavor was great: almost too spicy, but the heat didn't really build in your mouth - it sort of dissipated after each bite, so it kept the spices from being overwhelming. My house does tend to like things spicy, though, so I can see how some people would think it was too spicy. I served with thick slices of bread with cheese broiled on top. Will definitely make again!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I did use heavy whipping cream instead of half and half to make it thicker.  I will be making this again.

Great recipe!  I mistakenly doubled the flour, but found the consistency perfect with the additional flour.  I tried it with a topping of grated parmesan, but preferred a sprinkling of finely chopped green onion.  I will serve this next Christmas topped with the green onion and a little paprika.

This Bisque was devine! I didnt have any problems with the consistency. I followed a few suggestions,I used old bay seasons and added cayenne pepper to my taste.  I made a roux first with 3T of Butter & 3T of flour and set aside. I only used 1 can of stock and I used cream instead of milk or half & half. When the cream was added I added in the roux and whisked. I think what helped with the consistency as well was I diced a potato and added to the corn, stock mixture. I took out a cup of the bisque and pureed it and then added back to the bisque before adding the crab meat. I did also add a about a 1/4 cup of wine. I garnished with some crab meat. I have made with canned and fresh corn and a combination of both. Didnt affect the outcome a whole lot either way, it depends on your particular taste. I liked the combo.  The flavor was oh so good!!! and so easy Thank you - a keeper

We had this as our New Year dinner treat!  It was AMAZING!  I used canned lump crab and the frozen corn (2 1/2 cups).  I did wash the crab with a bit of lemon juice and water as another reviewer suggested.  It came out great! Of course fresh would be even better but more $$$.  Next time I would add some chopped red bell pepper for some color.  YUM!

Tasty recipe. I added 1 Tbs. Old Bay Seasoning along with the bay leaves.  Also added about 1 tsp. Lemon/Pepper Seasoning.  Used 1/2 and 1/2 and skim milk.  We like it spicy so this was a good recipe.

This was a very good. I used Cajun seasoning, but I really wish I'd used Old Bay instead. I think Old Bay would complement the crab better than Cajun.

I made this recipe today and it is phenomenal!  I made some changes to fit my dietary needs.  I used fat free milk and fat free half and half.  It was still VERY tasty and rich tasting.  I love this recipe and it will be something I make often!

WOW this was amazing! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I only had 1/2 the amount of crab available (I thought it was sufficient, more crab would be nice but it was enough) and used 2 cans kernel corn and 2 cans creamed corn. I followed others advice and washed the crab meat, and it kept it from getting that super fishy flavor. I'm eating the reheated leftovers now for lunch and WOW! FANTASTIC! Great spicy flavorful kick!

This was really good.  I must admit that I did make some little modifications.  I didn't have any fresh corn on the cob available and I wanted to make sure the bisque was creamy so I used a can of sweet cream corn and I only had canned lump crab meat available.  I'm sure it would be a real hit with fresh.  I've been looking for a recipe similar to this ever since I was at a business conference in San Diego and stayed at Lowes Coronado Bay Resort and they served a corn and crab chowder to die for.  With some tweaks I think I can achieve the same taste.  Thank you!

Wow!  This was amazing.  I made it with imitation crab meat and canned corn. I used the original spices called for.  It is spicy, but it works well with the rich creamy base.  My husband doesn't care for imitation crab meat, but he enjoyed this.  This is a keeper.

Wow!  Just finished my first bowl and it is delicious.  My variations:  added one drained can of corn along with the onions and cooked both to a light carmelized stage.  After removing the cup of broth for the food processor, I added a can of creamed corn.  Used all half and half and no milk and upped the amount of flour to 4-5 tablespoons.  Oh, and used creole seasoning. I still don't know if that is different from Cajun seasoning but it worked great!  Going for bowl #2 now.

Thanks for a great recipe.

Good overall flavor.  I thought that it was a bit salty, but my husband thought it was fine (I used McCormick's Cajun seasoning). Next time I will use a low sodium chicken broth.  If using frozen corn, 1 16oz bag (or 3 generous cups) worked well.

This had excellent taste, but it only got 4 stars because the consistency was very thin.  The title should be "soup", because "bisque" implies a creamy, thicker broth.  I added about 2T corn starch, and it still was not very thick.  I also used heavy cream instead of half and half.  Perhaps less broth and more flour/corn starch and heavy cream?

I roasted a bag of frozen white sweet corn (thaw and dry kernels on paper towels, roast on a cookie sheet covered with foil for 10 mins, stir corn around, and roast for 10 mins more at ~425) to make this soup with. I also replaced the cajun seasoning/cayenne pepper with Old Bay and added ~1/4 tsp cayenne on top of the Old Bay to really give it a bit of a kick. This was a huge hit! 

My MIL has been making her crab bisque recipe for years to serve on the night before Thanksgiving. Since I hosted this year, she asked me to make the bisque. Her comment was, "It's not usually good to show up your mother in law, but I think we're going to use this recipe for the crab bisque from now on." Great success!!

Overall, this is a great recipe. I've made it a few times now but with a few additions. I added a bag of sauteed bay scallops (the small, dime sized ones), a whole, diced sweet onion, two diced red bell peppers, 5 slices of applewood smoked, thick cut bacon (because bacon), and two diced poblano peppers. This is mainly for the red and green color but the poblano adds a smooth heat that I really like. I generally add a bit more Old Bay (substituted for Cajun spice) and a little smoked paprika. Everyone's tastebuds are different so make it your own! Pan seared diver scallops on top to put it over the top...

The flavor was okay, but it wasn't creamy enough, as the broth was too thin to be a "bisque".  I followed the recipe, only using Old Bay seasoning and regular canned corn ( drained ) instead of creamed.  I found that adding a generous dollop of sour cream into the soup helped, and next time I will use all heavy cream instead of the milk and half and half. Sitting in the frige overnight will probably help the flavors to meld as well.

After reading others comments, and a few other recipes I made a few modifications and the results were awesome.  I decreased the chicken broth to 2 and 1/2 cups, added 1/2 cup white wine,  increased the Cajun seasoning to 2 tsp., I used 16oz. of frozen creamed corn, 1 can cream of celery soup, so I was able to eliminate the half and half, milk and flour.  I pureed with heavy whipping cream in step 2 and it was the perfect consistency, so step 3 was eliminated altogether. We loved it and will have it again many times this winter.

I usually don't rate recipes due to time factors but really like this recipe.  I did use frozen corn due to the time of year and it worked just great.  I did add more flour mixture to make thicker purely for preference.  I did feel it was missing something that I was use to from restaurants so I decided to add 1 cup of cooking Sherry and absolutely loved the result.  I can't wait for my family to get home and try it!

Yummy - hit the spot when I had a cold. Used frozen corn and 1.5 tsp of Old Bay instead of the seasonings in the recipe. Otherwise, followed recipe to a T. Served with a salad and crusty bread. Looking forward to leftovers.

this soup was a hit! I followed it almost exactly except that I used a little less crab meat since it is so expensive.  I used .7 lb.  It was plenty.  I also used Old Bay spice instead of Cajun spice and a few more garlic cloves.

This was wonderful. I followed the recipe almost to the T. I pureed a bit more of the mixture because I used extra corn and it was fabulous. My husband and I like spicy, so it wasn't too hot. I did rinse my fresh crab meat in water and a splash lemon juice, and I was glad I did because it would have been too seafood-y. YUMMY! It was really great; perfectly creamy and seasoned in my opinion.

Very good! I made this for my husband on his birthday and he loved it! Like others suggested, I omitted the Cajun seasoning and added Old Bay seasoning instead. I did half the corn called for and added salad shrimp. DELICIOUS! This will be a regular in my house!

I followed the recipe exactly my first cook through, and I must agree with Lovestohost, it did not catch my interest but I followed one mans advice who had my exact mindset, Bacon does make everything better probrewer, this made the soup fantastic. I also threw in some red wine to enhance the flavor of all solid ingredients, and that worked wonders. Instead of 3 cloves (I used that on my first cook through) I used 4 1/2 (I suggest using this amount) and I don't know who actually thought to add Old Bay when there were ingredients coming from all different directions but WOW good call.

Had this soup tonight; very tasty.  I also used canned corn and canned crab; believe, of course, better with fresh, but had to improvise.  I used cream instead of half and half, also I used white wine instead of water to mix with the flour, and added about 1/4 cup sour cream, about a tablespoon or so of tarragon, 1/8 cup sherry and 1 tablespooon of butter whisked at the end before serving.

This would have been very good.  I made it according to the recipe, but used Old Bay instead of cayenne per other reviewers.  Took it to a soup contest at my sister's house and tasted it--it was good but bland.  So I added spices and cayenne and it ended up too hot.  My fault for adding too much cayenne.

Absolutely wonderful! The favor is LIKE THAT! I did not use a food processor and used heavy whipping cream and milk, adding it slowly and continuously stirring. I love spice so it was just right! I too used Old Bay seasoning but I also added chopped shrimp (small size) and chives...I was so excited to see I made this! It's delicious and my fiance can't get enough! Great base recipe!

DELICIOUS. I made it exactly as it said to, except I used imitation crab (only 8oz was plenty to me) because fresh crab is crazy expensive. It was soooo good and my husband (who does not like corn) absolutely loved it. I will be making this again and often!

The broth was awesome. I would use that part of the recipe again. The crab turned me away, there was too much. Also, corn was in season, so the corn was much tastier than the crab.

Excellent. I used three 6-oz cans of Chicken of the Sea fancy crab, two cans of creamed corn and 16-oz of heavy cream instead of milk. No cayenne, I substituted a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce. So good that when my daughter turned up her nose at it, I didn't even make her eat it. More leftovers for me.

It was OK, probably won't be making again.  I think a bisque should be smooth and creamy, and this was not, mainly because of the onion (and I think the onion flavor detracted from the crab).  Also the proportions seemed off, the flour was not enough to thicken properly.

This is by far one of my favorite soups! I have made it many times and my family LOVES it.  I have made it exactly like in the recipe, but I have changed some things which I feel have only made it better.  Some things I do recommend doing is doubling the flour and using more heavy cream.  I usually just buy a 16 oz carton of heavy cream and use half with the flour and half just in the soup.  It makes it a little more creamy, more like a bisque.  One thing that I did last time was follow one reviews idea and added bacon.  I cooked the bacon in the pot till it was super crispy, and then I caramelized the onions and garlic in the bacon grease.  Might not make it healthy, but it does make it tasty.  Enjoy!

Maybe it was because I used canned fancy white crabmeat, or canned corn, but this just didn't do it for me.  I simmered it longer than the recipe called for, and the corn was overcooked.  I also used a can of creamed, so it was just really "corny" in general.  The spiciness was just perfect; I used Old Bay and a dash of cajun spice.  I used a splash of pepper sauce and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top of each serving, and that really added to the flavor.

THIS RECIPE IS SOOOOOO GOOD!  It was so easy and was ready very quickly.  I sweated onions and added flour to make a rue, then added the broth...  My goodness!  Rich, creamy, a little sweet and a spicy.  GOOD JOB!

Woderful!  I used 2 cans of corn and heavy cream instead of half and half because that's what I had available.  Turned out perfect, plenty thick enough.  My family loved it too much...no leftovers for later!

I made this for a family dinner yesterday to serve before the main meal and we all loved it!  It's delish!  I did use heavy cream instead of half/half and added 1 heaping tsp. of Old Bay (as suggested by other reviews).  The 1 tsp. cayenne pepper adds a tasty "zing".  I will be making this again!

The soup is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly. I even froze the leftovers and pulled them out the other day, and after two months and it was still very tasty. Thanks!

Divine.  I used imitation crabmeat and was very happy with the results (and lower grocery bill!)  Served with a warm, crusty roll, it was a nice treat to myself!

Made this but reduced the liquid based on other reviewers suggestions and did some of it by instinct and taste (I like a little more corn for example).  I also added about 1/2 cup of pinot grigio for taste.  It turned out well, my inlaws are begging for the recipe.

Decided to give this a try. Followed other users advice and used whipping cream instead of the milk. Even after adding the flour & cream, it was very "soupy". I had a terrible time thickening - but I used Wondra flour and some more cream, and it thickened up nicely. A lot of heat in this recipe, so if you dont like your food too spicy, I would definitely cut out the cayenne all together. Used frozen corn in butter sauce instead of the cobs, and I also added a few sprinkles of Old Bay at the end. After tasting, it was still missing something, so I added some dill and a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Next time I will only use 2 cans of chicken stock, and perhaps it will thicken a bit easier. Still spicy but very yummy!!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I did modify it slightly.. Instead of using half and half, I used heavy whipping cream.  I couldn't get fresh ears of corn so I used about 1 cup of frozen sweet corn kernels.  I also added Old Bay Seasoning to taste near the end. Enjoy.

This soup is great and would be excellent as a main course!  I wouldn't change a thing!  We didn't have half and half so we used half heavy cream and half whole milk, still turned out great!!  This one is a keeper!  Thanks!  =)

This was SOooooooo good!  What a great way to use up leftover crab legs.  After reading the reviews, in place of the 1/2 and 1/2 and the milk, I used heavy cream.  Although the consistency turned out perfectly, might not do it again as hub said it was very rich, that it was great but "you can't eat a lot of it".  Hhhmmm, maybe I'll keep it as is, ha-ha.  I CAN eat a lot of it --his portion, too :)

This recipe was pretty good. I followed the directions exactly. I found it to be a tad bit too spicy and a bit too thin for a bisque. If I do make it again, I will definitely cut down on the cayenne pepper.

This is absolutely the best chowda I've ever had (even though it's listed as a bisque)!!! You can use this recipe for just corn chowda, or go with fish or crab. I cut the recipe in half just in case it was just an OK recipe, and I wished I had used the original recipe. My boyfriend & I fought over the left overs!!! This is definately a keeper!!! Thank you TattoChicc

This soups was really good! I followed the directions as they were written but followed the advice of others where I doubled the flour which made the soup thicker bit not too thick. Flavor was excellent! Would make again.

Made the crockpot version as written by Shelah.  Cut down Cajun seasoning by half and left out pepper entirely as the females don’t like spicy food.  It turned very well, enough zip for me and not too much for the ladies.  Using real crab makes it fairly expensive but it’s worth it.

I made this recipe recently, and it was absolutely delicious. 

It was creamy, flavorful, and perfect for fall. If you're a seafood lover, as my husband and I are, you'll find yourself craving this soup. 

I used frozen corn, and a little less seasoning than the recipe called for. Other than that I left the recipe alone, and it was perfect. I can see how it could be flexible, to allow for the addition of other ingredients (I'll add some shrimp next time!) or herbs to your taste. You could no doubt add a little more or less liquid to your preferred taste or texture. 

We did indeed eat this with crusty French bread, and it was so delicious. 

I am not a very experienced cook, and I also don't like overly complicated recipes. I found this to be easy to prepare, and the results were top-tier. I would be proud to serve this to guests, but I won't, because my husband and I are going to eat all this ourselves. It's so, so good!

Yummy!  I think this would be delicious as is, but I tweaked it a little to suit my taste.  I used frozen corn, added celery, added a few teaspoons of tomato paste, used old bay instead of the other seasoning and used heavy cream instead of the half and half.  Oh and I only used two cans of the chicken broth.  My husband usually doesn’t like crab bisque but he loved this!

The flavor of this was really good, even my kids liked it. However, it wasn't as thick as I would have expected it to be for a bisque. Any suggestions on how to make it thicker are welcome:)

This recipe was really good. I loved the spiciness with the cayenne pepper. I used two cans of corn instead of fresh corn and doubled the crab. So, mine was more hearty but the flavor was awesome with the sweet crab, butter and kick of cayenne

My brother is battling cancer and he asked if I could make crab bisque so I found this recipe. I have made it several times in the past six months because it's now his favorite (he is very picky). I followed the recipe the first time, and loved it, but I've made a few changes since. Like others, I now use heavy cream instead of half and half. I also use leeks instead of onions because I love the flavor. 

Last but not least, I use a hand immersion blender to puree the entire pot of soup prior to adding the flour, etc. I prefer a chunkier soup but my brother prefers it smoother. He also likes it garnished with creme fraiche, which is good but not necessary. Overall, it's an excellent recipe.

Had some leftover crab and wanted something different so I found this and tried it. Oh boy yummy! I would put half the recommended amount of cayenne pepper and I used a can of sweet corn as corn on the cob is not in season. Will make againfor sure!

I absolutely loved this recipe, it was delicious and the perfect portion size. I really like how the cheyenne pepper gives the soup a little kick but, I would use a little less on the next go around. All in all easy and delicious recipe.

The taste was great, I actually grilled the corn first and also used some Old Bay seasoning.  Not to sure about the 15 minute prep time, probably more like 30.  I would also use less corn like 2-3 ears vice 4.

I didn’t have Cajun seasoning so like many others here I substituted Old Bay. I also didn’t have fresh corn so I used a can of creamed corn. It turned out really well and was easy. I’m always a fan of “easy”. Oh, and it froze pretty well. Thanks!

Love the recipe as written.  For a slightly healthier option I’ve used half the butter, fat free skim milk, and fat free half and half.  For variety I’ve  tried Old Bay instead of Cajun seasoning, and I’ve added shrimp cut in bites.  For convenience I use canned corn.  It’s always great, and freezes well.

Used heavy cream instead of half and half and Emeril’s Essence instead of Cajun seasoning.  Wonderful soup. Has a lot of kick to it and very easy to make.

We had a bushel of steamed blue crabs and made a seafood stock with the leftover claws. Needed something to do with a gallon of stock so decided to make this recipe.
Followed the recipe except substituted chickbroth with seafood stock and subbed creole with old bay. 
It came out a bit thin for my taste. So I remade the recipe with the following modifications
Replaced broth with seafood stock
Replace 1/2 & 1/2/milk with heavy cream
ADDED a jar of clam juice. 

Those modifications made it restaurant quality in my opinion, but definitely upped the calories.

I added 1/4 cup parmesan at the end and garnished with fresh parsley.  I also did 12oz claw meat and 4 oz fresh clam. Like others I used canned corn, 1 whole 1 cream. I also added about a tablespoon of tyme.

this is an amazingly versatile soup. I've made it several times. I enjoy using the leftovers from a crawfish or crab boil (potatoes, onion, garlic, corn, mushrooms, whatever). the seasoning from the vegetables does the work of seasoning and it is amazing!

Made this with a can of Ocean Crown Crab, used heavy cream in place of half and half and used canned corn. Both hubby and I loved this bisque. Served with garlic cheddar biscuits. Definitely restaurant quality.

The great thing about reviews is that you take out of it what you want.  Everyone has different tastes so adding things to spice it up is just fine.  My husband has got to be the pickiest soup/chowder/bisque eater you will ever meet.  He even asks for a sample of it at restaurants before ordering it (HOW EMBARRASSING).  I accidentally added smoked paprika thinking it was cayenne (I did add the cayenne after I realized what I'd done) and it added a nice touch to this already great recipe.  I made this recipe (except for my boo boo) exactly as it suggested and it is awesome just the way it is as far as I'm concerned (and my husband).   It is thick but not too thick where your spoon stands up in it.  If you want it thicker - make it thicker but try this recipe - you won't be disappointed.  Great flavor - didn't even need salt and pepper.  Thanks for sharing.

So versatile after reading suggestions of others. I did add some red peppers for color & used frozen corn for ease. Since we aren't lucky enough to live on the coasts where crab is fresh I had to resort to the phony stuff. I can only imagine how great using the real thing would be. At the prices they get here it better be served with real butter as an entree & not in soup. I like the idea of adding some potato also for a heavy soup come winter. Crumbling some bacon on top seems like a great idea also. The only thing I don't like is you have to puree & I don't do that just because of a bad experience so had to wait for hubby to get home so the soup could be finished.

I made my own cajun seasoning and that might be why the flavors seemed flat. So I added about half a teaspoon of good quality worcestershire sauce (as is called for in another recipe) and it fixed it. The soup was delicious and had a tiny kick (I halved the cayenne because my kids don't like spicy). I'll make it again.

Soup is excellent! I substituted the Cajun seasoning for Old Bay however. I also added diced potatoes and shrimp to make it a little more hearty! This has quickly become one of my favorites! Tons of flavor!!

This was very good. Definitely spicy. I only sprinkled the cayenne over the top because I was making for my kids and grandmother and it still had a kick! I added potatoes and celery, pureed all of the soup and stirred in some chopped tomatoes at the end with the crab. I also served with crumbled bacon on top. yum! Good with a crusty loaf of bread on a cool, damp winter night!

I thought the flavor of this bisque turned great. It had more heat than I anticipated so could probably cut the cayenne in half. I did mix 1/2 tsp old bay and 1/2 tsp of the cajun seasoning which seemed like a good balance. Like orher I chose to make a roux with the onions rather than mixing in the milk. I also increased the amount of butter to 5 tbsp and 5 tbsp flour to match. Changed the half n half to heavy cream because I had that on hand. I thought the texture of the bisque was good and there was plenty crab and crab flavor, maybe a little chunkier with crab than I imagine for a bisque. My wife and I were wuite happy with how it turned out and can see making this again in the future without a doubt.

I didn't have premade Cajun seasonings, so I had to put together my own. I used marjoram instead of oregano. The flour/milk mixture at the end thickens it perfectly! I'm going to make this one of my permanent favorites.

Second time making this, just awesome. Freezes well to portion out for extra meals. I used old bay seasoning and heavy cream in place of half and half and milk. Also I rendered pancetta and added it when adding crab.  Stretches the bisque and adds incredible flavor. Fresh crab is always better.

This is a tasty and easy soup to make. I did make a little change. Since my hubby doesn't like onions ,I substituted celery and instead of putting the hot stuff in the soup, I finished it with a little drizzle of chili infused oil.  Hit the spot and gave it just enough heat to balance the sweetness of the corn.  YUM!

Very tastey! I made a few changes just to use what i had on hand. I used frozen corn, did not have cajiun seasoning so just added a touch extra cayenne. We had left over grilled king crab legs so i used those (how can you go wrong there.) I also didnt have half and half so just omitted it and the consistency was great just had to simmer on low alittle longer to let it thicken. This will be a recipe i will keep around for anytime we splurge on king crab, since I used it the first time I don't think it would be the same with anything else!

After reading the reviews, I only added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper and added Old Bay instead of the Cajun seasoning. Also, I didn't have any half and half so I melted 1 tsp. of butter and added it to 1/2 cup of milk and used that in place of the half-and-half.  The soup tasted good and went well with a green salad for dinner.  My husband loved it!

I'm pretty  please with how it turned out but only because I made some changes.   I used 16 ounce clam juice  plus 32 ounce chicken stock.  I sautéed the leek with the onion.   Added diced red potatoes with the corn.  Puréed more of the soup. Then Added extra flour and cream.  I think it turned out pretty darn good because if my changes.

I used 8 oz claw meat and 8 oz lump crab.  Also added about 1/2 t. Shrimp and Crab boil.   1/2 t. creole/cajun seasoning and 1/2 Old Bay instead of all creole/cajun seasoning.  Didn't have fresh corn, so used the Birdseye Baby Sweet yellow and white corn.

This was a HUGE hit at my house and we will definitely make again!! So easy and so good!

Its a little spicier than i expected. I will probably substitute some of the spices with old bay next time. I also used 8oz clam juice and about 28oz chicken broth. Served mine with a dollop of sour cream and some cheeze. So good. I will make it again.

I made this last night for dinner using fresh corn on the cob &  Alaskan king crab meat. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning (in addition to the other spices) and used heavy whipping cream rather than half & half.  It was amazing!!!!! My husband, who is quite picky, said this was one of the best soups he has ever eaten...that's how good it was!  I will be making this again.

Gluten free version - I made this recipe gluten free by substituting the wheat flour for a gluten free "cup for cup" blend and it worked perfectly. Since it is only the two of us I made half the recipe, used 2 cans of crab instead of fresh and added some Old Bay seasoning. Hubby loved it and I am pretty sure I should have made the whole recipe because it is the kind of soup that will be better the next day and there is only enough for one of us for lunch!

This soup is very good with some modifications. If you like the bisque thicker and a couple of tablespoons of good quality instant potatoes. I also added some paprika to add some color.

Would not use both cayenne and Cajun seasoning again. Way too spicy and I like spicy!  Also thin. Tasty just the same. Would adjust those issues if I make it again

Omg. Incredible. I made my own Cajun seasoning (cumin, oregano, paprika, pepper) and it was not too spicy. I also used Mexican crema instead of half and half and it was so perfect and delicious.

I had only one can of chicken broth, so I used a quart of heavy cream in addition to the one can of broth.  I also added two pieces of very finely chopped celery and a small red potato very finely chopped; also added a tablespoon of dried parsley and paprika for color.

This recipe is awesome.   I thought I messed up, but whatever I did,  still worked.   I sautéed the onions and garlic first.   I followed the recipe after that,  but pureed 1 cup of half and half with the soup mixture and added 5 tsp. of flour after adding the pureed mixture.  Oh yeah, and I used imitation crab and 1 can of regular corn,  drained,  ane a can of crwam corn, and totally missed the bay leaves on the ingredients list.  It was kind of a mixed up jumble of a lot of reviews. My husband and I were both amazed at how well it turned out.

I double this recipe and it was incredible. Very tasty. I followed the recipe except I added a little cornstarch to thicken it a bit more. I also allowed to simmer in a crock pot for a few hours. It was a hit at a pot luck. Not a drop left at the end of the night. I will continue to make this. I used fresh corn and it really added to the flavor.

Man, I really didn't go for this.  It tasted to like crab-water with milk, honestly.  But after I tasted it and found it lacking I added 1/2 a lemon, squeezed, several dashes of hot sauce, and about 6 slices of smoked provolone.  THEN it was a good soup.

This is really a fantastic soup and relatively easy to make.  We tweaked it a little for our own tastes (more garlic, more onion, more butter, more seasonings), which is what prevented us from giving it five stars.  We tried it with imitation crab (great), leftover baked cod (excellent), and we think it would be awesome with shrimp.

This was awesome! I threw in a chopped cooked potato and celery to make it more hearty. I also used all skim milk instead of the half and half, to cut calories and it was still very thick. This recipe is a keeper!

this soup was delicious! However, I found it to be thinner than what I pictured for a bisque....probably because I used frozen corn and 46 instead of 42 oz of broth though. i wound up blending about half of the soup in my bullet to give it more preferable consistancy. I also cooked and chopped up about a dozen jumbo shrimp which I added along with the crabmeat, and I'm glad i did!

Amazing. This is one of my children's favorite food. I don't enjoy cooking very much, but this turned out great!! I used steam fresh corn and no onions, and threw it all in the crock pot. So easy. Will never buy it a restaurant again!

I liked this recipe, I did add in cooked potatoes, and it made it so good. The only thing I would say, is that it has a kick to it, with the cajun or pepper, so follow the recipe if you like that added hot kick. As for the potatoes, I cut them up in cubes, boiled them in water until they were cooked, drained the water and added to the soup....perfection.

It tasted great but it wasn't a bisque.  I live in New Orleans and every bisque I've ever had is thick, not as much as a chowder, but certainly doesn't run off the spoon like water.  And yes I followed the recipe including the flour part.  I see someone commented that they adjusted using heavy whipping cream and more flour, maybe that would have done it.  Otherwise the flavor was great.

Made as written knowing that the consistency would be thinner like a bisque rather than a chowder or stew.  Fresh corn and crab flavors were incredible.  Actually, I did only add half the cayenne just in case, and it was the perfect spiciness for us.  Have crusty bread on hand for dunking, and sprinkle green onions and parm on top for even more flavor.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  Update:  I made a second time substituting Old Bay Seasoning for the cajun and cayenne as another suggested.  It is much more flavorful as originally written.  If substituting Old Bay, it needs a lot more than 1.5 tsp for the kick.

This recipe was a great start for my now "world famous" Crab Bisque.  I took a lot of advice from the comments and added tomato paste and switched the half and half and milk to full cups of heavy whipping cream.  I also repalced the cayenne and cajun spices with Old Bay and finish with a flourish of white wine.

I just made this. Like others I used canned sweet corn. I used whipping cream instead of half and half. I used more crab meat than called for. I used the Old Bay instead of cajun. And for the real kicker, I used a half of a butternut squash. It is the best soup I have made.

Loved this! Of course, I made a couple of changes. Instead of cooking the onion in butter, I threw in one strip of bacon and cooked it in the bacon fat. I didn't have any stock around so I used a "Tuscany" broth that was seasoned with thyme, rosemary and basil. (While I don't think it was necessary to make the bisque tasty, it made for a really good broth before adding the dairy and flour that I'll definitely use again.) Lastly, I used frozen corn to save time and it worked well. My kids loved it and requested it become a regular in our dinner rotation.

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted half and half for the whole milk (1 cup of half and half).  My husband loved it and so did I.  Serve it with warm French bread.

Just served this to a dinner party and everyone LOVED it, even my 3 year old. It has a little kick to it, which was surprising and a great addition. Finding fresh lump crab can be challenging, unfortunately. I got ours in 5 oz tins at Whole Foods and each tin was $13 so this is expensive. One more tip: I used a hand blender and blended up the soup a little extra when it was all together in the pot at the end (but before adding the crab!). I felt like the corn and onion was a little too chunky, and I reduced the chunkiness a bit. Perhaps the best dish I have EVER made.

We loved it!!!!  I trap my own crab here on the West Coast and we will definitely put this recipe on the rotating circuit!!  I'm surprised nobody mentioned the spicy heat - really liked it but it wouldn't be to everyone's taste.  For the faint of heart I would recommend 1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne for a tamer version.  AWESOME!!!

I had a can of claw crab meat & needed to make a meal with what I had on hand. This was very yummy! Since I needed to use what I had, I substituted white wine for one can of chicken broth, used Old Bay in place of the cayenne & cajon seasonings, and frozen corn kernels. I also cooked some bacon to crumble over the bowls. I have friends stopping by at lunchtime tomorrow & plan to serve the leftovers. Good stuff!

awesome recipe! my bf doesn't usually like soup but he had second helpings of this one :) i used canned corn instead of fresh, and used 1/2 old bay and 1/2 cajun seasoning.
