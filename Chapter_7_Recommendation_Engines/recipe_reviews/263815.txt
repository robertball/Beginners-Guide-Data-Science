I happened to have the dashi broth powder and miso paste on hand (that I had bought to make miso soup, also on this site), so when I saw that this recipe that also used those ingredients, I knew I had to make it! I was happy to find the nutritional yeast in the bulk section of Whole Foods, and bought only a little bit, as it's not something that I've used before, and wasn't sure if I'd like it! I scaled this to 3 servings. I also pre-cooked my rice noodles for a bit, as the type I was using said to boil for 6 minutes, so I wanted to be sure they were cooked. I added the dashi broth powder to the boiling water while still on the stove, and whisked in the eggs, while it was still boiling, then poured the broth over the noodles and veggies in the bowls. My husband and I both loved this! I was in such a hurry to take a picture before it got cold, that I ALMOST forgot to add the soy sauce/miso paste/sesame oil mixture on top! Will be making this one again! Thanks Buckwheat Queen!

This is fantastic. If miso and nutritional flakes are not things you normally have on hand, it's worth changing that just to be able to whip this up on demand. Great use for leftover chicken.

I Quadrupled the recipe and made it in a big bowl. Used chicken broth and miso paste concentrate. Loved it! Thanks for the recipe!
