I've never had a pasta salad without the dressing being mayo based, oil/vinegar based, or ranch salad dressing based. This was a very nice change!! I couldn't find the wacky mac pasta at Meijer so I used green and orange colored pasta and corkscrew mixed together. I used green onion in place of the red onion and also added orange bell pepper with the red and yellow. This was even better the next day. The honey mustard I used was Kraft. I would make again!!
