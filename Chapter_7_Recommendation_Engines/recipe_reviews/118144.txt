Yum!  This is really good.  My son who will turn up his nose at broccoli will eat this and take seconds.  I put in about a half cup chopped onions also and top it with bread crumbs and a few dots of butter.  It is scrumptious!  Thanks

I made this tonight with just a few slight modifications.  I already had some cooked chicken frozen in the freezer.  So I used that instead of the raw chicken.  I also used more like 3/4 c. of macaroni.  I used about 1 cup of cheese.  I substituted white cooking wine for the chicken broth.  The last 20 minutes of baking, I put some crushed Ritz crackers on top and drizzled it with melted butter.
It came out DELICIOUS!  I came dangerously close to licking the dish clean!

The beauty of the recipe is that you don't have to precook anything! I substituted milk for the chicken broth. Turned out great- Family loves it!!!

TOTAL WINNER!  My family L-O-V-E-D this dish.  I tripled the recipe & used a 9x13.  I didn't change any of the ingrediants, except for adding greek seasoning to the cubed meat--b/c I put that into any dish I can.  The bake time had to be increased a bit.  The 1st 30 mins I covered the pan, only b/c some thought the noodles/meat didn't cook through.  I stirred it after a 2nd 30 mins (it was getting 'crusty' on the bottom of the pan, mixing helped to break it up) then baked about an add'l 15 minutes.  OOHHHHH SOOO GOOD!  Just served w/ rolls, making for a VERY hardy meal.  (Which is another example of how good it was: my husband is a man that thinks that every meal requires multiple sides, even filling/hardy dishes that most would think is a meal in itself needs a seperate veg., a salad of sort etc.  but was completely content w/ only this & a single roll.  That almost never happens.  He couldn't stop raving.)

I love this recipe, I don't really measure anything when I make it, and add whatever I have around the house and it always turns out great! I love that I don't have to pre-cook any of it!

This was great, fast and easy.  The chicken was very moist.  I used white wine (1/2 cup) instead of the chicken broth and fresh broccoli as that's what I had on hand.  I also added a healthy sprinkle of crushed red pepper.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

I made this twice in the past 10 days -- it is so good, easy, and with readily available items from the fridge and pantry. I did add a half-cup of diced onion and a quarter cup of diced red bell pepper, both of which added some good flavor and also color. Kudos on this recipe!

This is my "go-to" recipe when I need to fix something nutritious in a hurry that my kids LOVE!  I love the fact that you can just mix up the ingredients in one pan and you don't have to separately brown the chicken before baking.  I can even get away with adding less chicken and more broccoli and my family still can't get enough.  Thanks for the recipe!

I like this meal I changed the recipe up a little.  I wanted to make enough for six people.  That calls for 3 cans of cream of chicken soup.  I used 2 cream of chicken soups and 1 cream of cheese and broccli soup cause that was what I had on hand.  I also added about 3/4 cup of parmesean cheese...just because I like it.  I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt and cajon seasoning...just because I like it.  My dish was probably more cheesy then the original recipe but I liked it that way.  Next time I will definitely use more macaroni.

Thank you. An "ingredients search" when I was in a hurry led me to this wonderful meal, especially good on a cold night of freezing rain.  Three times I heard "This is good." I am sharing it with my daughter who prefers to work-out before dinner but is then eager to eat.

This was so good and got rave reviews. I needed to feed six and I didn't have cream of chicken so I went with cream of mushroom family size and added a little milk. I also added peas and a small diced onion. This recipe is a keeper.

I'm giving this a 5 because it was gone! My 4 year old had 4 helpings! BUT please enter recipes with a minimum of 4 servings. Who makes something for just 2 servings? Even if you're single, you make more and freeze it. I didn't realize this until I was into the cooking and had to scramble at the last minute.

This was really tasty and easy.  I had a bit of a problem getting the pasta on the top of the dish to cook. Maybe next time I'll cover it with some foil for part of the cooking time.

I would not make just 2 servings. I made 6 servings and altered it slightly. I used 2 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken (10.5oz). I also doubled the amount of pepper and garlic powder. This turned out well. I love that it can all just be thrown into a bowl and be cooked. Everything was done after 1.5 hours of cooking. I added bread crumbs and another 1/2c of cheddar cheese to the top of it. We loved it.

This dish was just okay for me.  I thought it could use a little more flavor or it seemed to just be missing something.  I think it would be great with some crushed Ritz crackers/melted butter on top..maybe a little more cheese.  I already had some cooked chicken and I used that, instead of the raw chicken.  That worked out just fine.  I will make this again, but jazz it up with some more flavor.  Thank you for the recipe!

i kept to the recipe as much as i could since i havent ever made a casserole where you dont precook your noodles. i didnt have the elbows so i used egg noodles and no cream of soups in the house so i measured out 11 ounces of sour cream and used that instead i also added about 1/4 cup of chopped onion i had to use up and i used less cheese. i dont think my changes affected the outcome of the recipe really. this was good. it needed something else. maybe a little franks hot sauce or some dry mustard? i do like that you dont cook the pasta first thats a real time saver. thanks

This was delicious and easy!  The whole family loved it!!  I didn't have chicken, and when I did a search for broccoli and cream of chicken soup, this came up.  I added alot more broccoli and alot more macaroni.  5 Stars!  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe, Heather!

This was yummy and easy! A great base recipe to modify with what you have or what you like. I increased the amount of pasta, probably closer to a cup, but I also used bigger noodles (rotini). I used skim milk instead of chicken broth. I was a little more liberal with the cheese! Also, as suggested by some others, at the end of the baking time I took it out, crushed some Ritz crackers on top, and sprinkled it with some more cheese, then baked it for another 10 minutes. I hate broccoli but I know it is good for me, so I'm always looking for ways to make it work!

Made it for the first time tonight.  I was very surprised that I didn't have to cook anything prior to putting it in the oven.  I doubled the recipe, put it in a 13 x 9 pan, and cooked it for the same amount of time.  I used a whole can of chicken broth, which was only slightly more than what the recipe called for and it didn't seem to affect the results.  My boys seemed to like it.  I liked that it was easy.

I LOVE this. One of my favorites. I use chopped broccoli instead of florets because it's easier to eat. I also add in an extra handful of cheese at the end because we are cheese lovers.

Sorry, I was very disappointed in this recipe. I thought it was bland and I followed the recipe exactly. My only thought on this is that there are casserole people and non-casserole people. I did not grow up eating them, but my husband did, so I try to appease him now and then. This is one that both of us did not like.

To my surprise, my husband, the casserole hater, was crazy about this!  Got an unsolicited, "This is DELICIOUS!" out of him last night!  Printed it to be sure I could make it again.  Good job on the creation of this one, Heather!

This really was easy! Following reviews here I improvised seasoning: curry powder and coriander this time, 1/2 mushroom soup and 1/2 milk, it's hard to go wrong here. Use with whatever's in the house when you don't want to brown chicken first. Thanks Heather!

I also tripled the recipe (except for the vegetables, b/c i only had 1 bag of frozen green beans instead of broccoli) and baked in a 9 x 13. followed others' sugg. cooking time of 1 hr and 15 min and it was great. Also took others' suggestions and put crushed crutons and paremsan cheese on top and drizzled with a little butter for last 30 min. very good.  It was a little watery on the bottom with that much chicken broth, next time I will use less. But it still tasted good and macaroni was done.

I also made this for more people (6).  I did 4 chicken breast. 5 cups fresh broccoli. 2 cups shell noodles, 2 cups shredded cheese, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, 2 c cups chicken broth, 1/2 cup milk,  3/4 tsp minced garlic, pepper and chili powder.  I baked 30 mins covered at 400 then 20 mins at 350.  Turned out perfect.  My kids loved it.

This is the first recipe I've ever given 1 star to.  My DH, who loves food, took one bite and told me to throw the rest away.  I did use cream of mushroom soup vs cream of chicken, but others used the mushroom soup and still enjoyed it.  The consistency was runny and the taste was bland.

This has been a staple in my dinner menus for months now.  I use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and I add everything from mushrooms, zucchini, and even corn kernels.  It's always just a little bit different, but always tastes great - my husband loves it and it's SO EASY!  Thanks to Heather for this great recipe!

This was very good. It was great to be able to just throw everything together and have it bake slowly. I followed the recipe exactly; just doubled it. Great leftovers, too. Thanks for sharing!

This was SO good and very easy to put together.  I actually doubled everything to make enough for 4 servings and I found that I had to cook it a little longer until the macaroni was tender but it turned out really good.

This was super easy to prepare and good for a weeknight dinner, but I thought it could use a little more flavor. Next time I'll probably increase the cheddar cheese and garlic and maybe throw in some peas or carrots or something. All in all, though, it's a great starting point. Thanks!

Very good. Flavors were nice. The only thing I did different was to add some minced dried onion and about 1/2 cup cream. Kids loved it too!!

I liked this!  It was very easy to make and, just the thing to pull together when you don't have alot of time to prepare.  I tripled the recipe and ended up with 8 servings.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I didn't have brocolli, so I used a bag of mixed brocolli, cauliflower and carrots.  Also, I used only one can of broth and made up the difference with water.  It still tasted great.  If I make any change next time, I might use cream of celery soup - just because I like it better.

Excellent recipe! It must have a large "margin of error" because I used Campbells cheddar cheese (didn't have real cheese), used cream of asparagus, cream of mushroom, and cream of chicken along with chicken broth. I also doubled the recipe, so i added nearly 2 cups of elbows included about .5 cup of Parmesan cheese. I added crushed crackers with melted butter the last 10 mins or so of cooking. My picky eaters: wife, 16, 10, and 7 year old all claimed the meal was a "keeper". Every one had seconds, some thirds! It was very good and hearty. Will make this easy, tasty recipe again.

Definitely use the white wine in place of the chicken broth, double the cheese, and add some crushed red pepper and onion.  Very easy and very good.

I love making this. It's so easy! I will use more pasta next time, and maybe more broccoli, but other than that, it's wonderful the way it is!
