This is my husband's favorite salad that has to be made at every holiday gathering or family get together. This is my exact recipe I've been making for years--it's the perfect way to make Watergate Salad. I got it off the back of a marshmallow bag. Sometimes I swap walnuts for the pecans, and sometimes I put a little coconut. (Exactly the same as the recipe from Dole.)

This was pretty good. Very sweet. We could only eat a little at a time.

Super sweet. Like dessert instead of salad. Didn't go with turkey dinner AT ALL!  Better than a jello salad, but that's the best I can say.

This is my son's favorite dessert.  Required for all family get-togethers.  I didn't make any changes - perfect just as written.

I have made this many times over the years.  It's still a favorite of my grown daughters.  I have made a lower calorie (less sweet) version by using lite whipped topping, and sugar free pistachio pudding.  The flavor is still there, but it isn't quite as sweet.
