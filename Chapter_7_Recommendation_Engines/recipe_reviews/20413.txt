I was really excited to try this one. With some minor adjustments this can be a fabulous recipe. I read several ratings first and agree with several of the suggestions: Using less water is a MUST. 3/4 Cup is plenty. If you LOVE wings you need to use more hot sauce, otherwise it doesn't taste like buffalo wings. I used 6 Tbs and next time I'll use even more. I used "Frank's Red Hot" and since it's a vinegar based hot sauce, there's no need to use any cider vinegar. I also used 1 1/2 lbs of chicken and my husband feels that it still could use more, so next time I'll try 2 lbs. Other changes were minor: no peppers or mushrooms, whole wheat noodles, and gorgonzola instead of bleu cheese. Other ratings suggested using celery (a wing staple) and jalapenos - I'll definitely give both of these a try. I'm looking forward to trying this one again.

This was really good, however, I made a few significant changes that I think really contributed to the recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added fresh parsley in the ricotta mixture.  Instead of four cups of spaghetti sauce I used 2 cups mixed with 2 cups of alfredo sauce.  I used 1/4 hot sauce to give it way more of that buffalo wing taste.  I also sprinkled the blue cheese on top of all the ricotta layers as well as the top.

TREMENDOUS!
I made it a few weeks ago and forgot to submit a review.
My wife and I thought it was awesome.
The only problem was the onion was too crunchy...so we picked them out as we ate. Next time I'll either not use an onion or I'll cook the onion beforehand to get it tender.
Other than that...it was AWESOME.
Great, creative recipe.
I love lasagna...and I REALLY love Chicken wings...so this was perfect for me.

Oh and I added a LOT more Hot sauce than recommended...but that's just me. I'm a hot sauce addict. I use "Frank's Red Hot" It's Hot...but not overpwhelming and lethal. It doesn't overpower the food.
2 tablespoons definetely wasn't enough.
So if you like Hot sauce in general...I suggest adding more to this recipe. If not then just stick to the original formula.

I tried this recipe out once and wasnt too impressed but it did give me a base to start with. Changes are below:  •1 pound Tyson’s Buffalo Chicken Tenders cut up into small bite size pieces. •2 cups spaghetti sauce  •1 cup tomato paste •1 Cup Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce •No Vinagar  •3/4 cups water  •1 teaspoon garlic powder  •1 small onion, chopped  •1 small green bell pepper, chopped   •1 egg, beaten  •1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese  •12 uncooked lasagna noodles  •4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese   Instead of following the baking instuctions from this recipe, I followed the baking instructions from the Lasagna box as well. Everything else stayed the same as far as the prep work.

Everybody loved it!!! I did a few adjustments. I shredded instead of diced the chicken. Added the whole bottle of hot sauce cuz we couldn't taste the 2 tbls. I don't eat mushrooms or onions so I did add celery. I omitted the vinegar and really could do without the water. I boiled the noodles first a little bit so I wouldn't have to bake for 70 mins. I baked it for 30... Overall it was Yummy and even my picky Brother In-law loved it.

A co-worker made this a few weeks ago and it smelled wonderful.  I asked her how to make it and she said she got the recipe off Allrecipes.  I made this last week and it was amazing!  I did add more hot sauce to this as most said, a full cup to be exact.  I also omitted the green peppers and mushrooms.  Definitely a keeper!

WOW!  this was just what i was looking for - i typed in a few ingredients i had and this came up!  I did make a number of changes, following advice from others on here (less water, more hot sauce, left out vinegar, used cottage cheese not ricotta, etc.).  SO good!  My fiance is going to love this!

Yummy!  Used 2 lbs of chicken, and I think it came out just right.  Used almost 1/2 c. Frank's Buffalo sauce, and it wasn't too much.  Used 1/2 tomato and 1/2 alfredo sauce, and 1/2 mozzerella and 1/2 cheddar cheese.  Also added close to 8 oz. blue cheese because I like it so much.  The lasagna was delicious!!!  I will definitely make it again!

I made changes recommended by previous reviewers: increased the amount of chicken, doubled the hot sauce to 4 T, decreased the water to 1/2 cup, omitted the bell pepper and substituted 2 diced celery stalks.  To prevent the onion and celery from being crunchy, I sauteed them together in a bit of olive oil.  I omitted the blue cheese due to personal preference.  Instead of 12 lasagne noodles, I needed 15 (5 per layer) to fully cover the pan (4 lengthwise, 1 crosswise for full coverage). I found that I could use 2 cups of sauce in between layers, rather than the 1 1/2 cups as stated. With 4 T. of hot sauce, it had a bit of tangy-ness to it but was not overly intense. Both my hubby and I enjoyed this with these modifications.  A nice change from standard lasagne.

I loved this recipe.  I gave samples away at work and everyone that tried it loved it.  Of course you have to like Blue Cheese.  If you don't, it's a great lasagna without the Blue Cheese.  Just leave off the last step or use a different cheese.  Best lasagna I ever tasted!

so i made a ginormous pan of this for a bridal shower today, crossing my fingers it was going to be excellent---and it was!  i did admittedly change it - i subbed alfredo sauce for the tomato sauce - but used the basic idea for the lasanga and used the same cheeses as the recipe calls for.  if i made it again, i'd keep the alfredo - it just doesn't seem like it would be right to make it with tomato suace.  i would also like to try it with blue cheese next time too.  thank you for a fabulous entree that completely disappeared at the shower!!

This is absolutely a great recipe, I altered it with red instead of green peppers, balsamic wine vinegar instead of apple cider, 2 cups buffalo wing sauce, 2 cups spaghetti sauce instead of 4 cups spaghetti sauce, and a red onion instead of a regular yellow one. In addition, I'd say to put one cup of water instead of 1.5 cups in order to let the sauce be thicker, that way the lasagna has more flavor. I'd recommend it to anyone and it definitely has become a favorite instantly.

Ok, so I dumped the veggies, the water and the vinegar from the recipe and used Frank's Hot Sauce instead, and about a half a bottle of that in the sauce.  The taste was good, spicy in the right way, very tasty, but I think I would add the water back, at least some of it, it was a little too dry for my liking.  Otherwise, it was a crowd pleaser.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!!  We love chicken wings with blue cheese and this was the taste that came through in this lasagna.  Easy to make and the leftovers were just as good, if not better, than the first serving - the tastes get a chance to blend a little.  So yummy!  The only thing that we did different is use a little larger lasagna pan and so needed more lasagna noodles but it didn't affect any of the other instructions.  Great recipe!!

Amazing! You can buffalo anything! 
I only had 3 cups of sauce and I forgot the mushrooms. I didn't add very much water, but I added about a cup of franks sauce. 
I think next time I will add fresh mushrooms and celery.

This dish was delicious!   I made a few changes and would make a few more next time... I used 1 cup of water because I used homemade pasta sauce and it's generally more watery than commercial canned sauce.  I sauteed the veggies until crisp-tender and they were cooked perfectly when it was done (I used fresh mushrooms and added celery).  The celery was great in it, but I felt like with it in there, the green pepper was out of place.  I'd probably do it without mushrooms too, to taste more like a wing next time.
Also, I used 3 1/2 cups pasta sauce and 1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce, then cut out the vinegar.  It was a little spicy without being crazy hot.  Also, instead of ricotta, I put as much cottage cheese in the blender.
Delish!  :)

Very good!  Did try other user suggestions - 2c. spag sauce, 2 c. alfredo, upped hot sauce to 1/4 cup and only used 1/2 cup water.  Made up the night before and put in fridge until ready to bake, increased baking time by 10 mintes and it was perfect!  Very good and a nice change from regular lasagna!

Definitely one of THE best lasagnas I've ever made!! ;)  The only thing I would suggest is to use A LOT more hot sauce I put in 8 Tablespoons and it gave it just the right kick, but then again my family and I enjoy our food spicy! :)

This is a pretty good base recipe for buffalo chicken lasagna. I made many changes to it, to suit my tastes. My suggestion is to add some ranch dressing powder to the ricotta cheese to give it a ranch flavor.

This was really yummy, but I put a LOT more red hot sauce in it.  I'm pretty sure I had between 1/3 and 1/2 cup of it and I probably could have added more.  A keeper!

So good! A terrific combination of two of my husband's favorites - buffalo wings and lasagna! I doubled the vinegar and hot sauce for extra zip - next time I will add even more. I shredded the chicken (instead of dicedcubed). Also, I used fat free cottage cheese as that's all I had on hand, and it was STILL great! We'll definitely make this again.

I really liked this recipe.  I followed it almost exactly, but with a few modifications because I was out of some ingredients.  I used 3 cups of sauce, so I added a can of (drained) canned tomatoes.  I was also out of apple cider vinegar, so I used regular white vinegar.  I omitted the peppers and mushrooms as I dislike both of them.

I didn't find the recipe runny at all.  There definitely wasn't enough heat for me.  Next time I will increase the hot sauce amount, but I will follow the rest of it.  Very good recipe.

I should have read the reviews before making this.  Mine was on the watery side as well.  Otherwise, the taste was awesome!  I agree, more hot sauce would give it more of a "buffalo wing" flavor.  I loved the blue cheese on top.  I also used fresh mushrooms.  I was very hungry and didn't want to wait for it to bake so long, so I cooked the lasagna noodles & only used 1 cup of water, thinking it wouldn't need so much since the noodles wouldn't be absorbing the water.  I was correct, and I would probably use no water in the future if I precook the noodles.  Excellent twist on lasagna!!  Boyfriend loved too!

Edited to add: I made again and used 3 tablespoons hot sauce in my "halved" version in 8x8 pan.  PERFECT!

I loved this recipe, though i made a few changes. I crocked the spaghetti sauce, hot sauce and several different types of cheese with the chicken for most of the day. my hubby has requested to have this at least once every other week he liked it so much.

This was pretty good. I added 1/3 cup buffalo sauce and I still could barely taste it, maybe next time I'll add even more. Loved the blue cheese topping!

I really like this recipie. I altered it a bit because I like my food with a little more flavor. Replaced chopped jalepenos for the chopped green pepper, added more hot sauce, and substituted gorganzola for blue cheese. 

Made it for a potluck and everyone like it. 
(Didnt freeze very well though)

I'm not sure where my review for this went. We really liked this, or I did anyway, DH didn't like bell peppers in his "buffalo stuff" but he's a weirdo. I will absolutely make this again, but using celery and grated carrots in place of the bell pepper (for DH's sake, not because I think it needs changed). I no longer recall if I made any special adjustments but I know I left out the mushrooms! Thanks for sharing!

It came out rather soupy. I was rather disappointed, but it did have a good flavor. I considered it a casserole, instead of lasagna. Next time I will cut the water sharply.

This recipe was great with a few changes! I added two diced celery stalks, a heaping tbs minced garlic, as well as a diced red pepper to the green pepper and onion.  I sauteed all the veggies in a little buffalo wing sauce (Frank's Red Hot) until just tender. Mixed those in with the Chicken, and 1 jar (about 3 cups) of Vodka Sauce, and big bottle of Franks Red Hot Sauce, garlic powder, a little cayenne pepper, salt and fresh ground black pepper. I also substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta, because it's what I had on hand. I used Rice lasagna noodles to make it Gluten free, also thoughts of using potatoes in plase of the noodles too, will probably try next time! But came out great, my boyfirend and roommate were skeptical, but they both loved it!  Served it with some sauteed spinach :) Hope this helps!

I have a very picky husband, and I got a good review from him for a thumbs up on this recipe.  He does not like lasagna, but loved this, because he loves wings.  I ommited the onion, green pepper and blue cheese and ricotta cheese, so this basic recipe that I had was a hit.  Oh, and added more hot sauce to give it more of a kick.  A good repeat recipe for us.

This recipe tasted very good although i had to make some adjustments. So of the steps seemed out of order, such as when to put in the ricotta. It is much easier to spread ricotta on the noodle. Also the portions of sauce and cheese for each layer werecway out of proportion. I would recommend dividing it evenly. Other than that the final product and taste was great and it is an easy make.

I omitted the water as I didn't want it to be too watery, plus I had already added a TON of hot sauce which thinned out the spag sauce quite a bit. I omitted the green bell pepper, and used fresh mushrooms. This turned out great - hearty and filling, with good buffalo wing flavor. Thanks!

I will never make again and never serve to company.  My fiance and I were extremely disappointed.  Does not taste at all like buffalo wings, more like a runny chicken hot sauce lasagna!

Yum. We love buffalo wings, so this was a fun change from regular lasagna! I used a little more than the recommended hot sauce, and instead of regular hot sauce, I used a hot wing restaurant's "Spicy Garlic" wing sauce and it was great. After reading other recommendations, I reduced the amount of water to about 3/4 cup. Next time I'll probably use about 1/2 cup water as it was a bit watery.

I really wanted to like this recipe, as I love both lasagna and buffalo chicken. I probably did something wrong, but the sauce seemed a little watery. I also thought that the combination of ingredients just wasn't appealing. I wonder if a white sauce instead of red might work better?

This was excellent! I left out the green pepper and added one extra tablespoon of hot sauce.  I had to eat it with a large glass of milk!  This will definitely be a recurring meal in our house.

Wasn't a big fan and neither was my husband who enjoys almost anything.  Without the bleu cheese, which we scraped off because it was just too strong, it was rather bland.  we were disappointed by the whole thing.  won't make it again.

OK, like all the rest of you, I looked at this recipe and said, "What a strange combination!"  Hot sauce and vinegar!  Well, it's fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!!  I just took it out of the oven, because I cooked it a night ahead because I didn't think it would work out.  WRONG!  Don't be fooled, you WILL have enough sauce to cover all the dry noodles, very thinly.  Comes out perfect!

Very very delicious - and the guests were simply awed.  I mixed spinach in with the ricotta cheese and that was a nice touch.  Next time I make it, I will probably disregard the green pepper, and use fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I'd also add some fresh garlic...but on the whole, a super recipe!

Fabulous recipe that is easy to prepare and delicious.  I don't care for the peppers, so I left them out.  The blue cheese adds an extra zip to the taste.  Try grilling the chicken and then shredding it for an extra depth of flavor.  The best thing about this dish is that it tastes just as fabulous when leftover...if it makes it that far!  Great for big dinner parties or large families.

Because I used spaghetti squash instead of uncooked lasa noodles I needed to cut back on a lot of the liquid.   I used only 2 1/2 cups of a zesty spaghetti sauce and left out the water.  I also used fat free cottage cheese instead of ricotta, doubled the hot sauce and cut the mozzarella in half (personal preference).  So flavorful and so healthy!

I rated this 5 stars, because with a few changes to suit our taste I know it will be a regular on our menu. I did cut the water back to 3/4 c like other suggested, but I would use 1.5 lb chicken breast cubed small, 4.5 to 5 c of spaghetti sauce. 3 to 4 tbs of hot sauce, 3 cups of cheese, and a 5 oz pkg of blue cheese on top.  Thank you for submitting!

this was good in an unconventional way.. i'm a huge fan of hot wings so i wanted to give this a try.. i loosely followed the recipe.. using grilled salt and pepper chicken thighs, a 24 oz can of hunt's traditional pasta sauce, and 1/2 cup franks red hot.. i left out the vinegar, water, onion, and bell pepper.. and used fresh mushrooms that i sauteed.. i omitted the egg/ricotta mixture b/c i'm lactose intolerant and added blue cheese and mozz to each layer.. i'm sure i added a lot more than 3/4 blue cheese (i love the stuff!).. the taste test went well but i think i might garnish with a bit more franks.. ty so much for the recipe

The Italian ingredients way overpowered the buffalo. 

So a few suggestions:

First, Reduce the amount of spaghetti sauce. Instead of just a little vinegar and franks, whip up a batch of wing sauce to replace the spaghetti sauce you take out.  And to echo everyone else- 3/4 cup water at most.

Second, more blue cheese. Lots more. I would get two containers. One for the top and one for the inside. Especially if you're increasing the buff sauce.

Third, ditch the bell pepper. Go with some jalapeño, or for the brave- pick your favorite power pepper. We will be exploring habanero next time. The jalapeño was not as hot as you'd think, thanks to the mushrooms/cheese/pasta. 

Finally, we used ground chicken. It was a great short cut. 

This recipe is a great start to some awesome fusion.

Surprisingly delicious!  I used more hot sauce based on another review and it was great!  My boyfriend finished all of the leftovers within a couple of days.

I was kinda a lil nervous to make this but after words we ate it we were truly amazing!! It was so good!!! Only thing we did different was added a little more spaghetti sauce and more hot sauce! Very Delish!

This was ok.  Like many others I omitted the water and doubled or tripled the hot sauce since I like some heat.  It was very disappointing as the "buffalo chicken" flavor was barely noticable.  The blue cheese was a yummy twist though.  I made it for company and overall, none of the adults were impressed with the flavor.  Not bad, just  not great.  However, my two year old was a huge fan, even licked his plate!

This was and excellent take on lasagna. I read other reviews and put hardly no water in it and also used thick wing sauce instead of hot sauce. The product came out thick and great tasting.

I substituted the lasagna noodles for Broccoli and Sausage Cavatelli from this site (trying to make leftovers different). I added fresh thyme to the ricotta cheese mixture as well. I should have cooked this a bit longer because of the moisture of the dish, but we were hungry! Thanks for the recipe. I used smoked chicken in this as well.

I did not like this recipe at all.  I was so excited to make it as my husband and I both love hot wings and we threw almost all of it away.  The combination is terrible.  I even omitted the water and it was still very runny.

This was absolutely amazing.  I was worried at first with the amount of hot pepper sauce, but even I could handle the spiciness of it, now mind you it really did kick up a notch on the left overs, which warm up amazing.  I sent some home with my daughter and she is not even a fan of chicken wings, but loved this.  We do not like bleu cheese so I left it off and did not even miss it.

This was good. I halved it and put it into an 8x8 and used sauteed celery (what goes best with hot wings?) instead of onion and green pepper.  I probably could've used more hot sauce (I used 2 1/2 T) and cheese.  I omitted the blue cheese, too.

This was great!  We love hot sauce so we added more than the recipe called for, and left of the ricotta cheese.  It was great, and because my husband doesn't love lasagna, the ricotta cheese omission made it even better for him!  I also used parmesan cheese in place of the bleu cheese and it was really good.  It reheated well the next day as well.

The lasagna was OK, but did not taste like buffalo chicken at all.  It tasted like chicken lasagna with some heat...I used Emil's hot sauce and a lot of it, but was still disappointed.  I will not try it again.

If you love wings you should try this. I simplified it by using pasta shells, instead of going all out with the lasagna. I also omitted the ricotta (which I'm not a fan of) and sauteed the onions and peppers first. Yum.

It was good but not what I expected at all. I think it needed less water maybe
