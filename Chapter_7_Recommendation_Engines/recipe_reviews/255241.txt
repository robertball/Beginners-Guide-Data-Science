I followed the recipe with the only change being I made it in my instant pot. I saut√©ed the sausage, added the onion, broth, seasonings and then added the sirloin. If you're adding soy sauce you don't need salt. I did add mushrooms as the submitter suggested could be done. I cooked it on high for 20 minutes. I would not call this the best at all. It was rather bland.
