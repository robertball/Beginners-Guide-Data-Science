Very spicy and a lot thicker than the one I eat at Japanese steak houses. Not a bad recipe though especially if you like things extra spicy!

I omitted the mirin as I didn't have any, and used finely diced fresh onion instead of dried. With a a pinch of sesame seeds and some sliced green onions sprinkled on top, this was a pretty and delicious meal. Well worth the effort. My only minor complaint is that it's kinda stunk out my kitchen. Oh well. Thanks!

Against my better judgement I made as written and wish that I would have went with my first instinct.  There are a lot of potent ingredients going on here with the curry, turmeric, cayenne, and sesame oil. They all seemed to be fighting to steal the show with curry coming in as the winner.  It completely overwhelmed to the point it gave the shrimp a bitter taste. I think this recipe has potential but the spices need scaled way back and I do mean WAY back.
