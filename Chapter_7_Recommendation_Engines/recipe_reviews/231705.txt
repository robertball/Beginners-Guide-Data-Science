Absolutely Delicious!!!! I did not use mushroom soup and I added broccoli. My family loved it.

This would be a nice way to use leftover ham (and potatoes and carrots!).  Medium wasn't cutting it for browning the ham for me, so I had to use high heat.  It took about 50-60 minutes, total cook time (I'd had all of the prep done ahead of time).  I wasn't a fan of the cream of mushroom soup, but I really liked the ham browned in butter/brown sugar (how could you not?!).  THANKS for the recipe!
