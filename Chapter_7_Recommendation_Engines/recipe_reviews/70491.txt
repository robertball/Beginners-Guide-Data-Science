Other than the cilantro which Hubs had no problems with me omitting, I stuck to the ingredients list exactly using a mix of red and green bell peppers.  It was the technique I modified.   I cut the bacon into chunky dice.  I couldn't see trying to cook the vegetables and then the chicken efficiently together with already crisp-cooked strips of bacon.  So I cooked the bacon separately.  Removed some of the grease.  Added in the vegetables and cooked then till crisp/tender.  I had earlier mixed up the chicken strips with the fajita seasoning (to taste), a little water, fresh lime juice and a little vegetable oil.  Once the vegetables were cooked I removed them from the pan and set them aside; then cooked the chicken and mixed everything together at the end. This was simply delicious and also made for a colorful and attractive presentation.  We really enjoyed this so much.  It was nicely spiced but not hot, so it was a real treat for Hubs to actually have something with a little spice that his sensitive innards could tolerate.  I had full intentions of serving this with the tomato but I forgot - but this has so much flavor going on it wasn't even missed.  Trying to watch carbs where I can, I didn't serve this in tortillas, choosing AR member SB's personal recipe "Cheesy Poblano Rice" instead.  The Monterey Jack, a squeeze of fresh lime and a plop of sour cream was a nice finish. This will certainly make a comeback.  It's a delicious and nutritious meal that's quick to prepare.

I changed this up so much that I'm actually going to write a custom recipe for it, but I think this recipes deserves five stars for the flavor alone. I didn't add the bacon, but we don't like it and I'm sure using it would have *lowered* the rating for us. Thanks for a recipe I found perfect for customization.

My husband is without a doubt the most picky eater I have ever met. He has never even attempted to eat leftovers. He not only LOVED this dish, but ASKED for it the next night! since then, I have made several things from this site, and he has enjoyed them all...although this is his favorite. I wish I could give it a higher rating!!

Very good recipes. I will make again but I will drain off most of the bacon grease.

When I made this for dinner last night, I expected this to be good, but nothing over the top.  Boy, was I wrong!  This little recipe was absolutely delicious.  I did a few things different to prepare this recipe, but did not change any ingredients, and it could not have altered the outcome at all.  I chose to grill my chicken, because I just couldn't believe the chicken would cook along with the bacon and veggies.  I diced my bacon, cooked it and then took it out of the pan adding it when dinner was ready to be served.  Those were the only differences (besides cutting back on the cilantro quite a bit, which is a personal preference).  I served it in tortillas with a smear of sour cream and topped with the monterey jack and tomatoes.  What a simple and absolutely delicious meal.  These turned out to be the perfect fajitas.  Thank you Rhonda for sharing your recipe...it will be a definite keeper in our house.

Comforting, tasty, and fairly quick to pull together.  I used turkey bacon and canned (drained) fire-roasted tomatoes in lieu of fresh tomatoes. The family loved it; I'll definitely make this dish again.

Cilantro alert!  But, I love cilantro, so this was no problem!  This is well seasoned, and the cooking times are accurate, however, I started with the bacon, removed it from the skillet along with most of the drippings.  Next, I cooked the chicken, after letting it sit in the seasonings while I prepared the veggies.  Then I added back a little of the drippings and sauteed the onion and bell pepper, allowing them to get tender crisp.  Next I added the tomatoes, stirred together with the cilantro.  After about a minute, I added back the chicken and the bacon (which I crumbled).  I stirred everything to combine, then I put 4 oz. of Monterrey Jack over all and allowed it to melt, as the original directions state.  I served it with whole wheat tortillas, and I wish I had made guacamole, for it would have been a great addition to this dish.  As TexCook stated in her review, chicken "fajitas without the grilling."  Thanks for the idea.

This was great! I will make this again and again.  REVISION: I had to wing it tonight, I did not have fajita seasoning so I used onion powder, cumin, paprika, a bit of cayenne, oregano, and sugar...they smell great. I will have to wait and see how they come out.  At the end I added some lime zest and the juice of one lime. Oh yeah, I also cooked it in my electric skillet. I turned it all the way up so that I could get a good browning on the chicken. I served this with Terry's Texas Pinto Beans also from this site and some Spanish rice. YUM-O

Flavor-wise this was very good. Next time I would remove the pepper/onion mixture before adding the chicken because they got waaaaay too done. Also, I would only use the bacon grease & leave the bacon for another use. I love bacon & the flavor of the bacon in this but just didn't care for that extra texture. Didn't seem to "go" with it.

We LOVED this! I had some bacon already cooked, so I just cooked the green peppers, onions, chicken, garlic powder, some dried cilantro (that's all I had) and fajita seasoning (used more than called for, to taste) in a pan also adding in the juice of 1/2 of a lime. When that was almost done, I threw in the bacon and the juice of the other 1/2 of lime and finished cooking.. I did not put the monterey jack on right away b/c I was serving this on flour tortillas, so we just put it on then. Also served sour cream, the tomatoes and taco sauce on them. These were a HUGE hit w/ me and the hubby, and we both agreed that this would be wonderful on top of a salad, which is what I plan to do next time. Side note: I halved the amount of chicken, garlic powder and bacon, but pretty much kept everything else the same.  A definite keeper and a new favorite~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

The bacon seemed out of place (not sure if that's traditional or not) but we won't use it next time. I'd chosen to marinade the chicken with "Fajita Marinade I" and so I skipped garlic powder & fajita seasoning called for in this recipe. I replaced the cilantro with a little bit of parsley. It was very tasty- Serve with sour cream, salsa and guacamole (or some Southwest sauce). We ate these with cheese/salsa nachos.

This dish was too fatty. Too much grease made my tortilla very soggy. Next time I would defintely drain the fat and add some different seasonings for more flavor.

This is a fun idea - it's like fajitas without the grilling!  I made this for my b/f and two of his friends last weekend (a moment of weakness agreeing to cook for 3 guys!) and they loved it. I added a few jalapenos along with the pepper and onion, and I used pepper jack cheese to give it a little bit of a kick, but otherwise I wouldn't change anything.

This was delicious!! I took my cues from another review and cooked the bacon, veggies and chicken separately, then combined and covered with the fresh tomatoes. I did marinate my chicken in homemade fajita seasoning in the fridge all day. Served over rice, but I wish we had tortillas! It really was fabulous!!

This was the best! Oh my gosh! I have to share that I had to cook it in the oven, because we just moved and no pans yet! lol! I cooked the bacon in the morning and did not use any bacon drippings...you don't need it! So I took a 9 x 13 casserole dish...put the bacon on the bottom, layered with green pepper and onion, and half of the cilantro. I seasoned the chicken (chicken thighs, cheaper than breasts) as instructed, then just put it on top of everything else. When the chicken was almost done, I threw on a can of diced tomatoes, and let it cook a little longer. I started the oven at 375, then jumped it up to 400 degrees. I don't remember the total time...just checked until the chicken looked done. One other thing I did was I made my own fajita seasoning....easy and tasty. Then we just put the cheese and the rest of the cilantro on our fajitas as we assembled them. I think the cilantro is the key to this. You will love it!

Great recipe ! I changed it up just a bit. Used two cans of rotel tomatoes instead of chopped fresh tomato because i wanted to serve this over rice. I also cooked the bacon, then the veggies, then the chicken. Added all back together with the rotel tomatoes, excluded the cilantro, and added salt and a bit more fajita seasoning. Hubby loved it ! :-)

We liked this. I didn't add tomato, but served it with salsa instead. I also only used 2 thick slices of bacon (we aren't huge bacon eaters) and the fat that burned off of that proved to be plenty to saute the other stuff in. Served in soft shells with guacamole and mex rice. The next day, with the left overs I cut up some lettuce to eat with the chicken and it was like a fajita salad. My husband really liked that too.

I had some leftovers on hand: cooked chicken tenders and bacon and went looking for a recipe to use them. With peppers, onions and cilantro on hand , this one fit the bill. I sautéed the peppers and onions then added the chicken and bacon ( crumbled into pieces). I didn't have a tomato  so I used some homemade salsa instead. I seasoned everything with Tex-mex seasoning and cumin then melted some Tex mex cheese blend on top. Very tasty and easy!

I made a few times and everytime it gets better... i cut the bacon strips into four pieces each before i fry it so i can get a little bacon in every bite... I also put it in the oven at 320 uncovered for 20-30 minutes as the last step to melt the cheese with cilantro and tomato..all sorts of goodness...oh and i used shredded pepperjack...

This was a simple recipe, easily adaptable if you are out of one thing or another. I did cook the bacon separately and used only a bit of the grease for the onions and peppers. I had a liquid fajita sauce so marinated the chicken in that and then drained it off. The tomato I thought I had I didn't, so instead I tossed in a drained can of Rotel at the end and heated it for a minute before turning off the heat and adding the cilantro and cheese. I had a jalapeno Monterey Jack cheese so threw that on for the melting and did use less so that it didn't overpower the dish. Tasty and easy - something that anyone who likes southwestern/Mexican flavors will enjoy.

I made this without the bacon and served over tortilla chips as fajita nachos.  It had good flavor and was fairly easy to make.  Next time I would like to use homemade fajita seasoning, in lieu of the pre-packaged that I bought.  the cilantro was a nice touch.  Thanks for sharing, RHONDA35!

Such great flavor.  I wasn't exactly sure how to serve this.  We heated up some tortillas and it was great.  Maybe rice would make a nice side dish.  I did end up with more liquid than I needed, but I just spooned it out before I added the cheese.

Nice dish with simple ingredients (no need to empty out your pantry for this one!). Followed recipe with the exception of subbing sharp cheddar for Monterey Jack (didn't have it).  Very tasty, but probably wouldn't suffer from cutting back on the bacon (or omitting it entirely). This recipe has enough flavor from the pepper & onions, garlic & fajita seasoning...you could barely tell the bacon was in there, so why add the fat & calories?  Will make again without bacon...definitely worth a try.

I thought this was good. My hubby liked it but we didn't love it. It had too much cilantro which was a little overpowering. Also, we could not find fajita seasoning so we used taco seasoning, perhaps that might have made a difference. It is the kind of recipe I am inclined to try again with less cilantro.

I fixed this one twice and everyone loved it, both times.  I didn't change a thing.

This was a great change, I think the cilantro really made this dish.  If i would change one thing, I would cut the bacon up in maybe quaters, but this was an EXCELLENT dish!
