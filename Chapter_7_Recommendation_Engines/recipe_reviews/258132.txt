I followed the recipe, but of used dried dill weed instead of fresh dill. I also added a bit more lemon pepper.  I upped the pierogies to 20 because I didn't want to leave 5 in the bag. My sons and I all loved it. My sons are huge pierogie fans anyway. It is great with hot sauce added on top. Definitely will make it again.
