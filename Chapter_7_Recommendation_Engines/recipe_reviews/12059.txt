Great recipe!  My husband and kids all like it.  I added two cloves garlic, an extra can of tomato sauce and some extra cheese.  Really easy and delicious!

My family said this tasted like hamburger helper.  They like hamburger helper, so why go to the extra trouble to make this recipe then.

We used to have this all the time growing up in Ohio - where Marzetti was started. We've always made it with elbow noodles, so I made that substitution - otherwise, it was just how I remembered! The Worcestershire sauce gives the tomato sauce a "meaty" flavor - don't skip it!  I made a big batch and froze half before adding the pasta. It tasted great and the whole family went back for seconds. Great hot meal for busy families!

This was fairly tasty and just what I was looking for. An adult version of beefaroni. I left out the mushrooms, used medium cheddar cheese, and added 4 cloves of minced garlic in with the meat and the onion.

This was fabulous. We made a double batch using macaroni instead of egg noodles.  We used two 9x13 pans, and added half macaroni and half the sauce with shredded cheddar cheese, and the other pan had the other half of pasta, sauce, and shredded mozzarella. Both were fantastic. My 15 month old twins wouldn't stop eating out of my bowl.

This was pretty good. I ommitted the mushrooms as no one in my family would like them. I also put in some garlic cloves, and added some Italian Seasoning, as previous reviews had said it was bland. I used Medium Cheddar instead of sharp as that is what I had.
Will make this again.

My whole family loves this dish - my husband, my teenage on, my preteen daughter and my picky 9 year old.  I shared it with a neighbor and her family likes it too.

I use 1 1/2 lbs of meat and add an extra 8 oz can of sauce.

What an easy and delicious recipe! I had only a few ingredients to work with since the weather was crazy, so when I found this, I made it and hoped for the best. WOW was I surprised! Unlike other reviewers, I didn't get a beefaroni or hamburger helper vibe at all. This recipe was delicious! It's a keeper!

Excellent!!! I did add 4 garlic cloves (we love garlic) to the meat and onions while it was cooking, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I also made my own egg noodles from a recipe on this site which made the meal even better. My husband raved about how delicious this dinner was, and it will be in our regular rotation now. Thank you for a great recipe! :-)

I used fresh mushrooms (uncooked) on one half when I was layering the sauce/noodles because my kids don't like mushrooms.  It worked out well.  The sugar adds a different taste; very interesting.  Instead of tomato sauce I used tomato soup (I had LOTS on hand); which also made it a bit sweeter.  Husband LOVED it -- had three helpings.

I made this for my husband and my my two daughters who are 2 & 4, everyone loved it!  It had great flavor and was pretty easy.  I had a few revisions...I added an extra cup of jack cheese (i love cheese) I added 4 garlic cloves to the beef and onion mixture and some italian spices.  I also just mixed all the ingredients together before baking, I didn't later and it turned out great!

Good receipe.  I added more cheese, sugar, and fresh mushrooms instead of the canned.  The amount of sauce may look excessive, but you should use it all.  Otherwise, the final dish will be dry.

Decent meal. Quick and easy. Could’ve done without mushrooms and maybe mozzarella cheese would’ve been better. Otherwise pretty decent meal to feed family. Whoever said hamburger helper was better in their review must be crazy, since when is sauce out of packet better than a real recipe for your family.

Delicious!  I made as directed, but used elbows instead of noodles.  Recipe calls for 2-quart casserole dish, but mine (with no additions) barely fit into a 2.5-qt dish.  If I decide to add green peppers or whatever (and I will be making this again!) , I know to move up to a 9x13 pan.

Simple to make, basic ingredients & kids loved it. Better than I thought it would be. I was a little weirded out topping it with cheddar cheese but don't regret it.

This was really good!  Someone said why waste the time and effort to make this instead of Hamburger Helper. It is because this not only tastes better but it doesn't have the extra sodium and unpronounceable ingredients you get in Hamburger Helper.  This is exactly what I was looking for and I know we will have this again and again.  I used shell noodles and minced garlic rather than powder (about 1 clove), otherwise as written.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. i followed the recipe exactly but used fresh garlic and mushrooms. it was really good. My husband, who is very picky about his food, loved it. I like to keep my pantry stocked with items that can be used when I Need something quick for dinner. This is a perfect recipe. I always have ground beef in the freezer and tomato sauce and noodles in the pantry. This recipe is a keeper.

I used mostaccioli instead of noodles and mixed together with the sauce.  I added Italian seasonings and garlic to the tomato sauce.  Subbed Johnsonville Italian sausage for the hamburger.  Yum!

I think this recipe has good potential to be a great recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only had one 15 oz can of tomato sauce and so added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes instead.  I used the can mushrooms as listed and next time will use fresh mushrooms.  I didn't really like the canned taste but that's just my preference.  My family and I really liked this recipe but I couldn't help feeling there was something missing or the taste was just off slightly. I think when I make it again I will add more spices and garlic to liven it up a bit.  Thanks for sharing.

Sorry, but I thought this was awful ... if it was made without the sugar, that might boost it up to about a 3 (it was just SO SWEET), but I really did not like it at all.

I used Vidalia Onions in this recipe along with a liberal amount of Garlic Salt.  Also, I doubled the recipe to freeze one casserole and added desired amount of Chili Powder.  Family loved it.  In fact, my adult daughter wanted to take some home!

I really liked this.  It's easy to make and I usually have all of the ingredients handy. I used fresh mushrooms-canned ones are just too weird. I will add a few less noodles next time.  Freezes and reheats well.  Thanks!

Wow - this was really great! This was very easy to make and my husband and 2 year old ate it up. Nice flavor and really good "stick-to-your-ribs" casserole! Thanks for sharing it!

Yes, it did taste very fresh with the tomatoes but it just didn't have enough seasoning for me.  Didn't have enough tomato sauce so I used a big can of peeled plum tomatoes and mashed them up to make sauce.  I also used a red onion since that was all I had. Not sure I will make again.

I used elbow macaroni, green pepper, added garlic and onion powder, pinch of brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. Very good.

I thought this was very good.  I didn't really change much but used macaroni instead of noodles, as that is the way my mom always made it. I added about half a can of corn as I like the crunch.  I also added more garlic powder and a little basil.  In addition to sharp cheddar cheese, I sprinkled about 2 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheeseon each layer.  This was very good!

Not bad, but not great.  Even the kids had mixed feelings.  Needs something to "pump it up" a little.

This was good.  I think it will be better the next day warmed up.  I used macaroni and one can of diced tomatoes instead of all tomato sauce.  My husband really liked it too.
