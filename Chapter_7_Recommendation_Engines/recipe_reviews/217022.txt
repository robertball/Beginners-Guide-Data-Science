Very good!  I used cake flour instead of matzo.  For the icing, I used milk instead of creamer and water.

Sounds great, but we don't use leavening like the baking powder.  Did you ever try without the baking powder and soda?  Just was wondering before I gave it a try!  I'm rating, but I really haven't tried it, but I guess this is the only way I can put this in the review!

I didn't have lemon extract so substituted Lemoncello liqueur.  Also, I baked it in an 8" cake pan for 30 minutes.  Very good and a lot better the next day.  Used lemon glaze recipe from 2nd Helpings cook book.  Will make again!

I've tried this as a 'regular' cake using regular flour.  It's delicious but a teeny bit dry, even with underbaking it by about 5 minutes.  The second time I made it I substituted orange juice and orange extract in place of the lemon.  Also very good but I would probably add a hit more extract to the batter.  For the icing - to keep it completely dairy free, instead of the creamer mixed with water, I used 50-50 water/OJ (or lemon juice for the original recipe) and then cut the extract in half.  I needed to add a bit more liquid than the recipe calls for to get the icing to the consistency I wanted.  But overall, I would definitely eat this again.  And very simple to make.
