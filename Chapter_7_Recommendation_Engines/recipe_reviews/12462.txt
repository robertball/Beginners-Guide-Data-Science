My goodnes, this is delicious!  I used a 9" whole wheat pie shell, and based on a previous review stating this was more a side dish beefed it up with 3 eggs and 8 oz. crumbled feta (1 cup).  I used fresh parsley, dried tarragon, and omitted the dill.  I did not add any salt because I thought the cheese would be enough, but I will probably add a dash next time.  My husband can be quite picky when it comes to new foods, but he went back for seconds.  I served with a greek side salad and grilled chicken apple sausage w/ grainy mustard. This is now one of my favorites for dinner or brunch. Thank YOU!

I made this recipe in a pre-made pie crust with goat cheese and it turned out great; it took just under 40 minutes to fully cook.  I would definitely make it again!

This pie is more like a side dish. I wouldn't recommend it as a main dish unless you are an onion freak. I probably won't make it again. The effort isn't worth the taste.

A little too "herby" for me but I used dried thyme and I wonder if that had something to do with it I also omitted dill as it doesn't sound right for this dish. I added four egg whites and carmelized the onions which tasted really good. I didn't have leeks so I used green onion.

Apart from omitting the tarragon - I can't stand it - I made this as written, and I can't say I was impressed. I've really only ever used dill with fish - mainly salmon - and I didn't think it complimented the feta cheese and leeks at all. I liked the idea of using a breadcrumb base instead of a pie crust, but I'll be sticking with my usual cheese and onion quiche filling in future. Thanks anyway!

Was not impressed.  I agree with everyone else that this is a side dish not a main dish.  We all agreed that the tomatoe was the only good part of the dish.  The white wine adds nothing to this dish (execpt moisture) I followed this recipe exactly.  It need to be kicked up with some hot sauce and maybe sprinkle some feat on top of the dish instead of the bread crumbs.  Lots of chopping, lots of time for poor result.

I subbed basil for tarragon (because I hate tarragon) and used a big beefsteak tomato. My family really enjoyed this. I'll definitely be making it again. In the future, I'll add more feta and continue to use more tomato than the recipe calls for.

I tried it tonight. Didn't have red onions, so I used Vidalia instead. I had some leftover tomatoes, no salt added in the fridge, I use those instead of fresh ones. And I used red wine, because I had no white. To cut down on Cholesterol I used Eggbeaters instead. It was very good, indeed. Even my kids liked it. Marked for repeats. Next time, I might use bacon for my carnivores in my Family to give it a little twist. Thanks!

Quite bland other than the overwhelming taste of tarragon.  Also made a very thin, flat dish.  Probably wouldn't make this dish again but if I did I'd reduce the amount of tarragon, add 2 more eggs and a bit of garlic.

I thought there was a little too much in the recipe. I used 1/2 red onion and 1 white onion, parsley and a pinch of dill, a 9" deep dish pie crust, 3 eggs, and 6oz feta. I made it for the vegetarians, but had to make another one for the carnivores!
