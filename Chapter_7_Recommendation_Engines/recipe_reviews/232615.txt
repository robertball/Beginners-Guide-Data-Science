I made this burger using a 90/10 ground beef since I was out of ground turkey.  It was good, but I was hoping for more of the teriyaki flavor to come through in the burger.  The consistency was nice though and sort of light because of the panko bread crumbs.  I also used freshly sliced pineapple, but I didn't grill it (no time), and it was really yummy on the burger.  Grilling the pineapple would have probably cut down on the amount of juice so it wouldn't have made the bun soggy.  Will make this again with some additional changes.

This is pretty good but I added chopped bell peppers and sliced green onion. The kids liked them, tangey and salty.

I was disappointed in this.  There just wasn't enough flavor - and you would think with basting sauce and grilled pineapple - but it was just blah.  Sorry, we won't be making it again
