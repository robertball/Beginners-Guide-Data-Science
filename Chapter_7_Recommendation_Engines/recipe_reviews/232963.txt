This is one of the best Spritz recipe I've ever tried--superior! Just remember to use room temp eggs & butter--only thing different I do is bake about 14-15 minutes till bottoms & edges are a very light golden color-so they are crispy. Store in tins @ room temp keep couple weeks-but are usually gone long before that!!!!!!

12/21/14 UPDATE: I still think this recipe is the best out there. I get so many compliments on these spritz and have also made batches using 1tbs vanilla 1tbs lemon with great results and for something different and unexpected. This dough is just the best to work with. I have made so many batches of these and they make a lot. Perfection! I don't like a tremendous almond flavor so used just 1 tbsp of almond and 1/2 tbsp each caramel and vanilla. I love the fact that there is no baking soda or powder in this. The dough is absolutely wonderful to work with and the finished product is sheer delight. Tender tender tender but keep their shape so nicely. Makes a nice sized batch and slide right off the silpats. thank you so much for this easy but 5 star result recipe. make beautiful presentation due to the wonderful consistency of the dough.

The Perfect Spritz. I have been baking cookies for 55 years. I gave up on spritz years ago either because the consistency was poor or the flavor mediocre. I decided to try this recipe today and I will definitely be making these next year! Like others I was hesitant about the 2T of almond extract so I only added 1T and 1t vanilla. Next time I will add the 2T of almond extract. Finally a spritz equal to grandma's!

Best Spritz EVER! Its the same recipe as I received this year from my friend who received it from her Swedish grandmother. The only difference was: her recipe used 2 whole eggs rather than 2 yolks and one white. I tried both ways. It makes no difference one way or the other. Why waste the egg-white? Wonderful recipe...I'm through looking for a better one. There isn't any!

I can't remember a Christmas without Spritz cookies and I'm 65. The recipe I used for so many years came from my Norwegian Grandmother.....This recipe is better. Perfect shape with every cookie and excellent taste.

I have been looking for "the" spritz cookie recipe for years-this is IT!! These remind me exactly of the ones I devoured as a kid. Baked up tender and crisp and worked perfectly in my press. I was a little intimidated by the 2 tablespoons of almond extract the recipe calls for and decided to use only one. I'm glad I did. It was plenty for me but that is probably more of a personal preference. Can't fault the recipe for that!

This is the old fashioned recipe that I have been looking for! Great taste! Sprinkle with colored sugar before backing then I dip the bottoms in melted chocolate after baking & cooling and stick 2 together.

Just got through baking these cookies and they are disappearing fast! I adjusted the recipe by adding 3 teaspoons of fresh squeezed orange juice (I don't care for almond extract) and the zest of an orange. The cookies came out perfect!

BEST. Spritz. Cookie. Recipe. EVER. Didn't change a thing. After years of making spritz cookies and flip flopping between recipes I finally found a keeper. The dough is PERFECT to work with and tastes delish! This recipe really makes the best spritz cookie. Even after added food coloring the consistency of the dough remains perfect. THANK YOU

Delicious! This was the kind of flavor and texture I was hoping for! These cookies are tender and light but flavorful yet not overly sweet. They have just the right amount of sweetness to them.:-) I did have issues with getting them out of my cookie press but that was probably user error more than anything.

These tasted pretty good but they were tough when they came out of the oven and hard as a rock the next day. Change "beat" to "mix" when adding the flour and I think it would turn much better.

Just what I was looking for to use with my cookie press. Delicious! I like them plain but the kids wanted sprinkles on some. After baking we added a very light coat of a simple glaze (confectioner's sugar & milk) so the sprinkles had something to stick to. This recipe is a keeper.

There was way too much flour used in this recipe. I seriously struggled with pushing it through the cookie press. Such a waste of butter and flour. The flavor was ok but it was very very sutble. Bland.

Made these for the first time ever and they were gone in less than 24hours. It is June so I did not want to use almond so I used lemon zest. And I only had 1 cup of butter and anted to make a full batch so I used 1 cup of coconut oil and 1 cup of butter and added a little coconut flavor. Sooooo good! Will make many times again.

The best spritz recipe I have found! These are wonderful. People always ask me for my recipe when I serve these. I follow the recipe exactly. It's important to use room temperature eggs and butter to get the right consistency.

Excellent recipe! The dough worked beautifully in my cookies press and I like that it didn't need to be chilled first. Like some other reviewers I was skeptical of using 2 tablespoons of almond extract but it was perfect -- just the right amount of flavor. I let my eggs come to room temp based on another review and I used both egg whites (not just one which the recipe called for). Perfection!

We thought 2 Tb of almond extract might be a but much so we used 1 Tb each of almond and vanilla. This resulted in the best Spritz we've ever tasted and they were so pretty with just a little but of crystal sprinkles on top!

Great traditional cookie press/spritz recipe. Dough is soft and very easy to work with. Instead of using the almond flavoring I used 2T vanilla and 1tsp cardamom which is my Swedish grandma's traditional flavorings. My favorite cookie for potlucks Christmas parties and the cookie jar. They're delicate bite size with lots of cute shapes. Easy to dress them up with a few sprinkles or cherries or other decorations. So festive with minimal work. These always get compliments for taste and looks.

I followed the recipe to the T but didn t get the taste I remember when mom made them. Probably something I did since this was my first homemade cookie attempt. Not bad but texture and taste wasn t what I was looking for. The dough was easy to use. Perhaps I should stick with main course recipes and skip cookie making. lol

I have made Spritz cookies dozens of times and tried several versions. This really was the best dough to work with! I happen to like a bit of a brown edge on mine so I baked them longer but other than that I would not change a thing. Thank you!

There is just too much flour in this recipe for my liking. Very bland. I will look for a way to make them tastier with glaze or something. I feel it was a waste of butter and flour. Sorry.

At the moment I will give this recipe 3 stars. The cookies tasted great (I did one Tbsp Almond half Tbsp Vanilla and half Tbsp caramel extracts as one reviewer suggested). But I did not grow up making spritz cookies so this was my first time. I received a cookie press for Christmas (high quality one) and thought it would be so fun and easy. Cut to me throwing the cookie press across the kitchen and storming out! Now the cookie press did not come with much instruction (or even a suggested recipe) but I am an engineer so I thought "No problem!" I don't know if it was me not knowing how to use the cookie press the hot/humid climate I live in or the recipe itself but pressing these cookies were a nightmare. I think the dough was too soft and I should have tried chilling it for a while. None of the cookies really resembled the shape they were supposed to and did not look cute at all. But people still liked how they tasted regardless. Once I am over the rage I feel when I see my cookie press I will try this recipe again but and a chilling step to see if that helps.

I agree with the others this is a great dough! Although it seems soft it works in the press perfectly! (I use an old-fashioned screw down kind). Love the fact that there is no refrigeration. Used unsalted butter so added some salt to the dough. Thanks!

This was my first go at cookie press cookies. I got a high quality stainless steel cookie press. I used this recipe. I used a buttered cookie sheet a cookie sheet sprayed with PAM and a completely dry cookie sheet. All three functioned the same way. I was a little freaked by a recipe that used and entire pound of butter but couldn't be more impressed with the results

We live at 1200 above sea level so I am not sure if that is why I needed to add a 1/2 cup more flour to the recipe in order for it to work in the cookie press. Tasty dough. Made the icing and sugared them. Will experiment with lemon or orange zest and perhaps shaved chocolate and top with chocolate sprinkles next time!

I made as directed in the recipe. I initially thought the 2 tablespoons almond was too much but it actually tasted good. I tried to put it through the cookie press and it was a sticky mess. I also tried to chill out and put it through the cookie press but it was too difficult to squeeze it out. So I rolled the dough into a log chilled it and cut into slices. I rolled them in green and red sugar Before baking and put a little extra sprinkle of colored sugar on top when they came out. Tasted great and looked great. So although they tasted good they just didn t work for me in a cookie press.

Awesome! Worked well in the cookie press. I was skeptical of the 2 TBSPs of almond extract but it works. I made it as written with no adjustments. I think next time I might try vanilla extract. Just remember to cook them a wee bit longer so you get that extra kick. The almond flavor will be more pronounced with less cooking time but you get less of that flakiness in the cookie. So if you are afraid of the vanilla cook it just a minute or two longer. If you want to color the cookies just remember the color will be lighter after you bake it.

Horrible. It hardly can be spritzed even after chilling the dough. Then the taste is something between pure butter and pure bland. I wasted half Thanksgiving Day trying to make these. Never again!

Used half vanilla and half almond extract because I was afraid the almond taste would be too strong. My husband and I loved these cookies but the almond extract was too strong for our three children. As another person mentioned these cookies taste better the next day. I liked that they didn't get crunchy because I prefer a softer cookie.

I look for a good cookie press recipe every year for our Christmas Cookies. I know my mom's had almond flavoring so I tried this one this year! Fantastic! The one word of warning is to be careful how long you let them cook and cool on the cookie sheet. If I cooked a little too long and left to cool they broke when taking the off the sheet. Of course my kids did not mind eating the broken pieces that I did not want to serve to guests!

This made beautiful cookies easily in the cookie press. Delicate almond flavor. - the amount of almond extract seems like a lot but it is perfect. You do not need to grease the pan. I made this twice and when the edges just start to turn golden is the time to take them out of the oven... soft but with a bit of crispness.

Taste's like my grandmothers spritz! Would have given it 5 stars but it didn't work well for Christmas trees so I just made wreaths with the press instead.
