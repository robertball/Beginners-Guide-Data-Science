I'm giving this 5 stars because my entire family liked it (kids are almost two and four and a half). Score!  I didn't fry it first mostly because I needed my hands to do other things to get dinner ready in a hurry. I followed the direction exactly except after I floured them I also dipped them in panko.  I put them on a greased cookie sheet and baked on 450 for about 20 mins.  Once they can be pierced with a fork, I took them out and put tomato sauce, a generous amount of parmesan and then grated mozzarella and put them back in at 350 for about 5-10 minutes to melt cheese.  Baking them made them plenty crispy and really delicious!  My guess is too much oil could make them soggy if you weren't careful.

Really quite good. I took the recommendation of others and floured, egged then dipped these slices in italian breadcrumbs. After greasing a cookie sheet with olive oil, I cooked these for 20 mins at 450. Then topped with sauce, parm and mozz cheeses and a mix of mushrooms, onions, garlic, and red peppers. bake again for 8 minutes on 350. Like homemade tapas! Please make. So easy and came out crispy and perfect.

This recipe was great and fun! Here's what I did differently. 1). I coated the eggplant in eggs and breadcrumbs rather than flour and since they were seasoned it gave the pizzas a bit of flavor. When I fried them I used just enough oil to coat the pan and they dried them w/ a paper towel before baking 2). I added veggie italian sausage, mushrooms and onion and I stir-fried the veggies a bit first so they were tender.

This recipe was even liked by my very picky 5-year old daughter (of course I just told her they were pizzas, but after she ate 2 I told her it was eggplant and she didn't believe me!).

I made this but exchanged the eggplant with a large zucchini as eggplant isn't available often here and is expensive where zukes are giveaway at this time of year.  I also baked them in the oven on a greased cookie sheet turning them over half way into cooking time. (absorbs less oil) Slightly crisp crust, could be finger food, but SO good.  Could top with chopped ham or some other meat and a pepper or two for a heartier meal for young 'uns.

I needed to get rid of my eggplant and mushrooms before I ended up having to toss them in the trash as usual. I'm trying to eat a bit healthier, so frying the eggplant didn't appeal to me at all.   I changed the ingredients a bit because I used crushed plain Cheerios, Ritz crackers, and a touch of cornmeal to bread, then let them bake in the oven for about 15 min for each side (I cut very thick slices, a little over half an inch, but don't recommend cutting so thick; I got knife happy, lol), then took them out and added the sauce, cheese, and mushrooms (sauteed). I let them cook for ten more min. then took them out. Great recipe and I'll definitely try it again!!

This was my second time working with eggplant and it went very well.  Just keep in mind that the eggplant can burn rather quickly...  I can't help but think that the rule that nothing can be bad when smothered with cheese holds true here.

Delicious! Like Filaree, I skipped the frying. I just dipped them in egg, sprinkled salt and garlic seasoning, baked them for 20 minutes at 450, topped them with tomato sauce, parmesean,  and mozzarella, and then baked them for another 6 minutes. Plenty crispy. I feel like frying them would have been gross! Next time I might try to dip them in almond flour instead of wheat flour (I try to avoid wheat whenever possible).

De-freaking-licious.  I love pizza but follow a very carb controlled diet so any bread substitutes are awesome!!!  Loved it just as written but added pepperoni.

I love this recipe! This was my first time cooking with eggplant. I will definitely make this again. I did find that if you want to add other veggies, i.e. onions and mushrooms, saute them first.

YUM. So good. I love eggplant, and pizza, so this was a winner for me!!  I did not fry the eggplant - just brushed on some olive oil and baked it for approximately 15 minutes first, then put the pizza toppings on and put it back in the oven. Loved it and will make again.

I also baked these instead of frying them (although the hubby said he would have preferred them fried).  I also mixed some Parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs (which made the eggplant really tasty.)  I had never eaten eggplant before and this was a really excellent way to try it!

I soaked the eggplant for 10 minutes in salt water (a trick I use when cooking eggplant parmesan) and still found it to be a little bland. This turned out to be an okay substitute for eggplant parmesan. I really like the little "pizza" presentation, though.

I dont think I will make these again. Or maybe I will. Not sure. The eggplant turned out a little too soggy for our taste. If I can make it crisper, I think I will try again.

This was a great easy to make recipe. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, and I baked it instead of frying it before hand. To bake; I greased a baking sheet, added the battered eggplant and lightly sprayed the tops with olive oil. I baked them for 15-20 min at 450 and removed them from the oven to add the toppings. I turned the oven down to 350, and baked with the toppings for 5-10 min. The favourite toppings were tomato, mushroom, asparagus and goat cheese.

Pretty good, just like Eggplant Parmesan in circular form.  The kids liked putting them together and they even ate some too!  I liked someone's review where they used zucchini, I might try that next time.

This was actually super delicious! I wanted to make a meatless meal for my family and this turned out great! I am not very familiar with eggplant, but now I like the stuff. Just make sure your oil is HOT enough before putting the eggplant slices in, my first couple of pieces were soaked in oil and it wasnt hot enough - my bad! On top of the mozzarella I placed minced red onion, sweet baby peppers and garlic. Yum yum! Mine only needed about 6-7 minutes in the oven, they were just so wonderful! Will definitely make again.

I made it gluten free using gluten free pancake mix instead of the flour.  I also added onion and garlic powder to the pancake mix.   Everyone liked it.

I also baked these instead of frying (450 degrees for 20 minutes). And I topped them with a variety of toppings - diced ham, spinach, mushrooms & red onions - all chopped into small pieces and sauteed prior to topping. Finally, I used pepper jack cheese as I did not have mozzarella. Even my husband loved these and he is not usually very fond of dishes that substitute pasta/bread with veggies.

This was tasty and well liked by my family. I used flour and Italian bread crumbs and for toppings I did mushrooms with fresh Basil and Oregano and cheese. Side of fruit salad and it was a complete meal!

Very good! Wished I could have used bread crumbs instead of flour but I didn't have any. It was still great. I also used tomatoes instead of pizza sauce and added some basil and Italian seasonings to the flour. Was delish!

I loved this recipe. It was my first attempt at cooking with eggplant and I made a few changes. I wrote a post on my blog about my first eggplant experience.

I dipped in egg white, then in a mixture of breadcrumbs and flour mix. Then baked at 450¬∫ for 20 minutes in stead of frying. While it was baking I carmelized some yellow onions and then added mushroom, a little sherry and garlic.  Topped the eggplant with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and onion/mushroom mixture and even my "eggplant hating husband" was raving about these.  My son said he could be a vegetarian if the food was this good!  These could be good appetizers if the eggplant was thin and made smaller rounds.

Great recipe for a quick dinner.  I prefer upside down (cheese on the bottom of the tomato sauce) on regular pizza.  Came out great.

I love this idea!!! I have had it twice and the second time I made it for my grandparents who aren't eggplant lovers and they said it tasted excellent! I cut the eggplant lengthwise instead of in rounds so you could fit more toppings on it and it makes excellent pizza! Just be creative on your toppings and you can't fail!

Followed different directions and it turned out fantastic. The kids ate seconds despite bemoaning eggplant being the main ingredient. Similar to what's recommended below, I dredged the sliced eggplant in beaten egg then Italian breadcrumbs and baked on a lightly olive 'oiled' cookie sheet at 400F for 20 minutes. I removed and while hot spooned on the pizza sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese with a dash of oregano on top. They went back in the oven for 8 minutes at 350 degrees. After coming out I let them rest but a minute before the ravenous bunch took over. They were delish, loved by all and beyond easy.

This was fun to make! Quick, easy and a different take on a pizza style entree. I baked mine a little longer than 10 minutes to get a crispier result. I also sprinkled a little Italian seasoning on the cheese to give a little color.

Like everyone else, I baked the eggplant instead of frying. I added more of the seasonings to the flour, and also added garlic and parsley. Two medium eggplant filled up an entire half-sheet pan. Hubby loved it! Next time I‚Äôll try to get the eggplant crispy by cutting the eggplant thinner (1/4‚Äù), adding Parmesan cheese to the breading, and flipping half way through baking.

Hubby actually ate this and he's not a fan of eggplant. I substituted the flour and used breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs toasted in the oven and gave it a crunchy bite. I added pepperoni too.

I made this recipe as my first time eating eggplant. I followed the directions but added sliced pepperoni and Italian blend cheese. My boyfriend and I loved it. He has requested that I make it again only 4 days later. This will be a regular when eggplant is in season.

Did you say, "Home run"???  I followed the recipe to a "T".  My husband really dislikes Eggplant, so I was reluctant to fix it but will all aspects, he LOVES spaghetti sauce and cheese.  His comment "You hit a home run".  Oh my goodness, I will fix this over and over again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Very good. Seasoned bread crumbs are a must along with italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. I served them on pasta with the remaining marinara. The last batch was forgotten and left in the oven for a good 35 minutes. They baked into crisp little nuggets which were incredibly delicious!

I just made this tonight. We planted a garden this year, and our eggplants are thriving!! I followed the suggestions of others and put panko on the eggplant after the flour dip. Added chicken and vegetables from our garden for toppings.....SO GOOD!! Will make again!

Very good. Baked instead of fried like others suggested. Very good heated later in toaster. May add some fresh or dried herbs next time. I am going to try freezing some to toast every time I want a little pizza snack. Thanks for recipe.

These turned out really good. The only draw back was that we found out 2 of the people who ate them are allergic to egg plant.  They did not even know. Unfortunately I cannot make this for my family again...

These were delicious. I did not fry them in oil, I just coated them in flour, egg, bread crumbs and baked them for 20 minutes at 420 degrees, flipped them over half way through. Then I put the ingredients on and baked them for about 7 minutes at 350 degrees, just enough the melt the cheese. I will definitely make these again.

I didn't use flour,  vegetable oil, or oregano. I coated the baking sheet with bacon grease. I brushed on the beaten egg on one side and sprinkled with parmesan. baked for 5 to 10 minutes. turned them and brushed on egg and sprinkled with parmesan. cooked for 5 to 10 minutes. pasta sauce and mozzarella next and bake again 5 minutes or so. Next time I will cut thinner, at about 1/4 inch. The thinner ones were crunchier and we liked them that way. The thick ones were great too though! (Used this recipe to use up pasta sauce from spaghetti the night before.)

Great recipe!  I also put a slice of tomato on each pizza because I had some that needed to be used. I didn't bother shredding the cheese, just put a nice slice on each pizza.  Great way to get my son to eat vegetables.

It is not like pizza, but still a tasty substitute, even if you aren't a fan of eggplant, you will probably like these.

Good basic base recipe...I salted both sides of sliced eggplant & let set for about 30 minutes, rasiend then patted dry before egg wash dip. Used panko with dried oregano leaves, minced garlic + salt & pepper, baked 400 for 7 minutes each side.  Topped with pizza sauce, canadian bacon pieces, mushroom pieces, fresh shredded mozzarella and parmesan, oh I added about 1 teaspoon of oregano leases 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic to the parmesan, baked another 20 minutes. Very GOOD! Next time may cut the eggplant just a little thinner....

I had extra eggplant and wanted to do something different. This turned out really great! The whole family loved it. Super easy to make.

I started a very low carb diet and was looking for a "pizza" option and this was great!  Didn't give 5 stars just cause I really wanted to follow the recipe exactly but was cutting as many carbs as possible.
So, I coating the pan in olive oil and just dipped the cut eggplant slices into just eggs (no flour).
I also skipped the tomato sauce altogether.
Everything else was as the recipe suggested, I added more mozzarella cheese (love cheese, nice and stringy) and a piece or two of pepperoni on each piece.  Ate a whole eggplant to myself...yummm..

thanks for sharing!

I love how easy this is to make and how its durable for a couple days in the fridge afterward. Some folks have complained that the eggplant is a bit bland. My solution? 

1) I like a little kick to my italian so I just just a wee bit of red pepper flakes to the flour mix. 

and 

2) I very lightly oiled the baking sheet and then put down salt, pepper, garlic salt and italian seasoning before laying out the eggplant and making the pizzas. The mixture helps eggplant absorb a more authentic italian taste while it bakes

Yum! I didn't have pizza sauce so I just subbed tomato sauce with an Italian seasoning and garlic and onion powders. My apprehensive hubby liked it a lot. Definitely going to make this again. :)

I prepared as written and it was good. Make sure you shake off any excess flour before frying. The eggplant was fairly flavorless (and since I am not an eggplant fan that was a good thing). The eggplant was soft, which I like.  I also prepared again and added pepperoni by quartering pepperoni slices and putting them under the cheese.  Added a nice flavor and I preferred it that way.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and floured, egged than dipped in breadcrumbs, which gave it a nice texture. 

I'd definitely make this recipe again because it is so adaptable to what you have in the fridge, simple and tasty!

These eggplant pizzas were SO good! My partner and I both loved them and will make again! The eggplant practically melted in my mouth. I put more seasonings in the flour mixture for flying the eggplant which I think really helped. I also chopped up onions, bellpeppers, and salami to put on top of the mini pizzas. I also used the shredded Mexican 4 cheese blend instead of mozzarella because that's all I had. DELICIOUS! Will definition be making this again!

Having never been one to like vegetables, I am trying new recipes and this was my first eggplant. I figured pizza would be a good start. I didn't use flour but I used panko bread crumbs which I mixed as indicated and also added garlic. I used tomato sauce with garlic and a bit of sugar and basil and used Monterrey jack cheese since I was out of mozzarella. It wasn't bad. Keep in mind, I hate vegetables.I will make and eat this again. It was a tiny bit bland though, nothing a little salt and more tomato can't fix.
