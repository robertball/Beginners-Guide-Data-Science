Wasn't a big fan of the tumeric tast with the okra, but my husband enjoyed it.  

Almost as simple, I just shake the okra in a bag w/ flour and seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder, soul seasoning) to taste.  It's easy, fast, delicious and allows for full okra flavor.

Simply, easy to make okra recipe, exactly what I was wanting.  Flavor is simple and mixture of onions adds to the dish.  Recommended for something quick and easy.

I did not really care for this recipe.  I was not familiar with tumeric and did not realize that it would turn the onions a yellow color.  It just was not pretty.  Taste was ok, but overbearing for the okra.

No flavour.  Wouldn't be too bad if you add more spices.

Very bland, cooking time was no where near enough.  They tasted undercooked.  Would not make again.

It was very interesting, I didn't like the taste. It was fun to make though.

No turmeric. Instead of butter, used non-stick to cook the okra and onions, then sprinkled with Molly McButter. Turned out great!
