I thought this was going to be very sweet with the orange marmalade and tomato soup, but it's not.  I only made 3 pork chops because it was only me and hubbie eating tonight.  I used reduced sodium tomato soup and 1T sesame oil.  This was really done in no time and tasted like a lot of time and effort went into making it.  Next time I'm going to double the crushed pepper flakes.  Didn't have any rice but I paired this with the "sesame green beans" also from this site.

This was pretty tasty. It didn't say, but I seasoned chops with salt & pepper before browning. I also added a clove of garlic at the end of browning, and a tablespoon of soy sauce to the glaze. Like others I halved the sesame oil to 1 tablespoon as I find it too strong for my palate.

Worked for me!  Anything that is this quick and easy, made with ingredients on hand, and tasty as well is gonna get 5 stars from me.  After a while I removed the chops and cooked down the sauce to thicken it - we're low carbing it these days and skipped the rice.  Oh, I didn't have sesame oil so substituted chili oil instead. Again, a great meal!

I too cut the sesame oil in half and even then was concerned the nuttiness would be overwhelming.  I opted to focus on the orange flavor by adding some orange zest and a bit more red pepper.  At first taste, the sauce was curiously bland - I was seriously concerned about this dish!  But in the end, it produced a beautifully glazed pork chop that everyone enjoyed.
