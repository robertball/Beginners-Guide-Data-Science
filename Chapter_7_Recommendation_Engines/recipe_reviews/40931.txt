This pie tasted great, but I must have done something wrong.  The top layer was too runny and I let it set overnight.  I've only made it once, but I will try again to see if it's any better.  An option would be to spread it in a rectangle cake pan with homemade crust and spoon out the dessert or maybe try making with a springform pan--my deepdish pie pan was too small for this.

Took this to Thanksgiving dinner and got raves.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  However, I would suggest using the larger crust.  I couldn't get all the topping on this and I followed the recipe exactly.

Good recipe.  The Vanilla and Pumpkin flavours blend well together.  The Vanilla isn't too overpowering.  Because I didn't have the spices on hand, I used 1 3/4 TSP Pumpkin Pie Spice instead.  I also used a 9oz Pie Crust instead of 6oz and it filled the crust to the brim.  Everything still turned out fine.  Tastes better the next day.

This was excellent, I would just have the bottom layer more cream-cheesy....a little too much cool whip tasting.

I wanted to test this recipe before Thanksgiving, in case we didn't like it. As it turns out, however, we all decided this is better than the traditional pumpkin pie!  It's much lighter and creamier...although I think I will add a touch more sugar next time (personal preference).  I may not be able to wait until Thanksgiving to make it again!

Very good, but rich.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it made way too much of the pumpkin filling.  Also added allspice and nutmeg as I do my regular pumpkin pie.  Good for the folks who don't care for regular pie.

I have been makinig this pie for years, since the recipe first came out. We love it! I have never been a fan of pumpkin pie, but I love this pie! The reviewers who said it was runny etc. must have done something wrong, maybe added too much pumpkin? I have never had a problem with this pie turning out, and eveyone always raves about it and asks for the recipe.

This is great recipe for kids to make. No cooking and instant results. It is a great quick dessert to help satisfy a cheesecake craving. I usually use 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1 cup just to help make the texture a little firmer.

This year i didn't want to hassle with baking a pumpkin pie.  I found this recipe and will never go back to the "Traditional" pie again.  It was easy to make; NO BAKE!!!! and the taste was out of this world! Absolutely the NEW TRADITIONAL PIE for the holidays (and every day for that matter)!

This was TERRIBLE.  It looked like a pile of slop.  It was runny and I followed the recipe to a T.  I consider myself a decent cook, this looks nothing like the picture.  If you want a good pumpkin dessert like this...check out the cream cheese pumpkin dessert on this site...its great.

I thought this was gross. The top was runny and the unbaked flavor of the pumpkin just wasnt what I was expecting.

I've made this pumpkin pie for years.  The recipe has been printed many times in women's magazines around the holidays.  This is our favorite way to have pumpkin pie!  Top the slices with more Cool Whip (called non-dairy whipped topping in the recipe) and you're set to go!

From a retired Baked: this is by far the best and the quickest way to put a pie together. This is an excellent Pie

Not bad tasting for what it is.  It was simple, quick and easy.  Set up fine, but there was just something unappealing about the appearance for me.
