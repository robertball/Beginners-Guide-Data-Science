Overall this is a good recipe but it was a little hard to follow. I recommend having all of your ingredients out and measured beforehand to help simplify. It needed more sesame oil flavor in my opinion so I would tweak that next time. I would also wait until the very end to put in the rice. I much preferred  the look of it when it was first put in and barely tossed with some of it still being white. Overall a good recipe and one I would make again with a few minor tweaks.
