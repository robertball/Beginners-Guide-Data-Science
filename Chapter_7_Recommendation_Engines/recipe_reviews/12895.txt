This soup is fantastic. I've been making this for a couple of months now. The only reason I'm giving it four stars (not 5) is because I've made lots of additions based on other user recos.  It's a great place to start. I  use a total of 10 cups liquid - a couple cups water, 1 c. wine, and the rest chicken broth.  I add 1 onion, 4 cloves garlic, 3-4 stalks of chopped celery, 1 TBS. curry powder and a bay leaf to the broth for flavor. I also add lots of veggies. I add 1 cup each frozen corn and peas, squash and yesterday I added sweet potato and butternut squash. 
The pearl barley makes it and absorbs a lot of water! It's very hearty and so healthy!

I don't know how such a simple recipe can be soooo delicious, but it is!!  I used Italian-seasoned ground turkey, used chicken broth, and added some garlic granules.  I also cut the water back to 6 cups to keep it thicker.  I don't know if there's a difference between pearl barley and regular barley-but having used the regular before, I knew 1 cup was way too much-so I added only 1/4 of a cup.  Perfect flavor-even without onion or celery which I feel has to be the base for any soup/stew.  Very thick and yummy!

This recipe needs FLAVOR!  And less barley because it seems to take over the soup!  I'll try this again but with more vegetables and less barley.  Definetely more spices too.

Quick and easy but not great tasting.  It's not bad but all the ingredients are bland so all the flavor comes from the bouillon.  I'd describe it as average tasting.

Yummy!  I used 4 cans reduced sodium beef broth instead of the boullion (personal preference) and also added 1 can drained green beans, and ~1&1/2 cups each frozen corn and peas.  Makes a ton, freezes well, and tastes delicious.  Good old fashioned (healthy with the turkey!) vegetable soup.

Great beginning. Taking advice from others and knowing our taste buds I made the following changes which makes this soup a keeper for us! Browned turkey in large pot with garlic, onion, fresh sage and thyme and Italian seasoning.  Added 2 of each: white potatoes, sweet potatoes, celery and carrots. Created broth by adding 5 C lo-sodium chicken stock, 2 C lo-sodium beef stock, 1 C white wine. Added 1 bag of shredded cabbage (white and red mix), 1 cup pearl barley. Brought to a boil, lowered heat, covered and simmered for 1 hour. Served with freshly grated parmesan cheese and crusty bread. Oh so good.

I thought that beef broth with turkey might be weird, but it just wouldn't be as good any other way!  I followed the recipe to a T,but I think next time I will add onion and mushrooms, because to me few soups are complete without them.  Beyond that, I won't use boulion cubes again.  It gave good flavor, but was WAY too salty for my taste.  It cooked really fast for me.  By the time the barley was cooked the veggies were over done.  It was still fantastic.  I will most deffinetly make this again!

Delicious.  However, the barley needs the entire hour along with the vegetables - 15 minutes was definitely not long enough.  I seasoned the meat while browning it, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is just the thing for cold days!  With turkey, barley, potatoes, carrots and an entire head of cabbage, this is an incredibly healthy meal.  I imagine it can seem bland to someone used to spicy foods, but everyone in my family loved it, even the toddler.  It is even better the next day.  The barley does absorb the broth as it sits, but I don't see this as a problem!

I used the exact recipe and found it to be delicious.  My niece loved it too.  The following day it was still good, especially with a splash of sour cream on top.  I will make this again.

very delicious, however i made some changes to make it more flavorful. I used about 13 c of water, 1.5 lb meat and extra veggies. To the water I added a couple tbsp of italian season and 1 bay leaf, and 10 tsp bouillon powder. Then to the turkey i added about 1.5 tsp garlic and a couple tbsp basil. Since I didn't have barley, I used brown rice. I cooked it with about 1/2c less water than usual and added it about 10 min before serving. Also I added finely chopped white onion to the bowls when serving. It doesn't add a real strong flavor, but gives a little crunch with every bite. My family loved it, my husband ate 2 big bowls.

Excellent soup.  I made it according to LC Debra's guidelines (more veggies, 3-4 cloves garlic and 10 cups liquid comprising of one cup wine, a couple of cups of water, the rest being broth -- I used Better Than Bouillon beef base).

I also omitted the potatoes -- I try to keep things low glycemic, and while barely is good, potato isn't.

To save time, I prepared this with my pressure cooker.  (a) I cooked the barely (in the liquid) on high for 15 mins while (b) browning the ground turkey in a separate pan (adding onion and garlic for for last part of the browning).  Then (c) I quick-released the pressure cooker, added the cabbage and turkey/onion/garlic mix, and then (d) I pressure-cooked on high for 6 mins.  Then (e) I added one cup each of frozen peas and corn.

It made about 7 generous servings.

I changed up the recipe just a little bit. I used chicken base instead of beef boullion cubes. Didn't have cabbage so I added green beans, celery and corn. I made the ground turkey into a meatloaf mix with onion that I put in my mini food blender. I then used a small scoop to drop the meatballs into the soup. Wife LOVED it.

Flavor as-is is very bland, but a solid start.  The nutrition is there.  I had to add a lot of italian seasoning, garlic powder, a touch of sage, a bay leaf, and some pepper for flavor, along with a half onion, diced, and 3 stalks of celery, diced.  I also added in the juices from cooking the meat, which I flavored with pepper, italian seasoning, and garlic powder.  I'm not impressed but my daughter asked for leftovers in her lunch, so I guess it turned out okay.  Still, I had to stray from the original recipe quite a bit to achieve what flavor I got.  **Also, per other reviewer's suggestions, I cooked the barley for the entire hour along with the other vegetables, and I had to add more broth during cooking.

I found the recipe to be very easy and with a few modifications of my own, it was an AWESOME dinner. I used kale instead of cabbage, small yukon gold potatoes instead of regular ones and I added celery. When I cooked the turkey I first sauted an onion with some garlic and olive oil to flavor the turkey. I did everything else the same. My family loved it!

On of my favorite soups!! My friend made it and substituted yams in the place of sweet potatoes and broccoli for the cabbage and omitted the barley. She did not have many ingredients but this recipe was a great foundation. This soup was yummmy!!

I had higher hopes for this soup. It was much better after I added a couple of flavorings. I added a badly needed 1/2 cup of chopped onion. I also added a chopped celery stalk and some garlic powder and black pepper. Without those added things, the broth more or less tasted like potato water. I did use quick barley, because it was what I had. My rating is based on the soup, as is, even though I could partially save it with the changes. I also added parmesan cheese as a garnish, which went well.

Ok, I have been making this soup for about two years now. I have made it exactly as written, as well as with a few variations and I like it both ways. Personally, I prefer broth over the water & bullion.  I also make it all in one pot by browning the turkey and then adding all the broth and veggies to that pot.  A note about barley: if you use quick cooking barley there isn't any problem with the proportions or cooking time, as some have noted.  Of course, adjusting a soup to the consistency of your preference by adding more liquid is perfectly reasonable.  This soup is in my year round permanent rotation. If I want to make it lighter, I use chicken broth, for a richer soup I use beef broth.  I also have been known to add whatever veggies (extra onions or mushrooms for example) that I needed to use up and I have always loved the meal. Even my three kids love this.  It is one of the only ways they will eat cabbage.  My husband likes to add hot sauce, I like to garnish my bowl with Parmesan, you can do a lot with this. This recipe is a gem!

I used this recipe as the "base" for my turkey soup... I added 1 cup of white wine, 2 cups water 8 cups chicken broth. I used a couple of large garlic cloves, basil, parsley and onion to taste. I added cubed potatoes and chopped carrots. I browned turkey with onion soup mix and added to soup mixture to simmer. I added 1 1/2 cups pearl barley to cook for 45 minutes. ( I didn't use fast cook barley) 

Delish!

We all (5 of us) really liked this recipe! I didn't have any barley, so I used quinoa and added it about halfway through the cooking time. It takes a little longer than barley to cook, but it was so good! Also I only used half a cup of quinoa and that was plenty!

I agree with other reviewers, a few little tweaks and this is an amazing soup.  I added 1 onion, 2 cloves garlic and a few bay leaves, and more water.  I also substituted about 3 C of the water with some home made beef stock I had on hand.  It was so good my mom and I both ate 2 big bowls of it.

I used "Better Than Bullion" chicken bullion for the 8 cups of liquid. I added 1 tsp of sage, 2 tsp black pepper, a bay leaf and 1 tsp Italian seasoning to the soup while it cooked. I added a little pepper and thyme to the turkey while I browned it. I threw in 3 red potatoes too. 

It was very, very good. Fresh, crisp flavor and so healthy. I will make this again very soon.

My family and I loved this recipe.  My 7 year old is pretty picky and she loved it!! I did alter the recipe--instead of adding the cabbage I added celery. This was simply because I did not have cabbage and did have celery.  I did not add barely, but cooked egg noodles to serve in the soup. I feel could be called a stoup ( a soup and stew combo).  This will be a go to recipe for the upcoming cold Chicago winter!  Thanks for sharing!

It's a good start, but needs flavor, so I'm rating it a 3. In my kitchen, I reduce the barley to 1/2 cup, increase the turkey by 1/2 pound. Add about 5 Bay Leaves lots of pepper and some salt. Also reduce the bouillon cubes to 4. And increase water to 9-10 cups. Also, add barley 20 minutes into cooking not 15 minutes before it's done.

Pretty good overall. After reading reviews that the soup was a little bland, I added some things to jazz it up:  1 onion & 3 stalks celery (diced) lots of parsley ground black pepper chicken stock instead of water Vegeta instead of beef bouillon  Only had 3 small potatoes but it was plenty, and didn't add the barley because didn't want/need the extra starch.    Turned out delicious and both my husband and I loved it.

This is a great base! Unfortunately I am reviewing this recipe after I changed some of the ingredients, but only out of necessity. I used chicken buillon instead of beef, rice instead of pearl barley, and cauliflower instead of carrots and cabbage. I still used ground turkey and potatoes with the skins left on. This was fantastic! Great idea for a soup. To spice it up, I used garlic granules, onion powder, lemon pepper and some curry powder. Thank you for a great idea!

I added a cup of white wine to this soup and substituted chicken broth (NO MSG!) for some of the water, and skipped the bouillon.  I also added fresh grated ginger and increased the recipe to serve a small group.  I added a bay leaf and this time I put in kale, as well as a bit of olive oil and dried oregano during the browning of the turkey.  Liked the barley, it really rounded it out.  This soup is delicious.

This was so good! I didn't cook the veggies for as long and had to cook the barley longer. I also salt and peppered the ground turkey, sprinkled it with a little poultry seasoning, and browned it with a half an onion and some celery to give some more flavor. My husband is excited because it's a hardy soup (his favorite kind). I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

This was really good.  I didn't use the complete amount of beef bouillon and it still was very tasty.  We actually used very lean ground beef instead of the turkey and I think that helped add a little flavor.

I substituted a vegetable based bouillon, rendering a surprisingly delicious pot of soup. Sadly, I forgot the barley and it didn't dawn on me until I was two bowls into it. Even so, this recipe really hit the spot on a rainy day.

Although a lot of people have suggested changes, I decided to stick to the basic recipe for starters.  All three of my children (ages 9-16) enjoyed this meal which was surprising since it included cabbage.  My husband is a very picky eater and he enjoyed it as well.  Leftovers were even better.  I've already added it to my list of go-to soups.  Thanks for sharing!

I had a package of ground turkey and needed to use it....saw this recipe and love it!  I added onions and some spices because some of the reviews said it was bland.  I don't think so at all....great for a cold day~

I made a double batch of this as I have some pretty hungry people in this house.  I didn't need double the water or bouillon and I didn't need as much potato or cabbage.  I only made 1/2 cup of barley.  I also put in a little bit of green beans that I had leftover.  I seasoned my turkey with oregano, seasoned salt, and parsley.  This recipe seems pretty adjustable and I really loved how it turned out.  It was delicious!

This recipe didn't call for anything very flavorful, so I added plenty of onion, garlic, celery, and curry powder.  It was okay, but not a big hit.  We didn't finish the leftovers.

This recipe is really, really good.  Before reading this receipe, I would have never thought to use ground turkey in a soup and I had never used barley in anything.  Now I've made it twice, both times with chicken bouillon rather than beef (personal preference).  I definitely recommend seasoning the ground turkey when you brown it.  Also, I add chopped onion and celery to mine and when I add the barley, I also toss in some chopped zucchini.  Hearty and can warm you up from the inside out!  Will be making this again...very soon.

Delicious! I did change this up a bit however. I used 2 cups of water, 1/2 cup of cooking wine and 7 cups of chicken broth. I cooked some onion in a frying pan before adding the ground turkey. I added celery and a bay leaf to the pot as well, along with 1 teaspoon of curry powder. I didn't have pearl barley so I added chicken and garlic Rice-a-Roni along with it's seasoning and plenty of black pepper. It turned out great! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing it Tammy!

This recipe was GREAT as a starting point for me. With that being said I made the following adjustments. I used 2 cups of White Wine, 3 cups of Chicken Broth (2 cans made 3 cups), 5 cups of Water for a total of 10 cups of liquid. I also added 2 Bay Leaves, 1 Onion, 3 Cloves of Garlic, Thyme, Oregano, and 3 Stalks of Celery. I added half (8oz.)a bag of Frozen Mixed Vegetables (corn, peas, beans, carrots) when there was 20 minutes left in the cook time, and I added my Barley at the last 15 minutes of cook time. The flavor was excellent, my family loves it. I served it with Garlic Texas Toast.

This soup is really good. I would use less bouillon cubes since 8 cubes turned out really salty. the pearled barley was different in my recipe box, but I think I will be making this again. :) Very good mix.

This was good.  I used chicken broth and added extra water.  Reduced the amount of barley and added oregano and parsley.  Still needed more flavor.  The meat had some flavor since I browned it in garlic as some other reviewers suggested.  Next time: More seasonings!

Great base recipes. I used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of water and the bouillon cube, added onions, garlic, and a bunch of spices (bay leaf, thyme, basil, rosemary, more garlic, salt). I seasoned the turkey with these as I cooked it as well. What really made this taste amazing was sprinkling a little shredded romano cheese on top - created a fantastic combination of flavors.

WONDERFUL!
I didn't have ground turkey, so I used ground beef. I sauteed the ground beef with 1 onion (chopped) and 4 garlic cloves (pressed). I added sliced celery and substituted barley with elbow macaroni as I was out of barley. I also added a pinch of oregano, basil, 2 bay leaves, and a shake of salt and pepper for taste. 
My kids LOVED it!

Great Soup!  
I left out the barley and added a little ditalini pasta instead.  Everyone enjoyed it. Definitely a keeper.
Next time I will add other vegetables and maybe a little jalapeno.

This was REALLY yummy! i didnt have any cabbage so i left that out and the barley. I chopped a small onion and added to the broth. I added Italian seasoning to the ground turkey, since ground turkey doesnt have much taste. My husband took one bite and said oh my. A+

Loved this soup with some alterations I made just because I can:  - used ground beef instead of turkey (my grocery store in the small town I live in was out.  I live in Chicago)  - used Swanson beef broth  - added a diced onion  - omitted the barley (yuck)  - added 1-2 cups white wine (yummy)  - threw some dried spices in (maybe sage, garlic powder, possible others?) I loved this simple, flavorful soup - it gets better the day after you make it too!

Anything my picky preschoolers will eat without a fight gets 5 stars from me.  I made it exactly to the recipe with the exception of adding the barley in at the beginning.

Barley needs full hour to cook.  Otherwise very healthy, easy, fast, and good.  I did everything in the same pot for simplicity. addendum: Second time I was pressed for time.  Put barley in pot with water immediately to start cooking.  Then added other ingredients.  I sauteeed onion, celery, and ground turkey and added it to pan.  Did need more liquid so I used chicken stock. Did not use all the bouillon cubes.  Did add oregano, thyme and garlic powder. No potatoes since I didn't have any.

This is a great recipe however I did change a few things in order to watch my diet.  I cooked my meatballs in the cooking spray instead of oil.  Then instead of the 1 egg, I used the equivalent in egg whites.  I instead of water I used beef broth and I didn't have any celery so I used green pepper.  This is a great soup and I will be making this again.

Delicious soup...I added mushrooms.  Didn't have any barley, but I did put in a bay leaf while the soup simmered and added a little bit of butter.  My husband liked it, so I will make it again.

This is a great basic recipe to use as a base. To give it more flavor I add a couple tablespoons of minced garlic, two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, some onion powder and garlic salt. I also use 4 cups of beef broth and 4 cups of water. Today I added mild sausage instead of the ground turkey. It was great!

The base for this recipe was nice, especially since I love turkey, and I love playing around with soups.  I did make a lot of modifications though: I added 4 cups beef broth, 2.5 cups red wine, and 1 cup water.  I added 1/2 tsp herbs d'provence (this is like a mix of rosemar, oregano, and some other herbs), 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp chardonnay sea salt.  I added 3 celery, about 1.5 cups quartered zucchini, 2 cups chopped green beans, 3-4 carrots, and 2 potatoes quartered - I kinda wing it on my measurements of veggies, the more the better. I then sauteed the turkey with garlic and a sprinkle of cayenne.  And added the barley for the 15 minutes but it probably needed 20.  I will be making this again, but my rating is for the soup with my modifications.  If I had made the original recipe I probably would've given it 2.5/5 since it sounds bland/salty.

I tried this soup because I was looking for a soup recipe to use up some ground turkey, which my husband wouldn't eat. I thought he might not mind it in soup. It sounded a little too simple to be good but I made it as written. Having used barley before I assumed the 1 cup must mean already cooked barley which worked out great. I couldn't resist throwing in a bit of dried onion and a clove of garlic whole. I made it the night before and reheated it with dumplings.  We finished up the leftovers tonight and my hubby said ,"you have to make this soup again! In thirty years he has never said that before!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but if I were you I'd add 10-11 cups of water instead of the 8 cups it says too. It just was really salty with only 8 cups. But other then that it was really easy to make and prep and not to foget sooooo delicious!

This is a delicious, versatile and very satisfying soup. I rarely use cabbage, but, in this instance, it actually "made the meal". A sprinkling of Parmesan cheese upon serving made it perfect (shredded cheddar, mjack or colby, or a slice of American melting in each bowl would go well, too). Beef cubes (or canned broth) will make this soup "heartier" than its chicken counterparts, but either will produce a great soup. Leftover cooked turkey or chicken can be substituted for the GROUND poultry. One of the things I REALLY like about making soups is that, if you actually think about it, "anything goes".  And, in most instances, whatever you do, the end product will taste WONDERFUL! (reduce the liquid and call it a STEW)

WOW!  My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used chicken bouillon instead of beef and added onion, mushrooms, and canned corn.  Also added 2 tbl curry and some minced garlic.  I didn't have any barley, but I will try it next time.  Great hearty soup.  This recipe was great left over and it freezes well too.  This recipe will become a regular in our home, especially when it is cold out.  Thanks for sharing.

Made a couple changes didn't have cabbage but had red bell pepper. The pepper gave the soup a real nice flavor. Cut down on the bullion cubs like suggested by others.

Very nutritious but bland and uninspiring. Good for convalescence or institutional use. Even with doing what others have done and adding onions, garlic and celery don't turn it into a dish that grabs attention.

This was delicious! I made as instructed, just added some Italian seasoning (2 tbsp.) and garlic powder (1 tbsp.) because of the earlier suggestions I read. I also put the barley in for the full hour, and it was perfect. I will definitely make it again!

I took advice from others and added all sorts of veggies, including sweet potato, fresh green beans and cauliflower rice. Did well in the crockpot. I added quinoa and one bag of instant potato flakes which thickened it up nicely. Will make this again for sure!

I sauted the turkey meat with a package of chili seasoning mix before adding to soup pot. Also, omitted barley and potatoes and added brown rice and chopped fresh tomatoes along with the carrots and cabbage. Also, added chopped fresh cilantro. Served with sliced fresh avocado on top.

The basics of this recipe inspired me to make this soup adding other ingredients making it perfect for a cold winter day. Added 1 1/2 cups red wine to chicken stock, 1 cup water, and 2 packets of Goya chicken & tomato bouillon powder. Was a great addition. Also took LC Debra's note and used some of her ideas too. Did not use potatoes.

Add an onion. Or three. Also, I use vegetable broth instead of the bullion cubes. These changes make this a very flavorful soup in my opinion. I've been making it for years now.

This was so good! The only changes I made were to use sweet potatoes instead of regular ones and I seasoned the meat as it cooked. This is already a family favorite!

It's a good base. I changed it up a bit. Sauteed 1 chopped onion, 3 celery ribs (chopped), & 2 carrots (chopped) in a dutch oven with salt & pepper, then added the browned ground turkey, 3 beef & 3 chicken bouillon cubes, 1.5 tbsp italian seasoning, 1 tbsp thyme, 1 tspn sage, 1 tspn cayenne, cabbage & potatoes, brought to a boil then reduced to simmer for 20 minutes. Then added the Barley and 1.5 cups of chopped green beans. Let simmer for additional 40 minutes.

I have to eliminate some of the veggies. I took out the potatoes and cabbage as I'm Breast Feeding.  I added 4 carrots and 4 celery stocks. I cut up a whole onion. I add some mushrooms. 2 chicken bouillon cubes. 4 cups of veggie broth. 4 cups of water. 1 tabs of pepper. 2 tabs of garlic and 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  I added 1 cup of barley as we like it to be a bit thicker.  This is great for cold winter nights or if anyone is sick in the house.

Why on earth would you not brown the turkey first and then add all the soup/veggies to the pot?  Also, you need to add spices to the turkey as you brown it.  I took out the barley and gave the turkey a nice flare with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.  Ground cumin and allspice is also a nice touch, but it depends on taste.  I also used spinach instead of cabbage.

Delicious!  I used organic chicken broth instead of bullion and water, added a cup of white wine, fresh organic celery and carrots, garlic powder because I was out of fresh, added frozen organic green beans and used 10 minute barley from Trader Joes.  I also used a pinch of Bells seasoning left over from thanksgiving.  You can really make this anyway you want it.

It was good. Modifications: Only added 5 bullion cubes b/c of others reviews, and added onion, garlic, bay leaf, & oregano for spice. Also added some peas and corn because I did not have cabbage on-hand. Added only 3/4 cup barley. When I cooked the turkey I added some spices while browning, but it didn't matter. The broth was really flavorful with all the other things thrown in. I would have given more stars if not for all the modifications. Family liked it.
