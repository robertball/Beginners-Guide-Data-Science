The first time I have made quiche. The dough can be stretched real thin. I could see the metal of the 24 mini muffin tin I was using. I made half of them with a ton of filling and the other half without. This recipe provides a lot of filling and it is the perfect amount of filling if you fill every cup half way and stretch the dough up half way definitely.
 Cook the chorizo before using it and drain as much grease as possible.

:-) Make sure you're using mini-muffin cups rather than regular sized ones to make sure there is enough dough for the recipe!

This is truly amazing. I dipped them in a little hot hot sauce and it made them POP!! Although, they are so good on their own there is no dipping required. Man alive they went quickly. Make a double batch!! These will grace my snack table for every football game for years to come.....

These are totally awesome! Instead of making 24 minis I used a 12 muffin pan and they worked great!

Update: made 300 mini quiches for midnight lunch for my daughters wedding . All quiches eaten within 1/2 hour of being served. Other food served as well. Quiches were a super big hit!

Loved this quiche - easy to make, and a hit at breakfast club with friends! It took me quite some time making the dough cups/making it thin and if you're a perfectionist like I am, this part will take a good 30 minutes. I also used turkey bacon (which I microwaved before adding to the egg mixture) instead of chorizo sausage, and substituted fresh jalapenos instead of the green chiles. Not too spicy and has great flavor!

Measurements were way off for me.  I was able to make the dough as directed but it did not go the length expected.  I did enjoy the taste of the dough, however.  And the filling is quite delectable too.  I love making quiches but I am not too familiar with making them miniature.  I will definitely have to work on my measurements.  I only have one 12 cup muffin pan and this recipe filled just that amount.  There's no way I could stretch it to make 24.  My mistake?

Great recipe. I made it as a big pie in a pie pan. I doubled the dough, and had a little left over. I doubled the chorizo and kept everything else as the recipe says, I didn't add onions. I used diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of just chilies. We ate it with chopped tomatoes and sour cream on top. Delicious!!

I used a shortcut- I used tortillas that were cut in half and then cut to fit the muffin pan. I used a regular 6-muffin tin. So three eggs was the perfect amount. I only had to bake mine for 18 minutes and the tortilla got nice and crispy! Could be easily adapted.

This was fantastic...everyone raved about these and they were so simple to make. First time doing my own crust and it was much easier than I imagined (I've done the crustless version before).  I did substitute leftover, chopped carne asada for the chorizo and added chopped red bell pepper and spinach though.  Delicious!

This turned out perfect.  The crust was very good.  Pretty heavy on the green chilies, though.  I may half them next time.

Excited to try, but question: Is the chorizo cooked prior to adding into the egg mixture? If not, seems it would be somewhat difficult for it to crumble & distribute evenly. Thanks for the recipe!

Great flavors! I opted for a low carb version of this recipe. I left out the crust and substituted the milk with water (for fluffy eggs). I used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder and no black pepper (I don't like it). I also Left out the cheese. I didn't have sausage or green chiles so I substituted real bacon bits, used the leftover grease to sauté the onion and garlic, then served the "muffins" with Tabasco green pepper sauce. .. The egg  was fluffy and the flavor profile is great! Thanks for sharing.

It's a keeper! Everyone loved it at a recent baby shower brunch! I doubled recipe and put in a deep dish pie dish to save time. I used Jimmy Dean "Hot" sausage instead of chorizo.  I used a mexi blend instead of just jack cheese. Adjusted cooking time until it was done. Making again this weekend! Awesome Recipe!

This is a super-versatile recipe.  We are vegetarian, so we never add the meat, but I've also made this with lots of other ingredients--cheddar & broccoli, asparagus and swiss.  Everyone always LOVES them.  And I like these mini-quiche a bit better than the crustless variety.  The dough may be slightly difficult to get into the mini-muffin pans, but there's no need to be exacting.  They always seem to turn out!

This is wonderful.  I have made many mini quiches in my time and these mini quiches have a wonderful burst of flavour when you use the chorizo.  (yes I noted that these would be mini as the title states) ....  Nice!

So yummy!  My husband is trying to lose a few pounds so I’m going to try it without the crust this time.  We’ll see how it turns out.
