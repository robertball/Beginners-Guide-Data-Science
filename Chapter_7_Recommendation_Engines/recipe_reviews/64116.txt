Very good coleslaw recipe!  I used 3/4 cup of mayo & 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I have always found that to be the secret of a good coleslaw.  I did not have any celery seed, so I used celery salt.  I also added a good sprinkling of Janes Crazy Salt.  Extremely good!

The BEST and EASIEST slaw dressing I have found!  I do substitute Splenda for the sugar which works great!  Also, I'm not one to have celery seed on hand, so instead I use 1/4 tsp. celery salt and omit the 1/2 tsp of regular salt.  Very tasty.  I prefer homemade dressing to store bought as then I know what is in it AND what is not and.... if you have all the ingredients on hand anyway, why not take 3 minutes to make your own? Thanks for sharing this recipe with us. :) *shred your own fresh cabbage  and add a little grated carrot, if you have it on-hand, for a really fresh slaw and save some money too*

Try this coleslaw!  Five stars for being fast, easy and delicious.  It has a hearty taste that isnâ€™t too sweet.  I was out of cider vinegar and used red wine vinegar instead.  I made it to go with Carolina style pulled pork.  I will make this again.

This is the best cole slaw recipe I have tried to date, better than my Mom's (sorry Mom).  It's the recipe I'll be using in the future.  It had a lot of flavor!  I had a bit of trouble with the measurements though because the bag of shredded cabbage I had was only 10 oz., so I tried to err on the side of not adding enough (and if I felt like it needed something I could definitely add it later).  Some people complained that it was too creamy, I actually added a bit more mayo than called for.   However I only used half as much vinegar as called for and I'm glad - it was plenty tangy with only half the vinegar.  To account for personal taste, I would suggest starting with 1/2 the mayo and half the vinegar...let it sit in the fridge for an hour or so, then test it out.  You can easily add more mayo to make it creamier or another tbsp of vinegar to twang it up a bit later.

This coleslaw is excellent! I used celery salt instead of celery seeds & added a tablespoon of mustard. Just the right amount of tang & sweetness.

Very Yummy! I made this for my daughter's 18th birthday party and I actually had an empty bowl. That's never happened with coleslaw. Only thing I changed was the mayo. I used Miracle Whip and only 1/2cup. Personally I think you'll be sorry if you use what the recipe calls for. Waaaaay too much mayo and I might even use a little less than 1/2cup next time. Plenty of dressing when halved.

Very good flavor, but I found it had too much dressing for my taste. Next time I'll just add more cabbage.

This is always the recipe I come back to when I want to make coleslaw.  Hubby likes his slaw with vinegar.  I like mine with mayo.  This is the best of both worlds.  My mom learned to add sugar to her slaw from her grandmother.  I did cut the sugar in half though because since starting South Beach a few years back, my taste buds aren't so into sweet.  To sum it it up, this is a classic, easy recipe that suits this household.

Way too much mayonnaise!  That was all I could taste.  I tried this recipe again and cut mayo in half and added extra of the other ingredients. (except cabbage)  Much better!

As with several other recipes, I used this as a guide and mixed the ingredients to my taste. Omited the garlic and onion powders, and added everything else. Put it over some shredded cabbage and WOW, was it good. I'm not a fan of coleslaw and I even had trouble staying out of it. Chilling for an hour helps the vinegar and sugar to mingle into a very nice combination that isn't too sharp. Thanks for this recipe.

This has become my go to coleslaw recipe.  Everyone loves it.  Perfect on top of BBQ pulled pork sandwiches, but great anytime you want coleslaw.  I've shared the recipe with many, everyone thinks it is perfect.  Very quick and easy too.  You don't need to change a thing.

Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!  That's coleslaw!  Didn't have onion powder so I added green onions.  That's the flavor I was looking for!!  Thanks for sharing!

This is my favorite coleslaw! It has the right combination of sweet and tart. I use it primarily for cookouts and to top the Slow Cooker Carolina BBQ from this site. It is even better the next day. Thank you!!

This is the quickest coleslaw I ever made and it was tasty - it would get a 10 for quickness and I will remember this when I open up my mouth and say I will bring something and have little time to cook!  I didn't change a thing - thanks submitter.

Great coleslaw!  I wanted to find an easier coleslaw recipe than what I usually make and decided to try this one.  I added a little more mayo and some sour cream plus some extra sugar since we like it creamier and sweeter.  I love coleslaw recipes that have celery seeds in them.  It gives the coleslaw a nice spicy hint to it.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!  Im sure I will make again!

Great coleslaw recipe!  So fast, so easy!  I had a small head of cabbage from the farmers market and some fresh carrots, so I shredded them myself.  I  followed the rest of the recipe as written.  We loved it!  Thanks for such an easy to make recipe!

I have been making this for a couple of years now and it has remained my family's favorite! I do add 1/4 cup minced green bell pepper and always prepare at least a day in advance! In the south I've had a great coleslaw but this is right there at the top!

Very good slaw, simple ingredients and so fast to whip up. I'm sure I use more cabbage than called for but I chop up my own so I would say I use 6 cups or so. Then for my taste I prefer just a bit less black pepper.

Very close to the coleslaw Mom made.  She used raisins or Fruit Cocktail, I used Craisins.  This is a tad spicier than hers which is a good thing.  I, too, used less mayo and added some sour cream.  Yum.

I reduced the garlic powder to just a pinch and this is perfect, IMO.  I have made this several times and turns out great every time.  It is actually better after being refrigerated overnight.  I would have given 5 stars, except for my taste, the garlic in the recipe is way too much.  Thanks.

Made exactly as described and it is a very good coleslaw. I did also try other's ideas and used half mayo and half sour cream and added the cumin and cayenne to give it a kick. Great both ways and the latter has a nice southwest flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I loved the celery seed in the dressing. I used my food processor to shred some cabbage, a carrot, and some leftover broccoli stalks. I served this with a pulled pork tamale casserole. My only recommendation would be to salt the veggies to draw out water for 30 mins before dressing it so it doesn't get runny.

I thought I didnt like coleslaw until I made this one. I did swap out half the mayo for greek style plain yogurt and added a bit more pepper since my family loves pepper. It was delicious.

SOOOOO Easy, SOOOOOO yummy.  My Friends absolutely loved it (and even started spreading it on their burgers)!  The best part was how quick it was to make.  I will definately be repeating this again.  It was a little soupy at the end so I might add more coleslaw mix next time or drain of some excess after it has marinated a few hours.  Thanks for the easiest recipe that will impress your friends!

I had a bunch of cabbage and carrots so started looking around for coleslaw recipes. Here's my advice...this is a great base, but you can use what you have on hand and it'll probably still turn out great! I shredded almost a whole head of cabbage and a couple carrots. Used miracle whip in place of mayo (hate the taste), white vinegar, a half teaspoon of celery salt instead of celery seed and salt, and added a dollop of creamy horseradish (saw it in a few other recipes, liked the idea). Amazing! Can't wait for it to sit and meld together!  Btw, I usually hate when people rate a recipe that they changed, but I just wanted to help the people like me trying to use up stuff in the fridge but getting frustrated at not having the right ingredients.

Really great recipe.  I changed a few things for our tastes.  I omit the onion powder because my fiance does not eat onions, I doubled the celery seed ( I feel it gives a very fresh taste) and I add about 2 tablespoons of creamy horseradish, gives a great zip!

This was very yummy! I love coleslaw and any sort of cabbage salads, so it was especially delicious for me! The reason I didnt give it a full 5 stars was because I changed up the proportions slightly, so I didnt feel it fair to give it a full rating. Anyways, the only thing I did was halved the mayo. Im not a big mayo person to begin with, but it definitely would have been waaaay to creamy and mayo tasting with as much as it said to. Overall=very very delicious!!!

My family absolutely loved this Coleslaw.  We put it on top of hot roast beef sandwiches on kaiser rolls and it was PERFECT.  I believe it was the garlic that made it blend so well with the beef.  Try it :)

This coleslaw was excellent! I did as others suggested and used 3/4 c. mayo and 1/4 c. sour cream. I had put all of the dressing ingredients together and added a bag of pre-packaged coleslaw at the last minute. Didn't have the hour to let it chill but I have to say it was excellent anyway! Have to think that it would be even better after chilling! This is delicious!

Great recipe. I usually just buy coleslaw for convenience, but this was such an easy recipe, I will make my own from now on. I shredded fresh cabbage with my new madolin kitchen tool. I followed the recipe with the addition of 1 tbs. of Dijon mustard. Served the slaw with Maryland crab cakes, and seasoned oven baked fries. Thanks for a great Friday night dinner.

Yummers!  I used one small head of cabbage which I salted and rested in a strainer to shed out some the moisture.  Rinsed the cabbage and spun it through the salad spinner.  Used two carrots (shredded) and one small onion (finely minced), omitted the salt and onion powder.  This was the best cole slaw I have ever made.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe!  I followed another reviewers suggestion of 3/4 cup mayo and 1/4 sour cream (I used fat free) I also added one apple diced.  Made this for a family get together and everyone loved it.  Husband had me make it again the same week!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a delicious and easy recipe! I made it for a bbq and it went so quickly. I didn't have any celery powder on hand so I used a chip dip seasoning powder that I had instead. I will definately keep this in my bbq rotation.

This one is a definite keeper.  I used half Miralcle Whip and half mayo, but next time will use only MW for more zestiness.  I also diced some onion very fine and added that as well (had to make it more like mom's).  Our guests thought I should market it and I'd be rich.  I won't do that, but I will surely make it again and again.  Thanks!

I substituted reduced fat mayo but otherwise followed the recipe. It turned out great! Be forewarned though, this coleslaw is not as sweet as other coleslaws. I served it with barbecue, and my husband and I felt like the coleslaw was not sweet enough to serve with spicy barbecue. I think it would go better with fish, fried chicken, or pork chops.

It is still an excellent recipe though, and I plan to make it again.

Best cole slaw I have ever eaten! Instead of a slaw mix, I shred about 12oz of Napa cabbage and 4 oz of carrots. Napa cabbage is tons more flavorful than "regular" cabbage.

I've made this recipe many times.  I found it called for way too much mayonnaise...we like it crispy. I also  reduced the amount of vinegar to 1 tablespoon so it wasn't runny. (2-3 tablespoons of mayo is plenty ).

The dressing was exceptional, with a zing you don't usually find in coleslaw recipes.  It improves after a night or two in the fridge. I made it exactly as written.

Love this stuff.  Had no celery seed, so added celery salt and left out table salt.  Have to keep this one.  Hubby is an expert on the subject of Cole slaw, AND HE LOVES THIS!!!  Making it again tonight.  Yummy!
Update 4/1/16= tried it this time with 3/4 C mayo & 1/4 C sour cream and didn't care for it as well as the original recipe.  Don't mess with perfection!!
Update 4/10/17: You will get more dressing as this sits as the salt draws liquid from the cabbage. To counteract this you can salt the slaw, in layers, in a colander before you start. Stir it around a couple times over about 30 - 40 min., then rinse well and drain/ dry the cabbage. Hope this helps!

Very good coleslaw.  I mixed up the dressing in the morning, giving it all day to meld.  I then added fresh cut cabbage, shredded carrots, and green onions to mixture about an hour and a half before dinner.  The results were a delicious slaw that I will be making again.  It paired nicely with 'Serbian Ground Beef Veggie and Potato Bake' from AR.  
Thanks Wilemon, for sharing your recipe.

This is similar to what my mom used to make. The only differences are:  instead of sugar I use an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple and 3/4 cup of lite mayo.

Delish!  Cut back a little on the mayo.  First time I made it for a bbq, I tripled the receipe and got back an empty bowl long before the bbq was over. Now everyone request my coleslaw for major events.

Great recipe! Made it to top pulled pork. I did use 3/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream and eliminated onion powder. Very creamy and tasted wonderful!

Very good! I like my coleslaw a bit drier, so I cut the sauce in half. Thought that might have been a mistake, but after about 30 minutes in the fridge, it was perfectly creamy without being goopy. Not too tangy, not too mayonnaisey - just right! Will make again.

This is my absolute favorite slaw recipe.  The only thing I have ever done differently is to add about a teaspoon and a half of yellow mustard to the dressing and sub 1/2 tsp of celery salt for the celery seed and salt.  Always perfect!  Thank you Wilemon for the great recipe!!

This is a great recipe.  I made it with Hellman's Canola Oil Mayo to lighten it up, and no one knew the difference.  We had friends over for dinner, served it with BBQ chicken.  People went back for seconds on the coleslaw!

We enjoyed this recipe!  My hubby is picky about his coleslaw (likes it with a good amount of dressing - if you don't like so much, you may want to adjust and use less at first), but he loved this.  I did use 1/4 cup of sour cream and 3/4 cup of mayo.

Normally when I make coleslaw I use the packaged mix for the dressing but I've been having trouble finding it lately so I looked for a recipe that was close to it. This recipe is just as good and almost as easy. I do omit the vinegar and I use 2 16 ounce bags of cabbage.

SOOOO good.  This is the best coleslaw I have ever made!!  I did add a TBLSP. of minced fresh red onion, and subed some of the mayo for sour cream.  I also took the suggestion of a few others and added a little more slaw mix from another bag about half, there is plenty of dressing. Thanks for the recipe

This coleslaw is delicious!  I only made one change.  My family likes a lot of "dressing" on their slaw.  So I made 1 1/2 times the dressing.  It was perfect.  I will definately make this recipe again.

I forgot to add the sugar but didn't really need it.  I had broccoli slaw mix on hand and it was good.  I really did not like the celery seed with the mayo.  I prefer celery seed with a vinegar based coleslaw so next time I would omit it.  I loved the onion and garlic flavors.  Probably will make again but will omit the celery seed. I liked the Sweet Restaurant Slaw recipe better from this site.

The mayonnaise taste was a little too strong.  On the next batch, I reduced it slightly, and it was much better.  The seasonings work very nicely together.

The best coleslaw....the balance of sweet and tangy and creamy is exactly right.  Chopped two cloves of garlic and thinly sliced onion instead of the garlic and onion powder.  Also used celery salt and omitted the salt.  I used low fat mayo and you can't even tell the difference.  I served with slow-cooker pulled pork from this site, and my hubby said it was the best meal I've ever made!

This is a great recipe...and I'm not a huge cole slaw lover.  Make it with pulled pork sandwiches and it's great.

I used ff mayo. This is the best coleslaw i've made yet. I think I may omit the garlic or onion powder, or both. I made this with sloppy joes, and hot dogs at a party. The combination was great.

This recipe is awesome.  I prepare it everytime I am smoking meat, cooking on the grill, or frying fish.  The first time I prepared it I was out of celery seed and used fennel seed instead.  I continue to add the fennel seed to the recipie as it offers a great and flavorfull surprize.

This recipe is okay for coleslaw.  It's nothing to rave about, though, as others have here.  It's much easier, in my opinion, to just use Marzetti's coleslaw dressing and add some celery seeds and garlic (powdered or fresh).

The first time I made this, I did everything exactly and it was really good but a little runny.  I now only use about 1/2 cup mayo and 1 Tablespoon of sugar.  Whether you make the changes or not, it's a great recipe.

This is the recipe I have been looking for.  I've made this recipe several times now.  The only changes I made were putting the packaged coleslaw in a food processer to chop it into smaller pieces which also makes it less runny  and adding a little more sugar.

This is by far the BEST coleslaw I've ever eaten.  I made about three hours before I needed to serve it and the flavor blended together very nicely and I'm making it for the third time today.

Very good coleslaw indeed! I used light mayo and didn't have lemon juice, so I used cider vinegar instead. I liked the celery seed flavor in this one. I couldn't even taste the garlic. I'm keeping this recipe on file.

Excellent Slaw, Wilemon! We like to use
fresh from the produce stand. Finely chopped carrot, onion and celery make a nice addition. I'm not sure what the bagged mixes contain. I used half the sugar and felt that this was the perfect dressing for our tastes. Thanks for sharing.

Great coleslaw recipe! I don't normally use bagged coleslaw, but this recipe was fabulous! The dressing had just the right amount of everything, not too sweet not too tangy.  I didn't have much luck getting the boys to eat this but then again they never have liked coleslaw! Can't wait to make this again!

This is my favorite coleslaw, quick and easy, and tastes great!  The longer it sits the better it is.  I make it in the morning and it is ready for supper time.  I get many compliments on this recipe.  Thank you for posting it.

I like homemade coleslaw dressing SO much better than the kind you can buy in a bottle! I usually have a cabbage and some carrots in the refrigerator so can throw together this salad in five minutes to have with dinner. I don't add more than a pinch of the onion and garlic powders because I think it tastes a little too much like Ranch dressing then.

This recipe is very good and holds up very well.  The dressing was just right and didn't get runny at all.  Even my husband who doesn't like creamy coleslaw thought that it was good.

This coleslaw was really good - the only problem I found (and it is the case with most coleslaw's I've made lately) is that when I serve the slaw, the "sauce" has turned very runny.  So I think if I do make this again, I will add the sauce just before serving.

I usually make the recipes as I see it, and then if it need variations, I'll add after my first try.

I was a little hesitant about this recipe (with all the sugar and cider vinegar), but when I made it, it was the best I've ever tasted.  It seemed like it needed a little milk to make more dressing... BUT I didn't and after covering it and keeping in the fridge for a few hours - the dressing multiplies by itself (salt draws out the natural moisture from the coleslaw mix itself).

It was perfect and everyone in my family gobbled up faster than you could blink an eye (including my picky husband who HATES slaw!!)

Good slaw that I modified just for me. To make a light and low cal lunch, I subbed vanilla yogurt for the mayo and sugar. Loved it "Wilemon" and thanks!

Great recipe. Ditto Nicky's review: fast, easy, delicious. I made one little change out of fear that the slaw would be too sweet. I cut the sugar to 2 teaspoons instead of 2 Tablespoons.

I liked this dressing a lot.  For those trying to watch fat intake, I made this with 3/8 c low fat mayo and 5/8 c fat free sour cream.  With the amount of sugar called for, this combination worked just fine.  I cut back vinegar to 1 T and added a couple of teaspoons of mustard.  I added probably an extra 1/4 tsp or so of onion and garlic powder.  It may seem like I made a lot of changes but they were small tweaks to a very good basic recipe.

I made it as written except used 1/2 the mayo. I could tell by photos that the recipe has more mayo than we like in our slaw. Perfect blend of flavors and texture for us. Will make again and again!

tip to whip this up even quicker! - I have a mason jar with all the spices already combined in equal parts. Then instead of measuring 1/2 a ts of each I just do 3ts of the spice mixture and add it to the mayo, sugar and vinegar (makes it easier to do half or double batches as well) 

During summer bbq season I make this at least once a week as a side dish, it is my go -to creamy coleslaw and its requested often by my family. I usually make mine heavier on the spice blend with less sugar as my family's personal preference.

I make this all the time and it is always a hit.  To change it up like my favorite restaurant did, I have added pineapple tidbits.  I've also added some jalapeÃ±os for a slight kick. It doesn't get better than this recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

This dressing is perfection. I make NOOOOO changes. Unless weâ€™re doing keto, then I sub the regular sugar for erythritol. But follow this recipe and it will be the best tasting coleslaw. Love love love. I use it all the time! The celery seed in it is like a secret ingredient. Itâ€™s sooo good! Make this! I buy the ingredients for slaw - shredded carrots, a green and red cabbage and chop those up! Delicious. Everyone loves it. I hate coleslaw but Iâ€™ll eat this any day!!

Made this several times with each being a success.  For some (likely health) reasons I tried with Safflower mayo and I like this version alot!

I thought I hated coleslaw but, I LOVE this! As per some other reviewers suggestions I did make a few changes. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used white vinegar. I also added a bit of horseradish and instead of cutting back on the dressing mix I added more cabbage. I used one 14oz. bag of shredded coleslaw and added a 6oz. bag of shredded purple cabbage. I would highly suggest doubling the recipe if you want any leftovers.

Love it just the way it was written, it was very delicious. I wish people would make their own page with their own way of making the recipes instead of saying , "I made it like this because I dont like.. I made it like this because my husband doesnt like... I used so and so because..... If it sucked as written then vote that way.  But otherwise vote on the recipe the way it was written and you followed it exactly.

Iâ€™ve made this several times over the last 5 years and everyone loves it.  I used Hellmanâ€™s light mayo and made one day ahead.  Right before serving,  I added a touch more sugar and salt to cut the acidity taste.

So I originally made Nanna's southern coleslaw recipe; which I found on this site and it was terrible.  I didn't want to toss the entire bowl. so added the ingredients from this recipe to the previous coleslaw mix.  It is actually very good, and it saved my coleslaw.  I didn't have cider vinegar so had to use white vinegar, don't know if the vinegar made a  big difference or not, but this is definitely worth keeping and making again! Thanks very much for sharing and saving my coleslaw!

This is the cole slaw recipe I was looking for and didnâ€™t know it!  The dressing is perfectly balanced between tart and sweet....and not overly so of either. I shredded half a large head of cabbage and it matched up terrifically with the amount of dressing this recipe makes. LOVE!

Really, really great taste but became runny within a couple of hours.....didn't remain creamy.
I will follow some advice and put less sugar....maybe that will help. Otherwise, very good tasting coleslaw. I want to try again!

I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw typically.  I guess I had never had a really good one.....until now. This was FABULOUS. I  followed the recipe to a tee except that I halved it because there's just the two of us.

Another great easy recipe from this site. Took to a covered dish and all loved it. I've cooked 60 years and tried dozens of coleslaw's but this is it from now on.  Did cut Mayo back 1/4 cup and used rest with sour cream. Also Splendra in place of sugar. Made again using the Crasins Another hit

I've made this several times now.  I use 16-ish ounces of shredded green cabbage plus a little shredded red cabbage and carrot instead of the packaged coleslaw mix, but I use the rest of the ingredients as written.  Each time I've made it, my husband has proclaimed it to be "the best coleslaw he's ever had" --- and he's really picky about coleslaw!!!  I don't think I'll ever use another recipe!!!

I did not have any white balsamic vinegar and substituted dark instead. It turned out great, and just described it as muddy coleslaw.

I made this pretty much according to the recipe.  It is delicious and not too sweet.  I added a few more vegetables like shredded carrot and a little bit of red onion.  I prÃ©fÃ¨r making my own salads at home instead of buying them at the deli counter. I don't have to worry about prÃ©servatives or contamination or lack of refrigeration.  And it's so simple to do.  Why bother going to the store when you can make it better and fresher at home?

I really liked this recipe to use as a basic starting point.  I can scale it down so I can use it for just one or two servings or leave it as is to use for pot luck dinners. It has all of the seasoning you want from a great cole slaw, and you can add or subtract however you choose. It also does not drowned the cabbage. I will be using this again and again!

This is an update of my original review.  I still love this recipe but agree with another reviewer that this is better with 3/4 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 cup sour cream.  Using 1 cup of mayonnaise is too overwhelming.  For those who think this is too much dressing, you probably should just try another recipe.  This is a great recipe for CREAMY coleslaw with the above mentioned tweak.

Came out great!  Used slightly less sugar and added one teaspoon of dry mustard.  Even an hour later it got better as the moisture from the cabbage was drawn out.  Highly recommended...tastes like it came from the local deli!

I just made this for Thansgiving and it was a huge hit.  I used two bags of prepared/shredded cabbage, carrots and the like which amounted to 20 ounces so I made one and a half times the amounts for the dressing (1 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream) but the rest I followed eaxactly as written prepared the day before and it was fabulous!

I make coleslaw a lot, I have always use 1/2 cup mayonnaise or less. I used red wine vinegar and did not use regular salt a touch of celery salt. I did use the other ingredients listed. This was very good. I will keep this recipe so easy.

I have made this recipe a number of times and was never disappointed. Using a little more than half the mayonnaise makes a great side dish, but if you looking for a dressing (like for pulled pork) consider using more.

The only change I made was I didn't by a precut slaw mix. I prepared my own so that I could add as mush as needed to make sure it received the right dressing amount. Sometimes I put sriracha (1/4-1/2 tsp.) for a little something extra. We like spice in my house. This is an amazing.

Amazing. Will make again. I made it with the slow cooker pulled pork recipes on here by Livys
Mammy. I did use 3/4 cup mayo And 1/4 cup sour cream because I ran out of mayo. But everything else I did exactly as the recipe said. Delicious and super easy and we ate the whole recipe in one sitting.

This coleslaw is the perfect balance between tangy and sweet, and the spices added nice flavor. I cut the mayo in half, and it still seemed like too much.

I've made this dressing several times.  I use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 miracle whip and 1 1/2 packet of splenda instead of the sugar.   DH declared it a winner!

This coleslaw is a little sweet and a little vinegary, a perfect balance.  I prepared the dressing and added a couple of spoonfuls to 2 servings of coleslaw mix.  This will be my go-to recipe for coleslaw from now on.  Thanks for posting!

I made it this Easter and I am in love with it! And so is everyone else! I love creamy and semi sweet Coleslaw and this oen is PERFECT!!! I changed some of the ingredients such as I used 1/2 cup Mayo and added 1/2 cup sour cream, also used only 1 TBS cider vinegar because I don't like mine tangy but that is totally up to your taste!! It came out AMAZING!!! I swear  I should make it and sell it.. lol. Go a head and try this recipe you will be the star of your party group I promise!!! So glad I found it and tried it!! Thanks to the poster of this recipe he/she made my dream of home made amazing  Coleslaw come true =)

This was a fast and delicious recipe that even my kids loved. I used 20 oz. of veggies, 10 oz. bag of shredded cabbage and a 10 oz. bag of Trader Joe's cruciferous blend. I didn't have celery seed. so I subbed celery salt and omitted the table salt. I used Splenda rather than sugar due to a dietary need. I tasted the results and they were fantastic, but decided to add an additional Tbsp. of vinegar to help make the dressing go further with the extra veggies. Really, really yummy and I'll make this again and again. Thank you!

I cannot believe how good this was! I will never buy deli coleslaw again! 5 stars for the sauce...didn't have the celery seed, but it was fabulous even without it. I will get some for next time. Cut up green and purple cabbage and shredded carrots instead of the store bought bag. So easy and crisp.

I made a few of the changes suggested by others. Reduced vinegar to 1 tablespoon, substituted celery salt for the celery seed, reduced mayo to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of sour cream and added a couple of teaspoons of Dijon mustard. Huge hit, best coleslaw I've ever made.

Great recipe for basic coleslaw.  It was a little extra creamy for my tastes so I added some additional mix.  Perfect for bbq.

Awesome recipe, Wilemon...thanks for sharing! I did use 1/2 cup olive oil mayo and 1/2 cup fat free sour cream to try to cut down on added poundage (instead of using a full cup of regular mayo:) Also added chopped onion, bell pepper, and a shredded carrot. The spices were perfect!

I read several reviews and made this with a few changes, 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, added a little more vinegar and and only 1 T sugar and just a pinch of cumin at the end.  Good recipe to go by and a winner!

This was the best coleslaw I have ever had, hands down! To be fair I made some changes to fit my needs as I was using this on fish tacos. I took the recommendation of another reviewer and used 3/4 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup of sour cream, I also removed the onion powder in favor of chopped red onion, and finally cut the sugar down a little because I added 1 small chopped mango. Everyone raved about the slaw and my boyfriend even begged me to make it again! I will most definitely be making this in the future!

I used "just mayo" so it was dairy and egg free. I also used a bag of Cole slaw mix plus half a bag of finely shredded cabbage (so I can agree with those who said it maybe had too much mayo). I also had no onion powder so when I made the dressing, I added fresh onion (about 1/4 cup). I let that rest a few hours before adding it to the cabbage mix. 
I took this to a potluck along with some pulled pork my husband made and was pleasantly surprised how much was eaten. There was a ton of food there and many people told me how great it was. I think more coleslaw was eaten than pork!

I've turned this into a vegan hit! The best part is no one can tell it's vegan. I use Vegenaise instead of mayonnaise. & Splenda instead of sugar, ground Pink Himalayan salt, double the amount of pepper (more or less to your liking) & a dash or two of paprika.  I use freshly chopped red & green cabbage (cut thin) & about 4-6 oz of shredded carrots. The recipe calls for a cup of 'mayo' which seems to leave your coleslaw swimming in sauce.. So I double the amount of cabbage & carrot mix used.
One more note.. If you're familiar with Costcos Kirkland Seasonings, the Organic No Salt Seasoning Mix tastes great in this recipe!
Don't be afraid to experiment!

excellent recipe- i did reduce the amount of mayo to 3/4 c and upped the vinegar a little bit. i also always add fresh finely chopped onion and celery to the cabbage just because that's how we like it.  *final note: i make it a day ahead, its even better if it sits overnight.

This coleslaw was a-m-a-z-I-n-g!!  I have yet to find a recipe that resembles that of Smoky Bones until I found this one!  I followed it exactly, but added a dash of cayenne, as I've always felt that was what was in theirs.  Hit the nail right on the head!!!  Thank you for such a great recipe!!!!

The best cole slaw we have ever eaten, making it exactly as shown.  I use to make slaw maybe once a year at the most, now we have it almost every week, at least through spring and summer. We will see how our cravings are in the colder months, but will definitely have it with hotdogs and chicken sandwiches in the winter.
Thank you so much for this recipe! Love it, love it, love it!

I'm not a slaw expert - this is the first creamy slaw I've ever tried - but I liked it. I did sub out half the mayo for sour cream. I might reduce the dressing next time because once it sat for a day, it was very soupy. Easy to throw together!

Okay, let me tell you something:  I HATE COLESLAW.  Seriously, most of my life I've been subjected to disgustingly sweet, sloppy KFC-style messes.  My mom used a bottled dressing that wasn't any better.  I just came to regard it as something I'd always hate.  And then my sweet husband asked me to make coleslaw out of some leftover cabbage to go with Carolina BBQ.  I knew allrecipes could help me find something different.  I chose this recipe because of reviews saying it wasn't too sweet, and because of the abundance of spices.

This stuff is utterly delicious.  The tang of the vinegar perfectly offsets the sugar and all the spices add so much flavor that's missing from every other version I've had.  Four of my five kids loved it too, not only eating it straight but piling it on their BBQ sandwiches.

I might actually make coleslaw again.  More than once!  Thank you for an awesome recipe.

I don't know how coleslaw can get any better than this.  I dialed up the celery seeds a bit and, for the mayo, used about 2/3 cup mayo, 1/3 cup low fat sour creme.  Turned out fantastic.  Great tang and not too sweet.

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it. Even my husband who is not a fan of coleslaw waned seconds! I only used half cup of mayo as that was all we had left. I kept the seasoning amounts the same, but reduced the cider to only 1 tablespoon. It was just the right amount of dressing for 1 bag of coleslaw mix.

Recipe was fabulous! Literally took 5 minutes to make! I am not a fan of overly sweet or vinegary coleslaw. I thought this was perfect. I did sub red wine vinegar (because it's what I had on hand) and only used 1/2 cup mayo. Was great!!

This is the best slaw recipe I've found. I'm picky and don't like mine too sweet or oily, so I use half sour cream and half mayo, which really lightens it up. I also cut my own cabbage and shred a half a carrot and mince a half an onion. I use onion salt and reduce the salt a bit. The results are perfect.

This is great recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars because I added to it.  I like very spicy foods so I added a big pinch of cayenne pepper and a small pinch of chilpolte chili pepper.  I like to use this as my slaw topping on reuben sandwiches.

Made this so many times. Excellent recipe. I see a lot of comments about it being too much mayo, but that's why it's called CREAMY coleslaw.  My family and I love it! Thanks for the recipe !!

I used this as a good guide, but improvised according to my teachings.  I used 4-6 T vinegar, 1/2 t cayenne, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1/4 t more salt. I also did what another reviewer did and added 3/4 c mayo 1/4 c sour cream (could've substituted half).  I also added 1/4 c fresh chopped red onion.  There is too much dressing for 3/4 head cabbage, but that's okay, I'll have it on hand.   This is outta this world good!  Nuts, fruits, mini marshmallows would be a welcome addition if you're not using it to top a pulled pork sandwich.  The cayenne balances sweet nicely.

Will make again, but NOT as-is. WAY too much mayo. For a bag of slaw, 1/4 to 1/3 cup of mayo is plenty since the veggies weep.

I love coleslaw with anything BBQ and for this recipe I did shred my own carrots, green and red cabbage. I was in the mood so I minced some red onion. I added a tablespoon of horseradish to give it a little more bite.

I  used 1/2 cup mayonnaise and 1/2 cup sour cream, added two sliced scallions and reduced sugar to one TBS. I should have also reduced the black pepper to half.  It's ok but my personal preference would have been less creamy the Mayo is still the prominent flavor.

This was great one to start with if you have never made coleslaw before.  I did add 1/2 tsp of cumin, 1 tbsp of creamy ranch dressing, and 1/2 tsp of dijon mustard.  IT CAME OUT AMAZING.  Will be making this often.

I'm a slaw snob. Ever since a friend made it for me years back I find most store and restaurant offerings totally inedible. Too much mayo, or too much vinegar, never enough flavor etc.  Even my dad who never eats coleslaw decided to try it and loved it!  

My way: since I shredded the cabbage  and carrot myself I eyeballed the mayo. Didn't have celery seed so I used celery salt,  used fresh garlic and doubled the suggested amount and halved or maybe even quartered the sugar.  Will try the sour cream option others suggested next time.

We loved this recipe because it wasn't real sweet, something that usually turns me off when trying coleslaw. It was perfect on pulled pork sandwiches with BBQ sauce. Made recipe just as written and decided it didn't need anything different to be fantastic. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing! Best coleslaw ever! I used a whole head of a large cabbage and 1/2 bag of baby carrots shredded in the food processor. Then doubled the recipe adding three tablespoons of sugar and three of Apple cider vinegar to each batch. It turned out awesome and everyone bragged over it! Thank you!

This recipe was fabulous. Normally I don't like coleslaw, so when the fiance requested it to go along with some pulled pork sandwiches he was bringing to the church, I thought 'fabulous, now I have to hunt down a recipe'. Then, he went on to say that he liked his coleslaw sweet, not vinegar-y. Men are so picky! Lol ;) I started out this recipe by only adding 1/2 cup of mayo, then slowing adding spoonfuls until it was the perfect consistency. As this being my first time making coleslaw, I didn't realize how much it liquidizes while refrigerating (will probably keep it closer to 1/2 cup next time). I also didn't put any onion powder or celery seed (didn't have any on hand), and minimized the vinegar to 1 tbsp. Everybody loved it and said that it was the best coleslaw they had ever had! I was sending this recipe to quite a few people afterwards :) Enjoy!

Great flavor and creamy texture. The whole family loved it. Not watery like most coleslaw recipes.

A very nice spiced coleslaw that isn't too sweet as many of them can be. We enjoyed this one very much. Thanks so much for sharing.

So delicious! I used another member's suggestion of Â¼c sour cream Â¾c mayo. I only had red wine vinegar, so I used that. This is my new coleslaw recipe!

Absolutely perfect!  This is my ideal creamy coleslaw.  I followed the recommendations of 3/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream.  No celery seed in my cupboards, so I added a generous dash of celery salt.  Since I shredded my own cabbage and veggies, I gradually mixed in scoops of the sauce.  I have about 1/4 cup left over.  It only has too much sauce if you add too much!  Will save the excess for a veggie dip! Will make again!

I loved this recipe and so did my family, they gobbled it all up! I didn't have celery seed so I used celery salt  and followed MrsHappyHomemaker and used 1/4 sour cream and 3/4 mayo! Next time I may add some red pepper flakes for a little spicy twist!

I liked that this recipe was easy, quick and turned out pretty tasty, but I was expecting more spice. I got the kick I wanted when I omitted the celery ceed and added some Tabasco. (I also used veggie mayo instead of regular mayo).

This coleslaw was awesome! Even my daughter that won't touch slaw liked it. I used celery salt instead of celery seed and regular vinegar instead of cider vinegar just because that is what I had in the cabinet and these substitutions worked out great. It wasn't too sweet like some recipes and had just a slight zing to it. I can't wait to make it again. So easy!

Have made twice and am making again tomorrow. Yum!  Changes: chop up my own cabbage/carrots, add extra white wine vinegar to the Apple cider vin and used a bit less sugar (I'm a fan of tart vinegar dressing).

Amazingly yummy! I cut the amount of mayo and sugar but kept the same measurements for the spices. I know many don't have the celery spice on hand but it makes it so yummy-go buy it!

Just made this over Mothers day weekend. Went with smoked ribs, turkey, and biscuits. Slaw turned out awesome. Not too much vinegar, with a good, creamy taste. I put in 3/4 of the bag and let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours before adding the other 1/4 of the bag before serving for some crunch. Will be my go-to.

This is a wonderful recipe...easy, full of flavor, and my family loves it.  I made it exactly as it appears here, and so glad I did.  There is nothing to be changed unless of course you don't have all ingredients on hand. In my opinion, however, do yourself a favor and go get the correct ingredients.

Wow, I love thisâ€¦ my new favorite.  I only had maybe 1/4 c. mayonnaise left in my frig and I don't really measure, so the portions may have been a little different, but it was perfect.  I think  I put in more vinegar than called for to add to the volume of the dressing.  The combination of all these flavors is just gorgeous.  Thank you!

This coleslaw is delicious! I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect. There wasn't too much dressing or too little and the mayonnaise wasn't overwhelming! Best of all this wasn't super sweet! I don't like really sweet coleslaw but this recipe has just the right amount of sweetness. This is definitely my new go-to coleslaw recipe!

I have never made coleslaw myself and this recipe was super easy and tasted great! I made it to go with some crockpot barbeque and it was perfect.  My husband and I both thought it reminded us of the KFC coleslaw.  I will definitely be making this again!

Really good coleslaw. Used this recipe for a tailgate party - it disappeared! Have been asked to make it for a large family reunion this summer.  The celery seed and spices make it way better than the store-bought stuff, and no one know how little work it is.  They all think I spend ages in the kitchen. I adjust the amount of dressing to how soon I'll serve it.  I mix it up and add about half, and add more dressing later if necessary. Quick and easy for a crowd.

Really good!  I used a lot more cabbage than the recipe called for (because I had it and needed to use it up) but I don't like an overly heavy dressing so it worked well.   Next time I may add white vinegar to make it a bit more tangy.

The flavor was very good, but a bit "mayonnaisey".  I added cayenne pepper, sesame seeds, cilantro and some extra cabbage.

Excellent base recipe but I made some changes.  I used 3/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream and substituted 1/2 teaspoon celery salt for the salt and celery seed.  I omitted the onion powder and garlic powder as a matter of personal preference.  I added 1 teaspoon of cumin for extra flavor.  I only used 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar because I didn't want it to be overly tangy or the dressing to be runny and 1 tablespoon of sugar because I didn't want it to be overly sweet.  It turned out very good and got even better after I let it stand for a couple of hours (in the fridge of course).  The dressing has a nearly perfect texture. I'm taking it to a Labor Day cookout this evening and I am anxious to let my friends and family try it.  Very good and I will definitely make it again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Delicious!!!  I didn't have the onion powder or celery seed, so I added a touch of dijon mustard for a little kick.

So good!I used about 3/4 cup of mayo. That was the only difference I made. DH is a big coleslaw fan and he loved it.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  I would recommend using more cabbage though - I used this recipe for a whole, large head of cabbage and it was too much dressing.  I'm sure it's even more overwhelming when just using a 16 oz. bag of slaw mix.

I made this quickly one morning because I planned on having ribs for dinner that night and had some leftover cabbage to use. I didn't have celery seed or cider vinegar so used celery salt and red wine vinegar instead and it was delicious! Very quick and simple to make and so tasty. My husband loved it with the BBQ ribs - great combo.

Really good Cole slaw, not too sweet.  I think it's best to make an hour ahead to let the flavors meld.

This is a GREAT recipe and as the author states, all the flavors compliment each other. I don't know if the original author actually uses a 16 oz bag of coleslaw mix or if she just assumed it is 16 oz but my bag was 14 oz. I added just a pinch less on all ingredients including mayonnaise to make up the difference. This will always be my go to recipe for slaw from now on.

This turned out really well.  The only change I made was to use 2/3 c mayo, 1/3 c sour cream, per the other reviewers recommendations.  However, the spice mixture is perfect.  I went a little shy on the sugar at first because I do not like sweet cole slaw.  I made this the night before the party, and gave it a taste test the next morning, and I wound up adding in the specified amount because it needed the balance.  I also think the celery seed is a fantastic flavor, and really makes the dish.

I read the reviews and reduced the amount of mayo. to 1/2 cup which was the perfect amount.  This slaw is creamy and tangy and very good.  I might increase the amount of vinegar next time to give it even more tang.  Also, I enjoyed the addition of the celery seed and think a little more of this will give it even more zing.  Overall, it was very good and I will be making this again.

Delicious!  This will be my new go to regular coleslaw recipe and I'll be making it often as cabbage is so nutritious.  I still love the "Original Blue Cheese Coleslaw" from this site, but it is way to high in fat for other than special occasions.  Loved how fast and easy this one was to prepare - had it ready in five minutes!  The mix of spices is excellent, it's lower in calories than many recipes, plus I always have the dressing ingredients on hand.  
As others suggested I did cut the mayo to 1/3 cup and used about 1/8 cup low-fat sour cream.  I was out of apple cider vinegar so used rice vinegar which wasn't quite tart enough.  I also cut the sugar in half as we don't like sweet coleslaw.  I may try adding some green onions and sliced celery next time just to get more veggies included.

I was tired of my dad bringing KFC slaw to all of our parties even though it tastes pretty good.  My dad loved it and so did my boyfriend who normally doesn't like slaw.  This is the best cole slaw I've ever had, but I think I did substitute sour cream for a portion of the mayo as someone else had suggested.  I'm making this again this weekend.

Fantastic coleslaw!  I've been using this recipe for a few years.  The only changes I make are to use 1/2 the mayo and 1/2 the sugar that the recipe calls for.  In my opinion, it comes out perfectly that way.  The rest of the spices are left as-is.

Made this recipe two hours before we ate.  I was amazed - it was wonderful.  Only change I made was because I didn't have onion powder, I put dried minced onion in.  So good, I'm making it again tonght.

This was pretty good! I've never made cole slaw but decided to give it a try cause I wanted something summery & diffrent! My husband hates cole slaw & I like it but its not exactly my favorite! Well this one was pretty good! I had a 14 oz bag & did 3/4 cup mayo & 1/4 cup sour cream. I left out the celery seed (didn't have any) and used red wine vinegar instead of cider because it was what I had. Turned out great! It wasn't really runny like others complained about. It was just right in my opinion!!

I don't even like coleslaw, but this is so good!  I like to add some finely-minced green onion and I use a 1/2 teaspoon of celery salt in place of the salt and celery seed.  I also don't see the need to chill it for two hours; it tastes good right away.  Other than that, I just follow the recipe.  It's delicious!!

A really good recipe that's got a lot of flavor but is still traditional.  It won't freak out those eaters who would quickly bypass something more exotic, like (my personal favorite) ginger cabbage salad.

Hello there Wilemon, lets go ride sometime.  This recipe looks real similar to mine, so I tried it.  It was great, I did kick it up a bit with some cumin, and cayenne as I do with mine, but yours was great.  Keep the recipes coming.  Ride safe.

DELICIOUS! I used a full 16oz. bag of coleslaw mix, and still had plenty of sauce. I also add a couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar, just because I like it. 

This recipe is going into the save file for sure!

This is a fatanstic recipe Wilemon! For my own familys taste, I usually leave out the sugar and sometimes add finely chopped celery and run an onion over a grater a couple of times for a little fresh onion flavor instead of the powder. I love this coleslaw!

My family didn't care for this recipe. My daughter who has always liked coleslaw, even as a little girl said it was to bland. She said it tasted like something they would serve in a hospital.  I personally thought it was good.  My husband has never been a fan of coleslaw.  Both husband and daughter said tasted of to much mayo.  Thanks for the recipe anyways!

Made this exactly as it is written and it was great.  I did let it sit in the frig for 2 hours before we ate it.  My family loved it and it will now be my favorite cole slaw recipe and I thought I had the best recipe from one I used before.  But this one is even better.  So creamy and flavorful.

Very good.  I used broccoli slaw and added a little extra black pepper (I think it could have used even more).  Quick and easy & it went great with the ribs I made last night.  Thanks for the submission!

Delicious and super easy!  Also, after 2 days it was not really runny as some other coleslaws are.

This recipe is much better than in the bottle dressing. I used this in a pinch when my husband brought home the cabbage without any cole slaw dressing. I had lots of compliments on the full flavors. I will definately use this recipe again instead of bottled.

Super quick and easy and has good flavor. It was quite thick so I whisked in a little milk to make the dressing easier to blend into the cabbage. Thanks for posting!

this dressing is okay, it needs some extra salt for flavor, I used regular vinegar, and I think it would be better with the cider vinegar.I never use mayo as it is very bland. try miracle whip or equivalent.
