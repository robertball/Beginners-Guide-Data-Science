I had some old hamburger buns that needed to be used up so I sliced them into 1 inch strips with a pizza cutter and used them in place of the white bread.  The bread sticks turned out FABULOUS!  I would give them 5+ stars.  The bean dip was good but kind of bland.  I think it would be better served with pita chips or celery as it tasted more like hummus mixed with pesto.  I would give the bean dip 3.5 stars.
