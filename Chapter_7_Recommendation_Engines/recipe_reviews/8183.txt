I was pleased with this cake.
It was very moist, almost "gluey", with a very chocolatey flavor.  I used a mixer to beat the dry ingredients for 1 minute to aerate and fully mix (I learned this from "The Cake Bible").

This cake was perfect for my son's 2nd birthday party.  I made it and a second regular cake (it is a small cake) and everyone wanted the eggless. I used a different icing from the carrot cupcakes with white chocolate and cream cheese.  I also added more (1/4 cup) cocoa like another person suggested plus I used dark chocolate cocoa.  It was wonderful, and did not taste like it was missing anything.

Awesome recipe. I made this cake not because I'm vegan or allergic to eggs, but because I was out of eggs one day and had a sweet tooth. I'll admit my expectations were very low and I did not expect an eggless cake to be able to compare with normal cakes, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. I am so glad I did, this cake was better than boxed or any other recipe I've tried. I used this recipe again two nights ago even when I had eggs because it is so easy! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I did have to double the amount of cocoa powder I put into it.

Well I don't know how to describe the flavor.  I know what one reviewer meant by tastes like glue, for me it was like it was soapy.  The texture was great and yes it is moist.  Sift the flour, then sift all dry ingredients again together.  Add viegar last and you will get a nice textured cake, but the subtle soap flavour sort of kills it.  I would experiment again and see if I can get rid of the soapy taste.

i made it for my true vegetarian neighbors. they all loved it including my son. he said always make this, it tastes better without eggs. i went and bought cake flour. if u dont have cake flour all purpose is ok, it has the same ingrdients as cake flour. and i put regular betty crocker chocolate frosting on the cake as soon as it came out of oven so the frosting dripped down the 8x8 glass pan into cake and it was a very thin layer of frosting. the cake is sweet enough and chocolatey. ADD THE VINEGAR LAST, OK TO MIX WITH ELECTRIC HAND MIXER.   after it is mixed it very runny(watery)it looked as if it would not rise in oven but it did wonderfully.  kids really love this cake..im going to make it again tomorrow. it was fairly easy to make. COMES OUT VERY MOIST.   i sprayed the pan with pam....NOT TOO MUCH OHTERWISE THE EDGES GET CRUSTY.

This is an amazing, amazing recipe. I am a vegetarian (no eggs) and was having a hard time getting cakes right. It was really hit-or-miss. But this cake! Oh, this cake! I suddenly rocketed to cake-making fame with this cake! I have made it so many times over the past six months, and every time it is fluffy and moist and earns rave reviews. People now beg me to make cakes for them.     Notes: I leave out the cocoa if I want to make a chocolate-free cake, no problem. I make a different frosting because I am addicted to cream cheese frosting. And I have found that it rises more if I let it sit in the pan for a few minutes before I put it in the oven.     Bottom line: This cake is fail-proof, and awesome, awesome, awesome.

BEST CAKE EVER!!! I made this cake because I'm pregnant, in a baking phase and needed a chocolate cake fix! I'm out of eggs and found this recipe. The only alterations I made were  the previously recommended extra 3 tbsp of cocoa, I also had no cake flour and used AP; and to my horror I was out of white vinegar. I decided to take the chance and use apple cider vinegar which made no difference (whoo! I was going to eat it anyway)! I also added a capful (about 1/2 tsp) of vanilla to the frosting for extra lil sweetness. After poured the frosting over a still very warm cake, it looked so good and I couldnâ€™t wait any longer. I sliced a piece, and it was like eating the most decadent lava cake from the best restaurant!! I'm super surprised an egg-less cake turned out to be so wonderful; I was excited to try it out! I will most definitely recommend and use this recipe from now on, whether or not I have eggs!!

Deeelicious!  The best chocolate Cake I've ever had.  I made this recipe because my Nephew is allergic to Eggs and therefore, I searched hi and low for an eggless cake and I've found it on your website.  I added Vanilla Icing from Betty Crocker and added pink candy sparkles since I had made this cake for Easter.  It was a huge hit with the kids and big kids (Adaults) too!!!

This is very moist and is especially appealing because there are no eggs!  Using whole wheat flour worked wonderfully, and made it even healthier.  This cake is perfect with just powdered sugar on top.

We love this cake!  We skipped the icing in order to make it dairy-free for vegan guests, and baked them into cupcakes for my daughter's fifth birthday party.  Nobody believed they were vegan!  And I had no cake flour, I just used all-purpose flour and they were moist and tender and delicious, even two days later when stored in an airtight container. For reviewers who complain about too little chocolate flavor, you should really only buy good quality cocoa for any of your recipes: low-quality cocoa really ruins a good recipe.

First of all, this is the best EGGLESS cake I have eaten. Don't compare it to a cake with eggs - it is not fair. It was easy to assemble. I used a wire whisk to aerate the dry ingredients before adding the wet ingredients. I also doubled the cocoa and added the vinegar last as suggested by other reviewers. The icing made more than was needed for  the cake. This is not an overly sweet cake, but it hit the spot and satisfied the our yearning for something chocolatey and a little sweet.

I made this cake with my brother for his wife's birthday and it was fantastic!  Very quick and easy to make, and tasted delicious!  I followed the suggestions made by previous bakers and made the following adjustments to the recipe: 1) Added an additional 1 tbsp of cocoa powder.  2) Added the vinegar last, and immediately poured the batter into the prepared pan, and popped it into the preheated oven.    The only draw back to this recipe was the amount of frosting I had left over!  I only used about 1/2 of the frosting recipe and I was being quite generous (to the point that it was pouring off the cake!).  I would recommend that bakers make double the cake recipe and make a two tiered cake - one recipe of the frosting will be just enough to make a frosting layer!  Also, when making the frosting, I recommend to continue mixing/whisking the frosting for about 10 minutes.  The cocoa will eventually dissolve and you'll be left with this amazing ganache-like consistency.  It spreads on really smooth and stays glossy when warm no matter how many times your spread it. Enjoy! this one is a keeper!

I loved this recipe.  I did change it slightly...I added 3 additional tablespoons of cocoa powder, 1 tsp. more vanilla, and 1/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and hazelnuts. It was moist and delicious!  I didn't have any of that "soapy" taste two others wrote about. I found this to be one of the best recipes for chocolate cake I've had.

Batter looks delicious but the cake didn't rise much. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out raw in the middle. Sampled cake anyway... nothing special. It was kind of a waste of ingredients. I should have just gone out to buy eggs and made something else.

Very good but not great.  Substituted applesauce (regular) for oil and didn't make the frosting.  I didn't enjoy the texture -- it was pretty gooey.  Maybe it needed more than 30 minutes?

This was my first eggless cake recipe, inspired by a vegetarian/almost vegan home visitor who visited us in part to celebrate my brother's birthday.  I used all purpose flour and baked it for 45-50 minutes until the knife finally came out clean from the middle and the sides of the cake had barely pulled away from the pan.  I should have more thoroughly floured the sides as the cake broke but hey with all that good frosting, who cares! (I cooked the frosting in a normal small pan on low heat, removed it to cool a bit, and stretched it out with an extra tablespoon of butter and 3 tablespoons or so of water so it could drizzle over the cake.) We served it with pear slices and flavored seltzer water and it was great.  Our nearly vegan friend was very pleased and so was my brother!

I tried this cake twice. Per recipe, it has a VERY sticky, funky texture and barely any chocolate taste.  Modified, I added 1/4 cup cocoa and used applesauce in place of the oil.  This actually improved the taste and texture a bit, but not enough.  Frosting covers it up some, but I can't get over the texture.

this is definitely easy to make and very moist!  i made 12 cupcakes, (16 minutes in the oven).  The flavour is decent, it kind of tastes a bit bland at first, but grows on you hah.  As the other reviewers have commented, it does have a bit of that 'soapy' taste, maybe too much baking soda?   I think after you add icing, it would help.  I would also use this as a base for adding other things to enhance its flavour.

I  have had this reciept for years.It was used during the depression . And the reason I was on the computer was to see if I could find it as I lost my card. My kids love it and I sometimes put in a tablespoon of instant coffee , add nuts and what ever for changes, as it makes it a little different.

This is a really simple recipe and the cake comes out tasting great.  I only made one difference since other reviews said that it did not have enough of a chocolate taste; I added 1/4 cup cocoa to the cake instead of 3 tablespoons and it tasted fine to me.  Nice and moist!  I did not need to add frosting since it was sweet enough.

I have no complaints about this cake!  My daughter is allergic to eggs and this works great for us - I make cupcakes and freeze several of them so I can take them when we go to birthday parties and other places where cakes will be present.  They are great fresh or after being frozen.

I found this cake to be most like prepackaged cake mixes than any other I have tried.  Although I am usually a from scratch baker, I haven't found a from scratch cupcake recipe I really like that is as moist and yummy as Pillsbury or Betty Crocker...until now!  This recipe fit the bill.  I will no longer be subjected to the supermarket prepackaged cake mixes in order to prepare something that is quick, easy, and delicious.  I received rave reviews and did not experience the "glue-like" taste others noted.  In the future, I would like to try it without the cocoa and see if it passes muster as a vanilla cake, too.  If anyone tries this, please post it!

This cake was so good. I made it for my son's first birthday and it was a hit. Everyone was scared to taste, but after tasting it they loved it.

Heavenly!!  I had forgotten how good eggless cakes were.  My Mom made these often when I was a kid.  I did add 1 extra Tablespoon of cocoa & I think it is just right for chocolate flavor.  I chose another recipe for icing however as I wanted peanut butter icing, rather than chocolate.  I made the peanut butter icing recipe for the "Mayo Cake with Peanut Butter Icing" here on this site.  I left a review there as I had to tweak the recipe just a bit (didn't have the marshmallows on hand) but it came out perfect!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

This was excellent!  I did not make the frosting, I used the regular Hershey's cocoa powder frosting.  I also added an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder to the cake mix, making it 4 tbs. Me, my kids and my husband loved this cake!  Thanks!

I just didn't care for this cake. It was easy to make, and unlike some other reviewers I actually liked the texture. It was just really bland. I did like the icing though, and will use that recipe for other things.

Made this for my twin daughters 6th bday--one of my girls has egg allergies.  It was very moist but lacked flavor despite my use of high quality chocolate.  Will try again and tweak the recipe some.  Has potential just seems to  be lacking something.

I like the cake.It is moist.It is bit "soapy",but I added a bit of 1-2 tbsp  chocolate liquor (or  artificial chocolate flavor ) can fix  the problem .

Hi there, this is my first review/helpful hint, this eggless cake is great, a family friend is allergic to eggs and when I found this recipe I thought it was a god send. My family is not too big on frosting on cakes, we found that the amount of coco in this recipe to be lacking so we exchanged the amount of coco with the amount in the frosting and added 2 tablespoons more (1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons). It came out still very moist and tastes really great.

I used this cake for a homemade ice cream cake for my egg-allergic daughter's 1st birthday.  The cake tasted better than the other ice cream cake I served to the guests!

My boyfriend is allergic to eggs, and he loves chocolate, so I thought I would give it a try.  I doubled the chocolate in the cake and put a cream cheese icing on top.  I thought it was really good for an eggless cake.

I baked this cake for my son's birthday party and atleast three people asked me if  I had baked it myself.  Apparantly the children thought it was wonderful.  It was a joy to give my son something other than a very sweet chocolate crisy cake.  Thanks

Didn't like this at all. Even when it was done it seem like it wasn't cooked. . I have made many many many cakes and this is the worst one of them all. Unfortunately you need eggs. I thought I would try it cuz my kids asked me to. This is terrible.

I whipped up a batch of cupcakes(12) following the recipe for the most part ( adding a touch more cocoa and vanilla) and topped them with both vanilla icing( butter/milk/confectionery sugar/ vanilla and for chocolate just adding cocoa powder to same),
They tasted so good that my granddaughter set up all the ingredients ( since I made them with her) the next day being all were gone!
Definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this cake. I did notice I had to bake it longer than the recommended time, but that was the only thing I changed. Both the cake and frosting was delicious . I did not add any extra cocoa as others suggested; however it would not hurt adding a bit more to the cake batter to make it more chocolaty.

I think the frosting could pass as Hot Fudge on Ice Cream it was insanely good! The cake was a huge hit and I think I forgot the oil. You should try it even if you are not allergic to eggs.

I will definitely make this again. I was nervous to try it but I'm so glad because who needs eggs in cake with this recipe. I didn't even have white distilled so I used apple cider vinegar. There was not even a hint of the cider when biting into the cake. I put the vinegar in last as suggested and used all purpose flour and everyone who tried it raved about it and thanked me. It was moist and not gluey at all.

We made this cake for a birthday luncheon, and it was quick, easy and tasty! I used apple cider vinegar, didn't have plain vinegar and we enjoyed the enhanced taste. Also, I used 1/6 cup of applesauce and 1/6 cup oil instead of the 1/3 cup of oil as called for in the recipe. The cake was chewy with large air pockets, and the frosting was delicious, too. I would like the cake to have been a bit more chocolatey, therefore I gave it four stars. But I'll make this one again! It's excellent for someone with egg allergies.

I bloomed the cocoa powder by boiling the water, measuring a cup of it, and mixing the cocoa powder in there instead of with the flour. Then I used that chocolate water as specified for the regular water. I followed the recipe for the glaze but needed to add a pinch of salt and some instant coffee (rehydrated with the minimum amount of water possible). I rated it 4 stars instead of 3 because it uses inexpensive ingredients, which is a plus.  The cake is light and moist, but does not hold together very well (likely because of the lack of egg). In addition it falls dramatically after leaving the oven, leaving a well in the center of the cake. I filled this in with nuts, but it took over a cup worth to make it level with the rest of the cake. Overall the flavor is ok, except that sometimes it has a strange baking soda-y tang. Not terrible but I don't know if I would make it again or serve it for company (given that it would be difficult to decorate with the sunken center). If I were to make it in the future I would consider adding coffee, possibly making cupcakes, and cutting back a bit on the baking soda.

Tried this when I had a serious chocolate craving but no eggs in the house, and it definitely exceeded my expectations! I doubled the cocoa powder per other reviewers' suggestions and ended up with a rich and very moist cake that I happened to love. 4-stars because I seemed to be the cake's biggest fan--a friend of mine even remarked that it tasted like a "healthy cake" and not in a good way--so I probably won't be making it again if I have eggs on hand.

I have never made cake without eggs before but I had to have chocolate cake!! This turned out perfect, soft and moist with a nice chocolate taste. Made it in a 9" round cake pan without the frosting.
