This was super!  The flavor got *much* better the next day, so keep that in mind.  I used 3 tsp. orange peel instead of 2, and would do that again - I love the taste of orange and sweet potatoes.  I experimented a bit and used half white flour / half wheat flour.  It wasn't bad, but I think I prefer all white flour.  Note that 1 cup sweet potatoes is equal to 1 large sweet potato (peel, slice, and boil for 10 minutes or so, then mash). Thanks for the recipe!

My husband says these are the best! I wasn't sure about the orange peel and the sweet potato but they compliment each other.  I used a canned sweet potato without a problem. I did muffins and put in the oven for about 25 minutes.
You can't beat this muffin and a cup of coffee on a cold morning.

Sweet potato season is here and I had a few sweet potatoes I didn't want to go to waste, so I gave this recipe a try. I'm very glad I did. The bread was perfectly spiced and very, very moist. I also liked that the recipe didn't include any butter, making it perfect for my little one (who has food allergies) to eat. I added a 1/2 cup of fresh orange juice instead of the zest and it added a nice, subtle flavor. We don't eat nuts, so I omitted them and the bread still tasted great. I used an extra large pan so my bread took longer than an hour to bake. I'll definitely be making this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.

I made exactly per recipe ... it was delicious.  

I disagree with the reviewer who thought it wasn't sweet enough ... I think I'd use about half the white sugar next time and it would still be nicely sweet.  

I didn't think it needs any more orange zest than the recipe calls for either ... I taste the orange flavoring quite distinctly.   In fact, if I was going to add anything it might be another 1/2 cup of mashed sweet potato.

Thanks, my guys finished one of them after dinner.

Was looking for sweet potato recipes to use up our abundant garden harvest.  Made this for ourselves and for Christmas gifts.  Definitely a keeper.

Great potential but desperately needs more sugar. I would of doubled it. Mine wasnt sweet enough at all. The flavors improve the next day. I doubled the zest and added half an orange juiced/

I'm not really all there tonight, apparently. I made this according to recipe only using two tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and a stick of softened butter in place of the vegetable oil. I thought it was rather odd that the batter was so thick. I shrugged and spread it into two loaf pans and got it into the oven. Not two minutes later, I'm looking at the recipe to see if the recipe needed something and BLAM. I'd forgotten the darn eggs. I got the bread mixture out of the loaf pan and added the eggs, which made the batter fluffy and pretty. This baked up beautifully, only needing to be covered halfway with foil to keep from burning. And the smell? Lovely. This did take 65 minutes to bake both loaves. I plan on serving one loaf for breakfast tomorrow and carrying the other to a friend. I'll update on how we all liked it then. NOTE: Excellent!

This was delicious! I made a few changes to make this bread healthier. I used whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of the oil, and reduced the sugar by half. I also halved the recipe to serve 16. It turned out great!

I used about 1.5 cup of mashed sweet potatoes. Added 1/8 tsp. clove and only used 1 tsp. grated orange peel. You could definitely taste the flavor without using 2 tsp. of it. Very easy to make and we love it.

Yummy!  I did make some changes though.  1/4 C O.J. instead of zest (didn't have any).  Heavy on the sweet potato, oil, and applesauce.  And reduced white sugar by 1/2 C.  Also required little over an hour of bake time.

very good, but a little dry.  will go a little heavy on the applesauce and spice and a little light on the flour and sugar next time. cook time is a little long. it's a keeper though. going in the recipe binder! (I think if you use fresh sweet potato, your outcome will be dictated by the sweetness and moistness of your mashed tater, so adjust for personal pref!)

I love this bread! I had overbought on canned sweet potatoes for thanksgiving and had just enough to make this loaf. I was concerned because the dough seemed dry to me, but the bread turned out soft and moist and has a great sweet-but-not-too-sweet flavor.  I subbed Splenda brown sugar for regular and next time I'd love to try whole wheat flour with it. There will definitely be many next times on this one!

This turned out fantastic.  I did make a few changes including using orange juice as recommended by another review because I didn't have any orange zest on hand.  I also used leftover sweet potato casserole that had a base of sweet potatoes, bananas and honey, so I cut the sugar by half and it was perfect...not to sweet, not too bland.  I'll definitely make this again and follow the recipe to see the difference, but my guess is that it will be just as tasty.

These are so good. But instead of the grated orange peel I used the 1/2 cup of orange juice that one of the other posters mentioned.

I didn't have orange juice or zest, so I didn't add it.  Also, I halved the recipe, used a 2:1 ratio of white whole wheat flour to AP white flour, and made muffins.  (Baking took 20-25 minutes.)

The muffins came out moist and tasty, but next time I'll reduce the sugar by a lot.  These were way too sweet for me.  Otherwise, a good staple recipe.

Skipped the oil, doubled the applesauce, reduced the sugar to 1 cup total and used organic turbinado sugar, skipped the nuts...  Delish!!  Everyone raved about the orange zest addition.  Mmmmm!  Thanks for a great recipe base!!

This was a great recipe.  I had dried orange peel in the spice drawer so I put them in with the liquids and let them set for a while to moisten.  Next time, I will puree the sweet potatoes - the pieces were still a bit big after I mashed them.  Thanks for sharing - my 2 yr. old was wanting more as I put him to bed...  Sweet Dreams!

I don't care for sweet potatoes, but I got a large can of them at Thanksgiving and didn't want it to go to waste. I decided to try this, and figured if I hated it I could take it to work and maybe my coworkers would like it. Hah! It never stood a chance! These are delicious and I had to stop myself from eating them all at once. The sweet potato flavor wasn't very strong which helped. The orange zest goes well with the sweet potatoes. My loaf pans are currently in storage, so I used large muffin pans, which took about 20 minutes to bake. I still have sweet potatoes leftover (I threw the leftovers in the freezer), which is awesome because I have every intention of making more of these! Even if you hate sweet potatoes, give this recipe a try!

This is a great bread! Great flavor and texture. The only thing is that I've made it twice and it has only been enough for one loaf. Anyone else had this happen? I followed the recipe without making any adjustments...?

Just wonderful! I didnt have orange peel so I used 1/2 teaspoon organic orange extract.  I didnt have applesauce so I added another 1/2 cup of sweet potatoes instead.  I only had 1/2 cup of walnuts left so that is all I put in.  It came out wonderful!  I was afraid the spices mayhave been too much but they were wonderfully subtle yet gave it a real depth of flavor.  As others have said, the flavor gets better the next day!  Freezes well. I didnt think it was too sweet but hten again I was expecting a sweet spicy bread, perhaps those not used to the spice are expecting a sweeter sugary loaf.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the spices!

OK....a little bland.  I did not put the nuts in as my child does not eat nuts.  A good way to use up leftover mashed sweet potato.

Really good and moist.  I would use a little less orange peel next time.  It almost tasted like orange bread.

I've made this recipe many times and it is always perfect. Moist and delicious and not overly sweet. I originally used this recipe because I was given a huge bag of sweet potatoes and was looking for recipes I could use them in. Now I buy sweet potatoes just to make this bread.

I have never heard of sweet potato bread, but I love sweet potatoes served anyway so I figured "why not?!" This bread was very good. The smell after it came out of the oven reminded me of a gingerbread but the orange peel gave it a sweet taste that went well with the spice.

This is almost identical to the sweet potato bread I make.I do bake my bread at 325. The only other changes are I use 2 cups of sweet potatoes which I just bake in the oven then mash and I leave out the orange peel.I use 2 medium size sweet potatoes and that usually works out to about 2 cups.Last time I made it I added 1/2 tsp of cloves and ginger which I thought was good if you like it a little more spicy.I also add cranberries to mine.This is an extremely moist bread and it gets even better after a day or two.I think this is just as good as pumpkin bread if not better.It's really delicious!

I thought it was really good. For next time though, not necessarily less orange, but more sweet potato. I liked the flavor of the orange, but missed a little more sweet potato. I used freshly sqeezed OJ and it wasnt too overpowering. I also used homemade apllesauce. I would for sure mke this again.

I did as a previous poster did and substituted 1/2 cup orange juice for the orange zest and baked them as muffins for 25 minutes. This recipe is very YUMMY and I have it saved to make it again! Spread a little butter on the muffin and it's even better! Thanks for sharing this recipe!
