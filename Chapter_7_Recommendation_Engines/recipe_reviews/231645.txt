Made this Easter morning, instead of the hams, I used a pound of fresh Italian sausage, pan fried and crumbled first.  No leftovers here!

Simple and delicious! I only made 1 pie, so I halved all the ingredients, which worked out great. I'm used to having/making this w. bread dough, so I wasn't sure about using pie crust, but I was pleasantly surprised. I will be using this recipe again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I grew up eating this every year, my Nana would make it. The only difference is we used very thin pizza dough instead of pie crust and we add chopped boiled egg to the filling - -its an excellent dish and brings back alot of memories!

I added freshly grated pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. I would use less hot capicola - it was a bit too spicy for me.
