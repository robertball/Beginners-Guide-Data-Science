Delicious! I made this the "non-vegan" version with tradition yoghurt and chocolate and milk and butter but the combination is a winner! Worth a try! :)

This is similar to another recipe I have - we call it "breakfast sundae" and it is also non-vegan...I use fresh berries and sprinkle unmelted chocolate chips on top - my kids like our original version better and it doesn't include the extra sugar and butter!!!  But, I think occassionally, I will like to have the melted chocolate drizzles on - it makes it seem like a real sundae!!
