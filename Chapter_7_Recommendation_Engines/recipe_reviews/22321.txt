I like to make this up for holidays and parties. It's easy 
and  you can make it ahead of time and just put in the fridge. 
Try rolling in different types of nuts

Way too much Beau Monde!  The salt was a killer so I made it again with 1 teaspoon instead of the 2 tablespoons called for.  Delicious!

My mother's recipe is the same, only without the seasoning. I will be adding that this year for Christmas Eve! YUM. :)

We thought this was great! I used to have a recipe similar to this so I'm glad to have found a new one. I think this one's better than the one I lost though! I took it to our tailgate and came home with an empty bowl. Creamy and delicious! Just a tip: if you think it's too salty, just try rinsing off the beef first and patting dry. That's usually enough to help with the salty taste. At least that's what I do. Thanks for the recipe! :)

This recipe is great, just the way it is.  We like it with the addition of a dash of worchestershire, dash of hot sauce and some prepared horseradish (about 1-2 t.)
Really adds that zesty zip.

Great spread on crackers or bagels too.

I didn't care for this dip.  I couldn't taste the beef over all the green onions.  Too salty too!
