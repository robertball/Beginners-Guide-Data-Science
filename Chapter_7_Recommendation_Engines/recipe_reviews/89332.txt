I don't even like meatloaf, but I kind of tweaked the recipe, and it's AWESOME!!!  I didn't have panko crumbs, so I just used regular bread crumbs (a little more than 1 cup).  I also am not a fan of ketchup, so I used 1 part ketchup, 1 part BBQ sauce, 1 part steak sauce, with a little bit of Worchestershire.  THe meatloaf turned out moist and absolutely delicious!  You have made me into a meatloaf believer!!

I was looking for a recipe that used Panko (Japanese Bread Crumbs) and this was it.  What a great meatloaf.  Panko has better flavor and texture than regular bread crumbs.  I did "doctor up" the Panko with garlic salt, Adobe (secret ingredient) and pepper.  Then added a little italian seasoning for color.  I did use a little more Panko than the 1 cup.  It needed a little firmer texture.  The author is right, eyeball it!  Lastly I added some finely chopped onion.  
This won some rave reviews on a cold Oct day in NE while watching the NE Patriots.  Not typical "Football" food, but everyone had seconds :)
I also made some Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Roasted Garlic.  
Yum!

I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but it is my son's favorite dish.  I am always looking for one that I can make that I will like better.  Thanks Jackie, I found it.  This one is going in the file box and the search is over. Ease of preperation is a big plus too.

Very good and very easy.  I had leftover Panko crumbs to use and this was a perfect choice.  I did use some chopped onion and minced garlic instead of the powders.  Also, I added some chopped red bell pepper, celery and shredded carrots.  I added worcestershire as someone else suggested.  I guess I am saying this is a good base recipe and add what you like.

I am glad I now have another recipe for my panko bread crumbs!  This was delicious and moist.  I did substitute fresh onions and garlic for the powders.

I give this recipe a thumbs up. I am not a big fan of meatloaf, but I tried this recipe and it was really good. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and did one part bbq sauce, one part ketchup and one part worcestire sauce instead of ketchup alone. It was very good.

This is a really good recipe although I will admit I used barbeque sauce instead of ketchup. I like that it easily took small changes like adding 1/4 cup of finely grated carrot. Easy to assemble. Very tasty! Thank you!

This was a nice meal. The texture was great, it held together and didn't fall apart and wasn't mealy or bready. I was a little apprehensive using all that garlic and onion powder 1 T each seemed like a lot, so I used about 2 tsp of each instead. Next time, I will use the full amount. I did add another 1/4 ketchup. Overall, a nice meatloaf, basic and simple, and nothing for picky eaters to complain about either! Great for kids, maybe a bit bland for grown up tastes. Thanks.

Great simple recipe! I did use my own glaze for the meatloaf, instead of just ketchup. I mixed 1/4 C. ketchup, 1 tsp. prepared mustard, and 3 Tblsp. brown sugar and spread it on top of the meatloaf. Then baked it for the suggested time and temp. Big hit for our family! Will be a repeat recipe for us.

I have always attempted to recreate my mom's meatloaf with little success. It was either too mushy or too dry.  This recipe is the closest match to my mom's.  It was perfectly moist.  I did however make some alterations for personal preference.  I used minced onion and garlic in place of the powders and eliminated the salt.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of worchestershire and 6-7 dashes of tobasco for some extra kick (the two ingredients mom always used).  This recipe is a great base recipe for your own interpretation.

Man, it was nice to find a meatloaf recipe that uses Panko although normally I wouldn't use it in this type of preparation since it's a bit on the expensive side. Panko made it kinda fluffy and lighter than your typical meatloaf. I was pleasantly surprised and look forward to making this again. Oh and FYI, I don't even like meatloaf. :o)

This meatloaf is a mouthful of ketchup. Followed directions to the tee and only tasted ketchup. A hundred times YUCK. Threw it out.

Got rave reviews from my roommate. She isnt much of a cook but I had her help me out and she couldnt believe we could make such a delicious meal. If a meatloaf can turn someone into a cook then it deserves high ratings. Great recipe Jackie.

This recipe turned out extremely well. It was very easy and had a lot of flavor. I personally like ketchup, so I didn't change that part of the recipe. However I did add Worcestershire sauce, and I replaced the garlic and onion powder with fresh diced onion and several crushed cloves of garlic. I'm a big fan of fresh ingredients.  Also, the first time I made this I used the leanest beef I could get. The meatloaf flavor was fantastic but it was extremely dry. I would suggest being sure you select no leaner than an 80/20 beef.

I must admit, I was a bit skeptical because of the amount of ingredients used.  This meatloaf was fantastic!!  You must use the panko crumbs.  I also added a small amount of fresh onion and one clove of garlic instead of the powder. I also added "Sylvia's Hot Sizzlin' Spice" (about a 1/2 tsp.)  for a little extra "zip".  The consistency was perfect.   Not only is this recipe a keeper, I made another batch and made hamburgers out of it.  The recipe made 6 good sized burgers.  Wrap and freeze!!!  Thanks Jackie.

My husband loves meatloaf.  After making this last night he told me to stop the decade-long search for the right recipe because I have finally found it! I used bbq sauce instead of ketchup and made my own breadcrumbs (2 slices of bread in the food processor = 1 cup of crumbs).   I can't vouch for how greasy this dish would be if cooked the traditional way because I elevate my meatloaf on a rack in the baking pan so the fat drips off.  Sometimes drier recipes can tend to be very dry doing this, but this one was not.  A note: if you try this method, make sure to use at least 90/10 ground beef, as lower fat varieties will be too dry.

Panko really is the best. I "discovered" it last year and haven't looked back. You shouldn't either. Just compare the ingredients between panko and standard bread crumbs. Blech! This meatloaf turned out delicious. Did add bbq sauce, onion, and celery. Also used fresh garlic. Yummy!

This was one of the best meatloaf recipes I've tried. The panko is a great improvement over bread crumbs, giving the meatloaf a lighter texture. I cut back a little on the garlic powder as I thought a full tablespoon would be overpowering, but now I don't think it was necessary.

Delicious made in the slow cooker! I used fresh bread crumbs instead of the panko, but other than that followed ingredients exactly.  Put in slow cooker for 8 hrs on LOW shaping the loaf so there would be room for the liquids to gather around the edges. It was very moist and my husband really liked it. Tomorrow it will be served cold on sandwiches and then there will be none left!!! Which means it only serves 4 or we are little piglets!

Delicious! The panko makes to meatloaf moist and light.  I used meatloaf mix (pork, beef and veal) instead of just ground beef.  Added diced and sautéed onions, carrots, green pepper, celery and garlic to the meatloaf mix.  My family enjoyed it.  I now make extra and freeze it.

THIS is a good solid meatloaf recipe. Predictable enough that you can experiment with it and expect good results. Thanks for a basic recipe that has good texture and wonderful taste.

Super easy! Subbed the beef for ground turkey. I also added diced olives and shredded carrots to sneak some veggies in on my family.

This was good, but not great--I didn't have panko, so used plain bread crumbs. That might have made the difference between "good" and "delicious." It was definitely easy!

Real good meatloaf. Just good and classic, I found this recipe when I was out of dry onion soup mix (I usually just follow the directions on the back of that box). This is my back up recipe.

Very nice.  I did shred some carrots and broccoli stems into the mixture, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and finally figured out why people at something as odd-looking (IMHO) as meatloaf -- it's good!

Although it might have been the salt-free seasoning I used this meatloaf had a weird flavor to it.  I like the idea of the panko, though, and might try to doctor it up a little bit in the future.

Love this recipe! I used regular bread crumbs, not the panko crumbs. I also didn't have the seasoning blend so I just omitted it. Delicious anyway! This one goes into the rotation...hmm..just about time to make it again...can't wait!

Don't have any teeth? Not a problem! This meatloaf is simply melt in your mouth delicious thanks to the panko bread crums. I tweaked the recipe a hair: Lawry's season salt (I then omitted the table salt) and a tbs of worchestire sauce.

I have been making these recipe for years. Before this recipe, I always messed up meatloaf. Now this is a staple in our house. I sometimes substitute half of the breadcrumbs for oatmeal.

excellent recipe Jackie!!  I added fresh grated onion (1/2 Spanish onion) 1 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 chopped bell pepper, a handful of grated carrot and 1 1/2 cups Panko bread crumbs, 2 eggs (maybe 3 next time), tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 c. Ketchup, ...came out wonderfully! I do suggest a fattier burger 90/10 or 80/20, and************* (try this, it is a great idea borrowed from another allrecipes recipe!!!!) I put 2 pieces of any type of bread at the bottom of the loaf pan to absorb the grease and extra juices from the meat/veggies---DH says its tasty, but I toss it out!

I have played around with different meatloaf recipes for years, and none were to my or my family's liking.  This is the first meatloaf recipe that my entire family loved!  I didn't have panko, so I just used regular bread crumbs that I had on hand.  It still turned out great!  It's moist but not to the point it falls apart.  It stays together so well and tastes so good.  Thank you!

I used this as a base recipe, wrapped my meatloaf around two string cheese (cheddar) sticks that I'd frozen, brushed a layer of ketchup over top and laid several thick sliced applewood smoked bacon on top. The best meatloaf you'll EVER eat!

This was my first attempt at making meatloaf. I was making it for 2 and scaled down the recipe. Instead of a loaf I made them in single deep ramekins. I made it for my boyfriend. We both thought it was awesome. I used fresh onion and added some fresh chopped basil for some spice.

I think this would be pretty good meatloaf, if I had not changed the recipe. I got away from the original recipe and used 1/3 ketchup, 1/3 Cattlemens Classic BBQ and 1/3 Worchestershire Sauce. I also used Italian bread crumbs. The texture was good, but I think the taste was a little too spicy and overpowering. I think next time I would just stick to the catsup and regular bread crumbs.

I am not a lover of meatloaf but this recipe was wonderful.  I think the panko breadcrumbs made a world of difference. This was a light and flavorful recipe which I will make again and again. To me most meatloaf tastes like hamburger, boring, boring, boring, but not this. I did add some fresh garlic and onion, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for sharing Jackie!

No complaints in my household! My 8 yr old even loved it! I did follow the advice of others and used a bit more Panko than called for and did half and half the ketchup with some sweet vidalia onion bbq sauce! Also, I added some chopped onion to the mixture and italian spices.
It was fantastic! A new family favorite!

The best meatloaf i've ever had. However i did have to cute the amount of onion/garlic powder and seasoning in half. If you don't it is way too much seasoning. Anyhow it was great!

Really good! I didn't change a thing except that I chose not to put the additional ketchup on top. My mom thought the garlic was a little overpowering, but my dad loved it, so if you don't like a strong garlic flavor you might want to decrease the garlic powder. Other than that it was great! Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Not a ketchup fan on meatloaf, so changed it a little. Added garlic, Worcestershire sauce, didn't have panko so used cracker crumbs..But my secret for good meatloaf is Goya tomato sauce!!! Mix in your meatloaf mixture and spread on top in place of ketchup.. Its the best meatloaf you ever have, Anne Collins.

This is my go-to recipe for meatloaf. I've made it with beef, turkey, chicken and it's always delicious. I made it as written and we loved it. Now I use oatmeal instead of panko because I seldom have breadcrumbs on hand. It works great. 
This is a very forgiving recipe.

Omg this is SO good! I used real onions and garlic instead of dried. No salt-free seasoning. Added a generous splash of Worcestershire. Used 1/2 ketchup mixed with 1/4 cup salsa. Venison instead of beef. So basically, I made my own recipe :)

This is a great recipe. Super easy and can be modified in many ways for different tastes. One thing I did was put BBQ sauce ontop instead of ketchup as some others suggested. It sorta carmalizes which is delicious. Another thing I have done is put mozzerella cheese and spinach in the middle, also very good. I stick with the basic recipe on the seasoning and it's perfect every time.  Also freezes great for an easy meal later in the week. Thanks for this recipe! I have made it a regular dinner item.

I made this meatloaf last night and it was absolutely delicious!  I used fresh garlic and onions instead of the powders, and added some green pepper and about two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce... it was fabulous!  This will be my go-to meatloaf recipe from now on!

I made this for a luncheon for 70 women.  This is THE BEST meatloaf recipe!  It was delicious!  We received so many compliments on it, at the luncheon and afterward.  Even the kitchen crew couldn't get enough of it -- we were fighting over the crumbs in the pan!  Thanks so much for the recipe, Jackie!!

Wow!  I'm pretty picky about flavors and I have to say I loved this recipe.  The Panko makes a huge difference in keeping this moist.  Yum and thank you!

My previous attempt at meatloaf using my mom's recipe "grossed out" my husband, so I was leery of trying meatloaf again.  He LOVED it!  I have no idea why this is so good since it seems so basic, but it is fantastic!

Awesome! I love the panko crumbs and use this recipe all the time.  Recipe is great as is, but have made the following changes: added 1/4 tsp of minced garlic in place of garlic powder, 1/4 cup finely diced carrots, 1/3 cup diced onion in place of onion powder. Recipe works great with ground turkey, too.

My husband was pretty unsure about this recipe, but both of us were very pleased with out it turned out. I've made this several times, my husband requests it almost weekly now. I've been adding minced celery, green and red peppers, onion and garlic. Depending on how many veggies I make, I add one more egg and more bread crumbs. This is definitely one of our family favorites.

I give this a 4 star, because I had to change it a bit. It only called for 1 pound of meatloaf, but I used 2 lbs and it turned out perfect. I had to use regular bread crumbs, because that is what I had. I followed someone's advice buy using half ketchup and half W. sauce.

this was so delicious and moist!!! i did a couple things differently, but nothing major. first, i put the entire 3/4 cup of ketchup in the meatloaf and i just brushed the top with some extra. also, i put half of a chopped white onion and three chopped cloves of garlic in the meatloaf. i love onion and love it even more in my meatloaf. 

this was my first time using a recipe other than my grandmother's and i LOVED it.

Made this for supper tonight.  I liked that it was very quick to put together.  I followed the recipe as written except I used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) which I mixed into the meat and which gave it a bit of a smoky flavor.  I spread just a bit of ketchup on top.  The bf loved it!  Will make again.

Good recipe, but I did change some things.  Instead of ketchup I used 1/2 cup of milk because I didn't want a glaze on top, 1/2 chopped onion, 1 minced garlic clove,  1/4 tsp worchestshire sauce and I added finely chopped fresh herbs. Made a easy brown gravy. It was delicious.

Made this tonight, and the panko crumbs were mush within the meatloaf :(  Maybe a smaller amount of panko or baking it longer would help?  But i won't use panko crumbs in meatloaf again, that's for sure.

Love it. easy. moist and easy to change up the flavor. Added a tablespoon of McCormicks Grill Mates - Molasses Bacon seasoning. Kept the 1/2 cup ketchup in the meat mixture. I poured 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce over the meatloaf and sprinkled additional Molasses Bacon seasoning over the top before baking.  Yummy.

This had a great taste. It wasn't too heavy and had just the right amount to spice. I used a flavored salt.

I did use my own glaze for the meatloaf, instead of just ketchup, and added some chopped onions, but very tasty and nice consistency.

This was mediocre at best. I decided to make meatloaf for dinner last night (had a taste for it). I was sooo excited to try Jackie's recipe. I mean, how easy can it get - mix meat, bread crumbs, eggs, ketchup and a few spices (no chopping... yea!!!), shape into a loaf and bake. I have never used panko crumbs in meatloaf before, so I was excited to see how the texture would be (many reviewers claimed this recipe's fame based on that alone). To my dismay, I was terribly disappointed. It was the texture of all things that turned me off (i.e. waaay too mushy)!!! The seasoning was good, but I think adding diced bell pepper (red, green or a combo of the two), celery and onion instead of powder might have given this a nice little boost.  And, I must admit I was concerned about using only ketchup for the glaze, but was pleasantly surprised with the outcome (that is the only high point I can remember...). TIP: I set my shaped loaf inside a greased 13 x 9 x 2 in. stoneware baking dish. This prevented grease from collecting on top (yuck!). I found that using semi-lean meat (extra lean might dry out too much) worked well with this technique. Try it! Served with mashed potatoes, beef gravy, corn and garlic butter crescent rolls, this was an "OK" meal. Had I not went all out preparing multiple sides, I would have been HUNGRY!!! Thanks anyways, Jackie! :-)

Great basic meatloaf! The panko crumbs really add a good texture to the meatloaf, it is not as dense as using straight bread crumbs. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a few dashes of liquid smoke with the spices. Came out very moist without being greasy, and my wife (who doesn't like meatloaf) really enjoyed it. Be sure to add an extra coating of ketchup or bbq sauce during the last 15 minutes of cooking to glaze.

Good but not great. Used 1/3 ketchup, 1/3 BBQ sauce, 1/3 Steak sauce instead of just ketchup. Even so, flavour wasn't a highpoint of this meatloaf.

This is good and achieved what I've been looking for in a meatloaf recipe: the loaf was firm and not falling apart! You can add/subtract any ingredients to taste, but I think the panko crumbs are the key to this meatloaf. I will use this recipe again.

Great recipe!!! I love the ketchup on top.  Came out very moist and lots of flavor.  I only changed 2 things, I chopped about a 1/4 cup of onion instead of powder and added one tablespoon of worcestershire.  Cant wait to have meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow!

Great recipe!    I am the only one in our family that likes meatloaf and since I'm the one that cooks, I decided to make it after searching for a recipe I thinght my family might like better than my old standby.   I found Jackie's and it was a huge hit with my meatloaf hating kids and husband.  They actually asked me to make it again!

I thought this was fantastic.  I baked them in muffin cups lined with foil.  The kids loved it.  ...no veggie or onion chunks which they don't like.  Instead of panko bread crumbs, I used gluten free bread crumbs.  I'll definitely be making them again.  They stuck to the foil pretty badly but tasted great!  Lastly, I didn't put ketchup on top.

I was torn between giving this 3 or 4 stars. I made the recipe as written. My husband said it had great potential, but the seasonings were a little overpowering. Next time, I'll make it with less seasoning.  I still will use this as a guide, but will not be following it to the letter again.

This is a great meatloaf! Easy to make and flavorful. The texture is just right and moist too! We added a medium onion to the mix and it added a nice touch. Gotta get those veggies in for the kids somewhere!! We all enjoyed it!

A really easy recipe for meatloaf! But I have made 3 times and made some changes - I Don't use the salf-free seasoning blend. I add fried garlic, fresh cut onion instead onion powder and a bit of worcestershire sauce.. soo good!!

I used italian breadcrumbs instead of the japanese ones, added 1/4 tsp of worstershire sauce, and about 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce and it turned out great...My family loved it!

I used half the amount of seasonings suggested and it was still a little to much. I think next time I will reduce it a little more but I WILL use this recipe again!

An easy quick prep tasty meatloaf- it was a wet prep so I was worried when molding it into its loaf, but it worked out great.  My husbands only complaint was that there weren't any onion chuncks (since the recipe doesn't call for it) so maybe next time I'll add that!  Yum

Added 2 corn muffins since I didn’t have Panko bread crumbs. Yum!  Also used a Sicilian herb blend in lieu of the spice blend. Fantastic!

Simple and easy. As with others who reviewed, I doctored it with onion, celery, shredded carrot and chopped mushrooms. Also, mixed ketchup with brown sugar and a bit of Worcestershire for the topping.  Other than that, a really great meatloaf - served with garlic mashed and green beans!

I made this recipe word for word and it kinda ended up with the consistency of potted meat and that was gross. I can cook meatloaf all day, but I tried this recipe and one of these ingredients turned my loaf into a mush.

I  am not much of a cook, but I'm really trying.  This was simple enough even for someone like me. I loved that I didn't have to chop onions for it,  and that it used a single pound of meat. Plenty for two or three days for just me. This will be my go to recipe for meatloaf.

It turned out great!  I used steel cut oat meal instead of the Panko bread crumbs because I thought I was out the bread crumbs which turned out not to be true.  I think any kind of finely ground grain will work for this recipe.  Yummy!!  Also, I recently lost a dear friend named Jackie who loved to cook.  So, I think making this meatloaf  is one way of honoring her memory.

I used gluten free Texas toast croutons.  Smashed them up with mallet.  Also added fresh garlic. Mixed half the ketchup in with the meat. Put the rest of ketchup over the top of the meat loaf.

Oh my!!! This is such a simple recipe but oh so good. I've had a family favorite meatloaf recipe that I've used for years and because I didn't have all the ingredients for it looked for a meatloaf recipe that I could make with what I had on hand. This was it and let me say my family just "raved" about it. I tripled the recipe and it was gone the next night. Unbelievable. And they asked for it again the next night. Let's just say I will be retiring my old one for this. Thanks so much for a wonderful meatloaf that really hits the spot and makes great sandwiches the next day. :)

The only change I made (and I do this every time I make a meatloaf) is I subbed out the ketchup ( I can't stand it) for BBQ sauce.  The cooking time is off, it needed about an extra 25 minutes.

Always on the look out for a good meatloaf-- this was a PERFECT jumping off point. I like to sneak veggies into my meatloaf, so I sauteed some minced carrot, celery, and onion and threw that in. I used a total 1/2 cup of binder- ketchup, some BBQ and worcestershire, I think (I get a little mad chef sometimes and just throw stuff in). My boyfriend and I agreed this was our favorite so far! Thanks Jackie!

...was looking for a lower sodium alternative to my favorite meat loaf.  I used plain unseasoned Panko which only contains 180 mg sodium per cup. I also used McCormick's Perfect Pinch, Fiesta Citrus seasoning, it is salt free, and very flavorful. I also eliminated the salt that the recipe calls for. Those are the only things I did to change this great recipe...and it's become a favorite...

This was so so easy!  Made two loafs and took a loaf to work to my coworkers, who are very selective about meals.   They loved it!!! They have appointed this dish as the official dish to bring for our potlucks.

This is a pretty good meatloaf recipe. One time, I added BBQ sauce as many of the reviewers suggested, but my family thought that it was too sweet then (I have some diabetics in my family, and they didn't seem to appreciate the extra sweetness the BBQ added to the dish). For the topping, instead of just using ketchup, I usually mix the ketchup with about 2 tablespoons of water and 1 tablespoon of worchestershire sauce. Sometimes I substitute regular bread crumbs or a mix of bread crumbs and crushed crackers for the panko bread crumbs.

I put some chipotle sauce instead of the ketchup and it was fantastic. A great recipe to play with.
