Nice start to a good recipe.  I used 40 cookies, 1/4 cup melted butter, and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar.  Combined everything in a food processor and pressed into a pie plate.  Baked the crust at 350F for 9 minutes, let it cool stlightly and then filled it with my pie filling and baked the pie (I made Key Lime).  Perfect!

I used this crust to change the banana pudding IV recipe here on allrecipes to a banana cream pie.  I also added about 1/3 cup of powdered sugar and it was so good!  We love the banana pudding recipe, but agreed that this time the crust was the best part.  I've used the recipe again today to make strawberry pie-yum!  So versatile!

I used this as the crust for a banana cream pie and ended up with a slightly soggy crust. Perhaps it would have worked better if I had baked the crust a little first.

A great starter recipe that needs a lot of work.  Keeping the story as short as I can.....40 cookies, 1/4 C butter, 1/3 C powdered sugar, a handful of walnuts, splash of vanilla.  Pulsed in a processor.  Took the advice of an earlier reviewer and baked at 350F for nine minutes.  Poured in a Meyers Lemon filling and cooked for another 30 minutes.  Maybe the best pie I've eaten and the crust was perfect.  IMHO you have to cook this crust, especially with a non-bake pie, or the crust will be mush.  I used a Marie Callender size pie tin and had more crust than I needed.  Next time I'll use 30 cookies and maybe a tad more nuts....pecans or macadamias should be awesome in this crust.  Anyway, thanks for a great idea.

Good change from the normal graham cracker crust.  I used my food processor, and pulsed the crumbs, butter, some orange zest and a little cinnamon sugar.  I baked at 350 for 10 minutes, cooled, and filled with a pudding/cool whip mixture.  Yum!

My pie plates are a little taller on the sides so I used 2 1/4 cups of mini vanilla wafers and a stick of butter. So great to not have to bake it. I used this for a base for Banana Cream Pie 1. Simply delish-iousness!

This was an easy crust (and especially good w/ the "Banana Cream Pie I" recipe from this site).  Changes I made include:  1) I didn't measure the crumbs exactly - just approximated it and added more butter if it was a little dry.  2) I enlisted the help of my husband to crush the cookies in a Ziplock freezer bag w/ a small hammer from his toolbox over a cutting board (much easier than using a meat pallet).  3) I baked it at 350 degrees for approximately 10 minutes until it wasn't too soft.  4) I added 1/3 cup of white sugar before pressing it into my pie pan.

Goes really well with Mini Cheesecakes but I think I may like a basic graham cracker crust better. Great if you'd like a change of pace from that though!

I put the cookies in a food processor. The key is grinding the cookies until very fine. I made 2 crusts and used a whole box of cookies. Good crust.

An excellent crust, especially for fruit pies! I would, however, strongly suggest that you bake it before you fill it. I baked it at 350 for about 9-10 minutes for a full 9x13 pan. It turned out beautifully!

I made it and it's perfect. I've been using it for my cheesecakes and it turns out perfect everytime and yes if you make a type of pie that is really wet you should bake this crust a bit so it isn't soggy .

Everyone loved this crust! It was perfect. Our cheesecake filling required baking, so it did get baked with the cheesecake. I’m sure it would be just as good if not baked.

I made it without changes and it was excellent. I used it as the basis of a coconut/banana cream pie with meringue, and though the meringue didn't hold up, the crust and custard were delicious.

Took other reviewers suggestion and added 1.5 tbsp sugar and baked in oven for 7-9 minutes at 350. Perfect crust! Use this for a banana cream pie.

The crust works really well with the banana pudding pie. I did attempt to make mini pies as I had some left over since I had made four batches, with pumpkin pie mix I attempted to use this as a baking. The crust does not bake and doesn’t hold, I know it’s not made for it. If anyone was curious, just wanna give you the scoop. Very tasty tho for the cooled crust.

It was so good with one change! My mom, who usually makes pies from scratch at home, said it was excellent. It held well for cutting and serving. Good texture. Taking other reviewers suggestions, I used a food processor to crumble the cookies and then cut in the butter. Also baked the crust first for about 8 or 9 min at 350F and let it cool before adding filling. Excited to use this crust for all kinds of pies!

Exactly what I wanted/expected. Though following these measurements didn't quite make enough crust for my pie plate, and if you're using a pyrex or other not non-stick pan, you'll want to coat the the pan with butter or some non-stick element.
