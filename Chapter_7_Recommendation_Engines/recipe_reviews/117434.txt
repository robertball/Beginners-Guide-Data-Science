Very good. I modified and used what I had. I used some homemade cranberry chutney, mixed curry powder with the mayo, and added slivered almonds. Even better after several days in the fridge.

I did add a dash of curry powder and used what was on hand - shredded cheddar and regular raisins, but otherwise followed the recipe.  My family really liked it.

I made this using leftover barbecued turkey breast, skipped the cheese and added chopped toasted pecans. I served it on a split croissant - open faced style, with a piece of pineapple on the  side. Deelicious ! Next time I might add some dried cranberries for colour and added taste.

Delicious! I added some dill weed and a bit of salt, and it was perfect for pita sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe!

It was good. I might make again but I would shred cheese next time. Also maybe a little sharper cheese.
