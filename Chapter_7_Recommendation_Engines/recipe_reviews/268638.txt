I’m sorry but I really didn’t like this recipe at all.  I thought the sweet/salty taste of the prosciutto and fig would be a hit, but I was totally wrong.  I was going to take this to a holiday party, but changed it to goat cheese, prosciutto pine nuts and herbs.  Tasted much better.

i added  a bit of arugula mixture  Inside roll up and left out pine nuts.  As suggested I cut them in half. Easy and delicious.
