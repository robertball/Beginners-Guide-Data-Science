I recently went to Chicago and had a version of this at The Corner Bakery, they called it Swiss Oatmeal.  I loved it so much I had to come home and figure out how to make it.  This was by far the best recipe I found.  To make it more like The Corner Bakery version I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain and rather than add a cup of raisins I used a mixture of currants, raisins, and dried cranberries.  I also added half of a Granny Smith apple per bowl for a tart flavor like they do.  The only thing missing was one of their awesome raisin crisps covered with raw sugar!  Just a tip, I leave a big bowl of oats, honey, milk, and yogurt in the fridge then by the bowl add the rest.  This keeps the sliced and quartered bananas and apples fresh and yummy and the oats nice and soggy!

Lol, I've been eating this for breakfast almost every day for several years now!  (But I got the recipe from a neighbor)  It really is a great breakfast.  My son loves it too, and that means a lot since he can be quite picky. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I add different things to mine, so it's not exactly this recipe that I use. My favorite fruit to add is dried blueberries or sometimes I add frozen mixed berries (which of course are completely thawed by morning), but I'll use any fruit that is handy.  The best thing is that this does not leave you feeling empty later in the morning, so you don't overeat at lunchtime.  Delicious, healthy and inexpensive!

I also have been making this for breakfast for a few years now.  I really liked this recipe, this is an easier version of the traditional Muesli. The original recipe has a lot of dried fruits and nuts, which turns too sweet for my taste.  On this recipe the only thing I changed was to use a fresh banana instead of dried fruit. Sometimes I add an apple or berries, whatever I have on hand. I also like to add a couple Tbsp of flax seeds and a little cinnamon.

My boys love this recipe. I make it all the time for them. I love it cold, they always heat it up. I use cranberries, diced apples and bananas, honey, cinnamon, and I mix coconut millk and regular milk. When i tell people what it is they always scrunch there noses up at it, but I used to get it at Corner Bakery and feel in love, also it is a hearty breakfast.

My mother was German so we had a lot of this growing up. For it to be complete for me, it needs ground or flaked hazelnuts and chopped apples. So good!

Thank you for this recipe! Simple and Delicious!! I didn't have soy milk on hand so I used regular fat fee milk instead - but it tastes good to me! I will definately have to try soy milk next time.

This was really good! I made some up last night so I could have it for breakfast after gym this morning. I followed the recipe and then added banana and mixed nuts before eating. I may cut down on the honey next time, & will maybe use strawberry yoghurt instead of plain.

This was quick and easy to make and to eat.  I drizzled a little honey over top in the morning and the night before threw some frozen peaches on top to thaw. This was so quick and easy, and tasty. Five stars!

Very yummy, I like mine hot.  Worth a few extra minutes in the morning for something that is going to stick with me for more than a couple of hours.

My husband and I wouldn't be considered 'morning people' by any stretch of the imagination, so I was really happy to find a recipe that I could make the night before. It's really tasty and great when you've got an early appointment to keep and don't feel like making anything...  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! This is the best! I don't even like oatmeal that well, but this is delicious, and easy! I used vanilla yogurt, skim milk and dried cranberries. I think I'm going to add some cinnamon tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing food for breakfast! I absolutely loved it. I added vanilla yogurt instead on plain and that added some flavor and a bit of sweetness. I don't care for food that is too sweet and this was just right. Thank you!

This recipe is absolutely my new favorite breakfast. I don't have much time in the morning so I love the fact that I can make something healthy to eat the night before and I love that I can customize it to my tastes and what i have on hand. Lately i've been using vanilla greek yogurt and light vanilla soy milk, and i've been adding in cinnamon, dried cranberries, blueberries and cherries, and chopped green apples and walnuts. It's awesome!

This is ok but I add some bran, and any chopped dried fruit (apricots, figs, apples...). I happen to have at hand, as well as crushed/chopped walnuts and/or almonds, brazil nuts.... Soy milk is a choice I guess. I make this about twice a year so I always have something available.

I love how this recipe is so healthy and filling.  I added fresh nectarines and toasted walnuts to mine.  I also used Greek yogurt, which I'm sure made it thicker and a little tangier.  Added a splash of vanilla.  I like eating it knowing that it's good for me.  My husband does not like it.

I'm not sure I'm in love with the texture of oats and yogurt. I like this better just soaking it in the milk alone.

My husband absolutely loves this! It tastes great, and keeps him full for hours, which really cuts back on the snacking. Plus, the oatmeal is great for his cholesterol. Thank you!

I'm not really sure what I was expecting but I didn't enjoy this.  If I were to try it again I would leave out the honey. I think I would also heat it up some because the texture with it cold was strange to me. Sorry.

A nice healthy, delicious breakfast! My teenage son loves it; he will even take spoonfuls as a snack. I prefer mine heated and with additional fruit; he likes his cold and just the way it is. I will keep this as a staple in my refridgerator for a quick and healthy start to the day!

for some reason I really thought I would like this; and I really didn't. I tried it twice, both times not exactly according to recipe but close enough (I also added fruit). I have a feeling I wouldn't have liked this anyway. Maybe I just don't like those type of grains. They didn't go well with the yogurt and honey either. The taste just came out really funky.

It was all right. I used regular milk instead of soy milk.  I don't know if I would make it again. It was different.

Made it exactly and it was great.  Can replace stevia for honey, if desired - still great! For mix-ins, I'd suggest dried cranberries, slices almonds, and A LOT of GRATED green apple - like, doubling the volume with apple - so delicious!

Delicious! I used plain non-fat Greek yogurt and added a splash of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I subbed almond milk for soy milk. In the morning I topped it with banana and blueberries, and it was the perfect breakfast!

My husband and I really like this! I scaled it down to 2 servings and used 1% milk instead of soy, but otherwise followed the recipe. I added fresh blueberries, some cinnamon, a sprinkle of nutmeg and a tablespoon of hemp seeds. Thank you for sharing your recipe!
