This is a healthy smoothie not low cal.  Bananas are high in calories, you can substitute them for another fruit to bring down the calories.

Delicious! I used fresh turmeric. Citrus juice, coconut milk and turmeric are a great bunch of flavors. Thank you for the recipe.

This was okay, a bit much turmeric for my taste; it was a little bitter
