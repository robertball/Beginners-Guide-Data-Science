I'm a big cinnamon fan. I'm also a Captain Morgan fan. Never thought to put the two together. It makes sense though, since they are both "spicy-sweet" . My only complaint is the cinnamon is a bit strong in the original recipe and I liked it much better with about equal parts cinnamon whisky to rum. This really works!

I found myself pleasantly surprised cinnamon, spice, and cola worked, but they did!  I had all of the ingredients on hand so I decided to add a "face" to this recipe.  I used Coke Zero (R) and Bacardi Spiced Rum.  While it won't be a "go to", I'd definitely drink it again should the occasion arise...  CHEERS!

As is, the recipe is pretty brutal because of the Fireball. I made it 3 parts Coke, 1 part Captain Morgans, 1/2 part Fireball. This is my best combo so far.

I substituted the whiskey with cinnamon schnapps, and used diet rite cola. Tasty!
