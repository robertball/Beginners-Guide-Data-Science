Very good - 4-1/2 stars. The texture is nice and chewy. Tastes better with the addition of 1) 1/2 tsp cinnamon in the dough and 2) 3/4-1 tsp finely grated lemon zest in the filling. Baking for no more than 8 minutes keeps these appealingly chewy. Beware of overbaking. It's true that this dough is very soft and sticky. Roll between sheets of waxed paper and use the paper to help roll the dough. Lift and peel, so that it falls on itself. Continue lifting and peeling to make a compact roll. This way you won't have to use extra flour which will toughen your finished product.

I love dates and this cookie really showed them off well. The dough was kind of hard to work with-it was pretty sticky, but I ended up rolling it between two sheets of wax paper, filling it with the dates and then rolling it and putting it into the freezer to harden. It sliced a lot better that way what with how sticky the dates are, and the cookies came out very pretty. A nice chewy texture and good flavor.
