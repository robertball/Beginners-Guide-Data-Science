I made this because I remember my grandmother always having it at picnics. I took it to a pot luck and it was a rave !! I did substitute 1/2 of the mayo with greek plain yogurt.

This was so tasty and very quick & easy to prepare. Next time I'd probably do half yoghurt. This will be a winner for barbecues.

I make this a couple of times a month! We love it - I only use 1 tbsp of milk  and use 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp white vinegar. I also omit the peppers and egg. Make sure beans are drained well or it will be watery. Thank you for the recipe!

5.5.20  I added the 1 cup mayonnaise to the bowl, and then saw that the recipe called for another 1/4 cup of liquid (milk and vinegar) and had concerns that this would turn out too runny.  I cut it back some, and I’m glad I did because it still was pretty wet.  I reduced the number of hard boiled eggs simply because they’re hard to find during this COVID-19 phase, and if you are lucky enough to find eggs, they’re outrageously expensive.  I’ve made kidney bean salad many, many times, and this one measured up pretty well.  I gave it a good grind of freshly-ground black pepper, and it was a nice side dish to some salmon patties.

Sorry I cut my review short accidentally. The mixture of mayonnaise (Duke’s, of course!) with milk, vinegar and sugar is much better than mayo alone but there are no pickles in this version.

Yummy, yummy with lots of protein and potassium!  Best the next day after sitting in refrigerator over night. I added half a cup of plain greek yogurt and of course a tiny bit more sugar :)  32oz of kidney beans is actually two cans.  Great for summer.

I just made this but knew I would make a couple of changes since I was trying to recreate a specific kidney bean salad from a small delicatessen near our IL home.  I omitted the boiled egg and added about 2/3 stalk of minced celery to the halved recipe.  Only my Dad and I will eat this so cut the recipe in half.  Tastes excellent already and anticipate it will be even better after a day or so of resting in the frig.

Very good recipe. Definitely make it ahead of time because it tastes much better after a day or two.

I found that  making it per recipe it comes out quite bland for my tastebuds.  However, I rated it 4 stars because it's a great combo that can easily be tweaked to greatness.  I added 6 TBS of vinegar and 6 pks of nutrisweet, plus LOTs of salt and pepper. ( I added it 2TBS of vinegar at a time and kept tasting it until it tasted the way I thought was good)  The basic recipe does have a hint of the sweet and sour, but it's very faint.  I think using the greek yogurt with it's tanginess would help.  I suggest making it with 1/2 yogurt and otherwise per recipe, then just tweek it until it has the taste you like.  Certainly a healthy dish.  Thank you for sharing it.
