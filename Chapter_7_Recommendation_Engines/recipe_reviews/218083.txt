Simple and delicious! As Marianne states, this definitely is more of a brine than a marinade. My husband is a huge fan of grilled pork chops so I had to give this a try and I'm glad I did!  I used thick cut bone-in chops and added a little minced garlic and a few splashes of balsamic vinegar cutting back on the water a bit.  These grilled up perfectly - Thanks for yet another wonderful recipe Marianne!

Because this was submitted several years ago, I didn't think to go back to edit it.  This is really a brine, not a marinade.  By infusing the pork with the salt, sugar, and fresh herbs, you get a nice, juicy pork chop.  You can grill it however you like it.  Some people like the flavor of apple juice rather than water (we don't), so that is an option.

EXCELLENT, JUICY!  So moist and JUICY!  This was so simple to prepare.  I took out frozen pork chops and placed them in the marinade to defrost.  I used dried herbs because I didn't realize that I never planted thyme.  While they were marinating I ran to the nursery like a good "AR Addict" and bought and planted thyme.  Of course, I added the 2 sprigs first.  This was so juicy and flavorful that Hubby claimed it doesn't need to be served with applesauce, it can stand on it's own moistness.  10 minutes on each side was perfect for my grill.  I kept the temperature of the grill around 350-375.  Thank you Marianne for sharing your recipe.  I will be marinating all my pork chops this way for added juiciness.

I'm sorry, but, both Hubby and I thought these were bland.  Followed the recipe exactly too.  I was apprehensive with water being used as a marinade, but was curious to try due to the ratings of others.  Sorry Marianne - just not for us. :-)

I try and follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it as I did here. I will be making these pork chops again as they were very moist and tender but would like a little more flavor.  Next time I think I will brush on a little BBQ sauce right before they come off the grill.

I love brining and did not have one for chops!  Thanks for sharing Marianne, it really made the chops tender.  I am going to try this with other cuts soon.

This recipe delivered the most tender and juicy grilled pork chops we have ever had.  I was looking for a marinade for bone in pork chops and luckily found Marianne's.  Hubby was impressed although he tried to say it was his skill with the grill that made the chops so flavourfulâ€¦we both know it was this marinade. I added some minced garlic and otherwise followed the directions fully.  A real keeper for us.

I was looking for a recipe that would make the pork in pork fried rice more tender. I loved the simplicity of this recipe with the fresh herbs. I was not disappointed when my family also commented on how the pork was moist and tender. I am looking forward to using this recipe to brine my pork chops for the grill. Thanks, Marianne!

This brine made the most delicious, moist and juicy pork chops! I had two thick, bone-in chops, and grilled them in my Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven, and they turned out fantastic. Will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks Maryanne!

Very delicious and moist pork chops. Made recipe almost as is, except we used our digital smoker instead of the grill. No doubt they would be delicious on the grill though...just didn't feel like grilling the day we made them. Removed chops when they reached 145 and let rest about 5 minutes before serving (total cook time was 1 - 1.5 hours at 225 F in the smoker). Simple and delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I made the recipe as written, but I did follow advice of a few other reviewers, and added a couple cloves of crushed garlic and a splash of balsamic vinegar.  I also used 2 spears rosemary.  The pork was very juicy, but there wasn't even a hint of rosemary or thyme.  If I make it again, I would increase both substantially.  I wanted something different than just grilled pork chops, and while this was very easy, it didn't enhance the pork in any way.

As noted in reviews, this is more like a brine. I subbed part of the water with white wine. Chops were very juicy. A keeper.

These pork chops were really good. Very tender and moist, exactly the way a good pork chop should be. I didn't make them exactly as written, I added two cloves of garlic because we love garlic and pork and garlic seem to go hand in hand. I also rinsed well before grilling to remove as much salt as possible. Thanks for the great recipe Marianne.

We love pork, and this is one recipe that I will be keeping. I used apple juice instead of water (personal preference)
Easy to make and sooo good. Thanks Marianne for  this recipe.

I  used this as a first step on my pork, scaled  to 1 serving for 2 small loin chops.
