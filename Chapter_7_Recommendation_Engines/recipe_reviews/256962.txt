Excellent breakfast / brunch dish : ) My son said, "Mom, why have you not been making these all my life."  As you will see, this is a very easy, and versatile recipe.

I did not do exactly as the recipe calls, because I did not have sliced bacon strips on hand. Rather, I had bacon pieces, which I chopped, and fried up. I added the bacon pieces to the egg mixture along with the ham. 

I used a mixture of finely grated cheese; mild cheddar, and low-moisture mozzarella. And, instead of Gouda on top I used shredded Monterey Jack  cheese, because my son doesn't care for Gouda. 

I coated the muffin cups with butter before ladling in the mixture.

Very yummy! Skipped the gouda on top, and used some breakfast sausage links in place of ham (since I already had them ready to go) and these were really delicious. I like baking a batch of these every week or so, for my teenager to have a hot breakfast on those early school mornings. These can freeze and reheat well too. Lots of mix / match filling options. My bake time was closer to 25 minutes.

These were so delicious.  Eggs were fluffy and perfectly cooked.  Very easy to make.  I did not mix cheese with the eggs but put into the muffin tin first and then filled with the egg mixture.  Very easy.

These were very tasty! I love the versatility, you can really toss in whatever is on hand! I lined the cups with bacon pieces, as directed, then put a few punches of shredded mozzarella cheese in each cup and then topped that with the egg mixture. I did not too it with Gouda cheese, we didn’t have any and I was certain that my kids wouldn’t like it. Aside from that, made the recipe exactly as written. They needed slightly longer to bake, but only by a few minutes. They made a DISASTER out of my muffin pan, I couldn’t get it clean, I had to throw it away. Next time I would try lining the tin with paper liners, or I would just make it as a casserole. Other than the expense of tossing my muffin pan, these were delicious, inexpensive, and fast! The whole family loved them!

I modified this recipe a little to fit the ingredients I had at home already. I used sausage instead of bacon and/or ham and I really wanted potatoes in it, so I added 1.5 cups shredded hash browns (thawed just enough so they wouldn’t stick together in frozen clumps). I also needed to add two more eggs to fill all 12 muffin cups, but maybe I didn’t put in enough sausage. Had to bake about 30-40 mins probably because of the partially frozen hash browns. If you make my modifications, you may want to spray the paper muffin liners because it was a little hard to get the egg out. Even with my modifications, turned out amazingly! Definitely a keeper!

Pretty tasty! It’s a bit of work for breakfast but something different. I also needed to bake mine for an extra 15 minutes. I’d make it again. Thanks for the recipe
