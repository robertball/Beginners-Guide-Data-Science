Wow, wow, wow! This was the first time I ever made a strawberry pie. I was at the grocery and spotted a container of the strawberry glaze. I decided to try this one because it had no pictures or reviews yet. I decided to make my own graham cracker crust instead of using an store bought.

I've made this recipe a few times and everyone I've made it for raves about it. I used mascarpone cheese instead and it turned out great!

You had me at "Strawberry, and pie". YUM. The ONLY thing I do differently is use less of the glaze. I only use enough to lightly coat the berries on top to kind of "gel" things together. This is so refreshing, not overly sweet, and perfect for any summer get-together. If you like strawberries, graham cracker crust, and rich, creamy cheeses...........then this is for you. :) (P.S.- I know in some areas Neufchatel would be difficult to find. You can use any smooth & creamy cheese. Just add less or more depending on the richness & consistency).

Really tasty and delicious! All I would do is add a bit more sugar to the cream cheese. It was a bit too..."cheesy" for me.

This is very easy and delicious.  I made my own graham cracker crust.  Used powdered sugar in the cream cheese mixture in place of the granulated sugar and added about a cup of cool whip free for texture. This turns out to be a relatively lower calorie and lower fat dessert with lots of goodness from fresh strawberries.   A definite keeper!  I will be making this again!

Excellent recipe....only change I made was to use mascarpone cheese and double the strawberries :).  I put the glaze in a Baggie, cut the tip off and squeezed on to top of pie, much easier that way!

Wow!  I made my own gluten free graham cracker crust, and own glaze, but the combination of the cream cheese mixture with it is superb.

This turned out really great. I did a normal pie crust instead of graham cracker but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it turned out nice and creamy with the strawberries really taking center stage.

I followed one reviewer's recommendation to use Mascarpone cheese instead, and highly recommend! I have made this pie three times in five days for different audiences (tested the pie on my husband, co-workers, and one friend who wants dessert ideas for a summertime bridal shower) and all have given it rave reviews! It's delicious and light - a perfect summertime dessert staple!

Excellent.  Bought extra ingredients, made 2 pies but after reading some notes saying "too cheesy" I cut cheese in half and it turned out to be wonderful!
