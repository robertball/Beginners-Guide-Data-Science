I've been trying for years to find the perfect sweet potato soufle recipe.  This one definitely qualifies.  I served it with my Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone raved about how delicious it was.  I found a couple of problems with the recipe, though.  In the ingredients list it calls for 1/3 c. softened butter.  Then in the directions that amount is changed to 1/4 c.  I had already measured out the 1/3 c. so I went ahead and used that much.  It was fine.  I think it works best when the margarine is melted rather than just softened, too.  The baking dish called for in the recipe is 9x13. I believe that is much too large for a single recipe.  I used one that is 8x11 and it was the ideal size.

This was a terrific recipe for using minimal ingredients.  Here's what I did to make it easy.  I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for the 3 of us.  That meant, I only used one sweet potatoe and I cubed it before boiling it so I was able to have mashed sweet potato in less than 15 minutes.  Also, I added a little orange peel zest to the mixture.  I put the entire thing in a glass pie plate and it made the presentation beautiful.  The topping crunched up perfectly and this was easy to make while managing my main course.

I made this for todays Thanksgiving dinner. It received very high remarks. The only changes I make was I doubled the topping.Also, I used two 40 oz. cans of sweet potatoes drained well. and NO ONE could tell. This really cuts the prep time in half.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made many versions of sweet potato casserole, but this is my favorite! My husband loved it. I used a 29 oz. can of yams instead of fresh ones and it came out great. I just drained and mashed them. Great recipe, easy and delicious, especially the pecan topping!

This is almost the same as my recipe,it varies in sugar and butter amount. For 3 cups sweet potatoes, I use 3 small cans of Taylor brand. I like to heat them up a bit for easier mixing in the microwave just until warm (but not necesary). Add 1/4-1/2 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup butter at room temperature, but can use right out of frige if potatoes are warm. Also add 1 tsp. vanilla ext. and 1tsp. salt.( no liquids.) Blend in mixer till smooth. Topping: 1/2 c. melted margarine, 1/2-3/4 c. brown sugar(light) Depending on how sweet you want it,and 1 c chopped nuts. I put in a 10 inch deep dish pie plate,(not necesary to grease dish) Bake 350 for 25 min. Everyone loves this dish. My kids won't touch sweet potatoes, so I don't know how kid freindly this is, but anyone who likes sweet potatoes and nuts will love this. It is a sweet vegetable and like a dessert, but I would never serve as a dessert. There are different versions of this recipe, you can't really go wrong with them. Thanks Cindy!

This was unfortunately terribly terribly sweet for us.  It is really more like a moist confection than a vegetable!  My family did not like it, but it really depends on how you like sweet potatoes done.

I have used this recipe for over a year, and brought it to Thanksgiving dinner last week.  People who were avid sweet potato haters were declaring their love for this dish.  I have never changed the recipe, it's great as is.

I used an 8x8 pan hoping for a thicker casserole and less topping. Will try a larger pan next time as the thicker layer of potato was good but a bit thick and without any texture. Next time I'll use less sugar in the topping and a medium sized baking pan. Should be just perfect!

Very good recipe.  Made a nice candy topping with nuts.  I added small marshmallows by "punching" them down into the potatoes before putting topping on.

I made this with fresh sweet potatoes, and maybe that made the difference. I found it to be too smooth, almost like a puree. i brought home a lot more of it than I would have liked. It was not a big hit.

Flavor was just like my aunt's recipe from way back.  It only makes enough for 9 inch square dish, so double it for more than 8 people if this is usually a staple at your holiday dinner like mine.  My brother in law made this in a large 9 x 13 pan and it looked like it barely covered the bottom of the pan.  Other than that, delish!

I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. It was good. 
I lessened the sugar to 3 tbsp in the filling and it was just sweet enough. I did have to bake it for much longer that it said.

This is fabulous!!  It has become a Thanksgiving and Christmas tradition in our family. I get requests for this recipe any time I carry it to a pot luck.  This best part is that it's easy to prepare.

This is always a hit at Thanksgiving and the only time I make this.  If I am making it with real sweet potatoes, I add half the sugar and then taste it right before I put it in the pan to see if it needs more sugar.  I have also made this with canned yams.  One can = 1 1/2 cups so two cans work perfect.  If I make it with the canned, I don't add any sugar until the end after I taste it.  I also do not add nuts to it.

More like a dessert than a side dish. We still love it at Thanksgiving. It's easy to make the day before & cook when you need it.

I only gave this a 3 star rating because it is WAAYYYYY TOOOOOOOOO SWEET if prepared with as much sugar as this recipe calls for.  (And I have a sweet tooth!).  I cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup and the brown sugar to 1/8 cup.  With those changes, it's a definate 5 star rating!

I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes but made this special for my dad's wife for Christmas dinner.  Oh my was this ever delish and everyone inhaled it.  Sent a couple people home with the recipe.  The only thing I did different was to add a bit less sugar than called for.  Very easy recipe and I highly recommend it.

They were delicious! Everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner loved them. I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar insteand of 2/3 cup of white sugar in the potatoes. I also used butter instead of margarine for the topping and cubed the butter into 1/4" squares.I baked it for 20 minutes then added marshmallows on top and baked until the marshmallows browned (about 5-7 minutes)

Good recipe but I like to spice it up a little.  I add 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.  Also, doesn't need milk it's moist enough without it. Add the spices and I'd give this recipe a 5+ stars.

I made this last night and it was a HUGE hit.  The low kid rating is because it's very messy.  It doesn't set up like you might think.  I used wal-nuts instead of pecans because I had those on hand.  It was fine that way too.  (My mother in law makes a version of this recipe wth pecans).  However, I am not much of a nut person and left a little with only the crumbly mixture and it was very yummy.  Bake your sweet potatoes for about 20-25 mintues and wait for them to cool.  Then cut a slit in the them and turn inside out.  Works like a charm!


Will make this one again!

This recipe has WAY too much vanilla in it.  No one liked it.  I'll pass on this one from now on.

It wasn't as solid as I thought it would be, but it turned out to be everyone's favorite--they all gobbled it up!  The topping didn't really solidify for me, but it was still delicious.

I made this casserole today to go along with our easter dinner, everyone loved it.  I made only one alteration, I used half and half instead of milk.

Goes great with soulfood....

First time making this and it was a success! It is absolutely true that even if you don't like sweet potatoes, you'll still like these! I added mini marshmallows on top of mine, just for visual appeal, alongside the pecan mixture.

This is the original, good ole Southern style sweet potato casserole I grew up eating. The best recipe I ever ate was from my friend's grantmother in Nashville, using 1/3 butter and evaporated milk in the "pudding" and 1/3 butter in the topping. Do not use margarine or low fat ingredients. Use real vanilla, not imitation.  If you have kids, leave off the topping and top with mini marshmallows. Set the casserole back into the oven and leave it in just long enought to let them begin browning. Watch them the entire time they are in the oven to avoid having "meteor casserole" with a flaming top!

the five star rating isnt enough for this recipe!  it goes beyond that. i tried this one xmas and everyone loved it! i make this now for all holidays and for a dish to pass at any event. my brother who is a chef said this is the best he has ever tasted. almost all the time i dont have the special nuts required so i just use chopped walnuts. its alot cheaper and there is no difference in the taste of the topping. THIS IS A MUST FOR EVERYONE TO TRY!!!

A Thanksgiving tradition now! But it's a bit sweet, even for me and I like sweet. So, I cut the white sugar in half, and that seemed to do the trick.

This was the first recipe I made from allrecipes.com and my introduction to the site. A friend made this for us and we loved it. She gave me the printout and I've been making sweet potatoes this way since. No more marshmallows for us. The only variations that I have made are more sweet potatoes without increasing the other ingredients. Turned out just fine. Also, I have made this recipe using butternut squash and people loved it.

Yumm Yumm !!!  I am tired of the coconut version so I searched for a new recipe..  This is it!!  I changed the serving size to 20 and it came out perfect...  I used a bit less sugar..  I would add it to taste that way it won't come out too sweet.  Everyone loved it.  Thank You So much for Sharing !!!

This recipe is fantastic!!! I made this the first time because I was just looking for something different to do when asked to bring sweet potatoes for a holiday dinner. I haven't been able to bring anything else to holiday functions since! It is the first thing requested everytime! It is a family favorite and a holiday dinner staple now! Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

I got this recipe from my sister-in-law years ago. It's a fabulous hit with my family and friends. It's works great with canned yams or sweet potatos. It's a wonderful change from the old casserole recipes that called for marshmallows on top. This is sweeter and the topping is crunchy. My mom eats this for dessert!

Trying to impress my daughter's new boyfriend from MS at our Yankee Thanksgiving I hoped this Sweet Potato Casserole would do the trick.  It did.  It was a hit with him as well as the other guests, many of which asked for the recipe.  Quick to make and the topping was the crowning glory.

Prepared for Thankgiving Day, the recipe was good but a bit too sweet & nutty for my taste; overall though it was easy to make and if I do make it again I would put less brown sugar & pecans.

I HATE the traditional sweet potato thing that every one does (with the marshmallows on top) so I assumed I hated sweet potatoes, boy was I wrong!  I personally add an additional half cup pecans IN the casserole and add about 1/4 cup maple syrup in the mix and 1/4 cup drizzled over the top.  AMAZING!!!

Diabetic Modifications: I made this recipe for the first time for an event I was attending.  As a diabetic, the amount of sugar (white and brown) in the original recipe was ridiculous, not to mention totally unnecessary.  I cut the sugar amounts in half and used less milk.  And, the amount of flour that was called for was totally unnecessary as well.  I cut 1/4 off of the original amount.  The nuts taste better when mixed with less sugar and flour.  It tasted fantastic!

I found this recipe to be very sweet, I think I would like to try it without the 2/3 cup white sugar. I think the brown sugar and pecan topping would be enough. Was also confused by the amounts in the ingredients section and the directions section having to do with the butter/margarine. If you have diabetics in your family, not a good recipe.

I found this recipe several years ago, when I was cooking Thanksgiving for only a couple people, all whom were not sweet potato lovers.  This recipe won them over and someone from my family makes it every year.  We even fight about who gets the leftovers!  I take it to potluck dinners and it is always a hit.  Make double the amount!  It takes like pie!!  Thank you for this recipe.

I made this with a large/tall can of sweet potatoes (about 4 2/3 cups) in a 9x14 dish. There wasn't enough sweet potatoes, and too much topping. It was still delicious and super sweet.  Next time, I'll use less sugar when using canned, & add some spices, but maybe not as much milk when using canned. Might not use all the topping next time either.

Very good. I followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of a teas of lemon extract with the vanilla. I think that's a good combo. Anyway I had to cook it a little longer than specified but I loved it. Even a few sweet potato "haters" were brave enough to try it and reported it was good. I did have two people though that said it was "too sweet" but hey there is a lot of sugar so it could easily be cut down. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is an easy & delicious recipe. My wife insists I make it at least once for the holidays. I use canned sweet potatoes as a shortcut instead of cooking the fresh sweet potatoes. Works out really great!

When I first made this my husband said "I don't eat sweet potatoes like that, I like mine with marshmallows."  Then he tasted these. Now, he likes his "like this".  Great recipe, excellent taste!

This was an excellent recipe. I did omitt the milk as I thought it was already quite moist.  Made it for supper for quests and was very pleased with the results and compliments that I got. I will continue to use this recipe in the future.
Thanks

So good!  I won't make my sweet potatoes any other way!  I skip the topping and simply sprinkle some pecans on top and it is wonderful!  
Thanks!

Super side dish for all times of the year! I did reduce the sugar a bit, per previous suggestions. My husband (who usually raises his nose to sweet potatoes) ate all the leftovers!

Found this way too sweet and runny. Usually for Eastern Canada we don't sweeten our vegetable dishes, this was way too much.  The second time I made this, I reduced the white sugar by 3/4 and the milk in half.  I also halved the amount of brown sugar for the topping and used a light hand for that.  The casserole turned out firmer and much better tasting.  Next time I think I will add some orange zest for a little zing!

Quite good. I especially liked the crust on top, and think I may drizzle a bit of maple syrup into it next time. The only problem I found was that the potatoes seemed to lose a bit of their flavor with all of the milk such mixed in, but I think this was probably more a function of it being hard to get good sweet potatoes in Germany. But, like others said, even people who don't like sweet potatoes were eating this dish.

This got rave reviews. I used an 8x8 pan and about 3/4 of the topping. For Thanksgiving, I will double it and use a 9x13. Thanks for the great recipe, Cindy!

This recipe is GREAT, but I cut back drastically on the white sugar and on the brown sugar topping.  I converted the recipe to metric and scaled it for 12 people.  Given that, the recipe called for 175 grams of sugar; I used only 40 grams and it was just right.  As for the topping, I just add a light sprinkle of the brown sugar-and-butter mixture over the top of the casserole before baking, just enough to flavor it, and I omit the pecans all together.  This is always a big hit whenever I serve it to my friends here in Iceland.

The name says it all!  This casserole is yummy.  It's sweet but the sweet potato flavor comes through.  If you like things less sweet, cut back on the sugar and the flavor will still be wonderful.

I made this casserole for Thanksgiving.  My husband and I both love sweet potatoes and thought this might be a nice addition to our meal.  However, it is way tooo sweet.  It was more like dessert.  It was good but much too sweet.  I don't think I will be making this again.

Very sweet but very good recipe. I particularly like the topping with pecans and brown sugar. Overall it is a real winner except for those with an aversion to sugar.

I'm not really a sweet potato casserole fan, but some family members are, so I make this at holiday time.  They really love it.  I have found many sweet potato casseroles too sweet, but this one is palatable for me.  I do reduce the white sugar in the recipe and depending on what type of serving dish you use, the topping can be reduced also to reduce the sweetness.

This was very good, but not the consistency I was expecting. For dietary needs, I reduced the sugar by half, and added some agave. With agave you need to reduce liquids in the recipe, so I did not put any milk in. That probably didint help the consistency. Mine was more fluffy than creamy. But at least there wasn't sugar overload. Will experiment by using less egg next time, but it was a good start.

Family favorite every year! Even the people who don't like sweet potatoes love this. Tastes more dessert-like than a vegetable...Sub Splenda blends for sugar to make slightly healthier.

I love this recipe.  My only change, I don't add the 1 cup of sugar to the potatoes.  I bake my sweet potatoes and that releases so much of their natural sweetness, that the added sugar is just overwhelming.  I did put a few dashes of cinnamon in my pecan mixture this year, we shall see how it goes.

Way too sweet. Next time will use far less white sugar and top with a lot less brown sugar. Tasted like dessert.
On the other hand, could put in a pie crust, thicken the sweet potatoes a bit and make a pie or tarts.

This was way too sweet.  Maybe it would have been better with less or no vanilla in it but I doubt it.  I'll stick with my regular sweet potato recipe.  This was a huge disappointment.

Fantastic recipe!!  This was the first time I had ever made Sweet Potato casserole and I had the shadow of my mother-in-law's 'world famous' recipe hovering over me.  I won't say this was better than her's, but was certainly just as good!  This one is going in my personal collection of 'keeper' recipes!

Very similar to my mom's recipe (which I couldn't find this year at Thanksgiving).  I thought there was going to be too much topping... then realized, the more the better!  It was wonderful and it's the ONLY way I'll eat sweet potatoes.  Try this one... it's a keeper!

Excellent recipe - it's true - even those who don't eat sweet potatoes will enjoy this casserole.  I will definitely make this again!

This was very easy to make, we substituted canned sweet potatoes and it turned out great.  The topping was the real showstopper.  The taste was very good, and I rated it a 5 because I kept eating it bit by bit from the baking dish even though dinner was over...I just couldn't stop.  I did cut down the white sugar a bit since others said it was too sweet.  Worked for us!

I made this for our office Thanksgiving dinner, and people actually applauded!  I've never like sweet potatoes before, and I love this recipe.

Excellent.  Probably would have been better if I would have remembered the butter in the topping mixture, but it was still good.

This recipe is exceptional! This is the best sweet potato casserole I have ever had and I will make it again. BUT it is very rich and sweet. Almost like a desert. So I could only eat a little bit at a time. This is a great casserole for a church pot-luck.

I doubled the recipe and used only 2/3 cup of white sugar for the doubled recipe so it wouldn't be too sweet.  Everyone loved it!!!  Very easy to make!

I had this at a Christmas Party at my house and had my sister, my mom, and a friend return the next day for left overs!  So I guess you know how it was.  Great choice.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and my entire family loved it.  I'm not a sweet potato fan, and I even liked it.  I had a call last night requesting that I make it for our Christmas dinner.
