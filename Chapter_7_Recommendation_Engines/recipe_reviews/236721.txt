This is a really delicious dish! I made some adjustments but i think it's still a great use of sardines. Instead of using sardines in soybean oil i used sardines in water & instead of Scotch bonnet peppers i used scotch bonnett pepper sauce because it's what I had on hand and i could control the level of spice and heat. The 2nd time i made it i added Green peppers and used grits instead of rice.  Still a wonderful flavor and very satisfying dish. The coconut oil really gives it the island flare.

Delicious. I had to make a few adjustments (no scotch peppers) because of my children and I used standard tomato because I didn't have plum but absolutely delicious, healthy and quick meal for a busy night!

I added a squeeze of lemon juice instead of salt and a splash of low sodium soy sauce.
