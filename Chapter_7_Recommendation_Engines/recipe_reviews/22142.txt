I found this to be a very good soup.  However, I made a few changes because I wanted to make a lot.  So I used 1 1/2 cups Lentils, 3 celery, 2 garlic cloves, added 2 14 oz cans of petite diced tomato's with Jalapeno's for some zest, a whole head of cabbage, 6 carrots, 5 cups of organic free-range chicken broth, and 4 cups of water.  I dbl'd the spices and added a Greek-Allspice. I ended up with a big, delicious, pot of Lentil's and veggi's.  Wonderful, healthy, and low in fat.  Cant go wrong with that!!!!

I changed the ingredients a little using 1 cup of mixed red and green lentils,2 overflowing cups of cabbage, diced canned tomates and 4 cups of broth.  All other ingredients were the same.  I did not preboil the lentils.  I cooked the onion, carrots and celery in 1 tbsp of oil for five minutes then added the remaining ingredients and simmered covered for one hour.  Absolutely delicious!!

This is a great soup!  If you don't undercook the lentils they break up and just give it a 'meaty' texture.  I doubled the chicken stock to make it less stew-like and more soup-like and added a couple tablespoons of fresh parsley.  It's easy to make, low-fat and low-calorie, and so yummy you forget it's good for you.  Definately a staple to keep on hand for munching.

I made this last night & used the scaling tool to double the recipe. I knew that 6 1-cup servings would not leave much leftovers. I did not precook the lentils as suggested - altho to take out some of the starch I rinsed & drained the lentils. I followed the amount of ingredients suggested by the tool except for these items: 1 1/2 c green lentils & 1/2 c red lentils, 3 stalks celery, 1 large onion, 4 c chicken broth & 6 cup veg. broth, many more cloves garlic 1/2 crushed 1/2 chopped, finally 1 tsp  hot curry powder.
We wanted this to be a soup as opposed to a stew so the increase of the liquid did this. The inrease in garlic and curry powder is to satisfy our personal tastes (was not too hot, but seemed to pull everything together). With a little tweaking to each persons taste,I believe that this Soup can become a mainstay for everyone.

Yum yum yum! This is a really nice vegetable soup. Flavors are great, not to mention that it is healthy and cheap. I used 4 fresh tomatoes instead of canned (canned have citric acid - I'm allergic). Because the fresh tomatoes are sweeter than canned I would leave the sugar out when using fresh. We had this for dinner with  grilled cheese sandwiches.

Excellent soup!  The curry gave it a little bite, but the flavor was nice, and it had a nice 'meaty' texture.  I didn't bother to precook the lentils, used chopped tomatoes, and doubled the broth.

If you want to speed up the chopping - I use a bag of Cole-Slaw mix. Works great!!

I've never made lentil soup before, and this turned out great. I used a can of diced tomatos to save time chopping and it was perfect. Using my food processor made this recipe a breeze.

I really liked this soup!  It did need a little extra liquid, so I added some water part way through.  The flavor is great, and it's so easy :)

I soaked a pound of lentils in water overnight, and placed the soup in the slow cooker the next morning.  I used fire roasted diced tomatoes, tons of garlic, and cut the cabbage in large shreds so it would hold up to the slow cooker.  I cooked the soup on low for 10 hours, but the carrots were slightly undercooked (it ended up being a very large batch of soup).  I cooked it another 3 hours on high, and the soup was perfect.  Really, really comforting/tasty...

WOW! Love it, hubby loved it. My hubby said do not lose this recipe :) Just finished a bowl. What I did differently was saute the onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in dutch oven til translucent. Added remaining ingredients (used only one can diced tomatoes). Did not preboil lentils. Had to add 3 more cups broth (2 cups not enough). Cooked for 1 hour maybe little longer. Excellent. Thanks for recipe.

I am trying to add some recipes to my bag of tricks, and chose this one because we were looking for something warm and healthy to try. My husband said it's the best vegetable soup he's ever had, so it's in our recipe box to stay!

I try new recipes every week and this one is a keeper.  It's truly tasty in spite of being soooo healthy (cabbage is of the cruciferous veggie group that prevents cancer; lentils help lower cholesterol because they have soluble fiber, which is hard to find).  I cooked the onions in a little oil until very soft, then sauteed the carrots and celery a few minutes as well, before adding to the soup.  I also used 2 14 oz cans diced tomatoes and 1 28 ounce can whole stewed tomatoes.

Gosh, I hate to be the first to give a bad review, but I just didn't like this recipe at all.  I followed all the instructions - just used homemade turkey stock instead of chicken broth - and still wasn't a fan of this soup.  It seemed there was something severely missing.  My son didn't like it either.  I'm giving it 3 stars because my husband, who really enjoys cabbage, liked it and ate 3 servings of it, so for fairness' sake I at least need to give it something - it could just be me, you know?

I cooked this in my crockpot on high for about 3 hours. I don't like cooked tomatoes so I subbed 1 diced sweet potato. I had a cabbage but really needed to use up my bag of coleslaw which was so much easier too! I found the soup to be bland and had to add more of the spices. We still felt like the soup was lacking, so I diced up 1 link of beef sausage & cooked it on the stovetop, then adding to crockpot. The sausage really brought the soup together for us and now I will definatly make it again.

This soup is a good staple that I frequently take to work for lunch. It's healthy and easy, but not the most interesting or exciting soup. I add a 4 oz can of tomato paste, and whatever other veggies I have, along with some cayenne.

Fantastic! It's only August here, but it's already feeling like November and this really warmed us up. I skipped the onions, added a bit more cabbage, and upped the chicken broth to about 4 cups. I stuck everything in the slow cooker and cooked it on low for about 8 hours. Great flavor and everything was cooked to perfection. I will make this again. Thank you! :)

Was actually looking for something along the lines of a cabbage soup/chicken soup but tried this recipe.  I am not a fan of "traditional" vegetable soups w/ an  emphasis on tomato based ingredients.  I should have omitted the tomatoes in this recipe but the lentils(s)/lentil flavored helped a tremendously.  After reading the other reviews, I:  used more lentils 2.5 - 3 cups [whole pkg], did not pre cook them [just rinsed well], did not use any water -- 4 cups of f/free chicken broth and threw in a dash more or so of the dry ingredients -- everything on the slow cooker for about 6 hours.  The lentils were perfect. Soup actually tasted better the day after, as leftovers.  Husband really liked it.  I will make it again but omit the tomatoes.

Even 1/4t of curry powder was too much for us!  I added more chicken stock to dilute the curry flavor, and that worked well.  This is a thick soup, more like a stew.  Easy recipe for crockpot - 8 hours on low cooked all the veggies and raw lentils through.

This is a fantastic soup!  This latest time I was out of cabbage, so I substituted fresh spinach leaves, and it was delicious that way, too.

Perfectly delicious! I followed the recipe to a "Tee", and the seasonings were spot-on perfect. I did double the amount of chicken broth but made no other changes. This is a KEEPER!!  Thank you, Cecile, for sharing.

Loved it!  After 45 minutes of simmering I added another 2 cups of chicken broth and fresh cracked black pepper.  I then simmered for another 45 and it was perfect!

I agree that the lentils don't need to pre-cook.  If you cook them first (as the recipe instructs), and then add them to the vegetables while they cook,, the lentils will be mushy.  Better to cook the lentils and vegetables all at the same time. This soup is a little bland, but any cook can spice it up according to their preferences.

Very good! Only things I changed was that I used 4 cups of the broth, used a can of diced tomatoes, added zuchinni and added some italian chicken sausage (hubby complains when there is no meat.)  The spices are perfect, but I'd go with less salt next time. I cooked the lentils like it said in the recipe and then thru it all in the slow cooker all day on low. Thanks for a very healthy recipe.

Delicious soup!  This was such a delight for both its flavor and it's simplicity.  I doubled the recipe and am glad I did, because we are certainly looking forward to the leftovers!  I didn't have any celery on hand, so I added another cup of cabbage to make up for it & threw in a handful of corn kernels that were laying around.  I used diced tomatoes instead of the whole peeled and it worked out great.  I also used a lot more garlic, but we do love our garlic.  Other than that, everything else was perfect.  Thank you so much for this keeper of a soup recipe!  We absolutely love it!

I made this in my slow cooker.  Had to add a lot more spice or else it would have been pretty tasteless!  Just alright the first day, but much tastier on the 2nd.

Great recipe!  We made it as directed, except for the exclusion of currey (we were all out), and it turned out great.  We even made some more to freeze for a quick lunch or supper.  The pepper adds a good amount of spice, so if you're sensitive, you might want to cut it down a little, however we enjoyed the kick. All in all, this is a hearty, filling, inexpensive, and low fat\ low cal recipe that is tasty as well.  Great job!

Just okay. I did as others and upped my lentils to one cup. I think I will make it again, but without the curry. With shredded cabbage, it tasted like a wierd indian sauerkraut.

Only ok-- the lentils are the best part. I used a full cup of red lentils and upped the broth to 3 cups. Instead of plain cabbage, I used a package of broccoli slaw. I didn't have any celery, so I added some celery flakes. I upped the spices a little since I added more broth. I cooked it in a crockpot for 4 hours on high and around 1 on low. The end result was fine, but it didn't reheat well and the color turned kind of blah... The beans pretty much turned to mush after a day. The soup was fine the first go around, but nothing spectacular.

This soup was very good, although a little bit too spicy for me.  Next time I will eliminate the pepper and add more lentils.

Really enjoyed this soup. Did it in the crock pot.Our lentils were a little al dente but it offered a nice texture. Didn't have curry so we used Mediterranean seasoning and it was great. I think this would be good with barley. Thanks for a great lentil recipe!

I thought this was pretty flavorless, despite adding more spices - and the cabbage, in my opinion, was not a good addition.  Maybe Kale or a heartier green and the addition of some sweet potato, celery root, white potato even some cannelini beans would give it more dimension.

Picked this because I was looking for a slow-cooker soup with lentils, and this seemed easy and potentially good.  Was pleasantly surprised by the amount of flavor!  And that the vegetables kept some texture, even after being in a slow-cooker all day!  Followed some of the modification suggestions, but thought that I'd need to add some hot sauce, or Worchestershire, or SOMETHING to boost the flavor before serving - didn't need to.  And I love that with minor modifications I can make this fully vegetarian (even vegan, I think), and low-sodium.  Now I just hope it freezes well.

This was surprisingly good.  Next time I may double the recipe to have more leftovers... it cooks down quite a bit.  I let if in my slowcooker for about 6 hours - 4 on high, 2 on low.

This is a great soup that can be adjusted for each persons taste.  I doubled the and added 4 cups additional broth to give it a more soup consistency, per other reviewers.  I used 2 fresh tomatoes diced, I would use more next time and I used 3 TBSP garlic, but the garlic needs to be crushed in order to be tasted I think so I would use whole clove crushed next time.  I added 1/2 tsp chili powder, and it adds a nice kick.  Next time I think I would use cayenne instead.  I will make this next time with out the extra salt, as the broth adds enough.  delicious. made this in a slow cooker on high for 3 hours, came out great

This is a very hearty soup for having no meat in it.  Pretty tasty too.  I had no trouble with the lentils being soft following the directions.  They were cooked through.  The only thing I did different was to sauté my carrots, onion, garlic and celery in a little olive oil before adding the broth and tomatoes.  I think it is the key to a good tasting soup.  Just took the lentils out and drained added the evoo and veggies, quick sauté and then followed the recipe again.  If I make this again I will forgo the whole tomatoes and use the petite diced tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing Cecile.

This is an excellent and very flavorful soup! It doesn't look like much, but the taste is great! I found it to be quite spicy...I loved this, but others in my family didn't. I didn't have the 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes, so I used what I had: a 14 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes instead. As they were already cut up and didn't contain much liquid, I filled up the can with water after pouring the tomatoes into the soup, and added that as well. This was the only change I made...the only thing about this recipe that I had a problem with was the length of time to cook the lentils. I found that they were still hard after 15 minutes; I cooked mine for about 8 minutes more before they were soft enough. Thanks again for sharing the recipe...I'll be making this again!

Made this for dinner last night replacing chicken broth with vegetable broth and sauted the onion, celery, and carrots in olive oil before adding to the pot. My husband said it's his new favorite soup!  Thanks for the tasty recipe.  It's a great soup for the cool weather we're having now.

This was so good.  I added a diced potato and an extra half cup of lentils.  I simmered it for 1 hour and it was done, just right.  I just had a huge bowl and wished I was still hungry so I could eat more. Thanks for this easy, yummy recipe.

This was pretty good. It was a little too "cabbagey" for my family, and next time I will use less cabbage. The lentils cooked up beautifully tho' and were very nicely proportioned in the dish, not too heavy and thick yet substantial enough. I served this topped with broiled fresh salmon, which was great as the flavors complemented each other perfectly. In fact it made for a quick make ahead dinner. Lentil soup made earlier in the day and then reheated and fish broiled with salt and pepper 5 minutes before serving. Low fat, nutritious and waistline friendly!

Yum! DH and I really enjoyed this. The curry added a nice depth, and the black pepper gave it more zip than I had imagined (that's a good thing for us, though!). I used 3/4 c lentils, veg broth instead of chicken, and added about 3 cups EXTRA water. I didn't pre-cook the lentils, either--1.5 hours is more than enough time to get them cooked! Thanks for a good recipe!

I was excited about this because of all the rave reviews, but was disappointed.  It just didn't work for us.  It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't say that it was good either.  My husband said that he'd eat it again if I made it again, and my 2 & 4 year olds didn't eat more than one bite.  Oh, well.

this is sooo good!  I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole and used 3.5C chicken broth and 1.5 cups lentils I didn't cook the lentils before hand.  It is great recipe because you can mix it up some.  
Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit with everyone in my family. It was very easy and the sort of meal where anything goes...I used brown lentils, diced tomato, no curry powder, etc. It's the lovely sort of soup where you can through in just about any kind of vegetable. I'm not usually a big lentil or vegetable soup fan, but this was surprisingly good. The leftovers were good for lunch the next day too although there wasn't a whole lot of broth left.

Very hearty soup. I was never a lover of lentils, but this recipe has changed my mind.  As simple a recipe as you would like.  I also will try playing with the seasonings a little the next time I make this.  This recipe lends itself to that kind of experimentation.

I love homemade soup and this is an excellent recipe.  I made only minor changes.  I added some peeled and chopped parsnips because they needed to be used. They have such a sweet flavor they are very good in almost any vegetable soup. I had red cabbage and it was great in this.  I sauteed all the vegetables except the cabbage in a little olive oil and then added everything and brought to a boil and then simmered until done.  I liked the spices and next time I may add more curry because the curry powder I have is very, very mild.  
This is a delicious and easy soup.  Plus it is so flexible.  Add other canned beans like white beans at the end.  Or add a little pasta. Add other vegetables .  I think a diced sweet potato would be great in this soup. Add cooked ham, sausage or chicken.

I should have looked at the ingredient list more carefully before making this, I wouldn't really call this a lentil soup, so it wasn't really what I was looking for.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good soup, but it seemed to me that the tomatoes and cabbage were much more prominent, and to me it was just a "vegetable soup".

I cooked this for a hungry group of teenage boys. I tripled the recipie and it was perfect for 6 teens. They liked it and I liked the low cost. I followed the recipie, except for the curry. I did not add any curry; I doubt they would have liked it. Oh, I also ommitted the sugar.

As written, 3 stars. Embellished, 4 stars. It's a great starting off recipe.  I sautéed the veggies, except for the cabbage,  in olive oil, then added about 5 cups of homemade veggie stock, tomatoes, lentils and cabbage and nearly tripled the spices including lots of black garlic pepper and simmered everything for about an hour. It was really good. Better the next day and freezes well.

This is a wonderful, easy, healthy recipe.  I did find that it needed a little more salt and I also added a splash of hot sauce to give it a little kick.  I served with crackers and even my meat-loving fiance loved it!

This recipe is very good as written.  I have gone back and made it a second time making a few changes, however.  I basically just doubled the recipe except for the carrots and sugar.  Instead of the stewed tomatoes, I had diced on hand, so I used a 14 oz regular diced and a 14 oz with green chiles. I also increased the celery by maybe half.  The second time, I only had brown lentils on hand, so I used those instead.  Second time around was also good, if a little different.

This is yummy! The curry is really what separates this veggie soup from others, so don't leave it put! I didn't precook lentils, and I used about 6 cups of homemade stock. I doubled the curry because of this.

I did not care for this recipe. I tried it last night. 
I prepared Jenny's variation. It has such a strong flavor to onion (which I like, but I expect to taste other flavours as well), the thyme didn't seem to work either, the amount of cabbage was excessive, and the least of the ingredients, which you could barely see or taste were the lentils. 
My family loves lentils, but this recipe was a disappointment.

This recipe has potential, but for our tastes, we'll try a different, more filling recipe next time.  I doubled the lentils, broth and spices and it still wasn't filling enough.  Already the teenager is looking for something else to eat.  Thanks for the different recipe, though.

Just made this for the first time today and enjoyed 2 big bowls for lunch. This soup is amazing! I have never even had lentils before but had just bought some to try. Tweaked the recipe to what i had on hand and prepared the lentils as directed beforehand. After 2 hours on high in crockpot the soup was still 'al dente' and no mushiness at all.  Skipped the sugar - it doesn't need it with the carrots, added one zucchini squash sliced into crescents, replaced the whole tomatoes with 2 smaller cans of diced tomotoes. Had no celery but added celery salt (and skipped the extra salt) Did not add any cabbage. Added a little extra broth 1/3 cup maybe.  The smell wafting in my house was fabulous - couldn't wait to dig in. Easy, low fat, low sugar and high fiber - perfect!

Absolutely loved! Super filling. I didn't have any carrots or cabbage, but it turned out great without. I did add some frozen mixed veggies at the end, doubled the spices, and didn't add the sugar.

Delicious! I added some extra veggies, especially cabbge (I'm obsessed!0 but even as is I'm sure it would still be a great soup. Oh and like some other readers suggested, I sauteed the onion, carrots and celery for a few minutes before putting them in the slow cooker.

I had to omit cabbage & carrots because I didn't have those ingredients on hand. I added chicken and a can of rotel (tomato & corn) and it was absolutely delicious. I have made this soup on more than one occasion and it is consistently satisfying. I have substituted beef broth for chicken broth and added potatoes, depending on what I have on hand. It's really hard to mess this soup up, each tweek was as delicious as the next.

Healthy, economical and easy. I threw it all in the crockpot for about 10 hours on low and it could have stayed even longer. A little bland but some added hot sauce did the trick. Definitely a keeper

This was really good!  I also did not preboil the lentils since so many had good results without this step. It worked out fine. I doubled the garlic and the lentils. I did have to add some water, needed more liquid. Next time I may add more tomatoes or broth. I really liked the flavor combination of the seasonings. It had a somewhat Italian flavor with a bit of extra kick from the curry powder. But I would not consider it hot or spicey. It was good with a sprinkle of parmesan-yum! I also used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes to save time. I will definitely make this again!

A wonderful dish.  I made this in a slow cooker, and it had to cook on high for about 8 hours.  I accidentally used 2 tsp of curry powder instead of 1, but everything else was exactly as per the recipe.  I loved it, and so did my husband.  I did have to precook the lentils as the recipe says, but I did that while chopping all of the veggies.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I wanted to love this, but it tasted like a very mild minestrone. Too much tomato for my families taste. I did not precook the lentils and it worked out well with a nice texture.

This is a yummy vegetable soup, and my first time cooking with lentils.  I used brownish lentils because they were the cheapest at the store, and doubled the recipe because we were having company for dinner and I didn't know if 6 one-cup servings would be enough for the 5 of us if someone wanted seconds.  I ended up having a TON of soup leftover and froze some of it.

Great soup!  Thanks for the tip to pre-boil and soak the lentils, it really help.

This was a very tasty soup...it usually has to be exceptional for me to give a 5...it's not exceptional but I'm giving it a 5 because it is very tasty AND healthy which is sometimes difficult to find.  I boiled and shredded 2 chicken breasts for some added protein and have been enjoying the left overs all week! :)

I used a whole bag of lentils, added more water and chicken base, increased seasonings to accomodate extra liquid and served with fresh whole wheat rolls.

Fresh, delicious, comforting and filling in a cold day. I followed the recipe but subbed a can of petite diced tomatoes, used 4 cups of chicken broth and added a dash of cumin. Great recipe! Thank you :)

Made some changes simply because I didn’t have all the ingredients on hand,  but it was a wonderful, warm winter soup/stew. Will definitely make it again. 

After reading other reviews, I did double the stock (4 C) and used red potatoes (instead of cabbage). I also added fennel seeds and fresh chopped anise (didn’t have celery). To round it out I added a couple cups of spinach with 10 minutes left. Good base recipe.

Delicious soup. I had no canned tomatoes so I used tomato paste instead. Which worked out well and made the broth a bit thicker. I will definitely make this again

This soup was easy to throw together and very good. I made mine in the slow cooker. At the advice of others I used the coleslaw mix. I didn't have any basil on hand, so I used canned stewed Italian style tomatoes and chopped them. For lentils I used a mix of red and yellow. I did find I had to add a bit extra broth and cooking time was around 7 hrs on low to fully cook the yellow lentil. Will definitely keep this as a staple!

A wonderful soup - would recommend 100%. Incredibly healthy with so many fresh veggies. Very easy to put everything together in one pot. I just put it in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours & it turned out perfectly.

I normally try to stick pretty close to recipes the first time I make them, but I made some changes this time. First of all I didn't use chicken broth because I wanted the recipe to stay vegetarian so I used vegetable broth. I also felt that the quantity of liquid was too little for the soup so I used about 3 cups of vegetable broth and 2 of water. I also used a bit more cabbage than the recipe calls for simply because I had half a medium head left so I used it all. It turns out I was out of dried basil so I used the paste I had in my fridge. I just used a squeeze or two. I also forgot to buy the tomatoes at the store so I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes and a can of Mexican stewed tomatoes. That doesn't sound like it should work together but it was fine. Finally I felt like the recipe needed a bit of a tang as I tasted it, so I added some apple cider vinegar. This is a really flexible recipe that I think you can mix up as you want, but I think this  is a good base recipe.

This had too much tomato in it. I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up and than we ate it with some plain yogurt or sour cream to cut the strong tomato taste.  I won't  make it again.

Tasty and forgiving recipe...alot going on with baby needs/care while making recipe so looked at it and then "went from memory" sat down to look at recipe afterwards and realized my memory wasn't particularly accurate; Here's what I had done: threw 1.5 onions in food processor then into pan with olive oil, tumeric/salt stirred/let cook; carrots in food processor then into pan; yogurt container of frozen purreed tomatoes in and one box of chicken broth then put lid on kept stirring and breaking chunk apart; added rinsed lentils; garlic powder, marjorum, thyme, black pepper, more salt, curry powder, green beans that snapped ends off of and threw in food processor for moment; kept stirring and boiling/simmering;  added some red quinoa for lastish 15 minutes after rinsing it; added pumpkin puree from refrig  from pumpkin that had roasted previously.  Cooked till tasted ready; served with corn bread and cheese- we enjoyed enough that I took the time to think back on what had done cause my husband wanted me to make it again sometime...

Fantastic!  I converted for vegan.  Vegetable not chicken broth, half the salt and pepper, 1 1/2 cloves garlic, 1/2 cup onion, maple syrup not white sugar, added a bay leaf and a scrubbed medium potato cut into small cubes.  I had a leek in the fridge so I chopped it up and included it.  Fried the garlic and onion in a little veggie broth before throwing it in. One of the cans of chopped tomatoes was basil garlic and oregano.
There is plenty of salt in the broth and the canned tomatoes.  I will forego adding salt next time.  At serving time offer cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper at the table for more bite.

Very tasty and filling. I added some leftover ham and that was a great addition! No other changes except using diced and crushed tomatoes (some of each) instead of cutting up whole ones.

I modified this slightly, but still quite good. 1 c dried lentils. Half large onion. 4 cloves crushed and chopped garlic. 1 can diced tomatoes w/ juice. 1 can vegetable broth. Two tbsp rani hot yellow curry powder. 4 small red potatoes chopped. 1 cup baby carrots chopped and I don't measure dried seasonings. Use best judgement: pepper, salt, basil, cumin, red pepper, celery flakes, dash cinnamon, and oregano. Dump everything in a crock pot with two cups of water, mix and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours :)

I made this & my family liked it.  I didn't like it, much.   I think it was the Thyme...   I'm gonna make it, again w/o the Thyme, maybe some more spice... like some red pepper flakes.  I'll let u know.

I love this recipe as a guideline. To be honest, I've never made it exactly as suggested. I use much more celery, carrots than suggested. I also substitute  chopped turkey bacon and ham with the veggies. I replace the curry powder with chili powder. I also increase the water and chicken boullion to make it soupier and less like a stew. That being said, it's a GREAT base for a soup idea, and super fun to play around with.

Excellent! I did make some changes. First, I substituted vegetable stock for chicken stock to make the dish vegan. Then I added an extra 1/4 cup of dry red lentils and 1 1/2 cups of additional stock because of the added lentils. I used crushed tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. And I added 3 oz. of dry small shells that were cooked al dente and then added to the finished soup. With the addition of the extra lentils and shells, it made it a complete one-pot meal. I made three dinners out of it. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!!

I thought this soup was just heavenly. So warm and filling and full of good for you things!
I did make some changes. I didn't have dried thyme or curry powder, so I substituted them with oregano and garam masala respectively. I also added a few handfuls of chopped kale for extra green.
Added some parmiggiano reggiano on top and it was divine.

Made this last night.  Very good.  I didn't precook the lentils.  I put everything in my presser cooker and cooked it for 7 min.  Turned out perfect.  Added some frozen peas when it was done.  Was a hit.

This was absolutely wonderful!!!!!!!   I followed the advice of another review by making the recipe with more lentils and liquids and it lasted us for several meals.  We love to heat up soup for lunch with a grilled cheese sandwich or bread during the cold winter months. Here is the review that I followed: "to take out some of the starch I rinsed & drained the lentils. I followed the amount of ingredients suggested by the tool except for these items: 1 1/2 c green lentils & 1/2 c red lentils, 3 stalks celery, 1 large onion, 4 c chicken broth & 6 cup veg. broth, many more cloves garlic 1/2 crushed 1/2 chopped, finally 1 tsp hot curry powder."

This is a great soup. I made a few alterations..I added smoked turkey sausage, 2 14 oz cans of diced tomoatoes (one was fire roasted), and extra chicken stock and water. I also sauteed the onions, carrots and celery and I did not precook the lentils as other reviewers had suggested..I cooked about 8 hrs in crockpot and it turned out great! The house smelled great too.

This is very good and pretty simple to make.  I made a few slight changes - I doubled the chicken broth because I don't think there was enough liquid.  I also added 3 garlic cloves and zucchini.  Delicious.

This is a solid recipe for a healthy and economical stew. To me, it was good, but not delicious. For just a little bit more effort, you can make what I consider to be pretty delicious lentil soup. I really like "Slow Cooker Lentil and Ham Soup," by queendiva1. Of course, the soup would no longer be vegetarian.   Like others mentioned, the curry in this stew is fantastic. I added the amount called for in the recipe, but if I make this again, I will definitely add more. I would also consider adding hot sauce to stew with the vegetables, as opposed to adding it later just as a condiment.   What I didn't enjoy is the canned tomatoes. Everyone's palate is different, but I am realizing that the taste of canned tomatoes is a big turn off for me. If you don't mind tomato skin in your soup, it wouldn't be too hard to chop up some fresh tomatoes to throw in the pot.

DH really liked this one!  I would by lying if I didn't say I made some changes.  Like most soups, you can make minor changes without affecting the recipe drastically.  I added 1/4 lb. hamburger, 3 tbs. catsup, 1 tbs. balsamic vinegar and a couple of tbs. of butter.  Some nice Oatmeal Dinner Rolls from this site and a cottage cheese salad rounded out the meal.  YUM!  And......it may actually be good for you.

This is very good the way it is.  However, I do add smoked sausage and once the soup is done, add a splash of vinegar.  This is how my Mom used to make it.

Yum! My husband thought it was just "pretty good", but I thought it was delicious! I added more curry powder and some red pepper, bc we like spicier food. Also, did not preboil the lentils, just added more liquid to the soup.

We loved this soup!!  Even my husband, who didn't think he'd like it because it looked so "tomato-y."  I had some fresh tomatoes on hand that needed to be used up so I used those and a small can of dices tomatoes.

When I made this soup, I doubled the lentils and the chicken broth. I also added more curry powder than it called for. It was quite good, but it could have used some more flavour. It tastes much better the next day (like most soups I think). All in all, this soup is very cheap to make so I will likely make again and play around with the spices a little.

Really tasty.  I used one cup of lentils and added more broth and the curry adds a nice warmth without being too spicey.

I was suprised at how good this soup was. I did not add the sugar, but did cook with a package of skinless, boneless chicken thighs, which shredded easily into the soup when it was done. Very hearty!

Pretty good, but I would leave out the thyme, increase the curry and add more spices, maybe coriander and tumeric.  I added chopped jalepeno's for a little more spice. I would also like to try adding a yam, cubed, and maybe even a white potato too.

Made this tonight for the first time and my dh & I both loved it. I added about cup & a half of chopped turkey that we had leftover from Christmas, but other than that I followed it exactly (which isn't like me). I'll definitely be making this again this winter!

This soup is incredibly good! I myself made some changes, but it was an excellent start for a newbie to lentil soup!

I omitted curry powder (maybe next time), had no tomatoes of any kind other than paste (oh i wish i had, they would have been great), and used some cauliflower and red skinned potatoes. I also used fresh herbs instead of dried, but either is quite good.

Delicious!

Tasty and easy to make, even for the culinary-challenged like myself. I've used canned lentils and dried - either way it turns out well. I did have to add an extra cups of water and the juice from the tomatoes because the broth alone does not seem to add enough liquid.

This is a great recipe!!  It was a little spicy with the curry-so I just leave it out.  This soup is also good with a little diced chicken in it.

This was truly awful!  It smelled bad and tasted even worse.  It was too salty and lacked any appreciable flavour.  I actually ended throwing it out.

This was very good. I used vegetable stock and added fresh mushrooms and carrots. Served it to friends who loved it!

Good soup.  It reminded me of beef vegetable soup.
