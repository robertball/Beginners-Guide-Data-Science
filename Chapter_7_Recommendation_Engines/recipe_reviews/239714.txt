The aroma that comes from this while cooking is incredible. This is a healthy stick-to-your-ribs breakfast made with real pumpkin and spiced like pie. Make over your steel cut oats for fall with this recipe. Four stars only because I believe that it needs at least two tablespoons of brown sugar in the cooking process and then topped with a bit of brown sugar when served.

This was a huge hit with my entire family!  I didn't have steel cut oats on hand so I used Quaker oats instead.  I used the ratio of oats to water on the package and it turned out fine.  I did add 2T of brown sugar while it cooked and I'm glad I did.  I think it needed that added sweetness.  I will definitely make this one again.

I made this recipe exactly as indicated. It smelled absolutely delicious when it was cooking, but I was kinda disappointed with the flavor. To me it was very bland, even with all the spices added. I had to really clobber it with maple syrup to give it flavor.

Another winning oatmeal recipe for me.  I love oatmeal and always excited to try new combinations and recipes for it.  Gave this a go and it was great.  I will use a bit less milk next time as it was a bit runny but, I will definitely make it again.  Thank you.

Very good. I used old fashioned oats. I added about 1/4 teaspoon salt. I served  a variety of nuts and dried fruits and some brown sugar on the side, for the family members to top their oatmeal to taste.
I made another time using  pumpkin butter instead of pumpkin puree and omitted the sugar and the spices. It was even better this way.

Perfect recipe. Made mine with fresh pumpkin pur√©e and replaced milk with soy. Finished with maple drizzle and toppings of my choice :)
