This is definitely not a thick gravy.  It's a dumpling soup, with the egg and flour making tiny dumplings that cook quickly in the beef broth.  In my family, we added fresh or canned tomatoes as well.

This is really some wonderful stuff!  Perfect for a cold day.

This is not thick gravy as another reviewer wrote. If made correctly it's like tiny dumplings in the beef soup. It tasted quite good and is an extremely cheap soup that is very filling.

You cut the flour/egg mixture into "ribleys" and drop them into the broth to cook.  My mom added tomato (sauce?) to the broth as well.

I made this soup for a quick lunch.  It's fast and simple.  It's also a good base that you can modify to your own tastes.  I added left over green beans and topped it with saut√©ed cabbage with a squirt of hot sauce.  My 3 year old son enjoyed his plain - just the dumplings and broth - and loved it.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Made according to directions but added veggies and pinto beans.  Also added season salt, garlic powder and Basil to pressured cooked stew meat. Delicious!

We loved it. It was delicious. I did add peas and carrots to it and a little salt. Definitely is a keeper and will make it again soon.
