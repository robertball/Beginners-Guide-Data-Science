This turned out surprisingly delicious, but I did modify it a lot to suit my family's tastes.  The main thing I did was precook the zucchini (steamed for about 5 minutes) & brown the ground beef. (I substituted 1 pound of ground turkey.)  Cooking raw ground beef/turkey w/o browning never seems to turn out well for me.  I omitted the water & salt (unnecessary) as well as the jalapeno pepper (my family doesn't do spicy) & used just 1 teaspoon of black pepper.  I also substituted reduced fat Cheddar slices for the American cheese.  I assembled the casserole as directed, then put it in the oven for just 5 minutes.  Then I took it out to put the basil on it, & stuck it in the oven for 5 more minutes.  It was ready to eat.

This recipe makes no sense.  1/2 zucchini and 1/2 lb beef does not cover a 9X13 pan.  Raw beef does not "spread gently."  The cheese burns because it is put on too soon.  We ended up keeping the beef and made tacos.

I liked this recipe but my boyfriend didn't seem to like it as much. It was something different then the usual for me. At first I thought using one whole jalepeno would be too hot but once it cooked it actually tasted good within the casserole. I would have gave it three and half stars actually.
