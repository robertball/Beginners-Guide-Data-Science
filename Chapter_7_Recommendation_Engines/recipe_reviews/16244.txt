Very good!!  When my dough was done and I went to make the balls, it totally collapsed into a gooey pile, but I still dipped the wads in the butter, and then in my herbs and parm, and after I let it rise it looked like real dough again.  In the end it was perfect!!  Tasted great, my whole family loved it.  Just don't worry if it looks like it flopped, it will come out OK in the end.  WONDERFUL!!  Thank you, Susanne!

I just baked this tonight for the first time (and pretty much only my 2nd time to ever make bread) and it was brilliant. I always tweak recipes, and I dont have a breadmaker, so I started off with warming the water, mixing in the sugar and sprinking the yeast over to foam/cream for a while, before mixing in the rest of the ingredients to make the dough, kneading and allowing to rise for 30min. Then following with breaking off hunks and dipping in the butter, mixed herbs minced garlic etc, and putting in the pan, and again allowing to rise before baking. I also probably had closer to 2 cups of flour as the dough was a bit sticky, and it was still sticky ish but probably easier to handle after that. Oh and I don't really measure my seasonings so they were probably 2x the recipe. The result was beautiful soft bread with a nice hint of garlic and subtle herb flavours, and cheese and tomato that i sprinkled on top. It had a lovely thin crust, and broke apart easily.   Thank you for this wonderful idea! I plan to use the base of the recipe for sweet bread and different savoury flavour combos, as well as a basic white loaf.  Hope for people who dont have breadmakers! :)

This was a huge hit at the dinner table! This wonderful bread accompanied our Valentine Meal.  The Kids loved pulling thier piece of bread apart from the bread ring.  We all loved the taste too!! My bread machine did the hard work while I prepared the other parts of the meal. This is permanently in my recipe box!!  Thank YOU!!

These were sinfully amazing. I changed it up a bit. After I pulled the dough from the pan I kneeded flour into it as it was too sticky. Then I preped 1/4 cup butter melted, 6 cloves minced garlic, fresh diced rosemary and about 1 heaping tsp of thyme in a bowl. I dipped the bread pieces in there and put them in a 9x13 pan. After I basted on the remainder of the mixture adding 1 leaf of rosemary to the top of each. Then I grated parmesian and cheddar and sprinkled it ontop prior to baking. My fiance ADORED THEM. They were awesome! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe!  It is easy to make and so delicious.  You can add
other spices/herbs to suit your taste.  Be prepared for the compliments.
Thanks, Susanne for this wonderful addition to my recipe box.

My family really likes this recipe.  It is especially fun for my teenage girls to make since it is so uncomplicated.  I would change one thing, though, which makes it a lot easier.  We melt the 1/4 butter and then add the cheese and herbs to the same bowl.  That way we only have to dip the dough balls in one bowl, and the herbs & cheese are distributed much more evenly through the bread.

This recipe was okay, but it didn't blow me away.  I will stick to the sweet version of bubble bread.

Wow!!!  My hubby absolutely loved this bread, his friends too.  I used an angel food pan, and it came out looking like it came from a fancy bakery.  I used crushed garlic right in the melted butter.  The first time I made this I mixed the herbs with the butter, and ended up needing more, the butter soaked into the herbs. The second time I rolled them in butter then in the herb mixture, and they were quite messy, and I got a bit too much herb on the balls, cause they were so wet.  Next time I will mix the herbs with the butter, and make a bit extra, it seemed to go on more evenly.  I used freshly grated parmesan cheese and sprinkled it over each layer both times, and it was really nice.  I used shredded cheddar the second time(sprinkled between layers) mmmmm it was really good.  I didn't have the herbs called for so I just made a mixture of oregano, basil, parsley, and dehydrated onion.

This bread was so much fun to pull apart and eat.  We had it with baked spagetti and also with beef stew.

I bet it would be good to do this with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon,  maybe a Christmas morning treat.

This bread made such a good impression on my family.  Like most other reviews I found the dough to be incredibly sticky once it came out of the bread maker.  I kneaded it with a little more flour to make it a bit easier to handle.  I used my own Italian herbs, minced garlic and Parmesan cheese for the topping, I added this to the melted butter, which meant I only had to dip the dough once.  Next time I think I am going to try using olive oil rather than butter, which I think is more traditional with the toppings I used.  The bread was very easy to make, looked great and tasted amazing!

I am not sure what I did wrong, but the ratio of liquid to flour in this recipe seems way off. The dough was terribly gooey. I had to throw it out, sorry. Might try again at some point, not sure.

Fantastic!! I will be making this regularly! I did use 3 cloves of crushed garlic instead of the garlic powder and mixed it and the other herbs in with the melted margarine and just dunked the pieces of dough in that. I sprinkled the cheese and a little bit of oregano on top ... I love it!!!

I am not sure what went wrong!  I was very excited to try this after the fantastic ratings but I thought that it tasted awful.  The herbs were WAY too strong.  I will not be making this again.

Very Good!!! I am still new with my bread machine but this was perfect and easy. I did have to problem with it being sticky, but like others i just put it in flour once I got it out of the machine. I also had to double to spices because my fiance is a fan of lots of flavor. After all of the pieces were in the pan i sprinkled a little bit of shredded parmasen cheese on top of the dish so it would have a cheese top.

It was very good, and we will make again. I paired it with Spagetti, so it was delicious to dip into the Sauce. It is a nice change from the traditional Garlic Bread. I am also going to try and make a sweet version from this recipe. Thank You!

Served with Minestrone Soup. Used onion powder instead of minced onion (1/4 tsp). Added a small amount of garlic powder on top at end. Took about 35 minutes to cook. The 1/4 cup of butter at end is way too much and the topping not quite enough for the amount of bread.

This bread was awesome!!  I had no trouble making it.  I just had to triple the spices.  But wow!!  Goes great with spagettii and meatballs.  My family of 4 almost ate the whole thing.  Great recipe.

cooked just as described. It did fill the pan, I did not run out of spices. turned out great. I have had better bread in my life, but this was a good savory bread that I can do myself. Edited to add. When I originally made it, it was served with a sage-rubbed roast. It was great. The next night I ate it with Italian and it was weird/gross because the spices clashed. Make this with the same spices as you make your main dish.

I made this bread as a gift for someone. I actually had to make 2 of them because the first one smelled so good. This bread is heavenly. I followed the recipe to the T and added a little more parm cheese to the top before baking. Wonderful.

Hmmmmm, just don't know about this one.  Three stars for flavor, but my "dough" was more like a sponge you make for sourdough bread.  There was no way I could cut it into 20 pieces, or roll it into balls.  According to bread-making books, you should use 3 ounces of liquid to 1 cup of flour.  I should've known better, but wanted to try it anyway.  It definitely needs much more flour.

Awesome. I freaked out when I found the dough to be heavy and sticky out of the bread maker. I even kneaded in some flour to make it easier to handle. After reading reviews, probably not necessary. Did not rise much before baking, but turned out great after baking!

i cheated on this but am giving it 5 stars because the coating for the bread balls is yummy and was perfect for what i was looking for.  I used canned biscuits, quartered and tossed in the butter and coating then baked for almost 25 minutes.  i needed something quick and recalled a "Pampered Chef" party i went to where they made bubble pizza.  i had all the ingredients for this but not the time for yeast dough.  The canned biscuits were something I was used to also for sweet Bubble Bread.  And a staple in my frig.

I added sliced mushrooms, olives and bacon to the dough when the bread-maker beeped for additional ingredients. The mushrooms pretty much disintegrated during the rest of the kneading, but it gave a lovely colour and subtle flavour to the bread. However, mushrooms are mostly water so my dough ended up very wet. I don't mind that, I'm used to working with wet doughs, and they tend to rise much faster than drier ones.  If your dough is very wet like mine, always dust your hands with flour before working with each ball, it makes much easier to handle. You can also dust the work surface and your knife, if you use one to cut the dough.  The result was a huge success. The bread is sweet, melts in your mouth and has an amazing array of rich flavours. The butter makes the outside very crispy too. I'll try olive oil instead of butter next time, reducing the overall fat content.

Good flavor with easy dough to work with. I made in a muffin pan. Used two balls of dough in each.  A little chewy.

These were great! I didn't have time to let the dough rise twice, but that didn't matter. After they were finished kneading in the bread machine, I took them out and dressed them up with the butter and parmesan cheese mixture. They ended up crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Highly recommended!!!

This was very good. I mixed my herbs with the butter as other had suggested. They bread is very light and delicious. I did replace one cup of all purpose flour with wheat.Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband was literally moaning as soon as he tasted this bread! I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so I substituted Romano for the Parm. cheese, and used granulated garlic, dried chives, basil, thyme, and organo. I shared some with friends and just the fragrance leaking through the ziploc bag had them drooling!

This bread is amazing. It is so simple to make. So many people complained that it is so sticky after coming out of the bread machine. This is normal for machine made bread. Just add a little more flour and knead it in. I used 4 fresh minced garlic because we really like garlic. It is a regular in my files. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Very good! Added bacon bits to mine & mixed a bit of bacon drippings with the melted butter. So yummy! My dough also collapsed after getting it out of the bread machine & was also a bit sticky so I just dusted with little flour and it still turned out very well! It perfectly fit my 9x13 rectangular pan after the dough rose.

Just made this wonderful recipe for my family to go with Crock Pot Vegetable Beef soup(another All Recipes recipe) It was easy and so delicious. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and warmed the water, added the sugar and sprinkled the yeast on top and let it foam a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients. I added 1/4c flour while the ingredients were mixing in the bread machine. Also combined butter, herbs and cheese so I would only be dipping once. It was a bit messy but so worth it. This has been added to my recipe box and I plan to make it often. Thanks for sharing.

Added about 1/2 - 3/4 cup more flour because the recipe makes a soupy dough.  In the end...bland bland bland...even with the spices.

Delicious bread! The key to handling the super sticky dough is the BUTTER (not the flour). I kept putting flour on my hands and getting nowhere. Butter your fingers BEFORE you touch the dough. Grab a piece, put it in the butter BEFORE you try to roll it in a ball. Then you'll be good to go. My first batch was a bit of a mess because I only figured the butter thing out halfway through. But it still came out delicious. And I'll be making it again next weekend for friends coming over.

Also, if you're using a bread maker, this takes approximately 3 hours from start to finish - not 1 hr 15 mins.

One thing I really like about the dough recipe is that it is so versatile. You could roll this bread around in sweet stuff and it would be yummy too.

This bread is not only savory but the presentation is really good!  I don't have a bread machine so I did it the old fashioned way.  I forgot to let it rise the first time and went straight to rolling them.  After, I let it rise 30 minutes and cooked them as directed and they were amazing!  The dough pulled apart and was moist and velvety inside.  I did change the spices a bit.  I used tiny minced garlic and onion (fresh) instead of the powder and added oregano and rosemary because I love rosemary in bread.  Thanks for the recipes it turned out lovely.

This recipe is wonderful!  I did make a few changes on the seasonings.  Used Italian seasoning instead of the paprika, tarragon and sage because we were having an Italian meal, and I added a little sea salt and black pepper (McCormick grinders).  Used fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Probably came close to doubling the cheese and spices, and it was great!  Make sure to put something under the tube pan, if that's what you're using - the butter dripped out and made a little mess in the oven, but it was worth it!

Good.  Easy.  Mine didn't rise much.  I'm wondering if the yeast needed to react before I added it to the rest of the ingredients since I don't have a bread machine and did this with my Kitchenaid.  The seasonings seemed passive and melded together for a less than distinct taste.  I'd like to try my own seasonings next time and use yeast more traditionally.  The bread part of the recipe is tasty.  I'd also like to try these as individual breadsticks or sandwich hoagies.  The photo here is great.  The underside that's in the pan turns orange.  Not the best presentation.  I may also try a braid.  I don't like the presentation of the final product from a tube pan.

Following other reviews, I mix double the spices in with the melted butter and dip the dough in there (I use italian herbs + fresh minced garlic). The first time I made it the dough came out a slimey mess, I thought it was a disaster. Went ahead and followed the recipe, and lo and behold the slimey mess made the most delicious and fluffy bread! Since then I've made this about 10 or more times, because after having it once people keep asking me to bring it when we meet up again. Definitely my most requested potluck type item.

Had to double the spices since my pieces were smaller, which made it look less bubbly but still tastes the same im sure..I dont have a bread machine but was able to do it by hand. I'm not a really good cook but managed to make it using this recipe.

hey, I'ashamed: I had read this recipe and remembered vaguely something... then I was obliged to try it just relying on my memory, and no bread machine also! so, it was done by hand, the herbs and spices and cheese were scattered on the surface (oops: didn't remember the part of rolling the pieces in butter and so on). And I didn't wait for 30 min to let it raise: straight into the oven it went. What do you believe? it was a hit! impossible to let alone. I'll do it again, and "regularly" this time: can't wait!

This bread has the perfect name - it IS savory!  I combined the butter and spices and just rolled the dough in everything at once.  Then I sprinkled with cheese.  They rose beautifully, came apart easily once baked, and tasted delicious!

Made these last night (using bread machine).  Came out tender, very tasty-- wonderful buttery flavor.  Didn't have dried onion so used a small quantity of minced sweet onion.  Will definitely keep this one.

Very tasty! Perfect with a pasta dinner. I also was unsure about how it would turn out the dough seemed sticky but it turned out great. I didn't have some of the spices so I also used oregano, basil and pasley. It was delicious! Definitely will make again.

Mmmmmmmnnnn, this is so good!  I took it to a barbecue and it was gobbled up.  Everyone loved it.  I found the dough was super sticky so I had to add a lot more flour, and even then the balls all collapsed together into a soggy goo.  It rose up and baked beautifully though!

I can't say I liked it as is because you can't make it as is!  It took more than a full cup of flour more.   That said, I did like the idea of it.  But in this is not a usable recipe.  Thank goodness I read the reviews before or I'd have been pissed!

Turned out perfectly. I would suggest not putting a time limit on how long the bread needs to rise. Mine took 45 minutes before going into the oven.

What a pretty sight! I added 1/4C flour to the recipe and used 6tsp of mixed pasta herb (instead of total 3-1/2tsp in the recipe). I used a stand-mixer with hook to mix the dough and let it rise once in the same mixing bowl for 1hr. After proving I wrapped down the dough and resisted adding flour but oiled my hands before pinching little balls to coat with the melted herb-butter. My 22cm ring pan filled 8 balls x3 layers. After each layer of 8 balls, I sprinkled a layer of grated Parmesan cheese. It helped to brown the top nicely and added to the aroma of the loaf! I did not prove a second time because while shaping and coating the balls, the lower layers were proving and leavening already. Note: 1/4oz yeast is about 2-1/4tsp. It was so satisfying that I immediately whipped up another dough (additional 2Tbs sugar) to make the sweet version - Cinnamon Raisin. I stretched and fold each ball to embed 8 to 10 raisins each. Coat with cinnamon:sugar of 4:1 tsp ratio (or 3:1 tsp ratio if you like it sweeter). Stack as before.

Delicious and easy recipe to make.  I ran out of the spice/cheese mixture so I had to make an extra batch of that to coat the dough balls.  Otherwise it's a great recipe but double the spice mixture.  I used Italian seasoning instead of the sage/tarragon because it's what I had on hand.

The dough turned out perfect - so fluffy and light! The spices seemed a little too strong, so in the second batch I rolled them less in it and added garlic salt on top. Everybody enjoyed them!

I love this bread and it is really easy. The first time I followed your recipe exactly and it was good. But then I prepared it again and I doubled the garlic and minced onion, omitted the tarragon and added 2 tsps. Thyme, 1 tsp salt and 2 tsp. chopped fresh chives, I baked it like monkey bread in the bundt pan and 5 minutes before bread was done I topped with 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese. It is was great especially with Italian type meals, my family asks for this bread.

This recipe makes for a really delicious and flavorful bread.  The spice blend these are rolled in is also very good.   The last time after baking them, I also added on some fresh chopped herbs, and they tasted amazing!!  I am so glad I tried this recipe. 

These rolls are buttery and is one of my all time favorites.  I'm glad I tried it.

Really really good. Didn't use the sage or tarragon as it didn't go with the rest of the meal but would consider trying them next time. Would use extra garlic next time if not using the other spices.

OMG! We all loved this bread! I didn't have time to let it rise, but it still turned out great. My kids loved having their own little group of bread! Made for fun eating! I'll certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!

This was great! The recipe was simple, especially for a non-baker like me.  I followed the suggestion of some other reviewers, and mixed the spices into the melted butter.  I arranged the balls of dough in springform pan, and then sprinkled the cheese over the top of them.

I followed the recipe exactly and I just didn't care for it.  The spices are a bit weird.  If I were to make it again, I would use Italian seasonings instead.  I should have read the reviews first and mixed the spices with the butter because I ran out of the spices towards the end.  I'm glad I didn't add more, it would have been worse.  The dough was really gooey coming out of the bread machine, I had to add more flour.  The dough itself, however was really good - tender and light.  I think I'll use this dough recipe to make the sweet version of monkey bread in the future.

Delicious!  The bread itself was very sticky to work with and I had trouble getting it out of the bundt pan after it was cooked even after I sprayed the pan with Pam.  Other than that, the bundt pan worked great though because when the bread rose, it went up to the height of the pan.  Thanks.  Great recipe!

Well, I don't know what happened to Jennifer's bread, but that review nearly scared me out of making this recipe.  Mine was great in all ways.  I don't think it would fill up a Bundt pan though.  I used a 9" cake pan.

This bread was delicious and quite a change from plain old dinner rolls!  I will make this again but I will go with the suggestion of mixing the herbs in the melted butter for more even proportions.

Firstly thanks for the photos that showed me how this could be made in a 9" cake pan. Unlike some reviewers I did not find the dough too sticky, my egg was quite small so maybe that made the difference. I'd run out of sage and tarragon so I used a mixture of oregano, basil and marjoram. My family told me to make double next time. Many Thanks.

My family loved this!  I used the bread machine to save time on the dough.  One great thing about this recipe is that you can changed it up each time by using whatever spices you have in your kitchen and you wont get bored with the same thing every time.  Thanks!!!

What fun! This recipe was a great way to get the kids involoved.  I used the suggestion to mix the butter and spices for easy dipping, worked great. Bread came out tasty, the whole family loved it.  Thanks Ü
