I have made this wonderful recipe twice.  My family just loves it!  I used Jiffy cornbread mix, so it is sweet, but the sweetness is subdued by the other ingredients.  I highly recommend this recipe.

VEry good.  I added a little low sodium chicken broth, to make it moister, and I also dotted butter on the top, to make the top crisp.  

I made it for my father in law that has to watch his salt, and with the apple juice rather than chicken broth, it was a good recipe.  I will make it again.

While I liked the flavor of this dressing, mine came out too dry.  Perhaps it was because I halved it and maybe the proportions weren't right.  If I try it again, I would definatley add more juice or broth to the stuffing.

Yummy! This is great.  Only suggestion I would have would be to make it ahead of time.  It took a while to do all the chopping but well worth it.

I scaled this recipe down to make 4 servings for a family dinner. Served it with a marinated pork tenderloin and this was an AWESOME dinner (if I do say so myself!) We all loved this dressing! I froze the extra cornbread to serve with another dinner later.

This has become THE dressing.  I make this every year for the office Thankgiving Pot Luck and always get requests for the recipe!  Usually make  half with nuts and then half without.

This is a very good dressing recipe. I have been looking for one that added all the flavors i love together and this one does. I added some sausage, fresh sage, and dried cranberries for another flavor dimention.

I like the flavors in this a lot, but I didn't like the consistency as much.  It was a little too dry and crumbly for my taste.  It won't make my Thanksgiving table, but I might make it as a side dish during the year.

I made this recipe for our Christmas party last year and everyone really enjoyed it! I had never thought about adding apples to the recipe but it was just right! I will be making this again for Thanksgiving this year! Thanks for sharing!

This was the first time I made dressing for Thanksgiving and it turned out excellent.  My boyfriend has never liked stuffing and he loved this one.  By the time it was time for dinner there was a section missing from the pan b/c he couldn't stay out of it.

I just made this for Christmas dinner and it was great.  I made it the day before and it heated up well and was delicious.  I will definitely make it again.
