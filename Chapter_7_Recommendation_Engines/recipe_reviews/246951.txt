Excellent! If I could give this 10 stars, I would. I used 1 1/2cups chopped hatch chiles, other than that, I followed the recipe. Hubby absolutely loved them and he's very picky. Will be making this over and over. Thanks for the recipe!

Living in New Mexico and close to Hatch where in my opinion the best chili in the world is grown I cook a lot using red and green chili.  I am always looking for new multi-purpose chili sauces so I thought I would give this a try. Being I already had roasted and peeled green chili in the freezer I skipped the first 4 steps of this recipe other than seeding and chopping. I cooked the recipe as written. It was easy to put together and had a lot of flavor. I definitely will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Before I made this I checked the recipe authors personal recipe and it calls for 2 cups of Hatch Chilies, roasted, peeled and chopped not 6 oz of chilies.  I went with the 2 cups as the author suggested.  I know that Hatch Chilies can be really hot but this batch was really HOT.  Good but HOT.

Excellent recipe! I used my own previously roasted and frozen green chiles. ( I live in NM and the roasters are busy in the early fall) I doubled the recipe. I  used 4 cups of chopped green chile. Added a teas of cumin and  1/4 teas oregano. I also added a teaspoon of better than bullion chicken. I used chicken broth instead of beef. The sauce was a little thick so I threw in a can of rotel tomatoes. I had extra sauce and put in containers for the freezer. Will definitely make again!

Being from New Mexico, its always a plus finding new ways to use green chile. I normally make my sauce with cream of chicken soup, but was attending a party where there was someone lactose intolerant attending so gave this a whirl. 

I skipped the 1st steps as I already had green chile roasted and ready to go. I did as the recipe called for, however once I caramelized the onion, added garlic and chile, I put it in a crock pot on low with the beef broth (only 1 can of beef broth)  for  the remainder of the day until the party that evening. 

Turned out great and was definitely a hit. In fact the guests fought over split and took home the left overs. :)

I used Hatch green chilies that we had previously roasted and frozen. It turned out very good! We will keep using this recipe. Also, as with many recipes, it's even better reheated the next day!

I have been craving green chili sauce since I had it in New Mexico a few years ago. I've tried to make it other times but it was never quite right. My grocery store in Alaska finally had some Hatch chilis for sale and I made this for dinner with chicken enchiladas. I followed the recipe but blended a little of it with my immersion blender for a better consistency.  It was as close to the real deal as I am going to get without traveling to New Mexico. I can't wait to eat the leftover sauce with scrambled eggs tomorrow!

found this to be too runny for a sauce. Didn't like the consistency and I used chicken broth in the recipe for chicken enchiladas

I've made alot of chicken enchiladas in my life with a green sauce and for these? My husband says these were the best ever, and I'm a chef! I opted to use chicken stock. It seemed a better fit.

This sauce came out amazing ! I served it a couple different ways . Dinner: Over chicken enchiladas  and the next day for brunch I added just a tsp of sour cream to it and served it over scrabbled eggs and toasted tortillas. This sauce has just the right amount of heat.... I will definitely be making this again

Made a double recipe because I had a lot of hatch chili’s to use. I made a few *very* minor changes due to what I had available: I roasted the Chili’s on grill rather than in the oven (which added a lovely smoked taste to finoshed sauce!), and used olive oil because I had no corn oil (will definitely use corn oil next time), and used chicken stock (because I want to use the sauce more with chicken and fish). Awesome, flavorful sauce!

I made this sauce to be used with chicken enchiladas.  I found the beef broth flavor a bit overpowering.  Next time I try this I would use seechicken broth would have worked better, at least for chicken enchiladas verde.

Perfect base recipe for green chile sauce! We used HOT Hatch green chiles, so we had to add a couple of tablespoons of sour cream to cut the heat.

This turned out great!  The consistency and flavor are excellent.  Served this with slow roasted pork shoulder.  Definitely a keeper.
