I've never had a Chinese peanut cookie before, so I'm not sure how they're suppose to taste. However, I made this recipe and did not like the cookies at all. They were way too sugary! The dough was very crumbly and I had a hard time keep the cookies from falling apart. They didn't turn golden even after being in the oven for 10 minutes. I would not make these again.

I think the recipe is too sweet.  I slightly modified the recipe to one cup ground peanut and one cup flour and 3/4 cup sugar.  I do like the soft melt in the mouth texture thanks to the corn flour.  I also opt to brush it with egg yolk for better browning and bake it small like the store bought ones (about 3/4inch in diameter) and slightly flatten.  Oh, I also add 1/2 tsp of salt.  Omit corn flour is you prefer slightly firmer cookies.

I normally make these as written with the exception of some almond oil if the dough doesn't come together depending on the weather and like it, but today tried it with cashews and they are boring. just wanted to give a heads up to anyone else who likes to tinker. :)
