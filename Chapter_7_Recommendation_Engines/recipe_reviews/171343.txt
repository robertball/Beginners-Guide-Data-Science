This soup was very good, and very spicy. I was looking for something to make with my cucumbers (other than pickles), and found this recipe. Unlike most of the other cucumber soups, this is hot and doesn't require sour cream. I recommend this recipe. Be careful when blending it, though, so it doesn't explode out of your blender and all over, making a mess or burning you.

This soup was a hit!  My kitchen smells delicious and I can't wait to try it again.  What I did differently: - omitted the crushed red pepper flakes - used chicken broth instead of vegetable - used 4 smallish cucumbers - added 3 small potatoes  What I plan to do differently next time: - half the cayenne pepper (at least) - puree half of the soup to a chunky consistency, and puree the other half to a creamier consistency  I didn't believe the reviewers who said it was too spicy.  We love spicy food so the only thing I omitted was the crushed red pepper, because we didn't have any on hand.  It wasn't spicy enough to stop me from eating two bowls of it -- but I do think that next time I will at least halve the cayenne pepper.  If it's still too spicy after that, I may cut back on the curry.  I think the curry is part of what makes this so tasty though, so that's the last thing I'll consider cutting back.  My husband didn't like the creamy consistency, so I'm going to try leaving half of the soup a little chunkier for him next time.  My husband is not a soup lover, and we were both a little wary of cucumber soup -- but he really seemed to enjoy this soup so it's definitely going to be a keeper for our family!

Great ideas to spice up cucumber soup.  I skipped the red pepper flakes and used fresh tomatillos and two fresh serrano chili peppers instead for the heat.  I also included 3 very small russet potatoes and had chix broth, not veggie broth.  Very tasty.

An excellent soup, totally defying the cliche "cool as a cucumber".  This is one of the few recipes on here that I've ever cooked as is without any changes.

Who ever thought a cucumber dish could have you running for a glass of milk!  VERY spicy, could easily halve the spices and still get a good kick from this.  My father and I mixed this soup into some leftover white rice and this created an excellent dish.

This had a very good flavour, but it is very spicy. If you do not like spice, then you should cut the spices in half or  more! Then you will be able to enjoy the soup.

I love spicy food, but cut the curry and cayenne in half and skipped the red pepper entirely based on other reviews and it was still way too hot!

Holy smokes is this spicy!  I halved the cayenne and pepper flakes, and it was still super HOT!  Will make again, but with 1/4 of the heat.

This soup,hmmm,I don't know what to say,it's eatable. I left out the curry (didn't have any) and thank goodness! I thought I would go insane with heat in my mouth! it's way to hot to really taste the cucumbers. My mother did NOT like it at all,she just poured hers out and I will not serve this to my son. Cucumber soup is meant to be a cool soup not this spicy hot.

I like the flavor of this recipe. I followed the portions except for halving the cayenne. I don't consider myself a wimp, I enjoy spicy food. This recipe is still just too spicy for me. I can't imagine trying to eat this as written.

This soup was awesome!  Wasn't sure if I would like it given some of the mixed reviews.  I didn't have any cayenne so I sub'ed a jalepeno.  It was def. spicy, but not over the top.  I also doubled the recipe and was glad i did.  Just as easy to make twice as much, and even then it wasn't a big batch.  It all fit in the blender in one batch (I held the top tight to make sure it didn't splash.)

I'm trying to cut back on dairy, next time I will sub soy milk and I think it would still be great.

This one is a keeper for sure.

This is a great recipe, but it was way too spicy to enjoy it. I will definitely cut out the red pepper flakes and reduce the amount of cayenne. I also used chicken broth instead of vegie broth. Next time, I'll make a double batch, add more milk and cut back on the spices. What a great way to use up all those cucumbers from the garden!

Great flavor--but VERY spicy.  I sprinkled the top with chopped green onions, and added a dollop of low-fat sour cream to try to temper the heat.  Next time, I will cut the cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon, and the curry powder to 1 teaspoon...just to suit my own taste. A yummy and different type of soup.

I thought the soup was really good and an interesting/different way to enjoy cucumbers, but...I'd cut the spices down a lot next time. I like spice a lot, but it was too much. I also added a splash of cilanto/grapeseed oil puree on top as a special touch.

I didn't change the ingredient quantities except I doubled up on the cucumbers and it was still way too hot.  If I make again I would cut out the cayenne and red pepper flakes and add cayenne to taste at the end.  The curry powder may need adjusting too but the soup was so spicy it was hard to tell what the problem was.  I've frozen the leftovers with a note to add milk or cream, so I haven't totally given up on it.  The rating reflects the fact that IF I hadn't doubled up on the cucumbers, it wouldn't have been edible in our house, and I stress, we do like spicy food.

Lives up to it's name (SPIIICY!)  I'll def. wanna make this more often, but twice the quantity.  I added a dallop of sour cream to my bowl to calm my taste buds, and also garnished with parsley flakes.  I subbed soy milk, and it was fine.  This will clear your sinuses! LOVE IT!

This is very good.  I love spicy food but I have to admit that this is just a tad bit spicy for me.  I will make again but I will go easy on the spice.  I didn't have any sesame oil but it still tasted good.

Wow!!! This is good.  I did not have the curry powder so I used corriandar.  I did not use the cayenne. It would have been too spicy for my family.  But WOW.  I went to the garden and had 3 more cukes.  I know I am doing with them.

This is excellent, even though I had to sub paprika for cayenne and left out the sesame oil.  I also halved the amount of curry powder.  Perfect.

I made this without the milk and oil (dietary need) and it was DELICIOUS!  I did add fresh dill and green onion before blending it with my immersion blender, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I love the idea of doing something different with cucumbers! I like spicy/hot food but this soup was really too hot for us even though I cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/4 teaspoon.  Next time I will cut the red pepper flakes by at least half and add only 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne, at least to start.  You can always add more! I added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice at the end to try and brighten up the flavour and cut the heat a bit.

Love this recipe, love the heat.  I did cut the pepper  in half as suggested by others and it was perfect. Could easily cut it in half again and still have a good spicy flavor.

Really tasty but really spicy .  I read other reviews saying it was too spicy but chose to ignore it to my peril as I like spicy food, way too hot for me.  My husband likes it but he is the kind of person who will eat a whole raw habanero chilli, f you are not that kind of person, half the chilli in the recipe.

I've made this twice now and really like it, but I've altered the recipe for my own personal taste choice. I didn't have vegetable broth so I substitute chicken bouillon cubes (5) and mixed them with two cups of hot water. I also added a little more milk and sour cream to calm down the heat factor because IT IS HOT. I also sprinkled in some instant mashed potato flakes to thicken up the consistency.

This was way too spicy for our family - even though I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp. We are going to try to add some diced zucchini, rice, and milk to cool it off a bit. Still a good flavor.

Good soup - would make again.   Threw in a couple of small potatoes and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Finished with dollop of sour cream

Love this soup hot and spicy!  I did not put any red pepper flakes in it but added more curry. And a little more milk for more creaminess. My husband and I loved it!!!

Love this soup. This is a great soup to make for vegetarian guests. I followed other reviewers and halved the spices and for my own taste added two dollops of sour cream. To make this soup transform from a side dish to a meal, I added boiled russet potatoes cut into small chucks. So delicious and so healthy! I will definitely make this again.

Different use for extra cucumbers!  It freezes well, and if you use pint containers, you can later mix with four cups of cooked brown rice and serve it as a rice dish. Police what is in your ingredients (especially the soy sauce) and this is very easily a GF dish.

It was WAY too spicy, I adore spicy things but this had no taste other than the spices  I couldn't taste any of the cucumber, which was unfortunate.

It definitely was SPICY!  I decreased the curry and after the soup was emulsified I added sour cream until blended.  Rice was an awesome idea, but without that, it's a nice gluten-free, vegetarian (not vegan) offering.

I had an abundant cucumber crop so I made lots of recipes with cucumbers. I couldn't eat this. If you think hot cucumbers sounds gross, you won't be swayed in your thinking after making this. If you already like hot cucumbers, you'd most likely be a fan.  It went in the trash so I have to give it 1 star.

I cut the spices down to about 3/4 of amounts stated omitting the cayenne all together - I think it depends on the quality of the curry powder used.  I didn't puree in food processor - just used the "boat motor" so there was still some texture.  Other than that, this was a winner.  Great way to get rid of all those summer garden cukes!  I will be making this delicious soup again.

Amazing! After two years of lurking I finally joined the site, just to say how great this soup is.
The texture is velvety, and the spiceyness was just right for me and my husband. Didn't have any parsley, and used chicken stock not veg stock, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.
Can't wait to make it again!

I doubled the recipe without doubling the spices and it will still pretty HOT!  I had to add extra broth and milk, so decided to add some whole wheat angel hair pasta (broken up), and it turned out pretty good.  Not sure I would make it again, but it was interesting, for sure.
