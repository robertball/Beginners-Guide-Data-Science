I put my waffle iron away two years ago and never used it again. Recently my teenager asked me to make waffles since I could not stand those boxed waffle mixes, I turned to this site.  I woke up this morning, put the mix together, and got back in bed with the Sunday paper while the mix rose.  These are the best waffles ever. Even my ten year old who hates breakfast foods of any kind loved these.  My neice who says she doesn't like waffles had two plates.  My teen hasn't gotten up as of yet, but when he does he will have a hot, wonderful, met-in-your-mouth waffle.  The waffle iron is now out of retirement.

Excellent waffles!  I got a new Belgian waffle maker at the Black Friday sale yesterday and decided to use this recipe in it first.  I was a little concerned about them being too eggy, so I only used three eggs.  We really liked the light, airy texture, yet crispy outsides.  We ate them with butter and syrup or apple butter, but I can't wait to try them with strawberries and whipped cream!  My waffle maker must be a little smaller than the recipe author's, because I got 6-1/2 waffles out of this recipe.  The leftovers went into the freezer for a quick breakfast another day!

This recipe was a little time consuming for the end result. They tasted great, but not a whole lot different from, say, Bisquick. My husband couldn't even tell the difference. But, they were still really good. I just don't know if they're different enough to make the prep time worth it. Also, if you're looking for a crisp waffle, this isn't the recipe, But I like mine soft. I made it the night before and let it rise in the fridge-still turned out fine. It did make more waffles than the recipe indicated, which wasn't a problem! I made the rest up and froze them. I tried one today after popping it in the toaster and it still tasted great! I would probably make this again, but only if I have time to kill.

This is the best yeast waffles I've been able to find so far. They do have to cook for a little while longer than usual to get the outside really crispy like we want. I'll keep looking for the "perfect" belgian waffle, but will definately keep this one.

I have tried other waffle recipes from this site and this by far is the best. Nice crunchy outside, soft in the middle. The first time I tried this I followed the recipe...excellent. The 2nd time I tried it I didn't have the time or all of the ingredients...turned out great also..here is what I did the 2nd time.
I didn't have time to whip the whites, so I just added them whole. I also ran out of vanilla, so I used immitation rum extract. It gave the waffles an awesome flavor. Also for the milk, I always use non-fat milk, so I added the sugar to the warm milk then sprinkled the yeast. It frothed up better that way. Kids thought these were the cream of the crop. Oh..I also had my waffle iron on 6 (hottest setting). Happy waffle making!

These waffles are delicious. I made them for my husband just this weekend and I don't think we will ever go back to making waffles with a pancake mix again!  Since I like my batter a little sweeter I added 1 tbsp of brown sugar and little extra vanilla. Great recipe!!

This recipe was okay, but not any better than the "Everyday Waffles" from Better Homes & Gardens and much more time consuming. I used unsalted butter and would use salted if I made it again. Mine did not brown evenly, and as another reviewer said, were soft.

This was my first attempt at waffles from scratch. They were by far the best we have had. Next time I would add a bit more sugar for my tastes, but otherwise they were wonderful: very light and fluffy!

I have made these for years and years.  I found the recipe in Fannie Farmer's cookbook.  I do have one modification, which you will really approve:

You DO NOT have to let the batter raise, not even a little bit.  

So whip it up, pour some onto your sizzling waffle iron... and ENJOY!!

The first time I prepared these waffles, I did not let the batter rest 45 minutes and they were still wonderful!  The second time, I waited too long and they were still wonderful.  I also sustituted whole wheat pastry flour each time.  Great recipe.

I am a nanny and made this for the boys that I watch.  They couldn't get enough.  It took a while to get the dough ready, but was worth it in the end.  The waffles were VERY light and tasty.  It is definately something that I will make again.

My first time making real Belgian waffles. I use a KitchenAid PRO Line waffle maker and was able to get 6 waffles from this recipe.  Love the yeast dough and even better...we can make the batter the night before! This is our new go to recipe. A note to those that suggest that there is no need to separate the eggs and beat the egg whites separately and then fold into the batter...as an experienced baker, beating the egg whites and then folding them into the batter (yeast present or not) this batter does benefit from this step. I would proceed as the recipe suggests. Hubby's says these are most excellent. Christmas morning will be much more relaxed and enjoyable for me because of the prep the night before!

I used a vintage waffle maker, the very flat square kind with 4 sections.  I wasn't sure it would turn out, since it's not a Belgian waffle.  They came out AMAZING.  The batter looked sketchy, very light and custardy, and that's just how they turned out.  Very delicate, great flavor, something like a funnel cake, but better.

Made these for a small Christmas brunch. I'd never tried yeast waffles but found this recipe delicious and very forgiving.  Good thing.  My yeast was old and I didn't separate the eggs (beat them till foamy), but the results were excellent.  My grown daughter said they were the best she'd ever had. I cooked them in a Kitchenaid waffle maker for 4 minutes and that seemed right.  The batter is more like dough, so be sure to have something to scoop it out as it won't pour very easily.

Prep time is a little long for breakfast but it's well worth it.  This is definitly the best belgium waffle recipe I've come across.  Light and fluffy, and very tasty!
