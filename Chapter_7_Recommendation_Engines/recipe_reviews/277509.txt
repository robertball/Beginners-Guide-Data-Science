I have made this 4 times now and the braiding does get easier every time.  I use a grated hard sheep cheese ( due to dietary issues with cow dairy) and olive tapenade instead of the peppers.  Everyone who has tried this bread loves it.  I did set my oven at 425 degrees.  The bread seemed a little too browned baked at 450 in my oven.

this turned out absolutely delicious, but unless you are very confident working with dough, i'd suggest stopping at the point where you roll it up, slicing vents in it, and baking it that way.

i am not that experienced with pizza dough, so the braiding stage was extremely messy and awkward, and the exposed cheese/meat caused the bottom of the loaf to brown too fast. it was still extremely delicious, just kind of stressful to make.

What I thought was going to be a ‘twisted nightmare’ turned out to be a delicious dinner/snack.

Used pizza sauce instead of pesto.  Delish! Will try again with artichokes, Oil and garlic, roasted red peppers, and spinach... vegan style! Use the sauce only for dipping.
