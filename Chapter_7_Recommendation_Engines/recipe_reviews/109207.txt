Way too much Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke. I've only made this once but I knew just from reading it that 3 tbsp of liquid smoke was too much so I put in 1 1/2 tbsp of liquid smoke. I wish I would have known enough to half the Worcestershire sauce too. I will try that next time. all-in-all a good base to work with.

I had the smoker going all of Memorial Weekend and decided to empty my freezer of venison. I did use the smoker instead of a dehydrater and because I was using the smoker I left out the liquid smoke. Out of the 3 recipes I tried on this site, this one was probably my favorite. The beer really tenderized the venison. I will most definitely make again.

I have been using this recipe for years. Anyone who really cooks knows that personal preference will guide you to make changes/substitutes to recipes according to your and your family's tastes. My family loves smoky flavor and worcestershire so I use the full amount. I do usually buy low sodium soy sauce and teriyaki and I don't notice a difference. 
I don't know how many times I have had to substitute on the fly because I forgot to check the pantry for the ingredients first. 
I always use twice the meat called for this recipe. I have probably run out of nearly every ingredient on this list at least once; there is always a way to handle it. Today I doubled the recipe, but didn't have quite enough worcestshire or soy sauce. I used a little Mirin and added more teriyaki. Sometimes, instead of regular salt, I use seasoned salt. I have used onion powder and garlic salt. Whatever floats your boat. Cooking is a science experiment and trial and error is the path to perfection.

I agree the liquid smoke is a little strong. 
this is an ingredient that is very potent. As is soy sauce, very salty. Go minimal and it goes far.

It was perfect exactly by the recipe.  My husband loved it.  Flavorful, had a little zing and wasn't too salty.  Will absolutely make it again.
