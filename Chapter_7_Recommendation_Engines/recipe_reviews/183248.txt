I agree with other reviewer-the cookies didn't rise, spread out in the pan, and were very greasy.  I baked one pan of 12 cookies and tossed the baked cookies and the rest of the cookie dough, as I knew there was nothing I could add or do to improve them.  Don't waste your time and ingredients on this one.

Cookies spread out too much and baked into one another.  They were greasy.  Note:  I followed the recipe to the letter, even ran to the store to buy butter flavored crisco and bread flour.

Kids liked them but overall were flat and kind of tasteless to me.
