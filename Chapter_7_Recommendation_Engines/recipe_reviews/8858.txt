This is one of our family's new favorite meals.  I use  a can of the cream of chicken & mushroom soup.  I also spray a frying pan w/ Pam, season the chicken and quickly cook the chicken about 2-3 minutes on each side to help cut down on the oven time. (only needs about 30 minutes in the oven)  Oh my!  It tastes great.  Thanks for this recipe.  Even though I didn't follow exactly as you said, it's a nice place to start.

I give it 5 stars because my 4 picky children all LOVE it. It is very easy and the chicken is very tender. I start by stabbing the chicken breasts with a fork over and over to allow the soup mixture to soak in and I also season with salt, pepper and Lowrys Chicken Seasoning. Im acually cooking it right now! Ill take a picture and post it when its done

Very tasty, VERY quick & easy, which is the best part. Used 1 can each of cream of chicken & cream of celery, used water instead of milk.  Seasoned chicken with seasoned salt & garlic powder. Put rice in bottom, mixed with part of soup mixture, then layer of fresh mushrooms, then chicken and rest of soup on top.  Covered & baked.  Family loved it.  Left me time to work on the next night's dinner!

Made this recipe, only I used 2 cans of cream of chicken w/2 cans milk.I put in some mixed veggies, and I poured stove top stuffing over the top and poured some more soup over the stuffing, its a good idea to use low fat milk, milk does make a thicker soup. if you dont like stuffing than a can of biscuts over the top and you have a pot pie.

OMG! I tried this recipe last night with chicken breast and it was soooo good.  I took on of the users suggestions and browned it so the cook time was not as long,I had something else cooking in the oven with it so I cooked it on 400 about 40 minutes. I also used a can of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup as a user suggested. It looked beautiful and tasted yummy.  I put my own seasoning on it tweeked it a little to my liking, it turned out wonderful, I highly recommend this recipe, you cant go wrong.  I'm having leftovers tonight and can't wait to get home =))

Very moist and tasty.  I used cream of celery soup and cream of mushroom.  I seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt then poultry seasoning.  I used all milk and no water with the soup and topped the casserole with French's Toasted Onion toppers.  Though I used two cans of soup, their wasn't enough sauce so next time, I would add water to the milk.

Seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, seasoning salt and garlic powder. Added broccoli and covered with tinfoil. It was delicious!!! Update: I made this again using 4 small boneless breasts, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of broccoli, 1 can of milk and a couple handfuls of broccoli. I seasoned the sauce with onion powder and the chicken with garlic powder, poultry seasoning and seasoning salt. Covered with tinfoil and baked for 1 hour then served over egg noodles. Yum!

This recipe was great! While it was in the oven, a few minutes before it finished, I added a couple of slices of pepperjack cheese on top of the chicken to add some spice.

Well, this is warm and curbs the hunger, but I really can't say much more about this dish then that. It's bland, and not exciting at all. Sorry :(

This is such a great comfort food. For a creamier, yet more tangy, flavor, substitute the milk with sour cream!

I actually just joined this website to review this recipe.  I changed the recipe a bit, I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom, 1-1/4 cup milk, half a bag of frozen broccoli and salt and pepper in the sauce.  I seasoned the chicken with italian seasoning and adobe, poured the mixture, and let it cook for 50-55 min at 375F.  Served with pasta.  It was absolutely delicious.  The mix of flavors was perfect.  I will be making this again very soon!

to Sarah F- I make something similar to that as well, except, I think you might enjoy it more if you layer that differently. Put a small layer of soup on the bottom of your dish, then the chicken breasts, the rest of the soup mix of that then a layer of shredded cheese (i normally use the mexican mix) and then the stove top stuffing. That way, your stuffing gets a nice crunch and underneath, your chicken cooks great. i ususally do 400 degrees for about an hour or so. Have to be careful because there really isn't a good way to check the doneness with so much overing it. I hope this makes your dinner spectacular! Or anyone else that wants this! lol =]

It doesn't get much simpler than this - and good over noodles, rice, whatever you have.  I found that I flipped the chicken halfway through and it only needed 60 mins to be tender and thoroughly cooked.  Thanks for a simple idea!

This recipe came out great (photo added)! I did follow some tips I read from reviews and added 1 can of Cream of Mushroom, stabbed the chicken with a fork several times on both sides, used 1/2 a bag of American Beauty Extra Wide Egg Noodles (which I undercooked prior to adding to the pan...about 5 mins), and added half a bag of frozen broccoli. However, in the middle of baking, I noticed the noodles seemed to be drying so I added about 1/2 a cup of water which really made them nice and fluffy. Next time, I'll definitely add more milk. Can't wait to make this again! :-)

this is a fantastic quick & easy meal for my household. I add veggies [broccoli, cauliflower, carrots] to the cream sauce, and well as whole & minced garlic. about 5 minutes before it's done cooking, I take it out & add parmesan sprinkles to the top to create a tasty crust!

Good recipe! I browned the chicken 3 minutes on each side as mentioned by a reviewer.  Make sure to season to your taste.  It will come out bland if you do not. I served with rice and stir fry vegetables.  My picture is the fourth. Enjoy!

I tried this tonight as we eat a lot of chicken breast and just try to have different ways to prepare it. To keep this dish from being bland I seasoned my chicken breast with Tony Cachere Creole Seasoning and I also substituted chicken broth for the canned milk and my chicken came out juicy and delicious. I served it with rice. This will most def be added in my regular rotation now. Thanks!!!

This was very very good. I was feeding a crowd so I made 6 chickens and put two cans of cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken and one can of milk. It turned into this amazing gravy that went great with Rice A Roni Make sure that You season the chicken very well. I used extra poultry and paprika, salt and pepper. This dish can end up a little bland if you dont season well. Everyone ate the whole pan!!! So good. And make sure you try it with chicken flavored rice!!

Rule of thumb...always have Cream of Chicken soup and Cream of mushroom soup around. This dish was great because I mixed 1 Can Cream of Mushroom, 1 Can Cream of Chicken, 1 Can Milk, 1 Can water and THEN I added RICE, FROZEN CORN, GREEN ONIONS, and a touch of GARLIC. Watch the rice to make sure there is enough water so it doesn't come out hard. I also covered it in tinfoil. Next time I would cut chicken into pieces and cook more like a casserole. It was heavenly. A full meal.

The recipe is a great base to work from. I made a few changes including cooking the chicken in a skillet first before sticking it in the oven. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and fresh garlic. I used one can of condensed cream of chicken, 1/2 can of milk, and 1/2 can of chardonnay to add flavor. Chicken was moist and the sauce tasted great! I would definitely season the chicken more next time. Served the chicken with brown rice and asparagus. My girlfriend and I loved it!

So so easy. I was only cooking for one, so I only used one can of cream of chicken - did not add the milk. The juices from the chicken thinned it out and made it into a really tasty gravy; I seasoned the chicken to taste and then served with instant rice and veggies. This recipe is basic and requires you seasoning otherwise it could easily be bland.

This is a good base.  Usually don't like to write changes but here goes.  I pounded chicken breast with italian dressing mix and then sauteed some onions in fry pan and then browned chicken breast.  Took out chicken breast after browned and deglazed pan with white white.  Mixed a can of cream of chicken with herbs, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup half and half and a little garlic powder and then added to pan, put chicken back in and simmered on low.  Came out really good.  A little more work but came out really tasty.  Only used 2 chicken breast because only two of us.  If using four would double recipe for sauce.

I changed this up. I put a packet of dry italian mix and garlic powder in a plastic bag, dropped the chicken in and shook it around until well coated. Then transfered the chicken to a hot pan of olive oil, browned the chicken and then placed it in the dish. I choose two cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of milk. Along with that I added 1 tbsp of Mrs. Dash (Table) Seasoning to add more flavor. Poured it over the chicken and cooked for 1 hour. While my bowtie pasta was cooking I cut up the four chicken breasts. Drained the pasta, returned it to the pot, added the sauce, some cheddar cheese and the cut up chicken. I let it blend together on low heat while my veggies were cooking. It turned out really good and my family loved it. There were no leftovers!

I love this dish. It has been a standar in my family for a long time. We serve it over rice and add a little soy sauce to the sauce to change it up a bit. Cream of mushroom works great as well.

This was yummy and super easy! The chicken was so tender.  I used a smaller baking dish so the chicken was completly submerged in the soup mix. Family loved it!

This was good. I topped the chicken with some chopped onions and green peppers.  This gave it a nice color and taste.  I also served it with wild rice.

This recipe is wonderful.  I added a few things... First, I didn't have cream of chicken so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom diluted with 1-1/2 cans of milk.  I also added more mushrooms, 2 cubes of chicken broth, some onion powder, garlic powder, 2 - 3 shakes of poultry seasoning, and ground pepper to the soup mixture.  I browned the breasts in a 12" skillet, poured the soup mixture over it, and cooked on the stove, covered at a low-medium setting for about 30 minutes.  I served it over mashed potatoes and made a side dish of lemon asparagus, also on this site. This sounds like a lot of changes but it really isn't.  We had a fabulous dinner.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

This recipe is so simple but it really works. Like most other folks I too tweaked it a bit. First off I used chicken breast tenderloins. Second I seared the chicken in my cast iron pan with just salt and pepper. Third I loosely covered the pan after adding soup mix. Into the oven and thirty minutes later, oh my what a terrific dinner.  We ran out of gravy so next time will double soup mix.

Want a recipe that's easy to make and chicken that is tender enough to cut with a fork?  Then this is the recipe for you!  I followed directions to the T and made a side of whole grain rice to go with.  I think next time I may try to add a few capers for zip.

I first seasoned the chicken with garlic and onion powder, season salt and paprika along with the pepper.  I used a sharp cheddar cheese instead of swiss and I have to say that this recipe is a keeper.  Oh I used cream of onion soup since I did not have any cream of chicken soup, that was a great substitute. It was fantastic!
It was moist and delicious.  The best part (lol) is the breading and sauce that was cooked onto the bottom of the pan.  Yumm... usually that is the best part.

This recipe is simply delicious.  I made a couple of changes, though.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, then squeezed lemon into the mix.  I love the flavor of the added lemon.  I didn't use chicken breasts, I used chicken thighs and drumsticks, which we prefer.

Recipe was a little bland, but quick and easy.  The sauce didn't thicken up as much as I thought it would.  Next time, I would add some flour and more seasoning.  I'll also put the casserole dish on a pan, because it boiled over in the oven.  :/

A very simple recipe, but I added a few extra ingredients. For example, I used a can of Cream of Chicken AND a can of Cream of Mushroom, seasoned chicken with chicken bullion and onion powder, added a little 1% milk, and then topped with about 1 cup of cheddar cheese. Turned out juicy and delicious!

I made this recipe using the exact measurements and ingredients. My family found it to be very bland and tasteless. It is easy to make and should I try it again I will add the two cans of soup, more seasonings and perhaps sliced carrotts and or celery to give the meal some color. I will still serve over noodles.

I made  it and love it!  Like a few others I pre-cooked chicken in a pan (cooked in olive oil and crushed garlic) for 2 minutes per side before putting in the oven. Also, to avoid blandness, the trick is in pre-seasoning before cooking.  I  added seasoning to the chicken while pre cooking (I added  fresh squeezed lemon juice, poultry seasoning, garlic powder,  oregano, and rosemary). I also added a pinch  of seasoning to the cream of chicken and mushroom soup (which I mixed in 1/2 can  water, 1/2 can chicken broth) an sprinkled parmesan cheese over it after  pouring the soup mixture over the chicken. It came out tasty and juicy, served it over rice.

I used the theory of browning meat when cooking so I browned the chicken in some butter and olive oil, half a white onion chopped up and coked till semi translucent and some fresh parsley. I added the spices there then transferred the chicken into the bake dish and added 1/4 cup buttermilk; and some more salt and pepper. I also took the trimmings from the browning of the chicken and mixed it in the soup / milk mix.

Spices I used where salt; pepper; cyan pepper; basil; and herb salt-less spices.

Oh and instead of canned milk I used the 1/4 cup buttermilk and 1 cup heavy cream. I think it helped spice up an otherwise simple hunger curbing meal. 

Oh and I added one can of whole mushrooms cause I love mushrooms :)

And lastly, I was unsure if I was supposed to cook it covered in the oven or open, so I did half and half. If the original recipe maker reads this, which is correct? Covered or not covered when cooking in the oven?

This recipe is great. Although I did make a couple of changes. I used chicken thighs bone in and I seasoned with some rosemary salt and garlic power and a bit of pepper. I also used 4 strips of bacon. I crisped that up first and then I browned the chicken on both sides.  I added about 1/4 cups of almond to let it toast in the fat just for extra flavour before adding the cream mixture. Finally in the oven at 350 for about 30-40 mins. Very easy recipe I love it

Meals start with recipes like these, after the basics use your imagination.  I added various seasonings, a box of Au Gratin potatoes, and a bag of mixed vegetables to make it into a casserole.  I mixed everything together in the casserole dish, stirred it up good, and then added the chicken below the sauce mixture making sure the top of the chicken was covered with a enough mixture to absorb while cooking.  Covered and cooked for 1.5 hours, delicious.

Like the earlier posts, this recipe is a good  beginning for spectacular finishes. I seasoned and browned the breasts in a non-stick pan. I used Chicken & Herbs soup from Campbells. I also added shitake mushrooms that I had sautéed  in white wine and 1 tsp of unsalted butter. The final dish was so awesome that I served this to my boss and his wife. They are begging me for the recipe :)

Good recipe. I had to use one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken. I put some spices to our liking and browned the chicken in a little  olive oil first which cut down on oven time. Served with mashed potatoes, green beans, and biscuits. Would be really good over rice or noodles.   We enjoyed it!

This chicken was so great!! I did what some of the other reviewers did. I added the cream of chicken soup and the cream of mushroom soup but instead of adding milk...I added heavy whipping cream (just because I had some) sprinkled a little garlic and onion powder on top and added cut asparagus to the soup. Covered and cooked for 1 1/2 hours. My husband loved it (very picky eater). I will make this again!

Great starter recipe! I use 2 cans cream of chicken, chicken broth, seasonings and a container of sliced mushrooms. So tender and delicious! I usually serve it with rice or mashed potatoes. Very simple, yet super satisfying.

I had no idea what to do with my thawed out chicken until I found this recipe.  I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used garlic salt, rosemary, and thyme, and it worked out great.  Made it as written and served over egg noodles.  My only suggestion would be to maybe double the sauce if you want enough to spoon over noodles or rice.  Also, it is a tad on the bland side, which I don't mind, but you might need some garlic or Tabasco or something to give it some kick.

It was good, but the sauce was way too thin! I'll try to use the 2 cans of soup, but play around with how much liquid to mix with it. I used a can of water. Milk next time? and only half.

I have used this recipe for years but mine had one more ingredient. You liberally sprinkle poultry seasoning over the chicken pieces and can use not only chicken breasts but legs and thighs if you want. The gravy is so good from the cream of chicken soup that I always make mashed potatoes to go with it.  This is one of the easiest and tastiest meals ever.

I am a novice cook and this was my choice for my first time baking chicken. Yummy. My fiance and  I loved how moist the chicken was! :) I read the reviews and made sure I put in a lot of seasoning: onion powder, ground pepper, lemon and pepper seasoning and seasoning salt. I also used 1 can used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery and water instead of milk. I cooked it for exactly an hour, but since I was pressed for time I put it on 400 degrees.

For what it is...this meal is super delicious. Very simple and fast. I seasoned the chicken with garlic, salt, and pepper to make it a little more flavorful and used 2 cans of soup with 1 1/2 cans of milk to make it thicker. I initially made it with noodles on the side...but we tried rice too which my husband liked better.

Ok this is good and is very quick. Not much creativity. Maybe while most kids that like chicken like it. Well for those adults, add a pinch of dill, garlic, oregeno and (possibly gargonzola) and it now has become an adult meal you pay high dollar for in a restuarant.

This recipe is pretty good.  But a warning for anyone watching their salt content (and that should be everyone), unless you are using low sodium soups, you should be careful of how much seasoning you use on the chicken.

This was an excellent and EASY meal for our family.  I did a bit of tweaking however....because my husband had a hearty appetite and my 9 yr old son is going through a huge growth spurt, I knew that 4 breasts would not be enough for our family.  I used 8 chicken breasts instead of 4....then 2 cans of cream of chicken, and 1 can cream of celery (mushroom would've worked too).  I doubled everything else and baked a little bit longer.  I also made rice and it worked nicely atop that.  My son loved it!!!

Always looking for easy recipes that all 4 kids will eat. This fits the bill. I like my meat to have a little color so, I salt and peppered my chicken and sautéed in grass fed butter for a min or so on each side. I also used 2 cans of cream of chicken, added fresh garlic to the mix as well as parsley. Very tasty and great over brown rice.

Delicious! I added about a 1/4 cup sour cream, as well as some black pepper and poultry seasoning. I baked for an hour and 10 minutes, then added crispy fried onions to the top for the last 20 minutes. I would probably take 10 minutes off the baking time next time.

I used Goya's Adobo for seasoning. And Evaporated milk (diluted 1:1). Ohh!, and I used a can of french cut green beans about 10 minutes before timer expired and mixed them with the cream. Turned out great ! The chicken was so tender and moist. 

Thank you for this recipe.

Good stuff! I was searching for something similar to my Mom's dish she made occasionally.  She loosely wrapped the chicken with Armour Dried Beef.  What a homecoming with this little change. Thank you for this recipe!

LOVE THIS!! We needed something different and this hit the spot!  I browned the chicken as well and then season with garlic power, a little rosemary, lemon pepper and a little salt. I mixed the soup with milk. And cut the chicken breast in half then put in oven. AWESOME! I also found a rice recipe on here. White rice made with half water half chicken broth. Added garlic and salt. When serving, I added some of the gravy from the chicken onto it. It's a score in my home!

I followed a few suggestions from other reviewers. I seasoned the chicken with season salt and used poultry gravy to mix with two cans of cream of chicken soup plus water. Baked at 400 for 40 minutes. Came out great. I cooked egg noddles and shredded the chicken. Added the chicken to the noodles and mixed in the soup/gravy mix.  It was great! More of a chicken noodle dish but we loved it!  Definitely a keeper!

OMG!  I made this dish for my family and they loved it! I combined a can of cream of chicken soup with a can of cheddar cheese soup. Also I added shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture & seasoned with fresh herbs. I have 2 Junior Hockey players in my house with big appetites, this is the dish that they request most often.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Quick and easy to prepare and everyone loved how it tasted.  The extra can is nice to make a gravy for the side dishes.  Will definitely make again.  For the chicken seasoning I used Mrs. Dash for chicken seasoning.

Loved this recipe! I browned the outside of the chicken in a frying pan to cut down on cooking time. I then also added a bag of frozen mixed veggies and herbs from my garden to add a little flavor! Turned out great!

Big hit. First, marinated halved chicken breasts for 20 mins in lemon juice. Added the tiniest bit of bullion powder, pepper, and poultry herb seasoning to both sides of the breasts before browning in a dual, large fry pan. Deglazed pan with sherry, added chicken soup can with only enough whole milk to ensure I was getting the full can into the pot. Stirred mixture. Added green onions (two stalks) and mixed again. Used French fried onions (Thanksgiving leftovers) to the tops of the chicken and popped in the oven at 350 long enough for the onions to crisp and the chicken to cook through.

I realize that what I made was not necessarily what the recipe calls for but  isn't that what we do? We know what our fam will tolerate and adjust accordingly? Anyway, the "recipe" was a smash hit with my 8-yr-old. Near Mother's Day so he actually filled out a worksheet where he named me a chef and said that he can tell I love him by the quality of food I make for him. All kid-cuteness aside, I had these ingredients and needed something quick to put on the table after school. It warmed our bellies (and obviously my heart) and for that, 5 stars woman!!! Full speed ahead and my sincerest salute!

I like that this is a good starting point for beginner cooks (wish I'd had it when I was just starting out!). A beginner can get a feel for cooking a few ingredients without feeling overwhelmed. For myself I add Italian seasoning, garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper, whatever vegetables I have around, omit the milk, and always add shredded cheese near the end. I usually serve over rice or egg noodles. It's filling and the kids like it which is a bonus!

Very easy recipe.  I few changes I made.  2 cans of creamed soup and 2 cans of Milk.  Cooked in oven for 45 minutes.  Topped with Mozzarella cheese and cooked for another 10 minutes.  Chicken was very moist and tender.  Family loved it.

Very bland. There was basically no flavourings for taste. Had to add minced garlic, mixed herbs, freshly ground black pepper, increase chicken seasoning and add cornflour at the end to thicken. I used water with the soup and added some cooking cream prior to serving. Cooked this dish in the slow cooker. After changing recipe to suit, it tasted lovely. I will make this again with my additions and may add some diced bacon and onion.

Very tasty ! I made a few changes: I sprinkled garlic powder, black pepper and a little old bay seasoning on the chicken. I used 2 cans of 99% fat free cream of soup and 1 can of low fat milk and a half can of water. Poured 1/2 the soup mixture on the chicken then a layer of sliced fresh mushrooms and then the remaining soup mix. Topped it all with a little bread crumbs and grated cheese. Served it with white rice and green peas (mixed together) . This was a delicious, hearty easy meal to prepare. Great for a week night too ! Thanks ! I'll make this again.

I loved this recipe but I made some changes after reading the reviews, like most people did. I added black pepper, Adobo seasoning, and pepper flakes to season the chicken. Used 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 can of water and 1/2 can of milk. I cooked all of this plus 1 bag of mixed veggies for 8 hrs on low in the crock pot. Came out great. There was plenty of sauce so if you want it thicker just use half can of water or milk. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was a home run in our house tonight! We used the No Yolk noodles with it for a colossal plate. Next time, I might season the chicken a bit more heavily, but other than that, I am certain that this will be a staple in our rotation of favorites!

Like others, I doubled the gravy makings and I'm glad I did! I'm a "spice-a-holic" who always likes a flavorful dish, so I used Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning to lightly season the chicken, then added a little more later to the gravy. There are so many ways to add variety to this easy-to-make dish, I'll definitely be making it again!

I love cream of chicken soup. However, this meal had very little flavor to me and I added salt, pepper and poultry seasoning before cooking. Should I have added more? Or is this better slow cooked in a crock pot?

This recipe is great if you want something quick and cheap! When I first tried it, I was concerned about the other reviews saying it was bland and the sauce was soupy. My sauce was a little thin but still tasted great. 

I really enjoy Cream of Chicken soup, so for me this was a recipe I was looking forward to trying. I, usually, don't change recipes; however, I didn't have a choice. I did not have any poultry seasoning so I just grabbed whatever was in my cupboard. I ended up using a mixture of paprika, cayenne, basil, and black pepper. It gave the chicken a nice kick while the Cream of Chicken soup helped balance it out. The chicken was also really nice and tender. I only had to cook it for 45 minutes, but I only cooked 2 small chicken breasts. 

I ate mine with a Knorr's Pasta Sides (Chicken flavored) and a side salad. This is a good meal that costs almost nothing and takes no real work. Great for after work or on days you just don't feel like cooking. I will make this again.

OMG this was the simplest recipe ever but tasted like I had been slaving in the kitchen for hours...I followed the recipe exactly....only seasoning the chicken with seasoning salt, pepper and lemon pepper...baked in the oven for 45 min and voila...the chicken was so tender and juicy.....my 3 year old even asked for more and she has only done that about 4 times in her life....if I could give it more than 5 stars I would.

I made this tonight. I had a pound of boneless chicken breast, and a can of cream of broccoli soup. I added a can of milk, a half cup of rice, a half cup of water, and a half cup of shredded cheddar. I baked it for an hour. It was a nice, warm, comforting casserole.  I also sliced up two carrots and threw them in. It's a very flexible recipe. Use any canned soup that you like and use any vegetables that you have on hand. Add seasoning to your taste.

This receipe is amazing. But i did change it some.... 
I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom; I also used lipton onion soup mix. I mixed it with the soup and the milk. 
I also did what some of the other reviews said browned the chicken on both sides and used a fork to poke holes in the chicken.
When the chicken was done i added some cheese on top and some sour cream. 
It was amazing and super easy.

This recipe is so easy and everyone in my family loves it.  I also added 1 can cream of mushroom soup to the original recipe and sauteed fresh mushrooms (mushrooms needed to be eaten before they went bad).  I cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and cooked them first on the stove top and drained them to avoid making the dish too watery.  I seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt and covered the top with cheddar cheese - oh yum!!

I even layered my favorite veggies under the chicken breasts and sprinkled Italian bread crumbs over the top. The family loved it and it is so easy.

Very easy to make, my grandson loved it over rice...but found it a little bland. I added a Tablespoon of sherry along with the poultry seasoning.

I really liked this but instead of using poultry seasoning, I tried Italian seasoning too & that also came out great too!!

Made this recipe as written, but with a little more poultry seasoning and some black pepper. I also used frozen breasts. I didn't find it that special. I would make it again, but spruce it up somehow - maybe with an additional can of soup of a different flavor, or seasoning the chicken specially and browning it first.

I made this with a can of cream of asparagus soup rather than cream of chicken, and added fresh mushrooms to it before cooking.  Used just 1 can of milk.  Surprisingly tasty!  Served it over rice with a side of veges.  It was yum!

So I've had this before but this is my first time actually making it myself so I'll see how it goes. From my experience it is a really delicious and comforting dish, very flavorful (you will have to season the chicken btw)and how can you go wrong with chicken?? I'm assuming it would be pretty hard to mess that up! I'll be having mine over rice...YUM! and will try and remember to post a pic when it is finished. Haha:) Wish me luck!

This was awesome, my husband loved it! I put salt and pepper on my chicken breasts, dis mot have any poultry stock so i just raided the pantry and sprinkled all sorts of dried herbs... Tarragon, marjoram, oregano, then added some onion powder. Instead of milk i used heavy whipping cream. Put in in the oven for 35 minutes and would brush it with more of the sauce evry 15 mins or so. Yummo. The cream of chicken soup and heavy whipping cream was awesome! So simple, i will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. I followed the recipe and the other comments were made. The only problem was that I used a too salty of a seasoning when I cooked it in the skillet. Next time I think I will only use a couple spiced... so it's not so SALTY!

since it is too hot to turn oven on, i made this a skillet dish.  cooked chicken in skillet w/salt, pepper, crushed red peppers, added soup, 1/2 cup of milk, and 1 cup frozen peas.  heat until thickens, serve over stove top white rice.  really good!

Very easy, very tasty, very calorie conscious (relatively). The only hassle was the 1.5hr wait for it to cook in the oven, (while people waited for their supper). Someone suggested sauteing in a skillet than cutting oven time to 30 min. May try that next time.

I mentally put this recipe in the "decent grub" category.  It has few ingredients, is quick, and isn't offensive to eat.  I seasoned the breasts with seasoned salt and added sauteed mushrooms on the casserole.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can milk for the sauce.  The gravy was a little runny/soupy for me and I'm curious what it would be like without adding any milk at all.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  I wouldn't go out of my way for this recipe, but it does just fine in a pinch if you've already got the ingredients around.

Fast& Easy. Very very scrumptious. I followed the original recipe, with an extra can of soup and I made it more... me. I cooked the chicken in a pan for a minute or two, and added a can of ro*tel.
Placed it into an oven....and thats a wrap.
