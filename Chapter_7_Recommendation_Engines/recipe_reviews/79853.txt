I can't believe the arrogance of some people who would give a bad rating to a recipe they never intend to make because they don't like the ingredients.  I guess I should go give bad reviews to every recipe with mushrooms in it because I don't like them, never eat them, and would use a recipe calling for them.  There should certainly be a way to report such abuse.  

That said, I have to say, the flavor combo is amazing.  Who woulda thunk it?

Fabulous recipe! I never would have thought of the livers paired with the squirrel! The addition of the onions is a must! Thanks Fred.

This was freaking delicious!  My fiancee and I never would have thought to put liver and squirrel together, but it came out awesome.  We used your recipe and added cabbage and some stewed tomatoes we canned ourselves.  It goes great over rice!  Thanks for putting this recipe up.  It's definitely a keeper!

Our local Wegmans doesn't carry squirrel, so I substituted organic free range chicken for squirrel and artisanal gluten free pancetta for liver. Delicious!
