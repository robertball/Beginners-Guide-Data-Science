7.5.19  Had to go to four stores to find dried blueberries (maybe dried blueberries just aren’t a big thing in Florida), finally found them at Sprouts in the bulk foods section.  Would suggest that you work fast when cutting the cookies because the dough softens quickly, becoming a bit crumbly and difficult to cut without falling apart.  Keep one cookie log in the fridge while you’re cutting the other.  They baked up nicely at 11 minutes with a texture that’s just a bit chewy, but the taste of a classic butter cookie you will have!  Only one comment about the blueberries.  They were hard to find and VERY expensive at $13.99 lb when I finally found them, but I really didn’t think the blueberry flavor popped in these cookies.  If I make again, I’ll try using dried cherries (they’d be a good partner to lemon), cut them into smaller pieces, and that’s a fruit that I easily can find (even at Aldi).  These were tasty cookies even though I didn’t think the blueberry flavor was pronounced and the lemon was subtle.  They’re easy to make, and I would make again.
