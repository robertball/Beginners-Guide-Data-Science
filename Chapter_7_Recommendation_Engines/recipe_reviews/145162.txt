Delicious and very refreshing - not to mention light! I love rice wine vinegar!  I didn't use the water, didn't see the need for it as the cucumbers produce enough water on their own when combined with salt plus rice wine vinegar is on the mild side. It really doesn't need to be diluted.  I used regular salt vs. seasoned salt. This is a definite keeper.

I made this as an alternative for the regular cucumber salad made with sour cream, as one of my guests has a dairy allergy.  I was surprised at how much I liked it!  A perfect lo cal / dairy free substitution to the regular cucumber salad!  I too omitted the water - not sure why it is included and why so much.  It was plenty liquid-y enough.  I also used just 1 teas. of white sugar as I am allergic to artificial sweeteners.  Thanks for the recipe!!

A refreshing salad...I used sugar in place of the Splenda and used only a splash of water instead of the recommended amount.  It has plenty of liquid even without using the full amount of water.

Perfect but without the water and used two tablespoons of white sugar... that's my tweak! :)

This was good. However, I agree with the other reviewers that the water is not needed- I added about 1/4 c and it was still very liquidy (if that's a word...). I was out of seasoning salt so I used a pinch of garlic salt instead. Also, I had rice vinegar (not rice wine vinegar) on hand so that's what I used. Great flavors and perfect for a summery salad.

This is super Cool for the hot summer months. I like to add celery seeds to mine fora little added flavor. Very nice for company and any meat you would serve with it or a light lunch on a bed of greens, maybe a scop of cottage cheese along side.

It was cruchy and looked wonderful, but flavor was a bit watery... so drained off most of the watery liquid, added 1 TBLS of Sushi Vinegar (rice vinegar with sugar added) mixed and served about 2 hours later...
Perfect flavor, everyone raved about how good it was.

Delicious!  I made this on a hot summer day with Thai pork skewers and homemade peanut sauce and it was a hit! The littel bit of sugar made a difference.  I salted my cucumber slices for a bit over a bowl in a sieve with a bag of ice water to weigh them down to release some of the mositure.  People loved this!

Three stars as written for us.  This was better the next day after the tang of the vinegar penetrated the cucumbers some, but it was quite watered down.  Overall I like the idea and will make this again with only 1/2c water.

I halved this, as DH won't touch a cucumber to save his life! (Good, more for me). I can't imagine why this recipe would call for water, so like most reviewers, I omitted it. I thinly sliced one English cucumber and had to sub a Vidalia onion for the red (didn't measure; just slivered what looked right to me) and used 1/2 tsp white sugar. I'm standing over the kitchen sink "taste-testing" this, but I can only imagine how good it'll be in another day (if it even lasts that long!) One of my favorite summer sides; this one will be made frequently!

I thought this tasted alright. I have tried similar salads with the classic version of this, which I usually make 1 or 2 times every summer, and they are so much better. I didn't have Splenda, so I just used 1 tsp of regular sugar. After adding it, I thought it still tasted like vinegar still and added 1 more. It will get eaten, but I will stick to the full sugar version I normally make each year for holiday picnics.

Love this recipe, but I also like to add a little pepper to taste and white sugar instead on Splenda.  And I agree with everyone, you don't need the water, but I like to cut the vinegar just a bit.

Very light salad. I agreed with not adding the water. I added fresh basil as it's growing rapidly in my garden. Great salad. This is a keeper.

Quick, simple side dish.  Only needs 1/4 cup water.  Tastes even better on day two after it has chilled and marinated for a while.

This just replaced my normal tomato, cucumber and onion salad as my favorite. It is very light and refreshing with the right hint of tartness. I used only 1 heaping teaspoon of regular sugar (we dislike the substitute), regular salt and pepper with a heaping teaspoon of dill. We will definitely have this again and soon.

This is a great recipe but there's way too much water. I cut down the water by a half cup and honestly it still was too much water. My husband and I both love vinegar so next time I'll try 3/4 cup vinegar and half a cup of water. However, this is just like Dad used to make when we were little. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I tried this and one and it is my all time favorite for cucumbers.  When our cucumbers get ripe from our garden I always make this. I didn't add the water at all. You really don't need it if you put the salt in it then the water just comes out of cucumbers. I added dill which I love in it. I rate it a 4 stars.

Followed the previous reviews, skipped the water and used sugar only.  I used a vidalia onion instead of red onion.  Added some black pepper and Mrs. Dash seasoning.
