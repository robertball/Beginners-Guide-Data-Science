Really good recipe! We are using this recipe for a scouting event. A great tip to dispense this, is to use a cleaned out ketchup bottle. Use your funnel or a funnel made out of foil and laddle  batter into your ketchup bottle. Makes it easier to just squirt it in and the apperance comes out just as nice.

These came out a whole lot better than they did the first time I made them. I added a little nutmeg, vanilla extract, an extra tsp. of sugar, and more milk than the recipe called for. A zip lock bag was used to swirl the batter into the hot oil. I also scaled the recipe down to four servings and topped each with confectioner's sugar and cherry pie filling. Tasted great!

Great recipe...  It's important to follow the directions and start with only half the flour, adding the rest a little at a time until you get the right consistency.  It will probably end up too thick if you use the full amount of flour in the recipe.

I don't have a funnel, so put the batter in a plastic bag and cut off the corner.  I also used some of the batter to make fried Oreos (just dip the Oreos in the batter and fry).  Mmmmm.

We all LOVE funnel cake and, like most people, only get them at the shore, amusement parks, etc. - until now! My big sister used to make these for me when I was young, but she couldn't remember how so I once again looked to allrecipes for help. I was not disappointed! I took the advice of others and only used 2 2/3 c. flour. Ultimately, I used all but appr. 1/4 c. to achieve the right consistency. I also increased the sugar to appr. 1/2 c. (it just wasn't sweet enough for us) and added 1 t. vanilla. Excellent! Saved the left over batter for the next time we're having a craving!

I absolutely loved this!  It tasted just like the funnel cakes at the amusement parks.  I only gave it a 4 because I had to alter the recipe by adding less flour (about 1/2 cup) and more milk (a little more than a 1/3 cup).  I also added a little more sugar and some vanilla extract. It was delicious!  A measuring cup works great if you don't have a funnel.

Good when you're feeling nostalgic...though I don't remember them being so crispy at Six Flags.  Since making these I tried "Funnel Cakes I" from this site, and they were much more authentic.

Turned out great, we didn't have a funnel so cut out a corner of a zip lock bag and it worked out great.  Thanks for the post.

Perfect! My wife LOVES funnel cake, I whipped these up for her as a surprise and she thought - for a brief moment - that I was truly the best man in the world.  Making these at home is way easier than I ever thought and they're as good as any I've paid $5 for at the fair.

Excellent recipe!  Tips for best results:  you want cake like batter, use 1 tsp vanilla, add sugar to taste, use whole milk, oil must be really hot before you pour.  Better than carnival cakes!

These turned out great! I have a friend who really likes them, so I wanted to see if I could find a recipe. I just used a regular plastic funnel. These were fun to make to make to. It does make quite a bit of batter though. I cooked them in a pan on the stove top. I heated vegetable oil on medium (5) first. And, by the time I was done mixing the ingredients the oil was up to 375 deg according to my thermometer. The funnel cakes browned up nicely, and tasted like a crispy chewy doughnut. I sprinkled them with powdered sugar. Thanks, for the neat recipe!

Yum!  Very tasty.  Just make sure you have the temp high enough or you will be disappointed.  If anything, make it a few degrees higher so that when you add the batter, and the temp drops, you will still have a wonderful funnel cake.

Maybe I'm just use to eating the best funnel cakes around (I use to work at Six Flags) but I thought these were plain. So, I added vanilla, sweetened condensed milk, and cinnamon until it started to get a sweeter flavor. I gave it 3 stars because I feel this has potential with the addition of flavor. UPDATE: I saved a little bit of batter from yesterday, and made more funnel cakes today, topped them with powered sugar, carmel, leftover cream cheese icing... and BOY... it was delicious. I will make these agin with the additions! 4 stars! ****

This is the first recipe that I have ever tried to make from Allrecipes, so when my husband and I looked at the ingredients we thought it wasn't going to be enough to fill the stomachs of 10 people, so we had doubled it. DO NOT DO WHAT WE DID! I wish I had cut the ingredients in half! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and added a little more sugar as some reviewers suggested. But, anyway, I tried this with a measuring cup, but came out too thick; then I found out I had a Funnel and used that. It worked very well, but I still have enough to make about another 20 cakes and I had already used about a liter of oil for it. Though almost everyone liked it, it did give us a stomach ache in the end. But this is a recipe that I would only make once in a while, and probably at a better time than midnight. It was delicious, but takes some time to master heating and pouring just the right amount into the skillet.

mmmmmmm   australia doesnt do funnel cakes so i had to improvise because i absolutely LOVE them.... finally got around to making these tonight and i left the recipe alone and thought it was perfect as written though next time i might try adding some vanilla and cinnamon to the mixture... i did use less flour.. about a cup less i think and that even ended up being too much so i added about a tablespoon extra of milk to thin it out a bit and it was excellent... powder sugar on top and my husband threw some ice cream and chocolate sauce on his.  it was his first time ever having a funnel cake and i think its safe to say they left a lasting impression.. he even asked "can we have these every week?" lol

This recipe had to be severly altered to work right. The original recipe was way to dry it needed a whole cup more liquid. and it also needed more flavor. Took about a half hour to fix this recipe....

These were yummy and delicious!  Forget the funnel and just find a container with a nice pour spout.  After reviewing the reviews, I automatically cut the recipe in half--well, I am now going to cut it down to 1/4 the recipe for a family of four.

I made the 4 serving version.  The funnel method and baggie version didn't work too well for me.  I ended up using a cake piping tool without the tip and it worked perfectly.  They tasted amazing.

Very delicious...just like being down at the shore!  I added about a tablespoon of vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg.  My son gobbled one of them up immediately!  I will definitely be making these again!

These turned out great! The only other thing I would've done was put the batter into a squeeze bottle of some sort to make it easier to use-I did the plastic bag method, and it was very messy. Aside from that it was a super yummy, easy Father's Day dessert. I served them with ice cream and blueberries. Will be making these a lot!

I really debated between 4 and 5 stars on because I would definitely add more sugar in the actual batter, just because I don't like a lot of toppings and appreciate the cake itself for what it is. I don't think that this cake is quite sweet enough otherwise.  Still it cooked up really nicely, was light, crunchy on the outside and fluffy inside.  Not too oily or heavy!    Made an ample amount of funnel cakes, I had enough to send some to a neighbor for breakfast as well.  I'm really very pleased by this recipe, thanks so much for sharing it!

Great recipe! A good way to test if the oil is at 375 degrees is to drop a 1" piece of bread into the oil. If it bread takes 50 seconds to brown, then the oil is at 375 degrees. I added a bit more sugar than the recipe called for and 3/4 tsp of vanilla extract. The funnel cake came out very tasty!

Terrific recipe!

Just be sure to "pipe" the batter (should you use a plastic bag or pastry bag) fairly thick.

Tastes exactly like at the fair, and a whole lot cheaper!  I put the leftovers in the freezer.  I'll reheat them in the convection oven and see how it works.  Thanks for a great recipe!

As other reviews said... I would add less flour next time.  Tried it without vanilla first then added vanilla ... I preferred it without but it was good both ways.   Just the funnel cake fix we needed!

Just what I was looking for.  I calculated the recipes to make 4 funnel cakes and still had enough to make 6.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.

These were very good. I added a little bit of vanilla extract to the batter and used a squeeze bottle to put the batter in the oil.

Made these again yesterday for a quick snack for the boys when they came in from school.  I cooked them in a 9 inch castiron skillet.  The boys commented that the more I make these the better they are. I did make 2 substitutions tho.  I added vanilla and added 1/2 cup sugar instead.  The were wonderful.  Also after getting up this morning I made them for breakfast and the kids enjoyed them again.  I made a total of 12 cakes.  I will make these again for the bake sales and put them into ziplock baggies.  Thanks again for the great recipe.

*****EXCELLENT***** recipe!!  With a family of Celiac sufferers, I am always looking for recipes that will convert easily to gluten-free.  This is one of the better ones--although (as with most GF conversions) I had to use a bit more flour to get the consistency right.  As for the recipe in general, the taste of these cakes is simply unmatched--and it's sooooo easy!  I added a splash of double-vanilla exract and even replaced ALL the sugar with Splenda, and my kids went crazy for them!  It's so exciting to be able to make these, because since our family has had to go gluten-free, we've obviously had to give up many foods, and it can be discouraging for kids--especially when going to fairs and seeing everyone else indulging in things they think they can never have again.  Being able to have funnel cakes again really lifted my wee-ones' spirits.  Thanks so much for sharing this, Tina!

Very yummy, just like the fairs! You can play around with differnt toppings. This browns really fast so keep your eye on it. It will takes a few trys to get the hang of it and make the "classic look". I suggest starting from the middle making a back and forth motion; if you spread the mix out to much it will separate. Makes a lot and you can freeze it. Good luck!

My mom texted me a picture of her funnel cake whilr she was at a music festival and i immediately had to figure out how to make one and thats how i ended up here. These were so good!! I dont have a funnel so i used a freezer bag and clipped the end and it worked just fine. I added a bit more sugar as suggested by others and it was yummy!

Awesome recipe and super easy to whip up. I threw all the ingredients except for the flour into the bowl of a food processor and just pulsed until combined, then added the flour a bit at a time, pulsing in between to incorporate. 3 cups was perfect. The full amount in the recipe would be way too much. They fry to a beautiful golden brown in no time at all. A word of advice: make them right before you plan to eat them, because they do lose their crispiness if they sit out too long.

This was my first time making funnel cakes. I halved the recipe after reading the other reviews but wished I hadn't! I will keep the original porportions and that will give me 8 cakes of about 8" across. I used one of the bottles from the picnic condiment set at the dollar store with the tip cut off so I had an opening of about 1/4". I had no problem forming these cakes either, I started with an outside circle then zig zagged inside of it. I also used all the flour, increased the milk by an extra 4 tbsp and added a tbsp vanilla. They were so good my husband purposely made himself late for work just so he could eat more of them. lol

The batter was to thick/thin for a funnel.  It was easier just to pour straight from the bowl.

I make these for children I work with.  They absolutely love them and tell me they are better than what they get at the fairs.  
I add a little vanilla to the batter and put cinnamon in the powdered sugar.

REALLY good, and easy to make. I had intended to take the advice of other reviewers and add vanilla, but forgot to and didn't even notice. I only wanted to make enough for me and my daughter, so I changed the recipe to 4 servings, which made two very large funnel cakes, which was perfect. Pretty darn good!

Tastes JUST like the funnel cake at the state fair. Except now I can have it all year long and for a fraction of the price! I also used this same recipe to do Fried Snickers (sounds crazy but I was turned on to these at the South Carolina State Fair a couple years ago- DELICIOUS) I coated the snickers (or whatever candy bar you like) in the batter and then rolled it in flour and then coated in batter again. Fried it in oil for about a minute per side. Topped with powdered sugar. SOOOOOOO GOOD! Definitely not healthy but well worth the calories.

Perfect consistency! I loved the flavor, not too sweet. The only thing I did differently was using cake flour instead of all purpose. Did some with cinnamon sugar and did some w/ powdered sugar. I even did some with a combination of both. Mmmmmm, just made us all feel we were back at the carnival! Nothing like bringing the flavors of the carnival home without the expense...LOL

great recipe. They came out perfect. They aren't as sweet as the ones we get at the fair, but just sweet enough.

These were so easy to make & so yummy! My 13 year old made them pretty much by himself. It does make a lot, so we have the rest of the batter in the fridge for tomorrow. Hopefully it will cook up just as good the next day. It took us a couple of tries to get the technique down, but then it was a cinch! OH SO fattening, but anything deep fried is going to be!

This was excellent! I added some vanilla extract and a pinch of nutmeg and YUMMY! Make sure the oil is very hot, otherwise the batter won't brown right. I will be making this again..and again..and again lol!

yummmmmmmy!!!  I decided to make these before the basketball game and the family loved them so much they kept coming to the kitchen instead of watching the game.  I did not change anything in the recipe and I used a batter dispenser that I have for pancakes.  They were just sweet enough and perfect!  Will definitely be a keeper.  Oh and it made lots and lots!

These were VERY tasty.  I used my deep fryer and had to put the oil on 400 degrees to get these right.  I also need to play with the amount of flour as I think I started off with the mixture a little too thin.  Made for a nice treat for me and the hubby though.  Could become addictive....

These Funnel Cakes hit the spot! I, too, added a teaspoon of vanilla for flavoring. I also had to add a touch more milk  to make it pourable. Thanks for such a great recipe! I will make these again.

I made these with my 3 girls instead of paying for some at the local festival. WOW! Sooooo much better than anything we could have paid $$ for! My grandmother was with us, and in all of her 81 years she had never had a funnel cake...let's just say that she had 2 and licked her fingers! In her understated way she pronounced them, 'pretty tasty'. We will definitely make again.  Oh, and the ketchup bottle idea is a true gem-- easy use, easy clean-up. And the dash of vanilla was the only change I made.

Really really tasty.  We went to Knott's Berry Farm yesterday and they were charging $7.75 for each cake.  Forget that!  This recipe is just as delicious without the unbelievable cost.  The kids were thrilled.

I think it is a good base but something is missing.  I did add vanilla as many suggested.  I will try and make again.  Thanks for the ketchup bottle tip.  It made it a lot easier.

Yum. Just as good if not better than the ones from actual funnel cake stands. After some experimenting I found that: very thick batter is best, just like the recipe makes; when using a ziplock bag, cut the corner so you get a fairly wide stream if you like the cakes less crunchy; adding at least a tsp. of vanilla really helps the flavor; I add an extra 1-2 tablespoons sugar depending on the size of the batch. The dough freezes well if you only want to make one or two at a time. I've been on a funnel cake craze ever since finding this recipe!

Delicious! I can't believe that I can now make this anytime, and it is so easy. I just added some brown sugar instead of regular sugar, and sprinkled with cinammon and powdered sugar. Bring the carnival home by making these yummy cakes! My kids love them!

I absolutely love this funnel cake recipe. I have made it before and this recipe has that one beat hands down. I did lessen the flour to about 2 2/3 cups. I did sift it. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. It is now in my recipe book and will be made in our family often. I made it twice in the same week. This is the closet recipe to the carnival. Thank you! We ate'em til our stomachs hurt!

very yummy! i make these quite often! i usually put all the batter in a very large zip-lock bag, and cut a small hole in one of the cornors, and szueeze the batter out into the hot oil. i think it works better then a funnel, and not so messy. when they're all done i cut a bunch of strawberries and cover them in a strawberry glaze (you can buy it a gorcery store) i then put them on top of the funnel cakes and then put powder sugar and whipped cream on top! just like i remember from the amuzement park! delish! thanks a bunch for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe! I followed the directions except I doubled the amount of sugar.  And as others suggested, I slowly added flour until the batter was the right consistency. Since I didn’t have a funnel, I used a Ziploc bag with the corner cut off to pour the batter.  The key to making the perfect Funnel cake is pouring the mixture into the oil in a circular motion and having the oil at a very high temperature so that the cakes won’t absorb too much oil.

I am from New England and have never even eaten a funnel cake before - never heard of them until I saw them on The Food Network.  My kids and I had so much fun making these and my 2 year old was actually on the floor crying waiting for the second batch to finish!  I added a splash of vanilla, and cut down the flour as other reveiwers suggested.  I don't have anything to compare these to, but they were FABULOUS.

This recipe was very easy to prepare; I used suggested amount of flour, less about 1/4 cup to get the right consistency. I used a thermometer to get my oil to the exact temperature. My first attempt came out burnt and didn't look much like a funnel cake at all. The next one came out much better,and I realized just how difficult it is to get that technique down. I think if I make this again, I will use just a little less baking powder. The finished cake was too airy, which made it much crispier on the outside than I would prefer.For some reason, I could hardly eat this when it was finished. It filled me up extremely quickly, so unless you are making these for 10 or more people, definitely scale down the recipe. I have found that funnel cake just tastes better when you pay $5 for it at the fair.

Oh My Lord.... I always loved going to county fairs; and theme parks.. the rides were great, but it was all about the funnel cakes for me. I haven't had them in years to be honest; who know they could be so easy to make at home by yourself! Thanks!!!

Loved it. Very tasty and easy to make. My family couldn't eat the whole recipe, tho. I might cut it by half next time I make it.

Very tasty!!!  For additional flavor, we added a little cinnamon to the batter before frying.  With regards to frying, we had a little trouble with the batter "breaking up" in the oil, so our first attempt did not produce funnel cakes that looked like those at the fair.  We used a larger pan (similar to a dutch oven) for frying, so we're not sure if that was the problem or perhaps the oil was too hot.  Anyway, they still tasted great and we will try it again!

Wow!  What a wonderful recipe, and so easy!  This was just perfect -- a tiny bit sweet, but not too much.  It took about 3 cups of the flour to get the batter to the right consistency.  I used an emptied jelly squeeze bottle instead of a funnel and it worked fine, probably easier than a funnel.  Don't worry if it doesn't look as pretty when you first swirl the batter as the ones at the fair -- it'll puff up and end up looking beautiful by the time you're done.  This recipe does make a LOT of funnel cakes; I made them for a good sized party and still had batter left over.

I did the recipe as written and it was perfect! Some of the bad reviews may be do to cook error. Tips- 1. use a liquid measuring cup for milk ( there is a difference) 2. Don't use packed flour, loosen it up before measuring and the recipe also says you might not need all of it. Use what you need to get the desired thickness. Don't forget to divide flour and do the seperate flour for mix and then gradually add remaining flour. This step is crucial! 3. If it's to crispy you might want to work on how your doing your circles (it takes some practice) do quick tight circles. If that doesn't work use a funnle with a larger opening. If your having issues still then your frying it way to long! 
Thank you for sharing this recipe. My family LOVES it.

This recipe is a blessing and a curse! It's super easy and so delicious.  But now I fear that what was once a one time of year indulgence at that fair is now going to be an every  weekend treat!

This recipe was a hit at home. We originally were just making enough for the 2 of us but quickly each family member came into the kitchen and placed their orders. Strawberries, and ice cream topping really make it taste just like the fair. My only problem with this recipe was that there is considerable amount of guesswork involved in figuring out the right consistency with the flour.

We used half coconut oil and half canola for frying.   The recipe was terrific!  We went to the state fair yesterday and a $10 funnel cake was not in the budget.   These were even better and much more fun and economical.  The kids completely enjoyed watching/helping.

We enjoyed these and the wonderful aroma as they were frying said a lot! I followed the recipe as is except I may have only used between 2 1/2 to 3 cups of flour. I added 2tbsp of vanilla (love the taste of vanilla)! I also used more sugar (about 3/4c total). The extra left over was stored in the refrigerator (used an empty Kraft Ranch Dressing bottle with the small hole on the top. The piece/attachment on the bottle is easy enough to pop off so as to make putting the mix inside the bottle easy and it pops right back on. Quite a bit of mix was left over so stored the extra into the bottle and placed in refrigerator. This mix was made on a Friday and we were still making cakes on Sunday. Great recipe!

I nailed it on my first try, I have 6 kids and they all loved it!!! The only thing I did different was to mix everything all at once instead of setting some things aside (its nye and my wine with dinner must be kicking in....:-)) but this recipe will certainly be used over and over again!!!!

I dont like them as much as my family does. I do a few funnel cake things, then I do blobs, like donut holes. I like the donut holes better.

VERY GOOD!  We have food allergies in our family.  So I substituted with egg replacer and vanilla soy milk.  Finally a funnel cake that turned out delicious!  My husband likes it thinner, so next time I will use a lot less flour.

these weren't nearly as puffy or tender as the ones from the fair. it definitely only needed half the flour and benefited from the addition of vanilla. still, they were tasty.

Oh, YUM!!.  Haven't even cleaned up the kitchen after frying up these delectable treats - HAD to share how wonderful they are.  Followed suggestions for adding less flour.  Take it from a New England girl and try these spread with Maple Cream - to die for!!  Spread it on right out of the pan, making sure to get the nooks and crannies as best you can and let cool a bit (if you can wait) - Thanks, Tina for a great recipe!

YUMMM! Top this with a little powdered sugar and boysenberry topping and you will be in heaven. You do need to add a little vanilla extract for posterity though, as other reviewers have commented. I made these the other night for a family party and they LOVED them.

I went with a lot of the reviews - I added vanilla but these were actually fairly difficult to make. If i made them too thick they were sometimes doughy in the center if they cooked too fast, but if they were too thin they burned easy and were very stringy. Eventually I got a golden funky shaped (who cares though, right?) funnel cake that tasted good. So through my messy kitchen and first few mess ups, all in all it was a good recipe.

Very, Very yummy.  Makes quite a few large (7") funnel cakes.  Rolled some in sugar/cinnamon, some in powdered sugar and fresh strawberries and cream.  Made recipe exactly with the only addition of 2 tsps of vanilla.  Found I only needed 3 cups of flour to reach desired consistency.

Awesome funnel cakes!  I have a crock-pot/deep fryer and made them in there using one cup dough at a time for a nice size funnel cakes!  I also used all purpose white whole wheat flour and 2 tsp vanilla.  Tasty and healthier!

Tasted just like the funnel cakes at a fair or amusement park. I used a baster and was able to make very fine strands in my deep fryer - making the cake a bit crispier -- family loved it!! Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was super easy!!! I didn't have a funnel so I used an icing bag... added a teaspoon of vanilla and used 1/2 cup sugar and a bit of cinnamon.  Topped it with powdered sugar and Smuckers strawberry jam - HEAVENLY!! Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG I love funnel cakes, but they're always so expensive at the fair. These were delicious! I did add a little bit more sugar to the batter after I made the first one to satiate a stronger sweet tooth. but this was simply a yummy recipe. I ended up storing 1/2 of the batter because I made 4 plate sized cakes and only used 1/2 of the batter. This was simply a yummy recipe. Thanks for sharing it!!!

very good  i always add vanilla and a little cinnamon  for my funnel.. (because  this is what i saw them use at the theme park when i worked there)  i used a watering can  the one the has spout similar to a funnel not the one that looks like a sprinkler. i originally used a regular funnel but found that when the dough hit the oil the steam would rise and really burn... the can is large enough that i dont have to have my hand directly above the oil.  found it in the dollar store for $1!!

These were awesome!! I've never had a funnel cake before, so I don't have anything to compare these to, but I thought they were great and so did the rest of my family. I will make these again, for sure :)

I didn't have a funnel, so I used a juice pitcher and a spoon. Made the consistency more "watery". Delicious!

Fantastic!  Served with whipped cream and sliced strawberries soaked in sugar.  I used a funnel and it worked beautifully.  Make sure you take these out when they are a lighter golden brown, that is if you don't care for them crispy.  I used my small fry daddy (perfect size and shape for funnel cakes!)

It takes a little practice to get the "swirling" down. First time it came out looking like fried noodles, so we made a bigger hole in the bottle we used. That worked better and we had it down by the third one. Should have doubled the recipe to compensate for our trials. Kids definitely enjoyed it as did the adults. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that worked great for my sons carnival themed birthday party.

I was trying to decide between 3 or 4 stars. I usually rate 4 if I have to touch up a recipe, and apparently a 3 if I have to touch it up and it still isn't great. These funnel cakes weren't bad but they weren't what I was expecting either. I have made funnel cakes before so inexperience wasn't an issue, but I don't have that recipe anymore so I was looking for a new one. This isn't it.  I added some vanilla, I added an extra 1/4-1/3 c. sugar and that helped a lot. Be sure to cook these until a dark golden brown; otherwise they will be doughy in the middle. This could have been because I poured out of a liquid measuring cup though and my "strands" were a little bigger than I meant for them to be. I made it the consistency of pancake batter, and that's pretty much what it tasted like: fried pancakes. On the upside, with not much ingredients it makes a lot. Definitely half this if you have less than 4 or 5 people. We don't eat small portions around here when it comes to sweets and I had about half a batch left over.  If you have time and a good idea to try these go ahead, lots of good reviews here. I'll be trying the next one on the list.

Very good. But I use a candy makers bottle and I snip the tip to make it as large as I want my funnel cakes thick.  Always very yummy and exactly like mother used to make.  Makes a very nostalgic breakfast.

I love funnel cakes, but something about this recipe was off.  I didn't use vanilla.  Next time I will.  Just wasn't sweet enough for me.  My 10 year old loved it.

This is a really easy and good recipe, me and my friend are using this recipe for a school marketing project, we tried it with cream (it's all out teacher had.) and it tasted magnificant! Though we had to add about 1/4 cup of water to make it less thick.

This recipe is so easy and fun! I enjoyed it from start to delicious finish! I only needed half of the flour as recipe states, and I used a plastic baggie to pour the batter. If you want a yummy treat, go ahead and splurge on this recipe!

I had just finished making Grandma's Doughnuts, and had lots of Canola oil hot, begging for something else to fry.  Great recipe.  I mixed it up in my blender.  Made excellent funnel cakes.  With the remaining cup of batter, I added chopped, peeled apples and dropped by generous spoonful into the hot oil.  Drained the 'fritters', the rolled in cinnamon sugar.  YUM!

The hubby and I were both a little blue yesterday, so we figured this was a perfect indulgent pick-me-up.  These turned out perfectly just as written, although I don't think I used ALL of the recommended flour.  But pretty close.  Thank you for an awesome recipe! :-)

Made just 1/3 of this recipe and it was enough for 2 funnel cakes.  I also added a bit of vanilla for taste and a little extra milk to make it easier to pour from the bag.  I used a sandwich sized plastic bag and cut a hole about the size of a hole punch in a corner.  Made it easy!  Watch it carefully - it cooks fast!

The batter turned out very thick, I had to add quite a bit more milk to make it the right consistency to pour.  Flavor was ok, but I will stick to my usual recipe.

I misplaced the recipe I had been using for funnel cake, so when my daughter asked for some this morning, I turned to allrecipes.  This recipe is much better than the one I had been using.  My daughter even said they were better than the carnival's!  I followed the directions and started with 1/2 the flour--I found that to be plenty.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

this was good, but i think i made a mistake. im thinking that i didnt blend the eggs, sugar, and milk well enough, it wasent creamed enough, and maby the mixture in the end was thick, i dident even add the extra flour.hmm... it was still kinda good. haha it looked almost like a pancake, yet in strips.

This is so good.  We put powdered sugar, syrup,honey, or a mixture of cinnamon and sugar on ours.  These are even good just plain. YUM!

Pretty dang good.  Not quite like the ones at the fair though...I think adding more sugar might make them closer to "authentic".  I ate mine topped with chocolate sauce and powdered sugar and enjoyed every bite!

This is the best!!! Tastes just like the amusement park variety. Very simple. I did find however that you must have the funnel otherwise its hard to get the thin stream of batter.

Quite delish. each one disappeared before I could add another to the plate! I had great luck using a TURKEY BASTER in place of a funnel. I did find it slightly thick but that was easy to fix by adding a tablespoon more liquid at a time until consistency is just right. I will make these again!

Thanks for the wonderful recipe. Just like at the state fair. It makes quite a bit too. It is worth 5 stars. My family loves these. Makes a great snack instead of popcorn, and just as fast too.

This was a super easy and delicious recipe.  I didn't have any milk, so I subsituted a cup of sweetened condensed milk plus on cup of water for the milk and sugar.  It did make a lot of funnel cakes.  I'll probably do half next time.  One thing was the squeeze bottle that some recommended.  While it was convenient, the pieces were thin and many became crunchy.  I switched to using a funnel half way through and they were bigger, fluffier, and easier to turn.

This recipe was meh. It produced way too much flour than needed.  It is very bland!!  I added about a tbs of vanilla to add flavor.  Never using this recipe again.

First time making these, and not great the first try.  I have it mastered now first by adding 1/2 cup sugar and a bit of vanilla to the batter.  Thought I could take a short cut by frying these in my deep fryer since the oil was hot from another recipe, don't do it!  Follow directions and use the small 8" fry pan with oil.  After this, I tried again and perfection!

The flour measurement was wrong. It stated 2 2/3 cups, shouldn’t it be 1.5 cups? I used 2 2/3 cups and the thing was real thick. It turned out more like a fried donut, but my kids ended loving their fried donut. Funnel cake will need a more runny batter for sure.

I make these yummy funnel cakes for every block party, by popular demand. They are perfect for outdoor cooking; we use a propane camp stove. I do suggest adding 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla to really elevate the batter. We make these outside using

The amounts turned out well, I recommend to use a small pot or fying pan that is deep enough. I added a splash of white vanilla extract. My family loved it.

I cut the recipe in half because there are only 2 of us. Made 6 and have enough batter left for about 4 more. Because my fryer is small inside I used a silicon egg mold (from Walmart) to form the small cakes. Used something less than the suggested flour and only had about 3/4 C of milk so I used 1/4 C of beer.

So easy and very good. I did use a plastic squeeze bottle and cut the tip to make it larger.  So much easier to squirt out the batter than using a funnel.  Will definitely make again and again. A quick snack or last minute dessert.

Absolutely loved it. I read through the comments and wow people. Every ingredient was prefect. If they are too crispy, add a little more than half a cup. This made quiet a bit so I am going to use the rest of the batter tonight. Too crispy...come on....maybe you fried them too long, and if the baking powder was too much....did you measure? Wow... and for the record...I bake ALL the time... These were just fine, and I will DEFINITELY make them again!

The county fair had the worst funnel cakes. They didn't fry them they heated them up in a bag.  What is this world coming to.  So I made my girls this recipe and added additional sugar and some vanilla.  They said they were the "Bomb".  Thanks for sharing.

Very good and easy recipe.  I too used a ketchup bottle; it made the job MUCH easier. I also added nutmeg and vanilla to taste. I will definitely use this one every time we want funnel cakes. I already do cakes and catering as a side job. Incorporating funnel cakes for parties is a must on our menu now.  Thanks!

Recipe is just okay. The directions are terrible. First, I recommending whisking instead of mixing. Second, I would pour batter in a spiral pattern. Third, frying is very fast so be prepared, like less than a minute per side. LASTLY, EXPECT A HUGE MESS TO CLEANUP!!

Deliciousness in all its simplicity.  This recipe is easy to put together with things you probably already have in house.  The only thing I did different was add vanilla.  It gives it that sweet, aromatic flavor.  Other than that, perfect.  Oh yeah, it makes pretty good zeppoles, too.  I scraped down the bowl, plopped it in the oil (carefully) and voila!

This recipe is awesome! I use this funnel cake batter to make fried Oreos in. I always get the limited edition Oreos (like strawberry shortcake, birthday cake, cinnamon roll, Reece's, etc) and dip them in the batter then just fry them for a few minutes on each side til golden brown. Turns out amazing every time!

I followed the advice suggested by many, and used a ziplock bag with an edge snipped off the side to make my funnel cakes! I also added a healthy squirt of vanilla extract! This was AMAZING - we could've eaten it without the powdered sugar, it was so so good as is! The vanilla flavors really came through, and we kept it warm in the oven set at 200 degrees until we were ready for it. I would highly recommend that you consume this as soon as it comes off the oil, however, as it was AMAZING off the oil, and not as great after it was kept warm in the oven.

VERY VERY EASY; Please note that batter cooks very fast, so be prepared to flip it almost as soon as the batter hits the oil! I made this with a chocolate sauce for dipping and smothered on the powdered sugar...definitely makes for less completes of the burnt bits that I managed by accident. 

I think I may add a bit more sugar to the actual dough next time; it wasn't very sweet for my taste, lol! 

(thanks again for the recipe!!!)

Loved these. Made in a fry daddy. I didn't have an extra ketchup bottle and actually used a funnel for the first one. It came out rather slowly. The next batch I just poured it in from my measuring cup. Worked just as good. Really enjoyed this treat (a little too much!)

Funnel cake came out ok, however, i never made funnel cake before and did not realize that you need a very small opening on the funnel and do not need much batter either for  1 serving to make a good size cake - i put way too much dough on my 1st cake from the funnel and it took a while for the dough to cook because i used the largest funnel lol , also added vanilla as suggested on other reviews , also found i hardly had to use from the side flour measured...it was fine as is - makes a lot of dough ... because being quite greasy will not make it too often

Very good, and very easy to make!  We doubled the recipe without any issue.  We did add Pure vanilla and it was a nice touch.  We have a "funnel pitcher" that worked really well, too.  We did have to add a bit more water as we went along as the batter does tend to thicken with time.  Just keep that in mind when frying as we had a glass of water and a wisk at arms reach.  Can't wait to make again!

Flavor was great, and fried up wonderfully! Used only 2 1/2 c flour and increased milk to 2 1/3 c (as suggested) to get the correct consistency. We also bought aluminum stove pipe rings to use as forms for the cakes. They worked awesome! Especially the small 4" one for little "personal cakes". You can start one 4" funnel cake in the form, let it cook a little bit until slightly brown to hold the shape, pull the form off using a pair of tongs, and start another one. You can really make them fast this way. We can get four of the 4" ones in our 14" dutch oven on the King Cooker. Great for family outings. They were a huge hit at ours!

Just made this lastnight for the family. It was super delish. I added fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it. It made about 6 good sized cakes, I do recommend using the ketchup bottle, it helped sooooo much Lol. But the breading was missing something. Could've been a little bit sweeter but overall it was great for my first time making these myself :p

loved it.  had to try several to get right temp.  Has to be quite brown to be a little crunchy and not mushy.  Added less flour and more sugar and vanilla like other people said.  It was fabulous!

Messy. Used hardly any flour and just plain sticky. Took so long to cook that most were burnt. Thanks for the recipe but i will try something else.

Fabulous! My sons, ages 14 & 17, made this as a surprise for me. I only got a few bites and the rest disappeared! It was just like on the boardwalk except better because the oil wasn't burnt and hadn't been sitting for hours having cooked 1000 cakes! It was a huge hit! Next time we are adding cinnamon and mini chocolate chips!

Totally most awesome and amazing. I cut the servings to six which then told me to use 1.5 eggs. Instead I used one egg and added two tablespoons of vanilla extract. I also added three tablespoons of cinnamon just for kicks. LOVED THIS!

I loved it! I made it today for my family after an early dinner and the kids cleaned the plate in like 2 mins!! This was so easy to make and is a sure fix for when you crave this famous amusement park/carnival treat. I did add the vanilla. To help my figure next time I think I will try and make some mini funnel cakes. Thank you for making my day.

We went to the Fair this past weekend and I've been dying to try to make Funnel Cakes - and I'm so glad I came across this recipe! It's pretty much PERFECT, with a few additions (a bit more sugar, some vanilla, and a bit of cinnamon). I used a squeeze bottle to pour the batter into the oil, and it was super easy and mess-free. It's important to make sure that your oil is HOT, or else you'll just end up with a gloppy, greasy mess :( This recipe makes quite a few funnel cakes - I made 3 plate-sized cakes and had a lot left over - so if you're only making it for 2, then cut the recipe in half. But extra is always good - now we can have funnel cakes again tomorrow :) Overall, a good and simple recipe for something that usually seems so complicated!

Giving it 4 stars because its kinda my own fault for not having the right equipment to make them.  I have no funnels or anything to help with it so used a measuring cup just poured it slowly.  Doesn't work out so well.  They were some funky shapes and some of it didnt get cooked evenly.  When I finally did get one done enough it was good.  This is like pancake batter except thinner.  I might try again in the future once I get some funnels.  :)  Its not as easy as it looks too.  I did burn myself once.  Ha.

I made these for our family's Independence Day celebration, and they were da bomb! Adults and children loved them! I followed the recipe to the letter, with only the addition of a dash of vanilla. Not sure it made a difference but everyone seemed to be recommending it. I made them in a wok on the side burner of the gas grill outside. It made for a fun activity and a delicious treat. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Good, the only thing i changed was that i added a bit of Vanilla extract which i do with almost all desserts whether they call for it or not :D Also I'm just not a fan of the funnel technique so i used a ziploc bag and cut off the corner.

These were delicious!  I used vanilla almond milk and egg whites and added a pinch of nutmeg.  I cooked these in my wok which also helped contain the batter from spreading. I drained on a wire rack then transferred to a paper towel to absorb any remaining oil. Simple, quick and easy.  Perfect surprise for #3 son after a fabulous job mowing the lawn. ;)

Tasted just like the carnival treat. Fried it in a skillet. I tried the ketchup bottle trick but my ketchup bottle was full. So I drank my orange juice and cut a hole in the lid and it worked well.

Wow! That came out great! Now, I do wish I had added Vanilla to it... I also followed the reveiws and cut the flour back. I didn't have a funnel, so I used a ziploc back. Otherwise, this was great! A must-keep.

Better than the ones at the county fair!!!  Plus, you know that things are clean!  I added a tsp of vanilla, and 1/2 cup less flour after reading other reviews.  I don't deep fry, as a rule, but we used the side burner on the grille outside to keep the mess out of the house. :) These were a big hit! :D

Well, I made this for my husband a couple weeks ago and now he keeps on wanting me to make it! That says it all! Your house will smell yummy all day too! Delicious and not that many ingredients. So easy. I did add Vanilla to the recipe just to add a little something and it is excellent!!!

This recipe was great! Especially for a first timer, although I did add a bit more sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla abstract for my taste. Other than that, very Delicious.

Make sure you pour the batter thick enough, too thin won't be good either!
Also, just so you know, i did a third of the recipe and it yielded for 3 fair sized funnel cakes. Plenty for two people! They're fried so it's not the lightest thing!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  I made a smaller batch thinking there was no way I could use all of that batter.  I was completely wrong...my small family of three at the small batch and the second batch I made using the original recipe!!

Very tasty!  I added some vanilla extract for a bit more flavor.  Instead of making big cakes I made "bites" that are about the size of donut holes and they are a hit sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon!

YUM! I've never made funnel cake before. This one turned out just like those at the beach. Crispy on the outside with just the right softness on the inside. I followed the directions exactly except for adding a little vanilla. I used whole milk - I'm not sure if that makes a huge difference or not since it's not specified what type but I know most of my baked goods come out better with whole milk. I also used canola oil which hopefully made it a little less unhealthy.   It would be a 5 star without the vanilla but I like the addition of it.   I used an empty lemon juice bottle to squirt it into the oil which worked really well. Make sure whatever you use has a big enough hole or else you'll wind up with really skinny strands which over crisp.

These were awesome.  I cut the receipe down to 4 serving size and fried them in a small 8 inch fry pan with vegetable oil.  I added a cap of vanilla to give a little extra flavor.  I used a water bottle with a sip cap to pour. Family and neighbors loved them and were amazed.

I have been wanting a funnel cake for 2 years. After finding that we're going to miss our carnival again, I thought i' d see how hard it would be to make our own. It was so easy and they tasted awesome! I cut the recipe in half and it still made eight. Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

I liked these funnel cakes! They were great and definitely something I would make again. They were crisp but chewy in all the right places. I dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon sugar. Thanks so much!

I loved this after I added vanilla and a bit of cinnimon to it.  The bigger the funnel opening the softer the cake, if your funnel is smaller your cake may be crunchy.

These are soooooooo good!  I added vanilla and probably doubled the sugar.  I didn't use any sort of funnel, just tried to pour a steady stream into the hot oil, so I had some consistency problems (some lumpy, chewy parts, some thin, crispy parts).  Nevertheless, my family gobbled them up in minutes!  But they're so easy, I could whip up a second batch before they knew it.

These were delicious and brought back so many memories of amusement parks and carnivals from when I was young.  It was a little difficult to get the right thickness and if I poured too fast, the funnel cake was very doughy and tough.  Operator error, though.  I just need more practice!

These were really easy and fun to make. It DOES make quite a bit. Would have been fun for a party. I had so many that I gave almost half away to my neighbor. I tried the funnel method first then I decided to put the batter into an old squeeze bottle as suggested. The squeeze bottle worked much better. Thanks for the recipe!

It's Fair Week and I drooled over their funnel cakes but decided to save money and make our own.  This recipe is excellent.  No changes other than adding a tablespoon or two of water to thin it out enough to flow through the funnel.  We ate some with syrup which made them taste just like waffles.  The kids loved it.

I thought it was great as is. We preferred adding a little vanilla to it, though. But as written (cut to 4 servings) it was great as well. Thanks!

Wonderful with added vanilla extract. I tried pouring the batter straight from the spout of the mixing bowl but got irregular fat areas. It worked out much better using a refillable squeeze bottle (opening about the size of a Q-tip head). So versatile because you can serve the cakes with any fresh fruit and whipped cream, preserve or just powdered sugar.

ToGreat recipe! I halved it because I was craving sugar and I didn't need to make so many. I used a pastry bag to drop the dough in the oil and I also replaced half of the flour with whole wheat flour just to add a lily nutritional value. Hey I tried! It actually came out great. Nice and crispy. I couldn't tell the difference.

Tastes just like the ones in the theme parks! It was so easy and quick to make! I did find that the batter was a little thick, so I just added a little more water so it would be easier to run through the funnel!

I could use some education on how to make it look as pretty as the pictures. I tried the ketchup bottle and went in a circular motion but it ended up a little too doughy & pancakish.  It tasted really good though so I still rated it a 5 b/c it's my fault it looked ugly!

This was a very good dish, if you wanted to feed your kids a not so sweet treat, make this. Though I wouldn't recommend using a funnel, it's very difficult to pour and "create" at the same time. There's no reason you should spend $6 on one funnel when you can make 30 for $10.

This is the best funnel cake recipe. It tastes just like what you eat at the Jersey shore! I did add 1tsp. of vanilla but other than that it is great!

I added extra vanilla as well. Cakes turned out very good. Still need practice on making them look right though.

This was an awesome recipe.  I tried a few before and I gave up wasting the ingredients.  This one was super easy and the funnel cakes came out better than the ones in the carnival.

I fix these at work and they really did enjoy them. We added strawberries, apples, blackberries, cherries and powdered sugar. I plan to make them for an event at the church. The kids will love them.

There were very good.  I used vanilla to taste, a little nutmeg, and a dash of cinnamon.    The consistency should be that of a thick pancake batter.    You should definitely use a ketchup bottle, funnel, or baggy with the corner cut out.  Pouring from a measuring cup makes them really flat.  They tasted just like the ones at the fair.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't own a funnel so I used a measuring cup and drizzled the batter into the oil that way. Worked just fine. These were super yummy! A keeper for sure.

These were great.  Very fluffy and flavorful.  Worked great.  I tried one of those premade mixes in a can to compare this recipe to.  By far this recipe beat it hands down.  The mix was greasy and not very flavorful so don't waste your time buying them.  Go for homemade.

I also added vanilla to this recipe.  It was lotsa fun.  Didn't take very long and I froze the remaining batter.  I also sprinkled it with cinnamon and powdered sugar. Watching the temperature ont he grease helps keep it fromj getting too crispy.  I'm thinking peanut oil would help as opposed to vegetable oil when frying.  Thanks!

Fantastic!!! Except I highly recommend scaling down the recipe to 1/3 the original size. That deduction made more than enough for 4 hearty eaters!

these were very good, although they don't seem as good as everyone else says. Also its easier to use a spoon to pour in the batter.

Alright, good; but would not make again.  Not worth the trouble or the mess; and honestly it doesn't bring my back to memories of the carnivals back in the US (I'm in Aust. now.)  Was really hoping for something that would come close to what those from the fairs were like; and this really doesn't make it.

A little boring.  Had to add a ton of sugar to get it to taste like anything.  If I make it again, I will have to add something, maybe vanilla, to give it some flavor.

I tried this recipe beacause I had never had a funnel cake before. when I did it, I must have done something wrong because it was great, but the aftertaste was not. Or maybe I just don't have a taste for funnel cakes. But the batter was just right, and the instructions were pretty good.

FLAT, FLAT, FLAT...this recipe did not turn out for me.  Followed exacted but the batter did not puff up even with the oil at the right temperature.  My funnel's hole was a bit small so next time I will use the other funnel cake recipe from this site and use the piping bag method without a tip (less mess).

Great recipe, light and fluffy like a funnel cake should be. Mi kids loved it. I don't need to go back to Navy Pear in Chicago to pay a lot to be able to enjoy a delicious funnel cake.

You really can't alter this recipe to make it better other than add vanilla. carefully poured the batter using a measuring cup, and it came out perfect.  Not only is it good with powdered sugar, but it is also great with cinnamon and sugar!

Excellent recipe, easy and so good!  Halfed the recipe and added flour a tablespoon at a time (took about 5 tablespoons to get right consistency. The only thing I was disappointed about was how the funnel cake turned out almost completely flat.  My beautiful circular design ran together and came out as a flat pancake with an interesting swirl design.  I will try using more oil next time (it doesn't mention how much so I used 1/4 cup) to see if it will float more and not be so flat.  As others mentioned, it may take a few tries to get the same look as the carnival. Never the less, the taste is the most important thing and these were delish!!

Really Yummy! We put ice cream (either chocolate or vanilla) and then put hot fudge and cool whip making a dreamy ice cream sunday funnel cake. Although it was really  messy.

this was pretty good...despite i didn't have baking soda and granulated sugar. so instead, i used confectioners(? can't spell right)sugar. still pretty good. the batter was too thick to go through a funnel so i used a plastic bag and cut the tip. my first one i burned it tho, but the second & third turned out fine.

i think the choice and proportions (i went with 4 servings instead of 12) of the ingredients was an excellent match to what i remember from the fair when i was little, absolutely great.  :)  now if i can just figure out how to keep an even temperature towards the edge of my skillet..  but even where i burnt it a little, it's hard to ruin something you pour sugar on top of.  ^_-  simple enough for me to make, and just plain good -- thanks.  :)

Came out pretty darn awesome! I found that it worked better when I added more milk to the batter (about 1/2  a cup) I also threw some powdered sugar in the battter (a few tablespoons) So it was a little sweeter.  Next time I'll reduce the flour,  and keep the same amount of milk.  Thanks!

Sooo good just like the ones at the amusement park but so much cheaper.  I could not believe how easy it was and how good they came out.  We are a family of six so with this recipe we each got two.  Delicious.  Thanks so much.  We topped ours off with ice cream and whip cream. Yummy.

This recipe is very good! Try putting a strawberry sauce and whip cream or vanilla ice cream on it for a desert. Tastes awesome!!

These are easy and fun to make. I've been opting to come home from the fairs this summer and make these at home instead. They're good for breakfast too!
