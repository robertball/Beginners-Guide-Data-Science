I used the juice of the asparagus in place of some of the water instead of discarding it.
This is a lite, delicious recipe.  
It's not just for summer, but makes a tasty and pretty holiday side dish.

My family has never let me live this one down.  To say the least, asparagus salad left quite an impression on all of them.  It has become the standard by which all new recipes are compared.  I like to try things that sound different, but this just was not for us.  Sorry.

I really didn't like this recipe.  It was very easy to make but just wasn't the taste that I was looking for.
