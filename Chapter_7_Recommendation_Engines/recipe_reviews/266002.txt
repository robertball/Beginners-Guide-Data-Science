This turned out good but the directions are not real clear. As written you would just put your peppers whole (stems and all) in the saucepan and simmer for 50 minutes. I did not see the point of this and I chopped mine. Also by chopping them, you can control the amount of heat with how many seeds you put in. I do not have a tomato mill so I just blended it all in the end.
