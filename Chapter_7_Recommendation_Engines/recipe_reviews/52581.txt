Don't really know why I tried this recipe since I am born and raised in sweden and should know my "pannkakor" but I did and it's not quite right. I really like my recipe better wich is basically changing the flour to 1 cup and take away an egg or two depending on size. I also usually substitute 1/3 of the flour to whole wheat flour. We also usually eat our pancakes with strawberry jam or other kind of jam. I make them in a 10 inch pan with low edges with a long spatula I bought at IKEA. Just use your wrist to turn the pan to spread the batter out. If it gets stuck just use som butter on the pan. This recipe can also be used as an oven pancake if you add some fried bacon pieces in an 9x13 bakingpan and bake in the oven at 450 for 25-30 min and serve with lingonberries.

To the skeptics--no need for extra flour, it is really supposed to be that thin!  I grew up eating Swedish Pancakes and this recipe is very good.  I think the recipe my great-grandmother brought from Sweden was something like: a bunch of eggs, then flour until it's thick, then milk until it's thin.  Not being the greatest cook, I need a more detailed recipe to follow.  This one definitely works.  
A helpful hint I learned from watching my mother make them: use a medium sized frying pan, when it's hot, hold it in your hand, pour a small amount of batter into the middle of the pan then use your wrist to turn the pan and swirl the batter around to make an even layer in the pan.  You don't need to use much batter--these pancakes are supposed to be very thin.

Ever since I first visited Rockford when I was five, I have loved the swedish pancakes we would get at the Stolkholm Inn. My first effort at making them was with this recipe (because it mentioned Rockford, so I hoped it would be great), and I would have to say, these are close. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very yummy and how I remember them to be.  Still looking for the secret ingredient to make them as magical as the Stockholm Inn's.

Excellent recipe.  I did add 1 tsp. of vanilla, I couldn't help myself.  I love these light, thin pancakes.  I whisk before I pour the batter each time.  This little bit of extra attention helps in keeping the batter consistent from first to last.  Delicious !!!

I tried the recipe using skim milk and real butter, sifted the flour before measuring and measured the butter after melting it. I used a preheated nonstick pan. I expected the batter to be runny, having made crepes many times over the years. My only concern was the butter that then congealed a bit in the  metal bowl, so I gently heated it on a burner and stirred with a wisk. You have to be patient with this recipe and not try to mess with the edges of the pancake until they begin to pull away from the pan or until the very edge begins to brown a bit. I had my pan on a bit high, so they didn't quite look like the IHOP ones I love, but they tasted awesome! I was able to work a silicone spatula under them to the middle and flip them without cutting. When done, I folded them in quarter and put them on a plate in a 170 degree oven until I got all of them made. I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and heated apricot jam. Do I plan on keeping this recipe? Heck yes! I'm going to try it next time with vanilla or maybe try the OJ suggestion too for a change. However, the recipe is really great as is. The right tools will help keep the frustration at a minimum.

If you've got a temp gauge on your griddle, it should be about 380.  That makes them cook a little faster, but any pancake recipe is going to have you standing over the griddle for a while.  Try a fun way my dad used to feed us all at once, we had a square pan, he'd fill it, and cut and make square pncakes.  He could make enough to eat for him, me and my two brothers until the next batch was ready.

Good recipe! good alternative for carb counters.  Good for savory pancakes too; roll pancakes filled with grated colby cheese and finely chopped onions and bake 350* for 10-15 min. Serve with either fresh salsa or sausage gravy - delicious!

I've never made Swedish pancakes before or eaten them before but I thought these were very good.  After I made a few I got the hang of it.  I think they just need to cook longer than you'd expect for something so thin.  They didn't seem to burn easily so I left them cook on the first side until they were very easy to turn.  I'll probably make these again soon because they are a nice change from regular pancakes.  Great recipe!

I used a small buttered nonstick frying pan since I don't have an electric skillet.   There was no need to cut the pancake before turning it because of it's smaller size. Topped with fresh blackberries and blueberries warmed in the microwave with a little bit of sugar and a sliced banana. Delicious!

These were delicious, but I did add extra four after reading some reviews.  I know they're supposed to be thin, so I decided to do more research.  We are fans of Al Johnson's restaurant in Door County (northern Wisconsin).  I looked up his recipe and it follows.  I think I will try it next time:  
2 eggs, 1 scant cup of milk, 2/3 c all-purpose flour, 2 t sugar
 1/4 t salt  1 T oil or melted butter, 1/4 t nutmeg.  
In a small bowl, beat the eggs with a wire whisk. Mix in the flour and a little of the milk to make a paste, stirring until smooth.  Add the rest of the milk and the remaining ingredients.
 
Preheat a large non-stick skillet to medium-high heat.  Pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet, and quickly tilt the pan to spread it into a thin circle.  Bake it until the top surface appears dry.  Flip the pancake and bake it for another 15 to 20 seconds, or until it is golden brown.

The pancakes may be stacked and held in a warm oven until served.  If a non-stick skillet is not used, it may be necessary to lightly oil the skillet between each pancake. 
 
Roll or fold each pancake and serve with lingonberries.   The batter may be made an hour ahead or even the night before.  The recipe makes 8 large pancakes, (two servings).

This recipe is awesome! I'm originally from Rockford, IL and have been craving Swedish pancakes from Stockholm Inn.  I was worried the batter was too thin, but just be patient and let it cook (it takes longer than a typical pancake) before you cut and flip it.  I found a jar of Lingonberries from Ikea, and the combination tasted just like Stockholm Inn.

I too was raised in Rockford, IL. and miss going to Stockholm Inn for Swedish pancakes. On a recent visit my sister made that the #1 priority. This recipe is excellent and comes very close to what I remember from my early years in Rockford....now if only I could find lingonberry sauce here in the deep south. This is a great recipe.
  After making this recipe several times I finally found buckwheat flour. Now I substitute maybe just 2 TBLS of the all-purpose flour with the buckwheat flour. Makes this recipe perfect.  If you can find packaged Swedish pancake mix FROM Sweden such as Lunds you'll find all the good ones include buckwheat flour or malted barley flour.

I make Swedish Pancakes all the time, and thought I'd try this recipe...  This is by far, the worst, most tasteless recipe I've found for Swedish pancakes.  This recipe is nothing more than a recipe for scrambled eggs with flour.  YUCK!!!

Excellent recipe!  To add a special touch that will make these irresistable, try substituting 1/2 cup of milk with a 1/2 cup of orange juice. This is the secret you have been missing!

This recipe caught my eye because of the title.. Easy Swedish Pancakes.  In my opinion, making Swedish Pancakes is VERY easy.. lol.  This is an excellent recipe.  I've made it twice, first time exactly as written, second time with my own twist which my family preferred.  I used 1 cup of flour instead of 1/2 - I also sifted mine, which made the batter very smooth and allowed it to cook evenly.  I increased the milk to 2 1/4 cups.. to make up for the extra flour and that seemed just right.  We like our Swedish Pancakes with a bit more complexity than egg and the addition of that bit of extra flour and milk really makes a nice taste difference.  The egg amounts are perfect.  Excellent recipe and thanks for sharing this great recipe!  P.S.  Note to self.. I really need to travel to Illinois and go check out this Stockholm Inn place.. I wonder if they know they are "famous" here.  :)

I come from a Swedish town, famous for our Swedish festival and pancakes. This recipe isn't the best I've had, but it is simple and does the job of satisfying my Swedish pancake cravings. (I's much tastier made with half and half if you have some on hand.) Oh and as a side note, these pancakes are supposed to runny!!! Do not fret, they gel together nicely while cooking.

This is the worst recipe I've tried off of this wonderful site. I consider myself pretty skilled in the kitchen, and these were terrible! I followed the directions exactly and all I ended up with was a big mess. I love Swedish pancakes, I've had them many times, and I've had them in Sweden while on vacation...these were a sorry excuse for Swedish pancakes. Sorry to be so negative, but what a waste.

Thank you so much, Kari! My great-grandparents came from Sweden and my grandma cooked these for me. I learned from her how to twirl the pan so they would be lacy and crisp around the edges, and though she served them rolled with ordinary jam or jelly, I prefer lingonberry jam now that it is available from Ikea. These are real Swedis pancakes (tunna pannkakor) to me, not the little pancakes in the special pans.

My mom used to make these as a special treat for me every now and then. Eating them again took me back to those days. I don't think they were exactly the same measurements as my mom used, but they were close enough. I had no trouble with them on my non stick skillet. The hardest part was being patient enough to wait for them to cook before turning them. After that wait I couldn't wait to cook them all to eat them, so I ate my first 4 at the stove while the next 4 cooked. :)

I made this slightly differently, 1/2 a cup less milk and 1 less egg and 1/4 cup more flower, still made a very thin pancake. I also added vanilla. Just a dash. Just like grandma used to make.

Wow! Rockford made famous for the Swedish pancakes. I grew up and lived in Rockford for 38 years and yes it is very Swedish. We no longer live in Rockford, but when we visit we have to have a taste of the pancakes. I have the same recipe that another reviewer has called "Alice's Swedish Pancakes" and we are making them today to bring in the new year. Love them. Great to hear from a fellow Rockfordian.

I feel really bad saying this but EWW! I also am a Rockford Illinois native and maybe it's just me but these are not at all what I'm used to. I've eaten at the Stockholm as well as eaten my Mom's awesome Swedish pancakes for years and these were just nothing like what I've had. 
My mom passed away young five years ago and I never had a chance to get a recipe from her for Swedish Pancakes (although I know she always just sort of threw in a little of this and a little of that). I have been craving these forever and when I saw a fellow Rockford native I was sure these would be the ones!
I really don't know how much of this falls on me having never made them before as they were a pain to make for sure. What we ended up with was mostly just a congealed egg looking mess. And they didn't taste any better than they looked. We ended up having to just add other stuff in attempt to make more regular pancakes because what we were getting from this recipe just wasn't edible.
I do thank you for posting the recipe as I see it has been enjoyed by many. For me though I'll have to keep looking.

Loved it! It took me awhile to get the temperature of my pan right without burning them, but they came out great in the end.

So easy and delicious!!  Thank-you for this recipe :) I've been searching for a recipe like this, my Norwegian Grandma used to make them. So  many recipes make the batter so thin that the pancakes are too delicate to turn over and this one is just right. I added a bit of vanilla too but I've made them both ways and either way they're perfect!

I too am from Rockford, IL and I have to say, these are spot-on with the Swedish pancakes I grew up eating at home and at the Stockholm Inn.  My favorite topping is Smuckers boysenberry syrup.  I love them so much, they are even outstanding plain.  For a healthier recipe, low-fat or skim milk can be used, as well as light butter and/or a 50% egg substitution with Egg Beaters.  Be careful not to make too many subsitiutions at once though, or the consistency of your pancakes will suffer.  Enjoy these; they are not to be missed!

I made two batches. The first was chunky and way too thick but tasted fine. The second was perfect! Be sure to mix the batter well with fully melted butter, and make sure to pour a THIN layer onto the griddle. They should be about as thin as a quarter.

As many of the others mentioned, there is something very wrong with this recipe. They turned out like a thin crepe that never really cooked through. Big mess. I grew up with Swedish pancakes cooked by real Swedes. These were not those.

This is a regular in our weekend breakfasts.  The only change we do, is to use white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.

AMAZING!!!

These come out looking great, but they are flabby on the inside.  I tried turning down the heat so they could cook longer and heat through more, but these thin pancakes tasted too watered down.

This is a pretty good recipe for Swedish pancakes, however my recipe from my Swedish Great Grandmother includes just a touch of vanilla extract as well.  We serve ours with butter and either powdered sugar or cinnamon and sugar. Takke!

This is the most accurate yet easy recipe for Swedish pancakes that I've been able to find. (I'm also from near Rockford)  Swedish pancakes are supposed to be really thin, like crepes, and this recipe gives the right consistency.  Traditionally, they are served with lingonberries, powdered sugar and butter.    You can also make them savory with other toppings, for dinner.  You might want to cut down on the sugar in the batter, though.

Wonderful pancakes and easy to make  - except for my family who paced around waiting until I cooked enough to serve.  Next time I will use 2 or 3 frying pans.  I brought home some Lingonsylt (lingenberry jam) from Stockholm which made the pancakes wonderful!    I grew up eating my grandmother's Swedish pancakes and these are "eggier" than I remember.  I was in Stockholm last last week (June 2010) and these are definitely eggier than the Swedish pancakes I ate there every morning. I tried using extra flour (3/4 cup) but then they were a bit too "cakie".  Next time I will try reducing to 3 eggs leaving all else the same.

My family and I LOVE Swedish Pancakes, and pretty much use this same recipe, HOWEVER I always add a splash of REAL vanilla to give it more flavor and the kids LOVE it, and can tell when I get in a hurry and forget the vanilla.  I make in a blender and just pour it out into the skillet (on the stove, not an electric skillet)...VERY easy, plus some eath them plain with Peanut butter, other like fruit and some just good ol maple syrup.

Delicious. Thought that at first, it would turn out like the crepes that I always make from the "Basic Crepes" recipe on AllRecipes, but it turned out to be a little more spongy of a texture and unique.

This recipe turned out awesome.  Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I only used 2 eggs and upped the flour to 1 cup.  I also added vanilla.  Turned out great!

Scrambled eggs with a hint of flour - I did not care for this recipe! These came out terrible and are honestly the first recipe I've ever given less than 3 stars to. Make half the recipe first so you don't waste your ingredients if you decide to see for yourself.

I grew up on these because my grandmother would make them for me every Sunday.  I agree with the member that added the vanilla though and sometimes a hint of cinnamon.  Grandma did not use sugar but did add the vanilla.  On the holidays for a really fun idea, instead of the milk, we would use an equal amount of eggnog it is a really kicked up flavor that way.  My favorite was to put grape jelly or strawberry jam and roll them up.

Not great.  These were way too eggy and had no substance while cooking.  They kept falling apart and didn't cook evenly.  I added some flour to my batter, which helped with the texture and kept it together.  The overall flavour was not to my liking - won't make again.

Love these Swedish Pancakes. I grew up in Roscoe, IL so I've been to the Swedish House in Rockford and had the pleasure of their pancakes.  I just added a bit of vanilla and these pancakes tasted just like home.

I liked them! This was my first time making Swedish pancakes, but the recipe looked easy enough that I decided to give it a try. I don’t have an electric skillet, so I used a small non-stick frying pan & just turned them whole with the spatula. I followed the recipe with the substitutions of gluten-free flour and non-fat milk. Ate some with orange marmalade, ate some with maple syrup, and wished I had some cheese so I could try some like blintzes. I think these would go with anything. In fact, we pared them with spiced honey wine tonight :)

This is also delicious if you add fresh chopped apple to the batter before cooking, sprinkle the cooked pancake with fresh lemon juice, fold it over, and sprinkle the top with powdered sugar.

I made these according to the recipe and they make a nice, thin Swedish pancake. I've also made them with one less egg and the result is almost the same. Make sure you spread the batter out by tilting the pan in a circular motion, shaking the an slightly, and make sure the pan is hot enough otherwise your first few pancakes will come out a mess.

Once I figured out how to finally cook these, I fell in love with them!  I recommend cooking them in an electric skillet on medium low (325 F) for 6 minutes on each side.  That is enough time to allow them to set and then all you have to do is cut them into rectangles with the spatula and flip them.  So easy!

These were excellent... I used whole wheat flour for an even better flavor. And I put in the 1/2 cup of the flour, plus about 3 Tbsp more. The butter wasn't added to the batter, I put the butter in my stainless skillet (over medium heat) each time before new batter went in for another pancake. My friends from Sweden showed me how to make these a few weeks back, this recipe is pretty close to the real deal!

These are a great different pancake from "normal" American pancakes.  I noticed if I put more batter in the pan then I would think to put in, I can flip them so much easier.  Will definetely make these again and maybe double the recipe, for 5 people 1 batch isn't enough! :)

I moved to Colorado about 5 years ago from ILL and I really miss the Stockholm Inn in Rockford and the swedish pancakes. Everytime I visit I make a point to go there and eat. when I found this recipe it was the closest thing I have had to the sweedish pancakes I remember. I now make them every saturday for my boyfriend and I as he has fallen in love with them as well!

This was an ok recipe. I used 2 eggs, 1 cup of flour, a dash of salt, 2 tsp butter, added a tsp of vanilla and omitted the sugar. Fold them into quarters or roll into tubes when they come out of the pan, don't cut them. I smear the inside with sour cream and then the outside with strawberry jam. Fresh strawberries are great too!

My Dad passed this recipe on to me and I've been making them for my family since they were babies! I do add Cinnamon for flavor as this is a family favourite. I drop them in rounds on the grill...this makes it easy and fun for all my little people to gobble them up! We usually have a race to see who can eat the most. One of my all time favourite recipes!

It tastes more like scrambled eggs than pancakes, making the combination with sweet toppings less than appetizing. I've tried much better swedish pancake recipes on allrecipes.com than this one. Pass.

Fantastic! I recall the days my Grandma would whip up her "Finnish" pancakes as we would call them. The recipe never left in print because she could whip them up by memory. Thank you for sharing thsi delightful recipe!

I made these exactly as written, and the batter was a mess when I tried to cook it.  I added another 1/2 cup of flour and then it was perfect.  I don't understand the instructions to cook, then cut up and flip, so I just cooked these, one by one, like crepes on my 8-inch skillet.  Then spread lingonberry jam on them (from IKEA), rolled them up, dusted with powdered sugar and ate them.  Very tasty and good!!

These come the closest to the ones my mom used to make, except hers were basically eggs and milk with enough flour stirred in to equal the consistency of heavy cream.  Sprinkle them with sugar, roll them up and eat out of hand.  They're great.

These were wonderful!! They reminded me of the Finnish pancakes my family used to make when I was a child. The batter is perfect as is and does not need extra flour. I cooked mine on my stove top in an 8" small non stick frying pan over medium heat and it made about 12 perfectly round pancakes. I then stacked them with layers of wax paper in between each one till they were ready to serve. Also 1 minute to a minute and 30 seconds per side was all they needed. I spead raspberry preserves on some of mine and then rolled them up, and they were soooo tasy!! I highly recomend this pancake recipe.

Great and easy recipe.  I saw many reviews split between 1/2 cup and 1 cup flour, so I tried 3/4 cup and it was great.

I grew up eating Swedish Pancakes and couldn't wait to try this easy recipe....I kept adding more and more flour - up to another full cup.  I like the idea of making one giant pancake and cutting it as the previous review suggested.  That would help because this batter is so runny.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I had to add a lot more flour.  (I know the batter is supposed to be thinner, but this was nuts).  I wound up with a plate of mush.  I will definitely keep looking for a good pancake recipe.

Wonderfully easy - light - veristal
big hit with the kids and adults
kind of an omelet/pancake marriage

I like also with cheese and cilantro for a tex mex flair,  depending on the mood.

This recipe was delicious! i doubled the recipe as I have a large family of boys, so I used 3 cups of milk and 1 cup of french vanilla coffee creamer (I ran put of milk), and also added 2 tbsp of vanilla--and these were amazing!! Thanks much for the recipe!! Definitely adding this to the brunch rotation! :)

Growing up in Canada with parents who were born and raised in Holland these are the pancakes that we grew up on.  Didn't know that they were considered Swedish, thought they were Dutch! I use a bit more flour (about 1 cup) and 3 eggs. These were always served with brown or white sugar.

Could someone please clarify this for me? What does it mean to "Cut into 2 or 4 sections, and flip with a spatula."? Do I literally cut the pancake in 2 or 4 wedges while it is in the skillet  before flipping it? The pancakes in the photo do not look like they have been cut to wedges. Thank you.

Sorry I haven't made this so I gave it an average rating. I can not submit my question if I don't rate.

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site, I've used it many times. I follow the recipe exactly and get perfect crepes every time. They are crisp on the edges from the sugar, they are buttery (yes it congeals, either mix before each scoop or get your milk and eggs room temp). By far one of the best crepes I've ever had!

Had to say this did not work out at all for me. The batter was WAY too thin. I know Swedish pancake batter should be thin, but not this thin. It was literally like water with lumps of flour in it. I tried using it but the first pancake I made was impossible to work with, even with a brand new non-stick pan. I have another Swedish Pancake recipe that I have used many times, just figured this one would be pretty much the same so I didn't bother to go dig the other one out of the recipe files. I will continue to use it instead of this one on Allrecipes. It calls for 1.5 cups of flour, 3 eggs, 2 cups milk, pinch of salt, 3 Tablspns. of sugar, 2 Tblspns. melted butter. I make sure to sift the flour (makes all the difference in the world) before adding to the milk and eggs. Also, make sure to use a non-stick pan, I don't have any luck otherwise. Works great, tastes wonderful.

My mother is Swedish, and when making pancakes for us each week she would use basically the same recipe but with more flour.  When I followed the recipe the mixture was too thin based on past experience, so I increased the flour to the desired consistency.  This made the pancakes more substantial (better for our three teenage boys!) and easier to handle in the pan.  When the boys have grown up and leave home we will reduce the flour to the amount recommended by the recipe!

I add another 1/2 cup of flour less if you use whole milk, it's supposed to be thin but not watery. I also add a splash of vanilla, I use only 2 or 3 eggs depending on size. Mix it in a blender works great for smoothness of the batter and for pouring. It is good to let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes to let the flour absorb the wet ingredients and thicken a bit. Use a buttered pan and pour a small amount, like a 1/4 cup (I have done this so many times I can eyeball it now,) in the pan and swirl like making a crepe. It's ok if it swirls up the sides of the pan a bit. Cook these on a high medium eat and they will only take a few minutes to cook. Let them get some brown on them but not all over. You really don't need to flip them they are thin enough they cook through. I put jam on them while they are in the pan then fold them up to serve.

Another Swedish Rockfordian heard from! These taste perfect! They are supposed to be more like a crepe' and VERY thin. Adding more flour would ruin the eggy texture. Just a tad too much batter in the pan and they wont turn out.Swirl the pan to make sure it is distributed evenly. Also, after melting the butter to add to the batter, make sure it is cooled otherwise you will get a scrambled egg mess. Hot butter will cook the egg! Sometimes I add vanilla sometimes cinnamon, but always lingonberry jam on top! Tak sa micket Kari!(also my Swedish little sister's name!)  :)

Delicious! Was visiting my daughter and she didn't have all the ingredients needed for pancakes and i wanted to use the blueberries we bought. I hunted for a recipe without baking powder and stumbled on this. I love it! Saved it and will be using it!

I'm also from Rockford and amazed that our hometown favorite has made it to allrecipes. It's worth sharing & was in our newspaper in 1976 - that's how I found it. Fantastic recipe, was called "Alice's Swedish Pancakes" from the Swedish cook whose recipe this was. She packed the restaurant FULL daily. Some other places here have tried to use cheaper versions of this, using  ingredients, but this recipe is heavenly. I use my blender to mix this recipe, then I use 1 Tbs of butter to a skillet on a medium flame. Will burn easy so watch closely. I use one (soup) ladle full of batter poured into pan, then immediately TILT pan so you end up with a thin crepe. Then keep folding lightly toward center of pan while cake cooks. Also, adding a frozen or fresh blueberries makes this recipe even better, my son taught me that. If batter seems too thin with frozen berries, just blend a couple more Tbs of flour into batter. Yum!

Swedish pancakes are a favorite of mine. Stockholm Inn served the best we've ever had but these are close and easier to make.

I grew up with grandparents and manhy relatives who lived in Rockford.  My entire family LOVES! the Stockholm Inn and their glorious swedish pancakes.  When we visit, the restaurant is the first and last place we hit.  This recipe is as close as you can get to the real thing at home!

These were great except I had some little chunks from the flour and melted butter.  Maybe I will use a blender to make the batter next time. BTW, the person who put them in the oven, try looking up a recipe for German pancakes - I think that is what you are trying to make.  These are more like crepes.

I decided to try these to have a change from regular pancakes. After reading the reviews I added 1 cup of flour, added vanilla and did not put in the butter. I would have been way too "eggy" had I not added the extra flour. I used an 8 inch omelet pan which took a little time, but they turned out great. I will make these again.

These were wonderful and just like at the Stockholm Inn in Rockford, Ill. I had trouble flipping them but pieces of these are better than none at all. I could care less if they look pretty. It's that they taste good that matters!

Want to get slumber party kids in bed on time? Tell them if you don't hear them past 10, you'll have enough energy to make these. (Or Waffles with ice cream.)I really like the idea of using a large skillet and splitting it up. I cooked on about 325 and it went plenty fast for me. Here are some things I did in cooking and presenting: mixed in a blender, used a gravy separator to pour into skillet (kept bubbles on top). I created my own topping by blending defrosted berries (fresh is better but out of season), sour creme and some sugar. I'd guess about 1/2 cup berries with 1/2 cup sour creme and 2 Tbs of powdered sugar. Do as you will... just makes a yummy filling. Add extra berries on the side with powdered sugar and you're set! Hmmm wonder how these would go with ice cream?

I loved this recipe. I altered it. I used 3 eggs instead of 4, 1 cup of flour instead of half a cup. I too, couldn't resist not adding vanilla. LOL. I made them like crepes. My husband made our daughter ones with Brown sugar and syrup. These were really wonderful. They are going into my rotation of recipes!

Yum! I never really made pancakes until I started feeding my boyfriend, I've been trying a new recipe every time. Let's just say I'm done looking for the perfect pancake recipe, Be forewarned, they may be thin, but they pack a filling punch!

The recipe is simple, healthier than crepes, and just the way my husband remebers his grandmother making them!  It took a few tries to get the timing right on turning them.  Also, the batter needed stirring to keep the pancakes consistent.  I added the vanilla, too. My 2 year old couldn't get enough!

I make this recipe everytime my kids or grandkids come.  I grew up eating these, we called them flapjacks.  We are german, all I know is that they are the best and my kids love them. Some of my grandkids call them crepes, but I will always call them flapjacks as my parents and grandparents did.

These turned out perfectly. made the recipe exactly as written and used my large, rectangular shaped griddle and they came out just like the ones I've had st Al Johnson's Swedish restaurant in Sister Bay, Wisconsin.   Served with real maple syrup. Will definitely make them a regular item in the breakfast rotation. The leftovers kept well refrigerated in a ziploc bag and reheated later.

I LOVE THESE PANCAKES! Easier and fluffy as making my souffle pancakes without having  to beat the egg whites. I modified:  added 2 T of ground flax for fiber and moisture, used 2 T sugar and reduced milk to 3/4 cup, used 1 T grapeseed oil for the butter because ran out of butter. For room temp eggs I put them in small bowl with warm water for few minutes. I didn't cut them, just browned well and easy to flip as one for a 10" sided skillet.  Smeared each with apricot preserves, folded in half and devoured BOTH OF THEM! Be adventurous and creative with these recipes!

I used a teaspoon of honey instead of sugar because I don't have any.  The batter is really thin, but it does work. Filling the entire bottom of a very non-stick pan and letting it set until it can slide around makes a flippable pancake. My first one got a little messed-up, but the second one held together fine with nice light brown spots. These are very thin, slightly chewy, tasty pancakes that taste like blintzes when rolled up with fruit syrup on top. Thanks for my new pancake recipe!

There is too much egg in this recipe. There is not enough other flavors besides egg. It was difficult to flip even with non-stick spray.

I’m not Swedish but I’m thinking of going there after eating this dish! I followed the recipe exactly and I added fresh strawberries inside with a little syrup on top! I will try other ingredients next time and see if I can find my favorite.

They tasted good, but I don't know how you are suppose to turn them over, roll them or do anything but dump them in a pile on the plate.    It was like trying to make a water pancake.   I did finally add more flour.     My crepes are just as thin but they hold together and easy to flip.

No they are excellent just the way they are. Neither my wife or I like thick hot cakes so these Swedish pancakes are perfect.
Also the electric skelet is a huge help. I’m always making recipes from your site and taking pictures but I forget to send them to you,sorry. Thanks for everything.

I will definitely make this again.  For those wondering if it works with gluten free flour:  YES!   I made half a recipe and it made 7 pancakes.  I prefer mine not sweet so I left out the sugar and doubled the salt.  My family loved them.

“Easy” is not a good word for this recipe  as it requires a deft hand at cooking them.  I tried two different skillets, a 9” nonstick and a 12”.  The 12” ,of course, made a lacier and thinner product, like a French crepe.  
I was born in Rockford, Illinois and we called them Norwegian Pancakes!  My grandmother made these as a special treat.  Lingonberries were hard to come by and we had them with strawberries.  This recipe tastes like  and is like the one I remember.

I followed the recipe as written and both my husband and I loved it! I didn't even tell him what it was until after he had eaten it. He is 2nd generation Swede, so I thought I would surprise him. After reading the reviews, the only thing I did was to cook them in a non-stick frying pan on the stove. The trick is to only put enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Then when I thought it was close to flipping, I would loosen around the edges to make sure it was ready.  I flipped it and let it cook for another 2 or 3 minutes, and then it would slide right out of the pan. The first side would take about 5 to 7 minutes to cook. The trick is to just be patient!

I made these today.  I sometimes make crepes.  These are more delicate and tender than crepes.  They take about twice as long to cook.  I also fried mine in butter, about 2 tea. per pancake, not trusting the non-stickness of my skillet.  I liked the added flavor of the butter.  These were delicious.  I had made a cherry topping for them, and I think that overwhelmed the flavor of the pancakes.  I will make these instead of crepes from now on!  Also, only a light topping is needed.  Taking a cue from IHOP, I think a composed butter made of butter and a fruit jam or preserves is enough flavor for garnish.  (3 parts butter, 1 part jam or preserves; sprinkle with powdered sugar and let a dollop melt on top of the hot pancakes for serving).

I made this as written and it was a mess. Maybe there’s a learning curve to making them because they are so thin. I ended up adding a 1/2 cup flour to try to save all the ingredients and it worked. That being said, they ended up like crepes. 
So I think it takes a bit of patience and practice.

I have been making Swedish Pancakes for about forever and my kids LOVE them....I make my batter and allow it to rest for about 20 minutes before I cook them, it make them insanely tender.  My grandmother always used a knife to flip hers...I use the long IKEA spatula that I use for almost everything...

I have a recipe for these called Norwegian Pancakes from almost 40 years ago, exactly the same ingredients and cooking method lol. They are great though I left them whole and filled them like crepes with custard, ice cream and topped with fruit and whipped cream.

Ridiculously hard to make! No structure or density to flip. Falls apart before i could figure out how to get my spatula under it to flip or just to get it off the griddle. Cooks like an omelette  but harder to work.

Followed exact recipe. Taste is ok. They definitely came out more like very flat crepes instead of what I’m used to as traditional Swedish pancakes. I was in a hurry and had a late night craving so the headline made me curious to try. Not my favorite but not terrible.

I made the pancakes as directed by the recipe and had a difficult time flipping the pancake in my well buttered pan. I added flour- doubling it to the remainder of the batch, which made it easier to work with. (All other Swedish pancake recipes that I have tried in the past have had more of a 1 flour to 2 milk ratio and I have never had trouble flipping the  pancakes so i felt confident with my addition). I didn’t notice a difference in flavor between the two batches, though the thinner batter made slightly crispier pancakes. This recipe was ok, not my favorite. I guess I like my pancakes to have a little more egg and butter and a little less milk.

I loved this recipe and have made it a few times now. I made the whole recipe and saved the batter in a Tupperware bowl in the fridge to enjoy throughout the week. Making 2 a day the batter lasted about a week. Heavenly every single time! Make sure you pour a decent amount of batter in pan otherwise too thin to flip w out tearing. I Loved the suggestion to wait till it looks dry before flipping. I also took about 1 tbsp of cold butter and hand mixed it w one tbsp of red raspberry jam to make that signature pink butter to put on top. Doesn't even need syrup w that butter because so sweet w jam in it. I tried sifting flour in when mixing ingredients and that did help w having less clumps.  Overall GREAT recipe! THx

I don't understand what I did wrong. I can't flip the pancakes. This is the second time I have tried and failed to make pancakes for my Swedish boyfriend. At this point I don't think I will ever be able to do it.

My Grandma was from Sweden and she just threw it together without measuring the ingredients. My Mom gave me approximate measurements but I cant find it. This recipe was very close.  A couple of tips from how my Grandma made them.  Do not use a mixer.  Mix by hand.  I use a whisk.  I had small eggs so I added one.   I added about 1/4 cup flour.  I remember possibly a touch of nutmeg can also be added. Be generous with the butter while cooking them.  Use real butter. I like them a little brown and crispy on the edges.  I used an electric rectangular skillet this time so I was able to cook 3 at a time. It's one of those recipes best cooked and served right when taken out of the skillet.  You can roll them but if you like them crispy like me, I eat them flat.  Serve with real maple syrup.   Lingonberries are traditionally served on them or on the side.  My Grandma used to give us a little vanilla ice cream on the side with the last one as a special treat when we were kids.   Also, someone said 380 degrees was about right and I agree. And someone said to stir between batches placed in the skillet and I agree.

I cut the recipe in half and increased the flour to 1 cup.  This made about 10 medium size crepes.

This was so easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it's perfect! Thank you for posting!  I grew up in Rockford, Il. too!! I moved away at 17 to Florida. So to find a good Swedish Pancake has been hard! Growing up my best girlfriends family would always make these pancakes and this is so close to what I remember hers to be like!! Thanks!! Michelle

Thank you! I've lost my mother's recipes including the Swedish pancake recipe (I'm also from Rockford) and this is so very close. Bless you for posting it AND including the city because it truly caught my eye. I've loved these pancakes since I was a child, eating them both at home and at the restaurants. Bless you again for returning a piece of my mother and my childhood to me.

I'm not Swedish and didn't have my first Swedish pancake until recently, so I may not be the best judge about the authenticity of this recipe. But is was delicious! There is no chemical leavening and very little flour, so the pancakes turn out custardy instead of fluffy. I cut the recipe in half and had enough batter for two big pancakes. Instead of cutting and rolling as shown in the photo (not wild about that presentation), I folded it in thirds like a classic  omelette and served it with blueberry syrup and butter. Folding instead of cutting and over-handling means you preserve that lovely custard quality the pancake has right out of the pan. I would make this again!

What a coincidence that I do a search for this type of recipe and the first one I go to is from someone who is also from Rockford. :)  The only trouble with these is deciding on a topping.

I think I just need some more practice with how much batter to use, how high to do the heat, flipping them, etc. Probably should have stirred up the batter each time I poured it.

Thank you Kari for this recipe. Me and my family love these pancakes. I used all the same ingredients and followed the directions to a T. The only thing I changed were the measurements for the ingredients: 7 eggs, 3 C milk, 2 C flour, 2 pinch of salt, 2 Tbl of sugar, 4 Tbl. Of melted butter. Cooked in two frying pans over medium heat for about a minute each on each side. Makes plenty, and left overs are still good refrigerated, which the kids love to eat as a snack later on. Thx again. God bless

I really liked this recipe, but I did use Silk vanilla soy milk.  I, also use a preserve from Clearbrook farms apricot flavor, warmed up with a bit of water to thin the consistency.  Not sure which of these changes made these so good, but they were yummy.  I, also agree about letting the mixture sit for a bit, my flour was lumpy and I had to beat it a lot.

I have used this recipe as my go-to recipe of choice.  The pancakes are supposed to be thin, but light in texture.  The only change I made was to add 2/3 cup flour instead of 1/2.  I add a bit of nutmeg to the batter and they are perfect!  Serve with lingonberry sauce and these are better than any IHOP can do!!

This is a great recipe/alternative to crepes, if you are gluten free.  It only takes 1/2 cup flour which can be easily replaced. My family loves them and they are requested every year for our annual 4th of July boat trip.  I just cook them ahead of time and serve with fruit and yogurt.

Just made these for the first time.  I loved them! I like others added some vanilla to the batter but did NOT add extra flour.  The batter does seem very runny but cooks perfect! I topped them with some Lingonberry jam that I heated up with some butter and real maple syrup.  These are now my favorite thin pancakes.  My two year old and husband (both picky) also loved them!!

I grew up with these pancakes.  My fav as a kid--now my own kids favorite breakfast.  I add 1 to 1 1/2 c. flour (1/2 c is just not enough).  Fantastic!

Being a beginner cooker as I am,  I could not for the life of me make these. So not knowing what to do with the batter, I decided I would make them how my dad does, and tosses them in a 9X13 pan and put them in the oven. I put them on the third rack and waited till they were bubbly, then raised them up a couple of racks and waited for them to brown.  Probably a great recipe if I could do it right!

With a few impro's, these become Dutch pancakes! I make the pancakes following the recipe, but the dutch thing is to throw in slices of cooked sausage in the batter when it is cooking in the pan. Serve with maple syrup- delicious! My grandma made them all the time!

way more "eggy" tasting than the ones my mom would make.  Also seemed to be extremely sensitive to the heat level (the spectrum between "burning" and "not cooking fast enough" was very small).

Rockford, IL is my hometown. I live in California now, but Swedish pancakes are a favorite when I go back to visit. Craving them, I tried this recipe and it's fabulous. My husband said they were the best he'd ever eaten! I made it with light vanilla flavored soy milk, and increased the flour a tad bit. Thanks for a great recipe!

Sorry, but these did not taste good at all.  Maybe I just had the wrong idea about swedish pancakes--I guess I was expecting it to taste more like a crepe---but it really had no taste at all.  But then again, I'm not the most fabulous cook in the world and it could be partly my fault.

I thought the flavor of these pancakes was very good and they were easy to stir up, however, I had difficulty cooking them.  The batter is very thin and difficult to flip...had to add just a little more flour and that helped a lot.  I also added just a touch of vanilla.  I  have made them several times and the family thinks they are "Great" and a delicious change from the regular pancakes we makes.

Flour amount is right on for  Swedish pancake as the batter is much thinner than a normal pancake.I switched out some of the flour for buckwheat flour to get a more traditional Swedish pancake taste.
