I'm not a bisquick fan, so I substituted 2c flour, 1 TBSP baking powder, 1 TSP salt and 1/3 cup butter.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also added an egg with the milk.  They were light and fluffy and didn't have the baking powdery/bisquick taste. Very, VERY good!!!

WOW!  These are really great!  The only adjustment I will make the next time is to cut down the amount of garlic salt sprinkled on top.  They were a little salty.  Next time I will use garlic powder instead of all or part of the garlic salt.

I used low-fat cheese and skim milk..and no one could tell the difference..The first time i made these for my boyfriend...he said he could have ate the entire batch....i also made them for a get-together....i showed up late (i forgot a few ingredients at the market) and when i walked through the door...everyone practically pounced on me to get the bag full of steaming hot biscuts! They are just like the biscuts at a well known seafood restaurant. (hints...go easy on the garlic salt, do not overbake, and VERY IMPORTANT..do not refridgerate baked biscuts..it will make them hard as rocks!)
Once again...i've found a keeper!

When I make biscuits at home, I usually go the bisquick route...so I gave this a shot and throughly enjoyed it.  I've tried other biscuit recipes on this site claiming to taste as good as R.L., and this one is pretty close.  One trick I used to make them taste more like the famous seafood restaurants is brushing them with a little seasoned garlic butter after they've come out of the oven.  This gives them a little extra flavor and keeps the tops moist as well.  Good recipe Chaney :)

It’s not a good thing that these mix up and are in the oven in mere minutes.  Or that they’re so easy to make you could do it blindfolded with one hand tied behind your back.  Or that clean-up basically involves just a bowl and spoon.  It will be too tempting to make them too often.  I made a half recipe for Hubs and me which produced nine of the cutest little golden biscuits you ever saw in your life.  Buttery, garlicky and cheesy good, I could have eaten all nine myself.  But I didn’t.

I would give this recipe 3.5 stars. It was simple, easy to make, fast, and used ingredients that we all typically have handy for the most part. (As one of the other cooks suggested, you can use 2 cups flour, 1 TBSP baking powder, 1/2 TSP salt, and 1/3 C butter if you do not have biscuit mix in your pantry.) However I thought the cheddar flavor was muted and not as cheesy or pronounced as I would have liked. I also found the garlic salt to add a little bit too salty of a flavor. Next time I would definitely use sharp cheddar cheese, add extra cheese, and use less garlic salt OR use garlic powder on the top instead of garlic salt

These were SO GOOD!  I could barely stop eating them.  They are extremely close to Red Lobster's biscuits.  I used soy cheddar cheese because it was all I had so I can imagine they'd taste even better with the real thing!  My husband loved'em too.

I have made these twice now and I think I'm hooked! My 
husband thinks that they're better than Red Lobster's. I can't
belive how fast and easy they are to make. They even taste
good the next day. I use Pioneer baking mix instead of Bisquick.
Yummy!

This is another good recipe. I made some without the parsley and didn't miss it. I would say the parsley is optional. VERY good.

Good. I would give them 4.5 stars. Watch the garlic powder/salt. It can overpower the biscuit.

Excellent!!!  So easy and so good!  My family goes crazy for these biscuits.  I use 1 tsp of Santa Maria seasoning instead of parsley and salt which adds great flavor.

Easy to prepare.  I used low fat cheese and milk. The cheese taste wasn't very strong, but that could be due to the cheese I used.

awesome, almost like Red Lobsters. I used club soda instead of milk as suggested by previous review, and glad I did. I didn't have any garlic powder, so i used 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt in mix. i also mixed in parsley rather then just sprinkling it on top. instead of sprinkling top with garlic salt, i made garlic butter and brushed the tops after 8 minutes, then returned to oven for 7 minutes, then lightly brushed them again just before serving. I made them on Sunday, today is tuesday and the leftovers are still moist. I stored them in an air tight container on my counter top. thanks for the recipe!

My son said they were fantastic!  Used the version detailing how to make these without the bisquick mix.  Also, used only garlic salt instead of powder and salt.

Love, love, love, love, LOVE this recipe! It tastes way better than the Red Lobster biscuits if you use the Fluffy Biscuits recipe on this site instead of the biscuit mix and change the measurements of this recipe to a 12-biscuit-batch. The only complaint I have is that the garlic salt made the biscuits a little too salty, I'd probably reduce the amount by 1/2. The parsley gives it a wonderful flavor, however I wonder why the recipe doesn't have you mix the garlic salt and parsley INTO the batter at the beginning. Otherwise, absolutely, positively PERFECT

I had no biscuit mix so I made my own with two cups of flour, 2table spoon of baking power and half tea spoon of sugar and salt. And then I followed the rest of the recipe. Very good biscuit

Very tastey, but took advice and a little change from other reviewers. I didn't use garlic salt or parsley with the melted butter. I used garlic powder in it's place & mixed the parsley in with the batter. I would suggest more garlic in the mix the next time I make these. But hubby liked them very much and ate 4 of them with his chowder.

These were good.  I was expecting a little bit more flavor...similar to Red Lobster, but these are the closest that I have found to those.  I think I will tinker more with seasonings to get more flavor.  Thanks for the post.

Like MCKDEVIN, I am also not a Bisquick fan (primarily for the addition of dextrose/sugar), so I made these according to his/her adjustments... and they were really really tasty! The recipe made 24 and my dad, ever the carb-lover, probably ate a dozen before eating the vegetarian chili main course! The only thing I'd do differently is use a different cheese - I found the shredded 2% sharp cheddar I used just didn't pack enough punch. Easy, quick - will definitely make again!!

very yummy, quick, easy and Red Lobster biscuit-like.  I followed the suggestion of halfing the garlic salt for the parsley/garlic salt sprinkle.  Good suggestion and I think I could have even used less than half.  You have to be careful with the garlic salt because it does not physically mix well with the parsley and some biscuits may end up with more than their fair share of garlic salt.  You will be tempted to cook these longer than they call for.  Don't.  They will harden up some after cooling.  Made these THREE times in two days because people kept gobbling them down like candy.

Love at first bite!  My hubby's first question was "so who do you think you are, "R.L."?  These taste just like those!"   The ol' guys taste buds are getting sensitive to saltiness so I've cut back.  I use unsalted butter and unless it calls for fresh,  I use a garlic seasoning call Garli Garni on most everything calling for garlic salt/powder and it was fabulous in this too.  This is a keeper.  Thanks so much Chaney!

These were good, but a little heavy.  I may have made them too large and therefore the tops browned before the insides were done.  I will definitely make them again, but will decrease the size to see if that makes a difference.  Taste wise, they were okay.  I will probably add a little more garlic and maybe some minced onion or onion powder.

SUBSTITUTED: buttermilk for the milk. 

Everything else I did exactly the same. These biscuits are cheesy, fluffy, buttery goodness. You can taste the garlic salt and butter mixture brushed on them on your tongue with every bite...it's biscuit bliss. Next time I'm going to try adding diced Jalapenos! 

GRIPE: My only gripe is that even though they had plenty of cheese in them, I couldn't really taste it. They could benefit from a good Sharp Cheddar next time. 

Other than this minor complaint they were fantastic!

I used butter instead of margarine and didn't sprinkle the extra garlic salt over top as I didn't think my kids would like the extra garlic.  I used colby cheese instead of cheddar as that was all I had on hand.  The biscuits were fantastic and easy, great with a big bowl of soup.

I have been trying to find a substitute for Red Lobster Cheese Biscuits for years.  I found this, used the recipe for Mayonnaise Biscuits on this site instead of biscuit mix, and found heaven. Everyone who tries them loves them, and my husband said they are better than Red Lobster's! I usually add a bit more cheese than it calls for.

I am SO glad I tried this recipe! Here I sit at the kitchen table, cooking for the week. I'm having a cold glass of milk and a delicious buscuit, velvety and buttery. A slight bite from the extra sharp cheddar . Even my picky husband liked it!
The only thing I did different was half the milk and sub it with buttermilk. I also used Extra Sharp Cracker Barrel Cheese. Thank You so much for submiting this recipe!

Great recipe - quick, easy, delicious, plus ingredients that I always have!  My husband loved them - he especially liked the saltiness.  Instead of the garlic salt and parsley I used McCormick California Style Garlic Salt, which has the parsley in it!

These are absolutely delicious! I only made two changes,  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and I did not add any additional garlic salt on top, the butter and cheese were salty enough for us. No left overs!

These taste just like Red Lobster's biscuits and I was surprised that they are really easy to make. If I decided last minute to add them to a meal, it really doesn't take long to whip them up.

Super biscuits!! They are very similar to the biscuits made at that "seafood" restaurant.  Very easy to make and didn't take much time at all from beginning to end.  I did not have garlic salt on hand.  So, I used 3/4 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/4tsp. of salt and combined.  They turned out wonderful.  Would make again!!!!  Thanks!!

Try using club soda instead of milk or water.  Much, much better.  Fluffier and not dense.

This receipe has changed my life. My family loves these famous rolls from one of our favorite lobster spots and this is the real thing, this is it. If you can boil water (not that this receipe requires it) you can make this awesome receipe. My 7 yr old daughter helped me and we had fun.

This is a really simple and quick bread to make, although it lacks a little in flavor.  Next time, I'll add more cheese and perhaps some red pepper to kick it up a notch.  My kids loved them dipped in honey.

My boyfriend LOVED these biscuits. He thought they were even better than Red Lobsters! I didn't make any adjustments except I used about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and spread more melted butter on the top when they came out of the oven!

YUM!!!  I used 2 cups all purpose flour with 1 TBS baking powder and 1TSP salt.  Added 1/3 cup softened butter as well. (As per another review,  I don't like the "Bisquick" taste in my biscuits either)  I also threw in a few shakes of dried Red Pepper flakes, few shakes of Oregano (in place of the parsley) and used 1 TSP fresh minced garlic in place of the garlic salt.  Fantastic!  This is  a quick easy go to recipe for busy weeknights :)

absolute love these! I didn't have any biscuix mix but I Found a recipe for a homemade version that can be stored in the freezer, which makes this recipe even more easy to make and enjoy. I omitted the melted butter as you have to cut butter into the the home made mix. I also didn't have any garlic powder/salt so I just added a little garlic Mrs. Dash.

These were delicious. Made them for breakfast for christmas morning and I think I'll make them for lobster on New Year's eve too. Love the garlic salt sprinkled on top.

AWESOME!!!!! I used a little more garlic salt on top than called for because I'm a salt nut. They were super easy and absolutely delish!

I liked these biscuits alot but I was a big fan of the parsley. If I made them again I'd probably leave that out.

yummy!!!! I would only used 1/2 tsp of garlic salt because it was a little too salty for me (I'm a little salt sensitive) & I lowered the temp to 375 for 12 mins because they came out a little too browned @ 400 for 10 mins. Besides that... these were GREAT! I made them alongside chili (my husband doesn't like corn bread) & it went great!!!! Better than a similiar recipe on this site that I had tried out before. thanks for sharing!

These biscuits are excellent..this was my first time making biscuits ever and they were super soft. To all those who said 'I don't like Bisquick' she said biscuit mix not Bisquick. Anyway my picky 18 month old loved them as well as my husband..I followed the recipe to the t except didn't have parsley they really were excellent. Thank you... oh btw if you follow the recipe you will realize they aren't too salty but you need to melt the butter and mix that and garlic salt before putting on biscuits.

I've been making these for years...I put the garlic salt in the batter instead of on top.  I also accidentally put the margarine (I actually use butter) in the mix one time - It wasn't very "healthy", but certainly made it better!

I was hoping for something "Red Lobster-esque", and these are close but a bit too dry for my tastes/what I wanted.  They are tasty, though!  I used another reviewers suggestion and brushed them with garlic butter instead of garlic salt (if you do this, make sure you add a pinch of salt to the mix since you're not putting it on top).

Very good! The only change I made was, I only added melted butter to the top of the biscuits (we didn't have garlic salt).

The biscuits expand.  After putting margarine on the biscuit, bake for another 3-4 minutes.

Tremendously good. I omitted the buttery herb topping step, simply because time got away from me, but the flavor is fantastic anyway. These are soft and garlicky, and the cheese crisps up nicely. Note: I did use extra sharp white cheddar, which I'm sure helped to contribute to not needing the buttery topping. Thanks for the recipe!

I used bisquick baking mix even though I dislike bisquick pancakes and I loved them. I used sharp white cheddar cheese and real butter, it was awesome. Easy and quick biscuits that anyone will enjoy.

Wow!  Delicious!  They were very easy and simple to make.  I was a little concerned that I was making them too big, but they cooked through and were golden brown on the outside.  I've never had Red Lobster biscuits, but I'm sure that these are as good or better.

Great! I love Red Lobsters Cheddar Biscuits and these are exactly the same. Thank you so much for this recipe. I made this for my w/crab legs, It was so good. The only thing i did different was, I subbed the garlic salt for more garlic powder & i didnt add the parsley.

Didn't have cheddar cheese so I used colbyjack....turned out great!!  Good flavor....not overbearing.  I did only use 1/2 t of garlic salt in the marg mixture.  I added parsley, marg, and garlic salt together to baste on buscuits.  Baking time was perfect.  Forgot to ALSO mention that I made my own baking mix from the recipe on this site.  Excellent!

These biscuits are delicious and very easy to make.  I added half of the amount of parsley right to the biscuit mix and 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese as well.  These were a perfect combo with shrimp alfredo pasta.

These biscuits were excellent! They taste just like Red Lobster's as everyone has said. Adjust the garlic salt to your taste. Other than that, these are easy, fast and absolutely delicious. We had them with lasagna. Yum!

These are the easiest, most delicious biscuits I've ever made. They take NO time! My fiance said they taste just like Red Lobster. I forgot the parsley, but didn't miss it. I didn't have garlic salt so I just mixed some table salt w/ garlic powder. They will be a staple at our table in the future.

This was a great recipe for when you need "something" in a pinch to go with dinner. It turned out very well, except the time/temp for baking was either too long or too hot. It took only 7-8 min at the temp suggested and if I hadn't been keeping a close eye, they would have burned. But will definately make again...kids loved it!

This is a fantastic recipe!  The taste is wonderful, it was incredibly simplistic, it is very quick, and these are all ingredients that I normally keep in my house anyway.

Best biscuits ever. I used 2 cups of flour and 1 tbsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt and added an egg, at another reviewer's suggestion.  These have a permanent place in my recipe box. Thank you!

I'm not a big fan of Bisquick, so I only give it four stars.  But these were very good, with a few small changes.  Based on another reviewer's recommendation, I used 2 c flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp baking powder and 1 egg.  Baked 18 min at 400 degrees.  My family loved these.

I love this recipe as written and have made it several times.  Then again, here are my usual changes that I prefer.  I add 2T freeze dried chopped chives (thank you Penzeys)and 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning to the dry ingredients and use buttermilk instead of milk when I have it.  I also cannot for the life of me measure out just one cup of cheese and usually end up with 1 1/2 cups :) I then brush midway though with garlic butter (made with 1/2 stick butter and 4 chopped cloves of fresh garlic melted/cooked) and brush again as it comes out of the oven. I usually end up with 12 biscuits.

I barely sprinkled any garlic salt and it was perfect for us since hubby isn't a big fan of garlic.  So easy to mix up and they're done in no time.  It might be fun to experiment with different cheeses

This recipe is a keeper! Now, I went the route of using flour,salt, and baking powder to make it even more from scratch. They came out very good. Someone mentioned not to put them in the fridge or they will harden out. My suggestion is to let them cool down a bit then store them in a plastic bag and warm them up in the oven or a toaster oven to bring back their moist and fluffy texture. I do this often to "revive" day old bread. The key is to either bag them in a plastic bag with the least amount of air trapped or use plastic wrap and store them inside a brown paper bag. Too much kitchen light also contributes to dry out breads. So either wrap it or bag it but do not forget to put them inside a dark brown paper bag.

Personally, I eat extremelly low in sodium so I did not use the garlic salt per suggestion of many and really the sodium content is just right.

EDIT: I just made this recipe with self-rising flour and it came out perfect.
EDIT2: I just made this recipe again with self-rising flour and no garlic salt and dried parsley. I made a small batch to which I sprinkled a pinch of coarse salt before putting in the oven and proceeded as instructed and this came out very good not salty at all and nicely looking with the little salt crystals shining on top!

It could be one of those recipes you just get better at.  I found it way to crumbly for dropping in pan and much to garlicy. I will try again tho.

The first time I cook a recipe I follow it exactly, then decide if I need to tweak it.  I made these exactly per the recipe and they turned out perfectly.  I found the amount of garlic powder and garlic salt to be perfect.  I wouldn't change this at all.  My family loved it and have asked me to make it again this week.

These came out great!!!  I used 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder on top because other reviewers said they were too salty.  I used extra sharp cheddar cheese, next time I will add a little more than 1 cup.

These are a winner!  I added the egg as suggested by another reviewer.  I used butter spray on top along with parsley - garlic taste wasn't over powering so will add a little garlic salt on top next time.  Be sure to not overbake.  Definitely a keeper!

A huge hit with my cioppino! I used extra sharp cheddar and an additional 1/4 cup of fresh grated Parmesan. These are every bit as good as those famous ones at the lobster restaurant.

I did not have bisquick, so i was so thankful that this reviewer said, "I'm not a bisquick fan, so I substituted 2c flour, 1 TBSP baking powder, 1 TSP salt and 1/3 cup butter." --MCKDEVIN
So I wasn't sure if he sub'd the butter for the margerine or if he added it to the batter, but my batter was so dry i added the butter.  i also did 1 c wheat flour, 1 c white flour and a little more cheese!  IT WAS DELISH!!  Never made an easier yummier biscuit.  Oh also MCKDEVIN added an egg and i did too:) yum!

These were just ok.  I thought they were a little dry.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I didn’t brush the biscuits with melted butter mid-way through the baking time.  Instead I brushed them before and after baking.  I also cut the garlic salt back quite a bit.  I got 10 huge biscuits, too big really.  So if you’re making these, plan on at least a 12 biscuit yield, not the 8 the recipe suggests.

Took these to a potluck and they were a big hit.  Like someone else reviewed, I was told they were better than Red Lobster's.  I used mozzarella instead of cheddar.  Yummmmmmy.

These darn biscuits are amazing.  Friends have even gone so far as to call them "magical biscuits" lol! I add extra cheese like an Italian blend (mozzarella, provolone, etc..) to make them extra moist and add some extra garlic salt right into the batter... SO GOOD!!

I've made these before, and they're very good. But for tonight I was thinking of adding sausage to make them a bit more of a filling snack.

My husband and his buddies loved these!  They all said that they tasted like the famous Red Lobster bisuits.  They didn't last a day.

I guess I'm in the minority with this recipe. I followed it exactly, which I guess that's why I decided to make it. It was horrible. Very doughy and heavy with garlic flavor. Wouldn't even try to fix this.

These biscuits were delicious!  They were very soft and moist, with a very nice cheesy and garlic-y taste.  They didn't last long, and I'll definitely be making these again!

After reading several comments/reviews, I made a batch with the following adjustments: 
8 oz sharp cheddar (1.5+ cups = more) 
1/4 tsp garlic powder (= half)
butter (IMHO, margarine is salty, flavorless grease)
sprinkle of celery salt (= WAY less sub for garlic salt)
Served with chili; dee-lish and filling!

These were amazing and super easy! I only had pancake and waffle mix on hand, not all-purpose baking mix, and I was so surprised at how great they still tasted. I can only imagine how awesome they will be when I use the proper ingredient! I used fancy shredded cheese instead of regular, which I think helped the consistency. Can't wait to make these again!

I used to make something similar to this years ago but lost the recipe. I saw this and read the reviews. Tried them tonight and these are almost the same as the ones I used to make but are better. I used a little more cheese. I found the dough to be dry so I added a little milk until it was moist. I never use margarine so I took 1/2 stick of butter, melted it, threw in parsley until it looked pretty and basted the hot rolls with it. Huge hit and so simple. I will make these many more times since I have now saved the recipe.

This were great, tasted just like RL. I'm not sure why some thought these were dry. I followed the recipe exactly and they weren't dry at all. Crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. Very addicting- thanks for sharing.

Very good biscuits, easy to make in no time! I did make one batch as written, and another using butter instead of margarine, less garlic salt, and about 1/2 c more cheddar. I preferred the second batch. Definitely add a bit more cheese, as it's not very prominent. I would make these again, thanks :)

Great! The key to prevent them from getting hard after keeping them in the frig is putting in 1 egg. This makes them so soft and delicious for as long as you have them. I also mixed parsley flakes within the batter. That makes them look wonderful and just like Red Lobster!

they are the same as Red Lobster biscuits, I did`t use any garlic salt instead I added minced garlic to the melted butter and waited 10 minutes so the butter would get a deep garlic flavor and then brushed the biscuits immediately upon removing from oven.

Amazing. I thought they were gonna suck because I realized I didn't have cheddar after I already started on them so I used mozzerella. They were still great. Wonderful flavor and very simple.

I love this recipe!  I have made them over and over with rave reviews. Today I made it on a rainy day to go with my chicken noodle soup.  I went to make the biscuits and realized that I had no milk.  Instead I used sour cream and water mixed together for the liquid portion of the recipe. They were even better than the original.

What a great recipe! I did add 1/4 cup of sour cream to the mix, as suggested from others. I put the garlic salt right into the dry mix and skipped the garlic powder.

Aesthetically speaking they looked just like the seafood resturant biscuts. Their consistency however was denser. The taste was somewhat similar but my family rates these at a 3.7 overall because they favor a lighter, fluffier texture.

My Husband loves this recipe.  He hates Red Lobster but Loves the biscuits.  I have made this several times. Saturday evening I am going to take them to a fish fry.  Servings for 25.  Only 15 are coming.  Yummmm!  This is the ONLY biscuit I make well.  I have tried MANY.

I really likes this recipe.  I used a bit more cheddar and used Tastefully Simple spinach and herb mix with some cracked pepper.  I also used a bit of sour cream in the milk for a bit more moisture.  The last five minutes I brushed them with butter and savory.  I am supposed to serve them tonight for dinner but I'm not sure they will last that long.  Also, using an ice cream scoop was the perfect size to drop them onto the pan.

These are every bit as good as RL's cheddar biscuits.  I used "Heart Healthy" baking mix, which has less fat, and skim milk.  Full fat cheddar, though, and real butter!  I actually cut the last five minutes of baking to about three because of other reviewers warnings that they were a little dry .. and they were still a little dry, but that's probably my fault for using the lowfat mix and skim milk.  Very, very good though.  We just had them for lunch on a cold day with the Newport Clam Chowder recipe from this site.  My husband is a very happy man right now - and full.

I made these biscuits to serve with salad, baked potato and blackened tilapia.  My husband absolutely loved them and said they were better than the restaurant.  I reduced the salt to a heaping 1/2 tsp.  These were such a hit I will make these again tonight!

Can I give these more than 5 stars PLEASE??? They were great, so great that I ate three last night for dinner,(shame on me), but I could'nt help it. I did cut the recipe in half and only made four biscuits. Followed directions to the tee, except following others suggestions I did cut the garlic salt in half that I used on the biscuits, glad I did because I could tell it would have been to much. And I think next time I will try adding a little more cheese, These I will be making again, there super easy and super super good. Thanks

These were so delicious! I did add a little onion powder to the melted margarine. They came out moist, tender, and were so easy to make with so few ingredients! Yes, they did taste just like Red Lobster's biscuits.

I loved these biscuits.  I did make a few changes.  I used butter instead and I did not have cheddar cheese so I used Australian Tasty Cheese.  I think next time I will go get the cheddar for the stronger flavour.

Absolutely incredible.  I've only been cooking for two or three years and this is the first time I've made biscuits.  These were unbelievably good.  I served them with fried chicken, baked beans, and cole slaw.  I may advise reducing the garlic salt just a bit, but that would just be a tweak, not a wholesale change.  These biscuits had just the right combination of crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.  They also look VERY impressive.  This is a great recipe.

Yummy! Very soft and tasty.  Plan to use leftovers to make sausage biscuits. I did not brush additional butter on top (to cut fat) and they were still great.

I had to make another batch of these because I saw that one was not going to be enough.  After tasting them I decided to alter the recipe a little.  I used 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup butter, extra sharp white cheddar, and 1/4 cup of Parmesan/Romano and we liked it better with more butter and more cheese.

I'm not familiar with Red Lobster or their biscuits so I can't speak to whether these are like theirs, but I *can* say that we loved these!  I misread the recipe and accidentally used three tablespoons of butter and mixed the garlic salt and the parsley with it.  I brushed it all on together and found that three Tbs of butter was perfect, so I will make the same change next time.  These were terrific-the highlight of our brunch!

These are fantastic! I made them for dinner on Christmas Day and my guests were surprised that I made them from scratch--they thought I bought them from the Red Lobster! I did bake them on parchment paper also. These are definitely something I would make again!

I was looking for a recipe that would taste like the bisquits served at Red Lobster Restaurants. This one comes closer to it than any other I've tasted and it was alot easier too.

VERY easy and VERY good.  I made a large batch for the lasagna night I had with a few dozen college friends, and we all loved it!  They all crowded around the oven whenever it was time to pull another batch out...  :)

Really quick and easy! I didn’t have any bisquick so I substituted with pancake mix and it came out great! I did add an extra handful of cheese, used Italian seasoning instead of garlic powder, I brushed with garlic butter and only had to put back in the oven for 2 minutes.

I’m a terrible baker and these still came out perfect! Instead of using biscuit mix, I did what they suggested in the “Most Popular Positive Review.” I thought the dough looked a little dry, but again, terrible baker, what do I know. They were fine.  Yum as heck, and also very Instagram-worthy with the parsley sprinkled on top.

Followed the recipe exactly except I halved the topping.   I also only divided it into 8 portions.   Big mistake - next time tiny biscuits & full amount of topping - that is the best part - and you want more peaks and valleys and surface area which smaller biscuits will give.  Great recipe.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and the biscuits were amazing- light and fluffy and lots of flavor. The only thing I will do differently next time is to omit the parsley and use just garlic powder with just a very small sprinkle of salt added.

Definitely going to leave out the garlic salt next time; it was overpowering. May add a pinch of garlic powder into the actual mix instead.

I needed 1 cup of milk total, possibly bc I used a homemade Bisquick mix (2 c white flour, 1T baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 2T butter cut thoroughly into it) and so it needed a touch more liquid. I cut the garlic salt in half per other reviews (thank you!!)  (and added garlic powder for other half) but it was still too salty for me overall. Plus, I was wanting something milder tasting and the garlic was too much. Next time, won’t add garlic on top; maybe just the olive oil I used (instead of margarine); a light sprinkle of Kosher sea salt; and some parsley (only used about half called for). And might try with some fresh rosemary minced in the mix before adding milk, depending on what the biscuits are paired with?

These were fantastic!  I made them as the recipe directed. They are not the traditional biscuit - with the butter and cheese throughout there is no need to add more when they're on your plate.  They are also too crumbly to slice and spread butter on anyway.  Definitely making again.  They were a big hit.

We didn’t enjoy these at all.  Had a slightly sweet taste.  Probably the Bisquick.  .

Yum! I will definitely make this again! All I had in the house was mild cheddar. Can't wait to try it with sharp or extra sharp. Gotta love a batter that's ready in the time it takes preheat the oven. Grease the pan very well and take them off quickly.

This recipe makes a beautiful topping for chicken pot pie. Forget pie crust, you can use these yummy biscuits by simply dropping them in spoonfuls to cover your chicken mixture. This is a new family favorite. And they're so fast and easy to make! Great to eat alongside any soup or stew!!

I used buttermilk complete pancake mix and I guess it is different to bisquick because my biscuits were somewhat sweet. Aside from the sweetness, they were good.

Delicious!  With the garlic butter topping if you eat them warm, don't even need butter.  I did add about 1/2 top. Old Bay seasoning with the butter topping.  Marilyn

I like the "from scratch" recipe I've been using better because they taste less processed but my family loved these and preferred these.  It's certainly VERY easy to make so I will be making these more often than the other from scratch recipe.
We grated sharp cheddar cheese and used 2 CUPS rather than just 1 cup.  I did not have garlic powder so I sprinkled the tiniest amount of garlic salt in the dry mix.  And I minced fresh garlic and mixed it with melted butter and brushed it on top of the biscuits at the very end.
Also, I used Krusteaz Pancake mix for this and it turned out just fine!  4.5 stars from me, 5 stars from the rest of the family!
Note: Be very generous on the cheese.  Can be 2 cups + a bit.

These were delicious!  I used garlic powder and salted separately since some said it was too salty.  Used a very generous cup of sharp cheddar cheese.  These were identical in taste to the boxed version of the red lobster brand in our opinion! !!

Easy and Delicious!! These taste EXACTLY like the biscuits you get at Red Lobster. We do not use finely shredded Cheddar Cheese because it tends to disappear into the batter, we use regular Shredded SHARP Cheddar (It stands out more for flavor and consistency) also we add the dried Parsley into the batter and omit sprinkling it on top. Just try it... you'll like it

Were great with one exception (hence the lack of a fifth  star), the final topping was too salty. I recommend dusting the parsley and garlic salt separately and eyeballing how much garlic salt you use. With the saltiness of the baking mix and the cheddar, it isn't all needed. Since I was also making Chef John's Couscous Primavera, I ended up cutting up extra green onions and adding them to these biscuits. A great addition.

Very good.  Made as directed except used sharp cheddar and added an additional half cup.   Also halved the parsley, putting half in the dough and sprinkling the rest on top and used garlic powder instead of salt.  Served them as a base for a chicken pot pie stew and it was total comfort food.  Will make these again and maybe add an egg for a fluffier dough.  But awesome made as directed.

My family and I absolutely LOVE these biscuits. I usually can't make enough of them and I can't make them fast enough. Usually i have to make a huge bunch of these at a time. I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and i add a lot of extra cheese . Other than that the recipe is fantastic and it is an easy enough one i can teach my girls how to fix them.

I used strongly-flavoured cheese and more of it, more parsley, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt for the butter/powder brushing of the biscuit tops at the end.  Everybody loved them.  So quick and easy and little to clean up.  Served with a roasted chicken dinner and  made them again the next day to accompany chicken vegetable soup.  This is a keeper, folks.

Delicious.  I didn't have Bisquick, so used self-rising flour.  I also used buttermilk, since I had some that  needed to be used.  More than 2/3 cup,  because it is so thick, but I didn't measure.  Very fluffy and the family loved them.

These tasted good and I will make them again, but they were extremely dry. I even used an extra half cup of cheddar in my second batch to bring some much needed moisture, nut they were still way too chalky. overall, a great, simple recipe, but I will use less Bisquick or more milk/butter next time.

1st time making cheddar biscuits. Super easy for me. Tastes great! I followed some of the suggestions and substituted the Bisquick for the 2c flour, 1 TBSP baking powder, 1 TSP salt, and 1/3 c butter. I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

So I'm terrible at baking and of course I added the two eggs, which this recipe did not ask for but it was on the biscuit mix box. They still turned out really yummy but they didn't rise as much (my fault). I will definitely be making these again- my kids and hubby loved them!

Quick, easy, perfect for football game finger foods! The 1 & only critique I have is I recommend using garlic powder instead of garlic salt or maybe mixing it 1/2 & 1/2, they are way salty the way written & I am a "Salt-A-holic", lol. Also, I've made them adding in a tablespoon of chives...AWESOME! All in all, these are a knock out! Great recipe!

Wow! So tasty! Very similar to Red Lobster cheddar biscuits. Made recipe as described except no garlic salt on top. (I had none). Ended up with 20 good-sized biscuits. Family raved; will make again. I used Jiffy Baking Mix. It's local--Michigan made and good quality. Buy if you can. Jiffy is a great small company in Chelsea, MI. Yum.

Delicious! I followed the recommendations of mckdevin and made the biscuit batter from scratch (2c flour, 1tbps baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1/3c butter), added 1 egg with the milk. I used soy milk because we don't drink cow's milk in my house and it still turned out quite tasty. It was easy and quick and delicious. Mine took a little bit longer to bake than the recipe, which I attribute to the modifications, but I'm not sure. I also used sharp white cheddar cheese, and it tasty very cheesy and delicious.

No need to change everything.  These were DEVOURED in minutes.  I did try another recipe from this website that makes them from scratch and mine didn't rise.  So I tried this one that uses Bisquick mix.  They were perfect.  Light and fluffy, tangy cheese flavour and lots of buttery garlic.  Fabulous!

I started making a close version these long before I saw the recipe on this site. I use sharp cheddar just because that is our preference. I also take 2 strips of thick sliced bacon sliced lengthwise down the middle and then dice the slices into a small dice, fry til crisp. After the bacon is drained I add it to the mix. I sprinkle Kosher salt on top instead of garlic salt. Honestly you could have just these for dinner split in half then buttered they are that good.

Wowzers! What a hit! These were so easy to make and tastes better than one of the restaurants they are featured in. Now, I used mild cheddar and added more than suggested. I also added more garlic powder than suggested. I omitted the garlic salt. I also combined the margarine and parsley before spreading. I used bisquick for the biscuit mix. These were just spectacular!

I was looking for an easy bacon/cheddar biscuit recipe, teaching granddaughter to cook, but couldn't find any so I modified this one.  I added 2 pcs of left over bacon (crumbled),  left out the garlic salt, parsley, and melted margarine.  I used a cookie scoop  and was able to get 18 mini biscuits from this recipe. The temp and baking time worked. She said they turned out yummo and I have to agree.

I follow the recipe almost exactly on these and every time I make them, they disappear.  The only thing I do differently is make them smaller and cook them for less time.  I use a cookie scoop that I have.  I'm one of those people who feels like the more items they have on their plate the more they've eaten so I'll eat three of the smaller ones versus two of the larger ones, it saves calories! =)

Followed the substitution suggested by MCKDEVIN. These biscuits are so good! The reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because I was looking for a more fluffy biscuit. The biscuits came out more dense than I expected. I want to avoid the 'extra' ingredients from the biscuit baking mix, so I went for a more made-from-scratch route. Definitely a must try!!

I didn't have any Bisquick so I tried the recipe that MCKDEIN used and these were sooooo good.  Will leave the cheddar cheese out next time when I make my biscuits and gravy.  Very light and fluffy.  I forgot to put the 1/3 cup of butter in but the dough was still easy to handle.  I had a DUH moment and the biscuits were still good.  ---- SUSAN P

I didn't have baking mix so I had to use the recipe on this site. Without powdered milk I used buttermilk, which may have made these biscuits a little too moist, but overall they were wonderfully cheesy and tasty. Be sure to make small biscuits instead of big southern ones, or else the insides will be doughy!

I did a few things differently on here. First I followed another user's version for the dough : absolutely brilliant! I love it. Plus I didn't use cheese...I used herbs. 1 tsp of each oregano and parsley that is freeze dried (you can get them in the grocery stores) and they smelt divine. I also added garlic powder and the parsley and oregano to the melted butter and spread it on top. Very delicious. My fiancé HATES bread but he loves these.

I have a version of this recipe that uses 7up and sour cream that makes these biscuits very light and delicious.

I followed MCKDEVIN'S changes and added a pinch of cayenne pepper for a bit of a smoky flavour and they turned out amazing!  This will definiy

Me and my mom made these I love cooking in fact I take culinary so I enjoy making new items. My mom wanted to fine a recipe like the biscuits at red lobster that she liked so much. I went searching found this loved it one thing u have to do is add a little bit extra milk to the matter and the cheese amount really depends on how cheese you want them to be but my family loved these we ate all of them in one dinner setting they r pretty much exactly like the red lobster ones

Yummy! I didn't have baking  mix so I subbed flour, soda n salt n baking powder. Also melted real butter mixed in the parsley and I used garlic powder in the butter...  I just combined  that in a bowl and brushed them after they were done. Nice! paired these with my homemade clam chowder....very good!

I just made these and my fiancé loves them. I used 1 1/2 cup of cheese and grated 2 tbs cold butter into the mix. Next time I'll add just a little more garlic powder to them.

We made this dish exactly per the instructions this past Thanksgiving and the reception was lukewarm at best.  Not sure why the variance from everyone else, especially since we tend to agree with the majority of Allrecipe.com reviews.  At least we tried.

Awesome! We're chowing down on these right now. We always love these biscuits at Red Lobster but now that I can control the butter and salt, it's so much better. Next time I will try the flour/baking powder etc. just because I want to stay away from the additives in the bisquick but I made these as is and awesome awesome awesome. I may have to make another batch tonight lol. Thank you for sharing!

I used my own dough (2 cups flour, 1/3 cup butter, 1 tbsp baking powder 1/2 tsp salt) in place of the biscuit mix. Based on the other reviews saying it wasn't cheesy enough, I upped the cheddar to 2 cups, but still. The melted cheese taste and texture gets lost somewhere in the biscuit. Oh, and I mashed my own garlic, mixed it in with melted butter and brushed that on top. These were good and we loved them, but they weren't cheesy.

I made these biscuits tonight so I could use up my baking mix.  They turned out really great. I didn't have garlic salt so I used only the garlic powder and parsley in the melted butter.  I made them kind of small instead of regular biscuit size.  It was hard to not eat too many.  My husband really liked them and I will definitely make these biscuits again.

As far as I have heard, these are the ingredients in the famous seafood restaurants biscuits.  The quantities of the ingredients may vary a bit from recipe to recipe, but these are nearly the same thing!

Have made these 3 times. They are addictive. I am not a biscuit  person and didn't even own a box of Bisquick, but will be buying another box real soon. The only change I made, since I didn't have garlic salt, was to sprinkle a little garlic powder instead. Biscuits are light and soooooo good. Melt in your mouth tender!!!!!

These are so good! Just like Red Lobster's. I took Mckdevin's advice and used a 2c flour, 1 T baking powder and 1 t salt substitute for the Bisquick. Despite my greasing a cookie sheet, these still stuck to it, so I'll hopefully remember to use parchment paper next time. Very tasty---nice surprise for the husband, who loves Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits. :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made a half batch using sour milk which gave me a lovely light biscuit.  Substituted butter for margarine and garlic powder and season salt instead of garlic salt.  No parsley in the house, but didn't miss it.  This is a very good recipe.

I made these a few days ago, with minor modifications, and they turned out great. It seemed silly to sprinkle garlic salt and parsley on top when I could just as easily mix it in. I did just that, and brushed them with butter as recommended. They aren't as fluffy as Red Lobster's, but they're great.

Very good, easy to make, and quick! It doesn't get any better than this! Definitely a 5 star recipe. I used chives instead of parsley and didn't bother brushing down with butter at the 10-minute mark, I just threw everything together into the dough and they came out marvelous.

I didn't have bisquick, so tried the suggestion made by mcdevin and loved it. I would've added slightly more milk, as my biscuits were dry, but otherwise it was good.

Yummy - and best of all - EASY!  Realized at the last minute that I didnt have any French bread to go my my gumbo.  So I tossed this together and it was a hit!  Sure - maybe next time I'll follow some others' suggestions and try sharp cheddar instead of mild, and perhaps try club soda instead of milk, and maybe even try dropping in some chopped jalapenos.  Lots of good ideas - but these are very good as is, too!  A "go to" recipe.

I made these again this morning and my family loved them. I lightly sprinkled the garlic salt on some of the biscuits. This is an easy way to save money as well. A person can make several for the price of one:)

Easy, quick, and tasty! I just wanted cheesy bisquits, and not garlic and cheese, so I omitted the garlic. It was great! I will say, if you have a gas oven like I do, you really need to monitor the color of the biscuits to make sure you don't overcook them!

Will make this again for sure!  I think this is as close as you can get to Red Lobster bisquits...YUM!  I tweaked it a little like adding garlic & onion powder in the mixture itself...and added a splash more of milk but thats just for our taste.  Super easy & great tasting!!

Dear cheddar biscuits, you are delicious and so easy to make.  Also, you go so perfectly with soups and stews.  It's like Barbie & Ken but not as misogynistic, sexist, and without the negative body ideals. Love, me

I didn't have any baking mix on hand so I followed the substitute provided by other revivewers. The biscuits were utterly bland and mostly tasteless. I won't attempt these again.

Thank you for this great recipe!! I have made this many times for my family.  The recipe doesn't need anything added to it in but if I make it more than once in a week I will add green onions or bacon to add variety.

I was searching for a biscuit recipe that met my standards and this turned out AMAZING.  I didn't have garlic salt or parsley, but I think they might have been a bit too salty for me if I had added them.  I used mozarella instead of cheddar and they still came out great.

Quick, easy and taste awesome!!  I made these to take to a Christmas party- they were the hit of the party- I was glad I doubled the recipe :)  I wasn't sure what to use to make the approriate size biscuits, but I found that using a small cookie scoop heaping full was just perfect, the biscuits do puff up as they bake.  I think I got about 20 out of a double batch

Very good.  I used the "heart healthy" Bisquick, which seems to have no partially hydrogenated oils in it.  It's best right out of the oven - but we did eat the rest of it the next day after I re-heated them in my toaster oven.

I couldnt decide whether to make this or jalepeno poppers, so i mixed the recipes and got jalepeno and cheddar biscuits. Everyone who tried them said they were delicious. I love this recipe with or withput jalepenos.

I made these with Baked Potato soup from this site and it was a hit! I had the leftover biscuits with lasgna and our guests wanted the recipe. I took the suggestion of using a flour mixture instead of the bisquick and it worked great.

Very good.  I had to make a few changes because I didn't have the correct ingredients and I thought they ended up better than Red Lobster's!  I added to the biscuit dough: 1/2 t. basil, 1/4 t. chili powder, and 1/2 t. paprika.  For the topping, I only used the 2 T. butter and 1/2 t. garlic powder.  So yummy!!  Will be making again!

These biscuits are delicious and they taste just like Red Lobsters! I'm so glad I found this recipe.I used extra sharp cheddar cheese and low fat milk.They are so quick and easy to make and are delicious with a salad.I definately plan on making these again.

I tried a different recipe for these types of rolls and while they tasted like Red Lobsters the consistency was not quite right.  Yours are perfect.  The only thing I did different was to put a little parsley in the dough as well as on top.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

These were so quick and easy.  They go great on soup night.  I did change a little:  1/3 c. milk and 1/3 c. buttermilk.  It was only because I was out of milk.  It worked very nicely.

Love these biscuits. I shared them with work and everyone was impressed and greedy :) I added extra garlic as my husband and I are garlic freaks. Enjoy this easy recipe.

I did not follow the recipe exactly, however my version turned out wonderful.  I did not measure the cheese but rather eyeballed the amount in the mix, and I added a dash of old bay seasoning to better replicate the biscuits of a certain seafood chain.  For the butter glaze I skipped the garlic salt, used salted butter and again added a dash of old bay as well as the parsley.

OMG! I have been looking for this recipe EVERYWHERE - even on the Red Lobster website! These biscuits are EXACTLY like theirs - or at least a VEERRRYYYY good imitation! And the consistency was not as dense as some have stated - it was perfect! I followed the recipe AS IS, and they came out PERFECT! I have found the recipe I will be using with alot of the dishes I make from now on :) Thanks SO MUCH for posting it!

We make these biscuits all the time now! Boy are they addictive. This recipe is printed off and has hung on my fridge ever since. We don't mesure the cheddar we just use most of a bag of velveeta crumbles for a cheesier flavor and an easy tip just make up some garlic butter in a bowl and bip each biscuit quickly into it. Much easier then basting.

These were delicious and so easy!  The next time I make them I think I will try using sharp cheddar as the medium cheddar flavor got kind of lost in the biscuit.

I hate to rate when I altered it but I just didn't have the garlic powder so I used onion powder. I thought they were amazing and I'm sure they are even better with garlic powder! I'm eating them right now and slightly happy that my husband isn't hungry I made these for our VERY late in the day breakfast and I might just eat all of them up for myself. I did have one bump in the road making them. I used parchment paper and the house filled with smoke! The biscuits were fine nothing melted or burned just lots of smoke.... but hey if I get tasty biscuits like this bring on the smoke I'll raise the windows and deal with it!

Although I can't agree about the "goes great with spaghetti" part of this recipe, I will say these are awesome and delicious! Very easy to make, I would reccomend them with a light soup so you don't feel so guilty when you eat 2 or 3! Thanks for sharing!

These were pretty good.  Definitely best right out of the oven.  They could be a little less dry, so I might make some modifications next time.

These were great! The whole family loved them.  I added 2 Tbls ground flax to Trader Joe's multigrain pancake/baking mix.  I did add 1 egg per the biscuit recipe on the box. Fresh chopped chives were awesome in it.

Close to Red Lobsters. These went great with my homemade egg noodles n chicken.
Only thing I changed, was I used fresh minced garlic and none of the garlic salt or powder! Next time I am going to use chives in place of parsley!

I made these with shrimp scampi, and my family loved them!!! I followed recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing. I will be making these again and they are so easy! My better 1/2 loves them and "hints" about me making them again soon.

This recipe was phenomenal. The only thing I did differently was reduce th amount of garlic I used in the batter, and used no garlic on the top, as I am not a garlic fan. Reccomended a million times over to everyone.

TERRIFIC!! I used Jiffy mix and have made them 2 nights in a row now. The 2nd. time I added maybe an extra 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder. I haven't actually measured the parsley and garlic salt...just lightly sprinkled. Fabulous recipe!

These were great! So quick and easy. I omitted the parsley since we are not big fans and used salted butter. Went great with our Eggplant Parmesan.

I tried this recipe because it sounded like the biscuits from Red Lobster, which I love. They taste really good, but each time I have made them, they are just a bit on the dry side.

Loved this one. It's an easy twist on biscuits. I cooked them a little to long, so watch the cooking time. They were a bit dry, but good still!

My family can't get enough of these even when I make a double batch. My six year old sneeks them out of the bowl before dinner as if they were cinnamon rolls or candy. This recipe is a keeper!!

Great recipe!  These were a hit at one of our Christmas parties.  I asked my husband if they were like the ones at Red Lobster and his response was, "They are better".  They taste best warm.

Really good biscuits Chaney. I added onion powder to the mix along with a bit of rosemary. Didn't quite have enough cheddar, so I added some parm. Used buttermilk in lieu of milk and brushed with butter instead of the margarine. So, so delicious and I thank you for this terrific recipe!

Very good! I used this both as biscuits and as a topping to a pot pie I made with left over pot roast (pot roast, gravy, veggies and biscuits baked for 35 min at 350). I did leave out the parsley.

I gave this 5 stars all around for being a very respectable, super fast, and easy recipe.  It's a great salty-cheesey biscuit that everyone will enjoy.  Aside from dialing back the amount of cheese, I wouldn't change a thing.

Eh.  I don't know.  I used reduced fat bisquik so maybe that was the problem but I was very disappointed.  Too blah.  Even my father who always takes seconds on any kind of bread or biscuit passed these up.

These were just ok.  My husband liked them, but I thought they were too heavy and dense and the flavor was nothing like Red Lobster

Yummy...!! I remember biscuit from my childhood in the states and can never find any around here. I can't find shortening either, so I used butter and a bit of oil instead. I also used J.P.'s Big Daddy Bisquit mix to make baking mix (without the milk). I think I have to use shortening for the perfect flakiness, but this was already really really delicious!!

These were great!  I believe the only reason someone would not like these would be due to not enjoying Bisquick style biscuits.  They were the perfect consistency, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Thank you!

LUV IT! I just loved these biscuits. I did mix the parsley in with the batter as a previous review suggested. I make these all the time. And for an added kick, sometimes I add a little crab meat (about 2-3 oz) and WOW. If you do use crab meat you may want to season it a little with some old bay season. I have not try using club soda instead of milk but I usually use more butter that milk.

Absolutely delicious.  Didn't change any of the ingredients.  The only change I made was to add the parsley and garlic salt to the melted butter and then brushed it all on.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I was really looking forward to this recipe, but it was disappointing.  They just did not rise well at all, way to dense.  It's possible that the bisquick I used was not as fresh as it needed to be, but the recipe was followed to a T.

These biscuits were simply awesome.  The only thing I would change was to not add the garlic salt on top, just let the butter brown and enjoy as is.

Very tasty.  I will definitely make these again, but I will try it with a little less garlic salt on top.
