This is pretty good. I sautéed the chicken with the onion and added some hot peppers and ginger. I also added some green cauliflower. Serve over rice noodles for a gluten free alternative. thank you for the recipe.

Pretty bland & unexciting. I didn't read the reviews until afterward and I realize that a lot of the positive reviewers drastically changed the recipe. I couldn't really taste the coriander or the lemon. We added some red pepper and a little parmesan to  give it some sort of flavor. On a positive - our small kids loved it.

The first time I try a new recipe I like to make as is.  It was pretty tasty, but I do think it needs a little more of a kick to it, so I would either add red pepper flakes or perhaps stir some siracha sauce into the broth.

Here is what I did to try to help this recipe, based on the reviews. First, I did not boil the chicken. I seasoned the raw chicken with the coriander and just sautéed it. Then, I removed the chicken from the pan and cooked the veggies in the chicken broth (I used snow peas and broccoli). I seasoned the veggies with lemon pepper and a lemon herb seasoning blend. I let them cook, covered for about 10 minutes before adding the chicken back in (and added the lemon juice at this point). This dish turned out delightfully tasty. We seasoned with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes before eating and my boyfriend said it was good; I, too, thought it was good! And both of my kids ate theirs (sans red pepper flakes). At ages 5 and 7, that's always a good sign for any recipe. ;) It was a very fresh-feeling dish with just the right amount of subtle (but sufficient) flavor.

Great meal. If you like a little more flavor I would use chicken broth for the chicken as well as flavor the chicken. Also, maybe a different noodle, more chow mein would work.

The broth was absorbed completely by the pasta so there was none when you ate it. Dont know if rice noodles would be better. Also, I would increase the coriander. It was not spice flavored enough. I added a little lite soy sauce to my bowl. Needs some tweaks.

I thought it was acceptable, but Mom said it was flat. Definitely need something to tweak the flavor.

I used zucchini instead of peas. It was okay, I'm not really big on pasta. It is a good dish to make for a little variety now and then.

This was a very light pasta and very good. I baked the chicken and also pan cooked leeks instead of using chives as a garnishort and then garnished the top with fresh parmesean.
