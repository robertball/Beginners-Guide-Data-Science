This was amazing!!  Very chocolatey and think! I did use sweetened condensed milk in place of the cream of coconut (didn't have that on hand).  Definitely will make this again!

My husband and I loved this dessert.  I tried several "avocado chocolate pudding" recipes from AllRecipes.com and so far this is our absolute favorite.  We loved the after burn that follows the chocolate taste.

I used Dark Hershey's Cocoa powder instead of regular because that is what I had on hand.  If you have the Dark Chocolate or wish to experiment with the recipe by making the substitute of dark for the regular, you will be totally thrilled at the extra chocolate richness of this dessert.

Doctored this recipe up heavily in order to make it palatable.    Added extra cocoa, coconut cream, cayenne and cinnamon.

I used Hershey's dark chocolate cocoa. To balance out the bitterness I presume was from using dark cocoa, I added about 1/4 c extra coconut cream. I also added agave nectar to taste, around 2-3 tablespoons. It's good. I'd like to try others to better get a sense of chocolate avocado pudding, then I could be a better judge. Not sure I can eat it all plain, considering adding chocolate pieces or dipping fruit.
