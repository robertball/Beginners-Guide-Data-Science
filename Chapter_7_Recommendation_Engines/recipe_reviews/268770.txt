We absolutely loved these! Chocolate indulgence with the luxurious taste of Baileys! Made exact to the recipe and they came out great. Will make again and will use the Baileys Glaze on top to class up any dessert recipes like cakes, cupcakes and more. We weren't big fans of the potato chip on top. These are too classy for that. Next time I would just put a cherry and or some peppermint candy pieces.

I chose to sub Bailey's for the water in the batter, as suggested by another reviewer. The cake is pretty good but the glaze is amazingly delicious! I could eat it by the spoonful and actually I did! I got 15 cupcakes and about 2 spoonfuls left over of the glaze, which went straight into my tummy! I topped 5 with the pretzel and potato chip and the remaining 10 I sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Will be making these again minus the chip and pretzel.

I changed the cake mix recipe. I wanted the cupcakes to also reflect Bailey’s so I replaced 1/4 cup water with Bailey’s. I also added in 1 tsp Hershey’s extra dark cocoa. I also added in 3 chocolate chips per cupcake . I ended up with a total of 17 cupcakes, even after filling the cupcake liners 3/4 full. I am not a fan of pretzels so made some cupcakes toppers with and without pretzels. I’m tempted to try this with the chocolate cherry Bailey’s. I’m not a cake lover -and rarely used boxed cake mixes, but these were doctored so well it’s really not noticeable.

I substituted 1/4 cup Baileys + water in the cake mix as suggested in a review. Also, I used caramel morsels instead of butterscotch morsels. I froze the chips/pretzels with the chocolate dip for bit, then spread the caramel on to make it easier. The Baileys flavor in the glaze comes through deliciously. This is a perfect "treat" for adults. Love the finished look/taste/textures!

These were amazing!!! The Bailey's Irish Cream is an important addition to the chocolate, it makes it smooth, creamy, and delicious! The crunchy pretzels and salty chips creates a delicious contrast between sweet and savory. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone interested in trying an Irish style dessert.

Great chocolate flavor and the Bailey's glaze was a perfect complement!  The butterscotch chips did not melt well and were too thick.  I added a tiny amount of butter and a splash of heavy cream.  I whisked well and added cream a little bit at a time until I reached the perfect consistency.  I drizzled mine instead of dipping, but, it was just right for dipping also.  It was similar to a ganache and set up perfectly.

These were good but I think next time I would follow others' suggestions and use ridged potato chips and add Bailey's to the cake itself (I bet coffee would be good in that cake also!).

The recipe does not suggest ridged potato chips, but I certainly do!  I don't believe a regular chip could hold up to the double dip.  The butterscotch morsels lacked the flow of the chocolate, and it was difficult to spread all the potato chips and pretzels before the melted pieces cooled.  I used a fork to try to spread some butterscotch over the chocolate areas.  Messy, but fun, and I also suggest you make this recipe with a friend.  The more licking of fingers, the better!  The recipe is also a bit deceptive in that these should be called cupcakes, not mini-cakes.  I was able to make 24 cupcakes, and there was adequate glaze for all.  I have friends who love chocolate dipped potato chips, so this recipe would be right up their alley!  Love the bit of salt in with the sugar, and if you don't have butterscotch chips on hand, you will be fine without them.

Very Tasty Cupcakes!  You can really taste the hint of Baileys in the glaze, and they were even better the following day.  The chips and pretzels were a little hard to dip, so I used a spatula to coat them.  They have a fun and modern look!

I'm not much of a chocolate lover like so many and I'm not used to using a cake mix, but this was good.  I wondered how it would have been to have used Baileys IN the cupcake rather than water as called for in the cake mix.  Maybe next time.  I got 16 cupcakes from the mix, and next time I think I'd use a pan that made bigger cakes.  I really liked the glaze for the top of the cakes!  It was difficult for me to coat the potato chips and pretzels with the chocolate and butterscotch chips and so ended up using a knife to spread the melted chips.  They were wonderful with that little sprinkle of ground (Starbucks) coffee!!  I opted to remove the cupcake papers before dunking the cakes so that the topping could drip down the sides, and that was a good idea.  I served this to some friends who agreed that they were really good!  Thanks so much, Baileys!!

From the first bite of this chocolate cupcake, you get a hit of Baileys and that’s a good thing. It isn’t overpowering and pairs perfectly with the crunch of the chocolate and butterscotch coated potato chips and pretzels.
