OMG!!!  Soooo yummy!  I have to tell you that I did not use all the ginger or all the chile paste it called for---maybe only half of each---and even then I thought it was going to be so spicy that I couldn't serve it!  And I even added a little bit more water to the pan before it was reduced.  But I was so wrong!  I kept going back to put a little bit more on my fish.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Costco just got in their Wild Fresh Copper River Salmon at a paltry $9.99 per pound!  I grilled up a little less than a pound for the two of us, and we ate it all.  I went easy on the sauce for my hubby, but I added a whole bunch more for myself--kept going back for more.  I just may have to go get more salmon because I'm not done eating this stuff!  EDIT: I sauteed pounded down boneless skinless breasts in olive oil with a little butter and made this sauce for it.  At the very end of the sauce, I put in about a teaspoon of butter to swirl around.  We literally licked our plates!  So very very yummy!  Talk about an easy meal to fix!

Very yummy. I made mistake of using cider vinegar which is lot sourer, even diluted with apple juice. would work lot better with rice wine vinegar which I will use next time but still was delicious. I had with rice and a side salad. I cooked my salmon on a cast iron pan pre heated in the oven.

This was amazing. I baked the salmon since I dont have the grill and I didnt have soy sauce either but the glaze came out delicious.

I made mashed potatoes from scratch and steemed asparagus topped with salt and pepper. 
It was delicious!!!

This was THE BEST salmon I've ever had. I used Sriracha chili sauce and it was VERY SPICY, but delicious. I also baked my salmon at 450 for about 20-25 minutes (it was frozen) and added a little honey to the sauce. Served with fried rice, sugar snap peas, and the Japanese zucchini and onions recipe found on this site. Gourmet quality meal!

Delicious! I cooked the salmon in the oven and followed the recipe for the sauce to the letter. It was so good that my husband told me he would wash the dishes, even though he worked overtime. I know it's just so he can sneak more of the salmon and the wonderful sauce! I imagine that grilled salmon is even better. I will definitely make this again.

This is the first time I write a review although I have found hundreds of fantastic recipes on this site. This was the fastest easiest most delicious one yet and I had all ingredients on hand and did it according to the chef . A gem of a recipe.

So simple yet so delicious.  This glaze is restaraunt quality.  I always pan sear my salmon, used evoo, sea salt, and fresh ground pepper.  I sauted on both sides for about 4 minutes each.  I only used 2 cloves of garlic and about 1 tablespoon of ginger (i love ginger).  I was concerned it would be too hot with the chilli paste but the rice vinegar tones it down considerablly so next time I'll use the correct amount.  Made with parmesan asparagus (recipe also from this site).  This took approximately 35 minutes to find recipe, prepare and eat, really.  So good!!

What a fantastic marinade for quality wild fresh caught salmon. We didn't want to use anything that would over power the great taste of our fish. This was just the right marinade. I used the sambal oelek chili paste, it is a regular in our household. I did cut the ginger down, just our preference. We will be using this marinade often, so great tasting.

Made the glaze exactly as written, but I put the salmon in the oven.  The spicy sweet flavor of the glaze is a fabulous accompaniment to the salmon.  I did let the glaze reduce more than 2 minutes--more like 5 or 6.  We loved this, and I will make again.  Thanks for the idea!

I grilled wild salmon, fresh caught on a very high grill.  Before I got to the salmon, I grilled zucchini, summer squash, vidalia onions, red peppers, and yellow peppers, all marinated in a balsamic vinagrette.  I sliced the zucchini and yellow squash, length wise, 1/4 inch thick.  I then put three ears of corn, still husked, that had soaked in water for thirty minutes, on the grill.   took about 5 mins on each side.  Then I grilled the salmon according to the recipe, made the sauce and just before the sauce was done, grilled medium sized roma tomotaoes.   When I put the basil, which was fresh from my plant, on the salmon, I also put it on the roasted roma tomatoes.   The tomatoes with the salmon and glaze was outrageous.   Loved this recipe.  Nice job.

This was so good! I eyeballed all the measurements for the sauce (except with the vinegar) and added more chili paste. I cooked the sauce about 5 minutes longer as well to let it thicken. I made it in the oven since I dont have a grill, adding a few spoonfuls of the sauce (uncooked) about half way through and the rest when it was done. This one is going in my recipe box.

The glaze was very tasty! Coming up with something nice to do to salmon when you don't have time to marinade it is tough, but this recipe did the trick. I fried the salmon in a skillet with a little white wine instead of grilling it, then poured the glaze over the salmon near the end of its cooking. My girlfriend said it was so tasty she ate the salmon skin too, just to get more of the glaze! Will definitely eat again!

Oh my gosh, this is just so yummy.  I did not have the hot chilli paste so substituted it with Red Hot chilli sweet and sour sauce, other than that I made it exactly to the recipe.  I have added this to my recipe box and it will definitely become my favourite.  Thank you Chef John :)

It was very good.  We grill quite a bit of salmon, and have our favorite marinades.  On a whim, we tried this one, and it was a big hit.  My wife isn't a "spicy" lover, so I only used 1 teaspoon of the chili paste.  She thought it was just right ... it was a little mild for me.  The sweet with the ginger was a nice touch.  Did mashed sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli with sourdough bread for sides.  We will definitely use this one again.

Delicious and easy. If you like spicy food, this should definitely be in your repertoire. I didn't add salt or soy sauce, and it still tasted great.

Very good, but I think next time I'd try marinating the salmon in the glaze before cooking so it absorbs more of the flavor

Used this on Salmon prepared with the Simple Seared Salmon recipe (also by Chef John). That technique was as easy and tasty as he promised.  I was apprehensive that this sauce would be too hot for my young son so I used chile sauce instead of chile paste and added about 1/2 tsp. of chile powder to "heat it up" a bit. He said his favorite part of the meal was the sauce! My wife, not a fish lover, enjoyed this. (Although she did let me finish her portion.)  I put the skillet directly on the "flavorizer bars" of my gas grill instead of the hot coals described in his Simple Seared Salmon recipe. Thanks Chef John.

Wonderful recipe.  I did not have time and threw together the sauce with the basil leaving out the water.  I poured it on top of the salmon and baked it.  The salmon was moist and flavorful.  Will definitely make this again.

Pretty good but its the typical sauce for salmon found on this website but with the addition of hot chile paste.  Don't get me wrong, it's good and worth a try.

This recipe is amazing. When I finished the sauce I was afraid it would taste a little bit strong on the salmon so I didn't use it all. Turns out everybody asked for more sauce! It has a great taste. I topped each salmon with fresh basil leaves they looked amazing when served.

I make this literally all the time. Ive substituted sriracha for the chili paste when I didn't have it, and that's good, but the paste really takes it up a notch. I really like steamed broccoli as a side so I can drag it through the extra glaze. Yum!

I used a tablespoon of olive oil,  crushed ginger, and dried basil,  I use what I have in the kitchen...I don't run out and buy a new ingredient just to make a dish,  I also used low sodium soy sauce. My chile paste was sweet/sour hot chili sauce and a dash of garlic chili paste.   It turned out yummy......we only had two pieces of salmon and we used it all,  I put the salmon in the sauce and simmered for a few minutes.... Fresh ingredients would no doubt be better, but I didn't have them and dried and canned worked well.  also I did not use any salt and it was fine.

Used Sriracha as my chili paste. Just the right amount of zip. A nice "go to" recipe for a quick dinner.

Loved this recipe.  It was enjoyed by even our fussiest fish eaters.  I marinated the fillets for about 45 minutes.  I then baked the salmon at 400C for 20-25  mins, as this is my tried and trusted way to cook salmon.  (Depending on the thickness of the steaks).   I did sub honey for brown sugar.)

Next time I will double the sauce.

Served with risotto and sauteed peppers+onions.

Mmmm!!! Will make again. Didn't have fresh basil so used dry (but I'm sure fresh is much better) and used 1 tsp sriracha (all I had on hand for chile) since my little kids would be eating it and didn't want it to be too spicy. It was such a delicate, delicious flavor.

I thought it was great. I messed up and cooked the basil with the sauce instead of adding it on top, but it still came out well. I forgot to take a picture before eating...

I was looking for something different to do with the fillets we thawed, and this was the first recipe that showed up.  I'm so glad it did!  We loved it!
I reduced the glaze for a bit longer than called for, and it still didn't thicken at all.  Next time I'll put just a touch of cornstarch in it so it's not quite so thin.

This was awesome - the only salmon recipe I can get the whole family to eat! Instead of on the grill, I cooked it in the oven at 350 on my broiler pan and turned out fine.  Also did not use the chile paste, family is picky about spice.

Family loved it so giving it five starts. It is very flavorful: I would give it four stars since it is a little too powerful for me but I admit the flavors are very good. I have 5 and 7 year old boys so used just 1/2 T chili-garlic paste for fear of being too spicy hot - this was just right...a little warm but not hot. Otherwise made as directed. They (husband included) all loved it.

Generally, I am not a huge fan of salmon unless it has a lot of sauce... and really good sauce! This salmon was truly amazing! I LOVED it. This will be one of my new staple recipes! SO DEELISH!!!

This was very very good! Such a yummy taste with a kick. I used half the amount of hot sauce and it was still pretty spicy but not too much. That's all I did differently besides cooked it on a GF grill. Love that thing!

Try this with 1/2 the vinegar, ginger, garlic and Sambal Oelek. We like spicy foods, but this was too hot for my husband. I prepared Salmon and sauce with no substitutions exactly by the recipe. Tasting revealed a very hot sour sauce. I added a tablespoon of dark agave to cut the vinegary taste. I didn't know how to reduce the heat without doubling the recipe, so that is what I did. I kept the remaining sauce to use as a base for next time. I love the combination of flavors. It was great on the salmon.

Delish!! I have never grilled salmon before this dish. The glaze was fantastic!! This is one recipe to keep!  I used a garlic chili sauce as I couldn't find the HOT chili sauce.  Will make again in the near future!

Fantastic!  We eat salmon a few times a month, usually blackened and pan seared or grilled.  Tried this when the recipe appeared in my inbox...Fantastic flavor over grilled salmon. I like it spicy so next time would probably add more chili paste.  Very simple and all three of us ate every bit, a great change from the ordinary.

Excellent! I used wild caught Coho salmon. I used the suggested grilling time rather than relying upon the color of the cooked fish. I'm so glad I did. The fish was so moist and tender. I boiled the glaze down a bit more than recommended because I like an intense flavor. It was excellent. I have never received higher marks for any dish. This will be a "company" dish, as well as a special treat on a regular day! Thank you Chef.

We loved this recipe!  I used 1/2 T. of sambal oelek because we are spice wimps.  Even so, the recipe was fabulous.  It rivals anything I've had at a restaurant.  Kudos, Chef John!  Another winner!

This will be the only way I'm preparing salmon again!!!  Absolutely perfect - boyfriend commented four times how he loved it - better than any restaurant we've had salmon in!  Didn't make any changes other than chop basil and added to sauce before reducing - my error but didn't change the flavor!  Thank you!

This recipe is very easy to make. The fresh ginger gives it a nice flavor and the fresh basil adds interesting texture. This is great for a windowsill gardener like me. I will definitely make it again.

I have made this recipe many times since 2014  and again on Easter Sunday.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  Thbe hot chili paste has a kick and I decreased to 3/4 Tbls.

Baked for 20 minutes, delicious flavor.  2nd time around cooked on the grill, 7 minutes per side, didn't have chili paste so I used red pepper flakes, amazing flavor.

The only change I made was to use ground ginger since I didn't have any fresh.  It was excellent, although for my taste, next time I'll add just a bit more chili paste because we like it spicy!  I will definitely make this again, it was so quick and easy, and good!

Made this 3 times. The 1st time  with Cod, Regular rice vinegar and no hot sauce and I loved it. The 2nd time with salmon and seasoned rice vinegar and didn't like it at all.  The 3rd time with haddock, regular rice vinegar and no hot sauce and liked it. I will make this again but not with salmon nor seasoned rice vinegar.

I toned back to the chili sauce just for myself, but this was a great quick glaze! I baked my salmon at 450 for 15 minutes. Would make again!

We loved this, especially since it doesn't require advance prep like marinades. I used Chili Garlic Paste and Splenda Brown Sugar, and it was great. The sauce didn't thicken, but that may have been due to using the Splenda. Still delicious even with those modifications and omitting the basil. Thanks, Chef John!

I didn't have chili paste so I used tomato paste with a pinch of red pepper flakes, and used dried basil in the saucepan with the other ingredients. However, the glaze smelled funny. The vinegar smell was very strong and perhaps the garlic. Next time I would reduce vinegar and garlic to see if it gets any better.

I have to say I had my doubts about this, right through the point of using it. I asked my husband to tell me what he thought, I felt it would be too strong. But he said it was a go, and boy did it ever deliver on flavor! Thanks for this great addition to my line-up.

This recipe is so easy quick and full of flavor. Made two recipes- this one and one from NY times to compare the two side by side. This was our favorite for the night and it is packed with flavor. We did all agree that we like my modified version of grilled salmon I from this site the best, see my review there for changes. But this was a very close second and very delicious

I ran out of rice vinegar so I used a combination of balsamic and cooking wine to fill in. Also used chalula hot sauce in place of the chili. Was good! Made it to go with white rice cooking with garlic and onion.

I made this as written.  I thought the flavor was pretty good, but the glaze was runnier than I expected, and the rest of my family didn't really like it.  I think the flavor overpowered the salmon.  I am tempted to try it as a marinade instead of a glaze.  If I do that, I will probably cut down on the brown sugar.

We loved this!  I made the recipe exactly as is and I wouldn't change a thing.  The sauce is really spicy by itself, but, once drizzled over the salmon with the basil it mellows out and you are left with a perfect balance of flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

May have been the fact I could not locate the sambal oelek hot chili paste specified in recipe. Went to two international  grocers and one supermarket. Internet search said sriracha a good substitute. The sauce was easy and quick to make but the sriracha I think overpowered without as much sweet heat as I prefer. When using that substitute I would up the brown sugar a bit.  That said, my husband enjoyed but for me just an ok.

Was not sure I would find all of the exact ingredients, but I did. Made the recipe for the sauce the same. The salmon I smoked instead of grilled. My wife is so picky about what she eats and did not like some of the ingredients, but she loved this dish. Marked as a favorite.  Will try the sauce on different types of meat.

Excellent recipe, especially the sauce.  I cooked my salmon differently than the recipe directs; I seared my skin on salmon in a large non-stick pan.  I made the sauce exactly as directed and it was great!  I did double the sauce since my family really enjoys sauce on their fish.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. The salmon was incredibly juicy but I modified the BBQ method a bit. I made the glaze ahead of time and poured it over the salmon with the basil cooked into the glaze. I cooked the salmon on parchment paper and put it on a pan to grill on the BBQ. It came out incredibly tender and was great on white rice with a side green salad with tomatoes. Highly recommend!

We thoroughly enjoyed this! I doubled the sauce so we would have enough to spoon a bit over the Jasmine rice that I served this with. It was so tasty, and had a nice kick to it, which my husband was thrilled about. He kept telling me that this one is a "do again" - which is high praise coming from him.

Great flavor.  I added a tsp of honey and drizzled a healthy portion of the glaze over a chopped filet and tossed it with baby greens, spinach, freshly-grated romano, italian dressing, and a pinch of sea-salt.  Not too shabby.

My fiance is not a fan of fish. At all. Made this sauce and he LOVED it! He went back for seconds. I used the full amount of hot sauce (I used sriracha) and used a microplane to grind the fresh ginger. That gave me a sauce with a fairly good kick, but not too hot. Will be making this again!

I was sceptical when trying this, because I like my salmon simple with salt and lemon pepper. Not anymore. This is delicious. Tastes good without fresh basil too, if you don't happen to have any.

Very nice. Rating four stars because I changed several steps (due to a lack of grill and a desire not to wash too many dishes). I cut the salmon into small pieces and cooked it in a cast-iron pan w/ glaze ingredients over medium heat. Then I stuck the whole pan in the oven, under a preheated broiler at 450 F. Removed when the sugar was caramelized. (Note: Added honey and basil towards the end of the broiling process, used Cholula hot sauce in place of chile paste.)

I didn't have chili paste so I used crushed red pepper instead and the heat was fine. I didn't have fresh basil either but I sprinkled some green onions on top and it was amazing!

Delish, healthy, fast and easy -what else could you ask for? I didn't have hot chili paste so I used 1 Tbsp sweet siracha chili sauce and a few pinches of ground red pepper for extra heat. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly. Served with lightly seasoned jasmine rice and Spiced Cauliflower from this site.

I prefer cilantro to basil.  I double the recipe and use on a whole side of salmon.  It makes a beautiful presentation and is perfect for a party.

Loved this! I used real maple syrup in place of sugar and did not have basil, I also used a combo of balsamic and white wine vinegar because I had no rice. It was really good, with the left over fish and sauce I chopped up fish and put in sauce, can hardly wait for lunch tomorrow.

This glaze was delicious!  I didn't have chili paste but used sriracha chili sauce, so it was spicy but so good.  All the different flavors together really compliment one another. I love ginger so I didn't cut back on that and it was just perfect.  I just wish it was a little thicker.  That's my fault since I didn't use chili paste.  But what a great sauce!

I happen to love ginger and was therefore incredibly pleased by just how bitey a bite the ginger in this delivered. Only sad thing was that the Copper River Salmon was so delicious off the grill, it was a shame to even put the sauce over it.

If you don't have time or you forget (like I did) to marinate your fish, this is an excellent alternative.  The sauce is extremely flavorful and absolutely delicious! Just as the name of the recipe suggests, it is a very fast recipe to make, but just as delicious as if you spent hours making it.

I loved it! My Husband loved it! I used Hot Cumin instead of chili paste (I didn't have any). It was so tasty. I also used a little cornstarch to thicken, then strained it for a very smooth flavored glaze.
