We really enjoyed this...my 1.5 & 2.5 year olds gobbled it up!  I did cook the shredded carrots a bit once the beef was browned and let the hot beef mixture wilt the cabbage a bit before serving to make it more kid friendly.  Will add some broccoli slaw to the mix next time to up the veggie factor.  Served with some homemade gyoza.  Definitely going into the regular rotation.

Dressing recipe gets 45 stars. I have made up a jar of it in the fridge. We did not care for this with the ground beef, but I as inspired by the ingredients to put something else together.  I too  used Napa Cabbage. I also used shredded carrots and a small bag of Brocolli Slaw mix from the grocery.  I shredded a whole head of cabbage, a whole head of iceberg, added 2 large shredded carrots, and the whole bag of brocolli slaw.  I put all of this in a huge Tupperware bowl and tossed it.  That way it's ready to grab and put in a bowl for dinner or to take in a smaller covered bowl for lunches.  Do not add the dressing til you are ready to eat it! I had angel hair pasta, so cooked some of that, ran under cold water and added to the salad at serving time along w/ sliced deli rare roast beef.  Also dropped on 1/2 oz sliced almonds and dried cranberries last night for dinner.  Having it again tonite with mandarine oranges.  IT's AWESOME not to have to cook and this is the first main dish salad that hubby (midwest meat-eater) actually complimented me on.  Adding to the regular weekly menue for the summer in Phoenix!

I had some ground beef that I wanted to use up when I came across this recipe. I'm glad I did because it was really good! I couldn't find napa cabbage at my local grocery store so I used the pre shredded cole slaw mix. It worked great but when I can find napa, I will try that. Only thing I wasn't sure of was if it was to be served cold or hot. I know, it's a salad but I tried it both ways and liked them both. I will make this again soon!  Thx KKH3!

The dressing is great! Switched out the ground beef for barbequed chicken marinaded in the dressing, by doubling the dressing and letting the chicken marinade for 1 hour.  Added red pepper for color and extra crunch.  Instead of pepper pepper flakes used sciracha

Pretty darn good!! Super easy and something different to eat. I added Asian mustard to my dressing, which gave it a little kick. Definitely double the dressing recipe when preparing. It was even good the next day since the cabbage was thick enough to withstand the dressing; just give it a toss. I used the napa cabbage, but I think regular green cabbage would work too. Perhaps next time I'll use flank steak... Cold ground beef was a little strange, but totally doable.

I think the dressing deserves 5 stars.....yum!  I had some leftover grilled london broil slices I needed to use, so I used that instead of the ground beef (cut into small pieces).  I also used a whole pound of pasta.  Because of the extra pasta, I had to double the dressing (except I only used 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes).  Wow.  That dressing is addictive.  I think any Asian noodle dish with this dressing would be wonderful.  The salad itself is adaptable, I think, although I did enjoy the Napa cabbage, carrot, and green onion mix.  Will definitely use this again, maybe with chicken sometime, too.

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was just what I was looking for. We love the classic asian cabbage salad but wanted something along the same lines, but different. This had that tangy fresh crunch of the cabbage, but the beef and pasta gave it a chewy and hearty texture. I used a cole slaw mix for the cabbage and carrot combo, which made the recipe very easy. Great for a summer evening, we will definitely make this again- thanks for the recipe!

Thought this recipe was creative.  Hard to imagine this as an Asian dish.  However, If you want ground beef to somewhat work, it is wise to put some fresh ginger and a tbsp of soy into the meat for more flavor.  We like things with a kick so I also added a touch of red pepper flakes.  The sauce to top..Yes Double its the best part.

This is a regular of ours in the summer. It’s easy and delicious. I do cook the carrots to soften and substitute Splenda for the honey. My family all love it and it’s great when it sits for a day or two!

My husband and I, one of my kids, and the 2 friends that were supper guests enjoyed this meal a lot.  We tried it hot; al dente cooked cabbage and carrots.  My other child didn't like it.  We tried it again with tofu instead of beef plus double the veggies and everyone enjoyed it.

This dish was really good! I will definitely make this again. The only change was I added ginger to the soy sauce. Also, I added white onion to the beef along with soy sauce, chili flakes the salt and pepper for a little added flavor while it was cooking. I doubled the soy sauce because I thought it wasn't enough. Love this recipe!

I had leftover steak and was looking for a light way to use as leftovers. We sliced the beef into 1/4 inch cubes instead of hamburger.  it was delicious.  Light and flavorful.

This was a light and cool meal for a warm 
day, as I let the meat and noodles cool before adding everything together.  As others have said, the dressing is great!  I used ground turkey, as I usually do for every recipe calling for ground beef, and seasoned it with about 1/4 cup of chili garlic sauce while it cooked--yum!  I also used about 4 ounces of cooked, broken soba noodles instead of the shell pasta.  I will probably make this again, but I would make a bit more dressing next time.

A few drops of good quality Asian fish sauce (Thai nam pla, Vietnamese nuoc mam) bring the flavors together to make this recipe even better.

*Giving rating even though I made some changes*
Im tired of the same old stuff so I googled pasta and hamburger recipes...ended up choosing this. Made tonight. We couldnt decide if we liked it or not! I did double hamburger, used a whole pound of shells, and doubled sauce. Bought angel hair shredded cabbage(green;no nappa) and pre-grated carrots(cut down on prep). Totally reminded me of the filling in an egg-roll. If I make again I will make sure to drain burger really well; it was a little greasy. Definitely different. Maybe I should have followed to a T?!

I will make this again with all kinds of little tweaks! I made this with fresh shredded zucchini in place of cabbage and added some thinly sliced yellow bell pepper which complimented the tang in the dressing. I doubled everything, the mild flavor was so yummy, thanks!
