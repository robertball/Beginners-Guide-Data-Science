I'm a bartender and when I saw this recipe I thought I'd share a tip or two for everyone.  I've been using limeade as a sour mix substitute for years because it's just so simple and always on hand.  If you add a half oz of OJ to the original recipe, it's even better.  Plus, it never hurts to add the juice of a lemon or lime as it's blending.  You can even do a half oz of Chambord or Grand Marnier "float" after you've poured them (Chambord is delish!!).  Or, add some fresh or frozen fruit to the original recipe and make fruit margaritas.  If you don't have fruit but have some flavored liquors at home, throw some in (sour apple pucker is very popular right now).  Easy recipe to work with and it's made many of my anti-tequila friends huge margarita fans.  Hope this helps.

I think this is the ONLY way to make blended margaritas! They taste SO MUCH better then those made with mix from the bottle!! 
One quick tip for easy measuring that I use- I dump the can of frozen limeade in the blender, fill the limeade can 3/4 full with tequilla and the remainder full (1/4) with the triple sec, pour that in then fill the blender with ice. Turn on the blender and let the party begin! Much easier then using a measuring cup. 
If this is too strong then simply fill the can half way with tequilla and add triple sec to make the can 3/4 full.

I've been making margaritas like this for a few years now.  Gold Tequila makes the best.  Sometimes I'll top a frozen one w/amaretto which gives a great flavor.  Also, try substituting Blue Curaco (also an orange liquor) for the triple sec to make a Blue Margarita.  Or to cut down on the alcohol just use plain fresh squeezed oranges instead of the triple sec.  There are lots of additions you can make - but nothing beats this margarita!

I make mine the same way!  Now that it is summer you HAVE to try this! Chunk up and de-seed about 2 to 3 cups of watermelon.  Freeze the watermelon and add with the ice when making these margaritas. Freezing is key to keeping the drink a good thick frozen consistancy.  Also, you can de-seed then puree and freeze in ice cube trays for later use. Just pop them in a zipper bag to keep fresh tasting. These will be the hit at your BBQ or next party!

I loved this recipe!  It only took a minute to make a batch, and they taste just as good as the ones served in mexican restaurants. I used Grand Marnier in place of the Triple Sec.  The limeade mix is cheaper and better than those Bacardi mixers.  I plan to keep the freezer stocked with a few limeades so anytime we have guests we can quickly whip up these yummy drinks!

I made these on Father's Day and the women LOVED them (the men were mostly hard core beer drinkers).  These margaritas got rave reviews.  I wasn't too sure about filling the blender with ice but if you don't you won't get the right consistency (slushy).  I also measured the tequila and Triple Sec with a measuring cup to get it just right.  Not too tart and not too sweet, they are very smooth, easy to make, and they kept well in the refrigerator as well. EVERYONE asked for the recipe. Perfect for a warm afternoon outside.

I make mine with 6 oz pineapple juice concentrate, 6 oz limeade concentrate, 1 cup tequila, 1 cup triple sec, ice and a blender.  They are the best original margaritas around! The pineapple takes the twang out of the limeade.  For strawberry margaritas use 8 oz frozen strawberries in juice, 4 oz frozen limeade concentrate, 6 oz tequila, 2 oz triple sec, ice and a blender is all you need.

These are the best margaritas!  They are so much better than those made with the mixes, and much cheaper too.  These are so good my friends and I now have margarita Thursday at my house.  Goes great with chips and salsa!

I rated this years ago.  It was the top rated review but it mysteriously dissappeared so I'll try again.  Ever since I found this recipe my search for the perfect Margarita has ended!  In my former life I spend many, many years bartending in a popular restaurant know for it's signature drinks.  Despite that experience I struggled to duplicate a decent margarita at home.  I didn't have the secret spice mix, none of the (expensive) mixes out there even came close, and messing with all of those limes and sugar was, well, a mess!  Search no more folks, this is sooo easy and makes the perfect Margarita to boot.  Ialways add a splash of O.J. to the blender.  To make it "golden" sub Gran Marnier or Cointrau (sp?) or a combo of both for the Triple Sec.  In the summer I often replace half of the ice with frozen chunks of watermelon and it is devine!  If you prefer your margarita on the rocks, cut the recipe with 1/2 h20, put in a shaker with ice, shake shake shake and pour into your ice filled glass.

I've been making these for a few years the exact same way except I use simply limeade in the clear plastic jug in the fresh OJ aisle instead of frozen concentrated limeade. The only difference is simply limeade uses sugar instead of high fructose corn sugar used in most frozen limeade. Either way, these are great. Also, you can splurge and use Cointreau instead of Triple Sec for a "Deluxe" version of this cocktail.

I have been making this for a while now and everyone loves it.  However recently we went to an Italian Rest.; and had an Italian Margarita and now have changed it a little.  What I now do is use the can of limeade; then use 1/2 can water; 1/2 can - ok - maybe a little more of tequila; almost 1/2 a can of triple sec or a good Orange liquire; then I mix in a blender with no ice.  Pour into a salt rimmed glass over ice; and then add 1 shot of Ameratto to the glass.  WOW- it sure does knock it up a noch and is super good.   Thanks so much for this recipe.    - PS -  you can use Kosher Salt instead of 'Margarita Salt'  its easier to find and cheaper.

Note to author: This is the identical recipe I use for Margaritas! Couple suggestions: In addition, try pouring 6 oz. of any old beer (lager style preferred) in there. It mellows the tartness of the limeade and smooths the whole mix out nicely. Also, try replacing triple sec with Grand Marnier. Mmm Mmmm Mmmmm!

I have been making these margaritas for over 20 years!  Love them!  I do want to throw in here stat I add a TBS of granulated sugar.  If I want to make strawberry, I use the frozen sliced strawberries (for smoothies) and cut down on the ice.  And if you are wanting to make a "kid" batch, just substitute the tequila and triple sec with orange juice.  They love to have a cocktail too!

This is a tasty and easy recipe that rivals the margaritas at the Mexican restaurants. Do use a good quality tequila. If you don't it will taste too "boozy". Pay a little more and you won't be disappointed. Can't wait to try these out on my friends at our next girls night.

What an amazingly simple recipe! My friend and I have tweaked the recipe a bit (after lengthy trials  :-)   and now add the juice from 1 lime to it. We also prefer Cointreau or Grand Mariner over triple sec, but I would use triple sec if it was the only thing I had on hand. It's more important that you have a margarita, right?! We are now known for our great Margaritas! Thank you!

My family has been using this recipe for over three decades and it's always been a hit.  Only difference, we've always used a teaspoon of sugar or two instead of triple sec - not a big difference.  Also, we usually call them "drunk margaritas," because you can make them well, even when you're drunk. Since we use the 6 oz. can of limeade, you just dump that over the ice in the blender, then fill the limeade can with tequila then add the sugar.  Trust me, these are fool-proof, and you really can make them perfectly even when you're drunk. (Though maybe you wouldn't really notice.)

Easy, less expensive & pretty good...I just think the Triple Sec kinda overpowers a little & brings out the "limeade" flavor a bit too much...Tastes much better with just 1 ounce Triple sec......

Perfection! So easy and so good -- you don't really taste the tequila because it's nice and smooth. You just get that wonderful tequila aroma, and then after a couple of these, you all of a sudden have trouble standing! I used about 1 tray of ice for 1 can of limeade. Rimming the glasses is a must -- just rim half the glass if you're not sure what your guests prefer. I can't wait to have Margarita Parties in the summer! Thanks!!

If you're really intent on using the can for ease of purpose, then do it this way to get it right: fill the can full with tequila, dump that in and then fill it 1/3 full with triple sec. Tada! Instant recipe and the ratio really is good.

Really good! I added water because I made mine on the rocks. Really good and way better than with the bottled mix.

These margaritas are the best I've ever made, and I've tried many recipes. Make sure you put ice right to the top of the blender or else the limeade will make it taste too bitter. Also make sure you blend it long enough so that it's more of a slushy constistency than snow cone consistency. And to serve, use a margarita glass, cut a lime in half and run the cut part over the edge of the glass, then dip the rim in salt and garnish with half a lime slice. Perfection.

Easy and GOOD! For the person who said they prefer margaritas on the rocks, so do I, no need to blend, just mix together and pour over ice, excellent!

I have made this same margarita recipe  for more than 25 years, time tested.. most Mexican restaurant Margaritas can't even compare to this one!  If you want to kick it up a a few notches, use Gran Marnier instead of triple sec.. amazing!!!!

they were OK.  I did add some splenda as they were pretty tart.  I guess i like mine on the rocks versus blended.  if you like blended, then give this recipe a try.

I do the same exact thing here in this recipe but I also add Patron orange liqueur about 1 oz. I cut up some lime slices and use one to squeeze on the rim before adding sea salt to the rim and then put a lime wedge either on the rim or inside the drink for added lime flavor and it rocks!!!

This is the way my husband (a bartender when we met) has made margaritas for as long as I've known him--20+ years.  They're awesome!!  2 things I would add: one, it's definitely worth it to use a good tequila (Cuervo Patron is our fav) and two, a good blender that makes the margaritas smooth (no chunks of ice left behind!) is a must.  Right before the 30th surprise party my husband threw for me our blender crapped out (we'd burned out several--and not surprisingly, they almost always went at the end of summer.  ;)  He went to a restaurant supply store and purchased a commercial blender.  It wasn't cheap, but I'm now 43, and it's still making awesome margaritas--and I'd wager to say we've served hundreds. Thanks, Katherine, for getting this great margarita recipe out there.  :)

Truly the best margaritas we've ever made around here!  I make it just as directed (only occasionally adding a *bit* more booze, depending on my company!), and it is perfect!  The splash of orange juice comment is good, if you like the drink sweeter.  I now stock up on limeade when I find it cheap just for this recipe!  Everyone loves these!

Perfection! My huband and I used to go to this chain Tex-Mex place 2 or 3 times a week! Food so-so but the margarita's were to die for! Sadly, restaurant closed and I never could find that fantastic margarita again. Well guess what? This is it! Made it exactly to recipe, loaded the salt on the rim (what can I say, I like salt) and presto! Perfect Margarita! Thank you!! Trying out at party tomorrow night. Can't wait for the reviews!!

These Margaritas are truly a hit.....I have made them at several parties and they have recieved RAVE reviews from everyone.  This recipe is WONDERFUL!!  A lot of my friends use the bottled margarita mixers...once I let them in on this recipe..they are through with that stuff.  I have branched out to start adding frozen fruit such as strawberries and peaches.....DELISH!!  Thank you so much for this recipe...you have made me the Margarita Queen.

Finally found the perfect mix.... the 2 ounces of triple sec make all the difference!  Though a floater of Grand Marnier doesn't hurt either.  Thank you for making ME the one that everyone remembers for the fabulous margaritas!

This is the closest I've ever been able to get to the margaritas that I get at a Mexican restaurant. This recipe is a keeper for me!! I recommend using 3/4 of a container of limeade instead of the whole 6 oz, it was a little too sweet when we used the whole container.

These were so easy to make!  Just as easy as buying the mix but tasted so much better!  I got many compliments on these at my girls' night out.

These were really good margaritas. I think they're pretty sweet, but I think margaritas in general isn't something that I can personally drink all night long. I had a party though and my one cousin took care of the pitcher! I will for sure make these again for guests. And maybe do some tweeking next time to see if I can make it a little less sweet. Great & easy recipe though for sure!

OMG! My husband loves Margaritas and he absolutely loved this recipe.  We did modify it a bit since we thought it was just a bit too strong and he likes them strong. One pitcher isn't enough so we doubled the recipe, to double it  I used 2 12 oz cans of limeade, 2 1/2 cups of Hornitos tequila and 3/4 cup triple sec.  It also makes a difference in what type of tequila you use.  My niece told me about rimming the glass with sugar vs salt and by my surprise that is very good.

Well, my husband, who fancies himself a "Margarita Master" and has been loyal to his father's famous recipe forever, really liked these MUCH easier frozen margaritas!  So did I!  The limeade does NOT make them overly sweet or "kiddy"-like.  They are just sweet enough.  Oh, try using Cointreau in lieu of the Triple Sec for a real "Cadillac" of a margarita.  GREAT--either way. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the 2nd time I've made these now and they are awesome!  Be sure to use minute maid limeade and for more tartness and color, add a little red wine or sangria on top!

So good and so easy. Can't seem to find 6-oz containers of limeade any more so, darn it, I'm forced to use the 12-oz container and double everything else. Also add a few ounces of fresh orange juice. After blending without ice, pour into a pitcher and keep in the refrigerator.  Then when making a drink just add ice to the blender and whatever amount you want of the mix.  Great for unexpected guests or just me enjoying the evening garden!

Preferred ratios of tequila : orange liquor : lime juice aside, any recipe that doesn't use fresh squeezed lime juice won't taste right.  

Also, most triple sec is mostly corn syrup or sugar.  Use Cointreau, Grand Marnier or any orange liqueur or triple sec that has at least 30% alcohol.

Fabulous! It would be 4 stars as shown, but 5 stars for how we did it.  Made as directed but included a couple of additional suggestions from Cooper: added a scoop of frozen pineapple concentrate to the mix and then floated a tiny bit of Grand Marnier on top.  As good as - no, better than! - any margarita I've ever had. (Making it as shown was a bit too sour for us - the pineapple was the perfect antidote. OJ would be good too but I didn't have that on hand.)  It was a verrrrry good party!  :)

I do not like blended margaritas so I'm wondering if I should try adding some water so it's not so syrupy(half and half with the limeade concentrate?).  I've tried a version of this with Simply Limeade (bottle of ready to drink limeade) but it was way too watered down.

So easy and tasty, a real hit! I also did as one person suggested and filled the limeade container 3/4 with tequila and 1/4 with triple sec. Then filled the blender with crushed ice last and voila, fantasticness!

Made this recipe for my New Years eve party. Used generic frozen limeade concentrate and 1800 Tequila Reposada. Only made one change - substituted Triple Sec with Grand Gala (Italian version of Grand Marnier). Liquid gold! Wasn't too strong but not weak either. ;)

I have been making Margaritas very similar to this for some time now. I found myself with no good limes one hot day while I was making Tacos...GASP RIGHT!! ha I always have lime aid in the freezer so....walla...The best frozen Margarita was born. I use about a Tablespoon or less of sugar per-pitcher and prefer just a splash of or no triple sec. I use 4 oz Tequila, 1/3 can frozen lime aid, sugar to taste up to 1 tablespoon, splash of triple sec (or none), 2 cups of ice. Place all  in that order in a blender. Puree until smooth...Everyone loves these. Now go get out on the deck on a nice hot day and ENJOY!

Usually I make "original" margaritas with freshly squeezed lime juice, but needed something quicker for a party. I was glad I picked this recipe! It was so easy and the margaritas are wonderful!!! I did not fill the blender with ice all the way to the top with the first batch (was afraid it would overflow), and the margaritas were too strong. The following batches were perfect. Recommend making before the guests arrive (especially if your blender is really loud), put in a plastic jug and put in the ice in your beverage tub. It keeps better than you would expect. Make sure you buy enough limeade! Would recommend to calculate 1 batch per every 4 guests, more if there are no other beverages (we used up 4 batches for 18 people, despite offering also wine, beer, and non-alcoholic drinks)

This is very similar to my gpa's recipe that was a family Christmas tradition. He had a great way of measuring, 1 can limeade, 1/2 can tequila, 1/3 can triple sec. Add a splash of orange juice and half a lime, rind and all in the blender, and it brings back all those Christmas celebrations with him!

Great margarita recipe! I added frozen berries to the recipe, but liked the original recipe better. Nothing like a cold margarita on a hot day and this recipe hits the spot.

This is the same recipe I've made for years.  I don't care much for frozen drinks so I double the recipe and add as much ice as the blender will hold.  A little goes a long ways!

This is a good recipe but if you want to make it better try using Grand Marnier in place of the triple sec,  this makes it a "TOP SHELVE" Margarita!

These taste just like the margaritas you get from the Mexican restaurant!  We made them blended and on the rocks and we liked them on the rocks better!  Added the juice of a lime when making them on the rocks and upped the triple sec by one shot!  Thanks for the recipe!

Defintely the best way.  Been doing it for years and people always comment about mine being the best.  I dump out about a fourth of the limeade though so the tartness/sweetness is not overwhelming.  1 cup teq., 1/4 cup trip. sec, as much ice as you can get in blender until it stops moving, then pour a little water in if necessary to get it barely moving again.  Salt on rim and lime wedge.  As 'Cajun Man' would say, "perfecshone!"

I was nervous to try to make margaritas without the ole trusty margarita mix -- but did it (even with company over!) and was so impressed. Were VERY good, and am happy to say i will NOT be buying the mix any more!! Great tasting, very easy....

Man, this recipe has nailed it. These margaritas are perfect every time. I make it when company comes over, and I've even doubled and tripled the recipe (mixed in separate batches), poured it into my gallon-sized tupperware pitcher, and brought it to pool parties and bbqs. They get rave reviews every time, and people are always amazed by the simplicity of the recipe. 
This is a definite winner!

I agree with the addition of orange juice and fresh lime juice! Also, if you reduce the limeade and add a container of fresh raspberries, it makes a delicious raspberry margarita!!

This is an all around great margarita. We use this recipe at the pub I work in for about 12 years now and its foolproof. I add many things like the first poster said to change it up a bit.Very versatile to use. I make it double strength for home and freeze it and make a shush to add to more limeade. I love to add some fresh mint as well, and I zest an orange and add that as well. Skies the limit with this one. You can definately make it your own.

Wow!  I just made this to try it for future parties.  I scaled everything back for just one drink.  1 oz limeade, 1 oz tequila and a splash of triple sec.  Poured it over crushed ice and I am in heaven!  Thank you so much for such a delicious and easy recipe!

A-MAZE-ING!  Yum YUM!  I took the bartender's suggestion and added the half oz. oj and some fresh squeezed lemon juice.  This is a very refreshing drink.  I don't think I can go back to mixes.

As written would be too strong for me but is very good.  We did the recipe but added 12oz limeade instead of 6.  Don't add too much ice or it will be too cold to drink without getting a brain freeze.

These are good but sweet.  I add a 1/2 bottle of beer to the blender.  It adds some fizz and cuts the sweetness as well. I know it sounds strange but I've gotten nothing but RAVE reviews!!!

I've been making a version of this recipe for years, and everyone loves it.  So much better than the bottled mixes!  If you don't have triple sec on hand, fresh orange juice works well.  Also, try it with a couple splashes of beer, and rim the glasses with fresh lime before dipping in salt.  Yummy!

These were great.  I will defiantly try mixing some other things in them and play with this recipe.  The original recipe is fine all by itself.  I would recommend it to anyone and will be making this again real soon.

My margaritas have always been awful, and that's sad, considering I'm from Texas. Never did like the cloying taste of bottled margarita mix. This recipe, however, is wonderful. Also, a bartender made some suggestions on what you could add to make it even better, which I did -- cointreau, OJ, a can of diet 7-up, and oddly? A bit of rum.

This recipe is about as easy as they come -- with my regular Kitchen Aid blender I don't even crush the ice first. These Margaritas are not too sweet, not too tart, and they will get rave reviews from your friends! What more could you ask for in a drink?!? This recipe is a keeper.

Perfect!  This is the first margarita recipe that I've tried, but I don't think I need to look any further!  I enjoyed this slushy, slightly tart, and just-sweet-enough concoction with tortillas and salsa.  It was better than the restaurant margaritas I've tried. It was tastier than a prepackaged mixer without any extra work.  Omit the tequila and triple sec and add a splash of orange juice for an alcohol-free treat that can be enjoyed by everyone!

For years now I've been buying the Jose Cuervo mix in the supermarket for almost $7.00 a bottle, and it doesn't come CLOSE to tasting as good as this very simple recipe!  The secret is filling the blender with ice, and then the addition of the frozen limeade concentrate makes it the perfect consistency for a blended margarita.  This tasted authentic, and exactly like the drinks I have ordered and enjoyed from Mexican restaurants.  I am hooked on this recipe now!  Great, delicious, easy to make, and much cheaper than a premade mix - I'll never make margaritas any other way again.

This is a recipe I have used forever.  I was glad to see someone else uses it as well.  It is always a hit at parties!  For over the rocks just add a bit of water instead of ice (it ends up tasting a bit stonger).

This recipe is top notch!  I was very skeptical at first because the recipe seemed too simple.  They were the best magaritas i've ever had.  Every homemade margarita i've ever tried to make has turned out bad.  You cannot mess this one up.  You might want to play around with the ingredients based on how sweet and how strong you want it.  I added a little more tequila and some sugar to mine.  I will make these from now on when I have parties.  Not only are they delicious, but much cheaper than ones you get at restaurants!

This totally kicked butt!  I used Cointreau instead of Triple Sec, though, and my container of limeade concentrate was bigger than 6 oz - it was more like 10 oz.  The drink is pretty powerful - if I were making it for a party, I'd scale back a bit further on the booze so that my guests wouldn't be snockered within a drink or two!  We had this along with enchiladas and mexican baked red rice for a delicious cinco de mayo dinner.

These margaritas are fantastic!  I am so glad I had a chance to try this recipe because I love the mexican people and their traditional drink is so flavorful and so good and I think I'm drunk right now but the taste was wonderful and so wonderful.

I'm very picky about my margaritas and I don't usually drink frozen margaritas. But these were Soooo tasty and super easy to make! From now on, I will definitely keep frozen limeade in my freezer for the purposes of making these margaritas.

You also need 6 ounces of beer, and change the triple sec to 6 ounces.  That makes it perfect.  If you can find the 6 ounce can of limeade, dump the limeade in, then refill the can with the last three ingredients because they are all 6 ounces.

I made 3 batches of this drink, put them in a covered plastic bucket (Ice cream container) and stuck them in the freezer, thinking they would last all weekend with my relatives around. We scooped them easily into Margarita glasses right out of the freezer. Ha!  We ended up making more and everyone wanted the easy recipe for themselves.   Very yummy, very simple and better than any bottled Margarita I've tried.  A keeper and this summer's go to cool off drink.

Everyone said they loved this margarita! It had that nice bite that you get from a restaurant drink. I used Simply Lime (not from concentrate/not frozen) Limeade. I also added 2 ounces of orange juice. Blended this in the Margaritaville blender, and garnished with limes and oranges... perfect :-) I also used it as a base for the strawberry margaritas. I used the same proportions, but instead of tequila, I used strawberry rum, and  added frozen strawberries (and garnished with a strawberry). Our guests were quite impressed!

Mexico in a glass YUM YUM YUM - i sprinkle salt inside with the blender instead of putting it on the rim of the glass (not as messy). I haven't seen a 6 oz can of limeade though :P these just taste sooooo good! I would never attempt to find another recipe anywhere else because this is just perfect.

For ease and speed you can’t beat it, but you can tell it wasn’t made with fresh limes which I prefer.  It’s still very refreshing, just don’t skimp on the crush ice.

Loved it! For me, this is the perfect margarita recipe. I used Grand Marnier instead of Triple Sec. I find Triple Sec to be pretty crappy and far too sweet. I'd just rather not have it in my cocktails. It is really delicious in a big margarita glass lined with salt. This will be my go to margarita recipe now. Thanks for sharing!

Instead of triple sec, use Grand Marnier!  And always use 100% agave tequila and a squeeze of lime.  You'll never go back to any other margarita!

Such a simple recipe for great margaritas!  I was skeptical, but they are definetly good!  I did reduce the tequila to 5 oz. because I prefer not to fall down after two margaritas.  I also used 4 cups of crushed ice.  It was the perfect combination.

Fantastic! This is the best margarita I have ever had, and that includes the trip I took to Mexico.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the fact that I added fresh lime and orange juice and used cointreau instead of triple sec.  Even squeezing the fruit and rimming glasses with salt, the use of limeade made this really simple and fast.  I had four frosty, wonderful margaritas in peoples hands in just over five minutes.  Incredible recipe.

I like the limeade idea as I have used it for years, sans the triple sec.  I take 1 small can of limeade, pour over blender full of ice, then fill that same can with tequila pour in the blender, then fill that same can with BEER.  Comes out perfect!

Great recipe!  I took the suggestion of adding a half ounce of orange juice and fresh lime juice.  Also used the suggestion of using the limeaide container for measuring  -- a less than 3/4 full of tequilla and 1/4 of the container of triple sec.  Perfect!

These are fabulous!  I mix two cans of water with the limeade, a spoon of orange juice concentrate and two fresh squeezed limes.  Then pour it all into my ice cream freezer.  You have never tasted anything so good!  It's like they came out of a margarita machine!

I tried this yesterday because it sounded so simple and got great reviews. Wow! It was a diffrent take that is for sure. I did the second batch with a bit less teq. and added some fesh lime juice and a little bit of sugar, 1 Tbs. It makes it so they are not as strong. Its flavor is a world of diffrence from the store bought mixer!

Because this recipe was so simple, I was thinking these margaritas would probably be good, but not great. They were fantastic! Thanks to KDA949 for the great advice to measure the tequila and triple sec using the limeade container. These could not have been any easier to make and everyone at my party loved them!

Catherine,
These margaritas were fantastic!  I made a surprise welcome home party for my best friend Lori. I decided to have an Island theme, and keeping with the theme, I thought I would try this recipe.  Everyone raved about them.  Thanks again Catherine for this wonderful recipe!!!!

These are good but I do add a tablespoon of sugar sometimes 2.  At least after a few drinks the next batch won't get stronger like they did in the past when I made Margaritas.

I am rating this ONE for the sole purpose of we made these to a T and they didn't taste good at all.  We even threw it all out and started over and it was still not good, very bitter in fact.  Maybe it was the kind of Tequila we used.  Any suggestions of what we could have done wrong?  My hubby LOVES margaritas!

I'm always looking for good "clone" recipes for my favorite things. I'm not a big frozen margarita fan, but love a good margarita on the rocks. I found the frozen limeade mix at Kroger, the Kroger brand, and it was in 12oz. can's. I doubled the recipe with a good blanco tequila and cointreau instead of triple sec. I added about 3 1/2 cans of filtered water in the limeade container. I added a splash of orange juice to finish it. It is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! I would have never imagined! I am totally sharing this recipe with family and friends. SO glad to have found this recipe and tweaked it for my liking ??

I have been looking for a simple margarita recipe and this is the one!! It is absolutely delicious. The change I made, per reviewers suggestions, is I used Grand Marinier instead of triple sec.  My daughter is training to be a bartender and she said it was as good as the one they make at the Country Club where she is working for summer.  Thank you for posting it.

Have been making margaritas this way for over 25 years.  All of our guests love them, and so do we!  Easy to play around with using other fruit----such as watermelon!  Use a melon baller, and freeze the watermelon.  When you make the margaritas, the frozen watermelon acts as the ice cubes, too.  [Will probably need to add some sugar or Splenda if watermelon isn't too sweet.]

These were wonderful! A little strong for our taste, as written, so when we made a second batch we put 2 oz. less tequila and it was great. Floated a shot of Blue Curacao on top - amazing! :)

I used regular ice cubes since I don't have crushed, and it turned out fine.  These are the only margaritas I've had so far, so I can't compare them to others or fully judge, but they were pretty good, and soooo easy.

Wow-tastes like it came from a professional bartender! I also tried it "on the rocks" rather than frozen-equally great. Outstanding-a keeper-thank you for sharing!!

I thought these were good, but my husband and I found them to be too syrupy or sugary with the lime concentrate. I also added some frozen peaches to tone it down. I think I'll try fresh lime juice next time. Thank you!

Super easy and great tasting. I used another person's suggestion and filled the limeade container 3/4 with tequila and 1/4 of triple sec.

best margarita I've ever had! My husband made this for us. We're celebrating cinco de mayo (just another excuse to drink...lol) and thought we'd festively have these. YUM! Dangerously good.

These were great margaritas.  Don't know what I can say that already hasn't been said except I didn't think they were to sweet -matter of fact I added a little more triple sec.

This was an amazing margarita using the tip from Cooper. We added a little shot bottle that was $1.25 at the liquor store (didn't want to buy a whole bottle) to the blender and it made all the difference in the world. Amazing!

This recipe is awesome!  It makes a lot, so when I have leftovers, I just stick it in the freezer.  Later, I take it out and eat it with a spoon for dessert.  This is a fun and easy recipe!

I attempted to make this on the rocks, because that is how I prefer my margaritas.  Not bad!  I doubled the contents of limeade, triple sec, and tequila.  In place of ice, I used water (filled the limeade container twice).  It turned out well, but seemed to be missing  something so I added lemon juice (did not have lime on hand) for more of a sour taste, and then topped with Grand Marnier!  Definitely worth it :)

We love this recipe - we make it at least 3-4 times per month. We make a double batch and take it to the pool in a pitcher and keep it in the cooler. Great drink, thanks for the recipe.

Very simple to make and our friends did like them.  Usually have the tequila and triple sec on hand.  Next time I will use some O.J. or splenda to see if there is a difference.

For the longest time I wouldn't drink tequila until I had a margarita at a friends house. This recipe is great and I really enjoyed it. I know many reviews added OJ to cut the tart/flavor but my friend used 2 frozen strawberries to do the same thing, I did this with this recipe. It does change the color but it was fantastic.

The basic concept is 5 star, and if you use good liquor you get a truly restaurant quality margarita. As stated, I thought the ratio of limeade to alcohol was a little off and ended up adding more tequila and ice. I got a "Margarator" as a gift last Christmas, and I highly recommend it. The texture is snowy and perfect.

We listened to the 'bartender' and added about 2 oz. (by mistake) of Orange Juice and these margaritas were to die for!!  Seems like the OJ took the bitterness away from the limeade.  Beat any restaurant margaritas in town by a long shot!  Thanks for the tip.

Too sweet. Lacks dimension. You could lick the limeade can and not taste the difference. One reviewer added OJ and I think I will try that next time.

This recipe is a huge hit at parties!  A great alternative to using those chemical-tasting margarita mixes!  Sometimes this recipe is too sweet for my taste so I add some natural orange juice to thin out the margarita both in consistency and sweetness.  Also, if you don't have Triple Sec on hand, Grand Marnier is a great substitute

I had a margarita and fajita themed birthday party for my son's 3rd birthday party.  Tired of the same old pizza and cake routine, I decided to make fajitas and margaritas, so that all the grown-ups could enjoy themselves too! This margarita recipe was fantastic and a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly and added some fresh lime juice and an ounce of OJ for those that wanted margaritas on the rocks.  I also made several frozen batches with whole fresh mango chunks blended in, finished with a Chambord float on top, like one reviewer mentioned.  It was amazing!  The margaritas went well with the Avocado, Tomato and Mango Salsa on this site. Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent and easy!  I used 1/2 Tequila and 1/2 Triple Sec and added the juice and pulp of one lime (reamed).  Made these in my slushy maker and WOW!  I need look no further. NOTE - do read the review by Cooper4 for some GREAT ideas how to change this up to a blue 'rita, or a fruit 'rita!   My freezer is full of limeade and I'm ready to let summer 2009 begin!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These margaritas are the BOMB and SO easy to make. I bought a margaritaville frozen concoction machine recently and wanted to take it down to my sister's for our annual 4th of July party at her house by the beach. I searched for a recipe and found this one. I am so glad I picked this one, because these were a huge hit at the party! I ended up being the bartender for the night and made batch after batch of these delicious drinks. Some people thought the limeade a bit too tangy so I used 1/2 the can of limeade and squeezed a tad of fresh lime in the mix. They were perfect!! This will be the drink now for our 4th of July party from now on!

I have been making margaritas with a very similar recipe for 20 years so I was shocked when I saw this.  However, I use a 12 oz can of limeade and mix in the tequila and triple sec on a 2:1 ratio.  Depending on how strong your like your tequila I've made them with 1/2 C tequila, 1/4 C triple sec all the way up to a full cup of tequila.

This recipe is a must have!!! Instead of using the frozen limeade, I have made them with frozen mexican fruit juices located at the corner mexican market. Parcha/passion fruit is absolutely amazing! Everyone loves them! Also try using Jose Cuervo Citrico..it's a cheap tequila but with the passion fruit, you can't even taste a trace of it.

It's ok. I don't think that concentrated limeade comes anywhere close to the taste of real lime juice.

These things are GOOOOOOOd youll never regret making them,  I followed the bartender's review and added a half oz of OJ to the original recipe.  To top it off I swirled a half oz of Chambord on top!  I couldnt find Limeade, so I used a Bacardi Mixer from the freezer isle

Wow! These margaritas were delicious.  I'm rather picky about my margaritas, but I really liked this one and so did everyone else.  We ended up making 2 batches.  Rimmed the glasses with kosher salt - great summer drink.

There was just something funny tasting about these, the limeade flavor was really strong and not at all like what margaritas taste like to me.  I made this two nights and just couldn't get the flavor right, even following the directions exactly.  Maybe I will try it again using Contrieu instead of Triple Sec, and maybe using a frozen sour mix instead of limeade.  I definitely won't make it again as written.

Absolutely perfect! I have been trying to find a comparable recipe for frozen margaritas I found everywhere on the Las Vegas Strip - particularly "Fat Tuesday's" - these are doing the trick!  I'm making them in the middle of winter in Toronto - I can't wait to have them in the summer around the pool!

This is the recipe I use for my Margaritas, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS: I add 1 can/bottle of beer at the very end. Becareful when blending in the beer, use quick little zaps because you do not want this to foam up. When I tell friends what my "secrete ingredient" is, there amazed because they can't taste the beer, but it does add a nice flair to the drinks!

Four stars for flavor.  But, duh, these are FROZEN Margaritas!  The flavor was probably dulited after micro-waving to turn the slush to liquid, but they were still pretty good.  And I will try again to use the recipe for on-the-rocks.  (Which is, BTW, the only way to go.)

If you like TGI Fridays margaritas, you will LOVE these.  TGI Fridays is my favorite margarita place.  I've been looking for a recipe that was similar for a long time.  The secret is the Limeade (which Fridays uses as well).  YUMMY!!!!

These are by far, the easiest and best tasting margaritas I've ever made at home.  My limeade never goes bad, like my limes used to.  I'm always ready to serve these whenever I have guests over.

VERY good recipe.  I served them for a gourmet club "Cinco de Mayo" party, and they were a hit!  I didn't tell them it was a limeade concentrate until they had polished off every drop!

So easy!  I should have chopped the ice first.  When I put the cubes in the blender, the bottom was slush and the top was still hard cubes.  Otherwise, the whole drink was perfect!

So easy and delicious.
Be sure to crush the ice before blending if you have a cheap-o blender like I do, so you don't get huge chunks of ice. But the flavor was actually really great. Might try some agave nectar next time.
Also, a squeeze of fresh lime juice and maybe a splash of OJ really brightens it up and it's so much better than squeezing a million fresh limes for each drink! I've stocked up on a big quality bottle of the tequila I prefer, a big bottle of Cointreau and a few containers of brand name limeade concentrate, for the ease of it. I'm always on the front porch now that the weather's warm and it's always classy to be able to offer a cold drink. If you're not a margarita snob, definitely try this easy, yummy recipe!
This is my go-to margarita recipe if I'm feeling lazy. :)

We used to make these forty years ago, but we always added a juice can of water as well and put it in the freezer so it stayed nice and slushy. We did the same thing with 1 juice can of lemonade, 1 of whiskey, and one of water and called them Whiskey Sours. Way too sweet for me now, though.

All of our guests preferred these when they were made with 4 oz of tequila in lieu of the called for 6 oz.  With that modification, these would rate 5 stars from me.  These were very good and very easy to make.  No more pre-made mix for me!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Katherine!

Surprisingly wonderful!  This is so simple but delicious. I used Geand Marnier rather than triple sec nice I had it on hand.

I've used this recipe for years; it is great!  My son taught me a couple of tricks, which may sound odd, but do try them as they add a little something extra - add some beer to the blender and/or add a couple of spearmint leaves.  You will be amazed!

These are awesome!!  I have been looking for a margarita recipe that didn't use those horrible bottled mixes.  Finally found the perfect one!  Made these this afternoon for an outdoor party and they were the hit of the day! Never, ever will we use the bottled mixes again.  So good, and so easy!

Okay but not good. You can definitely tell it is made with limeade instead of fresh limes, it just tastes a little dingy.

LOVED THESE!  So easy, even a drunk can do it ;) I took the bartender's advice and added a little orange juice, but that's the only change I made.  I will never make another margarita.  My husband matched me skeptically, but he loved them as well.

I love making these for Cinco De Mayo Parties. I ad a little bit of powdered Sugar to the mix, and rim the glasses with the sugar too, so that they aren't so sour.

Awesome! I tried this on the rocks and added one cup of water to make up for it not being frozen.  Also- added a "Ms. Thang" twist with three squeezed orange wedges and a short splash of orange juice. Wow!! it was sooo good.  I cant wait to invite friends over to try.

Tasty. But might I suggest using Sauza blanco or gold tequila. It's the #1 selling tequila in Mexico. (I think that says alot!!!) It's really a great tequila.

I first tried this on New Year's eve at a party we went to.  Everyone loved them!  I have made them several times since.  This has to be the best margarita I have ever made.  I did add some orange juice to the mix like previously mentioned in another review.  About the same about as you add triple sec.  YUMMY!

This is a very good base line for a Margarita, I tried it with Watermellon and WOW what a treat on a hot summer day.
Just remember to remove the seeds after your had a couple :-}

This recipe is great.  I keep the ingredients handy for surprise guests or when I've had a hard day at the office.  Very good and super easy.

Tasty and foolproof!  I had never used limeade in a Margarita before, but I loved it.  Will make again.

I made this once using the exact recipe and it was great, but all the sugar from pre-made mixes sometimes gives me a headache... So, using the idea of limeade from this recipe, I decided to make fresh limeade to replace the frozen concentrate. I used the honey limeade recipe found here, to which I added about 2-3 tbs of fresh-squeezed orange juice. I first poured the liquor and then kinda eyeballed the amount of limeade, serving it on the rocks. It's a great alternative if you're feeling ambitious enough to go homemade once in a while.

Followed previous reviewer's advice and tweaked the recipe as follows.  I used the suggested amount of triple sec, but also added 1 oz Grand Marnier.  I also added 1 oz. Orange Juice and 3 oz. Beer. It really takes away the sour taste.  I also squeezed a lime into the blender.  Everyone at the party raved about these.  They went so fast that we had to run to the store to buy more ingredients!

The perfect summer drink. I prefer Cointreau instead of Triple Sec, add a generous squeeze of fresh lime to the blender, and be sure to use crushed ice. If you have a blood orange on hand, squeeze a 1/2 into the blender as well. This makes the prettiest party drink ever.

The best margarita I've ever had at home. I make mine on the rocks instead of frozen though. And I added a little orange juice and some fresh lime juice as well. Delicious!

I added 2 oz Rose's lime juice - PERFECT!!  I've been hunting for the right combination (I don't like the sour mix most places use) and this is it!!  A houseful of Mexicans agree!

Five star Margarita made simple! Like a previous reviewer, I am an ex bartender and have always been in search of a better Margarita. Using the limeade is such a great alternative to the sour mix. I made mine on the rocks and it is oh so perfect! Thanks Katherine!

I've never cared for margaritas. The few I've tried just tasted kind of nasty, so I had no interest in making them at home. Then, Cinco de Mayo 2007 came along... :) And, Katherine, you've changed my view on this fabulous drink! I made one batch with limeade (I cut the 12-oz can in half lengthwise and stuck the second half in a freezer bag, back in the freezer!) and used 1½ or 2 trays of ice cubes... Well, they were a little strong! The second batch somehow turned out stronger... Nice to drink while watching our daughter playing in her wading pool in 90-degree weather in early May! I also made a batch with pink lemonade instead of limeade and it turned out wonderful as well. Seriously, thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Katherine!

We make these quite often, they are wonderful!   I like to up the triple sec to 3 and the tequila to 4 or 5, a little less kick to it for me.  Adding frozen strawberries makes a tasty strawberry margartia.

YUMMY   I have been making these drinks for years and have always gotten loads of compliments.  Everyone says they are the best margaritas they have ever had and I have been asked for the recipe many times.  For strawberry margaritas add either fresh or frozen strawberries.  Mango margaritas can be made by adding a ripe peeled and pitted mango.  Your friends will tell you they are better than any bar margarita.  They are super easy, less expensive, and soooo much better.

STRONG!! All the guys at my party were laughing at how strong these were. I began adding more of the frozen limeaid and they were much better. I also added some frozen stawberries to some and those were a BIG hit! I will definately make these again!

I really love margaritas, and this recipe hits the spot! It tastes like other good margaritas I've had out on the town, but much cheaper! It was a cinch to blend up and is now my official margarita recipe!  It also refreezes well and is great right out of the freezer. It does get a little more sour and somewhat bitter when it melts, but some type of sugar or oj should help that.

I was using the "Barefoot Contessa" recipe for these.  These are much easier to make and taste soooo delicious, although I added 8 oz of tequila instead of 6 oz.  I only filled the blender 3/4 with crused ice.  Really hit the spot!

Was a little bitter for my taste, but I added just a little sugar and they were perfect for my taste.

Been using limeade for many years. Prefer on the rocks - so I make the limeade as directed on the can then add the liquors to a pitcher.   Also there is a liqueur called Gran Gala that is much less expensive than Grand Marnier or Cointreau. A slash of OJ or a splash of beer (yes, beer) also tastes yummy!

We love this recipe!  This is our go to Margarita.  Put everything in our Ninja blender and wa la and a great quick drink.   Beats the Barcardi mix and easier on the pocket book.

Wow this was great. I am not a huge tequila fan but I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth flavor. I will definitely use this again. For myself I might make it a little weaker but for company I am sure this will be a hit!!! Thanx  again for a great recipe.

Easiest and best margaritas ever! I cut back on the tequila and triple sec just for personal preference, and I also add a little agave syrup and the juice of one orange and a couple limes. I add the ice last and blend to a slush. YUMMY!

This recipe was AMAZING!! I don' think that I will try another recipe ever!  I was the right amount of flavor with the right amount of alcohol without being too much.  I made it straight, but you could easily add fruit if you choose.  Thanks!!

It has been hot this week in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and I decided to look up a margarita recipe to surprise my hubby and I came across this easy recipe.  So I ran to the grocery store first to get ingredients for fish tacos and then off to get the stuff for the margaritas.  It was difficult to find the salt for the rims! So while my husband was waiting for dinner I made him one of these margaritas and it sure put a smile on his face!  It really cooled things off!

So yummy and completely fool-proof!  I took suggestions and added only 5 shots of tequila and also the juice of one lime.  Also used Cointreau instead of triple sec and was great!

I love this very easy recipe.  We made in on vacation.  We added just a little more tequilla for a kick.

I've been using this recipe for years. I usually add 3 oz of triple sec. It makes it a little sweeter.

Like a few others said, they were a bit TOO strong. I don't like the tequila to overpower the drink, and this one did. Next time I'll use maybe 4oz. tequila, instead of 6. Love the limeade idea!

For a twist , I use Blue Curacao instead of Triple Sec (make sure you use clear tequila) and they come out a lovely blue color!

These were really good!  I added the juice of a fresh squeezed lime, which made them taste authentic.  NEVER use the pre-bottled margarita mix...it just doesn't compare!!!

Out of tequila, so we made with Gold Rum (not spiced), and we liked even better than a traditional margarita. These are very good, and as easy as prepared mixes that taste like    fake juice.

Made these for my fiance after a rough night at work, he loved them!  Said we'll definitely have to make these this summer when we're hanging around the pool.  I prefer mine fruity, so next time, I'll take his half out, and add some frozen strawberries to my half.  Thanks for the great margarita recipe!

Here's a secret...
shot of "margaritaville" tequila
4 count of sweet and sour
2 count of lime juice
2 count of triple sec
I make these all night and get paid for them:)

So good that my father-in-law (well known for his real-maragitas) asked for the recipe - he was very surprised  about how basic it was.

These were great and they couldn't be any easier to make.  I used a little less than the 6 ounces of tequila and used my smoothie machine to blend.  I will definitely be making these again and again.

Yes! Finally I can make a good margarita! I wouldn't let myself get my hopes up because I've followed recipes before but have always been disappointed. Not this time. I added a mango and they came out great. I can't wait to have company over to impress them with my great margaritas.

This was good, but we did the following to make it easy:  Put crushed ice in blender, poured in can of limeade, filled can with tequila and poured in, then filled can 1/2 way with triple sec (a little more than what it called for), and poured that it then hit the blender! Tasted GREAT! Thanks!

This was perfect and strong. I used Grand Mariner instead of triple sec. I will use this as the base for my margaritas from now on ... but I’ll invest in triple sec.

I didn't like this as it tasted too bitter.  It needed a touch of sweetness added to it, like lemonade or something. I used a reposado and Grand Marnier. I made a better mix myself by crushing lime slices and mint leaves, then adding ice, lime cordial, tequila, lemonade and a touch of soda water. This was just far too bitter and it was missing something that made it nice to drink.

I took the advice of measuring everything in the limeaide can and the taste was awesome! Fill the empty can three-fourths full of Tequila and then fill the rest of the can up with Triple Sec.  You can’t go wrong.

These are so good! We took our blender camping! Camping! That’s how good. Lol! I did notice a difference in taste depending on which brand limeade you use. Definitely pay the price and get the more expensive kind.

Making it as is is nice, flavorful and not too sweet. I think this one was easier to make than using the Bacardi mix because you have to add stuff to it. This is 3 simple ingredients, with variations available if you want a change of pace. Ain't broke, don't need fixin' my hubby says...just like in Mexico!

Always a crowd-pleaser for guests!  I've made these margaritas many times, and follow the recipe closely. If inclined, I'll add the juice of a lime (or two) and if I'm serving my mother-in-law, I'll generally add a few splashes of Sprite or Squirt. I love mine with a salted rim and a couple slices of fresh lime. Nothing better than sittting on your  patio on a warm, sunny day with one of these tasty concoctions in hand!

Super easy and sooo good.  Very adaptable to your personal tastes.  

For us, we used 6oz limeade, 4 oz tequila, 2oz triple sec, splash of OJ and 1tbsp sugar.  They were yummy!!

This is pretty much the only way I make margaritas now, it's so easy and tastes so much better than premade mixes. Add in a little squeeze of fresh lime to make it even better!

I'm probably made this at least 10 times by now

I thought the original recipe seemed like an awful large batch and I was only making these for two so, I halved the triple sec and limeade and used 4 ounces of tequila and filled the blender ¾ full of ice.  I added a couple pinches of fresh lime zest and they were AMAZING!  A little boozy, but not too strong, and the flavor was fantastic!

Made these using the limeade container to measure the tequila and triple sec. 3/4 full with tequila and the rest with triple sec. They came out perfect! Thank you for the easy recipe! My freezer is now stocked with limeade!! =))

Tasted better than the bottled mix versions but packs a punch. :). I bought a strawberry/banana smoothie to add in and it was delicious. I added a full beer (Modelo) to tone down the sweetness. Also bought guava and mango juice so whatever flavor you want goes with this recipe.  Will use a little less alcohol next time.

The honest-to-God BEST margaritas!! Be careful, they are dangerously addictive. So much better than any margarita mix, the limeade and triple sec are the perfect balance to the tequila.

I worked for Mexican restaurant and I thought they have the best margarita, butt I was in a bind with the neighborhood garage sale, so I run into the house and found this recipe, my jaws dropped and my neighbors where so delightful everyone keep asking for more.
   I just add and ounce of Grand Marnier and voila!!! that was Cadillac margarita

Fabulous. The only change we made was to reduce the amount of alcohol to 75% of the original amount. Everyone just raved about these!

These were good, but I still love my favorite when I'm drinking at home I like the "Master of Mixes" mix we buy in the grocery store!  I know... but it's good!

Very good.  Tossed half a lime into the blender along with the other ingredients and then strained the contents of the blender into margartia glasses.  Yum!

I loved this recipe. I love good margaritas, and the mixes they sell just do not cut it. This did not have the awkward taste that some mixes do. Even my husband thought it was good, and he hates mixed drinks. I used Miller Lite Chill, with the lime flavoring in it. Do not know if it helped for sure or not, but it didn't hurt.
