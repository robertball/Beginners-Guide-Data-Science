I have to admit that I didn't really like this soup to start. The flavors didn't really blend well and I had hoped that the kick from the jalapenos would be a little stronger. I left this in the fridge overnight and tried it again for lunch. The flavors begs to blend a little better and instead of blueberries I had garnished it with banana peppers. The kicked I wanted was there and it tastes amazing.

I used my nutri-bullet to blend.  I'd use 1/2 of a jalapeño pepper instead of a whole.  Also used 6 cups watermelon and 2 cups fresh peaches.  Delicious.

3.31.16  My jalapeño was large and very fresh, and I probably should have taken the ribs and seeds out.  This most definitely had a kick to it, and the flavor improves dramatically after refrigeration for several hours or even overnight.  We love gazpacho, and we enjoyed this.
