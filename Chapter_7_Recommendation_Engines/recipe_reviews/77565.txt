Great recipe!  Turned out perfect.  The reason another users came out runny was because it was not heated to the proper temp.  Sugar is a very tricky substance to work with so temp. is very important.  Too cool of temp makes it soft or runny and too hot will make it hard or crumbly!

I have been looking for this type of recipe for years!  I really don't like the "soft" fudge at all and all the recipes I have tried seem to produce that texture.  This is the one I was looking for exactly!  This fudge is often found at church bake sales.  THANK YOU so much for sharing!

This is really good candy & so easy. I guess I didn't cook the milk & sugar long enough at first because when I put it all in the pan it was REALLY runny looking, and so I took a chance and put it ALL (butter & all) back into the pot and boiled it longer, (probably another 3-4 minutes) and then poured it back into the pan. Then in the refrigerator... I didn't know how it would turn out, but it worked! Very good texture, and so easy! Thanks!

Exactly what I was looking for!  My grandmom use to make this all the time when I was growing up. She couldn't remember how to make it and I found this!  My family loved it, it was like a walk down memory lane!  Thanks for this recipe!

I'm not sure what happened to my batch but it seems to be much more like a soft chewy caramel than any type of fudge or candy I've made before.  Is that right?  Is that how it's supposed to turn out?

Both times I made this, it burned and I'm puzzled as to why.  I have a candy thermometer and I watched the temp closely and I know my stove top is hot so I turned it down to only medium heat but it still burned the second time around too.  Am I supposed to stir it while its cooking or not?  Usually candy recipes are very specific about stirring, but not this one.  Can anyone help me?

VERY similar to one of my favorite candies from See's. The pecan roll. Has a grainy ALMOST crumbly type texture. I halved the recipe the first time I made it, just so I could see what I was getting myself into. I decided it was a wee bit sweet for me so the second time around  I cut back on some of the sugar.  It was great !!

I gave this 5 stars because it is delicious!  Mine turned out too soft so they were obviosly not cooked to the right temperature, but still very good!  I put in more walnuts and while stirring the mixture I could not help but eat the coated walnuts, as they were simply delicious!

This is like my Grams! I've been trying to replicate hers over the years without success and this one is the closest one I've found.  Thanks!  I can taste that I scorched it just a tiny bit, so I will have to be careful not to have the burner too high next time, but the consistency of it is sort of sugary, not creamy, and that is exactly the way hers turned out.  After you take it off the burner just keep stirring like mad, I even would hold the spoon up and let it flow off the spoon to assist in the cooling.  Be careful if you do that.  Then the candy sort of starts to get thick and a bit grainy looking, although it doesn't lose it's gloss completely.  That's when you want to pour it into the pan, otherwise, if you wait too long, you will end up spreading it roughly in the pan and it's harder to work with.  I chose not to use nuts, I don't like walnuts much, if I choose nuts next time, I may do it with some roughly chopped toasted pecans.

A lady at my church used to include this in her Christmas candy gifts many, many years ago. I looked forward to this candy all year! This recipe turned out perfectly. It will be added to my Christmas candy from now on.

I made this according to the recipe.  The candy was grainy not smooth.  It looked nice but as much as I wanted to like it, it was not a favorite.  I'm sorry, KAYKWILTS, but thanks for sharing.

Just made this and it turned out perfectly. You deffinately have to watch the temp. closely. I'm sure it won't last long once the kids get home from school.

It took a while, but this recipe did eventually set up and make a smooth and creamy candy.  It is verrrry sweet, so add lots of nuts (I used pecans) to counter this, and cut into tiny bites.

Delicious and easy. Mine was slightly grainy, but still yummy. 
Almost stirred my arm off. Would a mixer set on the "stir" setting work?

This was my favorite candy this Christmas!  It was so easy to make; I was a little worried because I don't have a candy thermometer, but the process was explained so well.  I ate the last piece of it today and I think I'm going to make more for New Year's Eve!!  Wonderful!

I would do 110 degrees next time. 115 was too much. Turned out but is crumbly.

Superb!  This is the taste I was looking for :  ) My grandma made this back in the 50's, I have tried other recipes but they didn't cut it, this is melt in your mouth. I like a firm fudge, don't care for chewy fudges or candies. This does cool down fast, put it in your dish as soon as its done. I will be making again & again.
I think next time I will cook longer to let it burn a little, l think thats how my grandma made it. Thank you for this recipe!

Takes a while to stir it cool, so plan ahead.
