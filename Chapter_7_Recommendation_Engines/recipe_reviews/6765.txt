Excellent and very moist.  Definitely don't bake longer than 50 min.  I usually use 3 medium size bananas - which yields about 1 1/2 cups.  The less bananas you use, the less cooking time, by 3-5 minutes less. Use all butter for best flavor. This recipe does need spices: 1.5 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and use all brown sugar - reducing to 3/4 cup is plenty sweet) - all seems to be the best ratio. I've made this about a dozen times and these additions make it perfect.  This is also easier to make than "Banana Banana Bread" from this site since it requires less bananas - having 2 or 3 ripe bananas is more likely than 5 or 7 & this one has more banana flavor and is more moist.  I've made both but use this one for my master recipe.  TIP - this bread is pretty moist, but if you need to prolong it even more for giving away, add 2 tablespoon vegtable oil. **update** I have substituted buttermilk for regular milk, and the bread came out super moist. It also improved the texture, making it lighter & spongier.  I also cover it tightly with foil after it's baked to let it steam for 1/2 hour or more.  A bakery secret for all loaf breads to lock in the moisture.

It was still baking in the oven when I realized that I hit a jackpot! This is absolutely the best banana bread I've ever had. However, I took many of the suggestions into consideration and I think the recipe shouldn't be followed to the letter. I used 1/2 c butter instead of margarine, 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/4 c mashed banana, 2 eggs, and a bit more salt.

This banana bread recipe is the best one that I have used. Before I made this recipe, I made the "Banana Banana Bread" recipe that had 5 stars and 728 ratings.  I was pretty dissapointed with it.  It didn't have as much banana flavor as I like and wasn't as sweet as I like.  It also wasn't moist at all. I found this one and decided to make it and the only thing that I found bad about it was that it kinda had the tendancy to fall apart. I might try adding another egg to prevent this next time that I make it. Other than that, it was absolutely delicious!!! It's very very moist and had lots of banana flavor.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to it, so maybe that helped!!!  Good luck and Happy cooking!  :-)

This recipe is fabulous. It was super moist and had a lot of flavor. I screwed up and mixed the sugar in with the other dry ingredients instead of the butter and it still turned out fine. After reading some of the reviews, I followed their advice and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and increased the banana amount to 1.5 cups. I also did half brown sugar, half granulated sugar. I made one loaf with walnuts and topped it with more walnuts and about 1/3 c. brown sugar. It created a toasted carmelized top that tasted superb! Would be really good served at a brunch or shower. The only thing I would have changed would be adding more salt, maybe 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. per recipe. A little advice: to make sure the bread doesn't come out "doughy", temp the bread and don't take it out of the oven until it has reach a temp of 190 degrees F.

I've finally found the perfect recipe - thanks so much for sharing...!!! I used (as suggested by other reviewers) 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp vanilla extract. Baked at recommended temp x 45 mins - then turned off stove and left in stove for 15 mins more.. Turned out perfect!!! Thnx again!

This is delicious!  The perfect traditional banana bread.  This loaf bakes of VERY moist and stays that way for days (if it lasts that long!).  I omitted the nuts and my toddler loves it.  My husband thought it was outrageous.  I bake mine in a glass dish so I decrease the temp by about 25 degress and bake it for about 50-60 minutes.  This is a keeper!  THANK YOU 4H! :)

made a few changes to the recipe.  1/3 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup white sugar.  1 1/2 cups banana, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I cooked it at 325 for 50- 60 minutes.  Bread turned out moist and sweet.  It's a very good recipe on it's own, but I like a little added flavor.  In the end I even threw in some chocolate chips.  3/4 cup.

I have made this bread several times and I can't seem to get it right.  The center never seems to cook but the outside is done.  I have made better.

Great. I changed the recipe slightly by adding 1/3 C of brown sugar in place of 1/3 of white sugar and also adding vanilla and cinnamon. This is awesome with honeybutter.

I've been trying to find a good banana bread recipe for a long time.  This one is definitely a keeper.  It's not too heavy but still moist with enough banana flavor. I increased the banana to 1 1/2 cup. Decreased sugar to 3/4 cup.  Made extra crumbs to put on top.  it's so good and turned this banana bread into an extraordinary one!  In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 C brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and cinnamon. Cut in 1 tablespoon butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle topping over the bread.  And then bake.

"This is the best banana bread I have ever had!"  That's what my husband said, and I agree.  It is particularly good if you have just two large bananas that are "turning."  Other recipes call for five and six bananas.  I added pecans (had no walnuts), and it was delicious.  Thank you Pat!

Absolutely Yummy! I was going to write  a good review, but my husband said: "This is not good, this is delicious!":) We loved it. First attempt to bake a bread and it came out perfect! Down side was having to watch for doneness , it's about one hour and the recipe is not specific on this ( it says untill it's brown, we tested with a toothpick). Anyway, thank you. We'll bake it again:)Very good!

Great recipe! I only make a few changes. I add vanilla (about 1 tsp) and a sprinkle of  cinnamon. Another yummy trick...instead of coating the pan with flour after you butter it, try using sugar. This adds a bit of sweetness that is fantastic. I use sugar to coat the pan for all of my baking! Also sprinkle about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of sugar on top of the bread before baking. This creates a nice crunchy top to the bread. I typically make mine in a 9x13" pan instead of a bread pan so that affects the amount of sugar spinkled on top.

This is my first review and I just had to write one. This is the second banana bread recipe I've used from this site. I don't need to look any further, this is the best. I'll be making this one from now on. I used 3 bananas, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white, I used real butter and I also dusted the pans with cinnamon and sugar. One loaf was gone in 10 min and the other gone that night after supper! My little girl loved helping me make this and my husband wants to know when I'll be making more!!

I am giving this four stars only because I did not like the fact that the recipe does not give a baking time. I baked mine approximately 25 to 30 mintues in a bundt pan and it turned out beautiful. The recipe is very moist and delicious. I will definitely make this again. My suggestion to anyone reading this comment is that you check your bread after the first 15 minutes and then every five minutes after that so you do not over cook it.

Absolutely the best. The only changes I made was instead of 1 C. white sugar, I used 1/2 C. brown sugar and 1/2 C. white cugar. This did take about 90 minutes in the oven, so next time, I will make two small loaves instead of one large. I think the secret ingredient is the milk. This addition made this bread light and moist, unlike the dense and heavy Banana Banana Bread on this site. This recipe's bread only lasted a couple days and you can eat it plain, it's that moist and flavorful. I used the optional walnuts. 
If you try this, you won't be disappointed.

I've been using the old-fashioned Betty Crocker recipe for yours. NEVER AGAIN! This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever come across! One thing: I poured batter into two small loaf pans in lieu of one big one - shortens cooking time so bread doesn't burn or dry out. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This banana bread recipe is BETTER than the outrageously popular Banana Banana Bread found on this site! I used 3 ripe medium bananas that added up to a cup, added a tsp of vanilla extract with the egg mixture, and added a cup of shredded coconut at the end with the walnuts. This was 'heaven in a slice'! I took the advice from another recipe found on this site and placed the bread in the freezer for 45 minutes. It was moist and full of banana flavour. It was a bit crumbly at the top because it was crispy, so I wrapped it in a freezer bag and placed it in the fridge to 'soften' the crust a bit. The only other thing I recommend is to bake the bread till a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (since ovens vary). Mine took about an hour and 15 minutes. This really is the best banana bread that I have made. Thanks for sharing this delightful recipe, Pat!

mmmmm delicious!! we had 2 overripe bananas that we wanted to get rid of so i just thought i'd make some banana bread. there were so many recipes to choose from, but i'm very glad i went with this one!! i also did the 1/3 cup brown, 2/3 cup white sugar, added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon.  my bake time was about 50 minutes at 325 degrees because i had a glass pan. after it cooled, i wrapped it up in foil and was good many days after! still moist and delicious. (of course, it's gone now!)

Set out today to find a recipe to use up a couple of brown bananas. And this one didn't require me to go to the grocery store! Very yummy recipe - tastes a lot like Mom's. Only a few changes. Used unsalted butter instead of margarine. Didn't have baking powder but subbed with 1/4 tsp baking soda + 1/2 tsp cream of tartar. Added 1 tsp vanilla extract. Omitted the walnuts because I didn't have any. Could have used pecans but was honestly too lazy. Now I'm glad I didn't, bc my sister won't eat nuts and now she can have some when I take it to brunch tomorrow. Baked at 350 for 50 min, but it failed the toothpick test, so per others' reviews I turned OFF the oven and put it back in for another 15 min. An extra 10 min may have sufficed - bottom turned out a little tougher than I'd have liked. Next time might try 45 min + 15 min with oven off. Fiance says he would like a crispier crust with a moister center (picky, picky!) I thought it was delicious, and it's a great go-to recipe for the next time I find myself with 2 or 3 brown bananas.

I have been making banana bread for so long. This is by far the best I have found. I follow the directions exactly and it is to die for! My husband and I can't keep away from it once it's out of the oven. I have since tossed all of my other BB recipes.
TIP: many reviewers have covered the bread with tin foil immediately out of the oven. If you do this, the top will not be a little crispy, which we like. I let it sit on the counter in the pan (uncovered) for 1/2 hour, then immediately wrap in saran wrap. This seems to work the best for me.

I followed this recipe almost exactly and the results were amazing.  The loaf was moist and very flavorful (make sure to use very ripe bananas for maximum banana flavor).  The only thing I did differently was that I sprinkled brown sugar on top for a crumbly, sweet topping.

Very moist, delicious bread.  I did sub some of the white flour for wheat flour and half of the sugar for Splenda and still came out with a light, moist bread.  My seven year old declared it "the best banana bread ever".  I tend to agree with him!

I love baking banana bread and I've made plenty from allrecipes but this is my new favorite. Instead of the 1 cup of white sugar, I added 1/4 of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of agave. I used 3 very ripe bananas and the sweetness level was just perfect! Also,  I followed everyone's advice and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla extract...I let it bake for 45 min at 350 and 15 minutes at 200 and it turned out moist on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. Yum! Will make again.

A nice, moist bread. I did change it up a bit by using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I also added 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 teas nutmeg and 1/4 teas ground cloves. I also tossed in 1 cup choc chips which I had tossed in a bit of flour first. I used a ceramic loaf pan and it took a full hour to cook. I took someone else's suggestion and covered the pan with foil after I took it out to "steam" for 1/2 hour. It smelled heavenly and tasted delicious. A "keeper" recipe thanks to the 4-H and poster!!

I have lost count as to how many banana bread recipes I have made, but this one is one of the best (with a few changes).  My bread turned out moist and spongy, and has tons of banana flavour!  I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers and added some of my own.  I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown.  I used butter instead of margarine.  After blending the sugars and butter together, I added a tsp. of vanilla, a tsp. of cinnamon and a tsp. of nutmeg, and blended again.  Then I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and I used 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas and 2 eggs.  I blended the bananas alot to make sure there weren't chunks, since I hate chunky bits in my bread.  I baked it for about an hour.
I will definitely make this again!

After creating countless banana bread bombs and watching my loved ones choke down dry, bland loaves of banana bread, I finally had success using this fabulous recipe! I followed the advice of others and used both white and brown sugars, added an extra egg, and included the recommended additions of cinnamon and vanilla. I also tossed in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I baked the bread in 4 mini loaf fans and they turned out perfectly...moist and flavorful. My recipe search is finally over!  Thanks so much!

This made a fabulous bread.  I followed someone elses suggestion about turning the heat down to 325 for the last 1/2 hour and then turning off the oven after an hour, leaving the bread in the oven for a while.  It was cooked all the way through and very, very good!  This IS my favorite.

This banana bread is the best I've tried and I have tried many.  I changed a few things:  I put half cup brown sugar and half cup white sugar & I always sprinkle the top of the loaf before cooking with brown sugar.  YUM!!  I cooked the loaf for 55 min and that was not long enough so I kept adding time.  Next time I will reduce heat to 325 so the bottom does not overcook.  Otherwise thanks for the awesome recipe!

This recipe was EXCELLENT. It was so easy to make I had all the ingrediants and had my 3yr old help me. I read the reviews first and did what more than half recommended.. add vanilla and cinnamon also the brown sugar sweetens it up. Cook time I recommened 40 min and check it, if more time is need (not a clean toothpick, or cake tester) continue heating in incriments of 10min!! This one is going in the book!!! One other thing is that I immediatly removed it from the stone loaf pan and wrapped it in foil! This made the heat from the bread retain the moister and came out EXCELLENT..did I say that again!!

Oh, yummy.  I have tried so many banana bread recipes.  This one is delicious!!  The milk makes it very moist and it is just the right amount of sweetness.  I handed out loaves to the neighbors and they all think I'm a genius in the kitchen!  :-)  I did use butter and I highly recommend that.

Oh Mrs. Pat H. I could kiss you for giving us this AMAZING recipe!!!!!!!!This was the first ever banana bread recipe I ever baked and have used it now for over 4 years! This is the only thing i can bake without any flaw and it come out just as perfect as ever! I have over the years made a few adjustments to the sweetness and added more bananas (my fiance loves it sweet).
*** I also am very impatient waiting for my bananas to become ripe so have found that if i bake un-ripened the bananas in the oven until brown & soft they come out SUPER sweet and it inhances the banana flavor and makes them very easy to mash. Thank you so much for this recipe! Thanks to you this bread is the star at any brunch, christmas party, or baked good charity event i bring it to!!! Also I finally can make something my fiance prefers i make over his mom hehehe

Very good! I wish I had read the alternate suggestions first - the brown sugar and vanilla idea might have made it even better - but even adhering to the original recipe made a very good, moist, flavorful bread. I only had 2 bananas, so next time I might use a bit more, for more banana flavor. I also used hazelnuts instead of walnuts.

I made 2 loafs back-to-back. I like moist dense banana nut bread. Nothing like fluffy regular cake. The 1st batch I made I followed the recipe to a T. The 2nd loaf I made using reviews. I liked the 2nd one better. For this reason alone the recipe gets 4 stars - I'm not trying to make spice cake out of this banana nut bread recipe, but it really needs spices. Even so my husband thought it could be even less "cake-y". Enhancements made: Use real (unsalted) butter. Don't cook longer than 50m. Add 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Walnuts are not optional. I will try using buttermilk next time as a reviewer suggested, that might be fun to try. Maybe even some nutmeg.

We love this Banana Bread! I just switch the oil for butter(always seem to never have butter in the fridge) and follow the recipe as is.  For my personal taste preference, I find that leaving out brown sugar and the spices is what makes this banana bread shine.  Bananas are sweet when ripened, so I found that adding brown sugar just over-powered the really nice banana flavor.  I love this recipe as is!

Excellent banana bread! Very easy to adjust to personal preferences for taste or dietary needs; turns out yummy no matter what you do to it! I bake mine at 350 for a half hour, turn down to 325 for a half hour, then turn oven off and go to work. When I get home it's perfect and cooled enough to eat. Mmmmmmmmm :)

I just finished baking this bread a few minutes ago.  It is still warm but I have tried a slice and it is very very good.  I might have put a little more banana in it because I like a strong banana flavor but other than that it turned out great.  I did follow the suggestions of adding vanilla and cinammon and using 1/3 cup brown sugar along with 2/3 white.  I had to purchase those aluminum baking tins at the store after discovering I had lost my loaf pan and they were a little smaller than 9 x 5 so my batch made two loaves.  It took about 45 minutes at 350 (the last ten minutes I lowered the temp to 325 because the top was nice and brown and the middle needed a bit more time) and they are PERFECT.  All in all a great recipe!!  Thanks!

Very tasty, moist and good! The only reason why I rated it as a 4 was because of all the changes I made to it. After reading other banana bread recipes and suggestions made. I made 1/3 of the sugar brown sugar, used 1 1/2 cups mashed banana, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and instead of walnuts I added 3/4 cup chocolate chips. The hardest thing in this menu would have to be being able to fallow the directions. And for cooking time I baked it at 325° for 35 min and the top was a little over done. This is for sure a recipe I'm going to make in future! Nice basic recipe, Pat!

This was a good recipe.  There was not as  strong flavor of a banana flavor as I would have wanted.  Maybe it was my bananas. Also next time I think I will try it with brown sugar instead of white.  It was not quite sweet enough either!  But I am used to brown sugar in breads like this!  Thank Pat!

I have never made any kind of bread before & I found this to be simple and very yummy & I typically do not care for banana bread. I did add 1/4 teasppon of cinnamon and used half white sugar and half brown.  It was very tasty & I will make it again!

Of all the hundreds of Banana Bread recipes I've tried, THIS one gets top billing. The recipe is easy and has simple, everyday ingredients. It doesn't rely on sour cream or cream cheese to make it moist. I think that bit of milk really does something special.  I made this as written, except I used butter and added a Tsp of cinnamon and vanilla extract.  I had four large over-ripe bananas I needed to use, but 3 yielded a cup and a half of mash, so that's all I used. I think I could've added the fourth with even better results.  I cooked in a 5x9 loaf pan at 350 for 20 mins, until it got nicely browned, then turned the oven down to 325 and it took another 55 minutes for it to finish.  We've already eaten half of it, it's super moist, holds together well and has a lovely chewy crust. You can't go wrong with this one.

I was a bit sad when I lost my own banana bread recipe and had to go looking for another one, but this recipe was a great find! Very easy to make, very tasty. I did make a few changes : 1/2 cup each brown sugar and white sugar; added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon; and used less milk, about 3 1/2 tbsp. I also used two mashed bananas, which gave the bread the perfect amount of banana flavour. Be sure to fold in the walnuts (or another substitute) to get it mixed in just right.

Good banana bread.  I only used 2 bananas and really think that 3 would have been better.  I also took the recommendation from another user and used 1 tbls of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  1 tbls of cinnamon really over powered the banana unless you really like cinnamon.  I think that I'll use less cinnamon next time or omit it all together.  Another user mentioned baking at 325 degrees for 50 minutes and that worked for me.  The bread was cooked and moist.

I followed the directions EXACTLY, even sifted the dry ingredients and it came out very crumbly and tasted salty.  I won't make it again.

My daughters call this the "Mommy Makes the Best Banana Bread in the Whole World" banana bread.  

I have tried adding a few things (vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, even raisins) at different times but the original is still the best.  Go for overripe bananas and whole milk.  

Seriously, yum.

This recipe is so good.  I will keep using this, unless I don't have milk.  Notes to self:
- 1/2 c white sugar; 1/2 c brown sugar
- 20 sec. at power 4 (out of 10) in microwave to soften stick of butter
- use 3 almost-molding bananas
- add cinnamon & vanilla
- grease pan with butter wrapper residue
- bake for 45 mins.

This is a very simple recipe and rises nicely in the oven. I used a 9X3 inch loaf pan and worked great too.. Makes it easier to place slices in the toaster. Got great hight out of the bread. I also used 3 bananas instead of measuring out a cup. Made for a slightly more moist bread.

WOW, this is the absolute BEST banana bread I have ever made!! I did add a whole banana chunked-up and folded into the batter once poured into the bread pan, omitted the nuts, and it turned out perfect! It was moist and full of banana flavor, and the crust was not too well done for my little ones. Also, my husband raved about it. Thanks for the awesome recipe, I'll be keeping this one for a long time!

Awesome! This is by FAR the BEST Banana Bread recipe bar none. Great flavor and NOT greasy, but moist with banana.  It's a definite keeper! 

I doubled the recipe and had enough to bake in a Bundt pan (baked at 350 for 1 hour) as well as 10 extra muffins (baked at 350 for 25 minutes).  Used suggestions to add vanilla (2 teaspons for doubled recipe), used half light brown and half white sugar and increased eggs to 3.

Thanks for sharing such a fabulous recipe and thanks to all the previous reviewers for sharing their valuable suggestions!

Incredibly yummy!! I did use some of the other reviewers' suggestions and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon as well as a bit more banana (about 1/3 cup). I substituted 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup veg. oil for the butter too and got super moist and a bit healthier bread too.

This bread tastes very good.  I had trouble with my loaf getting very, very brown (almost burnt on the edges) and I was watching it.  I finally had to put tin foil over it (I wish I had done that from the start) because even though it was "brown and cracked" on the top, the inside was gooey.  It needed a full hour in my oven.  If I make this again, I would definitely make a tin foil tent for the top so it wouldn't get so brown so fast.  But, very good flavor!

This recipe is the one I will always make for the most delicious banana bread!  I changed almost nothing in the recipe to make it work for me:  I followed the ingredients exactly, including the walnuts. It had the perfect moistness (not mushy or gooey) and the perfect banana-y-ness.  Because I increased the recipe to make two loaves, I lowered the temperature to 325 and baked for about an hour and 20 minutes. It came out a perfect golden brown. I was overjoyed because, frankly, I'm not the best baker!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

this was a great recipe.  I did add some cinnamon-1/2 tsp and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I also used brown sugar, 1/3 cup with 2/3 cup of white sugar.  Excellent recipe!  Might use a little more cinnamon next time.

Loved this recipe! Because I prefer spiced banana bread, I added cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, allspice, and vanilla. It was delicious! My only problem was that it was a little on the dry side, but not nearly as dry as other recipes I've tried.

This is delicious as-is, but I got into the habit of making it with 1/3 each white sugar, brown sugar, and Splenda. I also use super ripe bananas, and if I have vanilla soy milk at home I use that instead of regular milk. Everyone loves this, and my boyfriend hopes for banana bread every time we buy bananas.

Perfection!! The best banana bread I have ever had. I used butter instead of margarine, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar. I added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and a touch more salt. Bake at 325 degrees in a glass loaf pan for about 50 minutes. Add a little brown sugar on top.. YUM!!

Pretty good! I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla, substituted the margarine for butter, and baked it on 400 degrees for a little over an hour. Next time, I will add more sugar.

This was by far the best banana bread! I altered the recipe just a little by adding 1 tablespoon wheatgerm and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Great banana taste and moist.

Delicious!  Used 2 bananas (last time used 3 and it was too wet), 3 tbsp milk, not 5. added cinnamon and some lemon zest.  Finally a texture and taste that's as good as the aroma!  60 mins in oven.

It works well as a cake.  I followed the recipe closely, except my banana was 1/4 cup short.  I put it in a greased 8x8 inch cake pan, baked at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes.  It tastes great and wasn't greasy, didn't add any glaze or frosting.

Truly not sure why everyone adores this recipe. The bread was moist, but was so dense that it seemed dry as it was eaten. Not very good flavor....I don't even want to give this to anyone to eat...just not good

This recipe was fantastic! I made a few changes: brown sugar instead of white, unsalted butter instead of margarine, 1 tsp. salt instead of 1/2 tsp., 1 teaspoon of vanilla, chopped pecans instead of walnuts, and I also increased the mashed banana to just over a cup and a half and eliminated the milk.  I baked it at 325 degrees for about 65 minutes and it turned out moist and delicious! Everyone loved it!!!

Very good, but I didn't give it a 5 because I had a recipe for banana bread that I loved it.  I had graham cracker crumbs in it, but unfortunately I can't find the recipe anymore.  I'm looking for an outstanding replacement.  I made a few changes.  I replaced 1 cup of flour with whole wheat flour, and I used 1/2 tsp of vanilla, a bit of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.

Nice and dense. No overpowering banana taste and not too sweet considering the amount of sugar.  Will possibly replace my normal recipe (too much oil).

I did what other uses did and used 3/4 brown sugar in place of regular sugar. I also added the 1 tsp vanilla and 1.5 tsp cinnamon.   Since we're not nut fans here, I put in 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and it was awesome.  After 46 minutes of baking, it was still very wet inside. Another 10 on top of that seemed to do the trick, but it was pretty dark (not burnt though).

followed the directions and it came out perfect.  nice and moist.  I like to freeze my bananas really works out well when you have some that are getting to ripe to eat so you dont have to throw them away, they will keep in freezer for at least 6 months.  i love a nice loaf of bana bread!!:)

Followed others advice about adding 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also, added 2 eggs and 1 tsp cinnamon. It turned out good, but was lacking a really strong banana flavor. My bananas were very ripe, too.

This bread has a great texture but not enough flavor. I used more than 1 cup of bananas and added some cinnamon and nutmeg and it still wasn't quite enough. I will try again with some suggestions from other reviewers.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (only change is that I added a bit of vanilla when I mashed the bananas), and the result was good.  The flavor was excellent, loaf was very moist.  However, texture was very very dense - too dense for my liking (and no, I didn't overwork the batter).  I might try the recipe again using some baking powder and an extra egg.   It took about 55 minutes to cook through.  Great recipe for a flavorful, moist, and very dense banana bread.

This is the best  banana bread recipe I've run across.  I inadvertently omitted the milk, but my bread turned out rich and moist anyway.  In the future, I may try other people's suggestion of substituting half the sugar with brown sugar, and adding vanilla, but only for comparison purposes.  This recipe is great as it is!

Took suggestions made here. Did half brown/half white sugar. cooked 45 minutes and let sit in oven for 15 more. Added cinnamon and vanilla. This has replaced Paula Deen's recipe as our family favorite.  Great recipe!

Excellent bread and VERY moist.  I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg based on other reviews.  Next time I will leave the nutmeg out.  That was the first time I've used that in banana bread and wasn't nuts about it as it is not my favorite spice.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is a super easy, goof proof recipe. It always turns out right. That is saying something from a person who normally makes dry loaves of banana bread.

I had some over-ripe bananas and thought I'd make a few mini loaves to give away to neighbors (since I, myself, don't care much for banana bread).  Well, the loaves turned out so beautiful and smelled so great that I couldn't resist trying a piece.  I ended up surprising myself my eating the whole mini loaf!  I still had 2 to give away and both neighbors asked for the recipe!  Yum, yum!

Best Banana Bread I've ever made!!! Although I did alter the original recipe with the suggestions of others: Brown sugar instead of white, 1.5 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and buttermilk instead of regular milk - GREAT suggestions. Although it did take longer then 50 minutes (approx. 1 hour 5 minutes), I wrapped it in foil afterwards and it is so moist and delicious! Only thing I would do is add another egg to hold it together a little better - tends to crumble easily. Other then that - this is the best banana bread I've made yet! Good luck!Thanks for the suggestions! :)

This is a great recipe! Like most, I've made a few changes:

- Add vanilla and cinnamon to make the bread a little more complex
- Don't mash the bananas too fine and you get some more texture
- added 3/4 chocolate chips
- sprinkled the top with brown sugar and crushed pecans: I am one of those people who like nuts but also value a melt-in-your-mouth dessert, so nuts on top make it a good comprimise
- covered with tinfoil for the last 20 minutes of baking so the topping didn't burn, left it on for another 20 minutes out of the oven: VERY MOIST AND AWESOME

Delicious!  Very easy to make and extremely moist!  I added 1/2 teaspoon of banana extract and make sure you sift the dry ingredients.  I baked it between 50-60 minutes in my oven and it turned out perfect!  I will make this my banana bread recipe to use from now on!

My stepdad said "best banana bread I've ever had" while he was still chewing his first bite! I used 3 bananas, 2 eggs, and 1/2 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup maple syrup. It gave it a unique and delicious flavor. It was so moist and you could really taste the bananas. Loved it!

Delicious BB.  I just made two 8x4 loafs from one recipe.  I did make a few changes per other postings.
1 teaspoon of cin., 3/4 brown sugar & 1/4 sugar combined to equal 1 cup, 3 med bananas (approx 1 1/4 cup)& milk with a little lemon juice since I did not have buttermilk.  The cakes turned out great.  I made one with mini choc chips and the other loaf without.  I ate it right from the oven.  If this bread gets better after sitting a day I can't want to taste it tomorrow.  
P.S.  I baked both loafs at the same time for 45 minutes.

Very good recipe. I changed it a little. I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 2 tsp. of cinnamon. Also I made little cupcakes instead of a loaf. I used a 12-holder cupcake pan, used inserts, filled each 3/4 of the way, and baked at 350 for 28min. They turned out great!

This deserves 5 stars! I was looking for an easy banana bread recipe and I looked at the more higher rated ones on this site. I saw far too many bad reviews in those and some that required more work than I felt like for a simple bread. The simplicity of this recipe appealed to me and I am glad I used it. It came out wonderful and I am not a big Banana Bread fan! I followed it to the tee just adding a VERY heaping cup full of bananas and some cinnamon. EVEN BETTER the next day. I will note though, it took a full hour in my oven (which is only a year old) and it was still a bit gooey in the center. So I turned the oven off and left it in the oven for about 15 minutes and it yeilded perfect results! I will keep this recipe for good. Thank you for sharing Pat.

GREAT flavor and very moist! I did follow some of the other reviews as well and did half brown sugar and half white. I added a tsp. of vanilla and a lil cinnamon.I had 3 mashed banana's which added up to 1 1/3 cups so I added it all to the recipe. My COOKING TIME was 47 minutes exactly. (that's when the toothpick came out clean)Anyways, it came out very nicely in my bundt pan and thank u Pat for the nice recipe! :)

This is absolutely delicious!!  I just made it and had to stop myself from eating it all. I also made similar modifications as other reviewers (brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon) but I also substituted evaporated milk for regular milk-as I do with all recipes that call for milk.  Added chocolate chips for a great result!!!  DELICIOUS!!

The BEST!! I'll never use another banana bread recipe! Comes out banana-y, rises beautifully, golden colour, great texture, honestly the best banana bread ever! Makes a great gift at the holidays, trust me I've done it. :) Sells wonderfully at bake sales...done that too. :)

Out of all the banana bread recipes this is the one thats much like the one I've used for years!! The best thing is that you can scale it by how many "cups" of mashed banana you have instead of how many large or small bananas (amount real makes or breaks the loaf). The only difference is that I use 1 tsp soda and 1 tsp vanilla. Then after it comes out of the oven I brush the loaves with butter and sprinkle with sugar. Wrapping them in foil when cool really locks in the moisture and yum!!

This recipe is no better nor worse then my usual recipe from BHG cookbook, so I probably won't change - this recipe requires sifting and mine doesn't.

This recipe was better than the one I've been using for years. It was moister on the inside and gave a wonderful crispiness to the outside.  Next time, I'm going to use less sugar though.

I had never made banana bread before but this recipe turned out perfectly! I used two eggs, as others had suggested. Other than that I didn't change a thing. It's a hit with my partner's family and they're requesting I bake more. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband is easy, but I tried this on my 6 and 8 year old boys, and it won big time.   I didn't have enough quantity of a couple ingredients on hand for the loaf, so I made muffins.  This weekend I am making it as a loaf, with eggs on the side,  for breakfast.   I love it, too!!!!

I used Splenda and a little pancake syrup and oil instead of marjarine (marjarine has trans-fats) for a heart-healthy bread.  I skipped the salt also, and added a little nutmeg and cardamom.  It still worked great!  I am impressed with this flexible, delicious recipe.

I switched a few things up, did 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar, included vanilla, cinnamon & nutmeg (cause i love spices!) & doubled the banana. unfortunately, I think that was too much banana, so it took almost 90 minutes until the center was no longer gooey. Great dense bread with a good flavor, but takes a while to cook. I suggest covering it with foil for the last 30 minutes to keep the top from getting too crunchy.

I handsome bananas that got too ripe, but we're perfect for baking with and this recipe really did the trick! It's very moist, not too sweet, and is very flavorful. I baked it and brought it to a potluck and came back home with an empty bread pan! That's saying something!

The best banana bread I ever had was on my honeymoon in Hawaii and I've been looking for a recipe to match it ever since. I finally found it with this recipe! The bread is very moist and not too heavy. I didn't have baking powder so substituted an extra 1/4 tsp baking soda and half a cup sour cream, still came out great! I'll be making this many more times. Also, I only cooked it for 50 minutes as one reviewer suggested.

Very easy & moist.  Used 3/4 c. brown sugar iso white sugar and butter iso margarine, per others' suggestions.  I used a 1.5 qt (8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 in) glass Pyrex loaf pan and baked 1h 5 min in a convection oven.  Perfect!

Love the recipe but I usually put the batter into four small loaves. I made a big one and it poured over the sides and yes what a mess. Did I do something wrong? I uses the 9x5 Loaf pan as instructed.

ok, I added 1tsp. vanilla to the egg/butter mixture and 3/4 cups brown sugar, instead of white sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the flour mixture.  I used 3 bananas and a tbsp. milk.  They came out great!!  I made them as 6 large muffins, so I added a mixture of brown sugar, cinnamon and a little flour on the top.

good banana bread.  I followed ingredients as directed but modified procedure a little.  I combined all dry ingredients, then mixed all wet ingredients including butter (instead of margerine) and milk.  then combined the 2.   Came out great!

Absolutely delicious.  I used a single serving organic applesauce instead of butter.  Also added 1 Tablespoon Chia Seeds and 1/4 C Wheat Germ for some extra health benefit.

This was really good!  I made a few changes - I used 1 1/2 cups wheat flour, 1/2 cup unbleached flour, unsweetened coconut milk instead of regular milk, and organic unbleached sugar instead of regular sugar.  It tasted great to us (I'm the health nut, my husband is my poor guinea pig).  The amount of banana is just right!

I noticed that our bananas were getting over-ripe and decided to make banana bread. This recipe was fantastic! I used butter instead of margarine and threw in some cinnamon as well; don't know how many cups of bananas since I just wanted to get rid of all of them (3 mediums I'd say). I used sugar instead of white; I have yet to find "real" brown sugar over here in Taiwan--the brown sugar here has a raisin-y taste to it, which added a deliciously interesting flavor to the bread.  I just realized that I forgot to add the milk but no one in my family missed it so I guess it wasn't too necessary! I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

Tried other banana bread recipes before and this is by far THE BEST!  I don't even add vanilla or cinnamon; just the bananas are enough by themselves!    If I had to make a few suggestions, they would be: 1) Using butter instead of margarine gives an awesome crust (the heels are my favorite!); 2) Two large overripe bananas (at least 8" long, peeled) are the perfect quantity for flavor and sweetness--if you end up with more than 1 cup mashed, you can adjust the sugar to taste; 3) Substituting half of the the all-purpose flour with cake flour gives the bread a nicer texture and also makes the batter easier to handle, which brings me to no. 4; 4) Folding the wet ingredients into the dry ALWAYS yields the best result; use the electric mixer only on the wet ingredients! 5) Baking the batter in a shallow 8x8 square pan gives a (slightly) shorter baking time, which translates to a lighter, more uniform colored interior--I would set the timer to 45 minutes and then monitor the bread for doneness; if toothpick inserted in the "broken" part of the surface still comes out with raw batter, add another 10 minutes to oven time, and test again.  I will be sure to give this recipe to my 8-year old when she starts learning how to bake!

Definitely a keeper. I was out of baking powder so i used molasses instead, but i cut the sugar in half and it worked out fine. I also added a teensy bit of cinnimon and some chopped up dark chocolate, which i would reccomend. I had  doubled the recipe and the giant loaf was gone in a day.

Yum Yum Yum...so good. Wish I had walnuts to put in.  added 1tsp or vanilla and cinnamon. Used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. I used non dairy creamer instead of the milk. Really easy and really fast!

This is the best banana bread EVER.  Just make it exactly as specified in the recipe and I don't believe it is possible to be disappointed.  As per usual with banana bread, the riper the bananas the better.  Though I always add extra banana whenever I have it- I basically just "round up" with the bananas.  Soooooooooooooo good.  We always look up this recipe when making banana bread- yum!

THere are better recipes out there. I've made them--I just wanted to try a different recipe that's been sitting in my box for a few years. I'm not really impressed. It lacks overall flavor--even after adding more banana than specified and cinnamon and vanilla. It baked in just over 50 minutes and looked beautiful, smelled amazing--it doesn't taste BAD, it just doesn't have the gusto many other banana bread recipes out there do have.

This banana bread is absolutely irresistible. It is so moist and delicious that I cannot seem to have enough of it. I made a few changes though. I added 2 tsp. vanilla extract and instead of using 2 cups of white sugar, i used 2 cups of brown sugar. These small changes make it even better. Trust me, I have made this over a dozen times and it never fails to satisfy.

This is the best banana bread recipe that I have found - I've been using it for a couple years now, and refuse to try another one.  Often I toss in some chocolate chips because I am such a chocolate lover. It always turns out perfect and moist, with no hard or rubbery edges on the sides or bottom.

I've used at least a dozen different recipes for banana bread and this one is by far the best. Everyone I have served this to is amazed by its moistness and flavor. The milk makes it amazingly light and the little sugar added makes it not as overly sweet as other recipes.

I recommend substituting sliced almonds for the walnuts and using 1/2 cup milk instead of 5 TBS.

Added the cinnamon and vanilla and used 1 and 1/2 cups of banana.  Best EVER, next time, however, I'll add more walnuts because I love them and there's not quite enough for me in this recipe.  I used an 8 inch loaf pan and cooked for about 55 minutes.  Steamed it in aluminum foil as the reviewer mentioned and I'm enjoying my second piece as I type this!

Yummy!  It was sweet and tasty and it didn't crumble like crazy in my hand like most banana breads do.  I was very impressed.  Mine did not split at the top but I watched it carefully and rescued it from the oven when it was a nice golden brown.  It turned out just great if a little crunchy around the edges.  Also I used unsalted butter instead of margarine and sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  Bottom line: A nice fluffy banana bread, and if you leave it in a bit longer than you normally would, you get a pleasant crunchy crust. :)

I agree with MommyInSeattle as far as baking time and the addition of spices and vanilla.  This bread is good without, but superb with those additions.  I use 1 tsp. allspice and 1 tsp. vanilla.  An extra egg makes it extra rich, as does using butter instead of margarine for a truly decadent experience.  I find that at my elevation, in Kansas City (740 feet) it gets done in about 45-50 minutes.  This bread is a hit at my church every time I serve it.

I used oil in place of the margarine and flax/water in place of the egg. I made 12 muffins and baked them for 20 minutes and they came out delicious. The bread is dense with a good crumb and really flavorful.

The first time I made the banana bread, I made a mistake of adding another 1/2 cup butter and with just 1 banana - it turned out rather hard and way too little buttery.

The second time I made it, followed everything - even a tip from another reviewer, saying that I should cover the freshly baked bread with foil for 30mins.. boy it was moist and really really flavorful! I would definitely do this again, and maybe add some streusel on top :)

Mmm! Delicious! The only thing I changed was using half brown sugar and half white sugar instead of using all white sugar. So good, I'm making another loaf right now! With cinnamon, vanilla, and oatmeal on top. Just the right density, not too heavy like Banana Banana bread. Thank you! This is a keeper.**UPDATE** The baked the second loaf using an 8x4... should have stuck with a 9x5, was a tad dry due to the longer cooking time =( Anyhow, wrapped both loaves in foil overnight... the first loaf was even better the next day!

Great recipe - after reading other reviews I altered the original recipe a tad, adding an extra egg, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Personally, I thought the vanilla overpowered the banana flavor a bit, and will reduce this amount to 1/2 teaspoon at the most, or eliminate it altogether.  The other additions proved great, and we had a wonderfully moist loaf of bread to enjoy.

This recipe is fabulous! I am newly married and was looking for an impressive banana bread recipe for my new husband. He LOVED it and my mom wanted the recipe! My bread took about 1 hr. 20 min for perfection. I used three very ripe banans and yum, yum, yum. Nothing wrong with this recipe.

This recipe was good but the second time I made it I added about a half cup more banana, 1/2 tbs vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, substuted 1/2 of the sugar with brown sugar and sprinkled a lil brown sugar on the top. My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it!!  **update**I made this recipe many times over the last few years and the last time I made my husband brought some into work and they all loved it. I ended up making about ten more loaves!! Now I'm gearing up to make some more and I know i'll be making atleast that many loves again lol

Made this recipe as noted except added an extra egg as one reviewer suggested to hold it together.  My boyfriend and I made this together and he can't cook.  It turned out perfect.  His grandfather said it was "too moist."  We  thought that was hilarious.  The moistness makes it fabulous.

This is the best banana bread I've ever had or made!!  Everyone loves it!  I did do 1/2 white flour, 1/2 whole wheat flour, used Splenda brown for the brown sugar, added the recommended vanilla & cinnamon.  Topped it with chopped walnuts mixed with a little brown sugar & ground flax seed!!!  YUMMY!!  Easy too!!

I've entered a review on this recipe before but I wanted to add a note on something else I tried.  As before, I made muffins but this time I added an oatmeal crumb topping which consists of 1/4 c quick oats, 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and  1 tsp butter or margarine.  It gave the muffins a little extra something and the family loved them.

Tried this tonight and it was Wonderful I too did the 1/3 brown sugar 1/3 white sugar adjustment and YUMMY YUMM YUMM and not too sweet. I think next time I might just add 1 more bananna for a little more banana flavor. I made it in a bundt pan like another reviewer and didnt care for that because the peices cut funny but other than that this will be the one!

I'd give this recipe about 4 1/2 stars. I've also taken some suggestions from other reviewers, which brings it up to a 5. It's a 5 if you add the vanilla, and the cinnamon is good, too, making it a bit of a spice bread. I like it with or without, depending on the day. It's good with 1/2 brown sugar, too, but just about as good with all white. My kids love this recipe. Also, is better with more than 1 cup banana...add about 1/4 - 1/3 cup.

Mmmmm...this made my whole house smell delicious! I love the bread-like quality of this recipe. The crust is lovely! 

Although I hate to alter recipes and review them anyway, I did alter this as suggested by other reviewers. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I did not use the nuts.

I gave this four stars just because I prefer a little denser banana bread, but I will continue to make this one as a great breakfast bread (it's wonderful toasted).

I'm updating my review because I tried making these again tonight and they turned out soo good...AGAIN. I altered the recipe a bit and added a cup more of bananas and this made it sweeter so I only added a 1/4 cup of sugar. I also added about 1/4 of peanut butter and the whole thing turned out AWESOME!! I can't tell you enougt how good this recipe is, its so quicke and easy an by far the best recipe for a simple banana bread without the choco chips and all that other stuff!!

This is an awesome Banana Bread.  I made it a couple of weeks ago and than threw out the recipe and had to come search for it again cause my husband wanted the same banana bread.  I did use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  This bread didn't last long in my house of 5, they ate it up.  Delicious.

Excellent bread!  My husband baked it and it still turned out good!  It is very moist and the crust is soft after storing for a day.  We didn't have nuts to put in it, but I know that would make it even better!  We added 1 tsp vanilla but no cinnamon.

Oh Yeah!  I make this bread all the time and its the best!  Some changes I find work well:

- add a little more banana if yours aren't very ripe
- add 2-3 tbsp honey
- a tiny bit of brown sugar gives it a more mellow taste
- add some golden raisins
- after pouring into dish, top with rolled oats, chopped walnuts, sprinkle 1/2 tsp sugar for a glistening look.  Pat the oats and walnuts a little to prevent them from falling off.  drizzle a little more honey too
- clean up works well if you line the baking dish with parchment paper on bottom and sides

I thought this recipe was good - I substituted 1/4 cup of oil & 1/4 cup of aaplesauce for the butter..And I added vanilla, and pecans instead of walnuts. It was quite good - mine only needed 35 minutes, not one hour.

I had to add an update to my 2003 review... not only is this a delicious bread it's also very versatile. This morning, wanting something a little different and being short on bananas, I added 1 can of whole berry cranberry sauce, in addition to my 1-1/2 c. of mashed bananas (for a double batch) I've also used applesauce or crushed pineapple (drained) as an extender to the bananas. Oh, and I always replace the white sugar with brown and add cinnamon and vanilla to the recipe... it's always great and it always disappears fast!! Thanks so much for this keeper :)  9/24/03This is an excellent banana bread recipe. It bakes up nice and moist with a lot of banana flavor. I made it as the recipe states, except that I added about 1/3 c. extra of bananas, rather than throw out some of what I'd already mashed. The one loaf took about 65 minutes to bake.

I don't have to search any more for a banana bread recipe.  Thanks to Pat for this one.  Always turns out great.  Very moist (and if you are like me most things turn out dry)so even I can do it.  This recipe is great just the way it is - I don't put the nuts in, but it dosen't need any spices.  I make it whenever there are bananas that want to made into bread!!!  Family favorite.

Very moist, tasty bread yielded from this recipe. I added 3/4 tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon to the batter for added taste. I did not bake bread for 1 hour as suggested but instead just under an hour to ensure moist quailty. A previous reviewer mentioned the sifting in this recipe. I didn't do that and it turned out just fine.

I haven't made a banana bread in a long time.  The last recipe I used had so much shortening in it, that was all you could taste.  I tried this recipe as soon as I got it and it was SO GOOD!!  It didn't last long.  I'm purposely waiting for my bananas to get over-ripe so I can make some more.  Also, I used Splenda instead of sugar and it turned out fantastic!  I recommend this recipe!

I thought this recipe was so so.  I have a better recipe for banana bread so I will use it instead of this one.  However, my mother -in-law liked this bread.

This banana bread recipe is awesome! It's simple enough my 6 year old can practically bake it herself and its moist and tasty.  I've always used just as it is in the recipe and it turns out great.  Time in oven is about an hour give or take 10 mins

excellent. very moist and not overly sweet. I used 2 eggs (because I wanted to use all that I had) and brown sugar (again because I wanted to finish what I had). so it is a forgiving recipie. took it to work and got lots of compliments.

Good.  Made muffins instead.  My granddaughters loved them.  A little healthier ingredients.  Next time will try cutting sugar in half, see what happens.

If you are like me, and think you have to have sour cream for a moist banana bread, WE ARE WRONG!  This is an amazingly moist, delicious bread!  I only added a bit of cinnamon to the mix and coated the pan with pan spray, cinnamon, and sugar.  Scrumptious!

After a visit to US I became interested in the American cuisine and decide to try this recipe (I very like bananas). I use mini bakery at the regime "bread" and do not add baking powder (add a bit more soda), add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and cinnamon. Bread was baked about 1h and 15 minutes. And... The result was excellent! The flavor is perfect... The structure is quite moist, but it isn't a lack. And of course taste is very interesting with fine banana aroma... I liked this recipe and I didn't have any difficulties!

Wonderful banana bread! Very moist and light. I was afraid it might burn, so I baked it for 50 minutes at 350, then lowered the temperature to 300 for another 10 minutes. It came out perfect with a wonderful crunchy top.

I followed this recipe to the letter but omitted nuts and added 1/2 teas of vanilla.  I found the crust to be hard and the bread to be dry.  I baked it 1 hour and had checked a couple minutes before to find it still doughy, so I doubt I overcooked it.

I'm not good at reviews but I'm great at list making.  1) this batter is so easy to mix, I don't even need a mixer; 2) the instant you stir in the bananas your whole house smells delicious; 3) this bread is so moist and flavorful that it makes my mouth water to think of it.  I use 2% milk and unsalted butter and it tastes amazing.  This recipe is highly recommended!

Just "okay" for me.  Nothing to write home about.  Definitely not my Mom's banana bread.  I did try the 2/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp cinnamon (and 1 1/4 c. bananas).  But, it's pretty average.  I was hoping for more after reading all of the reviews.  I gave it 3 stars because it's not horrible, just not really good either.

Very moist!  I used a glass loaf pan and needed to bake it for over an hour.  I don't like walnuts so I omitted them.  I used brown sugar in place of the white nad butter instead of margarine.  I added cinnamon and vanilla as per other suggestions and am glad I did.  I am going to use a 3rd banana next time I make this recipe as it did not have enough banana flavour for my liking.  Overall I would say this is a good base recipe, tweak as you see fit!

This makes a very moist banana bread.  I followed the directions only adding 1/2 teaspoon each of cinnamon and cloves and vanilla.  I omitted the walnuts because I didn't have any.  My baking tin was a 8x4 so I made one loaf and one pan of 12 mini muffin cups.  The muffin cups cooked for 35 mins and the loaf cooked for 50 mins.  Very moist and very yummy.  Thank you.

Moist, with a crunchy crust.  Added 1 TBS of vanilla, and only 4TBS of milk, and 1/2 cup regular sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Also added 1 cup of choc chips to turn this into a dessert!  Huge hit with the hubby and 3 year old (of course!).

Amazing banana bread recipe! I made a few changes, however. I took the advice of MommyFromSeattle when it came to the addition of cinnamon and vanilla, as well as switching the white sugar for brown. I didn't have any buttermilk on hand or I would have tried that as well, but as it is this bread came out wonderfully! I didn't have any nuts around, but I threw in some flax seed. It's amazing if eaten while still warm and drizzled with honey.

Made with a ton of chocolate sprinkles to add a sweet twist.  My husband loves it so much, he won't let me share it with anyone else!  He and I devoured an entire loaf in hours the first time I made it!

Took advice from others and added cin & nutmeg and 1/2 brown sugar rather than all white - yes - best ever banana bread and will be my standard.

This is a really good recipe to base your own version of Banana Bread on.  I think this recipe is probably meant to be cooked in a metal bread pan.  If you're cooking this in a glass loaf dish then cut the temperature back to 325 and increase cooking time.  I cook it for an hour at 325 and then an additional 30 minutes at 300.  It comes out perfect.  I did similar variations as other reviewers, 2 eggs and half brown sugar instead of all white, an extra banana never hurt banana bread either!  :)

This is the best banana bread I have ever had by far! I did tweak it to my liking by using extra bananas, heavy cream for milk, cinnamon, and the peel of 1 lemon.

My 1st time to ever bake banana bread from scratch and this was by far the most delicious bread we have ever eaten. My intentions were to take it to neighbors but it was so good we kept it for ourselves and shared it with my inlaws. The only odd thing I found was how light in color it was. I am assuming that was because of white sugar being used vs brown sugar? But it tasted AMAZING!! It was almost SINFUL to put in your mouth..it was THAT good! =)

Spectacular!  This puts the pumpkin bread I made last week to shame!  Always try something a little healthier, so I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce.  Likewise 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour.  Substituted 3/4 cup brown sugar and added cinnamon like the others.  Oh, and I tried the foil tent method after taking it out of the oven.  I have tried scores of recipes from this site, loved many of them - but this was so good I HAD to review it (first review ever) Even with the 'healthier' version it's now my favorite bread recipe!

Very simple to make for a hot, snowy morning breakfast for a family of muffin lovers. I got 12 large muffins out of this recipe. I used whole wheat white bread, cut the sugar in half, used butter instead of margerine, and pecans instead of walnuts. I did sprinkle pecans over the top of the muffins, too. Out of twelve muffins, two remain. They sure did turn out pretty!

the recipe worked perfectly.  I did cut down to 3 tbs. skim milk instead of 5 tbs.  and cooked for 50 minutes - sides and top were crunchy (just the way I LOVE) and the inside was moist and flavorful!

Good banana bread as is, but to make it 5 star I add 1-1 1/2 t cinnamon, 1 t vanilla, sub 1/2 c brown sugar for white, and use 3/4c whole wheat flour.  Yummy!

This banana bread was light; almost like a regular cake instead of a dense cake.  I doubled the recipe; used butter instead of marg and sprinkled some sugar/cinnamon mix over the top before baking since I didn't have nuts.  Family and guest loved it.  Will defiantly make again!!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was fantastic! I have made this several times, but the last time I used bananas that had mostly black peels, because I wanted to use them before they went bad. Surprisingly, the bread turned out much better! The bread was SUPER moist. I would give this recipe six stars if I could.

I altered this a bit because I had too many bananas and doubled the recipe and what not.  The only extra ingredient I added was 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I had enough for 6 large muffins and one large loaf.  I added choc. chips to the muffins.  All in all, this was the best banana bread I have ever eaten! The bread is the perfect texture!  Thank you so much for sharing this with me!

for me, this is the BEST banana bread i've ever made. my husband like his own version w/c has too much veg. oil in it.  he likes it moist not 'cakey'. i really dont know what he means by that but a bread should have a "bread" texture. this turned out to be a bread-not muffin, not cake-but "bread".  btw, i ran out of baking soda so i used a tablespoon of ginger ale. i think Sprite or 7up also works but I will buy the baking soda-a must in my pantry. will post a pic later. thanx a lot!

Made it once as written, and once with some changes suggested by others.  Original was good...with changes it was awesome.  Subbed 3/4 C brown sugar for the white sugar, added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla.  Baked for 45 minutes (oven runs hot) and wrapped it in foil when it came out (just like my mom always did).  Didn't use the walnuts because I am the only one who likes it that way.  VERY moist but not dense and heavy.  Good banana taste, and slices and stays together nicely.  Thanks Pat for the foundation and thanks everyone else for the suggestions!

Nice recipe.  Everyone liked it.  I even forgot to put the 5T of milk in it and it was STILL MOIST! ha.  I did use 3/4c brown sugar instead of the 1c white sugar.  I also added 1t vanilla, 1/2t nutmeg, 1t cinnamon, 1/2c fresh blueberries, and 1/2c pecans! Yum!  Covering immediately after taking it out of the oven with tin foil to let it steam is so brilliant and surely works by the way... kudos to the person who gave that as an initial tip.

Can't give it a 5, since I took hints from other cooks.  More bananas, sour cream to replace the milk, butter rather than margarine, 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar, then threw in golden raisins, about a cup, and 1/2 chopped walnuts.  Turned out great, and thanks to ONYX78 Nov. 6 2004 for her help. Cookie

This banana bread was good to me, but the kids really enjoyed it. I made a few changes: To cut on fat I only used 1/4 cup of butter and added 1/4 cup of sour cream, added cinnamon, vanilla extract and omitted the walnuts because the kids prefer without it.

Thank you, Pat, for a wonderfully adaptive recipe!  I used it as my inspiration yesterday.  It's a very basic and forgiving recipe that allows for all sorts of adjustments as you need to (or see fit to) do.  My adaptations gave excellent results.    I only had 3/4 cup of mashed banana so I added another egg to add additional moisture! I also used 1/2 cup each of white and brown sugar, I added a heaping 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I used 1 heaping Tbsp of sour cream and milk (lactose free, 2%) to equal 1/3 cup liquid.  I added toasted walnuts and chopped them very fine to add to the batter.  Rave reviews from family and friends.

Great recipe!  I wanted something a little different, so I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also substituted 1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar instead of the white sugar and used egg beaters in place of the eggs.

it was okay. it was slightly flavorless and pretty unspectacular texture wise. i tried making the adjustments suggested in the last two reviews...perhaps that was my mistake i don't know. i wont make it again.

Tried this recipe last night. Only variation was to reduce sugar to 3/4 cup. Turned out excellent. I did use an 8x8" pan instead of loaf pan to reduce baking time. Baked for about 43 minutes. This recipe doesn't need vanilla or any other ingredients as far as I'm concerned. Turned out moist and very flavorful without adding anything.

I prefer this recipe over the "banana banana bread" This recipe is more bread-like than the other and fluffier, less dense.  It also had a better appearance and required less "fixes."  Things I did do: Added 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce and 1 tsp cinnamon, Used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and covered with foil straight out of the oven for an hour.  I used 4 regular sized bananas and I also didn't use any nuts because I don't like them in bread.  I don't think it needed anything else, it was perfect.  Be careful where you place in the oven though, mine was slightly underdone on the bottom half from not being centered.  At 350, mine took 1 hour.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've found. I usually use a bit more banana than recommended, otherwise I follow the recipe as listed. Occasionally it does need to cook a bit longer than the specified hour. Yummy!

Unbeleivable....this has the texture, taste, crust, and flavor of a perfect banana bread! Soooooooo moist, and I've tried a lot of recipes. Plus, it makes a generous sized loaf.Just make sure the bananas are mashed with a fork,...pureed bananas make foe a soggy loaf.Thak you!

Following others advice, I modified just a bit: 1/2 C brown and 1/2 c white sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 3 mashed bananas, 2 eggs, and a bit more salt. This is super easy and delicious.

I made this bread yesterday with the recommendations/changes of other reviews and I was a tad bit disappointed. The flavor was great (I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla, a teaspoon of cinnamon, chopped pecans, and used 3 fairly large ripe bananas for a big banana taste). The bread was not moist at all and I even did mommyinseattle's suggestion of covering the bread for half an hour with aluminum foil right after it came out of the over(i think it cooked it more)! I added 2 eggs like others suggested, but next time I will only use 1 hoping that will make a difference. I give this recipe 4 stars because I loved the appearance of the bread (beautiful color and rise), it made our house smell amazing, and there was a sweet-vanilla-banana flavor to the bread. What I didn't like was that is came out so dry BUT I will definitely attempt this again because of all the other stellar reviews hoping that the second time around is better and more moist!

My 4 boys are major banana bread lovers.  This one passed the test. I like this recipe best because of the amount of bananas in it.  I used 2 medium sized ones and could definately taste them.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 cup mini chocolate chips.  I cooked it at 350 for 70 minutes.  I covered it right out of the oven with foil to keep it moist.  This ones a keeper.

This was really good.  I picked this recipe because I only had 1 egg and will definitely use this recipe again.  I totally forgot to add the milk but I didn't miss it.  I used all brown sugar and added a little cinnamon as well.  Thanks!

I just tried this one last night using all of the last reviewer's suggestions, plus adding 1 capful of vinegar to the milk (to substitute for buttermilk.) It's a great-tasting recipe, easy, and results in a very moist yummy bread. I had to bake for 55 minutes before it was done. The suggestion to wrap with foil right out of the oven really made a difference in keeping it moist!

I substituted 1/2 cup of white sugar for 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar, 3 bananas, and one jumbo egg.  I then baked it @ 350F for 48 minutes.  I then wrapped the pan in foil while it cooled for about 40 minutes to keep it moist.  This is a great recipe, next time I will add nuts.

This bread ROCKED! I am not a big fan of Banana Bread but I had some old bananas and decided to make some bread out of it. It was wonderful. I followed ONYX78 helpful hints and it turned out so yummy.

I tried this recipe with a few of the suggested variations from other reviewers and I have to say, it was the best banana bread I have ever had in my life!  Never have I tasted one so moist!  Also, the suggestion to cover the loaf with foil for a 1/2 hour before serving was the greatest suggestion of all.  I couldn't believe the difference!  AAA+++

Great recipe.
I made the additions suggested by 'mommy in seattle' and it was perfect.  I added chocolate chips for a little sweetness.

Fan-TAS-tic recipe!!!. Trust me, i've tried a bunch of banana bread recipes, this one is hands-down the best. 
I made the following changes, for health reasons, and it was still super moist, very banana-ish and delicious.
-Replaced 1 cup of the flour for whole wheat flour
- Used 1/2 brown suger (packed) and half white sugar
- used only 3/4 stick butter (1/2 cup is one full stick, which is what the recipe calls for)
- Added an extra 1/4 cup of mashed banana to replace the butter i took away.
- Instead of nuts,  I added 3/4 cup plumped raisins (just soak them in warm water for a bit).
- added one tsp vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon allspice.

Give this a try, you won't be sorry!!!! I might have to make some more today...

Very nice recipe. I also added the cinnamon and vanilla and extra egg. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of ground allspice, just a personal preference. I remembered at the last minute that I didn't have any walnuts. So I chopped up about 20 roasted macadamia nuts that I did have on hand. They aren't bad, they gave it the crunch it needs and are definitely not the traditional taste, but they worked. My family seemed to like it as well. This recipe rose beautifully. I baked mine in 4 mini loaf pans so I can give a few away. Thanks for the great recipe.

This bread is really good!  I did take the advice of adding 1/2 cup brown sugar, the cinn. and vanilla.  My husbands co-workers love it.  I think I've made one every week for the past 5 weeks!

Thanks for sharing this wonderful Banana Bread recipe. I used five extremly ripe bananas, and followed the rest of the instructions as written. I didn't slice till the next morning. Held together great.

This is the best banana bread recipe that I have found! I've tried many and most have turned out dry and crusty.  But this recipe makes a nice moist loaf, slightly crusty on the outside.  When I make this banana bread, I can usually get two loaves out of one recipe, so I end up freezing the extra one.  I did use 1 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla and all brown sugar, as some others have suggested.  Also, substituted vanilla yogurt for the milk and loved the results.  This has turned out to be a definate favorite at our house!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly! I did cover the top with foil half way thru baking to avoid a too-brown top.I baked it in a standard size loaf pan, lined with foil so I could simply lift it out when done (also makes for a speedy clean-up). The loaf has a moist, dense crumb-fragrant and richly studded with the nuts. I made it for an office gathering and it didn't last long. Failproof.

Soooooooooo easy and delicious!! I did take a suggestion and instead of all white sugar, I used 3/4C white sugar and 1/4C brown sugar.  I didn't measure the amount of banana, I just used 3 medium size ripe ones.  If you live at a higher altitude, no worrries!!  I didn't have to change a thing except it was done after about 50 minutes.  My friends are still talking about how great this was.

Really good cake/bread. I made it for a friend, and they came to me afterwords and said: This cake tastes as if it were straight from heaven!
Best banana bread I ever made. 
It also tastes good if you add some chocolate chips, I did it and it gives it a really good taste.

Mmmm! This is probably the best banana bread I've ever made! It's really moist and flavorful... I added two tsps of vanilla along with some cinnamon and nutmeg. It came out great that way... I also used brown sugar instead of white. I'm going to make this from now on! Super simple, and super good!

Great!  Nice recipe - I doubled the recipe and used half cake flour and half whole wheat flour.  I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, as well.  I also added vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  I baked in a 9x13 pan for about 45 minutes and it came out perfect!!  With the cake shape - I guess I could even frost it with a cream cheese frosting and serve as I would a cake!  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!

Loved it. The bread was so moist! The only thing I did different was to used one over-ripened banana and added applesauce until I had 1 cup of banana/applesauce mixture. The banana taste was still there. Will definitely use again!

As a preschool teacher, I was looking for an easy recipe for Banana Bread for my children to make during B week.  This is it!  Even my pickiest eaters loved it at snack time.  We left out the nuts, because it is a nut free environment, but it was to moist and yummy!

This is one of the best banana bread recipes I've tasted.  Bread turns out very moist and delicious.  I put in about 1 1/2 cups of bananas.  Will be making this many times.

It wasn't the best banana bread we've ever had, but it was OK. I took others' advice and added cinnamon & vanilla, used half white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I  baked about 10 minutes longer and still the bottom was uncooked. I'll keep looking for a great recipe.

I have made this several times, and if I recall correctly, it was after I had tried many of the other recipes listed on the website.  I like this one the best because it gives me the natural taste of banana bread I was looking for, along with the moist texture that is a must with banana bread.  Great recipe and making it again today!

Very Very Good banana bread, with the changes of 1/3c white sugar & 1/3c brown sugar instead of the 1 cup of white, also +1tsp cinnamon and vanilla. I used a white and brown flour mixture and no nuts. Kids loved them.

Goof proof banana bread.  Have made this a couple of times and last time I accidently added ingredients in the wrong order - oops.  Still came out great!  Good with or without nuts and vanilla.  Also makes terrific muffins:  bake at 375 for 15-17 minutes.

Yummy!!!  This is my first time making banana bread.  I did what other reviewers did - substituted 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 brown sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Also, easy to make.  This recipe is a definite keeper!!

I needed breade for donations and this did the trick.  I backed the breads in vegetable cans and they turned out looking like the traditional round boston date breads. They were a great hit and something different looking for gift giving.  If you do the vege cans - spray lightly and flour lightly. When done baking - just cut off the bottom of the can and push the bottom through until the bread comes out. Great Bread - I've lookded for one for a loooong time....Tastes even better if wrapped and let sit overnight.  This is a real keeper!!!

Yum!  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and topped it with additional cinnamon and sugar.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I baked it for 45 minutes at 350 and it came out great!  Very moist and delicious!

Even though I forgot to add the milk, this came out delicious! Only changes I made were to add 1/2 tsp of vanilla as someone suggested, and I also topped the loaf with some coarse sparkling sugar before baking to give the top a crunch. This is the recipe I will use all the time now!

Dry and bland. It was to cake like for me. Try adding 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 tsp vanilla, cut the flour to 1 1/2 c!

I served this banana bread to my husband and his parents and they went wildly crazy over it! A very moist loaf with lots of flavor. I wouldn't change anything to this recipe...but I'd like to try substituting different nuts for the walnuts. Remember not to overmix the batter...it was perfect - no airy holes!

With so many banana bread recipes to choose from, I read the reviews before deciding which one to make.  I'm so glad I went with this one, it's fabulous!  I also added the 1 tsp. cinnamon and vanilla and and extra banana.  I couldn't wait to taste it and had a piece while still warm.  YUM!  Once my husband gets home, it's a goner!  Thanks everyone!

Really good!
This is such a versataile recipe, it comes out really well even when you change many of the ingredients.  I downscaled to 10 servings (I had a smaller loaf pan) added some vanilla, swapped brown sugar for about 1/3 of the white, and subbed chocolate chips for the nuts.  I really recommend this variation.

Best Bananna bread ever!!  I made it to take to a friend.  When I went to wrap it up, half was already gone.  I had to make another.  I added the teasp. each of vanilla and cinn.  and an extra bananna.  I'll never use another recipe.  I also now cover the top with chocolate chips before baking.  Awesome.

Although the flavor of this bread was very good, I found that the suggested cooking time was off by about 20 mins.  My bread came out very dry and overcooked.

This bread rose nicely in my oven.  To make the bread lower-fat, I used only half the margarine called for and replaced the rest of the margarine with applesauce.  The bread turned out delicious and still moist inside.  The walnuts made the bread even more delicious!

I just loved this receipe. I added about one Tablespoon of cinnamon and some pecans and it was so yummy. I sprayed the pans with Bakers Joy and the bread slid right out of the pans. Thanks for the receipe Pat. This one is a keeper at my house! Spiralmaster

This is my family's go-to banana bread recipe because there are no spices - the banana is the flavor star.  It has been no fail every time and there have been times when I've had to soften the butter in the microwave to mix it in.  Melted or soft butter, this recipe still turns out perfectly!

I thought this bread was delicious.  I make no changes when using a recipe for the first time so I can rate it properly and we loved it! The bread wasn't too dense and not too wet. It was very flavorful and the recipe made a large bread. Based on other reviews, I cooked it for 55 minutes (checked it after 50 minutes) and used the oven rack second from the bottom. It was cooked perfectly all the way through. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I've been making this for years now, and it's time to review. This is fantastic. Always comes out perfectly when made  just as the recipe describes. 

Changes? Why, yes...I made changes for my family's tastes.  I use half brown sugar, half white sugar, which makes it taste richer. I use a bit more banana than listed, too...usually about a half cup more per single batch.  I add a cup or more of raisins, which complement the bread beautifully.  I increase the nuts too, by about 50% more.   And while I first did this accidentally, I've continued to choose not to add the milk. Sounds insane, but we simply liked it better this way. 

I think the biggest changes I've made are in how it's baked.  I have the small mini-loaf pans that I use instead of full-sized loaf pans.  I spray them with a no-stick spray like Pam, then instead of using flour, I then coat the pans with white sugar.  This gives the loaves an incredible sweet crispy crust that even withstands freezing and thawing. I give the top a moderate sprinkle of sugar, then bake them. 

The mini pans take roughly half the time to bake the full-sized pans do, and I don't experience the "raw in the middle, cooked on the outside" thing that can happen.  So, 25-30 minutes, my banana bread is done and ready to devour.

Made this in a loaf pan 9x3, the bottom seemed to burn before the middle was cooked.  Next time i'll use and 8x8"   I used 3 1/2 small banans which had black spots on the skin and they were very flavorful.  My family also likes it with pecans and 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips.  Will definitely use again and again.

This is a perfect recipe for basic banana bread.  I added a bit of cinnamon & should have added more + vanilla.  I used 3 bananas which was perfect.

I'm so glad I found this recipe! It makes moist bread every time. The recipe will yield 12 regular size muffins as well. I always add a little more banana, but keep everything else the same. Adding a few chocolate chips makes for a great treat.

Everyone devoured this bread. I made with 3 medium bananas and less than 1/2 cup of butter. Also, I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter.

I also had trouble with this recipe. Like another user said, the center never seems to cook all of the way. So I left in the oven longer, but the bread isn't as moist as I would like it to be now. Maybe less milk will solve this problem.

This was a yummy recipe. I accidentally added 2 eggs instead of one but it was amazing, even with my little error. :) My boyfriend LOVES his mom's banana bread and he said this was just as good!!! =)

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried; it's easy to make, light and moist. The perfect combination!
I did use 3/4 cup brown sugar (lightly packed) instead of caster sugar though. 
I baked half the mixture in muffin cases for 20 minutes and they turned out lovely.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tasted! It's so dense and moist. Pop a little butter on this bad boy and you have the perfect desert with coffee :)
I had to bake about an hour and 5 minutes or so. The top never seems to want to finish in 50 minutes (typical for banana bread time). I also did 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and threw in some cinnamon and sugar on top. 
TRY THIS! YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT :)

Try this recipe! It is simple and easy to make. I have made this several times in the past year, and it always turns out perfect. I follow the exact recipe, adding 1 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1 tsp. of cinnamon for a touch more flavor. Cool and enjoy... thanks for the great recipe!

not a heavy banana cake which is a great change. It turned out very fluffy. Love it. I did substitute butter for margarine, and only used about 1/4 cup of butter and it was just fine.

I used the tips from a previous review and it was amazing. I used 3/4c brown sugar,  1 tsp vanilla, 1 & 1/2 tsp cinnamon and buttermilk in place of milk. Thank you for a great recipe!!!

I ended up using whole wheat all purpose flour instead of white, because I was out. The texture is great. I cooked in a glass pan so I followed others advice, 325 for 50 minutes. I was disappointed that the middle fell after I had it out of the oven for about 30 minutes. I should have increased the sugar a bit, I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white, vanilla, and cinnamon but I think if I had put the crumble sugar top on (as others suggested) it may have sweetened this enough. The bread will still easily get eaten, it just needs some butter or something.

I Loved this recipe. Very moist. And the most important to me, it was so fast and easy to prepare. I made a few additions, even before reading the reviews I added cinnamon (to taste) and because I had many apples I shredded one (you decide the size of the pieces). 
I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, to my taste it came out to sweet, I think because of the sweetness of the apple, so next time I will reduce the sugar by half (you can always pour something on top if necessary to get to your sweet tooth). 
Because I did not know how much it would rise I divided it in 2 9x5 pans. They came out low but were cooked through [that was also a nice way of controlling my portions :-)]. 
This is now my choice for banana bread. And I can see myself varying the other fruits to complement it.
Thank you for sharing.

I really thought banana bread was just banana bread until I made this recipe. Outstanding. Moist and light, even using 1/2 whole wheat flour. Everything else exactly according to the recipe. (which I doubled, then immediately doubled 2 more times!) I got a little freaked out after my second batch was baking I read reviews saying this "needs" spices. Lies. It's amazing as is. If you prefer spices, then go for it, but you won't be disappointed either way.

I used the suggestions of cinnamon, vanilla and 1/2 brown sugar, the flavor was perfect, but it was too moist, the top was still mushy, maybe needed to cook some more, cooked 50 minutes, the second day it tasted even better after liquid had absorbed a bit.

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!! This was the first time I have ever made Banana Bread and I will use this recipe always!! I did what others suggested, added 1/2 tsp cinn and vanilla, and just a dash of extra salt. I had to cook mine for  1hour 10min not sure why and when I took it out of the oven wrapped tinfoil like one person said and THIS WAS HEAVENLY! So moist.  I also added a sprinkle of cinn and sugar mixed on the top so there would be a little "crunch" on top, boyfriend gobbled it up! Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. Did use the 1/2 C dark brown sugar, 1/2 C white sugar and used 3 pretty large sized bananas and added cinnamon and vanilla. I just eyeballed the cinnamon and vanilla. I used egg beaters, lower fat butter and skim milk.  I baked it in a bundt pan for 45 minutes.  Very moist banana bread.   I could have cooked it for maybe 5 more minutes because the inside was a little undercooked but nonetheless it was very moist and delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very delicious, moist and not too sweet!  I made a few of my own changes to the recipe.. I used 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, substituted butter for margarine, brown sugar for white sugar and added one more egg, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I didn't have any loaf pans so I used a muffin pan instead and topped each one with a sprinkle of walnuts (in addition to the walnuts in the mixture).  They turned out beautifully!  A light crust on the outside and very moist inside.  I baked them for about 35 minutes.  Definitely will use this recipe again!

Very good for a first try. I followed ONYX78's advices about the eggs (2 eggs) but substituted the margarine for low-fat butter (my husband has to watch out the cholesterol level..) and I used 3/4 of whole-wheat flour & 1/4 of plain flour. The result is very very goooood.  Thanks Heldenbrabd for sharing your recipe. Rochtur

Good banana bread - baked very well and is moist and not too sweet. Sort of lacking texture and crust. However, this seems a good, reliable, kid-friendly recipe.

Very good, easy to follow recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a 1/2 a cup of extra banana, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I baked it for 50 minutes, then turned the oven off and let it sit for another 10 minutes. I also wrapped it in aluminum foil while warm - a great tip from other reviewers (and my grandma!) for keeping it moist.

Went out of the box and tried a New Banana Bread recipe just to change things up.....so glad I did, this recipe is to good to pass up. It actually came out perfect. I'll be putting the old recipe away for a little while or maybe even for good !

I found this recipe years ago after my stepdad's mom, a master of the banana breadpassed away.  So when my Stepdad tasted this and said, "The mantle has been passed to the next generation," I knew this was a keeper.  I can't tell you how many times I've used this recipe over the years, but it always turns out well.  It's sweet and moist with a crust that softens up as it cools down (if it lasts that long). I love to eat it warm, but I think the flavor is even better the next day. Nanny always wrapped her bread in foil when it was somewhat cooled and I do the same.  I've also had good luck using this recipe to make mini-loaves and muffins.

Made it as a Banana Nut Coffee cake and got rave reviews. Followed the recipe as described and placed in a 9 x 13 pan. I then topped with the following:  All purpose flour     1/2 cup; Brown sugar, packed   1/4 cup + 1 tbsp; Granulated sugar      3 tbsp; Salt                  dash; Cinnamon              1/4 tsp; Nutmeg                1/4 tsp; Vegetable oil         1/4 cup.     Mix all dry ingredients on low setting and slowly add oil until all is mixed in to a crumbly mix. Add to the top of batter (once batter in in pan) and cook for 45 min at 375.

This is the closest recipe that I've found to our family treasure. The biggest changes are to use shortening, 2 eggs, and no milk. I've sent this to my husband multiple times when he's been deployed overseas, and he's reported back that its still just as moist as the day it was baked when he's received it 2 or 3 weeks later. I've also thrown in blueberries or dried cranberries, and subbed the bananas with cooked pumpkin. Love the recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is the best banana bread recipe ever...JUST LIKE IT IS! I made this exactly as it is written and loved it. Very moist and lots of banana flavor. My husband raved about how good this was. Don't substitute or change anything and you will have the perfect banana bread!

This banana bread is wonderful - not too sweet and full of banana flavor.  I follow the recipe, adding 1 tbsp. cinnamon and 2 tsp. vanilla, and end up with a beautiful loaf.  Yummy!

As others have done, I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Instead of 1 cup of sugar, I only added 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Instead of walnuts (allergies) I included 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Very moist and the aroma through the house was incredible!

Loved it! The flavor was very good. I did as others suggested and used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar. Added in 1 tsp. vanilla. I also omitted the nuts just because I didn't have any. Took along time for the center to bake but my oven could be to blame. The best banana bread I have ever made so thanks from the whole family!

This is a great bread.  I subbed 1/4 c. applesauce, 1/4 c. butter.  I also added the vanilla and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  I also added about 1/3 c. peanut butter chips.  I made it into 15 muffins (1/4 cup batter) and my kids loved them!

Very good! I added a little extra banana and decreased oil to 1/3 cup, added half brown sugar and half white sugar, and used whole wheat flour. I also wrapped tin foil over the top of the pans after I took them out of the oven, and let them sit for a half hour to lock in the moisture. Delicious!

If you're looking for a delicious, fluffy banana bread, make this!  I did use this recipe to make muffins, but I'm sure using it the way it was intended is awesome as well.  I will be making this again!  I may add chocolate chips next time just for fun :)

I really liked this banana bread. I liked it better than the banana banana bread recipe because it doesn't use so many bananas. I did make a few changes based upon other reviews: I used 3 bananas and added 3-5 minutes additional cooking time for each banana. I used butter instead of margarine, 1 t cinnamon, 1 t vanilla, 3/4 C brown sugar instead of white and buttermilk instead of regular milk.

This was a great recipe starter! Like always, I tweaked it to suit my tastes. I used 3 large bananas, 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil in place of the butter. I also added some chopped pecans, and cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice. It turned out incredibly moist and absolutely delicious! My boyfriend already has half of the loaf gone in an hour! I will definitely be making this again!

This easy recipe is used monthly in my kitchen and a favorite of my family!  I use 2-3 very ripe bananas per loaf (I usually make a double batch) and and 1/2 tsp vanilla per loaf.  Occasionally I'll add raisins, also.  I have substituted brown sugar in the past, but I have found that following the recipe "as-is" while adding the vanilla produces a wonderful bread.  I like the idea of adding Veg Oil, as suggested by another reviewer, since I definitely plan on making mini loafs for holiday gifts.

This is a fabulous recipe, I substituted the butter for applesauce and reduced the sugar to keep it low fat and healthier. I also put in a bit more banana and it's so moist, I love it!

I've used a lot of banana bread recipes over the years and I have to say this is one of the best. It has a lighter texture than others I've tried and I found that a nice change.  I did use some of the suggestions of others and added more banana and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  Also, I like to use the mini loaf pans instead of the large ones.  I baked them for 45 minutes and they came out perfect.  It was delicious just after it came out of the oven but even better the day after.  All the flavor seemed to pop.  I'll definitely make this one again!

Best recipe for banana bread I've tried! It's so good I cannot make enough! I add some flax seeds to the batter and it comes out super moist!

First time I made this, I read all the reviews, made a few of the suggested amendments, forgot the milk and it was heavenly.  SO this time I made it by the letter but the batter overflowed from the tin about ten minutes into baking & burnt little pancakes all over the bottom of the oven. No idea why this might have happened, except for the addition of milk. Transferred it into a pizza pan to finish baking and now have a banana pizza cooling on the side!

I have been baking banana bread since I was very young and love it today even more because of this recipe! This is by far, the BEST banana bread I have ever made or eaten! Way to go! I upped the salt to 2/3t. and the banana's to around 2 cups though 1.5 cups would have probably firmed it up just a tad. Love it! Oh, if you use the temp method for determining if it is done just note that mine was golden brown and 190 degrees F but the ver center of the loaf was still uncooked. The rest was excellent. Just make sure you do the old time toothpick or butter knife test! Thanks!

I'm not sure where I went wrong, but this bread had a weird texture. It tasted find - I added vanilla and cinnamin, but it was very dense in the middle. I couldn't serve it for brunch to guests, but ate it with my afternoon tea.  I'll try a few other recipes on the website.

My kids ate almost the entire loaf fresh out of the oven.  I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup, 1/2 cup milk instead of 5 Tblsp., and sprinkled the top with brown sugar.  Next time I will probably use 3 bananas instead of 2 to make it a little more moist.  I baked for 55 min.  It was delicious, will definitely use this recipe again!

I love this recipe. The only thing that I change is that I add four overripe bananas that have been frozen and thawed instead of measuring out one cup of mashed bananas. It always turns out wonderful and delicious.

This bread turned out so good!  I did make one change though, and that was I added about a 1/2 cup of frozen blue berries to the batter before I cooked it.  Turned out really moist and tasted great!

This is a really great recipe.  The only problem I have not only with this recipe but with all banana bread recipes is that the top never seems to get done.  If I cook it longer then the rest of it is dry.  
When my bread is done I wrap it in press n seal and it stays so moist!  
Thanks for the recipe!

6 year old says, "It was the best banana bread I've ever tasted! I love it!" 8 year old says, "It's pretty good, just needed to be a little more moist". 26 year old says, "It was very yummy. We did add cinnamon and vanilla which gave a great little extra taste. We used 4 regular sized bananas, but maybe next time we'll use 5. Oh, and one hour should be enough time to bake even with 5 bananas if you want it a little moist.

This banana bread was possibly the best I have ever tasted. I did add about 3/4 cup of strawberries just to change it up a bit and the super sweet banana bread and the sweet/tart taste of the strawberries made it fantastic. I will be using this recipe alot!

considering only being my second time making banana bread, it came out very nice and better than my previous one. after reading some reviews I followed a couple of changes adding 1tsp vanilla and 1cup choc chips. The bread was moist and tasty and not too heavy, unlike my previous attempt didn't get too dark on top while making a large size loaf (I doubled the recipe and  made a large loaf and ring tin of bread. YUM

yum, this is so good. first time I added a tsp of vanilla and chocolate chips, next time I'll add cinnamon and pecans (I like them better than walnuts), and probably I will use a little less sugar, but this is definitely a keeper. thank you :D

I made this recipe and then managed to lose it as I didn't save it before my computer crashed. I've made many recipes since and still kept looking for this one.  It's easy to make, and even though I accidentally used a half a cup of sugar, it still came out with enough banana flavor that it was really good.  I'll never need another recipe. I did add the spices that some of the previous authors suggested.  

Thanks!

HEALTHY VARIATION for those interested in whole grain eating.

These are the changes I made:

1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 cup white wheat flour (King Arthur makes this, found in most grocery stores)
1/2 c. unbleached all-purpose flour

I cut down on the sugar and this was plenty sweet:
1/4 c. white sugar
1/3 c. brown sugar, packed

1 t vanilla
1/4 t cinnamon
1 cup chocolate chips (YUM!!)

Baked for 50 minutes at 350.

Excellent, will make this variation again.

Think it would also have been nearly as good and moist with half of butter replaced with applesauce for even healthier variation.

I loved this recipe so did the whole house and my friends, haha. I used 2 eggs, substituted white sugar for brown sugar, 6 T. of milk, 4-5 medium bananas and 3/4 t. of vanilla. I found it creative and unique to smash the bananas up still in the peel by pressing until the shape was gone - careful to not bust the peel. Slice the top of the banana then squeeze it in the mixture.

Delicious and so very moist.  I followed the advice of others and added and extra egg and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Instead of walnuts I used a cup of chocolate chips.  Yummy.  This recipe is definately going into my book of favorite recipes.

This was very good.  I made a few changes though.  From advice of other reviewers, I decided to add some spice; I added 1 tsp of Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tbsp of Vanilla and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I also used chopped almonds instead of walnuts, and I added dried cranberries to the batter too.

Before baking, I saved some of my almonds and sprinkled them on the top with a little sprinkle of rolled oats for a little crunchy topping.  

I ended up having to bake mine for an extra 20 minutes to get a clean toothpick, but it was so moist, and the outer crust was awesome!

Will definitely make this one again!

I make this banana bread a lot for my kids and co-workers. I have followed other reviewers suggestions and add another egg, an extra banana, vanilla and cinnamon. I have substituted 1/4 cup of non-fat yogurt for 1/4 cup of the margarine - still turns out moist but for less fat. I also use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated. I add either chocolate chips or raisins. I do bake longer than 50 minutes and have no problems with the bread being dry. My loaf would be goopy if I took it out at 50 minute - but my oven may be not hot enough. I've also made these as mini-muffins which turned out great.

well---I wasn't paying attention and omitted the milk and did not realize until it was too late.  I made mini muffins and added vanilla and cinnamon.  Even without the milk they are delicious.  Will try again with the milk this time to taste the difference.

I can't imagine why anyone would want to tinker with this recipe.  It's incredibly good as-is.  The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine.  Also, since I live at an altitude of 4,000 ft., I added 10 mins to the baking time.  It came out moist and very flavorful.  I said to my husband, "This is really good, huh."  And he said, "Dangerously good."  The only sort of negative comment I could possibly make is that the bread was a bit crumbly.  I might try adding another egg next time and hope it doesn't give the bread an eggy taste.

I just made this bread, it turned out quite well, I also used an extra egg, and some cinnamon.  My trick with banana bread is I use 2 cups of the krusteez bread machine white bread mix instead of all purpose flour.  I found this little trick out by accident as I was out of flour one day and used what I had on hand.  You have to cook it about 10 minutes longer, but it comes out so much better.  I've tired different recipes, with and without using the krusteez, huge difference!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Good bread, I used Seattlemommys tips but I must add depending on your ovens temp. and size of loaf pan you may need to bake for longer than 50 minutes, mine came out under cooked using the original suggestion, definately needs choc. chips too! Hubby loved it and will use it again.

I thought that this was an alright banana bread, though everyone else seemed to like it.  If I make it again, I will definitely be doing some tweeking - likely more banana and fewer nuts.

This banana bread was not as dense as some previous recipes I have tried. At first I lamented that it was a bit crumbly, but after a day, it was perfect. Thanks :)

This was the best bananna bread recipe ever!  Like some of the others suggested,  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Threw in 1 tsp. cinnamon but only used the one egg and put some mini chocolate chips in.  It came out moist with a crusty top. This tasted awesome!  I will definitely make this again.

I've been making this bread for over a year now. It is the only banana bread I make and my husband cannot get enough! I make it just the recipe is written except sometimes I add more then a cup of banana, it all depends how many bananas I have on hand.

I make this almost weekly and it is delicious every time!  Following the comments I do add 1 tsp vanilla and the 2 eggs, plus I upp the banana to about 1.5 cups.  Use real butter and use brown sugar for at least half of the called for sugar and you'll have a hit!  I usually add walnuts and cranberries to make a really good bread.  Substiuting chocolate for the walnuts is also another good one.

Some of the best banana bread I've ever had! I even accidently put to much milk in it and it was still fantastic. Taking other advice I added vanilla extract, cinnamon and a little maple extract for kicks. To make it more like a dessert I added some semi-sweetened chocolate chips, kids love it

Followed the recipe exactly as it reads and it was delicious.  Not dry at all.  I did sprinkle a tiny bit of brown sugar on top, just to add a little more sweetness in each bite.  Recipe does not state baking time, so I checked it often.  It ended up taking about 1 hour and 10 minutes to bake.  Very good banana bread.  Thank you!

My daughter and I were looking to use up some very ripe bananas.  We found this recipe and it was awesome.  We've made this several times now and it works perfect every time. We did experiment a bit by adding some chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  We also tried them in mini loaf pans.  Works great and cuts down on the cooking time.  Easier to share too! YUM!

After making a few of the other Banana Breads on the site, I moved on tho this one and no longer feel the need to make others.  This is a keeper.  Followed all recipes to the dot, and this one was by far the best one.  Super Moist and tasted as I would expect a banana bread should taste like.  Delicious

This was my first attempt at making banana bread and it was WONDERFUL!! It smelled so good while it was baking I wanted to eat it as soon as it came out of the oven. I did take others suggestions and added the vanilla and cinnamon, but I have a feeling it would have been great without those also. I may not have baked it long enough. I may try turning the oven off after 50 mins or so, and letting it heat for a little longer next time.My boyfriend is a very, very picky eater and he loved this! My kids kept coming back for more! Thanks so much Pat!

This is a very good banana bread recipe! It comes together really quickly and doesn't need to bake as long as you think. I made it in a silicone pan, baked a little less than 45 mins...you can smell when it's done!

FANTASTIC! 
I have been searching for an awesome banana bread, and this is it!!
I made mini loaf's (doubled the recipe and it made 5 loaf's) added chocolate chips in one, almonds in the next, coconut in the next, a plain one & a banana split (raisons, smarties & nuts) all were to die for!

This bread was absolutely delicious and one of the best banana breads I've ever had. I used my microwave convection oven and it took only 45 mins to get done.  Next time I think I will add some cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers.  Great recipe!!

Wonderful banana bread!! The only changes I made were: self-rising flour (this is the only kind of flour I use) instead of all-purpose so I didn't need the baking soda, baking powder and salt; and I used 1 large and 3 medium mashed ripened bananas. (I didn't want to throw them out, so I just threw them all in the bread.) Very excellent. Even good with peanut butter on top!

Loved it.  Very moist and great banana flavor.  Only used 3 bananas, I don't often have more than that.  Some recipes on this site call for a lot more than 3.  I did substitute half whole wheat flour and half brown sugar for white.  Used butter instead of margarine.  Turned out great.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Great recipe! Will defenately make again! I added a teaspoon of cinnamon because I love cinnamon so much but  it's also great without! Next time I might try with cardamom.

I love banana bread and with a cup and a half of bananas instead of 1 cup it was so good. I also used pecans. YUM.

I made the recipe as muffins, and they were very tasty.  I was surprised by how thick the batter was, but the muffins turned out just fine.    I added the vanilla and spices as suggested by others.  Definitely the best banana bread recipe that I've tried thus far.

This was a great recipe to start with, I made a few changes and produced a delicious loaf of banana bread!  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I added vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves as well as raisins, since we love 'em!  I also substituted fat free sour cream for the butter and used about 1/2 cup extra banana!  Healthier and oh so tasty!!!

The best banana bread I have had. It was not to dense and baked perfectly. I did not add the extra egg and it is fine. I baked mine in a 9x13 metal pan for 38 minutes and it is perfect!

This was an excellent recipe!  As per a few previous reviews, I did add a little cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  I baked mine as muffins rather than loafs, but the end result was fantastic!  The recipe is more of a cake rather than a bread, so make sure that is what you're looking for when choosing a recipe.  Will definately make this one again.  My husband loves it!

Best banana bread I'VE had!  I used half brown sugar instead of all white sugar, added about a tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and used half and half instead of milk.  The bread was very moist and delicious!

Tasted just right, I grated a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to my taste, replaced a little white sugar with  brown and didn't really measure the bananas.   Perfect!

Yummy! I left out the nuts because I'm nuts enough. Husband loved it and he doesn't normally like banana bread. Baking time was about 45-50 minutes - average time for banana bread.

Great recipe! And by the way, it can't be messed up by even the most amateurish chefs out there! My husband and I made a batch of these and since we had lots of leftover ripe bananas, we decided to mix up another batch. I left it to my husband, who scarcely measured, mixed in the wrong order, etc. and it still turned out just as good as the first loaf. The banana flavour is prominent, as it should be since it is a banana bread, and YUMMY. This is a keeper.

Hhhmmmm...not sure why so many liked this recipe?! I'm not saying it was terrible but I sure didn't think it was Great! It was a bit bland for me. I followed the recipe exactly. I love bananna bread and have tried about 15 different recipes but this is not one I will make again. Not sure what was missing but something was not right for me!

This made a very nice bread that the whole family enjoyed. It also made excellent muffins. I just made the recipe again, but couldn't find my loaf pan. (I think its at work.) So I took a chance, grabbed a muffin tin, sprayed it, and filled each of the 12 spots equally with the batter. I turned the oven down to 325F and watched it bake. After exactly 20 minutes I had perfect, yummy banana muffins that popped out of the tray. Thanks!

This is absolutely the best banana bread I have ever tasted!  It smells heavenly, too!  I thought that I did not like banana (nut) bread, but I could not resist the smell when my cousin (in law) brought this to our tea party.  I have made it several times since then, it tastes just as good with half whole wheat flour and half white.

Awesome recipe.  Much tastier than other such recipes.  Used 3 costco bananas (are they medium or large?  Dunno.) and 2 c of coarse whole wheat flour (also Costco!) instead of white flour.  Added some ground flax meal on top.  Butter instead of margarine.  Using my convection oven, this baked very quickly when separated into two pans (less than 30 minutes!).  Moist and delicious.  Doesn't taste "healthy" at all!  Nice crunchy top.

For me this was a good cake but not outstanding like I had expected. The changes I made were using the oil and apple sauce as recommended (yielding a nice moist result), using extra bananas and wholewheat flour.  Next time I will follow the recipe to the tee and see if it comes out amazing, as some of these reviews claim!

This banana bread is THE BEST banana bread I have ever made. I made it how others said (1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar) and a little extra banana. The bread turned out extremely moist (I cooked it for about 65 minutes) and had a great banana flavor--I can't say enough good things about this bread!! Thanks for the recipe!

Super Good! Other then using soft brown banana's and adding an extra one in there.. it was great. I followed the recipe exactly. I served it topped with Banana Foster and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Whats really good, and if you have the time. Is soften the vanilla ice cream a bit and mix a bit of cinnamon in. So Dreamy and very impressive..

All I can say is YUMMY!!!!  I also did the 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup sugar and added cinnimon and vanilla.  I did make one little mistake of adding 2 eggs instead of one.  I was worried of what it would do~but appears to have done nothing to ruin the recipe!  My husband has never like my bananna bread and I can't wait for him to get home.  I will definatly keep this recipe around.

This is fantastic! This is one of the very first things I baked in my new apartment, with minimal of space and supplies, and it came out wonderful! My boyfriend scarfs down this yummy bread fresh out of the oven. The only thing I changed was adding some vanilla, and swapping out some white sugar for brown. I also sprinkle brown sugar on top to give it a sweet crust. I'm working on making my third or fourth loaf in a matter of a couple weeks.

This is a great one, especially if you follow the advice of others.  I mixed the brown & white sugars, added 1 t. of vanilla & a 1/2 t. of cinnamon. This is great hot out of the oven with melted butter!

Followed the recommendations below and modified the recipe to 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 light brown sugar and a tsp. of vanilla extract. The bread looks as good as it tastes and my house smells wonderful!!  Will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious- simple, easy!  I even used Splenda for Baking (to reduce sugar and calories) and it was scrumptious.  My 5 year old and 10 month old couldn't get enough of it.  I made some mini muffins as well as small loaves.  Thanks, Pat, for the yummy recipe!

I've made this bread 2 different ways: (1) all white sugar and (2) 1/2 white, 1/2 brown.  They're both good but I think the way with the 1/2 brown sugar is a bit sweeter.  I also used every time butter instead of margarine, added 1 t. vanilla, omitted the nuts and used 1 1/3 c. banana.  Baked for 70 minutes.  Used the recipe for mini muffins and it made 3 dozen.  So easy and delicious.  Gave it 4 stars due to the modifications.

I really could have used a cooking time for this.  I forgot all about it (don't have a timer either) and burnt the bottom of the loaf.  The rest of it was wonderful!  Thank you!

Wow, this one might have replaced my standby banana bread recipe! I followed everyone's recommendation of using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and doubled the recipe to make 2 smaller loaves in aluminum tin pans. Added chopped pecans and chocolate chips, and baked the 2 loaves for a good 70 minutes and another 10 minutes at 325 to ensure the inside wasn't pudding. Delicious!! I've been in a friendly competition with my boyfriend's mom for his preferred banana bread, and this one won. lol

GOOD OLD FASHIONED BANANA BREAD !  I substituted 1 TBSP of sour cream for the egg. In addition to greasing and flouring the pan, I also lined the bottom with parchment paper so that the bread would bake evenly.  My pans may be poor quality, who knows, but in using the paper, I had excellend results. Nice texture, great taste. I started by baking it for 40 minutes and then added 5 minute intervals until it was light brown and cracked.

On a whim I added a couple of squirts of lemon juice instead of vanilla.  As mentioned by others, I also added cinammon and nutmeg, replaced 1/3 cup of white sugar with 1/3 cup of brown sugar, used butter instead of margerine, and sprinkled the top with cinammon and sugar.  The bread was delicious.

I made it twice..it was ok.  Ater the first attempt I purchased and used a stone loaf pan in hopes it would help the bread cook more evenly, but both attempts were the same..by the time the center tested done..the edges were over done.  Think I'll move on to a different recipe.

Wow, this was good!  I don't even like bananas and I thought it was pretty tasty (my boyfriend, for whom I made it, thought it was absolutely scrumptious).  It was more muffin consistency than bread, though. Tip: If you're a poor college student like me and can't afford to go out and buy a bread pan, making it in a pie pan works just fine. :)

excellent banana bread !!!! I made one small loaf pan with walnuts and 5 muffins without nuts for my toddler.  I did use 1/3 brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon like many others.  I lined the loaf pan with wax paper to prevent sticking baking it at 325 for 55 min for the loaf and 30 for the muffins.

Great recipe!  I've made this bread twice.  The first time I used 1-1/4 cups of bananas.  The second time I used 1-1/2 cups.  I liked it better with the 1-1/4 cups.

I used this recipe to make muffins, and they came out great! I took other suggestions to add more banana (3 altogether), 1 tsp. cinnamon & vanilla. I also left out the milk (I'm lactose intolerant). I sprayed the muffin pans with Pam canola oil spray, and filled each cup with the batter (I ended up getting 13 muffins out of it!), and baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. I took them out, because they looked done, but after testing w/ a toothpick, they were still uncooked in the middle. So I put them back in for another 10 minutes on 325. These were the best muffins I've ever made!

Very good loaf, easy, simple ingredients. I had to use shortening instead of margarine, but it turned out great anyway. Loaf was a little crusty at first, but after storing overnight in an air tight container was moist and soft. I will use this again.

I made this tonight and it came out very well!  It was so moist and delicious!  I added a tsp of vanilla as suggested, used 3 med-lg. bananas and added pecans since I didn't have walnuts.  This is certainly a keeper in our house!

Just got done baking this recipe for the second time.  It has got the best flavor and texture for banana bread that I have had in a long time.  Most banana breads tend to be slightly solid and a "rubbery" but this one not solid at all.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is an excellent banana bread, not too much sugar or other filler, and full of warm banana flavor.  I like the addition of milk to the recipe--it really prevents the loaf from being too dry or crumbly.  Overall, I consider this to be a wonderful basic banana loaf.

This was a very decent recipe.  The bread was nice and moist, and I am sure my husband will absolutely inhale the rest of it!  It is a little saltier than what I am used to, if that is possible -- the recipe didn't call for much. So I am confused!  But overall, a good banana bread.  I think I will try out a few more recipes, though.

This banana bread is absolutely delicious! The milk definitely makes a difference. I did alter the recipe a little by adding 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of vanilla and I sprinkled the top with a little cinnamon & sugar. Very good!! I would definitely recommend this recipe! Thank you!

I've tried a lot of different banana bread recipes looking for perfection (some with sour cream or choc. chips or other fancy ingredients) - but this is by far the best one!  I've never made a bad loaf yet - it has turned our perfectly every time! I add 1 tsp vanilla, omit the nuts, and bake at 335 for 50 min.

Only because I love vanilla....I put 1 tablespoon of vanilla into the batter and I put brown sugar into the batter instead of white sugar.  It turned out awesome!

The recipe could have been better written... list ingredients in order that you’re using them, and mention them all in the instructions. I missed the milk because of this, but in all fairness it turned out fine without any milk. I also reduced the sugar.

I make a few changes to this banana bread and everyone loves it! Instead of nuts I use toffee bits and mini choc chips. Today I ran out of toffee so I used caramel bits, peanut butter chips and chocolate chips! I also switched out the regular milk for Ripple pea milk!

Fantastic recipe! Exactly what I was looking for in a banana bread recipe! Most recipes on here call for A TON of overripe bananas, but I only ever have around 2 leftover bananas. Do people actually buy bananas just to make banana bread? lol I made this recipe even quicker and easier on myself, by using one bowl and not sifting the dry ingredients. Just mix up the wet, dump in the dry and you got a great loaf of banana bread! I used half brown, half white sugar, added black walnuts and baked at 350 for 30 minutes, then dropped it to 325 for another 30 minutes. Came out perfectly! Thanks so much for my new go to banana bread recipe!

I have never been a cook.  I just started trying different things to make.  I love banana's and needed to use a bunch of ripe ones.  I tried this and my son who is really picky told me how good it was, and told me I should make things from scratch more often.  This was the best, it was moist and tasted like heaven.   I would highly recommend this

Great recipe. The first time I made it I cut recipe on half. The second time I used the batter to make a cranberry bread. The granddaughter loved it. One change I made was to add vanilla flavor. Thanks

Great recipe! Like others, I used three medium bananas; two eggs instead of one; half brown sugar and half granulated sugar; added 1 tsp of vanilla. I also used 1/2 cup ground flaxseed combined with 1.5 cups flour instead of two cups flour. I used cinnamon chips rather than the nuts because that is what I had on hand. Very moist and sweet! Could possibly have used less sugar.

This was followed to letter but needed a little more baking time.  One hour should be followed as in the recipe.  Was delicious.  Added a bit of nutmeg to mar the egg smell.  Next time will check for doneness before removing  from the oven.  Did not last long after it was done.

This banana bread is a hit with the family. I follow it pretty closely. I may add an extra banana just depending on what I have on hand and also I’ll add a little bit of vanilla extract and cinnamon.

I used butter instead of margarine and eliminated the  nuts.  Butter gave it a richer flavor, I also added some vanilla and almond extracts. I baked in small loaf pans for a bake sale. Is a very good recipe, simple and it all goes together nicely!

Best banana bread I ever made. It is super moist and everyone loved it. It is a go to now for banana bread. I did do a couple of changes. I used 2 eggs and I used 4 Tablespoons of Milk instead of the 5 that it calls for.

Super yummy and moist.  I added a touch of cinnamon, a touch of vanilla extract, mixed 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and mixed in chocolate chips to the batter before baking. It's a hit in my household. I make it very often. Works perfect with gluten free flour mix and lactaid milk.

I made many different banana bread recipes in the span of a few weeks because of how frustrated I was with the results I was getting. Breads were either too dry, not enough flavor came through, too dense, or otherwise unsatisfactory. Finally, I landed on this one!! I think the buttermilk really is key to making this such a moist but light bread. This recipe has helped me yield the perfect banana bread. Since I adjusted from the original recipe, I gave it 4 stars, to be fair to the original content. I followed reviewer Janet's advice and here are my changes: 1 heaping tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar, butter not margarine, 2 eggs, and did not add nuts. I did not measure out specifically the mashed bananas, I simply mashed 3 medium sized bananas. The last note I wanted to make is that I have now made two perfect batches of this with Trader Joe's Gluten Free all-purpose flour (my family has a couple of wheat allergies), and the bread is still amazing. I know GF substitutions can sometimes be iffy, so I wanted to note that in case anyone else is looking to modify for allergies. With the modifications, it's is now my perfect go-to recipe and I won't be changing a thing! Thanks for such a great start.

The only changes I made was using unsalted butter  - I don't care for margarine - and using only ghee to grease the pans. (one 8"x4" and 1 mini - I wanted the mini to try it for myself before giving away the larger loaf)
I chose this recipe because I had a touch over 1 cup mashed bananas and  my tried and true Betty Crocker requires more.
As it was baking, I read the reviews (a little backward, right?) and used a thermometer to make sure it was done - afterward, I went to print a copy and saw the 1 hour bake time at the top of the web recipe. :\ That's ok, since I never thought to use a thermometer before, I learned something new.
I let the mini rest for 15 minutes, removed from the pan, waited 10 more minutes then cut into it. Yep, it crumbles apart very easily so hoping that if I let it cool a bit longer, that won't be an issue .... that said, I really like the flavor and it's very moist. It's quick, simple and looks beautiful so a winner in my book. I will likely play around with cinnamon et al next time for a holiday version but don't feel that it's necessary to do every time.
FYI - when I have bananas that have gone too far on me, as long as the skin is undamaged I will throw them in the freezer as is. Out of the freezer, I'll put what I think I need onto a dinner plate until they are mostly thaw, run cool water over them if any frost remains, pat dry, break off stem and squeeze into bowl from that top opening. The pulp will be very dark in most cases but I feel the bana

This bread was moist and very good. My family said they would like me to make this again.  I read many of the reviews and the same suggestions were listed by so many that I decided to follow the suggestions.  I used half cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I gave four stars because of the confusion with the cooking time.  After cooking mine at 350 for 1 hour it still was not done.  I turned down temp to 325 for last 10 minutes.  Next time I will cook for 350 for30- 45 minutes and turn temp down to 325 for rest of bake.  I was baking in a glass loaf pan that may have affected the cooking time.  I did wrap it in foil while still warm to help it stay moist since I felt like the outside was very brown.

Well, I made it and would have given it a 5 star, but after I took it out of the pan and cut 2 slices, I noticed the center of the bread caved it.  I lifted a piece of the crust on top and it was still raw inside!  I don't understand because when I put the toothpick in it several places, it came out clean!  As I write this I put it back into the oven to see if I can finish baking it. I baked it for 50 minutes as every suggested.   This is the first time in all my years making banana bread that this happened.

This was good on the parts that were cooked. I made it to the recipe and even checked the temp to 190 as someone recommended. There was still an area in the top middle that was not cooked. 
I cooked it in convection for 50 minutes at 350....then another 10 (covered in foil) when the middle wasn’t cooked.  Then another  :10 at  200 when the middle wasn’t cooked. Any suggestions?  The part that was cooked was great. But by the end the rest was overdone. 

Thanks

This is my go to banana bread recipe. I have made so many versions of this bread over the years and it turns out every time and gets so many rave reviews. To make double chocolate chip bread I sub out 1/4 to 1/2 cups flour with cocoa and replace walnuts with chocolate chips. I add a half teaspoon of cinnamon and some vanilla and it is so good. I’ve made a vegan version replacing milk with almond milk, egg with egg replacer and  butter with earth balance and it tastes the same. Best banana bread recipe!

Just made this on a whim with my 3 year old son, he wanted banana bread so I looked through the cabinets and found what I needed for thus recipe. It’s delicious and so easy! It was my first time making banana bread from scratch, I will definitely be making this again and again!

You know, when you make any kind of a change to these recipes then it's not the same recipe. people who change these recipes should not be writing reviews!!  I followed this recipe to the T and it made the most wonderful banana bread! I loved it and am changing to this one and throwing my old one out!  It was a very simple and delicious banana bread

This recipe is perfect. This is the way banana bread is supposed to taste. Just like Grandma used to make. Do not add anything unless you don't like the taste of bananas.

I substituted a blend of whole grain flour instead of white flour. I was afraid it would come out dry, but it's fantastic. Moist and delicious. Will be my go-to recipe for banana bread.

Easy to make and tasted fine, but kind of dry and mild flavoured. I didnt alter any ingredients, but next time may add a 3rd banana, and perhaps a little more milk.  I baked in the Perfect Petites Pan for 30 mins.

I never made a banana bread before - this was great!!!! The suggestion from mommyfromseatle review to add the cinnamon & vanilla was perfect, moist and made it amazing. I used a slightly smaller pan, so I cooked it for 50 mins then tooth picked the middle, just right, will easily make this again. Thanks!!!

Very good.  I've made this a couple of times and it seems to work out well when I make two small loaves out of the one recipe.  I do add vanilla and cinnamon, and use  2 bananas.  It's   a pretty simple banana bread that everyone (my family and neighbors) seems to enjoy.

I made a gluten/dairy free version that came out amazing!  I only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar, replaced the butter with coconut oil, used non dairy milk (same amount), added 2 tsp of Cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla and dash of nutmeg. After baked, I covered the bread in the pan with aluminum foil (seals in the moisture). Definitely making again.

A five star recipe as is but I vary it depending on mood and what I have on hand. For example, if I have 3 bananas that's all I use but will go up to 5 if I have them. I like to swap out up to half the flour for jumbo oats sometimes my fav variation is to add cinnamon sugar to the buttered pan before I add the batter. Makes the crust over the top delish.

Decided to try a new recipe. Boy I'm glad I did. Don't get all carried away make it just as the recipe says. Perfect, moist and tasty. I made two to test my new double ovens and they both took 50 minutes instead of an hour.

I did everything what was written above but mine was a little salty I think hence next the I'll try less salt than mention in the recipe. Also I tried black grape instead of nuts since my mom is allergic to it. Although I am a newbie in the kitchen, it was an easy and enjoyable recipe to do it.

If you are baking in a non stick pan,  bake at  325 degrees.  I have baked this, at both temperatures, and I find that at 325 you get less of a dome top (my preference)

This is THE BEST banana bread recipe I have ever found! I have made this more than times than I can count. It freezes really well, so you can make several and squirrel them away. I have also tried out a number of variations and substitutions. I typically just use 2 bananas, I don't measure it out, and I chop them up finely. I often use wheat flour for all or part of the flour portion. You can use almond milk or soymilk instead of dairy milk. And I have substituted applesauce for the butter to make it a bit healthier (since it's basically banana cake). It's less sugary that way, but very moist. You can also substitute part or all of the sugar with brown sugar to make it a little denser and darker. And I add a tsp of vanilla extract, too, for flavor. Adding walnuts and some cinnamon takes it to the next level! I always cook exactly 50 minutes and it's perfect.

I made this recipe without any changes and it was delicious.  It's the best Banana Bread I've ever made.  My husband normally never eats breads or desserts, but he ate almost the whole thing by himself, of course he adds Bourbon Cream and Whipped Cream to it also.  I will definitely be making this again and again - whenever I have very ripe bananas.

The best banana bread I've made yet! No oats, not too many bananas (so that it's mushy). This is a perfect recipe. I wish that it was written better to easily follow, but I can fix it when I print.

This bread is great. I also used 1.5 cups banana, and instead of margarine I used applesauce.  And no sugar--just 4 tablespoons of Truvia.  Very delicious recipe that is easily modified. I, too, added cinnamon and vanilla.  It lasted 4 days, then it started to turn so if you want  it to last longer stick it in the fridge.  Oh, no milk--cashew milk.

This was delicious and moist! I only used two large bananas and 3/4 c brown sugar and it was plenty sweet. Baked for 40 minutes exactly in 350 oven. New favorite. Will be making again!

Awesome. Easy  recipe, mix the dry together, mix the wet together, combine the 2 and bake. I used 4 bananas because they wouldn't have lasted another day; took another reviewer's suggestion of using buttermilk and steaming after baking. So very yummy.

These turned out GREAT as mini-muffins, even in my crappy old muffin tins. I used MommyFromSeattle's advice in her review and added the spices and vanilla, and substituted 3/4c Brown Sugar in place of the 1c white sugar. The muffins came out banana-y, soft, and just the right amount of chewy.

I have a convection oven, and I set them to cook for about 35 minutes at 325.

The one and only recipe I use. This is so dense it's so good! It reminds me of the banana bread at Bob Evans. I will never make anything but this recipe. I wish I could arrange my recipes so this recipe showed first every time.

I chose this recipe because it didn't use sour cream.  Don't need the added fat and calories.  In a glass pan it takes more than an hour to bake.  Added vanilla and chocolate chips.  Everyone loved it and keeps asking for more!

This was the first time I have made banana bread that cooked through evenly and everyone loved it!  I took into account other reviewers suggestions and used 3 (slightly over-ripe) bananas, 2 eggs, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1.5 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla, 1.5 tsp salt. I also left it in after I turned off the oven for an additional 5 minutes then wrapped it in tin foil after I removed it from the oven for half an hour.  I am excited to make this again.

Easy and Yummy! My kids and I made these this morning with our overly ripe bananas. We added a cup of chocolate chips to the mix at  the end.  We divided the batter up in a muffin tin to make 12 yummy muffins. Baked at 350 for 30 mins. (golden brown on top.) This is our new go to recipe when we have leftover bananas!

I used PA_NUNN's suggestions in the reviews and omitted their suggested nutmeg. I also followed another reviewer and used about 1 1/4 cups bananas (3 bananas) and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. It took awhile to cook, but was WELL worth await! My whole family said it was better than store bought.

So I added a little twist to my families favorite treat.  I added 3/4 cup of peanut butter (I only use Jiff creamy).  It adds just a hint of yummy flavor.  Next time I may go with a full cup, you could taste the peanut butter, but not as much as I would like.  They usually put peanut butter on their banana bread so for them they need a more robust peanut butter flavor.  But they LOVED it.  Kind of a nice change to the norm.

I make banana bread now and then....but none of the recipes have been like the tall, rich loaf of banana bread I made years ago....until this one!!!  It was great!! I made two loaves, followed the recipe exactly...........used 1/2 margarine and 1/2 butter...added chopped walnuts and baked the loaves for 60 minutes. My family raved about it!  I did add 1 1/2tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla as one reader suggested. I also used buttermilk, instead of regular milk.  This was the best quick bread I've made in years!

I liked this banana bread. It was soft but not airy. A top reviewer suggested vanilla and cinnamon. I kept it as is despite not normally seeing banana bread without at least vanilla. I am glad I did because the flavor tasted really balanced as is. My only change was using salted butter instead of margarine. So, I cut the salt by half. I also was out of milk, but had a little cream and subbed that. It took 2 1/2 small-medium bananas. I also added the optional walnuts and recommend that. I baked it for 50 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer, however a few pieces in the center seemed like they needed a little longer. So, I would add about 5-7 more minutes next time. ty

I made it exactly as directed and it came out perfect. Needed an extra 15 minutes of cooking time, though but could be because my oven is a little unreliable. I did use an electric mixer. No changes. Great as is. Will definitely make again!

This was the best recipe for banana loaves I have ever tried.  I did add vanilla and cinnamon, substituted brown sugar instead of white.  I did not have buttermilk on hand so I added Apple cider vinegar to milk.  Split them into 2 smaller loaves, they were done way before 50 minutes Covered with foil at the end, they came out super moist.  Everyone loved them!

I deviated only using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Doubled the recipe and used 5 very ripe bananas. Used wheat flour, cooked in 5x9 loaf pans, and did not flour pans but found clean testers at 55 minutes, then shut oven off and left them for 10 more. My oven has a convection conversion and it has become my most favorite baking method. Most favorite? It's good, it's moist, I've made so many over time that this one isn't most memorable so my search continues.

The banana bread came out great, BUT not without a number of modifications (hence the 3 star rating).  I really wanted to add a bit more than the recipe called for--for enhanced flavor, so I consulted the other reviews.  The changes I made were:  added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg; used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar; used buttermilk instead of regular milk; and added 2 tbsp. vegetable oil (for prolonged moisture).  I used 3 medium-sized bananas, which may have come to a bit over 1 cup when mashed.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top after adding the batter to the loaf pan.  Per another reviewer, I baked the bread at 325 degrees since I was using a glass loaf dish.  I baked it for 60 minutes, but will likely reduce by at least 5 minutes next time for optimal moisture.  Per another reviewer, I tightly covered the loaf for 30 minutes after removing from the oven (careful, it's hot!) to enhance moisture.

With these changes, the banana bread came out great--especially for my 1st time ever making it!  My boyfriend said it was so good, he doesn't need to get his banana bread from Starbucks anymore!  :-)

I can honestly say that this is the best "base" banana bread recipe I have ever tried. This gives you a fantastic, moist, perfect density bread. I added to the recipe 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract and it was absolutely delicious!

In spite of baking it for over an hour at 350, half of it was raw through the top. Not sure what I did wrong. Only thing I can think of is that I used 4 bananas and didn't measure exactly how much that was. But that being said, the bread that was cooked thoroughly was absolutely delicious. Like another reviewer suggested I used cinnamon sugar to coat the inside of the greased pan and I put a layer of white and brown sugar with some ground walnuts on the top. I will try this one again and be more careful to put only the listed amount of banana in it.

I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. I did not have milk so I used yogurt( strawberry/banana). Using a convet oven it took exactly 50 minutes. It is so moist and delicious. I will be making this very easy recipe all the time.

I followed the recipe as given. It is delicious and moist. This is not an oily dense bread, but rather a lighter one that still has alot of banana taste. The reason I took away one star is that it falls apart easily. I will try adding a second egg the next time I make it.

What I like about this recipe is I always have all the ingredients. I freeze my bananas when they're getting too recipe, then quickly defrost about three of them for this recipe. I've been making this for years and love it, but I do reduce the sugar without any impact!

I have made this recipe with some of the added suggestions no less than 6 times in the last month and a half.  I use half white and brown sugar as well as 1tsp Vanilla, 1 heaping tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I also now do as another reviewer recommended and I wrap it in foil to steam as soon as it comes out of the oven and the loaf pan.  This bread never lasts very long around my house or my workplace for that matter!  I have a loaf baking in the oven right now and can't wait to have a warm, buttered slice with my tea before bed!  It stays moist and it's not too dense.

This has been my go-to banana bread recipe for about 8 years now.  The only thing I have done differently is to split the sugar 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white.  This was a recommendation that my husband found years ago and it always comes out great.  Recently, I was looking for a blueberry banana bread recipe and just decided to add blueberries to this recipe instead of reinventing the wheel.  SOOOO delicious!!!!  Great as muffins too!!!

Exceptionally good! I did as suggested and made the one change and additions -- 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I had a bag of pecans in the freezer so substituted those instead of walnuts. Just ate my first slice and it's heaven. I'm tossing out the old banana bread recipe. This one is a keeper!

I made this using the variations that my son suggested, and it was EXCELLENT.  The changes were to substitute half of the sugar with brown sugar, add a teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I was out of milk, so I used fat free half and half.  This will be my new go-to banana bread recipe.

I did the 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1tsp. Vanilla, & 1/2 tsp cinnamon version mentioned earlier.  I made 12 muffins instead.  I baked them 25 minutes.  Very good!

Only recipe I use (with a few small modifications) and it turns out perfectly every time! I usually use 4 bananas, half brown sugar instead of all white sugar, and add 1/2 tbsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tbsp. vanilla. Bake about an hour to 70 minutes. Yum!

I made two batches of this, one a bread and the other was muffins. I thought that its lacking something. I added vanilla, lemon zest and cinnamon to liven up the flavor and it was still bland. It wasn't bad...it wasn't good....it was void, void of flavor. For the amount of time I spent and the baking materials I used I would say hands down that it was not worth the time, effort or product used to make and I will not be making it again.

This is very simple and amazingly great!  My husband raved that it was one of the moistest banana breads that he's ever had.  This is now our "go-to" when the bananas get too brown to eat.

I absolutely love this recipe! I added a tsp. Of vanilla, doubled the amount of salt, and sprinkled in some cinnamon and chocolate chips, and it was perfect! I plan on adding a bit of brown sugar the next time, as some previous users have suggested.

This is my go to recipe when it comes to making old fashioned banana bread.  I do substitute half the sugar for brown sugar and add in vanilla. It's wonderful and turns out great every time.

Made this in a hurry and without thinking.  Made all the recommended changes but followed none of the steps, even adding the soda and baking powder after mixing it with a hand mixer. I dumped all of the individual ingredients into the bowl on top of each other without sifting or creaming.  I made them in mini muffin tins and they still TURNED OUT FANTASTIC!  Highly recommend!

just took these out of the oven. Made 10 perfect sized muffins. omitted nuts,for lack of them, added 1t cinnamon, 1/4t nutmeg, 1.5t vanilla, 3/4 cup turbinado sugar rather than 1c white. everything else the same except cooking time was halved (30 min) due to being muffins instead of loaf.  perfectly moist, crunchy top, not too sweet, excellent banana flavor. SAVED TO RECIPE BOX!

Update: just made this vegan. replaced egg with 1T ground flax seed, used 4 medium bananas for bananas and to sub for margarine. used soy milk instead of cows milk. Omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg this time and opted for a handful of dark chocolate chips.  PERFECT AGAIN. Love this recipe!

This was awesome! Added a dash of cinnamon, left out nuts. I used 1/2 cup liquid I can't believe its not butter with the sugar, then add in bananas and egg. Next time I will try with a bit of vanilla too!  Or half white and half brown sugar.

This turned out to be the best banana bread I've ever made. I actually doubled the recipe and took some advice from other reviewers. I did half white sugar, half brown sugar, added vanilla and cinnamon. I also topped it with a little crumbled brown sugar. It was moist, a little crisp on the outside but moist and flavorful on the inside. With the additions it is a 5-Star recipe!

I made this last night, the first "bread" of any kind, and it turned out wonderful. I did read the reviews first, and was very careful not to over stir. I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out so nice!! Perfectly!! I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to it, but that was all I did different. Wonderful flavor!!

Very tasty! The only revision I made was to add 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, but I think another egg would be better, as the bread is crumbly.

Felt like this recipe needed something.  I think adding vanilla extract would help.  Perhaps using some brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar would also help.  However, I did like the moistness of the bread.  Another banana bread recipe that I had previously tried was too
dry.  So, I added a couple of tablespoons of milk to that recipe.  Problem solved.

I loved this recipe, but had a problem...I  baked it for 50 min at 325 because I used a glass loaf pan.  The top looked gorgeous and cracked just like it said it would. As it cooled, I took a look at the entire top caved in..and underneath you could see it was underbaked and mushy......BUT...the rest was baked perfectly....hmmmm...Did I have it on the wrong oven position?  Any ideas?

Delicious! I made a double batch. I omitted the nuts because i did not have any, but other than that...followed to a tee. Perfect recipe. To me, the sugar to banana ratio was perfect. Fluffed up nicely, browned on the top nicely and super moist. Yum!

This turned out great! It took a little over an hour to cook (a lot longer than I expected). The only reason I didn't give it more stars is because it would have been nice it was a little more healthy for you. All that sugar and butter, yikes! But still very delicious!

Made this 2-3 times and was disappointed. It never tasted sweet enough, banana-y enough, and also was a little bitter due to the fact that Baking soda requires an acid, like buttermilk, yogurt or sour cream. So, this time I substituted sour cream for the regular milk. I also reduced the salt and added more banana. We'll see how it turns out this time.

just made it... excellent and easy recipe. even though I missed the baking soda and the walnuts and I also ran out of all-purpose-flour and used 1/2 a cup whole wheat flour to make it to 2 cups in total, it went fine and it is delicious.

After trying a dozen banana bread recipes, I can now rejoice because THIS RECIPE IS IT! The bread is very easy to make and bakes quickly (I agree with another poster that the baking time is about 50 minutes). This one's a definite keeper!

Use butter not margarine, omit the powder and the salt you do not need it and add a dash of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. Very good!

This really is the best banana bread I've ever had. I also used half brown sugar as suggested (I mix my own with white sugar + molasses), and I used half butter, half virgin coconut oil. It was even great without nuts, though I would've enjoyed some walnuts and/or pecans in this if I had them! What a great way to use up those bananas that keep getting old before I eat 'em. :)

I've tried a lot of banana bread recipes and this is definitely the moistest I've tried and not overly dense either! I changed mine very slightly by using half all-purpose and half wheat flour and also used slightly less sugar with half white and half brown. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg, but don't feel that's necessary if you don't prefer the cinnamon flavor. I will definitely be saving this one and making it a standby!

This was a really good banana bread. It was easy to make and easy to understand when it came to directions. My family enjoyed eating it and it turned out better than the recipe for the banana banana bread that my mother tried. It will definitely be a permanent staple in our kitchen.

I followed others suggestions and added 1/2 sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla.  I baked it 60 minutes and it turned out a little over done  even though when testing it, it looked like it should be in longer. (next time, I'm going to bake 50 minutes regardless).  I used my mixer to add the wet and dry together and the bread turned out very dense.  I should have just used the mixer to cream the butter and sugar than fold in rest.  I will try this again with my corrections (and adding chocolate chips).  I am giving this a 4 because it did taste good, it just needs some adjustments.

I've tried other recipes and this one is the best.  I did add to it though.  I added approx 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Also, used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup dark brown suger.  To help keep the top moist I drizzle a little milk on top and sprinkle with sugar.  My family loves it.

this isnt the best banana bread i've had (that's why 4 stars-i'd give it another half if possible), but it was still very good and i'd make it again. i replaced the sugar with 3/4 cup splenda and used 5 med. sized bananas.   cooked it for 50 minutes and it was perfectly done and really moist.  thanks for the recipe!

First time ever making any kind of bread. I looked at other recipes I thought this was really easy. I did the like some of the reviews said and added Vanilla ext and cinn. Also, I used a glass pan and put foil over the loaf after I took it out of the oven for about an hour. Came out nice and moist. Yummerz :)

Outstanding (with a few minor tweaks).  Changed out margarine for butter, used ½ cup brown & ½ cup white, and added ¼ tsp. vanilla. Bake time at 350 is about 50 minutes. It’s important to sift flour/baking powder & soda/salt together and fold into other combined ingredients.  I also sprinkled the top with a combination of brown and raw sugar for an extra sweet tweet that sparkles.

I modified: 3 over ripe bananas, 4oz of applesauce, 1 tsp salt, 2 eggs, cinnamon and vanilla to taste...and have now found the easiest/most delicious banana bread recipe ever. I like many others had made the "banana banana bread" recipe, and found it to be a little dense, but this was perfect for me! I like it just find without brown sugar, which i generally try to avoid anyway as i find it a pain to store, and i always buy a whole bag of it and end up only using it in one recipe, so having a brown-sugar-free recipe is awesome.

Fantastic recipe.  I made it into muffins and cooked them on the middle shelf for 18 minutes.  They would probably be better at 16 min.

I really liked this recipe. It wasn't as moist as I thought it would be but it was still a good recipe. I used 4 medium size bananas. I will make it again and try the substituting some of the white sugar with brown sugar as suggested and 1 more banana.  I did add a little cinnamon the first time I made it and I will add it again. I think the cinnamon added to the flavor nicely.

This recipe was great! My very picky fiance LOVED it.  I made the bread in a 12 muffin pan and it turned out great muffins although they fell apart a little trying to get them out of the pan. I tweaked it by following the other reviewers advice and adding 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon. Lovely!

This is a great recipe. I have been testing out several unsucessful recipes, when I came across this one. I used it because this was the only recipe that used one egg - and that was all I had on hand. I too used the 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white and added the vanilla essence and cinnamon. I baked for just over 60 mins, then let it sit 5 mins in a turned off oven, It came out tasting perfect, delicious. It did break up a little, but otherwise the texture and moisture content was just right.

I doubled the original recipe exactly to make a larger batch.  They turned out pretty bland even though I added plenty of cinnamon and nutmeg.  It was not as dense as I thought it should be, and not banana-y enough.  I would have used a lot more banana. I think I'll just stick to the recipe "Banana Banana Bread" from now on...

It tastes good, but since I didn't follow everything in order, I goofed and didn't add any baking powder. (I creamed first and then added the dry ingredients)...then again, the ingredients aren't in order of how they're added either, so it's not entirely my fault. I did add some dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves because I do like spice in banana bread. Otherwise, it's a fine recipe. I let my mixer "mash" the bananas when I added them, so it's kinda chunky banana (I used 3) & that's wonderful! My husband bought the bananas specifically for banana bread, and now he's out of town...I don't think he'll be back to have any!

DONT OVER LOOK THIS RECIPE!!    Even though none of the "victims" ate this first time bread recipe (because they had divine pumpkin bread {pumpkin pie bread from this site, also a first time experiment} ) I still gave it a five cuz when I got my hands on it....  YUM!  I was surprized that nobody even tasted it!  Seriously, with all the Thanksgiving food around, the loaves I made went through TWO family parties unharmed. They missed out big-time.  Two bad for them!!  We have been slicing it with no problem, toasting it and then butter.  GooD!  Gotta be hot!  Cook time was pretty off, about twenty minutes longer then equated, but who cares!

The only reason why this one didn't get 5 stars was that I thought it was a little too sweet for banana bread..Perhaps it was my over ripe and frozen bananas that added to the sweetness. Overall a good and easy recipe.

This was one of the best banana breads I have eaten. After reading some of the reviews, I made a few changes. I substituted 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1 1/4 c. mashed bananas for what the recipe called for. I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon & 1 tsp. vanilla. Everything else stayed the same. I didn't add walnuts because my grandchildren don't care for them. However, next time I will. That loaf will be for the adults. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Wonderful! I did alter the recipe though. I used 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, 2 eggs, 4 tablespoons of milk and 1 tablespoon of canola oil. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of maple syrup.

Awesome - loved this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipes states and it was great. I also substituted Splenda for the sugar and it was just as good.  Next I want to try substituting applesauce for some of the butter to reduce the fat.  Hope that works too!

My co-workers worship me each time I bring this into the office.  I usually omit the walnuts and instead add about 3/4 of a cup of flour-covered milk chocolate chips for an extra treat.

Texture wise it was very soft and moist - perfect!  But it could have done with a lot more bananas.  The banana taste was barely noticeable.  My family polished off the whole loaf and then was surprised when I asked them "so how was the banana bread?"!!

To make this a little healthier, I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose.  I also used 3/4 cup of pure maple syrup instead of sugar.  It was moist and very filling.

Excellent recipe, although I used some of the suggestions from other reviews.  Tends to turn out a little doughy in the middle, so be sure to cook long enough/test for doneness.

I made this tonight and followed some of other reviews: a little less sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla, and covered it with tin foil in the end. The bottom of the bread was a bit underdone, but that was my own darn fault for taking it out a touch too soon. Other than that, it has a great flavor! My boyfriend and I love it.

Turned out great. I had batter left and also made 8 muffins. I did not add nuts until the end. I sprinkled brown sugar and walnuts on the top before baking, and it was absolutely delicious.

Great recipe. Very moist.  As Always, I change a few things as I go along.  I used 1 1/2 cups of bananas instead of 1 cup and added a tsp. of vanilla.  I also left out the nuts because my son doesn't like them but added a whole bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The batter made so much that I made two loaf pans instead of one. I baked them for about 50 min. and checked them until the top just began top split. Don't over cook.  Moist and delicious.

This is a delicious recipe.  I was amazed at how moist and tasty it was.  Not dry at all.  I brought it to my office and everyone just loved it.  Thanks to the author for posting.  This is definitely a 'keeper' and it's going right into my recipe box!

Thank you!  I needed a banana bread recipes with out brown sugar, sort of lacking in the pantry.  I took some advice from another reviewer and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg plus 1 tsp vanilla.  It turned out heavy and moist with a slight kick from the cinnamon.  love it!

My favorite part of this website other than the recipes are the helpful reviews.  
The addition of the vanilla as some members suggested improves this loaf.  
This is a good banana bread.  One to hang onto.

Asolutely the best banana bread I have ever eaten! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and used butter but those were the only changes I made. The bread is moist,very flavorful and my husband loved it as much as I did.

This is a good recipe but not good enough to make again. I may need to tweak to my taste and texture. Still searching for a better one.

quite moist, though a dash of cinnamon or a teaspoon of vanilla might enhance the flavor more.  i used soymilk, and the addition of milk made it unbelievably moist!  these work great as muffins as well- yields about 12.

The ingredients are alittle out of order as far as putting it all together and wasnt thrilled about not having a time frame to cook the bread, but after about 75-80 minutes (as opposed to the other viewers recommended 50) this is thee best banana bread Ive tasted.

While the bread was tasty, I wasn't overly impressed with it.  It's a bit plain.  If it had been better, I probably would be inclined to go through the trouble of figuring out the correct temperature and baking time.

This turned out a little dry for the next day for me. I did sprinkle a little sugar on the top of the batter before baking. Gave it a more crispy taste. Very good all in all I think I will add more bananas next time.

I made this as a special treat for my students morning snack and they loved it! wonderfully simple recipe, easy to follow, travels well and well recommended. I made no changes to the recipe at all, thought the recipe was wonderful. The only thing lacking was a ball park time frame to bake it. **It took nearly 90 minutes.**

Was having visitors for tea and not having anything in the decided to try my hand at baking. Wow. This recipe is fool-proof! Followed MommyfromSeattle's tips and the result was amazing. The bread was moist and tasty...will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe and tips! 

** UPDATE ** I made a few changes to the recipe in an attempt to make it a bit healthier 1) 1/2 cup AP flour + 1/2 cup whole wheat 2) 1/4 cup applesauce + 1/4 cup butter to reduce the fat... I baked the banana bread as muffins instead for about 30 - 45mins...and they came out perfect!! Oh, and I forgot the milk but I don't think it made any difference.

Good banana bread-the crust had a delightful cruch to it and it was moist and tasted great.  My only complaint is that it just crumbled apart when trying to get a slice!  Guess I should have added an extra egg as others suggested.

Yum!  I only took this bread out of the oven about 20 minutes ago, so I'm sampling it while it's still extremely warm...and it is EXCELLENT!  I followed the advice of others and used 2 eggs as opposed to 1, 1 1/2 cups of mashed banana as opposed to 1, and then followed my own preference for whole wheat flour as opposed to all-purpose.  So far, so good...but I will have to amend this review once my husband provides his opinion...

We love this recipe! It's so good. We never have the nuts on hand to throw in, but it's good without and I think it'd probably be even better with them in. We've noticed there's more banana flavor if you don't let the bananas ripe too long.

This recipe makes a very moist, tasty loaf. I modified it buy adding powdered walnuts (1cp) to the flour and adding another 3/4cp of bananas, but this is a true can't miss that is easy to make.

This came out tasty, it just wasn't as moist I would have liked. It was more light and fluffy, and textured like yellow cake than the banana breads I've had were like, and I guess I'm just looking for that dense moistness that this recipe seems to lack. Great banana flavor and super simple recipe, though so it is easily worth four stars.

I used whole wheat flour (which may be the culprit) and followed some of the suggestions about milk, covering the finished bread with foil and using brown sugar instead of white. The flavor is spot on- delicious, but the cake is VERY thick and VERY heavy. I'm thankful I only used one egg. I would suggest adding a lot more milk (like 3/4 cup) and going half and half on the white and brown sugar. Also, next time I'll use oat or rice flour (at least partially) and we'll see if that loosens it up a bit.

I followed the advice of some of the commenters and added some cinnamon, vanilla, and substituted brown sugar for white. I also added an egg.

I also used bread flour instead of all purpose. I topped it off with powdered sugar, and voila!

It's still warm, so it's hard for me to taste its full flavor, but as it cools, it tastes better and better!

This banana bread was so easy to make and came out delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to put brown sugar and chopped walnuts on top.  I'll definitely make this again!  Thanks.

Very good banana bread. I doubled the recipe and was short on the bananas but the baked bread still came out moist and very tasty. I'll definitely be making this again.

This banana bread was amazing! I took others advice and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I brought it to my girlfriends to try and they all loved it! My one friend said "I usually hate banana bread, but this is great!"

i'm a new baker and i didn't know how this would turn out as I didn't know what creaming meant...I just mixed everything together plus subbed 1 cup of wheat flour and used 1/3 cup of sugar because it was all i had.  i added the vanilla and cinnamon that the other reviews said to add.  My husband thought it was what banana bread should be.

This is a great recipe but instead of milk I used buttermilk. It makes it a little creamier and more moist.

Best I've ever made! I even BOTCHED the whole thing (forgot ingredients, added them at the end... total mess), I also couldn't find my loaf pan so I used a muffing tin, I even overcooked them. I thought they were going to awful and dry... but they were WONDERFUL! EVEN though I messed them up. I will definetely make these again. Super moist!

Over all this is very good.I used 3 bananas,which yeilded about 1 1/4 cups. 4 would have been better. I took the advice of some other reviews and added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. I didn't use the milk because I ran out and didn't feel like going to the store. It turned out really well, not nearly as crumbly as others made it sound. I took "mommy from seattle"'s advice and covered it with foil while it cooled, and she's right, it really locked in the moisture! I will definately make this again, thanks for a great recipe and heplful tips!! :-}

I'm not obsessed with banana bread in general, but I could eat this all the time.  I made this for the bf's breakfast, and he said, "If I could have some of this every day I'd be in heaven."  Pretty good review!  I took some suggestions: 1/2 brown sugar; 1 tsp vanilla; 1 tsp cinnamon.  Didn't have any nutmeg, but would probably be a nice touch.  I made this Sunday night, and had some for breakfast this morning (Wednesday); still moist and delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

I took bits of other's advice to make this bread:  I forgot the brown sugar, but I did add  1.5 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla to the mix.  Then, I took another reviewer's advice in adding an oatmeal, flour, cinnamon crumble to the top.  Everyone loves this bread and it is incredibly moist still two days later.  I'll definitely make it again.

This is an easy recipe and its great when the craving hits for banana bread. Very quick. I made mine in a muffin pan. It made 12 perfect size muffins. Next time I'm going to use buttermilk instead of milk. I have had banana bread made with this before and it is excellent. I also used about a half teaspoon of vanilla. I used one cup of mashed bananas and I may incrase this as well. Overall very tasty and will make again!!

This was great!  My 3 year old son would have eaten the entire loaf in one sitting if I would have let him!  I added a tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla.  Perfect!

Fantastic! This might be the best banana bread I've ever made. I've tried several other banana bread recipes from this website and this is by far the tastiest. It has a lot of banana flavor and the texture is just moist enough without being gooey. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some cinnamon. In the future I'll probably add vanilla as well. I don't recommend cooking this any longer than 50 minutes.

This banana bread is great! Like another, I tried the banana banana bread recipe and it did not turn out like I hoped! This is just what I have been looking for. I added some extra flavor to make it my own. While making my second batch, I relized that I did not have enough butter. I substituted in applesause and it still turned out perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe makes a very cake-like, moist loaf of banana bread.  I usually use my mother's old recipe, but I was looking with something with more banana flavor and this definitely had that!  I made it without the nuts this time because they were the only ingredient I didn't have in the house, but next time I'll add those for sure.  I made a couple of loaves for my kids' teachers for Christmas and I had a hard time keeping my boys away from the teachers' loaves once they'd scarfed ours down!

Unbelievable!  Bakes very evenly and had a crunchy chewy outer shell with a super moist soft cake inside.  I added 1 T of yogurt to increase the moisture content...and the result: to die for!

Excellent recipe, I doubled it but only had one loaf pan ( in the middle of a move)  so filled a tray of muffin tins with the rest of the batter. Of course they didn't need to bake as long (25 min) but what a wicked recipe, some of the most simple things in life bring such sweet joy. Mmmmmmm yum.

This recipe is delicious. I also modified this to increase the protein (for weight lifting friends) I added to scoops of vanilla flavored soy protein and doubled the milk. In a head to head taste test a few people could taste the vanilla flavor in the protein bread (but liked it) and a couple commented that the regular recipe was more moist. I plan to decrease the flour by 1/2C next time to decrease the carbs and increase the moistness. This Banana Bread is wonderful in the original recipe and the protien enriched version.

This is the absolutely BEST recipe that you will ever find for banana bread. You can't do any better. I had this recipe printed out and the lost it until I did a search just now (I almost screamed). You can only make it better by using a bit of cream cheese icing. I JUST LOVE THIS!!! Thanks for submission.

I also used half brown, half white sugar plus 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and in addition I whirled a cup of coconut in the food processor and added that with the chopped nuts (I used pecans). Fabulous! Best banana bread I have ever made. Thanks!

This recipe is so easy and the bread comes out super moist! I've made this recipe several times now and I've added a few of my own twists. I've added cinnamon and vanilla like some of the others which turns out great, but I was lacking over ripened bananasthis time so I used plantains instead. The results were phenomenal!!

This recipe is quite good.  I followed others' suggestions and mixed brown and white sugar, 1/4 cup extra banana and a little cinnamon and vanilla always enhances a recipe in my opinion.  I added chocolate chips as its a prerequisite in my house.  As promised, it was moist with a very nice banana flavour.  My preferance is for a more dense banana bread though so the search does not end here.  Thanks it's still a keeper!

An okay banana bread. I followed the recipe as is and it came out a kind of dry. If you're going to use this recipe, definitely try adding more banana and perhaps a bit less flour.

I made this with my son and we served it at a family dinner, it was a huge hit!  Recommend using a small amount of icing, (I mixed icing sugar and milk to create a very thin glaze) to make it more of a dessert.

This is a terrific banana bread recipe! I followed the advice of others by substituting 1/3 cup of brown sugar for 1/3 cup of white, and it makes all the difference in the world. Everyone who's tasted this bread absolutely loves it.

The cake was very moist.  I added the vanilla extract and the brown sugar as other readers indicated.  However, next time I would add more sugar.

Loved this banana bread. My husband polished it off very quickly. I think I will replace my original banana bread recipe with this one. Perfect just the way the recipe is.

This bread was great! I used the suggestions and subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar in. I also used butter instead of margarine and added a little cinnamon and vanilla. I didn't have enough bananas, but next time I will put more than the 1 cup in. I made 2 loaves in 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 glass pans and baked them for 60 minutes at 350 and 10 at 325. They turned out perfect!!! My half brothers half brother stopped over and after trying the bread says I am ready for marriage. :)

The finished product is fabulous.  Extremely moist.  After one hour of baking @ 350 the middle was raw so I lowered the temp. to 300 and baked for another 30 min.  This was in a pyrex loaf pan so other pans may vary but I recommend keeping an eye on it after the first 60 min.  SO SO GOOD!

Absolutely wonderful recipe!  Best Banana Bread I've ever had!  Everything blended wonderfully and the flavors were very nicely balanced.  The texture was heaven!  Moist and light at the same time.  I made mine with Tillamook Butter (the only brand I use for special baking) and also added 1 tsp. pure vanill just because I'm a pure vanilla fan.  Just watch the bread to avoid over-baking.  This recipe is definately going into my file!

Delicious. I forgot the milk and it was still delicious and moist. It can only be better with cinnamon and vanilla as others suggested. This is my new and only banana bread recipe. Thanks Pat!

I have finally found the perfect banana bread recipe.  It was easy to make and was the perfect consisdency, not cakey but not mushy.  I did take some suggestion and added a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon and split the sugar 1/2 white and 1/2 brown.

My husband has a pet peeve about letting food, especially produce, spoil.  But I think he will purposely ignore two of three banana and let them get over-ripe, so that I will make this bread for him.  It makes a wonderful bread. And, its (relatively) low in fat - compared to other recipes that call for 4 eggs and 1 cup of butter.  Its heavenly toasted.

This was really, really yummy, but the final verdict was that it is more of a cake than a bread. All the same, it dissapeared in less than a day! I used more bananas (3, rather than 1 cup worth) and topped it off with some brown sugar and cinamon. Thanks for a great recipe.

I did the 1 cup margarine, 1/2 cup white & 1/2 cup brown sugars, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 1-1/4 cup bananas, 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 cups flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 5 Tbs milk, 1 tsp baking powder & 1/2 cup nuts.  I think this is better the longer it sits.  It's not the best we've ever had but it's good.  I think next time I will do the 1/2 cup margarine instead to save calories.

The bread was good. I am having a hard time trying to figure out how long it takes.  If I bake until the center is done then the rest of it is dry and brown.  If I bake it until it looks good on the outside the middle is all mushy and runnny.  Any suggestions?  Maybe trying to make muffins would help.  Next time I will try that and split the sugars up also.

We really like this recipe.  I make it at least once a month.  I've made some changes though.  I use:  1 cup butter, 1/2cup white 1/2cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 1/4cup bananas, 2 eggs and a little more salt.  I like to wait till the next day to eat it because it seems more moist and tastier somehow.

Well - everyone was right...this is simply wonderful banana bread.  It tasted like it was custom-made for me - everything from the density and moistness to the perfect banana-bread flavor.  I just finished my last slice and am thinking about running to the store for more bananas! (I followed the recipe exactly as written, but did add the vanilla and cinnamon some others mentioned as well as raisins...just because I like raisins)

This recipe was really good.  I did accidentally forget the milk and it still came out excellent.  I also changed it a bit.  I used 1/2 each brown and white sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  It took a little over an hour to cook, but was worth the wait.  Good recipe, Pat! Thanks!

This has to be the best banana bread I have ever tasted!  I was so tired of crumbly, flat banana breads that when I tried this one, I actually moaned with delight.  It is just the right consistency, wonderful flavor and the addition of the milk gives it a richness that other recipes don't have.  Thanks for sharing!!

I've been looking for and trying many banana bread recipes, this one is definitely staying in my favorites area.  I also added the vanilla and cinnamon and used brown and white sugars.  I made muffins and they were awesome.  My 5 year old said "I can't stop smelling it Momma!"

Best banana bread ever. Easy to make...my 3year old helped and best he loved it too! I made a few changes...1 cup organic whole wheat flour and 1 cup org. all purpose flour...also added 2 eggs instead of 1...Next time however will reduce the amount of b.soda to maybe 3/4 spoon. OOPS i forgot to add milk yet it could not have been more moist and yum...LOVED IT! CHEERS PAT!!!

This banana bread is good but mine got dark on top and still wasn't completely done in the middle.  I followed the directions exactly so I'm not sure why it didn't turn out.  I'll probably try the recipe again.

The texture of this banana bread is perfect.  I did half brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla.  I would like for it to be a little more buttery and sweet, so maybe I'll up those two ingredients next time.

This is by far the best banana bread I've had. I took the suggestions of adding some vanilla extract and substituting some of the white sugar with brown. The only trouble I had was getting the bread out of the pan. Could be because it was a glass loaf pan and I didn't let it cool enough before trying to get it out. Didn't matter though--the peices that broke off were quickly gobbled up. Something that tastes this good doesn't need any presentation! Loved it. Thanks Pat!

After years of trying more recipes than I can count, I have finally found a keeper!  Rises up beautifully with a crisp crust (which I love).  Color, texture, and flavor are wonderful.  I had to try a slice right out of the oven!  I can't wait to try it in the morning (if it lasts that long).  finally a recipe that doesn't have a burned bottom and an undone middle.  My search is over!  Can't wait to try it w/ cinnamon, vanilla a choc. chips.  YUM!

I just pulled it out of the oven and needed to give it a try right away - it smelled so good!  I added the cinnamon, vanilla, and substituted 1/3 c. brown sugar for the white.  It's really good straight out of the oven!!  I don't know if it will still be around to try it cooled!!  
Thanks for the great recipe and additions from everyone!

With the suggested cinnamon and vanilla extract, this bread is outstanding.
I've look for the perfect recipe for years, and this is it.
I had tried it with walnuts, almonds, pecans and macadamias, they are all good.
Thank you, Pat!!!.

A fabulous basic recipe for banana bread!  It was extremely moist, rose to a nice high loaf and tasted delicious.  I had no nuts (and I do love banana bread loaded with walnuts), but it was wonderful without them.  This recipe is a keeper!

Easy. I used 3 bananas, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I skipped the nuts and forgot the milk it still came out good.

Very good banana bread.  Came out moist with a crusty top.  Very enjoyable.  I am still looking for one that has a little more flavor.  I even added the vanilla and a little cinnamon.  Maybe I need to wait until my bananas are all brown?  I use them when the are about 1/2 brown.

I have used the same banana bread recipe for years. I didn't have all the ingredients for mine, so I looked for another just this once. I will never make mine again!!! This was the best. I added almost two cups of bananas and the vanilla and cinnamon. It made two small loaves and was excellent. Thank you

Rivals my mother-in-law's banana bread!!!  My husband couldn't keep his hands off it-ate it for breakfast, lunch and snacks. Wonderful taste though may increase the bananas by 1/3 or 1/2 cup next time.  Don't think it would hurt!  Texture perfectly dense and incredibly moist without being too wet.

Fantastic Banana Bread recipe!!  It was moist and light in texture.  I liked this better than the Banana Banana Bread recipe. The color is much better.  This recipe makes 5 mini loaf pans of bread.  I plan to take some into work tomorrow to share with my co-workers.

This is a great recipe!!  I too added vanilla,cinnamon & nutmeg. Also I used half white sugar & half brown sugar. It only took about an half an hour to bake. I did it in the toaster oven. Everyone loved it. I'm making it again this week. Thanks!!

YAY!! The best banana bread recipe, hands down!! It's extremely moist, even a couple days later (we kept it in plastic wrap). Easy to make, too! I think next time I'll add a little vanilla for a slightly different taste. Bravo, Pat!!
