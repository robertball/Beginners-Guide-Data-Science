This Lemon Jelly Filling turned out perfectly! I used 4 lemons and got a smidge less than 2/3 cup of juice. The filling thickened nicely while cooking and thickened even more while cooling. The flavor was fabulous and I will certainly use this recipe again!

My youngest daughter asked for a lemon,lemon and lemon cake(lemon cake, lemon filling, and lemon frosting) for her 10th birthday. She told me this was the best filling she had ever had! My husband and I liked it alot also.It does take awhile to make, but it is well worth the time.

I almost ruined this recipe. After placing the pan on the stove I soon realized that it should be cooked in a double boiler! OK. My lemons were large and I ended up with a total of 1 cup of lemon juice. Because of that, it did not thicken up like I thought it should. I wanted it thick so I could spread it on a cake so I added about a 1Tb of cornstarch stirred in with a little hot water to thicken it up. Still it wasn't quite as thick as I thought it should be. However it tasted great, just what I was looking for. This is how I used it. I made a "poke" cake where you pour lemon jello mix over the cake which has had holes poked in it. I then spread this lemon filling over the top of the cake. Then I topped it with Cool Whip. It tasted great, very lemony and tart like we wanted.  It would be nice to know how much lemon juice is needed since all lemons are not created equal in size! Once I know what the optimum amount of juice is the recipe will be perfect. 5 star rating for taste.

This was AWESOME!! I'm still waiting for the input of others, but I think it tastes amazing! It did take an hour and a half to thicken up, but when it did, it was really, really yummy :)

I AM NOT SURE THIS DESERVES ONE STAR.  THIS RECIPE NEVER DID THICKEN UP!!!!  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY, EFFORT.  YOUR 4 LEMONS WERE MAYBE A LOT SMALLER THAN MY LEMONS.  YOU REALLY NEED TO USE A CUP AMOUNT NOT JUST JUICE FROM 4 LEMONS.  I WOULD NOT TRY THIS AGAIN WITH OUT YOU STATING HOW MUCH JUICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I got a bit nervous after reading some other reviews so when mine had thickened quite enough after 45 mins, I added about 1 tsp cornstarch mixed with a few drops of water. Cooked another few minutes, then it was perfect! I used it as a filling in a lemon cake and it was soooooo good! Only 4 stars because I had to add cornstarch after 45 mins. Will definately use again and just add the starch after 20 mins.

I used Splenda instead of sugar. Melted butter separately before I added it. Added 1 tsp lemon extract. Got impatient at about 7 minutes and added 1 tsp cornstarch dissolved in 2 tbsp cold water. That thickened it right up.  Put into a clean bowl and placed into an icewater bath to cool. Sort of curdy looking but the taste is ab FAB! Sweet and tart, amazing! Plan to use on sugarless lemon cheesecake (Suzanne Somers recipe.)

Delicious recipe.  It did take over an hour to thicken, but be patient and DO NOT ADD THICKENING AGENT!  Also, unless you plan on making a ten layer cake, cut this recipe in half. I have generously filled my cake and I still have over 2 cups of filling left.  I used 3/4 cup lemon juice.

It was delish! I followed recipe exactly. The next time I make it I will make it the day before. It took quite a while for it to thicken up. I used it for a filling in some special cupcakes and everyone loved them.

Perfectly tart and sweet at the same time. Loved this lemon "jelly" which is actually a delicious version of an English lemon curd. I was going to make a cake and use this as a layered filling, but instead have been using this to mix into my plain greek yogurt. It thickened up nicely (see photo).  Thanks for the recipe!!
