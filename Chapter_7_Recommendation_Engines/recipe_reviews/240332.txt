My husband is super picky and compares a lot my dishes to his New Mexico favorites. He absolutely loved this dish! He almost never has a second helping of anything but he had two extra helpings of this! In fact, he stood in front of the baking dish and started eating from it. I will be making this again! The only thing I did differently was use flour tortillas instead of corn and hatch green chilies were in season so I used those.

This is an excellent recipe. I made these for New Year's Eve. The only differences were: I used chicken breast instead of the thighs, only because the meat was on sale; I used an entire 10oz. can of mild green chile enchilada sauce; I used 8" flour & corn tortillas- they had the corn taste, but were easy to roll ; after shredding the chicken I put the chicken back into the entire amount of liquid- the sauce did seem to thicken or reduce overtime, and wasn't "dry"--- I did use a fork to place the chicken mixture on the tortillas and it was more toward 3T of mixture; and I used mild chilies.  Everybody loved them! :-)

I used chicken breast out of personal preference but kept everything else the same. I really enjoyed the fact that these were baked instead of fried. The filling has tons of flavor but the end result is a little dry due to the fact that you can only put 2 tablespoons of it in each tortilla so that you still have room to roll. I also prefer the flavor of corn tortilla's over flour and I might try that next time even though I know corn will be a bit of a challenge to roll. If you love jalapeno poppers then this one is a must try!

Just tried this recipe and took it to a social gathering. It was a big hit and disappeared very quickly. Also gave out the recipe to others. I didn't change a thing. Very yummy.

Excellent!  I used 3 chicken breasts in place of the thighs.  Made 1/2 with corn tortillas and 1/2 with flour tortillas and we preferred the corn ones.  I sprayed them with cooking spray instead of brushing them with oil too.

Changes I made: cooked meat in broth with household seasonings in pressure cooker. Combined cooked meat, jalapeños, and cream cheese in saucepan until cream cheese melted. Rolled mixture and cheddar jack cheese  in flour tortilla to make enchiladas. Put a light layer of green sauce at bottom of pan, placed enchiladas on sauce, topped with lihgt layer of green sauce and cheddar jack cheese. Baked in oven and kids really enjoyed it!! Note: Jalapeños make it a little spicy, but my little ones LOVE spicy food.

Absolutely delicious!!!! I only used one large chicken breast, because there are only two of us. The rest of the recipe I kept the same, except for using one can of green chilies, and I also threw some jarred jalapenos in there as well. I also put some cheese on top when they baked. I will make this recipe all the time! PS: Even with only one breast, it made A LOT. I believe it was around 8 or so tortillas.

So quick and easy on a busy day. My boys loved it. I used half thighs and half breast turned out perfect.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe. It was very good. The second time I used green chiles instead of jalapeños because I want to serve it to guests with kids and I don't know if they like spicy food. I also added black beans, brown rice and corn. It is great this way as well. An interesting change to my normal enchiladas.

Made it just the way it called for in the recipe. It was very quick and easy. We had a lot of the meat mixture left over so added white rice to it the next night and it was awesome for left over night.

We really loved this recipe! I did go with chicken breast instead of the thighs only due to preference. The second time I tried it I went for an Italian twist.  I kept the canned peppers, but used a tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, oregano and an Italian blend of shredded cheese.  It turned out so yummy!

These are so good! I actually didn't use a slow cooker. I cut up 3 1/2 chicken breasts because that is what I had. I partially cooked it on its own with adobo seasoning. Added 1/4 cup of water, 1/4 cup jalapeño juice,  cream cheese and 1/3 cup of sour cream. I added extra jalapeños because we like it hot. I cooked covered stirring occasionally and shred the chicken with 2 forks before cooking another few minutes,  leaving the lid off so mixture would thicken. I only had 10 inch burrito tortillas but cut them and half and it worked well! I wrapped them the long way. Cooked @425 on bottom rack for 11 minutes and turned the broiler on and placed on the top rack for 3-4 minutes until brown and crispy!

These were great! I modified them a little bit - couldn't find canned jalapeno, so I used hatch chilies. Also used corn tortillas instead of flour. My husband wanted more! Definitely making these again! The chicken was a little bland without any extra spices, so I'll use fajita chicken or add more spices to the breasts next time.
