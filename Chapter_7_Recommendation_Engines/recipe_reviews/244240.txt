A staple to keep around for soup or those recipes that call for onion soup mix without using industrial chemically laced packets! I used celery seed without the addition of any salt and never even missed it. Thank you Lynn67 for your recipe.

This is really good!  I haven't bought onion soup mix in months. I did make a couple of minor changes to suit my family's taste. I used celery seed instead of celery salt and subbed 1 tsp turmeric and 1 tsp paprika for the 2 tsp turmeric.  I totally eliminated the salt, and add salt or beef or chicken base to the dish that I am preparing.  I love the fact that I control the saltiness of the dish. I have always found dishes containing onion soup mix to salty for my taste.

I never put the sugar in. I added 3 T. beef soup base (no preservatives, organic)  I think it was wonderful.  Yes, I will make it again.  It is quick and handy when you need something extra even to put in any dish.   And it doesn't have preservatives.

This is a great recipe for a larger amount of onion soup mix. I used this recipe often in the fall and winter months for everything from meatloaf, to pot roast, even soup.

This tasted nothing like classic onion soup. This was spicy and the turmeric had an overpowering flavor.
