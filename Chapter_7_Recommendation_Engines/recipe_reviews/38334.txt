Made this tonight for company and could not believe how good it is - everyone raved about it.  Would not change anything - this is definitely a keeper.

I'm sorry but as much as we like new things and love seafood at our house this recipe will not be added to our list of favorites. The amout of Amaretto liqueur was way too strong and too sweet. Sorry not again..

This recipe is WAY to sweet for me, and I can eat sugar out of the box!  I would suggest putting less liquid (less honey and less amaretto liquor), and finding something to balance the sugaryness.

This recipe is very tasty if you reduce the amount of honey and amaretto to about 1/4 cup. It gives it a nice sweet but not too overpowering taste.

This dish was a good pasta dish. Everyone I cooked it for liked it.

This is so sweet that it's really a dessert!  My husband is used to me trying new dishes and isn't picky. However he said, "This is the worst thing you've made in ten years!!  (He's normally very gracious and not quite so blunt, so I knew this was BAD!!!)  We salvaged the shrimp from it and threw the rest out.  The flavor was o.k. if this was a dessert, but as a seafood entree it turned our stomachs!!

Has a good taste, but too sweet.  Use much less honey and a little less amaretto.

The shrimp was delicious, but the pasta was not, and it was too sweet to eat as a main dish.

Solution - cut the amount of sauce in half, and leave out the pasta. Serve as an appetizer. Letting everyone have just a few bites of these shrimp is the perfect amount without going overboard on the sticky sweetness!

My husband LOVED this!  I personally thought it was a bit too sticky and sweet but overall liked the flavor!  He DEVOURED it.  Next time, more amaretto, less honey (we also didnt catch anything on fire, we just ate it the way it was)!

I cut the honey and Amaretto down to 1/4 cup each and added a 1/4 cup of butter and also used egg noodles, the family loved it and will be making this again.

Way too sweet for an entree,  the shrimp were delicious so we took them out and ate them with sweet chili dipping sauce.
