I never thought I'd ever give a recipe a bad rating, but this?  Awful, awful, awful.  I don't like ground turkey to begin with, but after reading this recipe, I was hopeful - hey, maybe this is a way I can eat it.  Negative!  The burgers STILL tasted like turkey - absolutely nothing on earth could get rid of that awful texture - I could have added a triple amount of the other ingredients and it wouldn't have helped.  If you like ground turkey, you'll probably enjoy this, but it does NOT taste like beef by any stretch of the imagination.  You have been warned!  *shuddering*

I make a similar recipe except I use the Lipton Beefy Onion Soup mix, add an egg, and mix in a few bread crumbs.  I George Foreman it, add a slice of cheese, and enjoy.

I am not a fan of turkey burgers but this was exceptional.  I made the recipe exactly as it and loved it!

I like these burgers better than beef!  Even my husband, who is a big beef eater, likes them.  Our 19 year old daughter, who eats very little meat, will eat these burgers.  I don't keep recipes unless they are 'two thumbs up' (too many good ones to bother with so/so) and this is a definite keeper.

These were very good- I would give it a 5 star rating but I did change the recipe based on other reviews. I halved the amount of onion soup mix and added some bread crumbs. Loved it!

This was an awesome recipe!! I used 3/4 of Lipton Beefy dry Onion soup mix and thats what gave it a great flavor! I also toasted on slice of wheat bread and used it for bread crumbs. I also used 3 tablespoons of A1 steak sauce. I toasted kaiser wheat rolls instead of regular hamburger buns (wheat rolls are healthier in general)  My boyfriend LOVED these turkey burgers and he's a pretty hard food critic. I will definately make these awesome turkey burgers again! A++ recipe!

I thought these were delicious. They were a bit salty so I will use half the onion soup packet next time as someone else suggested, which is what I should have done the first time.  Otherwise, I will definetly make these again because I'm always looking for lower calorie alternatives to my favorite foods and I thought these were great.

They really did taste like hamburgers.  After reading the reviews, I decided to use only 1/2 of a packet of Onion Soup mix and I added a couple tablespoons of bbq sauce.  This recipe is one of our favorites now!  Great Recipe!

I thought these were great.  I love turkey burgers anyway and I'm always looking for new ways to make them.  The only thing I did differently was I added a couple drops of liquid smoke and we grilled them.  They were fantastic!  I will make them again!

Tried this tonite and it was a great taste changer!  We cook turkey burgers all the time and hit and miss on flavor...but this was sure fire.  Used the idea of packet and instead used onion gravy packet, added some bread crumbs, and egg....and the coup de grace:  ground up beef boullion cube.  It leant just the right amount of beefiness without changing the flavor of the turkey burgers.  Try it sometime!  Thanks for the great recipe....we will be sure to use this again and again!

We like ground turkey and use it in everything and that is why we like this recipe.  However, if you are one to not like ground turkey, this recipe won't necessarily change your opinion.  I made some minor changes: 1.  1 TBS A1 Hot & Spicy 2.  1 TBS worchestchire (sp?) sauce 3.  I combined the ingredients and let it sit in the fridge for several hours before grilling  It was great and even my picky eater kids ate them!  YAY!

I'm on a quest to eat a little healthier since I've recently developed some health issues. I made these with ground turkey breast and followed directions. These in no way taste like beef nor did I really think they would but they just taste like an ordinary turkey burger, nothing special. On the other hand my family did enjoy them, especially my husband and he's the one that I thought would like them the least. I would make these again only if they requested them otherwise I'll stick to lean ground beef. In my opinion a burger isn't really a burger unless it's made with beef.

These burgers were delicious!  I added an egg, as per one of the reviews, and they were juicy and tasty.  The onion soup gives them great flavor.  This will definitely be my go-to turkey burger recipe.

These burgers were so-so. I usually like the taste of steak sauce and onion soup mix on their own, but mixed together they just weren't too great. I might try these again, but I'll omit the steak sauce and hope for better results.

I loved this recipe mainly because it was just a few ingredients and I had them all on hand.  These burgers tasted great (maybe not exactly like beef) but great nonetheless.

These were really good.  They kinda felt like they were missing something but I am not sure what.  I didn't deviate from the recipe what-so-ever except for I didn't cook them in a pan I just used my George Forman grill.  But I thought the burgers were delicious.

Doesn't taste remotely like beef unless you use the full fat ground turkey, and then you might as well use beef.  If you're trying to use the lf turkey breast, you're better off using ground garlic and onion powder instead of the onion soup.  This just kind of tasted like onion soup with ground turkey in it.

These didn't taste like beef, but it made a great alternative to the regular turkey burger.  My husband loved it, and he doesn't care for turkey burgers.  I definitely recommend this one, it was also quick and easy for a fast supper.

I loved these as a healthy alternative to hamburgers.  My husband wasn't as fond of them though,didn't like the crumbly texture and didn't like the onion soup mix in them, said it gave it a funny aftertaste.  By after eating two of them, he said they kind of grew on him.  I made them in my George Foreman grill which worked out great.  I'll make them again.

They taste very close to "real" burgers! And, equally important, they are extremely moist even when cooked to full doneness. I did them on the grill and they were excellent. Because Turkey is so lean 1/4 lb burgers seem to be the right size for nice, thick, juicy burgers.

I thought these were allright, but I definitely couldn't mistake them for beef burgers. I have also tried better flavoring as these were quite salty. For ease I just broiled them. It took about 12 minutes on high. As I thought they didn't have much flavor, I topped them with a small piece of pepper jack cheese and a little chili sauce at the end. It kind of reminded me a little of the onion soup mix meatloaf, or a little more like beef after those additions. Will stick to 2 other favorites for turkey burgers on the site.

Best Turkey Burger recipe I have tried, even my picky eaters that turn up their nose to anything ground turkey loves them.  First time we tried to cook the burgers on the grill they had some trouble with falling apart, the second try we added an egg to the recipe and it fixed the problem.  I would suggest some non-stick spray to the grill before cooking or they will stick.

I would give this 4.5 stars if it was an option :).  Great flavor, an easy "go to" burger, with ingredients you always have on hand.  I only put in half the soup packet and it was perfect.  Even my picky little eaters loved them--thanks!!

This recipe was great!  I only put 3/4 packet of onion soup mix though and i put 3 tablespoons of A1 steak sauce and it tasted sooo good.  I will definately make this again.

Turkey tastes like turkey, not beef.  Good rule of thumb for buying meat, "If you can't see it don't buy it."  This is especially true of the frozen tubes of turkey in my opinion.  At least go for the fresh ground type if your market has it.

These were delicious. We hardly had to use condiments! I added some bread crumbs (maybe 1/3 cup per pound of meat) since the turkey seemed much less firm than beef. Turned out very well!
Thanks for the recipe!

I think the name of this recipe may mislead people but it's a very good recipe.  I only used one package of soup mix to 2 lbs. of ground turkey because I didn't want it too salty or overflavored.  My family loves turkey burgers and these were a hit.
