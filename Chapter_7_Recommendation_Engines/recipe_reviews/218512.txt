I did add a little more to this. I added some sauteed finely chopped onion, celery and carrots and garlic. I also used the broth left over (after reserving my 2 cups) in my potaotes while they boiled. The only thing I think I will try next time is using a little less broth in the cream of chicken soup. I would like a little thicker gravy. This was pretty easy to make and I will surely make it again.  I like the easy crust batter. I think I will keep that recipe on hand for other meat pies!

Great recipe once we added vegetables too.  We added 2 carrots chopped, 2 sticks celery chopped, 2 garlic cloves finely chopped and 4 green onions chopped.  Mix these with the chicken and potatoes, then add crust and bake

Honestly, I'd give this 2 1/2 stars if I could. This is amazingly BLAND. I added onion, salt,  and garlic to the water while cooking the chicken and mistakenly thought the broth would add the needed flavor to the dish. I was so wrong. This recipe lacks any seasoning beyond salt in the water that cooks the potatoes. I added chopped baby carrots and frozen peas or more color and veggie flavor, but this recipe desperately needs some minced garlic and onion, salt and pepper at the very least. My crust took a full hour to have any color at all. At that point it was just a light brown.  The recipe has possibilities, but it needs help.

I loved this recipe because of the crust. The crust was very easy and the basic filling of the chicken pot pie was o.k. If you like flavor it is simple enough for you to add more seasoning to your filling. Again, the crust was great if your not looking for basic pot pie crust made from pie pastry crusts!

Not good at all as written, but I think maybe the author forgot to finish? The pic shows carrots, peas, etc, yet this things arenâ€™t included in the list of ingredients. I added corn, peas, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, poultry seasoning, salt, pepper, thyme ... without those it would have been terribly bland.

Quick and easy to prepare. Result is delicious. Followed the recipe exactly but added some carrots for volume and colour. Set to become a favourite.
