This is a really good recipe, but I would double the amount of sauce, as the chicken can be pretty bland without a generous portion.  The feta really gives it a kick!

This recipe was tasty but the dish could have been easier and faster if done with turkey cutlets instead of pounding the chicken.  I would probably marinate the meat then saute the meat naked next time..no flouring and frying, just a bit of olive oil in a non-stick pan to prevent sticking. When you add the meat let it sear without moving it.  When a thin crust forms underneath, loosen the meat from the pan with a spatula and let it brown.  Loosen medallions, turn them over and lightly brown the other side.  The juices on chicken should run clear not red to indicate it's done.  Thin medallions will not take long to cook through. The recipe would adapt to veal medallions or pork tenderloins in place of the chicken.  Don't use anything but fresh spinach and fresh tomato for best taste and appearance.  The lemon-feta cheese sauce is the secret to this dish, and it's easy.

Great recipie!  I had all ingredients on hand, so it was perfect for a busy weeknight meal.  Follwed recipie exactally.  Didn't pould the chicken with a mallet; rather sliced it into tenders.  Very good with couscous!  This one is a keeper.

This recipe is phenomenal if you like feta and spinach together!  I brought leftovers to work and everyone demanded the recipe just from the aroma of my lunch!  I used the recipe "as is" and it was perfect.

Excellent dish!  The flavor was amazing and I had a lot of leftover sauce.  I served it with white rice and it was great.  Great for young kids too.  I wanted to make sure the chicken was really well done and after the oil had burned off, the only modification I made was to put some white wine in the pan to let the chicken simmer in something longer.  Thanks for a great recipe!
