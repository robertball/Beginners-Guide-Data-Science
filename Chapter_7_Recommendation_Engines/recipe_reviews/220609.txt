I loved the sound of this recipe however try not to use sugar and canned items where possible, so I substituted an equivalent of 1 Tbsp of Stevia for the brown sugar, one finely diced ripe tomato for the canned tomatoes and 2 finely sliced green onions for the onion flakes and fresh cooked corn sliced from the cob. A bit more work but once it was all mixed, it was simply delicious!! Bravo on a nice, easy and tasty recipe!!

I didn't find this recipe that different from many other Mexican bean salads that I've had.  This one does have kidney beans instead of the traditional black beans, and the brown sugar tames the spiciness a bit, but it does still have a kick (and that's fine with me).  The Rotel that I had on hand was diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro, so that's what I used.  This is a nice basic bean salad recipe, and I liked it, but I wasn't WOW'd by it, not that that's a bad thing.

I always change every recipe I make, so I probably shouldn't rate, but I was able to get my family to eat it, so it must be good!  My kids and husband will not eat tomatoes, so  I completely left out the diced tomatoes with green chili. Because of this I added some chili powder.  I used balsamic instead of white vinegar and I doubled the vinegar and sugar.  Soooo, basically completely different, but totally worth making- easy, cheap, and I got the fam to eat beans! That's a big win.

Skipped the tomatoes, added chipotle and cilantro. Good way to enjoy kidney beans. I will make it again.

Did not like the tomato/green chili in this.  If I do something like this again in the future, I would leave that out and maybe add more onion, vinegar, and sugar or Splenda.

Instead of onion flakes try chopping a red onion and adding to the corn and beans.  Good!

with only beans and corn in the cabinets to work with  I thought to give this a try.   It was simple.  And pretty good.    All I used was a little more vinegar  and sugar.  I substituted the brown sugar for white, I didn't have  have any handy.  I made mines with white sugar, vinegar, garlic salt, and black pepper and it came out just fine.  Next time I will shop for the rest of the ingredients to give it a try as the recipe indicates.
