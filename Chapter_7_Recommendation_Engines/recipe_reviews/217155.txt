I was saddened to learn that due to gluten allergies I could no longer enjoy my favorite California Dip, which  everyone knows is just Lipton onion soup dip. There isn't another brand that comes close for superb onion dip. I'd rather pass than eat another. So I was skeptical, but decided to make this anyway, thinking it might be good enough. Well, it wasn't good enough. It was spot on, exactly the flavor of Lipton. Perfect as is, nothing to add or delete. I'm a very happy camper! I'm off to search for recipes that call for onion soup mix...

What could be more simple than this?  I added this to a can of beer with some garlic and crushed red pepper flakes.  I let a roast simmer until tender and sliced it thin for sandwiches.  I skip the bullion due to DH's sodium restrictions and truly don't notice its absence.  For dips I do add it and DH just has to be careful - this is good stuff!  :) Great recipe to have on hand so I made up several little bags for my pantry.

Be sure to use low-sodium bouillon granules. If you cannot find them, make the mix without bouillon granules and substitute low-sodium beef broth for any liquid in the recipe you are using.

Excellent!  Tastes just like Liptons Onion Soup Mix.  I prepare individual packages of the mix by placing the mix in snack-sized ziploc baggies.  And when a recipe calls for an envelope of onion soup I simply grab one of the zip loc bags.  And by the way, I reuse the baggies.  :)

I tried two different dry onion soup mix recipes (we are gluten free so we can no longer use Lipton's as it has added in barley); this one was far superior to the other we tried (which actually called for a small amount of white sugar...) and we prefer this to Lipton's; it has more flavor! We use 1/4 cup to equal one env. of Liptons. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

Fantastical! I used to use the boxed stuff to make burgers and roasted potatoes and tons of other stuff, but it has barley in it! Thanks for a gluten, preservative, and artificial flavoring free alternative that tastes just as good and is WAY cheaper!!

This recipe and the onion soup mix recipe (also from this site) are great substitutions for the store bought pre-packaged high sodium ones.  When possible, I will make my own seasoning mixes.  I am always looking for reduced sodium recipes that also have flavor for my family.

Love this!!!  We are a huge onion dip family and everyone Raves about this!  I only had minced onions not flakes. I made the mistake the first time putting in the amount. Was still good but over powering. Next time I cut it down to 2 teaspoons and it was perfect. I will never go back to the box again. Thank you

Very nice blend! I added dried chives for the heck of it and even though I didn't have any beef bouillon granules, the taste was really good! The dried onion I have seemed a little too large but worked just fine. If I make a bulk batch I would put the onion flakes, parsley and chives in a food processor and pulse a couple times so it doesn't separate when stored.

All I can say is WOW!  If you like the name-brand onion soup mix out there, you are going to LOVE this recipe!  I wouldn't even buy generic because I was picky and wanted the name-brand stuff.  I decided to try this recipe because I'm tired of buying all of these mixes when I know I can make them better at home... which is this recipe!  I used it for onion-roasted potatoes that usually calls for the packet of onion soup mix and not only did it taste so similar to what I was used to, it was actually even better!  Because I'm not always a fan of the cooked dried onions, I ground this up in my coffee grinder so it was all a fine powder.  I may do it this way from now on, it mixed a lot more evenly and the taste is outstanding.  Thanks for a great recipe...I will never buy the name-brand mix again!

I've been making this for a couple years.  It's so much better and cheaper than the Lipton stuff.  1oz = 1 envelope of Lipton.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Our need for a gluten free diet means a lot of meal 'helpers' like store bought dry onion soup mix can't be used.  This recipe is a great replacement for the blue box store brand.  I've made up a bulk batch and use it frequently!  Thanks faye522! you've helped add back some of our favorite comfort foods to our menu!

This makes one more thing easier in my life.  I know onion soup mix is supposed to have dried onions,but seeing as how I don't like onions I sift them out.  Now I need a recipe for mushroom soup so I don't have to strain out those pieces of rubber in it any more.

I came looking for a make your own dry mix to add to sour cream for chip dip, as I did not have any store bought dry soup mix on hand. I am so pleased I did. I wanted to use what I had on hand and this is what I did. I used enough regular beef bouillon cubes (I smashed them into granular) to equal 1 Tablespoon, then I added two envelopes of "No Sodium" granular beef bouillon. It equaled 1 Tablespoon. I was so very pleased with the outcome. I may never purchased premade onion soup mix again! I can control the sodium content!!!

Very easy recipe!!! And super flavorful too, just what I needed to add to a recipe when I realized I was out & now I'll make my own since I keep everything on hand all the time, except for today LOL. I might add, that I didn't have the granules needed for the recipe, so I took a few cubes(probably about 7 or 8) and placed them in my personal blender(Magic Bullet) or use a coffee grinder...pulervize the tar out of them to get it to...well ground texture, I went fine texture on mine. And measure accordingly to the amount needed for your recipe. It was rather quick and simple. And this is a no fuss recipe. TY

I didn't make any changes.  It was great and will definitely make again.  I used it in my crockpot for pork steaks with mushroom soup, white wine and wooster sauce.  Wonderful flavour.  Thanks for the recipe.

I had everything on hand for my recipe except for onion soup mix.  I used your version and it came out great! What I liked especially was that I could substitute sodium free beef bouillon.  The store bought onion soup packets have more sodium than we should be eating in a week! Thanks for this great and less expensive alternative.

i thought it would be a good way to use up the herbs I had in my cabinet, but really not worth the effort. I enjoy the convenience, and reliabilty of the standard lipton onion soup mix.

I was at my daughter's house keeping the grandchildren. She left instructions to make a roast with carrots and potatoes. I searched her pantry but couldn't find any Lipton Onion Soup Mix. Allrecipes to the rescue and, particularly, this recipe! The roast turned out great. I may never buy dry onion soup mix again when it can be made so easily!

Wow, how to cut the cost of a meal effortlessly!  This mix seems to add the same flavor to cooked foods and it costs a fraction of the store mix. I sent this to all my kids. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe saved my bacon, er should I say meatloaf, when I discovered that the onion soup mix I thought was in the cupboard was gone.  I think I may stop buying the store version and just keep this homemade recipe close at hand.  Thanks!

I live in Germany and the onion soup mix here is not the same. I use this dry mix for pot roast. It's a perfect dupe. I omit the onion flakes since I use so many onions for my roast. And also it's hard to find low sodium anything here. So I use normal beef bouillon powder. Sometimes I play with the ratios of parsley and paprika...but the recipe is great as is.

Sent my husband to the store for Lipton Onion soup mix to add to my Pot Roast, he came home with Cup o Noodle!  Found this recipe and made it myself, it's a really good match and less sodium, very happy!

I grew up using Lipton's to season everything. Since my Celiac's diagnosis, everything tastes wrong-- until now.I would hug you if I could. This is that good.

What's not to love about this recipe? It's as good if not better than the pre-packaged stuff and you know exactly what you're putting into your and your families bodies. I've used this a few times in a couple different recipes with great results.

Thank you!  This was just what I needed for a vegetarian meatloaf recipe.
To suit the recipe, I subbed 1 T. vegetarian Better Than Bouillon for the beef variety specified and celery salt for seed because it was what I had on hand.

This recipe is really good. Such basic ingredients. I had everything on hand. Much less expensive to make on your own and no added preservatives. I did add a little garlic salt, which I love! Used it in the "Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast" recipe from this site, which I highly recommend.

Perfect! I was looking for a DIY version since I recently had to go gluten free and both the Lipton and store brand mixes contained gluten. I love making onion dip with this mix and Greek yogurt.

This is my go to when I'm making a French onion dip, or recipes that call for it. I usually increase garlic and onion in everything, or add it if it wasn't called for, this was no exception. I've been using this recipe for years, subbing chicken bouillon for beef, since thats the only one I can find around here without MSG. I never use it in roasts, as most seem to, but I have my own reliable go to for doing roasts that doesn't require any measuring. :) And it uses similar ingredients.

This makes the very best onion dip. Everything is easy to have on hand.  The packaged soup dip leaves me feeling unwell but this tastes better anyway. I use a scant Tbsp of beef flavored "Better than Bouillon" .

This is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME 
It worked so wonderfully.  I am thrilled to have a recipe with no MSG and preservatives!!!  Dry Onion Soup mix is such a "go to".  I even had to use Beef Stock when I didn't have any dry bouillion or dry stock base.  It worked wonderfully in that particular recipe.

Cant get any easier! Great recipe and I used no sodium beef boullion packets! So I was very happy about reducing all of that sodium that is usually in those Lipton packets. Used in a soup recipe that I found on Pinterest.....very good. Thanks!

I used this recipe at Thanksgiving. I thought I had purchased the soup mix for dip but am so glad I didn't now! This will be my go to for French Onion Dip. I love that I can get all the flavor I want without all the unwanted, unneeded salt. It is also nice because I usually have all the ingredients on hand so it can be a last minute option if I want. Thanks so much. The whole family enjoyed your recipe.

I used Epicure toasted onion and Epicure Beef Broth (dry). I left out the onion powder. Used it in a chicken recipe that called for dry onion soup mix. I’m crossing that product off my grocery list. This is MUCH better!

As many other reviewers, Lipton soup mix used to be a staple but because I have an allergy to MSG, which is in Lipton's soup mix and the ranch packets, I had to find 'make-your-own' options. This is an ideal substitute. I also didn't have beef boullion but didn't need it for the recipe I had. However for french onion soup and others that need salt, make sure to add it. I couldn't find beef granules and just chopped up a cube of beef boullion. Worked fine. Definitely a keeper!

I had to leave out the celery seed as I had none nor any celery but this worked perfect for a beef stew recipe calling for a dry onion soup mix. Thank you. Will use over and over

Love that it is so low in sodium, great for gluten-free, and can easily be made vegan by subbing vegetable bullion for beef!  I'm going to experiment with adding beans, etc. so I use this as the base for a dried soup mix to give as gifts next Christmas.

I love being able to make up my own dry mixes, I like keeping a lot of vinegar, spices, oils and such, then I don't have to worry about buying this or that  packaged mix that usually isn't enough anyway!
Thank you for this recipe.

I too will never again buy store bought packages, this is better!
I always make our slow cooker pot roast with the soup mix and I was out of the packages. Allrecipes to the rescue once again. I now make a better dry taco mix and dry Italian salad dressing mix all from this site as well. Thank you Faye for sharing this great recipe to add to my dry mix collection..

I can’t tell you how much money this is saving me! I use onion soup mix in my hamburgers, on crockpot roasts, I use it in many recipes. This is spot on. I won’t change a thing. It’s easy and quick. Thank You so much!!!!

Made really good roasted onion potatoes! I didn’t have bouillon granules on hand, so I used a mallet to smash 4 cubes and it worked fine. It was a bit on the salty side, so I might try the celery seed someone suggested in lieu of the celery salt next time. Overall better than the packets you buy.

I substituted for a couple of items on the list that I didn't have and it still came out great. I've never made my own onion soup mix, but I like that it can be adjusted to fit my taste. This is a great starting point though.

Did not have beef bouillon, celery seed,  or paprika so had to substitute with smoky Montreal steak seasoning...and it still turned out fabulous! I can only imagine how much better it will be with all the listed ingredients... ;)

Wow! Great combo! Love the tanginess. I didn’t have onion powder, so I used garlic powder. Substituted chicken bouillon cubes for beef. Will be using this mix for all kinds of things! Potatoes, chicken, fish, meat. Really versatile mix!

All ingredients were in my pantry with the exception of beef bouillon crystals.  I was cooking a beef roast with a mushroom and onion soup sauce so it was simple to add liquid beef bouillon to the can of mushroom soup to replace the crystals.  The flavor was great and without the added salt from the dry onion soup mix.  I would definitely use this again.

I made it, because I needed something without Cornstarch, because of allergies. It made a chip and dip, just like the Lipton's Onion Soup mix! Tastes great!

Trying to reduced processed foods in our diet so I made this to replace a staple. I was a little worried about the amount of salt in the bouillon but was pleasantly surprised to find this turned out great. Used it on a piece of beef tenderloin in the crockpot and it turned out great!  Goodbye Lipton!  It has become a staple in our spice cabinet.

Being gluten free means we can't buy those little packets of goodness. I must say this mix was excellent in the recipe I needed it for: Rempel Family Meatloaf. My only sub in this recipe was the bouillon because I didn't have any on hand. It likely could be omitted, but I chose to use Vegan and Gluten-Free Broth Powder. Can't wait to use this Dry Onion Mix in other recipes! Thank you for the recipe, Faye!

I am giving this a good rating, because the only problem I had with it was my own personal issue.  I am posting for those who, like me, cannot have processed soup mix because they contain glutamate (MSG, MAG, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, etc.) and cause migraines and other health problems in people who are sensitive to it.  This recipe calls for dried bouillon granules. I was unable to find such a thing without glutamate in any store.

Very good, great substitute and without the insane amount of sodium in Lipton soup mix.  Exactly what I wanted and super tasty.  Will make this again for sure.

Great recipe! I used this for salisbury steak and a pot roast. It worked beautifully and is such a better alternative to buying the packets. Hubby said it was the best pot roast he ever ate.

Wow! Just perfect! I've been trying to stay away from Liptons opinion soup mix because the sodium is astronomical and it has things in it I really don't care to eat. I am thrilled how this recipe tasted and I actually had to add salt to my meal. Great authentic flavor and I will be using this from now on. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I always do roast in the crockpot with onion soup mix, cream of mushroom soup and some red wine.  Late one Sunday evening (I was cooking it overnight for a pot luck the next day.) I realized I was out of the onion soup mix.  I looked up this recipe, added the ingredients with the soup and wine, and it was the best ever!

Super easy, took only 2 minutes to throw together. Smelled just like Lipton soup mix, dinner tasted the same as when I use the Lipton--and saved me a 20-mile roundtrip to the store with 2 toddlers for this one item!

really good.  I saw one reviewer said she added a beer and some hot pepper flakes.  I opted to do the same , and was not disappointed.  Probably the best gravy I've made ;)

mixed it in sour cream and it needed salt, but the saltiness of the chips I was dipping made up for it.

It was a wake up call to try and look for low sodium beef flavoring, I thought I was going to be cutting down on the salt content by making my own mix, but my store had several types of beef base, beef bullion, etc.. and all of it had salt as the first ingredient. Still looking, but very happy to have a recipe when I find it.

Use caramelized onions instead of dry onion flakes.

I had lots of onions that needed to be used so I caramelized 2 medium onions (per directions on Allrecipes) and eliminated the dry onion flakes and onion powder.  It is the best dip mix ever and the family agrees.

This was PERFECT!! A lifesaver!  I was making No-Peek Beef Tips for company today and discovered that I was out of onion soup mix, which I usually have on hand.  I found this recipe and made it exactly as written, except that my beef bouillon was not low sodium, as called for in the recipe.  I was holding my breath, hoping the finished dish wouldn't be too salty.  It wasn't too salty at all.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for coming to my rescue!

This is very close to store bought onion soup mix but it is more potent.  We use less as it can get very salty so in this case less is more.

I needed to make a dip so I used this recipe and substituted celery seed for celery salt and instead of dried minced onion I caramelized one onion. I mixed it all with vegan sour cream (my husband's allergic to milk) and it came out fantastic! It's the first onion dip he's ever had and he loved it! Thanks!

Had no issues with this recipe! Fast & easy! I've used it with chicken, beef, & pork--all were tender and juicy. The sauce cooks on the grill as well so it can be used on the cooked meat.
