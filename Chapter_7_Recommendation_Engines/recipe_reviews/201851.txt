I love bourbon steaks that this marinade made for very tasty ones.  Only thing I would change is that I would like a little sweeter flavor and will add more brown sugar next time and maybe make extra marinade so that I can baste the steaks while they cook.

Excellent marinade!  I used strip steaks and added Jim Beam to the marinade.  These steaks were delicious and flavorful.  I did add a tablespoon of minced garlic, thanks Sassy, and did cut the recipe by 1/2 since we were just marinating 2 steaks.  This is definitely enough marinade for six large steaks.  Thanks for a great recipe, Nokomo, enjoyed trying this!

It was a flavorful marinade and if you enjoy bourbon whiskey you will love the flavors.  I would use more sugar next time as I like mine more on the sweeter side.

We enjoyed this. All I had was Southern Comfort and it turned out great.  I also only had 5 hours and we could still taste it in every bite. I am giving this a 5 because if it were to sit 8 hours as directed, it would have melted in our mouths. I cannot wait to try this again when I have the time to let it sit properly. Thanks for the great recipe!

VERY good marinade, for any of your steaks. Hint: take the steaks out of the frig to come to room temp (about 30 minutes) before you cook them.

I made this for *Recipe Group*. I thought the bourbon came through too strong on this for me, not overpowering, just more than I like. It needs something, maybe some garlic. I normally don't marinate or rub ribeyes as I like the flavor of the meat to come through. If you like the bourbon flavor, you will love this. Thanks Nokomo for the recipe.

This is a great way to give steaks extra flavor.  the only change I made was to add some chopped shallot and to reduce the amount of brown sugar to 2 tablespoons. I also marinated some chicken thighs along with the steaks, and they came out super delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly even had Rib-Eye Steaks on hand.  I marinated for just 8 hours and there was not as much flavored as I hoped there would be.  They smelled wonderful on the grill, but only a few bites of my steak were full of flavor.  I think I will make this again, but next time definatly try a 24 hour marinate; I might also try it will chicken breasts.

Sorry, but a waste of time & ingredients. No amount of time marinating will infuse the whiskey flavor into the steak. And yes, I have tried this method before I discovered the correct way to flavor my steaks. Buy a new spray bottle. Fill with 1/3 Worcestershire sauce, 1/3 whiskey or bourbon, 1/3 water, and a cap full of 'Liquid Smoke'. Shake to mix well. Key to BBQ'ing is too leave your steaks lay out to reach room temperature. Salt & pepper steaks. Place steaks on a HOT grill and intermittently spray mist the steaks with your mixture, even spraying the flames to create a smoke. Flip steaks ONLY once! Remove when desired temperature is met, and let steaks sit for 5 minutes before serving to let the juices settle. FYI, the Grand Champion of BBQ Pit Masters uses this mixture but includes 'Jack Daniels Whiskey'! Enjoy!

I had thin cut rib eyes and ended up with them in the marinade for a little over 24 hours.  I'm not a bourbon fan but I think the marinade imparted excellent taste to the meat.  Topped with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce (also from this site) and the steaks were positively orgasmic!  Thanks!

I've cooked this recipe several times and every time the steaks are excellent. The taste of the marinade is a good blend for rib-eyes. The only slight difference in my preperation is I typically get two 10 oz  steaks and use the ingredient amounts as listed in a large plastic container to complete submerse the steaks overnight. This could be slightly less liquid but even when I've done a bunch for a party I do two steaks per bin completely submerged. Sear them on the hottest part of the grill with a cross pattern and the move to the cooler rack to finish and these will melt when you cut in to them.

I don't think I marinaded long enough.  Only marinaded 5 hours and I didn't notice the flavor of the marinade while eating.  My hubby liked it, but I didn't find it very flavorful.  =(  This could (probably was) my timing error.

The restaurant Eddie Merlots has bourbon marinaded ribeye on the menu.  I tried it once and had to try making it at home.  The steaks came out great. I made the changes below.

I added garlic to the marinade. After removing the steaks from the marinade I reduced it by about 2/3 then added 2 tablespoons of butter with 1 tablespoon of flour.  It made a delicious sauce.

Steaks turned out pretty good from this recipe. I will not, however, pack the brown sugar as the taste was a bit too sweet, for me. But definitely a keeper!!

Incredible marinade.  Made this as exactly as written.  I suppose depending on how much you like bourbon you could use a little less, but I found it to be just the right amount.

VERY GOOD RECIPIE. A BIG HIT WITH FAMILY        I USED JACK DANIELS SOUR MASH WHISKEY IN PLACE OF BOURBON. SOFTENS THE WHISKEY TASTE AND MELLOWS MARINADE.   I WILL TRY LOW SALT SOY SAUCE NEXT TIME AND  MARINADE THE STEAKS FOR 24 HRS.

I made the recipe as stated.  It came out well.  I think this might be better for a colder time of year because the marinade seemed heavy for the summer.  I think it had a good balance of sweetness and flavor from the other ingredients.  I will make this again.

This is one steak marinade to remember. The timing on searing and cooking the steak is perfect for me. Speaking of which, each bite you take is like sipping a sweet glass of bourbon whiskey on the rocks (minus the rocks). Whoever came up with recipe first, props due!!

For good cuts of steak, a marinade is truly unnecessary and often times wasteful.  However, I have used this recipe and multiple variations for cuts like skirt steak, sirloin, hangar steaks, etc.  I would not use any marinade for better cuts from a quality store.  But, the big stores like Jewel rarely have good cuts or quality beef, so a marinade is smart.  Adjust the marinade to your taste, I usually add a little dried garlic in the marinade.  Also, salt and pepper the steaks before placing in the marinade.  Lastly, regardless of marinade, pull it out of the fridge and let it come to room temp before cooking and don't be shy pouring some of the marinade on top of the steak when you first place it on the grill and no need to shake off what is on the steak, it will burn off or caramelize a bit.  I also turn the steaks to get cross marks and for something under 2 inches I would never move away from high heat.  lastly, cover the meat and let it rest at least 5 minutes before eating, the juice will run providing flavoring from both the steak and the marinade...

I would never think of ruining a great ribeye steak with any kind of marinade.  Just let it set to room temperature, season well with SPG and rub with a little olive oil, grill to medium rare, and VOILA!!   Then . . . when your meal is done, NOW is the time to enjoy sippin' on some bourbon -- NEAT, of course!
5 stars . . . just 'cuz!

I used the inside grill but it was tasty.  I only marinaded for 4 or 5 hours.  Next time I will marinade all night, needs a little more flavor for me.

I marinated my steaks for about 10 hours.  I will cut the brown sugar back to 1 tbs in the future because it was a bit too sweet for me, but the flavor of the bourbon came through subtly and overall we liked it.  We used an electric grill so flare up wasn't a problem but I expect it might be over a flame.

Next time I would use less bourbon and don't over-marinate because the alcohol over takes the steak. I also added garlic which other suggested and that helped the flavor

I made this for the Recipe Exchange group recipe for the week of April 26th. We liked this a lot. However the marinade didn't penetrate very deeply into my steak. (I used flat iron, because it's my favorite, generally.) I think next time I would add another tablespoon each of lemon juice AND brown sugar (lemon juice to add more tenderizing power, and sugar to offset the lemon flavor.) I did add black pepper quite liberally to the marinade as we love it. Thanks for the recipe! (I served this with AR's "Honey Roasted Red Potatoes" and a salad. The slightly sweet steak and the sweet oniony potatoes went very well together!)

My family loves steak so I thought this would be something different... I wish I could have my 20 bucks back that I spent on the rib eyes because myself nor my husband or sons could eat it..  I have used bourbon in other recipes.... but this just wasn't good... we ate cheerios for dinner

Great flavor. I made a couple changes. Used Appleton Dark Rum we had from one of our trips to the Caribbean. Also used Splenda brown sugar. And used a low sodium soy sauce.

Loved this marinade!  I used four roses small batch bourbon which is a bit on the sweet side.  I was worried it would either have no bourbon flavor or be over powering but it was neither!  Very well balanced with just a hint of bourbon flavor.

The steak was still a bit blue when cooked by the time on the recipe.  I like a rare steak but this was excessively rare.

I loved how these turned out.  Based on the reviews, I marinated them overnight.  The flavor was perfect.  I wouldn’t do any less then 24hrs or there  won’t be enough flavor throughout the steak.  We grilled 4 min on each side turning only once. Then let sit for 5 minutes before cutting. A perfect Medium rare. And so tender. This recipe is a keeper.  I may try it on chicken as well!

Not as much flavor as I expected after marinating for more than 8 hours.  I think it was a total waste of good booze.  I guess I prefer my bourbon with club soda and a twist of lime.

The marinade does not enhance the taste of the steak. A plain grilled steak taste better.  I won't use the marinade again, not even on chicken.

It was easy and the flavor was excellent.  I marinated it for almost 24 hours (just because that's how things worked out for me) and given the way it turned out I would suggest marinating it for a longer rather than a shorter period of time.  I will definitely do it again.

OK, I thought I could improve on it.   Just do it the way it's written!  I added brown sugar (see recipe above this one!) and thought---hey!  I'll just add THAT too!  Then---it says to drain and pat dry before cooking.  YEP.  JUST DO IT.   I grilled it on a flat-iron grill on my BBQ without doing that, and the bourbon was still very strong.  If cooking over charcoal, it would have burned off, and carmelized, which WOULD have been FANTASTIC.  SO....moral of the story---drain and pat dry if cooking on a flat grill!  BUT if you're over charcoal---GO FOR IT!!!!  Just make sure the alcohol burns off, so you don't have too much of a "good thing" in the final taste!

I rarely write reviews but had to for these steaks. They are amazing!!! I've made them three times now, served them to guests, and everybody has loved them! To those reviewers who gave it a low rating, you need to get new tastebuds!!! This recipe is definitely a "keeper"!!!

I've been searching for many years for a bourbon based process for steaks.  I think that this is the one.  

We made it according to the recipe with the exception of adding 2 cloves of fresh garlic, which a lot of other reviewers suggested.   Definitely a great touch.  I would definitely recommend that the steaks be marinated at least 8 hours.  Ours were in the marinade for 20 and they were perfect.      

We also took the suggestion of one reviewer and made a sauce by reducing the left over marinade by 2/3 and adding butter (2T) and corn starch (1T).    We took the steaks out to bring them closer to room temperature and started the reduction at the same time.  From our experience, this will result in the sauce being done just about the time the steaks come off the grill. YMMV.  Figure about 40 minutes to an hour.  

Let's start with the steak without the sauce.  They were tender and flavorful, and very much what I was looking for in a marinade.  Everyone was happy at that point.  Then we introduced the sauce.   

As a family we are not big on sauces on steaks, this has changed everyone's mind.  The sauce raised the experience to a new level.   

This has become the way we do steak as long as we have the time.

I made this recipe exactly the way it was written  and I have mixed feelings about it. First of all my steak was very moist and tender I put the marinade on the night before , and left it marinating until dinner time. I am not a fan of sweet steak , and I found that this was quite sweet. I will try this recipe one more time but leave the sugar out and then update my review. So the jury is out on this recipe.

I made this recipe, but substituted JD for bourbon.  The steaks I used were a very thick cut, and absorbed a ton of the whiskey.  I don't think the alcohol completely evaporated, it was a very heavy, slightly alcohol-infused steak.  It might turn out better with a thinner cut, but don't expect to make this recipe again.

Due to the unavailability of bourbon whiskey, I used black rum of the same quantity,  everything else was as per the recipe, I personally felt that I have had better steak meals, but it sold well in my restaurant, I also changed the name to "Pirates Steak",  that had some patrons expecting a fish meal.

I used beef stock instead of water. (I don't understand the many uses of water in many of the recipes on this site). The meat was not as tender as I would have expected after marinating for 8 hours and the flavor was only so-so. I had to cook in a skillet due to the weather. I would add some more ingredients to bump up the flavor when making this again.

I didn't have bourbon so I looked up a substitute.  Vanilla extract and almond extract.   Equal parts of each.    I only had thin shoulder steaks on hand and only an hour to marinade.   Pan fried in a hot cast iron pan with butter.   Delicious.   Next time will try the rib steaks or any beef would be good with this marinade.   Thank you.

Very good. No changes . Marinated for 12 hours and used on NY strip steak. I'm not one to marinate a good quality steak as the beef is flavorful enough but this was a nice change. Would use again . Thank you

I had one 16oz sirloin and cut the recipe in half.   I used Honey Bourbon - because this is sweet I  then cut the brown sugar in half (again).   I added 1/2 tsp liquid smoke (would be 1 tsp if using full recipe) and 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper (would be 1/2 tsp if using full recipe.  It was delicious.

Great recipe! It turned out amazing! Followed some of the other reviews and added a little more brown sugar and a fresh garlic clove. Marinated NY Strips for nearly 20 hours. Cooked on gas grill outside. Will try chicken next.

I opt not to marinade it, in favor of thickening the glaze in the pan. I only followed the ingredients and not the amounts in the recipe, and added fresh minced ginger which really took it up a notch. I would recommend it, and will definitely make it again (but use something cheaper than Woodford next time).

I love this marinade, haven't let it marinate 8 hours yet and it tastes awesome, I use 1/2 cup of whiskey instead of 2/3 because it makes it less whiskey central.

Marinade overnight; makes all the difference between only a few hours.  I also added some liquid smoke to the marinade to add some smoke flavor; gives a new element to the dish.  Since there is soy sauce involved, I wouldn't add any salt to it unless you need sodium in your life.  Works for any kind of protein other than steaks.  I've also used this for salmon, chicken, pork, etc.

Excellent recipe. Made double the marinade. Divided it in half and marinated the steak in half and made basting/dipping sauce out of the rest. Let the steaks come out of the fridge for 30 minutes. dried them thoroughly then popped them on the grill with some veggies. Blasted the radio with a cold drink in hand and had a little steak/grill party. Doesn't really get any better than this.

Made it as stated and marinated T-bones for about 18 hours.  The steaks had a very nice mellow flavor and were very tender.  Next time I will add a little garlic and crushed pepper.

I only marinaded my rib eyes for 4 hours and it had great flavor.  I also used low sodium soy sauce.  I can't wait to make it again and let it sit for the 24 hours.

There's absolutely no spice to it.  It was ok, but definitely not a bourbon street steak.  I thought it was ok, my husband took one bite and couldn't eat any more.
