This pound cake recipe is a classic and because of that, it's common.  It's the standard, really, for pound cakes - 3 c. each sugar and flour, a cup of butter, 6 eggs, 1/4 tsp. each of baking soda and salt, 8 ozs. of sour cream or cream cheese and flavoring, usually vanilla. Make enough of them and you’ll have this recipe down pat.  So as a tried and true recipe there was no question it was a good one - and of course it was.  It's moist, buttery rich, with a compact and tender crumb. This recipe differs from the classic in that, like some other pound cake variations, it uses different flavorings. But it also deviates from the conventional and preferred creaming and mixing technique, which I chose to adhere to: cream the butter and sugar till light and fluffy, a good few minutes.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add in the flavoring.  Add the flour alternately with the sour cream, in thirds, beginning and ending with the flour.  That method, unless you OVERBEAT the batter or bake the cake too long, all but guarantees a perfect result.  I have to say the three flavors of extract didn't move me, although it seemed to be a good fit for the "Funfetti Cake" I made by adding 1/3 c. of colored sprinkles to the batter. In this cake it was a good fit, but I prefer a simple, vanilla-flavored pound cake by adding 1 T. of vanilla.  Still, the basic recipe is the modern-day standard by which any variations come from, so it can be prepared confidently.

this cake needs more flavor - the "crust" is delicious, but the middle is tasteless.  i know that doesn't make sense, but everyone in my family said the same thing.

Everyone LOVES this pound cake when I make it. I think I've made it 50 times in the last 4 years. It's all my brother in law wants for Christmas every year. Hints: Make sure your ingredients are room temperature when you begin--the secret to all great pound cakes. Beat each egg 60 seconds when you add it. I decrease the cook time by 10-12 minutes--we like it a little gooey at the top. Yummy!

This is the best pound cake I’ve ever had.  Made it Christmas day and it was a huge hit with the family.  The orange extract gives it an added boost.  I’ll be making this again in the future.

Good cake. Much too sweet though, I would recommend using a little less sugar. The flavor is pretty casual, so serve the cake with something else, like ice cream or strawberries.

This recipe was just okay for me. I was looking for a dense and moist cake.  I found this to be dense, but dry.  I ended up poking holes all over the cake and pouring a glaze over the top.

This is a wonderful pound cake....thank you.   If some people feel there isn't enough flavoring you can up the vanilla (only pure vanilla please).  It is also keeps for days thanks to the butter and can be used in many different ways.

I baked this cake on Christmas morning, 2014. It was absolutely fantastic. I used the exact ingredients listed but chose to whip all of the eggs into the wet ingredients before folding in the flour mixture. I think the original method could easily lead to overmixing.
The flavour was perfect, the texture nice and the whole house was filled with a wonderful fragrance of cake.
I drizzled a thinned confectioners sugar icing over the cake and scattered Christmas candy sprinkles on top.
Two days later the small remaining piece that I hid away is still fresh and moist.
By the way,I baked it for exactly 70 minutes. That seemed to work perfectly with my oven.
This cake would no doubt also be wonderful if prepared with different flavours. I'm thinking lemon extract and grated lemon rind, or even as a Rum Cake with rum syrup poured over it.
Thank you Valerie Lynne, for a wonderful recipe.

This cake is wonderful.  It's a nice change from your normal, vanilla pound cake.  The different extracts really add a flavor twist! Kids love this!

This cake was surprisingly delicious!  I wasn't sure about the 3 flavors together, but it was wonderful.  Very moist, but still had the denseness that a pound cake should.  Needed the full 70 minutes baking time, which was perfect.  A definate keeper.

I made this and it is heavenly !  The one change is I increased orange extract to one teaspoon. The cake is more like an angel food texture and taste than pound cake. Delicious !

I don’t care what anyone says this recipe is spot on. I followed the ingredients to a tee and my cake came  out delicious and moist. I did however combine the eggs and added all together though. I’m not a fan of confetti on cakes or in so I deleted that and just added my own icing without it. One last thing I used a Bundt pan because I love the shape and I made it for my niece. I asked her what kind of cake she wanted and she said pound cake with icing.  This was the best and simplest recipe.

It is the best pound cake I had ever made....we all love it.  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of almond....no orange.  We love a very almond tasting sugar cookie so I tried this the second time I made this pound cake and we'll never make it any other way.  I also found LorAnn almond flavored oil to be superior and Nielsen-Massey vanilla to be the best.

very good cake - I used vanilla flavored greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract instead of the the other extracts.
