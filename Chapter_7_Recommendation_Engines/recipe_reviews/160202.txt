Great, easy dinner.  I used olive oil and cooked the whole dish in a dutch oven.  I left out the water, because there was plenty of liquid from the beef and onion.  I served this over brown rice, low fat, healthy dish that tastes wonderful.

I rgeularly make a variation of this dish.  My husband was raised in Damascus & he loves it. I use cinnamon instead of allspice ( I'll give this a try someday ). I brown the meat in butter, chopped onion & cinnamon to change the taste of the meat. I then add the fresh green beans-cover & steam 10 minutes. I then add a 28oz can of diced tomatoes & 1 8oz can of tomato sauce..sit on low for an hou & the serve over rice. DELICIOUS!

This recipe is awsome I really think that the addition of allspice really goes well with the green beans however I added some garlic powder and crushed red hot pepper and a little white pepper I though it blended well. Thanks for the recipe..

The first time I made this it was just okay. The second time I made it, I added some things and it was delicious. Added some chopped potatoes, a pinch of white pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, some minced garlic and butter, and 1 tablespoon of crushed red pepper (I like things spicy, you might not want to add that much). I also cut the recipe in half because it makes a lot of food. Next time I will cut it in 1/4, as I am just cooking for me and my husband. Served with some Indian panera bread. Delicious!

Hahaha I so impressed my boyfriend who is from the Middle East and his mother too :-). The only thing, I felt the 1 1/2 teaspoon of allspice was a bit much for me so next time will put half the amount. By the way this makes al ot of food. Consider cutting in half.

This was simply beef and green beans with tomato sauce. I doubled the allspice, added garlic, pepper and served over rice. Still ended up with the same bland dish, beef+green beans+tomato sauce. Very disappointing.

I made this dish exactly as the original recipe directed.  It was quite watery . . . more like soup.  I would definitely recommend you serve this over rice because of all the juice.  It was pretty good but I probably won't make it again.

I felt that the allspice was too much for the recipe so I only put 1 table spoon. The family loved it but since my gastric bypass my tastebuds have changed and this was a little "different". When I think allspice, I think pumpkin pie or a dessert, not a dish really. Ginger and cinnamon is one thing but allspice is a little strong for me.

Really good flavor.  I love the allspice with the meat--you could use cinnamon instead.  This would be great over fragrant white rice (since I'm trying to be more healthy I'll use brown and pretend!)  thanks

i cooked this in a tagine and halved the recipe.  Instead of the allspice I used 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp ras el hanout 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black pepper and dash of cayenne and only used the diced tomatoes.   Came out great.

This is actually a great dish, my husband was Arabic and they add Cilantro, and it is served over rice. My daughter and I love this dish! I have also used cubed top sirloin.

My husband made this delicious dish. His mother made it for me in Egypt. There was a slight difference, but overall this was a winner!

This would have been great, I think, had I not added the water at the end.  As it was, it turned out much too watery.

This was something new to try and it was good, but it took a long time to make. I also didn't love it. Leftovers never got eaten. Won't be making again.

It wasn't that great. The beef came out bland, and the entire dish was too watery, even though I left out the water. I served it over rice, which quickly turned to mush. If I were to try this again, I'd maybe start with a better cut of beef, prepare it with the spices beforehand, cook it with the chopped onions and some minced garlic, and let it simmer for longer at the end. And maybe with potatoes instead of rice?

I added garlic power and salt and pepper to beef while browning the meat. Then when I added seasoning to the pan with the onions I added crushed garlic about a heaping teaspoon. And I used French cut green beans added them the last 25 minutes

I like the subtle spices. Nothing seems overwhelming so you get all the flavors. Fresh green beans are a must.
