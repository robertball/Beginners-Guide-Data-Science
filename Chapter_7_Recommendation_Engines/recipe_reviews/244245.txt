This was the last dish my Dad ever made me. We grilled out on the lake for my birthday, and he cooked up these shrimp with aoili on the side. He was so proud of these, and they were truly fantastic. It was unforgettable to say the least. Thank you for helping to create such a special food memory involving my Dad. I'll never forget that dish or that day at the lake.

This was one of the best grilled shrimp recipes I've ever made!! My family loved it and said it was restaurant quality. I made the shrimp pretty close to what was written using fresh herbs from our garden.  I did not have lemon thyme so I used plain thyme. Delicious. A must make again!! Thank you Chef  John!!

I have made this three times in the last two weeks. We serve the shrimp chilled as an appetizer. Everyone loves it that way. 
Thanks Chef John you did it again.  I’m using herbs from my garden.

Wonderful flavor! I did not have time to marinate as long as suggested. I also threw all the marinade ingredients into the small cup of my Ninja processor which was very quick. Then placed the 2/3 marinade in a ziplock with the shrimp and let it sit while I was making side dishes. Very quick and delicious dinner. Thank you!

Another great recipe by Chef John.  I don't use a lot of salt, so I found this to be too salty for me so  I will just reduce the amount of salt the next time.  The herb combination was perfect for this grilled shrimp.

We loved it!   I didn't have fresh thyme, so I had to substitute dry.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as directed.  This will be my go-to recipe for grilled shrimp!

This was very good.  I made a few changes.  I only used 1 lb shrimp, added cilantro, did not use thyme, increased the lemon juice (full lemon and a little extra).  I probably add more garlic next time I make this  -- mmm.

I rarely give any recipe 5 stars but this was REALLY good.  I had tried many grilled shrimp recipes but either too blah or one that was so spicy even I who loves spice couldn't handle.  Made this with no changes and had a good enough flavor to satisfy me and hubby who doesn't like too spicey.  Be sure to put a tad more than sprinkle of cayenne.  Restaurant quality.
Thanks Chef John.

Sooo good! I made this along with Chef Johns Garlic Steak. Paired with halved grilled onions and cherry tomatoes in the same sauce.

Doubled the marinade recipe however only used 1/2 the salt and it was still too salty. Also only used 1/3rd of the lemon required for the sauce afterwards and it was way too much lemon, maybe just needs a squeeze next time. Stir fried it in a pan although it was missing the nice toasty taste from the sear.

I think this was the best shrimp we have ever made at home. Followed Chef John’s recipe and got to use my almost forgotten mortar and pestle. We grilled it on high as suggested. Didn’t have all the exact fresh herbs but this turned out amazing. Will definitely make again!

The prep work was extensive but  this we pretty tasty! 
We went to cook them & discovered we were out of propane & then we were in a rush to get to a saxophone lesson so we had to cook these in or our Cuisinart Grill & they turned out really really good. Will def have to make again but use the grill.

This is the perfect combination of herbs to make a great marinade.  My dinner party loved it!  I recommend you make it as the recipe states, though I used a small food processor rather than the mortar and pestle.

Enjoyed this recipe even if it did require mo e ingredients (herbs) than I ususally have on hand. A bit putty. Be careful not to over cook shrimp.

These where a real hit with the family and not too difficult once I invested in the mortar and pestle.  Will definitely make again!

This was okay for us.  I put all the marinade in a food processor instead of hand grinding.  I had hoped for more with this recipe.

These shrimp were amazing - full of flavor and even the kids asked for seconds! We made them for dinner last night, and I packed the leftovers with a little drizzle of sauce for lunch today. I normally eat leftovers very grudgingly but these were actually even better today than they were last night. 
This one will be a regular in our house!
- Be sure to check your serving sauce for flavor before adding any additional salt. We found it was perfect without it.

These were fantastic! I couldn't find fresh lemon thyme near me so I used regular thyme and a bit more lemon zest. I happened to also get an especially juicy lime so that added more lemon flavor in the sauce. Don't skip the sauce!! It was delicious!!

I had fresh basil, but the rest I used dried herbs. I also did use real garlic that I minced. I put it all in a biggie with the shrimp for a few hours before grilling. This came out fantastic and was very easy. The whole family loved it.

CHEF JOHN THANK YOU FOR THIS DELICIOUS RECIPE. I JUST GOT DONE EATING THESE TASTY SHRIMP. I AM GIVING IT A FOUR ONLY BECAUSE FOR MY AND MY HUSBANDS TASTE IT WAS TOO SALTY, WHICH IS AN EASY FIX NEXT TIME WE HAVE THEM. I DIDN'T USE ANY OF THE LEFT OVER SAUCE AS I DON'T THINK THE SHRIMP NEEDED IT.

Way too salty, and too much prep time needed. I would opt for a different recipe next time.
