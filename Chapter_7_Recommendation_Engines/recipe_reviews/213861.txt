I mixed the sour cream with a block of cream cheese and used up a pound of real bacon. I also topped it with green onions. Huge hit at a baby shower!

This was delicious. I added Lipton onion soup mix to the sour cream instead of onion powder and it turned out great.

I didn't layer this dip, I just kind of mixed it up all together, saving a little cheese out to garnish the top. I used a full pound of bacon and doubled everything but the lettuce and sour cream. I did add a tablespoon or so of chopped chives and a small bunch of green onions I chopped and a teaspoon of garlic powder. My boys really loved this. The little bit I tried, I enjoyed. Doubling everything isn't absolutely necessary, we just like a chunkier, fuller dip. This was good with chips but even better with Wheat Thins. If you're watching your weight, be careful with this one. It's addictive.

I made this for a 4th of July gathering at the beach and it was a huge hit!  I used the pre-cooked bacon but used about double what the recipe calls for. Also, I would say that the sour cream layer was a little bland so next time I would add a bit of sea salt or garlic salt, the onion powder alone was not enough.  I added some sliced scallions as well.  And lastly, I used iceberg lettuce and chopped it up fine and served it with scoop-type corn chips.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Every loved this at our Memorial Day gathering.  I mixed 8 oz. sour cream and chive dip, 8 oz. sour cream, and one finely-chopped green onion.  Really kicked up the flavor.

I hate to say I did make changes based on other's recommendations but this was fabulous!  I used 8 oz. sour cream and 8 oz. cream cheese.  I used a full pound of bacon, cooked crisp, then crumbled.  I also doubled the onion powder.  Delicious!

I used a little bit of everyone's suggestions for this for Mother's Day! Really good! 
Used light cr cheese w/light sour cream. Added onion powder and salt and pepper to sour cream mixture. Added green onions to top and doubled bacon. Used bagged shredded lettuce for ease. Thanks for a unique, yummy recipe!
