This sounded like a wonderful idea, but the hearts lost their shape in the oven... a little disappointed in that part.  Great tasting and of course easy to put into the cookie cutter, but still... disappointing..

this recipe worked great with a little alteration of my own.  since the cookies lose their shape in the oven, i undercooked them just a little so they were nice and soft and then RECUT them with the cookie cutters.  i then popped them back into the oven to crisp them up a little, and they came out perfect!
