I have been making this since the Philly Cooking Creme came on the market. I grill the chicken over charcoal briquets or on a stovetop grill, then cool and cut into bite sized pieces. Any kind of pasta will work. I like penne pasta, fettucine or bowties. I use leftover grilled asparagus, broccoli or frozen peas. I saute' chopped onion, julienne tri-colored peppers (or diced pimentos), and sauteed mushrooms. Really, whatever you have on hand or whatever you like. Put it all together, add a container of cooking creme, and you've got dinner. The garlic cooking creme is delish in mashed potatoes.

I plugged in the two ingredients I had on hand (stirfry veggies and cooking creme--thanks to coupons!) and this is what popped up. I added fresh onions and minced garlic that I sauteed in a little EVOO and butter, then I went on with the recipe. After all the ingredients were incorporated, I had to stir in some chicken broth because it was just too thick and honestly, goopy. I didn't measure, I just added until it was the consistancy I was looking for. All in all, it was okay. Very bland. I think this is a good place to start but it needs some goosing up. If I were to make this again, I'd season the chicken before sauteing it and I'd add some fresh shredded parmesan to the sauce to start with. This was a quick dinner, which I appreciated.

Very good.  This is the recipe on the back of the tub of cooking creme.  I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, but it surprised me and turned out to be very good and was easy and quick to prepare.  You can put basically any vegetables you have on hand in this dish.  I added a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables and also went through the fridge and added whatever was available (zucchini, carrot, celery).  This recipe is a great way to add veggies to your diet.

Surprisingly good!  Although there seemed to be so few vegetables when mixed together that I added the rest of the bag (equalling 5 cups frozen vegetables) and there was more than enough sauce to coat.

I used red pepper, snow peas, carrots, cauliflower and broccoli. Steamed them before adding them.
It was great. Could have been a little more juicy but so simple, so good and so just great!!!

SIMPLE!  VERSATILE!  You can pretty much customize this recipe any way you'd like... chicken, shrimp, veggie only.  I used fresh veggies instead of frozen only because I happened to have the time, but I would have no problem using frozen on a busy day.  
I used half Italian Cooking Creme and half Original since my family isn't big on strong Italian flavors.  I also added some freshly grated parmesean cheese for a cheesy undertone.

I would rate this dish somewhere in the neighborhood of pretty good/just okay. It was simple to make and proved to be a great way to get rid of some extra veggies that I had in the fridge. I used a bag of frozen vegetable mix (broccoli, carrots, green beans, and mushrooms). I also threw in some leftover peas and half of a red pepper that I had laying around. This dish made a whole lot of servings... my fiance and I are on day 3 of the leftovers (which are definitely not as good as the fresh entree)! I will maybe make this again as a quick weekday dinner, but it really wasn't overwhelmingly delicious.

This is definitely kid friendly and adaptable to whatever you have.  Personally, I didn't really enjoy it, even after ramping up the seasonings to include fresh onion and garlic in the 'sauce'.  The texture itself screams 'MELTED CREAM CHEESE' which doesn't appeal to this mommy.  The kids each had seconds--in a pinch this is useful but won't be in our regular rotation of dishes.  I used frozen broccoli as our vegetable and farfalle pasta instead of fettuccine.

Pretty good for how fast and easy it is.  I will add more vegetables next time.  Also used whole wheat penne instead of fettuccine.

This was alright. Even with extra cooking cream, it was still a bit dry once it was added to the pasta. It was easy enough, but I don't think I'll make it again.

The whole idea of a "recipe" at least on this web site is to make a dish from the core ingredients and not rely on a store bought sauce particulary when its the primary part.

Using the cooking cream scored points for being easy and fast, but the flavor was only OK.  No one refused to eat it, but no one asked when we were having it again.

It was good. I added about 2/3 cup milk to the sauce to make it less pastey. Definitely use fresh veggies, none of this frozen . Was fast and easy. VERY fattening though...100% saturated fat in the Philadelphia Creme...

I agree that it was very bland and needed more spices. It didn't make good leftoevers, the sauce dried out and it lost it flavor. It was very simple to make and a good way to incorporate veggies, but I think there are better recipes for the Philly Cooking Creme

It was ok and definitely easy, but kinda blah.  It served as a meal in a pinch, but nothing I'd make again.  Among those in my family, I was the one who liked it best, and I only ate the leftovers because they were there.

Loved this - Quick and Easy! I made it with some broccoli, different colored peppers and onions all fresh and on hand.  Would be great with stir-fry veggies too I'm sure. 
I recommend using 2 tubs of the Cream Cheese though.  Otherwise your pasta will be quite dry.

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it!! I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't do well as a left over. The cream gets kind of dry. But other than that, it's great! I will be making it again when I don't have time to cook!

I really liked this, didn't find it bland. This was my first time using the cooking creme and I will definitely look for more recipes for the other flavors now. I did use some frozen stir fry vegetables, but also threw in whatever I had leftover sitting around (a few stray mushrooms and shredded carrots.) It is a great way to use up extra veggies and to have a veggie-heavy meal which is really hearty. This would probably be good without the chicken, just as a vegetarian dish. The main thing I liked about this dish was its simplicity and quick prep time. A definite winner. Side note: at first I couldn't find the cooking creme in my local supermarket. I looked for it next to the cream cheese, which seemed like the most logical place for it. But in my store it was actually located next to the butter.

As another reviewer said- totally blah. Wont make it again. Nice idea but I have higher expectations I guess for flavor. It was just so bland.

I couldn't find the cream cheese it called for so used onion and chive instead.  It was ok.
