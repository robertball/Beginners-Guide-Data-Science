My dog really enjoyed these treats. I omitted the garlic per another reviewer because dogs are NOT supposed to consume garlic. Otherwise a great recipe and I made these on a couple of occasions.

I make a double recipe of these once a month, half of it for my 2 toy maltese dogs and the other half for my K9 work dog.  I make half the recipe in a mini muffin pan for sofia and astro and use a regular pan for my work dog Matrix.  They love them!!

I made these for JunkYard, the mascot/guard dog at work, and he loved them!  He just wandered into the yard one day and stayed, so we don't know how old he is, but he's definitely a senior and deserving of some spoiling.  The extra nutrition doesn't hurt him, either.;)  Finally, a treat that is good for him.  This recipe is a keeper.

My dog loved these! I didn't have any apples in so I used some shredded zucchini that I had frozen from my garden this past summer. I'm looking forward to making them again with apples. They were also a big hit with the other dogs I gave them to. Thanks for the dog friendly recipe!

Thanks Mrs. K for an awesome recipe. These were so fun to make. Never thought of grating an apple before but it was nothing like I thought it might be. I made these for my Mini Schnauzer's 11th birthday. She and her 2 brothers just scoffed these up. They absolutely loved them. Will be busy making more of these!

OMG!!! Our dogs Oscar & Maggie & Coco loved these!!! I added a bitty bit of sliced swiss cheese to the tops while baking. Also, made some with tuna for our outside cat, Marlin. We giving some to my SIL's dog Sherriff when they come for Father's Day tomorrow. Thanks for the post, my boys and I had a lot of fun making these and dividing them up between the dogs (and cat)! (: (: (:

Our German Shepherd Saxon LOVED these treats!  He wanted the mix prior to me cooking it.  This recipe proved to be well worth making it from scratch.  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you Mrs K for a treat my Toy Poodle (Little Special) can eat. I have to watch his weight  and with all the other illnesses he has this is one he can have. He has gotten to the point if I forget to give him one he goes and stands in front of the fridge to remind me. He loves them. Once again, thank you for such a good treat.

Morgan and Aspen (Black Labs) send big puppy slurps and snuggles to you, Mrs. K, for sharing this recipe. They gave it a big 5 paws, for sure! They LOVE these! Morgan has bad allergies (food, environmental, you name it) and we have a hard time finding things for special treats for her. These are perfect for her and her baby sister is just as excited. Thank you!

Fantastic. Dropped the garlic and apple and cheese. Added peanut butter. I cut mine in 1/4 and freeze. When we open the freezer, my husband yells to the dogs that the vault has opened. 3 dogs come running.

Made these for my dog Koli's 21 run (3rd bday)!!! Both dogs loved them, I added a little peanut butter as "frosting" since they love it so much and also omitted the garlic.

Please omit the garlic, it is toxic to dog's.  We added 1/2 shredded carrot to our treats and topped them with a bit of pumpkin butter.

Perfect! All the dogs loved them. I brought some of these to where we go to dog obedience, and even the picky eaters loved them. I omitted the onions and used regular flout, then added a treat in the top when they were still soft. Will use again!

I baked these about two hours ago.  When they cooled, I gave one each to my chihuahua, pug and peke.  They went crazy (woofed them down!).  I made in 24 mini pan and suspect I will be making these many times.   Thanks so much for sharing these great little treats.

I followed the recipe. I used gluten free all purpose flour instead of whole wheat and omitted the baking powder and garlic powder.  I added ingredients I had on hand (golden flax seeds, sweet potato, peanut butter, fresh parsley).  I call it my "Kitchen-sink" version of the pup cake!  I made mini-muffin sized cakes as I have a 15 year old Lhasa. Perfect size for her!

Super fun recipe. Raw garlic bulbs are deadly to dogs. Garlic in a cooked format (cells broken down) is not. It’s a great herb to use with picky eaters when you need training treats. Doberman and terrier love them and all sorts of derivatives of this recipe-- different cheese, different fruits, different flours, all inhaled.

My dogs are hesitant with new food, but once they got the first bite they loved it. The only changes i made were I left out the garlic since I saw people say to leave it out, and i shredded just a little carrot, maybe a tablespoon if that...and then i just put a little bit of peanut butter on the top for icing..the rest i followed exactly...thanks!!!

I have made these twice now, the first time, I followed the recipe but omitted the garlic. The 2nd time, I used rice flour and added no sugar/salt turkey bacon pieces. My little pup is kinda picky so he wasn't a fan of the first ones. The 2nd ones with the addition of the turkey bacon, huge success. I added a peanut butter icing as well. Thanks!

Minnie and Ozzie loved these!  I followed the recipe except for the garlic. I didn't think it was necessary. I used a mini muffin pan and got 24 pup-cakes.  I sprayed the pan with oil and baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  They turned out great.  I have to admit I tasted one myself. Not something I would eat on a regular basis but it was not bad. I will absolutely make these again since the dogs LOVED them.

I made this for my dogs Birthday and all 3 of my dogs loved them.  Even my dog who usually just picks at treats that i make myself ate them! I made the following changes and they turned out great. I omitted the cheese and used 3 small apples that I wanted to use up. I also added about 1/4 cup of peanut butter and omitted the garlic since it can be poisonous to dogs. I have 3 dogs under 20lbs so I used a small cupcake pan instead of the large ones and I did not line mine, I just sprayed them with cooking spray instead. I baked them for 10 mins at 350 until a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean. They just pop right out of the pan when you flip it over.

My Corgis love most treats, they think the fish oil gel I give them to help with shedding is a treat. Terrible breath too. I added a  little parsley and mint to help with breath. My dogs loved them. Easy to make too.

According to Gregory Tilford, (author of All You Ever Wanted to Know About Herbs for Pets), dogs can quite safely consume 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder per pound of food 3 to 4 times a week.

Just thought I'd throw that in there, as I was on the fence about garlic, too...Making these for our bulldog's 6th birthday tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe...I think they'll agree with him more than his customary vanilla cupcake.    :)

Made it for my little ones 1st birthday. Had 6 different dogs all love them! I didn't put garlic in it and I put a little treat in the middle. 5/5.

I made these last night and my two dogs loved them.  I don't think one of them actually got to taste it much before it was gobbled up.  I followed the recipe except I didn't put garlic in.  I used small bite size muffin tin and got 24 out of the batch.  Sent some to school with daughter for her teachers dogs to try.  I am sure they will love them.  I will be making these for the dogs lots and I love knowing what is exactly in them...  Thanks for the great recipe.

Made these for Max's 4th b-day today!  This recipe is rated 4 paws up says Max!  He was crying for more after the first one.  I gave him two right after they had cooled and another in the evening.  He was jumping up and down for that one! I sprinkled a bit of extra shredded cheddar on top right before they came out of the oven.  He smelled them when I was doing this, so I knew they were going to be a hit.   Thanks for the great recipe!
