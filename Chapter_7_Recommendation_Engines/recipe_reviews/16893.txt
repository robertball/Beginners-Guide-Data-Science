I really enjoyed this recipe - it's different and tasty. A couple of tips: add the 
carrots later in the cooking process. After simmering with the rice for an hour, 
they got pretty soft. Also, be careful when you put the soup in the blender - 
because it is so hot, it flares up when you run the blender. Leave plenty of room 
for steam to escape - it might be safer to blend it in two batches of 1 cup each, 
unless your blender pitcher is larger than normal.

This was pretty good.  It had a great texture, I mean, it was wonderful.  (It just could have used a bit more flavor).  I didn't plan on pureeing it, so I thickened it with some milk and flour.  It got pretty thick that way, and I still added the cream.  It was smooth, and just thick enough.  I would even say it was silky, lol.  I added two garlic cloves, and used a grocery store rotisserie chicken.  Served with "cheese bread" from this site.  Very filling!  I got my wild rice at Trader Joe's- much cheaper than it would be elsewhere.

This was extremely good!  I added a bit extra chicken (3 boneless skinless breasts, pan fried in butter).  I also used a 3 rice blend, because that's what I could find in the store - I think it was wild, regular, and red rice.  It didn't have to cook as long as the directions stated.  It was SO good!  Next time, I'm not going to bother pureeing it, because it was just fine without that step, and that way I won't have to clean the darn food processor!

I really liked this chowder with just a few changes. First, I used 2 pounds cut up chicken breast stir fried in minced garlic with 1 tablespoon italian spice. I used my crockpot to cook it all in and added the heavy cream 1 hour before serving.  I did not puree any of the soup and it still came out thick and hearty.

This is a great creamy wild rice soup!  Taste is similar to the wild rice soup at "Grandma's restaurant in Duluth, Minnesota. I think I will put some mushrooms in it next time.

This is a really tasty and wonderfully hearty soup. It does tend to get very thick, so extra liquid is necessary. Also, leaving out the bay leaf and substituting a bouillon/water combination for part of the stock still makes a great soup!

I was looking for the perfect recipe to use my wild rice--and I found it!  I made this soup for a "tail gate" meal during this year's harvest.  My father-in-law said, "There's nothing wrong with this soup," meaning he really, really liked it.  My husband agreed that it was a keeper.  A change I made was reducing the broth to about 6 cups because I only had about 1 cup wild rice, and I like my soup to be thicker.   You absolutely must season this soup, or it will be bland!  I used creole seasoning to flavor instead of salt and pepper (creole is a staple in our kitchen).  Thanks for the awesome and EASY recipe!

I loved this recipe!  I did use half and half instead of the heavy cream. It wasn't very thick, but use it if you want it more like soup than chowder.  I added mushrooms and garlic as well.  Will definitly make again and again!!

I made this recipe on a cold fall night for my husband and Mother-in-law and it was absoulutly perfect. The soup was full of flavor, creamy, and totally wonderful. The ingrediants seemed a bit simple when I looked at it, but after trying it I could eat this every night!

This was really good.  I used canned and cooked wild rice, so that cut my cooking time down quite a bit.  Also, as other readers have said, be careful if you are using chicken broth as some of them have lots of salt.  I had used Tone's Chicken Base and it is very salty...so I didn't add any additional salt to the chowder.  In the end I ended up using 2 cans of cooked wild rice, 3 chicken breasts (boneless), 5 cups of broth and then the rest of the ingredients listed by Michelle.  My family loved it, even my 4 year old. Will make again!

Hearty and tasty!  Threw this together for a quick lunch for a friend and I.  I agree pureeing 2 cups of the soup is key to the consistency.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this chowder.  The flavor is great!  It has become my favorite soup.  I've cooked it as is several times and also left out the carrotts.  Either way it is great.  Just be sure you leave ample time to cook the rice.  Also, have extra chicken broth on hand for leftovers as it tends to get thicker as the days go by and the rice absorbs the liquid.

I made this recipe for my very picky family and they loved it! It's so simple and great for when the weathers cold.  It was better than any soup in any resturaunt and it's great to hear my family say, "I can't believe you made this"

Good flavor, texture. Love the wild rice. Thanks! The only change I make is substituting lactose free milk for the cream since I am allergic to cream. Makes it not as thick of a chowder as the recipe calls for, but it works for me.

Contrary to many other reviews I did not need to add any seasoning save for a little pepper and a tiny pinch each of dired thyme and tarragon. The flavours of the vegetables came through beautifully and the wild rice adds an earthy nutty flavour. I'm not sure if the fact that I am Eurpoean (we don't add a lot of seasoning to our food) had an impact or not, but my husbund, who is American (thought he did spend 5 years on Europe and has been eating my food for 4 years) loved it too. I cut down the heavy cream to 1/4 cup and made up the rest with milk. I also replaced most of the cooking fat with olive oil and just a tiny amount of butter.

I am by no way a soup person but I LOVED this chowder! I followed the instructions except I used half and half and added one extra cup of (grilled) chicken. It was terrific! I can't wait to have the leftovers...

This smelled wonderful. I did it in my slow cooker and used two baked chicken breasts. I also did not puree. As I said, it smelled wonderful and the veggies and chicken were great, but the liquid part was lacking something. It didn't have much flavor and we ended up adding salt to each serving. I'll work with it.

I am a great fan of various types of soup and was looking forward to trying this recipe.
Basically, it was average and I have to admit that I never finished the leftovers that I 
had planned to have the next evening.

Pretty good! I wanted to make soup at the last minute for lunch today and this didn't take any more than thirty minutes to make PLUS I was able to use some canned foods out of my pantry. I used a pkg. of Uncle Ben's rice, canned white chicken (think the big cans you can buy at Costco), and a large can of mushrooms, rinsed. I did stir a half cup of fresh parmesan cheese into the hot, cooked rice before combining it with the soup. Very filling and most comforting on an overcast day like today. This made enough to eat on for the rest of the week, too.....combined with half a sandwich!

This was great!  Had wonderful flavor and texture!  I forgot the bay leaf but oh well....maybe next time.  Pureeing the 2 cups of soup is a must for a chowder like consistency.  Definitely will be making this again!!!

This was hearty and delicious -- a perfect fall soup!  Like other posters, I bumped up the chicken, and I also used a can of evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream.  SO yummy!

This was wonderful!  I sauteed the breast halves and set aside.  Then I sauteed the onion, garlic, and celery, adding a tsp of Italian seasoning (as recommended by Laurey1). I proceeded as directed, using a wild/brown rice medley.  After 45 minutes, I added the carrots and chopped chicken.  This was sooooo delicious, hardly anyone spoke at the dinner table (a rarity)! My 2 year old even ate two whole bowls (also a rarity!) Will definitely be making this again. Soon.

Excellent soup/chowder.  The only addition I made was to add fresh sliced mushrooms.  The flavor was fantastic.  I skipped the "puree" step because I felt the consistency was great the way it was.  This is definitely a "keeper" recipe.  Thanks for sharing this one!

YUM! I loved the taste of this soup and did not have to add anything to it.  I did use brown basmati rice, though, and I thought it really added to the flavor.  This is a keeper.

I thawed a chicken breast most of the way, cut it up, and just threw it in the pot, letting it cook in the broth and that worked well.  Added about 1/2tsp of salt at the end, a few turns of the peppermill, a couple of tablespoons of sherry, and a dash or two of cayenne pepper (barely noticeable).  Even still, the broth was a bit bland, but a nice chowder on a very cold night!  UPDATE:  This tastes better the next day; also added a few spoonfuls of homemade pesto and that gave it the flavor boost it needed for us.  Thank you, Michelle!

This is such a delicious fall dish! I had to make a few changes due to a lack of ingredients, I didn't use carrots but I added 1 chopped turnip, 6 chopped baby potatoes, and I substituted the heavy cream with a mixture of 1/2 c milk and 4 tbsp of butter. The texture turned out perfectly, even my picky family enjoyed it!

This was a very good and filling chowder.  My husband and I both really liked it.  My 2 year old liked it, but my 4 & 6 year olds did not really care for it.  I used Basmati rice, which is what I had.  I didn't have celery, so I used cream of celery soup.  I also did not have a bay leaf, so I left it out.  Everything else was the same.  I did not puree the soup and I don't think it would have made a difference.  I shredded the chicken before adding it.  It did make a very thick chowder.

One of the best soups I've ever made! At my husband's request, I left out the cream and did not puree the soup--it was divine. Such a great flavor from such simple ingredients! We were impressed.

This recipe was impressive.  Very simple, earthy and elegant.  The next day it's even better but it thickens up a lot.  Just add more canned stock and a dash of milk or cream.  Love this soup!

This recipe was restaurant quality.  I thought it had terrific flavor. I used water & boulion for the broth.  If you do that, be careful it doesn't get too salty. Everyone older than 10 loved this.  My 3 younger ones did not like chewing the wild rice.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this soup! I used seasoning salt instead of regular salt, but that was the only sub.

I got this recipe off this website a year ago, and it has become one of our family favorites!  I have made it for most of my friends, all of whom have raved about it; one friend called it the perfect comfort meal.  Give this recipe a try -- you will love it!

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I did do as another person suggested and sauted the chicken (2 cups) in Italian seasoning and Garlic before sticking everything in a crockpot to cook on high for 4 hrs. This is perfect for a fall/winter meal!

My family and I absolutely loved this soup.  The flavor was great.  I did find it to be pretty thick, so I simply added some milk to get a good consistency.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe! Doubled the chicken, brushed melted butter and poultry seasoning on the chicken and then broiled. Used canned chicken broth, added minced garlic to the sauteed vegetables and then plenty of garlic powder, some salt and pepper. Thank you...this will definitely be made again and again!

Good, thick soup.  I left out the celery and added about a tablespoon of minced garlic.  I also added an extra cup of chicken stock because the soup was a little thick for my liking.

This is great!  Perfect homemade chicken wild rice soup. Best part: gluten free!!!  I cooked mine in a crock pot and the rice took a long time to cook, but once it was done I added the 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and it was ready to eat right away. I added salt to taste. Also - I did not puree anything, it is already thick enough. I also added extra chicken.  Next time I will add mushrooms, then it will be perfect. LOVE this soup!

Made the recipe as written.  I think that was my mistake. It was terribly bland. i used regular wild rice like listed in recipe, no seasoning packet. The other person was right, not a very visually appetizing dish. I would not make this again, even with a seasoning packet!

Quite tasty. Due to the reviews of this recipe being bland, I added the spices from the Chicken Wild Rice Soup I recipe on this site, which included 1/2 teaspoon each of salt, curry powder, mustard powder and dried parsley. The curry powder was the secret ingredient. Its just enough to provide flavor but it doesn't taste like curry chicken - it's almost like a secret ingredient. Also added mushrooms. Would make again.

Very good basis for a chowder. As we all experience our different versions of stock and chicken etc mean seasoning is needed to taste at the end of cooking.   Changes I used - pulled rotisserie chicken, soup bits wild rice so cooking time was reduced,  added bacon bits as that is a family favorite, and used my immersion blender in the stock pot.  Note: even better as leftovers as many others have stated.

To me this soup had no flavor to it.  I used roasted chicken (homemade) and concentrated homemade chicken stock.   It sort of tasted like warm milk with a slight bit of flavor to it.  I tried adding all sort of other seasonings - garlic, savory, marjoram, smoked paprika, etc but nothing worked.  My husband who will eat just about anything had about two spoonfuls before stopping.  I don't like posting such a negative review - but if one is looking for something with a robust flavor this is not it.

It was pretty good. I added some oregano and basil while it simmered on the stove. ADD cheese at the end, it makes it come together well :)

This is a very good soup. Made it using an instant wild rice mix (also added the seasoning packet from the box). I didn't bother to puree anything and think it turned out terrific. My sick husband really liked it. Even better the second day.

This was good. I added a coarsely chpd red bell pepper & some roasted garlic I had in the fridge. I also added more leftover chicken to increase the protein. It makes a lg amount and is filling. But if you plan to have several people over, I'd recommend it. It was simple, tasted good, smelled good & looked good. Crusty bread (especially with euro style butter) goes quite well.

It was very easy to make, good flavor and it does help to add more chicken stock. I also added more chicken and it was a very hearty soup for our cold winter days, but it is less than appetizing to look at.
