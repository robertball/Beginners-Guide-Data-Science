This is a great pizza - very tasty.  A little greasy, but that's from all of the cold meats.  I was worried that a lack of sauce wouldn't make a great pizza, but both my husband and I loved this.  I will definitely make it again.

This a great variation of the Muffaletta sandwich!  I substituted cappicola for the mortadella, which my deli didn't carry, and it was still great!  Even my kids loved it!

Merry Christmas everyone! This was excellent! Everyone who tried it oohed and aahed. I only used 1/4 lb of prosciutto since I was serving this with other appetizers and I didn't want it to be too filling, and that was plenty of meat! Prosciutto is very salty-be prepared. This looks great and tastes excellent! I would recommend going easy on the meats. It may not be authentic but you'll never miss them!

This was ok. Just not really our thing, I guess. Thanks.

I am originally from N'awlins and crave the muffaletta taste from time to time, however, it is difficult to find the italian bread to make a muffaletta, found this recipe and made it over the weekend.......DELISH, A TASTE OF HOME.....I didn't make the olive salad, bought some Boscoli's from HEB, can be found at Wal-marts........

This is absolutely fantastic. I've been making this for a few years for various events and it's always the first thing to go. I do assemble it slightly different than the recipe. I like spread the olive mixture on the  pizza dough and then  sprinkle the meat/cheese mixture on top. It gives it a nicer finish, in my opinion.

This was a great appetizer for our Mardi Gras Party.  To make it a little easier, I used a jar of Muffuletta Olive spread instead of creating my own.  Everyone loved it.  I will make this for more than just Mardi Gras.

This was very good - I did modify it though. I did not use any of the deli meats - and I only the mozzarella cheese. I used Trader Joes herb Pizza dough and followed the rest of the recipe as stated. My husband and I loved it. We like the "sauceless" pizza. I make vegetable pizza quite often - but I usually top the dough with vegis and then sprinkle on the shredded cheese the last 2 minutes of baking. I really liked this recipe's method of prebaking the pizza crust and then mixing the vegis with the shredded mozzarella cheese - It was delicious! I will be making this again!

This was tastey. The only change I made was I used just hard salami and a spicey ham. Everyone liked it. It's easy to assemble and baked less then the prescribed 5 minutes. I'd make it again.

OMG this was amazing, i used the jarred olive salad and it got a little oily so i recommend draining it really good.  I used hard salami, pepperoni, and prosciutto.  yum yum.

Oh. My. Word. This pizza is absolutely heavenly! I followed the recipe to a "T", except I had to use dried parsley and basil because that's what I had on hand.  I omitted the prosciutto because my store only had the prepackaged slices (for almost 7 bucks), and I don't care for the taste, anyway. I was able to get two personal sized pizzas from the servings suggested, and it was perfect. I'm having the second one for lunch today. Well worth the prep time because the end result is delicious! Thanks so much SGRINAVI, I'll be making this again.

FABULOUS!  My family loved it, and it was a huge hit at the potluck (disappered before mealtime began!)  I didn't use as much meal (just about 1/4 C. sliced salami), and used cheddar instead of the provolone.  It's really the olive mixture that makes this so amazing - what an amazing combination of flavors!  Thanks for sharing this one.

Loved it!  I thought I had salami, but when I started making this I realized I did not, so I just used prosciutto and imported ham.  I took a little short cut and used Amazing Muffaletta Olive Salad from this site and mixed about a cup of that into the cold cuts and cheese.  This was just delicious! While we did have it as part of our dinner, it is a bit salty/briny (perhaps because I used the other salad recipe) so I think it's best served as an appetizer or finger food at a party as opposed to a traditional slice of pizza.    But I loved it, and will definitely make again!

I totally dug it!  I subbed out the prosciutto with ham and also added a splash of bottled pepperoncini liquid to the olive mixture, in hopes of blending the flavors quicker.  I burnt the crust during the broil, though, so keep a good eye on it after the first 3 minutes.  Fantastic - I can't wait to make it again!

Our favorite pizza place, Mellow Mushroom, has the best Muffaletta pizza in the world.  So, when I found this recipe I assumed there was no way it could taste as good.  I was wrong!  Delicious pizza!  I used Central Grocery (New Orleans) Olive Salad which took care of the first 9 ingredients. It's already in olive oil also, so I didn't add any extra to the crust.  Came out perfect!

i'm not sure if everyone else who liked this used thick crust dough but to me it was very salty.. i tend to like dishes that are well seasoned so idk what my issue was.. bf said it's salty bc of all the meats (pls note that i halved the amount of the meats) and that i shouldn't think of this as a pizza but more like a crustini or a flatbread.. maybe if i had this as a dip for crackers i'd like it more

All the flavor and less 'bread' than a muffaletta sandwich
