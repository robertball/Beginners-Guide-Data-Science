I use this recipe every year and it's wonderful.  Don't use semi-sweet chocolate and it will be yummy.  I make one useing white chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and slivered almonds and people rave.  It's quick and easy.  I don't microwave the chocolate, I make it on the stove using very low heat.  I've used cruched candy canes with milk chocolate, peanuts, butter schotch chips swirled in...it's all been wonderful.  Just don't use semi-sweet, you'll be fine.

My family loved these! My niece helped me make them, the only thing we did differently was we melted the chocolate and butter on the stove. SO YUMMY

I followed this recipe to a T and mine just didn't turn out tasting as good as I thought it would from the reviews.  I had a feeling it was too easy to be really good.  It just tasted overpoweringly like semisweet chocolate to me.  I used Baker's chocolate and everything (I am loyal to the Baker brand). But I feel like I just wasted all the ingredients it on this recipe.  

I should have taken the time and extra effort to make a really good  fudge instead of trying to take a shortcut with this recipe.  It was a waste of both time and money, two things that are very precious at this time of year.

I'm disappointed Baker's would put out a sub-par recipe.  (But they still sell the best shredded coconut).

This is a fast easy recipe, BUT , it needs to be made with sweeeter chocolate. Because the end product is a little bitter. I aso suggest you put it in the freezer for 15 min. then proceed to put it in the frige so it's firmer. I still enjoyed this. GOOD TREAT!!!

This was not creamy at all and it was way too chocolately.  I am still looking for a good fudge recipe.

This came out tasting too bitter to eat.  I cannot figure out what I did wrong.  The only thing I can think of is, I must have microwaved the chocolate too long (even though I didn't microwave it any longer than the recipe said and I watched it very carefully.  I thought from the ingredients that this recipe wouldn't be really good because it sounded too simple.  When I read the reviews, I thought it must be a lot better than the recipe sounded.  Unfortunately, I should have followed my intuition.  I won't be serving this fudge to my guests.  It's just too bitter.  

Now I have to go buy more tonight to make another batch of fudge (different recipe, obviously.

Easy enough for the kids to help with, yet tastes like you worked hard at it.  Great recipe.

First fudge I've ever made and it came out very creamy and good; I read the other reviews about it being too bitter -- I used one part white chocolate to three parts semi-sweet.  Came out fantastic -- also, I used ghirardelli. I've been asked to make it again.

I am not generally good at making fudge, but this was the easiest recipe i have ever found, and it turned out great. No spoon needed! I even got compliments. I will use this recipe often.

This fudge was very un-fudge-like to me and my sister. It was not sweet at all and did not even have the same consistency as other fudge recipes we've made. If you are looking for an easy-to-make sweet fudge, please keep looking. You'll be happy you did.
