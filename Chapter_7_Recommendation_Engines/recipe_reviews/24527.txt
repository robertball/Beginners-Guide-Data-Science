This was made for my sister and I when we were little, only we called it "Toad in the Hole". I made this today for my boys, just to make today a little easier. I used a star cookie cutter and after the egg cooked a little, I put a little shredded cheese on the egg before flipping. I like mine with hot sauce and sometimes salsa to dip. My boys LOVED these, and asked for seconds! Thanks for posting this recipe. It's nice to share these recipes I had as a kid with my boys.

We call it egg-in-a-hole, and I have perfected the art!

First, it helps to cook on a low heat and cover with a lid to cook the egg without burning the bread. Also, I sprinkle salt pepper and Season-all on the raw egg side. 

Second, after you flip the bread to cook the other side, sprinkle a little cheddar cheese on the cooked side and cover again and allow cheese to melt while the other side cooks. 

Hope you love the suggestions!

We call this a Nest Egg. Love it! Over easy is best achieved if you add a splash of water (1 or 2 tablespoons) to the pan once you crack the egg and the pan is hot, then cover it. The steam cooks the whites of the egg quickly which makes it easier to turn, and the water cooks off so no soggy bread, and no broken yolks!

We always made these growing up. We called it "Egg in a Basket". I do it a little differently though. I butter both sides of the bread, then cut out the hole. I don't add any additional butter to the skillet because I use a non-stick skillet. I set the stove to medium-low heat. I lay the bread into the skillet and crack the egg into the hole, adding salt and pepper to the top. Wait until the white has set and flip the whole thing over. I also fry up the hole and eat that as well. Why waste it? It tastes delicious.

Delicious! Very easy and great for breakfast! Neat idea to combine your eggs and toast together. I waited until the egg was cooked and added a slice of cheese. Great with a side of Canadian bacon and OJ!

As a mother of 5, I need to cook in bulk.  I make these "Toad in a Hole" as we call them, all the time.  I usually use a loaf of bread and a dozen and a half or so eggs.  I make them all first, keeping them warm, then call the crew to breakfast.  Otherwise, I can't keep up with the demand.  I have also added pre-cooked and crumbled Hormel bacon, I'll take any short cuts I can. Great recipe....one that will live on forever.  FYI...these eggs have even been on the "big screen".  In the movie Moonstruck, Cher's mother in the movie, sorry, her character name escapes me, is making them one morning.  Check it out.

This is one of my favorite ways of eating eggs. Once the white is set on the bottom, I like to flip the toast for about thirty seconds to make my egg over easy. Yum!

This recipe is great with any bread. I made it with rye once, pumpernickel another time... it's a very good recipe to try different things with and very hard to mess up. It's one of my boyfriend's favorite breakfast dishes :)

I've never had these before, and I'm sooo glad that I found this because my son now thinks I'm the Bee's Knees for making these this morning.  Not only are these completely easy, but cute as well.  Robert commented on how "he loved how the egg cooked a little into the toast".  I too carefully flipped them for over easy.  Thanks for opening my eyes Cassie!!

OMG!! I haven't thought about this in 20 yrs. Thank you very much for reminding of this recipe.It was the first thing I learned to cook in my the fourth or fifth grade cooking class. We call it "The Birds Nest" When first married the husband only ate scrambled eggs so his I would scramble his for the center. I served it with real maple syrup... Thanks again for reminding me will be fixing it for my nieces and nephews next time we do breakfast at my house.

I grew up on this but my parents always called it "Egg in a Basket" I now make it for my daughter. We do a few things different though. I butter only one side of the bread before cutting the circle out. I brown the circle as well (its a mini piece of buttered toast) and we sometimes put syrup on the bread before eating it!! anyway its very tasty and my 1 1/2 year old loves it!!!!!!

This was ok.  Not much more to say about it, really.  I ended up flipping to make sure the egg was cooked.  A nice different way to serve eggs & toast.

I had a friend who used to like making this for breakfast. She used to call it "toad in a hole." I like fried eggs and toast, but cooked this way the eggs gets cookied nicely, but the toast always seems kind of hard. It is a good breakfast recipe for kids and teenagers though.

I had used salted butter and with the chesse as an add-on, the added salt was not necessary. Otherwise it was perfect.

This is an amazing recipe. Quick and easy and inexpensive. Kids love it. Here in MN, we call them bulls-eyes. Made them when I was a kid in summer camp. Haven't had them since then until now. Thank you for this.

I learned this recipe in Home Ec. back in the late 1960's.  Love the recipe and the flavor for something different.  Also love the different names you guys are coming up with.  We called them Framed Eggs!

Not the prettiest dish I've made, but it certainly is tasty! And it's convenient for people like me who don't have a toaster. I garnished mine with a big of grated cheddar cheese, Sriracha sauce, and parsley.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I make for the kids in my classroom also. My mom called them Bulls-eyes.  Another option for making these is to omit the butter and spray both sides of the bread and the pan with a cooking oil spray.  You only have to spray the pan once.

I love this! I know it better as "egg in a hole", but there are so many names for this breakfast favorite. I used the cap to my Pam non-stick spray for the hole, and it was the perfect size. I sprinkled the egg with a bit of garlic powder, and red pepper flakes. I then tilted the skillet slightly and slid the toast onto it, then carefully flipped it to cook the other side slightly. It's an acquired skill; I have broken quite a few yolks, but after a while, it becomes second nature. M had never heard of "sunshine toast", but now, this has become his favorite (I melt a slice of spicy jack cheese on his- yum!) .

I have been eating "Toad In A Hole" (as we call it) for 40 years.  The kids love it and they get to make the holes so it's a lot of fun.  I use texas toast and two eggs for my own and the regular sliced bread for theirs.   I have lost count of how many variations I have tried.  Play with this recipe by beating the egg and adding your favorite ingredients like peppers, onions, cheese and even crumbled bacon or sausage.  I call it "omelet toast" and use the texas toast for these types.  Enjoy!

My mom made these for us kids when we were small. She called them "eggs in a frame". Though when I got older and married my husband called them "English Eggs". I guess no matter what you call them and by all the reviews I read I can tell there are many names, but no matter what you call them they are excellent. By the way do not get rid of the middle butter it up too and fry it. It might just be my favorite way to have toast.

I have also dipped the bread as for french toast and then done the toad in the hole too. Another one is to sprinkle garlic poweder on the bread so you have a garlic bread egg!

I made this for supper the other night.  I was able to do six at a time on my griddle.  I cut the holes, buttered them up real good, and seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also added shredded cheese.  My family ate them up!

My family thought this was great. Even my daughter who doesn't like eggs thought it was good. I buttered both sides of the bread, then browned one side turned it over, cut the whole out and put the egg in. I tryed what one reviewer said and added a couple of tbsp. of water in the hot pan and covered, and it cooked the eggs perfect that way without flipping. Next time I will put these on a wire rack for a minute or so because when I put them straight on the plates the bottom got too soggy. We will definitely be eating this again and again. Thanks!!

Easy. Super Fast. Great for Company. A tasty twist on simple eggs and toast. Get your heat right or you"ll burn your toast on one side like I did. But even with the burnt toast it was still AMAZING! With the egg contained you can dip your leftover bread into it without making a mess of your plate! My husband loved it too!

My Dad used to make these for me when I was little, and I make them about once a week, my wife LOVES them. I don't butter the bread though, maybe I'll try that. We still call it the Robert Special as my Dad did, and we drizzle with syrup.

My mom made this for us when I was little and I've made it for my family that are now grown! We called it "egg on an island". The only thing we do different is to put the egg in right away once the bread is in the fry pan. Also save and fry up with the egg the little circle of bread that you cut out. I do try to break up the whites of the egg a little befoe flipping, so that it cooks evenly. Enjoyable and fun to eat. Thanks Cassie!

My mother used to make this for me for breakfast when I was younger. She called it "Egg in a Frame", and I dipped the excess bread slices into the yolk. I no longer like eggs at all, but I have to give this recipe ***** because it reminds me so much of my childhood, a.k.a. "The Good Old Days". :)

Love this idea, as it goes by many names...I was taught it as "The Pirate's Eye".  The different ways people prepare it; with extra butter, without, type of bread, etc... depends on what you have available.

One little twist that I started doing to this is adding some shredded cheese and bacon bits on top. Delicious!

I used to have these when I would visit my great aunt in her retirement home. They called them "Popeyes" there. I have not had them since then, and I came across this recipe yesterday and was reminded of how much I used to like them. This is such a quick and easy breakfast that you can really make for a casual or fancy occasion, depending on what you dress the plate up with. I just made them this morning before my husband left for work and used heart-shaped cookie cutters to make heart shaped holes in the middle for Valentine's Day :)

I can't believe I just tried this for the first time in my life and I have been around for awhile.  I loved the crispiness of the bread and the flavor.  I added the round piece of bread to the pan and served on the side.  You could really get creative with this one.

In England, we call it "A poke in the eye"
Bit of fun for kids if they fold the bread in half first, bite their own 'poke' out of the bread, then drop their own egg into the bread in the pan.
Oh, Marmite goes well here....before the 'eye' (egg).

My dad always made these for me growing up but he called them "Bird's Nest" and they are my favorite breakfast of all times.  My husband has tried to make these for me before but I emphasize TRIED.  I on the other hand am a pro, like father like daughter.

We call it Hen on a Nest. I add the butter to the pan and soak the bread including the piece I cut out in the butter. Then I flip it and soak the other side, crack the egg in the hole and flip after a few minutes. I have also added mushrooms to the egg before flipping and it was delicious. I cooked the mushrooms in butter before adding them to the egg.

This was delicious! I used whole wheat bread and margarine to make it healthier. I also added pepper.

Wow...blast from the past! We called this "Hobo Toast", and my mom made them. I tried them again recently, and it does make a difference to cook on a lower temp and in a non-stick pan. I also used salted butter, so didn't really need extra salt. Tastes really good!

Made these for 150 ranch kids' breakfast about 3 times a month at a boarding school.  We called them Wranglers and after flipping once, topped with a slice of cheese for a bit heartier meal.  They loved them!

I've always called this Toad In A Hole, but either way it's yummy and super easy.  It's not something I make often, and it's always sorta been a non-recipe in my mind it's so easy.

I love this!  I've made it several times now and it always turns out great.  You can use different shaped cookie cutters instead of a circle.  And it's great with a little cheese sprinkled on top!

This was just ok for me. It is cute for kids and I liked the idea of the ketchup face to spice it up and make someone smile (if they like ketchup~no one in my house eats ketchup with their eggs. I flipped the toast after I cracked the egg in the hole, as it just was cooking through and that worked out to cook it a little more. I don't know that I'd use it again.

I had never had anything like this before & really didn't care for it that much.  The bread was more like french toast and I would prefer to just have regular toast with my fried egg.  Not bad, but not a keeper for me.  Just personal preference.

This was great. The times can change on the way people like their toast and how cooked they want their eggs to be. Me personally i like to have my bread to be toasted well but not over done or burnt. I really love to use this when we are tailgating at the football games or early morning camping because of the simplicity of the meal. This is great and quick to make and you can always experiment and try new things. I have some ideas but those ideas are for later on.

This was pretty neat. I gave it 5 stars just for ingenuity. Its also known as a Toad in a Hole, Egg in a Basket, Egg in a Window, and a One Eyed Jack(if you save the cut out piece as an eyepatch).

When I was a kid, we called these "One-Eyed Jacks" and they were our favorite breakfast.  We lightly season with seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  Yum!  My teenagers like to make these for a quick dinner when they are cooking.  Its a good dish to teach kids to cook.

A true childhood favorite.  Mom used to make this all the time, and we LOVED it!  If you're watching your cholesterol, use a little olive oil in the skillet and only use butter on the bread itself.  Also, 1/4 cup egg beaters can be substituted for each egg.  That said, there's really nothing like the real thing.  Kids and grown ups alike will love it.  You really feel nurtured when you are served this dish!

Bullseye Eggs is what my husband calls them, likes them over-easy. I use a heart-shaped cookie cutter then toast the hearts separately so he has extra bread to dip in.

I used large eggs and discovered after making a couple of these it worked better if the egg didn't run over the bread. I also cooked on med low and covered AND turned to get them cooked right. Kids liked them, but not as much as I had hoped.I will make again but use thicker bread, medium eggs for the size cookie cutter I used, and definitely cover from the beginning.

Sure did enjoy this! After a long day at work outside in the woods this was an enjoyable quickie! Took the circles and buttered them up and added some cinnamon/sugar to them with a little syrup. A delightful treat!  So SORRY I didn't take a picture of them!

Simple, delicious and brings back memories! This was the first thing we made in 7th grade Home Ec - and I still love it today!  I use a generous amount of spray butter on the bread instead of melting butter in the pan, and after dropping the egg into the hole I season with just pepper and cover with a saucepan lid to help cook the egg through.  Thanks for reminding me of this wonderful breakfast treat!

My mom made this for me growing up but I had forgotten exactly how she did it. I do remember she always made a happy face on the steamed whole yolk with ketchup.  We love "Eggy-Toast" and I am thrilled to get the exact directions to do it myself the proper way for my own son.  Hurray!  This is definitely a recipe you remember growing up and pass down from generation to generation.

I have been making this for years. We call it Moonstruck eggs cause when watching the movie "Moonstruck" they were cooking it using italian style bread. Such a simple awesome breakfast.

I have made these since I was a kid!  We called them toad-in-the-holes.  They are great.  I usually use a lid to help the egg cook more thoroughly... can't stand eggs that are runny in the middle.

This is one of our all time favorite recipes for breakfast.  I remember making this when I was a girl scout 30 years ago.  You really have to scroll through all the reviews and look at all the unique names families have given to this recipe.  When my niece was a little girl (she's now 22) she named this recipe  "Egg in the eye of Toast" and we've been calling it that ever since! Your kids will love this breakfast, I know my 8 year old son does.

I have been making this for my husband for years.  He loves it.  I like to toast the bread a little bit before adding to the skillet becuase it seems to be crunchier that way.  Plus I saute a couple slices of ham, place on plate and top with a couple of slices of easy melting cheese.  Then top with the egg.  Let it set for a minute to allow the cheese to melt some.

I love this! I've made it a million times before, and it always turns out great. For some reason it seems to have a lot better taste and texture than just a piece of toast dipped into an egg. 
It also benefits my dog, since I don't like being wasteful of the cut-out piece of bread, I always give it to her :P

Excellent! We especially loved the name (so much better than the others we've heard). I made some changes based on other reviews: I fried the potato bread in bacon grease, not butter; I broke the egg into the "hole" immediately after setting the bread in the pan, so that we could turn the bread/egg together later for over-easy eggs. I crumbled bacon into the egg on the first side, and broke up the egg whites a bit to cook through. When I flipped the bread over I sprinkled it with shredded cheese mix, then covered pan with a lid until the cheese melted (around a minute). Perfect for an light, easy, satisfying breakfast. Thanks!!

So simple and tasty, it transports me back to Mom's breakfasts! Much easier than trying to get the eggs and toast to be done at the same time separately.

These were great Cassie.  My boys will not eat the white of the egg and they actually ate the whole thing when made this way.  I flipped over the egg because that is how they prefer them.  Thanks for the great new way to cook an egg!

My dad used to make these for me when I was little.  Butter is good, but bacon grease is better.  After frying bacon, drain off all but enough grease to coat the pan.  Then put the bread in the pan and add the egg.  I like hard egg yolks, so I break the yolk right after adding it.

While I was growing up I hated eggs.  I thought of them as liquid chicken :(  The only ones I could choke down were scrambled and they had to be really cooked...think egg jerky and covered in ketchup.  As I got older I expanded my horizons...softer scrambled, deviled eggs, egg salad and omelets.  Still could not bring myself to eat a soft cooked yoke.  Older still I started to think that fried eggs looked appealing.  This is my very first egg cooked with the softer yoke.  I made it with Ezekiel bread.  And I put a little hot sauce on it.  Oh my goodness.  Where have you been all my life?  Excellent!  Thank you so much!

We called it "Man on a Raft" Our version includes cheese. After the egg is pretty much done you flip it and sprinkle cheese on the other side. Put the lid on for 20-30 seconds and its done. And if you add sprouts on wheat toast that's a "Hippie on an inner-tube" :)

Really good, used to big of a glass so the hole was a little too large. But overall I can't complain, only complaints I have are ones that are specific to me, like using too big a glass. Overall great quick breakfast.

We love these at our house. I butter the entire slice of bread and then cut the hole. I then toast the bread while cooking the egg in the pan and flipping when ready, all while toasting the "hole" as well. We use this for dipping into the soft yellow of the egg. This is so good for lovers of the soft egg.

Have been making fried egg this method for well over 50 years!  My Mom called it "lazy Susan" egg, not sure why.  I also like to flip the egg over once white is set, but do it with care as that beautiful yolk can easily break!  These days I like to use multigrain bread instead of white.  Delicious!

I like to cook one side of the bread then flip, crack the egg
in the whole cook on medium low flip again for sunny side up.
if you don't cook one side first when you flip it the egg prevents
the bread from browning on the other side. so cook flip add egg cook flip again cook for 30 seconds last flip for sunny side up!

We call these 'buck eyes', and do them in the microwave. Just stick a toothpick in the yoke. Often just before they're done we add a slice of cheese and let it melt over the top. They are really good. Hubby often uses salsa, I often use the peach-mango salsa or just plain ketchup.

I have been making this for a long time now and just now saw a recipe for it.  My wife and I simply called it "Egg Toast".  It is very good and very easy.  I like to sprinkle a little bit of dill weed on my egg toast while I'm cooking it.

Yes, we used to have this on the weekend when I was a kid!  We called it egg in a hole too.
For ovenmitt2, another great breakfast recipe for families of 5 or more like me, is Eggs Benedict in the muffin pan!  Toast bread in each cup after spraying with oil, toast in broiler, crack an egg, sprinkle bacon and bake until eggs set.  Then top with Hollandaise that you can make in the microwave!  Its a huge hit.

I love this meal, my mom would make it when I was a kid. When I make it for my son I add two strips of crispy bacon and cheese on top.  Put a lid on the pan for about 30 seconds to melt the cheese! It is an amazing breakfast.......and sometimes we even have it for dinner!

I've been eating these for over 50 years...but we called them eggs in a basket.  The only changes I've made over the years are to use a good natural multi grain bread (from the bakery, preferabley instead of the packaged variety) and to add lots of freshly ground black pepper and sea salt.  My daughter likes to substitute a bit of garlic salt for the sea salt.  In the summer I always serve eggsin a basket with freshly picked tomatoes from my garden. It's the perfect breakfast!

Boy years ago camping in PA we gathered up slate pieces and started an early morning fire. Slate in the coals till hot. Clean and grease slate with a piece of bacon.have to throw that away. People from all over that state park were bringing me their eggs bread and bacon till well after lunch.  Flipped the egg and bread once.  Could get 2-3 before the slate had to go back in the coals for awhile. But we bad several pieces going.  We started the fire the next morning sunday at 5:30 am.   I was 12 years old. I Gadsden it on a tv shoe...

The kida love this.  I also often put a poached egg instead.  It's a little healthier and a little easier for volume cooking since I can poach six+ eggs while toasting the bread in the oven.

This has been made by our daughter, too, but called a "birds nest".  I think she butters both sides of bread first, then removes center and cooks the center circle piece though and can put syrup on like french toast on the side.  Kids love it.

My mom used to make this, and called it Egg in the Nest.  My kids love when I make this!  We swap out the butter for coconut oil.  It has zero cholesterol and healthy fat.  Makes the edges deliciously crispy!

I too like to flip for 30 seconds. Much fun for the grandkids, who get to make the hole. After serving, they get to "pop the sun, and spread the sunshine all around the world."

I ate these while growing up, we called them "hobo eggs." We flipped them after cooking the first side, and fried the "hole" also. I no longer eat eggs, but this brings back memories! Great recipe for kids!

My father-in-law used to call these "Bull's Eye Eggs" and I make them for my husband at least once a week. Funny how many different names people have given it. Delicious. We love it with a little fresh ground pepper.

Very good. A nice quick breakfast or lunch with some protein from the egg to keep you full. I added a slice of cheese to mine after I flipped the egg and bread over, because I love egg and cheese together. Thanks!

This is a classic recipe. We called it "Toad in the Hole" though I now know that that dish actually refers to something else! This is best with a slightly dried-out piece of bread, IMO, and lots of black pepper on top. Thanks for the recipe :)

This is another one of those recipes that I can't imagine why I've never tried it before. I made this for my son this morning and he loved it! It was so simple and a nice change from the ordinary. I tasted it too and thought it was very good and something I would definately make again. So simple and fun! Thanks for sharing. :)

Add a litte sausage or bacon and you have a full breakfast.  It's a fun and different way to eat eggs and toast and my son loved the toast medalions I made with the centers.

This was pretty good...but different too. I could see how another poster said it tasted like french toast...mind did on the bread where the whites were. I did also try it with some cheese on top, not sure if that was better or not. Thanks for the recipe!

This is such a great idea!  The egg cooks in a perfect little circle (which I can never do normally).  So convenient.

My fiance likes his "sunshine toast" on top of another (thin) slice of bread with cheddar & muenster sandwiched in between - like a grilled cheese with a runny egg on top.  I use smart balance on the bread, season the egg with oregano, salt and pepper & recommend using a lid/cover to cook the egg quickly & evenly.  This is remarkably creative & not to mention, sooo delicious!

I grew up on this and I still make this for my kids.  I knew it as "Gold Mine Egg".  I make it for my kids with the eggs intact, but I am not crazy about the yolk, even when it is set solid, so I just make mine with egg whites.  Delish!  Reading through all the reviews made me laugh because there are so many different names for one dish!  My kids call it either Gold Mine Egg (like I do) or Toad in the Hole or even Bird in the Nest.  You have to cook up the circle cut out... my brothers and I used to fight over those pieces because they just tasted so good all crispy toasted and buttery.  Thanks for the memories of a classic breakfast dish (but really good at any time of day or night!)!

Super simple and yummy! I buttered and salted both sides of the bread and cooked until golden on both sides. I then used a glass to cut a hole in each slice of toast. I sprinkled a little salt in each hole, right onto the pan, and then cracked the eggs right in. Cooked until the bottom was no longer see through, and then flipped and cooked for 30 seconds for over easy. I served the Sunshine Toast with the small cut out circles of toast. Delicious! I highly recommend this easy recipe for a twist on eggs and toast.

Very good! Certainly does not need any salt,  but I add a little pepper. Tends to be very messy, but I think that's just my problem. Makes a nice breakfast.

Good!  Need to keep the inside of the toast to dip in the yolk :)  Also, use good bread...I used light bread and it was too thin.

Wonderful, not to mention cute, recipe! 
I've made it twice now. The first time, I made it with spray on oil instead of butter, and sprinkled on a little salt and pepper, and was just slightly bland. The second time, I buttered the bread, as the recipe called for, and sprinkled some monterey jack cheese on top, which made it absolutely delicious and flavorful. 
I also buttered out the circular cut-out of the bread and fried it up. 
Overall, I recommend preparing it with BUTTER. It really does the trick and makes the bread just perfectly toasted.

This is a really neat recipe that the kids and I loved!  I followed someones advice of using a pot lid to cook it more thoroughly.  We don't like runny. :(  It tastes delicious with a little drizzle of syrup.

This tickles me! I learned how to make this in my very first home ec class in 1966, only we called it "Toad in the Hole". This is the very first dish I taught my son to make and now have taught each of my grandchildren to make. We prefer it with white bread!

I love how everyone has their own memories of this dish and their own name.  My dad made these for us when we were kids, I made them for my kids and now am making them for my little grandsons.  They love them....and for something silly, I started calling them "an egg in a hole with a blanket".  I also cook the little "blanket" and enjoy it, too.

My Aunt used to make these and I loved them!  I tried to make these on my own based on what I remembered and they turned out bad.  Thanks for posting this recipe!  Now I can pass this down to my kids.  They loved having the egg in the toast.  I also buttered the bread and then cut the hole with a glass.  I cooked the circle I cut out and placed it on top of the sunshine toast - made it more filling for my growing boys!

My favorite variation is to cook my bacon first and then fry the bread/egg in the bacon grease (leave out the butter)...declicious, although not very heart healthy.

I cooked the bread and egg at low heat and covered it with a lid. I also sprinkled seasoning salt on the egg. As suggested by a reviewer, I sprinkled some grated cheddar cheese on the cooked side and covered it to allow the cheese to melt while the other side cooks. 
I didn't find anything special about this recipe, tasted just like a plain egg and toast, but my boyfriend liked it.

Several years ago, a friend of mine made "eggs in a hole" and I wanted to cook them for my four year old.  I found this recipe and it was a huge success. 
I fried the leftover pieces and called them moon toast, which we put jelly on.  To please my fiancé (who loves meat), I sautéed ham, melted cheese over it, and topped with diced tomatoes which I served on the side.
All in all, this celestial breakfast was great and I will surely cook it again!

In one of my cookbooks, this is called a "Camel's Eye!"  Isn't it funny how so many people have different names for the same thing?  Guess what I'm having for breakfast tomorrow? ;)

I've been fixing a variation this for a long time; it is one of my favorite breakfast recipes.  The only difference is that I toast the bread seperately and place the egg on top.  I find a dash or Paprika and Oregano a nice compliment as well.

I had never tried this before, had heard other people talk about making it though. I was tired of the same old stuff for weekend breakfasts and since it looked kid friendly, decided to try it. My kids and husband loved it. We've made it 2 days in a row. The kids cut out the circles, and brushed the bread with melted butter. I cracked the egg in it as soon as I put it in the pan, used a nonstick pan, so I added no butter to the pan. It fried perfectly. Toast was crisp, and egg was just right. We fried the circles for dipping. My husband put cheese on his, and declared it great.

Absolutely delicious! I wanted to make this a long time ago when I saw it in "V or Vedetta". I was so surprised when I found this recipe on AllRecipes.com! I thought it would be difficult to make, but it was actually quite easy and it tasted very good :)

I had this for the first time when my husband made it for me after we were married.  His family made it all the time.  They called it a One-Eye Egg.  My husband would probably give it a 5 but I prefer my toast seperate from the egg.

what a delicious and easy way to "dress up" fried eggs.  i used panera french bread and sprinkled each serving with salt, black pepper, and paprika.  my whole family loved them and asked for seconds.  try this recipe and you won't be sorry!!!

My mom used to make this also and called it "toad in a hole".  I make it all the time for my husband and children.  They love them.  I add pepper along with the salt and instead of using the butter type suggested in the recipe I use sprayable butter to coat both sides of the bread after the hole is made in the center.  It is much easier and doesn't result in torn bread.  Modern technology is soo great!  My son likes to add shredded cheddar cheese to his egg toast.

This was a great way to get my kids to eat eggs and love them!!  The name 'sunshine toast' got them hooked!  They ask for it all the time.  Thanks for a great alternative to the boring egg!

My toaster was broken so it was a great way to toast the bread with the egg.  My first one was way too buttery but the second one I made was great.  I've never tried this before.  It's a cute idea.  Thanks for submitting.

Thanks for posting a blast from the past! I remember making these in 7th grade Home Ec class at my middle school. You have no idea how bad it was to smell 20 of us burning this the first time, we eventually got it right!

We use to call this recipe 'Egg in a Frame'.  Very simple and fun...children love this idea.  I use to break the yolk and fry it,  so it was an egg and toast on the go.

LOVE this recipe. Used to have these as a kid, mom called them "egg in a nest".  You must fry up the hole of bread in butter also and eat with the rest. Also great if you crumble up bacon or sausage and est with too.

This is a great way to fix eggs especially for kids and it's even better using a slice of banana-nut bread. Do flip it for over-easy just to ensure the white is cooked properly.

I've been making these forever.  We call them "egg in a hole."  But we cut the hole, drop in the egg, cook that side, then flip over and lightly fry on the other side, so egg is cooked on both sides (sunny-side up!).  The yolk stays soft.

The simplest breakfast you can imagine, and so quick to make that finding time to cook it in the mornings is easy! I like to fry mine on both sides so that the egg is cooked over the yolk on both the top and bottom, so that when I cut into it, the explosion of yolk is a surprise.

I have been making this recipe for.as long as I can remember with my son. However, it was called Hotel Toast! It is a wonderful way to make a child happy in the morning. You can even use shaped cookie cutters for a fun touch. I still make this for my son who is now 39 years old. What a great recipe. I like the use of the cookie cutter for a nice touch, however larger eggs will spill over & won't for in the holding it is too small, so make certain you use larger slices of bread so the egg fits!

Made these all the time for kids.  When I first saw them they were called "Gasy Eggs".  From what I understood, years ago they were made at some Gas Stations for customers who wanted a "To Go" Breakfast.  Kids love to ask for "Gasy Eggs".
It always makes them laugh!

Very good however, this is not a new twist I have been making this since 1964. This is called"ONE-EYED TOAST"! MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME HOW TO FIX IT AND HER MOTHER TAUGHT HER.

This is pretty easy to make. Just remember to watch your skillet so it doesn't get too hot and burn your toast.

This was a fun recipe to make. I surprised the kids this morning with these, and they were like "why is there an egg in the middle of my toast?" Hah! Because there can be! I buttered my griddle, then laid the bread down and immediately cracked the egg into the hole. I knew I wanted to flip it half way, and this way the bread toasted at the same time as the egg started to set. Flipped and cooked until the egg was "over easy". Perfect!

This is a great breakfast. I thought 2 T butter was a bit much--I only used probably close to 2 tsp. The instructions for this were easy to follow. The only thing I added was flipping the whole thing so that the egg was over medium.

We also made these when I was a kid and called them 'gas house eggs'.  

I don't usually butter the bread at all. instead, I heat the pan, cut the hole in the bread, put the bread in the pan and drop the butter into the hole. As soon as it melts, it's time to crack the egg into the  hole.  As someone else noted, I do cover the pan while the egg cooks on the first side - before the flip.

My grandmother in Brooklyn made this for us in the 60's and called it Hollywood Eggs. I make them for my family now. I use a shot glass so just the yoke is in the hole. I also cover the pan with a lid. However, I did not fry the one side of the bread before adding the egg. That will make them all the better! Thanks, All Recipes community!

Here's an easier version.  While you are frying an egg - make toast and butter it.  Put cooked egg on top.  Done!

Loved this recipe, I didn't have any meat available for breakfast so i wanted to just use eggs and toast, then i remembered this from the movie V for Vendetta, he called it eggy in a basket, and it was just as delicious as she said it was lol. I how ever went ahead and buttered both sides and then only put the bread in for a few min before i put in the egg, i also cooked my eggs until done. I also added Mozzarella to it instead of cheddar, much better.

Raised on it as a youngster. It was affectionately called "S..t on a Shingle"...you know bird on roof shingle! Anyway, it was fun to eat! I fed my son that for breakfast as he sat in the car on our way to school 20 miles away. He always ate it on test days and did remarkably well!

I always had this made for me when I was little. We called it eggs by the window. The only difference was sometimes. Cheese on the egg and pepper. And we usually just pinched a hole in our bread so it was never to big or to small.

We call this "Egg in a Nest". It's been a favorite of our family, as well as my husband's family while he was growing up. I'm not at all careful about cutting a perfect circle out of the bread. Sometimes I cut it using a knife, and other times just rip a bit out of the center. It all works out, it gets covered by the egg anyway. Additionally, I've always added the egg right away, I don't wait until the bread is flipped to the second side. Otherwise, I don't think the egg would have time to cook without burning. However you do this, it's a nice alternative to a plain fried egg.

My mother made nest eggs for me as a child and I made them for my children. Now, my children make them for their children. Guess you could say nest eggs are a family tradition.

We used to make this camping when I was a Boy Scout. We called it Rocky Mountain toast. As with all food you make camping it was much tastier than eating it at home

I'm 63 yrs old, and my mother and both of my grandmothers used to make "Toad in the Hole" for us as we grew up, so of course, I made them for my children, and they are now making them for my grandchildren! Along with some bacon or sausage, it's a great breakfast or lunch!!

I made this for my kids frequently, when they were growing up. They often requested it   Some make it for their kids now.  The "Sunshine Eggs" ensured a happy day! 
 I sent them this recipe for nostalgia sake, and they remember it well.  I think they will be serving it to my great-grandkids soon.  :-)

One of my favorite breakfasts.  We called them "monkey eyes."  Don't forget to butter and cook the bread you cut out; kids love that part, too.

My Daddy called this "Egg in a Frame" and it was something we both loved to make.  I've passed this one down to my grandkids, and they love it too.  I follow this recipe pretty much the same, except I butter both sides of the bread before I start cooking and I also butter and fry the "hole" -- that's always been my favorite part!

I then added a piece of cheese to the first side done and finished cooking as a grilled cheese sandwich.

I make "Egg-in-a-Nest" for my son every day.  He loves it.  I make it on medium heat (actually just a tad higher than medium) to toast bread - while leaving egg a little runny.  He likes to dip the toast in the runny part.  I usually butter one side of the bread before I put it in the hot pan -- as well as the "hole" punch out.  While I typically use my fingers to push out the center hole, cookie cutters are fun, too.

LOVE!! My friends dad used to make these for us on school mornings and I thought he was the best dad ever. They are supper easy and fun for kids. I sometimes use different shaped cookie cutters and the kids love it. I also toast up the extra piece of bread for dipping in the yolk...YUM.

We called it "Egg Toast" don't be fooled at thinking this is not something special!  Something really unique tasting about it.  Not the same as dipping your egg in the yolk.  Don't know why but it is definately worth doing!

I have been eating this for about 65 years. Our family calls it "Gas House Egg". Also, we only use 1 teaspoon per side thus reducing fats and calories.

Classic, simple breakfast. It's interesting how many different names this is known by.  I grew up calling it a "Tramp Sandwich" (my Grandmother used to make these for me, and that's what she called it.) "Hobo Toast" is another one I've heard.

Although I know this dish as "Egg in a Hole," it's a terrific breakfast staple.  So long as you have the time and patience to make it, that is...  It's tricky choreographing enough for a whole family while keeping the yolks runny (and the yolks must be runny!)  Oh, and the "holes"--buttered and cooked alongside the eggs--are the best part!

We called it "Bunny in a hole" when I was little and my Grandmother made this for us.  It was one of my most favorite and fun breakfasts!

Been making this for years.  Cook on low heat if you want the egg done all the way through.  I enjoy it now and then.  I also "fry" the part of the bread I cut out.  Don't waste it!

My dad used to make these when I was a kid.  He said he learned how to make them by watching a Shirley Temple move, and called them "One-Eyed Sandwiches."  I always loved them, especially the center of the bread, which he would grill and serve also.

I have been making this for my son for a few years now.  I've found it tastes better when I use Texas Toast (sold in my grocery store bread aisle).  My sister in NC can't get Texas Toast at all, so it depends where you live.  When we have "Breakfast for Dinner" night, this is what my son always wants!

My grandma used to make this recipe for my grandpa all the time. She has been gone for about 14 years now and I completely forgot about this fun way to eat eggs and toast. I'm always looking for interesting breakfast ideas. Thank-you for reminding me of the egg in a hole!

I loved this as a kid and so today I went back to childhood.  The only thing we do different is put the bread crack the egg, then flip to cook the other side of the bread with the egg.  If do this on Medium you should not burn the bread to egg.  Thanks for bringing back memories.  I ate them all the time before school.

Although i really enjoy making this i (like most others) make some changes to it.
first i saute some butter and mustard in the skillet, lightly fry both sides of the bread in this before cracking the egg into the middle, then i flip it over once the white has set. In another small skillet i chop 1 medium sized mushroom, and fry it in butter and garlic, serve with the mushrooms on top.

This is a wonderful recipe. My grandfather would make it all the time, we called it "Egg on a raft". If you would like to try this recipe a different way, replace seasonings with nutmeg and cinnamon.
When the dish is done, drizzle with syrup. My children love it!

I had to flip it with the egg, my toast was starting to burn before my egg was done.  I'll try it on a low heat next time.

Yumm. We call this egg in a bread. This was my boyfriends favorite growing up and after 8 years together i finally made it today. After the first flip i put shredded cheddar cheese on top. Then covered the pan. I served with taylor ham. YUM!

Great, easy recipe!  Nice recipe to teach a kid who is learning to cook!  My daughter, 14, calls these "Mole in the Hole", and learned this recipe when she was 10 from her Nana.

It's funny reading all the different names for these, over in Britain, where I am from originally, we call these "Toad in the Hole".  No matter what name you call them, it's a fun, easy breakfast to make.

I love this. The only kind of egg i could make before was scrambled since it was so hard to flip it without messing it up but since it's in the bread it's easier to flip and keep in one spot on the pan! I made the best eggs i've ever made. Also, it tasted delisous too and was perfectly cooked! 0:)

I really like this. Very quick and easy. The last time I made it, instead of just buttering the bread, I dipped it into french toast batter, and then fried the egg in it, and covered in syrup when it was done!! YUM-O! Also, try using Texas Toast, works better than regular bread!

I make this for my Husband every Saturday Morning.  I usually add pepper before the egg is cooked all the way and leave the yolk a little runny so he can sop it up with the toast.  

I usually also melt a piece of cheese on top.  He is particular to Muenster or Pepper Jack.

I've always called them "eggies in a basket" but I love the name "Sunshine Toast"!

Yum! My busy single-mom-of-three-kids-under-10 used to  make these for us on rare mornings when we had more than 20 minutes to spare. I'd forgotten about Mom's "Hobo eggs" for years! I usually make these with whole grain wheat bread. If we're making bacon too, I'll drain most of it off and use a wee bit in the pan to give these even more flavor. Love all the suggestions everyone has given to change my Hobo eggs up! THANKS!

This is a cute idea and easy to execute. I poured maple syrup on mine for a twist on french toast. Would definitely make it for kids (if I had them!).

My mom taught me this recipe when she first started teaching me to cook and I have been making it ever since.  We call them framed eggs and I have taught my daughter how to make them as well.  She loves them.

My teacher in 2nd grade taught us this recipe except hers was slightly different.  Since we were younger she taught us how to do it in the microwave.  I always keep the cut bread and dip it in the yolk.  As pp mentioned, why waste it.

These are fast, easy, and fun for kids.  The cut out hole is great for dipping into the yolk.  I like to use all kinds of cookie cutters for these, hearts for Valentine's Day, tree for Xmas, shapes for preschoolers, etc.

I knew this recipe as "Rocky Mountain Toast". I actually saw it on one of my daughter's favorite TV shows, Breakfast with Bear. And was like, that sounds delicious. So, I made it right away. My daughter and I both loved it. Next time I might add a few spices to liven it up. Probably some cinnamon, since I love cinnamom scrambled eggs.

This was easy and great.  It amazing how much they can charge for this in diners; its just a piece of bread and an egg, haha.  My boyfriend made this for me, and he says that it was amazing because he is such a good cook; I'm sure that is the reason I loved it.

After reading the reviews I felt left out. I never heard of anything like this, and I love eggs. I tried and liked it. I used an english muffin.

I love this recipe - quick, easy, and very tasty!  You can even use a different shape cookie cutter (I used a heart-shaped one for our anniversary) for a nice touch.

I like to make this for my hubby once in awhile on the weekends when I don't feel like making a huge breakfast. Easy and tasty. You can add other spices to it as well for some extra punch.

we love these.  We call them egg in a hole!  Sometimes if we have crumbled bacon or sausage we put some in the hole after the egg and flip it.  Sometimes we add cheese and flip it and if is great! It gets crunchy.
