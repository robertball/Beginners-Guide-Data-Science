Used 2 real eggs instead of egg substitute. Great recipe! Most pumpkin pie type recipes call for condensed milk. All condensed milk I know of contain the ingredient Carageenan in them & we have severe issues mentally we can directly link to Carageenan & also Annatto, and MSG (Google hidden MSG,too). Sweetened condensed milk has it in it, too. Google search Cornucopia Institute & Carageenen in foods and you'll see products they know of that have it in it & alternate products that don't have any to help you get started. (But no condensed or sweetened condensed milk.) It's one of the most inflammatory ingredients out there & it's in grocery store items, but also rampant in health food stores. Labs give it to animals to put them into a highly inflammatory state in their bowels so they can do studies on them. No other ingredient puts their lab animals into such a highly inflammatory state so quickly than Carageenen does. Cut it out and see what happens in your house. After seeing the affects in my family, making the connections, removing it & seeing the difference mentally / emotionally for us I consider it like poison. Anyway this recipe tastes great!

I used whole milk and 2 eggs.  This was great.  Didn't even miss the crust.  I ate it on bread with peanut butter.

Wow!  Satisfies that pumpkin pie craving without all the sugar and calories.  Has more flavor than you would expect from the ingredients - tastes like cloves even though that's not in there.  It is hard to serve up as a pie piece even after one day in fridge.  Worked better the second time in individual serving ramekins. This recipe is so easy.

easy to prepare.  used stevia as sweetener for my family.  used baking spray in individual pyrex and upended them onto the service plates.  a bit of whipped cream and a sprinkle of spice made it pretty and nobody even considered that it didn't have a crust.  one diabetic husband, 2 dieting adult daughters all enjoyed it.

i wasn't too thrilled with this, but mostly bc of the artificial taste.. to give the recipe credit,  it *did* taste better the next day and bf said he liked it.. i think if i were to try this again i'd do half sugar and half sweetener

This was okay, but more like a custard than a crustless pie(which I think of as having somewhat of a self-crusting property). It was a nice custard, but not very easy to get out of the pan nicely.  I think the spices could use a little tweaking, maybe a little more cinnamon and a touch of cloves. I did use whole milk, real sugar, and real eggs. I will make this again, but will probably tweak it to fit my preferences. Thanks for posting a nice basic recipe.

A custard pie without a crust is, wait for it... just custard.

This was really good! I changed out 1/2 of the milk for almond milk. I used 4 eggs, rather than the egg substitute. I also used Monk Fruits instead of the Splenda. I put 1 cup of Monkfruit. I put 1 cup of Monkfruit in, but it was a little too sweet. Next time I'll use 3/4 of a cup. I baked the pie for an additional 20 minutes.  really like the recipe. It had the consistency of a thick custard. I thought I'd try it before Thanksgiving. I will definitely be doing this again for Thanksgiving.

I will definitely make it again.  The only change I would make is decrease the amount of splenda.  Next time I will make it in individual ramekins and perhaps bake it in a water bath.  Really tasty for a dessert or a vegetable for those of us that do not eat flour or sugar.

GREAT Sugar Free recipe !!!  Didn't tell my grandson or son that this was sugar free and they LOVED it. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and used eggs and whole milk.   I also  added a few extra drops of vanilla because my family loves the taste.
Next time I will try in custard cups because it did not come out of the pan like a pie.
