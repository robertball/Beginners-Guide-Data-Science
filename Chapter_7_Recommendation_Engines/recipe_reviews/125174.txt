Delicious and very easy to make. I didn't have a small cupcake pan, so I used the larger ones instead. I doubled the recipe, and everything came out just perfect!

I am rating the filling for this recipe as I didn't use the shell part.  I took someone else's suggestion and used a pie crust.  I had ready made pie crust in the fridge already so I used a glass and cut circles out and formed them into the mini muffin pan and then added the filling.  I have tried other crust recipes for these type of tarts and I have yet to find a good one that doesn't bulk up too much, so the pie crust worked out well.  The filling was super tasty.

Great tasting recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  It baked up quickly and came out of the pan so easily.

My friend's mother used to make these at Christmas and I loved them! I gave these a try and they were so easy.  I substituted walnuts for the pecans and topped them of with confectioners sugar. Way too good just to have at the holidays!

These were exquisite, not to mention adorable!  They look like mini-pecan pies, but have a uniquely wonderful flavor.  My only (minor) issue is that the tops came out looking dried out, which makes them somewhat less appealing.  I'm not wild about maraschino cherries, which would disguise that a bit, so I brushed some vanilla glaze on the tops, which helped a lot.  A dollop of whipped cream might be even better!  Can't wait to make these again!

These were so good! I made them in a standard size muffin tin, as I didn't have the mini one. They were a hit for Thanksgiving! The crust was buttery and flaky, and the filling was waaaay better than the traditional pie made with corn syrup! It was like a warm, gooey little treat inside. Also props for the crust being so pliable and not crumbling when I took them out of the tins (it was super easy).

They are really yummy! Can be made by making biscuit size rounds of pie dough, for an even quicker dessert.

These were very cute and very good! I add cool whip to the top - Yummy!  My husband loved them.  They taste like little pecan pies but better because they're not quite as sweet.

I have been making these for more than 40 years - they are a hit everytime - however, there is no need for salt in the crust and, why would you grease the tins? - the butter and cream cheese take care of that - mine always pop right out.  I, also, prefer them to pecan pie - if I get too tired shaping the muffins,  I just spread the remaining crust dough in a pie pan and add the filling.

These were a huge hit with the adults this Thanksgiving!  I'll be making these again, only this time, I won't fill them as much.  They bubbled over when baking, so I'd probably fill them 2/3 of the way.

Such a great recipe--very similar to the one I had been making for a while but lost.  This has all the same ingredients, but as a traditional pecan pie lover, I don't think the cherries are needed at all.  If you are running super short on time, using a biscuit cutter to cut out refrigerated/pre-made pie crust will go over just as well--only the chef will be able to tell the difference!  And this is such a good recipe for holidays, especially Thanksgiving.  I always hate to discriminate against pumpkin or pecan pie, so these give me a chance to have both without being miserable afterward.  Plus, they are great for when everyone gets the munchies a few afters after dinner but don't want a full meal or dessert.

Luckily I could not find my pecan tart recipe that I made for years. Desperately, I came to my standby website.  I cannot even explain how delicious these are easier to make  than my old recipe.  I had all my ingredients ready, except I missed the important part, the pecans. I thought I had them, but they were walnuts.  I decided, what the heck, I will use these. The walnuts were an excellent alternative. Make them again? You betcha.  I will make these with walnuts or pecans. This recipe had a better way of mixing the nuts with the filling  before putting it in the cups.  This is an excellent recipe and I suggest you make multiple recipes and freeze. Thanks Jean.

I doubled the recipe and used one 8oz block of Cream Cheese and did not do cherries on the top. I had just the right amount of filling for the number of tarts that the crust made, but I also filled them to the tippy top! Will definitely add to the Christmas cookie recipes, as my hubby wont stop raving about these. They also froze very well.

These were soooo good!  They were really easy to make and came out looking so cute.  Everyone raved.  I only got 18 mini tarts out of it and they were such a hit that next time I will definitely be doubling the recipe.  I also omitted the cherry because I am not a fan.  Definitely serve them warm with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream!

YUM!   My boyfriend (being from Texas) has had the best of the best as far as pecan pies go.  Having never made pecan pie or tarts before  I was a nervous wreck but he LOVED them and as others have stated, you can't eat just one!  They are moist and delicious!  My only problem was the filling overflowed into my oven and you practically needed a chisel to get it off.  Any suggestions?

incredible! Everyone loved these :D They were not too sweet and the brown sugary taste was not over powering like it may be in a big slice of pecan pie. I will definitely be making these again. They were quick, and I used a regular sized muffin tin since I didn't have a mini one. I came out with about 12 using that tin.

My grandma made these with her mom when she was young. That was before Taste of Home existed! It's the exact recipe too!!  I want to let people know that if you measure out your balls exactly to two teaspoons (I have a little cookie ball scooper that measures that exactly) you will have no leftover fillng! It will be perfect. Maybe a tiny bit leftover, but nothing worth fussing over. I love these and make them every Christmas and they get devoured!

I made these to bring to a friend's house for Thanksgiving.  They were fairly easy to make, and pretty sturdy to transport.  I stirred the dough to mix it as much as I could, then I kneaded it instead of getting the mixer out for such a small quantity.  For the pecans, I made 1 lb. of glazed pecans using another recipe on this website, and chopped some of them to use in the filling and had leftover pecans to enjoy.  I also placed a glazed pecan on top of each tart rather than a maraschino cherry.

Used my Pampered Chef mini muffin pan, sprayed generously with PAM.  These buttery little gems are a hit every time I make them!

Pecans aren't really common here in Austria, so i used walnuts instead - they were fantastic!

Recipe didn't even need to be tweaked.  Made these for a Christmas party and they were devoured, people raved and rated them a 10.  Excellent recipe.

I was put in charge of deserts for Thanksgiving this year. I was way ahead of the game and finished all of my dishes the night before (tonight). My pecan tarts are already a hit! I have to make another dreaded trip to the grocery store for more pecans because my tarts have mysteriously disappeared!

A real keeper! I have been wanting to do a pecan tart but a friend wouldn't share her recipe that my hubby really likes. So I tried this without changing anything and my hubby said "it's even better than hers". A great holiday gift to friends. Thanks for sharing!

These are WONDERFUL!  The crust is a little time consuming, but the tarts are worth the effort.  This will be a recipe that I make routinely because it is such a wonderful dessert that can be made ahead of time.  My husband doesn't even like pecan pie, but he absolutely loved these!

Made this for Thanksgiving multifamily get together and everyone just loooved them! they didnt have the super gooeyness of a traditional pecan pie, but all the flavor which made it even better to me! One thing I did differently was to not add the pecans to the mixture before pouring- instead I scooped a small amt of pecans in each shell then poured the mix over it. Absolutely wonderful! Thanks

The taste of this crust is amazing but it is very tedious to work with. It was a little sticky and found it a little difficult to form into the mini muffin pan. It was worth the hastle I may trying to add a little more flour next time. Very tasty treat!!!!

These pecan tarts were great.  They are like little pecan pies, but better.  I followed the recipe exactly except I baked them in mini tart pans.   They also went great with my husband's home brewed espresso stout!  If you like good beer, pick up an espresso stout and have a impromptu beer/food paring.

My mini muffin pan is in storage (in process of moving) so I made these in a regular size muffin tin.  The yield was 12.  These were SO yummy!  I will definitely make them again and next time I'll also double the recipe. :)

These are better to me than pecan pie.  I think the reason is that the crust is not sweet a all which nicely compliments the sweetness of the filling.

The pecan tarts were tasty. They would go very well with coffee. The outer crust was a little dry. I would recommend when "pressing into the bottom and up the sides" of the mini-muffin tray make sure to make the crust as thin as possible to cut down on the "dryness". Also, instead of greasing a mini-muffin tray, I recommend using paper mini-muffin baking cups (1 3/4 in.). No grease or PAM spray necessary!

Great base for recipe, if your using muffin tins instead of mini's it will make enough dough for 6 tarts, i also over cooked them a little as they were done about 6-7 mins before the timer went off but really easy and definitely at least 4 stars!

While these TASTE good, I didn't have success with getting them out of the muffin pan very well, so they don't look very nice. However, I will most likely try this again for the holiday season!

These are fabulous!  Perfect combination of rich crust and sweet filling.  Dust the tops with some powdered sugar to make them extra pretty.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

fantastic!!! The cream cheese pastry makes this seemingly sweet dessert not so sweet! I made the pastry early and it lasted a couple days in my fridge. A definite must!

Delish! For those who had too much filling for the the crusts, maybe they used shallower mini tart pans rather than mini muffin pans. The Wilton mini muffin pan (3/4" deep cups) worked perfectly with this recipe.

I definately should have made more dough or decreased the mix because I had quite a bit leftover.  I alsp left off the cherries.  I would make this recipe again.

these are really good. the only thing I had to adjust was the baking time... at 325 it took 35 minutes for the crust to get even somewhat light brown...will make more for Christmas get together....

All I can say is YUMMY!  I have never made pecan tarts before and these came out wonderful.  I actually doubled the recipe and should have quadrupled it!!  The filling does make a lot. I probably could've gotten away with making the single filling recipe for the double batch!  Thanks so much for sharing....these will definitely be on my Christmas cookie trays for years to come!!!

I am actually rating the filling on this recipe, since I used phyllo shells to put it in. SO easy and SO yummy! I have tried them with both pecans and walnuts and both are amazing. They are like mini pecan pies, but even better!

Very tasty and overall a good recipe, but I had 2 problems:  1. The recipe makes more than twice as much filling as is really needed  2. The filling rose up a lot and then left the tarts hollow in the middle.  I think maybe I beat the eggs too much and should have just gently mixed them in.

I used my regular pastry recipe, but the filling alone is worth every star. Deceptively simple - no maple syrup or caramel sauce like some other recipes, nothing expensive, just brown sugar bound together with moisture and pecans! Melt-in-your-mouth delicious, warm or room temperature. I used patty pans and skipped the maraschinos.

I could not find my mothers pecan tart recipe, so I was pleased to find this one. It is the same recipe, except that I ground the pecans and sprinkled powered sugar on top instead of the cherries.

The recipe is enough for 6 large cupcakes. Slowly add flour when mixing butter and creamcheese. Might turn out that you need less butter. They were ok. DOUBLE the filling, so it will be enough for 6 cupcakes. 10/16/15

These are very good and very easy to make, as well!  I do wish I would have topped mine with either the optional cherry or a pecan or something, as it would have improved their appearance.  I got 24 tarts out of this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

These are addictive! Can't eat just one. I also used the crust recipe and filled with a fresh cherry filling that I made on the stove and thickened with corn starch to make mini cherry pies & baked 25 minutes. Could fill the crusts with any thicken fruit.

So far these have turned out very yummy...A little different from regular tarts.  I found the dough to be sticky so just added a little more flour.  Took a lot longer than I had expected to make too.  I also used my regular muffin pans and doubled the recipe. I never seem how have vanilla, so subbed with amaretto.  Waiting on the second batch to cool to see how they turn out, as I put raisins in these ones.  Will definitely make again.
