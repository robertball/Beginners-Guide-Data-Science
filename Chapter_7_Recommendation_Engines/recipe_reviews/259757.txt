Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I think the chicken benefited more  from the marinade than the veggies. If I were to make this again I'd use all of the marinade on the chicken or either double it and use a full batch on the meat and a full batch on the veggies. The chicken was very flavorful and super tender. I do prefer more of a char on my fajitas and would grill next time. Overall a good recipe and one that could easily be changed up to suit your preference.

Did recipe almost exactly but use canned dices jalapenos instead of fresh, grilled chicken and vegetables on the gas grill. It turned out fabulous! Will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe.
