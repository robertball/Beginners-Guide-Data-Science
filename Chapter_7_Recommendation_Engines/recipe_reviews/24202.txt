Very good.  Every  bit as good as what Ive purchased in Irish restaurants.  I made a few crutial changes to this recipe in order to arrive at perfection:  add 1/4 cup of worstershire to the ground beef mixture before cooking.  Without this, the meat is too bland.  Also, add a packet of brown gravy mix to 1 cup of water (instead of 3/4 c. beef broth) and stir into the browned and floured meat mix to simmer for 5 min.  This gives the meat a little bit of gravy, which the mashed potatos love!  Finally, instead of 5 carrots, I add 8-10 oz. of frozen peas and carrots right on top of the meat mix and before the mashed potatos. It tasts great and adds color to the dish.  This recipe is going in the favorites file.  ***** stars for flavor and presentation!

OK, I have FINALLY perfected (at least for us) this recipe.  I brown usually around 1 - 1.5 lbs of ground beef.  I try and get something lean.  Add two tablespoons of flour and mix it in.  Then add two tablespoons of ketchup, 1/4 cup of worcheshire sauce, a packet of brown gravy and one cup of water.  When it starts to thicken I add about a cup and a half of mixed veggies (corn, green beans, carrots, and peas).  Simmer until thickened.  Put in a 2 quart casserole dish cover with mashed potatoes and whatever else you like (I add slivers of butter to the potatoes) and bake at 375 for 20 minutes.  FANTASTIC!!!!!

I made a lot of shepherd's Pie and this is my favortie.
TIME SAVING HINT: to make preparation even faster and easier use instant mashed potatoes for the topping ... although I much prefer fresh mashed potato. If you don't have beef broth use brown gravy mix with one cup water, but honetly, the broth is good too. If making for only adults I will also sometimes add a little HP sauce to the meat mix ... this gives it a bit of "zing". I NEVER add worcestershire sauce...blechh, gross..it has anchovy paste in it!!!
   Also, although the carrots are very nice, you could use frozen corn and or peas instead of carrot (my kids prefer). But if making for adults, I find they tend to prefer the mashed carrot over the peas and corn, myself included. After my husband tasted the one I made with carrot he said "That's the best cottage pie I've ever tasted!!! And he's English! There is something very comforting about the combo of carrots and potato.
   Great idea to mix in cheese and onion to the potatoes. 
(PRESENTATION HINT:I always top my shepherd's pie with a sprinkling of paprika - nice little touch for taste and appearance).

My hubby always asks his mom to bake her famous Shepherd's Pie when we go to visit.  I have never made it for fear that it would not be as good as hers and he wouldn't want to eat it.  This recipe was fantastic, and everyone gobbled three helpings!  I followed some of the other suggestions here and cooked potatoes and carrots together in the same pot. I mashed the potatoes with 8oz sour cream and salt/pepper.  I used green onion in the mashed potatoes.  I saut√©ed 2 pressed cloves of fresh garlic in butter with the onions to use in the meat mixture.  I cooked the meat mixture with 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and added seasoned salt to taste.  I bumped up the ketchup to 1/4 cup, but I think half that (2 tablespoons) would have been fine.  I used 1 packet of brown gravy mix with 1 cup water instead of the beef broth as suggested.  And I mixed the ground beef with about a cup of frozen mixed veggies (peas and corn).  Everyone loved it; it was definitely a huge hit!

I've made this so many times that I must give everyone my updates.  First, I season the beef with whatever I have on hand (onion powder, garlic powder, seasoning salt, meat magic, etc.)  I use canned veggies (drained), and then top it with  instant potatoes.  (I use either 4 cheese or roasted garlic!)  Then I top with about 1 cup of cheese (any cheddar mix will do.)  The result is delicious AND it is sooooooo much faster!!!  Great weekday meal for the meat-and-potatoes type family! I've also made it with the brown gravy instead of the beef broth - husband did NOT like that... he much prefers the broth.  Gravy gives it almost a beef stew texture.  Update 2:  I also use the bagged steamed veggies that I've become a huge fan of.  And yes, it does taste better if you use real onion and garlic.. just toss in a small food processor to chop.

As already said, this is a sort of cottage pie, as it's made with beef, however it's wrong. you don't put onions or cheddar in the potato topping, sprinkle the cheddar on top if you want before sticking it in the oven at the end or under a grill, but the cheddar is purely optional , don't mash the carrots, they should be in chunks, no ketchup, use tomato puree if you want, but ketchup is a no-no, a splash of Worccester sauce is good, as is a teaspoon of mustard powder inwith the filling, and where are the peas so clearly visible in the photo? Sorry to be so negative, but it's an english recipe (not Irish), and I've been making it for as long as I can remember. There are better recipes to be found than this one.

This recipe was fantastic!

Like other's here, I added a few little extra's into the mix.
Instead of the small amount of Ketchup, I added 1/4 cup...
I used a FULL can of Beef Broth, and added 1/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce
into the ground beef cooking section

I would recommend adding a 1 cup of corn to the beef mixture as well
when you add the broth and ketchup..etc...but use niblet corn...
NOT peaches & cream or sweet corn, as the meal
 (with the carrots and extra ketchup added) can turn the taste a 
little sweeter than you might like it.

I also added a bug dollop of sour cream to the mashed potatoes before I 
spread them across the casserole...(makes them smoother and easier to spread)

This recipe is a keeper and one of my top 10's here!

We REALLY liked this recipe.  When I make any dinner with mashed potatoes I automaticly make way more mashed potatoes needed for that dinner, because I know I will make Shepherd's pie for dinner within two days.  I made a few changes, which my husband said was the best shepherd's pie he has every eaten.  I added 1/4 cup of worcheshire sauce to the hamburger when browning.  I used a can of drained peas and carrots ( and eliminated the 5 carrots), then I added a can of drained whole corn on top of that.  Instead of beef broth, I used a can of Franco American Beef Gravy.   I would recommend this to anyone. Bon Appetit...

This recipe was very tasty.  I was skeptical about not using any spices in the meat mixture as I am the type of cook who loves spices.  I did add garlic as I cannot imagine cooking without it!!  Meat mixture was very moist, carrots lended a sweet taste to the pie and the onions & cheese in the potatoes was truly a great match.  Would definitely make this recipe again.  Family loved it.  Other than it taking a lot longer than the indicated prep time this is definitely a hit in my books!!!  2 THUMBS UP!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!  Will be really a wonderful, hearty meal for those fridgid winter nights!  Added some minced garlic to the potatoes and meat and a couple dashes of Worchestershire sauce along with the ketchup.  Instead of mashing the carrots, I finely chopped them after cooking.

I made this with two pounds of lean turkey burger, and about two cups of low sodium beef broth.  Left overs were a hit too.  Very tastey.

Needs less potatos more meat. Basically spot on tasteless english food.  Needs herbs and lots of salt and pepper. I added 1/2 bottle of red wine which helped a little. Drinking the other 1/2 helped more.

Okay, I cheated.  I didn't have any potatoes on hand, but I did have a bag of "Simply Potatoes with Onion" lurking in the fridge which I used for the mashed potatoes ~ using these made for SUPERB mashed potatoes.  Continued to make the dish as directed, but added 1/4 cup of worstershire and sauteed garlic to give the dish more complexity.  I know others will scream foul, but I had green beans I needed to use, so I threw those in as well...  Not a traditional Shepherd's Pie, but it turned out wonderful!

Such a winner with my entire family.
My small changes make it perfect...I hope they are a help to someone...as I took many other tips from other reviews and combined them.
First, I used 1 C of sour cream, butter and some milk (just a tad) in making the mashed potatoes. They, according to my kids, are the best part! The sour cream really does make the difference. I also season them with Lawry's season salt.
I sauteed the onions with the beef (used half beef and half turkey..about 1 1/2 lbs. in all) and seasoned w/ garlic powder, worchestershire (about 3 T), ketchup and a bit of steak sauce.

I then made homemade gravy:
brown flour in oil and make a roux (I do a good bit)...add s and p and garlic powder. Once brown, I add a can of beef broth, then milk to consistency of choice. I mixed the beef mixture with the gravy...so delicious.
This was the bottom layer. Next was a layer of corn, then the coarsly smashed carrots, then the potatoes, and a goodly layer of cheddar cheese. Sprinkle w/ paprika and you have a beautiful and savory meal that will be on everyone's request list!

This is delicious with a ceasar salad.

Note, you can also use green beans or peas in this, in addition to, or instead of the corn. You almost can't go wrong with this!

I really enjoyed this. I did change it up a bit and didn't add carrots simply because our family wouldn't like that.

Very good.  I followed the others suggestions and added 1/4 c. worcester sauce and 1 pack gravy with 1 c. water.  I also substituted about 14 oz. frozen peas and carrots for the mashed carrots.  Worked out very well.  I would suggest adding milk or cream to the potatoes as they were a little bit dry.  Very good though, I will make again.

I didn't follow the recipe because some said it was bland.  I added 1/2 each of red and yellow bell pepper, a couple tblspn's of Worchester sauce, 2 gloves of garlic to the meat and 1 roasted to the potatoes (no onion in potatoes), 4 skninned plum tomatoes that went into the food processor. I sauteed 10 sliced baby carrots  in butter for 5 minutes then added the onion and bell pepper while the ground beef was draining in a colandar.  I then added the beef, 2+ cups beef broth and Worchester to the sauteing veggies and simmered.  I seasoned the meat with Monterey Steak Seasoning when browning and sauted an entire small package of fresh baby portabella mushrooms in butter until they created a deep colored sauce which I thickened with flour and cooked for an additional 5 minutes stirring frequently to create a thick roux. Added it to the meat, carrots, and peppers simmering in the beef broth to create a gravy.  I put less than 1/4 cup ketchup on the bottom of the casserole about a cup of cheddar on top of the meat and another 1/4 cup in the potatoes.  I used this as a guide and I hate it when people change a recipe and than rate it but this was awsome.  I almost gave up on this site because I have made so many recipes that are highly rated only to be very disappointed.  I now sort recipes by ratings then click again to get the negative ratings first to find out peoples complaints and adjust accordingly. This was devoured with requests for a remake in the very near future.

My husband and I LOVED this dish.  It smelled delicious while cooking and gave us 2.5 meals.  I followed some of the suggestions that said to add garlic and worcestershire sauce to the ground beef. I also added 2 Tbsp of sour cream and some oregano to the mashed potatoes, with a sprinkling of paprika on top for color. Also, instead of using carrots, I put a layer of frozen peas on top of the ground beef before adding the mashed potatoes on top.

SO delicious, I will be making it again very soon.

Instead of the chopped carrots, I mixed into the browned ground beef (didn't layer) a package of thawed mixed vegetables (corn, peas, green beans, carrots).  And at the suggestion of some other reviewers, added some worcestershire sauce.  Really enjoyed this hearty casserole.

This is a good base to start from.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes & had to add some milk to the mashed potatoes.  Extra sharp cheddar worked well.  I wanted a variety of vegetables so I sliced baby carrots and steamed them.  Towards the end of the carrot cooking time, I added in frozen corn kernels followed by frozen peas.  The vegetables were mixed into the meat mixture.  The flavor was a bit bland for our tastes but the combination of flavors overall was still good.

This recipe is really good. I had never made shepherd's pie before. I had never even eaten it. It's just not something that was served in my house. However, when my extremely picky husband put in a request for me to make one, I had to find a recipe that would work the first time! The next time, I will reduce the amount of onions because I kinda felt like they overpowered some of the better flavors. I also added a can of peas (I hate the flavor of frozen peas) and a can of sweet corn. Gotta sneak in as many veggies as possible without crossing the line where my husband will actually try it. It went over so well! This will go into my regular dinner rotation. Another plus, is that I can make this in the morning before I go to work and my husband will throw it in the oven when he gets off work.

We loved this!  As per other reviews, I skipped the beef broth and instead added 1 packet of gravy mix combined with 1 c. water.  This made the sauce nice and thick & there was enough left in the pan to pour over each serving like a gravy.  I also skipped the mashed carrot layer and instead put on about a 2 cup layer of frozen peas and carrots.  You could use any frozen vegetable combination that your family loves.  I also added 2 T. Worchestershire (sp?) sauce to the the browned hamburger at the same time as the ketcup and gravy mix and it really added a nice flavor to the meat...it wasn't just 'plain hamburger', as my husband said.  We took this to an Olympics Opening Ceremony viewing party as our contribution to the London Food theme  & everyone loved it!!  Husband even told me to put this one 'in the rotation'...a major compliment!  :)

Really loved this dish.  The addition of the little bit of chopped onion and cheese to the potatoes adds so much flavor.  I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables instead of just the carrots and that really made it a breeze to make.  My son thought it would also be great topped with biscuits instead of the potatoes.  Next time, I will try that idea.

I made this tonight, only altering the mashed potatoes to be instant (time constraints). I had some carrots that desperately needed to be used so I went ahead and mashed them in as suggested. Instead of beef broth, I only had bouillon, I ended up using 1.5 C water and 2 cubes to get the flavor I wanted (I had 2 lbs of meat). Also, I added 2 C of frozen corn to the beef mixture. It's really amazing. I had too much so I baked it in two casserole dishes. Adding some sour cream to mashed potatoes is always a great idea too. UPDATE 9/12: Making this with homemade potatoes adds exactly the improvement you'd expect. Made it for my fiance's birthday dinner tonight with homemade potatoes, 3 lbs of ground turkey, and added approx. 3/4 C of both frozen peas and frozen corn to the meat mix before baking. (Should've probably cooked the frozen veggies slightly longer on the stovetop before baking, but it was still amazing.) I love this recipe and with or without cheese it's just great. Real non-frozen carrots adds a lot.

I loved the flavor of this recipe, but it did not have the gravy I expect from Sheperd's Pie.  My kids and husband didn't like it because of the carrot layer.  They prefer carrots in chunks so they can pick them out lol.  However, I thought it was spectacular against the mashed potatoes.  I'd mix the two if I could get away with it.  I will keep the recipe, but will not be a regular around here.

Very good, once a few changes are made. First, as others have suggested, I added 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce to the meat along with 2 cloves of minced garlic, however, i added it, AFTER I drained the meat. Also, I added one bag of frozen, mixed veggies and placed them directly on top of the meat mixture in the baking dish. I did not mix carrots with the mashed potatoes, I did however use instant because we prefer them to be lump free. GREAT recipe! Everyone always begs for more!!!

This is the first shepherd's pie I've ever made that had a real "wow" factor.  I followed the recipe almost exactly; the only revision was adding two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce.  My anticipation was that half would be leftover for lunches- but after my husband's second and third helpings, there wasn't any left!  I really appreciate the from-scratch approach: although it might be tempting to cut corners by using other recipes' call for highly processed cream-of-whatever soup, your tastebuds will thank you for taking the time to make this comfort food the way it was meant to be prepared.

omg. so friggin delish! made a few changes: after cooking potatoes, i added the butter and onion and also sour cream and american cheese (only cuz i didnt have the other), but the sour cream helps!! i sauted garlic AnD onions before adding beef then added worcestershire sauce, ketchup, diced tomatoes, and a can of beef gravy after flour direction.. and instead of mashing carrots, i used frozen carrots, green beans, and corn and boiled. then transerred the meat to pan, then frozen veggies that i had flavored with butter and salt, then the mashed potatoes, and put more american cheese on top, lacking the cheddar.. mostly the same recipe but took advise of others and suited it to my tastes. everyone had seconds and some even thirds. but i will tell you that its a good idea to, per serving, add a couple drops of tobasco.. its awesome.

Excellent recipe just as is.  This recipe is wonderful to make and put into single serving dishes to take to someone in need and it freezes well so double it up.  Add whatever vegetables you like or keep them as a side dish if you aren't sure what the recipients like.  My family likes garlic mashed potatoes so I add 3 cloves in with the potatoes when I boil them and cook them in any extra broth or a bouillon cube to enhance the flavor.  Regarding the meat, season it to what pleases you but know what you are adding ( Ketchup =^ sugar, Worcheshire =^ salt, use cornstarch instead of flour to make it gluten free).  This is an ultimate comfort food recipe especially served with apple crisp or pie.  Mmmmm!  Thanks Jacquie.

Oh my...this is the best hamburger meal I've made in quite some time.  A few months ago we went to an Irish restaurant where my husband ordered Shepherd's Pie that was "horrible" in his opinion.  I decided I'd look for a good homemade recipe.  This was it!  He said it was 10 times better than ANY he'd ever had.

I read many of the reviews and added the Worchesteshire sauce, minced garlic, doubled the ketchup and used mixed frozen peas, carrots, and corn.  I did not add the gravy mix because I thought the flour/beef broth would be fine.  As I sauteed the meat mixture it was beautiful and very tasty.   I made real mashed potatoes.

I wanted to make smaller servings, so I divided mine into six single serving sized bowls.  We ate some and froze the others for a quick tasty and healthy meal.  THANKS Jacquie!!

I've been making this for almost 5 years now and my husband and kids LOVE IT! I do it a bit differently but it still turns out delicious. Instead of mashing carrots....I do the meat as it says (I add garlic to it though and seasonings to my liking), then I add a small bag of frozen mixed veggies to it, spread it in the pan then top with mashed potatoes and cheese on top! This is a great meal and easy to prepare in advance too! ENJOY!

First, I want to share that a close friend from Dublin actually recommended this recipe to me as she thought it was one of the more authentic versions of this recipe.  To fine tune the recipe a bit more, I used a little more meat (1 1/2 - 2lbs) and a little extra potato (5 large).  I also added garlic and mushrooms when sauteeing the meat to give it a bit more flavor.  I increased the amount of gravy and added worchestshire to taste and a bay leaf for simmering.   I did not include the smashed carrots as I'm not a fan of the carrots-beef gravy flavor combination.  Finally, I recommend baking longer  or broiling the last 5 minutes to get a browned coating on top.  Delicious!

This was a great recipe with the modifications suggested by other reviewers.  My big time/cleanup savers: I cooked the onion right along with the meat (I used ground turkey), I used leftover garlic mashed potatoes, and I used canned/frozen veggies (I used Mexicorn and frozen peas, which I thawed in the microwave first).  I doubled the gravy, which was definitely a good idea.. 4 Tb flour, 1 1/2 c water and 2 tsp beef broth base, probably 2 tsp Worcestershire (not 1/4 cup like other people said.. I don't like it that much.. a little goes a long way for me), and 1 Tb Montreal Steak Seasoning (which I might leave out next time, just because I don't like giving my toddler black pepper).  I had to use a 2.5 qt oval casserole.. my round 2 qt wasn't big enough.  I baked it as directed, then broiled it for a few minutes.  My picky husband's first comment was 'It needs more pasta'.  I have no idea what he thought he was eating.. but he said he liked it. :)

This dish was AMAZING with a few changes that I made! I used potato flakes to make the mashed potatoes. I also added diced celery, red pepper and corn to the the carrots and mixed all the veggies into the beef before pouring it into the pan.
For flavoring the beef, I also added 1.5 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and doubled the amount of ketchup. I also added a teaspoon of sugar to the beef to balance out the flavor of the beef and make it more well-rounded. Lastly and probably most importantly, I added a tablespoon of taco seasoning to the beef and that really gave it the flavor it needed! My mom reallyyy liked this dish and you will too if you add some additional flavoring for the beef!

I just made this dish for the first time and I thought it was pretty good. I added 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce and substituted the broth for 1 cup of water with 1 packet of beef gravy. Instead of the carrots I added a 1 1/2 of frozen mixed veges as well. Nice hearty meal. :-)

Not your typical dish.  I followed the recipe exactly, contrary to what I knew.  The picture shows what I want.  I made it for my wife (her favorite) and she asked where were the peas and corn.  Duh!  The Ketchup made the beef sweet and took away the savory elements of it.  I would have used a spice like thyme for the meat but i didn't.  The end result was I got beef, carrots and potatoes.  I would order the picture of the dish any day but I would never make this recipe again.  It does provide 6 portions but since my wife won't eat it, I've got plenty of mediocre leftovers to stomach.  Please adjust the recipe to your liking and omit the ketchup.  It really made it taste like sweet meatloaf with stuff piled on top.  I would give this a C- grade.  I'm giving the author credit for atleast putting baseline steps online for others to use as a guide.  Cook times and portions are accurate.  Taste is not, even though it got high stars.  You'll notice everyone changed the recipe and came out with a better result.

This is great tasting!  I read a few of the reviews and the modifications the cooks made.  I made only a few small modifications.  I added 2 tablespoons of ketchup not one;  I used a little smoked fontina cheese along with cheddar.  I didn't peel the potatoes.  I left the skins on so I would get more of the nutrients.  When I make this again, I'm going to leave some of the water in the potatoes when I mash them.  I did add a little milk to the potatoes because without it they wouldn't mash up as nicely.  I think this dish is great and I'm so glad I made it.  It is very economical.  I'll have leftovers for a few days.  Great comfort food.

This was really quick and tasty!  Great for a weekday meal.  My hubby said that he liked it and should make again!  I did not mash my peas and carrots...just put in whole.  I wish I would have had corn to add a little sweet veggie in there!

Dont be scared to experiment...I added a top layer of Quinao Corn Bread:  1 cup quinoa meal, or flour                             2 cups corn meal  1 tsp salt                                                   ¬Ω tsp baking soda  1 ¬Ω tsp baking powder                                  1 Tbs honey or brown sugar  1 large egg, beaten                                      3 Tbs melted butter or bacon fat  2-¬Ω cups buttermilk     Preheat oven to 425¬∞ degrees.

Awesome! Family loved it!  followed the recipe exactly, only I used 1 cup of beef broth , added red bell pepper and 2 cloves of garlic to the onion.. thanks Jacquie! this is a keeper! In Chile we make something very similar, only we add sliced hard boiled eggs and black olives to the meat mixture (no ketchup either).. we spice the meat up with paprika, cumin and garlic. And no cheese or onion in the potatoes. Sugar is sprinkled on top and browned in the oven.. I know it may sound weird but it is really good!

I would just like start by saying to the two previous reviewers that ya'll are cracking me up. I am taking a history class right now and after a day of studying the revolutionary war and the events following it you guys ended it with a great laugh:) Well back to the pie. I followed it exactly except I added some garlic salt to the meat while it was cooking and we just didn't like it. Sorry but it was really bland and just not qiute to our liking but would probabley be a great dish for a meat and potato person.Sorry

I rated this five stars after a second try making this with my own personal changes.  In England this would be known as Cottage Pie because it is made with beef, if made with lamb it becomes Shepherds pie.  I skipped on the cheese since it is not traditional and also left out the ketchup substituting for worsteshire sauce and steak sauce since I could not find "brown" sauce.  I trippled this recipe and my family devoured it.  I also left out the oil and browned the ground beef first then sauted the onion in some of the drippings.  Peas were also added to the mix.  I used a typical packet of brown gravy and also a few boullion cubes in place of beef broth.  The kids loved it even the picky eight year old.  There is enough leftovers for my husband to take for lunch.

Such a wonderful recipe!! My family loved it. My sister does not eat carrots, so I left them out, and instead put one more potato. Mixing chopped onion into the potatoes made the potatoes really special. Instead of butter I used beef broth. It really was a wonderful meal, and did not have any left overs!!

I thought this was ok. It seemed a little bland for my taste and I did add a teaspoon or 2 of garlic salt.  Not worth all the work it took and the multiple pans I had to use.  Next time I might add a can of diced tomatoes to the ground beef and spice up the potatoes.

My family really liked it.  Instead of mashing the carrots, though, I cut them up, cooked them, then added them to the meat mixture in chunks.  They were still a little on the crisp side when I took them out of the microwave, so I cooked them in the skillet with the meat a little first.

Loved this recipe! It is economical, satisfying and perfect for a cool fall evening. On the recommendations of others, I made a few slight changes. I diced and boiled the carrots, but didn't mash them afterwards. I added 3 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to the hamburger before cooking and used 2 tbsp of ketchup. Finally, I sprinkled paprika on the completed dish before baking. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was superb.

I changed it up a bit based on what I had handy...one carrot instead of 5, a bag of peas, no ketchup. Sauteed carrot and onion in pan with a little chopped celery/celery leaves and 3 cloves garlic in olive oil, added garlic, then added Laura's lean ground beef and browned. Added worchestire (about 20 shakes), 1/2-3/4 cup red wine. powdered beef boullion, water, and a half packet powdered mushroom gravy mix. Black pepper. Put in casserole and topped with Country Crock premade garlic mashed potatoes (in refrig. section) and mexican blend chees (cheddar and some white cheeses. Omitted the chopped onion topping. OMG, it was so good!!!!!!!! Seriously out of this world, and EASY!

Followed the suggestions for using a packet of brown gravy. We added frozen peas, fresh mushrooms, 1/4 cup of red wine, and about 1 Tbsp dried parsley. Amazing! One of our favorite family meals!

Love the addition of the layer of mashed carrots.  It gave this old favourite dish such a unique flavour.  I've tried a number of different Shepherd's Pie recipies, but this is by far my favourite.  A definite keeper.  Many thanks for sharing!

Very good meal.  I used fresh peas and carrots from my garden.  I also made beef gravy with a little butter, flour and beef stock.  I added it to the beef-veggie mix!  So good that everyone in my family had seconds!

This is a five-star recipe in my house. My husband (the pickiest eater ever) loves it and so does everyone that I've made it for. I tweak the original recipe slightly to make mine. I always double the recipe. I use instant potatoes instead of boiling my own for time, add a handful of shredded cheddar and set to the side. Then I brown onions and add the meat when they're nearly carmelized. I add worcestershire sauce while the meat is cooking (enough that you can easily smell it). Then I add three tablespoons of ketchup and four tablespoons of flour. When incorporated, add two packets of brown gravy mix and two cups cold water. Makes a nice rich gravy for the potatoes. Pour the meat into a baking dish, top with canned corn and peas, potatoes on top of that and a nice sprinkling of cheddar on top. Bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. It is absolutely delish!

Very good and relatively easy. I used the frozen mashed potatoes, which made it a little easier. I would increase the liquid just a little, so it is a little more moist. The last few minutes I turned on the broiler to make the top nice & crispy.

This is the first shepherd's pie that I've tried to make and it was great!  I followed the directions exactly but instead of the mashed carrots I used (thawed) frozen mixed veggies, and instead of the cheddar cheese I used a 5 cheese Italian blend because it's all I had on hand.  This all worked out really well, although I'm sure the cheddar would have made it even better. :)  I will definitely make this again and when I do I think I'll try using tomato paste in exchange for the ketchup because the bf and I both agreed that the ketchup lent a little too much sweetness to the dish.  Overall, this was great, easy, tasty, home-y, and filling!

I make shepherds pie often and this is officially my new recipe. I altered the recipe some by taking advise from SCIOTA and adding 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce and using brown gravy mix and water in place of the beef broth. I replaced the carrots with corn and added more onion and cheese to the potatoes(cause whats better than potatoes with cheese)! YUM

I decided to make this because I had 1 1b of ground beef and I wanted to try something different. I picked this shepherds pie because it had no canned ingredients and a reviewer said it tasted the most authentic. I have never made shepherds pie. I thought the components separately had a good taste, especially the potato mixture. I might even make the potato topping alone as a side dish. But, after it was all baked, together in the oven, it tasted some what "bland," and the ingredients almost seemed like 3 separate components. It might be because of the lack of a gravy or sauce in this dish. However, one of the people I served it to seemed to really like it, and said it was way better tasting than any he had eaten before.

Great recipe!  Made it for dinner last night and it was a hit!  I added a bit of chopped fresh garlic to my potatoes and a tablespoon of Worcestershire to the beef mixture.  To simplify I used a bag of frozen mixed veges - partially thawed.

My men went nuts over this and there wasn't a drop left! I added 1/4 C worchestershire (which was a little too much IMHO) and some steak seasoning to the beef before cooking. Otherwise, used as is.

I've searched and made so many others and they were always a liquidy mess! But this recipe is perfect!! I took other's suggestions and used frozen peas & carrots, so much easier! I just poured them evenly over the meat leaving them frozen. It gave the dish a bang of flavor and color, then, i didn't have worceshiere sauce, so i used about a tsp of A1 steak sauce, perfect!! This will become a weekly meal. Thank you!!

This is a good recipe that I will make again and perfect.  I only gave it 4 stars because I think that it alone is not 5 star...it's good with some modifications.  Last night I followed the recommendations of others and used worsteshire sauce and brown gravy mix.  I also upped the ketchup to 2 T.  My own personal modifications were, when I made the mashed potatoes, I used 5 large russets...and when I mashed them, I added 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup butter.  I did not add the onions, but did add the cheese.  They turned out GREAT.  With the carrots, I did boil them for the time suggested, but I did not mash them.  I will make this again...and my picky husband actually liked this.  He hates casseroles of all kinds.  Next time I make it though, I will NOT add the worsteshire sauce and maybe not even the ketchup.  I did NOT like the sweet flavor that those two ingredients gave the beef.  Next time, for the beef, I will just sautee garlic and onions in butter, like before, then when the beef is browned, add the flour...but will try only using the brown gravy mix with water...I also had to add more water to the gravy mix, so next time I will go with 1.5 cups and increase it to 2 if needed.  This is a good recipe with the modifications made.

this shepherd's pie is time consuming but the results are very tasty! i used farm fresh potatoes, carrots & garlic (1 tsp. chopped & sauteed) which was a nice touch. i also put a shot of worchestershire sauce in with the beef broth & catsup. next time i'll increase the gravy mixture & flour by 50% to make it juicier. thank you for the yummy recipe, jacquie!

Great recipe, except I did change it up a bit (used tips from other reviewers). Added worchestershire, A1, garlic powder and onion powder to ground beef. I also added more flour and more beef broth to make it 'creamier', which worked. I didn't use any ketchup, I didn't think it needed it. I omitted the carrots, because we don't like them, and used canned corn instead, which was just fine. I also made the potatoes creamier by adding more butter and some milk before whipping. Overall this is a wonderful recipe and my husband remarked on how much he liked it compared to the "boring" shepards pie that we usually try. I'll make this one again and again!

This recipe in its description talks about carrots yet there are none in the recipe.  What's with that?

We normally use beef in our Sheperd's Pie but this time we used BUTTERBALL GROUND TURKEY and the results were great. Really went well with the sweetness of the carrots and my wife & I appreciated the lower calories & health benefits of using BUTTERBALL GROUND TURKEY.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. Interestingly, the picture clearly shows peas, but the recipe posted includes no peas. I like the addition of  frozen peas. Also, I do not mash the carrots. I cut them in small slices before I cook them and then leave them unmashed. As suggested by other posters, I use gravy mix and water in place of the broth and add worcestershire to beef. GREAT comfort food!

OMG I have made this RECIPE almost seventy times, LITERALLY! 
It tastes 100% almost exactly like what you would get at an Irish Pub. Wifey-poo loves it when I make this, and when the innies (it's what we call the in-laws) come for a visit I make sure to make a double batch to ensure enough grub for all!!!! LOL!!!
I've changed this 5-STAR RECIPE a little bit to make it worth 5-stars. 
First, instead of beef I use ground lamb (c'mon, if it was beef, it'd be COTTAGE PIE, LOL!!)
I like to do a brown butter mashed potato/parsnip mixture instead of the straight ahead 'tatos. Simmer the butter on low-med for 15 or so minutes AND THEN ADD the BOILED potatoes and parsnips to the mix. Make's 'em so much more tasty. 
Instead of ketchup, I reduce tomato paste with Guinness and worchesterchisire sauce and add that to the lamb mix. 
And I don't do the carrot mash, instead adding FROZEN corn.
BUT I DO ADD FRESH THYME TO BOTH THE POTATOES AND THE MEAT MIXTURE
Also instead of beef I use turkey.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

Oh my word was this ever good! Thank you so much for posting. I followed the recipe as listed-but did make a few adjustments to taste.  Added a bit of sour cream to mashed potato,along w/diced onion and cheddar cheese,salt/pepper. Fried the lean ground beef w/onion, some fresh diced garlic,and added some fresh mushrooms,seasoned w/ salt,pepper and season all. I did follow advice of others and used the gravy pkt w/ water in place of broth,added a bit of worcestershire and ketchup,to taste as it simmered-thickened w/ the addition of flour. In a separate small pan boiled a small amount of fresh cut up carrots, and after they were tender, added 1 can of peas and niblet corn and let the veges simmer in a small amount of butter. Then layered in a 2.5 qt baking dish,meat mixture, veges and potatoe on top. Sprinkled some paprika and cheddar cheese on top,baked for apprx 40 min, til top was golden brown and it was like magic.. The flavors blended so wonderfully- I am ashamed,yet proud,to say- between two people- there remains only about 1/2 of the dish left after dinner tonight..This recipe is a keeper and I cannot wait to make it again for other family members. What a wonderful dish!

This is a great healthy recipe why add all those processed ingredients which add so much more unwanted salt. Beef broth and ketchup is fine if you like more gravy like then put 1tbs of flour when you cook the onions and meat. I boil my potatoes with yams all the time. I usually make two since it freezes so well. Make both, eat one, the other in the fridge overnight, then cut it in portions and freeze it.. great for college kids(have two of those hungry animals) and they love it...enjoy..

This was delicious!! Never made Sheperd's pie and this was a hit with the family. Used lean ground tukey, instead of ground beef. It was very flavorful.

I really have to comment on this.  It's delicious, easy and so what if it is called cottage pie in some places?  It doesn't detract from the original if you add something that your family enjoys or if you don't like ketchup in it. This is a recipe sharing site, not a chef critique.  If you make enough changes and think they are better, then post your own recipe instead of disparaging the original poster.  Well done, Jacquie.  I did change a few things because of what I had on hand, but it was a great inspiration for a cold winter night dinner.  Good on ya. :>)

This is my first time making Shepherd's pie and it was very easy!  The only thing I did differently was to add frozen carrots and peas to the cooked ground beef layer instead of the mashed carrots layer.  I will keep this recipe to make again.  Thanks

I made this for dinner last week. Compared to  another Shepherd's Pie version I made from this site in the past. The one I made last week was a huge improvement, and tantalizing to the taste buds. Since I'm not big on carrots I substituted the carrots for frozen corn. Let me tell you this recipe when it was finished cooking, was to die for. Since I like to gorge myself on the rare occasion that I actually cook, I doubled the ground beef to 4 pounds, and added more potatoes to mash, I also added some Lawry's salt seasoning to the ground beef while it was cooking on the stove. Wish I would of added some worcestershire sauce to the meat while it was cooking. I think that would of added some nice flavor to the meat. Definitely next time. Overall this recipe was great. I'm definitely going to make this again.

Thanks Jacquie! I made this yesterday and we both really enjoyed it. I did mash a bit of carrot for it but also added a can of corn and frozen peas. I read other reviews who commented the beef was bland so I used an envelope of french onion soup with a cup of water (in place of broth) and while frying poured about 1/4 Worcestershire in. To spuds I minced some garlic to throw in with the cheese. Left onion out since I was using the flavor in the beef. I didn't get as much gravy as I wanted so I'll have to add gravy mix as well next time or broth/water along with soup mix. I hate always seeing recipes with viewers additions/changes but mine isn't all that off from yours. Just needed a bit more flavor for our tastebuds. aloha

4 stars because I agree with other users, as is it's too bland.  I browned meat with onions, garlic, black pepper.  Then added 1 1/2c beef stock & 1/2 c water, 1/4c Worcestershire, old fashioned gravy mix packet & frozen peas & carrots.  Mixed together & put in 2.25qt casserole dish. 2nd layer was cheese slices so I didnt have to shred cheese. Tore up cheese slices & added to potatoes & topped dish with potato mix. Kids loved it!

Was good. I added a little sausage to the ground beef. We weren't sure of the carrots but after eating it we didn't taste them at all...just added vitamins. I think next time I'll add peas and bake it a little longer. My husband also said it needed fennel and pepper.

My family loved this so much, I actually made this twice this week! The only things I changed was that since I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, I had to add a little more of broth, ketchup and onions. Also I added a tablespoon of worstershire sauce and that gave it a little kick.

Used to hate this dish. The way my boyfriend's parents make it.... ewww! So boring and plain, worse than midwestern cooking! But this, this is a KEEPER! Adding the gravy packet to the beef was genius!! Also added in some frozen peas with the fresh carrots. Omitted cheese. Is it really necessary to add more fat? Plus, it doesn't need the flavor... so yummy!!

This just didn't have that much taste.  I used real potatoes - not instant - and added worchestershire sauce to the meat.  Still, it was a little bland.  Maybe I'll try this recipe again using the packet of brown gravy instead of beef broth.  It needed more sauce with the meat.

This is very good, I went by the recipe. I am curious about people who rate a recipe saying "its good" or "its bad" if they have not used the EXACT recipe. When something is altered in a recipe how do they KNOW its good or bad?

I think this might literally be the best recipe I have made from this site, ever. I was looking for weeknight comfort food on a budget, and for that, it's hard to top this! I did change the recipe slightly. I used 2 deep dish 9 inch pie crusts instead of a casserole dish. I added a bag of frozen peas (steamed) to mix with the carrots. I also doubled the shredded cheese. This is truly delicious and heartwarming, and easy! Highly recommend.

It was really good but I'm thinking it took longer than 30 minutes to prepare. But I may be a little slower than some. I had to add milk to the mashed potatoes because there was no way they were going on top the way it called for in the recipe, they were way too stiff. I am anxious to try this again, however the next time I am going to add some chives to the mashed potatoes and corn, peas, worcestershire, garlic and maybe a splash or two of hot sauce. Don't get me wrong it was a good recipe however I think it could be a great recipe with a few adjustments.

OK, well my husband licked his plate! I made this with some adaptations others have suggested as well as my own.  I used a package of gravy mix, Worcestershire sauce,  a bit of soy sauce, thyme, and oregano.  I used the flour as well as the gravy mix and found I had to add more water.  Next time no flour.

My kids really like this because it is simple and straight-forward.  I like it for the same reasons, plus I don't get any complaints!  I did use a pouch of mashed potatoes, and also 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies, and ground turkey instead of beef.  We had no leftovers, so that's a great sign!

If I could I would give this no stars.  It was very bland tasting, and the amount salt we had to add to it to give it some flavor was enough to give us all heart attacks.  I had such high hopes for this recipe, what a let down.

This was great! Made it with carrots and corn, and added more ketchup and worcestershire to the meat for extra flavor.

I'm rating the meat portion of this because in a pinch, I layered with corn, (instant) mashed and cheddar cheese.  I thought the beef was delicious with the flour, ketchup and beef broth. My husband was surprised by it and loved it too. I will definitely keep this recipe. Thanks!!

yummy!  This was incredibly simple to make and really delicious and saucy!  i added a little more flour, ketchup and broth since I love it nice and saucy, and it came out awesome.  I also did one can of creamed corn and 2 ears of shucked fresh corn (mixed together in a bowl) and used that as the veggies instead of carrot and it had a great sweet flavor.  Total fall staple!

This is a great starter. The second time I made it I "improved" it for our tastes and what I had on hand. I browned the meat with onions and a little Worchestershire sauce. I heated up frozen green beans, carrots and corn to add for the layer between meat and potatoes. My husband HATES peas so none of those! I took some others advice and added a packet of brown gravy mix to the browned meat after the flour and added 3/4 c. water. I also added some diced onion and mushrooms. I did the real potatoes but also added an instant package of cheddar and sour cream potatoes. That was delicious!! I have 2 teenage boys and between them and my husband there were NO leftovers!! They loved it! This is a great recipe to play with and SO filling!! Much better than the one my mom used to make! This is a keeper!

This really is a great starter recipe for Shepherd's Pie.  I made it on St. Patty's and have had it requested by friends and family a couple of times since.   I followed a couple of the other reviews, adding 1/4 c Worcestershire to the meat while it cooked, tossing a package of brown gravy mix in after the flour, and substituting a package (8 or 12 oz) of frozen peas and carrots for the laborious boiling and mashing of the carrots.   I added 4 cloves of garlic to the onions while they sauteed, added 2 tsp each of savory and thyme to the meat after it had browned, and substituted a cup of Guinness for the beef broth.  I added a can of drained corn to the vegetables before layering them in the pie. Edit: Make sure to cook it long enough for the peas and carrots to have no more than the desired amount of tooth.  If you like them both soft, you might par-cook them in a bowl in the microwave before adding them to the pie.

I'm not sure if the rating is in order, as I changed it so dramatically from the original:  But I give it 5 stars for the easy explanation of the ingredients and how they're assembled.    I used a monster oven-proof 12" skillet, so ended up using about 8 small russet potatoes:  To save time, while they were boiling, I also boiled sliced carrots, waited 5 minutes, then added frozen peas and corn.  I didn't smoosh the carrots all up, either:  I sauteed ground turkey and onion and added salt, pepper, roasted garlic powder, dried thyme and worcestershire sauce (a trick to give ground turkey a depth of flavor more similar to ground beef), then drained the skillet and boiled vegetables, added a dash of salt and pepper to the veggies, spread the mashed potatoes on top and baked, taking off the lid in the last 5 minutes and adding chopped scallions and cheddar cheese.  YUM...hubby and I agreed this is a great comfort food recipe:  Cheap, filling and very tasty!  Will use it many times to come, I'm sure!

Very good. Added additional minced garlic to the beef mixture. Worchestershire sauce definitely made the beef amazing. So rich and authentic.

Added worchestershire to beef after draining to add flavor, and before adding the broth & ketchup. Oh, and added cooked sliced carrots and sweet peas instead of mashed carrots. Veryyyyy good!

This was not bad. A bit bland, but my family seemed to enjoy it. I used red mashed potatoes as the topping, because I find them to be more flavorful than the normal russets.

This was great with a little "tweeking" as others have mentioned. And it can be done in ONE skillet!!  (if it's oven proof; no plastic handles) I didnt have a brown gravy packet, I just had Au Jus, so I scooted the meat/onion/garlic W.sce combo aside and whisked it w/ a little water in the pan; then combined it into the meat.  I used frozen mixed veg. and  mixed it into it too, then topped w/ a packet of those yummy instant pots, & topped w/ a lot of chz of course!  The whole skillet went into the oven for about 20 mins. @ 375.  Perfect, easy, one pan dinner!  Thanks!

Great recipe.  Definite comfort food.  Took some suggestions of other reviewers.  I also used 1/4 c worschestire sauce in the meat.  Sauteed meat with 1/4 c onions and 2 pressed garlic cloves.  Mixed in separate bowl one packet brown gravy mix and 1 c water.  Added gravy mix and 2 tbl ketchup to meat/onion/garlic.  Boiled potatoes and carrots in same pot to save time.  Didnt mash carrots.  Mashed potatoes with 1/4c sour cream and about 3 tbl milk.  Layered in pie dish meat mixture on bottom, sliced carrots, mashed potatoes, and then topped with cheese.  Great flavor and made the house smell great.  Fiance loved it and insists I make it often. :-)

Very good! Easy to make & filling. I love recipes that have a complete meal in one pan. I thought the recipe was a little bland but my husband said he really liked it!  I did add more butter & a little milk to the potatoes (they seemed really dry). Thanks!

We enjoyed this recipe. I'm giving it a 4 star rating because without the changes suggested by other reviewers it would be pretty bland. I spiced up the beef part with more ketchup, garlic, worchestershire sauce and seasoned salt. I added cream cheese to the potato topping and it was yummy. I did mash the carrots but found them a little odd that way. I added peas because we like them but next time I make this I'll use canned peas and carrots. With the above changes it was a good comfort food type meal.

I will make this recipe again.  Although, the beef mixture wasn't quite flavourful enough for my taste.  Next time I will add garlic, worchestershire and maybe steak sauce instead of ketchup.

People seem more likely to give this 5 stars if they follow the recipe exactly so that's what I tried to do. Serve your peas or corn on the side just to be safe. But I had no flour so I used some sour cream to thicken the meat like I do with stroganoff, and it was divine. A huge hit with those who are not fans of traditional Shepherd's pie as well as those who are.

My kids LOVED this!!This was really good, even tho we had to do a few substitutes. I found I only had two small carrots after I already started, so instead I grabbed two cans of kernel corn, drained (not mashed!)and used instead of carrots. I forgot to add the onion in with the mashed potatoes, and my 'lil helpers' ate all the grated cheese as I was mashing the potatoes, so we went with out cheese. But over-all, it was really good! I was surprised, and I don't think i will add the onions in with the potatoes next time we try this, and we will stick with the corn too. This is a kid friendly meal!

Although Shepherd's Pie was originated in England, it is a very common dish made by Brazilian housekeepers.

The carrots and beef brouilon add quite a delicious touch to this recipe.

My mashed potato recipe was used instead: 4 large potatoes, smashed. Stir in 2 tablespoons butter, a little less than 1 cup sour cream, salt to taste, and 2 tablespoons finely diced purple onion.

To assemble the pie like Brazilians do, put half of the mashed potatoes on the bottom of the casserole pot, then the meat mixture, than the smashed carrots, then the remaining mashed potatoes. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese.

NOTE: you may want to add 1-2 more teaspoons of powdered beef brouilon to the meat mixture.

This was my first try with shepherd's pie.  It tastes simple and was cheap to make.  It is pretty heavy, but I guess that's what it is supposed to be.  My husband loved it.  I did end up dirtying a lot of dishes.  This almost seemed like a food you would make for someone with no teeth, since everything is pretty much mashed.  I guess I prefer some variety in textures and more seasonings, but maybe this could be tweaked to please both me and the hubby!

Solid addition to the weekly dinner selection.  Leftovers are easy and delicious the next day.  One point I found is that the 50 minute prep to table time is way off, add about 30 minutes for the average chef and another 20 if you've limited pots and pans.

I feel a little strange rating this recipe, since I made changes. However, I would never have gotten to this point without the recipe. Rather than explain my changes, I'll tell you what I like about this recipe. I really love the carrots. I love the beef broth / ketchup mixture. These were great ideas for me. It was a hit with the hubby! He had 3 servings.

Delicious and so simple! My Husband absolutely loved this and took the rest for lunch the following day...and he hates leftovers! I suggest making the changes I have to amp up the flavor a little bit!

First off, I seasoned my ground beef while it browned with the onions. I used a little sprinkling of garlic powder and a local spice blend. 

For the potatoes I mixed in 1/4 cup parmesan and a 1/4 cup mozzarella to give it a complex cheese flavor. 

I also increased the beef stock to a scant 1 cup and reduced the flour to 1 Tbsp., instead allowing the beef and sauce to reduce and the flavors to mingle. I also increased the ketchup to 2 Tbsp. for a little more tang. 

My Husband isn't a big fan of mashed carrots, so I used some organic frozen mixed veggies (peas, carrots, corn, and green beans) as the middle layer. I then topped the potato layer with not 1/4 C of cheddar cheese, but 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese. 

Excellent recipe and a family favorite!

Wow... pretty good!  I made this as directed with a few suggested changes.  When growing up, my Mother never made Shepard's Pie so I don't have a preconceived notion of what it should taste like, but I loved the potatoes with the finely chopped onions and cheddar cheese.  I thought the consistency of the potatoes was going to be too thick but they were spot on.  I added 1/4 cup worchestershire sauce to the meat prior to browning which turned out nice and added the brown gravy and 1 cup of water to the cooked meat. I might use the beef broth next time.  I would caution others when using frozen veggies (I used frozen carrots and green peas,) as they were not done within the 20 minutes cooking time.  I probably cooked mine 30 to 35 minutes which turned out fine.  Next time I would at least steam and season the frozen veggies first.  Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was practical and easy to make. I omitted several ingredients because I didnt have them on hand. I used about a 1/4 cup of Cream of Golden Mushroom Soup and a tablespoon of Worchestire instead of beef broth. I didnt have carrots so I cooked kernel corn in with ground turkey. It turned our really good and my kids asked for seconds! Tasted even better the next day! Will make again and try with the mashed carrots. Thanks Jacquie!

This was so good!  I wanted a quick meal so I cheated and used store-made mashed potatoes.  I also used a bag of frozen mixed veggies instead of the carrot mash, although if I have more time I will try that way.  I added brown gravy mix, Worcestershire sauce and a little more water.  I also forgot to get cheese but it was really good without it. I top everything (I mean everything) with Tony Chachere's Cajun salt.  It was really fast, easy and delicious.  Also pretty cheap to make.

This is so good and the closest version to the English Shepherd's Pie I grew up eating in England.  Yes, I know technically "real" Sheps Pie is supposed to be made with lamb but never once have my English parents made it that way!  But it was never made with condensed Campbell's Soup, which this one isn't, and always made its own gravy which is exactly what this one does!  The only thing I did differently was to add the flour to my broth and add them both together.  Delicious!

Frozen veggies?  No way.  The best part (or one of them) of this recipe is the mashed carrots below the cheesy mashed potatoes.  Simply scrumptious.  Yum!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great dish!  I baked it as described in the recipe, but I used an 8x8 baking dish, because I don't have a casserole dish.  I boiled the potatoes and carrots in the same pot, and separated them out after boiling.  Didn't have beef broth, so I made beef bouillon which, as far as I'm concerned, is the same thing.  I had so many interruptions while I was preparing this dish, that all of the ingredients were cold by the time I got around to assembling it, and I forgot to put the cheese in the potatoes.  So, after assembling the dish, I sprinkled all of the cheese on top of the potatoes, covered the dish with foil, and baked for 30 minutes before removing the foil.  Baked it 15 minutes longer so the cheese could get toasty.  This was enjoyed by all of the family, and is now in my recipe box for future use.  Thanks!

good base recipe (hence the 4 not 5 stars)! made some of my own tweaks and got great reviews... added a few splashes of worcestershire sauce to the meat before cooking, used 1C of broth make more gravy, added frozen peas above the meat to up the veggie factor, and added a couple shakes of cayenne pepper to the meat for a little kick. great for a group!

So Yummy- I made this as a back up dish for my Guiness Corned Beef and did some changes as other recommended.  I doubled the recipe and I added Worchestshire sauce 1/4 cup (but doubled that) to the raw meat.  I added sauteed garlic and onion to the meat mixture and then sauteed the meat.  I added a little sour cream and onion salt to the mashed potatoes and instead of mashed carrots I added 10 oz of frozen peas and carrots (doubled to 20 oz)  Next time I would add about 50% more peas and carrots.  I also used the brown gravy powdered mix with 1 cup water (doubled both) instead of the broth.  Super tasty!!  I also have enough for leftovers for tomorrow!!  Baked it for 20 minutes and then left it in the oven for another 30 minutes until we were al ready and it was super moist still and delicious!!

I recommend using a cheddar that does not have that orange/yellow dye added to it.  The white/natural cheddar cheese on top of the mashed potatoes and mixed in looks much more elegant than globs of that orange stuff!  I love Kerrygold and WSU Cougar Gold.  I cooked the carrots and potatoes in the same pot.  My carrots were on the smaller side - next time I will use larger carrots or increase the number.  I used a food processor to mash up my carrots and an immersion blender for the potatoes.  (Unnecessary, but I recently got married and have all these new toys.)  Per some other recommendations I added a can of peas and carrots to the meat (after it was cooked.)  Will do this next time but will rinse the veggies first - I think it added a sweetness to the pie which was good but different than what I am used to.  I also added two cloves of garlic, minced, and salt to the potatoes just before mashing.

oh delicious!! Except to suit my own tastes I used a little more ketchup and used some cut frozen carrots, peas and corn instead of just the carrots. I also added some S&P and crushed garlic in with the meat. I just saved time and used instant mashed potatoes too.

'Didn't "do it" for me, but E & the other guys (males) liked it.  I didn't add onion to the potatoes, but I did add a good spoonful of sour cream.  Also used baby carrots, uncut.  Put them in with the potatoes once it was boiling.  They were done in about five minutes.  'Picked 'em out & put them with the meat.  I added 1/2t salt, 1T worcestershire, 2T ketchup, 1t dry mustard & 1T flour to thicken.  Incidentally, I forgot to thicken it right after browning so just sprinkled it once the broth & seasonings were added & had no problem with it.  'Gonna put this in my "desperation dinners" category since most ingredients are on hand.  Suggestion though:  Quick Cheeseburger Pie by Krystal.  We really like that one A LOT.  :)  Yes, yes, changed that one; but it's yummmmy!  :D

This was my first shepherd's pie and I made alterations based on what I had on hand and other reviewers. I used ground turkey instead of beef. I used a tablespoon of Worstershire sauce and Gravy Master when I prepared it and sauteed my veggies with olive oil and about 1 1/2 tablespoons of crushed garlic.  I added corn and frozen peas and carrots. It was wonderful! Everyone had at least two helpings, even my very picky daughter.

The only change I make to this great recipe is that I use frozen carrots/peas and add a bit of Worchestershire.  It deliciously feeds my family of nine!

This recipe was awesome!!! But I did make some changes as others suggested. I added garlic to my mashed potato mix as well as to the ground beef. I also added corn, peas, chopped celery, carrot and a red pepper to the ground beef mix. I also tried the Worchestershire sauce... wouldn't make it without it. It just gave the ground beef some flavour. I used the beef broth. But found it needed more seasoning so I added some italian spices and hot red pepper flakes. This added some heat. And whatever you do... be sure to put the cheese on top, it just makes it awesome. I served this to my bf and he loved it... said it was better then his mom's which is a huge compliment.

I made this as a vegetarian dish. I substituted Morningstar crumbles for the beef and used vegetarian brown gravy mix with vegetable stock. I also used two Tbs. of ketchup instead of the one called for. I also sprinkled the top with smoked paprika. A very filling vegetarian dish.

This was pretty good.  The only thing that I changed was replacing the cooked carrots with corn.  (I hate cooked carrots.) and adding some garlic salt, onion powder and seasoning salt to the ground beef.  This was pretty good.  Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent! I followed this recipe while making some adjustments recommended by a reviewer.
Here's what I changed: Added a 1/4 cup of worchestershire sauce to ground beef after mixing the flour. I heavily seasoned with salt and pepper. I added garlic and onion while cooking. And I also added a touch of milk and garlic powder to the potatoes when mashing!

This was amazing!  I followed other users' advice and replaced the broth with gravy, and I added peas (I love peas) on top of the carrots.  It was phenomenal.  The prep was a little labor-intensive and left my kitchen a little bit of a wreck, but the end result was totally worth it.  I am definitely making this again!

Easy and delicious! I added garlic salt to the potatoes and beef. I also added some worcestershire hot steak sauce to the beef. And a cup of peas to the carrot layer.

Very good. I took the other reviewers suggestion and omitted the broth and replaced it with a pkg of brown gravy and 1 cup of water. I also added 1/4 cup of worchestire sauce as well. Husband said it was better than the cheesecake factory and he loves the cheeses cake factory!! Kids loved it. My youngest is picky and she loved it. No complaints at dinner tonight!!

Terrific recipe, but make it easy on yourself by browning the onions and ground beef at the same time (add some garlic, too for extra flavor), replace the carrots for a small bag of mixed veggies (corn, carrots, peas and green beans), use a full can of beef broth and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and you'll have a great meal, with much less work.  I made mine without any cheddar cheese and it still turned out marvelously.

I wish they had half stars for a 41/2 ... At any rate, we make this about once or twice a month. It has become the go-to meal for our traditional meat and potato night when we dont do steaks. It is a good standard Shepherds Pie recipe. Im glad everyone enjoys changing it to suit their taste, but many of these changes ive read turn it into something other than shepherds pie. This IS the classic recipe and I would hope people try it this way before using ground turkey (gross) or taking out the mashed carrots which completely changes the flavor,texture, and sweetness.

I love this recipe! I made some additions that others have mentioned (worchesthire sauce, brown gravy mix) as well as my own ideas. Very yummy! 

I stir-fryed red pepper, diced baby carrots and when they were fully cooked or close to it I added some canned green beans and some frozen peas then mixed them all together, made sure they were heated throughout and used that as my veggie mix. Turned out delightful! 

I also added cream (light cream) to my mashed potatoes, in addition to the cheese, onion and margarine (or butter - I used margarine). I also whipped mine which gave the potatoes an even creamier texture. I know adding the cream doesn't make this a healthy choice, but I view this as an occasional dish and therefore ok if its a little higher in calories! :) Love it! :)

I HATE shepherds pie but this was sooo good. I think the carrots give it a better flavor then the traditional green beans. Definately a monthly dinner for us.

I would just like to say, as I'm sure others have before, THIS IS NOT SHEPHERD'S PIE. It's a Cottage Pie.  Shepherd's Pie is made with ground lamb, hence "shepherd".

Overall, not a bad dish. I would have to say it wasn't one of my favorites but it did the job and the husband and daughter liked it. I did add some onion soup mix and worshteshire (?) sauce to the meat. It was pretty good.

This was a great dish, i didnt mind have it the next night and even took it the next day for lunch.  

Some of the changes I made: added peas as a sprinkled layer on top of the carrots, increased the beef by almost twice the recommended amount.  And yes we like cheese so we added even more.  Didnt measure the added, I just winged it.  Next time I'm sure it will be even better!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the directions pretty close. I omitted the onion in the mashed potatoes, added garlic to the onion and beef mixture and worschestershire sauce. It was awesome! I doubled the recipe and made a deep dish pie and it was gone that night.

Great starter recipe I love that most of us have the ingredients on hand in our kitchens.  I made it the other night as written and was perfect for a cold winter night.  Next time I will add a few extra ingredients but overall great as is! TY

Awesome!!!Everyone lovd this.  Instead of the carrots I used a bag of peas and carrots.  I will put this in my normal dinner schedule.  It can be pretty good for you too.  I cut the cheese down and left it out of the potatoes.  Didn't miss it at all.

This is the first time I have made shepherd's pie and the recipe is a definite keeper.  I made it easier by browning the meat in a dutch oven and then layering the other ingredients on top.  Less dishes to do :)  I also used premade refrigerated mashed potatoes to cut down on time - microwaved them as directed and the dish only needed about 10 - 15 minutes in the oven.  Thanks!

Love this!!  I added my own twist with diced sauted mushrooms added to the onions and beef and I also added 1 Tbsp worcestershire sauce to the ground beef.  To the pototatoes when mashing, I added garlic sauted slightly in butter and about 1/4 cup of sour cream.

Fantastic recipe! I substituted some Worcestershire sauce and dark brown sugar for the ketchup, and it gave the beef somewhat of a sweet and smoky flavor. Liquid smoke or Sriracha sauce would also make great additions to the beef.

Made this today.  My 2nd attempt at Shepherds pie.  The first one was way too dry and too many potatoes.  This one, I took others suggestions, including modifying to our taste.  Replaced the carrots with drained can of corn.  Used 1/2 medium onion and added 3 cloves minced garlic.  Replaced the broth with Beef Gravy from McCormick.  Skipped the flour all together.  It didn't need it.  At the end to the browned ground beef tossed in a pinch of chili powder, a T or so of Wocestershire Sauce and 1t Italian seasonings and Couple long squirts of Organic Ketchup.  Used unsalted butter to the potatoes and a 1/8t of garlic powder.  at the end, turned off the oven, turned on the broiler and broiled for 2 minutes, just to brown the cheese a little more.  Baked it for the 20min at 375.  So easy to mike, although time consuming.  (An hour from start to finish) This was so awesome and fantastic.  Served with Whole Foods Moist Cornbread.  This was the best we have ever had.

I thought this recipe was a great base for what I made.  I followed the recommendation of a couple of other people, but put my own spin on it at the same time.  I browned 1.5 lbs of lean beef, drained & seasoned with salt & pepper.  I then added 2T ketchup and about 1/8c Worcestershire sauce and 2T of flour.  I then gradually added 1 can of beef stock (instead of using gravy mix like others) and about 3 more Tablespoons of flour to keep the mixture thick.  I added 1 (drained) can each of:  sweet corn, green beans, carrots.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Once the veggies were heated through, I put the mix in the bottom of 2 square baking dishes and split the mashed potatoes (I cooked about 7 medium) on top of the beef mixture.  I sprinkled with cheese and small bits of butter.  Baked at 375* for 20 minutes and they were perfect :).

This recipe is a great way to stretch a pound of ground beef and use up some of your winter staples (onion, carrot, potatoes). The final dish was a real winner for us. My fiance has celiac disease and can't do any wheat, but  I made a gluten-free version by replacing regular flour with an all-purpose gluten free flour (Bob's Red Mill makes one that's very versatile). I listened to other reviewers and added 1/4 cup of worcestershire to a pound of browned ground beef, but we could really taste it in the final dish - it was too overpowering. I'd try a couple tablespoons next time. I also added some dried thyme. Instead of ketchup I used about 1/2 can of tomato paste that I already had open, which made it more tomatoey but was still good. Also, I used chicken broth instead of beef broth because that's what I had - I really don't think it matters. I layered the meat, then carrot circles (that I had boiled in the same water as potatoes), then added a can of drained corn, then topped with real mashed potatoes mixed with some New York cheddar. We will surely make again and again!

Followed the advice to add worcestershire and a few others; used frozen corn and peas instead of carrots since this was all I had on hand.. Not only did my extremely picky husband LOVE it, when I served it to a few friends leftover the next day- they all raved over it and had to have the recipe. This will definetly be a regular recipe in my house.

This recipe was my first true attempt at Shepherd's Pie and I was pleased with the dish. It was easy to prepare and I already had most of the ingredients in stock. It's very hearty, comforting and filling.   I was concerned that the meat layer would be somewhat bland, so in addition to salt and pepper I added garlic powder, onion powder and seasoned salt. Will be making the recipe again, especially in the winter months.

this is my first time making shepherd's pie and it turned out great.  i did make some changes suggested by other raters.  i added 8 oz sour cream to the mashed potatoes, used 1 packet of brown gravy with 1 cup of water instead of beef broth, and also sauteed diced onions and minced garlic with the ground beef.  i really enjoyed the final result and will definitely be keeping this recipe :)

Like that - very good!  I had seconds, and I went back for more! :)  I seasoned with a teaspoon montreal steak seasoning along with 2 tablespoons vidalia onion steak sauce and 2 tablespoons hot sauce, and made the rest as it was. Made a fantastic, thick gravy that didn't run when I cut into it/served the slice even though I forgot to add the cheese to the beef portion! Tasted great! I used fresh garden carrots (about the size of your index finger), which are thinner than the table carrots from the store, and ended up using 7 to cover the 9" pie pan thinly. If you are using the thick table carrots, you might want to cut it down to 3 if you want just a thin carrot mixture. I will make this again!

This was so delish! I made a double batch thinking I'd have enough to share with my in-laws the next day, but my family almost wiped out the entire 9x13 pan. I like to make things "semi-homemade" so I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies that I pre-cooked in the microwave & instant mashed potatoes for the topping. Made the ground beef mixture according to recipe. I loved that it wasn't made from a creamed soup. Baked for about 1/2 hr then put under broiler for 10 mins so potatoes & cheese crunched up a bit (almost like twice baked potatoes). Absolutely a keeper.

I followed a long with combo of many of the most helpful comments including, omiting broth, adding worchestshire, gravy packet and water and just a TB of ketchup. The meat was delicious and flavorful with a nice sauce. I also used frozen veggies (peas and carrots). I followed the original instructions for the potatoes and kept adding more "stuff" because as they were the potatoes were extremely dry. I added probably a 1/4 cup of sour cream, 1/4 cup of milk and 3 tablespoons more butter. I just kept adding ingredients until it came to the consistency I enjoy. I also followed one suggestion of a sprinkle of paprika which was good. I used my Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator to pipe the potatoes evenly on top and make the presentation look professional. I also used a Deep Round Stone to bake nicely and keep in nice and hot when finished. Overall, very good but not the wow I was expecting after reading so many great reviews.

Very good.  I've made it a few times, and I think that adding 1/4 cup of worcestershire (as recommended by some reviewers) is too much.  I love it and use it often, but it really overpowers the dish.  I do like adding the gravy packet with the meat, but now limit the worcestershire to 1 or 2 T.  That said, it was a good meal on a cold night!

This was good. If I didn't add a packet of gravy mix. This pie would have no taste to it. SO DON'T FORGET TO ADD!! I also left out the beef broth. I also added a little more water. But it turned out good!

I added bugandy wine and worchester sauce.  I like vegtables so I diced up aspargus (daughter does not like peas) and Zucchini yellow and green type. For the topping I added sweet mash potatoes to make a bit healthier

My family RAVED about this meal.  I've made Shepherd's Pie a hundred times, but not quite like this!  My husband said he liked that the meat base wasn't as tomato-y as usual -- and I couldn't agree more!  It was SOOO good with just a hint of tomato coming from the ketchup.  The only thing I did differently with this recipe was add more veggies and some spices.  Along with the S & P, I put in some orgegano, garlic and a few red pepper flakes as well as 2 small zucchinis that I grated into the meat mixture while it was simmering.  Then, instead of mashing just carrots, I rinsed a bag of frozen mixed veggies that had green beans, carrots, corn and peas and poured that over the meat mixture, and then put the mashed potatoes on top.  It was so yumm!!  Forget my old recipe, this one is taking over!  Thanks Jacquie for a great, family pleasing recipe!!  P.S. -- I didn't even move this to a casserole dish -- I made the meat mixture in a deep skillet and just layered everything on top and popped it all in the oven which made clean up a snap! Thanks again!

Very good!  I added about 1/2 c. of milk to a saucepan with the butter and onion for the mashed potatoes.  I also added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the milk mixture and heated it for a few minutes before making the mashed potatoes.  I'll make this again!

This is a great base recipe, as are many on this site that I have tried.  Like other reviewers I changed a few things; surprise, surprise.  I used 1 lb. 93/7 lean ground beef, added a small diced onion, 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 8 oz. pkg sliced mushroom and sauteed.  Added 1 T. whole wheat flour, cooked a few minutes and then stirred in 3 T. worshteshire sauce, 2 T. tomato paste, and 1 cup beef broth.  Stirred in 1 cup frozed peas.  Added parm and fresh basil to potatoes instead of cheddar, delicious!

Great recipe! I double it and make it in a 9 x 13 cake pan. You can short cut it with 2 can carrots and 8 servings mashed potato flakes too!

Pretty darn good shepherd's pie (IMHO). It could have been more flavorful, but b/c it is so filling & simple to prepare, it's being added to my "keeper" file. Made this for dinner last night. My bf liked it, but he too had some suggestions for adding flavor. Here's what I did & what I'd recommend changing: a) followed reviewer Nicole's recommendation to add 2 T flour / katsup / worcestershire sauce, 1 pkg. beef gravy mix & 1 c. beef broth to the beef / onion mix. & simmered for 10 min., b) instead of sauteeing my onions in oil prior to adding the beef, I just threw them in with the meat, d) prepared a pkg. of instant garlic mashed potatoes (didn't have enough time to do it the 'ol fashion way), e) added approx. 2 T finely chopped onion & 1/2 c. shredded cheddar cheese to the potatoes & f) subbed 8 oz. frozen peas & carrots for the mashed carrot called for. To improve the outcome next time I'd a) saute the onionis in oil BEFORE adding to the meat (the onions need to saute in the oil to soften - they were a bit crunchy!), b) allow my meat mix. come to a boil first (or simmer longer to thicken more - my pie was a bit runny), c) maybe use 2 pkg. instant potatoes (there was too much meat vs. potato) and d) broil the casserole for a few min. to brown the cheesy top - YUM! Served w/ Buttered Biscuits (by Debbie Rowe) and a cold glass of milk. Thx. for sharing!

This recipe serves as a great starting place.  I prepared this a day ahead of time and baked it for about an hour (35 minutes covered, 25 minutes uncovered).  I added seasonings into every step to suite my own tastes and it turned out to be delicious!  I seasoned my beef with Worcestershire, garlic, Lawry's, and pepper.  I also added a clove of garlic to the carrots and potatoes as they cooked.  I prepared my mashed potatoes with onion powder, milk and sour cream.  This is a definite keeper on the comfort food list!

Really easy, and REALLY yummy! I tweaked it according to other reviews, like adding 2 cloves garlic among other additions. The recipe calls for "salt to taste" on the potato portion, but I felt it needed it on the meat mix too. Thanks so much - fam loved it!

My daughter loves this! I changed it up a bit like others suggested. I added the 1/4 Worcestershire sauce to the meat, didn't have beef broth so I added 1 bullion cube and a cup of water and about 1 tbsp of seasoning salt. I used 1 bag of Birds Eye frozen mixed veggies. I didn't have onion so I added green onions with the cheddar on top of the potatoes. I added about a half cup of sour cream and a tbsp of seasoning salt to my potatoes as well. Delicious!

This is a fantastic Shepherd's Pie recipe! I made it the first time exactly as written, and the second time I substituted ground turkey for the beef and added a can of creamed corn and some cooked peas over the carrot layer, just to get some extra vegetables in. My husband and I liked it even more with the turkey. Fabulous, quick and nutritious comfort food!!!

It is a keeper; I saved it in my recipe box. It‚Äôs reach, tasty, traditional, easy to make. It can satisfy the taste of any picky eater. Kids loved it! Even my little nephew, ask for second portion. However, I made some little changes. I added ¬º cup of Worcestershire sauce, 6 oz of frozen pees, garlic salt, garlic powder, and additional ¬º cup of shredded cheese to meat. I did not have ground beef available. So, instead I cut in very small cubes the same amount of chicken. The cut carrots I did not boil, but instead I cooked together with meat. I like when my Shepherd‚Äôs pie can keep the shape after it is being cut in pieces. So, I added 1 egg to mash potato. I did not sprinkle any cheese on the top, but it still came out beautifully delicious.  A+ dish!  Thanks, Jacque!

This recipe was so easy to follow, but instead of Ground Beef I used Ground Turkey and instead of beef broth I used chicken broth. I did take some of the suggestions from other users and added 2 cloves of garlic and added some worstershire sauce. My boyfriend is very picky about his Shepherd's Pie, but he loved this! Using the turkey was nice, less greasy and less fat!!!!

This was delicious! Did a couple things different. Saute'd the onions in butter before adding them to the mashed potatoes. Added about 8 oz of frozen peas and carrots to the meat mixture after it thickened, and cooked an additional 5 to 10 min. Also after cooking covered for 20 minutes, I uncovered the dish and sprinkled french fried onions on top of it and returned to oven for an addiotional 10 minutes. The perfect compliment! :)

Great recipe!  I've never had shepherd's pie, so this was a first.  I took the suggestions of some other posters (such as adding garlic & worcestershire sauce to the meat, and adding brown gravy mix).  I also used a package of frozen peas instead of carrots.  My husband LOVED this & could not stop eating!  I like how you can vary the recipe & put pretty much whatever you want in.  Will definitely make again!

Easy recipe to make and impossible to mess up. I left out the carrot layer and just stirred in a cup of mixed vegetables with the ground beef. I also used a sprinkling of onion salt in the potatoes instead of minced onion. You can easily substitute whatever vegetables you have on hand in this.

Delicious shepherds pie. I added two tablespoons ketchup and one tablespoon worcheshire sauce. It tasted a little bland in the end, so next time I'll add more of the worcheshire sauce to give it more of a kick. Also used a bag of frozen mixed veggies instead of the carrots. I thought the beef broth made an excellent sauce. Thanks!

I've never had mashed carrots, but they add nice flavor and color. I added peas and carrots (the picture looks like they did too), but this is one you can throw all the appropriate leftovers into!

Wow!  What a "KEEPER" this is!  My daughter wanted Shepherd's Pie for her birthday dinner, and I had never made one before.  Chose this one, and am I glad I did!  The family LOVED it and we're looking forward to it again soon.  I took some advice from others: used the 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce in the sauce, used a Franco American jar of beef gravy instead of beef broth, and a drained can of peas and carrots instead of the fresh carrots.  Also topped those veggies with a drained can of corn. Topped it all with real mashed potatoes just following the recipe here.  Probably a little more cheese on top than what it called for (twice as much because we love cheese). My, oh my...comfort food at its best!

I would just like to dispel the myth regarding Shephards pie and it is as follows:
When the English, who seem to have a national fascination with minced meat pies, combined mashed potatoes with minced meat, a truly remarkable dish was born. For over two hundred years, Shepherd's Pie has been made by cooking chopped up lamb or mutton mixed with gravy, topped with mashed potatoes, and baked until a crispy crust forms. When made with beef, this dish is traditionally called Cottage Pie.

I just needed to clear that one up, it was grating on this poor Englishman! Tasted ok though!

I modified this recipe, by more than doubling the cheese (including throwing cheese into the mashed potatos, along with a lot of garlic) and adding lots more spices.  Worcestire sauce helped alot.  The end result was great though. A big hit at home, and at parties

Made some small additions based on personal preference, but all in all I think this is a great starter recipe.  The original recipe was good but lacked the flavor I was looking for so the second time I added some minced garlic, corn, gravy granules, a splash of worcestershire sauce and some dried savory to mine.  I thought it turned out great!

I've made this several times now. My husband loved this.  I used left over pot roast and potatos.  Added a little extra milk to the potatos mixed it up and it turned out great. This is so versatile that you can use peas and carrots, potatos, corn whatever veggie you want. Thanks for the post.

Definite comfort food! Of course I made changes as follows: 1) Boiled carrots & potatoes together, but kept carrots separate by putting them in a strainer 2) Added garlic powder and some blue cheese dressing to the mashed potatoes 3) Added a clove of garlic when sauteing the onion 4) Added 1/4 cup worchestershire sauce when browning the meat 5) Added peas and the carrots to the meat mixture...Word of warning...this will most likely destroy your kitchen! I had dirty pots everywhere!

Nice and easy meal - I made up a packet of beef gravy with a cup of beer, and added some bell peppers and a clove of garlic.  Very hearty, but the quantity's a bit misleading - one full lot was just shy of enough for three hungry college boys :)

Wasn't too sure about the whole mashed carrots, but it worked.  Like so many others had suggested, I used 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce while cooking the meat.  I omitted the beef broth, but added 1 cup of water and an envelope of brown gravy mix.  I also increased the ketchup to 1/4 cup, and added garlic powder.  The next time I will add some corn (always crave corn with mashed potatoes).  I actually served the corn as a side dish, but ended up mixing it all together anyway.  I only had three potatoes, and that was plenty!  Added more cheese too-I love cheese.  There are so many different ways to adapt this recipe to your liking!

This was very good.  I did use the gravy instead of broth as recommended by so many others.  The flavor was quite nice.  My only complaint would be ALL THE DISHES!  Other than that, however, this recipe is a keeper!  Thank you!

Took a lot of work and I was a little bit worried about the ketchup but it tastes awesome.  I used turkey instead, but I don't think one pound was enough though, next time I'll use 2.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful and a hit at the potluck.  My husband who doesn't like Shepherd's pie, loved it.  I did make a little more gravy to the ground beef (1 1/2 x recipe).

My family LOVES this recipe as a base! We modified it to our tastes: no cheese; I‚Äôve tried mashing the carrots but don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs worth the effort; I mix canned corn, canned green beans, sliced carrots, and canned peas to the ground beef while it‚Äôs cooking (to soften the carrots) and then mix it all up. In the end we have a layer of beef with veggies under a layer of mashed potatoes with paprika over top. Also, I triple the recipe and put the assembled dishes in disposable foil tin containers, then freeze them for an easy comfort meal later! I freeze after cooking the beef and assembling the dish but before cooking again in the oven. Then, straight from freezer to oven - 350 or 400 for 40 min, then take the lid foil off for 20 minutes. You‚Äôll need to change your times based on the container size but since the beef was already cooked before you froze it, you‚Äôre simply reheating so don‚Äôt sweat it too much! This also makes an excellent dish to give to a sick friend or as a comforting bereavement gift. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

The kids loved this recipe and wanted to give it 12 stars.  I followed other reviewer's advice and added some Worcestershire to the ground beef while it was cooking. For vegetables, I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and mixed them in with the meat after it was cooked.  I also used 1 cup water and 1 envelope brown gravy mix. I used Bob  Evans refrigerator mashed potatoes for the top.

Delicious and so easy!
Short on time so I used instant mashed potatoes doctored up with some butter and a 1/4 tsp. of horseradish. Also, used beef base to make the broth, and made it a little stronger because I used  50/50 ground beef, ground turkey combo.
Husband loved it.

This was my first time making this and loved it. I used other suggestions and seasoned the beef with worstershire sauce and used 1 cup of water mixed with a packet of brown gravy instead of the beef broth. I also didn't have any potatoes so I used a packet of mashed potatoes and seasoned with onion and cheese like the recipe says. This will definitely go into dinner rotation. Simple but so yummy

First time making Shepherd's Pie and I nailed it thanks to this recipe!  Followed directions exactly.  Please don't review a recipe you have altered as it is not fair to the original poster!

Holy Cow!  I have never made a Shepherds Pie in my life but followed your lead and ended up with a great meal!  Used ground deer "burger" and otherwise did everything the same.  We ate, and ate, and ate!  Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow.  Even though it wasn't ground beef I still think it's five star... Thank you for a super recipe Jacquie.

This is the perfect dinner for the fall. This casserole is warm and comforting. I tweaked it a little by using Johnsonville sausage, which made this one tasty pie! I think it had a bit of a bangers-and-mash feel to it with the sausage. I love pub food, so this couldn't have been better!

So yummy!! I added a small layer of mushrooms that I boiled after the carrots.  I also added a small bit of garlic salt with parsley as I was mashing the potatoes.  We couldn't stop eating it.

An okay starting point but even adding garlic and worcestershire sauce, it was quite bland.  

I diced the carrots and cooked them with the onion rather than boiling and mashing and threw in some frozen peas.  Also, I didn't use all the mashed potatoes this called for.  

Next time I'd skip the cheese, not add onion to the mashed potatoes and spice up the ground beef mixture and I think it'll be worth adding to the rotation.

Very quick to make and so much Flavor, I used 1.25 pounds 80/20 ground chuck and added 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce to the meat before browning, 2 slices of a large sweet onion chopped.seasoned the beef with salt,pepper,Garlic salt from grinder, and steak seasoning grinder from Thompsons.I did Not drain the beef. Use the appropriate amount for your taste. My garlic salt grinder is 2/3 granulated garlic and 1/3 sea salt so it's mostly garlic. I also substituted a aldi brown gravy packet and 1/2 cup of water for the beef broth at the stage of adding the flour to the beef. I substituted 4oz each frozen pees and carrots to the top of the beef mixture, I had to chop crinkle cut carrots because I couldn't find pea and carrot frozen combo. Family loved it and it was very savory :  )I did finish the top of the potatoes with 2 tablespoons of melted butter and sprinkled with paprika for color before baking. there wasn't gravy in the bottom of the casserole pan but it was very moist and plated like lasagna
2 cents please :  )

I added the onions to the meat and added garlic to the potato (I love some spice) and used onion soup mix as seasoning and it was delicious. I love the layer of smashed carrots.....I never thought of that! Great great recipe! Thanks!

This was awesome. My family ate this up! I did use fake potatoes because it was a weeknight and I used canned peas and carrots.  I also used McCormick Brown Gravy and mixed it with a cup of water, worcestershire, ketchup and ground mustard and poured it over the beef after the flour.  It was really delicious.  Will make again and again!

I modified a bit: used brown gravy packets and added the ketchup to that. I made some extra so we could spoon it over the potatoes, too. Totally yummy!!!
Also, we're not pea and carrot fans, so I used green beans and corn instead. Everyone loved it!!!
Like - 2 or 3 hours later they were still talking about it and arguing over who would each the leftovers the next day. So going in my permanent recipe file!!!

This is a good recipe, but I added 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of tarragon to the potato part and everyone loves it.  I, also put tarragon in funeral potatoes and it's a hit...I guess potatoes and tarragon go well together, not sure as a baked potato, though, never tried that.

This was a great St. Patrick's Day treat. I added dry red wine, garlic and herbs to the beef, and included peas as well , and mashed a little chevre into the mashed potatoes.  Otherwise, I went by the recipe and it was great!

Instead of ketchup I will use tomato sauce...

First time making this dish EVER but it turned out to be a hit with my family! As many other people have mentioned, using a packet of brown gravy in replace of the flour and beef broth made a difference.  Others have also mentioned Worcestershire, however, I opted for A-1 steak sauce simply because I didn't have the other! I also used a few more spices when browning the meat including 'Hamburger' by Grill Mates. YUM!

Yummy!  Really good.  Made a few changes.  Added peas and corn along with carrotts and more seasonings.  Also added 3 tablespoons and milk to my potatoes.

This was great! As a child I hated shepherds pie but was sick of eating the same things & my hubby likes shepherds pie so I decided to give it another try & loved it!! I used red potatoes with skins on & added a scoop of sour cream to them. Then cooked some garlic in the meat mixture & added 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce to it. Instead of mashing the carrots I steamed them cut them up then mixed them with frozen corn, peas & green beans to top the meat mixture. Delicious dinner!!

I wanted to make a shepherd's pie, but needed some help with the ingredient ratios and cook time.  This recipe was perfect as a base.  Next time I will double the amount of carrots and take some liberties with the potatoes (garlic, cream cheese, splash of milk) to better suit my family's preferences.

This was so easy and tasted so good. I too used brown gravy instead of beef broth. I also substituted the carrots for frozen veggies. I think the next time I make it I will use creamy garlic mashed potatoes. Defiantly meant to be made in the colder months. Cooking this made my kitchen WAY to hot. Enjoy.

This recipe is 10 stars.  I've made a lot of shepherds pies over my live time but this one is by far the best.  I don't think it needs extra spices, I automatically add more pepper to everything so it was great.  The only thing I did differently was I put the carrots in the blender.

It was a good recipe.  I was hoping it would be a tad more tastier but then again maybe the beef broth I used didn't contain enough taste (salt).

Very hearty dish; I made some changes (hubby loved it):

1. I used boxed instant potatoes according to directions of 8 servings.

2. Margarine instead of butter.

3. Omitted cheese and ketchup.

4. Used frozen & chopped carrots and peas.

5. Olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

6. Ground turkey instead of ground beef.

7. Chicken broth instead of beef broth (because I used turkey).

8. Added crushed hot peppers to give it a kick.

9. Glazed the top of potatoes with a beaten egg to add color and a crusty layer.

I think I'll add some Chardonnay to the turkey next time too.

This Shepherd's Pie was excellent. It had great flavor and even reheated well. I made a couple of changes to suit our taste. One thing I did do was add a clove of minced garlic. I will definitely make this again.

My kids said "yum" =) However, I will double the ground beef next time as my kids are complaining that there's only few of it. To add more taste to this dish I added seasoned salt, onion powder, garlic powder, meat magic and 1/4 Worcestershire sauce suggested by the other reviewers. I also doubled the ketchup. Will do this again ... thanks Jacquie! =)

I have to be impressed with a recipe that contains potatoes and my hubby likes it anyway. Made it almost exactly as directed although used gravy mix and water, a little HP as suggested and threw in some mushrooms that needed using up into the meat mixture. Recipe made enough for dinner for two with some lunch leftovers so we are pleased as can be with this recipe. Thanks!

I hate when people change the recipe and then rate it, so here I go.  I used tri-tip, because that's what I had.  I cubed the meat (bite-size) then salt/pepper and added a 1/4 cup of Worcestershire.  Browned the meat w/the sauteed onions and garlic.  Added a bag of brown gravy and simmered until thick.  Poured into 13x9 dish. Added frozen peas/carrots mix.  Made mashed potatoes & added about 2 cups of shredded Dubliner(?spelling) cheese.  Spread the potatoes over the meat and topped w/with more shredded cheese.  Baked for 20 mins. @ 375 until golden brown.  Total hit!  Thank you for the recipe because I never made it before & the recipe gave me a guideline to make this wonderful dish.

This is the best Shepherd's Pie I have ever had. It turned out so great. The only thing I did different was I added pepperjack cheese on top then added french fried onions the lst 5 mins of cooking. Sounds wierd I know but omg it was yummy!!!Thanks for sharing!!

I have made this a few times now. I slice the carrots and add them to the beef mixture along with some peas or frozen mixed veggies or whatever I have on hand. I also make a little more mashed potatoes as my family enjoys them.

I was not a fan of Shepherd's Pie as a child, so was nervous about making this with my kids... had visions of tossing it and ordering pizza. However, we all had seconds! My picky son who doesn't like carrots even ate those. ;) By happy accident, I used Roasted Garlic instant mashed potatoes. It really added a nice flavor and with there not being any seasoning called for in the recipe, I couldn't do without it next time. I think the meat was good but again, more seasoning would have made it over the top. Very happy and will make again.

Great.  I would add a little more meat and a little less potatoes.  I also diced up the carrots after cooked instead of mashing them.  Still, great flavor, looks nice.  I may add a little celery next time as well.

This was pretty good. I didn't have potatoes so instead I used instant potatoes and I also added corn & a veggie mix with greenbeans, carrots, & potatoes & lima beans. I also cooked mine for 25 minutes then put in the broiler for about 3 minutes until golden brown & crisp. I like the top crisp and when using instant potatoes you need the extra help of the broiler. Will make again! Thanks!

This was a huge hit with my 2 year old, 5 year old twins and my husband - definately a keeper recipe, it will be going in my rotation of meals.  Thanks for the great recipe - I did add more cheese than called out, but rest of the meal I kept per recipe!

Very good. Unfortunately, I didn't have any onions, so just added frozen vegetables for extra "filling".  But yummy anyway.

I made mine vegetarian with Quorn (brand) crumbles to use as the beef. And as another person suggested, I also added (vegan) Worcestershire sauce. I used canola oil instead of butter and mushroom gravy instead of broth. Delicious, even my meat-eating husband and parents loved it!

Awesome! I did change a few things just to make it easier to make with a 16 month old running around...used brown gravy instead of beef broth, canned carrots and peas, instant potatoes, and 1-2 cloves chopped garlic to the meat. Added the shredded cheddar to the top only. I will be adding a little something next time to the meat to add a little more flavor, otherwise, my husband and I loved it. Thank You for posting this recipe!

I am only giving this four stars because it was a bit bland.  I did add Worcestershire sauce to it, but I think next time I will add more of it and I will definitely add more salt and pepper the meat when I'm cooking itl  Otherwise this is a great starting point and I will definitely make it again.

Everyone loved tonight's dinner!  Even my picky little guy who NEVER eats cooked carrots finished his plate.  My husband kept saying how light it was for Shepherd's pie - that he normally doesn't like it because it is too heavy.  

Minor modifications: I had some leftover butternut squash so I mashed it in with the carrots.  Used turkey instead of beef as that's what I had on hand, did as others suggested and added some worcestershire sauce and peas to the mix.

my Shepard's pie was the best! it probably modified a lot though. after seeing comments about the blandness of the meat... i thought 'meatloaf', but quick & fast. i bought McCormick meatloaf seasoning & followed directions on the pack, but i sub'd buttermilk for milk, & panko for bread crumbs & also put about 1/2 cup of onions & 3tbps of Worcestershire sauce. i spread flat onto 13" baking dish & cooked for 30min. i ground the meatloaf and spread even. for veggies, i used fresh carrots & green beans, boiled. i layered these onto the meat. i made a packet of beef gravy, poured on top veggies. sprinkled cheese on top, then layer my favorite slow cooker sour cream & cream cheese mashed potatoes (made day before) on top, sprinkled more cheese and a little bit of cayenne pepper for color & flavor. my boyfriend LOVED it & is asking when i'm making it again. he just said next time put more meat & veggies, so i'll use 2lbs. of beef next time & use corn.

I made this for my family a few nights ago.  They all loved it!  I made my pie with ground turkey to cut some of the fat down.  I really like the flavor that you get from the beef broth and ketchup mixture.  Try this one, you won't regret it.

The whole family liked this recipe, which is rare.  The only thing we didn't like was the carrot layer.  Maybe just less of it or slice them instead.   I added worcestshire sauce to beef and seasoned it a little more with small amount of boullion.  I also wanted more vegies so I added corn and peas on top of carrots.

Delicious. I used turkey burger cooked in onions, garlic and celery and added a touch of salt, pepper, thyme and marjoram. I also added one roasted tomato (skin removed and mashed up).

I thought it was good but I didn't like the carrots in it. I put peas and corn in it also. It was really good compared to the other one I found on this site. I just would leave the carrots out.

I used this recipe as a tool to create my own based on my family's tastes.  So if you don't want to hear what changes I made then don't read on.  I followed the recipe but added Worcestershire sauce, package of brown gravy instead of flour and about a cup of frozen peas to hamburger mixture.  Also, after I mashed the carrots I just threw it into the mixture.  I didn't measure the cheese so I probably used more like a cup.  This came out amazing.  Hearty, filling and a great way to sneak carrots into a dish.  My hubby & boys had second helpings.  We will be making this again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!  I am not a fan of people altering ingredients and then posting their opinion; however, I did make one change and I think it made a big enough difference to share it.  I boiled the carrots in a box of beef broth and saved that to later make the gravy with the hamburger. Doing this and adding butter while mashing them made the carrots tastier.

Would not make this recipe again.  Merely okay, very bland even though I used peas, carrots and green beans because I couldn't stand the thought of pureed carrots!  I notice the 5 star reviews are not based on the recipe as written but with additions/deletions/substitutions.  I think our dog will get the leftovers.

Added 1 TBS worcestershire to the beef mixture (along with s&p to taste) and used a bag of (thawed) frozen peas and carrots instead of fresh carrots. Omitted onion from the mashed potatoes - this was AWESOME!!!

This is a great dish. I speeded up the process by using instant mashed potatoes, frozen mixed veggies (thawed) and to the meat I added 2 tbsp worcheshire sauce and 1 packet dried onion soup mix. Took it for a church supper & am getting requests for the recipie. Thanks for a great recipie!

We had this for dinner tonight and enjoyed it, definitely better than the last store-bought shepherd's pie we ate! It didn't get the fifth star because I thought the meat mixture was a bit bland, even after I added thyme and worcestershire sauce. I think other reviewers' suggestions of adding a packet of gravy mix would be an improvement. I also used 2 cups of mixed frozen veggies (carrots, corn, peas, lima beans) instead of just carrot mash, that seemed to me like it would be boring. Still, this was quite good and I would make again!

This was a great base recipe to be tweaked to fit your individual taste. I cooked the ground beef and onions together, adding garlic salt and oregano. I omitted the ketchup and beef broth, and put in a can of tomato soup instead. I put this in a 9x13 pan, and then added a layer of chopped carrots instead of mashed. I did boil them beforehand to ensure they would be cooked enough. Then I layered a can of green peas, and a can of sweet corn. I mashed my potatoes with sour cream and rosemary, put this over the veggies and topped with shredded cheese. I know, so many changes- but it was incredible and well worth it!

I thought this was quite good, although I admit to a few changes.  I added worchestershire to the beef, onion, broth and ketchup, because we love the kick and it was quite flavorful. Instead of the mashed carrots, I used frozen mixed veggies, thawed, because we like more veggie variety and I used some butter and herb mashed potatoes for the topping. I'll be making this again!

This is the best most authentic recipe for Shepherd's Pie I have been able to find.  Most of the others include cream of mushroom soup, which is not what I perceive as traditional shepherd's pie.  I did make some modifications to suit my own tastes and to make it a little more like what my step mom used to make.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of beef, I used 3-4 heaping tsp of beef bouillon and 1/2cup water instead of beef broth and i used a can of condensed tomato soup instead of the ketchup.  I also added about 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  I also chose to chop up my carrots and mix it in with the meat instead of a layer of pureed carrots.  I also added oregano, sage, and thyme to the meat. For my mashed potatoes I added some milk and closer to 1/4 cup of butter and omitted onion just because I forgot.  I know it seems like a lot of changes but the concept and recipe is still virtually the same so that's why I gave it 5 stars.  My husband would like me to put some paprika on top next time for color and flavor.

my boyfriend (although of irish decent) had never tasted shepherd's pie before -- so i decided to wow him with this recipe (although i've never MADE shepherd's pie before). and lemme tell you, i chose the right recipe! i made a healthier version by: using 1 lb. ground turkey, 99% fat free beef broth, fat free cheddar cheese, i can't believe it's not butter-butter and skim milk (to mash with the potatoes). after reading some reviews i decided to definitely mash the carrots so i boiled them with the potatoes and mashed separately. after layering the carrots on top of the meat, i layered sweet corn and peas. the only health factor that we were conscious of was the carbs -- but regardless this dish is FANTASTIC!! so homey, hearty, and delish.

Just made this, family loved it!! Instead of boiling potatoes and carrots separatley, I threw them in the same pot to boil, the carrots will rise to the top and I used a slotted spoon to separate them from the potatoes. I also used a little more minced onions and cheese in the potatoes. I took the advice of another reviewer and added 1/4 cup of worchestire sauce and almost a can of gravy instead of the beef broth. It was soooooo good!

All in all really good and will make again. I did change some things from suggestions I read.

1 lbs ground turkey, 
2 Tbs Worcestershire sauce,
2 cloves minced garlic (from a jar),
1 can sweet corn,
1 cup sweet peas (frozen), 
mashed carrots.
I added more mashed potatoes than called for, so if I do that again I will double the ground turkey. (and no I could not tell it was turkey)

I followed instructions except I added a bit of worchester, browing seasoning and 2 cloves of garlic to the beef. For the potatoes I used red potatoes and left on the skins when I mashed them. Instead of mashing the carrots I used a shredder and then cooked them for 2 minutes in the microwave. Used about 1/4 cup of sour cream and some butter. Baked for 25 minutes. Delish.

I'm surprised no one caught the fact that there are instructions to make a gravy but the directions never tell you what to do with it (?).  I added it to the meat mixture - not sure if that was the right thing to do.   I think it needs more spices and perhaps a bit of sharp cheddar cheese.   It took me 2 hours from rinsing potatoes to serving.

Very good! I took the advise of other reviews and added 1/4c worstershire to ground beef and substituted 1c of water and a package of brown gravy mix for the beef broth. I used a package of frozen corn and carrots on top of beef. Next time I will use canned carrots because I like my cooked carrots a bit softer. I added sour cream to my mashed potatoes, as I always do. All my favorites in one dish...YUM!!!

I gave this a FIVE Star!  It was delish and easy.  I added peas, carrots (boiled prior to adding) and mushrooms.  Took the recommendation of others and added worchestershire sause and used brown gravy in lieu of beef broth.  I cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan and only had one small square left!    Thanks for sharing!   This is definitely in my recipe box.

This recipe was a hit with my husband, myself, and our one-year-old who is starting to get picky about what he eats.  I think that I must have used a little too much broth because it came out runny and I didn't cook my carrots before I put them in the casserole dish so I added some extra water thinking that the carrots might need this when they didn't.  I gave this a five because the taste is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I did add a tiny bit of garlic powder and beef bouillion granules, but beside that and homemade beef broth I pretty much stuck to the recipe.  My husband and I got seconds and this is going in his lunch tomorrow so I know that he liked it.  I would recommend this if you're looking for a meal that has a lot of vegetables that you would like the whole family to eat.  I will try peas in it next time to see if that works well also.

Good but not amazing. My toddler loved it, my husband and I liked it fine and will probably make it again when we have left over potatoes or hamburger. Instead of the beef broth I used the gravy mix and a cup of water. I think next time I will add mixed veggies and flavor the potatoes a bit more.

Very tasty! I usually buy Shepherd's Pie seasoning from the grocery store, but I don't think I'll have to anymore now that I've found this recipe :) It's a very simple straightforward recipe using ingredients that I already had on hand. I never (NEVER) used ketchup for my Shepherd's Pie before, but it actually gave the meat some sweetness and tanginess that I quite liked. I used ground pork (rarely use ground beef except for hamburgers) and a bit of Worcestershire sauce, as suggested by some. I think this'll be my staple recipe for those nights when we want some good old comfort food :) Thanks for saving me some money every week ^_^

This was quite good. Only added worchestershire sauce as recommended by other readers. I also nixed the mashed carrots and opted for frozen mixed veg. The last shepherd's pie I made had little flavour; I was happy to find one with great taste (the mashed potatoes were the best!)

This was my first time making a sheperd's pie & everyone raved!!!  I also made a few changes: I added 4 garlic cloves  to the potatoes (I used red potatoes w/the skin on) as they boiled then mashed as directed. . . I added about a quarter cup of milk too. I then added about 4 cloves of finely minced garlic, 1/2 a tsp of chili powder, a dash of worcestershire sauce, a dash of A1 sauce, and a tablespoon of sugar to the beef. I topped it off with just a sprinkle of Chili powder over the cheese for color, and a little kick!!  Will definitely make again!!!

This recipe was pretty good.  The only changes I made were I used my own homemade mashed potatoes w/ the added onion, I used frozen combination of peas & carrots, and I added a pack of beef gravy seasoning to the broth/ketchup mixture.  The family loved this one.

I thought this was pretty good, though I am not sure I would go to this recipe again or just try something else instead.  Kids liked it, dh thought it was ok.  Overall good but didn't knock my socks off.

Really good & comforting!  I was looking for a recipe to use up a ton of leftover mashed potatoes and this was perfect.  The only change I made was to use ground turkey instead of beef.

Awesome recipe for dinner tonight.  I cooked the meat and then added cooked, diced carrots and corn to the beef.  I spread the mashed potatoes over, sprinkled on the cheese and baked.  I broiled the last few minutes to get a nice crisp topping.  Everyone loved it and I do plan on making it again.

This was so good!!! My first time making Shepherd's Pie and I will never look for another recipe, no need! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers-used 1 packet of brown gravy with 1 cup water instead of the beef broth and added 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce to the meat. We aren't big cooked carrots fans so I added a cup of frozen corn/peas when I added the gravy. Delicious, thank you so much for a great recipe!!

I finally found a recipe that my husband repeatedly asks for and talks about. I did take the one suggestion to add the brown gravy packet/1 c. water and 1/4 worstershire sauce to the meat and the steamed mixed veggies instead of mashed carrots and it was AWESOME!! Def making it again. Served it with guinness and was a huge success.

This was good.  I used the brown gravy mix as suggested and corn instead of carrots.  The family enjoyed it!  I would plan on letting it sit for a half hour or so after cooking so it will set up otherwise, it's kind of runny when you try and slice it so allow for that time.

my family loves this one. Here's my take on it:

-2 tbs ketchup
-1/4 cup soy sauce or worcestershire sauce to the 1 - 1.5 lbs ground beef (or turkey)
-Added peas to the ground beef/turkey
-Added a little milk to the mashed potatoes for a better consistency
-Carrots take a bit longer to become tender
-Sprinkle powdered garlic, salt, and seasoning on top at the end (I used trader joe's 21 season salute)

this was an extremely tasty dish! I did however follow other reviews and added carrots, gravy mix, and worcestershire sauce. It was very moist and flavorful. I will definitely be making this again :]

No carrots because my husband's allergic, I used two handfuls of frozen peas sandwiched between the meat and the potato layers.  I also took other reviewer's suggestion and used a brown gravy package and one cup water instead of beef broth. I also added 1/4 c. Worcestershire to the meat. I've made this a couple times and the second time around I also added the following spices: 1 tea fresh ground peppercorns, 1 tbl dried parsley, 1/2 tea cinnamon, and 1 heaped teaspoon oregano. I loved these add ons! For presentation I added a couple pats of butter on top of the potato layer and sprinkled over with paprika!  Though the recipe was good when I stuck to the original recipe, these changes made it perfect for us!

Excellent. I'd never had nor made cottage pie (this is technically Cottage Pie, versus Sheperd's Pie as Shepherd's has lamb versus beef). It was great! The only changes I made to the orginal recipe was that I followed the advice of others and used 1/4 c Worcestire Sauce, and 3/4 c water and brown gravy mix to the meat. I also added some minced garlic to the onions when cooking them. For the potatoes, I added additional butter, minced garlic and whipping cream to taste and mashed them in the mixer to created a nice creamy whipped mashed potato. I did have to cook the carrots a lot longer than 15 minutes in order to mash them. I added frozen peas in a layer on top of the carrots before adding the potatoes. It was awesome. The whole family loved it! Thank you!

I took everyone's suggestions, adding Worstershire to the meat and garlic to the potatoes, but we still found it to be VERY bland.  We liked the idea of it, but it needs more flavor.  Hopefully we will find something to add extra flavor.

LOVE IT! I put the worchest. sauce and thyme in the beef. And put frozen corn and green beans as a layer between beef and potatoes. Just a a nerdy tidbit but, I've heard that if it has beef instead of lamb it's called a "cottage pie".

This was pretty good!  The only change I made was instead of using the beef broth I used beef gravy because thats what I had on hand.  I also added a little worcesteshire (sp?) to the meat mixture.  Next time I think I'll make the mashed potatoes my way to add a little more flavor!

I had to make this without salt, as husband and father-in-law are on low salt diets.  Of course it turned out rather bland.  Added about 4 times the catsup in meat layer, but still think it could have used a little perking up.  Maybe with some fresh, chopped tomatoes, mushrooms.  Added partially cooked mixed vegetables in between carrot and potato layer.  That turned out good.  Potato layer was rather lifeless, too, though.  Should have used milk to mash with potatoes, rather than water.  Low-salt diet isn't that much fun--you don't realize how much you do love that salt.  Update:  Tried this with salt substitute added and was much better--thus five stars.  Still added the mixed vegetable layer and mashed the potatoes with some added milk.  Is very colorful with the mashed carrot layer and the vegetables.  A meal in itself.

this recipe is fantastic for a quick make ahead supper the only thing i did different is added 2 tsp of italian seasoning. the next time i make this i will change out the potatoes for sweet potato and use a veggie mix as my family is not a big potato and carrot fan these days but every one did enjoy it and asked for seconds there was hardly any left over to take to work with me the next day.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We followed it exactly only we added the 2 T of ketchup and some worchestershire sauce as recommended and I'm glad we did it definitely added enough flavor.  This was very easy too and didn't take much time at all.

Good but could use more seasoning. Made as written but I did add small amount of frozen corn and pea for color. Mush carrots took a while. Next time I would just thinly slice the carrots. The carrot added a good flavor and its a must! Will make it again :)

Big, big hit with my teens!  After reading many of the reviews here, I subbed water and a packet of brown gravy mix for the broth and added Worchestershire sauce.  I also used frozen mixed veggies instead of the mashed carrots. Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed the suggestion of using gravy instead of broth and 1/4 c of Worcestershire sauce. Also added sour cream to potatoes. This was awesome. A great comfort food, and I usually don't like Shepherd's pie.

I have made this wonderful dish as written except for adding a little garlic and worcestershire sauce in the meat. You can also add some frozen peas to the pot after you cook the carrots for 10 minutes. I used broth and did not use a gravy packet (I do not keep it in the house - make my own gravy) because my family does not like the taste of gravy mix. The whole family loves it and so does any company that has eaten it.

I made pie following recipe exactly and it was dry...I see why so many reviews recommend adding gravy or gravy mix. If I make this again, I will add some.

Didn't love it, didn't hate it. I made it as is, except I added a little garlic powder to the meat and a little sour cream to the potatoes.  It still didn't have much flavor.  Next time I would probably listen to other reviewers and add Worcestershire sauce to the meat.

We really enjoyed this. I did take the advice of some other reviewers and used 1 cup water and brown gravy mix instead of the beef broth. I also added about 1/4 cup of worschestire sauce to the hamburger as I browned it. Instead of using mashed carrots, I microwaved a 16 oz. bag of frozen peas and carrots and poured them over the meat. I did end up added about 1/3 cup fat-free half and half to the potatoes in order to make them creamier. I also seasoned everything up with a little black pepper.

Excellent with the suggested addition of 1/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce.  Also, I just saut√©ed the carrots with the onions and didn't mash them.  I added frozen corn to the mix for more colour.

I always wondered what the secret to good shepherds pie was... Now I know it is the gravy.  This was spectacular.  The only item I changed was using 2 cups frozen mixed veggies instead of the mashed carrots.  It's a keeper.

Quite tasty. Like others, I made a number of modifications. As suggested by others, I added a packet of brown gravy and Worcestershire sauce (probably about 1/4 cup); upon tasting the finished product, I can't imagine not using something to give the meat some more flavor. Instead of butter, I used the water in which the potatoes and green beans were boiled to soften the mashed potatoes as well as a little bit of milk. Added chopped mushrooms and garlic to the onion before adding the meat. Boiled green beans and used those instead of carrots. Sprinkled Gouda cheese on top (it's all I had in the fridge). My mom and I both really enjoyed this dish.

I needed a fast recipe using the ingredients I had on hand. This recipe fit the bill. It was great. I did modify it somewhat. I used canned mixed vegetables instead of the mashed carrots and potatoes. I topped with instant mashed potatoes that I added garlic to. My husband and picky daughter loved it!

This was really good. I did think the direction to mash the carrots was odd... (Direction #2) I did not do that. Instead I just boiled the carrots until they were soft and added them to meat mixture. I also added a can of corn and a can of french-cut green beans. Since I added so many extra veggies to the dish I doubled the ketchup and added 1 whole cup of broth so that there would be more liquid. I also used a 3 quart pan instead of a 2 quart pan so that there would be enough room for everything.

Using suggestions found here, I made this recipe to rave reviews. I added worsteshire and a gravy packet to the meat mixture and peas to the carrot layer (using far less carrots than called for.) It was delicious that night and delicious reheated as well. My husband loved it.

I've never attempted shepherd's pie before but this went right into the recipe box. I added a little worcestershire as others had suggested and that was the only change needed. Big hit in my family!!!

This was a good recipe - easy to put together, comforting, and tasty. Like other reviewers suggested, I added worcestershire sauce to the beef and used a cup of water and a packet of powdered brown gravy mix instead of the beef broth. I also added frozen peas and carrots as the middle layer instead of the mashed carrots the recipe calls for. Thanks!

I have never had Shepherd Pie before only my husband. When I made it for my family they LOVED it. I made a few alterations to the recipe. I added 1/4 of Worcestershire Sauce to the meat and 1 cup of sour cream to the mashed potatoes. So good. I love it. This will be a added to our family dinner recipes.

Five stars with only a few modifications.  Second, substitute tomato paste for ketchup.  Third, substitute HP sauce for Worchestershire if you can. Fourth, add some frozen or fresh peas.  Fifth, take the time to make the proper topping of real mashed potatoes , as the recipe suggests.  Instant are just a really poor substitute.  This is a hearty dish, and good mash made with real potatoes, milk, and butter are the only way to go.  Enjoy!

This was very good! I did make a few changes though. When I cooked the meat, I added garlic, a little soy sauce, and cooked the onions woth the meat. Also, instead of mashing the carrots, I sauteed them in a little butter. Lastly, I added a thin layer of sweet corn and peas under the carrots. Yummy!

I opted for using brown gravy instead of beef broth.  I do not like cooked carrots, so I poured a can of corn and a can of green beans (both drained) on top of the meat.  I used steam in a bag potatoes and topped the potatoes with cheese.  It tasted great, and it took very little time to prepare.

Wow.. pretty easy and hubby likes it! I "jazzed" up the mashed potatoes by adding extra butter and seasonings, and next time I'll probably use less potatoes in general as they tended to the dominant ingredient.. but great recipe!! Will be making it again and again!

This recipe is one of my family's Favorites!!! Iv'e read most of the other reviews and made some of the same changes i noticed a majority of other people did...I cook the hamburger with seasoning. I also season it with Worcestershire sauce. Forget the part about boiling the carrots, I just add in a 1-2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables to the ground beef mixture before I put it in the oven! Muah! Delishioso :-)

It was really simple to make and while my husband loved it, I just thought it was very bland. Next time I'll add more spices to my liking. The upside was that even my kids liked it, and that is what counts here.

I loved this recipe but it needed quite a few changes. I read suggestions on how to improve the recipe and this is what I came up with. I used a brown gravy packet and a cup of water instead of the broth, added an extra 1/2 lb. ground beef because there was way more potatoes than meat. Added an extra tbsp. of ketchup. The potatoes needed some garlic powder, salt and pepper. After the changes it tasted like shepherds pie from a local pub.

This recipe was fine, but I didn't really find it to be particularly great tasting.  It was like a tomato-gravy sauced meat with mashed potatoes.  You can't really go wrong with meat and potatoes in my mind, hence the three stars, but it wasn't an amazing dish.

This is a great recipe and easy to follow. It turns out fabulous and delicious - especially when adding brown gravy mix and ketchup to the ground beef. I also added in extra vegetables like red and green peppers and mushrooms. Yum.

My picky family went back for seconds, it was so good! And very easy to make! I decided to use some frozen vegetables in place of the mashed carrots, but either way would have been delicious.

I had certain ingredients that I wanted to use before going bad, so decided to use this recipe.  After reading reviews, I didn't want to chance a "bland " dish, so decided to take some of the suggestions.  Here's what I did: First I boiled carrots (threw in extras) in salted water. Later mashed them with some butter.  Boiled potatoes (threw in extras) in salted water. Later mashed them with salt, pepper, butter, sour cream and two roasted cloves of garlic. Added shredded cheese to potatoes. Sauted finely chopped celery and small onion. Then added lean ground beef seasoned well with salt, pepper, two cloves of garlic minced along with Emerils Essence and some worcestershire sauce.  After draining grease, I put meat in a small rectangular cake pan sprayed with Pam (2qt). Put frozen peas and corn (defrosted in micro first) on top of meat.  Mashed carrots on top of veggies.  Mashed potatoes on top of that.  Then added more cheese and diced green onion on top before baking.  It was really good comfort food!

This is the BEST Shepherd's Pie recipe on this site and you DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT change anything. Forget the instant gravy mix comments to save time, you don't need it and quite honestly it doesn't taste as good. Just follow the recipe step by step exactly how its written above and it comes out perfect and delicious. I've made this more than 5 times over the past year and not once has there been left overs.

Awesome!I took others'suggestions and added more ketchup, a dash of seasoned salt,pepper,minced garlic and used Worchestire with the meat. I really liked the flavor of the meat. Often, in Shepherd's Pie that I have had the meat was always very bland.I layered a can of peas on top of the meat,and then the mashed carrots. Saving some time, I used two packages of cheddar/sour cream instant potatoes.Threw shredded cheddar on top and popped in the oven. With biscuits,dinner was a hit! Thanks!

And yes, we have a new favourite! I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use a tablespoon Worcestershire sauce in the ground beef mix, and I also seasoned it with salt and pepper. It was anything but bland. Also, I accidentally confused the cumin for pepper when seasoning. I realised it quickly enough (I had only used 1/2 teaspoon or so), but I am sure this made the ground beef even more delicious! Finally, I didn't mash the carrots. We were thrilled with the result, and couldn't stop raving about it. Thanks a lot!

I thought this was a really good recipe! I didn't mash the carrots, but added a 12oz bag of frozen veggies. My kids looked at the pictures and were NOT excited about dinner, but when they tried it they were surprised and said I could make this again. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe!  I used one pound ground turkey and one pound ground chuck to make it last a little longer.  I also added a can of drained peas and a can of drained corn.  I threw in some wors. sauce with the beef while it was cooking, and I think it gave it some nice flavor.  I added sour cream and some butter to the potatoes before I spread them on top, and then used fried onions on top of the cheese for some extra crunch and flavor.  Very good, pretty cheap, and the leftovers are fantastic (which is good - because I made a LOT!)  Thanks for a nice "cold-weather" recipe!!

I made the following changes as suggested by others: Made my normal mashed potatoes (with butter, milk and sour cream, I did not mix cheese in them).  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I sauteed turkey w/ onion (I use red onion), once browned I added 2 tblsns flour, 2 tblspns ketchup, 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce, 3/4 cup beef broth and 1 packet brown gravy w. 1 cup water.  Let that cook and thicken (simmered for 20 minutes or so)  Then I added 1 bag cooked frozen mixed veggies to meat mixture (corn, peas, green beans, carrots).  Poured mixture in bottom of baking dish, spread potatoes on top and topped with shredded cheddar/jack mixture.  Husband and myself LOVED it!   5 stars WITH changes!

My sister-in-law and I had to make food for 70 people this passed summer.We made Shepards Pie. When I make it I add 2 cans of cream of corn and 1 can of regular corn on top of the cooked meat. I also add cooked cut carrots on top of the corn. Then I cover the vegtable mixture with the mashed potatoes. I have't made it with cheese before but it was a great change, very good

Great recipe!  No need to mash the carrots.  I used 1.5 lbs of ground turkey, added 1 cup frozen peas, some minced garlic, 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce and doubled the cheddar cheese.  This dish is even better when reheated the next day or two.  I loved it!

Bland. I used the most helpful review suggestion by adding the gravy and Worcestershire sauce.  Not for our house.  Looks nice though.

The potatoes were incredibly dry and there was way too much of them. I tried doctoring this by adding 1 cup of milk to the potatoes to make them a consistency that could be spread but this was still much drier than I've used before when making shepherd's pie and, of course, got even more dry in the oven. I also wondered about the blandness of the meat and onion mixture, so I added corn, peas, salt and pepper - to no avail as it was still too bland. I can't even begin to imagine how bland this would be if I hadn't doctored it a bit. The recipe should also call for at least twice as much cheese in and on top of the potatoes. With the quantity of potatoes I wound up with and the addition of the extra vegetables I had enough for 2 8x8 Pyrex dishes. I'm giving this 1 star, which I've never done, because my family did not care for it all.

Shepherd's pie is one of those meals that I often fall back on when I am pressed for time because it requires ingredients I always have and that can be quickly assembled. This recipe had some variations I never tried before, e.g., I usually don't add cheese. This meal turned out very well, and the changes I made (due to preference, what I had on hand, and time considerations) were: mozzarella instead of cheddar, a few pressed garlic cloves in both the beef and the potatoes, veg. broth instead of beef, frozen corn and peas instead of carrots (around 4.5 cups), and slightly more than the required amount of potatoes. Everything fit nicely in a 2.5 qt dish.

This recipe was a *lot* of work.  The end result was okay.  Spreading the mashed potatoes  was difficult.  I won't make this again, but if I did I would put some milk in the potatoes to help them spread easier.  & It definitely took me longer than 50 minutes from start to finish. It took more like 2 hours.

Excellent!!!! Great for fall or winter.  I used 6 red potatoes.  I used others suggestion and boiled the carrots and potatoes together, and mashed w/ about 2 Tbl. of sourcream.  I sauted the onions and garlic in olive oil.  I used ground turkey, and added 2Tbl of Worcestershire sauce.  I layered w/ the meats mixture, then a light layer of frozen peas, and then the mash potatoes/carrot mixture.  I would not change a thing with doing the recipe this way.  Thank you everyone for your excellent suggestions.

I really loved this recipe but did add a couple extras to the mix. Since my husband loves anything/everything with some 'spice' to it, I added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes w/jalapeno's (drained) to the meat mixture which meant a bit more flour was needed to thicken the mixture. The final additions were corn and peas (frozen peas work best, since they're more crisp/sweet then canned)Will definently make again..PS; no need to cook onions in oil B4 adding gr. beef, just cook all together, beef has enough 'fat' to cook it with.

Very good recipe!  I made minor changes that I don't think had any major affect on the overall recipe.  I didn't have much ground beef left, so I mixed it with ground turkey.  I also didn't have any beef broth, so I just used water.  I was also low on ingredients, so I mashed the carrots roughly together with the potatoes to add bulk. (Pretty!)  And, to make it a bit more healthful, I threw in about a cup of steamed mixed veggies, and added cheese to each layer (a little /less/ healthful, but tasty nonetheless).  Very nommy.  Boyfriend polished off over half of it tonight. =D  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the other reviews I made the following changes:  1/8 c. Worchester Sauce and 2 minced garlic cloves added to the browned ground beef, boiled the carrots and potatoes together to make a mixed mash, added a can of corn between the meat mixture and the mashed potatoes/carrots (creamed corn would have been better but it isn't available here).  It was as good as the one that my aunt used to make!  Thanks for the keeper!  I'll be adding this recipe to my file and making it often!

I made this tonight with ground venison!
I utilized the previous people's suggestions and used 2 cloves of garlic, chopped and a packet of brown gravy with 3/4 cup water.  I used carrots, sliced, not mashed, and corn and peas (son picked the vegetable)
used a mexican mix of shredded cheese.
was so yummy.
lots of pots...nice for something totally different but I think this is great if someone is using leftovers.
next time i have mashed potatoes left over, i'll make this but dont' think i'd go through the whole effort without leftovers.   but hub liked it alot...his mother made a recipe with stewed tomatoes and he thought he hated shepherds pie until tonight.

I made this over the weekend made the following changes:

1.  Omitted the carrots (cause I don't like cooked carrots).
2.  Added a good shake of seasoning salt to both the cooked potatoes and browned ground beef.
3. Doubled the amount of ketchup.

This recipe is defintely a keeper!

My husband LOVED this.  I did follow others suggestions though.  I added Sour Cream & Green Onions to the mashed pototoes, omitted the carrots, added a 1lb bag of mixed veggies, a whole 14.5 oz can of beef broth and 1/4 cup of Worchesterie.  It was awesome!!

Excellent and quick meal.I too made healthier changes to the recipe, to cater to my Slimming world diet.I used 2 white & 2 medium sweet potatoes, Low fat cheese, 2x   small individual microwave steammix veg packs. I didn't use beef and used a meat substitue ( quorn-350g). I only used 1/8 cup of wocester, as I thought it would need help on the taste. 2 tbs of ketchup, and 1cup of gravy. I also didn't use the oil to cook the onion and the 2 cloves of chopped garlic I added, I used a low calorie cooking spray ( fry light in the UK) I made the recipe as instructed, but insted of adding butter I used a low fat margarine, and all the cheese, as i am always fearful of the top catching. But it was lovely. Very colourful and flavourful. I put the food in three individual remkin dishes so I can pull them out as I want them without having the full lot of food.Great recipe.

Hearty!  Used the water/gravy mix combination instead of beef broth, still added the ketchup.  Made it up in the afternoon and baked it in the evening.  Definitely tasty and worth the time to mash the potatoes and carrots.  A keeper.

I like this recipe, the only thing I changed was instead of using beef broth and ketchup, I used an envelope of dry brown gravy mix. I wasn't sure if I'd care for it as much with a tomato flavored "broth" in the meat.

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I added a packet of brown gravy mix to 1 cup of water (instead of 3/4 c. beef broth) and stirred into the browned meat mixture, and then let simmer for 5 minutes or so. Instead of the carrots, I added one can of veg-all.  To the mashed potatoes, I added sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, bacon bits and chives.  I layered the meat, the veg-all, and then the mashed potatoes and topped with more cheddar cheese and chives.  It was great and had a wonderful flavor!  My husband went back for seconds and then ate the leftovers the next day for lunch!

Delicious. I also made the following changes as suggested by the previous reviewers: I sauteed a diced onion and several cloves of garlic in butter. Before adding the beef I scooped out almost 1/4 cup to add to the mashed potatoes ( mash 'em any way u like- I used sour cream and a little butter). I skipped the boiled carrot step by substituting 1 can each (well drained) of sliced carrots, Bread and Butter corn and sweet peas. I skipped the beef broth and ketchup as well, using 1 package of Knorr's brown gravy mix with 1 cup + a couple TBSPS of water. I also used more cheese than the recipe calls for ( hey why not), putting a thin layer over the beef layer in the baking dish before layering the 3 cans of vegetables. I baked it for about 30 minutes at 350F due to the glass dish and this came out unbelievably good. Rave reviews from the whole family! This is a very versatile recipe so don't be afraid to spice spice spice!

oh my freaking DELICIOUS!! This is sooo good! I used turkey instead of beef but eveything else was the same. I have one son who hates cooked carrots and even he loved it. This is going to be my new shepherd's pie recipe. I'm throwing my old one out.

Yummy!  I used corn & peas instead of mashed carrots because thats what my family likes better. I boiled 3 cloves of garlic w/ the potoatoes and mashed them together.  Even better as leftovers.  THX.

Really tasty and very simple. I didn't have beef broth so used I boullion cube disolved in water. The flour is critical to this recipe as it gives the meat a creamier and wonderful texture. My kids loved it too. Definitely a keeper.

I made this wonderful pie with a few additions- I added celery and red and yellow diced peppers to the onions and beef- the beef sauce was a little bland so I added a tbl of worsteshire sauce and a tbl of steak sauce.  Wow- what a differce!  I made an extra one for a friend- just home from the hospital and she called it a Gourmet Shepherd's Pie! I also really liked the mashed carrots in the middle- I will be making this more often!

Best Shepherd's Pie I've ever had. I used mozzarella cheese, topped with parmesan, because we didn't have any cheddar on hand. Also, didn't have a 2 quart casserol dish, so used a deep 5 x 9 dish instead.

I love Shepherds Pie and this recipe was just as good as any I have had before. I made it per the directions except I used 1 lb of ground bison instead of ground beef. The meat could have used more salt and after reading the comments I would def add the worsteshire sauce to help with that. The potatoes were a little dry and next time I will mash them with more butter and milk in them. I love the idea of the carrot layer and next time I will add some peas to it. Thanks for the recipe!

I made a few changes but thought the overall outcome was fantastic! I used about 1.5 lbs ground beef and cooked it with some onion and garlic.  I added a little too much worcestershire sauce before cooking - which I'll adjust next time (I used about 1/4 C or a little more) Added a little too much flour so I used about 2 C beef broth which still yielded a very thick consistency.  I added about 2 C frozed mixed veggies (peas, carrots, corn and green beans).  I made a more standard mashed potato but though there was a reason to keep it dry so I cut back on the usual butter and milk I use. The potato got a great, light crust on top (where it wasn't covered in cheddar) and it all blended very well together. A nice, hot, creamy and delicious comfort food that reminded me of my mom's more plain version.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great base recipe! I took a lot of advice from other reviewers and added the worcestershire sauce, doubled the ketsup, boiled 3 cloves of garlic with the potatoes and mashed them in, added a dallop of sour cream when I mashed the potatoes, did NOT mash the carrots (chopped them), added a little corn and cooked fresh (leftover) green beans and added 3 cloves of minced garlic when I cooked the onion. I do not like brown gravy or brown gravy mix, so I just added extra beef broth and it was great. The kids really liked it!

I thought this would be way too heavy but not too bad at all. I did make some changes: I used 1/4 cup Worsteshire sauce and 1 cup water with brown gravy mix as suggested by others. Next time I would still add additional garlic and herb seasoning. I added boiled sliced carrots along with a pea,corn and carrot frozen veggie mixture on top of the meat. What really made it was the mashed potatoes as I prepared as I always do. I boiled red potatoes and when done mashed with butter, light sour cream, buttermilk, seasoning salt, pepper and no salt garlic and herb seasoning to taste. Whip with beaters instead of just mash. Makes a huge difference in the overall flavor! Good with chuchilla sauce. Will make this for St. Patrick's Day every year.

This recipe is great!!! I made a slight variation by adding a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce. I had never had shepherd's pie and my Irish husband asked me to try making it. He was impressed!

With some modifications to make this vegetarian, it turned out great! I substituted the ground beef with soy crumbles and the beef broth with vegetable. This recipe definately requires you to multi-task and dirty some dishes, but it's worth it. I added some celery (to the onions) and some frozen peas to make it a more nutritious meal. Best when served with ketchup and/or gravy. Even though I wasn't cooking with beef, I added a splash of vegetarian Worcestershire sauce based on recommendations (never really used it before). This is definitely comfort food. I recommend this recipe.

I love this and my husband and kids said it was okay.  Wished they shared my good taste/judgement.  I sauted all the onion and then just kept one tbsp. back for the potatoes and added extra milk to balance off the drying out from baking. I also added the flour to the cooked beef, then the broth and one pkg. of Knorr beef gravy pkg. I plan on making it again.  Make sure you really drain the gound beef.

3.5 stars.  Better than average but definitely could use some improvement.  (1)  The potatoes either need to be cooked longer or mixed in a mixer.  As is, the potatoes were too hard to mash and so I ended up with lumpy mashed potatoes on top.  Also, even though I added worstershire sauce to the ground beef, it still came out a little bland.  I might add some brown sugar and more ketchup next time.  Overall, a good dish, but not one I will be making all the time.

This is one of my familys favorite meals since I found this recipe several years ago! I have changed a couple things,though.I add some gravymaster to the ground beef mixture.I always make extra mashed potatos for the top.I usually make in a 9x13 and double the meat and veggies.I never mash the carrots I just steam them and mix them with the meat.I have added other veggies..ie..green beans ,peas..etc

Great recipe, though I made a few changes.  I doubled the flour and broth to make more "gravy", added the 1/4 cup Worcestershire as recommended by others, mixed in some peas and carrots instead of doing the carrot puree step, and added sauteed mushrooms.  Also, I mixed grated cheese and sliced green onions into the mashed pototoes (yes, I added milk to the potatoes). Made ridges in the potatoes with a fork for better browning.  I took this casserole to friends who had just had a baby--everyone loved it except their finicky 4 year old, which was somewhat expected.

Really good. I used canned corn instead of carrots, although I'm sure it's good with carrots as well. I followed the recipe otherwise. My picky husband told me it was as good as his mother's.

This was a great recipe.  My husband love's shepherd pie and I decided to make it for him.  I followed the recipe somewhat....I added more ketchup and some A1 sauce, I also added some mixed vegetables and a can of sweet corn.  We both loved it.  The meat and "sauce" was tasty.  I will be cooking this again!

My hubby and I love this recipe!  I use two cups of frozen peas, carrots and corn instead of doing the cooked carrots, just to save on time, plus it adds some nice color to the dish.  I also add a big spoonful or two of sour cream to the mashed potatoes to make them a little creamier.  Great comfort food and a good way for the kids to get their veggies!

I have been looking for a Shepherd's Pie recipe that wasn't too complicated and this is a good one!  However, the minute you substitute ground beef for ground lamb, this dish becomes a Cottage pie, and typically neither dish is prepared with cheese, so I omitted it.  Either way, this recipe turns out a very tasty casserole -- however the potato meat ratio was a bit off.  I'll take the credit for this, as I think my potatoes were on the larger size.  I followed the other reviewers and mixed 1 package brown gravy with 1 cube bullion in 3/4 cup of water with the meat.  The flavor was spot on, but I had to drain the meat prior to adding it to the casserole dish.  Also, before adding the potato mixture, I covered the meat generously with frozen peas and carrots.  Next time I will add 1/2 pound more meat (or only use 3 potatoes), cook it for 20 minutes at 400, and then broil the dish for 3 minutes to make the top nice and brown.

This was good, although lots of clean up  I forgot to add the ketchup but not sure if it was needed.  I used the potato water to mix with Oxo for the  broth - the carrot water would add more nutrients.  Everyone seemed to like it.

I scaled this recipe for 30 to take to my daughter's Brownie troop event, where our booth was about Ireland. We gave each child a "taste" of Ireland. There are about 100 girls at the event and they all loved it. Of course, I had to change the recipe a bit. I used a huge bag of frozen "Veg-all" and mixed it into the browend hamburger meat instead of smashing carrots. I didn't have time...but I did boil and mash real potatoes, with the skin left on.  It was great! Thansk!

This is a great recipe.  I replaced the beef broth with brown gravy mix.  I also used potato buds to save time.  The mashed carrots added a nice sweet flavor to the mix.

Very good, although i replaced the carrots with a can of corn.  Used gravy mix instead of beef broth.  Very easy & fast clean up as i used leftover mashed potatoes too!

Excellent, easy recipe for a delicious one-dish dinner.  I boiled the potatoes with the carrots so I wouldn't have a ton of pots to wash, and I made regular mashed potatoes (with milk, butter and salt) and then added the cheese, since I felt the recipe potatoes sounded a bit dry and flavorless.  I followed the suggestion to use brown gravy mix and 1 c. water instead of broth, and I added frozen mixed veggies in when I cooked the meat.  I think those two additions made the flavor of the meal.  I added 2 T. of ketchup but I think 1 would have been better.  The mashed carrots added such a nice flavor to it.  It was easy to serve, the meat wasn't messy or watery at all.  Even my picky husband loved it.  I have a feeling it will be even better the second day.  I will definitely be making this again, and often.

YUMMY!!  This recipe was quick and easy to prepare.  It was a real hit with my mom which is saying a lot!!  I used green onions in the potatos because I like the flavour and added Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture for a little added kick.  I will definately make this again!

If you like flavor, then try what I did:  I cooked a little chopped onion, garlic, and a half of a hot Hungarian pepper chopped fine in oil until onion became translucent. Then I added the ground beef, some seasoning salt and black pepper.  Next, I added a jar of Beef Gravy and simmered that for a while. This makes the mixture bind better and adds so much flavor.  I spread it in a casserole and then added chopped and cooked carrot and blanched some frozen peas.  Then I topped the casserole with the mashed potatoes. Great!

This was so yummy!  I did modify the recipe a little bit though.

I put onions, sour cream and 1 cup cheddar cheese in the potatoes. I substituted squash (chopped & sauted in butter) for the carrots...I only used 1 bag though and will definately use 2 bags next time. (Oh, I also put sauted onions in the squash mixture and added salt, pepper and sugar to taste.)  Thanks for submitting a wonderful recipe!!

This was AWESOME!  A definite addition to my family recipe book.

I, too followed the advice to cook the potatoes and carrots together, then mash separate.  I made a double recipe.  Instead of beef broth I used 2 beef bouillon cubes in 1.5 cups water (double recipe) with a little more ketchup. The only other thing I changed was the potatoes- I added more margarine and some light sour cream. I was a little worried about the onion in the potatoes, but it blended right in without being strong, and it was a STRONG onion! We didn't have any leftovers.  My 4 year old kept asking for more and I also got rave reviews from my husband and Brother in-law.

Next time I may try to use less margarine and maybe some chicken broth or fat free buttermilk in the potatoes so I can eat more!

This dish is very easy to make and very tasty.  To save a little time in both prep and clean-up, I cooked both the potatoes and carrots together, then seperated them to mash.  I also added garlic to the beef and a dash to the potatoes...you can never have too much garlic!  Also, a little more ketchup.  Very tasty and easy to make...this one goes into the favorites!

Added 1/4 Worcestershire sauce and a brown gravy packet to meat.  I think 4 large potatoes may be too much.  I'll try 3 next time.  I'm also considering adding garlic to the potatoes, and possibly a side of brown gravy to top on serving.

My husband's Irish mom made him shepherd's pie when he was a wee little boy. After 28 years of marriage, I decided to make it. He LOVED it! More importantly, he loved it more than his mom! I changed a few things to make it ours. To the potatoes I added about 1/2 tbl of onion powder, butter, cheese, salt and pepper. To the sauteed onions, I added about 1 tsp of minced garlic. I had to use 2 tbl of oil for the onions and garlic, 1 tbl was not enough. I felt the meat was a bit bland, so I spinkled some onion and garlic powder and about 1/2 tbl of worcestershire sauce. I also used 3 tbl of flour, not two. I sprinkled frozen peas and carrots on top of the meat, because the other way is just too time consuming. We felt that there was not enough meat. So next time I'll try 2 pounds of meat. I also added more than 1/4 c. of cheese to the top of the mashed potatoes. My husband devoured it. Will be making it for this upcoming St. Patty's Day!

Delicious! Based on the recommendations of other reviewers (and what I like), I added 1/4 cup of worchestershire sauce to the beef along with a packet on brown gravy mix, 3/4 cup of water (could do a bit less), and some minced garlic. I left out the ketchup. I also added a bit of salt and pepper to the meat and the mashed potatoes. Properly spiced, this Shepherd's Pie is outstanding and makes great leftovers!

I made this recipe. The only things that I did different was add frozen corn while the broth and beef were simmering. I added minced garlic, fresh thyme and oregano. In all, what a great recipe.

This recipe answered a question that I've had about Shepherds Pie; How can I make the ground beef more saucy. This recipe uses beef broth. Hmm, good idea. Read some of the reviews and some people suggested a package of brown gravy mixed with a cup of water. Oh yea, that's the way  I'm making it from now on.  As for vegetables, you can use whatever you like.

This recipe gets 5 stars but only based on all the changes the other reviewers made, which i definitely appreciated! I omitted the beef broth and instead added 1/2 cup worsesterchire sauce to the meat as it was almost done browning, then added 2 tbsp ketchup, 2 small cloves of minced garlic, 1 packet of 50% reduced sodium brown gravy, 1 cup of water, and the flour as the recipe calls for and allowed it to thicken a bit. 
As for the potatoes, 4 large were too many for me. I could've easily gotten by with 3 as I had some leftover. I didn't follow the directions in the recipe for the potatoes, instead, I made these based on how i'd typically make homemade mashed potatoes - milk, lots of butter, and salt and pepper to taste, then i added the 1/4 cup of cheese.
And instead of the carrot mash, I used frozen peas, corn, and carrots and put a layer on top of the meat before topping off with the mashed potatoes in the casserole dish. Finally, when it was ready to go in the oven i put a thin layer of cheese on top and cooked it at 375 for about 25-30. Delicious!

This is my favorite shepherd's pie recipe. I love the mashed carrots in it. I add frozen mixed vegetables to the meat mixture and sausage and use a Hawaiian BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. I add garlic and sour cream to the potatoes and put the cheese on top instead of in the potatoes, but it's good both ways. I know I add a lot but  the  first time I make something I always follow the recipe then add to it or substitute until I get it perfect for my family.

I loved this recipe. It's a huge hit with my family, co-workers, and fiance'. The one thing I did change was that rather than cooking with the broth, I opted to use Guiness Draught instead. This gave it a very deep flavor!

I did modify the recipe..because you do NOT use ketchup in Shepherd's Pie!  I used HP sauce which is readily available in most grocery stories; it is a British 'sauce' similar to A1, but not quite and we actually prefer the HP.  Didn't have carrots, so I used frozen mixed veggies, thawed, in place of the carrots..Which turned it into Cottage Pie, as my Brit cousin and his friends informed me, but it was good!  It will be made again..

My husband is British so I was a bit trepidatious about making this dish. I used cream cheese, butter and fresh garlic in the mashed potatoes. WOW! Also mashed some heirloom carrots and threw in some sweet frozen peas. This dish was amazing!

I made it with the changes Scouts suggested except I used A1 sauce instead of Worcester sauce since I didn't have any.  Excellent taste and a wonderful gravy.

I've made this recipe probably a dozen times since I've discovered it and it's definitely one of my favorites. A few small tweaks to the recipe for my preference:

I substitute gravy powder for the flour for the thickening agent.
I eyeball a bit of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture while it's simmering with the thickening agent.
Instead of mashing the carrots, I add in fresh diced carrots, peas and corn to the ground beef mixture close to when you transfer the mixture into the casserole dish. 
Lastly, instead of sprinkling the cheese on top before putting it in the oven, I allow it to bake for the 20 minutes, then add cheese afterwards, throwing it into the oven on broil for about 5 minutes to give a slight crust to the cheese and potatoes. 

I really do enjoy this recipe quite a bit. Had some friends over that also enjoyed it. I do recommend!

All the elements are here for a great classic.  A few tweaks:  if you have kids that balk at 'mashed carrots', leave them out, or at least reduce by half the amount (might just use cut carrots rather than the mash)... or as others have suggested swap in peas and corn for the carrot.  Gotta get the mince to potato proportion right.... go bigger on the mince.  And be generous with the broth.... I found the 5 minute reduction, even on a slow simmer, used up a lot of the yummy sauce that makes mince sing... you need that gravy.  Added a few rosemary leaves to the mince when reducing, once more to bring home the classic shepherd's pie character.  Cheese on top could be replaced with a drizzle of butter, and end with a minute or two under the broiler to brown to perfection.  All the elements, just tweak it, and enjoy!

Wonderful! I did not mash the carrots but parboiled and diced them instead. I left out salt as a flavoring because I used instant mashed potatoes. And I added a Anaheim chili for flavor.

The prep time is very misleading. Takes longer than 30 minutes.  It turned out fine, but was not worth the afternoon spent in the kitchen!

Terrific flavor and was a huge hit!!  I read some of the other reviews and took pieces of suggestions here and there.  The only negative to this recipe is the prep time.  Prep time is definitely way over 30 minutes!

I made this for dinner tonight. Everyone liked it, adults and the kids. I used baby carrots which I cut in half along with the onion and cooked them with the hamburger. I also added frozen peas right before putting it in the casserole dish. I used the ketchup and beef broth as the recipe stated and not gravy and I am glad that I did. It turned out very good.

It was good overall, but having never had Shepherd's Pie before, I was not expecting it to remind me of meatloaf.My husband loved it, though. He'd give it 5 stars.

Made this last night for a bunch of college kids we have over every week. I followed the recipe exactly, except added some Worcester sauce as some others did. Now, I like pretty bland food. I'm not big on tons of spices. I like the simple taste of the foods you are cooking. But this recipe was even way too bland for me. It needed something to liven it up. I added more salt and pepper before putting it together thinking that would be the ticket. But it wasn't. It was just boring. Maybe some marjoram? It is a good base recipe, but it does need something more. Just not sure I'm going to be making it again to find out what it needs.

I used this recipe as a guide not following it so much,  but we all enjoyed it, and will make again. My husband would like me to try it with turkey next time. Four stars since I didn't really make the recipe. 

I used Yukon Golds for the mashed potatos; cooking water,  2% milk, and a good dollap of butter. Someone gave me a bunch of flavored sea salt, so I added a good amount of Hawaiian bamboo jade, and lots of fresh cracked white pepper.

I cooked the carrots in the potato water and mashed lightly so they were still chunky. 

I slow cooked a large white onion so it was almost translucent then partilally carmelized. Added the beef and cooked; a couple pinches of flour, the beef broth (reconstituted crystals). I did use the ketchup (probably tomato paste next time), plus a bunch of shakes of Wosteshire, and a couple shakes of a Louisiana hot sauce. Both fresh cracked black and white pepper,  and some garlic medley sea salt. I thin sliced, then lightly chopped, 3/4 of a small head of green cabbage, and added it to the beef, and cooked another few minutes. 

I layered half the beef mix, all the carrots,  the rest of beef mix, and typed with the potatos.

The eight year old enjoyed it too.

this is bland. Too much potatoes and not enough seasoning, it needs milk, more butter, something. They came out so dry. I made this exactly as the recipe states and was so disappointed. Won't make again.

I incorporated Sciota's suggestions and added a dash of Rosemary and thyme. I used cauliflower mash because I cannot have potatoes. There were no leftovers! My husband was practically licking the dish.

This recipe is a keeper! I used suggestions from other reviewers such as cooking the meet with Worcestershire and substituting brown gravy for the beef stock. Everyone who has tried this has been blown away. I'm not a great cook but can fool people with this recipe!

I lived this recipe but changed a few things.  After cooking the meat I added a can of cream of mushroom soup (no water added) I layered the meat then cream corn, cooked carrots and cheese.  Topped with real mashed potatoes and sprinkled with salt an pepper.  Baked 375 for 1/2hour! It was delicious!!!

This is an excellent shepherd's pie. My husband, who claims not to like shepherd's pie, couldn't get enough of it, and my two young ones ate it well too. I had a bunch of leftover veggies, so I threw them all into the veg/meat mixture: 1/2 onion (chopped), bunch of baby carrots (sliced), mushrooms (sliced), green onions (green and white parts, chopped fine). I also added approximately one cup frozen corn and let it cook with the other veggies. I then added 1 lb ground beef, 2 T ketchup, 2 T flour, 1/4 c worcestershire sauce, 1 packet of mushroom gravy mix, and 1.5 c water. Once everything was cooked and the sauce thickened, I poured into a greased pan, scooped the potatoes (I already had mashed potatoes leftover in the fridge), dotted with butter, sprinkled with shredded cheese (Mexican blend), and ta-da! amazing shepherd's pie!

Made this for a Thanksgiving potluck. My casserole dish was scraped clean by the end of the night. Followed some other reviewers recommendations and used brown gravy instead of beef broth, and threw some Worcestershire in with the ground beef when it was cooking. Also used a mixed frozen veggie pack in place of mashed carrots. Everyone really enjoyed this and I will definitely make this again.

I had every intention of following the recipe exactly.  However, I started scrolling through the reviews and strayed.  It was a good stray though.  I added the brown gravy packet to the meat along w/a cup of water.  And, I eliminated the onions from the mashed potatoes.  The family loved it.  I would normally go back and try it as written.  But this recipe is so easy to personalize, I may even incorporate some ideas of my own.  I thought about adding some of the Lipton's Beefy Onion soup mix to the ground beef instead of beef broth and ketchup.  Once again, I realize that this changes the game, however, making changes to suit your family's preference isn't a bad thing either.  Loved this recipe!!!

This is regularly my go-to recipe since it's so simple, but I always find my meat mixture lacking in flavor.  I can never seem to season it well enough (my fault I'm sure!).  I decided to replace all the meat with Johnsonville Sausage, and it made a HUGE difference in flavor!  I opted for a Johnsonville Bratwurst since this is essentially "pub food," and despite not being a beer drinker, the beer flavor inside the sausage infused the dish beautifully, and this is how I plan to make it from now on, using various Johnsonville Sausage flavors to see what they all do.

Dear Hubby requested a Shepherd‚Äôs Pie but I‚Äôve never made one!  I used half ground beef and half Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage.  I added a dollop of sour cream to the mashed potatoes and a little beef bouillon to the broth.  Also added a little garlic when the onions were cooking and added some peas too.  We both loved our dinner and cannot wait to enjoy this again!  #AllstarsJville, #JvilleKitchens, #Fall

Everyone the family loved this.  As recommended by others I added Worcestershire sauce, brown gravy mix, skipped the flour, used the potato water to make the meat more saucy.   Also added corn and peas to the carrots called for by the recipe.  Was a big hit with the family.  Will definitely make again.

I really love the ease of making this recipe. I did substitute the carrots for peas and corn only because I grated the carrots on accident and could not cook them. It still turned out great. It was such a hit that I was asked to cook it again for a work function. Thank you so much for the great recipes!!

great, simple recipe.  My parents always told me shepherds pie is what you make out of leftover meatloaf and veggies so if i have any of those that's what i put in, otherwise i just microwave some frozen peas to add  in with the meat, and i pretty much never buy beef broth so today i used an equal amount of beer and it tastes great!

This recipe is very good and like other recipe's of Shepherd's Pie it can be a tad bland.  Next time I make it I may add a 1/2 envelope of onion soup mix to give it a little more zip.  I followed the recipe to a T as far as ingredients however, I cooked the carrots with the onions and did not mash them.  After adding the beef they melted in your mouth.  I saw no need to add the step of mashing them and layering them separately.  I will be trying this again with the onion soup mix and see what happens.

Outstanding, I have tried numerous recipes for Shepard's Pie in the past but this one has to rank at the top of the list. The addition of the mashed carrots along with the addition of the Ketchup really pushes this recipe over the top.

This was so tasty and easy to make. My family enjoyed it.  I already had most of the ingredients on hand. I made a few adjustments. I used olive oil vs. vegetable. I doubled the meat and added an additional potato. I also used about 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables.

This was my first time making and tasting any type of Shepherd's pie, but I didn't care for it.  Way too many potatoes and onions, not enough meat, and way too bland.

Very yummy, and extremely easy. My teenagers loved it. I had boxed mashed potatoes, so I used those, and added canned corn. I chopped the carrots and put them on top of the meat, but didn't bother with mashing. I baked it in a cast iron deep-dish skillet, so I had less pans to wash and it baked a little quicker. I'll definitely make this again.

We loved this!  We had left overs, but they didn't make it past lunch the next day.  I did add Worcester as some other reviews suggested, as well as adding more and other vegetable that it didn't call for, such as peas and corn.  It was yummy!

Awesome recipe.  My wife even liked it as good or better than her favorite she had been making for years.  I did add 1 tsp of rosemary to the ground beef and onion while it is thickening.  Fantastic!

I have been looking for a recipe for Shepherds Pie and I like this one.  However, I made some adjustments as with any recipe. I use potatoes and mash them like I would for homemade mashed potatoes. I add cream cheese. I use ground turkey instead of ground beef and add my special blend of dry seasoning while it is cooking.  Also, I add bell pepper and onions to my ground turkey with some fresh garlic. For my veggies I use frozen mixed veggies. Of course all topped with extra sharp cheddar. Yummy!!

This is a very good recipe for Shepherd's Pie! My son loved it! I only made a few small changes. I put chopped green onions in my mashed potatoes, I used tomato paste instead of ketchup, and I used  1 1/2 cups of broth,corn and thyme to the meat.

OH MY GOSH!!!  This was SO GOOD!  We recently ate at a very popular highly recommended Irish pub and my husband had ordered this.  It was so good that we wanted to make it again.  Found this recipe and did what the others said...used some frozen carrots and peas instead...and just threw them on there...no mashing.  Also used a package of brown gravy mixed in one cup of water.  Everything else the same.  FANTASTIC!!!!  MUCH better than the Irish pub even!  My Irish mom is requesting the recipe!  :)  Will be making more of this!!!!

I have tried this wonderful recipe many times but I too add corn to the meat mix.  To add an extra delight,I coated the topping with cornbread mix. Jiffy brand will do and it cuts into easy squares while the pie itself remains moist and tender.

My husband really likes this version of Shepherd's pie, especially when I add a packet of brown gravy to the hamburger BUT as you can tell from my rating--it's not my fav.  I prefer the American Shepherd's Pie recipe on this site and I substitute the veggie soup for canned tomato sauce or tomato soup, I also add some bullion and more veggies.  I just really like the tomato flavor with this dish--even if it isn't as authentic!

Made this a while back and it was fantastic.

Modifications I made are I added peas, corn, and green beans.

I also used 80/20 Ground Chuck, cooked it separately part of the way to get rid of some of the fat.  Turned out awesome, my wife loved it, freezes well also since the potatoes seal everything in.

The extra Veggies give it some added flavor and color, I really like it

Good stuff. I think the potatoes need something a little extra, maybe more salt or pepper than I used. Also, next time I'll probably cook the carrots with the meat mixture rather than mashing them. That would make the process much easier!

Thanks for the easy-to-follow recipe. I have done what others suggested and used 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce, as well as 1 packet of gravy and 1 cup of water instead of beef broth. I also use different vegetables - canned peas, carrots, mushrooms, and frozen corn. Mine is loaded up with a high ratio of vegetables to beef because I like it that way. I put more cheese than called for on top because it tastes good, and I also use boxed potatoes because I'm lazy :). Great casserole dinner that my husband and I can eat for 3 days. I will be making this again.

Made it this evening, great flavor but will agree there are shortcuts with same great flavor.  I also used pie crust in the bottom of my pie, chopped my carrots very small and nuked them much faster, used Green Giant frozen sweet peas and I used Bob Evans regular mashed potatoes.  Half the time and great taste! . Browning the beef with the onions is all the work. .  Great recipe, I've been looking for a recipe similar to a Shepards Pie we got in Epcot and this is it!

This would be really good with more meat and gravy. Along with chives and sour cream in the potatoes.

GREAT RECIPE!!  I altered it a bit though to make it even more delicious. Everyone at the St Patricks Day party LOVED IT!! I used Campbells French Onion Soup instead of beef broth and a bag of frozen veggies including peas, green beans, carrots, and corn.

Wow. We made this for supper last night and it was phenomenal! Would rate it a 6 star on a 5 star scale.  There are so many variations you could make from the types of meat you use to the vegetables you add as well as the spices you use.  Compared to the real deal in Scotland fixed with lamb, this is hands-down much better.  My husband, who is the real cook in the family, keeps his mashed potatoes on the moist side with half and half and butter to avoid the dryness that can happen with Shepherds pie or any casserole for that matter. Of course this adds many calories as well. He made a huge casserole dish of this and it was all gone by the end of the meal.  No leftovers to mess with, that's for sure! It says a lot when you can keep teen-age boys happy!

We loved it.  I followed the basic recipe except I added 2 tbsp minced garlic to the onions as they cooked, added a tbsp of worchestire sauce and 1/4 cup chopped jalopenos (out of the jar, not fresh - my husband loves food that bites him back)also added corn and sweet peas.  All you Shepherd Pie experts are probably screaming nooooo!!!  Anyway, I used Oreida frozen potatos and added the cheese.  It was delicious.  Probably not authentic Shepherds pie, but a delicious casserole shepherd pie like dish and an awesome recipe you can tweak to your liking.

Good but not spectacular.  I guess my version of 'large potatoes' were larger than what was intended, as my potato to meat ratio was too high.  Liked the onion in the potato.  Peas were good in it.

Easy to make, but very bland.  The potatoes were pretty dry.  Not sure what I did wrong since so many others loved it.  I will look for another recipe for Shepherd's Pie.

I would also agree with using whatever you have on hand to season the beef, prefer to omit Ketchup. Recommend garlic and onion and a variety of vegetables- carrots, peas, green beans, and corn. To make it easier to get a "slice" I would put a very thin layer of potatoes on the bottom then later with veggies and remaining potatoes and add cheese at the last 10min of baking. I know this isn't the norm but its a little change :)

Fantastic!  I was short on potatoes, so I added a couple garnet yams to the mashed potato layer.  It made it orange, but was really tasty.  Opted for frozen mixed veggies instead of the mashed carrots (especially since there were yams in my potatoes), and added worchestshire sauce as recommended by others as well as some gravy helper.  Topped it with Smoked Beechers Flagship cheese which really added a whole new level to all the flavors.  On day three of leftovers and still excited for my lunch today!

I made this with some of the additions that were recommended.  Also, I didn't have ground beef so I used beef chunks, sauted with onions, garlic, 2 beef cubes and 2 tbls. flour to thicken.  I steamed fresh carrots and sliced them instead of mashing.  I added sour cream and seasoning to the mash potatoes and sprinkled with paprika.  All in all it turned out great and my kids loved it. I will try this again with ground beef next time.

I skipped the mashed carrot part entirely and added 12 oz of thawed peas/carrots mix to my meat mixture. It was great. I also accidentally put 1/4 cup minced garlic in the potatoes in stead of just a Tbs and I couldn't tell at all. Needed salt though.

We really liked this.  While I know it may not be traditional with the layer of mashed carrots and cheese I think it actually makes it better.  My only change was adding some leftover peas and corn to the ground beef mixture.  The cheese is what makes this.  We will make this again.

My husband and I love this recipe!! We made it for St. Patricks day last year and I am making it again for him today because it is a nice cold day. I changed the recipe slightly based off a few other reviewers comments. 

First off let me say that it is very important to properly season your food with salt and pepper throughout the cooking process. I salt and pepper my meat before cooking as well as generously salt the water for the potatoes before putting them in. Unfortunately people have been lead to believe that salt is bad for you, not the case. Too much salt is bad, yes. But a generous pinch of kosher salt to any meat or vegetable brings out all the flavor most of you probably  missed out on when you made it the first time. Add flavor whenever possible, I also boil my carrots in chicken stock which gives them an amazing added umph!  

Other additions include; most if not all of 1 packet of brown (beef) gravy, a little extra Ketchup and a a few splashes to 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce to the beef as it is browning. 

Hope you all enjoy! It's one of the most amazing meals you can make if you do it right.

I have made this as directed and made it using the gravy mix as so many suggested. I personally don't like the gravy mix added, to me it gives it a cheap Banquet frozen dinner taste to it. It is good as is, the only ting I do different is I make a milk gravy with the hamburger instead of the beef broth & omit the ketchup.

Very good!  Just 3 potatoes will do it, as the mashed potato to meat ratio is a bit overwhelming.  And instead of carrots, I poured a 12 oz. steamer bag of mixed veggies on top of the meat layer.  I also substituted the broth for a gravy packet which I tossed in after the ketchup with one cup of water.  Husband loved it!

Very tasty recipe! I took some advice from the previous reviewers: I added 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce to the meat before cooking and mixed well; instead of beef broth, I poured in half a jar of meat gravy and probably 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water from boiling the potatoes and let simmer 5 minutes (I also did add a tbsp of ketchup while cooking); and instead of cooked and mashed carrots I poured a mix of frozen vegetables to cover the meat to cover (did not thaw/microwave beforehand). Overall, it was really delicious and I am going to add it to my list of dinnertime favorites. I can't wait to make it again. Thank you very much for the recipe!

Wonderful. To be a little healthier I decided to do ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also added taco seasoning to it. I also added layers of some green beans and corn.

So Delicious! I added a can or corn (niblets), 1/4 cup Worcestershire, 1/4 cup ketchup, garlic salt, and seasoning salt... it was great, and will definitely make it again

The layer of mashed carrots really makes this special, I think.

Love it! Hubby has never had Shepards pie before(Its not really known in Eastern Europe) but he LOVED it! And now keeps requesting it! I mostly followed the recipe. Though i added the Worchestireshire to make the mince more 'Meat Pieish'(Im Aussie). And I whipped the Potatoes with the Electric mixer to make them much more smooth and creamy. I added some breadcrumbs on top with the cheese as well. Give it a bit of a crunchy texture on top to break up the softness.
Love it and great recipe! Easy to make and great leftovers(If theres any left!)

Was my first time making shepherd's pie. Tasted really good and my family ate it up quick. If I make this again (which I probably will) I would use more ground beef as there was almost 3 times as much mashed potatoes as ground beef (Which really isn't too terrible for the potato lovers in my family :D)! Maybe my potatoes were a little more on the too large size. Also I would probably add some more colorful vegetables than just the carrots and onion.

Very good, took some time to make tho. I would add peas. We had peas on the side and I think the pea flavor complimented the pie overall.

quick and easy to prepare (assuming you dont drop a boiling pot of carrots on your foot like I did) very tasty. 
I added a layer of mixed frozen veggies and left carrots un-mashed.

Very good!!! Instead of simmering the meat with beef broth, I used 1 beef boullion cube and about 3/4 cup water. Did everything else exactly.....very easy and not daunting at all. My boyfriend said it was better than the Shepherd's pie at our local Irish pub. I think he's being nice :) but still... YUM!!

Really good!  My mom used to make this as a kid and I wanted to make mine a little different.  i added mushrooms when I was browning the beef as I wanted more vegetables.  I added worcestershire, garlic and a pinch of beef stew mix as I didn't have brown gravy.  I then put corn and carrots then the potatoes!  It turned out great!

Great! Only changes I made were to add 3 T. of worcheshire sauce to the ground beef and I didn't mash the carrots just par cooked them in the microwave and added them to the meat along with a 1/2 cup of frozen peas.

I made extra "gravy" and poured it on top because it looked dry.  I would add more carrots and other vegetables like corn and peas too.  Very comforting food!

Excellent - this is the epitome of comfort food, and there's no better way to use leftover mashed potatoes. Like others suggested, I cooked the onion with some garlic, and omitted the beef broth and used a combination of 1/4 c Worcestershire, 1 cup water,1 packet of brown gravy mix, and a splash of port for a little more complexity. I also added a bag of frozen peas - which I think gave the dish some much needed color and texture. Very, very good.

I make this a couple of times a month during the winter. LIke other reviewers, I add worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture.  I also cheat and use instant potatoes -time saver!  I've made it with the mashed carrot and I've also just thrown in some canned carrots, corn and green beans.  It's a nice hearty meal.

I modified almost everything about this recipe to make it time-friendly for work night dinner. I left out the onion, water, salt & pepper- substituting beef broth and onion soup mix. I added 1 3/4 cups frozen mixed vegetables while simmering the cooked beef in the broth mixture, and prepared a box mashed potato mix at that time. I folded 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese into the potatoes. I then spread the beef & vegetable mixture into a 9" pie plate, topped with another 1/4 cup cheddar cheese and the potatoes. Baked as directed, and the whole process took less than 40 minutes-yum!!

I made this using several of the other reviews, and it was delicious!  I used 2 tbs ketchup, 1c water, a packet of brown gravy mix, and 1/4 worchestire sauce. I thought that was too much worchestire sauce, so I would cut that amount in half. I also added in some frozen pees to the boiling carrots about half way through. Other than that, it was absolutely delicious!

This is a good recipe.  I made a few adjustments based on other reviewers' suggestions.  I used a packet of brown gravy instead of the beef broth and prepared it as instructed on the packet.  I then add the gravy to my browned meat along with 1 tbs each of worcestershire, A1 and ketchup.  I often will pay with the ratios of the three until its to my liking.  My family likes garlic mashed potatoes so I add a few into my potatoes while they boil instead of adding onions to it.  For the veggies, I used 1 12oz bag of frozen peas & carrots.  This is a great dish to prepare ahead of time and put into the oven later.

Thought this was an awesome recipe, especially for picky eaters. I didn't have any beef broth on hand, so I mixed a half packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix with 3/4 cup water, and didn't add any onions to the meat or potatoes. Great flavor! Thanks for the recipe

Just made this last pm, only change I made was mashing the carrots in with the potatos with colby jack cheese. So yummy. I work 2nd shift so I made it in the AM and my husband put it in for dinner at 350 for about 45 min to heat for dinner. My picky kids ate 2 plates and wanted it for breakfast.

This was great. I doubled it for a potluck and made it in a 9x13. I changed the recipe as some of the other reviewers have. I used red skin potatoes and left the skin on when I mashed the potatoes. I used chives instead of onions in the potatoes. I used gouda instead of cheddar as well. I mixed frozen peas into the carrots. Added garlic with the hamburger and used worchestershire sauce and the gravy powder as suggested above. 
This was my first time making shepherds pie and it was so good! I will definitely make it again.

Ahh! The BEST Shepherd's pie I've ever had!! I added Montreal Steak Seasoning to the meat, and sauteed the onions separately with butter and salt. Added Garlic and Onion Powder and extra butter, salt, and pepper to the Mashed Potatoes. I also added a small layer of cheese between the meat and carrots. DELICIOUS!!

This is a very good base recipe! The meat needs some extra seasonings as it was rather bland, I just seasoned using salt, pepper and whatever I had on hand, worcestershire, garlic and onion powder. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic, and a can of drained peas and carrots

This turned out really good. I did make a few adjustments, hence the 4 stars. Without the adjustments, it likely would've been too bland. I added 1/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce to the ground beef after mixing in the flour. I also heavily seasoned it with salt and pepper. I added garlic to the onion when cooking. I also mixed a tad bit of milk and garlic powder into the mashed potatoes. I also broiled the top at the end to get a nice brown top. I will definitely make this again but use less carrots and more meat mixture.

My husband loves Shepherd's Pie - I find it boring so decided to try this one to see if it jazzed it up a bit w/o my husband really noticing. I didn't have any beef broth so I used "Better Than Boullian " beef base with 3/4 c. water; the ketchup; purchased "Country Crock" garlic mashed potatoes and added in the cheddar (such a timesaver); omitted the carrot; added a bag of frozen peas and a can each of corn and creamed corn. It was pretty tasty!

I needed a last minute recipe to use up some ground beef and i came across this. I didnt think the kids would like it but figured my husband would. I was surprised how good this was. and even the picky kids said it was really good and cleaned their plates. I did add peas and worsteshire sauce to the beef.

With some of the other added changes, this recipe deserves five stars. (Sour cream to the potatoes, and worsteshire sauce to the beef). I also made this recipe with ground turkey and it still tasted great!

Diced FRESH carrots, instead of going to the trouble of cooking them on their own and mashing. I also make a dark gravy on the side to add on top of the individual servings. This recipe and flavor are delicious

Also added dill seed.

Left the carrots sliced and added canned grean beans.  Also, I used instant potatoes because that is what I had on hand.  Made it much easier and I think I will use them again in the future.  My family loves this recipe...even my very picky 10 year old son :)

Delicious and easy to prepare.  However, the meat needs more seasoning, so I add Worcestershire sauce and/or some A-1 to the meat and it really improves the flavor of this recipe.

This is a great recipe.  Instead of using water, I used 1 1/4 cups dark beer - Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale and it made the pie incredibly hearty, almost like a steak and Guinness pie.  Following the advice of other reviewers I added 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons of ketchup, 2 tablespoons of flour and a brown gravy packet.  I will make this many times over.

I wanted to make this exactly as written because I wanted to rate it for how it is without any changes. I have to admit I was not able to make it EXACTLY as stated either...I had to add some garlic, worchestershire and more broth. Still ended up being just ok and somewhat bland for my taste. The potatoes are great but the beef mixture is missing something. Seems everyone else was right - this recipe needs some modifications to be a five star.

Potatoes were too dry for my liking. Will add 2 Tabl sour cream in the potato mix next time I make it. Also added some frozen peas into the carrot mixture. Delish!

Easy to make and so delicious! I halved the recipe as it is just me and my husband. I didn't have ketchup or flour or onion. So I used what I had. I added Moore's marinade to my beef and used cornstarch to thicken. I added onion powder to substitute for the onions and I added 1/2 a can of dark red kidney beans, rinsed and drained.The mashed carrots are such a great addition. It tasted so good! Thank you for the recipe. It will become a regular in this house!

This is a great recipe! I recommend doubling it - that way it fills a 9x13 casserole dish and there are plenty of leftovers. It also freezes really well.

This was very good. I needed to get rid of some ground beef before it went bad, and I also had a ton of potatoes so this recipe was perfect because I had all the ingredients on hand. I added the worcestershire sauce to the meat, then added brown gravy (1 cup water with 3 tbs of brown gravy mix), and then added mixed veggis (about a cup). Next time I will add a bit more cheese!!!

Simple recipe to follow, but just "okay"... made as written, did *not* like the carrot layer, would probably make again with the additions of worcestersire sauce and mixed veggies.

I was disappointed with this recipe. Not because it was gross, but because it lacked flavor. I added the worchestier (sp?) sauce, plus used beef gravy instead of broth, also added minced garlic to the meat while cooking, but it still lacked flavor. I have made this before using lots of spices and it had a wonderful flavor. Maybe because I had something to compare it to is why I am disappointed. We all ate it, but I wont make it again and I am going to search high and low for the recipe I used before.

I would not make this again.  I followed the recipe (adding garlic and 'wooster' as others have suggested), and then tasted the gravy.....still too bland.  I then added oregano, but it didn't help much either.  The potatoes were good, though!!

Shepherd's pie is a fall back recipe for us (I cook it when I'm in a rush), and we usually just use the package mix.  I will continue to use the mix when I make Shepherd's pie.

Very tasty.  I made a few minor changes because of preferences for my family.  Less onion (my husband isn't a huge fan) and a little bit of garlic powder with the ground beef.  A layer of frozen mixed veggies instead of the mashed carrots.  Extra cheddar cheese on top.  Very, very good...this will be added to our regular meal rotation :)

4.5  Used brown gravy mix,  water and W Sauce as per previous reviewers rather than beef broth.  Also added minced garlic to the onions and frozen peas and frozen corn to the fresh carrot and didn't bother mashing them.  A sprinkle of paprika on the top and very good.

This was not bad, but a bit bland and dry.  It was better the second day.  I may try it again adding some tomatoes and seasonings, maybe increasing the amount of cheese a little.

I have no idea why this recipe got so many good ratings.  The majority of even the 5 star ratings suggest changes.  The recipe as is is bland.  Like others have said, a good starting point, but not a 5 star recipe as is.
I won't be using this recipe again.

i used ground lamb and added a long hot pepper for a kick.  very good, will make again, probably with beef, i just so happened to have the lamb on hand to use.  DH loved it, so i guess this goes into the rotation.  thanks for the post jacquie!

It was good. But we were not a fan of the mashed carrots.The gravy for the meat was great! From now on I will be combining my old recipe with this one.

My husband LOVED this recipe! It was very good and pretty easy. I followed the recipe for the most part. The only change I made was substituting a steam fresh bag of mixed veggies for the carrots because I didn't have any carrots. will try with carrots next time. Very good and my kids gobbled it up too.

Amazing!  I would give it more stars if I could!  I didn't alter anything, to give an honest review, and made this for St. Pat's day.  It was multiple steps, but very easy to do with the directions.  It came out beautifully, taking just a little longer to brown but that could be my oven.  My family, including two picky eaters, raved about it and my husband requested this be put on the rotation.
Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I used ground turkey and added a packet of brown gravy instead of the beef broth and used frozen veggies mix instead of mashed carrots. Mixed some sour cream in with the mashed potatoes and it was great.

Wow, I was nervous to use ketchup but it actually rounded out the flavor nicely! Quick and easy and made the two parts and waited for company to arrive to reheat it! Delicious for St. Patrick's Day on a dime:) I only added sourcream to potatoes and sauce for personal preference, otherwise used measurements and ingredients listed

A very good base recipe, very easy to tweak. For example, instead of carrots, I substituted frozen peas and corn, which worked wonders. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and added worcesteshire (I can't spell it to save my life) to the meat as it was cooking. This is especially important if you're substituting with ground turkey, as I did. I also used low fat cheese, and everything tasted great!

This was really delicious!  I followed the recipe, no tweeks, unless you count flavoring with Lawry's seasoning salt and pepper, which we do to almost everything in this house.  Simple, savory and great! Serve with a salad or something green. It really went well with some red wine. :)  Made it last week and making it again tonight!

We loved this recipe.  I added lots of fresh vegetables that needed to be used and to make this a little healthier.  Parsnips, carrots, onions, green beans, celery and mushrooms were saut√©ed.  Cooked ground beef, drained, added about 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and simmered, then added about 2 tablespoon of flour.  Used beef stock as recipe suggested verses gravy packet as suggested by some reviewers.   Then added vegetables to meat mixture.  Picture perfect family meal that tasted great.

This was a good recipe. Of course, like other reviewers, I added my own touch. I added fresh rosemary to the mashed potatoes - so good! And I used a bit of balsamic vinegar - you can use this if you don't like worcestershire sauce - it gives the dish the same savoury tang. Although I used balsamic and the worcestersauce. Also I used tomato paste instead of ketchup. Added 1/2 cup each of frozen peas and corn to the meat mixture. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I followed the directions exactly.  It was very good and pretty simple to put together.  Next time I will not mash the carrots, just leave them diced instead and add a bag of frozen peas for color.  The meat could use a little more flavor too, some worcestershire sauce would probably do the trick.

I added more flavor but this is a great dish! I saut√©ed garlic before the onion and added worcestershire (sp?) sauce to the beef before making the gravy! Great, hearty meal for a cold winter night!

This was DELICIOUS!!! I chose to steam and slice my carrots instead of mash them. Also, I stirred the carrots and some frozen peas in with the meat before I put it in my baking dish. I added some milk, and extra butter, to the potatoes as I mashed them (out of habit).I can't wait to eat leftovers! This recipe is going in my recipe box for sure, it's a keeper!

This was fantastic. I made a few adjustments and was very satisfied with the results. I used 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup barbecue sauce, 1/4 cup worcestershire, and replaced the beef broth with 1 cup of brown gravy. I also added a layer of green peas on top of the carrots.

This was tasty!  I didn't mash the carrots, I just sauteed them in with the ground beef and added frozen green peas also.  I didn't have any cheese on hand, so that was left out.  I took the advice of another and added in Worcestershire sauce with the broth to give some more flavor.  I did make my own mashed potatoes because we don't like instant.  Would definitely make again.

This turned out really well.  I added a bit of thyme and salt/pepper to the meat when the broth mix was simmering and also added green peas.  My kids really enjoyed this and they are pretty picky!  The cheese was the invite to give it a go and then they really enjoyed the thyme infused ground beef.  Very good recipe.

We omited the carrots simply because they were taking too long to cook and the kids were hungry.  I added, instead, about a cup and a half of frozen peas and carrots with the ketchup and increased the worchstershire to 1/2C.  My husband was in charge of the potato topping and I suspect he added about 3Tbs butter.  It was a HUGE hit.  We also made it with venison and found it delicious.

I read over some of the comments beforehand, most were positive but some mentioned that the recipe was a tad bland. Thus, I doubled the ketchup, added a tablespoon of our favourite bbq sauce, and a fair splash of Sriracha sauce, and it turned out delicious! My husband absolutely loved it. A great recipe!

This was great, and I attribute much of that to reviewers notes - the gravy & worsh sauce are essential.

Did per recipe, except swapped broth for water/gravy mix per a suggestion, also swapped corn for carrots for personal preference. I happened to love it, dh as well, but kids not so much. I think I just like any potatoes....has to go in the middle there, cuz I have to get at least 3 of the 5 kids....thanks anyways!

Made this for my book club, and shared leftovers with co-workers. Everyone loved it. I used a packet of brown gravy with water instead of beef broth. I also added green onions and soiur cream to the mashed potatoes.

This is a great hearty recipe; not too much trouble to put together and fills you up well. Not to mention makes great leftovers.  I stuck to the recipe for the most part, throttled up the potatoes a bit and cheat on cooking them as I throw in the carrots at the same time and seperate them to mash. I also add a bag of frozen corn when assembling, on top of the carrots but before the potatoes.

Used leftover mashed potatoes; also added shredded parmesan cheese to potato mixture.  Sliced baby carrots, steamed for 3 mins - did NOT mash.  Added frozen mixed veggies and steamed carrots to hamburger.  Used a bit more ketchup (maybe 2 tbsp).

Good. Not fancy, but what do you expect? Peeling, boiling, and layering is about all there is to it. I like this because you get almost your whole meal in 1-2 scoops of this. Furthermore, the boiling method doesnt dirty the pans, just a quick wash and rinse. Now if you can simmer the ground beef in something that is oven-ready (like a dutch oven) you can cut down on one more pan (the one for the ground beef) and just serve from the dutch oven. Just a thought if youre like me and HATE doing dishes.

I love this recipe! Simple, but oh so good! However, I have to take a star off. There simply was not enough flavor! Next time I will be adding more cheese inside the potatoes, as well as garlic salt. The potatoes were a little thick for my liking, so I'll be adding a splash of milk while mashing too. I didn't bother mashing the carrots. I cut them into small cubes and cooked until tender and used as it. Throwing in peas and maybe even corn kernels might be good. Excellent recipe to tweak to your liking!

We really liked it!  I have never made Shepherd's Pie at home before, but my hubby orders it at restaurants and he thought it was great.  The only changes I made was to add a Worcestershire sauce to the hamburger mixture and a little sour cream and milk to the mashed potatoes.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought it was a great recipe, the broth and the flour gave the meat a nice creaminess. I added some garlic powder and paprika, to give it a little bit more flavor. I would add more vegetables any time I made shepherds pie I add a variety of veggies. Maybe some canned mushrooms, turnips, corn, peas. Anything to make it more hardy.

This is pretty good. I cheated and cut down on the prep time by using mini-potatoes and not peeling them, and using frozen peas and carrots as the middle layer. Take them out of the freezer when you start cooking to slightly thaw and just toss them in. I didn't use the gravy mix, but I did add garlic to the meat, as well as parsley to the mashed potatoes. I will definitely be making this again!!

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out wonderful!  I have three small children and they loved it and I have an adventerous husband who liked it.  Next time I make it, there will be a next time, I will spice it up a bit with red pepper flakes or tabasco sauce.

Delish! My mom said it could be her last meal :) I did change some things to suit our taste. 1- sauteed shallots and garlic in some evoo. 2- added the ground beef into the shallot & garlic mix and cooked. 3- remove from heat and added frozen corn and peas after beef was cooked. 4- removed beef mix leaving liquid behind to make sauce using ketchup, beef broth & beef bisto for thickening 5- made instant mash, added butter, salt & pepper, as well as some pureed garlic in evoo. 6- put beef mix in first (when removed from liquid), then sauces over top, then potato mix with shredded cheddar cheese. It was to die for!! Made it again tonight to freeze :)

Very Good!  This is real comfort food.  I made a few changes to the recipe as other people have suggested: I mixed peas and carrots in with the meat, added more ketchup, a little sage and Worcestershire sauce.  Also, I realized after I had already started that I had run out of carrots, so I skipped the mashed carrots and used creamed corn.  It was delicious!

Comfort food!  Used ground turkey this time around, but love it with ground beef as well.  Used a small onion finely chopped, ketchup, worcestershire and beef consomme.  Instead of mashed carrots, I used frozen peas and corn and mixed it right into the turkey mixture.  Layered the meat in the casserole, sprinkled a thin layer of shredded mont-jack cheese and topped of with Diner Choice Mashed Potatoes.  Sprinkled with paprika and baked in a 350 degree oven for approx. 30 minutes.  Really so good!!!

Hmm, don't know what I did wrong, but I found this very bland. I see that a lot of people added more seasonings to the meat, but just reviewing the recipe as is: bland. The only thing I changed was using roasted garlic instead of onion in the potatoes and a bit more butter and cheese than called for. Maybe I didn't salt the potatoes enough? It tastes flat to me.

This was excellent!  Really nice recipe.  I prepared it a bit differently from the recipe according to which ingredients I had on hand, and the suggestions of other reviewers.  I used cubed beef and seasoned it.  Browned it with onion in a little olive oil.  Once browned, I added a couple tbl flour, 1/2 beef bullion cube, 1.5 cup water, ketchup, and bag of frozen peas.  Let that boil down so that it had a gravy.  Used a packet of potato flakes on top.  Excellent dish!  Next time add a bit more salt and pepper, and maybe experiment with adding other veggies.

I don't know why in the recipe it would say to add oil to the pan, when you are ready to cook the meat and onions. Ground beef always has plenty of fat to cook the onions with. The extra oil is NOT needed.

never reviewed before, but i felt i had to on this one because it's just missing a tiny little something to make it perfect. i gave this 4 stars as is, because i think it's a fantastic start. the only thing about it i disliked was how dry it was. so, i added much more butter to the potatoes, and some milk as well, until the creaminess was to my liking. then for the meat, i added 2 sticks of celery, and didn't drain it (i buy the super lean), because i didn't want to lose all the liquid from the onions and celery. lastly i added 2 more TBS of ketchup. it turned out much more moist and delicious than when i followed the recipe exactly. i highly recommend trying it this way. :)

Really nice recipe. I recommend the following: 1) Use Yukon gold potatoes 2) Add 2-3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef like other reviewers have mentioned 3) Add green beans. Make sure the green beans are cooked but have some crunch to them. It adds nicely to the texture of the dish.

Used frozen veggies.  Make sure to defrost before hand so they are fully cooked after 20 min in oven.

When I first saw this recipe I thought it would be a ton of work, but don't be intimidated - it is so easy and quick! I have been using this as my base recipe for ages now and will never buy pre-made pie again.  Don't be afraid to fool around with this one - I don't bother putting a separate layer of carrots anymore, I just saute whatever veggies I have on hand in with the beef after it's browned. The only change I think you MUST make to this is to add worcestershire sauce or other seasoning of your choice, or it will be too bland. A side note - this is actually a recipe for Cottage Pie, not Shepherd's Pie. Shepherd's Pie is made with lamb, not beef, but you could easily substitute either.

This was pretty good. The changes that I made were: I did ground turkey instead of ground beef, added a packet of dry gravy mix plus 1 cup of water, 1/4 cup of worchestchire sauce (sorry about the spelling), peas, corn and carrots. I did not mash the carrots, I like chunks better. This makes enough for a couple of meals. Will make this again!

This is a 4 1/2 star recipe. The meat really needs more flavor if made as is. I gave it 5 stars because it's a great start as well as very pocket book friendly. I fed 7 people and had leftovers. We are all stuffed! Very yummy, very filling, and very inexpensive! I highly recommend this one!

Pretty good!  Instead of ground beef, I used 3 steak sandwich steaks (6 oz. each) which had defrosted and needed to be used.  I added 1/2 & 1/2 to the mashed potatoes.  Did not add a whole onion - used only 1/2 of a small onion.  Added 2 T. ketchup and 2 T. worchestire sauce, and instead of the broth, used a brown gravy packet and 1 cup water.  Sprinkled frozen peas over coarsely mashed carrot layer.  Made in a pie plate, dotted top with some butter.  I think using the steak sandwich meat and the gravy was a good change for this dish.

This was really amazing and super easy. I did take other's advice and chose to add sour cream in the potatoes.  I also used more cheese (2 cups total) and instead of carrots, I used corn.  I definitely recommend using the brown gravy as opposed to the broth (I think it's more flavorful).  I also added montreal steak seasoning to the beef mixture...it gave it such a great flavor.  I have been wanting to make sheperd's pie for years (mom used to make it) and my family turned their noses up every time I'd suggest it. Made it for the first time on Monday...and it was GONE. They loved it so much that I was asked to make it twice in the same week. Thanks Jacquie!

This is what I did.  Turned out pretty good.  1) Cast iron skillet.  Cook 1 lb lean ground sirloin with chopped 1/2 sweet onion, lowery's salt, fresh grnd pepper, dash of ray's seasoning.  Stir 2 Tbs flour into to 3/4 cup water, salt and pepper and add to beef mixture.  2) Used 8 red potatoes.  Steamed and then mashed with skins on.  Added 1Tbs butter, salt, pepper, lowery's salt, 1 small onion minced, enough milk to moisten.  Mixed in 1/4 cup shredded cheddar.  3) Steamed 4 carrots.  Mashed with skins on.  4) Layer carrot, and then potatoes on beef mixture in iron skillet.  Add other 1/4 cheese on top.   Cook in skillet in  oven at 375 for 20 min.

Absolutly Perfect....my girls licked their plate clean and I have a hard time getting them to eat.  This will be made often in my house! Definitely add frozen peas and corn and I steam the carrots and smash them and it comes out great.

Good recipe.  Added a little milk to the potatoes when mashing.  Added a little butter to the carrot.  Worsherstershire is a good idea too.

This was ok, not great, I think it was way too many carrots.  If I made it again I would probably use a mix of diced carrots, peas and corn.

Loved this recipe with the additions mentioned previously... 1/4 cup Worcestershire, 2 Tbsp ketchup, 1 1/2 cups mixed veggies brown gravy packet and 1 Cup BEER, not water, in with the beef in place of broth. Yummy. I only had Sam Adams on hand, but I bet Guinness would make it even better. Next time!

This is the best Sheperd's Pie i've ever tasted, especially when I followed SCIOTA's recommendations. I hate to say it, but it was even better than my mom's recipe, which is what I grew up eating! My whole family inhaled it.

This was yummy with a few changes made per other reviews (hence 4 stars).  I used one packet of beef gravy mix mixed with the ketchup and water.  I also used about 1 1/2 cups of frozen kernal corn that I'd nuked until hot (instead of the carrots).  Followed the rest of the recipe and it was good comfort food.  I used to make this many years ago for my growing family and it brought back good memories.  Thanks!

This was quite delicious! I made changes as everyone said to (beef gravy, Worcestershire sauce, veggies directly into the meat). For the potatoes, I used one of those country crock tubs, the loaded one was quite delicious, if you do use this, use at least two tubs, i only had one and needed to make more with instant potatoes. I also added mushrooms to the meat and some extra spices (salt, pepper, seasoning salt, and a small amount of rooster sauce). Overall, it was delicious. I will be making this again!

This an excellent base recipe and the cheddar cheese is a MUST (it browns so nicely in the oven). However, this recipe is missing vital compenents. Worcestercire sauce is a big one...I've never seen it NOT used in a shepherds pie recipe. About a tablespoon or so for this recipe would do nicely. I also added a small amount of garlic to round out the flavour of the beef, about a clove or two for the recipe is sufficiant. I also like to add green peas for a splash of color (even though they are not traditional).

My husband went crazy for this.  I did add sliced fresh garlic to the ground beef and onions as well as a bit of worcestershire sauce.  I threw a little Italian seasoning in with the carrots and put a bit of garlic salt in with the potatoes.  (We are huge spice fans)

Although this is not shepherds pie, its cottage pie, It was very good! Instead of shred cheddar, I used our new favorite mexican style blend of monterey jack, cheddar, queso quesadilla and asadero shred. I also used beef gravy instead of broth. I used frozen mix veggies, also the fresh carrots, and in the end, I mixed an extra can of peas. My family loved it thank you!

I loved this, and so did my family. For ONCE the leftovers were eaten (actually, all of them by my husband and two year old while I was at work!) I have made as is, and altered for time saving only, as the original is great as well. To save some time I used the tub of pre-made mashed potatos.  Every bit as good as from scratch, considering you are not eating the potatos as a stand-alone side dish. I also used frozed mixed vegetables in place of the mashed carrot layer.I also added a generous dash of worshteshire sauce, since I LOVE it in ground beef dishes; I reccomend that as well! Great recipe, either way!

Wow!  This is so good.  My husband and I especially lov the "gravy" that comes from the combination of ketchup, worcestershire sauce, and chicken broth.  I made it 3 times in the two weeks after discovering it and it reminds me exactly of the pies in Ireland.  Yummy!

Awesome! Just added about 1 tablespoon of A1 as others suggested as well as green beans and corn.  Also excluded the 1 tablespoon of finely chopped onion.  Other than those minor changes followed exactly.  Delicious!

I gave this 4 stars because I made some changes to it to get it just right.  Like many other reviewers I added 1/4 cup worchestershire sauce, 2 Tablespoons of ketchup, and 1 crushed clove of garlic to the meat mixture.  I did add sour cream to the mashed potatoes because mine seemed to dry.  Next time I would omit the onion in the potatoe mixture too. It is a tad on the blad side....so dont be afraid to add the full 1/4 cup worchestershire sauce.  I have yet to try it but I think making it with the gravy instead of the broth, like others have suggested, would add a nice punch of flavor.

Very good!  I tweaked the recipe a bit, and it was a winner.  I used red potatoes, left the skin on, and mixed in a bit of milk with them while mashing.  I also doubled the diced onion and cheese in the mashed potatoes.  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the sauteed onion, and added some basil and oregano to the meat while it browned.  I used a packet of brown gravy mix, with 3/4 cup of water instead of beef broth.  I was out of ketchup, so I used pasta sauce instead.  I also used a 16 oz package of peas and carrots over the beef mixture, and probably tripled the cheese topping, also throwing in mozerella and jack in with the cheddar.

This recipe was a huge success in our house!!  Following the advice of other reviewers, I added sour cream to the mashed potatoes and Worchestershire sauce to the meat.  I also added peas, topped with black pepper and chives... this was the most flavorful Sheperd's Pie I've ever had!  I'm sure it would be perfect as-is, but come on... sour cream and Worchestershire - how can you resist!?  My boyfriend loved it! - Even after he made a face, when I told him what was for dinner, and said he didn't like Shepherd's Pie!  Thank you so much for helping me add another great staple to my recipe collection!

This was the most boring and time consuming shepherds pie I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly!  All you could taste was onions and mashed potatoes (and not even very good mash pot).  It needed at least twice the meat, lots more veggies, and seasoning (beyond salt and pepper).

The whole family loved this! We were looking for something to make for St. Pat's Day, so we made this with the black tracle scones. Great combo for my family.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I used a little beef gravy instead of beef broth.  Onion powder instead of onions and a touch of sugar in the beef.  We will make this again for sure.

I love this recipe.  I read the reviews and the only changes I made to the recipe was adding 2T. Worchestershire sauce to the meat mixture and adding a peeled garlic clove to the potatoes when they were cooking.  Oh and I forgot to add the finely minced onion to the mashed potatoes. This is a keeper and is going into the regular menu rotation.

This is a great one dish meal for a casual supper.  I added chopped fresh mushrooms to the sauteed ions and sauteed the carrots with some frozen green peas for color and did not mash but layered them over the beef layer. Potatoes were a bit stiff so I added a little milk to give it beter spreadability on the top.  Make sure to use sharp cheddar.  Crumbled  cooked bacon on the top gives this dish a delicious finish.

I altered the recipe some because we are trying to cut out so much red meat in our lives.  I used 1 lb. turkey instead and then I added some of the other ingredients that other reviewers suggested: 2 Tbs. Worcestershire and 1 clove garlic.  I also used chicken broth instead of beef broth to cut out some of the sodium.  My 18 month old little girl and my hubby liked it but the 4-year old did not.  I thought it tasted okay but was just a little bland...next time I will add more spices to the meat :)

It was wonderful! I did have to change a few things because of what I had on hand (didn't really feel like making a trip to the store :) .... I used a a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the floor, beef broth and I decided to omit the ketchup. It tasted wonderful, but I think it did lack a little favor, so next time I will follow the directions.  Definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe several times for my husband and me, just as is, and we both love it.  I've also increased the recipe to 24 servings as the main dinner meal at the homeless shelter where I volunteer, and everyone loves it so much.  I'm still getting compliments!  Thanks for this great comfort food recipe!

This is great!  I followed the advise of others and added gravy and worchestershire.  I worked in an English Pub for several years and this was one of their staples.  This recipe is just as good!

Very very good!!! I did not read the recipe through as I should have, but, I interpereted it as just a bunch of carrots! I diced them and sautee'd them with all fo the other veggies and added some worcestershire sauce(just a dab) and a little more garlic. Hah! They ate it up and were wishing I had made more. Great recipe!! Thankyou!!! Wendy Ella

Not bad at all, but I was hoping this would be better. Maybe it was my lack of cheddar (I needed to sub emmental instead) I added creme fraish and milk to the mashed potatoes and had to sub veal broth for the beef.  I added some frozen peas that I cooked first. My husband who is french says it tastes similar to hashis parmentier. This recipe also took over an hour to prepare instead of the 30 min stated in the recipe. Again, it wasn't a bad dish, but I think I will be able to find better things to do with my ground beef in the future.

This was AMAZING! I had a little more than a pound of beef and probably more potatoes than I was supposed to, but we just dumped it all in, anyways. We did add a bunch of minced garlic (from a jar) to the meat and to the potatoes and used more cheese than the recipe said (I had to, since we had extra meat and potatoes, of coursel...) and it turned out WONDERFULLY! Thanks for sharing!

I loved it ! and my hubby who is a big fan of shepherd's pie,too. I changed the recipe with other's suggestions. Instead of mashed carrots,I mixed the ground beef with chopped carrots and I added a packet of brown gravy mix to 1 cup water instead of 3/4 cup of beef broth.

I've never tasted this pie before, and I tried it as a trial bake for someone I know who loves it. It's easy to make, and I followed the reviews to add the brown gravy and Worchester sauce. I'd definitely make this again...thanks!

Excellent!!!   I hate saying that I made changes to a recipe, but after I read some reviews I also decided to add a bit more flavor to the meat.  I added fresh chopped garlic and worcestshire sauce.   I steamed some frozen peas and corn and used them instead of carrots.  I used some of the water I used to steam while mashing my potatoes as they seemed a bit dry...(yellow potatoes).  Cannot wait to try this again - with the carrots this time! :)   For sure the gravy is the secret to delicious shepherd's pie!  Mine were always dry - thanks so much for sharing!

I was really happy with this recipe. I don't think that I really needed the carrots...just my taste, I have to have peas in my shepherds pie. My guests went crazy over it. I can't wait to eat the left overs!!

Excellent quick meal. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used left over mashed potatoes supplemented with a batch of instant mashed (they were fast!). And I used a bag of frozen peas and carrots for the veggie layer. Used chicken broth instead of beef (its what I had on hand). And I added the 1/2 c grated cheddar right into the potatoes. Quick, easy, tasty...and leftovers were great too.

A very good recipe, although for an inexperienced cooker it can be a little overwhelming to have so many things on the go at once. Used worchestershire sauce which was very delicious, not a fan of the sugary ketchup. Also added whole kernel corn on top of the carrots, will try yams next time too.  My boyfriend said "His mouth couldn't decide if it was enjoying a steak dinner or corn on the cob". Meaning, he really enjoyed it.

followed recipe fairly closely while using some suggestions. instead of beef broth, added 1 cup water and 1 packet bown gravy. instead of cooking carrots, added frozen veggies (corn, carrots, peas, and greenbeans.) added worcestershire sauce in with the ground beef while cooking, should have added a little more. more ketchup too next time i think, probably 1/4 cup. tasty dish.

I thought this was very good.. The only thing I did differently was I did not use carrots, I used frozen peas and corn. I cooked the veggies first and then put them over the meat. My entire family loved it.. I woudl make it again.

This is one of my go-to recipes and it always seems to please even the pickiest of eaters. I followed the tips from other reviews and used brown gravy mix & water, but I still used a little beef broth too. I also added worcestershire to the meat. For my veggies, I use a can of peas & carrots (mixed) and a can of whole kernal corn. LOVE this recipe & it's super simple.

This was ok to me, I followed others advice and used gravy instead of broth, add worchester sauce and garlic powder and added some peas and corn, just did not love it.

I have made this dish a couple times, and always receive rave reviews and recipe requests. I only make the following changes:    I double all ingredients  I use two packages of Yves Veggie Ground Round instead of beef.  I add 1/4 cup of Worschestire sauce to the "beef".  I use one cup of chopped carrots and 3 cups of frozen veggie stir fry mix.    So delicious! Best comfort food ever!

DEEEEEELISH!!  The changes suggested by others make this sooo good.  I replaced beef broth and flour with gravy mix w/1 c water and added 1/4c Worcestershire sauce.  As a matter of personal taste, I didn't mash the carrotts (I just added them as a layer over the beef) and I added mushrooms and Paula Deen's house seasoning to the beef mix.  I also added heavy cream to the potatoes.  I would suggest to everyone to make the potatoes whatever way you like your mashies.  I thought the onion and cheddar cheese were excellent in the potatoes.  I will be making this again, and again, and again.......

Great base recipe. Not a lot of flavor if you follow the recipe completely, but I plan to make it again and add some spices to my meat. Also when I made it I took the advice of some of the reviews I had read before hand to add gravy and water to the meat and simmer instead of the beef broth. It was definitely a good choice - went great with the mashed potatoes. Yum!

My family loves this as it is a very filling meal.  The quickest change for me is using 4-cheese instant mashed potatoes instead of real.  I also use about 1/2 of a bag of frozen peas and carrots.  I have made it with no cheese and my family has enjoyed that as well.  This is a regular meal for us.

I made the recipe as is and it turned out perfectly, I wanted to note, that this recipe scales very well. I made only 2 servings. It tasted delicious. I used a meatloaf pan, i ended up just stacking the ingredients on one side of the pan, but it turned out perfectly, and was a good amount of food for two. We still had leftovers.

I added a clove of fresh pressed garlic to the potatoes.  I also added nutmeg, cinnamon, red pepper flakes, worcestershire sauce and leeks to the "meat" (boca burger crumbles).  Instead of mashing the carrots, I just sliced them, and added peas and corn to the carrot layer.

Excellent! I was worried it would be a bit bland so I added some onion soup mix and extra water to the ground beef along with the beef broth. It thickened up and was really tasty. I also added extra cheese with the mashed potatoes.

This was pretty good stuff and very filling. I used my own mashed taters (I was already making some gobble day to stick in the freezer) but I did add the onions in them and cheese on top . To the meat mixture I added some garlic, thyme, and some straw mushrooms as well as some  corn that was creepin around my fridge. The onions mixed with the taters make them extra tasty for this easy dish!!! Family must have loved it because I have none left!!!

Bravo bravo bravo!!  This was fantastic.  I followed the recipe's ingredients as is, except for adding minced garlic and celery.  I also opted to chop the carrots (instead of boiling and mashing), celery and onions/garlic and sauted them all together with the meat.  As for the potatos, the only thing I added was some heavy cream to make them creamier.  After it came out of the oven, I served it with green beans and toast.  PERFECTION!!  KUDO'S TO THE CHEF'S CREATION!

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  It's in my dinner recipe rotation.  My only change is not to mash the carrots.  I usually throw in peas too, but that's my personal preference.

This was very good but a it dry.  I skipped the ketchup and beef broth.  Instead I used half a can of condensed mushroom soup.  The taste was awesome but there wasn't enough sauce/gravy in the middle.  The mashed potato topping was also very dry, even with the cheese.  Next time I will add some milk to the potatos

LOVE this, added Worcestershire sauce to meat. Mashed carrots and potatoes together, just to use one less pot, and added a layer of peas. Awesome.

Following other reviewers - I made some changes as well.  Sauteed a few cloves of crushed garlic with an onion in 1 tbsp of vegetable oil before adding the beef.  Drain. I added a few shakes of paprika, then added 1 packet of brown gravy mix with 1 cup of water. 2 tbsp of Ketchup (I do not think Worcester sauce belonged in Shepherd's Pie so I did not add it, unlike most reviewers who did) Then I put in a 12 oz bag of frozen mixed veggies (the kind with corn, carrots, peas and green beans in it). I did not add flour, I felt it didn't need it. Simmered it for about 5 mins. I layered this on the bottom of a 9x13 pan, then topped with my mashed potatoes (I didn't add onions to it, only mixed in the butter and cheddar cheese).  The cheese is enough to not have to add salt (in my opinion). Topped with more cheese and baked at 375 for 20 min. Came out perfect and delicious!  WONDERFUL for the Fall Holiday season!

This is an excellent recipe.  Just a few changes.  No onion in the potatoes, more butter and milk to make the potatoes creamier.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of lean ground beef and omitted the ketchup, salt and beef broth and flour.  Instead I used Watkins beef and mushroom gravy base and kernel corn instead of carrots.  Next time I will try with the carrots.  I layered the corn between the meat and potatoes.  Will be a favorite in my house.

Well, the truth is that I've never had an authentic Shepherd's pie so I have nothing to compare it to.  Nevertheless, I can imagine it's supposed to taste like this.  It's good and I'll make it again for sure because it's healthy (I left out the additional oil and added a can of corn.)  That being said, the next time I will take the advice of others and flavor the meat a bit more...maybe some garlic or something, it could use some zing.  The recipe is definitely worth a try.  Happy eating!

This came out really well for me.  My family loved it.  Although I did make some changes. First I use buttermilk in my mashed potatoes.  That is just personal choice.  Next I put beef broth, Ketchup (1/4 cup), Worcestershire (1/4 cup), and brown sugar (about 1 tablespoon) in my meat mixture. Then I added frozen peas, carrots and corn.  It really came great.  I will be making this again!

I had only had Shepherd's Pie once ( and it wasn't even particularly good..) but I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover mashed potatoes. As suggested by other reviewers I added some Worcestershire Sauce. I didnt't have any gravy mix since I try to cook everything from scratch, but adding some garlic, paprika and a touch of parsley did the trick. I did not mash the carrots, but that was just my preference. Overall very good, extremely cheap and easy to make! Will be making again!!

EASY EASY EASY!!! and GREAT!! I used instant potatoes (my mother would DIE!) I used a packet of mushroom gravy and added 1 cup of warm water to it and set it aside while i cooked the meat. To the gravy i added ketchup, a small jar of mushrooms, and some A1 sauce... didn't have HP. I used a  steambag of veggies from the freezer section (carrots, corn, and asparagus) I added the flour to the meat, then the gravy mixture and heated through. Then dumped the bag of veggies in with the meat before pouring it in the bottom of the pan. Then added potatoes on top followed by more cheese.... I know the foodies out there would "tisk tisk" me for going the easy route, but the bag of veggies made it! Also love the crunch of uncooked onion in the potato topping!! GREAT!!

I made this last night and it was soooo good. Great comfort food. I did make a few changes. I used instant potatoes (only because they were easier; not because I like them better than the real thing). I also used a package of frozen mixed veggies. I added a whole can of beef broth with the ground beef and while that was simmering, I added the veggies so they would cook a little. To thicken up the meat mixture and add some more flavor, I added a packet of brown gravy. I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today!

Delicious. Exactly what I was looking for. I did end up using the gravy mix as another reviewer suggested. And, I added some extra seasonings to the beef while cooking. Other than that, followed the recipe and we loved it. Husband went back for thirds and practically made himself sick. The leftovers were great all mixed up too.

Interesting, my girlfriend found it needed something added (salt?) to add to the taste. I on the other hand found this to be the tastiest shepard's pie I've ever had - I'm sure it's because of the Worstershire & (probably) the brown gravy.  HIGHLY recommended!!!

This recipe is great, but it DEFINITELY needs some vegetables. We made ours exactly as the recipe states, except we added sour cream to the potatoes (per reviews), and I wish we had added vegetables like other reviewers stated. I wanted to give it a try as is, and my boyfriend is not much on veggies. :) It tasted great, but it would have been MUCH better with green beans, peas, and corn.

This recipe for Shepherd Pie was excellent! I used 1.5 lbs. of ground chuck and then drained it. I used 1 whole can of beef broth, the brown gravy packet, 2/3 cup of water and 1/4 cup of worchestershire sauce. I cooked it until some of the liquid had reduced and added 2 tbs. of flour. I used peas, carrots and corn mixed in with the meat. I wouldn't use instant mashed potatoes in this recipe as some reviews suggested, but that's just personal preference. I added the cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter and green onions to the mashed potatoes and it turned out wonderful. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe was wonderful!  I used venison with a small amount of beef fat for flavor, and I marinated it in beef broth while it defrosted. I did not add the Worcestershire sauce, since my children do not like it.  And I also added milk to the mashed potato topping.  Big hit with my family!!!

The potatoes seemed really dry so I added some sour cream that made them just perfect.  I didn't have any beef broth so I just used abour 1/4  c worchestire and the rest in water.  IT came out great.

* I didnt do as much onion as they wanted in the meat. I definitely used more potatoes and red skinned. Maybe 2 more? Also would be good with some minced garlic in mashed potatoes. Add more carrots depending on their size ya know. Yummmmoooo

Really, really good. i used half ground lamb, and half a pound of very lean ground sirloin. there was so little grease that I did not need to drain it off. Added three cloves of garlic, at least a quarter cup of worstershire sauce, one onion and a one teaspoon of dried thyme as I cooked the meat mixture. the thyme is fantastic. i also added about a half cup sour cream, two tablespoons butter and some milk to get the right consistency on the mashed potatoes. left the onion out of the potatoes. i stuck with the beef broth and thought it worked out great. I used chopped fresh carrots - right out of the garden so they were tender and sweet - and a handful of peas instead of mashed carrots. Topped it with a little extra cheese and paprika as others suggested. Will definitely make it again despite it being time consuming.

Thanks for sharing this recipe! I did take the advice of a previous review and substitued the gravy for beef broth-it was fantastic!! I also didn't mash the carrots, but cooked until tender and layered over the beef-I added frozen peas on top, straight from the box before baking and they were nice and firm (I don't like soft peas!)LOVED IT!

My family thought this was great.  I followed the advice of others to make sure and season the meat well and used gravy in place of broth.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and frozen peas and carrots.  I will definitely make this again soon.

I tried this out with Sweet Potato instead of regular, it was great.  I mashed the potato with some milk and butter for moisture. Instead of mixing the cheese with the potato I put it under the potatoes.  I also tossed shredded carrots on the meat instead of mashed carrots and also added a can of corn.

This was absolutely delicious!  The only things that I will change when I make it again are (1) I will use 2 lbs of meat (and increase the flour, broth & ketchup) and (2) I will bypass the peeling of the carrots and use baby carrots.

Use a good quality brown gravy mix and lots of onion and garlic for best flavor.  I added large carrot chunks instead of a puree, so my son could easily pick them out if he so chose.  I like peas in this as well and lots more cheese on top.  Very hearty supper.  Thanks for the idea.

Very good, but I have to admit I changed some things. First, I used instant mashed potatoes. Second, I used frozen veggies. I sauteed the beef and onions as instructed, but added broiled steak seasoning and some salt free beef bouillon and water (instead of broth) to the mix along with the flour and ketchup. It made a very nice gravy. I poured that into my dish, layered the frozen vegetables in, then the potatoes, then the cheese and some paprika. I baked the result (which was very pretty) covered for 10 minutes at 325 to steam the veggies a little and then uncovered for 20 minutes at 375 as the recipe instructs. This was SO good! Will definitely be making again! A+

With a few additions, this is a five star recipe. Based on the other reviews, I added 1/4 worcestershire sauce and doubled the ketchup. I used brown gravy instead of beef broth. Also chopped the carrots and mixed them right in with the meat along with about 2 cups of frozen peas and corn. This is a definite crowd pleaser!

This makes for a good base to work with but it was rather bland if recipe is followed to the letter.  I added garlic and Italian spices to the meat as it was cooking and that helped.

I doubled the recipe, using both beef broth and 1 pack of gravy mix with 1 cup of water. I seasoned the meat with salt,pepper,onion powder,garlic powder and a dash of worcestershire.  I put the meat on the bottom of the pan, sprinkled a layer of frozen peas on top - then a layer of mashed carrots (10), then topped with the seasoned mashed potatos, then sprinkled with cheese.  My husband said he could eat this once a week!!  Everyone had seconds.

This was excellent! Only thing I did different was use shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar because thats what I had. Its not a quick recipe though. It took about 1hr 10min total with prep time.

This recipe turned out GREAT!!!  I used some brown gravy mix in the meat to give it a thicker gravy.  It made a great dinner with a little green salad.

A really great start, but following the recipe yielded results that were not quite as zesty as I'd hoped. It was still a hit, and I'll definitely cook this again. Time to start tweaking!

I made this for the first time on St. Pat's Day, and it was very good. I'm giving it four rather than five stars because I think it needs quite a bit of tweaking to be really tasty. So, based on other reviewers' suggestions and my own preferences, I added the 1/4 C worchestershire to the raw meat; then, to the browning meat, garlic, extra ketchup, seasoning salt, a bit more broth--I had chicken broth, so that's what I used, with 1 t beef boullion--and, because of the extra broth, an extra T flour. I substituted a can of mixed vegetables (drained) for the carrots. I made the pie itself in an 8" cast-iron pan on the stove, topped with the mashed potatoes I'd made earlier, then popped it into the oven for about 15 minutes to heat it through and to brown the top. (No need to transfer to a casserole dish and have to wash another item.) It looked really neat (and maybe more "authentic") served in the skillet. And one note: Probably because I doubled the cheese and added extra broth, when I took it out of the oven, it was pretty wet--I couldn't cut it into wedges. But I found that after the pan sat on the stove for an hour or so, the pie absorbed the extra liquid and could then be cut into wedges. So its form was better later on, and the leftovers microwaved perfectly. Anyway, this recipe is really easy to follow, prepare, and tweak to your own tastes.  Everyone here liked it a lot.

I liked this, but I made a couple of changes to make it easier.  Instead of carrots, I just mashed up frozen mixed veggies.  And I used instant mashed potatoes instead of making my own.  The only downside is this recipe requires cleaning up a lot of dirty pots.

I made this for our St. Patrick's Day feast for those who don't like corned beef.  Everyone loved it and there wasn't any left over!  I followed the reviewer's suggestion and used a packet of brown gravy mix instead of beef broth.  I also sauteed the onions that get mixed into the potatoes instead of adding them in raw.  Easy to make, delicious, and easy to adapt to your family's preferences.

Excellent, made plenty.  The two of us had left overs for days.  Loved the addition of the mashed carrots instead of diced.  Added some frozen sweet peas to the ground beef. Very good.

Wow-what a great recipe!  I followed the recipe pretty close, but did make a few changes. Instead of carrots I used frozen chopped veggies (green beans, carrots, etc.).  As others have suggested, I added 1/4 c. worcheshire sauce and two good squirts of ketchup to the ground beef.  I ended up using 2 lbs of ground beef and almost a whole can of beef broth.  I also seasoned the beef with a few sprinkles of onion powder (in addition to the chopped onion).  When it comes to the potatoes, I doubled them and also added extra butter, onion, salt, pepper, and cheese.  Then, in a big casserole dish I put the beef on the bottom, then the cooked veggies, then the potatoes.  I finished it off with a sprinkle of paprika and shredded monterey jack cheese.  This dish will be a new staple for our house!  It smells so good while it cooks and tastes delicious!

This was a very good, easy recipe. I followed some of the advice in other comments and added a couple dashes of worchestchire to the meat mix. I also used frozen peas and carrots because it is what I had on hand. I made this vegetarian by using soy crumbles, and it was delicious. I will definetely try it again with ground turkey or beef for dinner for my boyfriend one night.

A definite new weeknight favorite!  (I used the modifications suggested by a few other users... brown gravy mix with water instead of the beef broth, and added 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas/carrots.  I also added some chicken broth to the potatoes.

Excellent recipe! First time I ever made it and it was better than most times I have had it out. The only changes I made were adding 1/4 cup of Worcestershire to the ground beef mixture before cooking and a packet of brown gravy mix to 1 cup of water instead of the beef broth. Also added frozen peas (microwaved) on top of the carrots. Hope ya got big stomachs for this cause it can feed a small army ;-)

This was good, I think next time I will add more ground meat,seemed like 1 lb was definitely not enough, I used 1/4 of worchester sauce and used a packet of gravy mix with one cup of water.  I also added some garlic with the onion.

I used less carrots and added peas and corn.  I sauteed onion and garlic before cooking the beef, and I also used beef bullion cubes instead of the broth.  (I also added some Worcestershire sauce.)  My husband loves this!  It was really easy.

very good.  I have never been a fan of Shepherds pie, but this one is good.  it isn't over powered with tomatoes.  the one thing I changed is I didn't mash the carrots, just sliced and boiled them till they were done, used instant potatoes, and added peas.

This was my first time making Sheperds Pie and it turned out awesome.  I took everyones advice and zipped up the flavor in the meat alot...  I added garlic pepper, more salt and black pepper, steak sauce, onion powder, garlic powder.  I used store bought red skin mashed potatoes and added sour cream and the chedder cheese.  I did add some beef gravy to the hamburger mix and then pour a thin coat over the it when layering.  I used corn, peas and carrots and loved the mix of veggies.  I was able to make this ahead of time and was great as a left over.

I followed this recipe exactly and thought it was good. I did think that maybe it was a bit too sweet, probably from all the carrots. Next time I will add more beef and cut some carrots out. I will also add seasoning. Garlic, pepper, salt.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous! I only changed it a little. I put green onions in the potatoes instead of white. I still left the white ones in the ground meat but, cut the amount down. I double the ketchup to 2 TBSP and also doctored up the potatoes a little more adding pepper and milk. I used corn instead of the carrots.

I found this a little bland, even after I added Worcestershire sauce.  I shredded some sharp cheddar on top, and that helped.  But my grandmother had seconds, and she might be the pickiest eater on the planet, so I'm giving it 5 stars.

Not as filling as I expected.  Think adding sliced mushrooms would be good.  Kids LOVED it.
Worcestire sauce is key.  Didn't use gravy packet, but added tsp. of boullion granules and some hot water after the flour and it made a nice gravy.

This wasnt all that bad..but not that great either. I thought this was bland even tho I did add worch as others have suggested. If I make again I would try maybe a packet of gravy also. I probally wont even bother for all the work put into it I was excepting more. :/

This was incredible.  I did double the catsup and added peas as others recommended.  And the idea of cooking the carrots with the potatoes was a time saver even though you needed to separate them after they cooked.  Everyone loved this - it's a real keeper!!

YES! spice up the beef to taste; I added curry powder and a tandoori spice.  I used a cast iron skillet to brown the beef, and built the pie on top of it (save a pot!).  don't bother mushing up the carrots; add broccoli for health.  skip the cheese for similar reasons.  top potatoes with paprika for beauty and flavor.  magnificent!  thanks!

This was pretty good (I'd actually give it 3 1/2 stars if I could) but a lot of work because of mashing the potatoes and carrots.  I think if I make this again, I will just cube the carrots.  I added some worchestershire sauce, but otherwise, I made it as is.

This was really yummy and it was a hit. Everybody loved it, there were NO leftovers, which is odd for our house! A plus is that it's super easy as well. 

I varied the recipe a bit. I added a bit of minced garlic as I was browning the meat and I used dried minced onion. I also agree that it was too bland. It needed more seasoning, more salt, to bring out the flavors more. Next time I make it I'm adding a bit of salt to the meat mixture.

Delicious!  I used twice as much cheese and added minced garlic and worcestershire sauce to lean ground sirloin.  It turned out fantastic.  I was a little hesitant about mashing up the carrots but it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  Great comfort food for a winter night.

I used 8-10 ounces canned peas/carrots instead of the chopped carrots, and added 3 cloves of chopped garlic.  To the meat, I added 1/4 cup worchestershire sauce.  Finally, I seasoned it with pepper, seasoning salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Also, I used all the cheese on the top.

Very good. I made a few changes. Did not mash carrots, used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of beef broth. I also added 3 stalks of celery, finely chopped and 2 teas. worchestershire sauce for extra flavor. My family really liked it. We will definitely have this again.

So good! I used instant potatoes and canned roast beef in broth for substitues. Though it took me a long time to make, it was excellent and I look forward to making this again!

Good family recipe. Was a hit, but A liitle bland to my liking. Next time will add a little more salt, more cheese, and one less carrot. Next time I will also try with green beens and corn to go with the carrot. But all in all a good stick to your stomach meal.

My husband loved this.  I added peas and corn with the carrots as another reviewer suggested.  It was great.  I love that the broth and flour created a gravy.  And it was easy to assemble.

I followed others advice and put in some Worsteshire with the ground beef (though not quite 1/4 cup, but next time I will omit the ketchup.  It gave it a bit of a sweet flavor.  Still, I loved it!

My husband absolutely detests cooked carrots so I substituted sweet corn.  I roasted a small head of garlic and added it to the mashed potatoes instead of minced onion and since I used ground chicken breast I used chicken broth.  I forgot to add the ketchup but can't see how it would have made it better. Overall this was a good make ahead dish.  I simply reheated it in the oven and ended with it under the broiler for a couple minutes.  My husband said it would be better with more cheese on top but then what isn't better with a little extra cheese?  Definitely recommend the roasted garlic. (Simply cut tops off garlic to expose individual cloves, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil and bake in 400 degree oven until soft)

The Shepherd's Pie was okay. It was kind of bland and didn't have much flare to the flavor. But it's a great recipe if you are looking to use a lot of vegetables. I bet this is a good kid friendly recipe, too.

I also made this, adding brown gravy and worcestershire to the meat before doing layers. I used frozen peas and carrots in the veggie layer. So, making a couple of modifications I give this recipe 5 stars. Without those modifications I think it would have been kind of bland. It was really delicious, though.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and was very pleased with it. The only changes I made was to use 1 tablespoon tomato paste instead of the ketchup and I added 2 cloves of garlic. Also as some other recipes suggested I used Bisto grvy powder to thicken instead of the flour. It was very good. My very picky wife even liked it. Will be making again soon. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly.  My DH absolutely loved it.  That is rare, because he is a picky eater.  The rest of the family loved it too, so it will join our regular menu rotation.  Thank you so much for posting the recipe.

This is a bland meal. I may try it again and add more seasoning to the beef and potatoes to add flavor. NOTE: I made this again per the request of my husband who loves good old meat and potato meals. I added some seasoning to the meat and replaced the carrots with corn and green beans. I liked it much better the second time around and changed my rating. Still not my favorite but it made my husband a happy man!

I made this recipe for my husband and my parents and the cassarole dish was licked clean. My only suggestion is more veggies like peas or corn and I left the carrots bite sized rather then mashing them. Very good.

This was good! I added Worces. sauce while cooking the meat as well, and additional spices: garlic powder, onion powder, red paper flakes. I also used much, much more cheese to the potatoes. I didn't have carrots, but I think their addition plus a can of corn will make this even better next time! Thanks :)

This was yummy!!  I did make changes per previous suggestions.

I added sour cream to the mashed potatos.   I omited the onions due to my honey doesn't like them.  I used one cup of brown gravy and one cup of beef broth.  I also mixed a bag of frozen veggies to the meat mixure instead of mashing up the carrots.

Everyone loved it and it was very easy to make.

A keeper. :)

I made this for our local soup kitchen.  Used frozen peas and carrots, gravy as suggested, cleaned out the fridge and also added ranch dip and cream cheese with chives to the mashed potatoes.  Needless to say, it was a winner.  Wished I had made more for myself.

Growing up in a large family (10 kids) this recipe was made by my mother many, many, times.  One of the first dishes I made when I got married (22 yrs. ago) and still a hit with my family!  Comfort food!  Love it!!!

I made this for a men's dinner and they couldn't get enough.  I followed some of the reviewers suggestions and used the beef gravy packet instead of the broth, added worchstershier sauce-2T or so, used a bag of frozen peas and carrots and added some corn.  I also used cream cheese in the potatoes.

I added some blanched green beans between the carrots and meat.  This was so tasty!

Mmmm, this is great!  Just like the one we had at a restaurant recently.  I souped up the sauce a bit with worcestire sauce and some London Pub Steak & Chop Sauce.  I also poured some of the London sauce on top.  I had to cook the carrots longer than stated to make them soft enough to mush.  It was delicious this way!

This recipes is very good. I read through the reviews first and decided on the following: Cooked ground turkey in a skillet, added 1 diced carrot, 4oz corn, 4oz can of mushrooms, sauteed all. Then added 2T flour, 1 packet beef gravy, 2T ketchup, 2T worchestershire, and 1 cup beef broth. I allowed this to simmer 10 mins or so. I used boxed potatoes. Poured beef mixture in baking dish topped with potatoes and covered with shredded colby jack cheese. YUMMY! With all of the extra added to beef mixture it was very flavorful. My 9 year old ate it, so it's a keeper!! Thanks!! Oh, The flour is a must, so the beef mixture stays firm and not runny!!

This recipe was a huge disappointment, it didn't taste anything at all. I added Worcestershire sauce as some people suggested, but still the ground beef came out totally tasteless.

This turned out great!  I didn't have grnd beef so I use a crock potted chuck roast.  I also used instant mashed potatoes.  I up the amount of ketchup per another review and added a few dashes of A1 sauce.  My 9 year old son had 3 helpings.  Next time I make this I will definitely double it!!

Great Shepherd's Pie recipe. Only thing I would change is the taste of the ground beef. It is kind of bland plain. Will add herbs to give it a punch. I also wouldnt take any recommendation on using canned and instant potatoes, that pretty much cuts down your nutrition to just protein...If you're trying to feed your family do it properly with fresh carrots and potatoes. You'll be pleasantly surprised. I also added some milk to my mashed potatoes to give it a cremier texture! Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe

This was my first attempt at Shepherd's Pie. I made a few modifications & a couple mistakes but it still turned out great! My husband is a very picky eater from Africa and most American dishes do not have enough 'taste' for him but he really liked this dish. I will definitely be making this again. I took a few shortcuts; some for time and some by mistake or necessity. I used instant potatoes, canned peas & carrots, forgot to use flour at all, used boullion but increased the ketchup to 1/4 cup. I also used vinegar in the ground beef - vinegar brings out the flavor in all meats, I use it a lot. Without the flour it was a little wetter than it was supposed to be but it was still very good. I added garlic powder & chopped onion to the potatoes and sprinkled them with a small amount of shredded cheddar 15 minutes before it was done. It will be fun to try this different ways. I am enjoying this website and all the reviews are SO helpful!! Thanks to everyone who offers feedback and thanks to those who put the site together. Kudos to all of you.

This recipe gets 5 stars for being inexpensive but 4 stars for taste.  I definitely will make again, but it's not the type of meal to make for company.

this was soo good. I followed other reviews and added 1/4 cup of worstershire sauce and a packet of brown gravy. Instead of the carrots I added a can of mixed veggies into the meat before simmering. 

Next time I am going to add more ketchup and a layer of creamed corn over the layer of meat instead of the veggies mixed into the meat. I just remembered this is how my mom did it and nothing beats my moms recipe.

My family loved this dinner. They both had seconds. I did have to add more margarine and a splash of beef broth as the potatoes were too thick to spread. I used aged Cheddar and onion powder in the potatoes. Also a little parsley for color in the potatoes. I did not mash the carrots, I mixed them with the meat and topped the meat layer with a layer of a can of corn, then spread the potatoes over. So good my husband asked for a repeat on this one. I did add a cube of beef bouillion and a tsp of kitchen bouquet to the meat. Thanks, what a great meal in one!

This was excellent. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because I didn't think that the carrots added anything.  Next time I would use peas and/or corn to replace the carrots.  Other than that it was excellent and I will make it again.

Delicious!! The only changes that I made were using 3 cups of frozen mixed vegetables instead of carrots, and I didn't mash them. I also added a few things here and there to please my tastebuds (garlic in the potatoes, Worcestershire with the beef). I would have ate it all if I wasn't so full!!

Very yummy.  I made a couple changes.  I took advice of previous reviews and added worchestershire sauce and gravy mix to the meat to season it better and make a slight gravy.  For the potatoes, to make it lighter, instead of adding butter, I mashed in chives, salt and pepper, and lowfat plain yogurt, and cheddar. I just used some frozen mixed veggies (beans, carrots, peas, and corn)for the middle layer. My kids ate it up as did my husband and myself.  I would use this recipe again.

A nice low-sodium approach to shepherd's pie-- without compromising flavor.  Per the other reviewers' suggestions, I used 1/4 c. worchestershire in the beef, which complemented it beautifully.  My husband loved this and we'll definitely be making this one again.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I used a variation of it to fit my family's tastes.  As the ground beef was browning, I added 2 diced onions and 3 cloves of garlic.  Once the ground beef was browned and the onions clear, I added 1 can of mixed veggies, 2 cans of string beans, 1 can of corn, and 2 packages of gravy mix with 2 cups of water.  I also used seasoning salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, cumin, onion and garlic powders.  I let this mixture cook for 5-10 minutes.  I then put in in the baking dish with the mashed potatoes and cheddar cheese.  It was WONDERFULLY seasoned.  This recipe gave me a basic outline for which my family and I are thankful!

We really liked this one...even though I tweaked it big time. I sauteed onion,diced green pepper,and garlic in a little evoo. Added the cooked and drained ground beef to that. I had no beef broth, only a pack of dry brown gravy mix, which I made according to the pack. I added the ketchup to the beef mixture and added 1/2 a bag of frozen mixed veggies (corn,green beans,peas,carrots). I then added the brown gravy,salt and pepper. Placed that mixture in a casserole dish and topped with a pack of instant mashed potatoes which I made according to the package. Added a little more butter to the top and shredded cheese. Covered and baked until bubbely. Everyone really enjoyed this. Good comfort food. Thanks!

This was very good.  I used left over Potatoes and Carrots I had form St. Patrick's Day.  I mashed up the potatoes with sour cream as was suggested by another reviewer.  I used Ground Turkey instead of Beef, and that was also very good.  I used a packet of brown gravy with water and it thickened up the meet mixture nicely.  I also used some Worcestershire sauce to give it a little bit more beef flavor.  I also added a dash of hot sauce to meat mixture for a little kick.  My husband loved it, and it was a great use of left-overs!

Made this dish for the first time on St. Patrick's Day, and we loved it. I made a few changes. I added some garlic powder to the beef, used frozen mixed veggies for a variety, and made garlic mashed potatoes for the top. Served with a salad and biscuits.

I thought this was going to be really good, but it really had no flavor.  I added minced garlic to the onions and worcestershire sauce to the ground beef, I even added the packet of brown gravy and it was still just blan.  I think it has the potential to be good, you just need to add more seasonings.

My sister is a huge carb fan and she was over one day and was hungry.  I looked in my fridge and freezer and I had frozen single servings of this  in ziplock bags. I took 1 serving out and defrosted it and then heated it up for her. She absolutely loved it and wanted more. I forwarded the recipe to her and it is now one of her favorites.

Amazing!  I really could not have been more pleased with this recipe.  I made a few changes, but nothing too drastic- my mashed potatoes just had salt, milk and sour cream in them, I added 3/4 cup corn, and I used ground turkey and added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce.  With the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, the meat portion was delightfully tangy and went perfectly with the sweetness of the vegetables and creaminess of the potatoes.  This turned out very delicious and I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for the idea!

My family loved it!! I followed some of the suggestions with regards to the meat. I added more ketchup, 3 Tbsp worcestershire sauce and a little more broth. Without that, the meat would have been very bland. We also topped ours with Tobasco sauce to add a little kick. Overall, best shephard's pie we've had!!

I had never made this before until last night, and WOW was it a hit! I changed to recipe to my taste because I am very picky. I browned the meat mixed with onion powder, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce.  I added a packet of brown gravy with about a cup of water and a bit of flour. I don't like a lot of veggies so I put green beans and wax beans in the middle. I made at least 6 or 7 potatoes (we LOVE them!), mashed them and added a bit of milk, butter, and some of the cheese.  I topped it off with the rest of the bag of cheese and baked it for 30 minutes. Everyone went back for seconds! I will definitely be requested to make this again!!

My husband makes a Paul Perdone "cajun shepherds pie" that has spoiled me, I guess. This one was much easier, so I was tempted to give it 4 stars. But it just didn't have enough flavor. Texture and everything else turned out nicely. I was surprised the that finely chopped onion in the mashed potato mixture worked out. I was expecting a bite of raw onion with mashed potatoes that never happened.

I made the same changes others had made: 1 packet of brown gravy with 1 cup water, frozen peas/carrots instead of mashed carrots, and no Worcestire sauce.  I just used extra ketchup to make up for not using Worcestire sauce.  I definitely recommend draining the meat once it's cooked...I didn't due to time constraints and I ended up with a thin concoction.  I also simmered the peas and carrots with the gravy.

Pretty good! My husband and kids really liked it. I did add corn and peas and I used shredded carrots instead of mashing them because my husband isnt a big fan of cooked carrots (which is why I added corn and peas). Instant mashed potatoes made this a quick easy and tasty dinner.

With the modifications we made, I'd give this recipe all five stars. We used instant mashed potatoes just to save on time and seasoned with butter, garlic, salt and pepper to taste. Insteat of the carrots we used a 16 oz bag of mixed veggies (i.e. corn, green beans, and carrots) and added them in with the meat. Instead of the beef broth we used the package of brown gravy mix as suggested by others BUT with it we used 1/8 cup worcestershire sauce, 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup red wine (we recently had shepher's pie at a restaurant and it definitely had red wine in it) With these changes it came out so yummy that my 11 year old had four servings. THAT is a keeper!

I fixed this for my in-laws. They all said it was great. I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers. I mixed 1/4 cup worstershire in my hamburger meat before starting anything else. I didn't add onion to my potatoes as hubby doesn't like onions that much. I also only used 1/2 an onion instead of all of one. I used brown gravy mix w/1 cup water instead of beef broth. I added 1/2 bag frozen peas and carrots on top of meat mixture before covering with potatoes instead of just carrots. Easy to make and turned out great!

thanks!  very yummy and w/ a few shortcuts, i.e. instant potatoes, canned corn, very convenient. homemade potatoes, as the recipe calls for, is a def. tho. I also added 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic to the burger and onion and a tbl spoon of worcesteshire. will be putting t his one in my recipe box.

This is the first shepherd's pie I've made and I was very pleasantly surprised.  The only change that I made was omitting the ketchup.  The beef broth and salt and pepper flavored this dish perfectly!

This Shepherd's Pie is delicious but I think it could be better. I did make the suggested changes and added Worstershire and the gravy/water combination to the beef. Also I steamed and sliced the carrots instead of mashing.  But personally next time I will deinetely add a can of corn to the mixture (then I think it would be a 5 star). But it was moist and very yummy.

I changed it a bit as per other people's suggestions so it only gets 4 stars. I added 1/4 cup of Worstechire (sp?) sauce and a bit more broth to make a gravy. I sauteed the carrot & onion in some EVOO took them out and then browned the meat and put them back in with some chopped garlic. Make a very moist and delicious filling. I also made my mashed potatoes more flavorful by adding some heavy cream (1/4 cup) (could use milk or sour cream too)and some garlic powder. I omitted the cheese from the recipe because it didnt need it and I topped it with some sprinkles of paprika and chives for color and it added a great looking color on top.

I love this dish. On the advice of other raters, I added 1/4c worstershire sauce, 2 cloves minced garlic, and about 1c of frozen peas to the meat mixture. Plus, I didn't mash the carrots. I just sliced them and added them to the meat mixture. I also used sharp white cheddar cheese.

I followed suggestions of other users.  Was a bit too much worchestershire - just a bit.  Also, I used the frozen veggies, the green beans didn't have time to soften even though we left it in for 40 minutes.  I have never liked Shepherd's Pie, but I really did like this.  My husband loved it heck it has corn, potatoes, beef and his favorite food group, gravy - what's not for a man to like?  Thanks!

Good comfort food. I've made this with ground beef as well as boca crumbles and I don't think that anyone could tell the difference. I used peas and carrots to give it a bit of texture and also added a bit of worcestershire sauce to the meat. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It is the perfect comfort food. I did what some of the reveiws suggested and added some more seasonings.  I added 1/2 cup of buttermilk to the potatoes and fresh minced garlic. I would have given this recipe more stars if it did'nt need so many changes.  The end result was beautiful.  Good with french bread.

This recipe is good, but needs alot of work. Alot more seasoning needs to be added to the meat or its bland, so I added probably a quarter cup of worcestershire, more ketchup, garlic and seasoned salt and I think it still needed more. The potatoes need milk and more butter to make them smooth and creamy and adding some mixed vegetables is essential. These things helped.

This recipe is great. The only thing I added was the Worcestershire to the beef and I did not mash the carrots just for the looks of it. Simple yet very wholesome flavour. I am not looking any further. Thanks Jacquie!

The potato to meat to carrot ratio seemed off. I would use less potatoes. Also, the beef dried out a bit when it was baked, so it needs a little something to keep it moister. Good flavor though.

I made this yesterday and was pleased with the results.  I added minced garlic along with the onions and cooked them with the beef.  I used more beef than the recipe called for.  I also added Italian spices to the beef.  I found the potatos to be extremely dry so I added more butter and milk.  My husband loved the dish but overall I found it a bit bland.  I will add peas and corn next time and probably some more pepper and salt and most likely other spices.  This was overall a good recipe; very easy to make, inexpensive and makes well more than six servings!

This was just alright to me. I will make again but with some variations. I thought it was a little bland and I felt that the potatoes were took thick so I had to add milk and more butter to them when mixing. I will probably reduce the potatoes to 3 as well because there seemed like to much potato and not enough meat.

I love this recipe and so does my family. The only change I made was to leave the carrots in coins rather than mash. Yummy down home recipe.

This was very good, and easy to make.
I did as some others suggested and added some worshestire sauce. Instead of the cooked carrots I used baby carrots, uncooked but cut into small pieces, and I added some frozen brocolli as well between the meat and the potato. Next time I might add some garlic to the potatoes to add a little extra flavour.

I added 2 garlic cloves to the onions that got mixed in with the meat. Instead of the carrots, I used 1 can of mixed peas/carrots. Instead of the broth and ketchup, I put 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/3 cup of red wine. Also added salt and lots of ground black pepper. My family loved it.

Very good! I did as many others suggested: added Worcestershire sauce , brown gravy mix, and a tad more ketchup to the meat mixture. The meat mixture is just awesome. Instead of mashed carrots, I put a layer of frozen pea/corn/carrot mix on top of the meat. The only thing I think could be better is the mashed potatoes. They were a little bland for me. But that is very easily fixed by using your favorite mashed potato recipe instead! All-in-all, a great meal!!! I will be making this again!

This was AWESOME!  I made homemade mashed potatoes.  I didn't have brown gravy or beef broth, so I added a can of premade brown gravy to the mix.  This was GREAT, thanks so much!

This recipe was absolutely amazing. I never really cared for shepherds pie at all, but when I tried this, I didn't know what was enough.  It's super. I will definately be making this over and over again.  I did add a packet of brown gravy like some of the other reviews mentioned.  This is a winner. Everyone should try this one. Thanks for the recipe

Great comfort food!  I followed this recipe using ground lean turkey and without mashing the carrots (I cut them up and cooked them in beef broth to make them more tender before adding to the turkey mixture) and I also added some lima beans (you could add almost any veggie you like).  I made clean-up easier by using a deep oven-safe frying pan to brown the turkey and simply adding the veggies and mashed potatoes to the pan) - this was delicious and a breeze to make.  Will DEFINTELY make again!!

This is a good start for a shepherd's pie! i used less beef broth, a good irish steak sauce (i use goodall's, if you can find it, try it!) and worcestshire sauce. also i used 2 cloves of garlic and a couple of shallots all put in after the beef was browned and drained. i just kind of toss those things in til it tastes right. the sour cream and butter in the potatoes is perfect!!

This was quite a lot of work but very yummy! I would suggest using the microwave for boiling the potatoes and carrots. Simply cover with water and microwave on high for 5 min. Much faster than doing it on the stove. I agree with other reviewers that the beef needed more flavor and I would probably add add more salt next time.

This turned out great even though I cheated and used instant mashed potatoes and canned peas and carrots.  Also added more ketchup because we like more tomato flavor.  It was great!

YUM O. We had leftover mashed potatoes and leftover steamed carrots from a roast last night, and I stumbled upon this recipe. SO good. Browned the beef and onions together, added 1 cup of broth and added Baby Rays (3 Tblsp) in with the ketchup. Cut the carrots up into dice and added 1/2 cup of diced green beans. Kids and DH loved it on this rainy Seattle night. THANKS! :)

Very good. I tweaked a little by adding a little steak sauce with the ketchup. I also mashed the potatoes with cheese, sour cream and butter. Husband was pleasantly surprised.

I like this recipe so much.  I change it a bit.  I do not use the layer of carrots.  I use frozen mixed vegtables.  I boil them and then sautee them in the meat along with some Worcestershire sauce. My husband loves it.  He says mine is better than some of the pubs he's had it in! Thanks again.

I have been looking for a good homemade sheperd's pie recipe for a while, and this one was excellent!!!  I added 1 1/2 frozen peas and carrots to the beef mixture when it was simmering, as well as 2 tsp. of worchetershire.  I omitted the cheese, as I had none on hand:)  It was so good my boyfriend had the leftovers for breakfast this morning!!

Oooooh, talk about comfort food...stick to your ribs good.  I did the gravy packet suggestion (thank-you), using 1 cup of the potato water and I think that next time I will skip the flour because I love the gravy and the ketchup, because as my son said...it had a "sloppy joe" taste.  I also used frozen peas and carrots (defrosted).  In the potatoes I subbed garlic for the onion.  Thanks for the recipe Jacquie....my sons loved this!

Very yummy meal, good for a cold day. I did make the following changes: I used corn instead of carrots, just a personal preference. I couldnt help but add milk and some garlic powder to the potatoes!! I added a little beef gravy to the meat mixture and omitted the ketchup. 
I found that there were a lot of potatoes and not a lot of meat. When I make this again, I would add at least another 1/2 lb. of meat. I give it a 4 out of 5 only because it didnt WOW me, it seemed to lack a little flavor. Very simple recipe. I served with homemade biscuits. Very yummy will make again!

This is an incredibly good recipe.  I don't like carrots that much, so I used mixed veggies instead.  I also put a little steak sauce in along with the ketchup.  Umm Umm Good!  Oh, and I also used about 1/3 loose sausage in it also.  DELICIOUS!  Thank you for sharing.

Growing up, I never liked Shepherd's Pie, or any casserole for that matter! My tastes have changed however, and I decided I would try making Shepard's Pie for the first time. I saw this recipe and decided to try it. It actually turned out delicious. The only adjustment I made was that I added a little milk and extra butter to the potato; next time around I think I would add more potatoes as well.

Delicious family meal.  To the meat mixture I added worcestershire, and a brown gravy packet with 1 cup water, as previously suggested.  I really liked the taste of the worcestershire, but next time I make it I'll omit the brown gravy.  I used frozen carrot slices, unmashed, and threw a can of corn on top of that--which added a lot of flavor, I thought.  Overall very good!

I never had Shepherd's Pie before, but the recipe sounded so good I had to try it out.  It was very very good!  Everyone in the family enjoyed it.... next time I make it I will take other's advice and add peas or mushrooms, but really this is a very good recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

This is an excellent dish and easy to make. I only make it when I have left over mashed potatoes, but I make extra mashed potatoes on purpose when I want to make this meal.  Most any vegetable tastes good in it too.

I tweak this recipe to make an awesome vegetarian version. I substitute a soy beef crumble for the beef, and also use no-chicken broth instead of beef broth. I like to use a large package of frozen veggies for this (peas-corn-green bean mix). This recipe allows me to get some veggies into my fiance's diet. Tastes amazing!!

Love this!  Didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't follow the whole recipe.  I cooked the onions with the hamburger and I substituted a can of drained green beans for the carrots.  Followed the directions for the gravy and it was awesome!

I love adaptable recipes like this!  I had some extra mushrooms in the fridge so I did a quick saute with the onions before browning the beef.  Then I added some left over mixed veggies plus the chopped/boiled carrots to the beef mixture.  I didn't have beef broth (it was one of those nights where I was making due with what I had on hand) but chicken broth worked beautifully.  I was doubtful the "gravy" would be any good but it was fab.  My husband just raved and raved about this.  Definitely a keeper.

This was my first sheperd's pie and I really enjoyed it.  My Husband is not a big Mash Potatoes fan but he gave this 5 stars.  It was very easy to do. I followed other people's suggestions and used the gravy and replaced carrots with the Costco mixed vegetables.  It was very very good.

Per previous suggestions I skipped the flour and broth and used a package of beef gravy mixture.
I thought it made way too many potatoes for the amounnt of beef and carrots. DH and I also felt the potatoes were way to dry. 
I liked it and will it again but next time I will add a layer of corn and make one less potatoe and add some more milk and maybe a little more butter to the potatoes so they aren't so dry.

I didn't deviate from the recipe other than halving it.  And I thought it came out very very well.  It was delicious.  Maybe I'll try some peas with the carrots next time, but I thought the mashed carrots alone were very good.

I took the advice of several others and used gravy instead of beef broth.  Also, I mixed the carrots (which I microwaved instead of boiled) with 1/2 cup of frozen peas (my husband is not a big fan of peas) and a can of corn.  I added lots of garlic powder to the beef mixture and sprinkled some on the veggies as well.  I will likely make this in the future, but plan on leaving out the carrots.

This recipe is AWESOME! I also changed it up by using mixed vegetables instead of the mashed carrots.  My husband loved the recipe so much I've made it twice in the last month.  We can't get enough of it!  Thanks!

Absolutely fabulous!!  My very picky husband and two sons love this dish!  I blend the carrots in with the beef so the kids don't notice it, and I use beef gracy and bbq sauce in place of the broth and ketchup.  SUPERB!!!!!!

Great recipe!  I made a few alterations as per previous reviewers, i.e., adding a garlic clove to the beef and onions and bumping the ketchup up to 1/4c.  I also used two cans of diced peas and carrots in place of the boiled and mashed carrots - saved a ton of time and effort and was more visually appealing to my 21-month old.  I also omitted the onions in the potatoes but added a little drizzled butter over the top to add a bit more flavor.  To my great delight, my very picky 21-month old ate almost all of it!  This will definitely be a staple in my house - thanks much!

Great. I used other leftover cooked vegi's instead of carrots, but everything was wonderful. The addition of a little flour/stock into the meat really helped it stay together more. I can't wait to try the carrots next time. Thanks!

This is one of the best recipe's I have gotten off of this site. The only thing I changed in the recipe is instead of 3/4 Cup of beef broth, I just boiled 3/4 C. water and mixed it with 6 beef boullion cubes. (I didn't have beef broth and didn't figure it out until I was in the middle of making it) I think it added a lot of flavor to it, and I plan on doing it every time I make it. I would also like to add that as a mother of a 4 year old and 1 year old twins (2 of the 3 are picky eaters) they all gobbled it up and my 4 year old actually asked for more (he hasn't even done that with pizza!) OK, enough. I love it. 5 stars all the way.

I really didn't think my husband would like this recipe because he doesn't like casseroles. He decided to try it and actually had two helpings. A"not bad" from him means he liked it.I thought it was very tasty.  Thank you.

This shepherds pie was quite good - with some changes :)  We had mashed potatoes already left over from Christmas dinner, so I used those and didn't add the onion or the cheese to them.  To the ground beef mixture, I added a lot more onion than what was called for, 1/4 cup of ketchup, 1/4 cup of worcestershire and 1 large clove of garlic (and salt and pepper of course); I also increased the beef broth to 1 cup for added flavour.  Although I did add the mashed carrots and some peas on top of that, my husband and I didn't find the carrots added any flavour at all, so next time, I will probably try it with a can of creamed corn or something. I didn't sprinkle any shredded cheese on top of the potatoes as I have found in the past that the cheese does not add any additional flavour, so I sprinkled about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese - this added a really nice flavour.

I cut the recipe in half, and it turned out pretty good.  However when I added the beef broth, I didn't have enough to bring it to a boil...but whatever.  I also added way more ketchup because I thought the beef needed more flavor.

I did as another reviewer suggested  and added 1/4 cup worcestershire to the ground beef and a packet of brown gravy mixed with 1 cup water instead of beef broth. I like ease so I left out the onions (didn't want to chop and recipe didn't miss them) I used canned mixed vegetables for second layer. I used a 8oz sour cream in mashed potatoes and some half and half to make it creamier. (Do this right before you are going to add the mashed layer so it is creamy and spreads on top easier) I put a pat of butter on top and didn't measure just covered top with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. DELICIOUS.

This recipe was really great especially for someone who's never made a shepherd's pie before such as myself. I did, however, add more flavour and spices to the ground beef because I found it a bit bland. I used allspice, paprika, cayenne pepper and dried oregano leaves and it turned out really yummy! Also, I aded full cream milk to the mashed potatoes to make it softer and easier to spread on the casserole. Overall, this recipe is worth keeping!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I substituted corn for the carrots...I just mixed the corn in with the meat.  I also added about a cup of sour cream to the mashed potatoes which made them even yummier.  The dish had such great overall flavor and it's perfect for a cold evening!

I have to say that this is a wonderful recipe, even when you mess it all up! If you have the basics, it will still be great. Here's my story: I started off with 4 red potatoes (I kept the good looking parts of the skin on) and several small home-grown carrots (but these turned out to be too few--my husband even said "Oh! Are there carrots in here?!"). I almost added some celery, but I found it to be too limp so I skipped it. But it probably would have added a nice dimension. I was also out of onion, so I used some garlic powder and (my personal all-time favorite) Mrs. Dash to help compensate for the loss. I used Olive Oil because it was on hand and I used turkey instead of ground beef--at the last minute. I had purchased ground beef just for this dish, but when I took it out of the fridge, it was a scary color of brown. I wasn't going to risk giving my family food poisoning! So I defrosted some ground turkey and saved the day. This is now a family favorite! I'm sure it will be great the next time I make it the right way--although I'll keep the garlic and Mrs. Dash--but for now, I can't wait for leftovers tonight!

(I just had to come back and say that I made this again with beef, celery, plenty of carrots and an onion and it was just as wonderful. Now I have to try to keep from making it every week. It's very filling and makes for lots of leftovers which is something I like in our house--less cooking and lots of lunches! We love it! Thanks!)

I am not a big fan of Shepherd's Pie but I made it anyways, and it was great! I, too, added garlic to the beef and a little worcestchire and milk and more butter to the mashed potatoes.  (Also added more cheese).  The carrots were quite good in it and the beef had good flavor.  It tastes even better reheated for some reason.

Excellent!!  I doubled the recipe to serve 12.  I added garlic when I sauted the onions.  I also was making this gluten-free for a guest w/ allergies so I used potato flour.  Oh, and I added a bit of milk and sour cream to the potatos.  Very good!!

this was really good but my boyfriend thought the mashed potatoes could taste a little meatier.  next time i'll make less mashed potatoes and cook them in some beef broth.  instead of draining the juice from the meet i'll probably drizzle it on top.  the cheese on top was a great idea.

I follow the recipe only for the ground beef.  I then usually use frozen corn and my standard mashed potatoes.  This recipe gives the beef a very good flavor.

This is a good recipe that's easy to make. I would add more cheese next time and either more ketchup or a can of crushed tomatoes. It needs a little more oomph. Even so, all 12 of my guests had seconds or thirds.

This dish is awesome!  I did substitute half a bag of frozen peas-n-carrots, cooked, for the carrot layer (cause that's the way my mom made shpherd's pie) and the rest is perfect.  Hubby took leftovers to the office and while it was nuking people came in and said "what is that fabulous smell?"  This is now my gold standard for S.P.  Thanks!!!!!

I like this recipe, it's very attractive and colorful to eat, but it's very mild in both taste and texture.  I've made this three times.  Mashing the carrots would go faster if you had a food mill.  I added cooked frozen green beans to the burger mixture for texture.  Next time, I would cook the hamburger with seasoning, such as a seasoned salt and pepper, as well as add some Worcestershire sauce to the ketchup and broth.  I used chicken broth the last time I made it and this didn't seem to be a noticeable change from beef broth.  I also used Monterey Jack the last time instead of Cheddar on and in the potatoes, and that tasted good too.  I'll be making this again, but will try to add more flavor.

Yummy!!  I added about 1/2 cup each of frozen peas & carrots (cooked gently in the microwave, then drained) to the final meat base.  Also used 5 potatoes instead of 4, for a little bigger topping.

I thought this was a great recipe. Instead of ground beef, I actually used a leftover 1-pound meatloaf (heated and separated in a skillet) which gave it great flavor (I left out the ketchup-it was already in the meatloaf). My husband loved it, but the kids weren't too keen on it (not beef eaters).

Great recipe and pretty forgiving if you want to add any extra spices and seasonings. I added worcestershire sauce per another review I read and your typical garlic and onion powder, to taste. I used frozen pre-chopped vegetables (a bag and a half) that contained carrots, corn, peas and green beans. Baked in the oven for the recommended temperature but for a bit longer, 20 min total.

My first time making this. So easy and very tasty!! I added the Worcestershire sauce and used the beef broth with gravy mix.  Not a fan of cooked carrots, so added green beans and corn into the beef mixture. Will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Thumbs up all around! Did not have ketchup, so that wasn't included.  Put in a few chopped baby bella mushrooms I had left over plus mixed vegetables.  Added garlic and a bit of brown gravy. Very good!

Made the recipe according to directions, except I doubled the ingredients and it filled a 3 quart casserole dish.  I baked it for 30 minutes since I doubled it.  Very good!  I liked the layer of mashed carrots.  I actually used canned carrots and that made it easy to mash them.

I made this to take as a meal to a grieving family so I actually did not eat a full serving but when I was putting it together I kept a small amount out for me to taste. It was delicious and very comforting. Also very flavorful. I did make the mashed potatoes the same way I always do with butter and a small amount of milk. I was afraid the potatoes would be too dry otherwise and I didn't want to take a chance with the grieving family but next time I make it I will treat the potatoes as per the recipe instructions. I am very happy to have this recipe.

Simple and hearty, although I took other reviewers‚Äô advice and added Worcestershire sauce and substituted gravy for the broth.  I preferred to chop the carrots and cook them until tender crisp rather than mash them.  I also added some frozen peas.

This is a great recipe for Shepherds Pie, this recipe is very good as is. You can add what you want, and yes it is a cottage pie if you're not using lamb, so what, I added Kale, spinach, carrots, and corn. it was fab.

My family LOVES this! I added 1/4 Worcestershires sauce while the meat was browning, then added 2 tablespoons of flour & ketchup and 1 cup of water with gravy mix based on other reviews. Once this starts to thicken 1 add a healthy amount of frozen mixed vegetables and it is so flavourful and creamy. Thank you for this amazing recipe that makes for a great and quick weekday meal when made ahead!

I made the recipe as is. I would make again with some changes such as making the mash potatoes creamier and adding some kind of spice to the carrots. The bland carrots in the middle with the semi dry potato didn't work for me. But the while family ate it. Even my daughter who hates carrots.

Taking other reviews into consideration I only made two changes and added Worcestershire sauce and a brown gravy packet. This recipe is very good and I will be making it again!

So good. This is the first time I didn't need gravy with shepherd's pie. Variation: only used corn as that's all my husband will eat.

The beef mix tastes savory and has a rich onion flavor. Beyond that, I recommend using two potatoes. The potatoes, despite having onion and cheese in them, were surprisingly bland. This was my first shepherds pie, so maybe it's supposed to taste this way. I would redo this one with two potatoes and add milk or something to give them more kick.

Ok I made Shepard's Pie over 20 years ago. Maybe even 25 years ago. This very rarely happens to me as a matter of fact only twice in cooking since middle school have I made something so terrible I could not fix it. That was the case with my Shepard's Pie 20-25 years ago. A 9x11 Pyrex pan full with Wendy standing over me saying "I told you so."

That brings me to this week. I heard on K love , while they were playing their five songs (miss you Daniel Berry) , that the most Googled recipe on the internet is...................., Shepherds pie. This brought back the sour memories, and "I told yo so's. And I of course Googled , Shepard's Pie. This recipe is vindication for the epic fail 20-25 years ago. This is delicious even though I didn't have shredded cheese and used instead real cheese slices. I added a good tablespoon of cream cheese in the potatoes and followed comment suggestions with some extra garlic, of course, in he hamburger and maybe a couple of tablespoons is woshestershire sauce in hamburger.

This one is a keeper.

Added Worceshire sauce and some brown gravy powder mix to the beef. Added mixed veggies. Boiled the carrots (cut in half) with potatoes to cut time and then mashed them separate from the potatoes. Did not add onion to potatoes. Delicious!

Very tasty.  I took another member's advice and added 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce to the meat (after cooking), and I think that is crucial; otherwise the meat would be very bland.  I used 3 russet potatoes, and there was just too much potato for the dish, so you would be fine with 2 russet potatoes.  My daughter and husband liked it, although husband had to add hot sauce.  I really enjoyed the meet, and next time might just omit the potatoes altogether if I needed to get dinner on the table quickly.

This is so good that I hide the leftovers in the fridge ( in a butter tub container) so I dont have to share them. 

I love Shepards pie.  I had never had it with carrots before and I was a bit skeptical but followed the recipe anyways. At first I was not sure if I liked the carrots but the next day when eating some leftovers my opinion changed. The carrots give it a sweet flavor and make the whole dish in my opinion.  I run my carrots through the food processor and make a puree. 

I always make more than one batch of this at a time and freeze the others so I can pull out later and bake.

I made some changes others suggested. I used 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce, a packet of brown gravy and one cup of water.I left out the carrots as I had none and also the beef broth. I added a cup and a half  of frozen peas, one can each of whole kernel corn,  green beans, and diced tomatoes.
My wife asked for seconds and thirds. ( she liked it) 
This was my first attempt at Shepherds Pie, and I am pleased.
My problem when I cook is I never follow a recipe, I will throw this or that in, keep this or that out. Never measure and can never remember how I made it. My wife says to write it down, but I am to busy.
I use a recipe as a guide only.

We have made this a few times now and we absolutely love it. We do add 1/4 C of Worcestershire sauce to the gravy mix and we also like to pipe the potatoes on top so the peaks get crunchy and give a little bit of texture. Thank you for the recipe!

I halved the recipe and used 3 medium potatoes. I added 1/2 cup sour cream and lots of garlic and paprika to my mashed potatoes. I put all of the cheese on top instead of mixing it in. I used about 450g of grass-fed ground beef and used extra beef broth for the beef mixture, and added 2 tbsp of worcestershire sauce, a can of carrots and peas, and a can of corn niblets, and lots of extra garlic and cayenne pepper. I subbed tomato paste for the ketchup. It made 4 generous servings.

I strictly remember as a child my mum made this when we had leftover spaghetti bolognese or mince stew or a lot of mashed potatoes from other dishes. I think it tastes better when it's made with leftovers rather than just from scratch. There's no strict ingredients you have to add other than the meat and potatoes on top so have fun with it and experiment as you go :)

Followed others and added 3 gloves of garlic, small onion, pepper  to cooked and drained hamburger also added one packet of gravy mix with one cup water and 2 tbs flour.   Mixture of hamburger cooked for about one minute and thickened up.  Used  frozen mixed veggies layered on top of hamburger.  Two envelopes of pkg  instant potatoes (one was sour cream and other was smoked cheese)  also layered shredded cheese in between packets of potatoes.  Topped it all off with cheese and garlic hives!

Came out really delicious! I did add 1/4 cup of worstershire sauce. I also used the same white onion in the potato and beef. Used a little less ketchup. I would also allow a little more time, maybe it's just me but the whole thing took about an hour and a half.

Very good.  I made a few crutial changes to this recipe in order to arrive at perfection: add 1/4 cup of worstershire to the ground beef mixture before cooking. Also, added a can of beef consume (instead of 3/4 c. beef broth) and stir into the browned and floured meat mix to simmer for 5 min. Add a packet of hearty grav This gives the meat a little bit of gravy, which the mashed potatos love!  I add 8-10 oz. of frozen peas and carrots right on top of the meat mix and before the mashed potatos. It tasts great and adds color to the dish. Also put the cheese on top of the mashed potatoes!

Family Loved it!   I mixed dry onion soup mix packet and 2 T of Worcestershire to a 10 oz can of beef broth.  I left the carrots chopped instead of mashed and added frozen corn (cooked first).

Took a while to make it because I used regular potatoes instead of instant ones. Next time I will try instant potatoes and frozen vegetables. It was very good but time consuming.

I think this recipe could have used some more flavor. Next time I will use a vinegar, wine or Worchester sauce. Also, I am eager to remake it with turkey, parsnips and sweet potatoes.

I love this recipe - I did add some half and half to the potatoes as they were very dry - I would add more than 5 carrots to have the layer cover the 2 quart dish and I added worchestshire sauce as many reviews did and it added a lot of flavour.  Will make again.

Absolutely loved it. After reading all the reviews, I did make minor changes because it did sound like a bit bland for my taste. I added a Tbs. of Worcestershire sauce to the meat along with about a tsp. of Thyme. I used instant mashed potatoes because I had giant box of them from Costco. I sprinkled some roasted garlic powder into the potatoes. I also added frozen peas and corn as many others did. The base recipe is wonderful, though, and the changes don't destroy the integrity of the recipe, so I don't mind giving it a five-star rating. Great comfort food on a winter night!!

Super delicious! Followed other raters' advice and added Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef. Also used tomato paste instead of ketchup. Used 1 packet of brown gravy mixed with 1 cup of water instead of beef broth and subbed in a bag of frozen peas and carrots. I also ditched the cheddar cheese and sprinkled parmesan on top for a crispy top. Will make this one again!

Definitely need the Worcestershire sauce, or else the dish would have been too bland. I would use more towards 1.5 lbs of ground beef, otherwise it seems like there would be too much potato in the casserole ratio. Overall, it‚Äôs pretty good. But mostly just tastes like glorified mashed potatoes (but maybe that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs supposed to taste like?)

Used 1 lb ground lamb, didn't cover the base of the pan quite fully. Don't skimp on the onion! Tastes great in this. I used beef bouillon--mixed with potato water before adding to meat. Tip: if the layer of mashed potatoes seems 4x thicker than the other layers, don't fret. It'll taste fine. (I did add about 4 handfuls of spinach to my potatoes...) And leave some big chunks! Sneaking veggies into this is so easy--what a neat dish to take to lunch!

I don't think there is enough meat or flavor in this dish. The potatoes could have used some cream.

The recipe came out well for the 1st time making it.  I would say that the time to make it was much longer for me but that might get better after a few times.  I added red pepper & capers to the dish as a special touch.

I loved this recipe! It was full-bodied with plenty of flavor! I've been looking for a Shepherd's pie recipe, but many seemed too complicated and long. Too many ingredients and too much time. This was extremely simple and quick. I even used Bob Evans garlic mashed potatoes to save some time and I added Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. The family loved it, especially the kids.

I made the recipe as it is except for Ketchup. I used Worcestershire sauce instead. The family said they liked it. Must have loved it as there were no leftovers by the next morning.

My only complaint is that this recipe should call for more than 4 large potatoes to cover the entire casserole.  My 4 potatoes looked like just a crumbly topping to the casserole so I knew it definitely needed more.  I boiled the carrots and potatoes at the same time to save on time, but I feel there was a lot of prep so I would never use this during the week when there isnt a lot of time to prep for a family dinner.  The taste was okay, but it‚Äôs not a definite rotation in to my weekly meal plan.

Made a couple of substitutions.  Cooked salted ground beef with onion, then added abour 4 baby bella mushrooms, chopped and 1 carrot chopped.  Didn't do the mashed carrot mix.  Used about 1 cup of broth instead of 3/4. Added 2 T worcestershire to the cooked meat, along with the 1 T ketchup.  Added about 1 c frozen carrots to the mix and put in a 1-1/2 qt round pyrex casserole.  Used leftover mashed potatoes to spread over top.  I'm refrigerating this before work, so I'll have bake it for about 45 minutes (I'm guessing).   The filling tasted good, so I have high hopes for tonight! Thanks for the recipe.  Love recipes that don't call for cans of things!

I chose not to mash the carrots only because my family loves carrots and the ones I used was incredibly sweet.  Plus no cheese was added and it was still delicious.   My husband‚Äôs not a big fan of spuds but he still loved it.  It was a big hit, yes I would definitely make this dish again!

This was my first time making a Shepherds Pie. It was so good and so easy to make. Everyone really liked it. The only thing I did different was double the recipe for a 9X13 and added worchester sauce to the ground beef and gravy.

Loved it. This is a great recipe for Halloween. Very colorful with the cheese, carrot and mashed potatoe layer, looked like a candy corn. Think i will make again for Halloween.
Made a few changes. I cooked lean ground meat on the stove then drained. I sauteed onions red yellow and green bell pepper and garlic then mixed that with the beef. I sprayed the bottom of the glass baking pan. Put the meat and sauteed stuff in. Then i made a homemade cream of mushroom soup but  added flour to make thicker and added sour cream and cream cheese. Poured that on top. Did not use ketchup because my father in law can't have that. Then put tons of shredded medium cheeder cheese then a layer of mashed carrots with a touch of thyme. and the mashed potatoes on top with a touch of chedder to garnish.  Everyone devoured it. Just one servimg left out of a double recipe.

I just made this for company and all loved it. This is truly comfort food! It takes a while to make. My husband and I worked together. I always use lean ground beef as I am a health nut. I made this along with blueberry walnut salad which is really simple and  you  can find it on all recipes and I buy frozen rolls in the freezer section in grocery and they come out like freshly made. I only made 3 things and it was enough with a yunmmy dessert.

I had leftover elk meatloaf and I was tired of eating it again, so I cut it up, sauteed the crumbles, added the flour, water, ketchup and broth powder and waited til it was thickened... I tried and liked it, no need to adjust.then i put cooked peas and carrots on top, topped with instant mashed and cheese.... baked and I got all thumbs up from hubby and daughter and report no leftovers..... I am not a big shepherd pie fan but this is sooo good. Thanks for the recipe.

Instead of doing mashed carrots, like they called for, I diced them into small pieces. I also made a different mashed potato recipe than they instruct. I'm not the biggest fan of cheese, so I didn't add any of that, and- looking back at the recipe- I skipped a whole section of the recipe (which is probably why I thought it tasted plain).

It was absolutely delicious but took way longer than advertised! It was the first time I tried to follow a recipe and it worked beautifully! The carrots gave it a good sweetness. Nice and simple recipe but would definitely recommend.

Outstanding.  Followed the recipe to the letter but also took a few suggestions from fellow reviewers.  Do yourself a favor and add a healthy amount of worchestshire sauce to the beef.  It added a great flavor.  Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe! I‚Äôve made it over a dozen times now, it‚Äôs that good. I did take one of the users advice of adding 1/4 cup Worcester sauce, plus a sachet of gravy mix and 3/4 cups of water to the beef mixture.....instead of what the recipe calls for. Added about 2 1/4 cups of mixed veggies and then topped the whole thing with mashed potatoes (omitted the onion). I sometimes sprinkle a couple handful of shredded cheese on top. Yum yum!

I have made this twice now. I think the beef broth makes the dish  a keeper. I did buy bratwurst and took the meat out of the casing and used that as the only meat. The second time I made it I used hamburger and the bratwurst. So good!

I'm giving it 5 Stars. I used majority of the Original Recipe but used the changes from User - Sciota & I have a way of making my own Mashed Potatoes... Let me tell you...This has been a BIG, HUUUUUGE Hit with my Family. They literally devour the whole entire pan of it.  Love this Recipe.

I didn't use the chicken broth instead I had some tomato sauce left over that I put it on.  I also put on the meat BBQ sauce + 3tb spoons of worcestershire sauce for a little bit of a kick.  I also added eggplant and zucchini to the meat  so I ended with 2 dishes instead of one !!  Plus the family ate more veggies.  I also cooked some cauliflower and mashed with the potatoes that I reduced to half, in that way I made it 50% paleo.  I didn't mashed carrots, instead  I used frozen carrots and peas !

I added a bit of Worcestershire sauce but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. I already had some yummy leftover mashed potatoes, so preparation was pretty easy. This was delicious!

It was okay,  needs moisture, maybe more gravy in the meat because this was very dry and bland.   This recipe has rave reviews and I wanted to try it for the carrot mash but I will stick with my old tried and true recipe. The family agrees.

This recipe was good, but I'm not sure I would make it again.  I did enjoy the meat mixture, but I seemed to have excess potatoes, which made for a really thick top layer that did not seem to want to crisp up.  I would adjust the amount of potatoes and use a wide, shallow pan to ensure that the topping gets nice and crisp.  It was fun to try this one out.

Even with the gravy mix et.al, it could have used a bit more spice.  Also, it's not big enough; double everything.

Fantastic taste and appearance.  I upped the amounts a little so I would have leftovers.  I used 5 large potatoes and 1.5 lbs ground beef.  I added 1/4 Worcester sauce and a cup of beef broth to the ground beef after cooking to make the gravy.  I used a layer of cut, cooked carrots, and thawed peas and corn between the potatoes and beef - looked great with the contrasting colours.  This fit perfectly into a 2.5 ounce casserole dish.  I had to bake longer - for 30 minutes and an additional 5 on broil to brown the top nicely.

Really good! I don't know if it is a "classic" sheperd's pie, but it tasted delicious. The potatoes might be a little too dry for some, so I think adding some milk, more butter, or other liquid could smooth them out and make it less paste-like.

Instead of beef, I used shredded leftover pork tenderloin (~ 1/2 lb), scaled the recipe down to 5, and it came out great! I sauteed the onion briefly, added the pork and flour, then the broth, some garlic and onion powder, ketchup and few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. It made a nice gravy with the meat. I used 1 chopped carrot that I boiled briefly, and mixed with a handful of frozen peas that I nuked briefly. The potatoes (used Yukon gold) came out so good, I could eat a whole bowl of those alone!  I added extra cheese (a Mexican blend) to the potatoes because why not? This was total comfort food for a cold, rainy winter day! Great recipe!

Awesome! Added a little cinnamon, allspice, oregano, garlic powder and basil to the meat while  simmering.  Boiled 5 cloves garlic with potatoes and mashed those in too with a little milk..very little (1/4 cup at most) just needed to soften mash a little.   What a tasty, hearty dish....my son demolished his portion and he doesn't always finish my newly tried recipes.

Excellent recipe to build on! I used a layer of mixed frozen carrots and peas that I boiled and added on top of the meat layer, then added potatoes and cheese. Also, add about 1/4-1/2 cup of Worcestershire and Club House gravy mix to the meat to add flavour, otherwise the meat layer would be absolutely bland. Very easy recipe to make, and easy to make a little leaner by swapping the beef with chicken.

I used mixed vegetables instead of peas, added another 1/2 lb. of ground beef, extra onion and added about 7 oz. of canned beef gravy for a creamier texture. This was based on looking at several other recipes. Net results, everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe just as I had fixed it. I'll make it again very soon.

Very delicious. I sauteed the butter with 2 large cloves of garlic before adding the the potatoes. Doubled (probably - who measures?) the cheese, added paprika to the potatoes. I only partially mashed the carrots to keep some texture, and added a little curry and turmeric to them. I used red onions in the meat mixture, as well as a little curry powder, and generous pepper. (Next time, I'll sub in some sriracha and worstershire for the ketchup, I think.) Other additions: 1 can of corn between the carrot and meat layers, a generous sprinkle of green onions and cilantro on top after baking, for fun!

Excellent dish! I tweaked it as others did. I added Worcester sauce to the ground beef and a few teaspoons of Knorr Beef stock (powder). I made the mashed potatoes the way I usually do - with a little milk, s&p, parsley and several tablespoons butter and some garlic powder. I added a layer of frozen corn and used sharp (old) cheddar - but doubled the amount.

Potatoes are bland. Meat also kind of bland. Needs about twice the cheese. I will search around for  anther recipe.

I really liked this recipe. Make sure to taste potatoes and beef as you go. I did add veggies; corn, kale, garlic and broccoli. Delicious!

This my first time making shepherd's pie and I did tweek the recipe per some other user's recommendations. I used Worcestershire sauce and gravy in the beef, did not use ketchup or flour. I also put the cheese on top instead of in the mix. Pretty good, and my boyfriend approved as well.

Good all around recipe in one dish - meat, vegetable, dairy.  I didn't add enough salt but that can always go in later when it is on your plate.

This is a great base recipe. 

I used duck stock instead of beef broth for a little different gravy depth. I saut√©ed crimini mushrooms in butter and garlic then started the layering with meat on that. (it gives the mushrooms a crispy crust-like depth) Then I used frozen corn on meat. Sprinkled Chipotle powder on that.

Mashed potatoes were next; made them with garlic powder, salt, fresh ground pepper, butter and whipping cream.

Topped with sharp cheddar cheese.

I cooked it all in one large cast iron pan so it can go straight from the stove top to oven until the cheese browned up nicely.

I followed the previous reviewer's tips. I also used ground turkey/ground lamb.

Caution: 
1)	If you are using ground turkey, go easy on the Worcestershire sauce. Use a little less than ¬º cup. Also, go easy on salt. I did not use any in mine, because the combination of cheese, butter and Worcestershire sauce gave the right amount of salt in this dish.
2)	Do NOT overcook the potatoes. I made that mistake, because I thought it would help mashing them later, but no, it just made the pie soggy and it sank.
3)	Be aware that most brown gravy contains beef. I had to specifically look for one that doesn‚Äôt have it. Found it in Walmart.
4)	If you want this to be prepared fast, be ready to use 3 pots. Turkey, potatoes, vegetables.

Pot 1, boil potatoes with some salt. In Pot 2, I boiled carrots and every other leftover, mash-able vegetable which does not have a very distinct flavor from each other. This dish was a good way of getting rid cleaning out the fridge. I would not overdo it though. DO NOT OVERCOOK POTATOES (You can reserve the water from these 2 pots to be made into vegetable stock later). DO NOT ADD MORE THAN LISTED butter to the potatoes, because that makes the pie soggy too.

While those are boiling, I browned 1 cup of red onion, added 1.5 lbs ground, lean turkey. Added 2 tbsp of flour. Added 2 tbsp of ketchup. Added just a little below ¬º cup of Worcestershire sauce. Added 1 packet of brown gravy. Added 1 cup of water. A dash of paprika. Generous sprinkle of black pepper. L

This was good and I will make it again but I think it needed more meat and less potatoes. I think some more veggies rather than just carrot may be a good addition.

Really good! I skipped the  oil for frying and I only had 3 carrots, so I peeled/sliced them and also added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables.  I did add the worcestershire sauce as previous comments suggested. However, next time I will try adding a jar of gravy to give more moisture.

Make sure you salt (and don't skimp) the water for boiling the potatoes and carrots, especially the potatoes because potatoes are always better with salt!  After mashing, I added a large amount of pepper to the potatoes as well as some heavy cream.  I doubled the ketchup because I am a ketchup fanatic.  It came out amazing!  I will be making this again.

I‚Äôve made this recipe numerous times, and it has never failed! Delicious! Last night a made a couple changes due to the ingredients I had left in the fridge. Instead of potatoes, I used sweet potato. Instead of beef, I used chicken, and chicken broth. I also cut the cheese out. I used 2 tablespoons of ketchup with siracha hot sauce......and the result was amazing!

Very good, I used vegetable broth because that is what I had on hand. But it turned out delicious and I really don't think affected the flavor. When I make again I will however, reduce the amount of broth and make the mashed potatoes my own way. I also added corn in the ground beef.

As mentioned in some of the other comments , onions and cheese do not belong in the potato topping. The onions are browned with the ground beef.   I simmered the meat in the beef broth for about 10 minutes before adding steamed peas and carrots  (not smashed)..   I used red potatoes with half-and-half for a creamier potato topping . I also used extra sharp cheddar for the topping.
The recipe listed has the basics, however if you have never made this before, you would be a bit confused.
Overall, I would make it again with my modifications.

Very good! I used a packet of GF brown gravy mix to sub for flour and to give it some extra flavor. I also added some chives and oregano and buttermilk to the mashed potatoes. Go light on the salt (I nixed it completely) if you use a gravy packet as  it usually has enough salt for the entire dish.

Excellent! Followed changes others suggested- worchestire sauce, seasoning the meat, and using brown gravy mix instead of beef broth. My 8 year old picky eater LOVED it! This is the only recipe I'll use for this from now on.

I recently ordered Shepherd's Pie at an Irish-themed pub, which was totally out-of-character for me, but I wanted something I could share with my 1-year-old.  I ended up enjoying it quite a lot.  This past weekend, I had thawed out some ground beef with the intention of making meatballs, but didn't end up feeling like meatballs, so decided to find a Shepherd's Pie recipe instead.  I came across this recipe, and with a few tweaks, it turned out great.  As per feedback from other reviewers, I added 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture.   And for the beef broth, I heated it and added Bisto brown gravy mix.  (I use "no salt added" broth at home, which can admittedly make food taste a bit bland at times.)  And finally, instead of using fresh carrots and mashing them, I used frozen peas, carrots and corn, boiled beforehand and DID NOT mash them.  In my opinion, the recipe "as is" warrants four stars, and with adjustments, five.  (I do think it's the Worcestershire sauce that made all the difference!)

was very good.  Needs more than 1lb of ground beef.  Also next time season the beef with garlic & onion powder. try adding 1/4 cup of worstershire to the ground beef mixture before cooking. Without this, the meat is too bland. Also, add a packet of brown gravy mix to 1 cup of water (instead of 3/4 c. beef broth) and stir into the browned and floured meat mix to simmer for 5 min

I have made this several times now, but I admit that I have changed it up a bit.   I follow the directions for making the ground beef mixture, but then I add a couple cans of veggies to the meat  instead of layering them on top. Green beans, corn, and carrots  all work well.  When I don't have beef broth, I use chicken broth instead and that seems to work fine.  Topping with instant mashed potatoes is much easier than homemade, unless I have leftovers to use The cheese on top is optional, but is pretty good.  makes for an easy, comforting meal!

My family loved this. We made for a Game of Thrones party. I did change it up according to some suggestions from other users. I added some Worcestershire sauce to meat and I layered the potatoes and cheese first and topped with corn bread.

At first I was a little hesitant with the carrots, but thought I'd try it and it came out amazing.
Love it, one of my favourite Shepard's Pie recopies

Comes out delicious every single time. I've done this recipe with ground lamb, beef, and turkey. It never disappoints, though I do find the prep time to be extensive. Either way, it's well worth it.

I did as a previous cook did and added Worchestershire Sauce and brown gravy. Flavor was very good but it was a bit too runny.  Would like it better if the layers held their own and didn't mush.

We've tried the basic recipe and the modified version described in Erin0220's review. The basic recipe is 4-star good, but doing the version described in Erin0220's review made it 5-star delicious.

I made this last Friday night to take to a pot luck.The only thing I changed was I sub the beef with turkey and it was a big hit and the first thing to go at the pot luck, I love this recipe for being so easy and all so good.

Loved the recipe for the mashed potato part. I didn't bother mashing the carrots - just chopped them and sprinkled over the meat. I also added Salsa to the meat for extra flavour. A keeper.

Jacquie,

Perfect as written!  I followed your recipe to the T.  Perfect.  Admittedly, I will make again and again but must confess that I will likely use instant potatoes and frozen and/or canned veggies in the future.  Mostly because I plan ahead poorly and, I'm lazy.

This was very good! Will make again. Added 1 tbs of.minced garlic and 1/4 cup Worcestershire to beef and an extra tablespoon of ketchup. Added corn to mix with carrots.  Also add milk to the potatoes to make them smoother.

I did add oregano, 1 T of worcheshire sauce,  and garlic to the meat mixture and used red wine instead of beef broth because I did not have any at home.
Very good, whole family liked it.

Even my super picky 7yo ate it! I found her with a spoon in the kitchen after dinner eating from the pan. That never happens. I skipped adding onion to the potato but red onion is great in the beef layer.

It came out a bit dry. I would add cream and more butter to the potatoes. A friend suggested using creamed corn for the veggies.

I've made this a whole bunch of times, and it's my favorite shepherd's pie recipe. I've gotten rave reviews on it. I don't even order shepherd's pie in most restaurants anymore because most can't hold a candle to this recipe. I made it as instructed first (I always do) and I give the recipe as written 5 stars. I have tweaked it over the years, partly based on personal preference and partly based on convenience. I've made it with instant mashed potatoes (I know-*gasp*, but when time is a factor it helps). I've added a brown gravy packet and some worcestershire (please forgive the spelling) sauce to the meat after it's cooked. I almost always use ground turkey instead of beef, so this helps jazz it up a little. And I almost always double the recipe because it gets gobbled up so quickly. And I stopped mashing the carrots, it takes extra time and I find sliced carrots more visually appealing anyway. I noticed in the photo what appear to be peas, so I tried throwing peas in with the carrots and that's yummy too, if you like peas.

Delicious. I made this previously according to the recipe and it was good. I loved it with a few adjustments though. I added a little milk to the potatoes to make them creamier. I added about 1/8 cup worsteshire and au jus gravy packet with 1 1/4 cup water to the beef. I topped the beef with carrots, peas and corn. Yummmm. So flavorful.

OMG  This was the bomb.  I will for sure make this again.  The only thing I did different was to use green beans instead of carrots.  I also had a home made pie crust in my frig that I wanted to use so I placed all the goods into the pie crust.  I know its more calories, but it was so very good.

Quick to make and bake!  It was a hit with the family, which is always a plus. Only thing I did differently was added an egg to the mashed potatoes so they would keep their shape better.

My husband said it was "fine",  I didn't care for it.  It was sorely lacking in seasonings.  If I were to make it again, I would add garlic salt & pepper to the hamburger and I would add more garlic salt & pepper to the potatoes as well as more butter.  I don't really see the point of mashing the carrots either.  You could just add the cooked carrots to the hamburger mixture.  Also the picture shows peas but the recipe didn't call for them.  I added them.

Very good. Made a few changes though. Instead of mashing the carrots I just diced them and added on top of meat, along with frozen peas and carrots. I didn't mix any cheese in with the potatoes, but I did add it to the top of them before baking.
Will definitely make again, might try the gravy Worcestershire addition.

A little bland and next time I will make a few changes, such as adding Worcestershire sauce like others have recommending, instead of mashing carrots I will leave in small cubes.  Also could go for some extra spices.

I used peas and carrots (not mashed) and followed the advice of precious commenters with brown gravy mix and 1 cup water instead of beef broth! Instant potatoes worked beautifully! Super easy and insanely delicious!

I liked this recipe because it was easy and tasty. I made a few changes based on some of the reviews I read and just out of sloth, necessity, and personal preference. I added a bit of Worcestershire sauce to the beef while I cooked it. Then, instead of dicing up an onion (this was both lazy and my last onion was looking very sad) I mixed 1 and a half cups of no salt added beef broth with 1 and a half tbsp of onion soup mix and then whisked in 2 tbsp of flour. Since I'm not a fan of carrot mash, I just tossed some frozen mixed veggies in with the beef when it was browned. When the veggies had more or less warmed up, I poured in my broth mixture in and let it simmer until it thickened, stirring frequently. I used red potatoes and left the skins on (because I like the texture) and mashed them with some melted butter and sour cream, then added the cheese.
It turned out really well and I will certainly be making it again.

Made too many changes to give honest review but only bc I used ingredients on hand.  We loved the outcome, had been a long time since making a shepherds pie and found it a nice change. Thanks for sharing.

Next time I will add more beef broth.  I used 1 1/2 lbs GB and it was way to much.  The flour and the gravy mix made it really stiff and not soupy enough.  BUT, the taste was great.  I will definately make it again.

Delicious! I've been looking for a good Shepherd's Pie recipe and this is the best yet. The recipe was followed very closely except I used 1 bag of frozen mixed vegetables instead of the mashed carrots and added minced garlic and 2 tbsp of Worcestershire to the ground beef. Perfect! Never thought I'd see my family eat Lima beans but they cleaned their plates at this meal! Thanks Jacquie for such a great recipe!

Great baseline recipe, very flexible. Worcestershire and garlic are a must for me, adjust for your tastes. This time I was out of carrots but added frozen peas, and some chopped tomato that needed to be used.  At least double the ketchup.
I make a packet of store gravy in the pan I cooked the meat in, to get all the yummy fond AND less dirty dishes.
Boxed instant potatoes are perfect for topping. I doctor it with garlic powder and dollop it on top to form irregular piles, and a blast from the broiler instead of a few minutes bake time makes it golden. Top with chopped green onions.

I made this recipe and substituted a package of instant mashed potatoes, to cut down on the prep time.  I also added a layer of a half a package of frozen peas on top of the hamburger and onion.  We really enjoyed the taste of the finished casserole.  It made for another meal of leftovers too, which rewarmed well.  I definitely plan to add this recipe to one of my regulars.

I have made this several times, with a few changes to suit my family. I add a teaspoon of minced garlic along with the onion, and use the Better than Bouillon low sodium beef base for the liquid. I do not mash the fresh carrots, just slice them small, and layer them. I do add frozen peas and corn to the meat mixture (about a 1/2 bag each). Along with biscuits, it makes a great meal.

Very good but the beef mixture was a touch more watery. I would add the can of condensed beef broth and not dilute it with any water. 

Modification: used frozen carrots, corn, peas added to the beef mixture directly. Added a cube of bouillion, doubled the ketchup, added a few tablespoons chopped parsley and some italian seasoning.

This is a delicious and easy recipe, definitely a keeper! I followed the recipe except for using 1lb of ground sausage rather than plain ground beef, and I also added a layer of frozen peas between the meat and carrot layers. I used a little extra butter and a little extra cheese in the mashed potatoes, because more of those never hurt anyone, right? ?? I added pepper to taste on top of the mashed potato layer before sprinkling cheese on top as well. What a tasty, hearty, filling meal for a cold and rainy day, I highly recommend it.

Pretty tasty. Served it with honey buttermilk biscuits. Added corn and peas to the bottom layer of meat for a bit of extra flavor. Also added some extra butter when mashing the potatoes. From the taste of it after baked, it definitely needed it. Could have used a bit more too. A bit of butter and pepper in the carrots was used too and that was delish.
Enjoy!

I didn't care for it. This recipe, although popular, I find, has many issues.  Some examples... adding Ketchup?!? and adding onions to the mashed potatoes?!?, No herbs or spices just salt and pepper etc.

Added milk and more butter to the mash. Didn't mash the carrots. Added some heat to give the meat a bit more kick. With this recipe anyone can make a solid Shepherd's Pie. Recommend it!

Happy with how this turned out. I took the advice of the most helpful reviews and added brown gravy mix with water as well as A-1 sauce to the ground beef. I also added buttermilk to moisten the mashed potatoes and tripled the cheese that the recipe called for... yum! Also added canned corn -adds a nice crunchiness and sweetness to the dish. Did not mash the carrots, left them chopped -just how i like them. (For my own reference next time I make this -I know the recipe didn't call for this but  I think I'll get a different brand of gravy mix, the flavor of the McCormick brown gravy mix wasn't my favorite)

I didn't use carrots I used  corn. I used 2 tablespoons of ketchup for a little more flavor and about half an onion . I have a  a very very picky eater and this is the first time EVER  in eight years of cooking for him that he went back for seconds! Yes I will be making this again!

I made this with ground turkey and a package of frozen mixed vegetables, and after 15 minutes in the oven, I turned on the broiler for another few minutes to really give it a nice, golden brown crust. It tasted delicious, this was a great recipe!

I only made a couple modifications but this turned out great.  First I bought fresh peas and cubed carrots and under cooked them so they could get more tender.  Did not mash the carrots as stated.  I also cooked the entire thing in a cast iron skillet and it came out crusty goodness.  Also if you can find it, do 50/50 beef and Lamb.  You wont regret it.  For a different take on this add 1-1/2 Tbs of Curry powder.

this was fantastic- the perfect comfort food for my family. i actually wish that i had doubled the recipe & will do so next time because the leftovers were so yummy. i did tweak the recipe a bit after reading other's reviews: 
-added a hefty pour of worcester sauce & a packet of brown gravy mix, also a healthy squeeze of ketchup
- i used two bags of frozen vegetables (peas, carrots & corn) steamed & then added as the layer on top of meat. i used mashed potatoes that i had leftover from christmas, these were super rich & delicious (made with cream cheese, butter, parmesan). i waited until the last 10-15 minutes to add a couple of cups of shredded cheddar on top 

so while i do think this is a good base recipe, i would strongly encourage you to jazz it up & add to it to mix in more vegetables & flavor

I added half-and-half and butter to the potatoes before putting them on top .  You have to make your potato slightly runny with the half-and-half and butter mixture so when he goes in the oven it'll come out perfectly baked

The recipe as is gets 4 stars due to the meat being a little flavorless as is. I had to add some diced fresh garlic, a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, couple tablespoons of soy, teaspoon of salt and pepper to get it to have a hearty taste. I added a little extra water for more gravy but I think next time I make this I will up the meat to 2lbs ground beef. I made it in a large casserole dish, and the meat just barely covered the bottom. I need it to be more meat, less potatoes next time.

This was good...I did make a few changes (ground turkey instead of beef, and varied up the veggies a bit). I was weary to add any ketchup like others mentioned- this definitely upped the flavor, especially since I used turkey. Used leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes instead of making them fresh....I actually like the potatoes better in this dish than I did on their own, lol. The husband loved it. I don't like many casserole(ish) dishes- but I would definitely make this again!

Simple, basic recipe, that you can customize easily. I used 1/2 can of beef consomme and 1/4 cup of water plus 1 T. Worshestershire sauce for the gravy base. Also added Lawry's salt. This is perfect comfort food on a cold winter's evening.

Very good recipe but I did make some changes (I know, I know...I hate it when people rate a recipe when they've not made it as written).  Instead of meat, I used veggie crumbles and vegan beef-flavored bouillion.  I used frozen green beans, peas, and carrots / cauliflower / broccoli instead of just carrots.  The rest was as written.  The result was very very good and my British husband loved it

This was a delicious recipe, but I am only giving it 4 stars because of one thing: the carrots. When I try a recipe for the first time I always try to follow it EXACTLY so I can give it a proper and fair review. So when I tried this recipe as written, it was pretty good...but we didn't like how the only veggie was carrots, and my husband hated especially that they were mashed. The flavor of the meat is great (like some other reviewers I added about 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce) so I knew this was a recipe we just needed to doctor slightly to our tastes. I used a frozen veggie mix that contained cut green beans, corn, peas, and diced carrot. Just perfect! That small adjustment made this a 5 star recipe in my books. So unless you're crazy for carrots, I'd suggest making a similar swap. Happy eating!

Very good! Grear for finicky eaters too! I took Sciota's suggeston and added pack of brown gravy.  The potato mix alone was so good I will make for a side dish for another meal.Only problem was potatoes never really goldened and I cooked about 20 minutes longer than recipe  Otherwise fantastic

This was excellent my boys said it was by far the best - I made one change - I used frozen peas and carrots instead of cooked carrots - and I added  some 21 Season Salute from Trader Joes in the grounded hamburger and garlic powder..  Wondera gravy flour instead of flour - yummy!!

Just delicious!  Followed the recipe mostly just did not add cheese...and it was perfectly tasty!!!  Put it under broiler at the end to crisp up potatoes which was great.  Highly recommend.  Serve with some greens and you're good to go! Oh yes...also added some frozen corn and carrots and peas to meatmixture which just adds extra color and veggies!

Used others suggestions - 1.5-2lb meat, brown gravy with 1 cup water instead of broth, Worcester sauce, 2 cu frozen carrot/corn/peas medley on meat.  Sour cream added to potatos. Would use less potato next time for personal preference.

It's good but not great. I added 1/4 c. Worcestershire sauce, used 3/4 lb ground beef and 3/4 lb ground pork, used tomato paste instead of Katsup, increased broth to 1c, and added 3 cloves of garlic to the onions.

I followed some of the suggestions from other reviews.  I think there was too much of the mashed potatoes on top and it took away from everything else. I added peas (just used a small bag of frozen peas and carrots) and I think it really helped! I not only used beef broth, I mixed a packet of brown gravy mix in it. It was one of those comfort foods that will be good for this winter!

Hubby said it tasted very bland.  Also he was wondering where the green beans were.   Kids liked it because it was bland.  I won't  make it again and if I do I will use instant potatoes, and carrots from a can and green beans.  Also add some other spices to it.  It was labor intensive and time consuming.

I chose to dice to carrots rather then mash them. I also added peas and corn. I flavored the ground beef with a few spices that I threw in, and a good amount of salt and pepper. I mixed all the veggies in with the meat for the bottom layer. For the mashed potatoes, I added minced garlic and a little sour cream. Very good.

One of my favorite recipes. Very easy to make and very tasty. I did make some minor substitutions because of family preference. I omitted the onion, peas and carrots and used corn and green beans instead (frozen). Also, to make things quicker, I used instant mashed potatoes. Doubled the cheddar cheese. Instead of adding ketchup, beef broth and flour, I used a packet of brown gravy, 2 tablespoons of worchestire sauce and 2 tablespoons  steak sauce. I also seasoned the meat with onion powder and garlic powder for more flavor.

Very tasty- make SURE when you do this you leave the casserole cover off or too much moisture will remain; especially in the ground beef. Also, the mashed carrots aren't for everyone. I added extra cheese on the top, which boosted the flavour. All in all, very delicious! This will leave a wonderful taste in your mouth and you'll have a favourite on your hands as you adjust the recipe to suit your preferences :)

It was OK, I found it to be bland. Definitely needed a little extra! I ended up using more ketchup then what the recipe said, if I had worchester I would've tried that too. But for sure needs more spices or something

added thyme, a lot more ketchup (as I lacked beef broth) and didn't drain the beef fat so used some extra  flour. used baby carrots and cut them vs mashing them. used instant mash because i was impatient. my husband thought it was amazing. nice and simple recipe for the meat and potatoes lover in your family.

Doesn't get much better than this when you are looking for comfort food! When we are looking to make it a bit lighter we substitute turkey and sweet potatoes and it is still just as good.

I make shepherds pie all the time. Thought I would try this one out instead of my throw together version. I liked the onions and cheese in the potatoes as well as the ketchup and broth instead of gravy. I did miss my Worcestershire and garlic though.

Add a dash of Mace as its a key seasoning in Irish food, this is one I used  1/4. Go lower as test and preferred. It's a strong spice but the missing key. Otherwise this is the best recipe using ground beef. Use lamb or cubed thin cut tenderloin like Milanesa cut or whatever the grocer has cut in 1/8-1/4" thin tender need strips.

I had to improvise with this recipe because I was out of beef broth, so instead I used an equal amount of cream of mushroom. To flavor up the beef, I added 4 cloves of garlic (we love garlic), a dash of cumin, dash of parsley and a dash of Jamaican allspice. Oh and I used steamed veggies and left them in whole slices. All in all, it's amazing! By far one of my favorite recipes. Can't wait to try to original when I have the ingredients and compare ;)

Update, I have tried the original recipe and I still love this recipe, made it 4x now :) I'm going to try some of the recommendations in the other reviews below too.

A little bland! I have a few at home additions I've always done myself. One, as someone else suggested a good splash of worcestershire sauce,  a tablespoon or so of dijon, an extra tablespoon of ketchup and the two secret ingredients. A healthy dash of HP sauce and a small can of creamed corn. Makes reallly delicious and FLAVORFUL meat under your potatoes! Enjoy!

Very easy recipe, great for throwing together last minute to please picky eaters. This is a great base recipe to tailor to your personal taste. I added a few things based on reviews. It turned out great and my husband loved his birthday dinner :)

I did make a gravy with Worcestershire sauce and beef broth.
Also, cooked carrots and peas for about 10 minutes with the meat before adding the gravy mixture.

My husband LOVED this. I did as someone else suggested and added 1/4 c. worcestershire sauce to the meat and gravy instead of the beef broth. The potatoes needed some milk added. 100% will make again.

I'm making this right now actually (potatoes are boiling). Yes I made some personal changes and really isn't that what cooking is all about? 
I went with the Worcester 1/4 cup and the gravy  package and mixed in a half can of corn nibblet's 
A few twists of Jamie Oliver hot chilly peppers, Montreal steak spice a few shakes a dash or two of red wine to the raw meat let that sit for about 30 min.
Spread that meat mix after browning in my baking dish and spread a full can of cream corn on top when the potatoes are done I'll add butter sour cream and a bit of heavy cream with minced garlic mash and spread on top add the cheese and bake 30 min. 
I'll come back and let you know how it turned out.

I used 1/4 cup worsteshire sauce when browning the meat and after the flour part added 1 cup water mixed with 1 brown gravy packet instead of the beef broth.  I also used frozen peas and carrots instead of boiling and smashing layer of carrots.  Really good.

Delicious and easy starter recipe.  I used 3lb of Russet potatoes.  I found that they needed some milk and another 2 tbsp butter to achieve the right texture and flavor.  For the meat, I had 1lb ground beef so used 1 bag of frozen veggies instead of the carrots.  I didn't measure everything carefully so that might have impacted this, but I needed close to 2 cups beef stock, 2 Tbsp ketchup, added 2Tbsp Worcestershire sauce and some garlic powder.   My family loved this comfort meal on our cold winter night.

So good as is.  To the beef mix,  I added a pack of frozen peas, brown gravy instead of flour, ketchup and 1/4 cup Worcester sauce .  Mashed potatoes had no dairy but osem broth one cup.   Parmesan cheese on top.  Parsley would be good.  Easy to triple recipe and freeze.

This is pretty amazing. It took me 2 hours to make the first time, not 50 minutes, even boiling the carrots and potatoes separately at once. Ingredient prep was time consuming. I didn't have beef broth or even boullion so brown gravy it was, and I was surprised how well it went. If you use gravy though, use over a cup of water, otherwise it will be too dry.  Otherwise the flavors are great. Finely shredded cheese jus covering the potatoes on top gave it a gorgeous, perfectly golden finish. So close to perfect.

Loved this! I used ground turkey because it's what I had on hand. Took the advice of other reviewers and replaced the beef broth with 1 cup of water mixed with a package of brown gravy mix. I also didn't mash the carrots and added some frozen peas. It turned out great and I'll definitely make it again. My 8 year old son said, "This is SO good! Thank you!!!"

Really good! I had a few changes though:

1.  I don't drain the grease, I add a little extra flour and use a little beer to make a sort of gravy. It goes great with the mashed potatoes. 

2. I also added some vegetables, like peas-- and I mixed in my barely mashed carrots right before I put it in the oven instead of doing a layer. 

3. Make sure you go low and slow on those onions, they need to be soft and savory. Don't cook the ground beef too hard either. I used 80/20, but I think anymore fat would've been too greasy. 

Quick tip ! I suck at making a nice layer of mashed potatoes on top, so here's what I do:

Put a huge piece of wax paper in the dish you're going to bake in. Throw the mashed potatoes in there and get another piece of wax paper to put on top. Smush it into a nice layer and pick up your mashed potato layer by the edges of the wax paper. Throw your filling in the baking dish, and pull off one of the wax papers. Do a nice, quick flip to get the mashed potatoes in there, and remove your other layer. Two caveats here though-- you lose a bit of mashed potato to the wax paper and this only works well with nice thick mashed potatoes. I like mine to be just mashed enough to get the butter, sour cream, and salt mixed in well, those little bits of unmashed potato in the bites are SOO good. But this is definitely a favorite, and a good dish for parties. Not too expensive either.

Perfect winter evening dish. I made this for the family and every bite was devoured. 

A few changes:  After browning the beef/onions and draining it, I set aside  the drippings in the pan, added butter  & flour and made a rue. From there I used the beef broth to make a small amount of gravy. Then I added the beef/onions back in. Also, I added some frozen peas atop the carrots. Lastly, I would add a potato of two more for more mashed potato topping. And going heavier on the cheese never hurts. I think I ended up using 1/2 cup. 

Thanks for a delicious recipe. It's a keeper!

Delicious!  I also tweaked the recipe.  For health reasons, I used ground turkey, and after saut√©ing the onions, used approximately 1/4 c of Worcestershire sauce in with the turkey when browning the meat. I also used a packet of brown gravy w/1 c of water but thinned it out a bit with some beef broth, and that made a delicious end product.  I don't care for carrots, so just used a can of corn between the meat and potatoes.  A definite keeper.

This is delicious! No exactly keeping with "healthy" new year but none the less very tasty. I added a little extra ketchup to the meat.

A great pie recipe, I made a few modifications (as suggested by others, I also added Worchester Sauce to the beef) and I changed the onions over to the beef as well. I skipped the carrots and opted for peas and corn (my family's favourite) and I used the cheddar only as a final topping on top of the potatoes instead of in the potatoes. Otherwise a great recipe, I would highly recommend using this as a starting place to create your own favourite version!

add 1/4 cup of Worcestershire to the ground beef mixture before cooking. Without this, the meat is too bland. Also, add a packet of brown gravy mix to 1 cup of water (instead of 3/4 c. beef broth) and stir into the browned and floured meat mix to simmer for 5 min. This gives the meat a little bit of gravy, which the mashed potatoes love!

I searched and searched for a recipe that included all the extras I wanted but couldn't find one. They all needed tweaking, but I think this was the best base recipe. The following changes made this recipe perfect for me:

1) Mix 1/4 cup Worchestire sauce in to ground beef before browning
2) Boil potatoes and carrots together until very soft (20 -25 min)for easy mashing.
3) Add 3 tbsp sour cream, 1/2 cup milk, 1 minced garlic, 1 tbsp butter, salt , white pepper and 2 tbsp fine chopped green onions to mashed potatoes. Leave Cheddar cheese out of it.
4) Add 2 or 3 minced garlic cloves and 1 chopped onion to pan when browning ground beef. 
5) Add 1 cup total frozen green peas and corn to ground beef after step 3 is complete.
6) 1 packet of gravy mix with one cup water instead of beef broth
7) Add enough shredded cheddar to cover top of pie. Bake covered at 375 for 15 min, 5 min uncovered and then broil for 3-4 min.
8) 2 tbsp of ketchup instead of 1.

I added 1/4c worcheshire to 1.5c broth for extra gravy.  I also eliminated the carrots and used 1.5c mixed frozen veggies instead.  Added 1tsp mustard powder & garlic.  Very good!

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my guys.  They hate corn, so the carrots were a happy change.  I didn't mash them, and instead diced them.  I also substituted the 1/4 cup finely chopped onions with scallions in the mashed potatoes.  With the onions that are cooked and added to the meat, I also added a can of mushrooms, drained and diced.  I also increased the ketchup from 1 T to 2 T.   This is their new favorite dish.  I'd give it six stars if I could.

Tasted great!  Changes I made were - Added about a cup and a half of beef broth, 2 cloves of garlic sauteed with the hamburger and onion, and about a cup of peas were added when assembling. I blended in one egg into the leftover mash potaotes I had saved from Thanksgiving. I skipped mashing the carrots but steamed them until soft before adding. Next time I'll add a dash of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  Also, cooked in a convection oven at 350 for 20 minutes and it turned out golden brown.

This was a big hit with the whole family.  I took advice from some of the other reviews and added gravy mix and water instead of beef broth.  I added Worchestershire (about 1/4 cup) and layered mixed vegetables on top of the meat.  Absolutely delicious!!

This was great!  I don't mash the carrots, add corn and peas (or other veggies), and extra gravy to the meat.  Might be nice to have some extra gravy for the side, my husband loves that!  It's nutritious and so yummy!!!

I added much more Ketchup to the ground beef (to taste) and frozen peas and carrots to the ground beef.   I didn't have beef broth so I just added water and a lot of Penzy's Roast beef seasoning.   I turned out wonderful...the family raved.  Much more flavorful and colorful than shepherd's pie I've made in the past.  Putting it in the weekly rotation and were calling it Cowboy Pie as true shepherd's pie is made from lamb.

This is a great basic recipe. I always read the reviews and wing a few things.  I loved the idea of adding fine chopped onions to the potatoes. I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and a bit more cheese than the recipe called for, in the potatoes and on top. I put celery, mushrooms, corn, and green beans, along with the carrots, (which I didn't mash). I added Worcestershire Sauce to the ground beef, along with garlic powder. I did not have beef broth so I used Cream of Mushroom soup and added beef bouillon and  onion powder to make it taste more like gravy. My family raved over this simple meal! I love gathering ideas and then adding my own twist!

Per the advice of other reviewers, I used a packet of brown gravy and 1 cup of water in lieu of the beef broth, a 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce,  2 Tbs ketchup, and a thawed 12-oz. bag of peas and carrots.  In the interest of time, I made up some instant mashed potatoes, and stirred in a dollop of sour cream and 1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano.  Baked for 30 minutes at 375F.   Result: The wife said it was the best shepherd's pie she ever had!  Nuff said.

I changed the recipe a bit but my husband really liked it. I cooked and seasoned each layer separately. I saut√©ed in butter 1 small onion chopped and 4 garlic cloves diced, added ground beef, salt, pepper, paprika, and Worcestershire. When the ground beef was done, I removed everything from the pan and made a roux with the drippings and the flour. I cooked the roux long enough to make sure the flour would be 'cooked' added chicken broth (I don't like canned beef broth and I always have organic chicken broth on hand).  I turned down the heat and cooked the gravy - stirring constantly - until it thickened, seasoned the gravy with salt and pepper and just a dash of paprika and poured it over the meat mixture. I drained a can of sweet corn, added it as the next layer and then I added chopped red bell pepper on top of that. I added my left over mashed potatoes,  grated cheese on top and baked as instructed. I like seasoning the layers separately to make sure that nothing is too bland or missing something for my husband. I like this recipe because it can be adjusted so easily to match the taste of anyone you are feeding.

This turned out really well! I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I can think to change would be the amount of butter used in the potatoes; against my better judgement, I used the recommended amount, but I think more butter would really increase the flavor of this dish.

Definitely a little heavy on the mashed potatoes, but this is an all-around good recipe.  I would add peas, carrots, or other vegetables into the bottom.  Was too sweet for me, so I added about a tablespoon of Tobasco sauce to help separate out the flavors.  Fantastic.

This turned out wonderful!  Good flavor.  I added a bit of garlic powder and used tomato paste instead of ketchup.  This was my first attempt at making Shepherd's pie but I would say this recipe is a keeper.

As someone else suggested, I browned the meat and onions in worcestershire sauce. I also used a packet of brown gravy mix with 1 cup water instead of beef broth. I used a 10 oz. package of frozen steamer peas and a layer of frozen carrots on top of that. It was still bland. I think next time I will add the worcestershire sauce after draining the meat. Also add salt and pepper to the meat mixture as well as the potatoes. Instead of carrots, I might add mushrooms to the meat mixture. Also, I am considering skipping the flour, so that there is more gravy to add on top of the potatoes, once it comes out of the oven.

Super good. I'm militant about not changing recipes but the meat needed a little change. I had HP sauce (sorta like a european A1 sauce) in the house so I figured that would prolly be better than ketchup. It was a good choice. And I added Worcestershire and salt and peps to the meat. That's about it tho. Really happy with the way it turned out. My Gf "hates" mashed potatoes but apparently not anymore. She loves them now.

i followed some others advice on the reviews and added Worcestershire sauce along with 2 Tb flour and the envelope of beef gravy along with about 1 1/2 cups of the potato water instead of the beef broth.  I didn't add any cheese to the potatoes but I'm sure that would make it prettier.  Just didn't have it.   Also added chopped carrots and peas to the sauce and cooked it for about 15 minutes.   I would increase the potatoes to 5 instead of 4, I just like a lot of mashed potatoes.  Smells wonderful.

Ground beef layer - cooked ground beef in a bit of oil and added 1 package onion soup mix, 1/4 cup water, 1 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp ketchup.
Covered with sliced cooked carrots and corn.
Topped with cheesy garlic mashed potatoes (potatoes, garlic, salt, pepper, grated cheddar, butter, and milk)
Very Tasty!!

I made this not to long ago. We like veggies in ours so we make it with pea's and carrot's. My kiddos are not fans of eating lamb so the ground meat was an awesome substitute! No changes where made.

Used two pounds ground beef instead of one and used leftover baked potatoes to make the mash. I took advice from top review, and it was amazing! Yum freaking yum.

This was really good. I used garlic,onion and thyme with seasoning salt, while cooking the ground beef. I also went with beef gravy, although I think broth would have been fine. I used frozen mixed vegetables for color-they made for nice flavor too. This will be a regular for us.

Delicious!  My changes were only for convenience.  I had a little extra onion so I threw it in,  skipped the cheese all together (dietary restriction) and had extra beef because I didn't feel like having to store the extra.  It was delicious!  Followed all directions and will definitely be making this again without changing a thing (except maybe doubling everything since it was eaten so quickly).  Nicely done!

I cooked tonight for the first time for a 87 year old I love and respect so much. I was so nervous.  He loved it! He had seconds and I think he would have licked his plate if no one was watching. Lol! I did add 1 cup sour cream to potatoes and Worcestershire to the meat not sure how much just poured some in. I also didnt use broth but brown gravy mix and 1 cup of water for the mix. I cheated and used two cans of carrot pea mix instead of the carrots.  Delish!

This was so good!!! I used venison because that's what I had laying around, and added 3-4 cloves of garlic to the onions, and extra cheese on top. I also took some advice from another reviewer, which made this absolutely perfect: add 1/4 cup of Worcestershire to the meat, use a packet of gravy mix with 1 cup water instead of the beef broth, and add peas to the carrots (I left the carrots in small chunks instead of mashing). mmmmmmmmmmmm!

The potatoes were too dry...they needed some milk.  This also needed some more seasoning.  The potato to beef ratio was also off.  There was A LOT of potatoes, with not enough beef.  

This was just OK.  I will likely not make it again.

Really good yummy, save time cook the onions with the ground beef (I added a small can of mushrooms) one teaspoon beef bouillon with the flour to the beef also 11/2 teap. Wish. Sauce. I also stirred in a cup of green beans to meat. Layer of carrots and mashed potatoes as usual topped with extra sharp cheddar. It was absolutely delightful. Just as good as I have ever eaten. On my favorite list perminate now. Thanks a lot easy quick and oh so good.

This was great! Everyone loved it and that's not an easy feat in our house! I especially enjoyed the addition of the mashed carrots as I don't care for the usual mixed veggies in my Shepherd's Pie. The only changes I made was to omit the onions (we don't like them) and I didn't have beef bouillon so I used a can of beef gravy instead and omitted the flour as well. Hearty and delicious. This will become a stable in our house. Thanks!

I am a hunter and used ground deer "burger" instead of ground beef. I changed only a few little things; I added some herbs and more salt and pepper and a little bit of hot sauce (Our family loves spicy food) Overall, it is one of the best shepherds pie's i have ever made! 
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Brilliant recipe! I modified the recipe due to ingredient availability and taste preference. I browned about one and a half cup of coarsely chopped onion, then added a 1/2 lb mixture of half lean ground turkey (99% FF) and half lean ground beef (94% FF) (along with the called for ketchup, salt, pepper) - to which I had added worcestershire sauce (est 1/4 cup), a bit of red cooking wine (est 2 tbsp), 3 pressed garlic cloves, bit of red pepper flakes (est 1/8 tsp), herbs de provence, and garlic powder. After the meat had cooked, I then added about half a packet of brown gravy/water (per packet instructions). I simmered the gravy/meat mix until the sauce began to thicken, at which time I added steamed peas. Then I layered into a glass dish and topped with mashed potatoes (I was short on time, so I used quickly-made garlic mashed potatoes with a bit of thinly sliced onions). I topped with fat-free mozzarella cheese and baked for about 15 minutes. 

In my rendition of this recipe, I omitted the flour (the gravy did the thickening), carrots (didn't have any), homemade mashed potatoes (quick-fix), broth (substituted gravy), and cheddar cheese (used mozzarella). I added red cooking wine, worcestershire sauce, fresh pressed garlic, and lots of assorted spices. 

Next time, I may use a smidge less worcestershire sauce & Herbs de Provence and bit more wine. I found the recipe to be very forgiving, as I didn't measure most of my ingredients as I tossed them in. Turned out  fabulously!

This was delicious! I added some fresh minced garlic and mushrooms to the onions. I also added just a small bit of BBQ sauce to the meat while it was cooking. Instead of just carrots, I used frozen mixed veggies. I absolutely love this though. We had company and everyone went back for more including my boyfriend who doesn't like mushrooms and onions! This was a success!

So, so easy and DELICIOUS!!!  My family actually requests this meal regularly. I substitute frozen mixed veggies for the mashed carrots; although I'm sure mashed carrots are equally amazing.

We went with using frozen peas and carrots, per some reviews, and cooked them in a steamer basket over the potatos; next time I would just add them to the beef mixture to cook. Used minced green onions in mashed potatos. Added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, a few dashes of rosemary, marojam, thyme and worcestershire sauce in the beef. Cooked the beef in a cast iron dutch oven, then did our layers in that and popped it in the oven.  I think we'll be doing this recipe again!

This recipe turned out awesome! I am a vegetarian, so obviously I made some changes. Instead of the ground beef, I used the original Yves veggie ground round. I heated up half a tablespoon or so of olive oil in a pan and put the veggie ground round in, and broke it up and heated it for a few minutes. I then spread that out over the bottom of a 2 & 1/2 liter casserole dish. Next, I layered one batch of homemade mushroom gravy. I got the recipe from the ohsheglows vegan food blog, if you google ohsheglows mushroom gravy you'll find the recipe. Then the mashed carrots, then I added frozen corn. I didn't measure how much, just enough to cover the carrots. Then the mashed potatoes, then the cheese! I ended up doubling the amount of cheese I put on top, about half a cup total. Maybe a bit more. My boyfriend and I love cheese so next time we will double the amount in the mashed potatoes as well. In the oven it went for about 17 minutes, then I switched it to the broiler on low for a few more minutes to melt the cheese more. Honestly I could not tell it wasn't real meat! My boyfriend is not a vegetarian and he says he likes it better than regular meat, it's less greasy. Great recipe. Obviously I omitted the meat, ketchup, and other ingredients added to the meat to make the gravy.

best shepherd's pie recipe I've found. I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and added the much needed Worcestershire sauce to the meat. Although I didn't have beef broth, I had veggie broth and added a splash of braggs amino acids (like soy sauce) to liven it up. Yummm! Saved.

I made this for my partner's birthday since it's his favorite. He really liked it, but it tasted pretty simple to me. I did accidentally forget to add the ketchup (which I was going to use tomato paste anyway), but the only other changes I made were that I didn't put mashed carrot on, and I put sweet potato on one half of the pie and regular potato on the other. I think next time I might take some of other reviewers suggestions, like adding Worcestershire sauce to the meat, and maybe some mustard. As it is, it's still very good, and if you're a sweet potato fan, I highly recommend putting a mashed sweet potato topping on.

Took a long time to make, and used a lot of pot and pans, as someone without a dishwasher I don't appreciate it. There was no flavor due to lack of seasoning don't make this unless you want to add a lot of seasonings not mentioned in the recipe.

Didn't like the mashed carrot idea. I under cooked mine in the pot by a hair then put them in the casserole for the oven. That made them perfect. Also, i added corn.

This was delicious, easy, and flexible.  I used ground turkey, chicken broth, frozen mixed veggies, pepper jack cheese, and red potatoes because it's what I had on hand.  I did use about a quarter of a teaspoon of salt in the ground turkey mix and some Worcestershire sauce for flavor.  I made the mashed potatoes my usual way, with a whole lot of butter, some milk and some garlic, salt and pepper to taste.  While my son rated it 4 stars, I give it 5 stars for flexibility and being an easy weeknight dinner, especially if you make the potatoes and/or ground meat mix ahead of time.  I'll be making this again.  :)  Thanks, Jacquie.

This recipe was a success. My boyfriend ate it all up and loved it from the first bite. I only cook for him and I'm always careful in the recipes I pick because anything too "complicated" to the taste buds confuses him. I added some worcestershire sauce and frozen vegetables and a bit more flour + broth because I'm pretty sure I used 3 1/2 pounds of lean ground beef. I used some leftover mashed taters and some new ones and it tasted great. First time I've ever had "shepherd's" pie, I'm actually going to try making actual shepherd's pie with lamb some time. This recipe was really simple and very tasty.

I make this using ground turkey and with the recommended changes of adding the 1/4 cup of worstershire to the ground turkey and adding a packet of brown gravy mix to 1 cup of water, this recipe was amazing!  My husband said that it was the best Shepherd Pie he ever had!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I added extra onion, garlic powder, and parsley to the meat as it cooked. I used 1 Cup water with 3 beef bouillon cubes to give the beef broth more flavor. I also added about 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. I added sour cream, milk, and a packet of dry ranch mix dressing to the mashed potatoes. Turned out amazing!

I added a star for the idea, but, when I followed the recipe exactly, it was OK but too bland. I've made modifications to adjust is to my taste and found that it was MUCH better (for me) that way: 1)mashed potato doesn't need cheese + added oregano and roasted garlic instead of onion 2) replaced carrots with veggies that I like more (pees and broccoli) 3) added barbecue sauce to beef.

I used 2 lbs of potatoes.  I upped the butter to 1/4 c and the cheese to 1 cup.  I also added celery.

Delicious!  I added a packet of brown gravy and 1 cup of water to the meat and flower mixture. Simmered 5 minutes. Went well with the potatoes!  Next time I may pour some of the gravy over the potatoes.  I used frozen peas and carrots that I first steamed in the microwave.  Perfect meal for a COLD week ahead!

Yum yum. I used ground turkey instead of beef but kept everything else almost the same. Looking at the recipe, I thought it would be a bit plain so I added extra peas and corn and also mixed up a special sauce of my own for the beef which included tomato sauce, ketchup, mustard, flour, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic powder, sugar, and also a bit of a curry roux. It was absolutely amazing!! The mashed potato was very delicious too however, I must have used HUGE potatoes or something because the ratio of meat to potato was a bit off; there wasn't a lot of meat to complement the large amount of mashed potato on top. Next time, I will buy more meat.

Fantastic recipe.  Who cares that it's not traditional Shepherds pie.  I like it.  I did however make a few changes and additions.  I followed the recipe but added two large cloves of garlic when I sauteed the onions. I used vegetable stock instead of beef.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of water and sprinkled extra flour to thicken the gravy.  a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce is a must.  I did mash the carrots but they ended up being chunky ( tasted great ) and added some frozen peas to the veg layer.  It was a family hit.  I saved it

Made this tonight as I wanted to get rid of some leftover mashed potatoes, and was pleased with the result. Of course, I've never had shepherd's pie before, so I have no reference point lol. Per Erin0220, I used 2 T each of flour & ketchup, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, packet of turkey gravy (did not have brown gravy) & 1 cup water. Will def make again. Thanks to OP and other reviewers for contributing:)

This is one of my fav recipies. Its easy and it feeds my boyfriend and i for the whole week with a side salad, which is great because we are both students and dont have a lot of time. I do change it a bit by adding gravy or garlic or bacon to the mashed potato part.

I also used Worcestershire sauce in the beef but added it after it was cooked. I used  beef gravy from a jar because I was lazy but really liked it. I might try adding some milk to the mashed potatoes next time...just a bit.  This is a good meal....make enough for the next day.  :)

This was my first time making it and I enjoyed it. I did tweak the recipe just a little...I added some ground hot Italian sausage, used frozen mixed vegetables instead of just carrots. I also seasoned my ground beef a little,  and prepared my mashed potatoes with sour cream and sweetened condensed milk. Also all I had was deli sliced cheese so I added that in with the meat sauce mixture so that it would melt. It turned out fantastic!

Somewhat bland, too many potatoes for the amount of meat mixture.  Definitely a good jumping off point, though.  I added peas to mine and it definitely needed some SALT.

I made this for my family thinking they would really like it - cheese, mashed potatoes and beef. How can you go wrong? Apparently you can. My husband didn't even get past the second bite. It was too bland. If I were to make this again, I'd take the others suggestions and add worchershire sauce and maybe even the gravy. Adding mixed veggies instead of just carrots may be a good idea too.

A very good recipe to start with. I used corn instead of carrots and instant mashed potatoes (makes it a much faster meal to prepare). I also added a tbsp of Worcester sauce as the ketchup & beef broth gave it very little flavor. I mixed the born in with the beef before spreading into casserole dish, adding a layer of cheese, then mashed potato and then one more layer of cheese. We use to use the clubhouse shepherds pie sauce, but hubby likes this one much better.

Very little taste and a LOT of work to make- the carrots alone will drive you crazy trying to get them soft enough to actually mash!  Perhaps it could have been better with some seasonings in the beef and if the recipe had been larger and fed more people but there are a lot of recipes for Shepherd's Pie that are easier and far more flavorful.

My family loved this recipe. I did add peas and sliced carrots. I also used Ore Ida frozen mashed potatoes to cut down cooking time. You throw them in the microwave and 10 minutes later you have potatoes to mash. Time saver. Also, I added a bit of mustard, worcestershire sauce, and a bit of garlic powder to enhance the taste of the meat. It turnd out really yummy. Very simple and fast.

My husband and company devoured this dish.  Two helpings each.  I did change it a little, though.  I accidentally overcooked the potatoes while caring for my toddler so I added sour cream, half and half, and white velveeta to the mixture to stiffen it up, yet keep it creamy.  I topped the potatoes with a little Italian seasoning and some garlic powder.  I completely omitted the carrots.   I added a can of canned mushrooms and 3/4 lb bag of frozen corn to the meat mixture.  I also used another reviewer's advice and used 1/4c worcestire and crushed garlic while cooking the meat mixture. Also, I baked it a little longer than 20 minutes.  I waited for the top to golden brown nicely.  It was a fantastic hit!

Delicious!  I did not mash carrots but cooked some diced carrots and beans and sprinkled over the cooked ground beef along with some leftover corn.  I added some worcestshire sauce to the gr beef (maybe a T or two?) and added another T of ketchup.  Also, added about a cup of gravy to the meat instead of the broth stated in the recipe.  Changed yes, but loved it!

Excellent base recipe, but there's no way this dish, from start to finish, is ready in 50 minutes. "Prep time 30 minutes" only possible if many steps are completed in advance. The results are well worth the 2 hours, from start to finish, prep time - multiple pots, pans and utensils needed. Used advice of other reviewers (sour cream, parsley & garlic added to 50/50 potato/parsnip combo; garlic, fresh thyme, tomato paste. worcestershire & white wine added to meat minus catsup; added peas & corn to mashed carrots; sprinkled paprika on top of cheese before baking). Made St Pat's Day a celebration - very yummy. A real comfort food and options are endless.

Simple and tasted great. I did add peas in addition to the carrots. The beef broth definitely helped to add to the flavor and it might not hurt to even add a few spices to boost it even more.

Amazing. We replaced the beef with ground lamb, replaced the carrots with corn and peas, and added some garlic powder and worchestire sauce to the meat, and used pepper jack and cheddar cheese. Otherwise followed all the directions exactly. Very delicious.

I get asked to make this recipe at least once a week by my boyfriend/friends I think but have to reserve it to more like bi-weekly to keep it a special treat! I use packaged brown gravy on the beef instead of the flour/ketchup/beef broth mixure (because I'm lazy) and just use whatever canned veggies I have at home, usually one can of corn and one of green beans. It makes it more like semi-homemade but I do always make my own mashed potatoes.

This is a favourite in my home!
I don't know how many times I've made this dish :) .  As ee like spicy food in this household, the only change I've made is adding a pinch or two of red pepper flakes in the ground beef.

Awesome recipe!  I used less carrots and boiled them in the extra beef broth to "take the edge off" (my family doesn't like carrots).  I also added some garlic to the potatoes.  It came out very good!!  Thanks for sharing:)

My family loved this recipe. I did add the 1/4 cup of Worstershire Sauce as some other reviewers suggested. I then split all the ingredients and layered it into 6 individual ramikens to cook them. It worked out terrific and all three of my kids loved having thier own little dinner!

Loved it.  I did make some changes but only based on ingredients on hand.  Used ground turkey instead of beef, roasted sweet potatoes (leftovers) and veggie broth.  I'm sure I will make again as written. Overall, it was tasty and very easy to make.

It was a big hit! I made a few changes to suit my family's taste: I didn't use the flour, beef broth, onion, and ketchup.  I added garlic salt, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard, and 16 oz. tomato sauce to the meat.

Our modifications, first run:

1 - Swapped 1/2 of carrots out, mixed with frozen peas instead.
2 - Added 2 cloves of garlic (some to beef, some to potatoes)
3 - Add 2 tbsp "Bulldog" sauce (like thick Worcestershire)

This was really delicious, but the beef needed a touch more salty/savory flavor for our taste.

Thanks!

I think this recipe is pretty good. One thing that I think is misrepresented is the preparation time. It took me 1.5 hours to make this, and I was working as hard and fast as I could. For instance, it took almost 30 minutes (rather than the stated 15 minutes) for the large potatoes to be boiled to tender.

Overall, It's delicious and easy to throw together. I only made a couple of changes adding a 1/4 tsp of all spice to the ground beef and used tomato paste instead of ketchup. Yum! Yum! Family enjoyed it

Great recipe! I used leftover mashed potatoes, so the prep time was cut down. Served with biscuits. The whole family loved it and went back for seconds!

Love it - just emailed recipe to grown son who also loves it!! Only substitution is that I will prepare frozen peas/carrots in place of the  mashed carrots. Not better, just quicker.

Great recipe.  I used frozen carrots & peas instead of the 5 carrots and added a little Worchester sauce to the beef. I also cooked and mashed a yam and added it to the mashed potato. Mashed rutabaga, sweet potato or parsnips also make great additions to the topping (and give you an easy way to use up leftovers).

I was looking for a recipe to use up left over mashed potatoes and this one fit the bill perfectly as I had all of the ingredients in the fridge! I made some changes based on previous comments including browning ground beef with onion and garlic and chopped celery and then simmering with a mixture of 1/4 cup worstershire, 3/4 cup beef broth and 2 T flour. I layered the beef mixture a bag of frozen veggies (carrots, peas, green beans, carrots and lima beans) and the cold mashed potates. It cooked a little bit longer than 20 minutes (maybe because the veggies were frozen and the potatoes cold) but it was worth the wait! Both my husband and 13 year old son loved it and had seconds, not much left over for my lunch!! Yum a great recipe.

Me and the wife loved it. We made a few changes, personal tastes.
We used canned veggies (can of peas and carrots and a can of corn), a package of gravy mix, and more cheese. The potatoes we added some cream cheese to them to liven them up. But i feel that even without those changes it still is a great dish. Been told i have to make it again.

Good base to start with. But needed a lot of fiddling to get right. Most of the things I changed have already been stated. Would add more ketchup, and least one more vegetable. The potatoes were too lumpy and bland. Would actually make mashed potatoes(instant or regular) the way you normally would then spread that on top. Also could use garlic and some more seasoning.

great recipe. i read some of the other reviews and have to agree that tweaking is necessary for individual tastes. i like flavor in my meals and so made the mashed potatoes the way  i like them and used fresh chunks of carrots and peas mixed into the browned beef vs mashed carrots and no veggies. i added extra cheese - hey! i like cheese! i used lean ground beef and no added salt ( enough in the cheese) and added some rosemary and some other fresh thyme and oregano... definitely will make during the fall/winter as a hearty easy comfort dinner meal.

That you for posting this recipe.  Made as instructed and it was delishious. First time ever making or even eatting Shepherd's Pie and I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was.  This dish was enjoyed by the entire family and I will be adding it to my favorite recipes and into my monthly dinner rotation.

Absolutely Amazing!! This was my first shepherds pie attempt and I was ecstatic with how well it turned out. My husband is a very picky eater and he loved it as much as I did. The only adjustment I made was instead of using mashed carrots, I threw in frozen veggies while cooking the meat. The hamburger was very flavorful and I liked having corn and peas popping in my mouth with every bite. Delicious!

I have tried a few variations to make it even better. Adding extra veggies to the carrot layer makes it extra tasty - I've used squash and zucchini. I've also used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup in the meat layer to give it a different twist. I've also used Cheese Whiz mashed potatoes on top instead of regular ones.

i made this for a very picky child, and she ate every last bite. i made a casserole dish that normally feeds the three of us with enough for left overs, not this time, my husband and daughter(4yrs) ate  and barely left me enough to make a meal, i was still hungry,i guess thats what happens when the cook eats last. very good simple dinner.

Very good! I added garlic and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  Instead of adding peas, I added corn because my boyfriend hates peas. The boyfriend loved it and had two plates, I thought it was okay, but lacked flavor. Next time I will add more spices to give it some extra kick. Overall, good and filling! Biscuits go well with it!

My kids and my husband liked it. Enough said!

I'll add that I don't  mash the carrots. Just slice and steam them. Somehow that seems easier. I also use some Worcestershire sauce. White cheddar cheese gives it a great flavor boost too.

This was a very good recipe, my only complaint is that it was a little bland. Next time I will probably add some brown gravy to give it more of a beefy taste.  Otherwise, it was delicious. I also added 1/2 cup of carrots to mine as well.

This was way better than I had anticipated! Not very hard to make either. My hubby LOVED it so much he took leftovers with him to work. (rarely does that). I will definitely make this again. Yum!

This was amazing! Probably one of my favorite meals of all time now. I followed as directed, but added some corn to the meat after it was cooked. I think that really helped! YUM!

After reading several reviews, I deviated from the recipe...I used about 1 1/2 pkgs. brown gravy mix with 1 1/2 cups water, a small can of peas and carrots, and 2 packages buttery flavored instant mashed potatoes (one package barely covered the meat layer).  My husband loved it, and said he would eat this any time.  I loved it to.  Thanks for the recipe.  Also thanks to other reviewers with their time-saving tips.

This was just okay for me. My family loved it though. I liked the mashed potatoes because I love them but I thought the meat mixture needed a little more flavor or maybe I'm just not a huge fan of ground beef. Overall, we will probably make again.

This was fantastic!  Made recipe as written with the exception of not mashing the carrots.  I did steam some diced carrots with some green beans until crisp tender and used that.  We loved it!  This will be my go to Shepherd's Pie recipe from now on.  Thank you Jacquie.

Awesome recipe. I received rave reviews for this one.  

I added 2 tsps worchestire sauce and brown gravy mix (about 1 cup prepared) as other reviewers recommended along with the original ingredients.

This recipe was excellent!! I seasoned the beef with beef flavored powdered bullion (G. Washington brand) and some pepper. I did not mash the carrots; instead I used diced canned carrots and a small can of peas and scattered them on top of the beef. When I whipped the potatoes for the topping, I added beef broth. My family loved this recipe. I will definitely make it again and again and again!!

This is a great base recipe for Shepard's pie.  I gave it 4 stars because we made some changes to suit our tastes.  Added 3 cloves of garlic to the meat and potatoes. I didn't mash the carrots, just plopped them in between the meat and potatoes. Put a splash of milk in the potatoes.  And to give the meat some punch I added some curry powder and tarragon and it was absolutely delicious.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was very good!!! I added salt, pepper, and garlic salt to the meat.  I also put onion and crushed garlic into the meat.  I didnt have any broth so I just added water.  Will definitely make this again. OH, I also added a layer of canned peas on top of the meat before the carrots.

Very good recipe. I agree that mashed carrot is the way to go. I have also tried a variation where I use mashed cauliflower in place of the potatoes. Not as good as with potatoes, but very healthy and definitely still at least 7 out of 10 stars.

We made this with venison and blue potatoes and it came out ok. Seems to be missing a bit more flavor but maybe because the venison was so lean.

After I ate the pie I started talking with a Scottish accent - bonnie good.   I followed another's suggestion and used 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce and brown gravy mix.   Plus I souped it up with some low fat Jimmy Dean pork sausage.   Guid Luck!

I made this using ingredients I had on hand: frozen peas and carrots and chicken broth. Just mixed up the frozen veggies with the meat while it was cooking. Came out much better than I imagined. This was so good. Just like in a restaurant.

I made this recipe to use up my Thanksgiving leftover mashed potatoes. I did not mash the carrots. I added frozen peas and carrots, chopped celery, and garlic when cooking the ground beef. I also added a tablespoon of Worcester to the broth. I will surely make this again. It was so easy to make and an excellent comfort food.

honestly, i found this to be rather boring.  it wasn't bad; it's just that there's no wow to it at all.  and maybe i'm expecting too much from shepherd's pie, i dunno... i've never made it or even eaten it before.  i just expected more FLAVOUR.  straight off, the meat to potato ratio was way too low.  i'd say 2 - 3 potatoes to a pound and a half of beef would be better.  i even added garlic to the potatoes and meat and still it didn't taste like much.  sorry to be a downer.... i really wanted to like it.

I was thankful I read all the prior reviews -- their suggestions definitely made this EXCELLENT!!  I followed their advice and added Worcestershire sauce & a couple tablespoons of brown gravy mix.  I also threw some frozen peas & corn in while I simmered the beef, onions & broth.  I doubled the recipe & froze an extra one.  It was absolutely delicious!!

I am sure the original recipe is good, but I changed it up a little.  I had some leftover pot roast,so I chopped it finely and used it in place of the burger.  I used canned diced carrots instead of mashing them.  I also used a bottom pie crust.  Everyone LOVED it.  My daughter ate it for breakfast the next morning.

I tired this recipe last night, and it was good.  I used ground pork instead of beef, and it still turned out well.  Note, it doesn't say to spice your potatoes or carrots after you've mashed, so remember to add just a little more to avoid the blah taste.  the sprinkle of cheese on top makes this shepherd's pie taste great.

Great recipe! Although I did season the ground beef, and I added a bit of bacon in the potato and a little over top. Will be making again!

I didn't know what I was making for dinner last night. I typed in what ingreditents I had & some I didn't and this is one of the recipe Allrecipes matched to my ingredients on hand. So, Shepherd's Pie is was! I was not dissapointed. Very simple supper, entire meal in one dish, good flavor. 

Only modifications I made were to add a can of sweet peas on top of the layer of carrots and season each layer. That's it.

I'll keep this on hand for a quick, simple, basic supper.

Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is my new go-to; it's amazing. What I usually do a little bit differently is I add the carrots in chunks in the mince itself (tonight I am going to add peas also), a clove or two of garlic and some worcestershire sauce.

Great start for a good meal.  To add a little more flavor, I also added 2 tsp of allspice, and 2 tsp of oregano to the dish as well as 2 tsp of Chipotle Tabasco sauce to add a little smokey kick to the meal.  The only other thing that may have been added as an afterthought would be a few veggies (peas,corn,ect).

This was my first time making (& eating!) Shepherd's Pie. I took the suggestions of others and it was FANTASTIC!! My Bostonian husband said it was the best he's ever had (& he is unable to lie about food...trust me). Even my picky 21-year-old, and his 2-year-old sister gobbled it up! This is definitely going into our favorites box. Thanks to Jacquie and all the reviewers who summed up the suggestions!

Absolutely Deeeelicious!  Thanks a ton for the recipe.  I followed some of the other reccomendations and added gravy instead of the stock.  I also make my mashed potatoes with cream cheese as they turn out super scrumptious!  Great recipe thanks!

I love this recipe!!! I've used it at least 5 times, but when I did it I made a few changes. I bought mixed veggies and already chopped onions it saved quite a bit of time. Plus I mixed in garlic powder and onion powder to the potatos before adding them to the top. It gives it a nice kick.

A good comfort food. As per other reviews I use canned or frozen mixed veggies and add about a 1/4 cup of Worchestire sauce to the browning ground beef.

I think what made this a lack luster meal was the hamburger. I think if you used real stew meat or something and a better gravy it would make the meal something you would want to have over and over again. But, it is what is it - hamburger, veggies, and mashed potatoes.

This recipe was excellent! Only thing I would add next time would be a bit of garlic, and the beef broth gravy to make the inside mix more runny. Still delicious as is.

Love this recipe. I add a can of peas on top of the meat. Can be made ahead & refrigerated overnight. I just bake 35 min if made  ahead & was refrigerated. Easy, economical & family loves it.

Great recipe!!  Instead of the carrots I just used some canned mixed veggies and added more beef broth than called for because I wanted a thinner meat mixture.  MMM....

This was an average dish--not awesome, but not bad either.  The proportions resulted in too much potatoes on top for too little filling.  Additionally, the dish was rather bland.  I would use this recipe again but with a few alterations: (1) use half the called for potatoes, (2) season the meat with Worcester sauce instead of generic ketchup, and (c) continue to not mash the carrots and add peas as well.

I did really enjoy the taste of the potatoes.  I used half a tbsp of onion powder, half a tbsp of garlic powder, and the cheese and butter as called for.  It was VERY tasty.  I just might use this part of the recipe for all of my mashed potatoes going forward!

We really enjoyed this shepherd's pie recipe. Normally I just throw things together when I make shepherd's pie but this time I was looking to season the beef a little differently and this was great. I added some Worcestershire sauce and bbq sauce to the meat as well. Delicious! The mashed carrot layer was our favorite!

This shepherd's pie is SO good!  I have been searching for a good recipe for years now to satisfy my picky husband, and this is now his birthday request dinner :)  I love the carrots under the mashed potatoes, gives it a great flavor.  I don't boil them though, you lose too many nutrients that way so I just dice them and steam- it takes the same amount of time.  The only ingredient change I make is the beef- I make the recipe on this site for 'Slow cooker Italian Beef' pretty frequently, which makes a lot of leftovers, so I use that!  I still make this recipe as is, but I just add my already cooked beef to the onions.  It makes for a very flavorful dish and is a great way to use up my leftover Italian beef.  Love it!

I made this recipe with ground turkey instead of beef.  Great flavor, but the turkey would have been better using a little less liquid.

This is a great starting recipe but I found that it didn't have enough meat or potatoes for my family's liking. Next time I am plan to use two more potatoes, a half pound more of meat, and add mushrooms and peas.

This came out GREAT.  Even my picking children ate it.  I only made a couple of changes.  I used corn and green beans instead of carrots.  I also added fresh garlic to the meat and garlic and onion powder to the potatoes.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I use creamed corn instead of the carrots and it turns out fabulous every time. A family favorite for sure, thank you!

This recipe got the job done.  My husband said it lacked gravy & I thought it lacked spices.  He also felt it was missing peas & corn.  It was definitely a good starter recipe & a lot of fun to make.

Loved it.  I followed someone's advice and used brown gravy mix instead of beef broth.  I also bought a bag of frozen peas and carrots to make it a lot easier.  I just microwaved the frozen vegetables and drained the excess water before laying it in the pie.

I altered this a bit the first time I made this for a very untraditional shepherd's pie just for time and convenience' sake, but I really do want to try it as written sometime too.  I browned the meat and onion with the worcestershire (as recommended), then drained it and added it to some carrots and peas I had boiled until tender.  To that I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar, dumped it in a 9 x 13 (lightly sprayed with Pam) and topped with 2 cans of refridgerated biscuits (which I lightly coated with butter to help with browning).  My husband has already commented on the wonderful smell coming from the kitchen!  Baked at 375 for about 15-20 minutes (just until the biscuits were done) - and it really was yummy!

This was so good, my kids love Shepherd's Pie.  I did not use carrots but pea and corn.  I also added a can of gravy on top of my meat.  It was so tasty.

Super easy to make and it came out DELICIOUS! My boyfriend is a meat and potatoes kinda guy, whose isn't!?!?, and he ate almost half of this dish! When I baked it, I kept it uncovered and for the last 3 or so minutes I put the broiler on to get the cheese nice and crusty and that topped it off nicely.

Excellent!  Entire family loved it!  I was able to make this on a weekday after a full day of work.  It was worth it!   I did add 1 extra Tbsp of ketchup and a 1/4 cup of worstershire to the ground beef and peas in between the layer of carrots and mashed potatoes.

I did add the W.Sauce and the brown gravy to the meat mixture. I used the carrots as suggested, but added some frozen peas on top of it. I added some S.Cream to the mashed potatoes along with the rest of what was called for. Fantasticly flavored. Enjoyed it. Will make it again.

I used the remaining beef broth to defrosted the frozen veg. in a bowl with the microwave. I seasoned the meat the way I like with salt, pepper, worcestershire sauce and cooked with onions. Then, I mixed flour in water before I put it in the meat mixture. I added the beef broth and the ketchup and hot sauce and let simmer for 5 min. I did my own twist to the mash potatoes the way I like it. I didn't sure cheddar cheese because I don't like the way it melts all hard. So, I used mexican shredded cheese and put paprika ontop.

This was a great recipe.  I followed it exactly and it came out perfect.  I would add peas next time like the picture shows.  But otherwise it was a big hit for the St. Patrick¬¥s day party.

This is a delicious dish! I made it on St. Patty's Day for the Hubby. In addition to the beef broth, I added a half packet of Lipton Onion Beefy Soup Mix, about a tablespoon and a half of Lea and Perrins and a big gulp of Guinness! Pair it with a a black and tan or a Guinness. Irish eyes r smiling and your man is going back for seconds :)

Awesome!  I made it for a "Fake St. Pattie's Day" party and everyone loved it.  If you are serving 6, I'd say the serving size is a bit small, but with side dishes it would be fine.  I added a little garlic salt and pepper to the ground beef.  Otherwise cooked as directed.

Run to your kitchen and make this!!!  Even my mother 77 year old mother who never likes anything loved this one!  I added the worsterchire sauce, but I used small canned peas instead of the carrots and I didn't have broth so I used a small can of beef gravy and I used instant mashed potatoes.  We will make this again!

First time ever making Sheperd's pie. It was pretty tasty, followed recipe except used left over roast beef instead of ground beef. 4-yr-old ate it 1-yr-old wouldn't even look at it.

Delicious! It was a BIG hit at the table and I'm definitely going to make it again for a upcoming potluck.
Small changes I made: For the mashed potato I used red potato and decided to omit the butter & cheese. Instead I added minced garlic and upped the amount of onion. I sprinkled cheedar cheese on top about 5 mins before it was done cooking.
Instead of mashing the carrots, I cut them into small pieces and cooked in with the ground beef (which was seasoned with cayenne pepper, black pepper and fresh garlic). I also added green peas for color and taste. 

Thanks again for this awesome recipe!

Five Stars!!!!! Very very good...my family of five gobbled it up!  Substitued frozen peas/carrots/greenbeans/corn in place of mashed carrots--one way to get them to eat their veggies!  Made it with red potatoes.

Delicious-my hubby and three teenage sons loved. I especially liked the carrots-for flavor and color. I did double the beef broth and flour just to make more gravy and seasoned the beef with a favorite meat seasoning mix. Now I know it's a bonus to have leftover mashed potatoes to use for Shepherd's Pie!

Really delicious.  My husband, who doesn't like "casseroles" went back for thirds.  I made it with some leftover mashed potatoes with the cheese stirred in and some diced leftover lamb from Christmas dinner.  Really a nice dinner.

I had never tried Shepherd's Pie until I went to Savannah, GA and had some at Six Pence Pub.  I really liked it, and this is the closest recipe I have found.  I, like the others, used brown gravy.  It was an amazing dish!  Thank you!

Made this Tonight...It was simply amazing my family loved it. I only used half an onion because 1onion for 1lb of meat was too much for my family and I also got the pillbury golden biscuts and laid them over top half way through backing the dish and took it out when the edges were golden brown. The butter pillbusy biscut really added to it! Amazing

So my husband is not a fan of cream of mushroom soup and I was so excited to find a recipe for shepherd's pie that didn't need it.  This recipe was great as is, but I think I will try some of the other reviewers suggestions and add some gravy.

I'm not a good cook and this was really easy to make ! The only thing I would say is that I would like to get more flavor out of it so maybe adding some herbs to the meat could be nice or/and adding garlic to the mashed potatoes. Also instead of cheddar cheese I would maybe use swiss or a bit more flavorful cheese. (but that maybe because I"m French and love cheeses that are strong in taste !)

This recipe was fantastic! I'm eating leftovers as I type!  I did make it a little differently according to things on hand and personal preference like some other reviewers. Easy to make and cheap ingredients for a struggling college student learning her way around the kitchen!  I didn't use onion, beef broth or carrots. Instead I used gravy that I had on hand and peas because I prefer them. I also added Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef and it made a huge difference! Next time I'll probably increase the sauce ingredients.

My husband loved this dish! I followed some other reviews and used gravy with the meat.  I also added a layer of green beans, corn, and carrots.  This recipe will definitely be going in the lineup!

YUMMY!  Added only the 1/4 cup cheese to the mashed potatoes, didn't put any on top.  Used 3 carrots instead of 5.  Added the suggested 1/4 cup worchestershire sauce to the ground beef.  Used homemade chicken stock instead of beef stock since that's what I had.  This was delicious!  My super picky daughter had 3 helpings!!  There was only a small serving for leftovers lunch the next day and my husband and I both wanted it :)

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the recipe and did not mash the carrots.  This was a hit with all 4 family members and I have promised to make it again for them.

I really like this recipe. I make a few changes in that I used frozen diced mixed veggies instead of just mashed carrots (I simmer them lightly so they're not frozen-I don't mash them) and I season the meat with Chili Sauce (by Heinz) instead of Ketchup. YUM!!!

My husband and I thought this recipe was fantastic!!  I gave rated it four stars only because I changed it slightly.  I only used 3 carrots, and added about 1/2 cup of peas to the meat mixture.  Oh and added a small dollup of sour cream to the mashed potatoes.  But really, this recipe was so good I think it would have been great as written as well.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will be making this again and again.

Had leftover mashed potatoes, so tried this because my daughter had Shepherd's Pie at school and wanted me to make it. My experiences with SP have never been good, so I was wary but this turned out very well and is going into the rotation.

Really good. I did make with instant Idaho butter and herb mash potatoes but it came out really good. I did some frozen mix veggies, add those to the meat, onions and bell pepper. The pie was really good, i like the cheesy taste to the mash taters. I added cheese to the taters than place cheese on top and baked. Followed recipes except used mash taters, will defiantly make again, best Shepherd pie i ever tasted!!!!!! KUDOS!! i love this site

It was delicious!  I did add a little HP sauce to the the gravy.  Definitely make enough gravy, as it complements everything else well. I didn't have any carrots, so I just tossed a can of peas on top of the beef.  Hubby loved it!

I mix in about a tsp of rubbed sage and a tsp of dried thyme in addition to worchestershire sauce to the meat. I also took others' advice and added mixed veggies. I mash the potatoes and carrots together and melt in about a cup of cubed Velveeta to spread on top. Excellent recipe that finds its way into my meal rotation quite often!

Outstanding!  I am British and have been making Shepherd's Pie for years.  This is a nice, easy shortcut compared to the traditional version which is made with ground lamb and takes ages to put together.  This is a very savory recipe and I followed it to the letter.  Next time I will throw in mushrooms, corn and perhaps additional veggies.  The mashed carrots are a great touch!  This will be as staple in my house!

Tried this recipe for the first time tonight, after reading all the glowing reviews. I followed the recipe to a T. I have to say, it was decent, but definitely doesn't deserve 5 stars. There was a big something missing in the taste department. It was just really bland. Not bad, just BLAND.  I think next time I will add the worcheshire sauce like everybody suggested.

I think this recipe is a smart idea, I just didn't happen to care for it. I think it just needs some flavoring added to the meat some how.

Fine, but a bit plain for all that effort.  I will try to find a way to jazz it up.

Family loved it!!! Basic recipe was great. However  the second time I added a few things, when cooking the beef, I added 1.5 cups mushrooms and two cloves of garlic finely chopped, also omitted the salt.  When beef was cooked, I added peas and corn. When boiling the potatoes tossed in a garlic clove which I leave in and mash with the potatoes, again omitted the salt.  Since I cook for two young children the more veggies I can jam into a recipe the better. Plus by adding more garlic I can eliminate salt.... it helps that my family loves garlic.

Made it as is with the exception of adding 1/4 c. Worchestershire sauce.  Personally thought it was too much.  Next time will make it w/ 1/8 c. sauce.  Family liked it but husband wanted tator tots instead of the mashed potatoes and more cheese.  Sometimes I just can't please him;)

Love it!!! I used instant potatoes on the top and added a layer of american cheese strips in between two layers of potatoes b/c we did not have any cheddar on hand. We used ground turkey and added a packet of onion soup/dip mix. It came out absolutely delicious, our first try at Shepherd's Pie, we will definitely make this again!!

Maybe I did something wrong. Maybe I just need more flavor. My family found this okay. Completely edible, but bland. I won't be making it again.

This has been my favorite Shepherd's Pie recipe.  I did what many others suggested (adding worchestishire sauce, sour cream to potatoes, and gravy mix to meat mixture).  An incredible go-to recipe for any time of the year.

Technically this is cottage pie as it uses beef (Shepherd's Pie uses minced lamb) but still very good.

This was good, but not excellent. Could just be my and my husband's taste, but it was just ok. I added the 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce and switched out the carrots for peas and corns since I didn't have any carrots to hand. Also I used monteray jack instead of cheddar as my husband had eaten all my cheddar. Whoops. But I don't think that had much bearing on the overall taste.

Oh so delicious!  I have never made a shepherd's pie before, but I'm adding this to my favorites for sure.  I followed the recipe except I added peas, corn, and garlic to the meat mixture.  I also used beef Better than Bouillon for the beef broth and made it extra strong for more flavor.  I thought the mashed carrots were great and the cheese and onion in the potatoes added tremendous flavor.  My husband and I both went back for seconds and I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Great basic recipe that lends itself well to personal adaptation. I used all the listed ingredients and added some things to suit my family's taste:   I sauted one large onion and a large clove of garlic with the ground beef, and I cooked the mushrooms with it in the pan. I also seasoned with a No-Salt seasoning blend, some garlic pepper, and a couple dashes of Emeril's Original Essence.  I also reduced the number of carrots and added some frozen mixed veggies in the veggie layer. I did NOT mash the carrots and left them sliced so my toddler could eat them more easily.  Following previous suggestions, I added 1/4 c. Worcestershire, and I increased the broth to 1 cup. b/c mine got a little dry from simmering it longer than the instructions.  When mashing the potatoes, I added milk, butter, salt, and pepper.  I used a 3qt. casserole dish, which made a thinner pie, but I think I added too much, so it wouldn't fit as well in my 2qt dish. Hehe!  I waited for the potatoes to start to get golden before topping with cheese.  My hubby LOVED it, and we will definitely be making it again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at a REAL Sheperd's Pie.  I've made an "ok" diet version with ground turkey and sweet potatoes, but the turkey was  a bit on the bland side.  NOT an issue with this recipe!  My husband absolutely LOVED it and we scarfed it down for dinner one night and lunch the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum! Used instant potatoes, corn instead of carrots, added worch. sauce, garlic, 2 tbsp ketchup, and gravy mixed with 1 cup water instead of beef broth. Easy to make ahead and then pop in oven later.

I made this for a potluck and it was a sensational hit! There were people asking me for the recipe - a great compliment. A few changes that I made were that I didn't use ketchup and I added a lot more cheese on the top. Also, I added peas and corn to the mix along with the carrots. It worked beautifully and even without the ketchup, it was very flavourful. It was easy to make and the directions were clear. Loved it!

A little bland. I can't imagine making it with lean ground beef as that would make it even more lacking in flavor. Make it with minced lamb.

An excellent recipe with a few modifications. Added a dash of paprika & montreal rub to give it a little more flavor.

I enjoyed this dish, although I found the prep time long.  My carrots were not completely mashed, but it idin't take away from the dish (at least for me).  I enjoyed the ketchup mixed in the ground beef - gave it a sweet taste.  I'd make this again!

I followed the direction of a previous comment. Instead of the ground beef I used ground turkey (you can't even tell the difference in my opinion) I did add several splases of Worchestire sauce while the meat was cooking and used more onion than suggested with some minced garlic.  Instead of using the beef broth I used 1 pkg of brown gravy mix mixed with 1 cup of water.  I added the gravy mix after the ketchup.  I let that get to a boil and then I added frozen peas and carrots.       All I used for the potatoes was boxed potatoes, I used Garlic Mashed Potatoes and added cheddar cheese in the potatoes and then added cheddar cheese on top.  It was delicious and next time I think I might add some corn with the peas and carrots.  This is definitely a redo!!

Excellent! As suggested by others, I think the key to this dish is a full-flavored, robust meat base. I used a mince for this (extra lean gd beef (or bison) would work just as well), browned with chopped onion. Cooked gently with 1 1/2 c. l/s stock, adding 2 TB ketchup, 2 TB Worcestershire, 1 TB Dijon mustard, thyme, garlic powder, s&p. Thickened with flour/water. I also added 1 c. colby jack to mashed potatoes, and dusted the top with paprika. Definitely not bland.

this was ok, but not very exciting...  I added some frozen corn, because I prefer to add as many veggies as I think I can get my kids to eat...  still needed something, but can't put my finger on it.

I used lamb the first time with gravy instead of broth and frozen peas(didn't have carrots) and added a little gahlic and worcestershire and pepper. Pretty darn good. I think it would be best with ground bison, better taste and healthier. I'll try it next time with low sodium broth and peas & carrots.

This tasted like meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  The flavors weren't great and didn't mingle together.  Didn't finish it all.  Will try another recipe next time.

Very good recipe! I followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out very well. The potatoes are very tasty but they are a little overpowering to the meat mixture. I will make this again.

This was wonderful.  I'll definitely make this again and again!  I put garlic in with the meat and onion and used seasoned salt.  I also used a can of carrots because I didn't have fresh in my fridge.  Next time I might try adding 1/4 c. Worcestershire Sauce...but it was delicious as is.

My Mom does something similar: ground beef with onions browned, adding water and thyme. Mashed potatoes spread out on a plate, add meat with juices and corn, not mashed carrots. So I compromised: no mashed carrots, but added a layer of corn.  Hubby doesn't like the cheese on top, but is okay with it mixed into the potatoes.

I made this without the onions or ketchup. I added some frozen peas and carrots as some of the previous posters suggested. I also added a little canned corn and a little bit of garlic powder to the ground beef. It turned out fabulously!!!! Very feeling. Comfort food.

Delicious!  I forgot to pick up ketchup and broth, so I used beef gravy (1 can) instead.  It was moist and OH SO YUMMY!  This will be be a regular in my house from now on. :)

Pretty Good.  Made it for dinner tonight and the kids even liked it!  I made a few small changes - I mashed the carrots and potatoes together and added a little milk .  I added a dash of Worcestershire Sauce to the meat mixture along with peas and chopped carrot.  Next time, I'll add a bit more Worcestershire and decrease the number of potatoes.  The potato to meat ratio was a little uneven.

This recipe is easy and yummy. I served this for 35 people and they all loved it. I added more spices to flavor the meat and a little bit of milk for the mashed potatoes. This is also a great recipe to take over to someone's house.

Made recipe as written except for one substitution.  Since I was out of ketchup I used bbq sauce, other than  that it was the same.  Very good recipe and would be easy to put your own spin on it

Pretty good.  Lacking some flare even though I added garlic, worteshire, salt and pepper to the meat. Next time I'll add some tomato sauce I think.  Also added corn.

i loved this! it wasn't hard at all. I halfed the recipe, but at some point it reverted back to the previous amount of servings. so we ended up with the normal amount of meat but less potatoes. It was fabulous that way, and i only noticed later! I went with previous reviewers suggestions and added worcestershire to the meat. I may try country sausage some time. What i loved most about this was that my kids loved it, and they ate vegatables without knowing it! we had no left overs which is a good thing for us. Our leftovers always go bad! what a delicious easy dinner!

I really enjoyed making this dish. Used the packed of gravy mix instead of the beef broth as suggested by others. I did not use onions; instead I used onion powder and garlic powder. I used 1/2 low sodium can peas, 1/2 low sodium can corn, 1/2 can of carrots. The only thing that I will change next time I make this dish is adding more flavor/seasoning to the mash potatoes. I definitely put this on my favorites list!

This is wonderful!  I omitted the ketchup, flour, and beef broth and used Campbell's condensed beef vegetable soup with a little bit of water.  I prefer it to the gravy, plus it adds a few more vegetables in.  Easy and it comes out great!

This is a great base for a recipe. The one thing I changed was that instead of using beef broth I added cream of mushroom soup to the meat while it was cooking. It came out really well. I think that five carrots might to too much though. All my friends loved this dish!

this recipe came out great and my family loved it, i made a few change though. I used a can of campbells beef gravy and i used the steam and mash potatoes that comes in the freezer to speed up the process. It was very tasty.

This pie is amazing! I did make a few changes. I omitted the 3/4 of beef broth and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour for a cube of beef broth sprinkled over the beef during the cooking stages. I also omitted the mashed carrot and added canned corn once the beef is cooked. Then I proceeded as usual. Anyway, this was amazing!

This turned out well but it needed some more seasoning in my opinion. Great base recipe though.

Served this at a dinner party this week.  Everyone loved it.  Easy to make.  I piped on the potatos for a fun finished top, adding extra cheese!

Very..very good. I love shepherd's pie.  I was a little bit unsure about adding the ketchup (as I never added it before) but it came out really good. Recommend to all as a family keeper. I did however omit the mashed carrots and added frozen mixed vegetables instead.  Perfect!

This is good, however, I added a few spices to the meat such as a favourite steak sauce. To make a quicker version, I used a can of peas and carrots and for our Shepherd Pie we always add a can of good Creamed Corn. Kids love the corn and the cream mixes nicely with the potatoes. Enjoy.

My family loved this shepherds pie. I added frozen peas. I couldn't figure out how to "mash" carrots but I boiled them and put them in the food prosessor.

Was pretty good.  Made for my family.  We thought that the meat part needed more spice and was kind of bland.  I think next time I would add a little salt and pepper and maybe a some red pepper flakes to the ground beef.

I'm afraid I was misled by the picture that was shown with the recipe. It definitely Does show peas and NO mashed carrots.  My family didn't like the texture. Sorry....

Awesome!  I added celery while the onions were cooking in the oil and as soon as the beef had about 5 more minutes I add frozen sweet corn.  Yummy!! Thanks for sharing!

I love this b/c of the lack of cream soups AND the mashed carrots. It's light and filling at the same time!   I didn't use the ketchup (b/c I didn't have any) but it was still delish!

Great recipe! we did think the meat was a little plain for us so i used 1 extra tablespoon of ketchup and i used worcestershire sauce. I also used canned carrots, green beans, corn and peas. It was GREAT! my boyfriend keeped going for left overs and still brags to his friends about how great this shepherds pie is. we like going to irish restaurants and this was just as good or better!

Great recipe.  I made a few changes, just due to what I had on hand.  Instead of the ketchup, I added about I cup of home-made bolognese sauce.  We make a big batch of this every wek, so we always have some on hand.  I used frozen mixed vegetables (peas, corn, carrots) and added to the beef as it was browning.    I mixed about 1 teaspoon of butter and one teaspoon of flour together over low heat and added i cup of beef broth.  This made a nice gravy that I mixed into the beff mixture.  Then I put the whole mixture into the casserole and into the oven on low heat for a couple of hours... the flavours came together nicely.  I would imagine that a slow cooker would work just as well.  For the potatoes, I used roasted garlic and added it to the mash.  When I'm in a fussy mood, I use a large star-tip and piping bag to put on the mash.  It looks pretty and keeps the potatoes nice and fluffy on top of the meat, instead pressed into the meat as happens with the spoon and spread method.  Overall, big hit and can be modified to suit any taste.

Good comfort food.  I did add the brown gravy and Wor sauce, but next time I'll definitely leave out the Wor sauce.  It gave it a twang that my family didn't like.  Will definitely make this again though, good base recipe.

I changed up the meat layer a bit. First I browned the ground beef and drained it. In the same pan I sauted diced onions until they are soft. Then I add the garlic and cook that all together for about a minute. I ADD A PACKET OF BROWN GRAVY MIX plus the recommended amount of water (it really makes the meat taste juicy). I let that cook until it thickens. I add the meat to the gravy mixture as well as a few cups of frozen peas and carrots. Then assemble the sheperd's pie as usual.

This recipe was very easy, and my family thought it was delicious. I substituted frozen mixed veggies for carrot mash and dryed onion flakes to mash potatoes. I added 2 tsp. minced garlic to meat and onion mixture. I also topped veggie layer with a mixture of condensed cheddar cheese soup and 1/2cup of starchy potatoe water. The meat I used was a mix of half gr. turkey and half gr. venison. I have three small children and it only took me 30min. to prepare, which is wonderful and very yummy! Thanks

This is THE best Sheperd's Pie I've had. I added fresh mushrooms to the meat along with a few splashes of worcestershire's sauce. I also used 2 lbs. of beef for this to have plenty of leftovers. I added a little bit of sour cream to the mashed potatoes, about a 1/2 cup or so. Fantastic!

Delicious!! BF was a little wary of it when he saw it come out of the oven but after trying it he loved it! No leftovers! I followed others' advise by adding worch sauce and extra ketchup. I didn't mash the carrots and I added peas. Yum!

Wonderful recipe! I almost never follow a recipe precisely, and this one was no different. One suggestion - Add worcesteshire sauce and garlic powder to the broth. It gives the filling a tangy flavor and it's wonderful. Use whatever veggies you like canned or frozen. Sure to be a hit!

The only change I made was adding some left over peas I had in my fridge. Next time I think I'll add some additional flour and broth to add more of a gravy to the pie. Great recipe!!! The boys ate until they were in a food coma. One of them remarked, "I know I shouldn't have another helping. But I can't help myself. It's SO good."

I have made this many times. Some times I use ground turkey instead of ground beef. Sometimes I add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce too. I use brown gravy instead of broth. and instead of carrots, I use some frozen mixed veggies. My boyfriend even loved this. I was worried because he loves shepherds pie and loves the way his mom makes it, and I knew this was different. But he loved it and said it was amazing.

This 5 stars is dependent on the changes made by another reviewer (the most helpful one). Have to have gravy and worsh. sauce, also peas and carrots instead of just the carrots. My husband is Irish (actually from Ireland) and gobbled this up. I must say, it was restaurant good.

I added Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder to the meat and it added plenty of flavor; I omitted the beef broth because it seemed unnecessary. Instead of the carrots, I added a bag of frozen veggies on top of the meat and the flour added did a good job of absorbing any excess liquid. Came out great, will definitely make again with my additions.

We really enjoyed this recipe! Changed up a few things to our liking. Added garlic powder to the mashed potatoes. We also used a brown gravy packet and 1 cup water instead of instead of beef broth. Used a pkg of frozen mixed veggies(heated) instead of the smashed carrots. We left the skins on the potato when we mashed them. Turned out great!

I used the gravy mix as suggested instead of the beef broth and also added the worcestershire sauce to the beef to add flavor. I used 15-20 baby peeled carrots steamed them, did not mash and laid them over the meat mixture. My first shepherd's pie. Very good.

This was delicious!  I followed other reviewers recommendations and added 1/4 cup Worchestershire to meat.  I omitted beef broth and added 1 packet of beef gravy and 1 cup of water.  I also added 1 glove of garlic.   I sauteed all of the onion together and put 1/4 of it with the mashed potatoes - to that I added about a cup of sour cream, cheese, salt and pepper.  I topped this with lots of cheese! I loved the mashed carrot - I did not put a layer all around the dish, I put dollops of carrot randomly around.  It was nice digging in and finding a carrot surprise!  I also added a bag of frozen mixed veges. Boyfriend loved this (his first time having Shepherd's Pie!), will definetely make again.  Thanks Jacquie!

Gosh, hard to say since I didn't use as is.  I did make some modifications as others stated.  I did add the 1/4 cup of Worcestshire sauce and added gravy to my mix as well.  My husband still enjoyed it and it turned out really tasty.  Can't say my mashed potatoes were great (but that was my fault)..added to much liquid.  Thank you!

I might not have added enough cheese 'cause I eyeballed it. Dad premade the mashed potatoes too so that was out of my hands ... it came out pretty good but I didn't follow the recipe so it's hard to tell if it would have gotten a 5!

The addition of beef stock and flour made all the difference in this recipe.   I didn't have beef stock so I just used beef cubes diluted in water.   My pie turned out superb and everyone was raving about it. Thank you for sharing!

I followed the suggestion to put Worcester in the meat before cooking it, and I used the brown gravy pack and 1 cup water. And the frozen peas.  A little more onion and some garlic, it was really good. We will make it again.

Not a bad basic recipe - a bit bland though! Added garlic powder while browning the meat. Also 1/2 tsp. thyme.  Could have used a bit more liquid - I added more beef broth. Used frozen veggies instead and put sour cream in the mashed potatoes. My boys both liked the results.

I usually have my favorite recipe for Shepherds Pie that I haved used for years but this will definitely go into the rotation. I don't normally like to rate the recipe if I have made changes but the only thing I added was cooked peas to the meat mixture. The layer of mashed carrots was excellent and made such a hearty casserole. Thanks for this one.

This was really good! I know I used a few more potatoes and instead of the shredded up carrot layer, I simply heated up a bag and a half of frozen peas and carrots and mixed them with the meat mixture in the casserole dish. I took the advice adding a 1/4 c. Worcestershire sauce to the meat (I used ground turkey), used the entire can of beef broth and 2 tbs. ketchup to compensate for the extra veggies. Prep time was a bit, but it was really good. Also placed in a 3 qt. casserole dish to compensate for the additional veggies.

Excellent.  I like the mashed carrot layer.  Added Worcestershire sauce as per other reviews.  It was a little bland (i.e. no extra spices stand out) but that was just right for Shepherd's Pie.

Didn't do carrots; instead just added frozen peas and corn on top of meat which is what I had on hand.  Used leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes (a lot!).  Texture was mushy, so my one picky child gagged at it; the rest of us enjoyed.  Tasty, but not spectacular.

Great recipe...and I usually am not a fan of shepherds pie. To cut down on time I used some garlic red skin mash potatoes from the store that are really good. I stuck with the recipe as far as the gravy goes and it was good, but I think I will double the amount next time as there wasn't enough.

This recipe is great. I have made a few tweaks here and there. Instead of broth i add beef stock. I also add a little garlic powder to the potatoes and just a tad to the meat. I also either used frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrots) or I add those same items and just make them fresh depending on what kind of time I have. I use only 1 tablespoon of flour instead of 2 and an extra table spoon of butter. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as my husband and I do :)

Excellent! Followed the reviews of others and added garlic along with the onions when cooking the ground beef.  I also boiled the carrots and potatoes together and separated them afterwards.  I added some peas as well. I doubled the amount of ketchup for the ground beef.  I also used beef gravy mix and water to replace the broth.  Next time I will add a little worceshire sauce to the ground beef.  I also added some milk to the mashed potatoes because I thought they'd be too dry without it.  I only cooked it for 15 mins. My husband put some tabasco sauce on his.  I will definitley make this again.

Made it for the first time today and it came out good.  I followed a few alterations recommended by previous writers and added some of my own.  I added about 1/4 cup of low fat milk to the mashed potatoes to make them more creamy, and sauteed the onions with some garlic.  We're big fans of garlic mashed potatoes.  I could only find 10oz canned beef gravy in the store, but that worked well.  I definitely recommend adding gravy & the worchestire sauce.  Made a big difference in flavor.  Also used frozen peas for taste and color.  I will definitely be making this again.

my kids love shepherd's pie and this is the perfect recipe for a hearty family dinner. I love the addition of onions to the potatoes. It adds a wonderful twist to this already flavorful meal.

This taste like MORE!! It was that good. I did add some frozen corn from the garden, and in my mashed potatoes I did our "Holiday" version. I add sour cream, cream cheese and then shredded cheese on top. Thie is a definate keeper!

Not the best shepherd's pie that I've made.  It's a little plain.  I will keep looking.

This was pretty good, but a little bland. It tasted better the second day (leftovers).

Good and easy recipe! I followed the other reviews to use worcestershire sauce. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 c. worcestershire sauce.  I chopped and sauteed 1 onions with about 3 cloves of chopped garlic.  I boiled 8 red potatoes (did not peel, let cool, and then cubed them prior to mashing).  I diced 3 green onions.  I mashed the potatoes with the green onions, 1 tbsp butter, and 4-6 oz sour cream.  I did not have carrots and used a bag of frozen peas to spread over the meat mixture.

I really enjoyed this! I made a few modifications so that's why it got 4 stars. I used half a pound ground turkey and half a pound ground pork instead of beef. I cooked the meat in onions and garlic instead of just onions. I also seasoned the meat with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper, then added a few splashes of Worcestershire. I double the ketchup. I think this was really necessary to give the meat some flavor. I used the "Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes" recipe for the potato topping. We use that recipe a lot (with red and Idaho potatoes) and it made the topping extra tasty! I also used cut up baby carrots, and some canned corn and green beans (drained) for the veggies. This recipe was a really great starting off point, so thanks for sharing! It really tasted better the second day!

This was SO GOOD! I took other reviewers' advice and used gravy powder instead of flour, added garlic, and added some worcestershire sauce. I also omitted the cheese. It was really easy to make! Serve with Tabasco--it adds a nice kick.

Delicious!  I followed some other reviews by cooking the potatoes and carrots together (separating them...not so fun since I used baby carrots, but more fun than cleaning another pot!), using Worcestershire in the ground beef, and sour cream in the potatoes.  My favorite layer was the mashed carrot layer!  I've always had cottage pie with the mixed veggies as a layer, but the carrot mash was delish!

This turned out really great.  I played with the recipe a bit.  I used green onion in the mashed potatoes as well as sour cream.  I omitted the onion and put garlic and Worcestershire Sauce in the beef.  I used chili sauce instead of ketchup and increased the amount.  I chose not to mash the carrots and also added peas and corn.  Very yummy.

Excellent recipe, especially for a first time shepherd pie maker!  The only things I did different, instead of ground beef I used chunks of steak and added for the gravy 1 cup of red wine (waiting to be thrown from the night before) and, I have to say recycling is the way to go..delish!!  I'll use this recipe again.

This was pretty good! I did add Worcestershire sauce and brown gravy to the meat as another reviewer suggested and I also made some peas and corn that I added to the mix. It's just me and my husband so I used 3 potatoes and found that to be too much. Next time I think I'll use 2 potatoes and more ground beef.

Very quick and easy prep - that's because I opted to use frozen peas and carrots versus mashed carrots! Followed everyone's advice and used: 1 C brown gravy, 2 T ketchup, and 1/4 C Worsch. sauce. DELISH! Will definitely be making this again!  Recipe as is? With all the doctoring up, the flavoring IMO was perfect and subtle, so I can only imagine that the original recipe would have needed something 'extra' for our household.

Very good recipe. I did change things just a little bit, based on our family preference (we did not mash the carrot, but mixed the chopped, cooked carrot into the beef mixture, along with some whole kernel corn), and I added garlic to the meat and potatoes. This was a very tasty dish. We'll definitely use this recipe again.

VERY time consuming!  But does taste delicious.  The prep time takes about 1 hour, and that is with my husband helping too.  We use 3 large potatoes instead of 4 and green onion instead of the finely chopped onion.  When mashing the potatoes, I add in 1/4 cup sour cream, garlic powder and some milk until it is the consistency that I like. I always slice the carrots, and cook them in the microwave in a bowl with water. I add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the beef, skip the flour and beef broth, use 2 tbsp of ketchup instead of 1, and add in 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce, making sure to drain the meat well before adding those flavourings.  I change the layering a bit too by adding a thin layer of cheese right after the meat. I add 1 cup frozen peas and layer them on top of the carrots.   To finish it off I sprinkle the cheese on top of the potatoes and then sprinkle paprika on top of that.  It may be a lot of changes, but if I am going to spend all that time making it I like to cater the recipe to our tastes.

I cannot rate this highly enough! Turned out great on my first attempt at ever making this! I used ground turkey instead of beef, increased the ketchup, and added a pinch of parsley to the meat. For broth I used "Better than Bullion," which I love. Added beans and peppers from the garden and - voila!

I multiplied this recipe to feed 80 people for our Wednesday night church supper. I go so many compliments on this! I added the 1/4 cup Worchestershire sauce and a little more ketchup than called for. Since I was doing this for so many people, I used instant potatoes, but doctored them up with some sour cream and stirred the cheese into the potatoes as well as topping them with it. I added frozen peas and carrot and frozen corn to the meat. Wow I am so making this again! YUMMO!

This was really good! My boyfriend LOVED it... he asked me to make it again less than a week later. I made the recommended changes (using gravy mix & worcestershire sauce in the meat, and I added a whole bag of mixed veggies.) I will def. make this again!

Very good and versatile. I've made Shepherd Pie before that took much more time than this so the quick prep was nice. Cooked the meat with a few dashes of worcestershire and a brown gravy packet as suggested by others. I used frozen mixed veggies to get some variety- microwaved them to get them warm before adding it to the pie. Added more butter and cheese to the potatoes to get more flavor. Will make this again and go with less worcestershire but will add more pepper.

Very yummy!  I'd never made it before, and it came out so good.  I accidentally didnt' cook the carrots all the way, so when I went to mash them, they didn't - but that was OK, I just sliced them and made them a layer and it was very good!  Definitely recommend what other reviewers said about adding a little Worcestershire to the meat - came out great that way.

This was good, I did everything like the recipe said except I didn't have carrots in the house, so I used a can of corn.  I think next time I make it I will use more vegetables, I don't think one is enough.

This was delicious!!  I made it as posted with three exceptions: I use "Better Than Bullion" as opposed to beef bullion or beef broth, added a clove of minced garlic and all I had in the house was Colby cheese.  This goes in the permanent file!

This was my very first Shepherd's Pie and it turned out great! I didn't mush up the carrots and I added peas and corn. The only thing I think would have made it even better is if I had made gravy to go with it, but no complaints here! Will definitely make again, thanks for sharing :)

I LOVE this recipe!  I love this shepherd's pie so much, I could rave about it and eat it all day!  MMMM just thinking about it makes me hungry!  It takes a while to make but the end result is nothing short of AWESOME.  I didn't even know I'd be such a huge fan of this because I'm not a huge meat-eater, but wow this is sooo good!  I think next time I make it, I will add some peas as well to go with the carrots.  I could eat this everyday and not get sick of it!

A very good base recipe for shepherd's pie!  I've never made it before but I think it turned out beautifully.  I have a certain way of making my mashed potatoes so I made it that way with the addition of baby dill.  But I did follow other reviewers' advice and added Worcestshire sauce, beef gravy, and more ketchup.  Comfort food at its finest.

Excellent recipe that I will be sure to make again! Like everyone, I made changes that appealed to me: I omitted the onions from the mashed potatoes and added fresh parsley and minced garlic, as well as the butter and some skim milk until it reached my desired texture. I used ground lamb instead of beef and omitted the ketchup, using 1/4 cupf of Worchestershire  sauce and thyme. Next time I will add the Worchestershire after it's cooked and drained for added flavor, although it still had flavor. Instead of boiling and mashing carrots, I just poured frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, green beans, peas and corn - straight from the freezer) on top of the meat mixture and then topped that with the mashed potatoes and cheese. Next time I may do a layer of fresh mushrooms as well. This was a great, hearty meal that was good on the second and third day as well!

it's been awhile since I started making this dish... but we have this for dinner at least every couple of weeks. It's delicious! I made a few changes to mine though... -I took the advice of another reviewer & add 1/4 cup woshishire sauce to the hamburger, except I add it after it's cooked & drained (it adds a good flavor to the otherwise bland meat) - same reviewers advise: instead of the beef broth I use a packet of brown gravy mix mixed with 1 cup water.  -I also use a little bit more butter in the potato mix (about 3 tablespoons... we love butter!) & I add a little more ketchup to the meat (total of  tablespoons)  -Instead of the mashed carrots I just add about 3 fresh... peeled, chopped & boiled (about 15 minutes) carrots & throw in about 2 cups of cooked (about 8 minutes) frozen peas to the meat mixture before I top with the potatoes.  Everyone loves this dish. Our 2 daughters (ages 11 & 5) love it too. 5 stars because this dish has absolutely become a family favorite!

I thought this Shepherd's Pie was really good, delicious even - but I had a hard time mashing the potatoes myself without the necessary tools, so my hands were aching at the end and the top layer of the pie was lumpy. It took much longer than an hour to prepare and cook, too. Also, I seasoned the meat with some Adobo and Oregano. I will try it again in the future, though. :)

Excellent w/suggestions taken of adding some Worchestershire Sauce, garlic, doubled the butter, and added Sour Cream to the potatoes.  Even my young children loved it.  Have to double the recipe for our family of five -- in order to have enough for lunches the next day.

This was very good!  I only made a few substitutions based on our diet and what I had available.  I used ground chicken, vegi-broth, tomato paste, and powdered gravy in loo of beef, beef broth, ketchup, and flour.

I don't use broth or ketchup when making Shepherds pie. I add package of Leek Soup Mix to cooked ground beef. To potatoes I add cheddar cheese and some Chive and onion cream cheese. The veggies I use vary depending on what we are in the mood for. I get rave reviews even from those that don't like Shepherd's Pie!

This was my first attempt at Shepherd's Pie. I will definitely make it again with a few changes...first off, no onions in the mashed potatoes...not matter what you do, they're still crunchy which messes up the whole texture...also, I will add more seasoning to the meat; it needed something extra. Overall a good (and pretty easy) meal, it is also much better the second day after all the flavors have melted together. Note: I did put carrots, peas and celery in mine!

Really good!  Used half a vidalia onion, a beef boullion cube, paprika, Mrs Dash garlic and herb blend and some frozen peas.  Took a short-cut by using Bob Evans mashed potatoes on the top.  Will definitely make this again!

This was great, and my fiance (picky eater) also loved it! I've always thought shepherd's pie was a little blah, but I loved your idea with the mashed carrots and cheesey potatoes, so I gave it a try.  I only give this FOUR stars though, because I did make a few changes, and added some seasoning as most reviewers suggested.  Firstly, I omitted the onions since the SO hates them...I snuck in some onion powder though (apparently it's the texture that gets him), and sauteed up some fresh garlic in the onion's place.  I also added a bunch of fresh chopped parsley, and sauteed the meat in the seasoning mixture.  I left out the ketchup per my own preference, in favor of about 1/4 C worcestershire, and added salt and pepper to taste.  And of course, I just couldn't imagine a shepherd's pie without peas and corn (maybe this is a regional thing?), so I put those between the meat and carrots.  In the end, this had TONS of flavor!  You just need to add your own flare, it's a very versatile recipe that would go great with a number of seasonings.  Thanks for giving me an idea for sheppherd's pie that I enjoy!

I have made this recipe many times and we love it. The only thing I found I neeed to do was  double the meat mixture . Each time I made it everyone kept asking for more of the meat because there was plenty of potato  and carrot. It is a regular part of our meal rotation.

This was really good!  I didn't have time to cook the carrots separately and mash them too so I just added frozen peas and carrots to the beef mixture.  I did as other reviewers suggested and used the beef gravy mix.  My husband and 11 month old son LOVED this!

Liked this one alot although i didnt follow recipe exactly. I didnt like the idea of layered mashed carrots so like alot of other reviewers, i diced up carrots and cooked with meat. I also added peas just cause i felt like it was lacking vegetables. After making meat mixture as written, i found the need to add alot of seasoning. It was pretty bland as is. Simple salt, pepper, and garlic powder did the trick. Will make again!

Yummy!! This is comfort food at it's best. I did double the meat and gravy mixture and jazzed the spices up a bit. I also used frozen pea's and carrot's insted of the mashed carrots. This is going to be a staple recipe from now on.

Very yummy. The whole family enjoyed it. I added brown gravy to one cup of water instead of the broth. And one Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and an additional 1/2 cup of water.

My family loved this recipe. I did modify a bit. I added sour cream to the potatoes when mashing, and I also chopped up two cloves of garlic and put them in with the potatoes.    I added corn as well. My husband insisted on eating a second helping, and stuffed himself silly. It was wonderful. :great recipe!:

Tasty except for the tasted of the worcester sauce...I didn't like that at all. Next time i'll omit. Also, I felt that the mashed potatoes could have been a bit firmer. I've seen some recipes that add egg to it before baking, I'll try that next time.

Followed the recipe as written and it was delicious! Very filling also. Only downfall is the amount of dishes that are created with it...lol *UPDATE* So I modified it to only use minimal dishes, which only eliminated 1 but that counts in my book...Instead of boiling potatoes and carrots seperately I boiled them together with the onion. Mashed together as well, my son is picky and loves potatoes so this made it so he couldn't really pick around the potato. I don't completely mash I 'smash' so you get chunks of each for a good mouth feel. Very delicious! I also sprinkled a little salt and pepper over the potato/carrot mash before putting cheese on. This time around I didn't realize I had no cheddar so we used monterey jack cheese.

This is a great Shepherds Pie and relatively easy to make. Especially if you have leftover carrots and potato's sitting in the fridge. This would be pretty difficult to mess up!! Thanx for shariing

Love this recipes.  I always double it and make two.  One to eat and one to freeze for a busy night.  I just take it out of the freezer the night before and put it in the fridge.  Then pop it into the over at 350 and let it warm through...usually takes 30 to 40 mins.

It really ended up dry.  I had high hopes.  Perhaps I'll try it again to make sure I didn't do something to cause the problem.

This is a great recipie.  The first time I made it, my family (kids especially)loved it.  My daughter asked for it again this week and I just took it out of the oven.  I added peas (the frozen steamable ones) and jazzed up everything a little bit with my own seasoning combinations.  I also added parmasean cheese to the potatoes and some sour cream.  Its a winner, delicious.  Enjoy.

Eating this as I type and boy is it good.  I pretty much followed the directions.  Sauteed onion & 2 cloves garlic before browning meat and added 2 tbl ketchup and worst.  Used the brown gravy since thats all I had.  Also added a can of corn on top of meat, under carrots.  Try to make this when you have extra mashed taters cause this takes awhile to make if you have to make the potatos from scratch.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe !

If you want to save yourself some prep time, wait to make this with leftover mashed potatoes or vegetables! It will taste just as good if you add the extras mentioned in the other reviews.

I made this for my small group at Church and they absolutely raved about it. Definitely a keeper and so easy to make!  I used instant mashed potatoes and added sour cream to the onions and butter. I also pureed most of the onions for the ground beef in my Cuisinart so even the pickiest of eaters wouldn't wrinkle their nose up at the texture.

This is a great basic recipe that can easily be adapted to suit your own tastes.  I boiled my carrots and potatoes together and mashed them together omiting the onion and cheese.  I browned the ground beef with the onion and some garlic.  Followed the rest of the recipe for making the sauce adding slightly more ketchup and some Worchestershire sauce.  I added some frozen peas and corn to the meat mix topped with the mashed potato/carrot mix and topped with shredded cheese.  Delicious comfort food that the entire family loved.

My husband who says he does not like shepherd's pie, loved this! My four year old loved it too. I made two versions, one with meat and a vegetarian version. For the vegetarian version, I substituted Morning Star Farms recipe crumbles for ground beef and vegetable broth for beef broth. The only changes I made were adding some Roasted Garlic to the potatoes. I also made two batches of each version and froze one for later.  The other I prepared and put in the refrigerator so all my husband had to do was put it in the oven while I was at work. The reheated leftovers were just as good too!

I followed this recipe almost to the letter, except I omitted the onions in the mashed potato. I used around three quarters of an onion in the beef and 1 clove of garlic because I adore it! I added slightly more water with the beef stock. The recipe called for 4 large potatoes, but I didn't have 4 large, only 1 large and 4 small. So I used those and it turned out perfectly with just enough potato to cover the dish. My boyfriend absolutely loved it and had 3 servings! The layer of carrots was a wonderful addition. Definitely a winner!

This recipe was A LOT of work for the end result that I got. First of all, four large potatoes is way too much; four medium potatoes would have been more than enough. The potatoes totally overwhelmed the dish. I added peas to the beef mixture as most Shepherd's Pies that I have had included peas. Minus the potato debacle, it was a good recipe, but not good enough to warrant the amount of effort put into making it.

This recipe had gotten so many great reviews so I decided to make it for St. Patty's day last night.  I'm glad I made the gamble because my family lOVED it and there was barely any leftovers! I followed the tip of using the pkg. gravy and water in lieu of beef broth and added to ground turkey. I also added 2T of Worcestershire sauce.  The ketchup didn't sound appealing so I left that out. I used the frozen mixed veggies (coated w/ butter) from Trader Joes that I put under the mashed potatoes. I used a mixed blend of shredded cheese. I must admit, I also used the pre-made mashed potatoes from Costco. It was definitely a semi-homemade version but it was a huge success! I will definitely make it again - outside of St. Patty's Day.

I am basically a complete beginner. My wife won't let me go into the kitchen. After I couldn't make a salad without screwing up, I was banned. My wife has to go to surgery tomorrow, so she's been down. I told her I'd try to make dinner for St. Patrick's Day, and she laughed.  I found this recipe and was able to do it start to finish and have wonderful results.  I followed the advice of SANDIEGOCINDY, and used a German brown gravy instead of the broth. I also added butter to the carrots. I added Meat Magic and Worcestershire sauce, as well as two cloves of garlic to the onions/meat, but didn't use the garlic in the potatoes. I did use a few tablespoons of sour cream in the potatoes, and a 1/2 a cup of mild cheddar.  At the end, I also sprinkled cheddar on top and put scallions.   Everything turned out well, but I was surprised that, even though in the back of my mind I thought it would be over-seasoned, it was "just right," or I should say, required a little salt for my tastes, but wasn't bland.  I didn't feel like Chef Ramsay, but I did feel like it was an excellent result for my first attempt, well, ever. Yeah, I suppose I'm sheltered.   Thanks for all of the advice and the recipe.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day dinner and it was a hit (complimented by green beer, of course)!  I did add a few things.  I added black pepper and garlic powder to the ground beef mixture.  I added a layer of frozen corn in between the ground beef and carrot layers.  (The carrot layer wasn't even noticeable, so I don't think it's really necessary.) And to the potato mixture I added extra butter, sour cream, chives and garlic powder.  I will definitely keep this as my go-to recipe for shepherd's pie!

This is the best Shepherd's Pie I've ever made.  My DH couldn't get enough and my DD didn't complain about the carrots!!!  I caramelized the onions and then cooked the ground beef and added a little garlic.  I also added frozen corn between the meat and the carrots!!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will definitely make this again and again.

My husband absolutely loves this! I enjoy having the carrots as part of it (as opposed to beans or peas). I sometimes puree the carrots and other times just chop them, it is up to you.

Shepherd's pie just not my favorite.Like the ingredients just not together. We used green beans in this too along with the carrots. I am sure that for someone who likes Shepherd's pie would like this fine.  My kids thought it was good and ate the leftovers too but I probably won't make again.

Very easy and very good!  To save time, I used Sidekick's Instant mashed potatoes instead. Also, I did not use cheese because I didn't have cheese in the house but I followed the vegetable and meat part of the recipe.  I would recommend to season the ground beef and add a bit of Worcestershire Sauce to it for a better taste. Other than that, this is a great recipe.

This was very cozy to eat. I will be seasoning the potatoes more next time, more like I'd make my mashed potatoes. I will also use less potatoes, or more meat. I plan on using peas next time too.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. I find great difference in taste when we use top quality meat from the butcher's. I've experimented with few different veggies inside, including corn and sweet potato...they're all good!

This is great.  Next time I'll add a little extra beef.  My son hates cooked carrots ordinarily, but the way these were spead between the layers he had no idea what they were and enjoyed the meal.

I had never had Shepherd's Pie before. But my husband and my kids have at their schools and work. So I figured I'd make it for them using this recipe. I loved it, very easy and filling. My husband and 2 boys said it was the best they've ever had and want me to make it more often. Which I will gladly do!

I absolutely love this recipe! The only change I made was substitute the carrots for 1 cup cooked corn mixed in with the beef. I make this dinner every-other week!

It was a great winter comfort food. I did however, added a lil garlic powder & 2 tsp of worcheshire. The meat was tasted delicious. I also used frozen veggies, instead of mashing the carrots. It needed more salt, otherwise, good!

AWESOME!  I put 2 cups of beef stock in and about 5 tablespoons of flour -- we like alot of gravy!  I used green beans as a layer instead of the carrots, but diced carrots up into tiny pieces and sauteed them with the onions and beef -- healthy, and the kids never suspected!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good.  I did modify it a bit.  I usually make mince and taties (meat and potatoes b/c my mother inlaw is from Scotland).  I decided to try this recipe b/c it is basically the same just put together and baked.  I only used 2 med./large potatoes (cut up), 1 tbs marg. and salt and pepper to taste (skipped the chopped onion and cheese).  I started the potatoes at the beginning and preheated the oven.  The potatoes were ready to mash by time the meat was cooked and the oven was preheated.  I skipped the carrot mash.  For the meat, I used one medium onion, about an 1/8 cup minced garlic (from the jar), ground beef, flour, ketcup, low sodium beef broth, 1/4 cup worchester sauce, a little onion powder, salt and pepper.  I added about a cup of frozen mixed corn and peas at the end before putting in a small round casserole dish.  I skipped the cook flour for 1 minute.  Just mixed in all the ingredients.  I also skipped cheese in the whole dish.  I basically followed directions 1, 3, 4, and 5.  Very good.  Thanks for the recipe (even though I modified it a little)!

This recipe is amazing. I've made it over five times since I discovered it in December last year. We used ground turkey, we add a bit of crushed garlic to the ground turkey when cooking it, and we add barbecue sauce to the ketchup and add it to the turkey. We also use frozen mixed veggies instead of the carrots. It comes very moist, flavorful and delicious. Great job!

For what it is, it's a 5!  Makes leftovers a whole new meal.  Hubby made it for dinner and asked me to put it in my on-line recipe box.  Only real alteration we made was to top it with beef gravy.

Meat was great when I tested it out of the saute pan, but found it too bland when served with the potoates. Might make again, but will adjust.

With a few minor changes this reminded me so much of a recipe my mom made when I was a little kid! Instead of mashing the carrots I added sliced fresh carrots and frozen green beans in with the meat mixture for a few minutes to get them started cooking. This is a good, easy recipe.

This recipe was very good but I made some modifications and took some shortcuts.  First I sauted the onion, then added the ground beef to brown. I seasoned with a mixture of garic salt, pepper, and salt.  Then I added a frozen bag of peas and carrots to the mix, a cup of water, and a brown gravy mix packet until it thickened up.  I cheated and used instant mashed potatoes, they were butter and herb flavored and topped those over the meat mixture.  Then I topped with shredded cheese and green onions and baked.  It was so good.

This recipe was pretty good but I found it didn't have very much flavour at all. To be fair, I do like dishes with a lot of flavour and this might be ok for someone that likes a very bland tasting comfort food dish. After it was done, I put a little worcester sauce and ketchup on my serving and that helped a bit.  Mashing the carrots also took far too much time I thought. My husband enjoyed the carrots though so I've given the recipe 4 stars instead of 3.  I think next time I will choose another recipe or spice this one up and forget the carrots...Instead I'll add frozen peas and carrots.

Even with Worchestershire sauce it was still pretty bland.  Needs to up the meat; reduce potatoes.

This was great, although I did make some changes based on other reviews. I used a 10oz frozen peas and carrots pack, added an extra tablespoon of ketchup, a little over 1/4 cup Worcestershire and I used ground turkey instead of ground beef just as a personal preference.    The only thing I will do differently next time is add a little more flavor to my potatoes. They were good, but I might add some more spices next time.  Overall, this was a great recipe! We'll make this again!

This was a very good recipe.  I did change a few things, however that I think added quite a bit to the recipe.  I skipped the carrot layer and just added chopped carrots into the beef mixture and let saute with celery, zucchini, and onion.  To the potatoes, I added sour cream, garlic salt, and the cheddar as called for.  Everything else I left as is, and it was incredible!

This was really good!  My husband and I thought it was much tastier than most restaurants serve.  I also used 1/4c. worchestershire along with some garlic powder in the gr. beef, and used bag of frozen peas and carrots.  Might cut back on the onion next time or just use a small one.  Great on a cold winter night!

We love shepherds pie and the addition of the mashed carrots as a layer was wonderful!  I did have a hard time mashing the carrots and I had them boiling for 30 minutes!  We also like the meat to have a good gracy so I added a jar of fat free Heinz beef gravy.  I also added corn and peas in the the meat as I like to get in as many vegetables as I can   Overall this was great and I will make again.  I just have to figure out how to boil carrots right!

This was pretty good.  Had to add a lot of salt while we were eating it though - was very bland.  Was nice on a cold winter evening though with some biscuits and applesauce on the side.

I love this recipe. The only thing that I altered was add a bag of frozen veggies instead of pureeing the carrots. And of course I added salt and pepper. That's a given. Make sure you try the beef before you trow it into the oven. I like lots of salt. It was great and my husband is looking forward to me making it again tonight.

Great comfort food for a snowy night. I followed the advice of others and added the following:
3 cloves of garlic 
Several dashes of Worcestershire sauce
More salt
More ketchup
Double the cheese

This is going in the recipe box for the winter season.

Turned out excellently, I cut everything in half. I added seasonings to everything and Worcestershire to the meat. Between 4 people, everything was gone within 25 minutes.

I have made shepherd pie a ton of times and had never tried it with cheese.  What a great addition.  Next time I will use more meat though to even out the ratio.

I loved this. Perfect for a cold winter night. I followed the recipe pretty much as is, but chose to use frozen corn instead (that's how my Dad made it growing up.) I also didn't have any flour, so I held back on the broth and ketchup so it didn't turn out too soupy. Good stuff!

absolutely delicious! I too added slivers of butter (and also milk) to the potatoes as they mashed.  I also added corn to the smashed carrots.....just because my kids love corn.  I cooked the onion in melted butter instead of oil.  I also added a sprinkle of Bisto and a few shakes of seasoned salt to the meat as it cooked.   A little salt and pepper - and perfect!   thank you for a great recipe!

I have made this recipe so many times I'm sick of eating it, it's really quite good after adding the Worcestershire sauce and more ketchup. I also like to add some more frozen veggies like corn and some crushed fennel seeds.

Most excellent! I have never made shepherds pie so this was a first. I added corn to the potato mixture and to the beef/broth/onion/flour mixture I added an entire can of broth not just the 3/4 cup it called for as we like out pie a little less dry, it was not wet AT ALL, and absolutely delicious!I also added fresh garlic when I browned the onions. Next time we will add peas to the beef mixture.

First time i've had this and glad I did.  Instead of boiling the carrots/potatoes I steamed them (i think it retains more nutrients).  Next time we make it I would like to add brown gravy as others suggested to give more flavor :)

Good recipe. LOVE the cheesy potatoes!! Took some other reviewers' hints and added Worschestire sauce, ketchup, and broth to meat and let it come to a boil. My family is NOT big carrot fans, so I just used a bag of frozen mixed veggies, and cooked them in the microwave and used that as my second layer.  I think, next time, I may omit the Worchestire sauce to get a beefy-er taste.

It's a great start up recipe.  To give it some zing (aside from adding the W. sauce) I suggest adding some taco spices and some mustard.  I know this may seem weird, but these ingredients really add body to the shepherd's pie.  good luck!

Hearty man food! I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and cooked the ground beef with half a cup of Worcestershire Sauce when I cooked the beef. I also added milk and more butter to my mashed potatoes because I just think it's weird not to. 
I'm giving this recipe 5 stars, not because I was blown away by the taste, but because it's a dish anyone would like. I had my mother, my sister, and my boyfriend over when I made this. There was no leftovers!
Next time, however, I think I might try the beef gravy tip. I liked it enough to eat too much, but I still could have used a little more flavor.

Really good recipe. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding sweet peas as one of the photos suggested. My boyfriend raved about it and my 2 yr old son seemed to really like it. Very easy to make and cost efficient. I will be adding this to my favorites.

This was really easy to make.  I did use beef base and about 1 Cup Potato water in leiu of Beef Broth.  The whole family loved it.  Hubby could have this "anytime" he said :)

This on it's own is just okay.  I added dry ranch seasoning mix and 2 tbsp sour cream to the mashed potatoes. To the meat I added some mushrooms, garlic powder, salt & pepper. Without all the seasonings I think it would have been very bland. Also if you like an even ratio of meat to potatoes, or maybe even a little more meat you'll want to change it. I only used 3 small russets and it was more than enough. I would recommend only 2 potates for 1 lb of meat.

Even my son liked this one! Used ground turkey instead of beef because I couldn't find the beef in the freezer and nobody even noticed. Added the 1/4 cup of worchestshire and used beef bouillon cubes instead of broth because its what I had. Added a nice flavor to gravy.

I added about a half of a cup of celery with the onion, and a few tablespoons of tomato paste along with the ketchup to give it some color and richness. I noticed that I had to cook the carrots about five minutes longer. My "husband" got up for seconds and thirds, which he never does.

I did find this recipe time consuming but well worth it!

This recipe is exceedingly versatile - there are all kinds of variations that can be made.  Then again, if I'd stuck to the instructions, it might well have gotten five stars.  We used ground pork flavored with seasoning salt instead of ground beef because that's what we had. Paprika on top is a nice touch of color if cheese is not an option for you.  Adults and children both liked it a lot.

This was my first time making Shepherd's Pie - - what have I been waiting for?  It was fantastic, especially on a chilly night.  I used this recipe as a guideline and make a few tweaks.  I had leftover mashed potatoes from a mashed potato casserole the other night so that part was easy.  I added peas and diced tomatoes to the carrots, and added worcestershire sauce and garlic salt to the beef broth gravy.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper.

This was delicious!  I did season the meat as some others mentioned.  I just added salt and pepper and it was great.  I do think that the mashed potatoes were hard to spread so maybe next time I will add milk like I'm making regular mashed potatoes.  Once it baked, though, it was fine.  I also used Monterey Jack cheese because that's what I had on hand and it was very tasty.  I will definitely make this again.  It was a bit of work but absolutely worth it.  Great comfort food.

I liked this meal because it was an easy midweek recipe for ground beef.  This is how I cooked the dish:
Boiled chopped potatoes in a covered dish for 10min. while I was browning the meat.  Then I made the mashed potatoes with milk, sour cream, butter, pepper, salt and garlic (all to taste).  While making the potatoes I popped in a bunch of cut carrots into the microwave in a covered dish and cooked for 8 min.  Then I mashed the carrots up with milk and butter.  To the meat I was browning I added garlic powder, salt, ground pepper, onion powder (since I was out of real onions), almost a whole can of beef consume, 2 tbls. ketchup, 2 tbls. flour.  Be sure to taste test your beef mixture and see if it needs more salt, pepper, or garlic powder.  After the meat mixture was browned I added frozen corn, frozen peas, and a can of green beans.  I placed the beef mixture in a caserol dish then spread the mashed carrots on top of that then spread a layer of potatoes on top of the carrot mixutre.  Finally topped my dish off with shredded cheese.  My husband and I liked the meal for something "different".  It wasn't our favorite, but hubby says he wouldn't mind having it again.

This recipe was very tasty.  I modified the recipe by adding 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce to the hamburger before I cooked it.  I added one packet of gravy with 1 1/2 cups of water for more flavor instead of the broth.  I used corn instead of the carrots.  This was quick and easy and so tasty!

Thanks  Wow, we loved it and will put it on rotation.  Worshershire sauce is a MUST- thanks for the tip.  Not sure if the carrots really need mashed, might add a lot of work and nothing to the taste.  Great dish!!!

I made a few changes to this recipe and it was good. I didn't mash the carrots, but boiled them for a few minutes in the leftover potato water along with some chopped celery. I didn't add ketchup and threw in a generous amount of italian seasoning.

This turned out great - I took some of the other reviewer suggestions and did it with gravy instead of beef broth and I added a bit of Vermouth to that, as well as Worcestershire sauce. DELICIOUS! A great comfort food. It turns out great with ground turkey by the way, my boyfriend didn't even know he was eating turkey instead of beef! I didn't mash the carrots - I left them just chopped and cooked them a bit with the onions and then the turkey - they were crisp but not 'raw' tasting and not mushy, a healthy balance between the two. I'll be making this again when the weather dips below 80 here in the desert. ;)

This was good.  I think it would have been a little weird to mash up the carrots as instructed.  Instead I diced them and cooked them with carrots.  Also, next time I make this, I'll definitely skip the worcestershire sauce - the ground beef tasted far too much like sloppy joe mix with that addition.

I made this using some of the tips I read from others.  I added sour cream, garlic powder, and chives to the potatoes.  I used mushroom gravy mix in the meat and used frozen peas and carrots.  I also browned the cheese on the top.  I barely had any leftovers.

this was sooo good. i used lean steak in place of the burger and also used a gravy mix since my gravy never seems to turn out. to save the hassle of cutting up the veggies, i used mixed frozen veggies and just rinsed them before mixing them with the beef. my fiance loved this as well, so it's now on my monthly meal menu! thanks so much for the recipe, i've never had this before but it was delicious!

I read other reviews and tweaked mine a bit. I used 2 lbs ground chuck, browned with onions, 2 minced garlic cloves, and a few dashes of Worstershire sauce on Tuesday. On Wednesday I warmed the beef/onions, added about 2 Tbsps ketchup, a can of beef broth, a 1 lb pkg of frozen carrots & peas, a can of beef gravy, a packet of onion soup mix and about 1/3 cup of water. I let that simmer for about 10 minutes while I got the potatoes ready. Now here is where I cut a corner I shouldn't have. I mixed 2 pkgs of instant mashed potatoes. I should have made the Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes (found on this site). I also should have put this in a larger casserole dish than a 2 qt. Anyway, I topped it with a combo of shredded colby/monterey jack and baked for 20 minutes. My husband really liked it. He said it reminded him of a thicker beef stew with mashed potatoes on top.
I will make it again and keep tweaking it until I am more satisfied with it, perhaps using corn with the peas instead of carrots next time.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes:
- Used leftover mashed potatoes w/cheese
- After beef/onion was cooked, added frozen peas, cooked chopped carrots, and a can of creamed corn and simmered until heated through.

Very good.  I changed some things to my liking...I used ground turkey to cut down on fat and used smashed cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes to cut down on carbs.  I also added worcestershire to the meat and agree that it would have been a little bland without it.

I gave it three stars only because there wasn't a lot of flavor.  I will make it again but will add more flavor to the beef mixture.

It was OK but would be better if knew exactly how much salt to taste to add. I added some but apparently not enough. Also add salt to water when cooking carrots and potatoes - I forgt to do this. Everyone at the table went crazy with the salt shaker

this was my first attempt at Shepherd's Pie.  I thought the meat came out a bit bland.  I did add 2 garlic cloves to the onion.  I will definitely make the mash potatoes after cooking the meat or better yet use left over mash potatoes. I also used peas which gave it a nice color.  Next time will be better I'm sure.

I loved this recipe! My son is quite the picky eater and I'm usually having to answer questions like "Do I have to eat ALL the carrots mommy?", but didn't hear that this time around. 

Great. I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone. Definitely a family meal. :-)

good starter recipe.  did not give 5 stars as I made a few adjustments per prior reviews.  I added an envelope of beefy onion soup mix and worcestershire to the beef mixture.  I also used frozen mixed veggies in place of the carrots.  I added more butter and some chicken stock to the potatoes to give them more flavor.  Overall a family pleaser!

I FOLLOWED OTHER SUGGESTIONS, AND USED WORSCHIRE AND FROZEN VEGGIES. BUT INSTEAD OF BROTH I USED CONSOMME, (THOUGHT ABOUT FRENCH ONION SOUP). TOMATOE PASTE INSTEAD OF KETCHUP,AND THEN MIXED MY VEGGIES IN THE MEAT MIXTURE. INSTEAD OF MASHED POTATOES I USED LEFT OVER SCALLOP POTATOES,WHIPPED UP USING MY HAND MIXER AND ADDED MILK AS NEEDED. THEN I LAYERED IT ALL IN RAMEKINS, INSTEAD OF A CASSEROLE DISH. MEAT MIXTURE,SHREDDED CHEESE, POTATOES, AND TOPPED WITH PAPRIKA, AND A LITTLE MORE CHEESE. BAKED WHAT I NEEDED AND FROZE THE REST FOR LATER.

My husband and I agreed this was a solid hearty meal but I only gave it 4 stars b/c on some others recommendations I added extra spices to the meat i.e. garlic and also an envelope of beefy onion soup mix.  The meat had great flavor it was actually the potatoes that need sprucing up for us.  Next time I will try to add to those.  I think next time i will layer the cheese throughout the Pie instead of just one top.  Overall good recipe though, thanks!

Although I made a few changes this recipe is great.  I used ground lamb instead of gr. beef, romano cheese in the mashed potatoes and on top, and added peas to the veggie mix and a couple shakes of worchestershire sauce.  Excellent and will make again.

This is a good base recipe, I guess... just boring and BLAND.  I followed the recipe exactly - and added a healthy dose of worcestershire sauce to the meat, 'cuz I love the stuff.  I'm not fan of hot-n-spicy, and prefer a simpler flavor palette - but this recipe straight off the page is boring boring boring. 

I'd rather make tasty tacos in ONE pan in 30 minutes than this insipid dish in 90 minutes while dirtying three pots, two bowls, a baking dish, and a extra utensils.  Some of the suggestions in the comments are cool, like using peas and carrots and instant potatoes - but I need more FLAVOR.

We had this for dinner last night and it was really good...I've never made shepherds pie before, but have always been curious..it was a pleasant surprise. We used skin on red potatoes, and the brown gravy version suggested in previous reviews. I forgot to add the worcestershire that i wanted to try, sliced and steamed fresh carrots (didnt mash them) and added a few frozen peas and corn to that for color. Our 12 year old calls it a "keeper"...Thank you for posting this recipe.

This was very yummy.  I had leftover meatloaf that I used for the meat.  I also used the leftover mashed potatoes for the crust.

I will definitely make this again.

This is an okay shepherd's pie. I have made better ones but this one had good flavor in the ground beef and was very easy to assemble. I did use frozen peas and carrots in place of mashed carrots. My family really liked this but I will continue to try new shepherd's pie recipes. This is not THE ONE, but it's okay till I find it.

I have never attempted shepherd's pie. I didn't have carrots or peas so I opted for green beans and lima beans which are favorites in my house. I only had ground turkey so I added 2 tbsp of ketchup and lots of garlic powder to the beef broth. I enjoyed this but I felt like it needed more gravy so made some on the side to top it off with (beef garlic gravy). It is now a favorite in my house and I try to make it monthly during winter months.

Pretty good, but not our favorite.  I made the mistake of cooking the potatoes and carrots together even though I planned to mash them separately -- dumb!  It was a messy, hot pain to separate the chunks after all was cooked.  I added 1/2 c. worcestershire and doubled the ketchup, plus added some green beans and cooked them in the meat mixture.  Added some sour cream to the potatoes -- they needed a LOT of salt to have much flavor, and we still needed to add salt to our helpings on the plate.  Again, not bad, but not terribly exciting, even with all the tweaking.

I don't generally like Sheppherd's Pie, but made it for my husband.  I added a few cloves of garlic when I chopped the onions and used lamb instead of beef.  I actually liked it alot and it was easy to make.  Will make again.

I just made this recipe and it was pretty easy and delicious. I used ground turkey and turkey sausage instead of the ground beef and I added a Lipton's onion package to it to give it a little bit of flavor. I also mixed in some sliced mushrooms with my onions. Overall, it's a pretty good recipe. Chopping everything up was a little time consuming but I managed. :)

This was great!  I did make quite a few changes.  I used ground turkey and didn‚Äôt bother with the beef base, flour or ketchup.  I added sliced radishes and diced red pepper.  I also missed the step of mixing the cheese with the potatoes so I just sprinkled it on top before baking.  I love how versatile this recipe is.

Great dinner with a few changes. I omitted some steps to save time. I boiled the carrots and potatoes together, browned the beef and onion at the same time and added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. season salt. Perfecto!

This recipe is phenomenal!  I followed a lot of the reviewers' tips, using brown gravy instead of beef broth & adding broccoli as a layer.  My family loved it, and this will definitely be a go-to recipe for me.

This is a tasty and easy recipe to adapt.  It's especially good to have on hand when you have left over mashed potatoes.  We don't like mixed vegies, so I just substituted corn.

This was okay, but it's pretty bland. I used brown gravy and Worcestershire sauce as recommended by other reviewers. I'll probably add more seasoning next time around. I used matchstick carrots and would recommend adding more vegetables, such as corn or peas. I didn't add any extra veggies due to picky eaters at my house. The potatoes definitely need more seasoning, and I couldn't really taste the cheese. This is a good basic recipe that is easily modified to the suit individual tastes.

This recipe was good, but even though I used a few of the other reviewers' suggestions, the shepherd's pie still felt like it was missing something. Next time I'll try it with some chives or garlic, and maybe a few more spices.

I use brown gravy instead of the beef broth, a definite upgrade.  Also, I cook a pot roast and use the meat from that.  The pot roast meant tastes great... give it a try.

OK. It's probably very close to what's served across the pond. I've always found British food bland. This is no exception. I modified the recipe as suggested with brown gravy mix and Worcestershire sauce. Giving it 4 stars because my disappointment with the recipe is simply a matter of personal taste.

I did not have potatotes so I used instant instead. Also, added a can of corn to carrot mixture (did not mash carrots). Very tasty. My picky 1 year old loved it. Will make again and again.

A great hit with the family.  I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and followed some of the suggestions with the Worcestershire sauce and gravy instead of beef broth.  I also added spring(green) onions to the potatoes for a nice flavor and added a bag of frozen veggies to the carrot layer.

Excellent recipe.  Very easy to prepare. I did use a package of Knorrs Brown Gravy Mix together with the beef broth to give it a little more flavor and instead of mashing the carrots I simply cut them into slices and layered them with a can of corn.
A keeper for my family. Thank you.

Great and easy recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviews and added the worcestershire sauce.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic and used a cup of left over brown gravy instead of broth and flour.  I did not mash, rather diced my carrots for texture reasons.  I also used onion powder since my husband does not like onion.

This was really yummy.   My tweaks:  In a 4.5 qt. oven safe sauce pan, I sauteed the onion, then added some pressed garlic.  I mixed the ground beef with 1/4 c. of worst. sauce, then added it to the onion and garlic to brown.  Lots of salt and pepper.  Then I added 2 cans of french style green beans to the meat, and then 1 pkg. of brown gravy and 1 cup water.  I boiled a big bag of carrots until soft, then mashed them with a half a stick of butter.   I whipped up 2 packages of four-cheese instant potatoes.  I layered the mashed carrots on top of the hamburger and green beans (in that same oven safe pan the hamburger browned in), then layered that with the mashed potatoes, and sprinkled a good layer of sharp cheddar cheese on top.  Popped it in the oven until melty and bubbly.   Good comfort food.  My husband wanted more gravy but I don't know that the layers would hold still if it was more saucy.

I do not mash the carrots and I usually use  a package of frozen mixed vegetables mixed in with the meat. I think this recipe is great and it's a very good way to disguise peas and other veggies for children who don't like to eat them.

I followed recipe with the following changes after sampling while preparing, to suit my tastes. I didn't use flour, or ketchup. I made two cups of gravy and mixed it with the ground beef and the carrots before putting it in the casserole dish. IT went FAST. Inlaws, husband and babies ate it up. Great wholesome meal with everything right there in one dish. Thanks.

My kids loved this recipe. It's now my 16 old son's favorite dish. I did add the Worschestire sauce as others recommended and I'm glad I did. I also used instant mashed potatoes. Costco has a brand that comes in pouches and it tastes close to the real thing without the hassle.

Followed advice regarding brown gravy and frozen mixed veggies as well as using worst. sauce to pre-season meat. Turned out great. Would probably substitute canned corn as I prefer corn to mixed veggies. But easy to make and delicious. Onion and cheese in potatoes added flavor. I used boxed potatoes- easy and quick.

Very good! My picky 5 year old LOVES this. I just made some slight changes though. Added some worstershire sauce to the ground beef mixture for some more flavor. I omitted the carrots and added some frozen peas and corn instead. I also left off the cheese.

Wow - this was incredible! I keep kosher so the cheese was out. Instead, I sauteed two onions and lots of garlic, mixed half into the pot. mixture, and browned the meat in the remaining mixture, adding chicken broth (didn't have beef) and a dash of soy sauce. I also added one egg and no butter to the pot, and sprinkled paprika on top. The pie came our fabulous - the entire family loved it. Thanks.

Four stars as written, Five with my changes. I used 1 1/2 C mixed frozen vegetables (thawed) instead of the carrots.  I seasoned the meat & added 1/4 C Worcestershire sauce & used 1 C extra broth to make up for the extra veggies. I also added sour cream to the potatoes. My husband loved this & wants me to make this now instead of my usual Shepherd's Pie recipe. Thanks.

Thank you for this recipe. I have had other recipes for this, but lost them through the years. I ommited the carrots and added peas. I think the meat needs something, I think I remember adding a bay leaf to my other recipe. I'll try that next time.

After reading all the reviews I came up with this - I browned the ground beef with the chopped onion then added 1 jar of beef gravy and stirred in about a handful of each: frozen corn, green beans, green peas & carrots.  I topped with homemade mashed potatoes with very little milk added so they were thick.  Then baked as directed.  My family really enjoyed it, especially my teenage daughter who hates everything these days.

Great recipe. I used boiled carrots and frozen peas. Added the extra worchestershire sauce and ketchup. Added 3 cloves of garlic to the potatoes and mashed with butter, milk & cheese. On the table in 45min, great for our household!

I followed Erin0220's comment, with a few changes myself: used ground buffalo, more ketchup, less Worcestershire, and a bit of beef broth in place of the water (to mix with the gravy).  I also made my own mashed potatoes using Romano, instead of Cheddar.  It was really delicious and couldn't be simpler - thanks!

My husband said "this is the best meal I have had in a long time"!  It was so good! I did it really easy by using frozen diced onion and premade mashed potatoes and mixed frozen veggies. Only dirtied two things! The pan to brown the beef and the casserole dish I cooked in! I also added wosterchire to the beef mix and paula deans house seasoning for a little seasong. It was very easy and very good! thanks for the new staple in my house!

I followed the recipe as is for the most part and it came out fantastic!  I preferred this without the worcestshire sauce that others have recommended and instead took the advice of others and added just a tablespoon and steak sauce and it came out wonderfully!  I also mashed the potatoes with garlic butter rather than the regular stuff and it was really really good!  Instead of the mashed carrots, I went with the frozen peas and carrots and mixed them in when the beef was simmering.  My family couldn't stop raving about how good it was!  Bon appetite!

I have never tasted Shepherds Pie before. I just have to say that this is so delicious. It will become one of my family's favorites. I agree with one of the previous comments, it is perfect comfort food. Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe.

Good dinner recipe. Great comfort food. I added mixed veggies (beans, carrots, peas, corn) instead of the carrots layer and since I was out of shredded Chedder I subbed some American and Mozzerella. The recipe was good as directed but lacks a little flavor in the potatoes. I took some advice and put the Worcestershire in the meat as it cooked as well as 2 cloves of garlic. I'm sensitive to salt, so did not try the gravy recommendation. I will try it with the sourcream recommendation in the potatos next time for more flavor.

5 stars, says the boyfriend! I followe advice about the packet of gravy, and only changed two other things-- I used Parmesan instead of Cheddar, because that is what Cheesecake Factory does (which is his fav), and I added frozen peas. Great comfort food, and good for leftovers!

Took the advice of others and added 1/4 c. worstershire sauce to the meat mixture for some extra flavor.  Also added peas and carrots, will throw in other veggies next time depending on what I have. This was excellent!

This was so much easier to make than I could ever have imagined.  After coming home late from work one night and having two hungry mouths to feed (husband and 6 year old son), I was looking for something quick and easy but very tasty.  My husband is from Northern Ireland, and I thought this would be a great dish to try on him.  He ate a large first helping and then went back for seconds!  This is great!  I'm looking forward to trying it again!!

This recipe is also great with venison!  I didn't mash the carrots, I used instant garlic mashed potatoes, and added 1/2 can of peas, 1/2 can corn. DELICIOUS. Hubby loved it. Will make again!

I cooked the beef with brown gravy mix, 1 T soy sauce, and 1 T. worcestshire as suggested by others.  I also steamed carrots with green beans and did not mash them, which saved time.  Very good served with hot sauce.  I may try the French fried onions next time.

Yum!  I was looking for a recipe similar to the Shepherd's pie my husband's Mom used to make for him. He said this is very good and very similar - hooray!  I, too, used instant mashed potatoes for ease and speed. I also added a heaping tsp of Emeril's Steak seasoning to the ground beef. I put a can of corn and a small can of carrots on top of the meat, followed by the potatoes. It was very tasty and I'll make it again!

My boyfriend, the picky eater, loved it. He said it's even better than any shepherd's pie he has ever eaten in a restaurant. I used sour cream instead of butter for the mashed potatoes and add frozen peas and chopped bell peppers. It was yummy.

I've been searching for a while for a dish that my mother made when I was growing up and this is it! I followed other users' suggestions of browning the meat with 1/4 c. Worcestershire sauce and adding a pack of brown gravy to the meat. This made a nice thick sauce which was great with the potatoes. Put a thin layer of shredded cheddar on top of meat mixture, then 2 cans of green beans, followed by a cover of instant mashed potatoes (saves time!). Topped with more shredded cheddar. Yum!

I have only had Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie before, but this was great. Followed alterations with the gravy and water. Made a nice thick meaty sauce. I also added some sour cream and increased the butter to 3 Tbsp to the mashed potatoes. Two year old loves mashed potatoes but turned her nose up at this dish. Her loss...

Great recipe- I did make some changes, and it turned out perfectly!  Hubby raved & our toddler ate all he could hold.  Instead of the beef broth, I used a cup of water & packet of beef gravy mix, and omitted the ketchup.  Instead of carrots I used green beans & peas.  I didn't have any shredded Cheddar, so I cut up some American singles, and that worked like a charm.  The gravy gave the beef some substance, and the American melted so wonderfully on top of it all.  Two thumbs up!

This recipe was awesome. The only thing i changed was combining sliced carrots, canned green beans, and corn in between the meat and mash potato. Other than that, everything was perfect!!! This is a keeper.

The taste is ok. Considering it only has a couple ingredients. The kids liked it. Very simple/inexpensive to make.

very good, basic shepherd's pie.  I didn't bother whipping the carrots and I added peas, and mixed them both in with the meat.  I also got lazy and used a jar of gravy (I wanted to avoid the preservatives all the packets seemed to have).. very easy.  my husband's favorite comfort food!

I thought this recipe was very good, my husband didn't care for it, but he's not a casserole type of guy.  I used the package of brown gravy mix with water as suggested by other reviews.  I also used some frozen peas, canned whole kernel corn, cut up some baby carrots, and used fresh green beans from the garden instead of mashed carrots.  I put together the day before and put in oven an hour just before serving.  Very Filling.

This was a easy meal to make.  I made a few changes such as sauted the onions, cooked the diced carrots in microwave for two minutes then sauted with the onions added green pepper and a jalepeno pepper and garlic.  Used dry broth and Joes stuff.  Really good!

This is a basic cottage pie recipe. I like the call for mashing the veggies, it fits better in the cassorole dish! Serve this with flaky buttery bread and it is a great meal for the cold days!

I followed the recipe closely, but made changes to the potatoes.  I seasoned them with salt, cheese, butter, milk and prepared them as if I were making stuffed potatoes.  Then placed it on top of the meat.  I added some worchestire and garlic to the meat.  Those are the only changes I made and turned out great.

I consider myself a pretty good cook, as do others, but I had to have messed this up, even though it was easy to make. This was not to my liking at all.  It had no taste and the proportion of potatoes to beef was very lopsided.  I won't even try to "doctor" this up again.  I'll look for another recipe.

This was my first time to ever eat Shepherds Pie and I thought it was great. This is the recipe I will use from now on. The only thing I did different was add brown gravy to the beef mixture ( I left out the beef broth and flour ), and I used chopped fresh baby carrots, mixed with corn and peas.

I don't generally like shepherd's pie but made this recipe with sausage instead of ground beef for the meat.  It was very tasty and I even craved the leftovers!  It did, however, seem to take me forever to put it together -- significantly longer than specified by the author.

Always wary of trying new casseroles (I've had so many flops), but this was actually very tasty.  My husband even commented that my 'experiment' turned out delicious.  I didn't have any fresh potatoes, so I substituted potato buds and it turned out pretty decent.

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day dinner group and everyone raved about it!  I will make this again!  I made a few changes as others suggested:  added worchestire sauce, more ketchup, a package of gravy mix (and kept the flour), and used a 1 lb. bag of frozen peas and carrots rather than fresh/mashed carrots!  It was tasty, tasty!  Will make again.

This is a great recipe.  I was looking for something different to make with ground beef.  I have never made a shepherd's pie before so this was a great one to start with.  I did change it up some since I only had 3 potatoes and they were red potatoes, added an extra 1/2 lb ground beef, about 2 cups green beans and some garlic. Another keeper from All Recipes!

This was excellent!  I added a brown gravy packet as some suggested as well as sauteed green peppers and onion into the meat. I used ground pork instead of beef and cut the carrots into bits intstead of mashing them.  It turned out really well!

We really enjoyed this.  I think it's a great base recipe to which you can add whatever your family prefers.  I chose to use some diced carrots in the ground beef and added garlic and some other spices as well.  Next time I have leftover mashed potatoes, I'll make this for sure because making it all from scratch was way too time consuming for me!  All and all a great meal:D

This was suprisingly good.  I never thought I would like Sheperd's Pie but I was wrong.  I made mine a little different.  I used 1 lb. ground beef, 1 lb. ground sausage, 1 C beef broth, 2 tbls. Worchester sauce, and 1 tbls. of flour.  I left my carrots 1/2 mashed and 1/2 whole.  I blended them for 5 seconds just to get them a little mashed.  I topped mine with Mexican Cheese only b/c I did not have Cheddar Cheese.  It all turned out so well.  My 2 year old daughter had 2nd helpings!  I will make this one again and again.

A very good Shepherd's pie.  I just diced carrots and cooked in with the ground meat along with frozen peas and corn.

This was very good!  I did make a few changes.  I used instant mashed potatoes and I cooked the carrots with the beef instead of mashing them.  What I liked about it most was that it kept it's shape when cut, it did not glop all over the plate.  Will be making again!

My husband asks for shepherds pie all the time but I never thought it sounded appetizing so I never made it- but then he asked me to make it for his birthday and how could I refuse then! I'm glad I gave in- it was really good, he loved it too! Thanks

My British husband raved about this dish. I made it exactly according to the redipe and it turned out really well. It even handled well for serving. I would highly recommend this rexipe.

Great recipe, husband ate it all up. 
I think the mushed carrots were kinda pointless, might as well just add frozen mixed vegis like others did and forget the mashed carrots altogether. Added worchestire and 2 cloves of garlic to meat(probably a little too garlicky for most but we are garlic fiends here). Also added sourcream to potatoes. I think what would really make the potatoes standout would be to also add maybe half to a whole small block of cream cheese.
  If none of the changes were made it most likely would of been to bland for my taste, hence the 4 stars.

Once again, I have found another favorite that is going to be apart of my household for years.  I did change it up some, I didn't use carrots, used two cans of peas and carrots, and I added the gravy to the meat like other had suggested instead of the broth.  My hubby had never heard of Shepherds Pie before, so he was a little nervous...but HE LOVED IT!!  
Thanks for the recipe!!!

My kids loved this.  I made a few alterations.  Browned meat, onions, pepper, and garlic salt.  Added canned peas and carrots to meat and sauce.  Made potatoes with just salt, pepper and butter.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Really good when you want to use up a pound of hamburger.  It fed Mom, Dad, 2 kids and a lunch the next day.

good.  the kids liked it too, so bonus points!  i didn't bother with the carrot puree, just threw the chopped carrots in with the beef mixture, and i used the potato mixture (except i cut the butter dramatically) from the recipe for "easy shepherd's pie with garlic romano potatoes."  thought this might address the "bland" comment a lot of reviewers had.  and it did.  it was good.

I used white turkey meat, added the worsh. sauce and garlic to the meat.  I thought it was pretty good but I've never had real shepherd's pie before.  my husband, however, who asked me to make this didn't care for it at all. he said it didn't taste like shepherd's pie and it was missing something.   maybe if I added the real meat?  not sure.

Yummy & filling.  Made the recipe even easier by using instant mashed potatoes and spiced it up by adding 4-5 dashes of Emeril's Original Essence spice.  Will make again.  Thanks!

I love how easy this is to make, and it was a big hit with my family. i didn't mash the carrots, i just added frozen sliced carrots to the meat mixture. Next time i make this (and i will, over and over) i will definitely just make regular ol' mashed taters, with some milk to thin them. without the milk they were a little too pasty. I will also add some seasonings as it's a little bland. this is a perfect fall/winter comfort food! thanks so much!

Everyone liked this, I thought it was a little bland.  Next time I might add the worsteshire (sp?) sauce or try beef gravy instead of beef broth or add minced garlic.  I didn't mash the carrots (yuck), added some leftover corn I had, and had to sneak a little milk into the potatoes.

I am not a really big fan of shepherds pie but this was just awesome. I made a few adjustments:  I added a little sour cream to the mashed potatoes, garlic and crumbled sausage to the hamburger mixture, nixed the carrots and used canned corn instead.  Delicious!!!

Awesome!  This has much more flavour than the shepherd's pie I'm used to making.  It disappeared really fast too, as my wife and daughter both wanted seconds.  I'll definitely be making this one again.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Delicous and great to freeze.  I used canned carrots and did not mash them just to save time.  I also added a can of corn and worsteshire sauce.  It was a hit!

This is great.  Leftovers are good and I even had some to freeze for later.  I added corn to the meat mixture.  It would be good with any other veggies on hand as well.  Thanks for this recipe!  Our toddler loved it!

My husband & I thought this was boring. I added more cheese, and left out the onion because I don't like onions. My kids didn't like it, and they are not picky eaters.

This recipe was really good.  But much like the other members, I also added something extra.  I added a tablespoon of the Montreal Steakhouse Rub marinade.  It tasted great!

Everyone loved this dish in my family except my two year old who is a little carnivore (Rosie). Overall it was a good filler upper dish. Maybe I will serve rosie the meat sauce with some pasta next time as the meat was very delicious and savory.

Wow..That was so much better than my bland shepherd's pie.  I gave it a 4 because I didn't follow it exactly.  I added garlic to the meat as well as A-1 sauce. I was hesitant about the A-1 but listened to a couple reviewers and tried it and wow it adds great taste.  I also added corn and a little more gravy.  My 3 year old loved it.

4 stars because i didn't like the meat that much, however, there's potential. This is one of those dishes you can adjust in so many ways...
I cooked potatoes and carrots together and mashed them together as well. I also added some sour cream to the mashed potatoes/carrots.

I made this recipe at home as a trial before maybe using it for a dinner series I'm catering. I usually make my everyday shepherd's pie with ground beef and packaged gravy, topped with corn and mashed potatoes - not very exciting! I was much more pleased with the gravy that forms with this recipe; it's got a great flavor. I'm not sure about the mashed carrot layer. It added a sweetness that I'm not sure I'm crazy about, and of course it does add more time to the prep. I'll probably leave that out next time and put in a layer of mixed veggies or corn. More effort than my usual recipe, but definitely worth it. I will be making it this week for my catered dinner. Thanks!

This is really good. My whole picky family likes it!! I add a little half & half to the potatoes to make them creamier. and wash dishes(or have your teenager do it!) as you go along. I've made it several times just as is. Next time I am going to add peas on top of the meat.

I added 3T soy sauce, 1 T garlic, and salt and pepper to the meat.  Still could use more flavor.  I put chopped carrots, frozen corn and frozen peas on top of the meat, then the potatoes, then 1/4 c. shredded cheddar.  Baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  Definitely a good comfort food.

The flavor of this dish was good, the presentation wasn't all that great. My husband liked it, but wasn't crazy about how it looked on the plate. I used frozen peas and carrots mixed in the beef instead of mashing the carrots on a layer, and used red potatoes.  I will play with this one, and try to improve on the look for next time!

This is a perfect meal when you want something simple yet filling.  The great thing about it is that you can substitute things that you like or add more or less of any layer (no, I didn't do that; I followed the recipe exactly and rated it off the recipe given!)  I think I am going to try it next time with either corn or corn and carrots mixed in the middle layer.  I think I might also try it one time with just the meat and potatoes (at my scottish husband's suggestion!).  But it tastes great just the way it is!

Delicious!!  I ended up with exactly what I wanted.  I cooked the onions with the beef and added some worcester sauce.  I also added corn.  I thought the flour and broth worked fine for a gravy.  Topped with instant potatoes with sour cream.  It's a keeper.

Bf request shepherd's pie, and I never had it before so I used this recipe.  Very nice. I took others suggestions and didn't mash the carrots but added frozen mixed veggies to the beef and used gravy.
Will use again.

This was delicious!  I used corn and mixed veggies since I didn't have any carrots on hand, and I added some green peppers and garlic to the onions before I added the beef.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

We enjoyed this. I prefer this with mixed veggies instead of only carrots however.  So, I just add frozen mixed vegetables to the boiling potato water until they are crisp tender and then drain and then use instead of the mashed carrots that the recipe calls to make. My husband enjoyed as leftovers for a lunch too. I would like to try to use mashed sweet potatoes sometime instead of the carrots too; it might be good.

i just think i'm not a huge fan of sheperds pie. my partner liked this pretty alright though.
i took the suggestions and added the brown gravy as well as some frozen vegetables to it as well.
i also added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce like others suggested as well...which i think gave it a really odd taste.

This was pretty good after a few suggested changes.  I used gravy mix instead of beef broth, didn't mash the carrots, used frozen mixed veggies, and only used 3 medium sized potatoes.  Hubby asked to have it again soon.

Using other viewers suggestions, it was very easy and very tasty.  This has become a regular in our house for those quick supper nights.  Added worchestershire to the beef, used package of brown gravy instead of beef broth, chopped carrots and peas for the veggies, and instant garlic mashed potatoes.  Excellent!

This recipe is pretty good.  I didn't mash the carrots.  I diced them in the food processor and added them to the ground beef/onion/sauce mixture. The sauce wasn't quite what I was expecting. Also, I found that 4 large potatoes made WAY more mashed potato than I needed for this recipe. 2 potatoes would have been enough. Also, it's pretty good when frozen and reheated.

Excellent! I've made this a handful of times and it's great every time. I followed the suggestion about using gravy instead of beef broth and it really adds a little kick. This is a great comfort food for cold evenings.

It was very yummy and super easy to make. My husband loved it because it was "meat and potatoes" I loved it becasue my toddler ate it!  The only thing I didn't love was how many pans and bowls I ended up using. :( I STILL have to do the dishes.

This is a good recipe if you already have leftover mashed potatoes.  For me, it seemed like a lot of steps and dishes to wash.  My other problem was that the carrots (which I boiled for a long time) never got soft enough to mash with a fork.  Next time, I will wait until I already have mashed potatoes, and I will keep a can of carrots handy until I figure out exactly how to make them into mush.  I really had hoped to mix the carrot mush in with the meat so my 3-year-old wouldn't even notice it. But I will try it again with some alterations.

I read other reveiws and replaced the beef broth with brown gravy and 1 cup of a water.  I also added green beans to the meat, which I probably won't do that next time. I lessened the ketchup and added worcestershire sauce.  I will definitely make this again but will add additional gravy.

This is a great, easy recipe. I usually omit the carrots and add kernel corn and/or green beans. I've also substituted sweet potatoes for the white potatoes (I recommend trying this sometime...it tastes really good and is better for you). I also add a whole onion to the meat and sometimes sliced mushrooms. I followed the advice of others and also added gravy mix to the "sauce". 

I've made this many times. It's a very versatile recipe, and you can add pretty much any veggie to it and it'll be delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved it!  I used several of the suggestions made by other reviews...gravy mix, extra cheese and frozen veggies.  Husband can hardly wait for me to make it again.

This really worked out nicely. I had left over mashed potatoes from last night's dinner, so I used them for the topping. Instead of carrots, I used fresh corn, (cut off the cob from our garden) and fresh green beans, also from the garden. I made the gravy using vegetable broth, added worchestire sauce, and ketchup. 

Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out quite nice. My husband liked it, but said there might need to be a little more gravy. I cooked the carrots, but not long enough and I think I liked it that way because there was still some chunky carrots. I also added peas and for the mashed potatoes I used hot milk and butter to mash them. The onion was a little overpowering in the potatoes so I might just do the cheese next time. I used worcestershire sauce, but I don't think I'll do that again. I'll just add the ketchup. Overall a good recipe and actually tastes better the next day.

It was quite tasty, but next time I think I'll add a layer of peas and/or corn to give it more texture. Still, a delicious and filling dish.

This is a really tasty recipe, so glad I came across it! I use potato buds in place of the real ones because I'm a new mom and, well, I actually like them, haha. I also add a cup of frozen mixed vegetables to the hamburger to get the greens in. Enjoy!

This is a very good recipe for shepherd's pie. I've tried many different recipes and I believe this is my favorite. It's a great family dish. Thank you.

I think this was a very good shepherd's pie! I have made it with the carrots, but once I had only frozen mixed veggies, so I popped that in the food processor to mash it after cooking and used it. I actually like that a lot better than the carrots! Not as pretty, but much more flavor, and healthier too! I also season my ground beef with garlic salt, emeril's essence, and my mashed potatoes with white pepper, butter, condensed milk (it makes it creamy), & a bit of garlic salt.

This was really good and my teens loved it. 2 of the 3 teens would have balked at the carrots, so I left them out, but I made the potatoes more like traditional mashed potatoes with milk and a little more butter so it wouldn't be too dry and it turned out great.

This is an excellant recipe...my family just loved it. My husband told me to double the recipe next time.
I followed another review, and instead of broth, I used brown gravy..which gave the ground beef mixture more flavor. I also added paprika and cayenne pepper to the beef. I didn't use the ketchup or brothe. I added a can of peas and carrots. I used cheddar and monterey jack cheese, and I sprinkled oregano on top. Great flavor...my husband wants me to make it again..like today.

This recipe is delicious just the way it says to prepare it.  My only thought afterwards was that next time I will try the potatoes without as much butter and use the cheese as directed.

This was quite good.  My parents were in town and I cooked this for them, and they claimed it was better than the shepherd's pie that my mom used to make.  My only complaints echo others on the board.  (1) It is a little bland.  (But that is part of the nature of shepherd's pie.)  (2)  The mashed potatoes on top were a little dry compared to what I'd prefer.

I used ground venison for this recipe and doubled the cheese.  My husband thought it was fantastic and said he wouldn't mind even more cheese next time.  Definitely a hit - tastes better the next day.

I made as described with the following adjustments: used frozen corn and peas (cooked) instead of carrots) and added a splash of worcestershire to the beef mixture.  The potatoes were excellent and the presentation was very nice, but I found the meat portion a little bland and thought it could have used more sauce/gravy to be a true Shepherd's Pie.  May try again with further adjustments, more seasonings, more gravy.
Update 2/15:  Made again following reviews.  Added 1/4 cup worcestershire, a packet of brown gravy mix, a cup of water and a splash of red wine to the beef mixture.  Used frozen peas and carrots (should have cooked a bit first as the carrots were a bit crunchy).  Added sour cream to potatoes and cheese only to top.  Very yummy on a cold winter night.

This was good, DH and I both enjoyed it.  I didn't add onion to the potatoes or mash the carrots, and I did add a can of corn but those were the only changes.  Next time I won't add the cheese to the top (we didn't think it was really needed) and instead will add a few splashes of worchestershire sauce to the top of potatoes and a couple of pats of butter. It's very good that way!!  Anyway, it seems like a lot of changes but that is what is so great about a recipe like this...you can always alter it to suit your tastes!

I thought that this recipe was very tasty, however I agree with another reviewer that the prep and cleanup was a little more than I expected. Also, I had problems mashing the carrots. I boiled them forever and seemed to never get them soft enough. I did use baby carrots, if that makes a difference. But all in all it was a good recipe and everything was very tasty.
