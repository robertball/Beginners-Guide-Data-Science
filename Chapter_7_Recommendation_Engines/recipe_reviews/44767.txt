These were surprisingly excellent!  I am on Weight Watchers and was looking for a healthier alternative to traditional pancakes.  Using solely whole wheat flour (eliminated the all-purpose flour) gave these a nuttier flavor, but they were so light and fluffy.  I substituted 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the butter and used 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp. Splenda instead of sugar.  I used skim milk instead of the dry milk powder and water and also added 2 tsp. flax seed and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  If the batter is too runny, it can be thickened with a little extra flour.  These freeze and reheat very well for a quick and filling breakfast.  Great with no-sugar maple syrup and turkey sausage links!!

These pancakes are delicious although we modified them to make them a bit fluffier and also healthier!  We changed the butter to 1/3 cup of applesauce.  We eliminated the water and used fat free milk, and a 1/2 tsp vanilla.  We also added some wheat germ!  They were delicious and the kids loved them!

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half & used whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour. Used 1/3 cup Splenda & even for me, with a notorious sweet tooth, thinks that 1/4 cup is plenty! Used 3/4 cup milk & 1/2 cup water. Added 2 tsp cinn & upped the vanilla to 1 tsp. Used 3 tbsp applesauce. I like my pancakes to be not to thick but not TOO thin & this worked perfectly. Loved the healthy ingredients. Thank you!

I’m giving this 5 stars even though I made several modifications. It’s a great recipe! My changes are: 1 1/2 C non-fat buttermilk and 3/4 C water instead of milk powder and water (I actually increased the water even more because my family likes thin pancakes with crisp edges, but for most it would probably be too thin). I also decreased regular flour from 1 C to 1/2C, and then added 1/4C flax seed meal, 1/4C wheat germ. Added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, too. Like other reviewers, I cut way down on the sugar (to slightly less than 1/2 C and also used honey for most of the sweetener). These were excellent pancakes. My husband is usually leery of the taste of “non-traditional” pancakes, but he gave it high praise. And my children gobbled them up. This has become my preferred pancake recipe!

Totally like my Dad's pancakes. We had these every Saturday for years and it was worth the wait every Saturday just to have them. I made three small changes; I used all whole wheat flour, I upped the baking powder to 3 teaspoons and I only used just under a 1/4 cup of sugar. I might cut back the sugar even more next time but these were awesome. Really light and fluffy and just......AWESOME. This might be my new go-to pancake recipe.  NOTE: This recipe makes a TON so if you're like me, you can freeze the pancakes in batches on a flat baking sheet and portion out into freezer bags for days you don't want to make a hot breakfast from beginning to end.

We loved these "healthier" pancakes.  I used applesauce instead of butter and splenda instead of sugar and was pleased with the result.  I thought they were great without syrup as well.  I made the full batch and froze the leftovers in little packages of 3 pancakes for individual microwave breakfasts on the run and they were great.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

An excellent and nutritious breakfast!  I make them in batch and freeze between wax paper sheets - easy to heat up in the toaster or microwave for a quick snack.  For variety I occasionally add fresh or frozen fruit at the last second before cooking.  For fluffiest  pancakes, wait until just before cooking to mix dry and wet ingredients and just fold in, don't stir too much.

This pancake recipe was delicious!  I omitted the butter and added 1/4 cup of applesauce and it still turned out great.  My 2 year old said, "Mommy, I love these!" and he ate 3 of them!  I will use this from now on!

I really liked these! Quartered the recipe and ended up with 5 pancakes which was perfect. Use all whole wheat flour and you'll be fine - instead of just adding water, I used 1% milk (why not, right?!), skipped the butter, and added vanilla. Served with honey butter and homemade rhubarb compote. What a yummy start to the morning!

This are the BEST!!! I just made them, but made some slight modifications, I used skim milk instead of water, I used 10 little equal pachages for the sugar ( you can use splenda that is the best for baking, and cooking, but equal worked wonderfully), and also the flour: I used 2 cups of STONE GROUND WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR, (STONE GROUND is much better for you... because whole wheat by itself it means, that the flour is already processed, and is as bad as White flour) I did'nt use dry milk powder, didn't use vinegar, and also didn't use white flour. used some butter pam Spray, and YUMMY!!!!! topped with sugar free syrup, and a little bit of butter

I also changed a few things.  I skipped the sugar and added 1/4 cup of applesauce for the butter.   I didn't sift the dry ingredients and found that this made it VERY lump  (my bad).  The flavor was exceptional!  will make many more times.  Made A LOT of cakes!

These turned out fantastic.  My version that my family liked the most was an adaptation to the recipe where the butter was replaced with Applesauce and milk was used instead of water.  I kept the vanilla, and I added about tablespoon of cinnamon and 2 chopped apples.

Wow!  Even my little ones gobbled these up.  Very tasty.  I used applesauce instead of butter and didn't miss the butter one single bit.  They were light and thin pancakes, but that's the way I like them.

Pleasantly surprised! Needed to find a recipe to use up my whole wheat flour! This is definatly a keeper! Thought the batter looked a bit runny at first, but they were the most light and fluffiest pancakes I've ever made!! My 4yr old at 3 of them :) Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

When I made them today, I didn't have powdered milk, so I substituted 1% milk for for water and powdered milk. I was very pleasedwith the pancakes as I was looking for a recipe using whole wheat.

We had run out of milk and these worked out great.  I did add in a good amount of flax seed and some vanilla.  I forgot the sugar and they were still great.

This is outstanding!  My dad is diabetic, and the substitution of Splenda for sugar makes this work beautifully. Plus, they freeze so nicely that we have these available at a moments notice.    Cut the recipe in half for four persons and still have some for the freezer.

I made these exactly as the recipe states only I didn't add the butter-the batter was so thin and watery. I added a whole extra cup of whole wheat flour and it was still super thin. I can't imagine how it would be if I had added the fourth cup of butter. They didn't taste bad though but it took forEVER to make them all. If I try it again I'll probably cut the water way down. Also I measure flour with a scale rather than using measuring cups so that may have had something to do with it.

Fantastic. DIdn't need syrup or anything. I did make some adjustments based on the reviews of others. I used applesauce instead of the butter and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Would recommend this recipe to anyone who is trying to eat healthy but is not willing to sacrafice taste.

I love pancakes made with whole wheat much more than my kids do, but they loved these just as much as I did. I also used 1 1/2 c milk and 3/4 c water instead of the powdered milk, and dropped a few blueberries in some of them. These have a really good flavor and texture. Thanks!

First time I used whole wheat flour for pancakes but I really liked the texture.  Even hubby who hates pancakes from pre-mix (such as Bisquick) said it was good.  Will be making this often from now on.

Delicious and easy to make! Others are correct by warning that the batter is thin (I actually add a little extra whole wheat flour to thicken just a bit) but the pancakes turn out light and tasty.

Good recipe!  They kind of stuck to my frying pans, which are black non-stick but they tasted great and we ate all of them (2 adults, 3 little kids)!  Yummy!

The batter was very, very thin and pancakes burned very quickly when cooked on medium heat, per the directions.  Added 3 Tablespoons more wheat flour and turn down burners which helped.  Tasted fine but nothing out of the ordinary.

Great flavor and fluffy!  Cut the recipe in half and made 10 pancakes using 1/4 cup batter/pancake.  Used all whole wheat flour, 3 T unsweetened applesauce instead of butter, 1 c water, 2 T sugar and the rest splenda, added 2 t cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract.

Make sure you check the number of servings. The recipe as written makes a ton! They freeze well and heat up in a toaster just fine.

This recipe of pancakes tasted wonderful.  There really is no need to put anything on them since they are already so sweet.  The only problem I had is that they burned even at a really low heat.  This did not appear to affect the taste though. I certainly plan to try them again.  My husband even liked them.

I just got done making these for breakfast. Yummm! These are so good. I am on a diet so i took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the white flour and used all whole wheat flour. Instead of the butter I used cinnamon applesauce and I only had 3 eggs but they turned out fine. I also added some vanilla about a tsp or so, a little bit of cinnamon and i used skim milk in place of the powdered and water(only 2 cups though). Excellent recipe so healthy and delicious with a bit of sugar free syrup. yielded about 10 large pancakes.

This recipe makes much better whole grain pancakes than others I've tried.  Sure, they're not completely whole grain because of the white flour, but they turn out tender and just the right thickness.  I make them with lots of blueberries, and my whole family loves them.  The recipe made exactly 28 pancakes for me, so we saved them for breakfasts the following week.  My toddler can eat 3 or 4 in one sitting!  And for those of you on Weight Watchers, these have a points value of 2 per pancake.  Not bad!

These are great pancakes!  Much, much better than a mix!  I added 1 tblspn cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp nutmeg and about 1/4 cup wheat germ.  My family loved them.  I ate mine without syrup, just butter and a bit of powdered sugar.  This recipie does make a TON of pancakes, so if you aren't cooking for a crowd, or don't want leftovers, split it in half.

These are a real hit - especially with the little people. We have them every single week! I have no milk powder, so I use 1 1/2 cups milk and cut the water to 3/4 of a cup. It was perfect. If you aren't cooking for a tribe, you may want to halve the recipe, it makes a lot of pancakes.

My husband has a very busy schedule and a horrible diet, but always has pancakes for breakfast (from a mix). He loved this recipe which makes enough for me to freeze a weeks worth, and it gets some whole grain fiber in his tummy! Yeah!

We loved this recipe!  The cool thing about this website is the ability to scale down (or up) all of the recipes.  In this recipe I scaled it down to 10 servings, next time I'll make more!  These were gone like...Hotcakes!

Really good pancakes--and I didn't think I could make good pancakes!  Subbed 1/2 cup Splenda for the 3/4 cup sugar and they were perfect.  The full batch makes a lot of pancakes, but they really taste quite good when frozen and reheated in the microwave.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe!!! I have used 3/4 cup whole ground flaxseed meal instead of the melted butter and they were just as wonderful. Splenda can be substituted for the sugar as well.You can tell that I am hanging on to this recipe!!!Thanks for sharing!

These were really, really good. You could leave out the sugar if you didn't want the extra sweetness or if you are watching calories/sugar intake. I fed these to my three kiddos (2, 3, 5) and they gobbled them right up! Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I changed it slightly to suit my diabetic food plan.
I used 1/4 cup canola oil in place of the melted butter, and 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp. Splenda as had already been suggeted.
These fluffed up nicely, were not heavy at all. Very filling though! 
They also browned up just like regular white flour pancakes. 
All in all a great recipe, thank you for sharing.

My family loved these pancakes.  I only used 1/2 c sugar instead of the full 3/4 and I still found them slightly too sweet.  325 on the griddle was the perfect temperature for them to brown nicely but still cook thoroughly inside.  Great recipe!

Excellent! I did modify just a bit. Added some ground flax seed,oatmeal and walnuts and decreased the amount of white flour. Used 1% milk instead of the powder. Froze the remaining leftovers. Thumbs up from everyone and they didn't even know how nutritious they were.

A 5 with the following changes:  Omit water and milk powder and use 1-1 1/4 c skim milk, decrease sugar to 1/2c and sub 4oz applesauce for the oil.  The recipe makes a lot but they freeze well.

I have tried many of the store bought wheat mixes - yuck.  These pancakes are awesome.  I used applesauce instad of the butter and added bit of vanilla extract. These freeze well, after defrosting I heated them up them toaster oven and microwave (surprisingly they were not rubbery).  Thank you

I used apple sauce instead of oil, and Splenda in place of the sugar.  I also cut the water down by 1/2 c because most reviews here said the batter was a little runny.  With these changes, my pancakes turned out pretty fluffy, and very good.  My husband said you could eat them without syrup!  I put leftovers in the freezer for a quick breakfast.  Using a 1/4 cup as my scooper, I only ended up with 20 pancakes, but that was more than enough.  Thanks for the good, healthy recipe.

I really liked these pancakes. They turn out the way I like pancakes: thin, sweet and moist. From now on I am going to use this recipe.

I wanted to try something a little healthier than the Good Old Fashioned Pancakes recipe from this site that we have been using for over a year but i wasn't sure my kids would go for the switch to whole grain. THEY LOVED THEM and asked for seconds.  I liked them too but next time will try cutting the sugar. They were a little too sweet for my taste but i'm not a big sugar fan.

These are great! I added a half cup more wheat flour and a littel vanilla to the mix. They are so good you can eat them without syrup. My one year old loved them and I felt good about what she was eating!

These are pretty good. They do come out very thin and this recipe makes A LOT of pancakes! They freeze nicey though, just toss them in the toaster in the morning.

These are great pancakes.  They are also a delicious way to get some whole grains into your diet.  I tried them spread with blueberry preserve because they came out very thin for me. Very tasty!

I followed another reviewers suggestions and used all
whole wheat flour, no white flour, and I increased the 
baking soda to 3 teaspoons.  Very good recipe, definitely a
keeper!

These are the most delicious pancakes. I'm a pancake FREAK, but I rarely make them because of their calorie dense ways. These are a contrast to typical multigrain cakes. I expect the secret is powdered milk + vinegar opposed to the standard buttermilk. Amazing! Try them!

I use this recipe as a general guideline, sometimes  I mix around the flour amounts or type of flour used.  Perfect recipe for using up the buckwheat flour in my pantry. :)

this recipe was great! I loved the texture of the pancake, it was just the right amount of chewiness.  I followed the recipe exactly and it worked very well.  One thing I found though is that the sugar content of the recipe is quite high, so they can burn more easily.  So I cooked the pancakes on lower heat and they turned out great! I also wonder if I could just use butermilk instead of the milk pwdr/vinegar/water combo.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly and added alot of cinnamon, probably 1/2 Tablespoon or more.  They were wonderful.  The batter was pretty runny, but turned into large tasty pancakes.  Very yummy, thanks.

Delicious!! We love pancakes and have only been buying mixes.  Now my 3 and 4 yr. olds have a more nutritious recipe and use less syrup because it has a great taste already. Also subsituted milk powder with 1 1/2 cups milk and cut the water to 3/4.  Will try again with apple sauce in place of butter.  Froze them for toaster reheat later.  Very Good and Healthy!

I can't have dairy right now, so left out the powdered milk and butter.  I was going to sub oil, then applesause, then oil, then forgot to do either!  I added artificial butter flavoring and brown sugar flavored splenda instead of the sugar.  The pancakes came out a little flat, which is how my husband likes them, and nicely sweetened, which is how my kids like them!  Great flavor!

These are tasty for wheat pancakes. I did make a few changes... Used only 1/2 cup sugar (and this was plenty),Used 1/3 cup applesauce in place of the butter, added 2 teas vanilla and a full Tablespoon of cinnamon. When I make them again I will only use 3 eggs as the batter is a bit runny and a bit "eggy" for our tastes. All in all very yummy and with no butter-low fat. Oh and this did make almost exactly 28 pancakes.

These pancakes are wonderful.  They are very tender and light, which is rarely associated with whole wheat.  They cook up thinner than a buttermilk pancake, so don't expect them to be thick and fluffy.  They almost have a hint of french toast taste to them.  Excellent.
