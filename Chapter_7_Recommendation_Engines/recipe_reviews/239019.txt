I have made these several times and the one thing I did change was I used 1/2 cup of home made chunky applesauce instead of the apple cider. It totally makes them amazing, you do end up using about a cup more flour, but they were so good everyone keeps asking me to make more, more  and more!!! I also instead of glazing them when still slightly warm shake them in a bag of regular white sugar and lot's of cinnamon. My husbands first comment was These are better than my Mom's !! Since we are all Vermonters and cider is one of our greatest joys as well as fall apples. These I would recommend to anyone whom love apples and donuts because you will be in Heaven once you have had these. 
Thanks , Angie

I followed the recipe as written  and while it was easy to prepare the recipe really lacked overall flavor and  didn't taste anything like apples or apple cider, they were overall flavorless.

Great recipe for cake cider donuts. I didn't glaze them, just coated in cinnamon sugar while still warm because that's how the  farm stand near my house does it. I'm not very skilled at frying, but I was able to make this recipe without any difficulty. Make sure you reduce the cider to 1/4 cup (measure it!) and use real apple cider (not juice or cider from concentrate) for best flavor.
