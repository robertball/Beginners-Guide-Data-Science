Decrease water to 1C and cook rice with 1C salsa for added flavor. I also like to add browned ground beef or grilled chicken. Delicious!

I took a hint form Mama_C and added 1/2 pound Hamburger with my taco seasoning (chili powder, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder).  I used HEB Texas Style Borracho Beans.....Oh My! Yummy.  This will be a "what did you bring?" hit at the family parties.

Since I didn't have chili beans I used kidney beans that I had seasoned with Taco seasoning. I kept everything else the same. Both my husband and I enjoyed this variation to stove top rice and would fix it again.

I made the casserole as written but was concerned about the amount of flavor lacking in the ingredients. I was not wrong. If rewritten by me, I would add jalape√±os and/or sausage to kick it up a bit.  It had cheese and sour cream, but it was bland. Lots of calories and disappointing flavor.

I thought this was really good, but a little taco seasoning would probably help. It was a little soupy so I would recommend adding 1/4 cup water instead of 3/4 cup as instructed. I used brown instead of white rice and plain greek yogurt for the sour cream. No one ever notices, it's a great healthy substitution. I think adding corn or black beans would enhance the flavor as well and I'm always looking for ways to add veggies. I did add a bag of frozen peppers and onions. They were sliced but diced would have fit in better.

Great recipe,very forgiving!! Modified a bit,because of what I had on hand. Used a can of diced tomatoes, 1 can kidney beans drained, 1 can black bean undrained, browned up some ground beef ( about 1/2lb) with an onion. For seasonings: 1T chile powder, 1t each : oragano& cumin, 1/2t garlic powder, 1/4t chile pepper & a pinch of red pepper flakes. Instead of crushed tortillas I cut some flour tortillas into strips and put them on top of the sour cream lattice style, topped with cheese. Great base recipe,thanks for sparking an idea for a great supper. The whole family loved it.
