Everyone in our family loves this recipe.  I prepared it with vanilla pudding instead of chocolate.

This was a huge hit at my house! The second time I made it I added a tablespoon of chocolate instant pudding mix for extra chocolate - both ways went over well, both pies were gone in an hour! Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW this was great!  Not too peanut buttery, and with the perfect amount of chocolate.  Try it with a reduced fat graham crust, reduced fat crunchy peanut butter, skim milk for pudding and dream whip.  It tastes EXCELLENT!

This is delicious!  I've tried a few other peanut butter pies, and never liked them.  This one was perfect!

Very good pie and easy to make. Rich without being overwhelming. I may try next time using some lighter products such as reduced fat peanut butter, light cool whip, sugar free fat free pudding and maybe a graham cracker crust. Overall great pie, make sure you let it chill long enough though to setup properly.

This was a scrumptious pie I took it over as dessert for a dinner party.  There was none left which made me kinda sad because it was so good I wanted to take some home.

This was very tasty, and very easy. I used a refrigerated pie crust here, and pre-baked it before filling it with the rest of the ingredients. (This was the first time pre-baking - I'd always used these crusts in baked pies.) I also used heavy whipped cream. The friend I shared some of this with wants to give it a 5/5 rating, but I'll just give it 4/5. It's great, but I'm sure there are better pies. Still, I just may make this again, since the ease/taste ratio is so high. Thanks!

very delicious! I doubled the amount of the peanut butter mixture to make it more peanut buttery.  I used a graham cracker crust, and pressing the peanut butter mixture into the crust broke the crust up quite a bit, but the slices were still able to hold their shape pretty well when served.

So tasty! Really easy to make, I had everything on hand, this recipe made for a quick desert which everyone enjoyed, though I would have made more of the crumble for topping and extra flavor :)

SOOO Yummy. Friends stopped over and I hid the pie so they wouldn't eat the leftover pieces on me! It was so quick and easy, even with an active 6 month old.

This is the PB pie I grew up on, except we always used vanilla pudding and put it in a graham cracker crust  Delicious!
