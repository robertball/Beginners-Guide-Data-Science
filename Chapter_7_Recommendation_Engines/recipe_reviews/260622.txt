These turned out great! It's been awhile since I've been to Red Lobster but if my memory serves me right, these are the real deal. Down in the footnotes it mentions adding garlic powder and parsley to your butter. You want to be sure and do this if you are wanting a true copycat version.

Delicious!  Just a few small changes...I think it needs a little extra salt both in the biscuit itself, and also a little added to the garlic butter for the top.  Also, the biscuits will be more flaky if you pinch the cold butter into the flour mixture before you add the cheese...make it to where it’s pea sized lumps...and then add the cheese...and then add the milk and egg.   I also added extra cheese like another reviewer.  I didn’t have sharp cheddar, I only had a mild cheddar/Monterey jack mix, but sharp cheddar will be the bomb for next time.

Since I didn’t have any bisquick on hand, I was happy to find this recipe! Huge success!!!
I did alter a little for our taste preference. 
-For the wet ingredients, I beat the egg separately, and for the 2/3 cup milk, I combined 1/2 and 1/2 and 2% milk. 
-For the topping, I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic and a little more than 1/4 teaspoon of dried parsley, plus a pinch of salt. 
-For the dry ingredients I used about 1/2 the salt (since I was adding some into my melted butter), went heavy handed on the cheese and sprinkled a little extra of the garlic. 
It was amazing. Will definitely add this to my recipe go to file!

I love it BUT there is something missing with the butter. If you make as the recipe says you're putting a huge chunk of butter in the milk...??? Not sure if it's supposed to be softened or melted but....!!!

Things to note: I'm not a baker, nor do I bake as a hobby or have any life experience baking. I also made them at midnight, without access to all purpose flour or eggs. I replaced the all purpose flour, baking soda, and salt with two cups of self rising flour, and the egg with one and a half tbsp vegetable oil, one and a half tbsp water, and half a tsp baking powder. I also had to use granulated garlic instead of garlic powder (I don't think this made much of a difference). 

In the end, I could tell that the biscuits weren't quite right, but I'm 88% certain that was the fault of my own lack of the called for ingredients. Despite that, they were perfectly edible and I'll be making the recipe again when I do have the right ingredients. (Giving five stars because I don't think it'd be fair to give it four stars when I altered the recipe so heavily.)

OMG!  These turned out hogsome!  My men loved them.  Only changes I made were I added a tsp. of sugar to flour mixture and I melted butter and let it cool for a couple of minutes before combining with milk and egg.  I also grated my own cheddar and I did add the 1 tsp. of garlic powder and 2 tsp. of dried parsley to the melted butter to brush on top when they came out of the oven.

Maybe it's my oven, but I had to cook for 10 minutes longer to brown them. A bit salty for my taste, but could be the butter I chose too. I'm not sure if I'll make this recipe again.

I did not have cheddar so I used a mix of other cheeses.  Had the box mix of Red Lobster biscuits the night before.  These were almost as good -- have to fault the cheese here -- & more satisfying since I knew exactly what is in them.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I am sure I will make it again, & again!  I plan to try it with gluten free flour as well...    :)

The family agrees that these are very good and very close to the original recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly except for melting the butter  before mixing it with the milk and egg.

The biscuits were pretty dry and I had to add more garlic to the butter on top. I would add more salt, garlic,  and milk (maybe even half and half) to the batter.

Just made these! Pretty much the same thing as the boxed mix you can buy except it makes way more and way cheaper in the long run. Didn’t have any eggs so I made it without, and it came out delicious still. I would definitely make these again.

Pretty good texture, they were really fluffy. But a tiny bit dry? May go a little heavy on the wet ingredients next time. Also, do an extra tsp of garlic for the batter. And then for the topping, I would say you need more like 3 Tablesoons of butter and do just 1 tsp of parsley and up the garlic to 3 tsp. They were just a little lacking in moisture and garlic flavor but, with these little tweaks, this is going to be a winner for sure! Definitely making them again.

Very dry and crumbly. I didn't find there to be enough flavor, either, they were rather bland. I even doubled the garlic.. Not enough salt either, I'm not sure why everyone here is saying there's too much. Unless you're using salted butter,  this is not enough salt. Overall these are okay but I'd definitely play around with seasoning to give it more flavor in the future. Also note, these bake up MASSIVE so be careful in how you size them.

Followed the recipe exactly for the biscuits and they’re delicious.  I did add garlic powder and Old Bay seasoning to the butter glaze, and that is really tasty.
I’ve never been to a Red Lobster so I can’t compare this recipe to theirs, but it’s a keeper for sure.  Very simple and quick.

I baked them in a pan instead of individual scoops. Pressed it in with my hands and cut them prior to baking. Turned out really good. 
Could probably lose about half the salt but they tasted pretty "authentic". Will be making on a later date.

No changes and they were the BEST! I did put dry ingredients in a bowl and “cut in” the butter. Added the cheese, then eggs and milk. Stirred just enough to combine and followed recipe from there.

I made a minor change to this recipe. One of the reviewers mentioned cutting the cold butter into the flour first, then adding the other ingredients as written. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, including bake time. I made sure to use the cook's notes for brushing garlic and parsley butter over the top and it clinched the deal! My husband loved these. We had recently been to Red Lobster and he thought my biscuits were even better. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I made these for supper tonight and my husband and I both loved them. I did need to add just a touch more milk as my dough was too dry for some reason. I used both the garlic and parsley in the butter on top. Will definitely be making these again!!

Always loved these biscuits. Made them from the box mix which called for 3/4 cups water. Replaced the water with beer. Added a little more freeze dried parsley and 2 pinches of Old Bay seasoning to the melted butter. YUM! Great accompaniment to soup, stew, chowder. Add a Bloody Mary....great little dinner!

Those saying its too salty are wrong. I wonder if they used garlic salt instead of garlic powder...BIG difference and they are not interchangeable. Really very good but not quite as good as Red Lobster.

Easy and delicious.  The garlic needs to be amped up a LOT in this recipe, though!  Needs to bake a bit longer than recommended.

Great recipe. I added some chopped green onions to mine and 1/4 tsp paprika. I also did a sourdough conversion for the milk and part of the flour and it worked great (two cups starter to replace all the milk and one cup flour).

Really good!  I followed the recipe, and added black pepper & parsley to the dough, and then added more of each plus garlic salt to the butter.  They came out soft, cheesy & amazing.  I had pre-grated cheddar,  but I know gratingit fresh off a block wouldbe just a showstopper! 
 Next time I will not add any salt to the butter topping; that was just too much salt for my taste but that's my bad, not the recipe.  Will definitely make again!

Perfect.  Had to make my normal change for living above 4000 ft. and being a very dry area where I live.  minimal mixing and re sifted flour always makes great biscuits.  This is a saver.

Very good! I think I baked them slightly too long because they were a little crisper on the outside and slightly drier on the inside than Red Lobster's, but still delicious.
I cut the butter into the dry ingredients before adding the milk and egg. I'm not sure how they would turn out if the butter were melted.

I made these tonight and liked them better than the other recipe on this site, "Cheddar Bay Biscuits".  We feel these are closest to the Red Lobster biscuits.  Probably because they are made with flour, baking powder, salt, etc.  And not that awful Bisquick mix...yuck!  This will be my go to recipe for knock off Red Lobster biscuits.  Thank you cookingmaniac.

Thought they were super easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. I made 2 separate batches, in the second batch I forgot to add an egg! Mixed in it The dough at the very end and they still turned out fabulous. No more rolling and cutting out biscuits for me. I think this will be my go to biscuit recipe from now on! Thank you!!

Wow, oh so good. I did do the suggestions of adding parsley to the melted butter before brushing on top of the biscuits. The recipe is a true copy cat of Red Lobster's biscuits.

This is the same recipe I've made for years. Besides adding garlic powder and dried parsley in the melted butter to brush on the baked biscuits, I also add a very little bit of dried oregano. Very little. Good recipe.

As another reviewer mentioned, they were a bit dense. And since they’re called cheddar BAY biscuits I added Old Bay seasoning to the flour mixture. I’m sure they would also be fine with the seasoning added to the brushed butter on top of them after they come out if the oven. Just a personal preference, I love Old Bay seasoning ??

The biscuits were a little dense so finding a method to make them lighter would be better. These needed less baking powder because  I could taste it although I’m not sure how well they would rise without the full tablespoon.  Possibly using less salt will also help the taste.  I will use sharp cheddar next time rather than medium cheddar to add more cheesy flavor. Take them out a minute early to keep them moister inside.

My family loved these! So much better made from scratch than the Red Lobster mix from box. Made exactly as recipe reads but cut salt in half, doubled the garlic powder and parsley.  Will be making over and over again!

These are incredible. I made them tonight, and they were a big hit. I didn't change anything...I like to test a recipe as it's written before I decide on changes. I did use my KitchenAid, and I did decide that I need to cut the recipe in half unless I've got company, but otherwise, it's perfect just as it is.

I made and froze a batch of these this with a stronger curated cheese, to use it before it went bad. I used buttermilk instead of milk, some extra milder cheese and added garlic flakes when I brushed the butter on them. They came out delicious. Maybe a little less golden than I thought, with a few dark brown spots. Great recipe, nothing to complain about. Very fluffy and pretty versatile. Maybe next time I'll add some pepper and ground nutmeg, just for a change.

It was very good. I overlooked them a little and it needed more cheese but other than that it was really good.

Baked some for my high school culinary class, everyone loved them. Substituted the butter used during cooking for some spray on canola oil and they came out amazing

I made them in the middle of the day to satisfy a random cheddar biscuit craving. 

I've never made biscuits in my life and these came out great. I would maybe add a little more cheese next time and I put Old Bay in the melted butter that I brushed on top.

Definitely will make again!  Changes made:  less salt, probably 1/2 tsp. and I think next time I will eliminate the salt altogether since for my taste the cheese and salted butter are enough; cut the butter into the flour mixture (biscuit method) rather than trying to mix it in with the liquids; used fresh garlic since I didn't have any garlic powder, but I chopped it finally and put it into the butter while I was melting it....and finally I after brushing the butter/garlic mixture over the top (after the initial 10 minutes of baking) I also sprinkled the biscuits with some extra cheddar, only because I grated a little too much, and also topped them with fresh parsley.  Served with a homemade seafood chowder.

I didn't exactly understand how to get the butter mixed in so I decided to just dump in the liquids including chunks of butter and it seemed to work fine.  I did have to add more milk though. Great taste though.

Made as directed and added the garlic butter halfway through baking. It was very tasty although didn't rise as much as I wanted it to.

I've never made biscuits before, and these turned out perfect! I made one batch of cheddar biscuits as listed in the directions here, and then made a second batch omitting the cheese and seasonings to make regular biscuits. Both versions were easy and delicious. Will definitely be making this again, thanks for sharing!

When I was mixing it up I had a lot of dry flour so I added a little bit more milk.   It was very good however, I think the next time I might try to increase the butter to make it a little more buttery!  Otherwise it is a recipe I will use again.

We made this as written with the exception that we only use half a teaspoon of salt. As suggested in the notes, we added dried parsley to the butter that was brushed over the top. They were awesome! Exactly what we needed for our homemade seafood feast.

Easy and delicious!  Pretty much tastes like a less salty version of the Red Lobster biscuits!
