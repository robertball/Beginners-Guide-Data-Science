WHOA big Kev!  Any recipe with this much booze in it is bound to be delish!  I got a bit wobbly after 5 or 6 (lost count!)  Great recipe...one helpful hint - start the BBQ BEFORE you get too deep into the potent tea!  Me and the Mrs.  ended up eating black steaks...eeew!

Please don't mix this the way I did, It will make you ask  complete stranger for sex. No really this was a great mix. Will have to get it right the next time.

Yup. If your gonna do it, you might as well do it right. 1 of these is perfect. 2 of these are too many. And 3 just ain't enough.

whoa.....served this at a euchre (card) tournament party at my house.  Let me just say, ended up with a sleepover.  (we are in our 50's).  the spare rooms, couches, etc. were used up.  went through fifth of vodka, rum, gin, sweet and sour, triple sec.  I have two shots of tequila left because i decided to try to lay low with that.  this recipe should have a caution sign with it.  oh, we didn't exactly finish the tournament.....10 games, 12 people.  oh well, the prizes were distributed somehow!

This was delicous but SUPER potent. We ended up adding more Coke to dilute it and still got VERY tipsy.

I thought this would be great for our backyard BBQ based on all good reviews. Made 3 gallons (big party) exactly as recipe states, used regular coke for the cola, but kept the coke separate so it didn't go flat. No one liked it at any rate of tea mix to cola. Had to dump in a bunch of sweet and sour and make it drinkable and still ended up with 2.5 gallons of wasted alcohol.

Big Kev is my new BESTEST friend!  Long Island's are my favorite mixed drink.  I want to get my moneys worth if I am paying for a drink at a restaurant and I think this drink does just that.  I love making Kev's version even better.  A shot of this and then that makes making the drink easy especially after I have had one!  Tonight is New Years' Eve and I know I will be having one of these......well, maybe two or three!!!!  ENJOY!

WOW! These are great. But don't try to drink one and make dinner at the same time. They do sneak up on you fast.

The second time we made them we added some Lipton peach tea powder and a little water. That was really good too. We didn't have any gin so made them without. Thanks for a fun summer drink!!

Glug, glug, glug!  Keep 'em commin'!  Made mine with ginger ale, don't skimp on the booze - use "top-shelf" stuff and you'll be in better shape the next day.

This is close to my favorite recipe for Long Island iced tea.  But I switch out the Triple-sec for 1.5 oz of Sweet & Sour Mix, and add just enough Cola to color it like iced tea.

To each their own: this recipe has the booze down pat but after lots of trial and error we've found the perfect Long Island needs sweet and sour mix. Add some of that (3-5oz) and just top with the cola: potent perfection. Thanks for sharing :)

Just a note to those that don't get out and drink these in bars....they generally come in a pretty large glass...like a hurricane type glass if you are familiar with that...maybe if you use a frozen drink glass...the liquor will not overwhelm so much...as you get to top off with MORE soda.

made these at a party the other night.  Fabulous!  Only thing I changed was to ad lemonade to it instead of a lemon wedge.  So good.  I had 3 for the night and that was plenty!  They were awesome.  Everyone liked them.

I'm from Long Island and I've tried many Long Island Iced Teas. I'm very picky about the taste of these cocktails. I like it to be smooth...not too strong. I made mine using 2.5 oz of orange juice instead of triple sec. And I only used 5 oz. of cola. I also added the juice of half a lemon. These changes were perfect for me.

Wow! Big Kev, way to go!!! Made this recipe and the first sip instantly transported me to Binion's Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas - a good 20 years ago. My husband, the Long Island expert agreed. Kudos! The second batch I did alter the recipe by cutting the Tequilla in half - its not a flavor I enjoy but without it the drink isn't a long island. By the third batch I didn't care! This recipe is a keeper.

We mixed this up for our first BBQ of the year.  We had 4 guests coming to the party (and I don't drink much alcohol), so we multiplied the original measurements by 16, mixed all the booze beforehand and then added the cola just before serving.  HUGE hit!  Will definitely keep this one on file. :)
