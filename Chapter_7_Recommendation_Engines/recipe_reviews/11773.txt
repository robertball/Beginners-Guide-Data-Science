Wonderful recipe! I made it last night for my husband and it was quick and delicious. Based on suggestions here, I left out the lemon and added some cut up chicken breast, minced garlic and fresh parsley. It tasted wonderful and was easy to prepare when I got home from work.

This was a really great recipe.  My husband and I agreed that it had a touch too much lemon in it.  The next time I make it I'm going to cut out 2/3rds of the lemon.  Also to add a bit more bite to it I substituted 1/2 of the parmesean with romano cheese.

The addition of lemon made the parmesan cheese clump up into little clots, and the sauce was thin and watery. I had to strain the fettucine and start over from scratch. I will definitely NOT be making this recipe again.

Excellent recipe although for me, the recipie seemed bland so I added garlic and onion.  Next time, I will add more cheese (maybe Romano) to give it a little more bite and flavor.

Recipe had too much lemon in it for an Alfredo sauce. If I use it again, I will definitely cut that ingrediant down.

Sorry but this recipe was definetly not a keeper.. It was very very grainy, was very bland, no flavour at all. And the lemon was incredibly strong.. I had to add a whole bunch of spices and stuff to make it taste okay.. I think I will try a different recipe next time.. Thanks for your effort though.

Very easy to make but a bit bland.  I used a pinch of garlic powder, salt, and thyme for flavor.  Also, I grilled some chicken and tossed it with the pasta sauce.  I used evaporated whole milk instead (only thing in the cupboard) and the sauce was creamy.  Made some homemade garlic bread to go with it for a hearty meal.

I love this recipie!  It was a quick and easy way for me to enjoy a healthier version of alfredo sauce.  I cut back on the lemon juice to 1 lemon, and I think next time I will use even less!  I also added a bit or garlic salt.

Recipe was easy and guests loved it! The serving sizes seemed a little small, so I would scale it up to about 6 if there are four people.

Definitely only use one lemon, and use whole evaporated milk instead of light, it's much more creamy. Be careful not to overcook the sauce, or it gets gritty.

Very easy but kind of funky tasting.  With some more experimentation this could be a fabulous recipe for those who don't want to spend a lot of time or money on a pasta dish.

After reading the reviews, I realized I might need to decrease the lemon juice. I made the sauce in a separate pan and added one T. lemon juice. It was plenty for me, and I didn't want it to overpower the dish. I did need to add a little salt. A nice meatless, light entree that I would make again.

good, but I did add butter and garlic. Although I did not have evaporated milk on hand so I just used regular. I like the lemon flavor.

This was a very easy and fresh tasting dish. It did seem to be missing a final finishing pizzazz though. Next time I will add some minced garlic.

I will make this recipe again! Four stars is because of all the changes in the reviews that I followed, plus I had to add way more parm cheese. I omitted the lemon, added all the extra spices others had suggested. I also experimented and had success--I added 1-2 T cottage cheese! The evap. milk made it too sweet, so the cottage cheese's bitter flavor balanced it out. Plus, I had a shot of protein!

It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  The consistency/texture was odd/grainy...but maybe odd just because I was comparing it to alfredo.  Maybe it should just be called something else...like lemony, creamy, milky sauce pasta!

I liked the fettucine alfredo, but I would have added 1 can of condensed milk and more parmeson say at least a cup.  It was the "bomb" with your recipe for chicken piccato.  Love this site.

I think this recipe is really good, bus some changes do have to be made.  I took the advice of other commends and put in less lemon, more mlik, and added chopped garlic and onion.  It was pretty easy to make.  I also suggest you make the sauce the night before.  The sauce was kind of chunky though, but adding some milk and putting it in a blender for a few seconds helped that.

Recipe was good as a starter.  I've made it twice.  First with the fettucine and secondly with penne noodles.  I think recipe works better with smaller noodles.  Also definitely use about half of the lemon juice suggested.

I was making this for company and they were late, so I had to keep adding evaporaded milk to keep it from drying up.  Then it seemed pretty bland.  It was probably just me though because I wasn't able to devote my whole time to this dish, ya know, trying to get ready for company.

My son and I really liked this recipe, however my husband didn't care much for it.  I added peas and carrots.  Hubby suggested next time I try it with broccoli and chicken.  I had it for lunch the next day and it was even better than.  Thanks for the recipe!

The final product looked convincing but tasted very bland.  I added some Monterrey Jack cheese and stirred it some more.  The final final product ended up more like macaroni and cheese, but it was still good.  I would definitely make it again because it's so easy and relatively healthy.  yum.

We really enjoyed this. As others noted that the lemon was a bit much, I used a small squirt (maybe a teaspoon). I also added a bit of my pasta cooking water, swapped dried chives for basil (since my husband prefers) and added a sprinkle of garlic powder to the evaporated milk. I also left out the olive oil (less calories) and used faux butter no calorie spray (example; promise or i can't believe it's not butter). For a low cal recipe, this didn't taste light at all and I have found my new base recipe for all kinds of alfredo dishes, which I had previously had to eliminiate from our rotation because of the butter laden calories of my traditional recipe. Thanks!

Too much lemon juice! It tasted all sour and acidic. (Lemon juice and milk don't go well together)  If you cut out the lemon juice or used less, it might be better.

Following the reviewers suggestions resulted in a decent sauce, perhaps even a little bland despite adding garlic & onion.  Maybe a little more cheese would add some zing?

The recipe looked good and the reviews said it was good with a few changes. I followed their advice and much to my dissappointment the recipe didn't turn out very good. It was watery and bland. I won't make this again even though it was easy. But if you like really watery sauce with no flavor and no consistancy then this is definitely for you.

Not bad.  Hit the spot, though it did couagulate a bit from the cheese.  I miss the real stuff, but for a quick, less fattening fix, this is it.

If you add some sea salt, fresh garlic as well as freshly grated parmesean cheese - it makes it VERY delicious!!!  I also added fresh shrimp with a little bit of paprika!!  Yummy!!

This was actually pretty good. I had reservations about it but my entire family at it up. I sauteed up some chicken in garlic and olive oil and added it to the mix along with some green onion. it was great. And it was fast. Thanks!

Next time, I'll use more milk and less lemon, but if you add more cheese, it cuts down on the lemony flavor.

Just like the description says . . . "quick, easy and delicious."  Serve with salad and it's a very satisfying meal.

Overall this recipe is simple and easy. I am by no means a cook, but I had no trouble in preparing this dish for my wife on Valentine's Day.  It was delicious.

Very good and easy to make recipe as advertised! It is easy to embellish this to suit different tastes and has become a go-to recipe for Fettuccine. My daughter in law just requested it for dinner again when I gave her the choice of anything she would like me to make and she chose this without hesitation!! Compliments and thanks go to Jackie, Stan

I left out the lemon due to others suggestion. I also used regular evaporated milk due to it having less sodium than the skim version. After seeing others saying it was a bit bland, I added McCormick California style garlic pepper blend. It is a coarse blend. I only added roughly 1/4 tsp. of the garlic pepper blend at cooking time. It needed more so next time I will use 1/2 tsp. Of course you can always add more upon serving time. It's subject to ones love of pepper & garlic also. I added some more of the cheese after stirring for a bit. It just looked like it needed more but I can't say how much I added for sure. My husband loved it is it will be made again for sure. It is a pretty quick meal to make.

Wow! No butter! I omitted the lemon because I didn't have any. Awesome recipe! I made it for kids with whole wheat pasta. Had to add different veggies on top based on their 2 picky tastes, and they both loved it! Kid friendly and Weight Watcher friendly too! Any comments about this sauce being bland should be disregarded. Kids like sauce and the flavour is in the veggies and meat you care to add. Saved it, loved it and Thank you Jackie!
