I made this for our family's Thanksgiving dinner. The recipe was much praised and requested. Big winner. I replaced the ground turkey with ground pork, since I like it better.

Man, these were good! Didn't have any chile paste in the house so I subbed with szechaun sauce. I also added garlic and onion powders, cayenne, a little teriyaki sauce and a spoonful of peanut butter to the meat mixture. This was my first time working with phyllo dough and it wasn't as difficult to work with as I had thought. Hubby and I made these together, as they can be a little time consuming. I had to bake about twenty minutes longer than suggested, but my oven seems to be off. We make a lot of egg rolls around here and I was happy to find something similar without having to fry. The dough was light and crispy and we served these with lite teriyaki dipping sauce. Friends and family went nuts over this great appetizer. My only question is: Could you possibly make these ahead of time if you wanted to bring them to a party? Or would they dry out?
Thanks Betty!!

I wanted to give this 3 stars for the recipe as written, but with some additional changs and my guests responses, I will give it 4 stars.  I am a spice wimp so I dont know if I had a weak chili sauce or what, but I doubled the chili sauce and still didnt think they were that spicy.  Also, per other reviews, I added a big spoonful of peanutbutter and some terriyaki sauce and used half turkey/half pork.   I doubled the recipe so it was definitely time consuming to wrap all of them up! I would definitely recommend either baking them right away or freezing them- I transported them to a party and baked them there and some of them got sticky and fell apart before baking.

Love these!  Always get compliments when I bring them to a gathering (although sometimes I have to cut down on the chili garlic sauce) to please others.  Plum sauce or honey garlic, etc. goes nicely for dipping.  You can also freeze them (before the baking stage) between layers of wax paper in an airtight container.

I loved this recipe and the greatest thing is that you can freeze them and reheat and they don't loose any flavor/taste. They are delicious. I think I may try them with ground pork next time though.

These were very good. I made the filling ahead of time and filled the phyllo dough the next day. Yes the phyllo is a bit of a pain, but I think it was worth it. The filling was a little on the dry side when eaten with out a sauce, but I dipped these in a sweet and sour sauce and they were yummy. A cute idea to finish these off would be to cut thin strips of green onion and tie these around the two twisted ends.. sort of like party ribbon.

These were delicious!  There was *just* enough chili paste in it to give it a nice zing.  I did have a heck of a time figuring out how to make it into a 'firecracker' shape, so I ended up making little 'eggrolls' out of them, and they were easier to handle.  I figure I might make the filling again and serve it over rice as a main dish.

So, soooo yummy!  I used ground chicken and the next time I think I'll try it with spring roll pastry like someone else suggested as they were a little too flaky for me with the phyllo.  YUMMERS!

I looked everywhere for the phyllo dough and couldn't find it anywhere. So, I opted for the traditional egg roll wrappers (won ton skins). I made everything as directed and made egg rolls instead. They were fantastic. I like my dishes a little more spicy so next time I will add more chili paste. I ate the leftover egg rolls for lunch the next day and they still tasted terrific.

Fila dough was a pain to work with of course, egg roll wrappers would have ben easier.  The wrappers were to crisp and "exploded when eaten."  A person more experienced in pastry dough probably would have had more success.

I made these for the 4th of July :)  As I cooked everything together I felt it needed something extra so I added sea salt, garlic and ginger...It was perfect!!  I finally got the hang of the fillo dough and I made the hot & sweet sauce
I found here too.  It was PERFECT!!  My daughter & I are on weight watchers so I used PAM instead of oil on the fillo dough and used Splenda instead of sugar in the Sweet & Spicy Sauce.  I will definitely be making these again.

Family loved these!! Made these for Father's Day and company raved. Made a few changes, used extra lean ground chicken, added garlic, fresh grated ginger, used sesame oil instead of veg oil(which gave it more of an Asian flare), used cole slaw mix instead of cabbage and added more shredded carrots. I tried to make the twisted Firecracker look.....didnt happen, phyllo just broke and tore. So, I just made them eggroll fashion, started to roll them, folded in the sides and continue to roll, they looked great and tasted even better. I also didnt use any oil for the phyllo, I sprayed them with olive oil Pam. Served them with Thai Chili sauce and a Sesame soy dipping sauce. Delicious....next time, I might try a different wrapper but this was worth the efforts!

All I can say is WONDERFUL!  I had trouble shaping the phyllo as directed, so I simply cut a sheet into quarters the long way, put a bit of filling on one end and folded it end over end in a triangle (like folding a paper football).

These turned out great!  I forgot to buy carrots so I added more cabbage and they still turned out good (although they would probably be better with the carrots).  I will definitely make these again (and experiment with different meats!)  Thanks for sharing.

Very good! I ended up with 11 "firecrackers", so I guess my tablespoons were generous. The chile paste I used was actually "Chile, Garlic & Ginger" paste. I really appreciate how much better these are for you than deep fried. Great with plum sauce. Will definitely make again!

made hot & sweet sauce off these web site---delicious with these Fcrackers!  Excellent.  Also used Pam spray between phyllo instead of brushed oil.  Used pork instead of turkey---can't stop eatting.

These may have been okay when dipped in sweet&sour sauce. But I tried the filling before going to all the trouble of making the wraps and didn't like it much. The recipe for Asian Lettuce Wraps is much tastier.

These were good.  Just a little time consuming.  I might try and mix ground pork with the turkey next time.  We will be making them again.

The phyllo dough was sort of a pain, but these are amazing. Sorta wakes your mouth up in a hurry.
