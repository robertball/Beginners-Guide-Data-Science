You can't go wrong with any recipe from Chef John.  Recipe turned out great.  My plate looked like restaurant quality (a fine one at that) and the taste was great and it was so simple to create!  Will def use again maybe going with another reviewer's tip and using wine instead of water.

This is my first Chef John recipe that I was able to follow as it was really simple. I made it with a slight variation - did not have cayenne pepper and used paprika and did not have parsley so left it out but it was all good at the end and very surprised with the taste it gave. Only warning is that the mushroom while sautéing may release heaps and heaps of water and would affect cooking the fish - may need to consider sautéing the mushrooms until all the liquids have evaporated.

This was fantastic.  I did not use the cayenne (family members are not fans of hot/spicy) and I used white wine instead of the suggested water to deglaze the pan for the sauce.  I will definitely make it again!  The reviewer who mentioned having everything prepared before beginning was spot on.  Made the process so much better!

Made this last night for my family. Ingredients pretty easy to find although clamshell mushrooms very expensive, i used chanterelles and oyster varieties for 1/3 the price.  recipe very easy to follow.  everybody loved it!  the sauce was excellent and very light.  added this to my recipe box for sure.  served with some simple sauteed snap peas and some fresh boule bread.  this was an easy winner.  would be a great idea for a special family dinner when prep time is an issue.

thanks for the very nice recipe chef John

I have always loved fish but this recipe put it over the top!! I am always up to trying Chef John's recipes as they usually don't call for too many ingredients & are easy to follow.  Made this with white mushrooms as that is what I had on hand and served it with Brocollini & tri-color couscous what a great meal. I'm ready to eat halibut everyday!! Thanks Chef John

Outstanding.   I doubled sauce, used white wine instead of water.  Served it over rice.  Lightly coat fish with flour before frying to give it a little more crust.

Chef John you are my hero!! We have made several of your recipes and are always impressed. This one in particular has become a standard in our house. Don't be put off by the expensive fish and mushrooms...use what you can afford and it will still taste GOOD!  If you're bored with your usual seafood routine then insert this recipe asap.

Loved this recipe!  You could also substitute dry white wine for lemon.  Using left over chicken broth instead of 1/4 cup water would also be great.  I made it according to recipe and it was well worth the cost of the Halibut Steaks.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious! My husband who is very picky loved it. The fish did stick a little bit but the moisture from the mushrooms helped a bit. Maybe I will try a nonstick pan instead of my go to iron skillet. Delicious! Thanks Chef John!

Fabulous! I used a cup of coarsely chopped portebello mushroom (approx. 1 whole) because no one seemed to know what a clamshell mushroom was. Since I already had an open bottle of white wine, I used that instead of the water.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  This will be my new go-to halibut recipe.

Delicious, fast, and very aesthetically pleasing when served!  I was forced to make a substitution based on the availability of fresh fish at my grocery store - I used cod.  I also couldn't resist using the entire package of clamshell mushrooms.

Used cod tenderloins and a Sauvignon blanc instead of halibut and water. Served on a bed of spinach with peeled potatoes and whole buttered carrots. Very nice!!!

Simple and solid. Couldn't find 'clamshell' mushrooms, but used some other kind that looked the same.

Loved it!!! So good the first night that I made it two nights in a row! Lightly floured the halibut the second night, which made a thicker and better sauce.  
Could be served to company but easy enough to make just for myself ... which I will do OFTEN!!!!

I used salmon instead of the halibut, still turned out perfect. Added a dash of heavy cream at the end for extra creamy sauce.

This was amazing!  One of the best fish recipes I have ever made.  I used regular white button mushrooms as I could not get anything else but otherwise made no changes and it was fantastic.

I would like to see the “half lemon” converted to tablespoons. I doubled this recipe and my lemon was large. The dish was too acidic.

Made this recipe and it turned out great. Made it just as the recipe stated. I am not sure how it would turn out when the clamshell mushrooms are substituted with another variety.  It seems that is where all the flavor comes from.

Loved this recipe and will use it again. Used oyster mushrooms and way more than called for. I also thought there was a bit too much lemon but that is subjective. Also used white wine instead of water. Tasty !

So, we didn't make this as is, but it was inspired by this great Chef John recipe.  Changes:  1) Used cooking sherry instead of water, 2) so added no salt, 3) put peas in with it just long enough to heat them through at the end of cooking, and 4) topped with parmesan...... yum!

I stuck to the original recipe. It came out fabulous and the sauce was a perfect match. My grown up kids loved it and we are now eating a lot more fish as they can see different ways that fish can be made.

I used Chilean sea bass for this and it was outstanding.  I also used white wine to deglaze the pan as other reviewers had suggested. Used cremini mushrooms instead of clamshell.  I think next time I will use more mushrooms, add some shallots and garlic. I would recommend using less lemon juice if you use the wine, as both are acidic.

Delicious, fast and easy.  Used white wine instead of water and added fresh minced garlic to the mushroom mixture.
