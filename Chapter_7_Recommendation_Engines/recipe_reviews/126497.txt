I made this for Thanksgiving this year. Besides tasting wonderful, it pours into the pie shell beautifully. 
I also put it in a Graham Cracker crust which we prefer.

Although my guests said this pie was delicious, I found it sickly sweet.  The taste of the sweetened condensed milk was overwhelming.  I don't know if adding more white chocolate would have helped.  
There was enough filling for two pie shells.  
I decorated it with raspberries and blueberries, which added a nice taste.

Ok, I have very little idea how to cook, but I do enjoy good food. That being said, this recipe was so easy even I couldn't screw it up. Whoever recommended the graham cracker crust with it was right on. I made this for Christmas this year and it was a huge hit! My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it. I can't wait to make it again!

Tasty pie. I used a graham cracker crust, decorated with raspberries and drizzled with a raspberry syrup (from the extra raspberries). This pie did have a strong almond taste, as another review said, but I like almond, so it was good. It didn't set as well as I would have liked. It served more like whipped cream than pie. I don't think I'd make it again as a pie -- but I might make the whipped topping for something else. It was very tasty.

I found this pie to be too strong in the almond taste. You couldnt taste the chocolate at all. I would half the amount of almond used if I made it again. I dont think I will make it again as it didnt set very well, it was a bit sloppy.

I added a tsp or so of peppermint extract and it was wonderful! It tasted just like a white chocolate peppermint mocha. It definitely makes enough filling for two pies

This pie tastes great and is really smooth and creamy. I thought it had just the right amount of white chocolate flavor and I do not find the almond flavor to be too much as some reviewers have. That's just down to individual taste, I'm sure.  I don't know how much it is supposed to set up, but mine didn't set up very much. If you leave it out of the refrigerator for more than a few minutes it does start to get runny.  My biggest gripe with this recipe is that it doesn't mention whether to use a regular or deep-dish pie crust. I ended up filling up two regular 9-inch crusts and still had a small bowl of filling left over. I'm sure it would be too much filling to do just one deep-dish crust, but maybe not enough to do two deep-dish crusts. I wish the recipe would have specified which kind to use.  The filling would actually be very good served like pudding in bowls instead of as a pie, but as a pie, the pie crust does help to balance out the sweetness of the filling.

Tastes great! My pie did not set up after 6 hours. This maybe because I live at 4950 feet. Next time, I will add a smidgen of instant pudding to whipped cream. This usually helps!

I absolutely love this pie! Instead of topping the pie with fruit, I sprinkle grated white chocolate over the top. This pie is gorgeous and perfect for any occasion. I especially love it for Thanksgiving, the white reminds me of snow and it is a perfect kick-off to the Holiday season!

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  Although it was simple to prepare, the end result was too runny.  I used it for cake filling with raspberries and I hope it holds up well for the wedding.  Will not make again, sorry.

I made this recipe yesterday and it's delicious. The texture is so creamy and smooth. I also used the graham cracker crust. The most difficult part in the whole recipe was waiting four hours for it to set, but boy was it worth the wait! I will definitely make this again!
