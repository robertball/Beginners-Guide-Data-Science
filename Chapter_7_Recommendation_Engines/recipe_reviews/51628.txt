LOL, I made this last night and woke up this morning ready to give it a 3 star rating because well, I didn't hate it but it wasn't wonderful... to my surprise, a night sitting on the counter somehow made it delicious! Now I've been eating little pieces of it all day!

This pie tasted very good and was surprisingly not very sweet. But be sure to put a lined baking sheet underneath the pan when baking it. I made two pies and both ran over A LOT. You could probably get away with two pies from one recipe of custard filling.

this is a very simple yet quick and good recipe to serve peaches fresh or canned (I had canned myself): you cut corners with condensed milk and nobody is the wiser...

I'm rating this five stars because it was simple and came out great. Unfortunately, my family didn't love it but that is not the recipe's fault. They don't care for struesel topping! I made it for guests who enjoyed it. It makes a pretty pie.

We made with can peaches, and I doubled the pie to make in a deep dish 13x9 pan.  It was ok, not the best pie, but custardy and good.  I think it would be better in a 9" pie shell, so more equal with the crust, custard and peaches!

Very pretty pie and it tastes good too. I had no problem with running over. I used one large can of drained peach slices and left out the nutmeg. I can see how fresh slices would make this even better.

Very good. Next time I will cut way back on the amount of butter though. My 13 month old son loved it.

Great recipe. I had a lot of leftover custard and it oozed out of the pie while it was baking quite a bit. Thank God I used a cookie sheet to catch the mess. Also, I forgot to turn down the oven in time and the pie was a little browner than it needed to be.

FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This was soooooo good.  I made during the winter months so fresh peaches wasnt an option.  I used a large can of sliced peaches in pear juice, drained.  It turned out wonderful.  good presentation and delicious!  Will be making this often...esp in the summer with fresh peaches!  And had no problem with this running over.

This is one of my husbands favorite desserts.  I use frozen peaches and whatever other frozen fruit I have on hand so each time I make it, it's slightly different.  Peaches and blueberries is a tasty combination.
