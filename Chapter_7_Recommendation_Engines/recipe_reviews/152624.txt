Yum! I didn't have chocolate chips or chocolate pudding. SO I used what I had, banana pudding and white chocolate chips. This combo was very good. You could combine diffent compatible flavor chips and pudding and create your own delishes creation.

To be honest, I wasn't expecting great results from this recipe but I wanted to try it out of curiousity.  One bite and I realized how wrong I was.  This is delicious and has the exact consistancy of regular fudge.  I used chococlate fudge pudding, replaced the water with milk, omitted the powdered sugar all together, and used a whisk instead of a spoon to get rid of any lumps.  Can't wait to try it with white chocolate!

They taste good but are more like no-bake brownies rather than fudge

This is easiest and best tasting fudge ever made. I make it every Christmas for all my friends and they ask for it again every year.  You just gotta try it.

Excellent easy recipe with a creamy/softer texture.  I substitute fat-free/sugar-free pudding/pie filling and light butter/margarine and it still tastes great with fewer calories and fat.  I've made the chocolate as well as peppermint (with vanilla mix and crushed peppermint candy).

I needed something that wouldn't take too long to cool, and this was nice! I brought it to a party and it was all gone by the end of the night; I think it had a very nice fudge-like consistency. The butter pooled up around the edges, so I cut them off to use at home. I was very happy with this quick and easy recipe.

If you want a bold Chocolate taste, this is good.   I didn't get the best results because I had only two bakers chocolate squares, I used the substitution on the cocoa box in place of the other squares, I needed a chocolate fix but wanted a fudge texture rather then pure chocolate.  I should have used one square in the bottom layer and one inthe top layer.  The cocoa substitution was OK, make sure all of the sugar is dissolved so the bottom layer is not grainy.    It was very quick to prepare, I will try again using all chocolate squares, chocolate chips or substituting marshmallow cream for the sugar with cocoa and shortening.

this didnt' taste like fudge, it had a dry almost crumbly consistency; I even used extreme pressure to compress it.  Not too bad in flavor, but not what I was looking for in terms of fudge.

Made this at Christmas at the last minute. It went over really well. Doesn't taste exactly like traditional fudge, but was still really good!

I was looking for a nice fudgfe recipe that didn't involve a candy thermometer or double broiler and this is certainly it!  I substituted vanilla pudding mix instead of chocolate which added a nice hint of vanilla flavor.  On the second batch, I substituted Oreo pudding mix and white chocolate (and milk for the water). Then, for the topping I melted more white chocolate and mixed it with crushed oreos... AMAZING cookies n' cream fudge!!! Now I'm working on a similar way to make peanut butter fudge!!
