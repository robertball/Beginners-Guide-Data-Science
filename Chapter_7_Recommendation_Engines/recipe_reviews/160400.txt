I make something very similar to this.  I don't use ginger only because I don't like it but everything else is pretty much the same.  I do also use the star anise in mine (one or two is more than enough!!!).  It's a great snack on the side of your rice and main dish.  I also like them cold and could eat them all day.  If you like boiled eggs, you'll love this!  The longer you cook them, the more penetrated the eggs will be!

Very good recipe. My girlfriend and I have made tea eggs twice now and kind of merged this and the other recipe from this site. The first batch was a bit too salty, but this new batch is fantastic!

These are beautiful and delicious.  The other recipe on the site for these eggs added 3 cups water, so I added some water so the eggs would be more covered.  I didn't have Chinese rock sugar, so I put in a little granulated sugar.  I should have used black soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce, but they were still good and not too salty at all.

These were good. I left them in the liquid for over a day and they still didn't color as deeply as I would have liked. I will try again.

I didn't find this recipe successful. Flavor was okay, but not enough liquid for all those eggs (IMO.)   I will try the other recipe on here sometime that calls for 3 cups water instead. Sorry thanks anyway.
