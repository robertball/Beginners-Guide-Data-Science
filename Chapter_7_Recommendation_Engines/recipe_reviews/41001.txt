I had another punch ready for a wedding I was providing food for, and at the last minute, saw this recipe, and tried it. I loved it, so I served it at the wedding, and had awesome reviews!  I would definately reccommend it!
Thanks!

This is a wonderfully refreshing holiday drink. I made it to go along with some hot appetizers and all of my guests loved it.

The eggnog-lovers loved this, and the eggnog-haters hated it!  I, personally, found it very yummy, but noticed that the punch curdled after sitting in the punchbowl for a while.  I will likely make it again next "eggnog season", but I'm not sure how to avoid the curdling!

This is super easy...pretty tasty, too!  I thought it was a little sweet, so I might try ginger ale instead of lemon-lime next time.  I also used the canned egg nog so I could keep it on hand during the holidays as it is so quick and easy to make!  The guests loved it.

Absolutely DELISH!  Next time, I will use a little less lemon-lime soda to make it a softer "zest" but a definte recommendation for a popular drink.

Very good and a wonderful twist on traditional eggnog.  The berry flavour is a bit too subtle for me but my guests seemed to love this recipe despite my pickiness.
