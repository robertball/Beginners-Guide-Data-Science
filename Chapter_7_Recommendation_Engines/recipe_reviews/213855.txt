Great Pasta Salad. I only made one major change, While I was sautéing the chicken I also sautéed the vegetables.  I just am more found of cooked squash and zucchini than raw. Me and my husband both loved this recipe and will be making it again. But have decided to use red and yellow bell peppers instead of green and red.

I would recommend halving the ingredients. This cooked what looks like enough for 10 people. I also think it could stand a few seasonings depending on your taste.  The mix was good, though, and the proportions of the ingredients were fine. It just made way more food than would feed four people.

Added 1/4 t. onion powder, 1 t. dried crushed parsley, 1 t. dried crushed bay leaves, 1/4 t. paprika and salt and pepper( to taste) to the ranch-style dressing before adding the cheese and mixing with the rest of the ingredients.  It really needed some flavoring.

very yummy recipe:) the only thing I did different is I used ranch dip that I made from sour cream and dry ranch and I only did that cause its what we had in the house. I think it would be great with a variety of veggies. Maybe broccoli, cauliflower or some chopped tomato.

This was actually REALLY good! I found a great organic ranch dressing (by Drew's I believe) that I think really made this dish. I left out the squash and added onions, garlic and red pepper flakes! I served it warm the first night and then chilled it for lunch the next day.  Great easy recipe for beginners like me! :)

Unfortunately, my family voted this recipe onto the "do not make again list." While it was simple and easy to make, the flavors were strange and it felt like it needed something other than the overwhelming taste of ranch.

We liked this, my husband added pepper and salt. I added extra ranch to my own plate and he added siracha. We used frozen veggies and tomatoes. My husband says this would be great with lobster and I'll remember this recipe in the summertime as it's served lukewarm. Thanks!

This works really well without the chicken, as a side dish, to take to a bbq.
