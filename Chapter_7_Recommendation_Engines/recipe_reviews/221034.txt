I added a teaspoon of fresh lemon zest to the filling. After the pie had cooled, I spread Cool Whip over the top. I swear, I could eat a vat of this lemon pie filling. It's like a mixture of lemon curd and the filling from lemon meringue pie (which is the same thing, I guess). Delicious!

This was very tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  I think the filling should have had at least 1 tsp of cornstarch (to help thicken it) but otherwise it was a great pie.  Reminds me of a lemon meringue minus the meringue.

Taking in all reviews, thought I would put all tips together and see how it comes out.  Very easy, beats using the stove method,  loved it!  Here it goes; I used a Trader Joe's pie crust. Pre-baked it for about 10 min & did egg wash and sprinkled some Turbinado sugar along the edges of crust for a little browning and crunch.  I also preheated a flat baking sheet before placing pie pan on top to help cook bottom of crust.  
Used a tart pan, for visual effect.  Sprayed it with oil.  I find it browns the crust a little.   The filling,  used the Meyers lemons, I used an organic sugar, cut out 1/2 c.  Will cut down a tad more next time I make it. I also added 3 tbs Red Mills Tapioca flour, for a little thickening, a pinch of salt,  1 tbs reg. lemon rind as well as Meyers.  Followed the cooking directions. The only thing I didn't  know if it was normal, my pie had little air holes all over top. Not sure if I cooked it too long or not enough or is that the norm.  Anyone else experience this?  My man loved it, he didn't think it was too sweet.

Very easy to make and also very tasty. Could be a little tarter, perhaps. I wonder if it might taste good with a shortbread crust instead. But as-is, an excellent, easy choice.

Turned out great and SUPER easy!  Having never made a lemon pie before, I chose this recipe because it seemed simple and had good reviews.  I followed the recipe, except I used regular lemons and an electric mixer on high speed.  This recipe is a keeper for me!

Really loved it. A neighbor gave me the Meyer lemons. I have never even had a lemon pie before. I loved it just the way it was written,nothing added. Just the right amount of lemon. The sugar is the right amount to bring out the lemon flavor not mask it. I only wish I could master whipped cream!

Made this PALEO friendly and it was delicious. I made my own coconut flour crust and followed the recipe for the filling with organic ingredients. Then topped it with whipped coconut cream sweetened with a little maple and vanilla. Delicious, low-glycemic and gone!

I used the juice from regular lemons and one tangerine,to make it like Meyers lemons, since I could not get them.  Not sure what happened, but the filling was so thin (like water) that when I poured it into the pie shell, the pastry must have absorbed the liquid.  After cooking and setting, the pie was about 1/2 inch deep.  The crust was soggy and stuck to the pie pan.  I gave it three stars, because despite how horrible it looked, the taste of the filling was delicious. Will have to figure out something else to make with the filling.

The other reviews were so helpful! I blind-baked the crust for twenty minutes on 350° and added the filling to a hot crust and continued baking at 325°. I added 1/2 tsp corn starch, reduced sugar to 1c, and used two whole eggs and one yolk (I only had XL eggs and I thought 3 whole eggs might add too much liquid to the filling). I would have shared a photo, but there isn't a crumb left! I will definitely be making this again since it only used 2 lemons from a 4lb bag!

After reading reviews, I used a store bought crust and pre-baked it  for half the recommended time, then brushed the bottom with an egg white to the filling wouldn't make it soggy.  Added 1 tsp of corn starch to the sugar mix.  Very easy and quick and we loved it.

This is a funny little recipe, but I needed a pie quickly so I decided to try it. I would probably make it again although it didn't look especially pretty. A few notes: I used the juice of 2 regular lemons, added 1 tsp lemon zest and cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup. The filling seemed a little scanty for my 9" pie plate, so I added an extra egg and 1 Tbsp of butter. Next time I might make even more filling. I used a regular flour-and-lard pie crust and didn't have any trouble with the filling leaking into the crust.  Also, I served this with whipped cream and fresh strawberries after a big dinner and it seemed to go down well. Thanks

This was so delicious and super easy to make. I followed  the recipe exactly and my family loved it! I've made it a few times with some minor adjustments to thicken up the filling, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, added both lemon and lime juice, and a 1/3 cup of shredded coconut. Disappears every time  :)

Wonderful!  After reading the reviews, I decided it best to add 1 tsp of cornstarch and the zest of 1 meyer lemon.  This recipe is a keeper.  Tart and sweet. Great way to use my meyer lemons.  I didn't have any whipped cream, but next time I'll be sure to top it off with that.

This is a great recipe!  I used 1/2 cup of key lime juice instead of lemon juice so it's a key lime pie rather than lemon pie.  I also made my own pie crust with a different recipe instead of using a pastry shell (we may not have a pastry shell on hand).  But anyways, it is a wonderful recipe.  It's a lot of fun to make and eat!

When I made the first batch, it was obvious this wouldn't fill a 9" pie shell.  So, I made a double batch.  I was really concerned about how liquid it was and remembered seeing some reviews where they added cornstarch or tapioca.  I did as well.  I'm not sure if it would have been needed.  I used 1 tsp for the double batch.  I put an egg wash on the pre-baked shell.  It helped , but it was still soggy.  The flavor of this recipe and the ease makes it a keeper.  I like that the whole egg is used in the filling.  Next time, I think I might cook the lemon filling on the stove and then put into the shell - leave out the baking.  Then I could also test whether it needed an extra thickener.  More Meyers from the tree are awaiting!  Does anyone have any tips on how to avoid a soggy crust?

This  pie was a huge success. I made it for a pie themed event and amidst the heavy chocolates and the predictable pumpkins its slightly tart taste was a smash. Also, the bright yellow color and lightly browned, gently waved crust made it visually unique. I did make a few little changes. I used slightly less sugar, a bit more butter, and added some lemon zest into the filling. A word of caution: the pie did take longer than the recipe says to fully cook.

Made pie as stated with a homegrown Meyer Lemon the size of a grapefruit - actually have enough juice for another one.

Guests and I thought it was wonderful - served with vanilla ice cream - strongly suggest you do as well.

I used 1 cup of sugar, added zest, and 2tsp cornstarch. Also, I tore apart ready made pie crust and lined four ramekins for mini pies. I sprayed the ramekins with butter spray first and the pies released easily. Cooked about 30 minutes. Turned out perfect.  Set nice and firm. Everything was great, but I think I will use the full amount of sugar next time. Definitely needs the whipped topping, too.

I made it just like the recipe.  I put it in a 9 inch pie plate.  I was great.  Next time I will put whip cream on top prior to serving since there was room to spare on top.  Or...I will use a 8 inch pie plate.  Thank you for the recipe.

I advise using only one cup of sugar and if not less sugar then more lemon juice. I'm 10-14 and I made this all by myself so it isn't difficult at all, even for beginners. I even used a homemade crust recipe that is also on this page! I love this recipe and I would definitely make it again!

This has become a standard, and people now give me their extra Meyer lemons hoping for a pie in return. The basic recipe works great, but it's evolved here a bit: two good sized Meyer lemons give the amount of juice needed, and then I add the zest from both of them. I use frozen whole wheat pie shells, and bake for 40-45 minutes until the crust is slightly browned and the filling has formed that lovely slightly-browned sugar crust. This last time, (posted photo) I used two 6" shells, same timing. I've tried adding the cornstarch and could see no difference in the thickening or set up.

With the exception of using meyer lemon juice, which I didn't have, I followed this recipe exactly and it was a failure.  No preference from the author as to what kind of crust should be used was provided, so I used what I had, which was one of those ready made graham cracker crusts in a 9-inch pan.  The pie filling (and I use the term "filling" loosely since it had consistency of water before baking) seemed to have soaked through the graham cracker pie crust during baking, gluing what was left of the pie crust to the aluminum pan.  The result was a mere half-inch thick lemon pie that was not serveable because it had to be scraped off of the pan.  Given that the resulting pie was so thin, I question the quantities of ingredients.  I'm pretty confident that the outcome would not have been different had I used actual meyer lemon juice.  What could be salvaged and did not stick to the pan tasted okay.

This is one of the BEST lemon pies I've ever eaten or made. I couldn't get Myers lemons but the regular lemons were perfect!  The only thing I added was lemon zest. 

I made it for Thanksgiving  and I'll be making it again for Xmas!!!

This is fantastic! I definitely recommend adding corn starch as a thickener for  more body, but holy moly it’s fantastic.

Attempted to make this today...it was a soupy mess!!!  I looked at the other reviews and cut back on sugar and added cornstarch (1 T).  Used frozen pie crusts and cooked for 30 minutes.  Did not set so baked for 30 more minutes, still not done.  It made enough for two pies and then I noticed I forgot the butter.  Added the butter to the second batch and still soupy.  I then dumped both pies in a saucepan and cooked with more cornstarch and more sugar.  Poured into one pie crust and it's baking now.  I will give an update, but I'm not holding out any hope with the way it's gone so far.

This is the easiest pie and so delicious. I used a sweet dough crust, one cup of flour, one cup of sugar, one egg, one stick of very soft butter. Add extra flour until you can handle the dough. I have a big tree full of Meyer lemons that I have let people come and pick all they want and still have a full tree of lemons.

This is the easiest lemon pie I’ve made. My family demands it. I prefer a prebaked pie shell but it is fine both ways.

I didn't change a thing, except I used my favorite crust recipe.  It was delicious!  Now we have made it several times for guests, all to rave reviews.

This is a wonderful pie! The filling is zesty and light. Also, I sprinkled powered sugar on top of the pie when it came out of the oven - very pretty.  I put a dollop of fresh whipped cream on each piece when serving - was perfect. I have a very thin and tender pie crust, which matched well with this filling. So easy and so good!

Very easy and quite tasty. Only criticism is that it’s rather plain as written. Recommend a generous topping of whipped cream.

This was so delicious. The filling had a nice lemon flavor and was nice and creamy. I could have eaten it all!  I only added some lemon zest, otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Yum!

Made it for dessert tonight.  None of the 3 of us  really cared for it — a bit too tart without any relief on the tongue.
Won’t make again.

I have made this pie dozens of times, exactly following the recipe, and in the past it always turned out great.  But recently, something has changed and the filling seems to separate, causing a bubbly crust to form on the top and leaving the filling somewhat thin.  It used to brown nicely on top and had a smooth consistency.  I have been using the exact same technique and ingredients. It's not the oven temperature, which is the same, but the bubbles form on top when I pour the filling into the pie shell, and when it bakes, the top is crusty.  Also, it smells strangely "eggy." Can somebody help me???

A student gave me Meyers lemons for Christmas. I wanted to try a lemon dessert for my Christmas Eve Italian Night. This recipe seemed simple enough to try and so I made it. Only difference is that I didn’t quite have enough sugar on hand to do the full amount. No problem, Absolutely delicious pie and perfect with vanilla ice cream to finish off my lasagna and spagghetti with meatball meal! It’s a keeper. Next time I’ll make it by multiplying recipe 1 & 1/2 times to get more filling in the pie.

I was looking for something quick to make and I had a pie shell I needed to use.  Dumb me didn't know Meyer lemon was a type of lemon. Anyway I just used jarred lemon juice. It was really good!  I added one tsp of corn starch.  It is thin. Maybe double it next time. I had a can of spray whipped cream so topped it with that.

Unfortunately to type anything I have to give one star.  It should have none!  Think this is a JOKE recipe by the way, thanks for wasting my time and money.  Whoever made this successfully on here you obviously didn't follow the recipe.  Keep your day job whoever posted this!

My attempt to make this Lemon Chess pie was a total disaster.  The filling never "set" even after prolonged cooking.  The taste was delicious - a soupy sweet/tart lemon - but I could never serve it.

I was given a similar recipe by a condo neighbour when we winter in Arizona.  It called for a whole washed lemon cut in pieces rather than juiced.  This gives the lemon zest that gives extra flavour to the pie.  I also cut done on the sugar depending on the size of the lemon.  I add sliced butter to the mixture instead of melted.  As mentioned adding a teaspoon of cornstarch gives the filling more texture.  This is one of my favourite pies especially with fresh lemons from the Arizona trees.  It is always a hit with our Arizona and Canadian friends and family.

Easiest recipe to follow.  I was almost afraid the mixture was too thin to congeal, but once it finished baking that worry was completely unfounded.  The filling was neither too thick nor too thin.  Great Pi day pie.  Yummy!

It was only OK because I ran out of white sugar and had to make it with half brown sugar.  The brown sugar totally masked the lemon taste, so it was just a pie without much flavor.  I used a homemade graham cracker crust and topped it with vanilla ice cream and it was good, but not what I was trying for.

Good pie but way too small for a big family.
