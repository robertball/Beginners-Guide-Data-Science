Other than braising this on the stove-top in a Dutch oven (four hours – three was not long enough) because I started it too late for the slow cooker, I made this as is – and I can’t imagine anything could be done differently that would have improved this.  I was a little gun shy using all smoked paprika and had briefly considered playing it on the “safe” side by using it half and half with sweet paprika.  I thought about substituting wine or broth for the water.  I entertained the idea of adding mushrooms.  In the end, however, I decided against all those changes I thought might make this “better” and in so doing we had a 5-star dinner resulting in clean plates and no leftovers.  The meat is fork tender and the beautiful gravy thick, rich and boldly flavored.  Different paprika, broth or wine rather than water, additions such as mushrooms – all unnecessary.  There was enough depth and character to the dish with the onions, tomato paste and, of course, the smoky paprika.  An absolutely delicious and satisfying cold weather dish with good old-fashioned charm.

My family really really enjoyed this. I thought it tasted great. Funny hubby said more salt and zing other then that, he'd like me to make it again....Me and the kids thought it was excellent. I ate it with out the noodles while everyone ate it with the noodles. Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper.

This was an awesome dish! I only used 2 lbs of beef stew meat and cut the salt down to less than 1 tsp, 2 tsp is way too much. In place of the water I used low sodium beef broth which was even more of reason to keep the salt to a minimum. One large vidalia onion was plenty of onion for this dish. My last modification was that I used sweet Hungarian paprika in place of the smoked as my store was fresh out of smoked paprika. I always use sweet Hungarian paprika in all my goulashes and paprikash type dishes anyway, although I would love to try this with the smoked next time. I served this over egg noodles with a spoon full of sour cream on each dish. I used a large saute pan and was able to brown all my paprika covered meat at the same time, however I only used 2 lbs so that is probably why. Do try this, it is great!!

This recipe is fantastic but it is NOT goulash!  Goulash is a soup. However, this is so very tasty that I have to remember that people call things by different names.  This is actually closer to Paprikas, which is very good also.  The key is to use SMOKED paprika.  Sometimes it is very hard to find.  Regular paprika does not have the same flavor.  You want to try and find Pimenton dulce as that is the sweet smoke paprika.  Excellent recipe!

Very good.  I cooked on the stove top instead of a slow cooker for about 4 hours or so on very low.  This makes a tasty gravy.  I used half beef broth and half red wine instead of water (why add water when you can add flavor?) and bacon drippings to saute the beef but otherwise kept the ingredients the same.  I did not sprinkle the meat with the paprika while browning; I sprinkled as it came out of the pan.  We'll make this one again.

So tasty! I modified this to cook on the stovetop since I didn't have 4-5 hours to make it as written. Smoky, rich and flavorful sauce that my daughter and husband raved about - next time I will plan ahead, add green bell peppers, tomatoes, potatoes and carrots and use my crock pot. Maybe I'll challenge my mother-in-law to a goulash cook-off!

There are few things worse than too much salt in a dish.  Perhaps the measurement should be in teaspoons instead of tablespoons.  It's a shame, because otherwise, I think this would have been pretty good.  Seriously, the goulash  was so salty that it was  inedible.  I tried the usual remedies to no avail.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I think this recipe is worth trying, just for the smoked paprika.

This was one of the best crockpot dishes I've ever had the pleasure of making, as well as eating!  After reading several reviews I did alter the recipe quite a bit.  First off, my supermarket had a special on pork stew meat, so I ended up using three pounds of that.  I couldn't find smoked paprika anywhere, so I ended up using regular.  I also used a rub from "Grill Masters" which was called "Sweet and Smoky Rub" which tasted phenominal!  It did have smoked paprika as well as a hint of cinnamon, and also chitpolte powder.  I also cut down the onion to one large one, and added two red peppers because I've heard paprikash should always contain red peppers!  I also used one package of fresh baby Portabella mushrooms.  I also added one can of chopped tomatoes as well as the tomato paste.  I did cook it for about 5 hours on low yesterday, and when it was cool I refrigerated overnight.  Tonight I threw it back in the crockpot for about three hours on low, and I did serve it over egg noodles.  I had some dinner guests this evening, and they could not stop talking about how wonderful it was!  I would definately make it to serve the next day, as the taste and the texture of the meat was meltingly tender.  All in all....an awesome recipe!

I try not to use much salt in my cooking. I used 2 teaspoons.  That seemed perfect and the finished goulash was fantastic. My husband loved it the first night and the second night we took the leftovers to our son's house. They loved the dish too.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My family thought this was delicious.  After about 6 hours in the slow cooker, the meat was perfect.  I served mine over wide egg noodles.  I did make a mistake though.  I added tomato sauce instead of paste.  I already had the sauce mixed in before I realized what I did so I mixed in a tomato paste.  It was still good.  What makes this really good is putting the sour cream on top and fresh parsley.  I want to make this again using sweet paprika and serve over mashed potatoes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was very yummy and easy to prepare.  I totally ignored the salt amount (I know AR changed it from 2 tablespoons to 2 teaspoons, but still, that is WAY too much).  I was fine with just a sprinkle of salt- the tomato paste has a lot of salt in it already.  I'd salt to taste about an hour or so before you serve it.  I used a mix of Spanish smoked paprika, and sweet Hungarian paprika (didn't want to use up all of my smoked paprika in one shot!).  There was a nice hint of smoke.  I only used one pound of meat- 3 lbs would have been way too much for us.  This was a very flavorful and hearty dish.

Fantastic.  It does take very little in the way of prep time and the browning of the onion and meat make all the difference in the world!  My mum brought home a tin of smoked paprika and asked me to make something with it - this was the perfect intro to a very exciting spice that I am very much looking forward to discovering more recipes.  The only thing that I changed was that instead of rinsing the pan with water I used red wine.  Absolutely delicious.

My wife made this for my birthday, and we loved it! Reminded me of the goulash I used to eat in Germany.  This one is getting printed out and put in her files so she can make it often for me!

We really like this. I made it in my Dutch oven - shortening the total cooking time to about 2.5 hours (I had also purchased pre-tenderized stew meat, which may have made a difference). I might be tempted to add canned diced tomatoes to this next time, but it was also lovely as written. Thanks for the recipe!

Decent, This was good but not something I think I will make again because I think I am discovering that I'm not a big fan of smoked paprika, which doesn't reflect on this recipe at all, just my personal preference... Mixing in the sour cream is a must in my opinion.  Also, I liked it much better once it cooled off a bit.

It was ok. Not very memorable.... and the meat really fell apart into shreds, making it not ideal for pasta. I had a TON of this left over... and it was not eaten over the course of several days so I guess that speaks to the quality of this dish.

This was an excellent meal and very easy to prepare.  I actually followed recipe closer than I normally do.  The only changes I made included adding a little flour to the paprika mixture before coating meat to make sauce a little thicker, and  I cooked tomato paste with the onion and garlic in skillet until darkened, adding a splash of wostershire before adding to slow cooker.  Delicious.

You need to use Hungarian paprika instead of Spanish paprika. They sell authentic Hungarian paprika at Whole Foods

We also add peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, paprika, caraway seed and sometimes carrots - delicious!  This recipe is like a stew with a rather thick sauce.  Those who found the smoked paprika not to their liking might try cutting the amount of smoked paprika in half, especially if they used less beef.  Those who found it bland might want to add a half teaspoon of marjoram or caraway seed.  The best rule of thumb is to make it as written the first time, and then adjust it to your taste the next time.

Thought this was very flavorful for how easy it was.  I used beef broth in place of water and only used 1 lg onion, otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Have made this before and will definitely make again.

I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 as my husband did not care for this dish that much.  He was not as fond of the smoked paprika as I was.  I wouldn't make it again.

The dish was excellent.  I did use beef broth in place of the water and added about a tablespoon of flour dissolved in a 1/4 cup of water at the end to slightly thicken the broth.

As another reviewer mentioned this isn't technically goulash, it's more of a pörkölt, but whatever you call it it's delicious.  I've actually made this a half dozen times and it is amazing how much the character changes depending on the type of paprika used.  As with any other spice, make sure your paprika is fresh, as old paprika loses its flavor rapidly.  

Another trick is in the reheating.  By letting the meat cool and then reheating it the next day the meat firms up, becoming fork tender without falling apart.     To reheat, simply put your desired portion in a saute pan over medium low heat while your noodles cook.  By the time the noodles are ready your pörkölt is heated through and ready to go.

The meat was very flavorful, however; we did not like the sauce for the noodles. For a slow cooker recipe, this was very labor-intensive. Kind of defeats the purpose of using a slow cooker.

It was ok, but I couldn't get past the STRONG paprika flavor.  My family liked it ok, but didn't rave about it.  I probably won't make it again.  My only change was using 1 c beef stock and 1/2 c water instead of all water.

I thought this was just ok. My husband loved it and said it tasted better the next day. I'll try this again and make 1 day in advance. As other reviewers stated the smoked paprika is key.

DO NOT USE THE HIGH OPTION.  Burned the sugars in the paste and gave the whole thing the wrong kind of smoky flavor.  Also it "dissolved" the meat.  Adding the sour cream barely salvaged it.  
I'm giving it a 3 instead of a 2 or 1 because I used the high temp option.  I knew it would be better on low.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written and it was just o.k. To give it more depth of flavor, if I make this again, I will use beef broth instead of water and will add some cayenne to give it a little more of a kick.

I was able to find some smoked paprika but didn't buy enough and didn't feel like doing two trips so I combined it with regular paprika. Growing up my grandfather had a Polish couple cook and clean for him, the goulash that I grew up eating had bell peppers inside and I think that when I remake this recipe I will be changing a few things.

Since I was cooking for just my husband and I, I cut the recipe down by 2/3rds. It was delicious and definitely something I will make again. One lesson learned is that I should not have cut back on the ingredients for sauce. We would have liked more sauce but flavor was great.

I made this with some of the other reviewers suggestions. I used one large vidalia onion and about 4 cloves of garlic.  I also used about two tablespoons of flour and added a teaspoon of ground mustard to the coating mixture for the beef. I used 32 ounces of low sodium beef broth instead of water and added a tablespoon of caraway seeds to the mixture with one can of tomato paste. Also added the rest of the left over coating mixture from the meat to the slow cooker to help thicken it a bit. Cooked it in the crock pot on low for 6 hours and it was perfect. Everyone loved it and wanted seconds and thirds. I'll definitely make it again.

This was a great fall dinner for my husband (I don't eat meat). I used all of the ingredients but used a different method because I was pressed for time. Instead of sautéing the onions, I sliced them thinly and just put  them in the crockpot. With the meat, I put all the dry seasonings plus 1/4 cup of flour in a resealable bag, put the meat cubes in, shook it up, and then added that to the crockpot as well as the remaining ingredients, except for the oil, for the goulash. It turned out very well. I'm sure that the original method is also great, and I will do it that way next time, if I have time, but it's good to know you can make this savory dish faster, and I guess lower calorie too by omitting the oil. Thanks!

This dish was just average and I won't make it again.  The sauce was thin and just not full of flavor.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours and the meat was a little dry. I think 4 1/2 hours on low would have been perfect.  The house did smell wonderful all day and I was really looking forward to this.  What a letdown.

I think this is really good for what it is.  I liked it, but my husband and kids said never again.  Sorry - I guess it's just personal taste.  I have a recipe for Chicken Paprikash that also uses V8 juice and Hungarian Paprika (I'm not sure if that is the same as sweet paprika).  This tastes much smokier due to the smoked paprika which I thought went nicely with the beef.

I used Hungarian paprika because I had in house.  I don't know the difference in flavor.  Otherwise made exactly.  I used less salt in response to come comments.  I did add more before serving.  I also added some brown sugar as listed in other recipes.  My company enjoyed it

This was a great recipe. I make smaller batches so I just cut everything in thirds. Still turns out great. I do add a few fresh mushrooms and chopped red pepper. I have used beef but I prefer veal for this dish. The sour cream makes the dish lovely and creamy, but delicious without as well.

I didn't sear the beef because I can't stand for long periods of time. I also omitted the salt and used low sodium beef broth in place of the water. Everything else was done as written. Next time I will try searing the meat in small batches over a couple days  for more flavor

My husband made this today and it was quite good.  The only real complaint I have is that it's VERY greasy.  Since none of the other reviews mention it, I have to wonder if maybe he used too much oil when browning the stew meat.  The broth was very thin as well, so it was almost more of a soup than something I would serve over pasta.  However, the flavor is exceptional and the house smelled divine all day.  I think next time I would use less salt and add some canned tomatoes, more onions, some green and red bell pepper and celery.  I'd probably also add some flour to it to thicken up the sauce.  On the whole, it's a great recipe and we will definitely have it again!

The first time I made this I wasn't thrilled, because I was hoping it would be like my dad's German goulash, but the smoked paprika wasn't in my dad's dish and it was something I wasn't used to. My husband said he'd eat it again, so I made it a second time and I really liked it. The sour cream does cut down on the smoky flavor and cools it down if it's too hot. I make this at least once a month in the winter. It's a nice hearty comfort food.

This was quite a bit of extra work for a crock pot recipe. All the ingredients except for the tomato paste are used before the crock pot. It was much too bland for me. The little bit of flavor it did have was not my favorite.

Others that ate it, said it was just ok and usually love my cooking. It was edible.

Will not make again.

Excellent recipe. Delicious! I used 24 ounces of V8 instead of tomato paste and 1.5 ounces of water.

I’m so sorry but this was so bland that. Would have preferred stew. I made it exactly as described. Even after tasting it, we desperately tried to figure out a wat to season it. I was so disappointed,

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, and everyone really liked it.  To save time that day, I made it the day before, and reheating it was easy.  The meat was fork tender and not dry.  Because there were young children who would be eating it, and I was afraid they wouldn't like a strong smoked paprika taste, I mixed some sour cream into the gravy just before serving.  It softened the smoky taste, although it was still present.  I served it over wide noodles, and there was lots of gravy  for the noodles.  One other small change I made was to deglaze the pan with red wine after browning the meat, for more depth of flavor.  I've been told I can made this again next  Christmas Eve, and I'd be glad to.

It was a little spicy but the sour cream made it perfect. I will definitely make it again.

I made this exactly as written and no in my family was crazy about it. The smoked paprika was so over powering that you couldn't taste anything else. I even tried adding the sour cream to the gravy to cut some of the paprika but that didn't help much. Very disappointed as that was $20 worth of meat that we didn't enjoy.

In addition to the called-for garlic, I added a half-teaspoon of granulated garlic and an extra 3/4 tsp coarse-ground black pepper.  Heresy, I know, but I also added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  And red wine rather than water.  Overall, I found the modified recipe to be most excellent, especially the next day.

I didn't care for this. 3 stars because my family liked it. I had added extra garlic and a little vegetable stock to use up, but I felt the finished product was so bland.  You do get a fairly good flavor on the back end, but nothing initially.

I had to omit the garlic  due to an allergy and I cut this in thirds because I didn't need to feed an army tonight.  I wish I had remembered the sour cream, but I forgot.  This is still the best goulash I've ever had.  I did substitute ziti for the egg noodles and I think I'm glad I did.

This is really good. My husband loved it.  I made a few changes.

I always use seasoned salt and dried garlic and onion.  I used regular paprika and added a package of brown gravy mix and an extra half cup of water.  It was so good.

I followed this recipe exactly, banking on it's flavors of beef and smoked paprika to blend perfectly into a delectable dish. And boy did it deliver! Kudos for a perfect dish! Do not change a thing, add the teaspoon of sour cream and the fling of the parsley and enjoy!

I love paprika and used the smoked paprika mixed with a little sweet paprika just because I didn't have enough smoked in the house. I also added a small green and a small red capsicum , a finely chopped carrot and a stalk or two of celery and was generous with the onion. Both my husband and myself loved it! We ate it the next day as people suggested that it's nicer the next day after you make it. We ate it over potatoes. We ate it the day after over rice  as well as it makes quite a lot and I only  made two thirds the quantity! It's also yummy over noodles!
I will definitely make this again!
I wonder if it freezes well, has anyone tried freezing it?

It looks very interesting and will make it.
I will not use all that salt and will use broth instead of water.
Water should be used for drinking.

This dish was very nice. I always use less salt in recipes. It was delicious.

This meal was full of flavor (so often they slow cook to blandness) and the meat was incredibly tender.  I had never used smoked paprika before and have to admit I wasn't crazy about the flavor (which is no reflection on the recipe) but even so I couldn't seem to stop eating it!

Cooked 8 hours.  Added fresh rosemary, thyme and savory at the finish.  Needed salt.  Will cut my meat into smaller bits and add some additional spice at the beginning next time, but beautiful color and consistency this round :)

I liked the cooking technique but it seems like it was missing something.

I'm only giving this 3 stars just because we didn't absolutely love the flavour.  The meat was utterly tender, so that was great.  I guess I don't like paprika enough to love this recipe, but I will use it again and change up the spices a bit.
