We grilled over fairly low heat for almost two hours and the ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender with nice flavor.

Absolutely LOVED these ribs! My husband is a huge rib fan & this was my first attempt at trying to grill them. I bought boneless country ribs.  Since we aren't wine drinkers, I substituted grape juice for the wine & they were amazing! I grilled the ribs on foil on the top rack of our gas grill for an hour on-medium low. They couldn't have been any better & this will become one of our favs!

I didn't have wine so I made it without. Also I grilled them for two hours. They where almost to the point of falling apart. I just wished I made more. Great recipe I will make it again.

Excellent flavor and tender- slow and low cooking is best. Only used 1 T of hot pepper sauce (Frank's hot sauce). Keeper recipe & will make again!

I did not have the wine but otherwise made as directed. The best marinade I've come across!  My husband and I both loved the flavor; semi hot, spicey and sweet. My grill cooked them too fast so I couldn't leave them on the grill for more than 1/2 hour total. I will definitely make this again!

I had never made country style ribs, but my husband wanted some so I decided to try this recipe. He remembered his mother par boiling her ribs, so I made the marinade and added enough water to it to cover the meat in the pot. I boiled the ribs for an hour, and then he grilled them with extra barbecue sauce for just a few minutes. They were great. Extremely tender and wonderful flavor.

Great recipe; had to rush the end cooking so I need to slow down on the next attempt.  My bbq sauces became a stronger component over the marinade but still will use this for the next cooking. Thanks for recipe share.

Pretty good as is, but I have made some tweaks to make it spicier. Added spicy southern dry rub prior to marinating and also using Stubs Sweet Heat BBQ sauce to baste.
