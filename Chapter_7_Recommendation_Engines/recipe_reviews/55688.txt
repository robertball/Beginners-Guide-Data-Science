Very light, very easy.  I enjoyed this recipe as a contrast to heavily flavored pasta dishes.  With minimal seasoning, you can taste the shrimp, and the asparagus - the stars of the show!

This was excellent!  I added saut√©ed mushrooms as a previous user recommended and they really added to the mix!  Try throwing some crushed red pepper in if you like a little heat.  Oh, and word to the wise, do not add the shrimp to the pasta until it's just about done cooking - shrimp only take a minute or two to cook.  This was excellent paired with the Cream of Fresh Asparagus II soup!

This was a winner!  I modified it a little by adding about 1/3 cup white wine and doubling the broth.  I also added mushrooms.  It was very quick and easy.  The family loved it.

Whoa!  Not only is this easy, it's delicious!  To make it super easy, I boiled the shrimp and asparagus together, then added them in the skillet and followed the recipe as is (except doubling the garlic and adding pepper flakes). Top it off with parmesan cheese and it's fabulous!  This will be a staple in our house!

I wasn't a huge fan of this -- it did not have much taste. I ended up sprinkling quite a bit of parmesan cheese on the meal to give it some flavor and also added some sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil & herbs. Won't be making this again.

I loved this recipe!  my husband was so-so.  The flavors were so good, especially the cilantro.  I will make it again for some friends.  I did add a 1/3 cup wine and put a bit of cornstarch in the sauce to thicken.  YUM!
