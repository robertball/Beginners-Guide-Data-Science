This was a nice way to add some flavor and depth to the lobster meat, you can use any white wine you may have as a more afforable option....I used shallots instaed of onion just for its subtle flavor. How wrong can lobster and champagne be? And you get to drink the rest of the champange, you can't go wrong with this recipe.

This is an AWESOME recipe!!  BUT! I read the other reviews, and I just want to say- THIS IS NOT A SAUCE!!  It's an aromatic steam that gently flavors the lobster meat!  If you want a sauce to go with this recipe, try this; saute 1/2 thinly sliced shallot, 1/2 tsp lemon or orange zest in 4 tbsp butter until shallots are crisp tender.  Add 2 cups champagne, simmer until reduced by half.  Strain the sauce through cheesecloth, return liquid to the still hot pan.  (Keep the skillet on the hot burner, but do not turn the burner back on!) Wisk in 3 tbsp cold butter, cut into small pieces, adding more butter only after the last is fully incorporated.  Drizzle evenly over cooked tails, serve immediately.

the idea of the recipe is basically to make the lobster meat tender.  I love the taste of lobster and sauce tends to cover it up....but that's just my taste.  melted butter is all I use.  but if you like smothering food in sauce then I say go for it!

I added half a meyer lemon, smoked paprika, white pepper, and substituted a whole shallot for an onion to the steaming liquid. the flavors are subtle but work fantastic with the sweetness of the wine. A good dessert wine does the same thing at a portion of the cost:)

It was a very simple recipe that prepares itself. I used very large lobster tailspin so I steamed them for about 20 minutes and left the lid on until I was ready to serve.
