We enjoyed these but they are not my favorite PB cookies.  The texture was a little off to me and I assume that was from the oil.  They felt somewhat tough to me.  They were good the first day, on the second day my kids weren't as excited about them but still ate them.  I prefer a more chewy PB cookie.

These came out so yummy! I was a little nervous using the Mazola Corn Oil but it worked out great. This is a cookie I will definitely make again!

I cut the recipe in half and got 32 yummy cookies.  I did chill the dough. I also used half creamy peanut butter and half crunchy peanut butter.  Next time I'll use mini chocolate chips, those might be easier to flatten with a fork.  Very good sturdy cookie that I will make again.  Thank you Mazola!

Very nice cookie! I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and skipped the sugar on the fork before making the criss-cross pattern. I chose to use a medium cookie scoop and got 45 cookies. Took about 12 minutes on convection bake at 325 degrees in my oven. I froze about half of them, and the rest will be gobbled up quickly I'm sure. Very good with a big glass of milk.

Overall I thought these cookies had great flavor. I followed the recipe to the T except I dipped the fork in flour instead of sugar when making the criss-cross marks. My family prefers a more soft chewy cookie and these were more dry and crumbly.

All in all an OK cookie.  My family prefers a chewy peanut butter cookie and these were on the dry and crisp side.  Good flavor and a sweeter PB cookie than our usual.  That being said, it didn't take very long for the cookies to disappear but I will stick to our favorite recipe.

These were really tasty. I couldn't help myself and added about a 1/2c extra oats :) They did take a lot longer to cook than stated. They sure didn't last very long around here.

These were a huge hit at our life group tonight everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly except..... pushing down with a fork. It made about three batches of cookies so I'll be boxing them up & surprising the neighbors with these yummy treats.

Iâ€™m not a fan of peanut butter cookies, but this recipe just might win me over.  This had good flavor and texture.  If your like me and don't like anything too sweet, I would cut back on the sugar a smidgeon.  I baked it a little longer because my husband likes crunchy cookies and it worked out great.

These cookies are Wonderful! I have now found one of the best Peanut butter chocolate chip cookies out there. I did make a change and that was because of the chocolate chips I did not dip the fork and make the lines. They was sweet as it was even without it. Make sure you got milk close a hand. I was slightly set off that it called for corn oil and was surprised at the end result. It did not off set the flavor at all. Next time I will defiantly cut back some of the sugar.

I liked this cookie. It is the 3rd Mazola corn oil recipe, this week, I have tried. I can't recall making a cookie that used part oil for the butter. I may test that concept again in other baked recipes, including cookies. These cookies were dense yet chewy from the oatmeal. They have a really strong peanut butter flavor which I liked. I made 1/2 recipe. Anymore, most sweets are too sugary to me. So, I cut the amount of white sugar in half after reducing the recipe with the change servings button. I also opted not to use the sugar when making the fork design. For the chocolate I just used 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips. It was a fine amount for me, and to not over-power the peanut butter flavor. I still prefer plain peanut butter cookies, but liked trying these with the added oatmeal. 1/2 the recipe yielded 28 cookies. ty

Tasty lil cookie! Dough was exceptionally easy to work with. I baked in my convection oven, 25 degrees lower per manufacturer instructions, and my cookies were perfect after only 8 minutes. Oil in cookie dough is weird to me, but I am glad I tried it :) Stacks and travels well too!

Used extra chunky peanut butter and will definitely make them again.

These came out really nice. For those whose cookies were not chewy, Here's the fix. Don't flatten them too much before you bake them and let the oven "melt" them down. Take them out when they are still a bit soft and they are just the way you like them. Nice and chewy. A great recipe.

I did not use chocolate chips. I placed my cookie dough on mini muffin tins so I could have two bite cookies. This gave me a soft inside and a crispy out side.

These were a hit in our house.  They are a sweet cookie incorporating the best of all worlds, Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal and Peanut Butter all rolling into one.  I used a 1 ounce disher scoop and placed 8 cookies per sheet.  Flattened them with a fork, as directed - next time I would skip the sugar on the fork, these are sweet enough without that.  They held their shape well and didn't spread too much, like I expected.  Crispy edges, soft and tender centers.

One word DELICIOUS! I have to admit I was a bit skeptical trying this recipe when I seen it called for Mazola corn oil...I was afraid they would taste oily. Ummmm Boy was I wrong! These cookies are so good! My husband is a peanut butter cookie junkie and he has given his approval! They bake up beautifully crispy edges and chewy center! What more can you ask for! For the first time in A long time I made No adjustments made these as written and they are Perfect!
