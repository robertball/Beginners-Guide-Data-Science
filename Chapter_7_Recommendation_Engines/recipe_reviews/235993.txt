Followed recipe, leaving out optional ice and using 4 cups of watermelon (all that would fit in blender, not sure how big watermelon was supposed to be).  Turned out very watery--took about 6 hours (stirring hourly) to be soft frozen.  Perhaps it was meant to be started with frozen fruit?  Flavor was fine; texture was okay, but not as good as I expected with the bananas and yogurt.
