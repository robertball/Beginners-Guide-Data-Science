I'm delighted to be the first to review this recipe on this site! I'm commenting only on the baking method. I saw Chef John's video on 1/30/15 and was a little leery, but Chef John's never let me down before.  I tried it on Super Bowl Sunday 2015 and it was amazing! So help me, you will not believe the wings have NOT been deep fried no matter what sauce you use.  The outside is crispy and the inside is perfectly tender.  You must try these, you will not be sorry.  One thing though, be sure your baking powder has no aluminum in it or you'll get an aluminum taste.  I used Frank's Wing Sauce and butter not the glaze in Chef John's recipe.  Delicious, delicious and quite easy!  Thank again, Chef John.

I would give two ratings for this recipe if possible.  5 stars for the baking method.  It makes some FANTASTICALLY crispy wings the sauce adheres to really well.  Who knew baking powder would help that?  I was worried I would find a bitter aftertaste but nope, just crispy tasting wings.  The sauce is delicious but I would add a bit more vinegar next time as there was plenty of heat from the Sriracha but the honey needed more bite to cut the sweetness a little.  Perhaps even some lemon juice or lime, would do the trick?  Will definitely be making these again.

I don't like when people rate something less than five stars if they've altered the recipe.  
This is a FIVE STAR recipe in spite of my changes!! 
I used 4T honey; 2T Valentina hot sauce; 1T rice vinegar and 1/4 tsp sesame oil.
This was so easy and *Phenomenal*!!!!! 
We rate things in our house from 1 to 10 and this is definitely a TEN!  Thank you!!!

I made these for the SB also. This recipe calls for a tablespoon of salt but the recipe on the Food Wishes site says teaspoon. I used a teaspoon, it was good. The sauce is awesome, sweet and spicy. The wings came out pretty darned good, not a substitute for frying but still good. I will definitely make these again.

Got rave reviews when this was served at a get-together!  Wings were crispy and the sauce was so delicious, spicy and sweet but not overly so.  I used a full tablespoon of kosher salt and it was not too salty.  Wonder if the folks complaining that it was too salty used regular table salt instead of kosher.  Table salt grains are smaller and denser than kosher salt grains; therefore you should use half the amount of table salt in a recipe that calls for kosher salt.  Oh and be sure to use non-aluminum baking powder (Ex: Rumford or Bob's Red Mill brand) so they won't have a bitter bite.  If you love sriracha sauce, you're gonna love this! Thanks Chef!

Made this tonight for the Super Bowl.  They were great but way too salty.  I am guessing Chef John meant 1 teaspoon, not tablespoon of salt.  I served them dry with Sweet Baby Rays and Franks Hot Sauce as dipping sauces so the guests could decide what sauces to dip in.

7.23.17  Cooked these wings for 20 minutes, flipped, took a look at 15 minutes, and they appeared done.  I took them out of the oven because I didn’t want dried out/overcooked chicken.   Would recommend that you watch your time, as they would have been totally overcooked at the 55 minutes total cooking time at 425ºF (that’s pretty hot) indicated in the recipe  They turned out absolutely crispy good, loved them.  If you are  a bit on the shy side as far as heat goes, would suggest you add half the Sriracha to the glaze, taste, and then add more if you like, as these were a bit on the spicy side.  This baking powder rub works so very well to get a crispy baked chicken wing, regardless of how you decide to dress them, Sriracha glaze or traditional buffalo sauce.

I would rate this a little higher if it wasn't for the high salt content. The sriracha and honest mixed gives it great flavor but the kosher salt amount was a little much. Will be making this recipe again but with a lot less salt.

First, let me say, "Thanks Chef John"!  This recipe rocks!!!  I've made it twice this week alone!  And I will be making it several more times before the Football and Holiday seasons are over.

UPDATE!!! I've made this recipe three times in the last three weeks...need I say more?!?

I didn't have the rice vinegar, so I substituted red wine vinegar.  I didn't have the full 1/3 cup honey either, so I made it up with blackstrap molasses.  It was absolutely delicious.   My 17 year old son doesn't like a lot of sauces, so I left some out of the sauce toss for him and even they were very tasty.  
I will definitely make these again, husband said they were some of the best wings he's ever had.

As with most recipes from Chef John, these were awesome!  Did agree that they were too salty so I will try again tonight for company with 1 tsp of kosher salt.  Loved the Honey Sriracha sauce.  Will work on most anything you would dress with a sauce.  As far as I am concerned, this is the only way I will prepare wings now...

I have experimented with a variety of methods for baking chicken wings, including Alton Brown's multi-step method, but this is by far the easiest and yields the best results.  They truly do turn out with a nice crisp.

You can toss them in any sauce you like but the sauce in this recipe is my usual choice.  I like the stickiness and the sweet-hot combination.  

It could be my imagination but I have tried them with both types of baking powder and I did think there was a faint aftertaste when using baking powder with aluminum.  No such issues with aluminum free baking powder.

As with a lot of Chef John's recipe, it's worth the time to watch his video to pick up some tips.

These were amazingly yummy. Nice and crispy, with a sweet and not too spicy sauce. The baking powder really does the job crisping these wings up.  I was also out of wings on one occasion and made them with legs, they weren't as crispy as the wings, but I still had an amazing result. My husband can't handle too much spice and these were perfect.

These were amazing! I don't have racks so I even baked them directly on my stoneware and just dumped the liquid when I turned them the first time. They were so crispy! I've made a LOT of wings and they've never been so crispy. The sauce was great too, I didn't have any sesame oil so instead I subbed 1tbs of Dehydrated peanut butter. They were amazing and we couldn't stop eating them.

I made this exactly like the recipe except I reduced the salt to a teaspoon as many reviewers said. I could not have been more pleased with the final product! The wings were perfectly cooked - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The sauce was a great balance between heat and sweet. This is a keeper.

A bit too sweet, will cut back on the honey next time. Cooked the wings on the grill instead of baking and came out crispy. Good technique for making the skin "bone dry" with baking powder.

I made these for a 4th of July party.  Did a buttermilk soak, coated in spice mixture with flour and cornstarch, then fried them (I wanted to try the recipe as is, but my husband insisted I fry them).  Tossed them in the sauce, threw them in a slow cooker to keep warm, and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  The amount of compliments I received was crazy!  My husband, who is definitely a wing guy, loved them!!!

Do NOT use the amount of salt called for in the recipe. I halved the amount and it was still WAY too salty. The second time I made it I used 1 teaspoon of salt and it was just about right. I recommend tasting it (even though the baking powder is not pleasant) so you get the proper amount for your taste.

Super tasty! But way too salty , Half a tablespoon of salt would have probably done it.

I made these for the very first time for Super Bowl 2017.  My 26 year old, New England fan, asked for deep fried but I don't own a deep fryer so I was happy to find this recipe.  There is a serious mistake in the recipe because it calls for way too much salt.  I suspect Chef John meant 1 tsp and not 1 tblspn.  The wings were so salty, it was terrible.  However they did crisp up and would have been a hit only for the salt.  I'll try again and add a lot less salt.

The sauce for this recipe is delicious. The wings weren't exactly crispy but didn't care. The sauce made up for it. My husband is very picky about his wings and he couldn't get enough of them. Yum. Once again Chef John has another great recipe.

Making this again for the Super Bowl. I did drop the salt from 1 TBSP to 1 tsp the first time I made it. I also cut the Siracha to 1/4 cup for the kids and less adventurous adults. Probably not this time. :)
This will be a go-to from now on.

It was WAY too salty and only somewhat crispy.  I have 3 teenage boys who love wings of almost any kind and they didn't even like it.

Awesome recipe, and the key to getting crispy skin is to elevate them using a wire baking rack.

I followed recipe exactly.  I was making for Superbowl and we had a crowd so I made 10lbs of wings. It took alot longer then originally anticipated, and it took a lot more than the 1/2 cup of baking powder to coat the wings. But well worth the wait. And although the sauce was tasty, that is not the star in this recipe, it's the baking method. You could really use whatever sauce you are in the mood for. 
I think the group was more than a little hesitant when they saw the wings coming out of the oven but after the first brave taste tester proclaimed "These are from the oven? OMG, best wings EVER" , they disappeared.  I was really amazed at how crispy these were ...just how I like them. I was FORCED to print the recipe for several guests. We hold a wing cook off every year and these are going to be a contender! 
On a clean up note. Every time I went to flip the wings they were sticking to the racks and pulling off the crispy goodness and clean up included soaking the racks overnight and a really good scrubbing.  Save yourself and use heavy duty  aluminum foil to cover your sheet pans and Pam the hell out of the wire racks or clean up will be a small disaster. 
This will now be my go to wing recipe.  A BIG thank you to Chef John for another winning recipe!

I'm very picky when it comes to wings and I usually wouldn't leave a review. However I had to leave a review for these because they were fantastic !! For those of you who said these were too salty , I have to agree with the person who said to make sure you are using KOSHER salt. I used kosher salt and did not find these salty at all. And I am very sensitive to the taste of salt . These were perfectly seasoned . The recipe is fantastic as it . I will adjust next time with more honey and less sriracha for a more sweet taste! But these are perfect ! I will also use this baking powder method from now on! Thanks Chef John. I'm obsessed with your videos !

This was delicious!! I did everything exactly except I used sea salt because I didn't have kosher salt and I also cut the Sriracha sauce amount in half because of the kids. I will definitely make again!!

Seriously crispy wings. Who knew you could get that crackle and crunch from the oven?! The method alone gets gets 10 stars. The sauce for me was good, but needed some tang. I think that more vinegar or as someone suggested-a squeeze of lime- would help. As is, they are sweet and spicy and full of flavour. I used less salt than written. Now more about the salt, if you can indulge in this amount of sodium then try these as they are written-you won't be sorry. I had to make these when no one was home because I live in a house with people on sodium restricted diets...so, I got them all, but felt guilty. I will definitely make them with a different sauce for the family. Thank you for the recipe.

Great! I did cut back on the salt, I did about ½ of a tablespoon and I think I will cut back a little more next time I make it, it was still a little too salty.  The only other thing I changed was the baking.  The last 15 minutes of baking, I put the glaze on so it could melt and cook into the wings.  They turned out super amazing!

The method of baking these wings was so good. They really did come out crispy. I really like the sirachi sauce too, i had alittle sauce left over and used it on some chicken tenders a day or two later.  The salt was too much, but i saw that and compensated. Thank you Chef John

Love the baking instead of frying. Sauce was delicious, however, baking time was too long. Next time I will cook only 45 mins, turning 3 times.

Sooooo good! I I didn’t coat the wings completely with the sauce because we’re sissys when it comes to spicy but the flavor is amazing and nice and crispy. Definitely making them again!

I wish I would have read the comments before hand. Even though I liked the method, the 1 tablespoon of salt was way too much. I didn’t save the leftovers. Next time I’ll just tone down the salt.

I made this with chicken breasts, cut into tenders- sized pieces, instead of wings. I also cooked them in my air fryer instead of an oven. I think they came out very good, but you have to like spicy foods to really enjoy this recipe. Some family members found it too spicy to their liking.  I will be making it again and will probably change up that ratio of honey to sriracha. I'll also use less salt.

I usually do not eat wings and made this dish for my Mom.  She loved them and I agree, these were very tasty.  Very surprised about the baking powder bake.  I will make these wings again.

I used half the amount of sriracha so that our children would also eat it and SUCCESS! This is one of few recipes that all four of us, including picky children, loved. Crispy wings tossed in a delicious sauce, simple and absolutely delicious. I first eat a large salad so as not to fill up on wings alone because once I start on these it’s hard to stop.

Simple and easy to make and added 1tsp of cyan pepper to the dry rub to give it some kick without the added sauce. Kids wanted a little heat but no sauce!

We really loved these wings. I only reduced the sriracha and compensated with more vinegar for the sake of our six year old who also loved it.

I used chipotle powder in place of the paprika and had to improvise as I didn't have sesame oil and I added too much rw vinegar.  I also added powdered ginger and was generous with the sriracha! 

Reduced it in a small pot until it was a thick glaze Turned out deliciously sweet with a tangy kick! Almost like a spicy sweet and sour sauce

I am thrilled with this cooking method! If you love wings from the fryer but hat the fat and the mess this cooking method is for you!! We actually used drumsticks and NO sauce and what a treat!  Next time I will cut the salt to 1/2 TBLS, and give the sauce a try, but believe me when I tell you I will have this often and never make wings any other way!! Thanks Chef John for yet another winner!!!

Chef John  does it again.  I used Chicken breast cut into wing size pieces instead of wings and the chicken finished very close to the texture and feeling of fried chicken.  The sauce is pretty spicy, but it all came out beautiful, just like the pictures *that almost never happens!* 

Since it is just my wife and I, I used a single chicken breast  so I had to reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes total which didn't make me mad.  I will be making this again!

This was terrible... Could taste the baking powder and never really crisped up.

I would strongly recommend substituting the baking powder for 1Tbs of Rice flour and 1Tbs of Cornflour.

Hands down the best wings I have ever had.  Added ghost pepper salt to the seasoning, and doubled the honey.

This method destroys frying them!

I wish I would have read the other reviews before making them. Everything was perfect except for the salt quantity. Definitely make it 1 tsp and not 1 tbsp. I will definitely be making these again.

This review is only for the chicken cooking method , not for the sauce. The wings turned out so crispy and yummy. My husband was doubtful these would be crispy but we were both surprised and really enjoyed them. You could not taste any of the baking powder and the method was so easy. It was nice not having any of the extra grease from frying or using butter. Once you added sauce, you can’t tell they aren’t fried. Thanks for the great recipe!

Amazingly crispy!! I will cut the salt in half next time (and yes, I did use kosher salt) but everything else was spot on. One would think they were deep fried.

Loved it! Absolutely agree with the other posts to reduce the amount of salt but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. Perfect for the Superbowl!

Five stars for the cooking process.  My family loved them.  We tossed them in a traditional buffalo wings sauce and the picky one ate them plain. My picky eater even asked for seconds.  The family even requested that I make some more: soon, very soon!

We tried half the chicken with the Honey Sriracha sauce and the other half with Buffalo Sauce.  The wings were perfectly done.  Will definitely make again.

Great flavor and wings are perfectly crispy.  The ONLY thing I'd change is glazing the wings in last few minutes before they are done cooking to allow the sauce to thicken up and adhere to the chicken.

FANTASTIC!!!!! I don't often take the time/or have the time to write reviews but for this recipe, I'm finding the time!!!! Trust me - make these wings. My kids came over and devoured them. They couldn't believe they weren't fried and although I like to pride myself as a good cook and me kids think I'm a GREAT cook, they actually thought they were store bought. The only thing I changed (the second time I made them) was slightly less sriracha as I found they were a bit too spicy for my taste. As for the baking powder, CRAZY but it really works!!!!

I have resisted the baking powder concept and finally relented, and wow. I agree with Chef John that the glaze is an afterthought. We loved them straight from the oven, no need for any sauce if you prefer (but it is also yum). A hit with my family, this will become a regular for sure.

I love this baking technique for wings. This is going to be my go to method going forward. My wife said they were the best wings she's had!  

I was out of sriracha so substituted chili garlic sauce. Still turned out great. As chef John said, the sauce is an afterthought, this will be great with any sauce.

Delicious wings every time! We do a little less sriracha (or more honey) than the recipe calls for because it can be a bit too spicy. These are our go-to wings.

I thought it was a great recipe. I doubled the pepper and added 1/2 Tbsp of Chile Powder. I never used Baking Powder like the before.  Great trick to make it crispy. I also used the sauce as a dip, just to make it easier to eat.

Excellent wings! One issue - too salty. I will most definitely make these again with much less salt. My husband always orders his wings well done or fried hard.... I was so pleased to see he was happy with the doneness of these baked wings.

This was unbelievable made half a batch with and the other without sauce, both were just awesome. I can foresee making a wide variety of wings at one time. The crunch without the fry aspect was great the taste was amazing thank you Chef!

Bummer. I was so excited to have some really great wings. They definitely had the potential of being great! They turned out terribly dry. I read a lot of the reviews and know people were having an issue with that. But I figured I had twenty wings and  drumettes that were all very large and meaty. I figured the temp and time might not be an issuue. WRONG!! The sauce was delicious for sure! Not a fan of the siracha so I used an Asian chilly paste   Turned our great. I’m certainly not a wing expert, trying to learn, but I think I’d rather stick with the little bit of crisp I get from oven or grill instead.

The chicken turned out so crispy and juicy and amazing!  I didn’t try the sauce but I’ve made wings following the cooking method and dry rub a dozen times and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had people complement how good the wings are!

Yummy and quick. I only need to bake the wings for 20 mins, 10 mins on each side but I have smaller wings. Also I used the sauce as dipping sauce in case it is too spicy for some people.

5 star technique. Worked perfectly and came out crispy, even without a wire rack. My family said they were as good or better than their favorite restaurant wings. I did not make this sauce because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but will next time.

UPDATE: HCG Diet Friendly! I’m on one of those ultra low carb, no sugar/honey type of diets but one thing I’m allowed to have is Franks Red Hot Sauce. So, I experimented with chicken breast cut into wing sized pieces. I assumed the baking powder method would only work with skin, but the breasts turned out surprisingly crispy.  I did purchase a a nonstick cookie sheet with a nonstick rack and the  pieces were easy to turn, leaving no goodness behind. I dipped them in a mixture of 2 tbls Walden Farms ranch dressing with 1 tbls regular ranch (a minor cheat). I just thought I’d share in case anyone else gets hot wing cravings when they are dieting. Of course the original recipe is much better and I can’t wait to have it again after bathing suit season. 
ORIGINAL COMMENT: So happy to learn about  this method of baking wings to mimic the crispness of frying. I took the advice of other reviewers and purchased non aluminum baking powder and didn’t experience any hint of aluminum after taste. I don’t have a baking rack so I heavily sprayed a foil lined cookie sheet with Pam, however the wings still stuck to the foil. I lost some of the delicious skin so will be buying a rack before I make these again. Chef John is a genius! I loved the flavor of the sauce but can’t wait to experiment with Franks Red Hot Wing Sauce too.

Only one change....we like dry wings, so I substituted a teaspoon or sriracha seasoning (NOT sriracha sauce ) for the black pepper.   I do not make the sauce. This will be my go to wing recipe from now on!

WOW!  I was amazed by how quick and easy these were to make.  The only thing  I did different was I used 1 tsp of the kosher salt instead of a tbsp.  I cooked them for 40 minutes, then dipped each wing in the siracha glaze and baked them for another 10 minutes.  They came out with a sticky, flavorful  glaze and so nice and crispy!  For a garnish, I toasted some sesame seeds and a little chopped green onion.  They were so yummy.  Can't wait to make these again and maybe experiment with some different sauces.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe and wonderful cooking method!!

Loved the smoked paprika on the wings, but the baking powder definitely left a peculiar aftertaste on the wings. I might have to try this again with baking powder that doesn't contain aluminum. I'm also a bit concerned about how much sodium you're adding by using all that powder (and I even decreased the amount of added salt to 1 teaspoon). The sriracha glaze was delicious, but a bit too hot for my taste buds. I'll have to increase the honey and lower the sriracha next time.

I am rating this 4 stars for its absolute crispness and the flavour that cooked right into the wings. I am rating one star less only for the fact that it was way too salty. Next time I will half the salt. But the baking powder method will be the only method I use from now on!

These were amazing! The next time, I'll cut down a little bit on the salt, but otherwise these are magic.

I made these for our New Years Eve Party following the directions exactly. Wings were on the salty side using correct amount of Kosher salt. Very tasty but will use less salt next time. Really liked the crispness of these oven baked wings! May use same technique with different sauces in future.

I didn't use the sriracha honey sauce. I just used the dry ingredient coating.  Awesome!  They came out super crispy and tasted like KFC but better! No grease, the seasoning tastes amazing.  We're definitely going to make them again without the sauce.

This recipe is amazing. The baking powder makes incredibly crisp chicken wings that are much healthier than deep fried although it’s as though they were deep fried. The sauce is delicious and easy to make. I don’t change a thing when I make these but I guess you could add difference sauces. Chef John is the best!

Followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out great!  The wings were crispy and flavorful. The sauce was tasty without being too spicy, this coming from someone who really isn’t a fan of sriracha.   I  make 4 chicken thighs at the same time with the wings which turned out equally well using the same cooking time and temperature.

These were really good.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the kosher salt.  I only used 1 and a half teaspoons (half the amount called for in the recipe).  I made 8 pieces with lemon pepper seasoning for my girlfriend who was afraid that the sriracha would be too hot for her.  In the end, she even liked the sriracha ones.  Great recipe!  Thanks, Chef John!

I followed this recipe exactly and we did like it very much.  They came out very good and the texture was more like real fried in oil wings rather than baked.  We are going to try wings that have deli seasoning style and teriyaki but are keeping everything else the same.

Totally altered the recipe, but was still good.  Used drum sticks and thighs.  Seasoned the meat, but did not use corn starch and fried it on a pan.  Added the glaze at the end.  So really, I can only assess the taste of the recipe, and it was excellent.  Will try wings later!

Excellent! I would give it 4 1/2 stars because it was too spicy, but this method is incredible in making them so crispy that your think they're fried,  but they're baked... almost miraculous! You could eat all the skin it's so crispy! I tasted the sauce before adding it to the wings,  and ended up adding a bit more of everything else to offset the sriracha, and it turned out delicious. Huge hit with my family! It takes almost an hour to bake them, but it's so worth it,  that I'll be using it with other sauces too. Thank you Chef John!  I forgot to say...based on other reviews, I cut the salt in half. It worked perfectly!

The rating is for the cooking method. I didn't end up making the sauce; I used another recipe for Parmesan-garlic wings to make the sauce. But the wings turned out unbelievably good. I ate way too many.  Will probably try this sauce recipe in the future but doubt it will change my rating. As some reviewers suggested, I did change the amount of salt from 1 Tbsp to 1 tsp for the coating for the wings.

I was directed to this recipe simply for baking instructions and let me just say this; I made 5 different sauces for our wings and we never touched a single one. The wings were beyond amazing all by themselves. Not only was it incredibly easy, but it really did come out better than restaurant quality! Crispy on the outside, so tender and juicy on the inside. The seasoning of the coating was enough to give it this really satisfying but not overpowering flavor. You could really taste delicious chicken, not just a bunch of seasoning! I didn't change a single thing in either the coating or the honey sriracha sauce and both were out of this world amazing. Make this recipe AS IS. Don't change a thing. You will be amazed at the quality!! BONUS: it's all just as delicious the next day!

A keeper!  I made it naked and yum!  Super easy.  I combined the baking powder and spices in a ziploc, then added the wings to coat.  Next time I will spray cooking spray on the foil because the wings really stuck.

This is such a great method.  I don't like deep frying, so I was very attracted to this method.  I'm going to make a plug here, I hope that it is okay, but I do love using our Copper Chef oven fryer, and it fits perfectly with this recipe.  I've been playing around with the wings.  I used the original Chef John recipe first (cutting back on salt as recommended by others), and it was fantastic.  I've recently made honey-teryaki wings, (the grandkids do not appreciate spicy), and it worked out great.  I do think honey is an important ingredient to get your sauce to stick.  In the last 15 minute cycle, I baked with the sauce on; it has worked well.  Simply 'taste test' your sauce before tossing it in the wings--you'll know if it is too sweet, or whatever.  This recipe is a hit!

I made these twice. First time they were too salty for us. Second time I used 1 tsp of salt instead of 1 tbsp and they were perfect. If you like them salty add some seasoning after but you can't reduce the salty taste after they're cooked.

This recipe is everything it promises. I've never had baked chicken come out this crispy. It's now a regular.

Made almost exactly as described; I made over twice the amount of chicken so I adjusted accordingly.   I used less salt (not kosher) as recommended by other reviewers, 1 teaspoon for 6 pounds of chicken. All else was proportional to weight of chicken.  It was a great success.  I recommend using a baking rack for the chicken.  I used both a baking rack and aluminum sheets.  The racks work best as the chicken stuck to the aluminum.   I used convection oven at 400 degrees.  About same cooking time. 

I made the sauce as described for half the wings (~ 3 lbs) and replaced the Siracha with BBQ sauce for the other half.

Let's just start by saying I love fried chicken. This is, by far, the crispiest baked chicken I've ever eaten. And this was also my first time eating sriracha sauce. (Didn't realize it was so hot...). It turned out great. In fact I'm making it again for the second time this week. Thanks Chef John! If you are considering this recipe please give it a try. (The only change I made was to decrease the kosher salt.)

I'm a stickler when it comes to wings. I really don't like when the skin is chewy, and I don't like them deep fried either. The coating and baking time for this recipe made them *just right* in terms of crispiness. My husband said they were restaurant-quality. My only regret is that we only made the 2.5#! Next time, we're going to double up on everything.

*** I suggest putting the wings back in the oven for 5-10 minutes after coating them in the glaze.

So, so good. It sticky, spicy, and sweet. I punched up the acidity a bit by doubling the rice wine vinegar and added a tablespoon of ginger puree. My wife and I couldn't get over how it good this was!

This was amazing.  Chef John comes through again!  I forgot one of the basket ingredients, sesame oil, but it had to have been the best wing sauce I have ever tasted.  So, go, go now and make it.  You won't be sorry.  I found my SuperBowl wing recipe...

The technique on this results in the most phenomenal wings that appear to be fried but are actually baked.  I did not use the full amount of KOSHER salt and it was still a little salty to us but I stay away from salt anyway so it was probably just us and we ate without the sauce.  I did make the sauce and did not really care for it but again probably just us. I am unsure of the reviews using soda without aluminum because I used the generic soda and we did not taste anything funny.  Hope this helps and Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.

Fantastic! My husband says these were his favorite wings ever! I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, added literally a dash more sesame oil and rice vinegar, but otherwise just as written. My baking powder does have aluminum in it, but neither my husband nor I noticed any unpleasant flavor. I will definitely make these again!

Even if you don't make this specific sauce, this method of making wings at home is *THE* best (short of having a fryer).  I have made this sauce - which is quite tasty - but have also used bottled BBQ, dry ranch seasoning w/butter, garlic sauce, teriyaki and others we have concocted at home.

These were fantastic!  I prepared the wings as described in the recipe.  After they were done baking, I mixed up the sauce and cooked the wings and sauce together in a pan to thicken it up a bit.  Came out spicy and delicious!

This is my first time and won't be my last. I thought 1 tablespoon of salt sounded like way too  much so only ground in a few shakes of salt from my mill and that was plenty. I was going to ask about the bitter taste. Thought it might be the baking powder doing it. I will have to look for a brand with no aluminum in it.  Other than that they were crispy and deliciously moist and not greasy at all. Plus you didn't have to use oil at all.  I definitely will be making these again and again.  I didn't make any sauce this time because I wanted to freeze them and add sauce later. But I did sample some! Awesome!

I just want to review the cooking method as I did not try the sauce but WOW did the wings ever turn out great. I have always struggled to get oven cooked chicken wings crispy (they were always rubbery) but this method is fabulous!

This was my very first time making wings homemade. They came out crispy just like I like them. I wish I would have read the reviews before making it because I have to agree the salt was way too much! The sauce was amazing!!! It did add some fresh garlic to the sauce. I had extra sauce and we saved it. It was too good to throw out! I won't make any other "hot wings" again!

I was making them for a crowd so I used half the sriracha just to be safe. I also make them a little ahead of time and kept them warm in a crockpot on low. Everyone liked them :)

These might just be our favorite wings yet.  Followed directions exactly.  Mine did not come out all that crispy once I drizzled the glaze over and tossed.  But the flavor was awesome. Added to my regular chicken wing rotation.  Saturday night is wing night and I'll definitely be doing these again often. Thanks Chef John for another keeper!

It felt funny to me. The flavour of the sauce was great but no thanks to the texture. Chalky is how it tasted to me and I didn't even use all of it. I'll make these again but dust with something else.

I made these exactly as the recipe called for, and they are the best wings I've ever tasted!! LOVE the crispiness of the wings, and the sauce is simply to die for. I'm on my second batch, and this is my "go to" recipe for wings now. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

These turned out great! I used 1 tsp salt and put the wings back in the oven for 5 min after coating the wings. The lighter colored wings are made with peach, habeñero, and pineapple slices. Both ways were crispy, juicy, and tender!

I have to be honest, and admit that I coat my wings with a different mix, which includes brown rice flour, baking powder and various seasonings. Once I have coated them, I place them on the baking sheets in the fridge for an hour before baking.
This wing sauce is the best I have tried, and I usually double it. I may add a dash of OJ, or coconut aminos from time to time, but usually go with it as written.

I was worried when I saw how much Sriracha sauce was in the sauce but made them exactly as directed.  I am a HUGE chicken wing fan and always like to make up my own recipe.  This recipe however, out did any I have made.  The sauce was not over powering and the wings came out absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make them again and will serve them at my next cocktail party.  I am sure they will be a big hit!

I made just the sauce and heated it up in a skillet with pre-cooked frozen chicken and some chopped onions. Then I put it on a bun and it made a great sandwich!

The spice rub was a little salty, but not as bad as many reviewers have remarked since I used larger grain kosher salt. The wings got a little dry after 45 minutes though, so I'll try brining next time and reducing the salt in the rub for moister wings. The sauce was perfection!

As a person with gluten allergies, this hot wing recipe was a divine discovery! I had been craving hot wings, but couldn't find a gluten free solution. Since the chicken is cooked in the oven with baking powder, you don't have to worry about the flour traditionally used in fried hot wings. The sauce is a beautiful balance of spicy and sweet.

This recipe was, or rather would have been pretty good with a few changes - For my tastes. Mainly, the salt level was through the roof, I'd cut the salt in half - at least. Secondly, I thought the sweetness of the honey was a bit over powering. Lastly, I like a bit more vinegar in my wing sauce. So way less salt, bit less honey, and bit more vinegar.

I'm going to make it again, because it was really close to tasting like something I'd love and I'm sure once I tweak those few ingredients I'll love it.

We love chicken wings but generally avoid them because of the time required to get them crispy in the oven. This baking method is fantastic! The glaze is awesome. I didn't need to make any changes.

I used frozen, prepackaged chicken wing sections. Is it just me, but I think they taste salty. I also used course kosher salt which compounded what I thought was a too salty dish. I would decrease the tablespoon of salt by half & maybe eliminate it entirely. With this being said, I loved everything else about this dish. Will definitely be making this again, I'll just use the salt sparingly if at all. I suspect I created the problem with the dish using prepackaged chicken & kosher salt. Live & learn

My rating is based on the cooking method. These are by far the best oven baked wings. I have been searching for this type of recipe, and won't be looking any farther, they are that good. You would swear they were fried. They rivaled any restaurant wings, and surpassed many.

Another Chef John home run!  First off, I love the baking powder trick.  It works great in the oven and over indirect heat on the gas grill.  It is amazing how crispy they become without the frying fattiness.  Then the sauce.  Oh, goodness, is it different in a great way.  It has great heat, flavor, and sweetness (maybe a bit too much).  And, heeding some of the comments of others, I cut the salt in half, and feel it was a good call.  


For a cook's treat at a BBQ cookoff, I smoked 5 lbs of wings over apple wood and added this sauce.  These wings went FAST.  Folks couldn't get enough of them.  While they will likely not win awards at a BBQ competition they were quite crowd pleasing, for sure.


For the next time I make the sauce, I may only use 1/2 of the amount of honey or replace part of the honey with turbinado sugar syrup.  When I try that, I will post an update.

WOW! Made these tonight and they were AMAZING. They came out crisp and juicy and perfectly spicy! Made exactly as written (with a little less salt - personal preference) and they were so good. Will definitely make again. I honestly forgot the sesame seeds at the end (we were so hungry and they looked and smelled so good) but it would have been great with that too! I loved how the wings came out nice and crispy and the glaze didn't diminish that - just made them super flavorful and a little sticky (perfect if I had remembered the sesame seeds :p ) and finger-lick-able. Chef John scores again!

Thank you for sharing! The method and amount of Kosher salt were perfect for my family's tastes. I took the suggestions of several reviewers and used aluminium-free baking powder and adjusted honey:siracha in favor of a less sweet, more spicy sauce. The wings were devoured in short order with plenty of raves. I plan on using this oven "fry" method on chicken with other seasonings and sauces--so this is a valuable recipe in a couple of ways. Thanks again!

These were hands down the best wings I've ever made.  Reduced the salt to 1 tsp per other reviews.  Used Hungarian paprika since I didn't have smoked. Reduced the cook times to 15 minutes instead of 20.

I hate people that rate a recipe and have not tried it.   I find myself  rating only half the recipe and that was because of time.  I cooked the wings according to recipe and they were WONDERFUL.   It was a quick and easy way to cook wings for Super Bowl.  Because of time I purchased a container of the new sauce from Chick fil a called Sweet & Spicy Sriracha and used it.  I put the wings in a plastic container, poured sauce in, replaced the lid and started shaking.  Everything was nicely coated.  Looking forward to making the sauce next time!  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe.

These were awesome! I made them for the super bowl this year. I did reduce the salt a bit. I can tell you these were gone before the buffalo ones were touched.

This is the perfect chicken wing recipe, I followed the directions perfectly for the cooking method, which rocks , but we are dry rub fans, so when the wings were cooked I put them in a bowl and  sprinkled  oil over the wings then sprinkled dry rub and tossed wings. Absolutely perfect, I love you chef John.

Wow these tasted absolutely amazing!  Just the right amount of heat from the sriracha and I love the sweetness from the honey and the little acidity from the rice vinegar.  I hardly tasted the sesame oil but that's fine by me.  

The baking powder technique really works!  It really made the skin super crispy and it stayed crispy even after glazing.  

I doubled the recipe for a party and everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing Chef John!

Love it! Love it! Love it! I spruced it up a bit with my own lemongrass/ginger rub but with the baking powder it turned out just as in chef John's video...crispy and succulent without all the oil! GENIUS :)

Exceptional! And I forgot to add the sesame seeds at the end. ;) This recipe is unbelievable! My husband thought the spiciness was just right, though I thought it could be spicier (just personal preference). The crisp factor was through the roof!!!

These were fabulous!  My husband and teenage boys loved them!! The baking process makes them so crisp which is how we like them best. The Honey/Sirachi sauce was fabulous. Just enough spice and sweet. I also tossed half of the wings in BBQ sauce just for variety. This recipe is a keeper!

Made exactly as written. Best wings I've ever had! The honey coating is thick and delicious. The baking powder really does give it a crispy effect. . Very tasty!

I made these wings for my family, my youngest boy does not like spicy food so I left a few aside for him without the  Honey Sriracha, and then coated the rest, these wings went fast between 4 people, I have been asked to make them again many times, I love this recipe, thank you Chef John :)

I am a big fan of Chef John's recipes and this, like his others, did not disappoint. I made the recipe as written. No changes. The glaze was great and the wings had the texture of being fried. As others have said if you don't want to do the glaze toss them in  your own wing sauce. Either way you'll love 'em.

Absolutely Awesome!  Made these because I honestly didn't want to get my fryer out for wings. I cannot say anything negative about the how these turned out. Crispy and not greasy or gooey, like most baked wings. The sauce may have been an afterthought but it's sinfully simple and delicious! I also made a spicy teriyaki sauce too and it stuck perfectly to the wings. Thank you Chef John, for another fantastic recipe! This is my new go-to recipe for wings!

Awesome, easiest, crispiest, and less calories too.  What could be better:  no messy oil to dispose of, nor the expense of buying it.  While the Honey Sriracha sauce wasn't overpowering, I think I prefer Chef John's Spicy Orange Glaze or the Garlic/Ginger glaze.  I've been using his baked wing recipe for years thinking it was the easiest and best, but this recipe tops that one.  My wings were small and done to perfection in 40 minutes.  Thank you, CJ, for another great one!

I think perhaps the best part of this recipe is that you can eat the wings (or what ever you chose to cook, eg. legs/tenders) without any sauce at all. Several of my young grandchildren are not yet into hot sauces and these are perfect for them without the sauce... and with the sauce...   OMG OMG OMG...  they were to die for! 
As much as I love wings I have never made them as all the recipes I have researched are too fussy and too many steps.  This has no deep fat fryer to stand over and worry about the obvious drawbacks to frying - no par boiling, nor 'par baking'- just oven time and times between flipping is perfect to do whatever else is needed. I admit I did use 'Frank's' but the even ratio of hot and honey was perfect. Thank you Chef John - you have scored again!

Unfortunately my wings just didn't come out as crispy as everyone else's seems to have. Where did I go wrong? I'm not exactly sure. I'll try to make it again sometime in he hopes they turn out better. the sauce was fantastic, and so easy.

Did half the salt and added garlic powder with baking soda.  Family loved it.
