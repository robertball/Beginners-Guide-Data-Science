Excellent salad dressing, it's a bit on the sweet side which was nice. I cut it down to 8 servings and it was a bit on the oily side so I added more apple cider vinegar (just a little) to compensate for that.  It went great over mixed greens.  It's a keeper!

I've become a huge fan of homemade salad dressing.  This one is tasty! You can change the type of vinegar (try balsamic, rice wine, or other vinegars) for a different flavor.  Sometimes I add a little lemon juice as well.  You can also change the herbs and spices.  Dried dill is very good and if you've got fresh herbs they can be minced and thrown in.

Good flavor, but given the other reviews that said it was too oily, and given that I like vinegar, I used 1c oil and 1c white vinegar (because we were out of cider vinegar). I look forward to trying it with cider vinegar. I liked it this way, and my guests claimed the proportions were good. 
WARNING: If you plan to have leftovers to refrigerate, I recommend using something other than olive oil, which solidifies in the fridge. When I plan to use it again, I just have to take it out in plenty of time to melt.

I ended up making this as I was pissed at myself for forgetting to get dressing at the store. I may never buy commercial dressing again, if it is always this easy, good, and healthy.

I am afraid that I made this recipe and I found that all I could taste was the cider vinegar.  I doubled the other ingredients except for the olive oil and it did improve but only a little.

This was wonderful! I whipped it up to go over a dinner salad that I was copying from a local restaurant.Hubby loved it and so did the kids. I scaled the recipe down to serve 10, but next time I will make more because we ran out. Thanks for sharing this one Judi.

Since it is just my husband and I, I made this in a store bought Italian dressing cruet to scale down the servings. I added vinegar, water (even though the recipe didn't call for it) and oil to the appropriate lines. Just before adding the oil I added the seasonings shown in the recipe, except as smaller quantities since I reduced the recipe servings. It came out great!!!  Easy recipe to whip together and uses items most folks have on hand. Thanks for sharing!

1.75 C vinegar.  Still oily.  Needs more flavor.  Used 1/4 t instead of 1/8 for celery seed, salt, and pepper.

This was a good dressing, and easy to make.  I will try it with white or rice vinegar next time (my kids don't like the cider vinegar).

ElVery easy and so much cheaper than butlying bottled oil and vinegar dressing! Best of all this dressing reminds me of my Mom's but made healthier by Olive oil.l,( mom made hers with vegetable oil). I went by the recipe,except I substituted Steva sweetener for the sugar as I'm watching my sugar intake. It tasted so good as a dressing for cucumbers. I'll be keeping this as a dressing staple in my fridge.

Not bad, but I was not impressed.  Won't be making again.
