I cannot understand why people modify a recipe, make substitutions that don't work, and then give the original recipe a poor rating!!!!!

Absolutely delish - a nice change from ordinary whipped cream! I will use it for more than just scones & fruit - anyplace you use whipped cream, except that it is much stiffer. I froze extra in dollops on wax paper, then stored in plastic bags.

Not Bad! I've had real Devonshire/Clotted Cream and for not being able to find it easily (or even at a reasonable price) this does the trick! Next time, however, I think I'll up the heavy cream content just a bit to rid the end produt of the cream cheese after taste.

Thank you!!

This stuff is so good I could use it for a dip with cookies!  Instead I used it to top the "Rich Chocolate Truffle Pie" from this site....WOW!  Many reviews here confused me because some say to increase the cream cheese and some say that all they tasted was cream cheese.  So I went with the 3 oz. as called for and I wouldn't change a thing.  I'll make this many times over!

Great recipe.  I made this cream for our church ladies tea.  I made a small change to the recipe by adding 3 tablespoons of sugar instead of 1.  We used this cream with scones and anything else we could, it was so good!

3oz of cream cheese isn't enough, if you add 8oz (a package) then the consistency is right, but it still tastes like cream cheese. If you add 6-8oz of sour cream it tastes MUCH better.

This was very easy to make and tasted incredible!  It had the perfect texture and whipped right up in my stand mixture.  I served it with Grandma Johnson's Scones from this site and the two combined were heaven in high tea!

Raves, raves and more raves.  I made this cream to go with scones I made for a baby shower this last weekend and everyone wanted to know what was in the cream!  Several people asked, not only for the recipe, but to take some home as well :)

Very easy to make and delicious.  Reminds me of my time in England.  I had been craving some good cream to have with my scones and tea and this hit the spot.  Yum!

Simply delicious and so very easy to make! I find it interesting that those who didn't rate the recipe very well either didn't even try it or did give it a go, but still complained that it isn't exactly like real Devonshire cream and clotted cream. That's nitpicking and it's not rating the taste of this recipe. I would ask that each of you simply try the recipe and rate it on it's own merits whether it's 'exactly' like the real deal or not. This recipe is meant to be an easy, delicious substitution, not an exact replica.

Wonderful topping for scones, or used as a fruit dip.  I made scones for my daughter's bridal shower tea and topped them with the Easy Devonshire Cream and fresh sliced strawberries.  Yum!

I submitted this recipe after a friend and I experienced our first Tea while in Victoria, BC some years ago.  We watched the others in the Tea house as they split their scone, spread the Devonshire Cream on then topped it with fresh strawberry preserves.  I fell in love with this wonderful treat and came home and did my best to duplicate.  This "cream" began a yearly tradition of having a Tea with mothers, daughters, granddaughters and friends.  So much fun and so many memories made.  Enjoy!

If a) You don't like cream cheese or b) You like super sweet whipping cream, this is NOT your recipe.  I frequently make Grandma Johnson's scones (this site) and this cream is pure heaven.  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe is written and I thought it was not too sweet and PERFECT.  ALL my guests raved about the flavor and the word "heaven" was frequently employed as a description.  Not exactly like clotted cream, but wonderful all the same.  Thank you for a great recipe!

We had  tea today with 10 of the ladies in our neighborhood.  Everyone raved over this.  We served it with different types of scones.  I altered the recipe by using an additional 2 tsp of sugar (I used superfine sugar, also called Baker's Sugar), adding 1/2 tsp of high quality real vanilla, and omitted the salt.  I also used full fat Philadelphia Cream Cheese and heavy cream.  The cream cheese flavor was not strong at all, and most people could not tell that is what it was until I told them. I noticed that some reviewers complained that the cream was not thick enough.  I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer, which has a stainless steel bowl and wisk.  I put them in the freezer prior to whipping the ingredients.  It makes a huge difference with how well the cream whips up.  It was very dense, and held its shape.  It did not melt even after sitting our for a bit.

Another way is to use equal parts of cream cheese, heavy whipping cream and sour cream and it makes a wonderful Devonshire Cream also.   Just whip it in your Kitchen-Aid for 5 minutes.

This was good, but it had too much cream cheese tang in the finished product.  So, I made it using 1/2 of an 8oz tub (4 oz) of mascarpone cheese instead of the cream cheese the second time. It was much, MUCH better.  It was a just a tad softer, but the flavor was almost spot on.  Mascarpone is almost the flavor and texture of a buttery cream anyway, so it worked better in my opinion.

Awesome.  This was 1 of 4 recipes we made last night in prep for a bridal shower Tea Party.  We tasted them all last night & today and this recipe had the best flavor & texture, tasting closest to clotted cream. During last night's tasting this recipe had a cream cheese taste but after chilling overnight it was gone & most resembled clotted cream.  I might add a little more sugar.

Excellent recipe and great on 
"Grandma Johnson's scone" recipe. Oh, and if you follow the directions as stated, i.e. CREAM the cream cheese and sugar first with a hand or stand mixer, it won't be lumpy.  Hint: room temp cream cheese will speed up the process.

Delicious recipe!  This is similar to a recipe for "French Cream" that was on a Paula Deen show.  I mixed together 8 oz. softened cr. cheese with 1 c. powdered sugar till fluffy.  Separately mix 1 c. whipping cream with 1/4 c. sugar till soft peaks form.  Now mix the cr. cheese mixture with the whipping cream till blended.  Optional:  add juice of 1 lemon, plus lemon zest.  I added about 2 tsp. of bottled lemon juice, and it was wonderful!  In fact, I immediately gave the recipe to a couple of friends tonight after serving it over a fresh fruit salad.  I will definitely make this again!

Not sure what Devonshire Cream is suppose to taste like but this tasted great. Next time I think I'll omit the salt.

This recipe is great.   I make it just as it is and add food coloring to match the decor/occasion.  My husband was born/raised in England and was delighted that it was very close to "clotted cream."  It's quick and easy to make and adds a real treat to the buffet/table.

Too salty/cheesy tasting, and far too liquidy.  A proper Devon cream should be thicker (like whipped butter), and slightly sweet.

Make sure to beat it well (exactly to stiff peaks). Makes a great cream for nearly everything.

Easy to make and looks similar to clotted cream, but it didn't taste ANYTHING like real clotted cream (NOT EVEN CLOSE).  It tasted like fluffy cream cheese...yucky.  Won't be making this again.

This was very easy to make and went over extremely well. Everyone wanted the recipe for themselves.  I will definitely make this again!

Not sure what real devonshire cream tastes like, but this was amazing. We had it on scones with jam and could hardly stop eating it. It would also be a great dip for fruit. It's definitely cream cheesy tasting, so if that's not what you're looking for then don't make this recipe. I will be making this again, and definitely recommend it!

This is pure decadence to eat and very addictive-I made this recipe to go with scones but I am searching the house to see what next I can put this cream on-I added 1 extra tbs of sugar and that made this cream perfect-You need to make this!

This was easy to make, but be sure to beat the cream cheese well. My first batch had small lumps of cream cheese suspended in the whipping cream.

This was good along with Grandma Johnson's Scones (also on allrecipes).   I wanted to get as close as I could to authentic Devonshire cream, as my daughter was supposed to serve something from the UK for her 4H international night.  Some people just skipped the scones and ate the cream!  It wen't over quite well.

This is a very good substitute for devonshire cream. It definitely needed more sugar though to make up for not being the real thing. I added a bit more sugar here and there as I mixed. It went great with the Simple Scones recipe from this site and rasberry preserves - so yummy! Thanks!

Super easy to make! I made it for a Ladies Tea that I was putting on at my church. I was unable to get out of town to buy the Devonshire Cream at World Market...we live in a VERY small town and are miles from anywhere. I found this recipe and was very excited! All the ladies at church raved about how yummy it was. :) I took the left over scones this morning to church and everyone wanted more Devonshire Cream to go with it! YUM! Thanks so much for this recipe...its a definate do again and its in my cookbook forever!

Tastes just like the Devonshire cream that I've had at my local English inspired tea house! It's quick, easy and delicious! I also added a few dollops of sour cream to add thickness and for a touch of bitterness. After refridgerating for a couple of hours I'm very happy with the results!

I followed the recipes, just added one extra tablespoon of sugar and omitted the salt. Whipped it all up at once,instead of two steps...we loved it. Served on top strawberry scones and everyone loved it!

Good basic recipe.  As written, it's not very sweet, but you can adjust that to your liking.  The cream cheese taste is strong when it's fresh, but much less prominent the next day (I used 4oz light cream cheese and would probably use another ounce the next time).  Using Mascarpone instead of cream cheese might be a nice alternative.

Fantastic! I made it just as directed (watch out for the right amount of cream cheese) and it was delightful. I almost put the whole 8 oz bar of cream cheese in at first, but a quick glance at the amount on the recipe saved me. People... follow directions and you won't have any problems! Try it as directed first, then add your own flair next time.

Not bad, but the title is very misleading. It is not at all like Devonshire Cream. I found the cream cheese taste was too strong.

Perfect cream for my scones! It was definitely a hit with my mother in law! I really liked that the cream has lasted several days in my refrigerator, so you would be able to make the night before. Very tasty! Serve with Perfect Lemon Curd for an extra special treat with scones!

This recipe got rave reviews from tons of people. I used it as a base recipe for my cream and tomato tea sandwiches at a brunch and now I've been requested to make this for every event. I did multiply the recipe by 4, add the juice of a fresh squeezed lemon and some dill to taste. It made for heavenly tea sandwiches! Thanks

I creamed 1tsp vanilla with the cream cheese until smooth, then added the sugar followed by the heavy cream.  Turned out perfect!  I served fresh strawberries nestled in a Tablespoon DARK brown sugar and drizzled a little heavy cream over them, then topped it with the devonshire cream and a whole berry dipped in the brown sugar. The Berries need to sit in the brown sugar and cream for a couple of hours, so the sugar is drawn up into the heavy cream.  It's a beautiful,rich dessert with awesome taste!  It also works well with Peaches...

I made this for my best friend's "high tea" wedding shower, served with homemade scones, and the guests went crazy.  Everyone was raving and calling me a gourmet chef.  I didn't tell them how incredibly easy it was!  I'm making it again this weekend when my family is coming over for breakfast.  This is really a delicious and amazingly easy recipe.

I am new to the world of making scones and simply couldn't wait to buy some clotted cream..This was very easy to make. Delicious! It was a hit with my whole family, ranging from ages 1 to 3o, and it's hard to please my hubby! Thanks Sandie!! Bring on the tea!

Great recipe.  

I have started adding 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar.  Seems to keep it from getting runny longer.

I used this for my recent tea party and my friend loved it! I made the recipe exactly as written! I actually tried to hand whip a single batch and realized it wasn't going to work. So I ended up using my stand mixer. And then before blending decided to  double the recipe. Even though I didn't cream the second addition of cream cheese, this still came out fine!
Went great with the British scones and raspberry jam!

This recipe makes the most heavenly cream ever! I haven't had a real Devonshire cream, but my friends that have said that this is pretty close. I make the recipe as is but I add 1/4 cup of sour cream, this seems to help with the "cream cheesey" taste. I also added 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. This goes great on plain scones. I am so excited to make this again on Tuesday!

Nice thick texture although the taste wasn't very appealing it didn't taste bad. This is good with fruit. Will not be making again probably.

Absolutely fantastic!  Everyone loved it.  I added some lemon zest because I ruined my attempt at lemon curd, and it made a nice flavoring, but I'm sure it would have been great without it as well.

As written, this is not as good as the revised one I make. I use this basic recipe, but add some vanilla (don't really have a measurement, just to taste). With the vanilla added, the flavor is ten times better. Grant it, I'm sure it is no longer "authentic", but it is much more enjoyable!

Oh, so good.  Did tweak a bit - a little more sugar and vanilla.  Did not whip up firm despite useing stand mixer, but still great, and fantastic topping for the fresh fruit salad.  I learned that after chilling the leftovers, the consistentcy was awsome.

This is great! I love Devonshire cream, but it's not practical for weekday afternoons. This is a fantastic substitute. I used honey, rather than white sugar. I also made this for a children's tea party- added 1 t. vanilla and sweetened it more (just kept adding honey until it was sweet enough). They loved it!

I think this is delicious and a great substitute for the real thing.  The real thing would be very expensive for a well attended tea party...this is more than good enough for me--and for most others to enjoy.  I've been to England, too--many times, and I'm not sure the real thing there is any better than this...maybe it's just knowing you are there!

This was ok, not sure what I was expecting really.  It tastes nothing like real devonshire/clotted cream but it is a little nicer than ordinary thick cream.  I will try it again, but next time maybe add a little something extra.

A simple recipe to follow, even for a novice.  I doubled my recipe and added a little extra sugar, whipped on high and let sit in frig for an hour or so.  Wish it could have been a little thicker and I think next time I may try adding 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (maybe the wrong thing to do but I'm gonna try it anyway) and instead of more sugar than is called for I may add a 1/4 cup powdered sugar.  I'm planning to play with the recipe a little and make it my own.

Just okay.  The cream I've had at tea houses is much thicker, almost butter like, and had no tang like this did.  I whipped the stuff forever and it never seemed to get thick enough.  Tasted good with scones but I didn't like it alone.

I guestimated everything, added a little more sugar, per other reviews advice, and put in about 1 tsp. vanilla.  It was so delicious.  It was served at a tea party themed baby shower with orange marmalade and orange/cranberry scones.

Ok, so though I gave this 5 stars I had to make a change because of my own bad planning.  I forgot to get enough cream cheese so I ended up using 4 ounces of sour cream instead because I figured it would work as well and I am happy to say it did.  My cream had perhaps a bit more zing than if I had used cream cheese but it tasted really good anyway.  The whip held up amazingly, unlike regular whipped cream that quickly goes back to liquid, this remained thick.  I served it with scones and fresh sweetened sliced peaches-yum!

I'm sure it would be even more delicious if I knew how much a pinch of salt is...I used too much! Remember, some of us are novices. Conventional measurements are much easier to learn.

I have been looking for a cream to go with my scones for a long time and I've finally found the perfect one. I followed some suggestions and added 8oz of cream cheese and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Delicious!

I made this recipe in just minutes and it was as great as it is simple! I have tasted devonshire (clotted) cream in fancy coffee/tea houses and this is seriously just as good!

Really enjoyed this easy version of devonshire cream over "Grandma Johnson's Scones" recipe from this website and some homemade strawberry freezer jam.  On its own, I would omit the salt as it does come through some, but with the sweetness of the jam, you can't taste the salt.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with us, Sandie!

Oh this cream was delicious on scones that I made (Grandma Johnson's scones)this weekend. I used the 8 ounce block of cream cheese and 3 tablespoons of sugar that is the only change I made and it came just right.

This is pretty good but I don't think it is very much like proper clotted cream. I personally just use a mixer to whip heavy cream until it as thick and stiff as it can get. However, if you want the real mccoy, search the internet for your nearest specialty British food store. And while you're there, do what I do, and stock up on bangers, bacon, white pudding and pasties!

Ever since my family toured London, and tasted their delicious scones with clotted cream, raspberry jam, and tea, my family has searched and searched for clotted cream to have with scones. But since the U.S.A doesn't have clotted cream, we tried different Devonshire cream recipes. This recipe has tasted the most like clotted cream!! These definately do the trick. LOVED IT!!!!!

This whipped cream is exactly what I was looking for to pipe around the edges of a pina colada cheesecake I make. I added another T. of sugar and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and it was delicious! Thanks so much for sharing.

Good.  It was a little too cheesy for me and it needed a tad more sugar.  The consistency was perfect and it went well with the cranberry scones.

This was excellent.  The commercial product was $5.00 for a small jar.  This receipe gives you twice as much for much less.  And, sooooo easy.  Everyone at my High Tea loved it.

I loved this with scones!  When first made it does taste too much like cream cheese but I let it sit in the fridge overnight and the flavor changed to just creamy goodness.  One reviewer suggested using marscapone  instead of cream cheese so next time I'll try that and see if it makes a difference.

I used 4 oz cream cheese because that is easy to measure. I used 1 table spoon of sugar. It was perfect. You have to understand that you need to mix until the cream cheese is combined and then whip like you would whipping cream and it thickens up nicely. I whipped past the soft peaks to the consistency of clotted cream and it was nice and thick just like the official stuff that’s imported.

This is a fantastic mock Devonshire/clotted cream recipe. If you want a simple, quick substitute, this is the winner! It will definitely give you the taste of the real stuff, but in a very easy way.  It was absolutely perfect with scones & lemon curd. 

Thank you to the reviewer who suggested the extra 2 tsp of sugar, & the 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I also used the superfine baker’s sugar as she suggested & it was an almost identical taste to my favorite tea room. I think the superfine sugar also really helps the texture. This is a keeper for sure!

I added a teaspoon of Vanilla Extract for extra flavor. Put all ingredients in the blender for about 30 seconds and voila, it was ready. Tastes great on scones.

I followed directions to a t and it was awful for my purpose. It tasted like salty liquidy cream cheese. After having my two house guests try it and getting thumbs down I added a lot of powdered sugar to the already whipped mixture and somewhat salvaged it but it was nowhere near the Devonshire cream I wanted.

Great! I don't see the point in hunting around to buy it now after trying this. It was perfect. I accidentally combined everything together instead of creaming the cheese, sugar, and salt first, but that was fine. The instructions were pretty minimal so I second guessed myself for a while since I didn't know how long to whip it for. It did take a good 5 minutes. The result was great. Oh and I used xylitol instead of sugar so that it would be diabetic friendly. I'll definitely make this again.

This was really good! As it was reaching stiff peaks, I tasted it and thought it was slightly too cream cheesy, I just beat in maybe 1 1/2 tbsp (just did it to taste) more heavy cream. 

On the scones, it was a slightly less silky texture than real Devonshire cream, but very good and the flavor was nearly spot on for what I've had in England.

This recipe turns out perfect every time I make it. My go to scone recipe is the coconut chocolate chip and this pairs with it very well. (How could it not?) and it's easy to make with a stand mixer doing all the work for me.

I was looking for a recipe to copy the scones and clotted cream that I had at Harrod's in London.  My search is over, this is it!  The clotted cream there was like a cross between butter and cream cheese, and was very smooth.  This was a little lighter in texture than theirs, but the flavor was spot on.  Clotted cream can vary pretty widely, depending on the region in the UK- that's why you'll get conflicting reviews on clotted cream recipes.  Also, we pasteurize our dairy, so you'll never be able to exactly duplicate their clotted cream.  I do whip it past the 'stiff peaks' stage, to firm it up and get more of the butter flavor- and, the cream cheese taste is reduced after refrigerating a couple of hours.  You do still taste cream cheese a bit- but I tasted a cream cheese-like flavor in the clotted cream I had in the UK, also, so I liked that.

I made this.  I actually tried to make real clotted cream by cooking it but far too much work for the amount of clotted cream I needed for a party.  This recipe is great.  Here are some tips!   
I bought Philadelphia cream cheese and Whole Foods cream cheese.  The Philadelphia is way too tangy so stick with the Whole Foods Cream cheese.  
Also, before you make this.  Make sure your cream cheese is at room temp, or you beat it in the mixer first so you get the lumps out.  If you put it straight from the fridge in, it will be lumpy.   Once you whip the cream cheese add the heavy cream and powdered sugar.  I did like others and added 2 Tablespoons of powdered sugar so it wasn't so tangy.  

I like that this was easy!!!
I also made this 2 days ahead of time.

Brilliant recipe! I'm not sure how people got a strong cream cheese taste with just 3 oz of cream cheese, but I suggest using the already whipped cream cheese - works wonderfully.

Also, It seemed to be missing a little something for me, so added very finely diced lemon zest and that did the ticket! I might try a good citrus marmalade next time. I also upped the sugar, but this can be done to taste, so just mix in to your sweetness level.

If you make this with the heavy cream substitute (butter and milk blend) like I did, add four more tbs of butter. Make sure it is unsalted, but it helps with the slightly powerful cream cheese taste.
A small dash (under 1/4 tsp) of vanilla extract makes it really sweet.

Absolutely delicious! I made it (as written) to accompany a Cranberry Scone recipe and my girls couldn't keep their fingers out of it! I also used as part of the menu for a girlfriends wedding shower and had rave reviews from all the guests.

LOVE this recipe, and use it frequently! While canned Ambrosia is nice, it just does not compare to real cream. This is as close as Brits are going to get to the real thing from the US, and it is absolutely delicious!

Made this for a British Food potluck night. It was not that special.  Most of it was wasted.  Putting butter on your scones (or skipping the fat all together) is more practical and cost effective.

I made this just as the recipe said.  It didn't taste like cream cheese to me. mI found that it becomes very close to Devonshire/clotted cream if you beat the mixture just until you think you've taken it too far.  Devonshire cream is very thick, almost spreads like butter.  I like how this turned out- made a double batch, one for a baby shower, and one for us at home!

DELICIOUS! I made this for a high tea, and served with scones, lemon curd and jams. I made a triple batch and two dozen women ate every bit. It also holds up well, if kept in a jar with lid, so it can be made a day or two ahead. I plan to try using it in crepes with strawberries at my next family brunch. This is a recipe that I will make again and again.

Wasn't overly impressed, rather "blah/bland" I decided to add a little more cream cheese, heavy cream, honey, vanilla & a dash of cinnamon. After the additions it was better, sweeter, and probably best be served with some fruit, pretzels, or a dallop on a "not so sweet" muffin, scones etc. I prefer a "clotted" cream...Delish!

Recipe worked for scones, although we increased the recipe to 3 Tbsp of sugar. It still had the tangy taste of cream cheese, which I wasn't a huge fan of. I haven't had the real stuff, so it's possible it's just not to my tastes. I wouldn't make this again.

Love it!!!!  I have made this for several years for a tea at church that I chair.  Everyone raves.  And thanks to the Allrecipes servings calculator I can adjust the recipe to serve 110 ladies!  The price for the real thing would be prohibitive.  Someone took some home and said it was even wonderful on waffles!

Pretty good substitute for clotted cream, though it did have a bit of a cream cheese-y tang to it. Mine came out looking more like cottage cheese, and I had to strain it to get a clotted cream-like substance. Maybe if I'd beaten it for longer it would have all turned out cream-y.

This was very good, like a fancy whipped cream!  =D. Oh my gosh!!  I just put sugar-free strawberry preserves with it!!  AMAZING!! It will probably taste even better with fruit.  Right now I'm eating it with whole wheat ritz crackers :)

I make it to go with "Grandma Johnson's Scones" from this site.  This is some dangerous stuff.  I am prone to just eat it by the spoonful!

Yu-- mmmy!  I double it.  I did a whole 8 oz. package of cream cheese, 1 pint of cream, 2 pinches of salt and I did closer to 1/4 c + 1 T. sugar.  I wanted it a little sweeter.  I think I mixed it on my highest mixer setting for close to 5 minutes.  It's perfect.  My 4 year old duaghter at a big bowl of just it for dessert tonight!

This is a great recipe.  I did add an extra Tbsp of sugar to sweeten it a bit more.  It tastes just like the whipped cream cream cheese frosting from this website.  That recipe i use as frosting as well as a dip for fresh fruit or strawberry short cake.  it is SOOO good i could eat it out of a bowl like ice cream.

When I made this, it took way too long for the cream cheese to go smooth and I wound up finding bumps after I'd served it. Try putting a pint of whipping cream with 1-2 tablespoons of instant vanilla pudding together; whip until thick. THAT is a five star recipe!

This was just ok.  Not sweet enough and tasted more like cream cheese than devonshire should.

I used 8oz of cream cheese and half and half, and it didn't turn out. I then tried to add more cream cheese, but the mixture never thickened up like others have said theirs did.  I guess you can't use the half and half in this recipe.  Really disappointing, because it was supposed to go with all the scones I made for our St. Patrick's Day luncheon.

Easy and delicious, great as noted with scones and fruit. I took the suggestion of another user and increased the cream cheese to 8oz.  Creamy, and wonderful.

I've made this a few times with great success! It is especially good served with Grandma Johnson's Scones (also on this website) and apricot jam.  Thank you for the recipe!

I found it to be too thin with only 3 oz. of cream cheese. I actually ended up using 8 oz. and it was perfect! I hosted a high tea for a girlfriend's birthday. The cream was her favorite part. It is delicious. Thanks!

I used this substitute for Devonshire Cream with scone for a group of hungry graduate students.  Albeit hungry, and the plates were gone before you could blink. The best was when the ultra-shy student who asked me afterwards if I had anymore, which I did (my own hoard), but I think if it could get her to speak up, the cream with the scones must be extraordinary!

Delish! I did add a bit more sugar for a sweeter taste.
