Awesome!
Loved it the first time I had one, still love'em. Thanks Uncle Dan! I tried this with a couple different variations. The ratio of gin to vodka, and with different brands. 
I prefered mine with a higher ratio of gin than vodka. But not much more.
Bottom line, ... A Great Martini.

The combination of the vodka/gin and the olive/twist give this martini a smooth yet international flavor. One part Brit one part American ingenuity. Who needs 007's concoction after this mart?

This is a great martini. Not sure why it is so smooth, but is. Be careful, this is strong drink.

I accidentally doubled the recipe.  It was still a wonderful drink.
Very smooth and not bitter as I thought it might be.  A perfect drink for sipping slowly.
