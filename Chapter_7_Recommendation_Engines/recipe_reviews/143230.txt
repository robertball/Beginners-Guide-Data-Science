Just a little tip as to how we make ours (the recipe was edited a bit):  I actually also rub the skins with oil, salt and pepper, which makes them just a bit crispier.  Enjoy!

I fixed these for dinner tonight . I followed most of the recipe as written except....I used 5 smaller potatoes instead of 2 large . After microwaving , I sliced them in half , covered them with Krafts Tuscan House Italian Dressing and Marinade , let them sit for about 45 minutes & then grilled them . Served with sour cream & butter, they tasted great (in fact they would have been great even without the sour cream ) ! This recipe will be a regular here during grilling season . Thanks !

The only way to eat potatoes in this household now.  We also coat the halved potatoes entirely with olive oil then sprinkle with kosher salt, cracked pepper.  Sometimes to kick up the flavor a notch we sprinkle steak seasonings on them as well.  Amazing flavor and lets you eat the entire potato for more nutrients!  Great recipe!!

We have made potatoes this way for many years but hubby, the expert grill man, never bothers to microwave them first. I score the potato halves in a cross-hatch fashion, which may help them cook faster and looks so pretty! I also sprinkle with seasoning which varies to our tastes--any herbs are delicious, but my favorite is dill. We usually do the vegetables on the grill too, which makes for a totally mess free kitchen--no pans to clean!

The health police may be looking, but...... I don't care. Generously rub the potato skins with soft bacon grease, just put some in the palm of your hand and do it, then season with kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper. You know, what's left in the pan after cooking real bacon. Save it, your mom did. It makes a LOT of things delicious.

This was incredibly easy and a nice change from the same old baked potato.  I added a little paprika and garlic powder to the mix.

I tried these tonight and they were really tasty!  At the end of the grilling time I put a handful of shredded cheese on top and closed the grill for a few minutes.  Just like a loaded baked potato!

These were surprisingly good. My husband and I were sort of shocked at how good these were, actually. No extra seasoning or butter needed; a healthy way to eat baked potatoes. The grill lends a yummy smoky flavor.

I knew for our taste we would need more flavor than just the salt, pepper and oil so I roasted a head of garlic and rubbed the potatoes with the soft cloves after grilling.  Next time I think I will sprinkle with a 3 cheese blend I get from my deli.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now except I spray the halved potatoes with Pam instead of using olive oil.  After spraying I lightly salt and pepper them before grilling for 15 minutes or so.  Using food service gloves eliminates the greasy gunk on my hands.  I serve them with just a little bit of sour cream.  So easy and very good!  The potato skins are always so crisp too!

Great recipe.  I also grilled some onion and tossed the two together when I was done.  I added a little sour cream to mine and my husband added butter to his.  A great taste and super easy!

These are so good as is!!  The second time I tweaked it to our tastes by microwaving potatoes till done.  Then splitting and brushing with oil and sprinkling with:
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons dried rosemary
Repeated on the second side and grilled them alongside the steak on pretty high heat for 10 minutes per side.
Oh my goodness, they came out charred, smokey, seasoned and the best part being the crispy edges!
Thank you so much for this great idea and recipe!

Just did this, we added some garlic and onion powder to the seasoning. When it was on the grill we started face down and ended up with the skins down. After it had been on skins side for a few minutes, I took the inside of the potatoes, scraped them out added a bit of butter(sour cream would be good too, but didn't have any) and then put it back in. Sprinkled it with shredded cheese... To. Die. For!

Perfect! I cut 5 red potatoes into quarters, microwaved them in a bowl with a little water, covered with plastic wrap, drained, tossed with the olive oil, S&P, garlic powder and a little fresh thyme, and grilled until browned. Excellent, easy side dish with any grilled main dish. Will be a regular this summer. Thanks for sharing!

These are really easy and delicious.  I made the recipe as written, except that I added Penzey's Fox Point seasoning.  You really do not need to put anything else on them.  The whole family liked them (that never happens).  This is how we are going to eat our potatoes during grilling season.

So simple, yet turned out very well! I'm not normally a fan of baked potatoes because of all the unhealthy stuff you have to add to them to get them to taste good, but these were enjoyed with just the salt and pepper called for. Also, I made half russet potatoes, and half sweet potatoes (skipped the second microwave 2-minute step, since they were already soft after 5 minutes), and the sweet potatoes were even better, I think.

Have been doing potatoes like this for a few years. Everyone that has had them, loves 'em. I do mine just a little different. Quarter baking potatoes, cover with plastic wrap and vent. Microwave until just cooked thru then roll in a mix of rosemary, powdered garlic, onion powder, thyme, dill,cayenne, and tarragon mixed with either olive oil or butter depending on what we're having for meat.

I LOVE this idea. Potatoes are so cheap, my bf and I buy a bag of them every two weeks and trust me, I am tired of mashed potatoes.
I made these last night with grilled swordfish. DELICIOUS. Instead of the black pepper, however, I had this bacon and chive potatoe seasoning mix I had bought from the store forever ago. I mixed it with olive oil and drizzled over the potatoes. We ate them with sour cream. I wish I had made more.

These were a big hit. Everyone is tired of my foil wrapped baked potatoes; they really liked these. We just put a bit of ketchup on them & we were good to go. I liked the ones that I left on longer, they got a good crisp crust.

My family loved this!  I've made it three times this past week alone.  I coated the entire potato half with olive oil and sprinkled with  s&p and a little garlic powder (Paula Dean's kitchen spice)!  Delicious! Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

Really simple and delicious.  Watch them so they don't scorch and they'll be great.  Play around with different seasoning blends too.

These are delicious and very simple to make.  I used Yukon Gold's and sliced them about 1/4" thick. Then I steamed them for 5 minutes or so before brushing them with the marinade from "Grilled Garlic Artichokes."  They took an additional 10 minutes or so on the grill and were tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.

My wife loved these. I didn't but that is because I really don't like baked potatoes - they are too bland and dry for me. But, for my wife who likes very few things, but potatoes one of them - she rates this a big 5 for taste, crispiness of skin, and presentation.

I had no idea serving grilled potatoes would be so simple. My only changes were to adjust cooking times for medium sized red potatoes. Served tonight with A/R's Firecracker Grilled Salmon. Before now I'd reserved potatoes for the colder months, with roasts or oven baked.

I used a liberal amount of seasoned salt and fresh ground pepper and followed the recipe exactly. These were AWESOME potatoes. Just added a touch of butter when we ate them. So quick, easy and delicious. Great alternative to baked/twice baked potatoes. Perfect for quick weeknight meals.

This is a GREAT and EASY basic recipe.  Forgiving also (I left the potatoes in the microwave for a while as I was preparing another dish).  It’s a flexible recipe designed for your individual taste – as is, slice the potatoes thinner, marinade the potatoes, add rosemary and / or thyme, substitute sweet potatoes, add garlic and / or onion powder, etc.  All of this while depending on your mood at the time and what else you are making.  Thank you stylistmama!!

These are very delicious.  I made according to the directions, but also rubbed them with olive oil after the microwave and added some salt and pepper.  A delicious blend of crispy and creamy!

Did as others suggested and brush olive oil over skin and top, also sprinkled with paprika and garlic powder. Served with fresh chives and sour cream.

Seriously good! I used kosher salt and oiled and s&p the whole thing before the grill. Soft and silky insides and crispy crunchy outsides. Thanks!

very good -- don't skimp on the salt -- they need a LOT of it to season the entire potato.  Try this recipe when you already have your coals hot after grilling the meat/fish or chicken.

This was very good! I was looking for something different from the same old same old, and this fit the bill! I made it as written except I added seasoned salt. This was very easy and much quicker than baking them in the oven! I will surely be making this again!

This was a great idea for a recipe! Our potatoes turned out crisp on the outside, soft on the inside and had the bonus of that grilled flavor. Im always looking for something to grill that isnt meat, and this is a winner. Next camping trip i go on I'll just toss some already nuked potatoes in the cooler and have the bad boys ready to go! We dipped ours in sour cream and Franks red hot sauce.

I sliced my potatoes I  about 1 inch rounds.. Microwaved per recipe.. Marinated in a oil, salt  pepper, paprika, onion salt..and an additional spice that compliment that nights meal... (I use this recipe often)  I grill on med high heat, turning often until I have golden brown grill marks and a somewhat crispy skin.  Serve immediately with main course..  These can be warmed in the oven next day.. Microwave will not crisp them, if that is your goal.

I have been making these for awhile now.  I thought that I had developed a new way to enjoy potatoes, but now see that others have been doing this too.

I take medium sized Russets, wash but leave the skin on. Then slice length wise into 3 or 4 flat long pieces, usually about 1/2" thick.  I put these in a microwave safe bowl and sprinkle with salt, fresh black pepper,some garlic powder, a bit of sugar, and extra virgin olive oil. I'll leave this set for 15-20 minutes to draw out some of the moisture, and infuse the spices into the slices.  Then, microwave until about 3/4 cooked, stir once in the middle of cooking.  On my microwave (1100 watts), this takes about 3 minutes plus for two nice Russets.  Then brown on the grill for another 5-10 minutes.  

I serve with sour cream, and whipped cream cheese, but lots of other toppings would also be great.  These are our summer "go to" potatoes.  Everyone can just take the amount they want, and not have to face a large baked potato if they don't want to.

These were a great camping side dish!  I prepped in the microwave, then Mr. LTH finished them on an grate over the open fire for a delicious smoky flavor.  I rubbed them w/EVOO and then sprinkled w/seasoned salt.  These will be a camping go to in the LTH world!  Thanks for the recipe, sylistmama!

Perfect.  I love not having to worry about when/if the potato is done and then trying to time that to coincide with everything else.  This takes all the guess work out and leaves nothing but grilled, smoky crispy baked potatoes to enjoy.

I have been doing this for several years. After microwaving, cut potatoes (sometimes in four length wise, like potato wedges). Oil, salt and pepper over all.

These were great and so easy! We didn't serve them with butter and they were a little dry, but still very flavorful.  Next time I might brush them with a little butter before removing from the grill.

These were simple, fast, and delicious. They taste just like "naked" potato skins but without all the fat from deep frying. I followed the recipe exactly but the hubs ended up wrapping them in foil about halfway into the grill time. He thought the outside was getting too done and he was nervous the inside wouldn't be done enough. GREAT recipe!!! Made these with Buffalo Chicken Burgers and sliced tomatoes and cukes with salt and pepper.

I've made these three times now and we've enjoyed them.  We much prefer using red skin potatoes over the russets.  I season mine with garlic salt and seasoned pepper.  Nice, easy and quick side that goes well with almost anything!

These were awesome! I just put olive oil,garlic powder,salt and pepper all in a big ziploc and tossed them around after microwaving for a bit. As another reviewer did I put some shredded cheese on them at the very end. Will make this a regular and I will also try other seasonings as well..

My family says that potatoes are "boring". After I made this recipe, they ask for them at least twice a week! These are FANTASTIC!! I have found that if you do use a large potato, you need to increase the microwave time accordingly. The Kosher salt sprinkled on the outside gives just the right kick, and it was the first time my kids ate the potato skins too. GREAT RECIPE!!

I did change this a little because I was making italian pork chops. I coated both sides with olive oil and and sprinkled them with italian seasoning. Next time I'll use more potatoes because they were gobbled up while I tended the grill

Excellent side dish!  I used a spicy blend of seasonings instead of just salt and pepper but I'm sure just salt and pepper would have been great as well.  I will definitely make these again!

Great easy way to cook perfect potatoes. I used some old bay spice too as I like it on potatoes.

These potatoes are tender and delicious!  I made these as is first and then for a summer Bbq I added some extra flair by grilling skin side up first and then when I flipped them, topped with some chopped, cooked bacon and cheese and served with sour cream that I mixed with lime and chives.  To do so, I scooped a small well in the flesh side after baking and halving to hold the bacon and cheese on the grill!

This is a great technique for grilling russet potatoes. I used the advice of some reviewers and brushed on olive oil and salt and pepper seasoning after halving the potatoes, and that resulted in a crispy exterior, skin included. Will use this technique again and again!!

Loved this recipe.  Making again today for a family BBQ.  We just added toppings we like (cheese, bacon bits, sour cream, and green onion) right on top, then picked up and enjoyed!  Good recipe for a young cook too.

A great way to finish baked potatoes when grilling. We have done the microwave and oven combination to speed up the process for many years, but finishing it in the grill when you already have it running was awesome. I did coat the entire potatoes halves with olive oil and sprinkled with kosher salt and pepper. Really did not need any butter or sour creme added!

I love it my way too!!!!   Just add a pressed garlic to the olive oil!  I promise you will never have it plain again!
I also, slice a potato in 4 long strips to speed up the cooking process.  Enjoy!

These are excellent and easy to make. Be sure to use the microwaving times as only a guideline, as the size of russett potatoes can vary a great deal. The potatoes should be essentially cooked before you put them on the grill to crisp up and brown. You don't nedd  as much oil as is in  the recipe if you use a basting brush. Variations of this recipe using  seasoned salt or lemon  pepper would be delicious too. Thanks!

I have been making these for over 30 years and still a family favorite. To spice it up a notch, I add onion powder, garlic powder and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and serve with ranch dressing. Out of this world delicious!

Nice and simple! I liked these a lot because they didn't take a lot of time to make and it's made with ingredients that are always in my pantry. I would slice the potatoes into 1/2 inch discs and grill as directed. Less cooking time and you get crispier potatoes. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wonderful summer flavor on these! Mine were already completely cooked though after the first 5 minutes in the microwave so I did not add additional time. We put these in a foil "boat" to get the grill flavor without the worry they would fall apart on the grill. The flavor on this was awesome! We only grilled them in the foil pouch for 12 min while the meat was cooking since they were already done.

What we have found that makes this recipe even better is, instead of using olive oil, we marinate them with Wishbone Italian dressing. It really gives them a great sweet and zesty flavor.

I made these for dinner tonight to serve as a side with blackened salmon and fried corn. YUM! I did marinate them in a light balsamic vinaigrette for 2 hours before grilling them and no additional seasoning was required. Thanks for submitting such an easy recipe. A nice change from plain old baked potatoes.

Cut them into chunks leaving skin on before putting them in the microwave for a bit. Lots of EVO and added Keg seasoning, S&P! Amazing. Thanks for the recipe. The only thing is I didn't end up making enough as they were such a hit!!

Followed recipe exactly as written. I did take the advice of the writer and put olive oil, salt and pepper on skin as well as on the top. Olive oil provided a nice crisp to the potato. Will definitely make this again during the hot Summer months. Topped my potato with a dollop of sour cream. Nice!

These were terrific. I had marinaded some sirloin tips and right before they went on the grill I realized I hadn't even thought of a side dish. Fortunately I had seen this recipe earlier today and not only did it save the meal, those spuds were dang good! Next time I may try to ramp up the flavor a bit, but they were very tasty with just the oil, salt & pepper. Thanks for a very easy & delicious recipe.

Easy, sure, but not all that quick. With 3 microwave cycles plus grilling, that's a lot of tending for potatoes. They came out too dry and very bland. Perhaps a heavier hand with the salt would have helped. Quartering small potatoes, tossing in evoo, salt, pepper and herbs of choice then roasting in a grill basket is just as fast/easy and yields better results.  It seems like a good concept, but I won't be making these again.

These are the best!!  Okay, so my kids don't like the skins but I love them so much that I make them anyway and peel the skins off after for the kids.  I'm gonna try taking them camping, I'm thinking cooking in the microwave beforehand???   THESE ARE GREAT!!!

These were really good.  The seasoning needs to be more than just the s&p IMHO, but other than that, it was a great (and different) way to have potatoes!  I sliced ours thick and grilled both sides, like others recommended, and seasoned them up well.  They were great with our steaks and corn on the cob!

We love these potatoes.  I usually slice the potatoes in four - six slices, rather than just in half.  We like the toasty grilled flavor on both sides of the potato.  We serve with a variety of toppings or plain depending on the rest of the meal.  Yummy!

My husband made these to go along with some grilled pork tenderloin and they were really good.  He didn't cut them lengthwise, but instead cut them into very large chunks, tossed in olive oil, seasoning salt and pepper...then grilled.  The end result was pretty yummy (especially when you don't want to heat up the house!)
