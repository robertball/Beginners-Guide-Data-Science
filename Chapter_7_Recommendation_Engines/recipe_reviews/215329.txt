OMG! My niece went crazy for these and so did the other kids - I guess that's why I now claim the title of favorite Aunt! These are so good and the possibilities are endless in terms of what you stick on these. I added some coconut along with the chopped nuts but the kids loved the assortment of rice krispies, dried fruit, M&M's, and colored sprinkles!

These are so amazing!  Didn't have popsicle sticks so I just cut the bananas in 4 pieces each.  Dipped in dark chocolate.  The chocolate froze too fast to put the nuts (I used cashews) on, so the next time I made it I mixed the chocolate and nuts before dipping banana pieces.  Also read somewhere that you should use really ripe bananas, that way the banana flavour is really apparent.

Oh yum! I'm always trying to find healthy desserts for my significant other who every now and then gets a hankering for something sweet. These are SO good and you're right Kelsey, there are so many possibilities to experiment with. For a lighter and more refreshing treat, I also dipped the banana's into yogurt and rolled in a healthy cereal. Guilt free and delicious. Thank you Kelsey!

I've always wanted to try this. I wouldn't have thought to freeze bananas first, so thanks!   I changed it up to make it easier for myself. I used 1/2 a bag of mini baking chocolate chips with 2 tablespoons of crisco shortening. Melt in microwave in 30 seconds, stir and put back in microwave for another 30 seconds at 70%. Just stir until it's all melted.  I also cut the banana in quarters rather than half for a quick treat. They were frozen within an hour.  FYI..definately use bananas that are still yellow and slightly green. Anything more or less will not have as pleasant a taste or texture.

I remember having something like this as a kid, and liking it. That's what made me do a search for frozen banana treats. But based on this recipe, I'd have to say I'm not a semisweet chocolate kinda gal. I would try milk chocolate next time. The peanut butter was very messy to apply to the frozen bananas. I'm thinking melting the peanut butter and milk chocolate together might be the way to go. Or using nutella, like others mentioned, would be good. However, they were also very difficult to eat. Admittedly, I didn't have them on popsicle sticks--they were just little chunks of banana. But the frozen bananas were rock solid. I ate a few that way, then tried thawing them for a bit, but then they got all mushy and kinda gross. I guess this isn't the recipe for me. Thanks for sharing. I'm glad others love it!

This literally is one of those clean-out-your-cupboards summer treats. You can use any kind of chips, you can use Nutella instead of peanut butter, and you can roll it in just about anything. Nuts, sprinkles, granola, cereal.....the skies the limit! Great treat to make with your kids.

OH MY GOODNESS! These are amazing! I make them up every other day in the summer and they're gone before I know it! I have condensed the recipie to just slicing an banana, putting a glob of Kraft extra creamy peanutbutter on the top, and freezing but you can get as fancy as you would like! Tastes the best with bananas that have small brown speckles on them! Anyways, I was unsure about freezing bananas and eating them but these are just delicious! Great for a hot summer afternoon! MODIFICATION: try with peanutbutter mixed with honey rolled in crushed dad's oatmeal cookies. It's AMAZING!

These are terrific.  I ended up putting a layer of Nutella over the frozen peanut butter layer (instead of the melted chocolate chips) and sprinkling the bananas with chopped, salted peanuts.  I didn't have any sticks so I just wrapped them individually in wax paper.  So good!

Yum!  Kids and parents loved these.  I didn't want to use peanut butter b/c of allergies so I used Nutella, then I realized that it didn't even need the chocolate over.  Just bananas and nutella.  Really tasty!

These are so tasty! Reminds me of the frozen bananas you got at the fair as a kid. Made these with a ton of bananas we had on hand and I keep them in the freezer for quick snacks/or dessert time on warm days. I sometimes add shredded toasted coconut, chopped up reese's peanut butter cup or even drizzle white chocolate on them. Anyway you make them, they are outstanding! my husband and nephew love them!

This recipe didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped. I was unable to melt the chocolate in a container in boiling water, and in the end I had to use a microwave. I also had to add water in order for it to be usable for dipping. In addition, the chocolate would not cover the bottoms of the frozen bananas, so I ended up dipping the peanut butter side into the chocolate and coating that with chopped peanuts.

The snacks tasted alright, but they weren't spectacular. And the main picture is a very misleading representation of the recipe. I personally halved the bananas horizontally and then cut those pieces into quarters.

I didn't have peanut butter on hand, but the process was spot on. If I had the bananas in the freezer for some time (say overnight), when I rolled the banana in the chocolate, it would freeze very quickly so I couldn't add the nuts. I would recommend only freezing the bananas for a few hours before adding the chocolate to avoid this issue if you want to add toppings (or add a quick coating of chocolate and roll in the toppings very quickly once the banana is thoroughly coated). Good even with just the banana and chocolate!

This is a quick and tasty treat!  I cheated and used melted peanut butter chips, dipping half the banana in chocolate and then half in the peanut butter with a final roll in the chopped nuts.  It was delicious!

I wanted to make these frozen bananas into ghosts for Halloween, so I followed the directions but dipped them in white chocolate. I also just rolled the back side in the crushed peanuts and then used mini chocolate chips for the eyes and mouth.

Better to use good quality dark chocolate.  Also, they really need salt, so I added crushed up pretzels and fleur de sel.  Yummy, and good for dairy-free peeps!

This recipe was awesome for my overripe bananas, I sliced them into chunks, froze them overnight, and then the next day coated them in chocolate. I mixed 1/2 bag of semisweet chocolate chips with 2 TBSP of coconut oil in a saucepan on the oven then stirred in the chunks. The coconut oil made the chocolate easier to spread, and tastes amazing!
