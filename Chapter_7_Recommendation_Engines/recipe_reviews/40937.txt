Darn good--I made it for a birthday party at the last minute and now the birthday girl is using it for her friends' birthday party...and so on...EDIT: I suggest adding a few drops of mint extract to this pie when mixing the ingredients.  It adds a nice minty kick to the taste that the cookies just don't achieve.  The texture of the cookies, the cream cheese mixture and the added mint make it anything but bland.

I don't know what I like better...how it tastes, how easy it is to make, or how it looks. A fantastic recipe. The chocolate-mint taste can't be beat. (Add a little more food coloring than the recipe calls for to achieve a green color -- I found the three drops didn't do a lot.)

I was very excited to try this recipe . . . and very disappointed with its outcome.  The cream cheese overtook this pie.

I thought this recipe was ok but it is very heavy and rich.  I thought it tasted a bit bland.

I made this pie for a holiday dinner and everybody loved it. I have been asked to make it again, as well as for the recipe. It is really easy and worth the effort. I highly recomend giving it a try.

this pie is super easy and delicious. I made it for a few of my holiday parties and I got many compliments. The only thing I would suggest is to add a few more drops of green food coloring, other than that this pie is great!

I make a lot of desserts and my dad is always the one with a good word--he is my dad after all--but for this pie, my dad said it was one of my best--and that means a lot!  It is so simple to make, yet so delicious too.  I actually froze the pie and it was wonderful.
