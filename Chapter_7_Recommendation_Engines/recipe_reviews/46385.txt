The flavor of this dish is good, I however had the same issue as other reviewers with the cook time.  At 25 minutes it was not done so I added another 15.  After the dish sat for 10 minutes while I served and got everyone to the table it was over cooked.  I would recommend you undercook the dish slightly and let it sit.

I have made this recipe twice and it was excellent both times.  Lighter than the usual egg and sausage breakfast casseroles.  Ham and asparagus worked well in place of chicken and broccoli.  One hint I would offer when making this for the first time:  I found that the amount of food that goes into this dish didn't fit in a medium size mixing bowl or baking dish as suggested in the recipe.  I used a large mixing bowl and a 9x13 baking pan.

Way too many eggs!  It took a lot longer to cook than the recipe said.  It was more like 50 minutes.  It tasted ok (nothing special, a little bland, but eatable), but the preparation took so long it wasn't worth it.

Easy and tasty -- very easy way to use leftovers and serve a filling brunch to a lot of people. 

I omitted the mushrooms, used leftover baked potatoes and broccoli, and added some frozen spinach.

I made enough for about 12 people and put it in two pans to bake. It took about 35 minutes and I had to turn the oven up (although my oven temp may have been inaccurate.)

I was also concerned that this dish might be bland, and do wish that I had added a little salt and pepper to the eggs before pouring them over the solid mixture.  Without that, though, it was actually pretty flavorful, but I did a couple of things a little differently from the recipe.  Used olive oil instead of butter and only a teaspoon.  I also used celery root instead of potatoes.  That, in itself, really makes this an amazing dish.  The other thing I did was add about an ounce of a combination of fresh herbs -- thyme, oregano, and rosemary.  This was definitely a dish to make again, but leave yourself some time.  The other reviewers were right about this taking longer than 25 minutes to make.  I baked mine at 400 degrees but it took 55 minutes before it was finished.

I anticipated that it might be bland so I added about 1.5 Tbsp of thyme and a few shakes of hot sauce.  I'm glad I did. Baking time 50 - 55 minutes.

Takes 55 minutes to bake, so plan accordingly.  I made without the chicken (vegetarian) and it was great.  This recipe goes into a cake pan-size baking dish, so make sure you have enough mouths when you make it.  Really Good!

I halfed the ingredients as only two of us will eat this creation. The potaoes were omitted, for me it's just a little much.  I used chicken and a little breakfast sausage because all the reviews have additional seasonings listed.  This took about 40 minutes to cook.

This is a good recipe, but i like to add tons of random spices and start mine on the stove.

I experienced the same timing problem when baking the frittata.  50 minutes was a good time.  I can confirm that you will need a large bowl to mix everything together and the cake pan is also a good idea.  I thought the dish was very delicious and so did my husband but we also used a fully cooked and marinated sundried tomato and basil turkey breast instead of the chicken and that gave it a wonderful flavor.

I cut this recipe I half and used rice instead of potatoes. My husband loved it - will ace it again.  It does need some salt and pepper, even with the salt from the cheese.

I decided to make a breakfast frittata for the first time. I used the basic recipe substituting ham, cooked tater tots, kale, peppers, mushrooms, onion, sun dried tomatoes and fresh basil and garlic. For the cheese I used 1cup herbed goat cheese and 1 cup four cheese blend. Before putting in oven I sprinkled four cheese and smoked paprika on top. Baked for 35 min. This is an awesome recipe. Can't wait to try with leftover chicken for dinner.

Made this dish for 4 servings in a skillet. Instead of chicken I used cooked portugese sausage, and asparagus. I saut√©ed the mushrooms, onions, and asparagus, allowing them to steam a little before adding to the large bowl to mix. I added the cheese last so it wouldn't stick to the sides of the bowl. I think I should have drained the juices from the veggies but didn't want to lose the flavor so the next time I may cut some of the milk. I would also increase the cheese amount as well, maybe mix up the types of cheese. The recipe was also a little bland. I added pepper later and the dish was delicious topped with salsa. The cooking time was also off. I cooked it for maybe about 40 min. Overall, definitely a keeper with some tweaking here and there.

I made this recipe last night.  I added another cup of broccoli and baked it in a lasagna pan.  I also added more salt and pepper threw in some leftover sausage diced up.  I added 15 minutes to the cooking time and it came out very good.  It was even better the second night.  Next time I will add garlic to the boiling potatoes and some fresh herbs to the saute pan.

I didn't enjoy this dish at all, there were way too many potatoes and the broccoli made it taste funny. The whole eggs idea was good , but I used less than on the recipe and it still took forever to bake.

Recipe was only ok - My husband and I found it pretty bland, but not terrible.
