I am the original submitter of this recipe.  THE RECIPE WAS SUBMITTED WITH USE ONE CUP OF WATER, ADDING A LITTLE MORE AT A TIME AS NEEDED ~ These dog biscuits require the use of Wheat flour which some dogs are sensitive to, if so its so easy to modify this recipe, simply substitute one cup of wheat flour for 1-1/4 cup of rye or oat flour or ¾ cup, rice, barley or potato flour.

They must taste really good because my dog loves them, however, the dough was super sticky and I never did get it to the point of being able to roll it like cookie dough. I even added more flour.I just had to drop the dough on the cookie sheet and press each one down to make them somewhat flat.  Also, they didn't get as hard as the recipe noted.- I followed the recipe exactly.

The treats are excellent, and our dog loves them.  However, as noted by several reviewers, the amount of liquid appears excessive.  I would recommend starting out with one cup of water, then adding more as needed to bring the dough to a consistency for kneading and cutting.

Oh my gosh, I've never seen my doggies dance and beg sooo much then right after they ate their first cookie from this recipe!  These were a huge hit!!!!  ---FYI:  the dough will be really sticky.  Don't stick your hands in it to knead it.  I did that and it was a mistake!  What you want to do is flour a surface, put the dough on that surface, sprinkle some more flour over the dough, rub some on your hands and then try to knead it or just roll it with a rolling pin.  That works much much better :)

Haven't made these but something similar. You can sweeten with dates too. I would use about 2 to 4 dried, fine chopped dates in this recipe. They are great for your hound because they are packed with minerals and vitamins. My girls like just eating dates too for a treat.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe.  The dough came out VERY sticky, and after baking and drying the treats, my dog really wasn't too impressed with them.  It was a good idea, but a bad recipe.
There is a peanut butter/banana treat recipe here that is MUCH better.

It’s too sticky. The author made a change under comments but it was already too late for me. Please change the actual recipe so no one else wastes all of these ingredients.

Recipe is great , however would anyone know the storage details on these biscuits? How long I can keep in the fridge/freezer in an air tight container ?  I will be making a large batch in advance and wanted to know how long they stay fresh etc

My puppies loved these treats. Next time I will start with just one cup of water and add more as needed. I added a little peanut butter to mine and they turned out great. I will be making these again.

Even after adding an ADDITIONAL 1 1/2 cups of flour it was still sticking to EVERYTHING.
Finally I ended up just grabbing a spoon and dropping blobs onto a cookie sheet with foil on it.(which of course it stuck to as well)
Granted the pups did like them, but too messy to make again.

My dogs LOVE these.   Since they aren't smart enough to know if they are special shapes. ...I just pressed dough intocookie sheet,  and then at the end...broke Iinto enough pieces to fill a 1 gallon zip loc bag.  Dogs are sitting by baggy, hoping for more

Amazing!!!! My dog and the neighbor's dog loved them!!!!. I agree with the rest though, the dough was really hard to work with. The next time I do this I will only add 1Cup of water. Other than that very good!! My dog loves it when I put peanut butter on them.

The dough is waaay to sticky, used a entire bag of organic wheat flour and wound up throwing away the entire mix. I see where the original submitter says to use 1 cup of water....ummmm...too late! You should remove this recipe and re-post with the correct measurements. What a waste of time and money.

I made the recipe without reading the reviews. Please edit the recipe to read what you meant about the amount of water. I was making these to sell and it's a mess. Thanks!

To preface this: PLEASE read TheBritishBaker's review before making these!

My dog goes crazy over these. They didn't take nearly as long to bake as the recipe suggests, so that was nice. The dough was incredibly sticky and was only workable after adding around 6 cups of flour and refrigerating it for a few hours. They're easy to make (like most dog treats) and, even though I didn't expect my dog to like them because she isn't a huge fan of banana, she really likes them! I feel this recipe could be a lot easier if it's done without as much water.

Generally, I read reviews before cooking, but did not this time.  I guess I'm not sure why they haven't edited the recipe, so that people don't keep having problems with it.  I attempted to solve the problem by adding a bunch of oats, but still, the batter was much too moist to roll.  Instead, I dropped the batter by the teaspoon, as you would with cookies.  They turned out fine, and of course my dogs think they're great!

These were sticky initially when I put them onto my floured counter, so I added another 2 cups of flour as I worked the dough, then I made sure my counter was well floured before I rolled these out...the dogs loved these.

First- Mixing. It took the better half of an hour mixing and mixing and mixing, because every time you really get into the dough, it gets wrapped like cotton candy on the mixer sticks. I had to use a lower setting in the end- it rode up the mixer to the top in under 10 seconds otherwise.

I read where the recipe meant to have one cup of water, with what is needed after, so I did do that and all, but it was still horrible to knead. 

After spending about 30 minutes nonstop kneading and adding flour, over and over, the majority of the time with dough stuck all over my palms and fingers, it finally seemed unsticky.

Went to tearing it into the right pieces, making sure it was the right thickness, ect, ect. Turns out, I needed to add about a quarter cup of flour more just so I could push it down without it lifting right back up.

Finally, the sweet relief of putting it in the oven and taking a seat.

They soon came out, more like really dry, tough bread than anything else. I attempted to fix this by letting butter melt on them to at least make them edible.

Before and after my attempt to salvage, my pooch turned up her head at it. In fact, before my attempt to salvage, she snorted at them before walking away.

So- this was a total fail. The only possible reason I suspect this could have failed of my own choice is if for some reason raw honey doesn't work, because I used raw wildflower honey (but now I regret using my best honey.) I had high hopes, but in the end, I'll advise you

Using 1C of water, this recipe made an easy to work dough that baked up nicely.  I did sub 1C of ground oats for part of the wheat flour, just to add a little different flavor/texture.  At a picnic attended by many dogs, about half really liked these treats.  On the plus side, my very picky dog actually liked these, but then she does like bananas.  I'd probably try adding some peanut butter next time, or maybe another banana and reduce the water a bit, to give it a little more flavor.  I did eat part of one and tasted like a very dense wheat bread with a faint flavor of honey and banana.

My dogs love these. They now reject store-bought and specialty vet treats for these. Unfortunately I use tedious small dog bone cookie cutters which are time consuming. But the dogs' enthusiasm for them keeps me baking.

I made it twice so far.   Dogs love them.  I cut back to 1 cup of water.  Not as sticky and easy to work with.  I keep them in the refrigerator after cooling off.

Like other reviewers, I made the recipe before reading the reviews. My dough was very sticky, but I kept adding flour until I could roll it out. One cup of water next time! I found the treats baked beautifully, and the baking powder made them puffy.It's a very simple recipe, and I will definitely try it again!

Our dog enjoyed these and it was a great way to use bananas.  I found these difficult to cut out and work with and would adjust next time to make them easier to cut out.

I added extra flour everytime the dough started sticking to my counter. When I gave the treats to my dog she didn't seem too impressed by them.

After I found the post from the author to use 1c of water instead of 2, life is amazing!!!  Doggies smell them baking and want them fresh out of the oven (too hot though).

Would be five stars had the recipe itself said to use only ONE cup of water and then water as needed.  Unfortunately, I only read the reviews AFTER I made them and had to use twice the flour to make it usable.  Other than that, they are excellent and my doggies (all four) love them!

My dogs love these!! My bigger dog is kinda picky when it comes to treats but I just broke one in half so he could smell it and he loved it. I didn't have any honey so I replaced with peanut butter, it was even better in my opinion!! It smelled like wheat, peanut butter, and banana. Super good!!!

I followed the recipe before reading the comments, I'm 14 and I made these for my big babies. Lol, They loved them, But it took forever to get the sticky dough dry, which I actually did! (3 cups of flour later) I think the taste isn't as strong as it would've been, But it's fine, I added a scoop of peanut butter and placed a long strip of dough onto the tinfoil and then plenty of little strips across (like a rolled bone) And as it was browning, I added some butter on top. The dogs REALLY enjoy these, Thanks! :)

These turned out OK. I baked them on a lower setting for 20 minutes, then moved them to the suggested setting for 10. They crisped great, which was good because I had already made soft treats to put in a gift basket. I didn't have any vanilla, which is fine because I'm not sure if their dogs like it. The only thing I would change is the flour to water ratio. The mixture was very sticky and I had to add several more cups of flour.

I did as one review said and used only one cup of water.  Turned out great. I can see that two cups of water would be a real problem.

Mine were sticky too. But as I took the batter out of the mixing bowl I kneaded in more flour and they were fine.  My Bassetts love them.

Well... I am NOT a cook by any means, never even made dough before!  My wife asked me to dig my heals in and learn,  so I did it and the only thing I would do differently is less water.  Other then that,  it was really really easy and shortly after the dogs were seating by the counter wondering when they get to taste test em..needless to say they loved them.  TY :)

I added 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the recipe and only used 1 1/2 cups + a little more of water. I would add the water gradually to the mixture after adding all other ingredients. My poochies loved it! Just needs some adjustments. I am a regular baker and know that each recipe can vary. The texture, size and ripeness of the bananas will +/- moisture and this will determine how much water you need to add. Other than that, great recipe!!  Hope this helps! :)

The dough was a little hard to manage, but we kneaded the dough in small portions while we added flour. We also put the dough in the fridge which also helped. Although the cookies were a little dry the dogs loved it.

These were so much fun to make.  I made a double batch and bagged them for each of the neighborhood pups for Christmas.  I've been asked several times for the recipe so I know they were a hit.  My 2 Boston Terriers loved them.  I rolled them a bit thinner and used a very small, bone-shaped cutter.  Adorable!

This recipe is super easy and makes TONS of treats...DOZENS.  I used the recipe for neighbor Christmas gifts.  The only problem I found was the same as everyone else.  I only used half of the water the recipe called for and it was still too wet.  But I just kept added flour as I kneaded the dough and they came out perfect.  i will definitely use this recipe over and over.
