I typically don't give 5 stars to recipes that I tweak a bit but this was incredible.  I followed a few suggestions and changed the following:  used whole wheat penne  (store didn't have ziti), halved the cream cheese and added sour cream, chopped the veggies, and added pasta water and chicken broth as others recommended.  I also made my own taco seasoning (recipe can be found on this site).  Will definitely make again.

I switched out half of the cream cheese for sour cream and left the salsa out as well. It was delicious!

OH! MY! GOD!
This is so good! I followed the recipe, changing very little of it. I used a ready-made fajita mix though. Other than that, I stayed true to what was posted.

This was a hit with myself and my spouse. We ate on it for 2 days, I took a serving to work twice, and we still have a little left in the freezer.

I'd recommend this to any chicken fajita lover.

We loved this dish. Even my picky husband :) Made exactly as written with one addition: I added 1 1/2 - 2 cups of the pasta water to avoid it becoming to pasty. This worked perfectly.  I'll def. be making this again! Thanks for sharing.

Everyone, especially my 2 boys, loved this. As reviews suggested I added chicken broth and mixed 8oz of sour cream with just 8oz of cream cheese. My family couldn’t get enough. Will definitely make again. Possibly with beef...my kids idea.

It was so delicious!! I made it weight watchers friendly so I used 1/3 fat cream cheese and fat free cheddar cheese. Only 6 smart points per serving and it’s a huge portion!! I will definitely make this often and I’m probably going to freeze some because it’s a lot of food.

Very good meal, made it for dinner. I followed the instructions to the T, but for a personal reference I'm going to be taking a few items out. Overall my fiance and I enjoyed cooking this dish together, fill us up.

A staple in our house. Thank you for posting this. I cover with foil for 20 minutes add extra cheese then uncover for 10. Also, I chop onions and green pepper. We love this recipe.

This is my second time making it. Last time it was a little dry to reheat, so I added about 3/4 cup of reserved starch water from cooking the pasta. It made it perfect! The one thing to keep in mind about this recipe, however, is that it makes a LOT. Like a full 9 x 13 pan lot.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious but I found it a little dry. Typically I read the reviews before making but for some reason I didn’t with this recipe-therefore I missed all the comments about adding chicken broth or pasta water. I divided it between 2 casserole dishes-baked one and froze the other one unbaked for later-yes, it makes a lot! ***update-I heated up the leftovers I added some milk-was very moist.

So delicious and filling!  Just the right amount of spice for my family's taste.  The only change I made was substituting 2 Neufchâtel cheeses for the cream cheeses.  Couldn't tell it was a lighter version.  Will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for sharing!!

this was fantastic. I made half the recipe as other reviewer's advised it made double the amount stated.  the only thing I didn't like it seemed to have too much peppers with green pepper already being in the salsa I used.  next time I'll only add a fraction of the amount if bell pepper is in my salsa. I did half cream cheese half sour cream like others.  and also added a cup of chicken broth once in the dish. I didn't cook my noodles before hand. I like the texture more firm. noodles cooked prior to baking seem too mushy for me. used ridge ziti. over all it was a great dish and we will be making again but with less pepper . oh and I think I will try fajita seasoning next time.

Awesome flavors! I didn’t have all ingredients so substituted ziti with egg noodles, chicken with ground turkey, and used green tomatillo salsa... it tastes SO GOOD!!!  I also split cream cheese with sour cream as suggested by others.  Try this and you will love it!

Me and my mother just loved this dish, the only tweeks I made the second time we're that I added about a 1/4 cup more cream cheese to get the sauce right. I also used a half of can extra of the corn and black beans. I recommend On the Border Salsa with this. Another good point of the recipe is the quantity of the food made, left-overs for days :) I'm also thinking of adding a twist of lime to sauce to zest it up.

Made this for dinner tonight, it was very good and hubby liked it so it's a keeper. The only change I made was adding some chicken broth as suggested by other reviewers. It was a bit dry on top when I removed it from the oven after first twenty minutes, especially the pasta. I think covering with foil would help with that and leave uncovered after topping with the cheese. Great Mexican Casserole with great flavor. I can see this being one of my go to recipes for a quick easy dinner for family and friends.

Followed directions verbatim, however, it turned out dry. My suggestion would be to add extra salsa. Also, this recipe made almost two large baking pans worth of food, which I wasn’t expecting. Definitely a good large quantity recipe.

At first glance this dish doesn’t look like much but wow! Once that sauce is incorporated...IT...IS...AMAZING! I made the recipe exactly as written. It does make a lot so I was actually able to get two meals out of it, which is a plus with a family of 6!

This was a HIT!! I added green onions and 86'd the corn. I also used coconut oil in place of the regular oil. I added a variety of seasonings including thyme, seasoning salt, cumin, and oregano on the chicken while cooking to give it some extra flavor. My 2 year old daughter ate every bite. This was easy and quick and with a side of steamed brocolli it was a Perfect balanced weekday dinner!!

Was very good! I will try fajita seasoning next time. May add some black olives as well. It was great just as it is, or you can add extras to fit your taste. I will be making this again. Oh and I love how much it made, I was worried I would have to double it, but I only doubled the meat. My husband loves a lot of meat, and since its chicken breast a little extra won't hurt.

I told my wife about the recipe a couple days ago, and she was eager for me to make it. Tonight was the night, and it was a hit with the family. My wife suggested adding more peppers to the recipe, and I feel that some more liquid would have made the dish less dry.

Husband and I thought this was delicious!
I used all the ingredients it called for except I used home made taco seasoning and home made salsa, which I had canned. I only had red bell pepper from my garden instead of green pepper so that was what I used. I used a little more then 2 Tbl. of seasoning and some seasoned salt (the homemade taco seasoning didn't have salt in it) and  I used almost a pint jar of the salsa. I did shred the chicken  (2 chicken breasts which I poached first) instead of cutting it in pieces, we just prefer it that way, and I used egg noodles which I measured out to weigh 8 oz. and even that made a lot! Can't imagine how much using 16 oz. would have made, seems like it would have been drier using that much.
I only left it in the oven about 20 min. since everything was already cooked beforehand
I did crumble a little bit of tortilla chips on top  but they are probably soggy by now so that wasn't needed. Next time I may add a little sour cream as my husband put a little bit on his but he said it probably didn't need any. 
Definitely a keeper.

Completely fantastic. My boyfriend doesn’t like creamy cheese sauce so I thinned it out with a half cup of chicken broth in the cream cheese mix. There was so much left over for the two of us that I wish I had cut the recipe in half.

This was such a great recipe. I used lentil penne pasta and 8oz plain cream cheese and 8oz jalapeño cream cheese for a little extra zing. Definitely will make it again!!!

I followed the recipe. I can’t think of any way to make it any better. The sauce was delicious, I could eat it right out of the bowl. My family raves about it for days. I’ll make it again and again.

Very good and makes a ton! Maybe next time I'll add some black olives and a chipotle pepper, for variety, but it's quite nice as is.

I made this last night for dinner and my Hubby loved it. I made it with gluten free pasta and half cream cheese and  sour cream. I also added about 2 cups of pasta water to it.  He took leftovers for lunch today:) and froze the rest for future lunches.

I was a bit skeptical about trying this recipe as it requires salsa and black beans (not a fan of Mexican food)... oh how I am ecstatic that I put my skepticism aside and gave this recipe a try.... D E L I C I O U S ! ! !
Super easy, step-by-step instructions! 
THANK YOU for giving me something new to try!

I made no changes but the recipes makes a great deal of food. If you are cooking for 4 to 6 I would cut it in half. It is very good and satisfying.

This was very good.  Made a lot. I had frozen onion, with 3 pepper colors already sliced, so I used it instead of fresh.  I also used the Mexican three blended cheese, instead of the cheddar. Was going to try freezing up the extra.  I was told no, it wouldn’t last very long for that.  It’s a keeper recipe.  Will make it again in the future.

Yummy..I used whole wheat spaghetti broken in half, (from one of my Costco binges) and a can of fire roasted tomatoes salsa style since I didn't have a jar of salsa. Used a pkg of  McCormick's fajita SAUCE ( been sitting around for ages) and shredded Costco roast chicken.  Did add some pasta water and chicken broth to casserole as other reviewers had suggested along with 8 oz. cream cheese and 12 oz sour cream (so I wouldn't have to put 1/4 c back in refrig.). It was a hit!

Quite good and makes a ton. I made the recipe as written.  For those that like it spicier use a hot salsa or add hot sauce. I do think I will try a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chicken stock (as others suggested) next time just to thin out the consistency.  The only reason I made it a 4 star was it screams for acid. A bit of lime juice at the end may help. I topped with sour cream and fresh tomatoes when serving.

I halved the pasta and cream cheese and thought it was outstanding. My 9 year old didn’t like it as much but I’m going to keep making it because I think she’ll grow to like it more. I used garden banana peppers instead of onion and red, yellow and orange bell instead of green. I also used homemade taco seasoning to control the salt.

This is what I changed... I used 3lbs of chicken breast, used penne instead of ziti, omitted taco seasoning, corn and black beans and took other reviewers suggestions and used 8oz sour cream and 8oz cream cheese. I used olive oil to sauté my peppers and onion (I used two green peppers since my onions are really large) and sautéed them with 1tbsp of minced garlic (since I sautéed onions and peppers separately I ended up using 2tbsp of minced garlic). I also cooked my chicken breast differently as I needed a to make a stock so I was able to shred it as some reviewers had suggested they wished they had done. Also using the chicken in a stock helped keep it moist and full of flavor (my stock is seasoned so the chicken absorbed the seasonings). After I sautéed the veggies I added them to the stock to soften more and cook with the chicken. Because my chicken was seasoned from the stock I omitted the taco seasoning and my family is not too big on black beans and corn just seemed out of place. I also added 1 cup of my stock to the pasta as I was mixing everything together as some reviewers said that after baking it was dry. This made two 9 x 13 pans and was so delicious. Will definitely be making this again as it was a huge hit with my husband and brother and my 1 year old girls loved it.

Just made this tonight. Came out great. Followed others recommendations and added 1 cup of chicken broth and substituted 1 of the cream cheeses for sour cream. Personally I would have liked shredded chicken a wee bit more. Made full amount and will have another full meal in the freezer. Lots of dishes but worth it since we have a dishwasher.

This was good! I used a packet of fajita seasoning with a 1/4 cup of water to cook the chicken onions and peppers in. It gave an otherwise bland chicken a good kick and the flavors blended well with the rest of the dish. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe does make a lot. I’m thankful for that because I was able to give a pan to my mother, and her friends. The only substitutions I made were because I listened to other reviewers. I cut the cream cheese in half, and substituted it with sour cream. MY daughters don’t like to see Bell peppers, or onions, so I substituted it with the powders, and I didn’t use chicken broth. I substituted that with one 10.5 oz. can of cream of chicken. Definitely a family favorite!!!

I changed a few things and it turned out fantastic.  I used 1 - 8oz  cream cheese and 1 cup sour cream.  I omitted the beans and corn because my salsa had those ingredients.  Also added  milk to it for reheating.  It turned out as creamy as the first time.

Very good!  Made it with ground burger instead of chicken because it's what I had on hand but next time I will use chicken.  Family enjoyed this and said it's a keeper.

We only had half the amount of cheese so used 4oz in the bake and 4oz on top and was perfect. I would also use more salsa next time.

I used penne as I had no ziti. I thought this had too much cream cheese and insufficient corn. The beans added nothing to it. I will use less cream cheese and skip the beans next time. The taste did not justify the number of pots, pans, bowls, spatulas and spoons used. Microwaved the next day it tasted pastry. I give it 3 stars based upon potential. My taster, on the other hand, absolutely loved it. She gives it 5 stars and also suggests less cream cheese. She is concerned about the high caliber tie and carbohydrate content and suggests that once a year is sufficient. If it was healthier she would eat it more frequently. As it is she wants me to freeze the remainder in small portions.

I didn't have any ziti, so I used penne.  Other than that I followed the recipe as is.  Lots of pots and pans to clean up, but it was very tasty.

I did not have ziti pasta so I used  farfalle. I though it was going  to be to much pasta for sauce, so I added some more salsa. Next time I will use 2 peppers and 2 onions. This makes a lot had to send some home with my daughter and her family. Also sent some to sister and her boyfriend and had more than enough for husband and I.  Next time I will make half of recipe, This is a keeper and flavorful.

Great Recipe!  I was surprised how much I liked it.  It would make a great tailgating treat. I did swap some sour cream for half the cream cheese as suggested and also used homemade taco seasoning (I always keep extra made up).  I used veggie pasta which has an orange tinge so it really fit well with the fajita ingredients and also used red onion to be more authentic.

This was very delicious. Even my picky 8 year old enjoyed it. Did add the 1/2 cup pasta water that was recommended in other posts. Put garlic powder, salt, pepper and taco seasoning on the chicken before cooking it. Wouldn’t add other ingredients very good as is

Used store bought roasted chicken. Subbed yellow pepper for green. Would chop onions and peppers next time. And serve alongside extra fresh cut salsa, black olives and fresh avocados. Really good!

This was really yummy!  I made it according to the directions except for chopping the vegetables. I used a medium salsa, which gave it a perfect kick. Next time I might try using rotisserie chicken or ground beef just for some variety.  Will make again soon, for sure!! Makes a LOT.

Delicious! This is the second time I’ve made it. I cut the recipe in half since there are only three of us. I did use rotisserie chicken and added a bit of chicken broth, maybe 1/2 a cup, and left out onions and peppers because I was short on time. Can’t keep my fork out of it!

I didn’t do it exactly to recipe because I didn’t have enough of everything. Still came out great! Only used 1/2 the cream cheese & like 2/3 cheddar cheese.

Delicious comfort food that’s not too complicated. It actually uses more pans than I like, but was worth it. For ease of use, I purchased a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.

I used a red pepper instead of green and bacon fat instead of vegetable oil. I added 12 sliced black olives, tomato diced, and used both cheddar and american cheese. The american I added in the last 10 minutes. This was a quick and easy dish to prepare. I liked it because it was something different.

Made this exactly as the recipe said and it was a hit. Great flavors, quick, easy, and ingredients that most folks have on hand.

I forgot the bell peppers and onions but all is well! My stomach still enjoyed the meal. It's simple to make and baking on the extra cheese gives this dish some extra awesomeness.

I followed the recipe and added 2 cups of the pasta water as others have suggested to keep it moist. Tasted wonderful!

This was absolutely delicious! I made this for 7 adults and 3 kids and had leftovers only because it made so much! I also made cheese quesadilla's as a "side" which went perfectly. Everyone loved it! Only thing different is I did not add the whole can of black beans just because not everyone likes them so I limited them. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent dish.  My entire family loved it.  Took the suggestion from others and added 2 cups of pasta water,  I think it would of been to dry without it.  Great dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Served this to my card group and was asked for the recipe.  My changes were as follows, cut up a red and green pepper.  Used about 1 1/2 lbs of Costco  rotisserie chicken that is prepackaged, made a cup of chicken bouillon and added it to the sauce to thin it slightly, used a package of fajita seasoning mix.  I couldn’t find ziti, but used penne instead and also used the Mexican blend cheese.  My husband loved it as well.

Was a nice alternative to standard mac and cheese! Also served with tortilla chips and a green salad with Mexican flavor.

I have used this site for years. Suddenly when I am printing a recipe is cuts the lines on the right sides by 1 - 1.5 inches. Sometimes the same on the left side also. It only happens with ALL RECIPEES. com. I hope it gets fixed soon because this is not working for me.

This was an excellent, quick weeknight dinner that my whole family was able to enjoy.  All 3 kids (9,7,3) had seconds helpings.  It tasted even better the next day!

Made this tonight and it was DELICIOUS. We followed the recipe exactly except we poached and shredded the chicken. This is definitely a keeper. Next time we'll halve the recipe though because there is so much left!

Tween girl liked it so that says a lot. Tastes like comfort food. Could not give it 5 stars because I did not make it per recipe. (I did not have onion or pepper on hand so i just added extra salsa). Also used elbow macaroni instead of ziti.

This recipe was phenomenal!  I followed the recipe exactly as written (well, except for the shredded cheese - I only used half because I misread the amount & didn't buy enough at the grocery store!).  Oh, and I used a homemade taco seasoning mix instead of a store bought package.  Husband and I both loved it so I will definitely be making again....it's a keeper!

I halved the recipe, because we're a small family. I forgot to half the taco seasoning, but it turned out that the family loved it spicy. Will definitely make it again. (Full recipe would feed 10 people easily.)

My 13 year old and spouse really enjoyed this dish and it was quick to put together!   I will definitely make this again.  I followed the recipe as written except for adding a cup of chicken broth floor moisture--great recipe!
