7.18.16   I’ve waited for two days to be fair in giving this recipe a review.  I’m a lover of beets, my hubby not so much, so these pickled beets were made for me!  I’m trying to watch my sugar intake these days, so I did substitute Truvia® which worked perfectly fine.  I did put in the whole cloves, but the potent vinegar overpowered that flavor, so if you’re interested in a subtle clove flavor, definitely add more than the recipe indicates.  I really didn’t leave these in the jar, seemed just as easy to put them in a bowl, add the vinegar mixture & cloves and put a lid on them.   I did add some sliced onions to the mixture after I took the photo which is something that my mother always did. Maybe there is a typo in this recipe, but one can of beets will not yield 12 servings???  Pickled beets certainly are not rocket science, but these were very good, very easy and. perhaps, just a little too sweet for my palate (personal taste preference), but I still enjoyed them.

Best beets ever! However I did add a cinnamon stick per jar and mustard seeds....I love cinnamon and it's a great anti-inflammatory. Also used my own beets from the garden, of course cooked and ready to use. Next time a will cut back on vinegar or add a quarter cup water to each jar.....just a tad bit tart.....
