I wanted to make this lighter--I used 11 ounces of nonfat plain greek yogurt and made up the remaining ounces of half reduced fat mayonnaise and reduced fat sour cream. I also used homemade dry ranch seasoning mix. I made this last night as I wanted it to have time to sit and really "bloom" before I dug into it. I couldn't even tell that it was lowfat. AMAZING. I can't stop eating it. This is my new favorite ranch dip recipe.

This has quickly become a favorite.  The dip is good for chips or vegetables, or you can even use it on sandwiches and tacos.  In a pinch, you can make it without cilantro and it will still taste good.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it rated 5 stars "as is", but I have a few changes that I prefer:
1) Double the jalapeno!
2) Use half the dressing mix.
3) Substitute 1 clove fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder.

My garden is overflowing with jalapenos, so I was looking for a new way to use them. This recipe is super quick and easy! 

I followed the recipe exactly (used low fat sour cream and the generic store brand ranch mix) and the longer I let it sit, the better it got. Right after I made it, I wasn't that impressed with the taste (tasted pretty much like ranch dip), but I just tried it again five hours later and the flavors are really improving! I can really taste the jalapeno and the cilantro now. I love spicy food and would say the heat is about a 3 on a scale of 1-10.  Next time I will use fresh garlic instead of powdered.

Definitely make this a day ahead of time to get the best flavor.

AWESOME!!  Reminds me of the dip Chuys in Texas makes.  I recommend using fresh garlic instead of the powder or do fresh and powder garlic.  I also blend it in my blender!!!! LOVE IT!  Thanks for sharing:)

I added some chopped fresh green chiles, a couple of pinches of salt, subbed minced garlic for powder, added a squirt or two of lemon juice & served it w/ sliced red peppers, celery, baby carrots & sliced banana peppers. Great dip!

I did not have any sour cream or dry ranch but I did the following changes and it came out great: added 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of ranch salad dressing, garlic powder, 1/2 tablespoon canola oil, 2 tablespoons yogurt, increased the number of jalapenos (I used 6 small ones from my garden but I love very spicy food) and used about 8 pickled jalapeno slices. I'm giving this 5 stars because ever since having creamy jalapeno dressing at Chuy's in Texas, my wife and I have been in love with it. And I have been trying to re-create it.

This was delicous - I used 1/2 the ranch pack as others said and doubled up the peppers, we like it hot!  Yum Yum!

I was expecting a lot more from this recipe than I got. I used 3 WHOLE jalapenos (with seeds) and twice as much cilantro as called for. The ranch seasoning was WAY overpowering. I think next time I will use half a packet of the seasoning, use a habenaro for a kick. I also had to add about 3 tablespoons of flour because it was way too ruiny for cracker toppings. I loved the cool flabvor of the cilantro followed by the zing of the pepper.

If you are looking for a spicy dip, this isn't for you. Unless you add a few other peppers to give it the kick you are expecting.

Made this exactly according to the recipe. Had too much of the ranch dry mix taste, and was extremely runny.  Will not make again.

Great starting recipe that can be changed to your taste. I had Ranch dip instead of dressing mix, so I was sparing with it. Used about 2/3-3/4 of the package and it was plenty of flavor. Since we love cilantro, I used a FULL handful and it turned the dip a beautiful green speckle color. I omitted the garlic powder (even though I love garlic, I just wanted to cilantro and pepper flavor to shine). I used one habanero pepper (those things are spicy) and it gave it some amazing kick. We used this sauce to top our southern style eggs benedict (cornbread, roasted pork, fried egg). UNBELIEVABLE!!!

Very Yummy!  I think next time I will use one fresh whole jalapeno, rather than two.  Otherwise, I will make it again (and again!)  Thanks.

Good stuff! I used jarred, sliced peppers (the "mild" ones)and chopped them up. I went easy on the cilantro, as we don't like it unless it's in salsa. Other than that, followed exactly. Next time, I will leave the cilantro out. This recipe is a good way to jazz up ranch dip.

This is pretty good, and easy to make, too.  I decided to use Â½ of the package of ranch dressing, as we like less.  Yummy!

My wife loved this.  I thought the jalapeno got washed out with all the other stuff.  In my opinion, it needs the seeds left in, or more jalapeno.

So good and so easy!  I stirred in several tablespoons of a super hot garlicky salsa I had made the day before in place of the jalapenos and really enjoyed it.

I would recommend using half of the dressing packet as others have suggested. OK with vegetables, but tasted great on salmon.

Made this for an office party.  They loved it.  Thought 2 jalapenos would be a bit too hot, but it wasn't.  It was just right.  I served with ruffled chips, but corn chips would probably be good too.

Yummy!  I had to alter this dip a bit because, believe it or not, my grocery store didn't have fresh jalapeno peppers!  I used three whole from a jar--seeds and all.  I also used fresh garlic and Hidden Valley Ranch "Fiesta" dressing mix.  I added a couple of tablespoons of mayo, too.  This was sooo good that I never got around to eating it with veggies, because it was so delicious with tortilla chips!  I subsequently used it as a dressing for a salad that I brought to work, loaded with veggies and spinach, and it was great!

I am not crazy about spicy things, but this recipe was so easy to make, and my husband loved it. I brought it to work and everyone was ranting and raving about it. It is a great simple recipe. I have been coping this recipe for all of the ladies in the office.

Made as directed you really couldn't taste the jalapeno peppers so I added 1 more making total count to 3. This gives it a spicy taste up front and the heat in the back of the mouth. All other ingredients should be as directed.

This was good except it tasted more like a Hidden Valley Ranch dip with a taste of jalapeno rather than a jalapeno dip.  With so many other things to try, I will not be making this again.

Followed recipe but added one more jalapeno, and fresh garlic-not powder.  Way to soupy.  Could put it in a glass and drink it!

Every time I make this recipe it gets gobbled right up!  After several different times, I prefer to make it the night before so the flavors really have time to work together.  We like thinks spicy so I always leave the seeds and veins in the jalapenos and typically double the amount (depending upon who's coming for dinner).  One thing I learned the hard way: don't skip the food processor.  It's just not the same without it.

This is a very tasty dip.  It was a little runny but that is my only complaint.

We could drink this stuff! I doubled the recipe, and used half low fat sour cream, half non fat yogurt.  I also used a whole bunch of cilantro as we love the freshness.  We use this as a topping on enchiladas, tostadas, tacos, even on a simple lettuce and tomato salad with chunks of avocado.  A big family favorite!

I have never had a creamy jalapeno dip, so I had nothing to compare this to, but my husband LOVED it. I did not have any ranch packets, so I used my spicy ranch salad dressing and mixed with sour cream, followed rest of recipe. My husband ate all of it with tortilla chips and asked me to make more for him to take to work. Thanks for recipe!!

This was Okay.  I used 2 peppers and extra cilantro, but it still tasted like ranch dip with a little kick.  I will say that it tasted better the next day, but that's a lot of time to devote to a dip.  It was good, nothing great. Sorry.

The ranch dressing mix overpowered the other flavors even though I put twice as much cilantro as called for.  I was expecting more a jalapeno/cilantro taste but really just got a plain old ranch dip (with a little kick I must add!)  There are several restaurants in our area (we live in Texas) that serve a creamy jalapeno dip that is scrumptious, so I was hoping to replicate that -- this recipe just didn't do it for us.  The disposal had to eat most of it.

Great, easy!  A bit too much of a ZIP for young kids, but great flavor and aroma! Nice color too! Don't need to change a thing!

I tried this recipe at my sister in law's baby shower and loved it.  It took me a little longer than 10 minutes to prepare, but the results were outstanding and worth the wait.  YUM!!
