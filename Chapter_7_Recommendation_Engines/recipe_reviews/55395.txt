I made these twice.  First time, followed recipe and they came out heavy, doughy, and bland.  Next time, I added 2 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp sugar, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Much better and I would definitely recommend the baking powder.  All in all, a recipe for kids.

I was too curious not to try this.  I would describe this as more of a thick crepe (in taste and texture).  I did not have any problems with this being doughy, just take your time and don't scramble it, just slowly section it into pieces as each part starts to set up.  If you do not get in a rush, it will turn out just fine.  We enjoyed this with powdered sugar and "homemade pancake syrup" from this site.  Thanks for sharing this unusual breakfast  recipe.

This is a really simple and yummy recipe. I especially like it because it's not as messy as regular pancakes for my son. Some said it's bland, but so are most regular pancakes which makes it perfect for a variety of toppings. Also some people said it was doughy. It is a bit more dense then pancakes because of the eggs, but if you make sure to fully cook it till it starts to slightly brown, it should be firm vs. doughy. It's almost crepe like in flavor. My husband calls it pancake scramble.

This was different.  I don't know how else to explain it other than that.  I made it for my 10month old daughter, and she wasn't crazy about it.  I did not like it at all.  My fiance said it was all right, probably not something I'll make again.

My kids seemed to like it, but I couldn't get it to come out right. It stayed really doughy.

I made this recipe for breakfast this morning and my little guy gobbled it up.  My husband and older son thought it was okay.  I served with maple syrup but you can put almost anything on them that you prefer.

I was looking for an easy breakfast recipe for my then 11 mo old son, now 15 mo's, and found this.  HE LOVES IT.  It is easy to make, cook and eat, especially for my son (make into small pieces for those babies who do not chew well yet).  I like it as well, though my husband is not fond of it.  Though it does taste good w/vanilla added, we like it plain w/maple syrup.  Hope you do too!

My kids love this, I make it for them at least once a week for breakfast.  We are trying to come up with a better name, though.

I followed the recipe exactly the way it is.  It came out very doughy with little flavor.  I added syrup to give it some taste.
