These are fabulous cookies! Very sweet, moist & cakey. I did have to cook mine for quite a bit longer (about 17 minutes total) because they were stll pretty doughy in the center & they weren't all that big, only about 2 1/2 inches across. They don't spread very much so you can get more than  a dozen on a cookie sheet. I didn't have a full cup of pecans & I purposely decreased the chips... a whole pkg would be wayyy to sweet, I think. I only used about 2/3 of a pkg. I liked the ones that had a thin drizzle of frosting the best....a little goes a long way. Thanks for a wonderful cookie recipe for fall, Jean Kleckner!

This cookie is perhaps my new favorite.  A few things to look out for though:  let the cookies cool for 1 minute before removing them off the pan- they're not kidding about this!  Also, I found like other users that reducing the nuts and chips made for a better cookie.  The recipe for the icing made way too much for us, as we kept it thin and light so the sweetness didn't overpower the cookie.  What a fantastic treat!  Everyone loved them!

I didn't expect to like these cookies so much since we are chocolate fans here, but they are absolutely delicious.  Only changes I made were subbing 1/2 cup of wheat flour for part of the white flour, and using the swirled chocolate/white chocolate chips, since that is what I had on hand.  I baked these cookies on parchment paper lined sheets and they slid off easily. Thank you for the wonderfully different cookie recipe!

Drop by Tablespoon not teaspoon.  I ended up with a huge amount of tiny cookies.  I preferred the larger ones.  I added 3/4 bag of white chips and 1/4 of the nuts.  I did not make the frosting.  These were sweet enough.  Very tasty, delicate cookie.

Speaking strictly of flavor, these cookies are a dream.  Cooking them however, was a nightmare.  They fell apart on me when I tried to take them off the cookie sheet.  I ended up just baking the rest of the dough in a bar pan hoping they would turn out.

Yum! Can't wait to make these cake-like cookies again... loved by all! I made the frosting a bit thinner and just drizzled it over the cooled cookies.

I loved these. They do not need the frosting. The white chips made the cookie very sweet, as others have mentioned. I also made them with dark chips for a completely different yet still amazing taste.

I took these cookies to a get-together tonight. I think everyone ate at least 2! I got lots of compliments on them and a recipe request. They are cake-like, which I don't usually like, but it works for these. I didn't care for the icing and didn't think that the cookies really needed it, so I only put it on a dozen of them.

Awesome. Everyone that tried them raved about them. I had to quickly get give them away so I wouldn't over indulge. I lightly frosted them and used about half the nuts and 3/4 of a bag of the white chocolate chips, as was suggested. Your baking time may vary, depending on what you desire. What a great cookie.

These were tasty, especially if you like pumpkin. The white chocolate added a nice sweetness to the cookies. I made the mistake of making a double batch and I ended up with a gazillion cookies...one batch is plenty. Will make again.

These were soooo good...especially right out of the oven! We made them to give to neighbors and serve at Thanksgiving, but they didn't last that long. None of us could keep our hands out of the cookie jar...lol! Thanks for sharing.***Made Again, only this time I added dried cherries. The combination of cherries and white chocolate is over the top:)

Oh my. I followed the recipe almost to a tee. I used all-spice rather than pumpkin pie spice. The cookies turned out well. Then Karma landed on my side. Hoping to clear out some stuff from the fridge, I topped them with a little raspberry preserves. I decided to use some spare cream cheese icing on a few. Eventually, I joined the two. If you top these with a little cream cheese icing and a spoonful of raspberry preserves, you're going to be thankful you read this.

Very moist, soft cookies.  I had to bake these about 18 minutes because they were still doughy inside at 14.  The pumpkin flavor is good but the sweetness of the white chocolate and frosting are too much.  Next time I would use fewer white chocolate chips, probably skip the frosting all together, and maybe use some wheat flour.

I just madfe these tonight for our 60ppl thanksgiving dinner and I made 2 batches that made 5doz with the portion size I did.. and they are AMAZING.. I did only use 1/2 the bag of white choc chips in each batch and only used about 1/2 cup of pecan chips and they turned out great. I did only drizzle the frosting on the cookies because of how sweet they are and that was just perfect.. Thanks for the recipe. My picture of my cookies is posted too.

Delish!!! I did not make the frosting, they were sweet enough. The taste was great with the white chips!! The kids loved them, the husband doesn't care for the cakey cookie, but he liked the flavor.

Even though I used less chocolate chips than called for (because I mistakenly thought they were expensive), left out the nuts (due to an allergy) and skipped the icing (too much trouble for a cookie dough exchange), these were really fantastic.  Next time I will do exactly as the recipe says, just to see if it's possible to improve on perfection.  Seriously, wow!

Delicious cookies.  I drizzled on the icing (it doesn't need to much of it).  Everyone that I shared them with loved them.  I am going to a pumpkin bake off at my church this weekend and will be taking these.  The only thing I suggest different is to add whip cream and a bit of cinnamon to the top.

When I told my family what I was going to make they thought it sounded quite gross.  They changed their tune after they tried one and wanted seconds.  I used only 2/3 of the bag of white chocolate chips as well as the chopped pecans.  I then spread the dough on the biggest pan I could find and cooked them for 15 minutes.  I then spread the frosting on top of them.  They make wonderful bars.

These were very good, but too sweet/rich for my taste.  Would maybe cut back on the frosting and chips if I were to make them again.

Very delicious! They are cake-like, which I was not quite expecting, but still tasted great. I didn't use all the frosting on top, because as people have said, it was sweet enough. I will definitely make them again!

These were a big hit in our house!  I followed the recipe except using splenda instead of white sugar (to reduce it a bit) and used a few less pecans and white chocolate chips.  I did grease the cookie sheets after reading reviews but had no problems getting them off after letting them cool 2 minutes!  My husband especially liked them!

These were so yummy!  I made them as Christmas cookies and they disappeared faster than all my family's usual favorites.  I had no trouble removing them from the pan after letting them cool a minute or two, though you do have to use some care.  These will definitely be part of my Christmas baking from now on.

I agree these were a nightmare to take off the cookie sheet. I tried with and without a greased sheet.  I don't know if I would make them again for that reason. I think maybe if they were completely cooled it might have been better. They taste great though.

These are by far our favorite Christmas cookies. I substituted Splenda for the sugar and skipped the frosting ...they were plenty sweet. This recipe actually made 50 cookies for us, so next time I'll use a hardy tablespoon for placing on the baking sheet.

They taste great.  I followed the recipe exact and found that they fell apart easily though.  Next time I will probably cook a few minutes longer.
