Kids loved this, I asked them if they thought it was to cheesy(like the other reviews stated) and they said "NO!, it's super good!" I will be making this again, maybe adding more spices next time!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I did add some seasoning to the ground beef including garlic powder and chili powder.

Great idea, but WAY too much velveeta.  I cut it down to less than a half pound, added some cheddar, and used 12 oz. of macaroni and it was still overpowering.  I'll definitely keep the recipe but not as is.  Even the kids thought the cheese was too much.  (They were the only ones who ate it)

Quick and easy and quite tasty too.  I used a small, chopped onion instead of the onion powder and served with a vegatable on the side.  Yummy.

This is an excellent meal.  However to make it even easier I use Kraft Thick n Creamy Mac and Cheese.  I've never tried it with the mustard though.  The girls love it and even my husband who hates Mac and Cheese will eat this one!

We didn't care very much for this recipe. Too much Velveeta in it and I just didn't enjoy the flavor. It was a little bland and had a little sweet taste (probably caused by the ketchup) that I don't care for in a macaroni dish. Will not make this again.

There probably was too much cheese for us, but I wanted to try the recipe as stated first.  Still, it will be worth making again, adding some kind of herbs or spices and reducing the cheese.  Great and quick addition to my recipes.

If you're allergic to Hamburger Helper, this is a good alternative.  I'm allergic to monosodium glutamate, (MSG) which is in Hamburger and Tuna Helpers.  Other than that, this recipe is very mediocre.

This is easy to make and tastes good.  What's better is it's made with common pantry staples and kids like it.

After reading the other reviews I went ahead and added more seasonings.  I thought it came out pretty good.  I also put some aside and added some Rotel to see how that would taste.  I liked it both ways.

Very simple, family friendly meal.  I used a little more macaroni and only 1/2 pound of Velveeta.

Couldn't have been easier to make!  I cut back on the water because I liked the advice of adding canned tomatoes instead of ketchup.  It was devoured at our dinner table!  I have passed the recipe on already, and they made it, and they loved it, too!  (Btw, we have never been fans of Hamburger Helper)

I changed a couple of things, and it was pretty good...my 4 yr. old loved it.  I added a can of diced tomatoes, left out the ketchup, added some garlic and some seasoned salt, a little pepper.  Cut the cheese back to 8 oz. I will make it again just because it was quick, easy, one pan, and my little one loved it.

I used a box of "deluxe" mac & cheese, the kind which has the packet of cheese sauce in it and then made it as the recipe calls.  I also added some garlic powder and additional seasonings for some extra flavor.  The kids and hubby love it.  Much better than the Hamburger Helper and, when paired with a veggie, a good quick weeknight dinner.
