This recipe was so easy and great tasting.  I took these to a football game.  The fans found them more exciting then the game, and we're talking about die-hard fans.  I did do one more step to the recipe.  It says for you to marinate the pretzels in a zip lock bag.  I did mix it in a zip lock bag, but then put them on a cookie sheet and baked them at 250 for about 15 minutes.  That way it soaks up all the liquid.  Please try it!

I have to agree with the previous person in some respects.  I liked these pretzels, but couldn't eat very many of them because they were so incredibly salty. I think you could probably cut the garlic salt in half (or more).  I also didn't find them to be extremely spicy-hot, just salty. Again, I did like them, but a little went a long way.

These are great! I used a bunch of mini pretzel balls that I'd bought in bulk for this recipe and they worked just as good as mini twists. I cut WAY down on the oil, probably only 1/6 of a cup that I drizzled over the pretzels that I had in a cake pan. I shook them till they were covered, sprinkled the spice mix (that I used Morton's Hot Salt instead of the cayenne in) over top of them and stuck them in the oven at 325 for probably 15 minutes, stirring a few times. These are definitely addicting.

Excellent - everybody loves them.  I used garlic powder (not salt) so they weren't too salty.  My first batch was WAY too hot.  Now I start with 1/4 of the cayenne and add more as needed (I have extra-hot cayenne).  Such an easy snack!

Very good pretzels.  I have made 2 batches so far so I could give little bags away.  I also added extra cayenne pepper and baked for about 15 minutes to dry them out a little bit.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I initially received this recipe from an elderly nurse at a hospital where I used to work.  I lost it and looked here at allrecipes.  FOUND IT!!  WOOHOOO!!  I've actually been using THIS recipe for years now.  Thought the least I could do was give it a rating!!  The ingredients are really a base and can (obviously) be adjusted to taste.  I actually use two full 15 oz bags of pretzels instead of the 1 1/2 suggested.  I also use garlic powder vs garlic salt and extra cayenne pepper as we like this with a bit more 'bite'.  Also, I reduce the oil to 1/2 cup.  (wondering if olive oil would work...  ~idk why not!!)  Everyone LOVES this recipe and I really think the lemon pepper is the "secret"!!  I too have given this out as gifts and everyone requests it for parties, on game days, etc!  Thank you.

I didn't find these pretzels to be spicey or frankly very good at all.  They were saltier but no real added flavor.  Perhaps more spice powder would work but I don't think I'll be trying this one again.

Having a hard time with this rating. Can I choose 4 1/2? Next time I will up the Cayenne & use less powdered Ranch. Several bites I had to cringe with the Ranch taste. Once my tongue settled dow I think I liked it. Kind of like the sour stuff my kids like. Used less oil. Cooked mine at 250 stirring a couple of times for at least 30 minutes. Used nuggets & mini. Thanks!

This is a very good recipe for a tasty snack. I only put about 3/4 teaspoon of the cayanne, because I can't handle extreme hot. It turned out great. A bit of hot, but not overpowering. I also found that if you let them sit for more than the 2 hours they aren't so oily. I let mine sit overnight and they were perfect! I will definately make again!!! Thanks!!!!!

This is really great!  If you are not a "spicy" person, don't even think about this.  I used a little more caynne pepper for the next batch and it really does "kick."  Really easily made for a quick treat.  Kids really won't eat it, because it is too spicy.  Highly enjoyed it!  I have already eaten 2 batches by myself!  2 thumbs up!

These are addicting!  I try out new snack mix recipes all the time and this is by far the best one yet.  I read the reviews and couldn't believe how good people said these were considering the recipe is so easy.  These really are great.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and Fiesta Ranch dip mix along with the other ingredients and baked for 15 min at 250. (We love the Fiesta Ranch dip mix. It is mildly spicy southwest flavored ranch.)  They turned out great - plenty salty and just the right amount of heat.  The first few you eat don't seem spicy at all, but after a few you realize they have a little kick. They would probably be good with regular Ranch dressing mix too. Great for snacking during a game, movie, in the car, in care packages, teacher gifts, etc.  Thanks Valarie!

I loved the pretzels...they were a bit spicy (like the name says), but very easy, and different.  Yummy!

These were great.  They are fairly spicy, but you can easily adjust the amount of cayenne you use.  I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, since most pretzels come salted. Another bit of advice - don't dump the entire bag of pretzels out, instead scoop them out with your hands.  If you dump the whole bag, your end result is a very salty mix thanks to all the salt gathered on the bottom of the pretzel bag.

These pretzels are very good.  The only thing I did different was to put the pretzels and the mixture into a large paper grocery bag.  As you shake the bag, the excess oil soaks in.  It works great!

I have made this recipe 5 times now, and everyone LOVES it....I give it away in bags to the neighbors for Christmas....I agree with the garlic powder vs. salt, and sometimes I add just a touch of worchestershire sauce for added kick (use a little less oil!)

easy to prepare.  I felt like it was just a bit too salty.  I also used half of the pepper called for and it turned out just fine. My kids loved this snack!

Because I didn't want this to be too salty, I used a homemade dry ranch seasoning mix sans salt and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. These are super yummy. I used Rold Gold tiny twists. I made these last night for a movie snack and the boys inhaled about half. NOTE: This recipe says nothing about baking them, which I always do as noone eats soggy pretzels. I bake them in a 250* oven for about an hour (I don't really time it.....they just kind of smell done) making sure to stir them every 10-15 minutes are so.

Everyone loved this!!! Was asked for the recipe countless times.  I used Canola Oil, garlic powder instead of garlic salt (VERY important substitution!).  Absolutely delicious & addicting.

I made this with my second grade class.  Those who liked them couldn't get enough.  I think they were just too strong for others (we did not use the cayenne).  I thought they were tasty too.  I used 1 1/4 cup oil instead of the 1 3/4 cup recommended for my scaled version and it was just perfect.  The kids had a great time making it!

These were good, but I made a couple of revisions. I used garlic powder instead of salt (after reading other reviews) & I added 1 tsp of onion powder. Instead of using vegetable oil, I used canola oil & drained them on paper towels.

A Huge Family Favorite. I've been making these for years, but slight differences -  I use 2 bags of pretzels, 1 cup of oil, then 1 tablespoon of each of the seasonings, Garlic Powder, Lemon Pepper and Dill weed instead of Cayenne, plus the pkg of dry Ranch mix - or really adjust per your taste. But this what everyone always begs me to make.

To make it less salty, I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  The pretzels are plenty salty, and the ranch dressing mix also has salt.  Folks love these!!

Pretty good pretzel recipe!  Love how easy it was.  The only alteration I made was to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt because I was worried about it being toooooo salty.  Not really sure how I feel about the addition of lemon pepper, so I think I will stick with the Cayenne Pretzels from this site instead.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

If you like spicy, I highly recommend this recipe.  These pretzels are tasty and have a nice kick at the end.  I made them for our school secretary's goodie platter on Secretary's Day and word got around.  I had to take her more later because everyone else kept eating them.  Now I've been asked to make them again just a week later!  I followed the recipe to a T but wonder what would happen if I added a bit of brown sugar.  Would they be salty/sweet or just a gooey mess?  I'll try it and let you know!

This is going to become one of my new favorite snacks!!  It is just enough heat---tons of flavor.  I also baked them on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes as it was a bit oily.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt as there is plenty of salt on the pretzels alone!  So easy and yummy!!!  I will make this again and again and perfect for football parties!

These are addicting.  We've made 3 batches for different get togethers in the past 2 weeks and have gooten rave reviews everywhere!!  I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and combined the oil and pretzels first in the ziplock bag.  I then added the seasoning mix to the pretzels/oil and mixed it well.  I skipped the marinade and popped it in the oven for 15 minutes at 300, stirring every 5 minutes.  Awesome recipe!!!

A co-worker brought these to work an I found the recipe here.  WOW - these are dangerously good!  Totally addictive!  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  If you let them set 2 hours they suck up all of the oil - then just transferred into clean Ziploc bags.

I used pretzel nuggets to better absorb the oil. I also use garlic powder instead of salt and cook on 300 for 20 mins (stir after first 10 mins). These are seriously addictive....I have had to take them to work so I don't eat the whole bag myself!

I am in love with these pretzels! I used garlic powder instead of salt just to cut down on the sodium a bit. I also baked them in the oven for a few minutes to get them dry. Absolutely addictive!

This is an easy way to spruce up your pretzels.  My husband loved it.  I followed some other suggestions and replaced garlic salt with garlic powder. I also baked them for 15 minutes at 250 so they wouldn't be oily.

These are so addicting! Instead of lemon pepper (which I never have), I use 1 tsp lemon juice and 1/4 tsp black pepper. I also use garlic powder instead of garlic salt as they are plenty salty.

I used 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. cayenne, and 1 tsp. lemon pepper. I used only 1/2 of the ranch mix and added enough oil to mix everything together. I love that this recipe does not require any baking. However, it is very salty and I love salt. It reminders me of the oyster cracker/ranch dressing mix.

Love these and so oes my family. I baked one batch, the other I just left in the baggie, shaking occasionally and left for 12 hours. The oil absorbed in the one I didn't bake. Both were great. I'm making them for a potluck this week. I love the heat that comes from them.

This is a great recipe not only for the pretzels but there are so many varieties you can also use.  Use Chex cereal or oyster crackers instead of the pretzels.  I sometimes use 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne and lemon pepper. You can also use dill and no lemon pepper.  I never use the garlic salt...instead I use garlic powder because sometimes the packaged ranch mix is a little salty.  Try adding peanuts..dry roasted or cocktail peanuts....cashew pieces are good also.....  Wonderful recipe..so many ways you can use this recipe ..... be creative! We enjoy adding the nuts to ours...Thanks for sharing!

Good for holiday snacks. To revise: I use Rold Gold's big thin pretzels and use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. The pretzels are already salted so if you add more it can be overpowering.

This is a quick and easy recipe that I have adapted to suit my liking.  I hate pepper of any kind so I omit both the cayenne and lemon pepper.  In its place I add a  tablespoon of dried dill and 1/2 teaspoon of celery salt.  Since the pretzels are already salty, I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  These pretzels don't last so plan on making a double batch!

Very good, but once you start eating them its hard to stop! So, needless to say they go quick! I use garlic powder-not garlic salt, olive oil-not vegetable oil, and no lemon pepper seasoning. Made a batch of these for my 5th grader to take to school for her fall party tomorrow-we put them in a big ice cream tub that we decorated like a jack o lantern. She loved it!

I've made these for many occasions and everyone loves them.  I have tweaked the original recipe from garlic salt to powder and I also bake them for about 10 minutes in a 300 degree oven to set the flavor better.  I make several batches at a time and dump the pretzels in the baggies and mix up the oil and spices in my measuring cup by-passing another bowl to clean up.  Putting them in gallon baggies on the counter and shaking them up and turn them over every time I walk by.  After several hours of this I bake them.  I also up the cayenne for spicier pretzels for friends who like a little spicer kick!!  I have friends who beg me to make these for them they love them so much!!!  Great for parties, crowds or just the family.

These are very good.  I don't know how they don't get soggy but they don't and you don't need to bake them (it seems like the natural thing to do but not necessary!).  I used homemade ranch dressing mix (from this site) and only had garlic powder (not salt).  These will be a regular snack for us.

The pretzels were very good. I've made them twice and altered the recipe a little.  I use less oil and cayenne (red) pepper.  The 2nd time I omitted the Ranch dressing and it was less flavorful.  Next time I will use 1/2 a package of Ranch.

Enjoyed these a lot!! I added more cayenne pepper since we like things hotter!! Will make again. I aslo didn't add the garlic salt I used garlic powder. Also, baked the pretzels instead of letting them soak. Worked out great.

I loved these pretzels.  Added an extra 1/2 tsp of cayenne and 1/2 packet of ranch dressing mix, which really added to the flavor.  Scrumptious!  Also baked them for 10-15 minutes.  Yummy.

Everybody loves this recipe! I used unsalted pretzels and recipe turned out perfect - they weren't too salty. Was too spicy for the kids so I substitute chili powder for cayenne pepper when I make it for them. Bake in 250 degree oven for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.

i loved these, but i agree on a few things from other people. i added garlic powder, less cayenne and did also bake them for a few minutes. i love spicy food, but even 3/4 teaspoon of cayenne was a kicker. very addictive though.

Personally I don't get it.  I'd give this recipe a 3.  I thought it was OK but nothing to get excited about.  However, I appear to be in the minority....my family and friends went nuts over this!  Since they all give it a 5 I'll let it cancel out my 3 ;)  Next time I'm going to try garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  They were a little to salty.

I used 3 teaspoons of mexican chili powder instead of the cayenne pepper (couldn't find at the grocery).  Then mixed it every hour for about 5 hours.  It was a hit!  Spicy lovers LOVED it and asked for the recipe.

I have altered this recipe somewhat.  I cut up and dry thoroughly Carolina Reaper peppers which I then add to the oil about 2 weeks prior to preparing.  I remove the peppers and just use the oil.  I put crushed garlic in oil a couple of days prior instead of garlic salt.  I add gardetto rye chips and the extra large cheese-its.

These are great! I took the suggestion made by others and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup. I shook the pretzels several times over the course of the first hour or so and then left them in the marinating zip lock bag for the night. When I poured them out they were delicious. I didn't see any need to bake them. They were plenty hot- I think the spiciness of these will depend a lot on the freshness of the cayenne pepper you use and also whether you bake them or not. Baking them will take out some of the heat. Personally, I don't see the need to bake them.

Awesome!  Used garlic powder, not garlic salt. Added 1 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce. Did not bake as stated in other reviews.

Most definitely use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Cut the oil to 1/2 cup. I don't keep lemon pepper on hand, so I use regular pepper with some chili powder. Mix everything except the pretzels in a big bowl FIRST, then add pretzels and toss. Toss every 5 to 10 minutes. Usually they soak up all the flavor quite well, especially when you cut down on the oil.

Awesome - I make it at least twice a week.  The office people can't get enough of them (as with me).  I did bake the pretzels after marinating them.  200 degrees for an hour.  Stirring every 15 minutes.

Made these for the superbowl.  Super easy, but would cut down on the lemon pepper.  I also used garlic powder rather than garlic salt and increased it to 2 tsp.  I used olive oil rather than veg oil

Great recipe.  I cut the oil in half when I made a big batch.  Could probably also either cut the garlic salt in half or use garlic powder.  But these where a great hit!!!  I have had tons of requests to make more.

We used 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder as suggested due to the saltiness.  Used 1/2 package dry ranch dressing.  Instead of just pretzels, we tried it with dry roasted peanuts and cheez its.  We also baked for 15 minutes on 250 degrees so we could eat them right away.  We added more ground red pepper because we like it hot!  Next time will also try adding liquid hot sauce. Will make again and again.

Looking for pretzels with a little bite?  This pretzel marinade is sure to pack a little punch while tanging your buds.  Keep your napkins handy and your drink of choice close by.

My best friend has a similar recipe, so I thought I would try this one.  My family loves spicy food, so I added a bit extra cayenne pepper, and I also baked it in the oven like I do with cereal party mix.   I had pretzel braids and little pretzel balls, looks very festive... My boys love it.

These pretzels are fantastic. I usually bake them for 3-5 minutes just to get rid of the oil. Also, before baking, I sprinkle them with even more spices to make them extra tasty!

I just made these for the Christmas basket of goodies I make for my husband's office every year. They are very good, but I cut the cayenne by half and they are still a little too spicy for my taste. I'm sure people who like spicy food will love them. I did put a warning on the label - they are that hot!
I did as other reviewers suggested and baked them at 250 for 10 minutes - it made a big difference!

I thought this were really really good! And I'm not even a huge pretzel fan.
I made these for a bach. party and everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.  I did use the pretzel twists and since already salted I used garlic powder instead of salt.  I also marinated mine overnight and then baked at 250 for 8 minutes the next morning.

These were good after I added a lot more cayenne pepper. Also, I had to bake them for about 10 minutes at 300* so the liquid would soak up. As written, the recipe is decent, but if you want more spice, add a lot more cayenne.

These pretzels are addictive! I've made them four times for gatherings with family or friends and they always disappear.  I use less oil than the recipe calls for and shake the bag often while marinating and before baking.  They're especially good dipped in flavored mustards.

My family loves these.  I make them every few weeks.  I'm not a plain pretzel kind of girl, but I love the flavorful kick of these pretzels.  Angela

Excellent.  Based upon the previous reviews, I decreased the lemon pepper to 3/4 t., used chili powder instead of cayenne pepper, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, added 1 t. onion powder and decreased the oil to 1/2 c.  The best tip was bake the pretzels for 15 minutes at 250 degrees.

I thought these were fantastic and super easy!  I, too, used less cayenne pepper because I had a mixed crowd eating them.  I used half garlic salt and half garlic powder and I didn't think they were too salty.  I didn't use as much lemon pepper either, but could still really taste it.  My two year old kept saying "MORE MORE", and "I want HOT pretzels"!  I now have friends hooked on these and ask when I will make more!

Excellent!  I cut back a bit on the cayenne because of presonal preference; but they were a real hit.  Thanks for a great snack.

We loved this recipe.  I made it as described and both my husband and I liked it.  I will be making this again and it's so easy.  Make sure you let it sit for a while  as it needs time for the oil to absorb.  Did not seem greasy at all.

I make these quite a bit. Always a favorite. But I like to make them with a waffle shaped pretzel. The seasoning seems to coat better in all the corners.

The recipe is really good but I changed the garlic salt to garlic powder;  it made a lot of difference and the lemon pepper and the cayenne pepper added the kick my family and friends enjoyed.

We found the spices too strong and hot. I remade the recipe and used, 1/4 tsp. cayenne, 1/2 tsp. lemon pepper, 1 tsp garlic, 1/2 cup oil, 1 Tablespoon dry Ranch-style dressing and 15 oz mini pretzels.  It wasn't as strong or greasy, but still had somewhat of a bite to it.

Love these, but I did make some changes.  First of all, I usually only use 1 bag versus 1.5, so I cut the other ingredients down in the same ratios.  My family doesn't care for Ranch overly much, so I usually use less than half (and save the other half for the next batch).  I also can't handle that much Cayenne, so I halve that as well.   They are really good - you don't realize how hot they are until you have eaten a few and your tongue starts to feel hot.  Love that they can be made ahead, and that they do fine in the heat!  Great for a day of boating or camping!

After reading a few reviews wanting more spice, less salt, less oil....I decided to try something new. I doubled the lemon pepper seasoning, substituted ranch seasoning with Cajun seasoning, and added another half bag of pretzels. I couldn’t wait 2 hours before diving in.

3.23.18  I’m about middle of the road to upper middle when it comes to spiciness, but I think that’s the one thing this recipe is missing.  To live up to its name, it needs more cayenne.  These pretzels are O.K. but not sure I like them well enough to make again.  ****UPDATE 3.24.18****  After sitting overnight, these pretzels have much more flavor and zing, so I'm updating my review from 3 to 4 stars.

This is a great recipe! Tasty and easy.  I only used half of the oil and it was just fine.  I also only used 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead of the 1 1/2 tsp of garlic salt since other reviewers said it was too salty.  And, it turned out great!

I’ve been making this recipe for several years. I love the lemon pepper so I do 1.5 tsp of lemon pepper and 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of salt. I also use 1/4 tsp cayenne. And I bake them on 250 for about 15-30 min after they’ve set for 30 min to an hour. I have many friends and family members that request these. So. Addicting.

I made a batch of these and they turned out great. I used Orville Redenbacher's Buttery Flavored Oil instead of the vegetable oil. I also put the pretzels after they were seasoned in the smoker for about an hour at 235*. It gave them a nice touch of smoke along with the spicy flavor. I will be making these again.

These can be great using garlic powder instead of garlic salt because there is already enough salt in the recipe.  I replaced the lemon pepper with ground ghost pepper flakes to make them extra spicy. I always get rave reviews when I bring them to a party. My recipe may be too spicy for some, but if you like heat, you will love these! Make sure to have an ice cold beer nearby!

I love this recipe and make it often.  I do cut the oil in half and use light EVOO.  I substituted  regular EVOO once and didn't like the change.   Love the pretzels.

It was okay. A bit spicier than I'd like. Was looking for something that tasted more like Dot's Pretzels.

Changed garlic salt to garlic powder.  All the flavor without the, "Salt-lick" effect.  So good with a cold beer and a ball game!

Decided to give these a try after special ordering the ND version. Now my hubby's favorite snack food...he even makes them himself!  He has experimented with the amount of cayenne and the style of pretzels.  He also uses two 15 oz bags per batch.  Now we buy the seasonings at Sam's in larger containers, especially the Ranch Dressing Mix!

These are so addictive. I used 1/4 tsp of cayenne and baked at 250 for 10 mins after marinating them for about an hour. And I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

These pretzels are delicious! I would suggest using unsalted pretzels otherwise I could see these being way too salty. Great and easy recipe.

Use garlic powder, not garlic salt.  I make a packet of the season mix and give away as Christmas gifts.

This recipe is one of our easy favorites! We've made it over and over again.

I do make a few adjustments, though.

Generally, I cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half and bake them for about 10 minutes at 350 to dry out the oil a little - it makes them a lot less greasy!

I made this recipe several times, it's a HUGE hit! Very addicting!  However, it is very salty and not quite spicy enough,  so I use garlic powder in lieu of garlic salt and I add a little extra cayenne pepper.  People ask me for the recipe all the time!

I love these pretzels. I can't get enough of them! The reviewer who said they didn't have much more flavor than regular pretzels must have a taste bud deficiency. They are SO flavorful! Maybe her spices were old? I have never had a bad batch of these.

Just made this tonight. I saw the comments about salt and thought "hey, we are talking about pretzels, they could have a point". I switched out the garlic salt with 1 tsp garlic powder... then doubled the cayenne to add a little color. Yah, its that good.

I make these all the time... we love them! even my 3 year old grandson... HOWEVER, I do use 1 tsp garlic POWDER and 1/2 tsp garlic salt.. .. i find 1 and 1/2 of the garlic salt is a bit too salty.. also use canola oil instead of veggie oil...but these are a staple in our house.

I have made these SEVERAL times and they are DELICIOUS! As others have said to do, I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. These pretzels you absolutely DO NOT NEED TO BAKE!!!! There are other recipes out there that call for baking them, but not necessary. I bring these for work parties and they are always a hit.

I give this 4 stars only because I have been making a similar recipe for years and they always disappear and I am always asked for more and the recipe. I use garlic powder not salt and I use butter topping and oil made for popcorn, not vegetable oil. I have the same amounts of everything, but I always double the cayenne pepper.

Defiantly need to use garlic powder in place of garlic salt. Still a little salty, even when not adding any salt at all. I assume it depends on how salty ur pretzels are to begin with and personal taste. Nonetheless, it goes great with an ice cold beer!

Will make again, these were ate up! However, next time will do as another reviewer suggested and sub garlic powder for garlic salt, I think it would be tastier with less salt.

Great recipe, however I would use garlic powder instead - as the garlic salt made the end result too salty! Loved the spicy-ness & will try on other snacks like variety nuts, Chex Mix, etc. Thanks for sharing!

These are really good & super easy! I was thinking about making these for Christmas , so I decided to do a half 'test' batch. There's so few ingredients, I had everything on hand; I was skeptical about the lemon pepper, but it adds an acidity that is really great. Spicy-dial down the cayenne if you're not into spicy. So simple & delicious; I am making a big batch for Christmas!

Always a hit. I have made these many times, but I substitute garlic powder for garlic salt, and I add fresh grated Parmesan after mixing in the bag. I allow them to marinate for a few days, flipping the bag at least every day. That way, I can make them days before I need them. I also make one batch with double the cayenne for those who like them spicier.

Cut the sodium by switching the garlic salt to garlic powder.  Doing that really makes the flavor better, along with letting the pretzels marinate over night.

These are excellent! The only thing was that I had to let them sit for about 48 hours in order for the oil to absorb but that may have been due to the kind of pretzels I used (rold gold). Otherwise they are great!

My husband loves this recipe so much that as soon as he eats the last of what I make he begs for more.  I did bake it for 20 to 30 min at 250 (mixing it a couple of times in between).  Just the right spice for us.  Thanks.

These are wonderful and I get requests for the recipe all the time.  Not for those who don't enjoy spiciness!  Have been making these for 3 years and still get asked to bring to parties.

These pretzels are easy to make and delicious!  I have made them 3 times and have had requests for more.  I mixed them up and put them in the oven @300 degrees for a few minutes.

Very good and super easy to make...I mean you really can't go wrong with this and I'm a beginner who likes no fail recipes!  I baked mine b/c I wanted to serve them warm and really bake in that seasoning.  They had a little kick which kept people coming back to the bowl too!

These are great!  I scaled down the recipe to work with one one-pound bag of mini pretzels and made a batch yesterday.  The only change I made was to substitute garlic powder for garlic salt, and I was out of cayenne pepper so I used chipotle chile powder.  They were delicious!  I did not bake them as other reviewers suggested, and they were not too greasy.

Very yummy and easy!  I also bake the pretzels at 350 for 7-9 minutes to get rid of the oily texture. YUM!

The pretzels were too salty and I LOVE salt.  I even only used 1/2 the recomended amount of garlic salt and the other half garlic powder.  The pretzels had a great flavor under the saltiness so I will try this again without the garlic salt and use powder instead. I baked them for about 15min and that dried them nicely.

The first time I tried these, I wasn't sure how they would come out because I used olive oil (was out of other).  Everyone loved them! The second time I made them, I used Fiesta Ranch dry dip mix, and they were a big hit, also. I do substitute garlic POWDER for garlic salt.  Also, after they have marinated, I spread them on baking sheets and bake at 350 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes.  Thanks, Valarie, for a great recipe!!!

So easy! And so addicting!  If you like spicy food, you've got to try these, they're fabulous.
