We used this to make something I've been thinking of for some time now. Deep fried chili balls. Just freeze your chili in ice cube trays, then dip the cubes into the batter and fry. Nothing better than cornbread and chilly, so why not chili fries with a cornmeal batter!!

AWESOME!!!! The batter is perfect in every way! I cut my hot dogs in 1/2 and used a metal skewer to dip them into the batter and then into the hot oil. I then removed the skewer and cooked them that way. The kids went crazy for these, and they were so easy that I will def be making them  again~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very pleased how they came out. Only about 90 seconds in 350° oil. 3 minutes would be a cracker!

Followed the recipe exactly, [so I feel entitled to actually review the recipe unlike those people that change the recipe and review their version of the recipe] This is a very good basic recipe for corn dogs. I used German sausages as a very nice improvement. My batter seemed a bit thick so I used the back of a spoon to thin the coating prior to putting it in the fryer. I also went a little longer than the light brown stage called for because I wanted to make sure the batter was done. These got very good reviews from everyone who had one!

Fast version tips:
1. Always make the full amount of batter, even for one package of Hotdogs, and keep it cool. 
2. Definitely dry them thoroughly, possibly go through the extra step of Cornstarch/flour. 
3. Put batter into a tall, slim cup for easy dipping. 
4. Make sure batter is proper consistency, otherwise it will not be smooth. Add extra milk (slowly, by the tsp) if needed to get a smooth consistency. 
5. Hold the corn dogs up in the oil at first so it isn't raw batter sticking to your pan. 
6. Pepper isn't needed

The long version... 

Made these without the pepper, but everything else the same. I halved the recipe as I only had one package of hot dogs, and I think that was my mistake. The batter was SO THICK, and even after following the other commenters recommendations of drying off the hot dogs, it still didn't stick. Half of the recipe also only made enough to fill half of a pint size Mason jar, so it really was not much. I put it into a smaller cup and it worked, but only for 4 hot dogs. The rest of the hot dogs got put back in the fridge. I think the batter was just too thick to begin with. I'll add some extra liquid next time.

I couldn't get the batter to stick to the hot dog. It was my first time making corn dogs, but I followed the recipe exactly. Th batter was incredibly thick and mostly slid off the hot dog :( Saved it the best I could but I will never make it again

I did NOT precook the beef hot dogs prior to dipping and frying them.  They turned out perfectly.  Will add a little less liquid next time, and refrigerate the batter longer than I did, (I only chilled it for 2 hours).  Will definitely make again!

We are planning to make corn dogs for my son's carnival theme birthday party so I wanted to try out the recipe first.  Oh my gosh this recipe is wonderful.   Everyone at the party is going to love them.

They were yummy!!! I care for a child who has a wheat allergy, so I used gluten-free flour.  Because of that the batter was not as thick as I would have liked, so I added a couple more tablespoons and it worked just fine.  The kids loved them and asked for more!  I will definitely be making these again!  THANKS DAD!!!

Best corn dogs I’ve ever had. Way cheaper than the fair also. I make a big batch then freeze the leftovers. When it comes to line to reheat them I let them thaw then pop them in the oven at 375° for about 12 minutes.

I used whole whea flour, brown sugar, olive oil and thin sausages. They not look as pretty as other pictures but soft and delicious. Thank you for sharing the recipe. Big difference with the one from the supermarket

I really liked these and that I was able to use Turkey dogs. I do like mine to be a little sweeter though so I'll probably add a bit more sugar next time. Still, the recipe is a keeper.

I love those recipe. I cheated a little by using a jiffy cornbread premix. I added a little extra milk to it to thin it out a bit. We used little smokies cheese filled weenies for ours and they turned out fantastic!!!

The flavor of the breading itself for this was spot on, but, for me, it tasted too much like cornmeal. Will play around with a little bit more with the flour/cornmeal ratio next time I make these. Even though it didn't taste quite like I thought it would, it's still good and would recommend!

My daughter love corn dogs, so I made this recipe for the first time last week and my daughter and her friends loved it.  I made it about 8 times since.  Great recipe, I didn't change anything.
