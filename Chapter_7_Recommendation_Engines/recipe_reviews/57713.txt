Equess3n's friend got the "Hand out Recipe" that leaves out the secret ingredient. Change the milk to evaporated milk and eliminate the sugar and you've got the Gulliver's cream corn that all Californian's came to love!

I used Evaporated milk over the regular milk 
No MSG
I made it the day before Thanksgiving and the day of I took it out of the refrigerator an hour and a half before dinner. Let it sit out to come to room temperature. A half hour before dinner I added a parmesan cheese to the top with a thin layer of dried bread crumbs and a T. of butter and put it in the oven at 350 to heat back up.
This was very good!!  Everyone ate it and really enjoyed it. My brother in law who said he "hated" cream corn tried it. He said "I had not had this since I was a kid -- my tastes must have changed -- THIS IS SO GREAT!" 
His wife then told him "this is not the garbage out of the can -- and calling this 'cream corn' is an insult."
This recipe is going in my bag of tricks!

My family has been making this for the holidays since the early 70's when we use to eat at Gullivers in Southern California. In fact, I am required to bring it to every holiday meal or I dont think I would be let in the door! The original recipe includes parmesan cheese doted with butter sprinkled on top and then is browned under the broiler for a few mins. Definately an only once or twice a year treat!!

Super easy and delicious. I made half the recipe exactly as written using  cayenne pepper and no MSG. Just before serving I added shredded parmesan cheese.

I've been making the recipe for the last 8 years.  It's a holiday staple in my house and my family and guests ABSOLUTELY love it.  I melt the butter in the microwave and then blend flour into it finally I add it to the corn mixture and let simmer.  Pour into to a serving dish and just put a dash of cayenne pepper before serving.  This side dish is HONESTLY TO DIE FOR!!! IMO, you don't need the accent or msg.

I was surprised by how well this turns out.  A nice, homey creamed corn with a little bit of pizazz.  I prefer it with cayenne pepper- a nice kick.  

I did make a few changes: I added some nutmeg to warm it up.  I'd never use MSG- some people are allergic, and a good cook knows how to create enough flavor without it!  Finally, I substituted milk for the whipping cream and light butter for the butter, and it was just fine, if not quite as yummy as with richer ingredients.

This recipe is a family favorite of ours.  Made as is, with the exception of the MSG.  Yes, it is wonderfully rich, but that's why we serve it only for holiday dinners!  Have only received rave reviews and recipe requests for this one!

Very good!  Note to self: adding 2 oz cream cheese makes this perfect when scaled for 6 servings using a 2 lb bag of corn. (serves 10/12 for holiday meals) Use immersion blender to break up a bit (1/8 to 1/4) of the corn for a more "creamed corn" texture.

I wanted to try something a little different as a vegetable for Christmas dinner. Although I find canned creamed corn yucky, this  recipe appealed to me.
It was simple and quick to put together as the turkey was resting. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and used a little cayenne and a little white pepper. I may increase the cayenne slightly the next time. As promised, it thickened up beautifully but didn't get gloppy as it sat on the table.  This was well liked by everyone and something that I will enclude in special future dinners. Thanks so much.

I worked at the Gullivers in Marina del Rey for years and I personally know that this is not the TRUE recipe, although  works, is not the real flavor.  We used to give out a card/recipe to those who asked for it but it was NOT the recipe. And we used to snicker about it as if "they only knew". I make this every Thanksgiving and is a huge hit of course.  The MSG is key (but they didn't want anyone to know) to the recipe!  It's two tablespoons(!) and the sugar measurements are 4/5 tablespoons, but you even it out with more salt if needed(to taste). The whipping cream, milk measurement...must cover the corn (equal amounts of each) to be the PERFECT consistency.  We never used parmesean cheese or cheyenne pepper, just white pepper.  Add more butter/flour mixture to make a chili like consistency, never thick, unless you like it that way. Just my opinion!

I made this recipe this weekend for a bbq cook-off.  It was great!! I increased the serving size to 30 and it was the best corn I have ever had and so easy to make!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I highly recommend it.

Gulliver's is still open in Irvine, CA (Southern Cali). They give you the real recipe on their website http://www.gulliversrestaurant.com/cuisine.html FYI - Don't leave out the sugar!!! AND Don't add MSG!!!  This is my favorite food in the whole world!!! Another FYI - the butter and flour part is much better when done on the stovetop - it is called a "roux".

So good!!! Omitted the MSG (I'd NEVER put that in our food), did not use the flour either. I halved the recipe but kept the butter, sugar and salt the same. It was the best cream corn I ever tasted, will NEVER BUY CANNED AGAIN!!!!

Oddly enough, this is the exact same recipe as the one on this site by Diana Yockey. The only differences are the amount of corn, hers calls for Parmesan cheese, and this one uses MSG. I fixed this tonight as a change of pace from regular corn. My 4-year-old and I had dinner with my parents and grandmother. Everyone loved this corn! My dad said it was a bit sweet for his taste, and I used Splenda in place of the sugar (he cannot eat refined sugars). I also did not use the MSG. I used the better 2/3 of a 28 oz bag of frozen corn. A bit too much sauce for that amount - next time will make sure to use the whole bag (it was all they had). I think 2 (20 oz) bags will be too much. I just dumped everything in the pan except the flour and milk - mixed flour into the milk before adding to rest of ingredients. All in all, a great change of pace. Thanks!!

We have been using this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas for OVER 10 years. No leftovers. You can use canned corn (drained) and it still turns out excellant. The resturant still exsists today in Orange County California. Its across for John Wayne Airport.

This recipe was good but my way made it amazing. It is a little bland first go round. I made it a second time and played with it and wow it was 5 stars. I cooked up 6 slices of bacon and threw in 1/2 chopped yellow onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic. I used whipping cream instead of milk. I only used 1/2 cup of cream & added 1/2 cups of chicken broth. I omitted sugar and only used 1 bag of corn. And wow amazing!! I cant wait to make this for the holidays.

THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!  Loved it as is, but I made my own recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was/is to die for!  I ate a bowl of this for lunch - and yes, I know how packed full of calories it is.  It's definitely a once a year treat.  My 8 year old son is already begging me to make it for Christmas. =)  This is my recipe - http://allrecipes.com/CustomRecipe/62197705/Thanksgiving-Creamed-Corn/Detail.aspx

This was good corn, but I think it would be better with fresh corn straight off the cob, vs. frozen corn.  It just doesn't quite lose that 'frozen' taste.  It's more like corn kernels in a cream sauce, rather than 'creamed corn'.  We did add a diced (fresh) cayenne pepper for some heat and it was a nice touch.

I cut this in half and used half the amount of salt(used sea salt). I also used fresh ground pepper. I really enjoyed this as did my oldest but my husband and youngest were indifferent. I think had I not browned the flour in the butter, like I was starting a roux, this would have not been as good. I think that step is extremely important.

This was to die for!!! Had this for Easter dinner with ham, scalloped potatoes, and brussel sprouts. Everyone RAVED over this dish. Only thing I did differently was add McCormick's Parmesan Herb seasoning blend to the mixture (as I noticed that other reviews said that the original had parmesan sprinkled over the top). Truly amazing!

very good WITHOUT MSG. didn't change it at all - the only thing is that i go in with a masher at the very end to break up the kernels a bit. word of advice - do not try to do this without thawing completely! has been a hit at every holiday dinner for years now. thanks!

Gulliver's and I go back to the 70's, when it was one of my husband's and my favorite restaurants.  They served the creamed corn with prime rib, creamed spinach and Yorkshire pudding.  Fabulous!
I've been making the creamed corn from this recipe ever since.
The original recipe called for 8 ears of corn, cut from the cob; 1 cup whipping cream; 2 tsp salt; 1 tsp sugar; 2 tsp butter, plus extra for topping; 2 tsp flour; and grated Parmesan cheese.  (I omitted the MSG.) The directions are very much the same as your version; however, instead of fussing with the broiler, I brown it with the "flame thrower" I use for creme brulee.

My family loves this recipe! (My kids especially like it because it reminds them of corn, cream, and pepper in Nacho Libre). I have made it a few times and it is so easy to make. You can substitute half and half or  milk to lighten the recipe up. The last time I made this I used mostly skim milk with a little half and half and that turned out just as good (you might have to add a little more flour for it to thicken up). Definitely use a good quality frozen sweet corn, and as others have said, skip the msg.

Awesome recipe - I left out the MSG and it was great!!!  It doesn't need the flavor enhancer, in my opinion.

Absolutely awesome! I attempted another version of this recipe three times previously with disasterous results - my sauce never thickened. I finally decided to make a roux instead of using cornstarch and voila' - PERFECT CREAMED CORN!

This is my 'go-to' Cream Corn recipe for holidays!  I'm in So Calif and we still have a local Gulliver's. I've been making this more than 25 years. Got so popular I had to use a 5# bag of corn every Thanksgiving and Christmas!  It's just the best in cream corn!

This is very good! A hint: use Bragg's Liquid Aminos or a touch of tamari (richer soy sauce) for MSG's savory/umami flavor. Or add finely chopped sauteed mushrooms if the people eating it don't mind.

One and only creamed corn recipe I'm trying. I have never made creamed corn and have only had it from a can prior to this. WOW its like 2 totally different things, my boyfriend said it was so good I should make it every night. We grow our own corn and was looking for a new corn sidedish to make. It was so good I'm going to make it for Thanks giving I think. I did not add the msg, used fresh ground black pepper instead of white or cayenne, and doubled the flour and butter. Was extra creamy , thick and perfect.

AWESOME! Makes a generous amount and is always a crowd pleaser. I omit the MSG just as a personal preference - I have made it both ways (with and without) and can't really tell the difference.  Truth be told, this recipe is so good I claim it as my own. No one has to know I'm not a culinary genious, right?

Wasn't horrible, but wasn't great.  I found it kind of blah.  My husband and kid didn't care for it much either.  Tasted like corn with thick milk on it.  I won't be making it again.

My mom and I have been making this dish for years, and it's very popular at family gatherings.  We do not use the MSG but keep everything else pretty close.  I usually add a can of diced, roasted chiles to mine for a different twist.  It's a very good recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was fast, easy and delicious! I cut the recipe in half and used half and half rather than milk and whipping cream. I did not use MSG, just aprox 1/8 t ceyenne pepper. DELICIOUS!! My picky husband loved it. Finaly a nice holiday vegetable that he will eat! Thanks Debby!

My mother has been making this FOR MANY, MANY years, and has always kept it as a "secret" recipe.  She brings it to just about every pot luck dinner, simply because it is requested by everyone.  Everybody LOVES it, and always asks her for the recipe, but this is one she will not give out.  She thought she was only one of a few people in the world that had this recipe....I'm gonna have to break the news to her that her precious recipe is here for all to see...sorry mom!! =(  

ONE PROBLEM.... This version of the recipe says to use 2- 20oz packages of corn, but you should only be using one.  It will not be creamy enough if you use two.  If you're going to make a double-batch, (which we always do), then use 2 packages of corn, but make sure you DOUBLE the rest of the recipe.  That is the ONLY change this recipe needs!!!  I wouldn't add or omit a single thing (besides the msg for health reasons)!  This is one recipe that does not need to be "tweaked" in any way.


(This is a fantastic recipe, and I recommend it to everybody.  It is NOTHING like canned cream corn, (which I dislike very much).  This one is a FOR SURE keeper!  You are priviledged to have this recipe!!)

Delicious and very easy! I lightened it up by using evaporated milk instead of whipping cream. Also I used replaced the regular salt with a salt seasoning blend and left out the MSG.

This is great creamed corn!  I am using this in a recipe that calls for creamed corn, but I didn't have any.  This tastes just wonderful.  I want to go get it and have a big bowl right now, but I can't.  I put half the thawed corn in a food processer to make the consistency more like canned corn.  This is much better than canned corn, though.  You really don't need to change anything, except I didn't use the MSG because I have an allergy.  I thought it was great without it.

I was looking for something different to go with our prime rib dinner at Christmas and having been to Gullivers in the past, I recall this is the only place I've ever liked cream corn. Tried it on the hubby and kids the other night and they all LOVED it! This will definately be on our table this holiday. (I too left out the MSG and it was excellent!)

Good recipe. I was looking for "drippy corn" that hubby loves and had an abundance of fresh corn I'd cut off the cob. I avoid MSG, so I dashed with some soy sauce. I don't know who Gulliver is, but my Southern family enjoyed this side dish.

This was good, but not quite what I had hoped. I used evaporated milk as suggested by other reviewers in place of regular milk. I also did not use any msg. However, I followed the directions exactly. It just didn't thicken up for me. I ended up adding a bit of cornstarch in desperation, which did help a little. It was good, but I'm not sure it'll be a repeat for us. Thanks for sharing!

This is our favorite creamed corn year round!  Try it with fresh in the summer corn, mmmm.  I lighten it by using 1 C skim and 1 C 2 %, sometimes 1 C half and half instead of 2 %, use Smart Balance instead of butter, no MSG.  I also use my stick blender and chop up what would be about equal to 1/3 of the finished corn mixture.  Adjust sugar to sweetness of the corn.

Amazing recipe.  We followed it to a tee and it was outstanding.  We used fresh milk and cream from the dairy and it was more like a main dish or dessert. To call it a "side dish" was an insult.  People should follow the recipe before rating it, when you change it, add other ingredients and measurements, it is not the same recipe! I never add MSG and it is fabulous!

I used to love creamed corn as a little girl. There was one brand that made it (yes, canned) that was so good. And then they changed their recipe and now it's nasty. So, I've been on a quest of sorts to come up with something I love. I halved this recipe. We have two adults and three children in our family. You can't find 20 oz bags of corn around here, only 16, and that is enough to feed our family, and I didn't want leftovers in case we didn't like it. I used one can of evaporated milk instead of whipping cream and milk. I didn't use any MSG, sugar, or flour. I used both white and cayenne peppers, and added a little nutmeg, and some parmesan cheese. It was okay. Three out of five in our family hated it, one loved it, and I thought it was not bad but not great either. I probably won't be making this one again.

This was good.  I wouldn't say it's the best from this site based on others I've had but it CERTAINLY is BETTER than the canned stuff.  I still prefer "Cream Corn Like No Other" from this site over this or some of the others made in the slow cooker.  I will say that it was fast to prepare and very easy.  I didn't use the Parmesan cheese like other reviewers suggested, maybe I'd give it a try that way sometime.

Meh...this was ok.  I still prefer the canned stuff.  The only change I made was to use 10% cream because that's what I had and I used my immersion blender to give it a buzz and break down some of the corn kernals. In the end, the corn was ok - but very sweet.  I would suggest leaving out the sugar...or at least reducing it by half.

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe and made this for a large Thanksgiving crowd and again for a Holiday party. I omitted the MSG, used evaporated milk instead of regular, and used about 25% less corn than suggested. Yummy!

Only 4 stars but it may have been my fault that it's not a 5.  I didn't have any MSG but otherwise followed the directions.  The corn didn't become soft, it was still very firm corn.  I cooked and cooked it but it still didn't become that creamy texture I was expecting.  I did add about 2 extra tablespoons of butter at the end to kind of give it some flavor.  I'll try it again using the MSG and maybe a fresh package of frozen corn (mine was kinda old in the freezer).

This was the best corn I've ever had!!  I followed the recipe exactly and used cayanne pepper. It gives it that added kick! Will be making this a regular at family functions. Great recipe!!

This turned out very good.  I cut the recipe in half and used one can of evaporated milk, a pinch of nutmeg, 1 tsp white pepper, 1 tsp cayenne pepperand a half teaspoon of sugar.  I also upped the salt to suit or tastes.  We like spicy food and this had just the right heat to it.  My 3 year old devoured a whole big bowl.  I think I'll add this to my Thanksgiving table this year.

So good!  I used evaporated milk and whipping cream & omitted the sugar as suggested by one of the reviewers.  I also made it ahead and re-heated it for 15-20 minutes before serving.  It turned out really yummy.  Just don't think about the calories!

Yummy and easy addition to the meal.  Was excellent following recipe (without MSG).  I did make a roux first with the butter/flour.  I also accidentally added too much cayenne and it was really good.

Wow! This is awesome. It will now be a Thanksgiving regular, fattening as it is. I like my vegetables a little on the crisp side, so I made the sauce and let it thicken real good and then I steamed the corn for a couple of minutes then added it to the sauce. It was so good, but I do need to save it for once or twice a year!

This was served at Gulliver's Restaurant in Irvine by the OC Airport back in the early 70's and was published in a local magazine back then. I cut it out and have been making it off and on when I'm not obsessing about cholesterol and calories.  It is THE BEST creamed corn recipe you will EVER try.  Variation is to put the finished corn in a heat proof casserole, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and place under a broiler until evently browned.  Just makes it a little prettier, but it gets messy quick when everybody digs in!!!!!  Your casserole will get licked clean.

Wow! I didn't think I liked cream corn. Turns out I just don't like canned cream corn. I was in a bind when I realized that the Absolute Mexican Cornbread called for cream corn and I didn't have it...since I thought that I didn't like it. I made this with fat-free half and half and I omitted the MSG. This was really good. I will even be making this as a side dish, now, and not just for use in another recipe. Also, as a sidenote for those of you who do like canned cream corn, this is much better and so easy! Thanks EQUESS3N!

Made this for part of a New Year's buffet. Not only was it easy, it was delicious as well. I left out the MSG and made with milk and evaporated milk, as that is what I had on hand. Can't wait to try with heavy cream.

We’ve made this recipe since the ‘80s. It’s always best with fresh corn but can be made with canned. The restaurant is still going strong as of 12/2019. It’s in So Cal in the city of Irvine right by John Wayne Airport. Has been there forever.

I have the handout recipe from 25 years ago and it had MSG in the recipe but it had been scratched out. Great recipe, works terrific for leftovers. Interestingly, every time I make it, people think it is a corn soup and they dig in for a large bowl. I usually make 4-5 times the stated recipe and it always comes  out perfect.  The frozen corn you get seems to matter and I use C&W with great success. I have never made the evaporated milk version, only the whole milk and sugar version and we can't tell a difference.

Was really delicious in spite of not having the heavy cream. I used half and half and did not add the sugar. I also added a mild dry hatch green Chile and some Lawry's garlic pepper!  this is a keeper!

My mom has been making this recipe for our holidays for as long as I can remember.  She has a paper from Gulliver’s in fact with the recipe. I’ve carried on the tradition with my family and my husband’s family.  It’s super creamy and rich. We do not add the MSG. The hint of spice from the red pepper is a great bite at the end. Overall an easy recipe that you can’t mess up. If it’s appears runny after adding the flour mixture, know that it’ll thicken as it cools. Enjoy!

I've made this twice already and both times it's been a hit. I made the following changes based on the other reviews: took out the MSG, used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, used black ground pepper, and added more sugar than what the recipe calls for since to me, it seemed pretty bland at first. I used about  6 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2. 

This recipe is definitely not for the health conscious folks out there, but if you want to be somewhat healthy, use organic ingredients. That's what I did.  ;)

This is a sinful recipe that has become a holiday favorite at our house after a neighbor shared it with us.  So good, but far too rich to have often.  Great for a potluck, special dinner or once a year for Christmas!  We love it!

I actually split this recipe because I only needed to feed two people and didn't want all the left overs.  It turned out delicious, but the liquid was a bit runny.  Other than cutting down the liquids or increasing the use of flour, any suggestions on how I can make it more creamier?

I've used this recipe for over 10 years and its the best.  My whole family loves it.  It is a bit on the carby side, but on Thanksgiving who cares.  I just started making it one other time of the year, Hannukah!  

Best recipe ever!!!

I'm not a cream corn fan, but this was delicious.  I made it at Thanksgiving and over the summer for a group of 15 and everyone loved it at both occassions.

Amazing. I used evaporated milk in place of milk like other reviewers. Everyone loved it. As a side note, I used corn off of the cob to start with.

I've been making this creamed corn since the mid-70s.  The recipe NEVER called for MSG.  The restaurant had the recipes printed and available on a table in the entry.  And the nice thing was if you wanted more, they would bring it no charge.

I made this along with about 15 other eats for Thanksgiving serving 23 people. Of all the things I made, this was the most ridiculously simple to make and received the most accolades! And it freed up my oven and stove. A real keeper!

SOOOOO happy when I saw this posting. Gulliver's had the best creamed corn but the rest of the food was just ok. I made it for a BBQ (doubled the recipe) and I ended up packing up the last serving as a leftover for a family friend along with printing out the recipe for him. I don't add the MSG because its just not something I had in my kitchen. Highly recommend this recipe!

We have had Gulliver's Corn for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners for years and years.  I originally got the recipe from a friend about 15 years ago.  It isn't the holidays without this delicious creamed corn.  NOTHING LIKE canned cream corn!  We do not use MSG and it's still delish!!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving, but forgot to rate until now.  We enjoyed it so much last year, we had it again this year.  The only change I make is omitting the Sugar.  Will be a Thanksgiving regular for us!!

I don't know about Gulliver's starting in the Bay Area as I'm native Southern California and it was Gullivers in the Long Beach/LA area... went to it as a kid and my mother got this recipe from a friend who served there about 38 years ago!  This has been a staple of our Thanksgiving menu for the past 30 years and is requested EVERY year!  It is delicious!!! Gives a whole new meaning to Cream Corn!!

I am curious if sprinkling in some real cornmeal at the beginning would add flavor & texture to this. Agree that evaporated milk should be used. I was looking for a non-bake side dish for T-Day.

Yes! This is it! I received this recipe from a waitress at Gulliver's in either Burlingame or San Mateo, CA (can't remember which) back in the early '80's. I misplaced my copy and came here to see if I could find it. This is exactly the same and I, too, leave out the MSG. Thanks so much!!! I am glad to find it.

This IS the Gullivers recipe as I remember it.  I got the card from the Waitress back in 1986.  I lost the card but I am SO glad to find it here!  Thank you.  (I ALSO make it without the MSG BTW.)

Yum Yum. I use a potatoe masher to squash some of the corn for that creamed corn effect. Also I add just a bit more seasonings. So good!

Mmmmmmmm...delicious! I made it pretty much as labeled, except I used heavy cream, instead of whipped, because that's what I had in the house. Hope to make it for the next big holiday to amaze my family and friends :)

Not sure if I did something wrong here but basically followed the recipe (except tried to cut the portions down a bit) and it came out liquidy and bland.  Not enough bite/saltiness/sweetness for me.

This was an excellent cream corn but I felt it needed something more so I added a couple tablespoons of Parmesan and it made it really rich and delicious!

Gulliver's still exists!!  There is one very close to the John Wayne Airport in Orange County & there may still be one in Marina Del Rey.  If you want thicker corn, mix a little cornstartch with cold water, then add to corn.  This is a staple on our Thanksgiving table.

Delicious take on traditional southern creamed corn-- though I couldn't help but deviate from the recipe and add a bit of green onion for extra flavor.

I had this dish @ a Holiday Progressive Dinner, where you went from house to house, eating food @ people's houses. The catch: The food that was served was not made by the host family (ladies in the church drew a name of a HOST HOUSE & COURSE, then dropped it off at the house before the party started).  Therefore, all the hostess could tell me about this dish was that it had CORN & WHIPPING CREAM.  So when I got home that night, I looked it up here & found this recipe.  I made it for my ENTIRE family of 22 on Christmas day, served alongside already prepared Ham, Turkey, mashed potatoes & stuffing.  No one knew what was homemade & what was restaurant-bought!  It was so good ... and so easy to make!  My mom is recovering from complications involved with her cancer, so this was the first year that my dad & I were put to work in the kitchen (hince, the prepared turkey, ham, etc).  It was fun introductin a new dish & starting a new tradition for us ... and it being so easy for me was the best part. I felt like a GROWN-UP (I turn 30 this year) cooking Christmas dinner for the first time.  It was a success!

This recipe is DELICIOUS ... and will be used for more than just HOLIDAYS!

This was fantastic! I couldn't find MSG so I used Johnny's poultry seasoning instead (it contains MSG). I had to add twice as much flour to thicken it up. I then transferred it to a baking dish, sprinkled w/ parmesan cheese and baked at 375 until cheese was melted. It was delicious and there were no leftovers!Thank you for a great recipe.

Very rich and delicious!  I used fat-free half and half instead of whipping cream and milk and quite frankly I don't know how it could have been creamier or more rich with the real stuff.  The kids ate it like it was going out of style!

Made this with variations mentioned in orher reviews (omitted sugar, substituted evaporated milk for milk).  Definitely a keeper! Next time I'll add some parmesan cheese as suggested by another reviewer!

This corn was awesome! Served for a family dinner and my guests couldn't get enough. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so good!!!  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks so much for submitting. I never have eaten at Gullivers but can see why people would go there just for the corn!

It was good, but a little bland.  I just addes a little more cayenne pepper and some seasoned salt.

This is the best cream corn I have ever eaten.  My aunt made it for my cousin's wedding and I made it at Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it.  I couldn't find MSG, but it didn't matter, it was wonderful.
