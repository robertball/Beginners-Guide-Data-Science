I love Indian Pudding, and have always had a hard time cooking it. One thing i did learn from a cheif in the family, was when you put it into the oven to bake, put it into a larger pan, or baking dish, filled with water, it helps so the middle isn't runnie.

I used this recipie in a cultural presentation for my college nursing class. At first I thought no one would touch it, but instead everyone loved it!  It has a different texture than expected, and you must like molasses. Also I think its much better served cold than hot....

I liked this recipe a lot!  I tried substituting half of the molasses with honey, but didn't have any so I used half pancake syrup (that's all I had!) and half molasses.  It turned out great!  Also, instead of using whole milk, I used 2% and it came out wonderful.  I put some fat free whip cream on top and it was yummy!  Mine didn't turn out gritty at all like one reviewer said.  It was actually very smooth.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My boyfriend mentioned in passing, how much he liked Indian Pudding. I'd never heard of, eaten, or even seen Indian Pudding. As a surprise, I made this recipe...and loved it. It takes a while to cook it, but my boyfriend said it was "just like Moms." I loved it with Vanilla ice cream on top.

Wow. A nice thing to whip up; it's unbelieveably easy to make, and is a lovely textured treat. I only had demerara sugar, so there was a STRONG molasses taste, but I liked that. My boyfriend said he would give it a miss, and the next time I looked, he'd taken two pieces, one after another! Gues he liked it too... ;) You could probably substitute honey for the molasses if you don't like such a strong flavour. I'll give that a go next time & report back...

My family really liked this pudding. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. My husband said it reminded him of pumpkin pie.  I followed the ingredients exactly (used 1% milk since it didn't specify) but I baked the pudding in 4 (10 oz.) ramekins.  It set up perfectly.  I think maybe the people that had trouble with setting up didn't cook it on the stove long enough.  You have to bring it to a full rolling boil and stir constantly until it is very thick, almost like oatmeal.  It took the full 10 minutes of cooking to get thick enough. If you miss that step no matter how long you bake it in the oven it will not set up. This was a great comfort food and I will absolutely make it again.

I tried this recipe and I loved it  and it made the house smell great  when it was baking in the oven.
I also put a big scoop of brighams  vanalla ice cream on it.
It was a perfect desert for a cold winter day.
I am wondering if I should try it next time with apples or nuts or raisens.
It came out of the oven solid on the top but soft on the inside and since this is the first time I tried it I do not know if that is the way it is suppose to turn out  but I liked and I will make it again and again.

I really like this pudding.  It has a very nice custard consistency.  The molasses flavor is strong, but I like molasses a lot.  It is time consuming though.  My pudding came out very sweet because I was short on molasses, so I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar.  The original recipe is probably not so sweet.  I will make this again.

Not good. I followed the recipe to the "T". It was runny, somewhat bitter, and my family hated it. I guess I'll have to get Mama's recipe.this just shows that many 5 star reviews do not a sure-fire winner make.

I followed the directions EXACTLY. After baking 2 hours it's still had not set. The flavor was just OK. Perhaps, if it had set-up firmer and was less runny, it would have looked more appealing. Will not make again!

This was really good, mostly because I love molasses. I doubled the ginger and cinnamon and would decrease the milk next time, by about 1/2 c. because it took twice the time to bake than the recipe suggested. Maybe it was the humidity of the cornmeal that I had. I WILL be making this again for the Thanksgiving holiday when they do the corn harvest around here. Thank you for sharing this rare recipe!

This was easy to make and the flavor was wonderfully intense. I added the dry ingredients slowly with a whisk so as to avoid lumps and may have ended up cooking it too long. It passed the thickened stage, became runny again, and stayed that way through the baking. After refrigerating the consistency was much thicker. It's perfect warmed in a bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Thanks for this recipe. This was as good as ones I had as a little girl! Keep stirring the milk mixture as mine burned a bit with the molasses at the bottom of the pan. However, the burnt bottom did not transfer it's taste into the pudding. Serve with heavy whipped cream!

I've never tasted Indian Pudding, so I read all the reviews and then tried it with these modifications. I subbed 1/4 C Masa for corn meal (reduced gritty texture), honey for molasses, pumpkin pie spice for cinnamon and ginger, Splenda for sugar, and used skim milk. I cooked it till it thickened up, but it didn't take 10 minutes. Might need less Masa next time as I think this was a bit thicker than other reviewers described. I also baked this as you would any custard, in a water bath, even though it didn't contain eggs. Might try another variation with two eggs and 2 tablespoons of Masa just to see if I like that better. It seemed like a lot of raters were going for a mild pumpkin pie taste, and while I liked this, anyone wanting a traditional Indian pudding might not. 

P.S. If you don't like the gritty texture of cornmeal, process dry cornmeal in a blender or food processor until it becomes flour, and then use the corn flour in the recipe. I chose Masa instead because it has a better B vitamin profile.

It had a sort of a pumpkin pie taste- but a very funny texture. I liked it fairly well, but my family didn't feel the same way. They thought it had a little too much molasses in it.

Very good. Next time I will add a teaspoon of vanilla extract though.
The people who didn't like it because it was to strong of molasses
flavor. There are different kinds of molasses. There are three runs done on the same cane stalks. First run is mild. Tastes like a mix
of molasses, honey,& buttery corn syrup. Second run is stronger more bitter,and darker. The third run is called Black strap. It's the strongest darkest run. Most of what you see in grocery stores is second and third run mixed together. I buy first run from the Amish. It's so much better tasting I eat a little of it with a spoon when using it. Easy was to tell is by color. Lighter is getter.

I really had high hopes for this but the result was somewhat disappointing.  To be fair, I did like it when it just came out of the oven, but when it cooled down, I could barely take a bite.  I'll give it another try tomorrow, and this time I will heat it up.

Interesting recipe.  You really need to like molasses.  I might try it again w/o the molasses.  Pretty good with vanilla ice cream.

I made this for an Autumn themed party a while ago. I personally don't care for puddings like this but everyone at the party loved it and demanded the recipe. Will definitely make again.

I found this had kind of a funny texture to it. It could have been the cornmeal I used, but it was very gritty. The flavor was ok--I really like molasses, but I'm not sure I'd make it again due to the unpleasant texture.

Sorry, but didn't like this recipe, too much molasses and too much ginger. I even added some brown sugar. I really like my late Mother-in-law's recipe for Indian Pudding and this is what I will continue to use.

I didn't know what an "indian pudding" could be, but the title of the recipe just appealed to me, and so did the ingredients. I substitued 1/2 of the molasses with honey (because my sister is not very fond of molasses), and I think I will always do it this way (I rather like a subtle molasses flavor than a strong taste). This dessert was even good served hot, warm or cold.

I made Indian Pudding  years ago and that recipe called for eggs; this one did not.  I was a bit skeptical at first wondering if it would "set up" properly.  I did "lighten" the recipe up a little and used Skim Milk instead of whole and added a touch of fresh ground nutmeg.  It did set up dispite it seeming very "mushy" coming out of the oven.  And since it wasn't covered you have a "film" on the top.  I may try covering it during the baking next time to eliminate that film, even though it didn't really take anything away from the pudding's flavor.  The molassas definately dominated the taste.  So for anyone who doesn't like molassas this is not for you.  OR...as some other's did, substitute honey for the molassas. We served it warm with a whipped topping.  Needless to say, it's gone.  It was very, very good.

WOW is right! Like RELI8 suggested, I used honey instead of molasses because thats all I had. It turned out great! An interesting and yummy texture. I will definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I've had this in the oven for 2 1/2 hours and it's still liquid. I live at 7,000 ft so maybe the higher altitude requires adjustments. Too bad, because the flavor is great. I'll just leave it in the oven until it firms up and next time try using less milk.

I added 2 beaten eggs (with a little of the milk) towards the end of the stovetop cooking, to make it thicker and richer. Probably didn't need to bake it but I did. We all liked it.

Love the recipe. Followed it to the letter and it was exactly what  we remember from our youth.
It is so good- some may feel it's an acquired taste but we can't wait to share it with or grandkids for this SundaY's dinner!!
So grateful to have found it !!!!

I also prefer it to be made using half honey, half molasses. I make it pretty often, we love it so much. A great recipe!
