My 7 year old made this for me  for Mother's day and we all loved it!  Very easy for kids with a little help from Dad.

Tried with nuts and without nuts and liked w/out nuts much better. So I put picture of "favorite" on. So glad I used blueberry pie filling and is complimented the pound cake very much. It added to a great variety of store bought pound cake recipes that will be served after dinner.
