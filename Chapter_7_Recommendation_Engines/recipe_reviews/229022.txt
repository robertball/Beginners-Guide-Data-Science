I loved this recipe. My husband gobbled it up like a wild turkey. I added onion powder since I did not have a green onion and I used plain vinegar since I did not have rice wine vinegar. It was still wonderful. I will save it and use it again.

Delicious.  Used two limes as I wasnâ€™t sure how much juice I was getting out of them.  Tasted the lime and the ginger just fine.  Took recommendation of another, set aside some of the marinade before dropping the pork into it so that I could make a sauce from it.    So nice over riced cauliflower.  Highly recommend and will make again.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe! I marinated it for 4 hours, and used pork chops instead tenderloin strips. Then, I heated up some of the marinade and put it over mashed potatoes and the pork chops. We will definitely be making this again! :)

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made exactly as directed except after tasting I added 3 more dashes of chile garlic sauce.  I marinated mine for almost 6 hours and served this with rice and broccoli.  I also poured a little of the pan juices over it for extra flavor.

If I made this again, I would reduce the soy sauce to  1/2 cup. I found the sauce heavy and found the mix of ingredients lost much of the flavour.

Very tender and flavorful, although the soy sauce overpowered any ginger or lime flavor. Next time, I would cut back the soy and add more ginger & lime to the marinade

I used some of the marinade along with the minced garlic and warmed this up with the juice of one lime.  I made brown rice and served the warm sauce over the meat and rice.  I also dusted the tenderloin pieces with flour before I pan seared them.  Fabulous flavors!

My kids loved getting to eat Ramen noodles. We all loved the flavor. I'll be making it again.

This recipe really makes for tender pork when it is low-fat and not marbled. I didn't select the recipe but did the cooking, so I was doubtful about all the sugar - but it is really needed because of the mild almost bitter bite, which is just delicious - and could have been served to us on a plate at a high end restaurant the flavors were so layered. With several simple vegetables served all around it, this pork just dominated the plate and ... luckily we had leftovers to serve as slices with sweet apple slices the next day.

Great recipe, very easy to do. Hubby and I devoured it last night!  Will cut marinade amount in half next time as it was too much for one tenderloin. Really appreciate not having to turn on my oven in hot Florida.

This was a good little recipe. We paired it with egg noodles and we turned the marinade into a sauce instead of tossing it by boiling it down and adding a cornstarch slurry. 
There was a little too much lime for us, so I will probably only squeeze half of one next time. Also, I didn't have chile-garlic powder like it called for. I should have added more garlic in that case.
All and all a good recipe. Plenty of room to play but a solid base.

Ginger Lime Pork Tenderloin Haiku: "Followed exactly, all the great flavors were lost. Marinate longer?" I stayed true to the recipe, and marinated my pork tenderloin for easily 4+ hours, but we couldn't really detect any of the lime or ginger; mostly soy sauce unfortunately.
