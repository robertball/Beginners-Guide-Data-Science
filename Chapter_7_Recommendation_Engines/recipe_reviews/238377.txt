We LOVED these! This is not the light, crispy batter that is usually found on onion rings, but a more heavy batter (still crispy), which we really enjoyed! The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the batter, which was a great addition. I also did a few slices of zucchini to see how it would turn out, and it was equally as delicious! I will def be using this recipe for o.rings (AND fried zucchini) again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This batter tastes good, however, its way too thick and dense. They came out having a very cake like consistency instead of being crispy. Since I did like the flavor, I may try it again but with less flour and more milk.

So easy! Instead of ice, we simply put the tray of onion slices in the freezer for 10 minutes before battering.

To be honest, I didn't measure anything, just estimated, based on this recipe - by the time I started googling for it, the oil was already hot, LOL.. But the result was brilliant - probably the best onion rings I've had in my life! =D

Exceedingly thick, and therefore gets only partial coverage.  Stick fairly well to the pnion.

I used this for chicken (with Panda Express Orange Sauce). My entire family enjoyed it. I used the left over batter for mozzarella cheese sticks. After coating the sticks in batter, I rolled them in Italian bread crumbs and fried them for about 30 seconds.

I didn't make any changes because I didn't need to.  We loved them and make them at least once a week. They are so light and crispy. One thing I learned is to make sure the onion rings are a closed ring and not broken as they unravel and don't cook as well.   Totally recommend it. They are super easy and yummy

Well, it stuck to the onions, that's about the only positive thing I have to say. It had no flavor and was cake-like and not crunchy at all.

I really liked the flavor of this batter! 
Some of the mistakes I made on the first batch were that i like my rings light so i didn't have the heat up super high but by the time I got them to the right color the onions were pretty much gone....
So next batch i did pretty high temp and that was the ticket! high heat for a short amount of time!
Also i like them a little crispier so i would add some cornstarch to the batter...

OMG, so delicious.  I used red onions because they don't upset my digestion as bad, and the sweetness of them was nice.  This  batter was soooo yummy.  I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder as someone suggested in the comments.  I had to turn the heat down to medium. which is probably just a function of my high altitude.  I put the batter bowl very close to the frying pan because the batter did slip off easily.

I followed the recipe, and those were the most bland onion rings I've ever had. They tasted like some kind of nondescript food doused in a tasteless batter and deep fried. I threw the whole lot out. 

FWIW, I had never heard of soaking the onions in ice water for an hour. I think that takes the flavor out of the onion. Just sayin'....

My  first attempt was horrible. I chose to use breadcrumbs but they wouldn't stick to the batter and they got all clumped up. I didn't have any vegetable oil , i used olive and i think that ruined the batter. However, the second time, i put my onion rings in the freezer for ten minutes, made the batter (i used plain flour instead), dipped the onion rings in flour THEN put the batter  on, and then put on the breadcrumbs. I made the breadcrumbs myself. I just made some toast, cut it up, and put it in the food processor. They were a little wet so i toasted them in the frying pan. And i used canola oil instead of vegetable oil :)

I did not drive it onion rings off as well as I could have before I battered them. The moisture created steam between the onion and the batter which lifted the coating off of the onion rings on many of them. Flavor-wise they were perfect and crunch wise they were absolutely awesome.

Just made these. Recipe is almost perfect. After. Reading other reviews, the only thing I agree with and would change is adding a bit more flavor. Will DEFINATELY use this recipe again.

Not what I expected. became soft immediately  after removing from oil.  Taste and texture didn't pair  well with onions for me. This batter would be best suited for  deep fried mushrooms. The addition of baking powder or soda or both would yield a crisper lighter coating., as this seemed heavy and overpowering .

The only change I made to this recipe is dipping the onion rings in flour before battering them. I did this because when I did not do this the breading was not sticking in the pan. Overall this is a pretty easy recipe and I would try it again!

Good recipe, but plain. I added garlic salt to give the batter more flavor. 

Very easy to make. I cut the onions thin and cooked them in layers.

I will definitely make these again.  I used coconut oil in a frying pan because I was out of vegetable oil and the onion rings were light and not greasy at all.

Made this recipe with no changes.                                 The batter was tasteless, like pancakes.                                 Soggy a minute after taking them out of the oil.                     Looking for something more crispy

I have made this a couple times! super easy and delicious ?? only thing is after working a couple batches, the first ones become kind of soggy. I haven't figured out a way to combat this yet.

They came out great! I used cracker crumbs instead and soaked them in an ice bath for 30 mins prior to starting. Will use this recipe again.

Exceeded expectations! Plus I made this at 3 am starving after a whole day of procrastination and sleep, so anything goes. I tweaked the recipe a bit - I added half a cup of cornstarch and paprika and pepper, for a spicy kick.

Addicting they are so good. Light and mildly crunchy. Some complain about thickness of batter, ours did not have this problem. Perhaps because they sat on plates before frying and shed extra batter? We chilled onions in ice water & put batter on top to chill too. Just as good second day heated in a toaster oven.

I added some Adobo seasoning for flavor.  Next time I will probably add a couple other spices for additional flavor, but the base recipe is great.  Never had onion rings turn out better.  Coating was binded to onion perfectly, far better than any of my past attempts.  They looked just like the photo in on the recipe page.  Make sure to fry until a bit past the golden stage, as they will not be crispy enough, in my opinion.  But when crisp enough, they're great.

These would be an embarrassment to serve to anyone. They were soggy and tasteless even after a second frying. I made about 6 of them to try out and was shocked to find that one minuet coming out of the fry oil they were soggy. I tried frying them a second time and they came out just the same. An utter disappointment, they were thrown out.

Too thick, if you're looking for pancake like batter around onions then this is the recipe for you. Going in i was expecting a thick crispy batter but after frying for five minutes on each side, there was still no crispy batter.

Love this recipe. It was way to thick, added more milk to thin it out and it worked much better with thinner batter. I added lots of other spices to add more flavor. I added pepper, creole all-spice, garlic powder, and a dash of cayenne.  Fabulous flavor and texture.

My family loved these onion rings. I used skim milk and the batter was not too thick; rather, it was just right. I used 1 tsp. of garlic powder. I don't think it changed the taste much at all. I might add more next time. I will make these again. I used Candy onions and they were super good.

Pretty good onion ring recipe.  I did add 1/2 tsp garlic powder as suggested by others.  Next time I will add a little more salt and thin the batter just little.  Overall pretty good, my husband loved them as is.
