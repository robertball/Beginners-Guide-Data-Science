I read all the reviews and then made a few changes to the original recipe.
I used almost 8 cups of rhubarb instead of the 6 and after cooking until soft, I added a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple along with the jello (which was sugarfree), and light cherry pie filling.  I brought it all to a boil and then slow boiled for about 20 minutes, to thicken, stirring often.  I water bath canned in sealed jars for about 15 minutes.  I can really taste all three flavors in the jelly and it's not oversweet.  Fantastic on toast, ice cream, and I'm sure will be great with ham.

This is a good recipe.  The cherry gelatin flavor is a bit overpowering.  Next time I will use a 3oz package of cherry gelatin and a 3 oz package of unflavored gelatin instead of a 6 oz. pkg of cherry gelatin.  I will make it again!!

I tried this recipe as is and then again with some small changes.  We found the cherry version tasted a little too much like cherry jello.  However, when we substituted wildberry pie filling and raspberry jello - it turned out fantastic.  Killer when heated up and served over ice cream!  Next time I'll try rhubarb strawberry pie filling and strawberry jello.  Very good recipe with lots of possibilities!

This was a nice jam.  I also found it very strong with Cherry flavor!  Also VERY sweet!  Will cut back on sugar or add more rhubarb.  Also will ruduce the cherry jello.  This one has promise though!!

I made this jam during the summer, and my husband loved it so much that I made a second batch.  I then made a third batch using strawberry pie filling and strawberry Jello.  The result was fabulous!

This is a delicious recipe to use the large crop of rhubarb I usually have in my garden.  It's great to pull out of the freezer on a cold winter morning to eat on toast.

This is an excellent recipe, of which I've also tried with pineapple. I have been using jello with jam recipes for years, strawberry being the best but this is a close second.

I doubled this recipe, but only used one package of cherry jello.  It is very good, a nice taste of cherry without an overpowering cherry jello flavor.  This recipe is now one of my fav's!

This is very good and easy to make. I increased the rhubarb to 8 cups and then followed rest of ingredients as given in the recipe. I froze several containers and water bathed 6 jars. By increasing the rhubarb, the cherry was not overwhelming and the jam had a subtle tartness. I'm fond of almond, so as one reviewer suggested I'd like to try that next time.  It's a versatile recipe, easy and tasty. Thank you Nancy

I used the cherry pie filling but substituted lemon jello because that is what I had on hand, and it was fantastic. Not too sweet and tasted wonderful! My family loves it.

This was super easy and I'm a beginner!  I would agree that the cherries overpowered the rhubarb though (I even used the suggestion of using 1/2 flavored Jello and 1/2 plain), so next time I'll cut back on the pie filling.

I made this a little different since I couldn´t find any Cherry pie filling, don´t think we have it here in Iceland.  I used crushed pineapple and Rasberry jello and it was SUPER!! The only this that I would change is the sugar, I´m going to use less of it next time.  This is such an easy recipe that you can modify as you please, very good. This will be a regular in this household :)

I made a change and that was two add 3oz of cherry jello and 3 oz raspberry since  others chad said too much cherry jello flavor.  Also I got from another recipe on this site to bring to rolling boil and boil 10 minutes.  This breaks the fruit down even more giving a prettier appearance in my opinion.

This was easy to make and very good.  Also used apple pie filling because that was what I had.  It turned out really good.
