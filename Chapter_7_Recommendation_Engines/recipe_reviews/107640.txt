This is a white russian (coffee liqueur = kahlua).  I've made a few espresso martinis in my day, though, and can say that the best way is: shot of espresso, vanilla vodka, and kahlua (or whatever sweetened coffe-ish liqueur you prefer).  If you like yours creamy, add Baileys (although I tried it once with Amarula, and my oh my it was tasty! So, really, a creamy liqueur of your preference).  ... and like with many martinis... shake that thing till you can't shake any more - a frothy beverage is a good one.

Most excellent.

I made one as the recipe stated, and with the second, I added half an ounce 
of irish creme. Smooth, but with a bite.
I could see myself becoming friendly with these quite often. ;)

I don't think I would like this as something to have before dinner because it was a bit sweet and heavy.  I could easily see this as an accompaniment to a light dessert, like a chocolate mousse, or on its own. Odd that this recipe states it's two servings - I made this for Naples and I and got two mini martinis out of it.  While it was perfect for the two of us, be advised that it didn't amount to much more than a shot glass per serving.

Um...where is the espresso? Should have espresso to be called an Espresso Martini. But I tried it anyway and it was good.

A White Russian... in a martini glass.  Add a dash of espresso powder to the top...still good though.

This was pretty good. I kept the alcohol amounts the same but the cut the amount of milk in half, and it made one perfect martini.

This was even better using Godiva chocolate liquor, and half and half.  Need to figure out what to put around rim of glass for the ultimate.

It is delicious the way the recipe calls for.  Next time, I might add a splash of espresso.  But not necessary.

This recipe is good it needs an ounce of espresso or other strong coffee. I subbed Baileys for the milk to give it an extra kick. Otherwise it's pretty tasty.

Hit the spot. I did feel it was missing something. Not quite sure what is was, but it did go down just fine!
