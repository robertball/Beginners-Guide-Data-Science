The flavor of these cookies is excellent, however when baked at 275 as indicated in the recipe they become thin and spead out and are not attractive. I baked the first pan as directed and was very disappointed. The next two pans I increased the heat to 350 and the results were much better. Whatever you do, don't forget to spray the pan! :-)

WOW! I was amazed at the flavor and how simple they were to make!  I now have a good recipe that uses just egg whites.  I never know what to do with them after making homemade noodles.  I do suggest letting the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before removing them because the bottoms seem to fall out of them.  I will make again!

This is the perfect recipe for when you're at someone else's house for the holidays... it doesn't use a bunch of flour, which is something people only keep if they bake a lot.  Warning: the cookies get gooey and flat if there's not enough chunky stuff inside.  I used chopped pecans and chocolate chips.  Also, I took the other reviewer's advice and set my oven to 350.  They're done before they look done, I took them out when the edges were getting brown.  Liberally grease your pan, a light coating won't do the trick.  Not a pretty cookie, but very, very yummy, and economical!

These cookies were very tasty, but mine came out extremely flat.  I do not know why, but I will try to make them again and see how it goes a second time.  I whipped until the eggs were stiff, but the cookie mix still ran on when put on the pan.  Good, but I won't make a third time if they run again.

Delicious! The only thing I changed was the oven temp. to 325...i tried it at 350 as suggested in other reviews, but they spread out too thin and burned on the bottom..they turned out perfect @ 325 for 15 min.

The cookies were good, however very sweet. I also baked at 350 for 12 min.  I will be adding this recipe to my favorites list.

They appear to be a chewy nutty meringue cookie. I found it to be a bit too sweet so maybe put a little less sugar. Overall, I think it's a good cookie for the time and effort put into it.

So, are you supposed to beat whites until stiff like meringue? Mine came out with a much lighter color with giant cracks. It's a chewy/fluffy meringue cookie with nuts. 
Also, if you have a silicone mat, use it. I just lifted the mat and peeled the meringue off. Did not spread out, but did poof up quite a bit. Took about 20 min on 350.

These cookies are very tasty and the centers are chewy. I followed the recipe but chopped my nuts pretty fine. I also cooked them at 350 for 13 minutes. They did spread pretty thin but I like my cookies like that. I will be making more of these for Christmas.

These are good but they did not spread so teaspoons are a little small to measure out the batter.  No way could I get 3 dozen cookies out of this recipe and I like small cookies!  I got 18.

A light, fluffy, meringue-y texture.  I feel that the temperature needs to be on 350 degrees, and the cookies baked for 10 - 15 minutes.
