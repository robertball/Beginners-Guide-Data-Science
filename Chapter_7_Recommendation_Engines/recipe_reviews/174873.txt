There is a boxed mix in the grocery stores that has this dessert in prepackaged pre measured form - you even get a pan for it.  The grocery store version is more like candy than fudge but it is very good.  IMHO, white chocolate is sweeter than chocolate fudge lovers are probably used to but it is different and I loved it.  So did my dinner guests and kids.  My kids are crazy over anything cookies and cream.  So, this recipe is on my holiday baking list this year. Good stuff.

I rated this based on the original recipe, which was good but way too sweet.  I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and it turned out great. It literally tasted like the ice cream.

I had never made fudge before and was very nervous, but this recipes is super easy and delicious!  I brought it to work and everyone loved it! It is creamy and not dry like fudge can be.

This is REALLY too sweet. Cut back on the sugar.
