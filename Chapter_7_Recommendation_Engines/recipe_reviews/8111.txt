A basically good cake but this recipe needs some refinement.  I make it yesterday for my boyfriend's birthday... it made a 3-layer cake as the recipe stated and it was a very dense cake.....although moist.  The flavour was OK but I feel that it needed more of the white chocolate flavour in the cake itself.  The icing was very sweet and also needed more of the white chocolate flavour and a way to cut the almost overpowering sweetness.  If I were to make this recipe again I would downsize it to a 2-layer cake... the 3-layer was ungainly to handle and with the three layers, too big a slice for people, even sliced very thin, which was dicfficult to do.  Maybe a tube or bundt pan plus cupcakes would be better instead of three layers???  The icing recipe made a lot of icing and I have a bunch left over and I used a lot on the cake too!  We love icing!  The cake goes well with fresh strawberries but as I discovered yesterday, do not put sliced fresh strawberries between the layers as they cause the cake to slide around!  I fed 10 people and have a big chunk leftover but a lot of the pieces had to be thrown out as people could not eat that much cake!  Live and learn!  I think I might try this one again but on a smaller scale as not to waste these delicious and expensive ingredients!

I have made this cake a few times, and it is delicious.  It is a little complicated if you are normally a box cake kind of person.  I won grand champion at our county fair and it went for big bucks.  I have passed this on to many other people and they have all loved it.  It doesn't have a strong chocolate taste, but it is wonderful, although a bit pricey for all the ingredients!

I didn't taste much white chocolate in this cake at all.  It was not any thing like I thought it would be, for advanced cooks it would be a fairly simple cake to make althought it was not quick.  The cake itself was very dense and resembled a hummingbird cake and the icing tasted more like a cream cheese icing than a  mixture of white chocolate and cream cheese.  Also the recipe made way more than was needed for the cake.

I made the cake for one of our employees who was leaving our company and who was also allergic to milk chocolate. This was an excellent cake that everyone loved!

This is a big cake like they used to make long time ago.  It was delicious although a little dense. 
I would make it again even though it is a little complicated and time consumming.
