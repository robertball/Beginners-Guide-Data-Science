I gave this recipe 5 stars although I changed a primary ingredient - white "chocolate" (IMHO- a  crime against real chocolate lovers everywhere :) to 4 oz of Ghirardelli's Semi-Sweet chocolate chips. The baking time was dead-on for the 4 small baking dishes that I used (just split it evenly between them, about 6 oz each). They were chilled for almost 24 hours before eating. Used raw sugar for the topping & my culinary torch instead of the broiler so it didn't really need to be rechilled. Kept one of these, before topping, in the frig for 3 days before eating and it was just as good, possibly better, then the first time around. Chocolate bliss!

Great recipe and my new favorite dessert! The water bath works great. I used a pancake turner to lift the ramkins out of the water. And used my toaster oven on broil to carmelize the sugar and it took less than one minute. Stay with it during the carmelizing process to make sure it doesn't burn.  Since I had a big dinner group, I carmelized the sugar and left them in the fridge for three hours before serving and they were delicious chilled all the way through. Added strawberries right before serving. My guests loved every morsel. Rave reviews with many requests for the recipe.

this is my go-to creme brulee recipe (i'm a beginner creme brulee maker). i've made three flavors with this recipe: this flavor, caramel chocolate, and peanut butter chips in place of chocolate. they've all been delicious but this flavor was the best. the only changes i would recommend are: use boiling or near boiling water around the ramekins and have the pan in the oven already- otherwise when you go to move it some of the water might slosh into the ramekin. also, i cooked mine at 325 degress for 35 minutes and they came out perfect! let them cool a couple hours before adding sugar and torching. and they get better after a night in the fridge. no need to rechill after torching either. i might use half and half next time- it makes enough for 7 small ramekins and that's a lot of calories if you aren't sharing with a lot of people! cutting the recipe in half would work too.

What a fantastic desert. Made this yesterday had some today and if you love chocolate your gonna love this rich and creamy brilliant desert.  Use only the best heavy cream, ( land o lakes) organic heavy cream, and place a towel on the bottom of your roasting pan. fill with boiling water to the half way point of the ramekin. Great tip to get rid of those bubbles pour through a strainer before you pour into ramekins. If you still have a few bubbles use your brulee torch on em and they will disappear. if you dont have a brulee torch trust me buy one at bed bath and beyond. good luck....  :)

It was easy to make and delicious. To caramelize the sugar better, I mixed equal parts brown and white sugar and then put it in my toaster oven for about 3 minutes. It had to be refrigerated again after being caramelized, so in the future, I will use a blowtorch to caramelize.

Great recipe -just a tip for brulee in general-use your microwave and a large (1 0r 2 quart) measuring cup. makes pouring custard much easier and no burning bottoms! use big cup for the hot water bath pouring also.

The addition of white chocolate makes this one of the best creme brûlée's EVER!!!! This time I didn't have heavy cream so I used half & half and it still turned out wonderful. I truly recommend this if you like custard desserts.

This recipe was terrible.  The egg curdled.  Maybe I baked it for too long, or maybe it scrambled while I mixed the chocolate mix to the egg whites.  Regardless,  I will probably not try it again.

Hands down, one of the best Creme Brulee recipes I've ever had. This entire batch was gone within 24 hours, devoured by my parents and I. It's rich, creamy, smooth, and absolutely delicious. I can't wait to make this again. Yumyum!

Creme Brulee is one of my favorite dishes, and I always wanted to make it.  This sounded relatively easy, so I tried it and followed others recommendations.  I used semisweet chocolate chips, and it was delicious.  Very rich, but the portions are small, so that was OK.  I put too much sugar on and then it took too long to carmelize under the broiler and the edges started to burn.  It was easy to pull it off and start over with less sugar.  I also rearranged my ramekins so that they were all directly under the broiler to try to get more even carmelization, but next time I will do them in batches of four (I doubled the recipe and made 8 total) so that I can watch them more carefully.  I will make this again with the white chocolate.

SO DELISH!! the only thing I did not do is let the heavy cream simmer, It was almost there and I used less chocolate, but it was still Yummy and not as sweet! I light coated sugar on top, and the boyfriend torched it (it's his favorite part). It was the best creme brulee! We made this for our friend who was proposing to his girlfriend

This was the first time I've ever tried to make Creme Brulee and it came out very yummy! I cut the recipe in half and used one ramekin. I used what we had on hand - half and half instead of heavy cream, 4 white chocolate truffles instead of the white chocolate baking bar. My ramekin said no broiler on the bottom, but I did anyway - only for 2 minutes, I was a bit nervous... I would've rather used a torch, but didn't have one on hand!

I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips as I love chocolate-- but I'm sure white will work--a chef's  torch works much better than the broiler--Wonderful Feb 14 dessert!!! Garnish with White chocolate dipped strawberries and a few raspberries-

I have made this many times - it is sooo easy and everyone loves it!!  I usually use "good" milk chocolate (from a slab or bunny from a local chocolatier) instead of the white chocolate.  Otherwise I follow exactly (I have on 2 occasions forgotten the vanilla and it was fine) PERFECT every time!

Great recipe, no problems making delicious creme brulee.  I used a 3.5oz. white chocolate bar found at the store and vanilla bean paste.  I made this a day ahead since custards taste way better after cooling for 24 hours.

OH MY YUM!  So good and super easy to make.  I'm only regretting that I didn't make a double batch!  If you can use a torch, the sugar carmelizes much better then broiling it.

WOW! Oh my was this ever amazing! Tonight I was meeting two of my significant others grand children and I wanted to make something special for them. They're little but I figured every kid loves custard so why not. Well let me say that the two of them got the biggest charge out of grandpa torching their dessert! Like others I decided to use milk chocolate instead of the white and it was  absolutely fabulous to say the very least. This is worth many more than just five stars! Thank you!

I made the creme brulee and it turned very yummy! My husband loved it! I gave a star less because of the cooking time mentioned in the recipe. It took me more than 1hour 20mins to cook. When I checked them on 300 degree F after 45mins, they were still liquidy. I had read somewhere that they take more than an hour and so I increased the time. Finally I increased the temperature to 390 and then they were done. I am not sure if I  have overcooked them, but they were just like the ones I tasted in restuarants, so I am happy!

I would give this dish ten stars if I could! I usually tend to agree with Blondebiker on the validity of "white chocolate" but I decided to go with it. Boy was it worth it. I made the dish exactly as instructed with one exception. I don't have ramekins but I do have oven safe teacups so I used them. It turned out beautifully. I will definitely make this again for special occasions or just for the heck of it!

Really... how could this NOT be tasty? Personally, I thought they were a bit liquidy, but I left the second batch in the fridge for two days and they were better than the first batch. Watch them carefully under the broiler. I wish I had a little torch!

So easy and delicous.  My ramekins were very small so this made 9 servings.  They were perfect.

This is one of the best I've ever tasted.  I didn't have any white chocolate so I substituted milk chocolate instead.  It turned out great.

Made this for our Christmas dinner and it is fantastic. I wanted a rich, thick, creamy custard for filling chocolate cups. I made this recipe the day before our dinner and let it set in the refrigerator overnight. Then I spooned it into the cups and served without the caramelized sugar on top. Everyone loved it! It was easy to make and perfect consistency and taste.

Five stars is not enough. You cant quit, it has to have crack or some kind of drug in it. A very strict health conscious friend that always worries about too much sugar and fat, tried this and ate 2 1/2 of them before he got eater's remorse.
Its my go to desert.

I made this for a friend once (probably about 6 months ago), and he went crazy over it!  He still comments on how amazing it was.  I recently celebrated his birthday with him and made him a coupon for any dessert he'd like, and of course, he picked this one.  VERY good, silky, smooth dessert.  Not too hard to make.

This recipe is fantastic!  I followed it to a tee and thought it rivaled any creme brulee I have ever ordered in a restaurant. I used white choclate chips instead of the crushed up bar and they melted so easy and I didn't have to stir the mixture hardley at all.  

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could, I recomend this to anyone who is looking for a wow dessert.

This was my first time making creme brulee... I was always intimidated by the name of it, but it was so easy to make. Everyone raved about it and I have requests to make it again very soon.

Wow! This is fantastic!  I multiplied this recipe 4 times for my birthday lunch bash, and the ladies absolutely loved it!  Said it was truly the best Creme Brulee they had ever eaten!  Only extra thing I did, mainly to break the very sweet taste, was (just before serving) to top the desert with a thin layer of fresh granadilla, and then decorated it further with a slice of kiwi fruit and a raspberry.  The tartness of the fruits with the sweet - to die for!!  Thanks for the recipe - my friends think I'm the greatest now!

This was absolutely wonderful.  My boyfriend's favorite dessert is creme brulee, so I wanted to make it for him -- especially since the reviewers said it was so easy.  They were right.  It was easy, and it came out great!!!  He absolutely loved it! I loved it, and I don't even like creme brulee -- but it was so good.  I was extra careful with each step, so that I didn't mess anything up.  It was great and I will definitely make it again.  I'll try it with caramel to see how that tastes, but honestly, this was so good, I can just keep making this.  Using the broiler for the top was absolutely fine.  After I make it a couple more times, I may get a torch just for the fun of it, but it's definitely not necessary.  Anyway, thanks for the great recipe.  It tasted wonderful!

Great recipe! I've made a few alterations since I've made it a few times, but this one cut and dry is delicious! Everyone begs me for the recipe and raves about it. I highly suggest buying a torch just to wow your friends on holidays. TIP! If you accidentally curdle your eggs or boil them in the oven, just liquefy in the blender (while hot) and proceed to transfer them to the fridge. No one will ever know the difference;)

This recipe is great but I cannot handle the amount of sweetness. I would change sugar from 1/3 cup to 1/4 cup instead.

This was a Perfect recipe for my first time. Very successful & tasty. Made it 2x this month. The second time the sugar looked strange & bubbly but I am using the broiler in my oven. Still Great flavor & texture.

The taste is amazing!! The only problem is the amount for me was off. It said it would fill four 6-inch ramekins. I only have 4-inch ramekins so I thought it would fill more, but it only filled 4 of them. I followed the recipe exactly.

I do not have 6" ramekins.  Mine measure 3" across and 1.5" deep.  I filled six almost to the top, and placed them in the water bath in the oven at 300.  At 45 minutes they were obvious still sloshing around, and so I kept resetting the time for 5 more minutes.  They were perfectly set at 1 hr. 10 min.  I think the extra depth of the smaller-diameter dishes adds to the cooking time. I did use a torch for the top and added a garnish of fresh berries.  That said, this is a fantastic recipe, easily as good as any creme brulee I've had at nice restaurants, and quite easy to make.  The white chocolate adds a nice richness.  I'm looking forward to trying this with semi-sweet chocolate or with chocolate-dipped fruit as a topper.  A definite keeper.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I read a review that said put the brulees in the oven at 325F for 35 minutes. I found that it worked really well. I recommend that you make the brulees a day in advance so that they set and also use a torch instead of the broiler.

Used a water bath and it worked great, even with mini ramekins (just reduce the time). The brown sugar just burned, but the white sugar worked best! (and the torch was fun to use!)

My husband LOVES creme brûlée. He begs me to make it all the time, but I usually only make it a couple times a year for special occasions. This is my go-to recipe now. Tonight it the third time I've made it and it's perfect every time.

I used 5 oz. of the white chocolate chips. Torched the sugar on top about an hour after I put it in the refridgerator.  Chilled it for about 3 hours prior to serving.  Easy to make and a big hit.

Flavor is amazing! Suggestion... after whiskinging the first two tablespoons of milk into the eggs, stir the rest in. Mine got frothy and that didn't go away. Made the top layer of the cooked creme brûlée a little strange.

Very easy to make and the addition of white chocolate (may fave) made it that much better.  You really don't even need to add the vanilla with this recipe,  if you're like me and enjoy a more custardy (I just invented that word) flavor.  I torched Turbinado sugar on top.  Yum-myyyyyy!  This dessert dish is probably our favorite.  It's so easy to make, you really have to practice discipline to NOT make it every week!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Delicious! with a few changes, however… I cut the sugar to 3 tbsp and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. Next time I will try with a vanilla bean or perhaps a touch of a liquor such as amaretto

Super good! While I don’t even really like white chocolate (which isn’t even chocolate at all) by itself it’s amazing in this

Kids loved it! Super easy! I doubled the recipe and used a 9"x9" glass pan. Took a long time in the oven at 300 to set but it worked. Tastes better the next day.

I made this as written and OMG! it was so good. I baked them for 45 minutes and they were not as firm as I would had liked. I will add 5 min the next time.

Great recipe.  I haven't found a recipe to rival this for creme brulee.  It is great as written.  I have also experimented and subbed flavored liqueur for the vanilla.  Amaretto and Raspberry were my two favorite.

This recipe was AMAZING! I was making creme brulee for the first time for a french dessert project, and I was worried that it wouldn't turn out right. This recipe came out wonderfully and it was quite simple and quick. I will definitely make again!

This is haven!!! My husband who usually doesn't eat sweet asked me for more. And he said: "The problem it's that these ramekins are too small. Tomorrow we going to buy some other dishes, big ones and please double the recipe and make some more. Will you? I looooove it." Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.
