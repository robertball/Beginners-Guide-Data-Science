I can't stop eating this salsa.  It is super addicting.  This stuff is awesome!!!  Only things that I did differently was that I added 1/2 tsp. garlic salt, 1/2 tsp. sea salt, and I added a tbsp. more lime juice, and I substituted the black olives with a can of black beans b/c my husband hates olives, unfortunately.  I'm surprised more people have not reviewed this outstanding recipe b/c it's THAT GOOD!

I made this on Saturday with a few changes, otherwise everything the same! I didn't put olives, used cherry tomatoes and seeded a whole jalapeno pepper and put it all! Add 1 tsp chopped garlic and pepper and salt!After i put the Lime juice it didn't really need the olive oil so I didn't use it. Let marinade together a few hours! when ready to serve take just what you going to eat and add the avocado that way you don't waste all of it because the avacado turns brown! We thought this was the best ever!

This is truly amazing!  The only thing I added was more avocado and black beans.  It makes a lot, so if you have left-over just remember to keep the seed of the avocado in the salsa so the avocado doesn't turn brown.  A++++++

Best salsa ever!  Hands down.  Made w/fresh roma tomatoes from the garden.  Sooo fresh & delicious.  Doesn't have that yucky, gooey consistency that most jarred salsas have.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Recipe makes a party-sized portion too!

This came together easily and everyone loved it. Some (like my husband) were not sure of the chunky texture, but "the jalopeno junky", said it could have been hotter. Everyone else thought it was just right. My son said, it's surprisingly good!"   The avocados at the store were not ripe, so the avocado ended up being left off. Instead, I used a can of black beans, rinsed. For extra bite, I added an extra tablespoon of lime juice, in addition to an extra teaspoon of ground chipotle pepper. Everything else went in pretty much as the recipe called for. Despite the avocados being left out - this came out well. It didn't need the avocado!  As the salsa sat on the serving table, it developed its own juices - at least a cup in the bottom of its bowl, so we kept stirring it up. It kept getting better and better!   Thanks for sharing!!!

YUM!!! Left out olives but it was great without them. Make sure to give it a generous squeeze of lime juice. That's what gives this the brightness of flavor. 
Served this atop Mexican Style Shredded Pork (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Mexican-Style-Shredded-Pork/Detail.aspx ) from this site. It absolutely made the dish! Thanks!

This was sooo good! I made this and guacamole for an appetizer and EVERYONE loved it!! I added more avacado because I love them and it was excellent. Its better if you eat it within 2 hours because the avacados seem to "melt" and make everything look cloudy

This was great! The few tweaks I made was to add a little bit of garlic salt, cumin, and chili powder to this. I also added black beans (drained and rinsed) along with an extra avocado.

This was Excellent! I took it to a mexican potluck and everyone loved it. The only thing I did different was to add garlic salt and I found a can of sliced olives marinated in jalepeno juice. I will definetely be making this again!

I've made this as stated as well as a fancier version using fresh corn from the cob and chopped kalamata olives instead of the canned. The latter version is more time consuming, but the fresh corn and added flavor from the kalamatas brings it to another level. I only added a 1/4 cup of diced kalamatas - you don't need as much because they have 10x the flavor of canned olives. The recipe as stated is also good and a lot quicker!

For my southern born extended family, I needed something for the crowd that occupies left of the middle road and this did it hands down.  I added black beans (because my wife likes them and they are healthy) and it worked well.  Recipe bookmarked.

Very tasty and colorful!  I don't like olives, so I added a can of black beans. Also I forgot to add olive oil, and then didn't feel like I needed it.

I didn't have olives but made the rest as stated and added fresh cilantro. This is a very good and fresh tasting salsa which gets better after sitting overnight.

This was so good! I have no hesitation in giving it five stars, and it's very easy to make. I made it as a side for a family taco dinner and it stole the show. I made it exactly as written and served it with blue corn chips, but my brother and I agreed that it would be just as good (if not better) served simply as a salad since it's chunky and a little hard to scoop. I was also surprised at how well the leftovers held up on the second, and even third day. I think the lime juice must keep the avocado from browning.

The picture for this recipe may be a little off-putting, but as they say: "You can't judge a book by its cover." This recipe is 5-stars for me!
My family loves this stuff!! I love all the fresh ingredients (except the red pepper which I don't add). I like it salty with the lime juice (especially on my avocados), but all the flavors fuse really well. I add a can of drained black beans in it, which makes it better.  We eat this salsa on fish tacos or by itself with chips.

I do love this recipe we just had it with black bean burritos and the kids gobbled it up.  I would love to try this when fresh corn is in season and I can try  roasted corn instead of canned. Although the canned works very nicely as well.

So delicious!  My daughter's Mexican mother-in-law makes something very similar, and I had such a craving for it that I made this with what I had on hand. Used my favorite canned salsa instead of tomatoes and peppers, didn't add olives or avocado, and added a dash of balsamic vinegar.  I can't stop eating it!

Great recipe.  Like others, I substituted the olives with black beans and added the avocado when it was time to serve it.  Seasoned it with additional spices (cumin, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne).  Let it marinade for a few hours.  Great flavor - very fresh, healthy.  I served it with chips or as a side to our meal.

This is an excellent dip, or just served as a side salad.  This is a recipe that I am requested to bring with me everywhere all summer long...it's always a big hit!  Definitely worth all the prep work.  I do usually either add a whole jalepeno or a can of chopped jalepenos for extra spiciness.

Made this exactly as the recipe states, minus the olives.  I also kept the avacodo separate to keep it fresh.  Served over romaine lettuce makes an incredible salad!  Will make this again and again!

Fantastic recipe; couldn't stop eating it!  The only change I made was I used a can of black beans instead of the olives - everything else was pretty much exactly as called for.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

FABULOUS! A wonderful way to use the tomatoes from our garden. My only recommendation is to add less garlic, but that is really personal preference

I made a few changes as well.  I sauteed 4 ears of fresh corn in olive oil with kosher salt.  Replaced the olives with a can of black beans.  Used 6 small tomatoes, one red and one orange bell pepper, 2 avocados and 2 Tablespoons minced jalapenos.  the juice from 4 limes.  It was a huge hit!

I've made this a couple times now and it is very good. I was asked for the recipe at the potluck and that has never happened to me before. The only things I do differently are to use cherry or grape tomatoes instead of roma, add an extra avocado, and add cilantro. To me, it just isn't salsa without cilantro! **Update 10/15/11** I am no longer permitted to attend any potluck without bringing this dish! No matter how much I make, there is never any left. The secret to making this the best ever, is to combine all the ingredients except the avocado the night before and refrigerate. This allows the flavors to meld into perfection. The avocado will turn mushy if you add them the night before. Also make sure to cover it tightly otherwise the strong onion smell will permeate your entire fridge!

I served this at a party and received quite a few compliments. I left out the olives and olive oil and added in an entire jalapeno as a previous reviewer suggested, and it turned out pretty well. My one suggestion is that, if you actually want chunks of avocado (instead of something resembling guacamole), you should get a less ripe avocado.

Substituted some ingredients for ones that I had in the kitchen already (no olives, white onion instead of red, green bell pepper instead of red) and it was so good! Really refreshing, and a substantial addition to a meal, as opposed to a sauce.

Good and easy!  I used frozen corn which I warmed to room temp, instead of canned corn.  I also used black beans instead of black olives.  It turned out great!

The flavors complement each other beautifully without one ingredient overpowering the others.  Just the right "bite" with the jalapeno added. I can see using this on swordfish as a topping! Delicious!

This is great salsa. Pretty onion-y so if you don't like onion, obviously omit it. I also used black beans in place of olives. Can't get enough black beans! It was great.

I made this to use with tacos but we ate half of it while waiting for the meat to grill! this was very good and different from the standard salsa.  I used green onion because they are milder and i'm not and onion fan.  I will be making this again soon

We love this recipe!  We leave out the olives and add an extra avocado or two.  Let it sit in the fridge for at least 6 hrs to blend the flavors.  It will keep in the fridge for up to 2 days.

I had folks asking for the recipe it was so good!  I didn't have jalapeno pepper so I used a very hot Peruvian pepper (Aji Amarillo) instead.  Next time I would go with deli olives instead of canned...for more pop.

I cannot say enough awesome things about this recipe!  I do play around with it a bit now that I am comfortable (plain chili versus jalapenos).  Every time though, people demand more and more of it!  Awesome job!!

This was a great recipe. Everyone loved it. But I did add half a green pepper, a little cilantro and some sliced green onion. But it would have been great without. Very versatile.  Everybody wants the recipe. Can't wait to make it again.

Wonderful salsa! Though I did make some changes: Fresh boiled corn instead of canned, no olives, scallions instead of red onion, no bell pepper, canned chopped green chilies instead of jalapenos, mixed lime and lemon juice instead of just lime, and cut back on the salt.

LOVE this recipe! I added black beans (1 can rinsed) since I don't like black olives. I make a big batch of it all minus the avocado so I can just have a cup of it as a snack! (I add the avocado when I eat it, so it does not go bad) YUMMY!!!!!!!!! Thank you Julie!

This was a delicious salsa.  The flavors blended so well together.  I would also consider  making it with black beans for the olives for those olive hating friends but it is perfect the way it is.

This salsa is like Lay's chips... you can't just eat one bite!  I added a bit more jalapeno (maybe 1/4 teaspoon) and a dash of cayenne and it was fantastic!  The only thing I didn't add was the red pepper because I'm allergic, but it was still great.  Which reminds me, I need to make more for the 4th!

Fantastic!  For those of you who like super spicy stuff like myself, this salsa is not spicy at all, but still awesome!.  The flavors are enough to make me not miss the spiciness at all.  I followed the recipe exactly without any omits or substitutions, and I think that was the right way to go.  I love this!

Wow. I first ate this at a potluck and demanded the recipe!  Now, I can't stop eating it.  I +/- a lot of the ingredients, more tomatoes, more avocado, less onion, I play around each time I make.  I am adding cilantro this time, give it a bit more mexican taste!  Oh, and I don't add the olives either.

I've been trying to broaden my horizons with food and thought I'd like this recipe because of the ingredients.  Oh dear God is it good!  I used grape tomatoes, scallions, and an orange bell pepper.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  This is so much better than any of the already made jar stuff.  Go Patriots! 17-0

This is delicious and my friends have all asked for the recipe.  It looks fancy and it tastes even better.  I usually add alot of seasoning to it.  But you can't go wrong with this one.

Easy, delicious and eats like a meal.  Guests were asking for the recipe!  I added another tablespoon of olive oil, and a sprinkle of Goya Sazon, served it with multi colored chips as suggested and it was awesome!

I mixed everything except avocado ahead of time to let flavors mingle.  I also added black beans.  When ready to serve I cut up two avocados.  Nice fresh texture and flavor.  I served with scoops.

Love this salsa....I can see why it wins awards!! I made it today and it is in the fridge and we will have it tonight...can't wait! I did take another reviewer's suggestion and I have not put the avocado in the salsa yet, I will wait til about 30 minutes before we eat this. I wonder if this might be nice with some cilantro added.....maybe next time. I had the urge to put in garlic; however, I'm glad I resisted.....this salsa is EXCELLENT as written. Thank you Julie for this lovely recipe!!

Not only is this salsa beautiful, it also tastes amazing! My family requests this for every get together. I did follow the other reviewer's  suggestions and omitted the black olives, and olive oil, and threw in a can of rinsed black beans. I also upped the lime juice. It really does keep the avocado from turning brown.  This is hands down one of my favorite recipes.

I have made this several times for guests, and it always gets rave reviews...I make the recipe as detailed with the exception of adding a clove of crushed garlic.   It is a delish recipe that is always the first to be gobbled up.

I followed recipe with exception of black beans for black olives.  This is a very good dip and I can see how people say its addicting.  After I made it and tried it I added some garlic salt and I think it tasted better before the garlic salt.  Tasted fresher and purer.   Anyway that it personal taste.  As written this is a very good dip and I would serve to company.

Instead of canned corn, I cooked 4 ears of fresh corn in the microwave and cut it from the cobs. I added a large can of black beans, drained and rinsed. I also used 1.5 t garlic powder and 2 t cumin. I doubled the lime juice to 4 T. This is an excellent salsa! I will definitely make it again.

I am not sure if I should be reviewing this, considering that I made so many changes.  I made this for a grilling party to serve with steaks.  I subbed black beans for the black olives, omitted the red bell pepper & jalepeno to suite the main dish I was serving.  Everyone enjoyed it.  My mom loved it.  I thought it was just ok.  Needs another acid component.  I used the juice from 1 lime, an equal portion of olive oil, and salt to taste.  Simple and good, but nothing to write home about.

The salsa is wonderful made as is. The only thing I added was some finely chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, because we like a little extra heat. I will definitely be making this for get-togethers...it's a crowd pleaser! Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted 2 ears of fresh corn (cooked) for the ca which worked well.  Also, a teaspoon of salt sounded like a lot so I used about 3/4 tsp and it was pretty salty and very tasty.

I think this sounds soo good I'm going to try it this weekend. I am thinking of trying to bbq the corn first and add a little cilantro.  I am wondering what else this will go with besides tortilla chips?

Refreshing and tasty! The only modifications I did was sub out the black olives for black beans, and kept the avocado separate for topping so it stays fresher.

Very easy & very tasty. The leftovers over mixed greens made a lovely salad the next day. The tip offered to place the avocado pit in with the leftover salad to prevent browning worked, too.

This is really good. We don’t like olives so made with half a can of black beans. After I made, I thought it needed more so I added some garlic powder.Next time I’ll make with 2-3 avocados.

I love salsa but this one is the best I've ever tasted!  No reason to go back to any other recipe.  I did use frozen corn instead of canned but that's just my personal preference.

I used frozen sweet corn instead of canned corn, and I added 1 1/2 Tbsp of finely chopped cilantro to give it an added zip.  My brother is not a corn fan, but he loved it!!

It’s good. I added black beans. But, it’s hard to get an avocado at the perfect ripeness, not too mushy but soft enough to eat.

When I made this I substituted chopped green onions instead of the red onion and I used the juice of 1 whole lime.  Will definitely be making this again and probably often.

I fixed the salsa following the recipe exactly. I would not prepare it again. There was no salsa flavor by adding only 1-1/2 teaspoons of jalapeno-just a mixed vegetable taste. The photo looks wonderful!  The avocado in the photo must have been less that ripe to stay perfectly shaped after being folded into the rest of the mixture. A ripe avocado breaks up more and loses its identity. Also the mixture should be chilled before serving!

All of my family that dropped by yesterday and turned our evening into a good time, absolutely raved about this salsa.  I favorited this salsa to use at a later date. This was the date so, I made the salsa while everyone was in the pool.  It was a perfect accent to our grilled burgers.  I had all the ingredients in house, yeah!  Some may have been adjusted because I eyeball measurements, but great overall recipe.

Great salsa!  I substituted the lime for grapefruit (I didn't have a lime on hand) and added a few spices (ginger and cilantro).  I served it on a bed of greens.

Don't be fooled! This looks very simple but it is so tasty!! It is summer so I boiled some fresh sweet corn and cut it off the cob to use. I also omitted the olives and added garlic, instead.

This is extremely addicting I made it 2 days ago and I'm in the process of making more! Guilt free snacking!

Yummy!  I put this on fish tacos and it was delicious!  I did omit jalepenos because I don't like spicy.  I also didn't have onions or peppers so I didn't add them, but it was still yummy!

Delicious! I did make a few changes. I added chopped fresh garlic 3 cloves and used black beans instead olives. Used entire jalapeño pepper. Also added 2 extra tablespoons of lime juice. It is so good! Add avocado when ready to eat so avocado doesn't go bad or turn brown and mushy.

I made this tonight with some fresh corn, tomatoes and peppers from the garden.  It was a great combo!  I made it as written.  I think it would also be great with black beans/cilanto/garlic/cumin but was wonderful as-is.

I used frozen Baja roasted corn blend in place of the corn, onion and pepper, garlic salt instead of regular salt and chipotle chili powder.  Very good!!

Excellent flavor! Very fresh tasting and delicious! I substituted black beans instead of olives, but otherwise followed exactly as written. Loved it!!

This is really delicious - even better with fresh corn & cilantro! I usually grill the corn to give it that little hint of smokiness. I use canned if I'm in a rush but if I have time, we find that the fresh-grilled corn and a little cilantro just takes this salsa over the top! Try it!

Wow! This salsa is addictive....I didn't use the olives (can't stand them) but the rest was amazing. I made it for a dinner party last night and it was a HUGE hit

This is such a great recipe as is but also so many small additions can be done to change up flavor or give a different depth for other uses.  My favorite change is omit jalapenos add couple chopped green olives and a little garlic to taste and use as a salsa or relish to top baked salmon or chicken breasts.

This is the best low calorie, delicious recipe. I left out the olive oil, it just didn't need it, and I used a can of whole corn drained and a can of diced tomatoes. I put this together with the cumin, lime juice and I mashed up the avacado and mixed it all up and it was wonderful. I didn't have any cilantro to put in it, it was still great. I could make a meal out of this stuff.

I, per the other reviews, exchanged the black olives for black beans, and waited till the last minute to add the avocado. DELICIOUS!! Everyone loved it, many asked for the recipe.

Love the ingredients and the concept but it doesn't have a ton of flavor.  Next time I'll add garlic and some spices and black beans for some extra nutrition and flavor.

I brought this to a party and everyone loved it! It was also delicious on my chicken salad the next day. Well worth the chopping since you can use leftover on top of chicken or fish. I will definitely make this again!

I liked this salsa very much. It is very easy and quick to make and is healthy plus tasty. The chips I used to eat it with were not healthy though! I think my jalapenos were not hot enough, so I sprinkled some black pepper to add a kick.

This was really good and easy to prepare but I found it a touch too salty and I only used 1/2 tsp salt. I can't wait to make it again but next time I am going to omit all the salt, rinse off the corn and black olives first and hopefully it will be less salty. O and I used regular tomatoes from my garden instead of Roma.

This was a great, fresh alternative to "everyday" salsa ... full of flavor, great with chips, and I've used it since as a topping for fish.  With a little creativity, you can tweak this to make it your own - either more or less spicy ... more corn, etc.   It went over HUGE at the party I took it to.  That's all I need to see with a recipe to make it a "keeper".

Delicious recipe! Cant beat this mad ewith fresh NJ corn and tomatoes.  I think next time I might add some cilantro. Went great with a grilled swordfish recipe from this site too  I'll definitely make this again.
