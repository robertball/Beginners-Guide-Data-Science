This cake was really easy...I substituted 3/4 cup applesauce for the eggs in the cake mix directions (as my daughter's allergic to eggs)--1/4 cup applesauce for each egg.  I also substituted 1/4 cup lemon juice for 1/4 cup of the water that the cake mix directions called for.  When the cake came out of the oven, I made the glaze with 3 parts powdered sugar to 1 part lemon juice (about 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup lemon juice total), as I saw a few other reviewers mention that the recipe made too much glaze, and t least one other mention that the glaze seemed too thin.  The 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and the 1/2 cup lemon juice I used was just about right for my taste in terms of thickness and amount (I omitted the butter).  I also used a fork to poke the holes in the cake, to make it go faster.

I tweeked this recipe a little when I made it based on others' reviews. My husband and I are both loving it!

For the cake, I added the lemon pudding, but instead of making the cake with oil, I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. The low fat directions on most cake mixes will tell you 1/3 cup applesauce, but those little individual servings are 1/2 cup and oh-so-easy to keep on hand and just dump in!

For the glaze, I only made 2/3 the recipe and left the butter out entirely. So I just used 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 cup lemon juice.

This cake does have a definite lemon twang, but why else would you eat lemon cake?! It's super moist and super easy to make.

Best cake I ever tasted. I used mix with pudding already in it but added a box of pudding anyway.  Baked in bundt pan, cut glaze recipe by 1/3.  Voila!  Superb.

The cake was wonderful, the icing had way too much "lu lu" to it!  (My guests puckered and shivered!) I believe the lemon juice amount MUST be a misprint.  Would be better with maybe 1 1/2 TBLSPN of lemon juice, not CUPS.  Still a great cake though and next time I will go with my gut about the lemon juice!

This was very good.  I added poppy seeds to the cake batter.  I wonder about the 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice in the glaze, though.  It seemed like an awful lot of liquid to me.  I used 1 cup of lemon juice and it was pretty tart.  Depends on taste, I guess.

I made this cake for my mom's birthday today as she likes lemony desserts.  Following some of the suggestions, I used 1/3 cup applesauce for the oil and only 2 cups confectioner's sugar and 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice for the icing.  The cake was moist with a very pronounced lemon flavor (just what I was wanting).  It was easy to make and my mom loved it.  The next time I want a lemon dessert, I'll turn to this recipe.

YUM!  Just like the cake my grandma used to make for my friends and I.  When I was a teenager, we spent summer days swimming in grandma's pool, and eating "lemonade cake" as she used to call it.  She kept it in the fridge, and it was SO refreshing on a hot summer day.  I made this in a 9X13 pan.

Excellent and moist! Not as good as Mother Myrick's Lemon LuLu but very good, nonetheless. I halved the glaze recipe and would also recommend mixing the lemon juice to two parts lemon juice and 1 part water. This will keep it snappy but not too tart.

This cake is so good.  Used only 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar and 1/2 cup lemon juice for the glaze.  Came out perfect.

This cake is so eazy and tastes so good!!!   Ive made it several times and it has been a great crowd pleaser!  The only draw back is that the recipie calls for way too much topping.  I  used only half the ammount of powdered suggar and lemmon juice called for and it worked great.

This cake was very quick and easy to make. My kids made it with their babysitter! I love the tanginess. It was just what I wanted. Based on another review, they only made 2/3 of the glaze, which was the perfect amount. We will definately have this again.

I thought I MUST HAVE read the amout of lemon juice when I poured the liquid over the cake.  It overflowed.  It wasn't smooth, maybe a little to much lemon juice.  I will try again though.

I thought this was tasty, but I made  frosting changes as suggested by other reviewers.  I couldn't find a lemon cake mix the day I needed it, so I used yellow cake mix instead and added the lemon pudding mix as the recipe calls for.  I made my mom's lemon drizzle (just lemon juice and powdered sugar) as frosting.  Poking holes with a fork (as someone else suggested) made ugly holes in my cupcakes, so I would recommend using the cake tester or toothpick to make the holes. I would definitely make this again.

Wow - was this lemony! Very good and very moist; actually, so moist that it really didn't need the glaze. I will definitely make it again, though next time maybe with a cream cheese frosting with a tiny bit of lemon zest. Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe.  The icing makes quite a bit more than I use, so I divided the sugar and lemon juice to make about a half cup or is is too soggy.  Don't get me wrong, it was great that way too:)

The lemon glaze on top was just horrible!! I only used 1/2 of the glaze and that was tooooo much. Yes it was easy and quick to make but I will never make this again, if you try this one hopefully you'll have better luck.

I've been experimenting with different cake recipes. The main problem has been adding and maintaining moisture. This recipe worked for me with the small adjustment of 1/2 c.  of lemon juice instead of 1 1/5c. in the glaze. 
I can't believe the amazing results. Perfect!

Excellent!
Based on another review, I decreased the amount of lemon juice (1/2 cup) and powdered sugar (1 1/2 cups).
Overall an excellent cake. Definitely a keeper.

This cake turned out very good even though I did not have any pudding to add. The recipe  made way too much glaze. We all liked the tartness.

Easy & tasty!  I followed the suggestion of 1 1/2 cup confectioners sugar & 1/2 c lemon juice.  I will probably double it for more volume of liquid.  So basically I will use the recipe as is except cut the lemon juice to 1 cup.

The best lemon cake ever.  It was a family favorite and I will be making it for the next holiday and family gatherings going forward.  Regarding the cake mix, I used Duncan Hines lemon cake mix and it turned out delicious.  This recipe encouraged me, a first time baker, to become one.

The only change I made to this recipe is that I used only 1/2 cup of lemon juice.  Very tasty and just enough lemon taste for us.

I made it for Thanksgiving,  we had pumpkin pie, fudge and cherry cheese cake.  Everyone had my lu lu lemon cake and came back for a second piece.  They said it was so moist and refreshing after a big meal.  A five star for sure.

SO Yummy! I didn't have enough lemon juice (whoops!) so I only added one cup (not 1.5 cups) and actually it was the perfect amount for the icing because if I had added more it probably would have been too lemon-y for my liking! Our guests loved the cake! It's SUPER moist and delicious!

It tastes really lemony.  Please note that  the 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice must be a misprint.  I used about 1/2 to 3/4 cup.

I made this as per the directions with a few minor changes. I used a Lemon cake mix with pudding in the mix , but I also added the pudding as the directions call for. In the glaze, I reduced the amount of sugar slightly and added about 2 Tablespoons of Limoncella (Lemon Liquor).  I refridgerated the cake after glazing and served it cold. It was supper moist and lemony without being too tart or sweet. My Bunco group raved about it!!

Terrible plate of wet mush.  I'm an inexperienced baker and thus I assume you're supposed to mix the pudding mix, not the pudding as it said in the recipe?  Either way, the glaze as instructed was a soupy mess as well.  Will try another recipe, with clear instructions so I don't waste my time or money.

So delicious! Wow, yum! I only used the juice of  one and a half lemons, it was maybe 3/4 cup. And with this amount it was really moist.  I will definitely be making this again.

Not the greatest lemon dessert.   It's sweet and tart but but the cake texture isn't to die fo.  I love lemon desserts but I wouldn't make this again.

My family loved it!  Per the recommendations changed the lemon juice to 1/2 cup.  A couple of members wanted it reduced even more as when you get to the bottom of the cake there tends to be a pooling of the glaze.  Overall great and easy!

This cake was good after significantly modifying it per other's reviews.  The main modification being to reduce the glaze to 1-1/2 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 c. lemon juice and 1 T butter.  With these modifications, the cake was very good.  Thanks for sharing, 2WANNA!

Great Recipe! Made this tonight and my family loved it.  The cake is very moist.  The only change I made was to use two cups of confectioners sugar and 1/2 cup lemon juice for the glaze topping, I also omitted the melted butter.  What the recipe called for just seemed like too much and I did not want a soggy cake.  After pouring the glaze on the cake I put it in the fridge to chill for a few hours. It turned out perfect with the adjustment and not too sweet. Thanks for the great recipe!

You must love tart lemon flavor to appreciate this cake!  Unfortunately, most of my guests didn't enjoy it.  I prefer it tart and it was almost too tart for me.  I won't make it again, since I can't eat a whole cake.

I took this cake to work and now everyone wants me to make it for our food days.  Also sent it to a bake sale and it got raves.  It is so easy to make and is now one of my very favorite recipes.  A real winner!

The cake was delicious, my friends kept asking for seconds!  My only complaint is that the icing is INCREDIBLY thin and makes waaay too much.  After following the recipe, I had to almost TRIPLE the powdered sugar to get it to a normal "glaze" thickness!  Definitely won't use this icing again, but the cake was good.
