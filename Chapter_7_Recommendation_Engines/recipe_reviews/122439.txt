These are fantastic!!!

My only problem was that they stick to the pan, even with Pam! I finally (after the fourth batch and advice from my mother) used parchment paper and sprayed the parchment paper - that solved the problem.

Again, these are fantastic!!

This recipe is DELICIOUS!!  I am making these for family and friends this year.  I am using only pecans in my recipe.

Stirring is important throughout baking, especially if you accidentally overbeat the egg whites (like I did, lol).  Otherwise you will end up with a meringue-y, frothy mess (and burned nuts, too).

I think next time I will add a tablespoon or two of butter for a richer flavor...not that this recipe needs any, just personal preference.

Also, I did not have nutmeg on hand and used mace instead (just about the same thing).

Remove from the pan promptly or they will begin to harden and be difficult to remove.

Definately deserves 5 stars!!!

These are the best Holiday nuts i've ever had! Instead of using seperate measurements of nuts, i used a large can of mixed salted nuts and omitted the extra salt.

Loved the recipe as is, and the 5 stars are well deserved!  After following the recipe a couple times, I altered it to use honey instead of white sugar.  I used 1 1/3 c. honey, only one egg white and 1 T. water.  Everything else as written.  They are pretty good, but chewier and they stick together more while baking.  When cool, you can break them up before bagging them.  Be sure to put foil or parchment paper down to reduce the mess.  The added health benefits are worth the change to me.

These are simply outstanding!  They are just like the kind you get in the paper cones at fairs, at a fraction of the cost.  I used only walnuts and almonds, and plan on using some in a spinach, dried cranberry, apple, blue cheese and balsamic vinegarette salad -- it will make the salad delightful!  Be careful, they are addictive!

Made this for Christmas and gave as gifts.  I forgot to add the orange peel, had to use ginger from a jar, and added a few healthy shakes of cayenne pepper.  They were SO delicious--got raves from our gift recipients.  Will definately make again this coming Christmas.

What a great recipe. You can alter the seasonings for your taste, but the best part is how well they keep! I made triple batches and bagged them up to send to my husband's unit in Iraq this Christmas. They tasted as good 2 weeks later as they did the day they were made, and they were definately appreciated! Thanks for such a great recipe

I wasn't sure how these would turn out, but they could not have been simpler and the final result was delicious, just like those nuts you get at the state fair.  After 2 stirs at 10 minute intervals (20 minutes total), I stirred again at 8 more minutes, then left them in another 2-4 to kind of "dry out" completely.  The temperature is perfect.  A nice slow cooking process.

My family went "nuts" for these.  I had a couple of really big men literally begging me for more.  It was much easier than I'd thought it would be.  My only thing is I wish I had NOT put in the orange.  I was the baker, so I knew it was in there and it was the only thing I could taste.  Others loved the nuts and wondered what that one flavor is and then after I told them orange, they really tasted it.  Next time WITHOUT orange zest.

Wonderful!  Made them just as written and everyone loved them.  The orange is a nice addition.  I just dumped mine on waxed paper to cool and had no problems with sticking or clean up.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I lost my nut recipe that was similar to this but this one is better!  I didn't have an orange at the time so I used grated clementine zest.  It was wonderful.  I was going to leave out the ground cloves but my husband snuck it in.  Good husband!  They were so flavorful but still sweet and impossible to resist.  I put in holiday candy kisses and give them as gifts at work.

Delicious. I used just almonds (they were majorly on sale) for my trial run before Christmas this year. I used parchment paper and they did not stick too much; after taking them out of the oven, I transferred them to a clean parchment paper-lined tray to finish cooling. I didn't have all the spices called for, so I added a little ground black pepper and even a pinch of chili powder. Son loved them and declared them "easy to eat". He wants more sweetness next time, more like a candied nut. I will try another batch with more cinammon and sugar. Thanks! 
.
.
UPDATE: The next morning, the leftover nuts were sticky and gooey. I don't know if I did something wrong, but they had lost their dry crunchiness. Family didn't want them. Just wanted everyone to know, as this can be an expensive recipe; I don't think I'll make them for Christmas gifts.

This is the best recipe for spiced nuts! I added 1/4-1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and it was perfect. Forgot the orange peel and don't miss it, I may add that in when I make it next time for comparison. My husband loves these. I baked the nuts about 25-30 minutes and the nuts in the middle of the sheet pan were more gooey (I did stir them at 10 minute intervals). I think I would turn the oven off and let them sit in the oven for about 5 minutes. I used non-stick Reynolds foil and it worked great. Easy to get off even after the nuts had cooled.

These are amazing! All I had on hand was almonds and walnuts, but I didn't change anything else. I only made 10 servings worth, but it was enough for a last minute gift jar plus we are scarfing the rest. Thanks!

Cut the recipe down to one cup; used only pecans. Skipped the orange peel as I didn't have any oranges around and the salt just because. Will include the salt next time. Guesstimated the spices. Have to watch these carefully. Would be great with pumpkin seeds too.

They came out great. I used egg whites from a carton -- they work just fine for this, froth up nicely. I did have to add extra nuts -- but then again the carton suggets 3 TBs per egg white, so I wound up with 9 TBs egg white and 2 TBs water, which all in all is probably not the same amount of liquid as the whites of 3 eggs but 2 TBs water (no matter what the carton says). Thanks for the delicious recipe :=)

I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed with this recipe. After all of the rave reviews, my expectations were pretty high. I followed the recipe exactly, but used a mix of unsalted nuts. For me, there is far too much coating on these nuts, so too much of the sugar mixture, I think. Maybe the spice mixture needs more salt or something savory to go in the mixture? I don't know. This just wasn't for me. Also, I had to cook them a lot longer than the instructions said. For those who said they stuck to the pan, I lined my baking trays with baking paper and had no issues with sticking, plus easy clean up.

I've never made anything like this and got a bit nervous at the gooey mess in my pan. I was afraid it wasn't going to harden up, but it does. The spices are strong and I also thought they were going to be too much, the smell of allspice almost knocks you out every time you open the oven to stir. I do think if I make again I'd cut back on the allspice and cloves. This makes a pretty thick coating, maybe next time only two egg whites and less sugar. I have to see how the go over when I give them to everyone.

Delicious! I just made these for a party I'm going to today. Next time I will use less egg white - maybe just two and one Tbs of water.  But they came out great and the house smells wonderful.

Made this for Christmas gifts, was excellent, but I think I would use a little less sugar next time, it made a really thick coating on the nuts.

I made these for a couple of holiday parties and they were a huge hit! I used dried grated orange peel that you find in the spice aisle because that's what I had and I thought it tasted good. They tasted just as good the next day as well. Update: stored in a ziplock bag, they were still delicious a week (or more) later.

I thought my other sweet spiced nut recipe was good but this is superb!! I think the orange peel really adds wonderful flavor- I added an extra tsp to my second batch...mmmmm! I didn't have any problem with nuts sticking to the pan or burning. I used parchment paper and sprayed that with cooking spray. I stirred the nuts after 10 minutes of baking and once again before they were out of the oven- about 25 minutes of baking time. I stirred them again while they were cooling to break them up. Delicious!!

Perfect blend of sweet/salt.  Made and gave as teacher gifts--they all loved it.  I packaged the nuts in clear disposable icing bags tied with a ribbon and a cute tag.  I used the mixed nuts in the giant jar from CostCo--no peanuts, thank you.

Everyone loved them, kept asking me what I put in them and that I should go into business selling them.  I used orange juice instead of water, mace instead of nutmeg and added a little cayenne.  I baked them longer at a lower temp.  At first they looked too wet, but finally  baked up nice and crispy.

Yum! 
I may have overcooked mine just a hair, I say this only because they were kinda stuck to the pan when they cooled. (total baking time was 25 min. stirring after every 10 min.)Next time, I will line my baking sheets then spray oil on them. Taste is very good. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Dangerously good. I am going to make these for Christmas gifts this year so I did a mini test batch today and WOW. I don't really like nuts myself but I could eat these all day. I followed the recipe very closely, the only changes I made were A) I am just using walnuts and pecans and B) I used a dry grated orange peel from the spice aisle instead of fresh grated, and only used half the called for amount. I think these will make the perfect homemade Christmas gift.

Edit: I make these every year  now, ever since the first time I made them 6 years ago. My family has let it be known that they expect to get them! I buy the large bags of nuts at Costco, sometimes I leave the almonds out, sometimes I use them. They are great either way. I even make a smaller batch for my brother who is vegan by using flax eggs (look it up, really easy to do, just ground flax seed and water) or an egg replacer. Oh, and I always follow the first reviewer's advice and use parchment paper sprayed with cooking spray, which makes for an easy clean up.

These made wonderful Christmas presents! Make sure to mix these OFTEN while they are baking, so that they do not stick to the pan (I covered the pan with aluminum foil, so clean-up was easy).  I made a few changes: I added 1 cup of peanuts (they taste good and add some bulk to the recipe if you are cooking for gifts), and I only used 1 1/2 cups white sugar, then added about 1/4 cup honey.  I also added a little extra grated orange peel, because I like the aftertaste.  They tasted a little chewy the day I made them, but they tasted nice and crunchy the next day when I served them and kept well throughout the holiday season.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've used a similar recipe that I cut out of a magazine years ago.  Since I couldn't find it, I used this recipe and it's so yummy and easy!  I mix up the spices and put them in cute little containers w/ pretty ribbons as inexpensive Christmas gifts.  I also include a tag w/ the recipe for these nuts and other things you can add the spice to like cream cheese or oatmeal, etc.  It make a great gift for all those teachers (which can get expensive).

Just pulled them out of the oven about 30 mins ago. They smell great and taste even better. I made them because I had a bunch of nuts that needed to be used up...raw cashews, raw almonds and a handful of pecans. Didn't have any allspice...just threw in a pinch more cinnamon, cloves, and some ground pepper. I think that I will make a huge batch for Christmas gifts this next year. Thanks!!!

I LOVED these. My husband loved them too but he would have preferred to have them w/o the orange zest. I liked that extra flavor. I may make them again for my husband w/o the orange and add a little  more cinnamon - he has a sweet tooth.

These nuts are exactly what I was looking for!  They are so good that I have bagged some of them up to give to our neighbors for Christmas.  They are similar to the ones in the mall only they have that extra special 'homemade' touch to them.  I followed the recipe exactly and they are awesome!

I thought this recipe was far superior in taste compared to other similar recipes. I only used walnuts and almonds (my preference) and since I didn't have orange zest I used a tablespoon of orange juice. I epecially liked the ginger. Since I eat nuts as a healthy addition to my diet, I will definately make again.

Great!  Very addictive, there goes the diet!  I did add 2 cups more nuts than called for, ommited the orange and added cayene pepper.  I used pecans, almonds, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, cashews.  I made them as a bridal shower gift, were a hit and almost gone before the party ended.  I gave the bride the recipe so she was still happy!

Very tasty! The walnuts have the best flavor; definitely don't skimp on them. I made a batch for Thanksgiving, leaving out the orange peel, and they were gone within the first two hours of the family gathering! If you're not a fan of the more bitter/savory spices, you might want to leave out the cloves and/or cut down on the nutmeg, but either way, the flavor is amazing. You can't go wrong with these.

I used Planter's Salted Mixed Nuts & omitted the salt & orange peel in the recipe.  I used half brown & half white sugar & for the water I used half water & half vanilla extract.  I decreased the cloves by half after reading that some thought the nuts were overly spiced.  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper --next time I'll add more!  I thought these were very tasty but hubby didn't care for them.  I'll stick to the recipe next time & see if it comes out any better & report back.

This was a good recipe, and it turned out great. Just a personal preference, but the nuts had a little too much "spice" on them and not enough sweet. Next time I will decrease the amount of spices used.

I read a few reviews that complained of "sticky nuts the next day" and I will say that I did not have that problem at all.  These were absolutely wonderful!  I used them on a salad with fresh mushrooms, blue cheese, dried cranberries, baby greens and a basalmic vinagrette reduction for the dressing and it was a perfect Holiday treat!  Thank you for the recipe :)

We didn't care for these.  I read the reviews and thought they would taste like the ones at the mall, they didn't.  Too much spice, too much extra goo.  Will mabye try a different recipe and find what I'm looking for.

These are very addictive!  I used mixed nuts and omitted salt as did other users and the recipe turned out very tasty!  I was a little worried as I had to leave the nuts in the oven quite a bit longer to fully cook (35 minutes - stirring every 10 or so) and they became quite soft but they regained their crunch once they cooled.  They are being packed up as a Christmas treat for our neighbours.

Tasted great but some of the sugar coating got a bit too hard and it made some of the nuts unedible.  Otherwise it was a great recipe!

This is an awesome recipe.  It's easy to prepare, is a hit at parties and makes a great gift.  I scoop it into a long plastic bag and then place the bag in a square of wrapping paper rolled into a cone shape - I add a paper doily for a bit more elegent effect.

Very, very good!  I loved that there was no added butter for this recipe.  It was quite easy, and I ended up just using premium mixed nuts.  I also added a few dashes of cayenne pepper for a small kick.  Twenty-two minutes in the oven were all I needed, and the nuts dried quickly in great little clumps.  They look simply elegant in a clear glass jar with ribbon at the top.  Thank you--these made a lovely gift for coworkers and friends.

Just like the kind you get at the fair!  I added more of all the seasonings to give it a richer flavor.  I brought them to work and they were gone before the end of the day.

I made these for my mom and she loved them.  I left out the cloves (personal taste) and will reduce the allspice next time I make them.  Easy to make and a big hit!

These turned out really nice. I didn't add the ground cloves because I'm not a fan and I think I'll cut back a bit on the ginger next time as well. They were still very tasty though.
