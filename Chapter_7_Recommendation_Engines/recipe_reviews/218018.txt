I used this recipe with wild blackberries and doubled the quantity and then I also put in an egg with a little milk to make the cake mix creamy and I then took spoonfuls and put over the blackberries. Results were awsome!

Anytime you have less than four ingredients, it's at least worth trying. I did this the traditional 'dump cake' way and didn't bother mixing up the butter with the cake mix. I just sprinkled the box of mix on top of the berries and then poured the melted butter on top. Turned out perfect. I did cook it a bit longer than recommended to get more juice from the berries.

Delicious and very easy!  I used fresh frozen berries I had picked last summer.  Actually used 4 cups and it was great.

Loved this!  I  used a lemon cake mix because that's what I had here but the lemon added to it, I think.  Super easy and very tasty!  Will definitely make again and again!

This was so easy!  I only made a couple changes.  I used 1 1/2 (16 oz) bags of mixed berries and added 1/2 tsp almond extract to the cake/butter mixture.

Came out delicious!  Will make it again for sure.

Delicious and VERY easy.  I saw other recipes that called for a lot of sugar, but that wasn't necessary with the cake mix.  My husband brought some blackberries home from the farmer's market, so I whipped this up and served it hot with vanilla ice cream.  Wow!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I make a peach cobler exactly like this. Using blackberries was very delicious. I did the same dump method as mentioned by another viewer except I added 3/4 of a bottle of cream soda on top of the berries.  Everyone loved it!

I used real butter with a reduced sugar cake mix. Had to bake approx. 45 minutes. Was excellent! Also used around 6 cups of blackberries. Had a thick layer of blackberries in a 9x13 pan. Wouldn't use less!

I love this recipe & in fact, I thought my Grandmother was the only one who made this simple, yummy cobbler. I actually thought she made it up cause it seems to good to be true! It is like the dump cake style we use in the dutch ovens when we go on a pack trip. If your in doubt, just try it! The only thing my family does different is add  2 tablespoons of instant tapioca to the berries to thicken them up a bit.

Delicious and the easiest dessert I ever made.   Served it with vanilla ice cream.   I used raspberries from the garden but will try blueberries next.   Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is an awesome recipe! I used a mixture of wild blackberries and wild blue huckleberries that I had on hand. I did do what another reviewer suggested and added one egg and a bit of milk. It turned out great. Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I made it exactly as written. My family says its the best cobbler they've ever tasted. This recipe is a keeper. I plan on using this method with other types of fruit. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

My first attempt at blackberry cobbler and it was super easy and very delicious.  Use a similar recipe from this site for a peach cobbler but I like this topping better and will change all cobbler toppings to this when I want a quick and easy throw together dessert.

I used blackberries and blueberries. Poured dry lemon cake mix over and then poured melted butter. We all liked it but next time I will mix the cake mix with a little milk or sour cream before putting it on berries.

It's a no go by itself, too sweet...even with black coffee.  Every bite I took, something was missing.  For instance, either a cream cheese mixture and a graham cracker crust or a moist, white cake with veins of sugar/cinnamon.  I made the recipe as is without tweaking it.

1/26/20 - I added in about a half cup of milk and one egg, per other reviewers.  This was good fresh, but got really soggy the next day, and none of my fruit is showing up through the cake batter, so it just looks like cake until you cut it.  It was okay but not my favorite version of this recipe.

This is the way my mother always made cobblers particularly blueberry.  She used to melt the butter and pour over the cake mix but i find that working cold butter into the cake mix prior to it on top of the berries works much better and is more evenly distributed.  I also have ls learned to mix the berries with a little cinnamon and sugar before placing in pan.  My family loves this summer dessert.  I have used may different fruits and it always comes out great.

I used a full cup of milk, all-purpose flour, and a tad more butter.  IMPORTANT: If you use regular all-purpose flour instead of self-rising flour, then add a tablespoon of baking powder to the recipe! Otherwise, you'll end up with a hard brick.  I always use regular all-purpose flour and make my self-rising flour this way whenever needed.

Not spectacular, but certainly very tasty and considering that it was truly very easy to make it certainly goes into rotation as a simple summer dessert. Thanks for sharing.

Used the dump cake method mentioned by other reviewers, used 2 cups blackberries and 1 cup blueberries and used a 8x10 pan and baked for 45 mins. While this didn't taste like a classic cobbler or buckle to me (which I think of as more biscuit-y), it was DELICIOUS! It tasted like a soft shortbread cookies over baked fruit. My husband and I kept eating it right out of the pan! I definitely recommend this if you're looking for a sweet dessert.

I had frozen raspberries from last year and some fresh blue berries from the fridge.....I did a cup of sugar to the berries.....and used a total amount of 4 cups.....and made it like a dump cake....melting the butter over the cake mix........350....for about an hour......it turned out great and will make again.....using all kinds of fruit........apples next.......also added 1 tesp. of cinnamon....worked out well.

I followed the recipe precisely, and was NOT impressed. Results didn't look like the picture either. The topping didn't brown very well, even with a little extra time in the oven. I thought what it needed was some liquid and probably an egg or two. Then I read the top review and saw that they'd done exactly that, and most of the other positive reviews also made significant changes. How can you give 5 stars to a recipe that you did not make?

I love the limited ingredients. With a new baby in the house I can't just run to the store anymore. On our walks around the neighborhood we found enough berries for this, although 3cups barely covered the bottom of the 9x13. I let my almost 10yr daughter make this while I did a load of dishes supervising. It was her very first time cooking, her first time wanting to do it. She enjoyed making this. We will be adding more berries & tossing the berries with the mixture, my daughter wants to see how that tastes.

I'm not sure if it makes a difference, but I made this exactly as the recipe calls for except I used a gluten free yellow cake mix. Maybe the gf version of a cake mix cooks differently?? The berries were good and cooked well but the crumble on top was gritty. Between the berry seeds and the crunchy topping, it was hard to eat. My kids didn't seem to mind too much but it's not something I'll make again this way.

Quick and easy.  Grammy knew what she was doing here.  EXCEPT: 1/2 cup seemed too much to sprinkle on the top.  So I did 1/4.  Perfect.  I did not check my pans before I started, and didn't have the size needed.  I made another half recipe for the cake.  Mashed the berries lightly and did 2.5 cups  of berries for my 9.5" pan.  It was eaten quickly. YUM YUM   Thanks Jellybean
