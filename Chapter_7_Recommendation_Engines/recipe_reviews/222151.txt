Sweet and tangy sauce that is super easy to make. We used the sauce for a stir fry of sorts, pouring it over broccoli and pan seared scallops. Very tasty.

I made quite a few changes, mostly by mistake.  I mixed all of the ingredients, including the salt (half) and pepper, and marinated the scallops in the mixture.  I eliminated the shrimp but added chunks of fresh pineapple.  Grilled the skewers, fabulous!  I didn't have enough ketchup so I added Stonewall Kitchen's Country Ketchup, which has a nice kick.  My wife said "excellent", which is not a word she uses often!  Another keeper recipe, thanks for sharing it.

Easy sauce to make; Light; Sweet and Tangy; My Husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. Using it in chicken sounds good also.

This sauce is delicious! It is sweet yet has a tangy taste to it. The first time I made it, I made it with shrimp like it is originally made for. Then tonight I made the same exact sauce with chicken drummettes instead. I had to double everything so that I had enough sauce bt it was delicious, and very quick to! The family loved it!

I was surprised how bland this was. I thought about substituting the ketchup for shrimp cocktail sauce. I think BBQ sauce would be better than this. Will not be making this one again.

This was really good and super easy to make.  I was able to make it with what I had on hand without any special ingredients.  I used Mrs Butterworths instead of pure maple syrup.  I will def be making this again and I'll be trying it on chicken as others have suggested
