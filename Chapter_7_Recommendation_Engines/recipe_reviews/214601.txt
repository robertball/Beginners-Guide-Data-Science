There's just something missing for me so I added parmesan cheese and crushed oregano and then found it not bad to dip bread into.

This is very good dipping sauce, add more crushed pepper for a kick if you like it hot.

I also added oregano, basil and thyme in place of the rosemary. It was delicious with the right mix of oil and vinegar. Husband loves this as well so thatâ€™s a big plus

This didn't turn out as I hoped. The Balsamic Vinegar and garlic were too overpowering. I would definitely dial back on both of those ingredients if I were to make this again.

This bread dipping oil got rave reviews from party guests and I couldn't agree more. I didn't have fresh rosemary but the dried rosemary tasted very good in it. This was fast, easy, and delicious. I tried it with italian bread and with sourdough and both tasted perfect.

I thought this was great! I am not normally a big fan of rosemary but I loved this. Yum!
