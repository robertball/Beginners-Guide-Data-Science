My husband and I loved it. I just changed 2 things. I changed the sausage to be spicy pork sausage and I did not add bacon because I forgot to buy it. It came out great. I also just used 5 portobollo mushroom because they were big. 1 of them filled each of us so they are very filling.

Very flavorful.  Next time I will either buy less mushrooms, or make more stuffing as the recipe doesnt make enough for 12 mushrooms.  I also had to cook them longer than 10 minutes.

This was a scumptious appetizer!  Also, the mushroom is very filling and can be used as a lunch served with a side salad.  I would opt for using the balsamic vinegar...it adds to the overall taste!  My guests just loved it!

I agree with the 2nd comment that it doesn't "look" pretty, but it is tasty and very filling.  Half a portobello is enough for one adult. Will make again...

Like the reviews recommended, I cooked these for for 12 minutes and they came out perfectly.  I only made four mushrooms worth, and used extra filling for omelets the next morning.

Good stuff!  made a few changes that really improved it! 
We started with uncooked pork sausage (a package of hot and regular....we like alot of meat)  Browned the meat with the onions (used both green and white) while cleaning and preparing the mushrooms.  Used 4 large caps,  1/2 cup of ricotta and a cup of shredded cheese blend.  Filled them up and topped them off with a lil sprinkle of cheese and the balsamic.  Cooked about 20 minutes for the mushroom to cook.  SO GOOD!!!  the balsamic adds such a great flavor!!  We used this as a mean instead of a side, which is why we chose the large caps and alot of meat.  Forgot the tomatoes so just left them out.  
Highly recommend this recipe!  Especially with my own personal touches = )

This recipe was wonderful!  My dinner guests and I really enjoyed it!  I made a few changes based on what I had at home: I cooked 4 slices of bacon, diced and set aside.  I sauteed diced white onion in a little of the leftover bacon grease along with some fresh minced garlic. I subbed ground chicken breasts for the sausage, and added that to the onion/garlic mixture.  When it had cooled a bit, I added the chicken/garlic/onion and the diced bacon to the cheeses, green onion, and tomatoes and used it to stuff 5 large portobello caps. I drizzled with the balsamic, sprinkled with cheese and baked as directed.  It was AMAZING! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was so good and easy! We raise our own pigs so I used our sausage and drained the sausage really well.  Oops, just noticed I forgot the vinegar. But my entire family of picky eaters give this recipe 2 thumbs up!  BTW - the recipe is awesome but the calories are way understated.  Each serving is about 420.  You may be able to reduce that by using lower fat cheese and turkey sausage.

This is delicious and filling.  I could only eat a half of a portabella mushroom.  I saut√©ed sweet sausage until browned and added it to the other ingredients.  Easy and delicious.
 Unfortunately I forgot the balsamic vinegar.  Ah well, it was still excellent.

Ran into a few problems with these. First you have to wash the caps but no matter how well I dried them and how long I let them sit they just wouldn't get completely dry. I then filled them accordingly and baked 12 minutes per reviews. The caps were done but the mixture of olive oil, grease from the sausage and water ran all over the place. Lastly to help I had to broil them for a minute or two but alas nothing helped.

The recipe is great, but a bit salty. The vinegar added just enough zing for the finish. Even my husband who is not a big mushroom fan enjoyed them...which makes it a huge hit in my book. I think next time, I might use more ricotta cheese, less of the mixed cheeses and sausage to try and decrease the saltiness. This is definitely worth trying with creminis to make an appetizer.

fantastic. used italian turkey sausage and sauteed before adding to other ingredients. for an appetizer I suggest buying baby portobellos and stuffing individually. much easier to serve and eat.

Very good.   Just a quick comment to the lady that washed her mushrooms then could not get them dry.  You never wash mushrooms with water.  A dry veggie brush is all you need and you will never have a problem again.

Excellent, but used mild Italian Sausage and 6 large Portobello Mushrooms.  Removed the fins, then stuffed them.  Served as a main course with a salad, broiled asparagus and wild rice.  What a meal.

I made this for my hubby and teens (14 & 16), using chicken sausage from my local market. I'd found a pkg of 4 portabella caps at costco for a great price, and this recipe was perfect for us. I chopped the stems and sauteed them in EVOO and a splash of balsamic vinegar. I baked the mushrooms at the end of the baking time of Chicken Dermie a la Hermie (from AR) and we enjoyed the meal. Although half a mushroom would have been enough for me, I couldn't stop eating it, so I had the whole thing. Yum!

We omitted the sausage and made it a vegetarian dish. We also used fresh cherry tomatoes sliced in half and then served this on a toasted deli baked onion roll.

We used kielbasa sausage instead of Jimmy Deans. substitute cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Added 1 1/2 t of white pepper (sneaky heat). And for added flavor use Wisconsin goat cheese instead of Italian blend. No need to gill the mushrooms, cook them at 375 degrees on a grate on the cookie sheet to keep them out of the juice they will release when they get hot.

Super yummy! The filling is awesome! I used regular chopped tomatoes instead of sun dried, & left out the balsamic. Will make again! And filling can be used for small stuffed mushrooms too.

I made this last night, but substituted the meat with hot Italian sausage. I also sprinkled feta cheese into the Italian cheese mixture and also fresh parsley. I also put about a teaspoon of veggie spaghetti sauce on top of each mushroom, pouring it over the cheese. These were restaurant-worthy! Absolutely wonderful!!

Awesome recipe! I am going to experiment with lean ground turkey as well and play with spices. I added chopped celery and red peppers and cooked all but the cheeses and green onion prior to stuffing the portobello's. Easily something you can alter and play with and my bet is it will amazing every single time!! Thank You so much for this now fav in my menu!

This was very good. I have never made Portobellos before but my husband has to make some dietary changes so we are trying new things. I had to make a few substitutions due to what I had on hand but it still was very yummy. My husband even said I could make it again. And I will be. Thank you for the easy tasty recipe.

followed the directions 100%. While the stuffing tasted amazing, the mushrooms just came out way too soggy with the fat from the sausages =/. Still tasted good, but looked like a mess

This recipe is fabulous! We love onions, so I put in much more green and red onion, cooked until 140-150¬∞, and even my kids thought it was great! Will try some variation as we will definitely be eating this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe; however, I made several changes in an attempt to make it a bit healthier. I used 1 lb of fresh sausage (not precooked), once brown, I added about 2 handfuls of baby spinach (kale is another option), 1/4 tsp garlic powder and cooked until the spinach was wilted. I decreased the cheese to 1 cup and omitted ricotta. I ended up baking it for about 15-20 minutes but I also used large Portabellas which the recipe filled four nicely.
