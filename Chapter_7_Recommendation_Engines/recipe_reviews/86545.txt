LOL...I always use this recipe....hotdog bread or hamburger bread as they call it... when my grandchildren come over. They love taking turns toasting their own garlic bread in the toaster oven....and adding their own special
ingredients....we fix garlic seasoning in butter with onion flakes, parsley flakes, garlic flakes, and organio. Spreading with different cheeses each one has their own little bowl. And to cut down on clean up we use clean bathroom drinking cups or styrofoam coffee cups. They LOVE it. Its a SPECIAL treat at MAW MAW's HOUSE. Grandmothers take time to make memories with your grandchildren...It may not be top notch but who care with grandchildren around....they come first.

LOL, I thought I was the only one who did this. I've used hamburger buns as well. I use garlic bread sprinkle instead of garlic powder and also sprinkle a little italian seasoning or oregano on top and parmesan cheese. The parmesan takes on a wonderful flavor when it gets toasted. Not quite the same as french bread, sourdough, or italian bread but much much better than garlic toast made with sandwich bread.

I do agree, it's good for an extreme emergency.  But, contrary to your comment: YES, I really did note the difference!

My hubby and I have been doing this for years. He loves hotdogs and so I seem to always have left over buns that are ready to go stale. I've even put them into the regular toaster, spread margarine, sprinkled garlic powder and italian seasoning and just eat it alone. (Snack time!)You get the five stars cuz your right, this is totally "emergency" garlic bread. Thanks for sharing!!

I love that the domestic arts are still alive and well! My mom taught me this trick to use left over hot dog buns. I use it to this day. Sometimes I'll sprinkle them with left over shredded cheeses too.

I gave this a 5 star because it is exactly what it is..."emergency garlic bread" that tastes great!  I actually have done this before and the recipe here was a delightful reminder.  You can put all your favorite toppings and with good results.

I noticed the difference too, although not drastically enough to cut down the score so badly.  Still pretty decent stuff, and definitely easy.  I tend to like cooking things like this until barely "golden" but this seemed to work better cooking a bit beyond that, though burns easily.  I also tried throwing them in the toaster oven on "toast" for just a short time before broiling, which gave a bit more crispiness to the bottom sides, which helped since hot dogs buns are so much softer than French bread.  I don't think I'd want to try to fool guests with these.

I made this out of some leftover hot dog rolls. Then I used it to make chicken salad (for me) and tuna fish (for my husband) sandwiches.  It was a delicious addition to the sandwiches, although I do have to admit that it's no substitute for garlic bread made from a good french loaf.  It was perfect for sandwiches, though!  Thanks for the recipe!

Whenever my husband makes burgers he always butters the bun, sprinkles on garlic powder and parmesan cheese and puts them on the grill - after a couple of minutes he puts a generous amount of grated ceddar over each half, grills til melted - You've never tasted a better cheeseburger! He sometimes does this without the burger! Best cheesebread ever! Love it!

Three ingredients and ready in under 10 minutes.  I'll take it!  My kids loved this as a side to their pasta dish.  Great garlic bread recipe when you are in a pinch.

I have done this for years. I do mix my seasonings in the butter and spread on any type of bread I have in the kitchen. My husband even liked this garlic bread on regular sliced sandwich bread from the store. I bake or broil the bread in the oven.

Lol! My mom (a fantastic cook) does this. She's also been known to use plain bread - she used to serve it to me and my siblings with canned chili for a quick lunch.

Bless AllRecipes and the contributors for reassuring me that it's okay to make emergency garlic bread this way!  I've done it before but always felt kinda guilty about it.

That's three leftover hamburger buns put to good use tonight!  I did add some Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese this time.

Try this with English muffins, add a little dried parsley to the butter.  Makes great garlic bread alone, or add spagetti sauce and shredded cheese to make little pizzas for the little ones.

I tried this recipe since I had a craving for garlic bread but only had white sandwhich bread! I luckily had steak rolls and decided to try this recipe. I didn't exactly follow the ingredients, just doing it by eye. It did take longer than for minutes, mostly 'cause I didn't know if I should've set my broiler for low or high! I decided to be safe and went with high. It is good when you're in a pinch! It tastes delish and I had it with eggs. However, I put a little less garlic at first so had to add more and stick it in the broiler again. It came out crispy, just the way I like it! Overall, this recipe is great, especially if you cook often or have used a broiler. I am a terrible cook and have only used a broiler once, so I had just a bit of trouble. I would recommend.

I am generally an all-from-scratch kind of girl, but on a crazy night, we loved this easy use of the leftover hot dog buns! Just a warning--don't try to mix the butter and garlic powder to spread on top! I tried this the first time, and it just clumped up, so I had to melt more butter and brush it on and then sprinkle on the garlic powder just as written. Thanks for saving my dinner tonight!

Our church served these quite often with pasta dishes when we would have fellowship dinners after service. I had forgot all about them as we moved and no longer attend that church.  My go to's for day old or leftover bread/buns is usually homemade bread crumbs, croutons or bread pudding...I will be using this simply pleasing recipe as well now that I remember it!! how could I forget such an easy-cheap and great tasting recipe???? Hmmmm....good question....  The church ladies also added shredded cheese to about half of them and left the other half plain for those who don't or can't eat cheese.  I will be making these tonight as I have eggplant parmesan....( from this site) that I made late last night ready to go in the oven for dinner. i came on here to look for a quick recipe for garlic bread to accompany my dinner as I don't have any and the nearest store to me is 25 miles ( i live in the boonies on Table rock Lake)....and found this one. I will make a homemade garlic bread spread with some herbs and seasonings and top the little " french breads" with an italian cheese blend and then broil until light golden and bubbly!!  Another reviewer suggested serving these with sloppy joes....I have some leftover burger buns as well and will pt sloppy Joes on the menu for NFL sunday coming up this weekend !!  These would also be a great base for a meatball sub.... I gave it a 5 for the ease-low cost and versatility of the recipe.

I've been making this forever!  Yeah, it's not gourmet, lol but my kids just love it.  We use leftover hotdog buns, hamburger buns, etc. - you name it.  I've also added a bit of shredded cheese to it before broiling.  My daughter wanted this for her sloppy joes last week and it works great.

I've been making this for years but had some how forgotten about it's awesomeness until I realized I was broke until payday and the boys would really like garlic bread with dinner. This was a double bonus for me because it made some room in my freezer, which is awesome AND my boys were thrilled. So, YAY! I served this with Macaroni Gratinee, which is a fancy schmancy way of saying goulash. NOTE: This works with any kind of stale bread you may have on hand and is a lot better if you can use fresh garlic but it's not a necessity.

Hot Dog Bun Garlic Bread is the ONLY kind my grandsons will eat.

I can make home made bread, bake the frozen stuff, buy good bread or use the pre-fab stuff from the store, all that is a No Go to all of 5 them.

Somehow, the slightly sweet taste of the HDB's goes great with butter and garlic.  [...what am I saying...who am I kidding....I'd eat the dog, or one of my pet goats, if it had garlic and butter spread on it!!!]

I love this recipe simply because I personally look up recipes online when it is an emergency and I have to make do with what I have. It is very hard to find basic, simple, and easy recipes like this one in a crunch. Thanks!

These taste great, and they're so easy to make as an afterthought. I just throw mine in the oven with whatever entree I'm making and adjust the cooking time. Extra delicious when sprinled with herbs!

I'd never thought of this, and I often have hot dog buns on hand.
I have made "real" garlic bread recipes, and they're much nicer, but this was pretty decent. I ate the whole batch with dinner! When I made this, I used up a bottle of garlic powder, and it amounted to slightly less than 2 teaspoons - I would've liked quite a bit more. And for the butter, I used 2 tablespoons, more than the recipe mentioned. In my case, the hot dog buns were a softer bread than the garlic breads I'm used to, but that was okay. I guess I'll keep this in mind for occasional impromptu dinners.

Even if my guests could tell the bread was different from usual french bread, they didn't care! I could only find kaiser rolls as a viable option and I made garlic butter (from AR) using Earth Balance spread. Four minutes was way too long in my broiler; I would suggest keeping an eye on them from two minutes on. Much cheaper than the freezer and probably even a bit healthier!

This is a great idea.  I also use the leftover buns to make quick cinnamon buns.  Just spread with butter and sprinkle a cinnamon/sugar combo and toast/broil.  My mom used to make these for us when we were kids and now I make them for my kids.

We had a lot of hot dug buns left over from a cookout, so this was a great way to finish the buns off. After reading reviews, I also sprinkled Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese on top. Great flavors.

I used garlic salt because I'm a salt-o-holic and it tasted fabulous. Broiled mine an extra minute in the toaster oven because I wanted it a little toasted. It honestly tasted like the stuff from the store to me!

Quick, easy and delicious-my kind of recipe! I tried it with toast, and even that was yummy. Sometimes I add cheese and I might try some Italian seasoning. Now I can have it whenever I get a craving. Thanks for posting!

1st review I've done, maybe marked twice "if made it" but this I had to lol b/c I thought everyone did this lol! Growing up my mom made this, I did for my family, I will have to ask if my sons if they do in theirs! I love roasted garlic and when on hand I blend it in the butter, heavenly! A reviewer said they had trouble with lumps when mixing the garlic powder in with the butter. I've always used that method to be sure it's seasoned to taste (love garlic) never had lump issues. Maybe your butter wasn't softened enough or just required more blending. I'd give it another try as it is the way to be sure if you've added too little or too much.

Unless you are a total food snob (in which case you shouldn't be looking for this recipe anyway) this is a GREAT alternative when you find you have no garlic bread!     I love love it!   I do add some Italian seasoning to the butter along with the garlic powder.   ANd I don't broil.  I just bake on 425 for around 6 mins or so.    THANK YOU for this!   Thank you for making the rest of us not feel like freaks when we have been using this recipe in a pinch for years!

Using the broiler was a bit hard for me since it was below my oven. Since there wasn't a specified heat my first batch was burned. But to make sure they're crisp and not burnt, I put it at at 325 then let it broil for 10 minutes. It's longer sure but made sure they were golden brown and not black.

This is the garlic bread recipe my sons grew up on, especially when the budget was tight.  It is what it is. Cheap, easy way to use up leftover bread or stretch a dollar.

We have been doing this for years but we make it with regular bread. I also put a this layer of parmesan cheese on it and then sprinkle the garlic powder. We think its amazing although actual garlic bread is still better.

Just the wife and I now so it seems there is always leftover bread that I put in the freezer. Hating to waste anything, I routinely use it for garlic bread. Not as good as using fresh bread but very good. I have used ever kind of bread and rolls imaginable.

I do this all the time with the inexpensive French Sandwich Rolls you can get from the Kwip Trip convenience stores (Aldi's also carries them).  They are cheap (less than a $1.50 a package for 6), and make the most incredible crusty, chewy garlic bread!  A swipe of margarine or butter, a sprinkle of garlic salt or powder, and a dash of parsley, bake at 400 for 7-8 mins and viola, instant yummy garlic bread without the fuss or expense.  Each roll gives you two individual good size slices like the hot dog buns so it's perfect.  You can sprinkle on Mozzarella cheese if you prefer cheese GB too.  Thanks for the reminder that sometimes the simplest is often the best!

I too, have been doing this for years.  It's a great way to use up leftover hot dog, hamburger or sausage buns.  A little italian seasoning and some shredded mozzarella will fancy it up too. We often put them on a cookie sheet and toast on the top rack of the BBQ for 5-8 minutes. Yum!

I grew up with this as "garlic bread," only my mom would diagonally slice a loaf of French bread, then butter each cut and then sprinkle in garlic powder. She then rolled it in foil and baked it for a while. It's the best!  I prefer it over spicy, gloppy garlic bread recipes.

I have made my garlic bread this way for years.  The only thing I add is "Salad Supreme" sprinkled on top.  It makes a great tasting garlic bread.

I have made garlic bread with hot dog buns many times.  I use Garlic Bread Spread and toasted in the toaster oven and then have added Mozzarala cheese and Provolone cheese.  Stick in the broiler to melt and brown the cheese.  Love it.

Garlic bread emergencies happen with shocking regularity in our home and this recipe is my 911 solution. I make it exactly as written (I know! Who does that?) with a really loose interpretation of "as needed" and although it is easy to tell the difference between this and Italian bread, it is still quite delicious. Besides, I can only use so many breadcrumbs or make so many burgers, dogs, bun tacos and sloppy Joes. This recipe wins on 3 fronts - it's fast (10 minutes) and easy (3 ingredients), it uses up leftovers, and it's delicious. If that's not worth 5 stars, nothing is.

Easy and very good! Watch the time very carefully because even 1 minute can make a difference. I used my stove's broiler (don't have a toaster oven) and had to throw out my first batch because they burned. :(  I used hamburger buns and even went out to get more just to try these again! I added parmesan cheese on a few, but I think I prefer them without it. Thanks for the great recipe CANDYLAND7! UPDATE 2/15: Following another reviewer's suggestion, I just toasted the hamburger roll in my regular toaster. After it toasted, I buttered it, sprinkled with garlic powder and parmesan cheese. In a pinch, this works great (actually it didn't burn like my in my broiler and no heating up the stove)! Great tasting and good for a snack, too!

I've done this for many years, in fact when I was a kid the school cafeteria served their garlic bread like this with their spaghetti lunch.  I add cheeses, garlic, even parsley occasionally to be fancy lol.  The kids & hubby love it lol

Have used this since I was a bride 53 yrs ago.  However, I learned to melt butter and add garlic powder, then just dip cut side of hot dog bun and place on a cookie rack on a raised cookie sheet.  Bottom gets a bit crusty also.  Dipping gets more butter on evenly.  I will try parsley and maybe parm cheese this time.  Having Lasagna Christmas Dinner 2013.

I too, have made this before. It is a delicious way to use up hamburger and hot dog buns that are left over from your picnic or bbq since our household only uses fresh unfrozen buns for those 2 meals. The kids also love it because I let them assemble their own and like another member's review stated, it is really tasty with a little Parmesan cheese or finely grated cheese on top.. Mrs. Dash is also a good little spice to sprinkle on top (hence the kid's wanting to make their own.) Great add to this site candland7.

Awesome, easy recipe. Instead of garlic and butter, it works just as well to throw on some cheese for a quick, cheap cheesy bread.

Great idea!  A great way to use up leftover buns. I actually cut the buns into slices after broiling and serve with marinara sauce.  Some reviewers need to chill on the rating, and just enjoy this basic, yet creative, recipe!  Who cares if you know the difference or not!!!  It is a fun idea!

This is great for when you have extra buns on hand (hot dog or hamburger), and you don't want to throw them away or you need a quick and tasty bread to go with dinner. Sure, it's not the best garlic bread ever, but it serves it's purpose, and the best part is no waste! :)

I've used hot dog rolls for years as "garlic bread".  Can use minced garlic, garlic salt, fresh garlic...whatever!  The hot dog rolls are the perfect size and brown nicely under the broiler.

I ran across this recipe by accident and was surprised to find it. I do the same thing! I prefer hamburger buns, but either way my husby really likes them. Packaged buns work so much better than sandwich bread.

This is a great way to use up buns that might otherwise go to waste!  I added Italian seasoning and some parmesan, and they were gone in a flash- my boys loved them.  Thanks, Candyland!

Delicious. I added a little bit of oregano, too. And it made it even better.

I thought everyone made garlic bread this way!  We always have buns in the freezer and use this method to accompany our pasta dishes.  It's the only thing my husband can "cook!"  Thanks for posting this!

We loved this!  Great in a pinch, when you don't want to put a whole lot of effort into something and still have it taste good.  We have spaghetti at least once a week and this was nice to have accompanying it to make dinner different for once.  Thanks!

This is a great way to save money... I made this with spaghetti one night because I am really trying hard not to waste any food (We'd had BBQ sandwiches a couple days before).  I added Italian Seasoning and a mixture of Parmesan and Asiago cheeses.... Not bad!!!

Great in a pinch, and of course had I not forgotten they were under the broiler. Thanks! My 6 year old daughter was in charge of dinner with me that night and very upset that I had not thought of the garlic bread at the store... this made her very happy.

This is just what the name implies.  It's wonderful in an emergency but I wouldn't use it over good old fashioned garlic bread.  I've also used hamburger buns and regular sliced bread.

Ya know, this really wasn't bad at all; as a matter of fact, it was surprisingly good. I guess anything tastes great as long as it includes garlic and butter. I meant to buy Italian bread today but forgot, so I used what I had on hand which was burger buns. I also sprinkled some mozarella cheese on top and broiled. Thank you Candyland!

I have done this for years! They're a lot lighter & softer than french bread but a fair substitute when you don't want to run to the store.

I have done this ONLY when I needed garlic bread...the taste is completely different for us.  It was good and it is exactly what the name implies.  I did add some parm cheese and some parsley as well.  Thanks for the post.

OMG! I had to do the same thing once when I didn't have any French or Italian bread but had to have garlic bread. It turned out wonderful! Of course, the kids balked at not having the "real thing" but it did taste great.

I never would of thought to use hot dog buns for garlic bread; great idea!  It works if you have leftover buns (which I always seem to).  They don't taste as good as french bread does but they definitely work in an emergency situation.

This recipe definitely works well in an eergency. My family likes for me to add parsley flakes and parmesan cheese to the mix to add color and a bit of extra flavor. Using potato hot dog buns, or hamburger buns really taste well too.
