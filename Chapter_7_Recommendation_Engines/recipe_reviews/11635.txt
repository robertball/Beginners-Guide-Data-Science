I made this recipe with some hestitation because the reviews were quite mixed. But my husband requested a shaped pumpkin cookie so I was happy to find this. I must say that I did NOT experience any of the problems that some did. The dough was easy to work with and although the cookie itself is not cloyingly sweet, it does get the frosting which sweetens it up considerably. I'll just mention that I used 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c shortening as I was short on the butter. Also, as with any roll-out cookie I make. I chill for a minimum two hours then take the dough out and let it come to room temperature for a minimum of 1/2 hour before rolling. No pie-crust taste here. Just yummy cookies. Thanks for the recipe.

Despite all the negative reviews I thought I would give this recipe a chance because Im always looking for "seasonal" baking for the kids.  Im so glad I did!  We loved this cookie! It's so pumpkin-y/orange-y tasting...No pie crust, bland cookie here!  I also had no sticky problems.  It is a cut out cookie, so it does need to be chilled for a least a couple hours!  It rolled out beautifully.  I used Halloween cutters  (I frosted half of them for the kids) The flavours are more pronounced the next day.  A nice soft, flavorful cookie with a tinge of Autumn.  THX

I thought it was pretty darn good.  I used canned pumpkin pie mix (instead of solid pumpkin), continued with the spices, and it turned out YUMMY! (for a cookie that you decorate with sprinkles and such).  Will definately make this again.

I counteracted the blandness that others warned about by doubling all the spices, and serving them with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting on top. They turned out great.

I absolutely love these.  People always ask for the recipe.  I use an orange flavored cream cheese frosting and they turn out great.  By themselves I could agree with some of the other reviews, but I've made these every year at halloween and everyone loves them.

Very disappointing cookie.  Tasted much like pie crust.  Family very disappointed.  Not good use of time or ingredients.  Would not make these ever again.

I thought is was such a nice change to regular sugar cookies!  I doubled the spice and used a natural sugar alternative so my husband can eat them too and we all loved them!

I altered the recipe a bit to my preferences, as follows: - Whole egg, not just yolk - Doubled the amount of cinnamon - Subtituted clove for ginger - Put 3/4 c. brown sugar instead of 1/2 c. - Substituted a tablespoon of apple cider for orange zest - Added a bit more flour to accomodate extra liquid  With these adjustments these cookies were deliciously fall-spiced, moist and a hit with coworkers. I attribute the added cinnamon and sugar and apple cider to not having the flavor problem others had.  Be sure to refrigerate dough for a long time and cut cookies quickly as this dough gets mushy fast as altered.

My family demolished these cookies in two days, and I've already been requested to make them again (but a triple batch this time). I used sugar cookie icing and decorated them like jack-o-lanterns.

Not bad on taste - I was looking for something rather bland for toddlers anyway.  Took FOREVER to cook these though. It was hard to get the dough rolled thin enough.  I must have cooked them for at least .5 hr to get the insides cokked then they came out really hard.  I don't think I would make these again.

I like this cookie.   I did make a few minor adjustments,  by zesting an entire orange...which made maybe 1.5 tablespoons instead of one and by using only cinnamon to flavor the pumpkin, because thats what I had on hand.  I also used fresh pumpkin that I roasted and then boiled down.  They taste orangey like that, but I think it tastes better with more orange flavor.  They were ok to roll out.As long as you have enough flour dusted it doesnt stick.  I cut them in halloween shapes and I will be making them for halloween!  Thanks for the recipe.

They were a bit gooey. I Had to add a lot more flour because the dough was almost like batter. But I discovered that if the dough is rolled out really thin, these make a delicious cookie. I've even been eating them without icing. I'll continue to make these.  Thanks.

I thought they were a decent roll-out cookie.  They're a little on the chewy side, and they rise A LOT in the oven so be sure to roll them out to no more than 1/8 inch.  I did double the spice and as with my sugar cookies, I rolled them out in powdered sugar.  I did not have any oranges so I substituted some orange essence for the vanilla.

These had good flavor but needed far too much flour to roll and cut.  It was very difficult to work with unless you chilled the dough every 15 minutes.  The flavor didn't make the effort worth it for me.

Great Cookie for decorating.  Nice and firm to hold decorations.  We didn't put the orange zest for we did not have it on hand.  It taste like a fall cookie.

This is my go-to rollout cookie recipe.  I use Sucanat in place of the brown sugar.  I love that they are not overly sweet, and they hold up great for decorating by children.  As long as I use extra flour when rolling, I have no problems at all with the dough tearing or sticking when trying to roll and cut cookies.

I really wanted this cookie to taste better than it did.  The best part of this cookie was the icing and sugar cinnamon sprinkled on top.  It was too doughy and disappointing.

I made these cookies, I followed the recipe to the tee. They were very dry and didn't have any flavor except flour. I did add the right amount of seasonings, I was dissapointed, this is the first and last for these.

The dough was so sticky that i couldn't roll it out.  I tried to freeze it then roll and cut it out and after being in the freezer for 24hours, it was still to sticky to cut into shapes. I had to make gobs out of it. Then I did not care for the taste of the cookies at all.
**made again was able to roll out this time, but they tasted bland :(  Waste of time and supplies

If you like pumpkin flavor this is the cookie for you.  I did add more spice like others suggested.  Flavor was just too pumkiny. Did roll and cook nicely.  Definitely tasted better with frosting.  I used cream cheese found on this site.  Won't make again sorry.

These did not turn out for me.  They cut well but were VERY bland.  Tasted more like flour than pumpkin.  I even added more spices like other reviwers had mentioned and it just didn't work out.  I tried to salvage them with frosting and still had to throw them all away.

I tried it according to recipe (without orange zest) and it came out dry, pie crust like.  I did frost the cookies and that made them a difference.
Then I made them again after comparing what typical rolled sugar cookies have for ingredients.  I changed the ingredients to : 1 cup pumpkin; 1 cup brown sugar; 2 complete eggs; 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice; 1 teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1 cup more flour.
The cookies were more moist but still a little dry and frosting again added to the good taste.
The pumpkin puree I used was from cooked pumpkin from my garden and frozen from last year.  For many years I use  this kind of pumpkin for my pies and it tastes great.

Absolutely delicious!! Very easy to work with and a huge family hit! Next time I'll add a little more spice to give it a slightly stronger 'pumpkin pie' taste.

I also used the pumpkin pie filling in this recipe, and added a little bit more sugar because of using more flour to roll out the dough. They turned out very flavorful - definitely better than your average sugar cookie!

This recipe worked really well. The cookies came out really nicely, but to me, they tasted more orange than pumpkin, so the next time I make them I'll add more pumpkin or put some in the frosting. I used cream cheese frosting and it tasted good with the pumpkin and orange, but again, I think it would turn out better with some pumpkin added to the frosting or something.

Followed the recipe exactly, & they wouldn't hold their shape.  Kept scrunching back together like elastic.  They didn't want to bake either! Very disappointing.  Was making them for Thanksgiving in turkey shapes, but they never got served.

Disappointing. While I was happy it wasn't overly sweet, it was basically tasteless. The shapes were fun to cut out, but that was the extent of it.

I was looking forward to these since I LOVE pumpkin cookies, but these did not do it. Sorry. The texture is funny but more so, the taste is pretty bad, even with more sugar and spices.  Not very pumpkinny.

I am sorry to say...but I have to concur with the others.  This cookie DOES taste like pie crust.  I even tweeked the spices and added more sugar.  Difficult to roll out and weird texture.  I iced with a brown sugar glaze and they still weren't edible.  Won't be making this again:(

This recipe is awful. It tastes like pie crust. I tried it twice and tried vamping it up with more sugar and spice...still a big yuck. My 4 year old wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole. Don't waste time on this one!

A good holiday alternate to the reliable sugar cookie. I made them twice, and tweaked the spices the second time, doubling the amount of cinnamon and using clove instead of ginger.  I think it upped the flavor a bit. I helped to keep most of the dough in the refrigerator while I cut out the cookies from a portion at a time.

I love pumpkin but others in my family do not, which makes this recipe great as it has orange zest on it which still makes it flavorful to those who don’t like pumpkin. It is not too sweet, which is perfect since these are made to ice and decorate.

I had to make one small change to this recipe, as we have a family member who is allergic to cinnamon. I substituted 1/8 teaspoon of ground cloves for the cinnamon, and frosted them with a vanilla buttercream frosting. They were such a hit at our Halloween party! Not even a crumb left :)

I used melted butter with the sugar rather than creaming them together, highly suggest it. Also made them into little pumpkin shapes and frosted them with orange and green homemade frosting! They’re great warm but even better out of the fridge for a midnight cookie!!!!

The flavor was okay...a fun twist from regular sugar cookies.  The dough was sticky and impossible to work with, even after sticking the dough in the freezer to try and stiffen it up.

I won't make this again. Flavor was bland, but I frosted it with glaze flavored with chai tea flavoring which helped.  The consistency of this cookie is like a pumpkin bar that didn't rise. After a day in the storage container, the cookies got flimsy and so I just put them in the refrig to try to salvage them.  Will try another recipe.

I made these.  Yes they took long to bake the center.  I added 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and I added 1/2 teaspoon this helped more than any other idea attempts.  I will say stoneware baking pans help with the lack of burning and able to bake longer.  Then I added Watkins maple flavoring to another batch.   
Now I am going to try the biggest new flavor around here.    PUMPKIN

I'm still pretty new to baking and was nervous to try this based on all the negative reviews. I added double the spices and it turned out pretty good. They were still just a little bland, but I bought some cream cheese frosting and that improved it a lot. My biggest problem was in shaping it with cookie cutters. Even though I used the suggested amount of flour, it was very sticky and hard to work with. Still, it was a good cookie and I would definitely suggest it with cream cheese icing.

My dough was really sticky even after 2 hours of chilling in the fridge, so I had to add a lot more flour.  In trying to avoid the "pie crust" taste I even added some powdered sugar. It's possible my problem was my pumpkin was too watery.  The dough consistency seemed to be more like bread dough than cookie dough (even when it was sticky).  It had a lot of rebound when rolling out, and I had to keep rolling it in order to get it to stay . The cookies rose well (like sugar cookies) and were soft (like sugar cookies), but I didn't really like the taste or texture.  I'm sure they'll be fine once I get some frosting on them.  My 4 year old liked them without the frosting, but he's a kid.

So easy to make and bake. I omitted the salt & the only thing I'll change next time is add more spices. Otherwise it was perfect - So easy to do, quick in a flash, moist, tasty, and delicious right out of the oven with cream cheese frosting. Definately a favorite above the boring old sugar cookie!

It takes a couple days for the flavor to fully develop in these cookies but they're absolutely delicious once they've sat that long!  I made them for a Thanksgiving potluck and they were a big hit.  I'll definitely make them again!

I made the recipe exactly the same but doubled the spices. They were pretty good, but not amazing. I can see how someone might think they're piecrust-like, but I don't think anyone would say that if you didn't ask. I iced mine with royal icing and that helped a lot. My boyfriend doesn't have a sweet tooth at all and he really loved them.

I'm sorry to say, even though I followed the directions EXACTLY as they were (with the exception of doubled the spices as recommended by others), these cookies were a mess! The dough was way too soft, and by the time I got enough flour on the counter to roll out the cookies, and then baked them, they tasted bland - like flour! :( I'm glad to hear that others have had success with this recipe, however.

I followed the original recipe and they are more of a bread-like cookie - and would be great for low sugar - cookie for small children.  Great dough to work with, so nice for little hands to help.  Even with a cinnamon sugar topping before baking - they were very bland.  I vote for double spices and dribble chocolate over the top - it would be a sure fire winner.

I thought these were really good! They taste exactly like pumpkin pie in cookie form. I doubled the spices, though. The dough was super easy to work with, much better than other sugar cookie recipes I've worked with. I meant to use dark brown sugar but used light instead. They came out just fine, but the color was a bit lighter than I wanted. I melted vanilla and dark chocolate candy wafers and coated them with that. Delicious!

I follow the recipe to the letter and the cookies came out very bland and doughy.  I doubled the spices the second time, but they still were not very flavorful.  I ended up drowning them with frosting, which made them much better.  Overall, I wouldn't make these again- next time, I'll just stick with regular sugar cookies for cut-outs.

Agree with a lot of the others. With icing, they are great as they are. Without it though, they do lack some flavor.  Tried making them using the premade pumpkin mix as someone recommended.  I will make again, but will definitely use the pumpkin puree and double, maybe triple the spices. I desperately want a pumpkin roll-out cookie that doesn't require icing to make it taste good.

An outstanding cookie with the orange rind - I also doubled the spices based on other reviews.  Not at all a bland cookie, soft in the middle, though, does not get crispy like some other rolled cookies.  I drizzled with orange glaze - delicious!

They either needed sugar or something. I would NEVER make these again, they had NO flavor.

This is one of the best pumpkin cookies that I have had or made. I changed one of the ingridents in the recipe, instead of Ginger, I put Allspice. My family and friends like them so far.

These were very, very bland...not much taste at all.  They sure did look cute, though!!
