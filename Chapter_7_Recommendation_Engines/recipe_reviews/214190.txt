Great recipe! It's got a wonderful citrus flavor that's great with a citrus grilled chicken.  I left out the cilatro (personal preference).  Overall, a very tasty side dish.

I made this rice to go with baked jerk chicken and it was amazing! I followed the recipe with one omission (accidental) and one addition. I forgot to put in the salt and added a diced orange bell pepper. This was incredible! I loved the fresh, savory sweetness of it and will absolutely make it again! To address the issue of the rice burning, you need to add more liquid from the beginning. White rice needs twice as much water to cook properly. For this recipe I used 1 cup water and 1 cup of pineapple juice. That should keep your rice tender and moist

I liked this, the rest of the family passed on it. This has a nice strong citrus flavor, the lime really comes through.

I pulsed fresh pineapple in the mini chopper for the crushed pineapple.  I wanted a strong lime flavor, so I added additional lime juice and zest.  The pineapple, lime, and cilantro flavors all complement each other giving you a really fresh flavor.  Nice change from plain white rice with minimal effort.  ••••• UPDATE 4.11.17 •••••This rice always goes well with Asian dishes, and today that recipe was Thai Meatballs in a Tomato Coconut Curry Sauce (this recipe is also on this site).

I made this as a side to California Chicken on this site.  My husband, who hates fruit in his dinner, liked it.  So, I thought it was a success.  I didn't have any cilantro in the house, and I am positive it would be better with it.  I think it needed a kick though--maybe some jalepeno or green chiles.

I liked this but I feel like it needed a kick of something....more lime zest or cayenne?  I will definately make again as I am always looking for new ways to make rice.

Very good rice!!  I made it using fresh pineapple and it turned out great.  I also used about a half cup of cilantro and a little more green onions.

I might have to admit- I might be a rice queen!

This was delicious- added a lot more lime to the rice and it was nice and tangy!

Had a nice zing to it. My step-son didn't enjoy it much so the kids put the sauce from there hawaiian chicken on it and ate it. But my b/f and I liked it, and didn't get any complaints from my step-daughter. Went well with my Hawaiian themed dinner this week.  I did have a problem with it burning only after 8 minutes so I had to add more water and i put more crushed pineapple in it due to the water washing the sweetness out.

We loved it! Used brown rice and made more than the recipe originally called for and so just did the 1:2 ratio for liquid.  Also added an orange bell pepper.  Served with teriyaki chicken for a delicious meal!

Made this when my friend came over. It was okay, but added a little cayanne pepper for a little more taste. Wasn't may kind of side dish. My friend like it though.

Great flavors...I used white rice but the liquid was not enough to cook the rice.   I questioned the amount b/c the box calls for double the liquid to the amt of rice.  I had to add mor as it cooked.  Will try it again though!

Yum!!! As per other reviews, I added a cup of water and a cup of pineapple juice. I actually needed to add a bit more water (1/2 cup or so) about halfway into cooking which didn't seem to change the outcome. I made this along with the Key West chicken on this site and it was a great combination.

This was a nice change from plain white rice. I love fresh taste of the lime. I added a dash of peprika and onion salt instead of regular salt. It came out great. Thanks for the recipe...

Sadly, I didn't care for this at all.  I love rice, pineapple, and lime but, this just didn't do anything for me.  Try the "Carrot Rice" on this site.  It's amazing.  Thanks for sharing though : )

Made this with some garlic shrimp and it was a great side dish! Compliments of the sweet and citrus flavors were liked by my boyfriend too. He says it's the best rice he's ever had. :)

I did not care for this recipe. I thought a slightly sweet rice would be good, but I did not like it. The flavors are very bold. You can taste each of the flavors throughout, and I love those flavors, but apparently not mixed together in a rice. It was easy to make, but I probably will not make again.

Very good. Unfortunately I didnt have cilantro (thought I did when I started) or fresh lime for zest.  It still was very tasty using concentrated lime juice.  Can't wait to try again with cilantro & zest. I may add a little more green onions.  Ate with teriyaki chicken.

I agree w/ the "needs more kick" comment... I added a diced serrano and half of a diced spicy sausage. With a very delicately flavored main dish, this might stand on its own. Also, living in a dry climate, I felt the rice absorbed all the liquid before it fully cooked-- I tried an add'l 1/2c juice and 1/2c water the next time, with much better consistency of the rice.

Yum.  Will be making this again and again.  I've been trying to figure out how to do it in my Instant Pot, but regular stove top will be just fine.

I was unsure of the flavor combo for this recipe but it was really good! Loved the subtle hint of lime and cilantro with the pineapple. Nothing is overpowering. I omitted the green onion because I didn't have any on hand. I made this in my rice cooker and the only thing I would change is to reduce the amount of water to 1/2 cup (same should apply if you make this on the stove).  I didn't care for the sticky/mushy rice. Served as a side to grilled pork chops seasoned with Jamaican Jerk Dry Rub. Will make this recipe again with 1:1 ratio rice to liquid. Thanks for the recipe!

Yes.  Instead of me using can crushed pineapples I opted to use fresh pineapple chunks with the can pineapple juice which turned out great in flavor especially since the pineapple was not bought in high season for ripeness.  I will make this one again

07.29.17 ~ A very flavorful rice to serve with pork. I did make two adjustments since I was making this early and going to reheat at dinner time.  I doubled the recipe using 2 cups of water and 2 cups of pineapple juice.  I also finely chopped a fresh pineapple in place of canned and threw in some diced orange pepper that was in the fridge.  I waited until I reheated it to add the lime juice, cilantro and green onions.  Served this with 'Grilled Pork Tenderloin' from AR.  Took this meal to my parents and everyone really their dinner.

I can't believe this only gets four stars. I've been making it for years and we just love it. Moist and refreshing!

I followed the recipe, did not add cilantro; added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and a package of that faux crab mix, dished it up with fresh lemon slices.  Very reminiscent of a dish I used to get from the rickshaw food stands in Thailand ... only without the super-red-hot chili peppers Ubuitous to Thai food.

I made this as a side for Giada's sweet and spicy chicken, which has a pineapple-based, teriyaki-style marinade/sauce. I followed the recommendations of other reviewers to increase the amount of lime zest/juice, which was the perfect foil to the sweet chicken dish. 
I also used chicken broth instead of water for added flavor.  Hubby wasn't a huge fan, I loved it.

We really enjoyed this rice.  I made it to go with Cancun Chicken from the Dole Pineapple site.  Wonderful pairing and it's something I'll definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this, as did my guests.  I left out the cilantro, but the lack of it did not matter.   Loved it!

I made this dish for a party. Everyone loved it. Some said they had thirds.  The only change I would make would be to add less green onion.  I thought it overwhelmed the other flavors.  My husband didn't agree; he said the onion was fine.  So if you like green onion, go ahead and add it.

I made this exactly as the recipe said for a change. It was a fantastic side for my Caribbean Jerk Chicken!

This was good but I had to change it up a little... Upon reading, I agree you have to have more liquid than it says.... So I used 1 cup pineapple juice and 1 cup water from the very start.  I ended up having to add another 1/2  a cup of water or so anyway.  Does the juice soak up faster or evaportate? I don't know... Anyways,  At the end I added the cilantro and green onion as directed but then I also had some pineapple leftover from a large can.  I trained it well and even squeezed the juice out of it and mixed that in too... it went really well with my crockpot Hawaiian pork.

This was so easy to get together and a nice change from a plain white rice.   It was tangy from the lime juice, sweet from the pineapple, & fresh from the cilantro and green onion.   It was perfect with "Unbelievable Chicken" from this site and steamed broccoli.   The only thing I didn't like was the rice was a little gummy.  Overall, it was a very tasty dish!

My husband said this was the best rice he's ever had.  I found it a bit flat--it needed something to balance the sweet.  I added Sriracha and soy sauce and we had it with teriyaki salmon and shrimp. Overall delicious. 
I used instant rice which just requires one cup of liquid so I did 1/2 cup pineapple juice (which I squeezed from the can of crushed pineapple) and 1/2 cup water.  Very tasty and a welcome variety in our menu line-up.

I like this dish! As I was making it, I thought a few Thai chiles would be a good idea. In the next day's leftovers I added two. This turned out to be a great idea. The chiles do add a another note to the dish but if ya like a little kick...just doooowit
