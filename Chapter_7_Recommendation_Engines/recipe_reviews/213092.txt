This was better than I expected!  I left out the bell pepper, mushrooms and red wine because I didn't have them on hand.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly, including the lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce which I was skeptical about.  In the end, I'd say to be sure to include these two items and they added a flavor element that "brightened" the rest of the dish.  We loved it!  I know it will freeze well, so this one will be a staple in our packed lunches.

When I make chili I make a huge pot so I can freeze some. So, I tripled the recipe and used three different kinds of beans. I drained them because I don't like the sliminess of the juice. I added some canned vegetable broth to make up for it. I also didn't use fresh tomatoes because winter tomatoes lack flavor so I used diced canned tomatoes and their juice. My kids won't eat mushrooms so I left them out, but I bet it would be great them. I added corn, chipotle and cilantro.

A great veggie chili recipe- loved having such a variety of stuff in- beans, pepper, mushrooms. But this was also a downfall at least for me because I didn't have any celery or bulgar- turned out great anyways, with great flavour!

Quite possibly the best meatless chili that I've ever had.  Really, really good.

Yummy, was great, and my family didn't even realize how healthy it was. I omitted the carrots (as I don't believe they belong in chili).  I also added more beans (an extra can of kidney and two cans of pinto).  I didn't have bulgar wheat so I left that out.  I used tomato sauce instead of tomato juice.  This was not hot at all, which was a plus since my toddler had to have some.  Very good receipe, thanks you.

I made this recipe for a church supper and three different people wanted the recipe! For added protein I added a tin of chick peas (garbanzo beans). It was appropriately hot as well.

This is a keeper. My husband and I have recently switched to a mostly vegetarian diet and this non-meat chili recipe  is a real find. I did use soy crumbles instead of the bulgur, but that's the only change.

My favorite.  I follow it basically.  If I'm missing something like the wine I just skip it and it turns out great.   I have to say it is best when you follow it to a t but no matter what happens it's always worth it.

This chili is a little hot and takes a little time to chop all of those base vegetables. However, it is thick, filling, and loaded with fiber. I think bulgar does that for lentil soups and vegetarian soups, that just can't really be achieved otherwise. I followed the recipe, except I didn't have mushrooms. So, I added a can of Trader Joe brand drained organic pinto beans along with the similar brand Kidney beans. I actually made this because I was getting low on vegetables in the house, but had plenty of celery, carrots, onions, and canned tomato and bean products. For the 2 cups of diced tomatoes, I used 1 can of no-sodium petite diced tomatoes. I had a cheat sheet on my fridge, for subtitutions, and did half water half tomato sauce in a can for the pre-made tomato juice. I also used sirachi hot sauce, for the hot sauce, as it was all I had and I left out the 2 Tblsp. of green chilis as it was plenty hot. When it was done, I tasted it and felt like it needed another ingredient. I added 1 cup of defrosted frozen roasted corn, Trader Joes brand. For garnish I did finely grated hot pepper cheese and some Trader Joe brand oyster crackers. That worked well. I would suggest this chili to vegetarians. ty

This recipe is delicious! All you would hope for in a vegetarian super healthy chili! The only adjustments I made were no bulgur and the only spice I used were the pepper flakes. I donâ€™t like my food spicy and just the small amount of red pepper flakes made it spicy enough for me. I figured whoever eats it can always add more kick in the end.  I made it alongside cornbread muffins. SO good!

It was awesome! For my first attempt at chili, this recipe helped me make it a huge success, thanks! I used a variety of dried beans instead of beans from a can as well as fresh tomatoes, so of course I had to change some things around regarding water and timing. Also I added a little red wine vinegar instead of that sauce, red lentils instead of bulgur, and some fresh parsley and cilantro, but those were the only changes I made.

I loved this but my hubby didn't care for all the veggies.  The flavor just got better every day since I had plenty of leftovers and it froze for later lunches as well.

The combination of ingredients works well for a full flavored chili without meat.  Next time I will cut the chili powder & salt in half.  It is very spicy.  EnJOY!

It's good,but not vegetarian if you use Worcestershire (Anchovies).There are alternatives out there with no anchovy paste or anchovies in them. Or skip the Worcestershire altogether. Still "Could fool a meat eater" chili. Fooled me.

Just made this. I did a few changes such as omitting the carrots. Not something I ever wanted in chili. I added some of my own spices to my taste but everyone loved it!
