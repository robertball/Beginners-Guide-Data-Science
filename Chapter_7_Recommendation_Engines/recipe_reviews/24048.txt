Just like Grandma used to make.  Amazing flavor!  I used evaporated milk like my Grams instead of cream.  The family was elated to taste this delicious fudge again.  Perfect Penuche!

I have searched high and low for a Penuche recipe that comes close to that my father made when I was growing up.  This is it!  I also made a second batch and varied this recipe by adding maple extract and it tasted like maple sugar candy. My family has gone nuts over this recipe.

I used fat free half-and-half and it turned out quite well -- not quite as creamy as I would have liked but this was possibly due to boiling or beating it too long.

It was the tastiest failure I ever made. I made this for a Christmas goodie basket, and it was so runny it had to be frozen before packaging. I thought everyone would be put off by it's texture, but everyone was licking it off the waxed paper! People raved about it. I would suggest cooking it to a higher temperture and being very sure that is crystalizes, but I have no complaints about the flavor- it was absolutely delicious. The perfect flavor makes it a keeper.

WAY too much brown sugar! Not too bad as far as taste but the texture was not fudge-like at all... It was very grainy and was basically a pan of sugar. Next time I'll try using less sugar and a little more butter.

This fudge came out so bad I had to throw the whole batch in the trash.  It was still sugar/gritty after letting it cook to the right temp.  Even the flavor was not that great, and it requires way too many nuts!

It turned out crumbly. It tasted okay but the pieces just fell apart.

I guess I was expecting something different when I made this, but it was basicly a brown sugar prailine.. It would be improved with a pie crust to cut the sweetness. It was so rich that my husband and I could barely finish one square. Then it sat in my kitchen until I threw it out! Was kind of a waste of time to make, unless you like eating what seemed like pure sugar!

well to be honest the taste of this was exactly what i was looking for but the texture didn't work for me. mine was extremely hard to stir and hardened too much.i may have boiled it to too high a temperature as i didn't have a thermometer. i will try again with it.

I followed the recipe as written. I was a little disappointed. I was hoping for a smooth, creamy texture. Instead, it turned out quite granular, like a soft cube of brown sugar.

This turned out rubbish for me. I made the fudge using a mixture of white sugar, light muscavado and dark muscavado brown sugars (with the dark making up the majority) but the final fudge just ended up tasting exactly like the brown sugar. I decided to recook it and add a whole can of evaporated milk and some semi skimmed and it turned out great. But in my opinion the original recipe has nowhere near enough milk.

Tastes amazing, but the texture wasn't quite right.  Its probably because I tried to make this without a candy thermometer (although I did take it off at the soft ball stage).

Absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as directed except that I didn’t have a candy thermometer; I had a heavy pan and I let the heat build up slowly. When it came to a boil I turned the heat down slightly and let it boil for about 10 minutes, and tested the soft-ball stage. It behaved perfectly when the hot-sugar drop was removed from the cold water and placed on a flat surface, it flattened out as it should at the soft-ball stage. I removed the pan from the heat and let it sit in the cold kitchen for maybe a half hour, when the pan bottom was only vaguely warm. I beat it for several minutes but it never lost its shine, so I poured it into a buttered pan to cool and put the pan in the fridge to help that along. When I checked later I found that the pan had tipped a bit so the fudge was thicker on one end than the other, but it cut into nice thick pieces on the thicker end, and they ALL are smooth and creamy! Very delicious Penuche like I remember from my childhood! Quick and easy!

Like so very many, this was exactly like Gramma used to make.  Depending on finances, she used evaporated milk, or heavy cream.  I'm inclined to prefer the evaporated milk, so I guess that I experienced it more during the less prosperous times. ;~)!
