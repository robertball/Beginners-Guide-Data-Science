I made this for the nursing home I worked at and everyone loved them. I also took some into work and they enjoyed them. I have never made hot cross buns before and found this receipe easy. I did sub all white flour because I didn't have the whole wheat flour. I hope more people try this one.

These came out very good.  I substituted raisins for the currants and chopped dried apricots for the candied fruit peel.  Also, I did icing crosses instead of pastry ones.  I did end up adding an extra 3/4 cup of flour, although that may have been because I started with 2 cups whole wheat and 2 cups all-purpose.

This is a terrific whole wheat flour recipe. I used golden raisins instead of currants, and I left out the candied fruit. These are easy to make and taste great, though they might be a little too sweet for some people to have with dinner.

What did I do wrong?  Followed the recipe to the letter, even purchased new yeast to ensure freshness.  I am not a novice bread maker, yet this dough didn't rise after two hours!

I decided to make these without the cross as indicated, instead I used a powdered sugar and sour cream frosting.  The buns are delicious!  I like the nutmeg more than I thought I would!  The candied peel gives these a taste of holiday bread!  Thanks for this great recipe!

I used whole wheat pastry flour and the bun itself turned out tender and flavorful. I had trouble with the topping. The dough was difficult to roll out. We ended up rolling each piece by hand but the crosses mostly cracked and fell off.  I will make this again but use frosting or some of the dough for the crosses.
