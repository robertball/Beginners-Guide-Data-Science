Really very good.  I didn't haves time to bake it, so just served the green beans in the sauce and it was great.  I usually make something kind of like it using mustard, butter and worchestershire sauce and my husband liked these flavors much better.  A keeper.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner thinking that it would be something a little different.  It was different all right--no one went back for seconds or thirds, as they do with my usual way of cooking green beans.  Overall, this recipe is easy to make, but it just doesn't taste very good at all, nor does it look appetizing.

Tangy, flavorful with bacon and onion - yummy! I drained off all the bacon grease  and only used what stuck to the pan to saute the onions - there was just enough to cook the onion without contributing a lot of fat. I may cut down on the amount of chili sauce just a bit the next time, but we really enjoyed this dish!

This was an easy dish to make but it got mixed reviews. I wasn't able to eat any because the smell really bothered me. Both of my daughters loved them. My husband, on the otherhand, wasn't thrilled. He said the chili sauce and brown sugar was too overpowering. Thanks anyway!

A great way to liven up a can of green beans. I didn't really notice the brown sugar. This would go well as a bbq side dish.
