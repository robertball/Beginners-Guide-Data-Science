I used one ginormous red bell pepper (we don't care for green bell pepper),  the last dredges of a bottle of Newman's italian dressing (it was around a half cup, I didn't measure.....I was in a hurry), reduced fat cream cheese/mayonnaise and I upped the roast beef to a full pound. I didn't have time to throw it in a baking pan, I just tossed everything into my small crockpot and let it go until we got back home at noon. Boys literally inhaled this in less than twenty minutes. I served it with day-old toasted bread and Wheat Thins. HUGE hit. Next time I might increase the provolone, but it's not hugely necessary. They loved it regardless.

I made this with Steak Ums like some of the other reviewers, that was a mistake! It was really greasy and nasty. I tasted it before adding the (drained) meat and liked it, so I'm going to try again with real roast beef.

This dip is great!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  It truly taste like a real cheese steak.  I made it for a party and everyone gobbled it up.  I actually prefer it served with the hoagie buns.  I thought this was such a clever idea to make a sandwich out of a dip!!!

Really really good. I had to substitute some things because I realized I had no Italian dressing so I used olive oil, red wine vinegar, basil, oregano. garlic and black pepper.  The results were awesome. When I took it out of the even there was a layer of grease on the top but I placed a paper towel over it for a few minutes and it absorbed all the excess oil nicely. I don't know if that was because of subbing oil for dressing but the taste was awesome. I definately want to try it with the Italian dressing but it was yummy as I made it. I served it with garlic bagel chips and Tostitos.

We really, really enjoyed this recipe! I realized that I only had light zesty italian dressing and went with it anyways, and it turned out GREAT! I did replace the roast beef with thin sliced steaks that I cooked ahead of time and chopped up (for a more authentic taste). I will definately be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

This is an awesome recipe!  The only thing I do different is add the chopped roast beef in the skillet when cooking the onion and green pepper.  I prefer my roast beef browned.  I follow everything else exactly and it comes out great every time!  YUMMY!!

This is a great way to use up leftover roast beef! I didn't have green peppers(have indigestion issues with them...UGH!) and subbed yellow and red and orange peppers (I know, not too far off but for us they are a bit milder) and they worked out very well. Used mozzarella because thats what I had but will definitely try with provolone next time as the recipe states...thanks for sharing!

This dip was AMAZING!  There were half a dozen people who wanted the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and I would give it 5 stars, but there was a bit of a road bump.  When I added the cheeses and mayonnaise, it formed this rubbery ball.  I added some milk and whisked it until it became smooth and creamy. When I took it to the potluck, it was almost all gone before we even "officially" started eating!  Great dip.  Definitely will make it again.

This was actually pretty good!  I didn't use the Italian dressing because it just didn't sound like a taste that I wanted in there.  Instead, I used olive oil with some Montreal Steak Seasoning.  The only cream cheese that I had on hand was chive and onion flavored...it turned out to be a good addition.  I still felt like there was a little something missing...not sure what.  I will tinker with it a little until I figure out what it is.  This recipe definitely has potential!!!  Thanks!!!

This is very delicious.  I made it for a potluck at work (since co workers are always willing to be guinea pigs).  I made it in a small crock pot.  By the end of the potluck only a small dollop of dip was left.  I served it with French bread and ended up making a sandwich out of it.  Yummy!  I will be adding this to my list of favorite recipes!  I would recommend if you're feeding a large crowd to double the recipe.

Made as directed, this is not very good. It is oily (mayo & Italian dressing) and gooey (provolone cheese). So gooey that it is impossible to dip. I tried making this again with modifications, and it was much better. Substituted mozzarella for the provolone, sour cream for the mayo, and Montreal Steak seasoning (2T) for the dressing. For the meat, I found John Soules Foods Angus Beef Steak strips in the freezer section at Walmart. I chopped the steak strips and cooked them in a skillet with the green pepper and onion for 5 minutes before adding the mixture to the rest of the ingredients in a crock pot. This was delicious. I will make this dip again with modifications. I really wanted to like the original recipe, but it just wasn't very good.

This was pretty good.  I did make some minor changes based on my taste - I used 1-1/2 C of onions and no green peppers.  I could barely taste the onions so I will probably do both the next time I make it.  While this was very good, it was also very rich.  I think it is fine "as is" for a potluck but if I make it again for my personal consumption I will probably replace the provelone with mozzarella and the mayo with sour cream.  It was also not a thick as I was expecting.  It definitely was not runny but I will probably add more roast beef the next time.

This is a wonderful dip. I used low fat ingredients. When I made this I used low fat cream cheese, light mayo and light for fat free italian dressing. Also used deli roast beef. My favorite is Deitz and Watson sliced roast beef. Not only is it easy but its healthier. Soo yummy!! Great for football games. Go Steelers!!!!

Really hate to write negative review on a recipe so highly rated but this was not great! Used left over roast beef and followed the rest to a T- Made a lot and had a lot left over after the super bowl....Had a hard time throwing it away but leftovers were worse than original.

This dip was okay, it didn't quite meet my expectations. I would not add the mayo, it turns into oil immediately and then needed to be drained off. Adding the milk to make it creamy was a good suggestion. If I make it again I will try dry italian seasoning mix to eliminate more oil.

I have made this a few times now over the years and I always get asked to bring it to family functions now.  Everyone loves it.  I have to increase the amount to feed 48 servings and it is always scrapped off the bottom of the dish... finger lickin' good!  Must have dish for any fall festivities!!!

I made this dip for a cookout. I did not make any changes to the recipe.  I thought it was very good.  The only negative thought I have is that you need to eat it immediately while it is hot because once the cheese congeals, it is hard to eat.  Served it with french bread.

Made this today for a small gathering.  Added more roast beef and substituted chopped up red peppers instead of the green.  Served with slices of French bread, amazing and a real keeper, people were even eating it without the bread!

This was a really good dip, I loved it, 2 of my children loved it although I have one that doesn't want to try anything.  I just wouldn't call this Philly Cheese Steak Dip as it is so far from a real Philly Cheese Steak...although the taste is definitely awesome and I will keep this to make again and again.

I used sliced steak for a more authentic taste versus roast beef. The dip was very good .... just not quite 5 stars  Needs some tinkering around with (spices, amounts, etc).

I served this on Christmas Eve and received rave reviews! Everyone wanted the recipe. A little pricey to make but it was well worth every penny! The roast beef alone cost me $5.25. I will definetly make again and again. Thanks!

This was a very good recipe.  I found it easy to make and tasted great on bagel chips.  It also makes a good sandwich spread.

I made this with cheese whiz instead of provalone and i used finely chopped steak rather than the roast beef.  It was awesome!

This was good, It went before I could bake it in the oven and it is good at room temp.

This was absolutely great! I served it on sourdough toasts. I think next time I may double the onions and peppers, and halve the cream cheese to make it more like a spread than a dip. This is a keeper!

The taste was alright but not like any cheesesteak our family has had before.  Followed the recipe exactly. The italian dressing gives it an unusual taste. Not a bad taste, just not the one we were expecting. Probably won't make again.

It was ok. Followed recipe exactly. Something is just off... If I made it again, I would double the green pepper, but I probably won't

This was ok, the flavor of the meat and peppers wasn't as strong as I thought it would be.  But it was something different and I'm glad I tried it.  I wonder if it would taste better if assembled the night before to give the flavors a longer time to blend before baking?

Heaven!  We crave cheese steaks every week so this was definitely for us.  I used 8 Steak-Um's chipped steaks, omitted the green pepper and Italian seasoning, added Kansas City steak seasoning and added mushrooms.  So good!  Next time I'll use at least 4 more steaks.  Served with sliced Italian bread.
