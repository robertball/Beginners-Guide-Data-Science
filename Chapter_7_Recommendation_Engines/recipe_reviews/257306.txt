Quick weeknight dinner.   I doubled the flour mixture but not the salt; it came out without enough salt!  I ate mine with ranch dressing.  We liked it!  Oh yeah, another thing - our chicken was boneless as well, so it had  quite a bit of surface area and it wasn't as thick, so in 20 min it was quite ready... I took the first batch out after 16 min and finished it in a 350 degree oven turned down to 250.  The chicken was done; we like our chicken well done!

Great recipe! The chicken cooked faster than anticipated (definitely  less than 20 mins) so if you want yours to be as juicy as mine was, make sure you do not over cook. Just make sure you season the meat before coating with batter for more flavor. I used skinless chicken thighs the first time and chicken tenderloins the second. Thanks for the recipe.

Overall a good recipe. Mine got a little on the dry side after 20 minutes but other than that I have no complaints. I really liked the flavor of the corn oil in this.

Turned out great but 20 minutes is a tad too long for boneless, skinless chicken thighs. More like 15 minutes. I did as most everyone else & doubled all ingredients as I didn’t think a half cup of flour would go very far. I dropped them in flour first, then egg & then in the bag of flour. They had a great crust. Don’t turn too much or you’ll lose the tasty crust!! Family was pleased!!!

This chicken came out great!!! I added a little spin of my own to it. I squeezed the juice of 2 limes into a bowl dipped my chicken thighs in lime juice then in the flour mixture. I took the thighs out of flour mixture and let them sit for 5 minutes. Then dipped them in the lime juice and flour mixture a second time. They tasted so good. They came out great !!

This recipe is a great find and so easy! Didn't think skinless thighs could replicate fried chicken so well. Will now add it to my regular dinner entree rotation library.

A little on the salty side. And I like salt. I doubled the recipe on the flower and stuff cause I didn't think 1/2 cup would coat 8 pieces of big thighs. So instead of 1 teaspoon of salt I doubled just like everything else. Well I should have put 1 1/2 teaspoon instead and it would have been perfect. Other than that is so easy and delicious.
