11.21.18  Love the natural sweetness of this cranberry sauce and love that it has no sugar.  Too many cranberry sauces are loaded with a boatload of sugar, often to the point where you canâ€™t even taste the cranberries.  This has a good balance of sweet-tart, with the fresh pineapple and honey enhancing the sweetness.  It has a delicate flavor, and tastes light and fresh. Very nice!
