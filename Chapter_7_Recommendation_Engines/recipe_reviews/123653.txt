Ilove this soup! It's my favorite vegtable beef soup. I disagree that it's heavy on the meat-I use 2 pounds of round steak when I make it.I add 4 cups of water,minced garlic, pinch of sugar, fresh minced parsley and a bay leaf.Some worcestershire sauce and a squirt of ketchup too. So delicious....really hits the spot on cold winter nights.

This was a very easy recipe to follow. I like that is has common basic ingredients. It is one of the lowest in sodium content that I have found and still very flavorful!! Thank you for sharing.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made it for the first time today with just a few changes (more like tweaks!). First, I only used 1/2 an onion due to our taste preferences.  I used 2 cans of beef broth instead of the bullion and water, but I still had to add water to cover all the veggies!  I also threw in a little garlic, thyme, and bay leaf, used a lot more pepper, and added about a cup of tomato juice to give the base a little more oomph. Because of the extra tomato, I put in about 1/4 teaspoon of sugar to round out the tartness.  This was sooooooo good, my husband is still raving about it!  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe.  I will definitely make it again!

I think this is a good basic recipe but I did make changes.  Here they are: (1) not a big slowcooker fan so I made this on the stovetop instead of in the slowcooker (2) used beef broth along w/the bouillon (3) cooked the meat, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes together w/the spices for about 1-1/2 hours on medium-low then added frozen peas, cooked for another 1/2 hour, then added canned green beans.  It fabulous!  Served with biscuits hot from the oven.
Yummy!  Thanks for the idea, Heather!

This soup was excellent.  I like a tomato based vegetable soup so instead of 3 cups water, I used 1 cup water and 2 cups V8 tomato juice. For sure I'll make this again.

This is almost as good as my mom's.  The fresh veggies are key to the great taste and it's very simple to make.  This version is a little heavy on the beef for my taste.  Next time, I will substitute some of the actual meat for beef broth and add tomato juice (as opposed to just the diced tomatoes).

Thank you for the recipe.  I really liked this soup, though I think my Mom's recipe for vegetable soup is better.  Still, this was great because by the time I got home from work the soup was done and the house smelled wonderful!  Thank you for sharing!

This is sooo good!  I've made this soup several times.  The first time exactly as written, but have found that using beef broth or beef consomme gives it a much fuller, richer broth.  Also, adding thyme as an ingredient really made it complete.   A great winter meal-You'll love it!

Very good basic vegetable beef soup.  I added a tablespoon of garlic powder, worchester sauce, a bay leaf and some season-all salt to taste.  I also used 2 lbs of stew meat and it came out perfect...really good on a cold night.

So Good!!! Instead of steak I put 1 cup of split peas, 1/2 tsp of garlic salt instead of salt, added 1 bay leaf, 1/2 tsp parsley.  For the potatoes, I put 1 sweet and 1 baking and for the frozen veggies 3/4 cup of corn and 3/4 cup of peas.  I just stirred the frozen veggies after 6 hrs and ate the soup right away and it was done.  Wil make again for sure.

This was good, but I think it needs more pizzazz....some more spices or something.  It's a good starting point.  Just keep in mind if you like LOTS of flavor, you need to add more to this recipe.

I used italian seasoning instead of oregano, as I did not have any. It's good but... The kids did not enjoy it too much though, because it may have been a bit sour from the tomatoes. Nice and practical soup. I did not add the veggies in the end, just added extra carrots and celery in the beginning, because I was going to be out all day. I will try no tomatoes, and chicken broth instead of beef next time.

Did the dish while at work so I had to put it on 'Low" for 11 hrs. Barely any liquid when I got home - had to add two cups. Added the frozen veggies but couldn't wait another 2 hrs so I served it up after 1 hr. Found it to be a little too watery and the frozen veggies still a little under cooked. Net result - dish not good beyond recommended cook time, (better on the weekend).

This is a nice easy soup to make and a wonderful meal to come home to at the end of the day.  I just added some other spices to suit my families tastes and I have made it a few times.  Also I am on weight watchers and it is a very low point meal, I can have two servings and still keep it healthy.

Absoulutely awesome soup - But I slow cooked it - the dry mustard makes the recipe!  Also used Amazing Taste beef marinade on meat for a few hours before pan fying and adding to slow cooker.  Also used all fresh vegetables.  Whole family loved this soup!

I have a wonderful cast iron dutch oven that I love to make soup in. I didn't use potatoes and used beef broth & veg broth in place of water.  Sauteed more veggies than called for. I had a 1/2 pound of stew meat & 1 lb of ground italian sausage. Browned the meat & added this to veggies. The only diced tomatoes I had were fire roasted.  Added that.  I used italian seasoning in place of basil & oregano.  S & P to taste.  Garlic powder & 2 bay leaves.  At the end I added 1 cup frozen corn and some  cooked small pasta.  Almost forgot.  I added some sugar to cut the acid taste of the tomatoes.  I know that this is not the exact way this recipe was written, but this is what I had on hand and that's what makes this recipe so good.  You can always improvize using what you have on hand and that's good for the budget too.

This recipe was not bad, just a basic hearty soup. It makes a TON, though, so I would probably cut the recipe in half next time.

excellent recipe. The flavor was spot on and my whole family loved it.  The only changes I made were that I substitued 1 12oz can of V8 for one of the cups of water, used only frozen corn and peas because that was what I had and added one can of drained kidney beans.  I will definitely make this again.  It makes a lot of soups, but I am excited about the leftovers. Thanks for such a comforting recipe.

This was great.  A great blend of flavor.  I only used a half pound of beef to make it more healthy.  We also like red potatoes (they taste better, and you don't have to peel them).  I was being lazy and didn't feel like cutting lots of veggies, so I used baby carrots.  We used frozen green beans, and it turned out really great.

Used 4c Beef Broth instead of water and cube, afer 5 hours found watery tasting so added 5 dashes of Worcester, 3/4c Barley and 3 more cups Beef broth to balance what the barley would soak up and what had already steamed off.  Used straight frozen peas instead of mixed frozen veggies.

Ate meat at 6 hour mark (my beef had been cut small and was ready for eating).  Family liked it very much- will definately make again. Husband wants to add some dashes of hot sauce next time.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this soup. I left out the celery and fresh carrots and just upped the amount of frozen vegetables. I threw everything into the crockpot and cooked it on low all day. It was the perfect consistency and very flavorful.

Yum!  My family devoured this soup, even my little ones.  I followed the advice from another review and left out the fresh veggies and just used a large bag of frozen mixed...turned out well.  I've made other veggie soups that were too thin or bland, but this one was perfect.

This was outstanding! So easy! I made this last week to take to my friend's elderly mom and it never made it - we ate it! I made another batch for her and dropped some off to my daughter - she requested more. Everytime I made it I had to add another 3 cups of beef broth, but that was fine, it just stretched it. You can really adapt this to your liking. Thanks!

This made enough soup to feed the whole family (7) with a bit left over.  I did add a can of V8 as another reviewer suggested. I had no oregano or basil, so used parsley, a bit of chopped cilantro,  and some garlic instead.  Came out great!

I made this recipe based on the other reviews.  I was very disappointed in the flavor.   Too much basil and oregano.  Not the vegetable soup I was hoping for at all. I won't make this again.

This turned out GREAT!

My changes
add 3 cloves of garlic crushed
2 tbs of woshtishire sauce
only 2 cups of water
1.5  cups of V8 juice
4 (instead of 3) beef bullion cubes

I didn't bother to cook for 6 hours and then 2 hours for the frozen veggies. I just threw it all in the morning.  Veggies are a little soft due to that. but.  I couldn't be home  to add the veggies in the last 2 hours.  I loved it.

Love this soup, it's delicious! I've made it several times, exactly as recipe prescribes, turns out perfectly and everyone in my family likes it. Excellent! Slow cooker recipes that don't require pre-cooking of the meat are my favorites.  My dad has diabetes so I am always looking for recipes that are filling, plenty of protein without too much starch or carbs. This soup is a perfect way to get a good balance of protein and vegetables.

I tried this recipe because I've always had good luck with recipes with high ratings on this website. However, this was an unfortunate exception. 

I found this soup to be exceptionally bland. I tried to "rescue" it by adding an additional can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes, but it didn't improve much. :(

Made this as written it turned out good not great.  I did add garlic, more salt and pepper and 3 bay leaves also 2 teaspoons sugar.  I used chicken broth instead and upped the amount.

We totally enjoyed this soup - I will be using this recipe all Winter long. I added more potatoes and I made it without the meat. I added left over pork roast and cheddar to my bowl. Instead  the frozen mixed vegetables, I added frozen corn and broccoli - and, a can of green beans. I added a bit more water because I added more veggies and 1 more bouillon cube. Good Stuff!

I agree that this soup is a little heavy on the beef.  I also found that during the cooking it lost a lot of liquid and I ended up adding more water and another beef bullion cube.  The only change I made was to add more frozen veggies, since I like a lot of them in the soup.  Next time I will make a few more changes: I will use probably only 1/2 pound of beef, 4 cups of beef broth instead of water and bullion, I will add only frozen corn and peas (the frozen carrots along with the sliced carrots made for a lot of orange), I'll probably add some fresh mushrooms, and I will omit the potatoes and serve over hot cooked egg noodles instead.  This is a good basic recipe, but probably most people will need to cater it a bit to their own tastes.

GREAT with a couple of additions/changes. 1) Didn't do water, used a whole carton of beef broth instead 2) added MORE veggies than written including some uncooked beans 3) added a lot more spice including chili flakes (as I like zee spice!), garlic powder, bit of cumin, parsley and a bay leaf. Soooo good!

I just made this on Thursday and today (Saturday) , my husband was asking me to make it again. I have a larger crock pot so I think I could even double this. Finally a great recipe for me to use up round steak.

Sorry but this soup was boring and tasteless.  Added garlic, salt, onion seasonings, parsley and whatever else I could find to give it a big boost.

Great tasty soup. Great for freezing the leftovers and having it later. But for vegetarians I have my own recipe.

I had a sirloin steak left over from the grill and was looking for a way to use it up. This worked beautifully. I cubed the steak, added a packet of Au Jus mix and water and let it simmer.  Meanwhile, I diced onions, celery and carrots and sauted in olive oil. When the veggies were soft, I added them to the beef mixture. I chopped three potatoes and added them as well. Then tossed in a cam of diced tomatoes, green beans and corn. Seasoned with basil and oregano and stirred in ketchup. Even my veggie-hating son ate it up!

4.5 stars!  This was great, I was searching for a veggie soup and this was a great find.  First soup I ever made and a big hit with my family.  I added another potato, and only used 1 onion as we are not big onion fans.  Very good still.  Next time maybe a bit more onion, a few more spices, perhaps the parsley and sugar that another reviewer mentioned.  Tomato juice as well instead of all that water, maybe beef broth?  Pretty excited to make this again!
