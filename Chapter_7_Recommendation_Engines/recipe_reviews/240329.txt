Very refreshing! I made this using a cranberry-pomegranate blend because that's what I had on hand. I was tempted to add more sparkling water since I didn't think 2oz would be enough to be noticeable, but it's perfect as is! Just a very nice, light fizz. The lime really kicks it up a notch too. Thanks for the fabulously simple and tasty recipe Jacqueline!

Really good. If your looking for a easier route just use cranberry juice and sprite or 7up.

Very familiar with this one.  It's a favorite for me to make for my pregnant friends and family members.  It looks like a cocktail, but since it is non alcoholic, it's perfectly safe for the wee ones.  They all enjoy it.  As do I.
