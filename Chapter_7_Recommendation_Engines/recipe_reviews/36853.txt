This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I cook it so much that I am afraid that we won't like it anymore.  Like some of the other reviewers I use cilantro or green onions to spice it up.  I also like to add some mushrooms and serve it over rice.  It is a great dish.

It was an excellent recipe after a couple of modifictations.  The liquid never thickened.  I added some flour to it to achieve the thickness, then I added the wine.  Everyone loved the flavor.  I will definitely make it again!!!

Ok, this was a winner. The only thing I did different is I lightly floured the cutlets after salt and peppering them. Browned 'em good. Added chicken stock (I was only making two so I used half). Then when I was sure the cutlets were done I removed them to the plate to keep warm. Added the wine and I REALLY reduced the broth wine mixture to well below 1/2, to a thick sauce. There isn't a lot, but the flavor is concentrated. I drizzled that over the cutlets and sprinkled the parsley and greens from scallions over the pork and the plain rice. Really nice. Very easy and pretty quick.

Hi, Henry Stollard here.  Dish is not ethnic Thai.  We call it Thai Pork because of the wonderfully pungent cilantro that is often found in Americanized Thai cuisine.  Also, sauce is really a thin reduction - not thickened.  Sorry for the erroneous description.

We liked this recipe... but as the other reviewers stated, it doesn't 'thicken'. I know alot of thai dishes don't' thicken' but it seemed like it needed to.  I would still prepare this again.

I used a bit less oil and butter, and ended up using a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken it....  The family wolfed it down!  I used cilantro on my serving, my husband used green onions instead.

I did not care for this recipe. The stated quantities don't work right, it doesn't reduce, you must use flour or corn starch, the pork is sliced much too thin to brown properly, etc. etc. etc.

I usually just use whatever wine I have around the house when I cook.  This time, it was a fruity variety - rather than the dry wine the recipe called for.  It turned out awesome.  The wine gave it a bit of a citrusy taste.  Really excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was just okay, I thought the wine taste was a bit too overpowering and I had to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I may try it again with less wine.

This was actually a terrific recipe! It was pretty easy and I loved the taste. I  reduced the amount of broth and wine after realizing how much "extra sauce" it would create if I used 1 cup of each. I may only use 1/2 cup of each next time. It's unfortunate that the recipe submitter named this dish "Thai" because it gives false expectations. This dish is not even remotely Thai. Beware.

I've made many pork loin dishes in the past and this by far has the beat flavor of all! Very, very good and I will most certainly make this dish again.

Yum Yum Yum.  I was really worried when I made this.  The sauce never did thickin up.  It condensed.  I added a liitle ground ginger and garlice powder.  This were very good.  My daughter who hates pork loved it. I used about 3/4 cup wine as others suggested.

THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DISHES, QUICK AND EASY.  I MAKE IT ALL THE TIME, IF I DON'T HAVE CILANTRO, IT'S ALSO GREAT WITH A FEW GREEN ONIONS (THE WHOLE THING)THINLY SLICED, AND SERVED OVER RICE. I'M SO GLAD I FOUND THIS ONE, THANKS FOR SHARING IT.

This dish turned out much tastier than I initially thought it would.  I used slightly thicker cuts of pork, lightly breaded with flour and egg, and added a crushed clover of garlic and a little lemon juice to the simmer sauce.  I did not reduce the amount of wine used and the sauce was very flavorful served over white rice.

This seemed kinda like a lot of work for what you got, I followed the recipe exactly and the "sauce" never thickened or became anything.  I still spooned over the pork loin chops but it kinda just made a mess.  Good flavor, but still not something I will make again.

Delicious! While heating the butter and oil, I threw in a few cloves of minced garlic. I also substituted cooking sherry for the dry white wine, as that's all we had. YUM! The sauce did thicken up just fine. I served the pork and sauce over soba noodles. It was fantastic! Good recipe!

Hmmm - I don't think this is really a "Thai" type food but it is easy to make and very good.  Like others, I too cut the white wine by half and added some green onions, minced garlic, and a small handful of fresh/sliced mushrooms.  ALSO - I did add a PINCH of dried rosemary & thyme while it was simmering.  By the end, the pork was very moist and flavorful! Thanks for the easy weeknight recipe Henry!

I followed the suggestions of the others -- used 1/2 cup white wine (instead of the 1 cup as written in recipe), and added fresh cilantro and scallions.  Came out pretty good.

i put this on top of rice noodles like some have suggested and it was just ok.  It was kind of lacking in flavor.  In the future, I think I'll make the pork and just use it as a meat dish and do something else on the side.

This was pretty good and I would make it again.  I made a mistake in not using real butter and fresh cilantro.  I used some healthy margarine stuff and frozen chopped cilantro.  The sauce was not thick enough for my liking, so I added a little bit of cornstarch at the end.

This was a very good recipe, my husband loved it. I sprinkled red pepper on top to give it a little kick, because it just needed "something"  I may try cooking this in the crock pot next time so the meat will be more tender

So tasty! It's become one of our favorite, quick dishes. Depending on the wine used, we sometimes add a bit more to increase the sauce.

Sometimes you make a dish and things happen that prevent you from cooking it correctly. Well, that happened and this dish turned out great. Here's what I did.
I seasoned and floured the pork and cooked it in the olive oil and butter. I took it out and kept it warn.
I added the chicken stock. two cloves of chopped garlic and some flour to the pan, mixed well and reduced. I added the wine, scraped the pan and mixed, then added the meat.
At that point I had an emergency so I turned off the heat and covered the pan.
When I was ready to eat most of the sauce was gone (thickened), and I served it over rice.
It was FABULOUS served over rice.
Next time I'll double the wine and stock so I'll have more "gravy."

I have made this in both small and large quantities (second was a luncheon for 40 served with rice pilaf) by following recipe to the letter. The consensus was "Fantastic" on each occassion. The flavor is so subtle and nice and the pork was tender and juicy. I have also made this using the other white meat and it was equally as good.

This was somewhat tasty, but not fantastic, I thought.
I did use a purchased chicken stock but I noticed that it includes vegetable stock in its ingredients. For the wine, I used an Idaho (!) Dry Riesling. (Coincidentally, after I bought it, I noticed its label mentioned that it paired with Thai dishes, among other things.)
The sauce didn't really thicken, but, reading the reviews after the fact, I saw that one reviewer, claiming to be the recipe creator, said that the "sauce is really a thin reduction - not thickened" - that seems more like the case. And, of course, the only thing "Thai" about the dish was one ingredient - the cilantro. I did think that the flavor was slightly better when I had half of it as reheated leftovers, though.

I found this receipt hard to follow, but ended up with my own version of it, which was just great! I think I went wrong with the Chicken stock, I used broth instead.

This recipe was okay.  As others suggested, I added 5 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a teaspoon of ground ginger, a bit of hot chile paste, reduced the wine, and added green onions.  I had some shallots so I tossed that in with the sauteed garlic.

Having said that, I don't know how much stock there is supposed to be but mine was like soup.  In order to reduce it by half as the recipes suggests meant I boiled it for a long time.  Next time, I would quickly cook the pork (I used tenderloin) and remove it from the pan.  Then reduce the stock by half.

Hey everyone, thanks for your tips on this recipe!
I altered it a bit:
I added ginger powder, garlic powder, fresh crushed garlic, 2 splashes of soy sauce, vegetagble broth instead of chicken, red wine instead of white, lrg chopped tomato, mushrooms -cooked more like a stew and served over whole wheat pasta. The basic resipe needed a little something else so I used my intuition along the way and it turned out great. My husband and 2 yr old gobbled it up!

This was a pretty good recipe.  Like others we put only half of the called for wine and I'm glad we did or the flavor would have overwhelmed everything else.  We served this over pasta and the sauce tasted very good but I still feel as though it is missing something that I can't quite put my finger on.  Will probably try this again because it was pretty tasty.

Great taste. Sauce is thin so I used a tad bit of flour to thicken. I used chicken instead of pork. Added some shallots, cilantro, and parsley. Marsala cooking wine since it's all I had.

This was delicious. I seasoned the pork with onion and garlic powder and I also lightly cover them with flour which helped to thicken the sauce. I will definitely make this again.

I made this last night and the family loved it. I did with with a pinot and it turned out  very good. I didn't have any issue reducing it down like some of the other reviews as you just got to patient with the reduction. I loved spooning it over the pork again and again as it reduced. Thanks!

I too used a thickening agent to get the sauce to thicken. Loved the flavors with a few substitutions like coconut water with a chicken cube instead of chicken stock then I added mushrooms into the sauce about 5 minutes before serving the meal which I served over a bed of grilled onions. Super Yummy. I omitted the butter and used 2 tsp of coconut oil instead of olive oil. This meal goes great with mashed potatoes as a side dish

So tasty. So easy. I did thicken the sauce some even though I read the review that said I didn't need to. I used a 4 lb loin and tripled the recipe - not sure that was necessary.

The pork was very tender, which I appreciated- but the dish was far too salty in my opinion.

I don't know anything about Thai food, but apparently from reading reviews it is something people seem to feel strongly about.  I think that the recipe was good, the flavor was different, and the pork came out tender.  I will make it again, and I won't say it is "Thai".
