This is a good, solid recipe.  It's not particularly attractive, and it's not so yummy that I'd make it all year round, but considering it's Passover and I had a cabbage in my fridge it was a good choice.  Only a couple notes about the instructions: I cooked in a 9x13 pan, but I think it would have worked better in an 11x7.  Also, the instructions say to cook until dark brown, then put in the oven until brown.  It was already brown when I put it in!  But it does in fact get MORE brown provided you didn't atomize your veggies instead of caramelizing them.  It took me more like 45 mins to caramelize the veggies as well.  In any case, overall it was a solid way to use up a cabbage during Passover.
