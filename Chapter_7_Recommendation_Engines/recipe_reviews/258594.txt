What a great meal- and it truly only uses one pan!  My daughter chose to eat her serving out of a bowl while I ate it in tortillas taco-style.  I did use an UN-drained can of pinto beans, 3/4 C medium salsa, and 1 cup of water instead of the 2 cups of water the recipe calls for- otherwise this would have been fairly bland.  Would definitely make again!

Super simple and on the dinner table in under 30 minutes!  I did think it needed a bit more flavor so I ended up sprinkling some taco seasoning in the mix. With that being said, I ended up using this as a filling for tacos and it worked great. You get your beef, rice, and beans all rolled into one. What I like most about Uncle Ben's rice is that the flavor is legit and it doesn't have that instant taste that other brands have.

Needed seasoning, but made for delicious taco salads!

Super easy, and quick. After reading the reviews I added garlic, fresh and powdered, onion powder, salt, pepper, a small dash of curry powder, and cumin powder. I added a small mildly hot pepper as well and we had a dinner full of flavor.  30 minutes and done and I barely heated up the kitchen.

This came together quickly and was very filling.  For me it was a little bland and in need of salt. My family thought it was great as it was. I would definitely make it again.

One of the great things about this recipe is that each family member can make it their own.  I had it on top of a crunchy green salad, added tomatoes and some salsa.  It is very mild, which my granddaughter appreciated.  Hubby added a bunch of hot sauce and salsa.   It is a very fast meal to prepare & re-heats well.  We had a little left over which was great wrapped in a flour tortilla for lunch the next day.
