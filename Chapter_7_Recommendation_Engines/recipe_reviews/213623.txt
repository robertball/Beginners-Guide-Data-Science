DELICIOUS! Absolutely loved this salad. I didn't have orange yogurt but had vanilla so I used 2 Activia vanilla yogurts and put in 1/2 tsp of orange flavoring in the yogurt instead, with NO mayo. It was really nice and very healthy. I used only a cup of brown rice as I wanted to enjoy more of the fruit.  We ate only this with some new "Fiber" Wheat Thins for a light dinner. The flavors were so complimentary and good for you. I wanted to take some to work tomorrow for lunch and see how the flavors blended together the next day but my husband finished it up. I think he liked it :-)  I told him to go ahead and finish it as it was so easy to make and I will make another batch in the next couple days. I also always have brown rice cooked and in the freezer in 1-2 cup bags so that is convenient. I always keep bags of cooked grains to use for different things like this so it is a breeze to make. ENJOY!

The mildness of the rice and dressing was the perfect backdrop to the tartness of the apples and cranberries, while the crunch of the pecans added just the right amount of added interest to the flavor of this recipe.

This was ok. It had a nice flavor, but there was just something a little weird about it.  Maybe I didn't like eating cold rice. It also makes a lot.

I have a difficult time getting my family to eat healthy and/or low-cal dishes (especially whole grains), but they absolutely love this recipe.

I had the ingredients but not exactly the right amounts, but threw it together anyway and it was yummy! I added an extra chopped-up pear and used chopped almonds. Mmm; great salad.

This sounded good, but I did not care for the finished product.  Should NOT have used the mayo.  Ick.  Should have just used more yogurt instead of the mayo.  And the texture of the brown rice was kind of odd.  If you've never been a fan of tapioca or rice puddings, don't try this.

This was a great, festive side dish for Christmas dinner. I would have liked a stronger orange flavor and will probably add some orange zest next time.

I really enjoyed this salad.  My 4 year old and 1 year old also enjoyed it too.  I chopped most of the ingredients pretty small to make it easier for my baby to eat, but other than that, followed the directions exactly.

So good! Super easy too. I used RiceSelect Texmati Brown (you know...in the clear plastic jars) cuz it's the best.
