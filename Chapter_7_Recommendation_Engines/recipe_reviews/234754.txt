I did not have whipping cream, I used cold whole milk instead. I made no other change. This cocktail is to. die. for.

I’ve giving his a generous 5-star rating.  It’s a sweet coconut drink that any coconut lover would enjoy.  It’s also great for those who do not care for a strong alcoholic beverage.  Personally, I found it too creamy and  too sweet.
