I followed this recipe as written in order to give it a fair review, with the exception of layering the ingredients like a traditional lasagna instead of bothering with the rolls.  It was a bit bland for my husband's and my tastes but it gets serious kudos because our toddler ate it.  We "rescued" the meal by adding garlic powder and decided that if I ever make it again, it'd be improved by adding onion, garlic, mushrooms and additional sauce.

As the previous reviewer mentioned, this was pretty bland as is (or it would have been). But it's easy enough to adjust, which is why I give it 4 stars. I added two cloves of garlic, but I'd add a third next time. I also added fresh basil to the filling, and I used fresh spinach, which I layered on top of the filling rather than mixing it in. I'd definitely make this again with these changes; hubby especially loved it.

I am so glad to see a tofu lasagna here.  I made something like this back in my poor college days.  I made my own sauce back then, so I'm sure it was much more "spicy".  In fact, I made the tofu from dried soy beans (9 cents a pound back then).  My MIL remembers this fondly saying she saw the tofu go in but would have sworn it was regular cheese lasagna.  I hadn't thought of adding spinach.  I'll have to give that a try.

My family found the original recipe far too salty - I cut down the amount of salt in the sauce to 1 tsp and it was a huge hit!  I also like to add pureed squash, sweet potato or finely chopped spinach to the sauce just to give it a little extra vegetables.  My picky eater doesn't even notice.  This one's a keeper!

This recipe is delicious. I used wheat lasagna noodles, and you couldn't even tell the difference. I also added a few spices into the cheese mixture and sprinkled on top of the rolls to add flavor. I used garlic & onion chunky tomato sauce, and it was so good. It makes A TON, so if you're cooking for two people, you'll definitely have leftovers. I'll definitely be making this again!
