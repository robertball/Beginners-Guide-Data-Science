Found romanesco at the farmer's market - wonderful stuff. The texture is similar to cauliflower, with a brighter taste. This is an excellent recipe, and simple, my only addition would be to toss in some pine nuts with the garlic and parboiled romanesco. And top with a favorite salt, makes a big difference.

Very easy to make and tasty to eat. I've done it with straight cauliflower and with a fancy "green" type of cauliflower I've forgotten the name for. Love them both, a LOT!

I received Romanesco in my CSA box, and prepared it just as directed in the recipe - oh, my!    This is not only delicious, it makes a beautiful presentation!  Adding a few slices of roasted red pepper and/or cooked crumbled bacon  would be great garnishes.

A dreamy way to serve your cauliflower. I suggest breaking the florets into small, bite-sized pieces. The butter and parsley don't mix well with the larger pieces. I added some hot peppers for some kick and it was still pretty darn good. Thank you for the recipe.
