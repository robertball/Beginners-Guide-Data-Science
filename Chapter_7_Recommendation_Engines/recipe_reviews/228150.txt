We liked this.  Had to use regular pizza dough because they didn't carry the artisan version. Regular pillsbury pizza dough worked fine. I also subbed chicken chorizo for the sausage and we added more sauce. Great week night dinner - just add a salad.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic! I used a breakfast Turkey sausage because that's what I had an added finely diced onions and peppers to it. Tasted exactly like any store brand supreme pizza, but better!
