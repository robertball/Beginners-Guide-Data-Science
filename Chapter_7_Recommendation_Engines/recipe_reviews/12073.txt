Very good.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I also used 8 oz each of the provolone & mozzarella cheeses, since that's the size package they came in.  1 1/2 cup sour cream equaled about a 16 oz container, and the 6 1/2 cups spaghetti sauce equaled about a regular (26-27 oz) size jar.  Leftovers were great, too.

The key to this recipe is the sour cream.  Whatever you do, don't leave it out and don't scrimp on it.  Though it's only one ingredient of many, one can really taste the sour cream aura and it enhances, not overwhelms the other ingredients. To boot, it provides a creaminess that would otherwise not be there. I did not have provolone cheese, so I substituted what I had on hand, which was a combination of cheddar cheese and Monteray jack cheese.

This is a great recipe. Very satisfying comfort food. I like to stir in a package of thawed frozen chopped spinach into the ground beef and sauce mixture after it simmers. That way I don't feel guilty about serving this with no vegetables on the side!

I scaled this recipe to 4 servings and used penne pasta.  I thought the amount of ground beef seemed pretty skimpy, so I increased it to 8 oz. for my scaled version.  Contrary to the information provided by the “most helpful” reviewer, there are 2 1/2 cups of pasta sauce in the Prego 24 oz. jar I used.  So, there is no way there are 6 1/2 cups in a 27-28 oz. jar.   And 16 oz. of sour cream is equal to 2 cups, not 1 1/2 cups.  This recipe was good and we enjoyed it.

I made this after doing an ingredient search when I needed to use up my sour cream and mozzerella, and I also added a stick of Pepperoni which added so much flavor to this already tasty dish.
I brought some to my sister in laws house, and she gave some to HER sister who had to have the recipe. My other sister in law said its a keeper and must be put in my regular meal plans...most importantly HUBBY loved it and gave it a "Good Job Babe" so I know its a keeper.
Try it with the pepperoni, you wont be disappointed! YUMMY dish !

Wow This was really good. My husband loved it. I had a lot of left overs so I brought them to work. Everyone at my job liked it. One of my coworkers said it reminded her of her grandmothers cooking. For how much this makes I think it is a really cheap meal if you need to feed a crowd. I fed 9 people and still had leftovers for the next day.

This turned out really good and it's a nice change from the usual pasta.  The only change I made was using sharp cheddar instead or provolone....because I didn't have provolone.  Turned out great, paired with a greed salad a wonderful meal.  And enough leftover for lunches too!  Thanks Lalena for the great recipe.

This was very good and an easy Sunday dish that goes into the rest of the week with leftovers.  I grated the onion into the meat and added about 4 cloves of garlic.  I used Classico onion and garlic sauce.  I used light sour cream and lower fat provolone and I used penne.  I will make this again and it is easy enough that I can hubby whip it up

This was a really good dish, my husband really loved it.  I made a few small changes though.  Because I am trying to watch my cheese intake, I substituted fat free ricotta cheese for the provolone, and it was awesome.  I think ricotta really adds to this dish.  Also, I used the advice of others and added some italian spices and some garlic to the sauce.  This will be a regular in my house.

I made this recipe and it turned out very tasty. I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef and white cheddar as I didn't have provolone. It was delish! Thanks, it's a keeper. I did make it the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight.

This was SO tasty!  Used penne pasta and 3 jars of Prego chunky vegetable type sauce.  Used 8 oz. package Provolone slices plus 2 slices out of a 2nd package to cover the pan.  Used the whole 2 c. sour cream to make it even easier.  Also, used the whole 8 oz. ball of Mozarella for the same reason.  (Don't have to measure that way--it's just me).  Added a tablespoon of oregano.  We LOVED this recipe!!!  I might add a 4th jar of Prego next time to make it even saucier and maybe a little salt.  Great, tasty, tasty, tasty recipe.  Thanks!

Turned out great! I used whole wheat penne pasta with a traditional marinara that I added some garlic and onion seasonings to. In addition to the chopped onion, I also chopped a fresh tomato to add in. I got a bag of Kraft Philadelphia Italian cheese mixture to add in with the parmesan. We made ours without the meat.

This was great, and just as great leftover. It makes a very large amount.  We took this to our friends who just had a baby, and there were lots of leftovers, even after seconds.  But since it's usually just my husband and I, next time I'm going to freeze half of the batch to have on hand for one of those nights when I don't feel like cooking.  I used mild italian sausage, which was perfect, and added a little green pepper.  Liked the sour cream...never would have guessed it wasn't ricotta.

Great recipe!  A little time consuming but worth it!  I used 1/2 lb of ground meat and about 3/4 lb of sweet italian sausage for added flavor.  I also used chopped onion, some minced onion, garlic powder and some italian seasonings.  I also mixed the sour cream in with the sauce instead of layering it.  Family loved it and I still have half the pan in the freezer!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm positive that the submitter meant six ounces of pasta sauce and not six and a half cups. I didn't want to use only part of a jar, so I used the whole jar of pasta sauce. Because I only had half the amount of sour cream called for, I used half sour cream and half cottage cheese. This was a good recipe to stretch on hand ingredients but I think it had a little too much cheese as it overpowered all the other ingredients.

Ooo, this was delish!  I used some leftover spaghetti sauce and substituted fontinella cheese for the provolone.  My only question about this is the cooking time.  Is it 30 minutes or like it says at the beginning...1 hour?

This is the best baked pasta dish I have ever made.  My family really loved it even my pickiest eater.  I will definetely make it again and again.  The only thing that I can think of that I might try adding to it next time is chopped green pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great for a single person, as it can be spliet into four servings: eat one, refrigerate as another meal and freeze two servings for the future.  And it always tastes better than the time before!  This 72 y.o. man appreciates it.  Thanks.  Matthew

This is our favorite pasta dish!!!  We have passed it on to our family and friends and everyone LOVES it.  We have lightened it up by substituting light or fat-free cheese and sour cream and substituting a sauteed veggie mix for the meat - Delicious!!

Very good dish and easier to make than lasagna. I used my own homemade pasta sauce on this but the sour cream is the secret ingredient, it changes the flavor. I thought I'd have plenty of leftovers but the entire pan was gone after I went back to get seconds

Made this Christmas week when family were visiting.  It was voted the best lasagna by everyone; and we eat lasagna often.  The children and adults all went back for seconds. I added mushrooms with the onions and used my favourite jars of pasta sauce. It was very easy to make and not too time-consuming.  You could also make ahead and re-heat when needed.  Would be good for pot-luck take-along. 
Made this again for Easter(6 Adults,6children) and again it was a great success; and again voted best lasagna ever.

I use ricotta instead of sour cream and cook the macaroni 2 minutes short of al dente so it doesn't come out of the oven too soft.

Excellent the first night and even better as leftovers.  I made it exactly according to the recipe, but I think the changes others have made with the cheese and maybe pepperoni would be good too.  A winner for us!

It's a good all in one meal. Not hard to put together. As all others did, I've made some changes just because I was using what I had. I turned out great! I've used cheddar instead or provolone and cottage cheese instead of sour cream. I think it's important not to cover the baking dish while baking so the extra liquid can evaporate.

I halved the recipe but used 1 lb of ground beef.  Delicious.  My pasta sauce had italian sausage in it which added great flavor.

I added green peppers in addition to the onion, and it really added some texture and flavor. My boyfriend loved this recipe- we will definitely be making it again.

This was an excellent and super easy dish to make. Perfect for company! I have made a couple of times and used hot italian sausage instead of ground beef for more flavor.

I really like this recipe for when I want a lasagna type recipe, but without as much work! I added a small can of tomato paste, Italian seasoning, garlic, salt and some water to my 24 oz jar of sauce. I didn't have provolone cheese, but just used mozzarella and Parmesan. I use penne noodles because my girls love them and this is a yummy dinner!

One of the best recipes I've ever made from allrecipes.com, & I'm my own worst critic!  I think the sour cream is key in giving it a great consistency. I swapped out the onion, and instead sauteed the following: 8 oz of sliced mushrooms, 4 sliced green onions, 4 minced cloves of garlic. Added them to 2 jars of basic Ragu sauce, came out great. As a relative novice, I used mostaccioli for my pasta, which took up too much room in the pan, so I couldn't use all of my pasta sauce. But it was great anyway.

This has become my "go-to recipe" for when I need to take a dinner to friends. It freezes so well and it makes so much that it leaves plenty of leftovers for another meal. Whenever any of my friends have a circumstance where they know I'll be bringing them a meal they get excited because they know they're going to get "Jenny's Pasta Bake" (as it is now known in my circle of friends)... I just wish I could take the credit for this wonderful recipe! My only suggestion would be to use a deep roasting pan or two average size casserole dishes as it does make a lot of food!

This is great!  The sour cream and provolone make this special.  Don't be afraid of the sour cream, it mixes with the other cheeses and makes for a wonderful flavor!!

This was a great recipe. I just need to know why do people skip this ingredient or add that ingredient. Then it’s not THIS recipe!! I made as is and it was delicious!  Once you make the recipe as is then you can change td ingredients if you want to. But don’t review it saying you changed ingredients. Then it’s not THIS recipe. It’s YOURS!!

Yummy.  Much easier version of a lasagne type dish.  I added some crushed red pepper flakes for a little zing.  We all enjoyed it.

Absolutely delicious.  The provolone gives it something a little different than regular baked ziti with ricotta.  I actually accidentally had smoked provolone on hand, which turned out really yummy.  Adding this to the rotation!!

Pretty good, and hearty! I used ground turkey, instead. I also used 8 oz. of cheese for the mozzarella and provolone. I added a green bell pepper and a red bell pepper. I also cooked the meat in olive oil and butter, then drained. I seasoned the meat with black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, and a little seasoning salt. Yummy!

Very good!  I used just 2 cheeses and forgot to layer in the sour cream.  Still was good!  We just put the sour cream on top.  This is a recipe that you can add lots of your favorites to or it was great as written.

This was really good! It tasted like lasagna.  I used bow-tie pasta, added garlic to the meat mixture and used shredded chedder, colby jack and Italian blend cheese since I didn't have provolone and it was fine. This would be great for a potluck.

This was very good.  Made it for a family from my church and my own as well, and everyone enjoyed it.  I wasn't so sure about the sour cream, but it came together nicely.  I added a little sausage, but only because I had it left over from a meal earlier in the week.

Delicious! I have made this several times now, and have only had rave reviews! I have found that I prefer to use lasagna noodles and make it more like the best lasagna anyone has ever had! I follow the recipe exactly, except I use 8oz of the cheeses because that is what they come in, and you can't have too much cheese in this! Thanks for the recipe, will make over and over again!

Great recipe, thank you!!  I use garlic-flavored spaghetti sauce (Wegman's brand) and it made it really flavorful and yummy!  I also probably had a teeny bit more cheese because I just used the whole packages, which were 8 ounces each.  Definitely a keeper!  Oh, and it also freezes well!!

I made this the other night and stuck exactly to the recipie. The entire family loved it and I've got a few hard-to-please eaters. I'm definitely going to make this again, although I do plan on trying with just mozzarella to cut down on the cost a little bit (provalone is on the pricy side). I may try some other variations, but as-written the recipie is definitely a keeper!

The provolone cheese is what makes this dish.  This is a dish that I would make again.  The only thing that I changed was the amount of tomato sauce. I used 6 cups and that was plenty.

WOW! MY FAMILY LOVED THIS VERY PLEASING TO THE EYE AN APPETITE PASTA DISH.  A NICE CHANGE FROM BARBEQUING ALL SUMMER.  I CUSTOMIZED IT FOR 10 PEOPLE IN ORDER TO HAVE LEFT-OVERS FROM THE 6 THAT WE WERE ENTERTAINING AND THERE WASN'T ANY.  I EVEN ADDED MORE PASTA THAN IT CALLED FOR AND  ADDED SLICED FARMER SAUSAGE WHICH HAD BEEN BARBEQUED.  EXCELLENT DISH, A REAL KEEPER AND WILL MAKE AGAIN ALONG WITH BAKED ZITA 11 FOR THE NEXT GROUP OF 12 I'M EXPECTING.

Best ever! Even my picky three-year-old loves it. Add the contents of two small italian sausage links to the beef, two cloves of minced garlic with the onions, a teaspoon of italian seasoning with the sauce, and some colby jack with the provolone cheese layer. Use penne pasta (or "stove pipes", as the picky kid calls them). Oh,and we only use one jar of sauce because we like the dish "dryer", and not "soupy"; the sour cream "clings to the pasta that way. Yum

Great recipe!!! I cut back the pasta a little and loaded up on the cheese! Using an 8 oz  pack of both cheeses, 12oz uncooked pasta, 2 24 oz jars of pasta sauce, 1lb beef, and 1 cup of sour cream. It made plenty for 6 adults served with salad and garlic bread.  By far my favorite cheesey tomato saucey pasta dish!

Made just a very small serving to see if I would like the addition of sour cream. I must say, it was positively revolting!! The sour cream gave it a tart taste like it had laid on the counter and spoiled. If I could give it zero stars I would.

Delicious. My whole family loved it. Cut recipe in half for four generous portions. Used penne pasta, ground turkey and reduced sour cream. Did not have provolone cheese,  so I used fresh Parmesan and mozzarella combined instead. Added garlic and Oregegano to the jar of marinara sauce. Baked 35 minutes.

Very yummy and easy. I used 2 cans of ragu, added fresh basil,parsley and garlic. I used a whole pack of Sargento provolone cheese (7.8 oz.) and an 8 oz. package of mozzarella cheese. I didn't measure the sour cream, just used a butter knife and smoothed a pretty thin layer on top of the sliced provolone. Only change I did make was putting the mozzarella on top. Baked for 40 minutes, then turned the broiler on low for just a few minutes to brown the mozzarella.

This is similiar how I make my lasagna and I always use sour cream instead of ricotta (don't like ricotta), but I also add Italian seasoning to my sour cream for added flavor.

The pasta should be taken out before al dente, if not when you're finished baking this dish, it will be too soft and overcooked. I also would substitute the sour cream for ricotta. Other than that, this is a good recipe.

This was a quick pasta to make. I didnt have the provolone cheese so instead I added Cheddar. The sour cream is really important. It brings out all the flavors!

Made this tonight it was a hit! I used a large jar of Ragu, 45 oz tomato garlic and onion flavor. Made according to directions, except mozzarella came in 8oz bag, so used an extra 2 oz on top. Delicious, will make again.

This was a delicious and easy meal to make and the family loved it!! I did add seasoning when cooking the meat and onion. I also enjoyed using 3 different kinds of pasta sauce for flavor.  I think next time I may add a layer of spinach, we shall see!!

This was as good as a non-vegetarian pasta dish gets. The quantities were perfect and cheeses blended lovely. The only waste was the parm which if added initially will burn and lose flavor after half an hour in the even. If I make it again I will add it 5 min before the time is up.

I wasn't sure how I was going to like baked pasta with sour cream but this was delicious! I was looking for something inexpensive and easy to make for a big family gathering and I found it. The only change I made was omitting the meat, I have a niece who is a vegetarian and wanted to do a trial run before I make a bunch of it for the family, it was excellent. Thanks for sharing!

We really enjoyed this dish. Usually I try to eat meals with more veggies. I did add a red pepper to the meat and used lean beef, lowfat sour cream and enriched pasta. Still not the most healthy pasta dish but everyone will love this! I agree with others that this makes a lot of pasta so you should use a deep dish. We had lots of wonderful leftovers. I'm considering adding spinach next time and perhaps reducing the amount of pasta or beef. Overall, great recipe!

Added some Italian sausage to give it a little more substance.  I made two 9X9 casseroles, giving one to a friend and freezing one for later.  We at the one I froze a couple of nights ago when we had unexpected company.  It was just delicious and prompted compliments.  Thanks for the nice recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, just scaled down since there was only two of us. I still have plenty of leftovers because its very filling. BUT SOOOOO yummy! I used a fire roasted tomato and garlic jarred sauce and sea shell pasta. The sour cream really does add a great flavor. I really liked this because most baked pasta recipes have ricotta cheese, which i cant stand. Will definitely make this again. Was very easy too!

I always make way too much pasta and in the past ended up throwing it away. I tried this recipe last night and my hubby said to rate this a 5 right after I put it in my recipe box.
What a great way to use up the pasta. Thanks Latena it is so good and the sour cream really does add to the flavor.

I was wanting something Italian with marinara sauce yet a little different than spaghetti or lasagna. Viola! This was it we all loved it and my family raved for days. I served it with onion cheese bread from this site. It's one of our new favorites. Thanks for a great recipe. Note: This is grade A stuff right here and my husband requests it weekly. What I do is while I'm browing the meat I season it really well with garlic salt, Mrs. Dash (herb and garlic), and Italian seasoning don't be worried that you are over seasoning b/c when you add in the sauce the flavor will infuse into the sauce(I use Hunt's sauce in a can 1. can of mushroom and 1. can of chunky vegetable) this is a staple at my house!!!!:)

I used a four cheese pasta sauce and added a little sausage.  Next time, I would probably use less sour cream and more mozzarella, and add a little Italian Seasoning.

Awesome recipe.  Used rotini because we had it.  Sauteed 1 bell pepper with the onions and threw in some garlic and italian seasonings towards the end.  Followed the advice about adding some diced tomatoes in place of some of the sauce, and used cheddar instead of mozzarella.  Still awesome!

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes. I actually use three cheese tortellini sometimes and will substitute italian sausage if I have it. I am a new mom who doesn't have as much time on my hands to cook as I used to. Since this dish freezes so well I make large portions of it so my husband can just grab it and reheat it for a good hot meal. It's excellent!

This is a great recipe for anyone. Easy to make, and always a hit. You can also omit the meat for a vegetarian dish and it tastes just as good.

When boiling the pasta, I undercook it by about 2 minutes so it doesn't overcook in the oven.

Great dish. Takes awhile to prepare and cook, but definitely worth it. I also found that if you substitute ground italian sausage instead of the ground beef, it adds a nice flavor. And for a chunkier result, substitute 3 1/4 cups of tomato pasta sauce for 3 1/4 cups diced tomatoes. Overall, one of the family favorites!

Everyone loves this recipe.  I have been asked to bring this to several potlucks.  Be sure to use a deep dish because this makes a huge casserole!  I also tried it with some cooked and crumbled italian sausage instead of the ground meat and it was excellent.  I am thinking of trying it meatless and maybe with some spinach.  It's fast and easy and tastes great!

This is way more than 8 servings.  I halved the recipe and still had 8 servings.  Very good.  I left out the meat and added basil to the top.

I put it on low in the crockpot, used two jars of kosher marinara sauce & onion powder in place of chopped onion & 1-1/2 pounds of beef. I know the submitter got confused by the serving size of her sauce jar. The jar label states it contains 6 (1/2 cup) servings of sauce, so to make 12 servings, you need two large jars. People at our fellowship devoured it. Thumbs up!

Fed this to my family of 6 and everyone loved it!  Used a jar of spaghetti sauce and one small can of tomato sauce.  Used what I had on-hand for sour cream...probably a cup.  Great recipe!

I've honestly barely cooked in my life, and did this within an hour. Turned out super super great. I just had a bit of trouble melting the cheese on top. My whole family LOVED it though.

It was really good. I did just use an entire 16oz sour cream and some bites were a bit overpowering. Next time I will measure according to directions.

This was very good.  The sour cream really changed it up and made it "different" than usual pasta bakes!  My family likes a little more "zing" so I might add some more seasonings next time.  Will make again!!

I made this with spaghetti, because it was the only pasta I had. Also changed the provolone to cheddar for the same reason. And it turned out excellent! Very very good, never want to have regular spaghetti again! It was creamy, cheesy, and perfect!

Kinda boring, but still okay just because you can't go to wrong with noodles, cheese and meat. 
Still, kinda blah for our tastes!

Wanted something easy and different, this was not it .Yes it was easy to make  but it lacked flavor, I added 3 garlic cloves and 2 tbl spoons of italian seasoning,mushrooms . I wanted to taste the sour cream but no avail. it just tasted like my regular cavitiny.

DELICIOUS!!! It was such an upgrade from my normal boring pasta.  Very hearty and caloric, so I can't have it too often, but this is certainly a keeper.  Can't wait to try it out for friends and fam.

I had some GB, provolone, & sour cream that I needed to get used up & this was just the ticket!!  I made a half a recipe, but used the whole lb of GB.  I just eye-balled the cheese & probably used a heck of a lot more than 1/2 :-)  DH really liked it too & he hates sour cream!!

This dish is seriously so great. I get a lot of recipes from this site and this is by far my boyfriend's favorite. I add garlic and a few other seasonings to the ground meat and this time I added pepperoni. Like others have said, don't leave out ANY sour cream. It really does make the dish! and SO many leftovers. Just make sure you have a big enough skillet to fit all the sauce. But I have zero complaints!

Found this when I was looking for a last minute recipe that called for ground beef.  It was so easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  The only changes I made were to add 1 tsp of minced garlic, 1 tsp of italian seasoning (the sauce I used wasn't that flavorful),  8 oz of sliced mozarella (because that is what I had on hand), and 8 oz of italian blend shredded cheese.  The sour cream is what definitely makes this recipe different.  I think next time I might add a can of italian diced tomatoes for more tomato flavor.  Also, I might divide it up amoung two dishes as my 9x13 was pretty full.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  For such simple ingredients, it really offers great flavor.  I used Ragu Garden Combination for the pasta sauce.  Everyone loved it and will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

In a word?  Yummy!  Of course I had Jack Cheese on hand and used it instead of the provolone, used my own red sauce rather than bottled but the whole concept was delicious!

Having made a few substitutions, this is a pretty good dish. I used Wacky Mac vegetable spirals, ground turkey-seasoned to taste, garlic and herb spaghetti sauce, and added a chopped zuke to the meat sauce. Since there is only 3 of us, I divided the recipe between two 8x8 pans. Definetly a plus, I can get 2 dinners from one batch. Im sure I will make this again.

I love this dish!! I followed the recipe exactly, only I added garlic, salt, pepper and oregano to the meat (to my taste). Turned out to be a good dinner. I served it with garlic bread and a salad. Nice dinner to have with some wine.

This was good, but it seemed something was missing.  I think that I will try making it with sausage instead of hambuger.  Red and green peppers would also taste good in this with some crushed red pepper to give it a kick.

This is fabulous.  I used 1/2 pound mild Italian sausage and 1/2 pound ground beef and my boyfriend LOVED it!  It's great for leftovers, too.

This is a great pasta dish.  I have made it several times.  It is great for company, I divided it into two smaller dishes and froze it before my second daughter was born, it just took about a day to thaw.  I was hesitant about using the sour cream, but it did add a great creaminess to the dish.  You can't beat a great pasta dish with a green salad and crusty bread for dinner!

This was very easy to make!  And I like the flavor the sour cream made as it stood out from lasagne.  I also added a layer of bacon (cooked) on top of the sour cream.  Using sliced provolone definitely makes spreading the sour cream easier (which is something else that I hate about lasagne - the layers never spread easily!).

I had lots of sauce left over, but that was no problem as I just froze what was leftover to use as spaghetti sauce in the future. 

My one problem is that there was a lot of liquid in the dish.  Maybe I didn't cook it long enough or maybe next time I'll try it with uncooked pasta.

Delicious!! I love making this on Sunday and having it for lunches at work for the rest of the week. So much easier to make than lasagna, but I've found that I can omit the meat and add veggies instead and it's just as tasty!

This was fantastic. I admit I was a little skeptical about the sour cream, but I plopped it in there(fat free), keeping my fingers crossed. I used ground chicken because we are trying to eat a little lighter and fat free mozzarella, also added a little minced garlic because garlic never hurts anything. This was just really really good. My husband loved it, too. Thank you for this recipe.  I can see myself making this one many times.

This is a great recipe.  Since it is just the 2 of us I scaled it down and I also tried to reduce the calories a bit by using 1/2 lb of ground beef and adding to it some sauteed portobellos.  And as much as we love cheese I decreased it a bit to save on some calories there.  I used sliced mozz. but didn't have provolone so I subbed some 2% Kraft shredded cheddar blend.I also used low fat sour cream.  Even with these changes it was still great.  You should definitely try this one.

Loved it!  I was craving something w/ a meaty, cheesy pasta sauce when I did the search.  We even used "no fat" sour cream and it still rocked.  In addition to the recipe, we sauted fresh garlic and sprinkled italian seasoning and black pepper into the sauce.  It makes a huge amount.  So expect leftovers for a day or two unless you're feeding 8+

This was really good - but exactly the same as "Baked Ziti I" - I've tried both, and they are identical in ingredients and flavour (don't know how that slipped by the allrecipes staff!).  Anway - it's good - the only thing I changed was to add more onion, another clove of garlic and I opted to sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the top of the dish before baking.

Wonderful!  I used rotini pasta and ground chicken instead of ground beef.  My husband and I both thought this was excellent.  There is plenty of sauce for dipping bread, too. Yum!

Delicious!! There is a restaurant in town that makes a Lasagna that I just crave, and this one has the same flavor. It must be the sour cream. Try this recipe. You will not be disappointed. (I did use a roaster that was 16" x 10", and it was filled about 3" high, so this is a big recipe.)

Delicious. I used ground turkey and plain tomato sauce and it was still good. Very kid-friendly. I'm sure it'd be even better with a well-seasoned pasta sauce. Pepperoni or spicy beef sausage might be a nice addition.

Made this once before and loved it. Whenever I make ground beef, or any meat for that matter, I use bell peppers. So I added one red bell pepper which adds a little more flavor to the sauce mixture.

I asked for the recipe after eating this & have never been disappointed.  Sometimes  adding cooked drained spinach.  Don't often do the meat.  

**For the person who finds  1 jar of sauce enough I am puzzled -- 1 cup is 8 oz. **

Comfy comfort food. I used what I had on hand--16 ounce bag of extra wide egg noodles, 1 jar of tomato sauce with basil, a 15 ounce can and an 8 can of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese instead of provolone, and some ricotta cheese mixed in with the sour cream. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written. As suggested by others, I mixed the noodles with the tomato sauce and I covered the pan with foil except for the last 10 minutes.

Really enjoyed this dish! Excellent flavor. I substituted the provolone for cheddar because that was what I had on hand.  This will be one of our favorites for sure. Thank you Lalena!

Being Italian this is the first time I never used ricotta cheese for a dish like this.  I had never used provolone or sour cream nor would I ever think of it.  There's always one child that would not like what I make for dinner.  I wouldn't tell anyone not even my husband what was in it.  THEY ALL LOVED IT!!!  I was so HAPPY!  The entire tray was gone. One of my twin daughters even came back for more.  My son said always make this on Sundays from now on.  I didn't change a thing to this recipe.  My husband said next time put some pepperoni in too.  This is a KEEPER!!!

This is excellent!  I make it exactly as described and don't feel like any substitutions are necessary.  This is my go-to dish to make for families (with new baby or just lost a loved one) as it freezes easily and still tastes fantastic.

easy and cheesy - good combination.  I actually made it with chicken instead of beef and need to dice the chicken into smaller pieces next time.  Recipe was tasty.

I'm giving this 5 stars.  I made the recipe close to the way it was submitted, except used muenster cheese for the provolone and added my usual Italian spices.  Chose to use rigatoni pasta noodles and a larger pan (15x11), it fit nicely in that size pan.  This will be made again!

I did not have provolone, so I used what I had--sharp cheddar.  Also, I had no meat on hand, so I left it out.  Even with these changes, the dish was still very good!  And EASY!!!  And quick!! Sour cream makes it!

This was fantastic!!! I used smoked ham Gouda  instead of provolone and it was a great substitute!!!! I highly recommend trying it! This recipe has become a staple at my house! For 2 people I changed the recipe to a quantity of 5 and it fit nicely in a standard baking pie pan!

I skipped the onion, sour cream & tomato paste. I used a jar of marinara sauce, 2 cups fresh spinach, ground turkey instead of beef, & cheddar instead of provolone. Did not cook the rotini, mixed everything together, except for the mozzarella. Covered and cooked as directed. Removed foil, and added mozzarella, cooked an additional 5 minutes.

I was looking for something kid friendly that was similar to spaghetti (because I can only eat spaghetti once a week for so long before going crazy) and this fit the bill.  The kids seemed to enjoy it and said that this is something I should make instead of lasagna.  Not sure I'll pass up on my lasagna for this but overall this was good.  I made a quick homemade sauce and used thin spaghetti for this recipe.  The kids liked the cheese in this and thought it was perfect.

This recipe was wonderful. I added in a little pepperoni with my ground beef as it was cooking and seasoned it with garlic powder as well. We had a lot left over and it was great for leftovers the next day, although I did add in some extra sauce and topped it with a little extra cheese.

I followed the recipe with two low cal substitutions recommended by other reviewers: ground turkey and ricotta (for provolone). Perhaps the original ingredients would have infused more flavor. My husband and I thought this was bland. The depth of flavor was similar to that of a frozen dinner. I won't make again.

This dish was delicious (to our pasta loving family) and was loved by everyone in the family! I used ground turkey instead of beef and no one noticed anything different. I will definitely be making this again for my family gatherings.

Wonderful meal!  I did add 1/2 tsp. garlic salt and 2 tsps. Italian seasoning to the sauce and a clove of garlic to the meat while it cooked.  Bake on a cookie sheet or it'll mess up your oven for about an hour or longer since it was only lukewarm after the 30 min.  This makes a ton!  Next time I will put Mozzarella on top for the last few minutes so it will look prettier.

OMG - This is the best ever.  I used 2 bottles of Marinara Ragu sause and added the usual (sugar, salt, pepper, oregano, basil and garlic).  
Probably a little extra of everything else (provalone, mozzerella and sour cream)and this was the bomb.  Will make and make and make again.............

I loved this recipe. Watch out it makes a lot of pasta. In the future I will add more ground, flavor(through seasonings), less pasta(I overcalculated how much I needed), and another layer of provolone cheese.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I only used mozzarella cheese, because that's what I had, I used rotini noodles, and 1 very large jar of pasta sauce (we do not like dry pasta).  I followed the directions for layering, except I put MORE mozzarella cheese on top and left off the parmesan cheese.  Then I baked for a little longer than 30 minutes, but it turned out really good, and heated up well for leftovers.  We will be making this again.

I loved this dish!  My family loved it and it's great as a leftover also.  I wondered about using six and a half cups of the pasta sauce but used exactly what the recipe called for.  It was perfect!

I used lean beef, lite sour cream, and just a jar of pasta sauce (which wasn't 6 cups) and it cut the calorie per serving substantially. It was fabulous. Love it.

I made this for the first time tonight. Made exactly as the recipe said. I used two cans of Hunt's sauce and it turned out amazing.  Everyone from a six year old to teenage kids to adults loved it. Will definitely make this again.

This was good, but not too flavorful.  Came together quickly, but needs more spices.  I added red pepper flakes and garlic salt, and garlic powder. A hearty dish.

This recipe is fantastic!  I used ground sausage instead of ground beef (be sure to drain the meat before adding the sauce) and it added tons of flavor.  I also added basil and garlic to the sauce.  Do NOT skip the sour cream or the provolone.  Those are the key ingredients here.  The best baked pasta dish I've ever made!  Freezes well too!

I made this dish EXACTLY as the recipe stated, and my family of four liked it very much!  I'll be making it next week for my Bunko group of 12 women (I had to test it on the family first, to be sure it was a hit).  It was! :)

I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8 x 8 dish.  We used ground chicken breast instead of beef and found it quite nice.  We plan to experiment with additional ingredients such as spinach or mushrooms.  I didn't bake for 60 minutes as shown on the recipe page. Just right for 2 people with leftovers for lunch!

This recipe is almost exactly the same as the Baked Ziti III  that I found on here a few years ago. The only difference is the amount of sauce; the other one uses two jars of pasta sauce. Other than that it's exactly the same. It's a great recipe - my kids love it!!

So I made this last night for my bf, brother, and bestfriend and they loved it and so did I!!! This recipe was so easy and so quick. The only thing I did differently is that I flavored the meat with salt, pepper, garlic powder and minced garlic.  I also added mushrooms.  I paired this with a nice green salad and garlic bread. I am so making this again! Omg I brought leftovers for lunch and I cannot wait to dig into it. I also had leftover meat sauce so I’m going to make another one and add sausage to the meat sauce.

I've made this several times and often bring it to families that have just had a baby. It makes a ton and is great as leftovers! I always add garlic and a can of Italian-style diced tomatoes. Also I don't add the parmesan cheese until it's already served.

Great recipe! I made this for my two boys who are very picky eaters, and it was a BIG hit. I was leery of the sour cream but I think thats what makes the dish so good. Make sure you don't leave it out. I did substitute monterey jack for the provolone since I didn't have any on hand.  It turned out great anyway. Thanks Lalena!

This is one of the best baked pasta dishes I've ever made. I never would have thought of sour cream, but it really made the difference. Only a few tweeks (mostly out of necessity), but the loved the results. Used ground turkey and added a clove of minced garlic with the meat/onion mixture. I only had one cup of sour cream on hand, but I think it was plenty. Had no provalone, so sub'd with shredded cheddar. Excellent! Can't wait for leftovers.

I made this dish for my fiance and I last night, and we absolutely loved it.  The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half (and we still have lots left over) and to substitute additional mozzarella for the provolone, as I didn't have any.  We loved the texture and flavor that was added by the sour cream.  The boy went back for seconds and enjoyed every bite.  We will definitely keep this in our rotation.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Very good. Followed exact recipe but did add about a 1/4 cup of the Tostitos Spinach Cheese Dip into it and reduced the provolone a little to compensate for the cheese in the dip. Wow, absolutely fantastic!! Just a little more veggies for the kiddos. Thanks for posting this, it's a new staple in our home!

Made this for dinner last night and it was a hit. I followed a recommendation and used a high quality tomato pasta sauce in the meat mixture. Very kid friendly and the leftovers were just as good as the first night. The only thing I might do next time is double the meat sauce.

I love this and it makes a ton if I don't want to do any grocery shopping for awhile! ... I don't usually buy Provolong cheese, so I test out different kinds of cheeses with this. I've tried sour cream & cream cheese filling, and riccotta and sour cream, both are great. ... Add a little Italian dressing for a leftover night and it gives it a little zing.  ;)

Really enjoyed this and very easy. I too used mozzarella only. Used some leftover homemade spaghetti sauce.  Added some chopped garlic and Italian seasoning to the ground beef saute.  Made a huge batch. Like an easy throw together lasagna without all the fuss.

Very easy to make and definitely a hearty meal and it took well to the changes I had to make to meet my nutritional requirements.  Only changes for me were whole wheat pasta shells, 2 - 26oz Hunt's no sugar added pasta sauce, and low/no fat everything and it still tastes great!   This has become a sort of, occasional weekend treat for me.   :-)

Everyone liked this.  It tasted a lot like my mom's lasagna recipe but was so much easier to make.  My mom says we can make this from now on :)  It does make a lot so make sure you have plenty of people eating.

This was absolutely delicious! I think the sour cream is what makes it stand out from everyday pasta and tomato sauce. I didn't have provolone cheese, so I used mozzarella slices instead. So a two cheese pasta instead of three, but still yummy! I could have eaten the entire pan if my stomach had room. Speaking of which this recipe makes A LOT, so there's enough for freezing or leftovers if you are a three person family, like us.

Wow! So simple, so good. The only changes I made was to substitute Italian sausage for ground beef and added a green bell pepper. Made this for a church dinner and my dish was scraped clean. Not a bit was left! Will certainly make again.

Followed directions exactly.  My family loved it.  Very tasty.  Great way to use up pasta.  I especially liked the combination of provolone and sour cream.

This was great. I, all of my 5 children, and my husband enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the original. I'm sure some better cook could add this or that, but it was great the way it was. I have been looking for something to be able to bring to friends when they need a dinner... This is it!!! Tasty and EASY - perfect!

Tried this and it was wonderful. Whole family said it was very good. The only thing was my 9x13 pan could have been bigger. But it worked out fine. I didn't change a thing. The sour cream was great.This is my first rating and I give it 5 stars.

This recipe is very good! Its family friendly, easy to make. I doubled the ingredients because I have a large family. It made a huge amount and it was so heavy I could hardly get it in and out of the oven! ITS A KEEPER.  (I used Penne Pasta and ground beef in my sauce).

I add ricotta above the first layer of sauce.  I also add a little more sauce than the recipe called for as it was drying out a little.  This is a great recipe though, and have used it to serve a large number of people numerous times.  Highly recommended.

This was great!  My whole family enjoyed it.  I even got them to eat it for leftovers two nights later.  A nice change from spaghetti, yet simple and easy to prepare.  I halfed the recipe tonight, as it makes a very large dish.

I loved this recipe!  I changed things a little just for my taste but they weren't major.  I used whole grain ziti pasta.  I didn't use any onion.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used 2 of the small jars of Prego meat flavored speghetti sauce, and I mixed mozzarella with cheddar cheese b/c I didn't have enough of the mozzarella.  I thought it was excellent and my boyfriend really liked it too.  Definitely a keeper!  And the person who said this made too much to fit in the dish must have done something off the recipe b/c mine was perfectly proportioned. :)

Great and tasty recipe.  I have tried this one and others like it.  I can never fit all the ingred, into a 9x13 pan.  I have to use a much larger pan, so it does not all spill over.

I made this exactly as written and it was fantastic.  I used Prego chunky vegetable sauce and the peppers and veggies in the sauce made the dish absolutely delicious.  Also the sour cream really does add to the flavor.  Makes alot of pasta but is so good my husband and i are fighting over the leftovers.

This was great!  My family enjoyed it thoroughly.  I did not have provolone on hand so I just added some more mozzarella and it worked out fine.  This recipe makes a very full 9 by 13 pan so lots of great leftovers.

This was just okay.  I was hoping for something more creamy with the sour cream.  It did have a nice taste.

My kids LOVED this recipe. I only used 1/2 pound organic pasta and I did substitute spaghetti sauce because that is what I had in my pantry. Everything else the same. Everyone even liked leftovers and I imagine this would freeze really well.

This is very good and filling...makes a lot!!  I had 2 left over jalapeno blue cheese burgers that I crumbled into my own spaghetti sauce..wow. I also used sharp cheddar since I was out of mozzarella...the combinations are endless...family and friends loved this recipe.  I served with herbed bread sticks and salad...so good.

YUM! This was really good. My Husband absolutley loved it! The sour cream is an awesome addition, and so is the provolone. I layered it exactly as stated, and it came out perfect! The only changes I made were that I used Italian Sausage instead of Ground Beef, and I also added in some Italian Seasonings and Garlic to the Sauce. I will be making this again!

I used this recipe when we went up to the mountains for some sledding and skiing.  It was totally delicious and comforting at the same time.  I made mine without the beef and substituted spinach.  Extremely easy to make and assemble.  I'm making it again for my daughter's 1st birthday.

We thought this was very good.  I made a few substitutions, I accidently used smoked provolone, (you couldn't tell the difference) and I only had about a half cup of sour cream so I blended that with some cream cheese and milk and used that in place of the sour cream layer. I also used mild italian sausage instead of ground beef.  It tasted similar to lasanga.

My family loved this, even my one year old and husband.  I didn't have any provolone in the house when I made it so I made it without the first time, and used cream cheese the second time.  Both times it tasted great.
Thanks for a great recipe - they ask for it now!

Yum! This was great.  Almost like lasagna, but a nice change up with the penne pasta and sour cream instead of cottage cheese.  As he ate the cold leftovers right out of the casserole dish, my husband said he felt like Tony Soprano, hehe. ;-)  My only suggestion: FOLLOW THE LAYERING INSTRUCTIONS!  I accidentally ended up with the mozzarella & parmesan cheeses on top, and I think it would have been much better if I'd done it right.  It was still good, but the mozzarella wasn't as "cheesy" as it could have been... in fact, it kinda hardened up.  So follow those instructions!  :)

This one is great!  My slight adjustments were:  adding a little red pepper and garlic, using 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 italian sausage, a little extra cheese, and then baked it in two 8 x 8 pans for 25 minutes.

Good, not great.  I made as written but decreased slightly the amount of each cheese.  It just seemed like SO MUCH!  I used shell pasta.  Tasted good, but not better than a good baked ziti, which is easier due to less ingedients.  I may try again using more flavorful cheeses (sharp cheddar, jack) for something different.  Does make a lot of servings!!

very yummy!  I added a bit more cheese, and didn't use all the pasta.  I halved the recipe and used a bread pan for extra height and it filled the whole thing!  It came out great!
