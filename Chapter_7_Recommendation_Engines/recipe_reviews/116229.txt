This was very good, but the spices were too bland. The next time I made them I used the same amount, except this time instead of fresh herbs I used dried. Same thing with the garlic, I used about 3 cloves the second time (we like our garlic, and could probably go a little more). After marinating the lamb chops were grilled they were absolutely delicious; very flavorful and savory. As for marinating time, 8 hours to overnight is WAY too long (they'll get tough). Even 4 hours is pushing it. What has worked the best for me is 30 minutes to 2 hours of marinating time (making sure to flip the bag over every now an then to ensure even marinating). I generally go about 1 hour. By then the lamb chops will have absorbed all the flavor it will take and the meat will still be tender. 15 minutes or so before cooking them, take the bag out of the fridge and let it rest before cooking. With those changes, this is an excellent recipe.

My husband and kids enjoyed this recipe.  My husband doesn't care for mint, so I replace the mint with rosemary.  I also added 1 tablespoon of olive oil to marinade.  This made enough for me to do 8 small chops.  Very good under the broiler.

GREAT recipe! Easy and yummy and different from anything else I found. I didn't find it in time for the 8 hours of marinating and only left it about 2-3 hours, and it still tasted great. I sub'd non-alcoholic, sparkling red grape juice for the wine b/c that's what I had... ENJOY! N

We loved, loved, loved this.  I let it marinate for about 4 hours.  My only change was to add a little sugar (to taste) to make them more carmelized when cooked.  I couldn't be happier.  Served it with the ginger cabbage salad (also on this site) and roasted mushrooms with basil.  Great, outstanding meal.

This is a good lamb recipe - there are others on the site that surpass it, including Lamb Chops with Balsamic Reduction (a stellar recipe), but for a quick BBQ marinade, it'll stay in my recipe box. I doubled the garlic as well as  the fresh mint and basil (making sure to crush each so the flavour would be released). With mashed potatoes and roasted carrots, this made a good meal.

This is with out a doubt the best marinade for lamb I have found. I used Loin Lamb chops with bone and grilled them on the grill. I cooked them until med rare, which is how my husband and I eat lamb. They were juicy, very tender and not a strong marinate taste at all. If you served these for company they would not know what you did, only that the were great. Kudos to the chef on this one. Thank you.

LOVED this! It was simple and easy and SOOOO good. I used the rosemary instead of basil, and that was all the change I made. Wow!

Super way to fix lamb!  Had a boneless lamb steaks which turned out wonderfully tender and juicy!  I added some extra garlic and freshly ground pepper otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I now have a new recipe for a quick, easy and elegant dinner for guests I want to impress.  Thanks so much!

Goodness these taste great! I used Rufus Stone 2008 shiraz (what i had around the house), much more fresh mint than recommended, regular soy sauce, supermarket garlic from a jar, dry basil from the cupboard and it still tasted FAB! The lamb was so tender, moist, and full of flavour. Topped off with mint jelly :) We've done this recipe twice in two weeks. A new fave!

I have never prepared lamb with this family of ingredients and wasn't sure we would like it. It is a very quick easy recipe but I agree that it is better to marinate it longer. I made it the night before and it was delicious - not too salty.

Awesome! Only ate Lamb on holidays before finding this recipe.  Now my husband, 4yr old and 3 yr old boys LOVE it.  Only change I made is that I added 1 teaspoon of ground ginger to the recipe.  This is now a weekly dish.

I marinated lamb steaks overnight and then slowly grilled them.  The flavour was so nice, definitely better than in some restaurants.  
I served the lamb with mashed potato, which was a good choice as you dont want to take away from the flavour of the lamb.

I used Thai basil and up the garlic a bit. Marinated chops for the suggested eight hours. Very tasty and tender.

Delicious!  Added some extra Garlic and Olive Oil but basically used the existing recipe.  Marinated for a few hours in Food Saver marinator and they were juicy :)

I've made this a couple of times using fresh herbs out of my garden! I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and mint jelly and either a salad or fresh green bean's.  It is wonderful! My favorite way to cook lamb chops!

This evening I decided to use this recipe to serve my husband a small appetizer of fresh lamb small loin chops. They were wonderful. Minor changes: I added some "Herbs De Provence" to the rub and didn't add the butter to save calories. I have to say these chops with the balsamic reduction were the best I've ever had the pleasure to taste.  The balsamic reduction was fantastique! Thank you.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. I cooked them medium rare (145 degrees) and they were perfect. Will definitely make these again. Simple and easy, perfected with mint jelly!

Very good marinade with items generally on hand.  I didn't get to marinade it as long as the recipe called for; however, I will try it again and then re-score if it blows me away.  However, I very solid recipe to stand by.

This was delicious. I made a few changes. I was only cooking for 2 so I sliced the recipe in half. I used 2 tbsp of red wine vinegar because I didn't have any red wine available. I added a bit more mint and 2 cloves of garlic instead of one.

I pretty much followed the recipe and found it to be blah...  There wasn't enought zing to cut the gamey taste of the lamb.  To save the meal I reduced balsamic vingar with a little black pepper and a couple of mint leaves to pour over the chops.  I would never use this recipe again.

I didn't love this recipe. The taste of the lamb really came out, but I didn't find the marinade added anything. Not as much flavour as I was hoping for.
