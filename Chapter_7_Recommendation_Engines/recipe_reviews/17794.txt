Hey Brenda, this was a really good and totally comforting soup! The only major thing I changed was eliminating the water and beef boullion and using low salt beef broth. After browning my beef and vegies I put everything into my crock pot. For those who mentioned that the meat was tough, the slow cooker seemed to be the answer. I always add more seasonings (garlic and onion powder) and I boiled my egg noodles in a separate sauce pan and then added them to the slow cooker at the very end. Hubby Drew and kid Ash (Ty was at dance) went nuts over this! Thanks Brenda for a very quick and satisfying meal!

Although I'm a trained professional baker, I love making soup and finding a great recipe to use as a jump off is key(I love making soup, but I'm still learning!).  I made this soup for a girlfriend who was recuperating from surgery, and needed something nourshing yet light, and very easy to reheat.  I played a bit with the recipe by seasoning the meat with seasoned salt, pepper celery salt, and onion powder before sauteeing(pat the meat dry first)with the onion and celery.  I also used 1 can of low salt beef broth in place of 2 cups of the water, and I added a can of drained beans(I used large white beans)along wiht the rest of the veggies and noodles.  I found that the salt is more controlled, and if the soup needs more salt or pepper, it can be added at the end of cooking.  This soup is so nourshing and she loved it.  My boyfriend, who was a very picky eater loved it too.  You may need to up the liquids, so buy 2 cans of low salt beef broth just in case.

This soup is delicious.  I sauteed everything up the night before and let it simmer in the crockpot the following day, adding the noodles at the end.  I think the egg noodles make this dish.  Even the husband liked it.  We've put it in the "keeper" pile of recipes.  I did up the amount of water - up to 7 cups - that seems to be about right for us.

Although the basic recipe itself was delicious I'm sure, I've never been able to not make a recipe my own.Being more of a "stoup" lover I used 1 1/2 C of beef broth and 2 1/2 C of water instead of the 5 3/4 C of water. I added 1/4 cup of flour into the meat mixture before I added liquid for a thicker consistancy. I also added approx a TBSP of onion powder and used  Ground Deer Meat instead of stew meat. And finally topped off the finished product with some french fried onions.Served with Grilled cheese. Delicious! :)

This recipe was super easy and great. I did it with a little over a cup of uncooked egg noodles, 3 cubes of beef bouillon and at least double the water that the recipe called for. The whole family loved it-there were no leftovers! It tasted like more work went in to it. A keeper! I used regular stew meat and I think I cooked it for an hour to soften it a bit more.

This was wonderful!  I've been looking for a beef noodle soup.  I used sirloin instead of stew meat and cooked it longer.  The steak was tender and the flavor of the soup was outstanding.  A keeper for my family.

I also used the beef broth instead of the water and bouillion.  I did add additional water and a packet of Liptons beef and mushroom soup mix as my family likes that mushroom taste.  I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the onion and celery and this soup mix was perfect!  Easy, Easy. Easy!  Will definately fix again!

I just made it again and added green beans and a little tomato powder!  Wow!  My family and friends just love this soup.  It's almost stew like.....

This was great!!  I had a beef shank for soup in the freezer, so I browned that and then put it with all the other ingredients except the noodle in a crock pot.  After a few hours I cut up the meat and put it and the noodles  back in the crock pot to finish up cooking.  The house smelled wonderful, but the best was how much my family loved this soup!!  I also cheated and used a bag of shredded carrots.  Thanks soooo much for this easy and delicious recipe!

Oh yum.  It is a whole 14 degrees here in Chicago and this was great.  I added the noodles during the last last 10 minutes(a little more than called for) & some peas, my husband pretty much ate 1/2 of it!  Thanks Brenda!

Very good soup. I too used a little more than a cup of uncooked egg noodles and used 4 beef buillion cubes.  Very good, quick and easy soup.  However, when I reheat the soup a few hours later, some of the noodles were very mushy. However, even with mushy noodles, it was still good.  Next time, I'll add them the last 10 minutes of cooking.

I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic with the beef, onion, celery and carrots. Added 1 can beef broth, 1 can diced tomatoes with juice, a few dashes Worcestershire, a few shakes of basil, the parsley, black pepper to taste, a bay leaf, 8 cups water, 3 Tbsp. Beef Bullion Granules and a splash of Balsamic Vinegar. Also threw in a bag of sliced button mushrooms and a bunch of green beans. Couldn't find the frozen egg noodles, so decided to go with frozen 4 Cheese Tortellini instead. Added a handful of Parm. WONDERFUL SOUP!

We loved this recipe. The only thing that I did differently was added minced onion w/ the stew meat when saute & added a few small red potatoes.  It turned out wonderful.

I have tried many recipes on this site and have had huge success.  This recipe was the exception.  I made it the way suggested.  I then took the meat out to season the meat (adding 
Worcestershire Sauce)...it STILL did not improve.  I DO NOT recommend this one.  It's a stinker.

Very good!!  We used regular egg noodles instead of frozen.  Simmered the soup for about 22 mins then added the noodles for the last 8.  Also added a splash of Worcestershire. Used 4 bouillon cubes and 11 1/2 cups water.  We both took some leftovers for lunch the next day and it was still delicious- the noodles were not soggy at all.  Also, a very quick and simple soup.  Perfect for a winter weeknight.

So good, but I'm on the Am Heart Assn Diet and can't have boullion, because of the super high sodium. This recipe is just as good with lowfat low sodium beef consumme, or lowfat/low sodium beef base. Also, add some mushrooms for extra flavor!

Very good! It needed a bit of work on the taste, however. A bay leaf improved the flavor. Also added about 1/4 tsp each dried marjoram and thyme and two cloves of finely minced garlic, which I sauteed toward the end of frying the onion, carrot and celery. Replaced the water with beef stock, thereby eliminating the need for bouillon cubes, which add too much salt and too-fake a taste. These changes represented big improvements to this basic recipe. Great comfort food!

I have a little hint you have to cook the meat longer or else it's really tough and add more water than it calls for it's pretty strong!!

I wasn't really in the mood for beef "stew" but I needed a recipe to use up some sirloin and what I had in the refrigerator instead of making a trip to the store. This came closest to the ingredients on hand. Instead of celery I had mushrooms and I used canned broth instead of granules and I made home made egg noodles. The result was a very satisfying soup! You do need to cook it longer than 30 minutes for the beef to get tender, depending on the cut. Unfortunately that means you end up with a more stew-like flavor instead of the fresh beefy taste it has when first simmering. So it is a trade off between the flavor or tenderizing the beef.

WOW!  This was awesome.  i only gave it 4 stars bc i made some changes that i think threw it over the top.   I sauteed onion and fresh garlic first (i omitted celery).  i tossed stew meat in a flour/ground pepper/onion powder mixture.  i fried meat in same pan on high until crisp covering formed.  I added everything (including raw carrots) in the crockpot and cooked all day.  I made homemade egg noodles (recipe from this site).  the family  loved it!  Thanks!

5 stars. Simple ingredients, classic flavor. Very HEARTY. I used fresh parsley, doubled the veggies (added 1 bag froz. mixed veg.)and noodles and added 2 extra cans chicken broth. I think you make any modification to this and it would turn out.

This was pretty good, but make certain you aren't pressed for time. The meat needed to cook longer & if you don't like hard carrots - I recommend steaming or otherwise partially cooking them first. This comes out a bit bland, so keep some salt or garlic salt on hand!

I made it like the recipe said, but the meat was really tough.  So I put it in the pressure cooker for half an hour and it turned out soooo good.  The meat practically melted in my mouth.  This is a definite keeper in my house.  :)

I used Caribou in place of the beef, so I simmered it a bit longer.  I also increased the amount of water as I found it a bit thick.  Other than that, it was a hit!  I served it with fresh multi-grain bread from my breadmaker (easy). This recipe is a keeper for a quick supper meal!

I used leftover roast from Autumn Roast (from this site), which had loads of flavor on it's own. I had some low sodium beef broth in the fridge so I used half that & half water (I added at least a cup extra), adding a couple of tsp of beef base. I am out of celery so I added a tsp or so of celery seed for flavor & I sauteed my onion in garlic infused olive oil. Dried parsley adds no flavor at all so I subbed crushed rosemary & used the parsley to garnish our bowls with. I also added steak seasoning salt & used dried egg noodles, adding them the last 10 minutes of cooking. I sliced up baby carrots & let them cook almost through before adding the noodles. Thsi was a great use for leftover roast...thanks Brenda!

Great comfort food.  I used dried egg noodles instead of frozen and you add them when there is 10 minutes left on the timer (the first time I made it I added the noodles and simmered for 30 minutes and the noodles were super mushy!).  This is an easy, no-fail dinner.

Gotta love beef noodle soup but there is no need to use pre-cooked or frozen noodles, nor is there a need to add them until the soup is finished simmering.  At that point remove the pot from heat, add dry noodles, cover and let stand ten minutes.  Noodles will be done but not mushy.  Simmer noodles for 30 minutes and you are guaranteed mushy noodles whether they were cooked ahead of time or not!

This recipe is very bland & requires changes, imo. I used beef broth instead of water, 2- 32 oz containers, still wasn't enough liquid so I added 2C. water & a T. beef bouillon granules. Next time I will add 3- 32 oz containers. I used fresh green beans instead of celery & sirloin steak instead of stew meat. Browned onions, carrots & beef, seasoned with seasoning salt & Italian seasoning then simmered for 15 mins. Then added non-frozen noodles & green beans & simmered another 15 mins. It was very bland. I think next time I'll either add Lipton soup mix or a bay leaf.

I thought this was great. I did use beef broth only because I like that better. I realized I was out of noodles so I made dumplings. It really has a good flavor.

Not a big fan of meat but this soup was very good and easy.  I cooked it for a couple of hours on low to tenderize the meat.  I added the noodles 10 minutes before serving.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  I added garlic while I was cooking the meat/onions/celery.  I didnt have any Beef Boul., so I used 2 packets of Onion Soup mix. I also added a bit more water & bought crinkle carrots already cut up at the store.  Great recipe for when you are in  a hurry too!!!  The meat was a bit tougher than I like but no big deal, perhaps cooking this in the crockpot would help that out.  I also used whole wheat noodles & it was perfect!!  THANX

This soup was very good. I didn't have any egg noodles but added 1/2 c. of dry alphabet noodles while cooking. I used leftover roast and potatoes from previous meal. I used more water than was called for and added 1 pkg. of onion soup mix powder. My family thought it was great.

My family loved trying a beef soup that didn't have potatoes in it. I doubled the recipe and cooked it in the crockpot for 7 1/2 hours on low, added 3 c. dry egg noodles and cooked it for 1/2 hour more. Turned out great. I didn't double the onion or the bouillon. Will make again soon.

Using bouillon made this soup way too salty. Next time I will use low sodium beef broth. The soup had a good flavor. It could use more vegetables. I used tenderized stew meat, browning it with the onion (no need to sauté the celery), and then cooking everything except the vegetables and noodles for an hour. Add vegetables and cook for 20 minutes then add the noodels and cook 10 more minutes. The meat came out very tender. Great  soup that is really easy to make.

Very good, but after browning, I simmered the beef, onion, celery in broth for one hour to tenderize the beef, then added the carrots for 30 mins then the noodles for 10 minutes - otherwise the carrots and noodles would have turned to mush.

This was a easy and delicous recipe. I used cubed beef that was on sale at the grocery store, and it turned out really tender and was very easty to pull apart at the end. I cooked the egg noodles and added them about a half hour before before serving. The noodles turned to mush after I froze and reheated the soup but otherwise a great recipe.

really good!  I increased all the veggies, used dried egg noodles and we used leftover prime rib from the holidays.  Next time I will go with low sodium broth to control the salt as the granules tend to be too salty for us.  Will stay in my recipe box!

Added 3 cans beef broth, 1/2 can water and un-cooked cut up stew meat to crockpot.  Added can drained corn.  Added more parsley, garlic powder and some dried basil.  Used 1/4 cup potato flakes to help thicken.  Will make again and experiment with spices.

Instead of using Bulion cubes or stock.. I don't like store bought., I just grade carrots and Zucchini, with celery and let those stew in a stock pot for 3-4 minutes in olive oil, follow with beef (cover it with salt and black pepper before browning to lock in the flavors. After meat browns, add water and a whole cleaned onion, more cut vegetables, potatoes, leaks, celary carrot. Cook everything until the meat is cooked through and all other ingredients are cooked to your liking. Egg noodles sound lovely, but my daughter is allergic to eggs so we will use another type of noodle.

My family really loved this recipe. We made a few small changes. I cooked everything the same, except I added some brown rice flour to thicken the soup. I didn't use any water or bouillon. I just added 1-2 cups of broth and made it more like a sauce. I cooked the noodles separately and poured the sauce over the noodles. They loved it!

I doubled this recipe and slow cooked it in my shiny new 7 quart slow cooker. I used Herb Ox sodium and MSG free bouillon, and then salted to taste with sea salt. This is the perfect method for those who complain about too little or too much taste. Soups can be very subjective so start with a base recipe and season to taste. I threw in two cans of drained peas, cooked the egg noodles separate and added them to the slow cooker the last hour. Very yummy, hit the spot with outside temps near 0° and a snow storm.

I made this one awhile ago and never got around to reviewing it.  I did think it was really good.  Whenever I make stew, or use stew meat in soup I normally dredge the meat in flour first, then brown it.  That usually helps the meat stay tender. Thanks for sharing!

I modified this recipe, using 2 cups diced, cooked beef roast and dry egg noodles instead of frozen. I also added 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and a 15 oz can of diced, stewed tomatoes. My family thought it was great!

This was an excellent soup even though I didn't use the stew meat.  I made this with diced left over roast beef, and instead of using bouillon and water I used low sodium beef broth.  I also used homemade noodles, but that is just a personal preference since I have spoled everyone with them.

I boiled the meat for an hour so that it would be tender.  Then I put everything in a crock pot.

I rated this soup on the ingredients as written, and we liked it very much. A very easy and quick soup to prepare. I don't see how some of these viewers can give a recipe a rating when they change the ingredients (they're rating their own recipe). Just saying....

Totally agreed with Linda McLean’s changes, with one minor comment.  Instead of pasta, this recipe screams for potatoes instead of pasta.  Will definitely be making again, but will add spuds to cook in the soup instead of noodles.  As an aside, I gave some of the soup, sans any carbohydrate, to a friend, who added some leftover cheese tortelini.  She loved it and has asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Brenda.

Good basic soup!  I added a little soy sauce and some spinach that I needed to use up.  I also used a cheap cut of beef that I had in the freezer, which surprisingly came out very tender.

Thank you, Brenda for this recipe!  I will admit that I changed it a lot, but I'm still giving it 5 stars...why?  Because it helped me make a very yummy beef soup (for the 1st time, I might add).  So for leading me to success in the kitchen, you get 5 stars from me!  I think there is real value in providing people a jumping-off point to then customize and create dishes that appeal to their particular circumstances, supplies, and tastes.   Reading the reviews and hearing what others have to say has helped me become a better cook--one of the many reasons I love this site!  Some of my changes were based on previous reviews, some were based on what I had on hand.  Hopefully reading what I did differenly will help someone else go their own way and also find culinary success.

Now for what I did differently: dredged the beef in flour and herbs (thyme, marjoram, rosemary, onion powder, garlic powder) and browned in oil.  Then added onions & garlic, then @ 6 cups of beef broth (2 cans low-sodium, 2 cups/cubes bouillon).  Added a bay leaf & let it cook for 45 minutes, then added a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  Brought back to a boil, then simmered until the beef was tender.  Had leftover cooked egg noodles in the fridge, so I just added them to each individual bowl (this way they don't get mushy when you store the soup).  

I know, it doesn't sound much like the original.  But without the original, my version wouldn't have happened.  So thanks again, Brenda!

I was looking for a quick beef soup recipe and this was perfect!  Everyone was very quiet at the dinner table so I knew they loved it too ;)  I have never even heard of frozen egg noodles so I used dry.  Thanks!

I made this for dinner tonight.  It is hardy enough to serve as a main dish.  My husband & I both liked it.  I used stir fry beef instead of stew meat because it is more tender.  Also, I added a small container of fresh mushrooms with the onions and celery.  I used regular egg noodles instead of frozen.

Followed recipe with the exception of seasoning meat with: seasoned salt, pepper, celery salt & onion powder before sauteeing with onion (no celery available). Used 2 cups beef broth instead of water. Added a can (rinsed) of mixed beans for healthy addition. Used dried noodles...Good, healthy, hearty meal.

I am the world's worst soup maker and I tried this tonight for the family and they loved it, and so did I.  It was easy and I used macaroni instead of noodles because that's what I had.  Also used combination of beef broth and beef boullion because when I put it in the crockpot, the macaroni took up most of the liquid, so I just added more and it was just as good.  Thank you so much, I can finally make soup.

I made this recipe the same day I got it in my e-mail...  I also changed a couple of things to suit my taste.. I sauteed my meat and veggies in extra virgin olive oil and after my veggies were cooked nearly done I added mushrooms and a can of drained water chestnuts.  I used 2 containers of beef broth and added 3 cubes of Knorr garlic and 3 cubes of Knorr cilantro to my soup...  I have a beautiful set of waterless cookware and it made short work of the toughness in the meat.... It was delicious and will be made again.  There are so many ways to adjust this soup to make it interesting and different.   I appreciate having it to play with and enjoy.  Thanks Brenda...

My kids and I liked this, but my husband wasn't a fan. I took the advice of others and used beef stock instead of water and added 1/4 t of thyme and marjoram as well as 1 bayleaf. After about 2 hours, I tasted and was worried it tasted a little bland so I added a packet of Lipton Onion soup mix. I'm glad I did, it really turned the soup around. I simmered for about 4-5 hours on the stove.

We really liked this!  Of course it's not a gourmet meal, but for a busy weeknight it's a great, flavorful lifesaver. Added a salad and some biscuits with honey, everyone scarfed it up! Used Knorr beef bouillon cubes, which added great flavor. Beef was tender, carrots were tender. It was delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I added some cubed potato & barley and used beef broth in addition to the water/bouillon cubes for more flavor. Anyway- I still thought this just enhhh... it was ok that night but I couldn't eat it for left overs at all, which normally I don't have any problem doing. I probably won't make this again. I think there are better beef soups out there for us personally.

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed the original recipe to the T and didn't think it had any flavor except a weird after taste.  My boyfriend enjoyed it so I made it again.  The second time I tried the suggestions to add flavor and it still was not very good.

This has become a staple in my repertoire.  Great comfort food during the cold months, and very easy.  I usually have to add more water or broth.  It smells wonderful while simmering on the stove!

Good recipe. I used beef broth instead of the water and bouillon and the soup ended up perfectly salted. I didn't have any frozen noodles on hand so I used dry egg noodles. I gave it a 4 only because it wasn't the best however it was very good and I'd make it again. Perhaps the frozen noodles would make it even better.

My husband LOVED this recipe.  We took servings for work-lunch, and the first words out of his mouth when he got home were 'five stars!'  I thought the recipe was tasty too, and I'll make it again.  I did substitute pre-cooked meatballs (quartered) for the stew beef because that's what I had on hand.  Very home-y and satisfying.  Quick too!

Thank you for this delicious soup recipe.The only change I made was I had some cooked noodles left over from the day before and just used those and it worked out perfect.Very good flavor to the soup and since it is so simple to prepare,I will definitely make this again!

This is a GREAT base recipe! I loved the simplicity..I wanted just regular old beef soup like my dad used to make that didnt have a ton of veggies in it Im not a fan of tomato based vegetable soup! I increased spices and  celery and added a cubed potato! Loved it!! You really cant go wrong with this recipe...

Didn't really care for this --- the noodles absorbed almost all of the bouillion so it became a dish of egg noodles mixed with stew meat. Left mine sitting on the table.

Really very good-I used plain egg noodles instead of the thicker frozen ones and added a can of tomato sauce and a little red wine. Just right on a cold winter day.

I made this last night and my husband absolutely loved it! I used 4 cans of beef broth instead of the boullion and water. And the other change I made was to slow cook my beef in the broth with the onion and celery to the point it was fork tender and I could easily shred it. I also used just plain old dry egg noodles. This is a keeper.

wow YUM. I used ground beef and omitted the carrots. i added some extra noodles so mine turned out to be more of a beef and noodles rather then a soup. Very good!

I made mine in a slow cooker on HIGH for 4.5 hours. The meat turned out perfectly. Added about 1/4-1/2 tsp celery seeds since we love the flavor but hate the vegetable. Boiled egg-free noodles on the stove and added separately to each individual portion (helps with our varied carb and caloric needs). Pretty bland recipe... Needs something...

This recipe has potential, I think, but as written it is lacking in the flavor department.  I even used my homemade beef broth in place of the water.

Delicious soup! I cooked the pasta separately and mix them right before I eat it so the noodles wouldn't go mushy. I added some barley and sauteed some mushrooms to throw in as well. Next time, I think I will play around with the seasoning more and add garlic to the mix. This is definitely a keeper!

Total comfort food! I used dry, no yolk dumpling noodles, 5 c. Emeril's Organic Beef Stock + 1 c. of his Veg. Stock in place of bouillon & water. Didn't have stewing beef, so I substituted some left over Roast Beef that I cooked in my crock pot & added the last 30 min. with the noodles. Hubby & I ate this for dinner with a grilled cheese on sourdough & tomatoes with left overs for lunch! Yum Yum! A keeper for sure.

Very tasy.  Added a little garlic and used beef broth; also used 1 Lb. bison stew meat instead of beef.  We love something green in our soups so added frozen lima beans(could also use green beans) and just a spoonful  of toamto base.  Cooked the noodles in a spearate pot in beef broth and ladled in bowls before adding soup.  This way noodles don't get mushy the next night.  We love soups, especially on snowy days; this is definitely now in the cookbook.

Ok recipe for the slow cooker....stew meat should be cooked slowly and at a low temperature, so I made this in the crock pot.  I doubled all the spices, added pepper and needed more when I served it.  Skim fat off top.

Delicious!  I used what we had, which was sirloin roast instead of stew beef, boullion cubes in place of granules, and dried egg noodles rather than frozen.  All else was the same.  The sirloin is a must next time too.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Tasty!  I might use a different kind of beef next time or even just leave it out all together.  Fine as is but can certainly add lots more veggies to your liking.

This was great...I added mushrooms to the meat mix.  I used carrot chips (extra added)  I also added minced garlic to the meat mix.  I did use egg noodles that I added 10 minutes before serving.  Next time I will take suggestions to use crock pot cause the aroma of the soup was great and would enjoy coming home from work on a cold day to this.

Wow this good!! My teenage son commented "wow this is flipping good!" the whole family really liked. I too used sirloin and simmered for about 1 hour and 1/2. I kept adding beef broth as it evaporated and used the wide Amish noodles. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the new soup recipe.

This was kind of bland, I added a dash of tabasco and that helped. I think this is a good starter recipe. I'll make it again sometime but next time, I'll add to it. Maybe more veggies, and a few more spices.

Was feeling under the weather and wanted a big bowl of comfort.  This soup hit the spot.  Was out of stew meat and substituted 1 pound browned ground beef.  I also thickened it a little with flour and juliened the carrots.  Very good even my picky 11 year old grandson loved it.

This recipe is all natural, Good for you! If you feel the need to spice it up, try adding 'fresh' herbs, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, oregano - use tenderloin, and make your own noodles if you want gourmet (that's what I did!) but don't say you threw in a can of this or a packet of that, chock full of preservatives and MSG then say it was better.... Just appreciate the fact that it's quick, easy and good for you, and leave it at that.

This is a great no-fuss recipe for any week night. This is not gourmet, so don't be disappointed by its simplicity. However, the flavors mix nicely and it fills your tummy. Which, as a mother of 3, I need on practice nights. I was able to substitute dry egg noodles without an issue. I just didn't cook long after I added them.

I made this for supper last night and the end result was ok.  I changed the recipe quite a bit though, so here is what I did:  I browned my stewing beef in some canola oil and once it was browned off, I put it in the slow cooker.  I sauteed my veggies in the same pan and then put them in the slow cooker as well.  I added 4 cups of beef broth, a package of onion soup mix and 3 cups of water.  I cooked this on high for 5 hours and then low for 1.5 hours and added the cooked egg noodles about a half hour before serving.  We felt as though this soup was ok, but was missing something, I just don't know what.

This is close to my Dad's favorite beef noodle soup except omit the carrots and omit the bouillion and add a large can of crushed or diced tomatoes.   We pressure cook the beef and skim the fat as well.

used 1/4 cup BV sauce instead of boullion.  Short on veggies so added frozen mixed veggies.  Added 1 clove minced garlic. cooked in slow cooker and added noodles at end.  Meat VERY good.  Odd flavor to broth perhaps from mixed veggies (beans)?

A basic recipe to get you started.  We spiced it up a little to our liking.  But, overall, not bad. I'd make it again.

I thought this was a great recipe.

I'm always looking for good soup recipes but my family is pretty picky so it's a hunt to find ones that will work for us.  This recipe was perfect because i could alter to fit our tastes.

I also took others' advice and added a cup more water, onion soup mix and 1/4 c. flour to thicken.

To saute beef and vegetables, I presumed I was to do so with a little olive oil?
How big are the cubes of beef to be? Mine were less than a half-inch.
I used low-sodium beef broth for part of the water and used a bouillon cube since I did not have granules.
My husband loved this soup, though I found the beef a little tough.
No mention in the directions was made about the brown "scum" that formed.  I took this off with moistened paper towels.
Considering how simple it is to make, this soup is surprisingly flavorful.

The soup was delicious and was so easy to make! It's perfect for a snowy, cold day dinner. I used unfrozen egg noodles and it turned out fine anyway. I also added a few dashes of garlic pepper and red pepper flakes for a zing!

This was very, very good! My little ones (5 & 7) even ate it and asked for a second bowl. It's a Keeper! I used my left-over chuck roast, as another poster had done but I did forgot the celery and it was wonderful anyway. The frozen egg noodles make all the difference in this soup though. It hits the mark with the subtile noodle taste it should have and the starch helps thicken the broth. I didn't use the granules either, only had beef bouillon cubes that I mixed with hot water in the pot before adding everything else. Can't wait to have this for lunch tomorrow, YUM!!!!

This was fantastic. I used 3 cans of beef broth and 1 can of water and cooked it in my crock pot on high for 4 hours. Hubby said it was a little salty, I didn't have that experience. I adjusted this recipe to accommodate 4 people. The next day it was even better....Kind of like beef tips and noodles. Will definitely make this again. One of my new all time favorites.

What a comforting soup! Not only was this SUPER flavorful, it was cheap to make, quick to prepare and allowed me to use up several items in my fridge / pantry! Although I'm sure this would be great as is, I did make a few (minor) changes. I recently purchased a Hormel brand refrigerated (fully cooked) beef roast au jus entree, so I used that instead of beef stew meat (FYI, my roast weighed in a 15 oz.). I also subbed Kluski noodles for frozen ones. My final change was to saute ALL of my veggies in a couple tablespoons of butter BEFORE adding everything else. I simmered my soup for about an hour, adding the noodles during the last 10 minutes (I always do this). Garlic butter crescent rolls complemented our soup nicely! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Brenda. My husband and I give this a well-deserved thumbs up! :-)

Amazingly simple and super delicious! The only changes I made was to add orzo pasta because I didn't have egg noodles on hand. Will definitely be making his again!

I used dry egg noodles. I would suggest simmering the meat and veggies for at least a half an hour before adding the noodles.

I did make a change to this recipe using half beef stock & half beef broth.  It was very good & even better the second day.  Your picture of the soup is what really drew my attention.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fairly bland, definitely needs more seasoning.  Used the crockpot idea and the meat was nice and tender.  Used regular egg noodles (cooked separately) because I couldn't find frozen.

This soup was very good with a few changes -- used 3 cans of low sodium beef broth instead of the water and bouillon.  Also added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Cooked on low in the crock pot for about 8 hours.  Added the noodles in the last hour.

Wonderful!  I used venison instead and salted/heavily peppered it while browning, along with adding garlic and dried minced onion.  Also used dehydrated carrots to the mix and used 6 c. water total.  After browning the meat I let it simmer in the crock pot for a few hours- fabulous!  Thanks for sharing! :)

This is a very easy and quick soup! It is good, although I did add some garlic, worsterchire sauce, and some thyme to it.  When I sauteed the onions I added the fresh garlic.  I will use smaller noodles next time, kids prefer smaller noodle.  Will make again!

This was wonderful for a 10 degree day in PA. Used beef chuck cubes cut very small, sauteed everything including the carrots. Added some garlic, and onion and garlic powder to the meat. Added a can of golden onion soup and then a carton of beef broth and about 3 cups of water, 5 boullion cubes.. Simmered for a couple hours, and then added noodles. Lost all the broth and turned it into a stoup/ stew. This has always been my problem with soup. I add noodles and it dries up, tried to cook ahead, add more, it never works.  But it was more of  stew consistency.Needless to say it was WONDERFUL  and everypone loved it. Better the  next day for lunch. A hearty meal for winter. Carrots and celery really add flavor. LOVE IT!!!

I gave this a five star based on ease of preparation, cost and taste. I did cook the pasta in a separate pot as I was afraid it would soak up too much of the broth. I used bouillon as the recipe called for and it was very good. I would definitely make this a regular item on my dinner menu.

Yummo! We made a 1/2 batch, since I only had .5lb of leftover beef roast. I sauteed the veggies in garlic, then cooked them with yhechopped beef, 1 can condensed french onion soup, 3 cans water, and 2 beef buillion cubes. Fam LOVED it (which is saying a lot; my kiddos arent big soup eaters).

After all the glowing reviews, I was really disappointed this this recipe. We found it seriously lacking in flavor!  The noodles were the only thing that gave this dish any personality. Not sure if we'll make this again.

This was so simple to make.  I used fondue meats pieces, as they are smaller and I find them to be more tender.  Then I added some canned mushrooms for flavor.  Added frozen peas for some color too.  It seemed a bit bland while simmering, so I added more pepper, a bit of basil, and some sea salt.  It turned out very good!!!

Wonderful! I used the beef broth instead of boullion, as suggested by others. For the beef, I used left over beef roast from the previous night's dinner. Easy meal - and great with a salad & french bread.

Awesome! My husband said Awesome at least three times and he wasn,t sucking up or anything. My kids scarfed it up. Just a lovely, filling, hearty soup Added more water at the end and a packet of brown gravy mix to replace what had boil away and what the noodles soaked up but everything else the same. Delicious and thanks for the new winter fav in our house!

Great easy recipe.  I used bag extra fine egg noodles that I cooked and added at the end.  Hubby and I were stuffed, kids were so so with it, but my littlest one is VERY picky.

This was definitely a keeper!!  I used my chewy homemade noodles instead of egg noodles, and I added some other frozen veggies as well.  It was a bit salty, so I added a raw potato, and I'm hoping that fixes it.  It was great!!

This delicious soup is great for a base to which one can add any sort of good vegetables. I call it "Ever Lasting Soup"..when I first made it I added dry linguine..too much..so I just kept adding and adding-Italian diced tomatoes, cooked baby limas, cooked kidney beans-chopped cabbage is also great. Thanks so such a great basic beef soup!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I made a couple changes-I substituted chicken broth for water and added beef boullion for flavor as 1/4 cup was too much sodium for me and my family.  I also couldn't find frozen egg noodles- so I cooked them separately and added them to each person's bowl.  That way they didn't overcook.  Leftovers were great too.

Good, although rather salty.  This was my first time using a pre-made egg noodle, and I think that I will go back to making my own and try this recipe again.  I also will make my own broth instead of using bouillon, which probably strongly contributed to the salty flavor.

We loved this one!  So easy, so tasty.  I used "Better than Bouillon" beef soup base instead of the bouillon granules, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I'd never tried the frozen egg noodles (and my husband had a hard time finding them at the grocery store) but they were wonderful.

This one was added to my recipe box!

this is a good soup, but you need to season the beef when sauteing it before you add it to the rest of the soup. Also I used fresh parsley, basil, & a small amount of fresh rosemary.

I made this for a crowd of 60.  Everyone loved it!  I used hamburger instead of stew meat to save money.  In addition added more boullion granules for a beef-ier broth.  Wonderful!

After the last taste test this dish still needed something.  I added some garlic powder and 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes.  It was better, but still not my favorite.

Good, solid recipe. Nothing fancy but nothing fancy was promised. This is a keeper. You can up the water, up the veggies, etc. and still be happy with it. When I use a little too much bouillion I place some sliced potatoes in to soak up the salt and then discard them. Noodles go in at the end of the cooking. Great comfort food!

This is a very easy and simple soup with great flavour. The broth you use determines how your soup will taste, so use a good quality broth. I used Knorr beef bouillon gel and a Knorr mushroom boullion cubes. The flavour was great and kid approved!

It was delicious and easy.  Great flavor.  I did add 1 can of beef broth because that's all I had.  I browned the beef and veggies than put it in a crock pot.  I cooked the noodles separate then added them about 15 minutes before we were ready to eat.

I made this tonight and followed another's  review and added marianka, garlic,  thyme and bay leaf. I did not have beef broth and had to use beef bullion base. I tripled this recipe and also used sirloin steak.  I also sprinkled onion and garlic  powder and seasoned pepper from Lawry's on the meat before browning it. This is the first beef soup I have  made that came out awesome and I have attempted many!  Thank  you  Brenda for a base recipe and thank you reviewer for the added advice  with using some extra herbs. This recipe is a keeper for my household.

I used 2 Lipton onion soup mix packets, 1 box beef broth, 2 1/2 cups water, 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp garlic (jar), pinch black pepper, 1 bag noodles.  Very good!

The children love chicken noodle soup, so I thought they might like this soup too, and they did.
I made some changes to use what was available in the fridge. I used bone in lamb pieces that I wrapped in a big piece of cheese clothe to make it easy to fish out of the soup to debone later. I put everything in the slow cooker except the noodles. I added 1 chopped  clove of garlic and 1 bay leaf to make the broth more flavorful. I  cooked on low for 8 hours. 
I deboned and shredded the lamb and put back with the noodles that I cooked separately on the stove and drained. I kept the soup in the slow cooker another 30 minutes, then added some chopped fresh parsley.

Definitely worth trying. I also used the crockpot method (sauteeing the meat and veges together the night before) and I used dried egg noodles at the very end instead of frozen egg noodles.

I found it to be in need of some help.  First the recipe was too salty.  I added a clove of minced garlic, substituted the water with beef broth, plus one teaspoon beef base, one can mushrooms, one teaspoon Herb de Provence, 1/4 cup Marsala wine, and used dry egg noodles.  I cooked the beef in the broth for 2 hours on simmer, after browning.  I then finished the recipe.  It turned out great.

Good as a base recipe, but definitely needs more flavor. Added minced garlic, bay leaf and peppercorns, but it's still lacking something. Perhaps a bigger variety of sauteed veggies? Will play with it again, modifying as I go.

EXCELLENT! I sprinkled flour on the meat after browning to thicken. Then I added 2 cans beef broth & 1 can of water w/ spices & cooked 25 mins in a pressure cooker.  Then I added dry egg noodles (No Yolks) at the end, cooking until soft.  Very flavorful & tender! Even my picky boys loved it, which hardly ever happens. One of my favorite recipes from this site!!

I found this pretty bland. I did use the low-sodium beef broth as suggested by other reviewers and quite a few spices. I was just kind of under-whelmed, and was hoping it would be more savory or flavorful.

This was great although I eliminated the flour and water to thicken.  I like a broth soup and added celery salt and used frozen egg noodles, but loved it!!!  I also used a package of onion soup instead of boullion

I added 1 can of beef broth and 6 cubes of bouillon.  Also added dry egg noddles the last 10 minutes of cooking.  The egg noodles really soaked up the beef taste.  So yummy!  My husband, who isn't a soup eater, requests this recipe on a weekly basis now.  Picky eaters love it!

Very good! Added some fresh mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, which gave it a lovely flavor. I did use beef broth in place of the water and added more than called for, but just because I was looking for a 'soupier' soup. Thanks! :)

This was simple enough to make, however it was bland and took a lot of seasoning to try to add flavor.  Also, noodles almost need to be kept separate and just pour soup over because even though I added mine close to end they still fell apart after a while.  Don't think I'll be making again.

With a family of 6, it is hard to please everyone.  But this recipe did the trick!!  Even my picky teenage son ate it.  I did add more water like others suggested (used 7 cups of water with 3 cubes).  But didn't change anything else.  This one is going into the recipe box for sure!  thanks for sharing.

This was a very yummy soup, although I think it was missing a spice to make it to that 5 star rating.  It was missing something we couldn't put our finger on.  I cooked it all day in the slow cooker and added the noodles at then end.  My entire family enjoyed it - I served it with french bread and fresh grapes on the side.

Great soup but I made a few modifications. I used meatballs (ground beef, egg, parsley, bread crumbs) instead of stewing beef; added some worcestershire; reduced the water by about a cup and added a can of beef broth, eliminating the bouillon.  Super easy and very yummy.

I thought this was very good. It tasted a lot like a French Dip. I used leftover steak instead of stew meat. I boiled the noodles in a seperate pan, then added them at the end. Definetly will make again!

My husband really liked this soup, and I make a lot of soups.  Make sure your stew meat is small enough.  I left mine the size that the grocery store cut it, and it was too big.

I made this to use up some raw stew meat I had to cook. It was surprisingly good for something so easy to throw together. I just used regular egg noodles that I boiled separately, so it's probably even better with the frozen noodles the recipe calls for. I added some red pepper flakes when serving it.

Yummy!  I put all ingredients except the egg noodles in the slow cooker for about 6 hours and the meat was soooo tender and the flavors melded perfectly.  Adding egg noodles at the end of cooking helped keep them firm.  The egg noodles also made this enticing for our two little ones.  This one's a keeper!

I used low sodium beef broth from the can instead of the granules plus water.  Maybe that was where I went wrong.  I also slow-cooked this, but that should have helped the flavors meld.  It was not that exciting to my husband and me.

Great flavor, easy to make. What more could one ask for for a great weeknight meal? I used a large can of broth and cooked everything in the crockpot. Everyone loved it!

Loved this recipe.  Used canned beef broth and dry egg noodles.  My son loved it (who is very picky).  Good and filling. I also used a roast for the meet that was left over so it was nice and tender.  Very good.

I really didn't care for this it tasted like bouillion.  I think broth would have been much better.  My husband didn't mind the soup, but my baby loved it.
