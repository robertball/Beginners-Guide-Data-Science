These turned out pretty good except they needed a lot more cooking time than directed. My husband doesn't like breakfast sausage due to all of the sage and these were so mild that he said they were the best sausage patties he had ever had. In my opinion, the spices need doubled if you want  that true breakfast sausage flavor. Overall a good recipe and one I will make again with some additions.
