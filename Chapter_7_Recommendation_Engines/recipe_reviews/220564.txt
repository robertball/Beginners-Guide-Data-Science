We use to make this in High School in a cooler with a pouring spout. (About 25 years ago). However, you would have to double the recipe for that size container. One tip, nix the Lemon-Lime soda for Lemon-Lime ice cream.  You'll thank me later, but be sure to burn off those extra calories with a late afternoon jog the next day.

This was good and made a lot, but was not quite sweet enough for our taste.  Next time I will add a bit of juice or sugar to it.  Thanks for the recipe!
