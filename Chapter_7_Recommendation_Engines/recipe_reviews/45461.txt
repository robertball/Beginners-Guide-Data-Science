Good chowder!  I did make a few changes.  Sauteed the onions & celery together.  Added a couple spoonfuls (no, didn't measure!) of flour to the onion/celery/butter mixture to make more of a roux, then added broth, milk, carrots, potatos.  Also added marojam, oregano, basil, thyme, parsley, dash of paprika, and a bay leaf.  Let the potatos and carrots cook for longer (we like softer).  We really enjoyed!

THIS WAS EXCELLENT!!  I bought some catfish nuggets on sale and didn't know what the heck to do with them. Then I saw this recipe and gave it a try. I had some LEFTOVER Shrimp and Corn and threw that in to bulk it up. This is so versitile I will definitly keep this one handy. Thanks Kathy!!

My husband told me to give this recipe five stars! I followed the recipe exactly except for a couple of substitutions: instead of milk (I was out) I used a mixture of heavy cream and water (2 parts water, three parts heavy cream), instead of chicken broth (I was out of that too) I mixed some water and chicken flavored Top Ramen mix together and it turned out great. I used extra sharp, aged cheddar cheese which gave it a nice flavor. I also added a pinch of Tony's Cajun seasoning and topped the whole thing off with paprika. Really delicious, especially if you have some extra catfish and don't know what to do with it.

I didn't really think I'd like catfish, but this was really great!  The kids liked it, too!  Next time I'll add some more herbs and the corn, as someone else suggested.

Great soup!  Everyone enjoyed it.  I made some changes that were suggested and some of my own.  I used skim milk and I saut√©ed the onions & celery together as suggested by others.  We also cooked the vegetables longer too. The big change I made that I think made my soup absolutely delicious was I used Cajun seasoned catfish. The flavor permeated the soup and it was AWESOME.  Now, of course, you must like Cajun flavors.  It was not real strong, but it was wonderful.  We all enjoyed it.

This was okay.  It tasted a little weird, but I think it's because my catfish was not the freshest.  I threw out the catfish and mixed in drained canned salmon, which tasted much better.  Next time, I'll use imitation crab meat.

This recipe is so simple and delicious.. I followed the recipe's instructions ALMOST exactly (I decided to use a 1/2 tsp of salt instead of celery salt), and it turned out great! The only thing I'd do differently next time is to add more cheese though. Other than that, my family and friends loved it!

Sooo good! I made lots of changes, but tried the base recipe and it was very good! It definitely needed some seasoning, I used cajun seasoning and Old Bay and oregano. I didn't have enough fish (used tilapia) so I supplemented some shrimp. Added some crumbled turkey bacon to the top. Yummmm!

This was just okay as far as fish chowders go. I have another recipe from this site that I like better, but I wanted to try this one because of the cheese. It wasn't bad, just not good enough to make again.

I only had about 3/4 lb catfish and I felt it was plenty.  I very nice chowder recipe.  Not too heavy.  I might try adding some corn next time or maybe a bit of curry.  Update.   Made this again, actually forgot I had made it before until  went to review!  Used 1/2 tsp curry and it was lovely.  Also left out the water and used two packets of boulion with 1 c water.  Only used 1/4 c regular flour.

I didn't really like this. I guess I just don't like fish in soup, personal preference. Also, the milk I used separated and it sort of looked like gruel. I had some catfish to use up and didn't want to make fried catfish, but thanks for letting me try something different.

Very nice. I agree with another cook that suggested a dash of curry. It made the dish. I also added garlic, bay leaf, parsley, hot sauce and paprika. This recipe will be a good base for other seafoods or meat.

Wow. Just, wow. I've never eaten fish soups. I'm pretty particular about my fish and am always fearful of "fishy" fish, in smell or taste, thus the idea of fish in a chowder made me very nervous. I don't even like clam chowder! But, I wanted to do something different with the catfish in the freezer so I thought I'd give this a try. Boy, am I glad I did!! It was so delicious! I cooked it exactly as is, only adding a pinch or so of garlic powder (I can't help it..). Then, when I poured it into the bowls to serve, I added a dash of dried parsley and a sprinkle of creole seasoning (based on another review). Perfection! Interestingly, I couldn't taste the fish at all! Just cheesy, creamy, potato-y, yumminess. Thanks! (Next time I'll add a little more of the creole because I liked the little bit of spice but it's totally not necessary..)

My boyfriend had me rate this 5 stars which is a very big deal! I added some extra ingredients: a couple tablesoons of Cajun seasoning (didn't measure), a bay leave, and a couple teaspoons of curry powder (also didn't measure). The curry powder makes it - it's what changed the vote from a 4 to a 5. Also cooked the veggies longer so they were soft. Excellent recipe!

I've made this many times and it always turns out great! The only thing different I do is change the 1 1/2 cups of milk to a 12 ounce can of evaporated milk to make it richer. A no-fail, easy recipe!

I thought the flavor of this was very very good, but it was pretty watery, I suppose being a chowder, I was expecting it to be a bit thicker.

Took a leap of faith and tried this out with 4 Swai fillets I bought on a whim and WOW am I impressed! Only changes I made were to increase the celery salt, salt, and pepper to taste and add marjoram, basil, oregano, parsley (about 1/2-1 tsp of each), 1 fresh thyme sprig, 1 bay leaf, and a dash paprika to the spices.  Also, I didn't have any celery on hand so I used frozen peas instead and I used Mexican blend shredded cheese. It's soooo good!!

Delicious as written - I made a few changes, some worked, some didn't. I recommend adding a splash of hot sauce. To make a healthier version, use skim milk and reduce cheese to 1 cup, and increase veggies. Serve with sourdough bread for a hearty lunch!

This recipe was great! It will serve as a great basic chowder recipe that you can improvise with.  I had fresh tilapia instead of catfish and used that and just added some fresh herbs I had on hand. Definitely consider putting whatever fish/ shellfish is on special or looks the feshest at the seafood counter/ fishmonger into this chowder recipe and you can be sure it will come out fabulous!

Boy howdy, this is a great recipe! My husband loves fishing, and he's always bringing home catfish. I'm so glad that we have a new recipe for it! I made a few modifications.. instead of celery salt and salt, I used Tony Chachere's. Also, I'm watching my diet right now, so I cut the potatoes and carrots and added zucchini and squash instead. I tried it without cheese and it was delicious, but with cheese is definitely better! This one is a keeper!

WOW!! I made this chowder for my family and there weren't any leftovers. My daughter has already requested it again. My husband, who doesn't like fish, said he wants to eat this again. It's inexpensive to make and very filling.

Homemade celery salt (1/2 Himalayan salt, 1/2 toasted crumbled celery leaves), 1 Bay leaf, fresh black pepper, tilapia fillets (they don't eat poop, unlike catfish), & 2 c. shredded medium cheddar.  Tasted fantastic & we ate way too much of it. I  cooked the celery with the onions but forgot to add the broth & H2O till close to the end, after the fish was cooked, yet it still came out well. Also cooked it longer so the potatoes & carrots would be soft. Next time will eat it with brown rice & lots of water to try to avoid pigging out on it again.  :)

Very unexpected!  Not fishy at all. I tried it as written and decided to add a few things that were suggested after tasting although it was nice unchanged.  I added garlic, thyme, and basil (tsp increments and tasted).

Very Good and Easy!  My husband thinks catfish should only be fried or a stew. He approved this one.  Added 1t. cajun seasoning for a kick.

I have never had fish chowder before.  All of my kids said it was great!  I did saute the celery with the onions, and didnt add all the salt it called for.  I used tilapia instead of catfish...it is a little heathier.  I also used fat free chedder cheese and light butter to cut some calories.  For the kids I put it on a bed of brown rice for bulk to fill them up and added a few chips for dipping.(a kid thing)  All in all, great recipe!

This chowder was okay, it was very similar to a cheesy ham and potato soup my husband got out of a cookbook published by the Hobo Foundation in Britt IA, except with fish instead of ham. I cut everything up in pretty small pieces, which seemed to distribute flavors more evenly. I would have liked more cheese (we were short 2 oz) but he thought it was cheesy enough.

Yummy!!  I followed the recipe exactly and this was an awesome stew!!  I used 2% Milk Cheese, 1% Milk, and Light Butter to make it a little lower in calories.  This is a wonderful stew for a cold evening or for tailgating!  Don't change a thing!

I thought this sounded so good, but the first try following the recipe was fairly bland.  A second try with added red bell pepper, jalapeno, and a healthy dose of cajun seasoning wasn't much better.

Fantastic dish! Would work well with any hearty white fish. Halibut and Cod come to mind. Easy to make, even with all the steps and ingredients.

I made this as part of a meal train for a neighbor who is ill.  It had a GREAT texture and flavor before I added the cheese.  Totally plan to make it for myself soon and leave out the cheese or use mozzarella, the only cheese I can stand.  I left out the water and subbed chicken stock.  Definitely adding to winter meal rotation.

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes, since it's an easy one pot meal...all you really need outside of the soup pot is the bowl to mix the flour and milk, and a cutting board.  

My variation:  I increase the chicken broth to 20 oz. (2 cans of campbells)and add a chopped up parsnip.  It adds an interesting contrast of flavor, and makes it more filling.

Great soup but i made some changes as well. First off I cooked my potatoes in the chicken stock (quartered and peeled). I sauteed the onions and celery separate while the potatoes cooked. When the potatoes were still firm but not soft I added a complete small carton of heavy whipping cream and the done celery and onions. After this I added baby carrots (left whole)and I used 4 pieces of cod (each piece cut into 4 pieces) loin instead of catfish (didn't have any. I also added cajun seasoning and some mesquite seasoning. When I add the cheese I will also be adding some chopped red pepper so it can still be slightly firm when eaten.

I want to try topping with bacon next time like one reader suggested.

This was very good;however,the family and I decided that we like ham and potato chowder better. The ham seems to flavor the entire soup better, versus this recipe you only taste the catfish when you actually take a bite of it.

not a really fan of catfish but had some that I needed to use. This is a great recipe because you can't really tell it is catfish. I did saute the celery and carrots with the onions just to soften them up. But followed everything else.

My 10 yr old Son who does not eat onions, potatoes, carrots or celery, thuroughly enjoyed the cheesy catfish chowder.  I figure if it gets him eating veggies, it must be a great recipe.  I thought it was a fantasticly easy, yummy and fast chowder that the whole family enjoyed.
