really really flat cookies that you have to watch carefully so not to burn them.  real yummy if flat and dont forget to refrigerate and spray dough and sheet.
had a heck of a time getting off the sheet.

This recipe is Great!!  I read several reviews first.  several people said the cookies came out too flat.  I made sure I used cold butter sticks and put them in last.  I baked the cookies 375 for 8  minutes and the cookies were not flat at all.  They came right off the pan.  these cookies are so good.  you have to have a glass of milk with these.  Great Recipe!!

Great recipe.  Cookies won't turn out flat if you are careful to not melt the butter - just soften it.

These cookies are fantastic!  They were gone in no time.  I cooked at 350 degrees and took them out as the edges were getting golden brown.  The kids loved not only helping to make the cookies, but also loved eating them!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I should preface by saying that I do a lot of baking and I followed the uncomplicated recipe.  However, only use this recipe if you don't mind flat cookies.  These cookies have a good taste, nothing spectacular, but they don't look that good.  I like my cookies and food in general to be very appealing to the eye. I was hoping these would be lighter in color (maybe I should've used a recipe w/o the brown sugar) and that they would have been more formed and not so FLAT.  I tried baking them on a rimmed and non-rimmed sheet and on a Silpat mat all with the same results.  I even tried refrigerating the dough, so it wasn't that either.  These are just okay.  I am still looking for something that tastes and looks fabulous.  Thanks for the recipe anyhow.  Also, I agree with reducing the amount of salt. A teaspoon is a little much.

I made these as instructed and they turned out great.  I did make sure the dough was cold before cooking to help with spreading, but had no issues at all with them.

These were a hit at the Pre-School Picnic! They are colorful and tasty! They also traveled well when packed in a cookie tin with the layers seperated by wax paper.

Delicious!  These cookies are nice and soft with lots of M&Ms.  Everytime I make them someone wants the recipe.

Good, standard cookie recipe. I might use just a tad less salt, but the end result was pleasing to my niece who helped make them.

I made these and brought them to the guys that work with my husband (all Air Force plane re-fuelers) and they absolutely loved them. Almost all of them collected the recipe so either they or their wives could bake some up too! Thanks so much!

This made the best dough! I loved the texture and the flavor. May have to try it with plain chocolate chips as well because it was just so good! The cookies turned out soft and the flavor was still great after baking. Favorite cookie recipe so far!

I made these with chopped peanut butter m&ms and followed it exactly and it turned out really good! I also used salted butter instead of adding salt.

I followed the recipe and used crunchy m&ms.  They gave the cookie a great texture with the subtle crunch.  Great recipe, my family loved them!

I don't always have shortening on hand so I was looking for a m&m recipe that didn't require it and this had the most ratings. I'm glad I tried it because these are really good! These made close to 40 cookies and my coworkers loved them!

The recommended baking temp & time burned the cookies. Also they were super flat (even after I adjusted the temp) . Flavor is good, but I'll look for a new recipe next time.

These were  good cookies the m&ms I made them with were white chocolate and they were good. I did try a little bit of the dough and it was super salty so I was worried but they turned out fine they were pretty flat though.

I tripled this recipe as I made them for a school bake sale to help Haiti. If I could give more stars I would! These cookies sold so fast! They are fantastic. I changed only one thing and that was to cut the sugar in half but did not matter they still turned out wonderful and no one missed the sugar!

The cookies were really flat, after chilling the dough and adding flour (3-4 tablespoons) the cookies started turning out a lot better, but I don't think I will be using this recipe again.

I made these today with my 3 1/2 year old son and we had so much fun.  The cookies turned out great.  I used 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp just based on some other comments.  The cookies looked like cookies I would buy at the store....somewhat flat, but really good!

These cookies came out pretty flat for me. They are also quick to burn.  I probably won't use it again.
