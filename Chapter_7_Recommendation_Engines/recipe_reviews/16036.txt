This is a pretty good Sweet Potato recipie, however, unless you really LOVE cloves, use a bit less. I tried a 1/2 tea. and they were very nice.  Very flavorful and different, my kids loved them!

Very tasty.  I prefer nutmeg in sweet potatoes rather than cloves so I substituted and used a 1/2 tsp.  This is a keeper.

These were tasty, easy, and cheap, which are my three requirements these days (I live in nowheresville Peru on a peace corps volunteer salary).  I love that it snuck some protein in with the eggs, and I actually got a meal of GOOD carbs, instead of white bread, white rice, or pasta. I didnÂ´t have cloves, so I left that out, and I made Pineapple sauce to serve with it.
An excellent recipe that I will use a lot!

This is a terrific recipe for Hanukkah.  My whole family loves it and it is now a tradition for me to make this every year.  The recipe is no more difficult to make than regular potato latkes.

Pretty good!  I didn't have any cloves so I left them out, but they tasted good anyway.  Very sweet and desert-like.  Make sure you cook them until they're really brown and look burnt around the edges...I undercooked some of mine and they weren't as good as the crispy ones.

Consider using 1/2 tsp clove.  I wish the amount of sweet potato was specified by cup, since they vary so widely in size.  Try substituting a little white potato for sweet potato, for variety in texture and appearance.

Very good, we used a 50/50 sweet potato/yukon gold mix as others suggested and it was a great change from regular latkes!

I'm giving this a 4 instead of 3 because it's a nice idea.  However, more sugar is needed and it's missing something else I can't put my finger on...it might be nice to mix sweet and regular potatoes and try it that way.

We tried these for a change this year and they were a huge success.  I agree that you don't need so much clove so I reduced the cloves by half.

Best latkes we've ever had! (I made a few changes) Add 1 green apple for every 2 sweet potatoes, rinsed & grated (this is all the sugar you need...don't add brown sugar) Don't add eggs - this makes the latkes heavy, just use about 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour... enough flour to make ingredients "stick" together and form cakes. Salt and Pepper are the best spices for latkes... hold out on the cloves/cinnemon.  Use Peanut and/or Vegetable oil for frying. The green apples compliment to the sweet potatoes and help with the texture. No need for apple sauce, just sour cream with these yummy latkes!

Great recipe! I, too, tweeked it some - we like spicy at my house, so I added about 3/4 teaspoon (adjust to your liking)of cayenne pepper and about 1/2 teaspoon ginger. Delish! I let them really crisp up and they were great. I also served them with sour cream which is nice with the extra kick of spicyness. I will definitly be making these again!

Veeery tasty, but be sure to extract any moisture from the potatoes. I was trying to make it quickly and skipped that step. Although the latkes were delish, they were also still moist inside after frying and kinda fell apart (tho I did do my best to keep most of them whole). So be sure to extract as much moisture as you can! :-)

Wow! The smell in the house was amazing, it made me so excited to eat them!  They were almost as good as they smelled, just needed a little something more.  I wished they were a bit crispier.

My husband and I love baked sweets and we love grilled sweets and thought this would be a natural - but they were too sweet and spiced.  I think next time we make them, we will try leaving out cloves, cutting the sugar a little, maybe just a little brown sugar and a bit of ginger.  It was pretty funny though - we made them an a day when the A/C was on and the windows shut - and hubby said the house smelled like Christmas cookie baking time!

Really unique taste.  I don't care for sweet potatoes, but these don't taste like sweet potatoes.  Good recipe for diabetics, too!

At first it seemed that the latkes were missing a little something.  I added brown sugar and they became a tasty treat.  I don't think the are as good as original latkes but they were fun to try.

These were tasty, but I figured 2 teaspoons of clove would be WAY too much, so I used only 1/2 teaspoon and they were perfect. They are better when made small, maybe 2" in diameter. They fried up nice and crispy.

These were OK.. I prepared them just as listed, probably won't bother with them again unless I make some changes. I may try them with yams rather than sweet potato???

My kids loved this dish and they are picky eaters that hate trying new things. I did make a few modifications to get them to our liking. I guess my potatoes were on the bigger size so it took an extra egg & tbsp of flour to hold them together. I also substituted the cloves with nutmeg and added a little salt. I fried them in coconut oil and when plating them I drizzled honey over the top. 

I recommend letting the mixture sit for an hour in the fridge before frying. They seem to fall apart if you don't let them sit a while

My wife just made this with the suggested 2 teaspoons of cloves- That was way too much cloves-it gave it a bitter taste as if eating a thick leaf off of a tree...  I would suggest little to none on the cloves...

It should give the number of cups or size of potatoe to use since they vary so much.  I would use 2 cups shredded and add pancake flour, eggs, etc. to make them hold together then pan fry.  Brown on both sides and put on tray in oven until all are cooked.  This insures they are cooked through and not raw.

I was SOO excited when I found this recipe and had been planning it for a week. I prepared the exactly as the recipe listed for the first couple Latkes and thought they were very bland. I ended up (after trying for several little batches) making the following changes: 2tbs brown sugar, 2 1/2 tsp cinnamon, used 1 tbs wheat flour with 1 tbs white flour, and added 1/4 cup minced onion. After all the changes they were pretty good; but I dipped them in a lot of apple sauce and sour cream. I think the changes make them edible, but I would definitely make the original latkes over this version any time.

Went over very well.  I added a little more flour and cinnamon along with some nutmeg and skipped on the cloves.  Only bad part is they don't hold very well over time.

Lots of flavor, but definitely needs some sort of dip.  We tried ranch and that just wasn't it!

These were tasty, but I had a hard time keeping them from falling apart.  I did sub in whole wheat pastry flour so that probably made them a little less "sticky."  I also cut back on the cloves a bit since they are expensive.  My hubby loved them! I will try these again.

Absolutely abysmal! They didn't stay together, they stuck to the pan, and tasted like nothing.

they did not hold together well, so I ended up making hash browns...still good.  I took the suggestion of others to cut the cloves in half, glad I did
