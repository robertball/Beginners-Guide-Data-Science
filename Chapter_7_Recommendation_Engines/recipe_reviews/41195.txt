I found the sliced peaches in my grocer's freezer, but accidently left them in the car so they thawed.
Without thinking, I drained the juice. BIG mistake!
the potatoes were dry and too firm, I think the juice the frozen peaches would have given off would have steamed the potatoes during cooking.
had potential, but with the chewy potatoes, it was not sweet and flavorful.
I will probably try again

I didn't peel the sweet potatoes or peaches. Don't wait for frozen peaches because fresh ones work in this recipe! This was a very tasty combination!

This recipe is OK, just not as good as some others.  I prefer sweet potatoes not quite as sweet.  Probably won't make again.

I did not care for this recipe. The fruity flavor is way too dominant and doesn't blend well with the flavor of the sweet potatoes.  I managed to mute the fruity sweetness a little with a whole lot of molasses and some low fat sour cream.

Loved this recipe. Super easy and super flavorful. I used canned sweet potatoes and canned peaches, cuz why make more work for yourself?? The canned peaches worked great, cuz and after cooking, I let it sit awhile, and the all the juices (which I had been worried about) soaked in the bottom.

Absolutely delicious!  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and didn't have any coffee liqueur, but I did have about 1 tsp of grand marnier, which I put over the top.  Maybe the best sweet potatoes I've ever made!

I thought this was excellent even though I had modified things slightly.  THe first thing was that I didn't have any sweet potatoes so I used regular potatoes and I did not peel the potatoes. After making it last evening I thought to myself that there was some way to improve on what was done.  My thought was to make a roux with the liqeur and the peach juice.  We had leftovers, so this is exactly what we did.  Then I reheated the potatoes with the roux that was made.  It was so good.
Another thing that I'd change next time is the butter.  I would not add any butter to this.  I feel it is not needed.

Bottom Line is I loved it and Thank you so much for sharing.
