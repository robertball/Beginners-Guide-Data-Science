This was very good and exceptionally easy to make.  Very light but very rich.  A little piece will do ya!

I made this for a last minute picnic.  It was definitely a keeper.  Would make again.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and everyone loves it! I might not be invited back if I didn't bring it! My son even requested it for his birthday instead of a regular cake.
