I found this a tad too sweet for my palate, but the wife loved it! It gets an extra star just for that!

Just a note on the chopped almonds. One cup is way to many. I just eyed it and sprikled them on. It turned out to be a little under a half a cup. Other than that this is a GREAT recipe and all who have eaten it when I made it loved it.

This is the first angel's food cake i have ever made and it turned out wonderful.  I don't think I beat the egg whites long enough because it was not as fluffy as I have previously had.  Also I did not have almonds so I used pecans instead.

This is a very good recipe. The cake itself is moist and delicious, with that slight egg-foam taste that I love in an angel food cake. I opted to put the chopped almonds in the bottom of my tube pan and spooned the batter over them so that they would be on top of the finished cake. It worked out just fine, though next time I may chop the almonds finer so it's easier to cut. Everyone enjoyed this :)

Take a box of Angel Food Cake mix (just the contents of the box, no need to follow the directions on the box), & combine it with a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple in its own juice.
 (No need to use a mixer, just stir it with a spoon) When you do this, something magical happens. 
 The mixture starts to froth & it turns into an amazingly airy, fluffy bowl of deliciousness right before your eyes.
 Once it's all mixed up,grease and simply pour it into a 9 x 13 cake pan & bake 350 for 30 minutes

I did not have a tube pan. I used a spring-loaded cake pan (without the center hole) and baked it for 30 minutes. It worked perfectly.   Also, I cut back a wee bit on the sugar. I used 3/4 cups instead of 1 cup. It tastes amazing.   I also eyeballed the addition of almonds on top.   Also, don't be afraid to whip the heck out of those egg whites!   SO GOOD!

I made my angel food cake without the almonds and almond extract (didn't have any on hand) using this recipe and followed the directions of the angel food cake video. This is my first time using this recipe and it came out deelish!!!!(as Rachel Ray would say). It's doesn't tastes sweet to me. I didn't have any cake flour so I made my own watching a homemade cake flour recipe on Youtube. Everything came together really, really good. Good thing my son and I are the only ones who like angel food cake so there will be leftovers. My daughter will not demolish it like she usually do when it comes to cakes. My daughter can eat anything and will not gain weight.

Tasted really good but mine fell! I put the almonds in the bottom of the pan and I wonder if they were too heavy for it when I inverted the pan. Didn't look perfect but did taste great.

I am so disappointed with this recipe. The nuts all fell through the batter creating cavernous holes in the top. I posted a picture to show how it turned out. I checked the reviews and no one else had this problem but I wonâ€™t be making this again. So much for a homemade birthday cake. ??

Very easy recipe to follow. Mine was done after the minimum time-35 minutes. I thought it needed frosting so I made a light glaze from powdered sugar, almond and vanilla extracts, milk and a little butter. Whipped topping is also good on it. This recipe is a keeper.
