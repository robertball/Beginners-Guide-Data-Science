Well, I could tell from the start that this recipe needed some adjusting.  The amount of shortening and butter didn't sit well with the flour.  I used 2-1/4 cups flour, 2/3 c. each brown and white sugar, 2 eggs, 1 tsp salt and added 1 cup nuts and 12 oz white chips.  (Left the other ingred. as they were)  Bake for 11 minutes at 375 and give yourself four stars!!

Delicious cookies.  I did admit I changed the recipe just a little.  For added moisture and chewiness, I included some brown sugar.  I put in 1 1/3 cup white sugar, and 1/3 cup brown sugar (omitted the last 1/3 cup altogether).  I also used over half whole wheat pastry flour.  I baked for 8 minutes at first, then went to 7.5 minutes- perfect time for my oven.  Chewy inside and crisp edges, and nice and soft.  These are really good.

I make cookies all the time and these were great...Made just as is and they came out wonderful.  I like to make my chocolate cookies a day ahead of time because the good chocolate flavor comes out better after a day at rest.  Keep in a air tight container and they held up wonderfully!  Thanks for the share.

These cookies were good but too sweet for me, but my co-workers loved them. The second time around, I made the changes recommended by another reviewer (2 1/4 Cups flour, 2/3 C wht. sugar, 2/3 C brn. sugar, baked at 375 deg. for 10min.) and they were excellent...perfect taste and texture. I will make the modified version of this recipe from now on...thank you to the person who suggested the changes:)

Just pulled the last batch from the oven.   At first I thought they would be too dry, it was hard to put in the macadamia nuts and white chips.  However!  A little firm stirring was all it took.  they held their shape well, didn't spread (don't be afraid to squeeze big ones close if you want) too much, and the taste is so rich!  This is a definite keeper.

This is the best chocolate white chocolate chip recipe I have ever found!  The cookies are better than those that you buy at the mall!!!  The outsides are a little crispy with chewy centers!  Wonderful!  Thanks!

I will never quite understand how someone can change a recipe and *then* rate it. I made these exactly like the recipe calls for and they were awesome! Somewhere between a brownie and a cookie and very scrumptious! Definitely a keeper for us!

These remind me of a brownie not the usual cookie type. They are excellent and so pretty with the white chocolate chips mixed in.  I used 2/3 cup of brown sugar and 2/3 cup of white sugar instead of the two cups of white sugar as the recipe called for and I used 2 1/4 cup flour.  I always line my cookie sheets with parchment paper.  I will continue to make these awesome cookies, everyone loves them and you will too.

soft and delicious at first, they tend to get dry and loose all moistness.
but the taste is good all the same.

I don't know why so many people made so many quantity changes to this recipe. I took my chances and made the recipe as stated (with the slight exception of substituting half of the white sugar with brown sugar) and they came out wonderfully. I'm sure if I only used white sugar they would've come out just as good. Only thing was I made mine with a rounded TABLEspoon full each cookie instead of just teaspoon full. They came out about about 2 inches in diameter with a tablespoon so I can't imagine that they would come out big enough with just a teaspoon full for each cookie unless you like cookies the size of a quarter. Otherwise, Recipe is WONDERFUL AS IS. Crispy on the outside until you bite into it and it's soft and chewy on the inside. Stays that way for at least 2 days (Mine didn't last longer than that!) Half of the recipe makes about 28-32 cookies.

These cookies were FANTASTIC!  They were VERY sweet.  I would not add even a little more sugar than called for in the recipe.  I did add 1/4 cup of additional butter than was stated in the recipe but it was probably not necessary.  They were truly amazing!!

Hubs might disagree with me on this, as he tends to like cookies more on the (too) sweet side than I do.  These are very good, no mistake about it.  They're rich and buttery, chocolaty and soft, provided you bake them only until just set.  But they're a little too sweet for me, and it just might be the white chocolate chips that took the sweetness level over the edge.  I think if you reduce the sugar to 1-1/2 cups everyone would be happy.

All I did was add 1/2tsp of baking powder to insure they did not flatten and leave them in the freezer for some time. This is one of my favorite cookie recipes!

This recipe has become a staple in my household. I switch between this recipe and another oatmeal chocolate chip kind on this website. I have frozen this dough as well and it comes out just as well, if not better because it is easier to handle. Enjoy!!

I can't rate this a 5 because I changed one of the main ingredients...but these were DELICIOUS!  I used peanut butter chips instead of white chocolate chips.  I LOVE these chips (I could eat them by themself all day long!) and adding them to this recipe made it perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe! :)

I'm glad I followed the recipe as is. These are super moist and slightly chewy, and very sweet! The bake time is perfect IF you flatten your dough before baking. It doesn't spread out much and they look a little lumpy if you just drop them onto the sheet! But that's a minor thing, really. :) Everyone said these taste like brownies, and I tend to agree. Good recipe, thanks for sharing!

Excellent!  Instead of all white chocolate chips, I used 1 cup white & 1 cup milk chocolate.  The mix IS very hard to mix, but it doesn't seem dry.  Don't overcook these - 8 minutes is all you need so they stay nice and chewy in the center.

I am only 12 years old and thought i'd make these for my family. Everyone loves them! But you do have to push them down so when they bake, they have the form of a cookie. I used a spoon the level it and my fingers to form it. I will definetly make these again.

I LOVE white chocolate, so I had to make these for holiday cookie tins.  I followed the recipe exactly except I had run out of butter sticks and used margerine sticks instead.  They turned out just as good!  I received many compliments, and even the Boy, who HATES white chocolate, said they were like a delicious brownie cookie (haha).  I plan on making these again!

These would have been much better if I had added more flour or used less butter.  As was, they ended up being too soft and fell apart.  Very tasty, but not pretty at all!

Excellent! I followed the recipe using 2 cups of white sugar. Very good. I had to make another recipe of them because I know they'll be gone fast. The second recipe I used 1/2 white chips and 1/2 butterscotch.  I bet peanut butter chips would be good.

I made these exactly as recipe stated. Left in 8 - 9 min. and they were perfect the first day. Moist / chewy / a little crispy on the outside. Today (a day after making my cookies) they are pretty dry and crumbly. They still taste good, but the texture isn't so great. :-( Not sure why, most of my cookies don't do this.

Dough seems like it will be way too dry, but it's actually perfect -- just takes some serious muscle to stir.  Wonderfully fudgy, taste a lot like cocoa puffs!

This is a delicious cookie!!!  We made them today to set out for Santa.  I think he will be verrrrrry pleased.  The only change I made to the recipe was by misreading....I added the entire bag of white chips.  I don't think it hurt anything.  haha  Next time I make it I will probably add a small amount of coffee powder (because I use that in almost everything that I bake that is chocolate) and I'll replace the vanilla with peppermint extract to see what happens.  This is definitely a keeper!

These are fabulous cookies as is, or with modifications.  I like to use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  Sometimes I also use 1/2 butter and 1/2 golden crisco, and the batch that is making the house smell so delicious right now had 1 tbsp of instant espresso powder added to the dry ingredients.  Also added a splash of milk, as the dough was looking a little too crumbly.  With modifications or not, these are often requested by friends and family!

I followed the reviews and used 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  Cookies were great but next time I'm going to follow 2 cups of sugar to see what they taste like.  I also might add walnuts to them next time to break up the chocolate tastes.

I have made this recipe several times now. I make this recipe exactly as described except I use 2c. white chocolate chips because that's an entire package and I don't want 1/3c. laying around left over.  Other than that, I don't alter any ingredients or add anything extra or change any of the measurements.  These are, hands down, the Best. Cookies. Ever.  No, seriously, they're awesome.  I just got finished with a batch and had to come here and write a review.  I ate like 6 or 7 of them and they're not even fully cool yet.  I really mean it when I say these are my favorite cookies of all time.  Did I mention how they're the best ever?  Just wanted to make sure I was clear on that.   I bake them on 2 racks at a time, 365 degrees for 9 minutes, rotating the racks halfway through.  The reason I use the higher temperature is because I use silicone baking mats and I find that sometimes you need to bump it up a little for the cookies to spread well.   If you use parchment instead, 350 would probably be fine.  I really, really love these cookies.

Just made these tonight with a little variation. I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar. Other than that I made as stated. The dough seemed a little "heavy" I guess you could say. Unlike most other cookie dough I've worked with. I wasn't sure how they would turn out. They turned out fabulously! Only thing I will change next time is putting LESS white choc chips in it.  They don't all mix in well at all. The cookies are wonderfully soft and chewy! The DH actually rated them 4.5.. a first for him! He said they're just about the best cookies he's ever put in his mouth.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because they were MUCH more moist and chewy with 1/2 brown sugar substituted for white. Great cookies!

These are great. Everybodies favorite. I don't have alot of time to bake cookies very often, so what I do is I pull out the bar pan and I put all the batter in the pan and press it out evenly from end to end. I just bake it until it looks done. Like a cookie looks when its done. cool and cut into bars. quick and easy.

Yum!!! I made the sugar and flour adjustments as suggested by other reviewers (2/3 cup white sugar, 2/3 cup brown sugar instead of 2 cups white sugar and 2 1/4 cups flour). I will be making these again for sure!

These cookies were JUST what the doctor ordered!  I needed something I could bake with the ingredients I had on hand; this was it!  I also added pinon, which was good to me.  I made them just as the recipe dictated.  There's so many I'll just have to eat them all. :0)  SCRUMPTIOUS!

I made this recipe using the modifications from another reviewer. These cookies were good and went quickly, but they're not what I was looking for. My neighbor, who has now passed away, used to make the most wonderful chocolate chocolate chip cookies and I've been searching for a recipe that comes close. This one is good, but it isn't it.

I do not mess around with changing recipes -- I followed the recipe and these turned out well.  The only thing I did different was using the whole package of Ghiradelli white chips (2c) which is a little more than what the recipe calls for.  Just for fun I might try a mixture of white and chocolate chips next time.

My husband asked me to make chocolate chip cookies but all we had were white chocolate chips.  I found this recipe and they turned out GREAT. Husband doesn't like white chocolate and was sure these wouldn't be worth the time.  He's been raving about them since the first bite!

A really good chocolate cookie!  I followed the advice to up the flour to 2 1/2 cups, and changed the sugar to 2/3 cup white and 2/3 cup brown. Instead of white chocolate chips, I added 2/3 cup pecan bits and 2/3 cup toffee bits.  There are a few left after one week and they are still nice and soft and chewy. Will definitely make again and try different additions - maybe dried cranberries and walnuts? The possibilities are endless.

I just made these cookies and I love them!! The chocolate is not at all overpowering, and the white chocolate chips balances it out nicely. I also did what everyone else was saying by substituting 2/3 c. sugar and 2/3 c. brown sugar for the white sugar. I am definitely keeping this recipe for future use!! Thanks :)

These are exactly the kind of cookies the kids love to get at the bakery...chewy on the outside, moist on the inside...took the advise of a couple of reviewers and decreased the sugar to 2/3 white and 2/3 c brown, otherwise, was perfect the way it was written! Next time going to add macadamia nuts to it!! This one is a most definite keeper...now official the kids 'favoritest' cookie!

So good!  The only change I will  make next time is only use about 1/2 the chips.  Another reviewer said that they hold shape really well and not to be afraid to squeeze them together on the cookie sheet and that is very true.  Every one loved them (Oh, and I did use 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar because I prefer brown)

Very good brownie-like cookies. I replaced white chocolate chips with pb chips, since chocolate pb is such a great flavor combo. These really rock. The only thing was the appearance, they didn't flatten out as much as I would have liked them to, but they still taste awesome.

These cookies were delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, despite some of the other reviews.  The chocolate flavor was very rich and the white chocolate chips were a good contrast.  I always ate them with milk though!  I shipped them across the country to my family and I was told they were still great.  One note though:  they dough is very hard by the time you mix in the chocolate chips.  I got quite a workout!

i made them exactly as instructed and there were FABULOUS.  i didn't trust the baking time...they looked so raw.  but trust me, bake them for only 10 minutes ( i made huge ones and baked them for 15min) and then cool them for 5-10 min.  they are the best flaky vs. chewy cookies! my son said they are 'the best cookies in the world'

I thought they were just "okay."  I took mine out of the oven after 8 minutes.  They have a good, soft texture, but the flavor isn't great.  Maybe some melted chocolate chips or bakers chocolate to give it a "smoother" chocolate taste would help.

Not bad! Good standard white chip chocolate cookie recipe. The only thing I changed was adding a few more tablespoons of cocoa powder and put in equal parts white and brown sugar. This is only my personal tastes. I made the recipe both ways and they both turned out wonderful. I personally like more of a sharp-tasting chocolate cookie over one that is mild in chocolate flavor.

I followed suggestions made by other reviewers. I used 2/3 c. both brown and white sugar. I also used 2 1/4 c. flour and baked 10 min at 375. The cookies turned out chewy and delicious. They also held their shape well. I will definitely make this one again!

These exceeded my expectations!  I followed the recipe, except that I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar in place of the 2 full cups of white sugar.  The cookies came out crisp, yet chewy and very delicious.

Yum! This recipe is "THE BEST" chocolate-cookie recipe ever! They are quite flat;but I think they are supposed to be that way- they taste great all the same. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who absolutely LOVES chocolate.

It was a really great recipe. I had fun making it and got rid of some white chocolate chips that I had no idea what to do with. Ialmost couldn't make them cause I ran out of flour :/ good thing my stepmom was at the house and had some at er house. :P
I would recomend these cookies to just aboit anyone. :)

This recipe is STELLAR with no revisions. The cookies are moist, chewy and fantastic! My kids and my husband -- who isn't a cookie person -- devoured these.
The second time I made them, I added half white chocolate chips and half regular chocolate chips. Made for a delicious triple chocolate cookie.

I'm staying with my bachelor boyfriend, so I had to make some substitutions. I used walnuts instead of chocolate chips, kaluah instead of vanilla, and "Hershey's special dark" cocoa powder. I also only made a half batch. That said, these were delicious. Yes, they weren't terribly "moist" as dough, but they baked up plenty soft and I liked being able to use my fingers to measure out an amount instead of a scoop (which, of course, I didn't have). Yum!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. Not only did I gorge myself on the dough, but the cookies as well. I made several of these for friends and family and I'm sure they'll all love them! Thank you for your recipe, I'll be using it for a long time to come!

Fabulous but with these changes:  Instead of 2c granulated sugar, substitute: 1c Brown Sugar and  1c Granulated Sugar  Reduce Flour from 2c,  to  1 3/4 c.  Replace white chocolate chips with: 1c Milk Chocolate Chips and 1c Semi-sweet Chocolate chips  These changes produce more depth & flavor

Quite simple. Little hard to mix with my ancient Kitchen Aid mixer(and then my poor little spatula)near the end. I also used dutch processed cocoa powder, too, as I've learned it's the best. Only thing I did was add just a little more white chocolate chips and a 1/2 c. of chopped pecans. I did chill the dough for just an hour or so, but that's a personal choice. I'd make these again. NOTE: Nine minutes was right on for bake time, I baked them for ten and let them sit on the sheet, they were a little dry. This recipe made me 35 medium-sized cookies.

These cookies are fantastic. They are crunchy around the outside and chewy in the middle- perfect. They went down very well (and quickly) with the whole family.  I've since made them with a mashed banana when there were no eggs in the house and they came out just as good. The banana adds to the chewyness of the cookies.

THESE ARE SOOOO GOOD!!! I followed another reviewer's advice and added 2 1/4 cup flour instead of just 2 cups. and then added 2/3 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup white sugar. She also said to add a full 1 tsp. of salt but they had a tad bit too much salt in so the next time I just did 1/2 tsp. salt and they were perfect.  They are SOO good I can't even tell you - you just have to make them! I love putting a scoop of vanilla ice cream on! I've made this recipe 3 times in the last 2 weeks. Also make sure you keep an eye on them - you can't tell when they're really done since they stay very well formed when they're baking, so take them out when they are a little mushy and they will be soft!

Wonderful cookie!  I read many reviews and I cut down on the sugar and added about 1/4 cup more flour.  After testing several in the oven I did press them with a glass and they did not spread at all.  I took every pan out after 8 minutes and cooled them for 5.  Yummy!

I listened to a previous review and increased the flour to 2 1/4 cups and I halved brown and white sugar -- did 3/4C and 3/4C of each.  I used one stick of unsalted butter and one stick of margarine, then added 1/2t of salt.  Cooked at 10 minutes, the cookies came out rather cakey, and I like chewy cookies. Maybe baking them for less time will work better.  Pulling out my last batch in three minutes.

THESE ARE THE BEST COOKIES I HAVE EVER MADE!!! I bought the Hersheys special dark cocoa and nestle swirls chocolate chips (half white/half milk chocolate). I think the swirls made it less sweet and it was PERFECT!!!! I also accidentally added about a 1/4 cup of extra cocoa. Either way- wonderful wonderful wonderful. I have to make sure I dont keep these in the house b/c its the only thing that i will fudge on my diet for!

great cookies. i wouldn't change a thing except for adding less white chocolate chips. the cookies had too many chips and made each serving really sweet (and i do like a sweet cookie) but it was a bit much.

I followed the instructions of one of the previous reviewers (with both brown and white sugar, and a hint more flour, along with a higher baking temp) and they turned out wonderful. Rich, moist, with just enough chocolate. I'm not a big white chocolate fan, but they work wonderfully in these cookies; milk chocolate, or semi-sweet chips would almost be too much, if that's even possible. Would probably be quite good with peanut butter chips though.

I followed the directions exactly and they came out GREAT! I don't know why some reviewers said they had to use their hands...if you creamed the butter when it is soft you can add the dry ingredients a little at time and still us the mixer. I will say that I used fresh ground white wheat to sub for ap flour and sucanat with honey to sub for brown sugar for half the sugar for a healthy option and these cookies are wonderful. I just need to find a good white choc chip. Nestle is gross.

Yummy, but very sweet.  I also used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar and used Butter Flavored Crisco (What I always use in my cookies).  They are very good, but would recommend either cutting back on the sugar (maybe 3/4 cup each) or just using 1/2 bag of chips since white choc is so sweet anyways. Will be making them again, but with these adjustments.

These were delicious, but still a bit drier than I would like. The batter was so similar to brownie batter, but without some of the moistness of brownies. I would like to find a recipe with a chewier, softer texture. Anyone have a way to moisten this batter up a bit?

I've made this recipe 2-3 times this summer and it has always been a big hit!  I've never had to worry about how well they keep for more than a day because they never last more than a day!  Great recipe.

These were in a mailing from this site and it was late in the evening and I had a craving for chocolate! I did not have much butter or shortening so I used two thirds cup of oil as one reviewer suggested. Did one half cup each of white and brown sugar, to have a less sweet taste. No white chips so some semi-sweet and some Heath toffee bits, about one and a half cups total. Cooked 8 minutes at 350. Beautiful cookie, taste like a brownie, texture: fudgy, crisp outside and soft center. YUM!

I added the extra flour, as suggested by other reviewers, and regretted it. I was hoping for a soft and chewy cookie, but they ended up tasting more like a dry cake or brownie. Next time I will make this recipe as it was originally written, and I am sure they will turn out great :)

Yum! I made these with one slight change - I used the new chocolate & mint (with both types of chips) that Nestle put out...they were absolutely fantastic! The cookie is almost the texture of a chewy brownie with lots of great chocolate flavor. I will be making these again, for sure!

These are really good!  I didn't change a thing and got a beautiful, chocolaty cookie - crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. They taste like a hand-held brownie!  The secret to making great cookies is to make sure that your cookie sheet is cold (I stick it in the freezer for a few minutes before putting the cookie dough on it).  When the cookie sheet is cold, the cookies don't spread as easily, so you get a thicker cookie as a result. Thank you so much!  Yummers.

A definite crowd pleaser, and very hard to mess up! Made them according to this recipe and they turned out very tasty, then I made a batch using half brown sugar half white sugar and all whole wheat flour and no one could tell the difference. Very impressive looking too!

My grandaughter Taylee and I made these today, great comfort cookies! It was a blizzard outdoors, and taking them out of the oven was wonderful. They were very good as written, the only thing we did was add peanut butter chips because we didn't have white chips, and weren't about to go out in the blizzard.

To those who adjust the recipe then rate, you did yourself a disservice on this one.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were awsome.  It was difficult to stir in the dry ingredients so I just used my mixer on low speed, then stirred in the chips. They held up well and were moist.  My only warning on these cookies is, if you're like me and try to stay away from sweets, don't make these because you won't be able to leave them alone!

Amazing! The first time I tried it I accidentally used the normal cocoa so it was sweet but the kids loved it. Second time around I put 1/3 of brown sugar instead. I have never found a better recipe.

After the changes I made, these would be 5 stars!  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup peanut butter.  Added another 1/3 cup flour.  These are great with either the white chips as called for OR peanut butter chips!!!

This was pretty good. But if you're a BIG wht choc fan, then I suggest you add 2 pkgs of 12-oz bags of the wht chips. I added 1 1/2 of those 12-oz bags and it still was not enough wht choc flavor. But all other ingredients were perfect!

Fantastic cookies.  I don't know why some of these previous reviewers didn't like them, but my husband and i devoured them!  The only problem i found was that i misread the directions with the part about the "let cookies sit on cookie sheet for ___ minutes"!!  I couldn't understand why they wouldn't harden so i could take them off the cookie sheet and onto the cooling rack!  Once i reread the directions, the rest came out delicious!  
NO MODIFICATIONS NEEDED, IMO!!

I know people dislike the ratings that the recipe wasn't followed exactly and I totally understand that. But I bake gluten free for my kids and I substituted the white flour in this recipe for the gluten free baking mix and some xanthan gum because that's what you do when using gf flours. Anyways this was a fantastic recipe, I can now add it to my list of regulars. I have no doubt the real thing tastes just as good. (Probably way better because generally non gluten free is always tastier!) so I give this five stars!

Really good cookies!  I did use half white and half brown sugar, but made no other changes.  Sweet, chewy goodness.  Do not over bake if you want crisp edges and chewy middles.  Really good!

These turned out soooo good. I put them in the oven for 9 minutes and left them on the tray for about 3 minutes before I transfered them to a wire rack, and they were nice and crunchy on the outside,but still gooey in the middle.

These cookies are delicious just as the recipe is written!!  My family loves them and I receive so many compliments where ever I take them.  I really wish people would not rate the recipe and then state everything they did differently. If you are going to do that, then just submit your own recipe!

These were fantastic coming out of the oven.  Almost like the texture of a moist brownie.  I did add 1/4 cup flower because dough was very wet.  They turned out beautifully.

I finally found it! This is the recipe I've been searching for for over a decade.  The dough is thick and fudgy and is delicious just like that.  But for those who like to dunk 'em, you better bake 'em first.

Wow. My eyes popped open big when I first bit into one of these! Oh my goodness! It was my first time making this and wow. I will SO be doing this again! I was not ready for how good they were! I *may* have been a *tad* bit generous with the salt, cause I didn't *actually* measure it, so who really knows. I think that enhances cocoa a lot. (like putting a pinch into your homemade hot cocoa as well!) I DEFinitely  recommend this recipe! wowzers.

Delicious cookies! I replaced 1/4 of white sugar with brown and added regular chocolate chips too. These cookies are moist and the taste is amazing. Will definitely be making these again.

Taste good I also halved the sugar...half white and half brown. And used white wheat flour instead of white. Not quite what I was looking for but a good recipe on its own. easy base recipe to experiment with.

I make cookies often and this is one of the better recipes I have used with some substitutions. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening, 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and substituted white chocolate chips for crushed Andes mints. Baked to perfection at 8 1/2 minutes.

These were an absolute hit with my friends. I halved the recipe and it turned out excellent. My suggestion would be to keep a careful eye on them while they're baking--since they're so dark, it's hard to tell when they're ready. Watch for cracks forming on the tops of them. When all of them have split down the center, it's about time to take them out.

Good recipe; almost the same as Ina Garten's Chocolate White Chocolate Chunk Cookie. I used one cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar. I didn't have enough white chips so I used 3/4 cup white, 1/4 cup milk chocolate, and 2/3 semisweet.  Tasty cookies!

I made these cookies with 2/3cup of oil instead of the butter and they turned out great.  Slightly crispy outside with a soft and chew inside.   These are great made with peanut butter chips as well.  Using olive oil in place of butter makes them slightly healthier

I followed the recipe exactly.  My cookies wouldn't set at all; they were mushy and greasy.  The only redeeming quality was that the dough (containing raw eggs unfortunately) was delicious.  I was truly disappointed.

These are crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle, and perfectly delicious.  I've made these according to the original recipe and according to some reviewers' advice to use 2/3 cup granulated sugar and 2/3 cup brown sugar.  The recipe as posted tastes much better in my opinion than the recipe changed.  Keep it the same and enjoy!

INCREDIBLE. Borderline "too much" but really hitting the spot tonight. I used mini white chocolate chips, and substituted in a few regular mini chocolate chips... to die for.

I thought these were really good.  I had some white chocolate chips that had been sitting in the pantry a while and I was looking to get rid of them.  This definitely did the trick.  I halved the recipe and followed the authors instructions exactly.  Very tasty!

I have been making this exact same recipe for 20 years and I got it from my Hershey's cookbook. Can also use peanut butter chips instead of pure white milk chocolate chips. My 19 year old and 16 year old prefer peanut butter chips.

These are amazing! They are very sweet but it fits the chocolate perfectly, though you could reduce the amount of sugar quite a bit without damaging the amazing flavor at all. I had ran out of baking soda when i made these and used baking powder instead and got a very nice, cakey but moist texture. It's a keeper.

Used reese's pieces in place of white chocolate chips and otherwise followed the directions completely. These cookies are fantastic, just the right texture and an amazing flavor that can take care of any chocolate craving. I might have just found a new favorite!

I was making these cookies for two so I cut the recipe in half. They didn't turn out the way that they looked in the picture. They didn't melt down and spread out as much as they should have. I don't know if it was my portion or the recipe itself. Either way...they were still delicious!

These taste pretty good, but it was the hardest batter to work with that I have ever experience. It was so gummy while I was mixing it, that I had to stop and use my hands. I couldn't get it to mix with a spoon. Once I started using my hands, it went pretty smoothly, but it was extremely messy. I'm giving it 3 stars based on workability, not taste. For taste, I would give it 4.5.

A great recipe. After much research I selected this cookie as one of 6 recipes to make this Christmas, and I will very likely be making them again next year! For once a recipe that I can follow without altering, and to my amazement, the recipe produced EXACTLY 54 cookies, as advertised. They are melt-in-your-mouth crispy on the outside and soft inside. The only thing I changed was to bake them for 11-12 minutes, but this always varies with oven to oven.

Totally yummy chocolate chocolate!!!  I divided the batter into two batches and added semi-sweet chocolate chips to one batch and white chocolate chips to the other half.  Both batches baked up perfectly and these will answer any chocolate craving you may be having!

This is one of the best cookie recipes I've tried so far!  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of 2 cups of white sugar.  They turned out great!

These were really good! the right amount of chocolate and sugar. i used the 1st reviewers tips to make them just right. I used 2-1/4 cups flour, 2/3 c. each brown and white sugar. i didint have white chocolate chips so i used milk chocolate. baked them at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. crispy on the outside and chewy in the inside. great cookie!

Definitely a keeper! I did change the recipe slightly however since I am on a strict diet according to my bloodtype. I used only 2 cups of flour but I used whole spelt flour and then I did minimize the sugar like specified but I only used 2/3 cup each of brown sugar and raw sugar instead of white. They turned out great regarding the substitutions!

These are excellent cookies, and I don't normally care for chocolate cookies.  I did sub in 3/4cup of sugar with light brown sugar, which I think helped their moisture significantly.   Also, they cook better as smaller cookies as opposed to larger cookies. If you make larger cookies you only need to increase their cook time for 45 seconds to a minute, not several minutes like you would with other types of cookies when you make them larger than a teaspoon. If you do make them larger, though, you want to flatten the round balls on the cookie sheet quite a bit. If you leave the large cookies as round drops they bunch and get lumpy as they heat, so flatten them out a bit more as you make them larger. If you make them a tablespoon drops on the sheet, you'll want the top to be completely flat and cookie shaped as you put it on the sheet.  Also, they do get a little dry as they cool. You might want to add a bit more moisture to the mix, or cover them with plastic while they're still hot to keep them soft.

These cookies were rich, chewy and delicious--and SOOOO chocolate-y! They would probably be good with any kind of chips you have on hand--we used 'holiday white chips' that I got on sale. Peanut butter chips would probably be fantastic, too!

The recipe did not need any adjusting. Yes, it was sweet, but it was a huge hit. I've even had people at work offer to pay me to make these again! I used white chocolate chips and chocolate chips too!

These cookies are good, but I always reduce the sugar and fat content in desserts just to spare those extra calories. I halved the sugar and used raw cane sugar (less refined and sweeter tasting so you need less).  I also replaced the butter with non-hydrogenated margarine and virgin olive & canola oil (half/half).  Finally I used whole wheat flour & all purpose (half/half).  They were plenty sweet and moist and very delicious!

My husband who usually doesn't like things too sweet really like these cookies.  

When he gets a new employee at work I try to make a batch of cookies so other will drop by their office and get to know them.  There have been a lot lately so I needed a new recipe.  Another to add to my box!

I gave these a 4 stars because after a day or two they became very dry, even with a slice of bread in the container. Right out of the oven or a couple of hours later they were very good. I suggest cooking them for 8 minutes as a maximum, depending on the size of your cookie of course, they can then set up and they are gooey and pretty tasty.

Awesome! Followed other reviewers suggestions but eventually memorized the recipe because I baked them so often.  I also like to add half semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips and half white chips.  Note: if you warm them up for a minute in the oven the next day they taste like they were just baked :)

I refrigerated the dough for a few hours before baking but the cookies still turned out flat.  It may have been because I didn't cook them long enough (10 minutes).  I then let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of days and baked for 12 minutes and it came out a bit fluffier.  I will try using more flour next time.  The flavor was great.  Everyone loved them.

I thought the person who rated the cookies was completely wrong. One can not totally declare a recipe wrong without trying it first. They were great. At first I was afraid that the dough was to stiff but it was a hit. Stick to the recipe, it was wonderful.

One of my all-time favorite cookies. They are a mix between brownies and cookies. The dough will appear dry, but the cookies turn out perfect. I made them with butterscotch chips once, and then with macademia nuts (instead of the white chips), and both were wonderful.

These cookies are so wonderful! The best part is this recipe halves PERFECTLY!! I was looking for a recipe with a gooey-soft type of center and these were it! I substituted white chips for milk chocolate and peanut butter and both versions were great.

Great cookies! mine was a little dry when i mixed all the ingredients so i had to add a little milk. it was also a bit sticky to put onto the cookie sheet. but they turned out very delicious and they r a great choice for those who love sweet chewy cookies!

These cookies can be sold at any deli or coffee shop.  I shaped extra large cookies (about 4 inches in diameter) and wrapped them in celephane.  I gave them to friends for a treat to eat.  They are my new favorite chocolate cookie!

These cookies turned out awesome.  They had just the perfect amount of cocoa and chips, I added chopped up milk chocolate bar too.  Very good!

They taste delicious, but I found that they work better with a greased cookie sheet, and they needed to be cooked a little bit longer than the recipe suggested.

Tried this recipe with Andes Mint Chips.  It is fantastic.  I added about 3 TBSP of heavy whipping cream to make them a little more moist.   Great recipe and easy to do with my junior chef!

I needed a recipe for a white chocolate chip cookie and really liked the use of cocoa as it made the chips really stand out. Made for teacher appreciation and ended up making some for all the neighbors too. Great recipe.

My 12 year old granddaughter was over for one of our many baking sessions and she asked to make these cookies. They were pretty good right out of the oven ;o). I will recommend an air tight container for storage, as the crystal canister was not sufficient and they did not hold their moisture overnight. This one will be added to my recipe box. Thanks for sharing!

I thought they were great. Made them just like the recipe except that I split the dough in half and put peanut butter chips in half the dough.

I was looking for a double chocolate chip cookie & I came across this recipe & another on this site which was a video. I baked both & have to say I was delighted at the outcome of both. This recipe is fantastic! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't follow the recipe completely. I took the advice from some of the reviews & used 2 1/4 cups AP flour, 3/4 cup white sugar & 3/4 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, & divided the chips up between white chocolate & semi-sweet chocolate chips...the rest I left the same.  Turned out wonderful!!! This recipe was quick & easy & definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe at least 7 times, each time modifying it bit by bit to get my perfect idea of a cookie. I use 2 large eggs plus 1 medium egg (or just most of a third egg), 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar, and when I scoop my second cup of flour I spoon out about two spoonfulls of flour. These adjustments help moisten the cookies. From experience these cookies are great the first day but are dry and crumbly the next day so I decided they needed a make over. The only warning is that with these modifications you need to bake it the full 10 minutes (until you see small bubbly looking cracks in the surface) and you have to let them cool before eating them or they fall apart. I also tend to use 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup milk chocolate chips just because I like the flavor. Happy baking :)

Best Cookies EVER! My husband said they taste as good as subway cookies, high praise indeed! They are still soft and chewy the next day. I hate hard crumbly cookies. Made the recipe exactly as stated and turned out perfect. Definitely make sure you let them set on the pan after taking them out before moving them to a cooling tray.

I made this last night for Teacher Appreciation Day at my school and they were a hit. I didn't change a thing; they came out moist and chocolatey and ultra delicious, although they were quite fragile and the batter was very sticky. I had two differently-sized baking sheets, so there was a fist-sized lump leftover which I used to make one giant cookie. To my surprise, it turned out perfectly!

Absolutely delicious.  The kids adore these, and I must say I'm having trouble staying away from them myself!  I too made the edits listed above, reducing the sugar by 1/3 - 1/2 cup and baking at a slighltly higher heat (375F).

I adjusted the quantities of butter and sugar. The butter was cut down from 250 g to 200 g and the sugar was cut down by 1/2 a cup. My first tray was a disaster. I didn't realise that the mixture spread that far and the cookies overflowed, in the bin they went. The second tray was nice although a little overcooked with a slight burnt taste (Although this may have been in my imagination as no one else could taste it). The last tray turned out really nice, I also adjusted the chocolate by making half white and half dark but the family loved them more because of this. I don't know that I would make these again but I now have plenty of inspiration.

I would advise to do a lower temperature (320-325) because the fat content in these cookies is so high, they burned at 350. Great taste and flavor!

These cookies are so amazing! Even my boyfriend who is not a fan of chocolate loved them. I also made them for my coworkers and they have asked me to make more. The only thing I changed was I added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup white sugar. (I didn't think the sugar to flour ratio should be equal.) Even after adding less sugar I still thought it was on the sweet side but still very delicious!

Used the 2/3 C each of brown/white sugar as suggested and these cookies are awesome!  I dare you to eat just one.

This is our new family favorite!!! Hands down this is the best new recipe I've tried lately---and I was never a fan of white chocolate(until I had these cookies).  The only changes I made were adding a full bag of white choc chips, and half a bag of the mini semi-sweet chips---I like my cookies super chippy :)

This is a very easy recipe and tasty as well. They are soft and chewy at around 8-10 minutes of baking. I did try to make them crunchy by baking longer but they turned out more hard then crunchy so I suspect these cookies are meant to be chewy. The only thing I did differently was adding chopped walnuts to it and it was very nice!

I made this into a bar cookie recipe.  I made the following changes.  2/3 C Splenda and 2/3 C Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of the white sugar.  About 6 oz of cream cheese and I used the Nestle White Chocolate Christmas morsels.  I baked it at 350 for 15-18 mins.  My husband 'lovingly' exclaimed... reindeer poop! :)

Warning:  Make sure you have plenty of milk to drink before making these.  These are AMAZING!!!  The whole family went nuts for these cookies.  I didn't change anything, but I used Andes candies pieces, and the combination of the mint and chocolate cookie were to die for.  I can't wait to try these with white choc and peanut butter chips.  Thank you for the perfect chocolate cookie recipe.

The dough for these cookies tasted heavenly! I used Dark Double Dutch processed cocoa  and that gave the cookies an incredible chocolate flavor. However, when I baked the cookies, they flattened out a lot, and didn't look as good as I had hoped. They tasted pretty good when baked, but I'm not sure if I will make them again...I would like to try a different one to see if I can get puffier cookies. Thanks for sharing!

These cookies are fabulous.  After reading the reviews, I was tempted to make the changes that many suggested (using brown & white sugar, and decreasing the amount, and increasing the flour a bit).  I decided to just go with the recipe as written  since I usually like to try it as written the first time then make changes as necessary after that.  Plus, I was out of brown sugar and didn't feel like going to the store.  :)  I'm glad that I did it as written because they could not have turned out any better.  I was making these for a Christmas cookie exchange, so I doubled the recipe and added in a 7.5 oz bag of peppermint candies that I had crushed up in a heavy duty zip top bag.  That is the only change I made to the recipe.  I used my smallest Pampered Chef cookie scoop and leveled it out exactly.  I was able to fit 24 cookies per cookie sheet.  I baked them for 10 minutes exactly, and when they came out, they were a little bit puffy.  I let them sit on the sheet for about five minutes, and they flattened out perfectly and had that sort of crackled look on top.  They were picture perfect.  I don't have many cookie recipes where the cookies flatten out as well as these did.  They were chewy and delicious.  Using the smallest cookie scoop, a double recipe ended up with *14 dozen* cookies!  I had a bit of dough left at the end and decided to see how long it would take to bake a medium sized cookie.  For my oven, it was 13 min, and they were perfectly flat, as well, 6 to a sheet.

We thought these cookies were going to be WONDERFUL and we were disappointed. They tasted a lot like popcorn? Is this how they're supposed to taste? I followed the recipe, but thankfully, we only did half of the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!, but made with the suggested changes in sugar (2/3 c brown sugar, and 2/3 c white sugar) instead the 2 cups white sugar. Very chocolaty and not too sweet.

I must admit I was little concerned when I was mixing this up...it just doesn't look like your average cookie dough. However, the finished product was spectacular!  My husband could not stop nibbling on them!  This time around, we added M&M baking pieces for color in addition to the white chips.  Next time, we'll probably add peanut butter chips based on some of the other reviews.  Overall excellent cookies...so different from the norm!

These cookies were very delicious! I also agree with Alli above about the coffee. It definately jazzes up the flavor. They were soft and chewy and the white chocolate chips were oozy and melty.  Also, very understanding and simple to read recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and got DELICIOUS cookies! I originally tried it because I had a surplus of white chocolate chips in the house, but I think I might try it with regular chocolate chips next time for a super chocolatey cookie! Thanks a bunch for this recipe! :)

These are amazing! I bake a lot and tonight we had a church activity and the older girls had to make cookies. I always screw up on recipes though... I added 1 3/4 cup sugar instead and I added the whole bag of chocolate chips. They are really good!!!!! The best inside out cookie I've ever had!

These were soo good! I changed the recipe a little though. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips. I also used "Hershey's Cocoa Special Dark" cocoa instead of plain hershey's chocolate cocoa. The taste is so rich and chewy and delicious. The cookies aren't over the top sweet, though. If you're going to make these cookies, you should definitely add the dark chocolate cocoa instead of plain chocolate cocoa. It's really worth it! And I can't wait to make these with the white chocolate chips with the dark chocolate cocoa.

I followed others' advice: used 2 1/4 cups flour, 2/3 organic sugar, 2/3 brown sugar..but and then I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup extra-virgin coconut oil (hardened).  They were sweet enough and the coconut oil gives it a nice flavour.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe, however I had to go back and triple check my measurements. I did everything according to the recipe, but at 8 minutes, my cookies were falling apart. I cooked the remainder for 6 minutes and they came out very brownie like. FANTASTIC! They're really delicious, my kids are going to love them at the amusement park tomorrow. I even made a few for my elderly neighbor, he's going to love them too! 
Thanks for posting this recipe, it's great! :)

I really enjoyed this recipe!  My husband did too.  I used 1 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe and the cookies turned out great.  I used parchment paper on the cookie sheet so that I could just lift the paper off the sheet when the cookies came out and didn't even need to use a spatula to remove them.  That way they stayed in a nice circular shape.  Next time I'll try them with semi-sweet chips.  I'd definitely recommend this recipe!

pretty good cookie. i increased to 2 c. white chocolate chips, used 1 1/4 c. white sugar and 3/4 c brown.  the first batch was a little burned on the bottom, (dropped by tsp and baked 8 mins.) second batch i made doubled the size and only baked 6 mins. they were perfect!
will make again and perhaps add macadamia nuts.
cookies totally hold their shape, so i pressed down slightly.

These were excellent!  I used a combination of white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and semi sweet  chips, along with some crushed heath bar toffee.  I will call them my "triple chip" cookies when I sell them at my bake shop.

I love, love this cookie. I did sub 1/4 cup brown sugar for the white sugar. It was fine. And I didn't like it with white chocolate, so I used semi-sweet. Thinking of experimenting with adding pecans or M&Ms. 
One of my new fav recipes.

These cookies were AWESOME.  They were such a hit.  I substituted 1/3 cup light brown sugar for 1/3 cup white sugar and added some extra white chocolate chips & macadamia nuts.  They came out so good.  EVERYONE loved them.

With only 8 minutes baking, the cookies came out soft and chocolatey. I would perhaps add more baking soda next time so that they fluff a bit. My first try went badly, since I used a chocolate milk mix instead of cocoa powder (didn't have any) and the second try turned out perfectly!

These were wonderful - although it was a little harder to tell when they were done, as they are already brown!  I made them for a cookie donation my office participated in for Christmas and I love that these really stood out in a sea of plain old chocolate chip cookies.  Thanks!

These cookies are delicious.  I varied the recipe as per the previous user, 2/3 cup each of white and brown sugar and a 1/4 cup more flour.  I also used  1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa and 1 oz. of melted unsweetened chocolate blended into the wet mixture.  I recommend using Ghirardelli white chocolate morsels for the best taste.  They are much better than other brands.  Not artificial tasting.  The cookies came out chewy and moist and very fudgy.

I have been looking for a recipe for these cookies for years and I have found just what I was looking for. These are amazing!! I put white chocolate chunks in and when they came out of the oven I melted a white chunk of chocolate on top and pressed whole almonds on top. They are crispy on the edges and chewy in the center. Yummm...Thanks for the recipe!

I used shortening instead of butter and thought the cookies weren't as sweet as I'd like.  I will try butter next time.  Otherwise loved them.  Great consistency.  I added some crushed candy canes, would even be better with peppermint flavor.  I will definately make these again just with butter- not shortening!

Excellent!
These cookies turned out amazingly, and I didn't even alter anything, which, when it comes to me, is a rarity.
I think the fact that there's a brownie texture on the inside and a cookie texture on the outside is one of the reasons this cookie is so good.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and these turned out awesome.  The texture is similar to a brownie - the tops and bottoms are firm while the center is chewy.   I will definitely be making these again.

I think this is one of the best cookies I've ever eaten!!  Five stars!!  It would be great with chocolate chocolate chips also, milk chocolate would be delicious!  Even with no chips they would be delicious, almost like a brownie. I bet macadamia nuts or even walnuts would be great. I also took the advice of others and changed the sugar amount to 2/3 cup white sugar and 2/3 cup brown sugar and increased the flour by 1/4 cup.  It seemed to have worked.  I definitely recommend these cookies.

What a yummy cookie! A good friend of mine gave me her recipe that was almost the same as this with just the minor differences in flour, salt and sugar amounts. This cookie was *perfect*! Mine baked for 10 minutes and were nice and soft inside!

Great!  I followed the recipe perfectly and they were just right.  I might use less cocoa and more white chocolate next time, but only personal preference.  I chopped white chocolate bars instead of chips, for a more gourmet cookie - terrific!

I made the recipe as is.  I think next time I will try the alterations suggested by another member previously.  Mine were completely flat and burned around the edges.  They taste VERY good, but they are too crispy as there was too much butter or not enough dry ingredients or something.  This recipe is a good base to start from however!

These cookies were just fine, but I followed Bonnie's suggestions (2-1/4 cups flour, 2/3 c. brown sugar, 2/3 c. white sugar, 1 tsp. salt, 2 c. white chips), so only three stars because of all the changes necessary.

Soooo fluffy and delicious! I made a tiny adjustment and used 2/3 white sugar and 2/3 brown sugar, 1 tsp of salt, baked at 375 for 11-12 minutes.

I halved the recipe since there's only two of us. To be honest, they were just okay. For some reason the chocolate flavor wasn't as distinct as other chocolate cookies I have made. On the plus side, I would make them again. Maybe at the holidays.

These cookies taste really nice but they are a bit too sweet for me. My husband and my son both love them. The dough was really hard to work with but it all came together in the end.?

I looooved the taste of this dough!!! So good! I used Earth Balance butter instead and I used a Bob’s Redmill substitute for the eggs. They turned out a little flatter than I would have liked, but it is probably due to my substitutions. I will be tweaking some of my measurements the next time I bake cookies with this recipe.

I loved these! They tasted great and  were easy to make! I do recommend putting the cookies in the oven for 10-12 minutes instead of 8-10. Will be using this recipe again!

I made it exactly how it says, did not alter anything. they turned out great. I was concerned they would be excessively rich and heavy, but they weren’t, very light and chocolatey. I was thinking they would be more like a brownie, but they retained the flavor and texture of a cookie.

Made the recipe exactly how it’s listed but the dough wasn’t thick enough and my first batch didn’t even want to bake all the way through. I ended up adding about a cup of flour to the rest of my dough and I baked them for 13 minutes and they came out much better. They aren’t overly chocolatey but they are very sweet.

Followed recipe exactly with one exception. Made one batch with regular chocolate chips and one batch with peanut butter chips. Both were a big hit at the office.

These are delicious and exactly the right amount of chewiness to crispiness ratio!  I did take some other reviewers' advice and split the sugar amount equally between white and brown, and added a teaspoon of instant coffee granules (ground up).  I love the way coffee enhances the chocolate flavor! Definitely a keeper!

We made these for our annual “cookie day”. The only thing we changed was adding in milk and semi sweet chips. They were a hit and are being added onto our permanent list.

This was a great recipe to make, and it froze really well once I portioned them out. They bake well from frozen. You just have to make sure to add 2-3 min extra to the bake time.

I made these for a friend who loves chocolate. Too chocolaty for my taste. It is a rich cookie. I made them with the half white/half brown sugar. I wish I had tried the original recipe. This tastes more like a brownie to me. To make a prettier cookie, I lightly rolled the dough in a ball then flattened them a bit before baking.

I was searching for a good cookie recipe and this really hit the spot. Now to be fair, I stopped using white chocolate chips and substituted peanut butter chips pretty much right from the start but they’re still amazing. I also tend to add maybe 1/4 cup more flour and about 1/2 cup less sugar but that’s personal preference as ice adjusted the original recipe to my tastes. Perfect for peanut butter chip chocolate cookies

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out very yummy. I will try the other alterations but for someone who isn’t as well versed in adjusting recipes, following this one exactly turns out a really good cookie  don’t be afraid to try it as written and then experiment.

I made the recipe as stated above. All I did was change some of the white chocolate chips to semisweet mini chocolate chips and some milk chocolate chips so they were triple chocolate chips! The cookies were very soft and delicious even after storing them for a few days.  Great recipe!

These are tasty cookies but I felt that as white chocolate chips are already quite sweet, 2 cups of white sugar was far too much. I cut the recipe back to 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I did find the dough to be quite sticky and the cookie a little softer than I would like so am considering adding a bit more flour next time.

Making the adjustments accepting to a previous post of less sugar with a combination of both white and brown sugar, I made these for a large gathering. They went like wildfire! I don't like chocolate. Bu, I tasted the leftover crumbled cookie and it was so good! I will be making these again and again for me and my chocolate loving friends!

For low elevation, it needed 1/4 of flour, possibly more depending on how less flat you want your cookies to be. Other than that, they were delicious and I will make this again. I substituted the eggs for applesauce and it worked great.

I will definitely make this recipe again! The cookies were perfect - not too crunchy and not too mushy. I don't think the cookies will make it to see tomorrow.

Just like cookies at the mall. I traded half the white sugar for brown and omitted the chips but otherwise I made as written. These cookies don't spread much when cooked and stay moist and chewy for days! I was just looking for an easy chocolate cookie recipe to use up some extra cream cheese frosting (used between 2 cookies and sandwiches together ). But these were so good that they are going to be in my regular rotation. "Crazy good"was the families review.

Mine were pretty good, except for that they turned out as cookie brittle! They totally sank and are as thin as paper, i don't recommend these if you want actual cookies.

First off I'm not really a cookie fan, nor am I a chocolate fan, but these little bites really did it for me.  I had a bag of caramel chips I wanted to use up and I thought this would be a great application.  Only other change I made was to double the salt to highlight the caramel.

Made it almost exactly as written. Just added a bit more butter, switched out some of the refined sugar for brown sugar and added Some chopped chocolate pieces because I had some on hand that I wanted to use up. This cookie is crispy and chewy and very chocolately. Will make again.

I made this just to eat the dough because I needed a recipe without brown sugar. Turned out great! I scaled everything down to 1/3rd the recipe requirements. I made some changes to take out the egg (because I ate it raw). To adjust for no egg, I added 1.5 tablespoons oil and kept the vanilla the same. Thanks! It was great!

This is a really good cookie recipe. I have made it three times now. The first time I made it I put them in for longer, not realizing that they harden. Don't be worried if they're a bit soft, they will harden while they cool.

My husband decided he wanted an afternoon snack and stole two cookies shortly after they were taken out of the oven. He then comes over to me, cookie crumbs on his chin and half a cookie still in his hand and says "Oh my God, those are the best cookies I have ever had in all my life. Seriously." So they are a keeper in my house.

I selected this recipe because it looked pretty simple.  Goal was to modify to make healthier for a toddler and it was successful!  Substituted sweet potato purée for 1/4 of the butter and used 100% white whole wheat flour for lots of fiber.  Replaced 1/3 of the white sugar with brown as suggested by others and use dark instead of white chocolate chips.  Turned out great!

I made these cookies but with chocolate chips, as I'm not to fond of white chocolate. The wife and kids love them.

These were delicious-I cooked for 10 mins in a convection oven and placed them on a wire rack to cool after 1 min. These might be the best cookies I have ever tasted. Yum!

The cookies tasted good, but I didn't like how once they where our of the often to cool, they flattened. I like my cookies thick and chewy. But like I said, the flavor is still good :)

Only four stars because of changes I made.  I wanted chocolate cookies with Starlight mints in them, so made the recipe exactly as written (Ok, I used brown sugar because I prefer it) and put in about a cup of broken mints.  The easiest way to break them in my opinion, is to leave them in their little plastic sleeves and hit them, one at a time, with a hammer.  Not too hard or you will have powder.  I was a little disappointed at how much they flattened out and ended up cooking them on parchment paper because of the sugar content of the mints.  Taste is spectacular.

Made them again, and split the recipe in half.  One half was made with the mints -- incredibly yummy -- and the other half with candied cherries I had left over in the freezer.  I chopped them with a little flour to keep them separate and just stirred them into the batter.  Again, really a great cookie.  I'm also changing my review to 5 stars because we REALLY love them.

Additional update.  I live in Guatemala, and have several young girls who want to learn to bake.  We made these today with dried cranberries in them, and they were so happy they actually paid extra for the class.

Cookie had great flavor and was chewy, but was very flat. I tried refrigerating the dough, but that didn't work either. This meant the cookies cook brittle the next day.

This recipe was delicious. I followed the directions exactly. Mine made more of a crunchy rather than chewy texture but that worked for us. Will make again next time I'm wanting something really chocolate-y.

Very good recipe! I just changed the butter to 200g, and the sugar to 350g. I didn't want it that sugary I didn't have enough chocolate so I used 100g . I will make it again but I will increase the number of chocolate to 200g. 

Thank you for the wonderful recipe. My dad and his friends enjoyed them soo much that I am currently making them again! : )

Well, followed original recipe first time....everyone loved them. Decided to make a batch for work colleagues, but thought I'd try revised recipe suggested. Why oh why did I deviate from original. Embarrassed to take them into work,just a waste of ingredients. Far too sweet,sickly and hollow bottoms.Will be sticking to original recipe next time.

These cookies are the best chocolate cookies I have ever made. I make them quite often even without the white chips. I have made them with Choco chips and on their own without any chips they taste like oreos!

I ONLY made changes because I live at 8,200 feet above sea level and it just has to be done and I was out of vanilla.  I used almond flavoring instead of vanilla.  For high altitude adjustments I probably decreased white sugar by about 3 tablespoons, added about `1/4 cup of flour and 2 tablespoons of water.  Baked for 7 minutes!

We added white and chocolate chips to the recipe which made it great.  Also baked it for 9 minutes instead which kept them moist.  

My kids, husband and co-workers loved them.  Using a scoop (ie 2 tablespoon measuring spoon) helps them to keep a round shape.  They came out look really professional.  I was even asked if I bought them from a bakery!  :-D

We are making more right now!

Very easy recipe to pull off.    Tremendous chew on the cookie, and a nice chocolate taste that you can regulate depending on the amount of Cocoa Powder you use.

The recipe was easy and I made it as it was written except for the chip choice. I used mint m and m's for the Christmas season , accenting the chocolate cookie with red and green mint m&m candies. The chocolate base complimented the mint of the added candy. Thank you for a reliable ,crowdpleasing recipe!

I only made half a batch because I thought we just didn't need so many cookies. I was wrong. I should have made a double batch! I followed recipe exactly (everything halved exactly to reduce to half batch) and these were easily the best cookies I've ever had! The only bad thing is I will have to control myself and not start fixing them as a main course for dinner. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made them exactly as it says and they were perfect. Not too sweet and super crunchy. Definitely a keeper!

I used half a cup of pecan pieces and a third cup of coffee grounds in 2 tablespoons of water. Delicious with the hint of coffee.

I really like this recipe. I have made it several times using different types of chips, and every single time, it has turned out wonderfully. When I went with milk chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips, my bible study raved about the cookies and they were gone so fast!
I did cut down the butter in this recipe, but I always cut down the butter for my cookies.

I wanted to use what I had on hand, so I tweaked the recipe just a little.  I replaced 1/2 cup of white sugar for 1/2 cup brown sugar.  And I used semisweet chocolate chips instead of the white chips.  These were so delicious, and quite a hit at work!  I would recommend taking the cookies out of the oven at 8 minutes.

These are the best cookies I've ever had!  I'm not sure if this affected anything, but I was out of normal butter, so instead I used a Land O' Lakes butter spread with canola oil in it to make it easier to spread.  Maybe this affected the texture, but in the best way possible.  These cookies taste like something you'd buy at a high quality bakery.

These are absolutely the best cookies I've ever made.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  My husband and kids ask me to make these now and they've never specifically requested any other recipe!  I make my cookies kind of large, so they take a bit longer to cook (mine are about 4 inches across when cooked).  As other reviewers have said, this recipe makes a lot of cookies, so usually half a batch is enough.  But my family surely eats them so they do not go to waste!

Amazing. Like brownies and chocolate chip cookies had a baby. I use semi sweet instead of white chocolate chips, but otherwise follow the recipe and they turn out chewy and chocolatey and delicious.

Loved them. Followed suggestion from other to decrease white sugar to add brown. We used milk chocolate chips instead of white chips. Super good either way!

Looking for an alternative to everyday chocolate chip cookies and this went well with my kids...The only thing I changed was the chips used. I used butterscotch chips instead of white chips. Either way they were a hit.  Thank you.

I like the simplicity of the ingredients. They would be great to make with kids. I made a half batch and must have miscalculated somewhere and my mix was a little moist but fixed with some extra cocoa and they came out lovely and rich.

A little crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. I only used one cup of chips. We like a little chips with our cookie. A very rich cookie. Brownie-like. Delicious.

I am not a great cook, so I always look for fool-proof recipes. If it needs too many changes, I go to the next one. I baked these cookies exactly like the recipe, with the exception of swapping milk choc chips for the white choc chips. The cookies came out really nice. They do taste like brownies on the inside, which is a good thing in my book. When I tasted the dough before I put them in, I knew there was pretty much no way these cookies were going to be bad.  When they came out of the oven after they cooled, they were just a tad not as moist as I would have wanted, but still something I could feel proud to serve. I did half the portion size just b/c I was only serving 2 of us (this made 12 large cookies), and I used an ice cream scooper which is a great trick to make them perfectly round. However, this will create bigger cookies, so just be prepared (not gigantic, just a little bigger than normal). I think maybe b/c my cookies were bigger, it took longer to cook, mine took about 15 mins vs the 8 to 10 mins in the recipe. What was interesting is, unlike with choc chip cookies and most other baked goods, these cookies were better the next day! Somehow the chocolate melds together better and creates a more distinct fudgy flavor.

These are the best cookies I have ever made, and I bake all the time.  I have three teenage children that I have to hide these from so there are enough for lunches in the morning!  I use semi sweet chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips because that is my kid's preference.

Great recipe! I changed only one thing about the recipe. When I had stirred the mix up, I took a bigger bowl and put a 1/3 cup of flour in and rubbed part of it on the walls of the bowl. I mixed the rest of the flour in with the mix that I poured in. This make the cookies chunky and I baked them for 10 minutes instead of 20 minutes. I say 20 minutes cuz the above addition was sort of an experiment and I split the mix until I was sure that my hunch was right. Hope this helps.

These cookies turned out perfectly. I love soft and chewy cookies and this is exactly what they are. I used 1 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar. I also added not quite an extra 1/4 cup of sugar. Better than subway's cookies!

As with all of the recipes I review on this site, I made it exactly as written. They turned out great.  I like a crispy cookie with a soft center.  These do flatten quite a bit but I like my cookie like this, not fat and cakey soft. Good recipe!

This was a pretty great, quick recipe for white chip chocolate cookies. Wasn't all gone right away-people could only eat one because of how rich it was.

Great recipe. Loved the soft cookies!! I used chocolate chips. I had to roll mine into balls and pressed on them a little. They come out in the shape that they are put in the pan in so pay attention to that or you'll have odd looking cookies. Delicious nonetheless.

SO GOOD!!! I substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar & baked them for 8 minutes and they came out perfect! They're kind of brownie-like & I think they're even better the next day

Perfect, I wouldn't change a thing. I baked one batch for 10 minutes and they were really "fudgey" so the next batch I did for 15 minutes and they were still soft  and moist. They were both great, I'd bake them like this purposely everytime that way you get both of best worlds: moist and dense and the other soft and gooey.

These cookies are so ridiculously delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I'm happy I read the reviews before making these. It does seem a little too stiff at first like it's going to be dry but the cookies come out perfect. The only change I made was to cut the sugar to 3/4 cup of white and 3/4 cup brown instead of 2 cups of white to cut back on the sweetness a little.

I followed the recipe, except used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of white chips and I let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour. They were amazing! I baked them for 8 minutes on parchment paper. They held their shape well and were chewy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

The base dough turned out really super stiff, added some extra butter to it.   Used a mix of mint and semi sweet chocolate chips.   The taste was great but these things didn't flatten out at all!    

Husband says its a keeper but I think in the future I'll split the sugar half and half with brown sugar.

The batter made a little less than 4 and 1/2 dozen, and 10 minutes wasn't enough time. The cookies were too soft so we put them in for 27 minutes. Taste good though.

I loved this recipe! Instead of the white chocolate chips, I used mint chocolate chips and semisweet chocolate chips. They were amazing! I decided to use them for holiday gift giving for friends, neighbors and family. What a hit! I want to try different variations like, reeses pieces, M&M's, or toffee bits. This cookie dough does seem perfect for experimentation.

This recipe was super easy to follow and the results are absolutely fantastic! I rarely follow a recipe exactly, but I couldn't think of what I could do differently. The cookies are moist and fantastic and my family said they reminded them of one of the major sub chains cookies, which is a huge compliment. I will be using this recipe again and will use it as a base for other kinds of cookies!

Simply delish. The kid loved it (almost too much) and hubby gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up. I did not change a thing from the recipe. The recipe made more than enough for us to enjoy and 3 more dozens to give away as well- much to my husband's regret!. : )

Bookmarked this recipe to make some cookies for a friend's party - then discovered I had some ingredient problems at the last minute. Instead of vanilla, I used 2 tsp. brandy; instead of a full  1 2/3 cups of white chocolate chips, I had one cup of white chocolate chips and 2/3 cups walnuts. And the only cocoa I had on hand was Hershey's Special Dark cocoa. I thought it was still worth a shot -- followed the rest of the recipe to the letter, except for baking 11 minutes -- and the results were FABULOUS. Very tasty, very simple! And the last-minute substitutions worked so well I think I'll use them every time.

Super Super Yummy! If you want a chocolate fix, this is it!!
Easy and come out beautiful.  I did use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  not sure if it made a difference until I try all white sugar.  And, I did not have enough white choc. chips so I supplemented with 3/4 cup of M & M's and wow was that tasty and fun colors pop against the dark chocolate cookie.  I will do that again.

This recipe is perfect, I've been using it for years during the holidays and you'll always find these cookies disappearing faster than any of the other desserts. The only thing different I did was refrigerate the dough for 36 hours because it makes the cookies have a richer flavor and they cook evenly throughout, great recipe!!

Great recipe! I made only half of the recipe and it gave me about 12 3 inch cookies. I also altered this recipe, i followed the suggestions of the reviewers but only used half of the cocoa powder and melted 3 squares of Lindt 70% dark chocolate and added it in after the egg and vanilla. (use 6 squares for the full batch) It gave an incredibly moist, chewy chocolate cookie with about 1/4 of an inch of crisp on the outside. Perfect because i hate hard cookies. I love this recipe!

I will admit to doctoring this recipe a bit, but the results were excellent.  First, instead of two cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup white sugar and 2/3 cups brown sugar.  I have some black cocoa that is to die for, but super strong on its own.  I used 1/4 cup of that and 1/2 cup of regular cocoa.  I also used 1/2 cup vegetable shortening in place of half of the butter.  Then, just as an experiment, I used only 1/4 cup butter but also added 1/2 of a ripe avocado leftover from my lunch.  With all these changes, the cookies didn't spread much as they baked so after the first batch I flattened the dough before baking.  So far no one in my family has any clue these cookies have some avocado in them.  You can't taste it at all.  The cookies are crisp on the outside and gooey in the middle, super chocolatey and just all around yummy.  Next time I'll use a whole avocado and no butter, muahahahaha!

Cookies were so scrumptious...everyone loved them and couldn't stop eating them up. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and used a 2/3 cup of both white and brown sugar, with an extra 1/4 cup of flour. It gave the perfect sweetness. Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty cookies, so addictive! They don't stay fresh and soft for too terribly long. I replaced some of the white sugar with brown sugar, I think that made them softer.

These are quite good---followed the recommended changes on the first review. In my opinion, not as good as chocolate chip cookies, but these got very high reviews during small group.

The key to these cookies is inriching the flavor of the cocolate. Thus adding contrast between the white and milk chocolate.  I found that by adding a half cup of cooled coffee or two tablespoons of cooled espresso, the flavor and moisture deepened. These cookies were amazing with the added coffee.They tasted more like a brownie, which was great!  side note: whenever working with milk, semi-sweet or dark chocolate, add cooled coffee or espresso to inhance the flavor and add depth and dimension!!!!

These were seriously delicious! I cut the sugar a bit (by like 1/4 cup) and would probably cut it down by 1/2 cup next time. Don't try to remove them from the sheets before the 5 minute cooling period, or they will fall apart.

I made this recipe with the changes suggested with brown & white sugar plus more flour. The cookies turned out well, but pretty dry. Like someone else commented, the cookies don't spread. All in all, the cookies are good, but the next time I'll follow the original recipe!

These are the BEST chocolate cookies. My daughter makes these so often, and they never last long. The recipe is perfect as written, no need to alter sugar--they are extremely chocolaty--dark, rich and chewy. We have made them with many different types of chips--milk chocolate, peanut butter, chocolate mint (not at the same time of course) and have never been disappointed. Be sure to let cookies set a few mins on cookie sheet after they come out of oven before removing them--they come off much easier. Enjoy.

This is my first review of any recipe on this site.  Even though I am Welsh and have never been to America I love American cookies and after trying out six or seven recipes from this site, this one is by far the best.   I also replaced some of the white sugar with brown and used a mix of milk and white chocolate chunks.  The milk chocolate made the cookies gooey!!!!!   MMMMMMMMM.

These cookies had great flavor and were very soft but the white chocolate made it just a little too sweet for me.  Next time I will follow some suggestions from below and substitute at least 1/2 brown sugar and probably use nuts, or semi-sweet in place of white chocolate.

This is a nice, chewy cookie, but just a little bland. It needs something--not sure what. 
I would use about 75% the amount of chocolate chips next time. I reduced the sugar (used brown as well) because white chocolate is so sweet. The cookies hardly spread at all, so after the first batch, I shaped the cookies with my hands and flattened them slightly before baking subsequent batches.

Crispy outside, with a soft and chewy inside. Though, the cookie itself didn't seem quite chocolaty enough... somewhat bland. I shaped the cookies with my own hands, and they all turned out with perfect shape. Followed everyone else's advice, naturally.

Wow! These may just be the best cookies I've ever eaten! I can see how they might be too sweet for some though. I ran out of white sugar so I added 3/4 cup brown sugar to the 1 1/4 cup white sugar I had.  Yum! So moist and rich. The whole family raved!

I took these to my neighbors this year for Christmas and called them my "Texas Snow" cookies.  When it snows in Texas, this is what it looks like.  Little white snowflakes falling into...mud!

I made these large sized, and they set up fine after sitting on the cookie sheet for a few minutes. All my ingredients were fresh, but the flavor just didn't seem right.  I'll keep looking.

These were fantastic cookies, a real hit with my friends and family!  I made two batches in three days and they went very quickly.  I've also tried this using the President's Choice Decadent Chocolate Chunks instead of white chocolate chips ... incredible!

Good cookies but too sweet for me even though I cut down on the sugar.  Will definitely make again but will cut down the sugar a tad more.  I also baked them for the recommended time but they didn't look quite cooked - big mistake - if you bake them till they look cooked they will harden up way too much!  But a great basic recipe.

These cookies are heavenly!  I will make these before I make the old stand by traditional chocolate chip cookies.  I could eat the whole batch myself!

Very good- I followed instructions exactly and they turned out great.  Not quite the "double chocolate chip" cookie that Subway sells, but maybe if I put in half semi sweet chips it would be???  I recommend these.

These are very good cookies and were well liked by all who tried them.  I didn't have enough white chocolate chips and had to use a combination of milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips to make up the remaining 2/3 cup that I needed.  They were great and spread just enough!

Well I read a few of the reviews and I noticed that some people posted that this cookie is one of their favorite cookies ever. I kind of thought, yeah right, how can a fast easy cookie be so outstanding. But once I made them I realized how good they were. They are so addicting and I love white chocolate! yum! I think I should of taken them out before 10 minutes, but they are always better when you freshly take them out of the oven. Very easy and tasty!

Very tasty! They spread out a little more than I wanted and I used M&Ms instead of white chocolate (I couldn't find white chocoloate chips in any store in my city in Germany). I will be making these often!

This recipe turned out fabulous!! I added just a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a scant 1/4 cup extra of flour. I also used a half teaspoon orange extract with the vanilla. The dough looks sticky, but turns out a beautiful cookie. Also, leaving them on the cookie sheet to cool is critical to their success. This is a definate keeper. Thank you!

VERY CHOCOLATETY, and i love chocolate and i'm 7 months pregnant to make it worse, i would cut back on the cocoa powder a little next time. my 4 year will not eat these because they are bitter and not sweet like she is used to. that being said they have a great texture and even the batch that i overcooked came out very soft and chewy!
