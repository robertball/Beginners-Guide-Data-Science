Very nice. A bit on the sweet side for me, but I easily adjusted this issue by starting off with half of each of the syrup and the sugar. I used brown rice syrup instead of maple. I was able to heat this in about two minutes on medium. Thank you chefcs for your recipe.

I made it with half the salt, and it was too salty. I suggest making it with 1 teaspoon of salt instead.
