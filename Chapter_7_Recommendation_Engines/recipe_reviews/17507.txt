I make this recipe every New Year's Day for my family.  I couldn't stand this stuff as a kid, but I love it today (and so does the hubby)! One change  I make is using thinly sliced apples instead of the onions. I also RINSE my sauerkraut lightly in strainer. Other variations we also love is using kielbasa or beef smoked sausage.  I cut pieces into 1/2", layer a small amount of sauerkraut on bottom of crockpot, then some sliced sausage, then thinly sliced apples, then small amount of brown sugar.  I repeat this until everything is inside.  I always end with sauerkraut on top so the sausage doesn't become hard and overcooked. Before eating salt and pepper to taste.  It's even better the NEXT day!

A great starter recipe. I used beer brats,3 cans of sourkrout,1 green apple (sliced), 1/4 cup brown sugar and half a can of beer. Cook on low in the slow cooker for 6 six hours. It turned out so yummy. I offered hoogie rolls if people wanted them. I made a huge salad and some baked beans to go with! Will make again and again. Thank You

Great for kielbasa sausage.  I added a tablespoon or two ( I didn't measure; just squirted some in) of dijonaise mustard and it seemed to help sweeten the taste of the kraut.  I also used the bagged type of kraut, which seems to lend better flavor than the canned or jarred types.

Mrs. Morrison (3/17/08) totally changed the recipe, didn't she?!  I wonder what she thinks of the original recipe.  I'll take grannycancook's version. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Drain and rinse the sauerkraut to get rid of the salt.  Try turkey kielbasa for the sausage, it will have much less fat.

Good flavor. For those of us who really like sauerkraut it's a winner !!!  Better with Keilbasa.

Excellent recipe, one we have used for several years..just never with the turkey sausage till now.  We always layer the top with canned biscuits for the last 20 minutes.  Delicous.

Lovely!  I had a package (plastic tube type stuff) of breakfast type sausage 12 oz. and reduced the recipe using the calculator to 3 servings.  I slit a hole near the crimp in the sausage and squirted it out in a loop around the crock and it turned out wonderfully!  Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter (using the 3 servings measurements as a guideline) but added a few ounces of water before turning it to low.  Turned out great!  I also used about half a jar of sauerkraut (usually 32 oz.) and added all of the juice.

Delicious! The onion and brown sugar give it just the right flavors. I used polish sausage and chopped the onion. Will be making this again!

This was fairly average in my opinion, but I served it at a party and it was gone in a few minutes and I got several compliments (I trippled the recipe for the party). This was SUPER easy and very economical. My complaint was, that I did add a few (3 small) diced potatoes to this (as someone suggested) and after 3 hours on high, they weren't finished cooking, so it went another hour or two on low, and by then, the potatoes and kraut were done, but the sausages were WAY overcooked. I think next time I'd add the sausages in the last 2 hours of cooking, and then everything would be done at the right time.

All I had at home was a 32 oz. jar of sauerkraut, and I didn't feel like trying to figure the 12 oz. to take out, so I just used the whole jar and 2 pounds of sausage. I used keilbasa, since so many reviewers suggested the change. I kept the sugar at 1/4 cup, used one whole onion, and cooked according to recipe directions. It was FANTASTIC! My husband is not normally keen on sauerkraut, so I was a little worried he would just pick out and eat the sausage. He didn't, though! He said it was "surprisingly" good. He attributed the cut in acidity to the onions, but the secret ingredient that makes the sauerkraut really palatable is the brown sugar. You can't taste it per say, but it really makes a delicious difference. I served the concoction on hoagie rolls with brown mustard. So good! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

Awesome... So EASY to make!  I used jarred sauerkraut and boiled in water for about 15 minutes to get out the "sour" taste ... works like a charm ... this is the closest recipe to my Polish mom's Sauerkraut dish. Added some salt and pepper too!

This is a quick, easy, tasty recipe as is. Very good!     For me, it wasn't enough sauerkraut so I put in an extra can, plus 1/2 of a beer...served it on a hoagie with spicy brown mustard and THAT was my idea of perfection!

Made this for dinner yesterday, and was quite impressed with the taste. Downsized to two servings, but used a 14.3 ounce can of kraut and as suggested by another reviewer, a 1 pound Kielbasa sausage, thinly sliced. Used two tablespoons packed brown sugar and a medium sized yellow onion finely diced.
Came out beautifully, and the wife sayes its a keeper.
Will most definetly be makeing again.

This turned out great!I did add a few things (per other reviews) 1-2 tbs of dijon mustard, an apple chopped and I served this with a side of hot mustard.  All else I followed to the letter and it was perfect! Thanks!!

A wonderful dish. My husband is German and I am learning to not only cook German food, but also to enjoy it. This was a great place to start.

This is almost like mom use to make!  The only difference was that she:

1.  Did not rince the kraut.
2.  Added 2-3 cups of water.
3.  Added one package of Lipton Onion Soup (box kind)

This is a great start but I added some of my own flair! I added 3 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled, one medium apple, peeled and cut into small chunks but not chopped. I also used a bag of Sabrett's onion sauce found near the keilbasa at grocery store instead of the chopped onion. I love this recipe!!

Very good/easy recipe. The first time I made it, I used 42 ounces of sauerkraut (which I thought was a little too much). However, when it was ready, I found myself eating fork-fulls of the sauerkraut (and I never really even like sauerkraut.

A few tips: 1. Use extra brown sugar (3/4 cup)---it really does a number on the kraut! 2. Add some dijon to it (just a big ol' squirt of it). 3. Instead of cooking high for four hours, try it on low for 8-10 hours. 4. Ensure you stir it every 45 minutes or so. Thanks, Lisa---this is a great recipe!

I cannot express to y'all enough, that this recipe is SOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!  So much so that my husband wolfed down two helpings before coming up for air (even took leftovers to the office the next day--SAUERKRAUT at the office!), and my 2 YEAR OLD mow'd his face off on it!!!  A fussy toddler loved it!!

The brown sugar makes the sauerkraut sweet, and the italian sausage that is basically steamed on top comes out almost candied.. its SO GOOD.. definitely on our regular rotation now :)

The simplicity can't be beat.  I cooked it on the stove top in a third of the time because I hadn't prepared correctly and it was still good.  Tangy.

I have a very large slow cooker that cooks things faster than usual; so, I doubled this recipe and cooked on low for 4 hours. It came out perfectly. I use  bavarian sauerkraut, turkey kielbasa, and 2 apples. I left in most of the sauerkraut juice to avoid over-drying. Delicious!!!  Thanks for sharing.

This was so good. I'm usually not a big fan of sauerkraut, but this recipe changed my mind.  I rinsed and drained the kraut before I added the brown sugar, and I used smoked sausage.  I will definitely be making this again.

Great tasting and easy but I think the cook time is a little too long if your sausage is store bought and not home made. I cook on low 3 hours and it's great. My crock pot is brand new and seems very powerful so keep that in mind, not sure if it makes a difference but it might. Thanks for sharing.

I havent made this recipe yet, tho it is on my list of meals to make soon!  I am from a german family however and have had variations of this recipe before.  You can try pork chops instead of the sausage and use an apple (the sweetest ones work the best with the kraut) to give yourself healthier meal as sausage can be quite fatty at times!  the result will be delish! ^_^

Cooked this last night. I only had smoked beef (not pork) sausage. It was great. The skin around the sausage was tender, not tough like baked, and the sauerkraut was just perfect. I didn't have enough time to cook as long as directed so I cooked it on high for 2 and a half hours and it was so good. I will cook this again and often.

SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!  My husband didn't even swallow his first bite without saying ummm.  I was a little short on time so I cooked it on high for just over 2 1/2 hours and everything was done.  It never got dry either.

This recipe was great!  I have to say we arent much sauerkraut lovers here.  But I wanted to make it for the new year and try some different recipes to see if it would make it bearable to eat.  I used this recipe along with flavoring the kraut with recipe "Sauerkraut Hot Dog Topping" here on the site.  I used the bagged Kraut and rinsed and drained it very well.  I accidentally while dumping in the brown sugar added too much.  Probably a half cup if not a little more.  Thats okay though, it just made it a bit sweeter!  I cooked it pretty much all day long in the crockpot.  I do have to say we really enjoyed this recipe.  I ate mine on a bun with cream cheese and spicy mustard(seattle cream cheese dogs recipe on the site), and the hubby ate his plain and he really liked it.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will for sure make again sometime!

Super easy and great tasting recipe.  Will use again.  The only change I made was add an extra can of sauerkraut.  I served with mashed potatoes.

This is simplest version of Polish dish called "bigos". To bigos we Polish, add also chunks of beef, pork, mushrooms (wild are better), plums, red wine, bay leaves and black pepper. We cook it slow and eat it for a day or two, for the next day bigos is better. Enjoy!

Your recipe was very easy to fix and it tasted good.  I used kielbasa, most likely I will make it again and use pork chops, parts of pork roast or just follow the recipe and use ground pork.
I thank you a lot for letting me copy your recipe and use it.

What a great and easy way to make sauerkraut. We also washed the fresh sauerkraut, adding more brown sugar for the increased amount of kraut. Last minute addition--small jar of applesauce over the layered kraut, sausage, onion mixture added a different depth to the taste.

I made this last night and instead of putting it in a crockpot I use a large stock pot on the stove. Still turned out good. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours. I however did not use 1/4 c. of brown sugar..I use 1/8 c. It was just perfect for us. Next time I am going to drain the kraut and cut it into smaller pieces. I just got introduced to this concept at a local hot dog shoppe around here and it's just so good. It too has the sweet taste that this one has.

Delicious. Used beef smoked sausages sliced on the bias. Only change I made was to rinse off the sauerkraut first. So easy. Served as a side for Labor Day BBQ with grilled ribs, mashed potatoes, succotash and a salad. Will make again!

I used lite turkey sausage and it was delicous! Drained the sauerkraut, peeled an apple and let it do it's thing. Served this over mashed potatoes and it was a pretty healthy meal. I think I too will start serving on New Years Day.

To sweet up the kraut I had  little bit of white sugar.  I also add caraway seeds, about a teaspoon. It really helps the taste. Serve with mash potatoes

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be OK, but nothing special.  It would have been better with Kielbasa and I think rinsing the sauerkraut and using more sugar would have helped too.

Its just average.  I'm not sure why I was suprised actually because there is NOTHING to it.  Just a jar of Kraut and some sausages...the sugar does not change anything really...so if you like Kraut and sausages...nothing wrong with this...but it is certainly nothing special or different. Just okay by me.

This was ok to me. My daughter and husband liked better than I did. I used smoked sausage cut up for the meat. I didn't drain the kraut and chopped an onion in it also. Used 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

I love this dish - though many people simply don't like the flavor of sauerkraut and like it even less when it's sweet and sour. I add diced green peppers and onions to mine, but overall, for those kraut lovers this has just the right amounts.

A bunch of us at work get together and do an occasional slow cooker meal in 4 hours.  We chose this one for Oktoberfest.  

We used Kruegerman All Natural Sauerkraut in the glass jar from the local German Deli and emptied the contents directly into the slow cooker without rinsing or adding additional water.  Krugerman's sauerkraut tends not to be as salty in taste as the popular national brands.  

Based on a prior review we decided to chop the onions rather than slice them.  This worked out well. 

4 out of the 5 of us who participated would make this recipe again.

This was really good and easy to fix!! Just put in the slow cooker and let it cook. The brown sugar gives it a good flavor! We enjoyed it!

This is an easy delicious recipe.  I use turkey Keilbasa instead of the pork sausage and it works really well too!

I've taken this to potlucks at work several times and it is always a hit.  The brown sugar mellows the "krauty" flavor enough to please pickier coworkers.

Instead of ground sausage, I've sliced up either smoked sausage or kielbasa.  It's very good.

Great recipe.  I used turkey sausage links and added a potato cut into 1/4 inch pieces.  Very good flavor.  Easy.  Will make again.

Sausage was overcooked, and the juices were very bland.  This was a huge dissappointment.  No one in the family would eat more than one bite, and I had to toss out the whole pot of food.  Unfortunately this goes down in the family history as one of my cooking disasters.

I have to start off by saying I hate saurkraut and the smell of it. What was I thinking?! Serves me right.  
My husband loved this, but thought there was too much saurkraut in it.  
I think its a great recipe, but I dont know that I'll make it again becuase I don't care for the smell...but that's just me.

This was a very good stew. The flavors blended nicely. I recommend using a not very sour brand of sauerkraut - a sweet and sour would be a good blend, but I couldn't find it when I was shopping.

I loved it and like someone else suggested, I sliced an apple and used it instead of the onion.  I have never been a sauerkraut lover, but this was really good. I used the big pork sausage links and just sliced them and layered them in the crockpot.  I also sprinkled a little more brown sugar on the layers.  This is a keeper for sure.

I think this recipe would be fantastic using Italian or Polish sausage & adding a few diced potatoes.  The kraut, onions, & brown sugar tasted very good.  Unfortunately I used the ground pork sausage & I did not care for it.

This is how my mother usually fixed sauerkraut when I was growing up, so even after all these years I still love it like this.  Sometimes for a special treat she would use hot dogs instead of sausage (what kid generally doesn't love hot dogs?!!).  I also have fixed it this way for my family.  It's an old recipe that's sure please sauerkraut lovers!  Thanks for submitting this, Grannycancook.

We like sausage on a bun with sauerkraut once in a while so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. Unfortunately this just wasn't something we enjoyed at all.  I used the big jar of wine sauerkraut which I drained and rinsed and I used double smoked Harvest sausage from Costco.  The sausage was just ok, and the sauerkraut was sweet and tangy but in a bad way.  It really stunk up the house too.  Maybe I don't like sauerkraut as much as I thought? Won't make again.

I love this recipe but I only used a quarter cup of brown sugar. I probably should have used less.

Made this for my boyfriend on New Year's day 2020. He loved it. Had to stop home from eating so I could take a picture. Will be making this again and again. Thank you!

So, after about three attempts, I finally found the perfect rendition of this recipe for me! I did a much smaller batch of it, and cooked it on the stove. While browning sliced turkey kielbasa in a deep pan, I rinsed my jar of sauerkraut in a strainer, smashed out all of the water, and then fluff mixed it with 1/4 cup truvia brown sugar alternative, and about 4-5 tablespoons of Dijon mustard. Once the kielbasa was browned on both sides, (with a lid covering it to keep the moisture in), I dumped the sauerkraut mixture in with it, stirred it up, and layered ringed onion slices on top. I lit it all simmer on medium low for a bit to blend the flavors. This was soooooo good!!! And a much more manageable size for a single/small family. Love! Love! Love this! Plus, I feel good about knocking the calorie count down quite a lot with the use of the turkey kielbasa and Truvia brown sugar.  Definitely one for the win!!

I thought this was okay, not being a big fan of sausage, and loving the 'sauer' in sauerkraut -
which the brown sugar removes.  Hubby loves sausage and prefers the sauerkraut flavor from this recipe - so he really liked this. I will probably make it again for him.

What a difference a 1/4 cup of brown sugar makes! I've been making this same recipe for years minus the brown sugar. It adds a whole new depth to the flavor, I'll be making it this way from now on.... I use refrigerated deli sauerkraut instead of canned however.

Easy weekday meal.  I added fresh mushrooms along with the onion.  Kraut tasted like sweet and sour which I liked.  My husband prefers sour sourkraut so maybe next time I'll omit the brown sugar.  Also, I used smoked polish sausage which I had on hand.  Definitely something I will make again.  Thank you!

I normally don't like sauerkraut. but the brown sugar took the bitterness away. I used Jacksonville Brats, left them whole, grilled them for a few minutes before cooking. added a can of beer too.   Loved It.

easy to execute and not too crazy with the time management.  Easy to put together after a day at the office for a Hot Dinner on the fly.
