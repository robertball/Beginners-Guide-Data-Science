WARNING!!!---This cake sticks!!  Grease your pan as best as you possibly can.  I had to dump this cake the first time because the top completely stuck to my Bundt pan.  But the flavor and color are both wonderful.  Highly recommended.

This cake is very moist and delicious! It will be a recipe you'll want to make often, especially during the autumn season! Be sure to grease and flour your cake pan well, as this cake wants to stick to the pan.

I made this cake for our chruch Thanksgiving day dinner.What a hit.I only had one 12 oz. bag of white chips so I took out the cup first for the glaze and added the rest of the chips to the cake.Yes,you must grease the pan well.A small portion of mine did stick.Tnis is a keeper. Ginny W. New Jersey

I misread the recipe and added the whole can of pumpkin filling -- it came out very moist and dense -- it didn't hurt the recipe.

This is a really wonderful recipe. You must make sure that you grease and flour your pan well. And don't let it cool in the pan too long. Its great for a last minute addition to your table any time of year.

I brought this cake to an office party and had to copy it for 5 people... I had no problem with it sticking - baked it in a stoneware bundt pan which I greased well and dusted lightly with flower.  It is moist, flavorful and makes your kitchen smell wonderful when you take it out of the oven...

I took this cake to a family gathering a Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I used 4 tablespoons of evaporated milk in the glaze instead of 3.  I think the secret is to not stir it while it is heating to a boil.  I know the recipe says nothing about stirring it, but I thought it might burn.  Anyway, 4 tablespoons with just a little stirring worked just fine.  This cake is very moist and delicious and I will be making it again very soon!

This cake is excellent for a no-fuss doctored mix cake, but in my opinion it's not quite as good as a scratch cake which is why I only rated it 4 stars.  I took it to work and it quickly disappeared.  It's moist and tender, cuts beautifully and the flavour is nice and spicy.  I didn't have any problems getting it out of the pan.  It dropped right out.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I added an egg, added 2 teaspoons pie spice, substituted cinnamon chips for the white chocolate chips, used a cake mix with pudding in it, and frosted with a thick caramel frosting sprinkled with Skor bits instead of the white chip cinnamon glaze.

Was very disappointed with this recipe.  The white choc. chips sunk to the bottom of the cake and the cake itself was very bland.  Would definitely not make this again.

I made this cake into a Jack-o-lantern for my niece's first birthday by using two bundt pans, everyone was so impressed.  I frosted the cake with an orange colored cream cheese icing, and decorated the face with cut-out jellied candies and fruit roll ups!  The cake looked and tasted like it came straight from a bakery!

This is a good, moist cake that was very easy to make.  It turned out perfect.  The glaze is very cinnamon-y and I really liked it.

Great Fall Cake.  I piped a homemade cream cheese frosting, spiced with cinnamon, up and down the sides.  I also filled the center with miniature (candy corn-like) pumpkins.  RAVE REVIEWS!

Pretty good but I do not think much of the white morsels- just a little too sweet.

GREAT RECIPE! But this cake will stick!! I had to use so much flour on my stone cake pan and it still stuck a little- make sure to use too much instead of not enough flour!

Super moist and DEEEELICIOUS! Everyone loved it (even my fiance, who doesnt care for sweet things!)!! I made a few changes to make it easier on the waistline, though. I used fat-free evaporated milk, substituted the 1/3 c. oil for 1/3 c. unsweetened applesauce, substituted 6 egg whites for the 3 eggs, and only dusted the top with cinnamon and confectioners sugar instead of the glaze. If you are watching your diet or weight, those changes make a HUGE difference in fat and calories! SUPER YUMMY!!! :)

This is an awesome cake. Whenever there is a potluck everyone requests that I bring it. It's usually the first thing to go! I pour the entire glaze on the cake, serving the extra on the side usually doesn't work for me.

good but not great. I cooked it too long -- don't be deceived it it doesn't look like it's done inside, the outside will get tough if you leave it in too long. great glaze, though!

Really good, super moist.  Next time I think I'll add cloves for a little more spice.  My only fault is with the glaze.  I made it in the microwave and it coole to a very hard shell on top of the cake.  When you cut the cake the glaze cracks and falls off.  I will try again and make it on the stove without stirring.

This tasted great.  The only problem was that it was so moist it fell to pieces when I was trying to get in out of the pan.  I'd make it again for family, but not for company.
