Loved this sandwich!  We grilled the sausages and added the sauce to the sandwich rather than mixing it in, as I knew we would have leftovers.  The flavor combination of this sandwich is spot on.  They just all blend really well together.  I served this with 'Blue Cheese Fried Potatoes' from AR, and we enjoyed a very delicious meal.  Thanks Joey Joan for your creation, and for sharing it with all of us!

We made this almost exactly as instructed, and wow, what an easy, flavorful, and fantastic sandwich! (The only thing that was different was the flavor of sausage we had "garlic Gruyere" chicken sausage.)  The sauce was FULL of heat - like make ya sweat and make ya yell "whoo!" after each bite.  I can't imagine having that much hot sauce on a buffalo flavored sausage. Personally, I'd reduce the Tabasco to 2/3 or 1/2 as much, to dial back the heat -- but that's just me.  Thanks for the tasty, easy recipe!

This is SOOOO delicious!  I ate mine without the bun and dressing and it was still very good.  My husband had it all and talked about it all night.  Can't wait to make this again.

Perfect! I'm lucky enough to have a speciality grocery store that makes all different flavors of fresh chicken sausages, so I did use fresh buffalo chicken sausages, cooked them and kept them whole. Added in the peppers and onions, cooked those then added the buffalo sauce and heated through. I actually forgot to use the spinach (and I bought it too, lol), so  I put the sausage on the toasted bun, topped w/ more buffalo sauce, ranch dressing, the peppers and onions and some crumbled blue cheese. These were so tasty, and hubby and the little guy absolutely LOVED them! A great twist on a sausage, peppers and onion sandwich. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
