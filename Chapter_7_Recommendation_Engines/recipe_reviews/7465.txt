A couple of tips to make this cake even better:

1. Use a 9/13 pan.
2. Melt the butter before pouring it on top of the dry cake mix.
3. During the last 10 minutes of baking, sprinkle chopped walnuts and shredded coconut on top.

This cake is out of this world!

The proportions of the wet to dry ingredients in this recipe are the most perfect of all the 'dump cake' recipes I found on this site.  I had no dry cake mix left on top.  I had just a couple of tbsp. shy of the 1 cup butter.  I cut the slices of butter into pats and placed them over the entire cake trying not to leave too many gaps.  It worked perfectly.  I only had about 1/3 cup coconut which was fine since so many reviews of dump cakes on this site state that there was too much dry ingredients and not enough wet.  This was perfect.  I whipped up some cream to put on top and my coworkers loved this cobbler-like dessert.  I was leary of using a bundt pan so I put it in a 9x13 sprayed with pam and it worked fine.

Easy and delicious! Perfect for summer cookouts or potlucks.

BTW, no need to drain the pineapples.

This is really great and so easy to make.I used a 9 by 13 inch pan instead of a bundt pan and I topped it off with pecans and coconut.  It turned out wonderful.  I can't decide if I like it better warm or cold.

Made this for the first time and it came out perfect.  Took to a pary and all loved it! I made only a few changes recommended by other reviewers....I used a 9x13 pan, layered the cherries, then pineapple (do not drain), then I added 1 cup of shredded coconut next followed by 1 cup of chopped pecans and lastly the box of yellow cake mix....Don't stir it all up....just leave in layers...then I used 2 sticks of butter...one I melted and poured over the cake mix and the other stick I sliced and layed in the spots where the melted butter didn't reach...this made it cook perfectly without any gaps of uncooked dried cake mix leftover as I have had in the past.  Turned out absolutley perfect!!

This is a great recipe!  My mom used to make this for me when I was little (without the pineapple), and sometimes she would use blueberry pie filling instead of cherry filling.  I don't recommend using a metal 9X13 pan if you plan to store the leftovers in the pan - the acids in the pineapple start to corrode the pan!  Use a 9X13 glass baking dish instead.  Great recipe!

This recipe is a hit with my family.  It's especially good served warm over ice cream!
I also tried it with a can of apple pie filling-servied it warm over ice cream, then topped it with caramel.

My oldest boy and I decided to make this together today but honestly, he was able to pretty much do it on his own with me watching. He did choose to mix the crushed pineapple and cherry pie filling together in a large bowl, then he poured it into a greased 9x13 glass baking dish. Our dump cake was done at just under 35 minutes. We let it cool just a touch, then served it with homemade vanilla frozen yogurt. This is crazy good. Super white-trash-cookbook style but most of your comfort food is.

This is my go to recipes. I have made this many times. Its easy, guick, and so good. I use the 9x13 cake pan. I use 2 lite cherry pie filling(any brand)because I like it more tart than sweet. One large can of crushed pineapple, undrained. I mixed these together in a bowl and then pour in the pan and then cover with yellow cake mix. I melt a stick and ahalf of butter and drizzle over top of cake and then add coconut and pecans. My family loves this and my husband doesn't even like fruit pies or cobblers but he loves this. I have also used this with 3 cans of peaches and topped with cinnamon and sugar and it's just as good.

I've made this recipe for 35 years and its always a favorite at family & friends gatherings.  I do a different twist on this recipe.  I put this in a 13" X 9" cake pan.  I take the dry cake mix and add to it 1 C chopped nuts and 1 C coconut.  I don't mix the cake mixture up with the pineapple & cherry mixture, I just put the cake mixture on top of it.  Then I take at least 1-2 sticks butter cut up and put on top of the cake mixture.  I cook it for 50-60 minutes at 350 degrees or until golden brown. Its fantastic.

Such a simple but very good cake to make. I mix the cake mix with the melted butter and then spread that (carefully) on top of the pie filling and pineapple. That way you don't get any dry spots of cake mix. Served warm, served cold, it's good no matter how you serve it.

I've been a fan of Dump Cake for years.  I got the recipe from my grandmother when I inherited her recipe collection.  I've never baked it in a bundt pan though, and since it's more like a cobbler than a cake I'm not sure why you would. I recommend using either a 9x13 inch pan or an 8-9 inch square pan.  I think the sqaure pan works best as it makes the cake thicker.  

This is also good with pecans and coconut added in.  It's great served warm or at room temperature.

Very very very rich.  You just can't eat too much at one time without loads of milk!  I ate it with Cool Whip and it was great.  Next time I'll add chopped nuts.  I found I had to drain the pineapple otherwise it's too runny.  I also used a greased 9x13 pan instead of bundt.

This was pretty tasty and very rich.  It really does have to be eaten warm otherwise it's just not the same.  I liked the flavour combinations alot.  It reminded me of a cherry cobbler my mom used to make.  Thanks for sharing a quick and simple dessert idea.

VERY yummy! for those that expect this to be the consistency of a cake it is not. I already knew that on finding this recipe. A dump cake isn't like a regular cake. I'm not sure why they suggested a bundt pan. I use a 13x9 baking dish and take it to potlucks. Its very tasty!

I know there are lots of reviews already. I had to say that everyone loves this dump cake and it is so easy to double or triple even for a crowd. I take food once a month to a homeless shelter. I have taken these in 2+ separate 9x13's and used a huge roasting type disposable pan and dumped ingredients x3 with same results. Delish!

Do not use a bundt pan!!!  I have been making these for years and I think that the name is somewhat misleading to those who are not familiar with this dish. As others have stated, this is supposed to be more of a cobbler, so using a bundt pan is useless because the dish is not supposed to stand alone like a traditional cake. Use a 9x13 pan and bake for 50 minutes at 350 degrees instead of 35 to 45 minutes at 325 degrees and this will turn out delicious. All of the other instructions and ingredients for this recipe are fine. With all of that being said, approach this as a "dump cobbler" instead of a cake. I think that if you go into making it with this in mind, you won't get unexpected results. If you do not enjoy fruit cobbler, this is probably not the dessert for you.

I made it exactly like the recipe, and it wasn't done, so I cooked it longer.  It seemed firm, but when I took out of the pan, it was still mushy inside.  Not a good texture at all.  Yuk.

I wanted to do something with cherries for the 4th and I had a ton of yellow cake mix, so I thought I would give this a try. The bundt pan seemed like a nightmare to try and serve this cake so like other reviews I opted for the 9 x 13 pan. I used a Lite Cherry filling and was so disappointed in the lack of cherries that I added a whole bag of frozen dark cherries to the fruit layer. I only had 3/4 cup of butter, so I used that and it seemed enough. This didn't have a whole lot of cherry flavor. I think the pineapple kind of mellowd it out.Glad I added the extra cheeries. This is a breeze to throw together, but don't do it a day ahead because it was pretty soggy the next day.

I made it in a bundt pan which was a disaster. I was able to salvage it and transferred it into  another dish to finish cooking for another 30 minutes. After reading other recipes on another site it states a glass pan should be used at 325 and any other pan at 350. This is the most misleading recipe for a person who has never heard of a dump cake or made one.  I will make it again but in a 9x13 dish instead.

Made with a 15-oz can of mandarin oranges since I didn't have crushed pineapple on hand, and baked in a 9 x 13 pan for 40 minutes.  Wonderful!

This is an old and still wonderful cake recipe.  Love it with other pie fillings too, but cherry seems a favorite. I picked up strawberry pie filling by mistake one time, sliced a few fresh strawberries over the top and was so good too.   One thing I do is to add the cocoanut and nuts to the cake mix, then proceed as usual. cece

I lightly grease the bottom of a 9x13 pan and sprinkle graham crackers over the whole bottom and then add the rest of the ingredients.  I also have used the melted butter and find this works the best and then top it with slivered almonds and bake.  DELICIOUS!!!

I LOVE this recipe!  I make this if I am in need of a quick, but tasty dessert!  Although, I think it tastes better the next day!  My only alteration is  that I use 1/2 cup of melted butter instead of a full cup.  This is a winner!

It's so easy and delicious. My family loves it, especially my 18 yr old son. I find it best made in a 9x13 pan. I think it would be kinda hard to serve it out of a bundt since it's not like cake at all, but more like cobbler like other people have said. I also always melt butter and pour it on. You can get it more even that way, I think anyway

A+ for ease, but I found this to be too sweet and not rewarding enough to make again, especially with how rich it is in fat & calories. (I know it's dessert, but if I'm going to eat something bad I want it to be REALLY good and this recipe just isn't up my alley.) 

It IS more of a cobbler, and the topping gets soft overnight, so if you're going to make this, make sure you have a sugary sweet tooth & plenty of people to eat it. I also found the cake:fruit proportion to be a bit high; I'd put an extra can of cherries in there to balance it better.

So good!  I made it in a 9x13 and only used 3/4c butter because that's all I had. I also only had chunked pineapple so I put it in the food processer. I had a HUGE can of cherries so I used a lot more cherries.  I'm making it again right now with the rest of the can of cherries I am tryig chocolate cake... I can't wait!

I personally enjoyed this recipe.  Not only is it easy and takes very few ingredients, but it's so good.  I also added coconut and a few pecans.  So good!  I used a 9x13 pan also and had no problems.  The only change I made was I used half the butter, I did melt it before adding it to the cake.  It wasn't too dry at all, just perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out WAY too sweet and very goopy. Luckily I tried it on my family before we used it for company. Will not make this version again, but may try some of the alternates that some folks have suggested.

I would call this recipe "edible" at best. I was really disappointed with the consistency. I'm not sure why you are suppose to make it in a bundt pan- don't you typically turn those over? I let it cool for 15 minutes before turning it out and it was a flood of gooey cake, cherries and pineapple all over my cake plate and counter. I was really disappointed. It seemed like a weird junk food concoction that someone would make up when they are craving sweets. I'd say skip it.

I was really excited to try this recipe, not only because of the great reviews, but a friend and my sister both have raved about dump cake. I followed the directions exactly, including using a bundt pan, and it never set up. There was just too much liquid. I baked it, checking regularly, for at least 2 hrs (covered the top with tin foil after it browned) and it was a disaster. I make plenty of scratch cakes and complicated desserts, so I didn't expect this outcome. Guess I'll have to stick with scratch!

I followed the directions, which by the way was very easy, but my cake did not hold its shape.  It fell apart when I flipped the pan to a plate.

This recipe is SOOO delicious and super easy!!! Made this one night for company and served with ice cream and/or whipped cream. Didn't use coconut or nuts (we aren't huge fans of either) and it was AMAZING!!!!!
The butter and cake mix topping makes the cake. So delicious! Dont have a bundt pan. We just used a glass 13x9. Worked perfectly. We ate leftovers straight out of the fridge and it was delicious cold as well! Thank you for posting this recipe!
P. S. DONT drain the pineapple!!!

If you want a warm sweet gooey dessert this it. I used blueberry pie filling. Sprinkled pineapple with cinnamon and sugar. Topped cake mix with  pecans and coconut for added texture. Drizzle melted butter all over top for extra richness.

I had some apples that I needed to use so that was my fruit. I sliced them up small. I didn't peel them. Put a cup of hot water with a cup of brown sugar. Then finished as written. This is delish.

I made this in my cast iron skillet. Next time I'll add nuts for a bit of crunch. I felt like it was missing crunch. Maybe even some cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.

This was okay but not perfect.  Not sure what was different than the last time I made it.  I'll have to look up my old recipe and try again.

Could not find my auntie's tried and true recipe for dump cake, but I sure wish I had. I saw one comment that there was no need to drain the pineapple, but I am in disagreement. Wish I had read more reviews. This is in my oven now and it is a soupy mess! hopefully it will continue to bake a bit and evaporate one of the liquid.

This was fantastic!  The only changes I made were that I added some frozen cherries to the cherry pie filling, I used a 9x13 pan and baked it at 375 degrees.  I definitely want to make this again!

Super easy dessert.  As others said it is more of a cobbler than a cake but still tasty, especially with some vanilla ice cream.  I did melt the butter to just pour on as others have mentioned.  Also about 15 minutes from end of cooking added some shredded coconut on top.  Delicious!

I did not care for this recipe. You MUST read the negative experiences first. My experience was just like other lower rating  users...tried it in a bundt pan, flipped it out and it was a hard clump of a mess.

The cake was delicious, I made it in a  9 X 13 pan. I had a problem with some dry cake mix left on the top. I will stir the fruit and cake mix together a little before putting the butter on top. Will definately make again.

Very good and very easy to make, but so sweet you can only eat a little bit (and I really love sweet stuff).  Family and friends loved this.  Great with cool whip or vanilla ice cream!

Didn't care for this with the yellow cake mix; too sweet for me. I think I might like it with chocolate better. Hubby really liked it though, so we'll probably give this one another try. Very simple and easy recipe though. I really like that about it.

I took a fresh pineapple, "crushed" it in the food processor and added a half cup of orange juice because the fresh didn't have as much juice as canned.  When I sliced my butter, I used The Pampered Chef Ultimate Mandoline.  It was a super easy and fast way to make the slices thin enough to cover a 9x13.   YUMMMMM!!

Excellent, easy cake to make when you need something in a hurry or when you want something different. I have made this using white or yellow cake mix, apple pie filling & pineapple or cherry pie filling & pineapple. A very forgiving and adapatable recipe!

delicious!  we had it warm with some vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it.  I can't believe how simple it was!  I made it on a movie marathon night, and I was gone so little time that I barely missed anything that was happening when I disappeared to make cake.

I've made this several times.  I use a 20oz can of crushed pineapple - mostly undrained and only 1 1/2 sticks of butter.  I melt the butter and pour it over the top of the cake as suggested by other reviewers.  I also bake in a 9x13.

Delicious! I followed the recipe to a tee, except I used about a third less of the butter. It still came out very moist. I also used a 9x13 glass dish and it baked great.

This recipe has way too much butter. I've also made the dump cake 1 from this site and it was much better.  Needless to say that didn't stop my sweet lil' vultures from gobbling it up.

I don't like cherries, but I love them in this recipe.  This is a very sweet cake.  You really do just dump it in the pan!  This is perfect if you want  a warm dessert to serve at the end of a party.  I threw it together as my guests were arriving.  It baked while we had appetizers and played a couple of games and it was out cooling just in time for dessert.  Perfect!

DO NOT USE A BUNDT PAN.  Use a 9x13 pan and it will turn out fantastic.  This has a cobbler type consistency and should not be turned out onto a cake plate.  Best if served warm in a bowl a la mode.  I can't wait to try this with peaches and pineapple!

I make this recipe all the time with the following modifications:  Use a 9x13 pan and use one stick of melted butter and drizzle it over the top of the cake mix.  I have made it both with and without pineapple.  My family actually prefers it with 2 cans of cherry pie filling and no pineapple.

I think this is just average; therefore, I gave it 3 stars.  I must admit that my own ignorance regarding what a Dump Cake is supposed to taste like is partly to blame.  It really is like a cobbler or if it's not supposed to be like a cobbler then I did something wrong.  I ended up with a "crust" made of cake mix on top.  Even though it turned out totally different than I was expecting (which is not the fault of the recipe provider), I can still only grant it 3 stars.  My husband said absolutely nothing other than, "This smelled really good baking."  I think that is his way of saying, "I wish this tasted as good as it smelled!"

I made this in a 9 x 13 pan instead of the bundt pan, and I melted the butter, drizzling it on top of the cake before cooking. I would have liked nuts on it, but I didn't have any. It is delicious, thank you for sharing this recipe!

I am known for using all my friends and family for guinea pigs, this recipe was made 15  of us and every single person-young and old-raved about this cake!  Make sure to cover the cake mix with sliced butter/margerine to make it totally decadent!

I tried this last night IT WAS FANTASTIC! I search the web for recipes quite often and find that it wasn't all it's cracked up to be and are very disappointed, my husband and son absolutely loved it and my son doesn't eat anything! Thanks for the recipe I will make this again and again.Also I did follow the recipe to the T.

I second GINAH1's suggestions. Also, serve hot with ice cream or cold with whipped cream. Women seem to like this recipe more than men.

Very good. Very easy.  Good hot, warm or cold.   I used blueberry pie filling.  Cut the margerine into squeares and placed on top of cake mix.  Will make again, and try other pie fillings..although blueberry was delish!

The cake is delicious but I followed the directions and had to add about 1/2 hour to baking time.  I think the next time I will use the 13 by 9 pan and I would reduce the amount of butter.

Yay!  This is a great EZ "no brainer" dessert anyone can make at the last minute.  There are many options for substitutions.  I didn't have canned cherries so substituted with a jar of maraschino cherries with the syrup (stems removed, of course)  and one  12 oz can of apricots, but any bland fruit would do, pears etc.,    as long as it doesn't conflict with the Cherry theme.    Then I sprinkled a small box of undissolved Cherry Jell-o over the fruit before topping with the cake mix and butter.  But a White or Cherry cake mix would be good too.  Next I'm going to try Strawberry cake mix with frozen strawberries and strawberry Jell-o.  If it bombs, I'll let you know.  ;o)

This is exactly how my mother made this cake minus the coconut or any nuts..
Right this minute 4 of the Women in our Family are on a group text arguing about how she made this cake, that my mom had been making at the least 30 years ago.. Thank you she used whole cut up cherries, not filling..

Based on other reviews, I made this in a glass 9x13 pan and used only 1/2 c of butter. I still thought it was pretty rich, even without adding nuts & coconut. I can't imagine I would enjoy it at all with an entire cup of butter.
But it's a very tasty dessert that I'll make again using apple pie filling & maybe some cinnamon.
I did cut my butter into small, thin squares placed across the top. However, some spots were left without any butter after baking & were just pockets of cake mix. Next time I'll either melt the butter & pour it evenly over the top or try to cut my squares even thinner & smaller. Thx for the recipe!

This is a great dessert and a favorite but if you trust me it’ll be even better. Spray with PAM. Layer PREMIUM cherry pie filling (don’t get the cheap stuff). Then layer crushed pineapple. Don’t stir. Then add chopped pecans on top of the pineapple (to taste) i use about a cup. THEN add yellow cake mix. I melt an entire stick of butter  and gently pour as evenly as possible over the cake mix. I barely freeze the other stick of butter and slice very thin and place over bare spots and just use it all up. USE UNSALTED BUTTER!!!! Not salted and absolutely not margarine. Bake as directed and serve with ice cream. Honestly i wouldn’t like this that much with out the pecans it makes the texture so good!

My family loves this recipe.  I do add coconut and pecans on top and bake in a 9x13 glass dish!   I sometimes use banana cake mix and strawberry pie filling for a slightly different taste.  Easy and delicious!

I love this recipe however I made a few changes I added vanilla extract and sugar to my pineapple and cherry mixture. I also wanted a crispy crust so I added eggs and oil to my cake batter. Then I poured my cake batter over fruit then added slice butter on top and put it in oven. It turn out great!!!

I tried it just like the recipe.  I used the bundt pan, did not drain the pineapple, used a cup of butter and baked for 45-50 minutes.  It turned out like soup.  I am so disappointed.  Perhaps I will put it in a glass bowl and bake some more.  Yuck!!!!

I followed the advice of others and used a 9x13 glass baking dish.  Instead of 1 cup butter I used 3/4 cup butter cut into small squares and evenly distributed on top of the dry cake mix.  I baked it at 340 degrees for about 45 min.   It was the perfect consistency and delicious.  I took it to a pool party and there wasn't one crumb left.

Very easy to do! I used what I had in the cupboard, blackberry and apple pie fillings with chocolate cake--delicious!! I sliced the butter real thin and didn't need a whole cup. Baked it for 30 minutes, perfect!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I didn't have a can of crushed pineapple, but I did have a 21oz can of pineapple rings, so I ate two of them and took about 2 T of juice out and crushed the rest of the contents with a pastry blender. I then mixed that with the cherry filling. I also did not have yellow cake mix, so I used white cake mix with some cinnamon and nutmeg whisked in. Greased the pan, dumped in the cherry/pineapple mix, dumped on the cake mix and poured melted butter all over the top. Awesome warm with ice cream and cold with whipped cream. YUM!

I used the recommended size can of the cherry pie filling, a 20-oz can of pineapple chunks (with the juice) that I mashed first before adding to the pan, a box of white cake mix, 1 stick of butter plus 1 stick of margarine melted, 1/2 cup of walnuts and 1/2 cup of coconut on the top. I baked mine in a 9x13 pan at 375 for about 50 min. At about the 40-min mark, I used a fork and stirred the cake just slightly to incorporate the ingredients a little more... and because I was trying to hide the spot where I took some out to taste it! I served it with ice cream. My family loved it! Thank you!

This is exactly how I've made dump cake for years.  No fail, works-every-time cake.  And sooo good served warm with a little vanilla ice cream.

This is so good!  I made for the Super Bowl this year and everyone loved it.  It's so easy to make so that makes it that much better!  I used a 9 X 13 pan instead and that worked great!

Yummy! I used 2cans of cherries, 1 can of pineapple & a 9x13 pan & it turned out great. I think this is my hubbys newest favorite dessert.

I made this tonight and my husband and I liked it. This would be good at a pot luck or family get together for sure. Next time I will be making the apple/caramel combination.

This was delicious. I melted the butter as others have suggested and added pecans at the end. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. Will certainly make this again and again.

This is the first time I've ever made a dump cake, only heard about them last week.  I read through all the recipes on here and the reviews. What I learned was to add instant vanilla pudding to the cake mix and grate the butter over the top. I forgot to add walnuts and coconut in the last ten minutes and I had to cook it longer than the directions said. About 10-15 minutes more. I still had some dry cake mix in parts but over all it was pretty good and I don't like cherries! It was also a bit sweet for my taste but the boyfriend loved it and so did his daughter so I'll probably make it again!

I actually gave this five stars. I didn't have any cherry pie filling so I used a can of crushed pineapples, coconut, and bananas, with chocolate cake. I had butter in the freezer, so I grated it over the cake mix. DELICIOUS. My kids loved at, as well as my hubby. I didn't use a bundt pan, I used a 9X13 pan, and it turned out great. I will definitely make this again and again, with different fruits.

I forgot and didn't use a bundt pan. The flavor was okay, but maybe dump cakes aren't my cup of tea!! It was decent/okay to eat on the outsides of the pan, but the middle was too gooey.

Used only 1/2 C. butter (1 stick) plus the suggested coconut.  DO NOT use the Bundt cake pan; you'll never get this out in one piece and even if you try to use a spoon to dish it out, it all slides together.

I lightly greased a 9x13, doubled the cherries, then followed the recipe as written (including pineapple w/ juice). Baked at 350 for 50 minutes. Fantastic.

Easy and tasty; the only complaint was that it was a little too sweet.  We served it with fresh whipped cream to help comabt the sweetness.

I have been preparing this recipe for at least twenty years. My personal favorite, along with my family and friends is "Peach" dumpcake.  It serves as a substitute for peach cobbler without going through the hassle of making homemade dough.  Also, I sometimes add coconut and pecans or just pecans alone with a dollop of vanilla ice-cream! Yum

great recipe ! Did it for my kids cooking class and microwaved it for 9 min. covered and 9 min uncovered. You could always brown it under a broiler for a couple of min after that so it can look prettier. The kids were excited that they could make such a delicious dessert all by themselves.
