Delicious! I just made this and it turned out perfect the first time.  Very easy and so tasty.  Red pepper seeds go a long way, so I only used 1/2 tsp and it still had a kick.  I also used canned diced tomatoes instead of crushed because it's what I had on hand and it still turned out perfect... a little more texture.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe for family or company.  I used dried parsley (qty. divided by 3), and a little less red pepper for our liking.  Three times the recipe fed my gang of 9 people and another small family.  BTW, 3 cups of crushed tomatoes is what is in the large fat can.

Very tasty!  I added a green pepper and 8oz of mushrooms.  I also topped it with crumbled feta.  I have already given the recipe to family!

Absolutely delicious. Made it for 10 people last night. It was very easy to make and had a restaurant quality taste. I used half and half instead of cream and chicken sausage to lighten it up and it worked out perfectly. Thanks
for the great recipe.

It was just ok for me. I added oregano to the recipe and a little more cream.

This recipe awesome! I had to restrain myself from going back for thirds.... I used chicken italian sausage rather than pork to lighten it a bit. Tasted great.

This was good.  I think next time I'll use the entire pound of sausage instead of half, though.

This was more of a meat sauce than a creamy tomato meat sauce, which is what I was looking for.  I tried Bow Ties with Sausage, Tomatoes and Cream and that was EXACTLY what I was looking for.  This was fine, but if you're looking for creamy, this probably isn't it.

We LOVE vodka cream sauce, and this one is really great! Very yummy and filling. Will make again for sure.

Very good recipe. I used mild Italian sausage and a little bit more cream. Came together very quickly and it smelled wonderful. Also, used a bit more Grey Goose than the recipe calls for.

Yum! My boyfriend and I have made it twice in the last month! One of the only foods I've ever found that tastes as good or better leftover the next day.
