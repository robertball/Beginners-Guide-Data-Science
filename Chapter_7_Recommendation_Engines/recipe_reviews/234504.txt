Spruced this up even more by using shallot, celery, bell pepper, and adding sausage and shrimp.  I added peas and green onion, celery leaf just before finishing.  Easy, semi-homemade, delish!

Spicy to me, but my husband ate it up. I used half chicken breasts instead of all the sausage, and I added a half can of sweet peas for some color and to sneak in a veggie. Spicy enough you could add more veggies too!

This recipe is a keeper. I did not use 48 oz. of andouille, I split the 48 ounces between chicken, ham and shrimp and andouille. Delighted.  I browned the chicken in olive oil and butter, removed it and then added andouille and ham and onion in the remaining oil to saute. Added the cooked chicken. Then followed the recipe.  Shrimp was added at the end. However,  I had to cook it one hour for my desired consistencey. Low and Slow! Great. Rotel made it really special.

I made this for my family for Christmas just to add some spice to our traditional side dishes. They loved it and think I'm a N'Awlin's pro now. They're asking me to make gumbo!! LOL. Thx for the recipe.

I had the family sized package, so followed the liquid instructions for that, but did everything else the same.  Very delicious and spicy...which is how we like it.

Decent flavor, but not out of this world 5 star.  I used turkey (kielbasa) sausage and the flavor was great.  Green chilis were a bit much for us.  Next time will skip adding those.  Good for leftover lunch for work.

Turned out excellent, just enough to keep it simple yet more flavorful than the base.

I have made jambalaya from scratch and there is no noticeable difference. To this recipe, I cooked chopped up celery as well as onions. I added shrimp the last five minutes so it had shrimp and sausage. You could easily add chicken as well.

This was awesome have made it twice.  I have used both andouille sausage with shrimp and chicken - I like the shrimp better.  Both times I made this dish I have only used 1 box of rice.  I let the dish simmer on the stove a bit longer to reduce the fluid but it was good for 4 people.

Added 2 diced chicken breasts and used 4 hot dog sized andouille sausages. Also added 2 ribs of minced celery.  Next time will add green pepper too.  Used the mild rotel tomatoes.   Dish was a little spicy, but not too much so.  Makes a large amount and was easy to make, will definitely make again!

Excellent and fast way to turn this mix into passable "real" jambalaya. I added shrimp as some others indicated.
