We loved this delicious salad.  I think the author meant 1/2 cup red wine vinegar as this amount was perfect.  All the flavors blended very well.  Next time I will add some fresh parsley.  Will definitely make again!

I decreased the vinegar by 1/3, but it was still quite acidic.  the taste is great though, just that my stomach was protesting all night because of the amount of vinegar in it.

I agree with everyone else's 1/2 cup red wine vinegar alteration, surely a typo on the authors part. 

Awesome recipe....tastes just like a greek salad I order from a local restaurant, love it.

I was craving Greek food, so when I found this recipe, it sounded great! Not only did it hit the stop, it did 3 times!We had enough for pita and flat bread wraps, leftovers, and I even made more a few days later it was so good!

I brought this to a party and it was a big hit - with such a big salad, there was none to bring home! I did alter the dressing a bit by adding a dash more lemon juice and a little over a tsp of salt.

Way too much vinegar. A dressing should kiss the salad, it shouldn't drown it. The flavors of the vegetables should still come through, not the flavor of vinegar. Try with fresh olives instead of bottled. That makes a huge difference in taste, also.

Very, very good salad.  I made the dressing exactly as specified and tasted it.  I found it very acdic so I added a Tablespoon of dried mint and 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar.   Then I let the dressing sit while I prepared the rest of the meal.  When it came time to eat, I added about 1/2 of the dressing to the vegetables.  The addition of sweet and the mellowing time worked wonders on the dressing.  The mint came across as an undertone of flavor; definitely a good addition.  Next time, maybe less basil, less red wine vinegar and a boost to the lemon juice amount.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!

As a general rule of thumb I use equal parts oil and vinegar.  When I make Greek salad I usually just use oil and vinegar, but the extra's in this recipe are a nice touch.

Very tasty salad! I ended up just using the baby greens and not the romaine. The dressing is fantastic. All my guests loved it. As good as the Greek restaurant here in town! Thank you.

This is the first Greek Salad I have tied and found it to be very good. Like one review I think there was too much vinegar  so I will add more olive oil to the mix. I kept the dressing separate and put it on each individual salad so I can make the change and try it again. There are only three of us but I still made enough for a couple of meals.
Very good and quick.

I am not much for putting fruit in my salad, but I had the fruit on hand and thought I would try it. My whole family loved this. My son, a very picky eater had seconds!

Great salad recipe!  I omitted the onion and olives (I was having guests over - wasn't sure of their preferences, seemed safer to leave those out), and I used spinach for the "baby greens."  Unfortunetly I thought I had red wine vinegar but I didn't, and had to substitute with white wine vinegar (using about half the amount, as others commented).  It was still really delicious and my dinner guests loved it.  Can't wait to try it with the red wine vinegar.

Very delicious. Big hit with the guests. I too only used 1/2 cup of red wine vineager and it worked out very well. Next time instead of just adding all the dressing to the salad and then serving, I will keep the dressing separate b/c it made the salad a bit soggy. This way people can add as much as they like. I also threw in a few egg whites.

Very, very good.  I followed the recipe, but followed others reviews to cut back on vinegar.  I used 1/2 cup.  Because it was just for me, I combined the liquids in a jar and whenever I want a quick salad, plate up some greens, chop up an onion and tomato and serve.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!  This is the best homemade Greek Salad I've ever had.  The key, I think, was the dressing. It was so good that I now use this dressing in many other salads that I prepare. Unlike other salads, this one can be left in the fridge overnight and it just gets more infused with the flavor!

I only used the dressing recipe.  I used Penzey’s Tuscan Sunset seasoning in place of the dried herbs, added a little salt and a little extra lemon juice.  Perfect!

Well, it's pretty hard to mess up a salad (as long as you have the ingredients right),  and this was pretty good. The only thing I have a problem with is the dressing--WAY too much vinegar--the salad was practically drowning and I didn't even add all the dressing! The dressing tasted pretty good though, considering. I would just use only half the amount of vinegar next time.

Great salad.  Increased the oil and herbage in the dressing and added grilled chicken.

This was very good and so flavorful. I used fresh herbs and garlic, half the vinegar, and herbed feta, and it was delicious. Next time, I'll add more garlic.

Way too much vinager and I reduced the amount by 1/2 cup. Still didn't help... I couldn't even finish the salad and couldn't taste any of the other ingredients! Will never make this again.

This is so good!  A bit tart, yes, but that is good in my eyes.  I added little salad tomatoes and left out the cucumbers.  I also did not have any olive oil, so I had to use canola (yes, I know...lol)  but it still worked out.  I just made this the second time and added some chopped red bell pepper.  I can't wait for dinner tonight!

I took this salad to my family dinner and every one loved it. I love this salad!!! I of course changed the vinegar to my liking and tastes but it turned out great.

I have been looking for a Greek dressing and I think I've found it -- I do agree that this is a tad bit vinegar-y -- I only used 1 cup and it was still a little too much but this can easily be adjusted.
