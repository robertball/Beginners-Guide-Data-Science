Just like Mom used to make (almost)!  Some things to keep in mind, make sure the loaf is sealed (or the filling spills out) and make sure the dough isn't rolled too thinly.  The taste is awesome.

This is exactly what I was looking for!  Absolutely delicious, just like I used to eat in Hungary growing up.  Now, it's my turn to pass this heavenly tradition on to my boys.  My only problem was that it cracked during baking, but it tasted so good no one seemed to care.  Note to a previous reviewer, this dough does not rise, it rests.  If you are looking for something that rises, it's probably a kalacs or a nut roll.  Hope that helps.  Boldog Karacsonyt and thank you for this woderful recipe.

In Polish, this is Strucla z makiem i orzechami wloskimi: Diós-mákos beigli in Hungarian. This is just like my Polish Grandmother makes. She would sprinkle some poppy seeds on the top and her's were always in baked in a circular pan. She calls them Kolocz or Kolacz, but I've heard them called Poteca, or Strucla orzechowa (strusel with nuts) or Strucla z wloskimi (walnuts). Other variations are strucla z migdalowa (almonds), makowiec or makownik or strucla z makiem (with poppy seeds). This was a hit at my Christmas party this year! Yummm! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko%C5%82acz

I make a similar recipe a few times every year.  One tip for those who would like to simplify, you don't have to stick with walnut filling (or even make it from scratch).  You can use any pie filling available in a can.  I've used Triple Berry, Apple, and several others.  I prefer poppy seed filling, but due to drug tests, I stay away from that for people.  Also bakers, make sure you check the date of the yeast you are baking with.  If it's expired, it won't rise.  Also, it's usually better to "proof" the yeast before adding it to a recipe which will "prove" that it's a good yeast batch.

The recipe that has been passed down in our family is different in a number of ways, some being we only use walnuts, don't use sour cream, use 2 whole eggs. Another way is that my Grandma would mix powdered sugar with the ground walnuts. My mother changed that part and mixes maple syrup in with the ground walnuts. I sometimes do both or just use maple syrup and we do not roll the dough out so thin and don't have as many rolls. The upside to that is that I have never had any problems with the rolling of the dough and so forth. We only make it for Christmas and Pascha (Easter). It is nice to see so many other people with the same tradition of Potica.

I was so excited about trying out this recipe when I saw the beautiful pictures and great review. I followed the recipe to the T, using all fresh ingredients. I believe the main problem was the dough--mine did not rise AT ALL after sitting for over 2.5 hours! The filling came out to be too watery and I had to drain access liquid before I used it. So, I ended up with 3 tiny loaves that didn't rise in size even when baked, and they had waaaaay too many nuts inside (because of the proportion). Very, very dissappointing!!! By the way, it took a lot longer than 30 minutes to prepare it--it was well over an hour, not counting the clean-up.

This recipe made a lovely coffee cake, similar to one of my family recipes. FYI - This traditional pastry would be called a "kolac" - more like a coffee cake. Beigli is a traditional pastry made with yeast dough that is rolled up like a jelly roll with a mixture of sugar, egg white and ground walnuts or poppy seeds. I haven't seen any recipes on this site for beigli and may post my family's secret recipe.

The flavor is really good but not quite as I remember my Grandma making...hence only 4 stars.  My dough split open but still turned out tasty. Very good recipe just maybe not exactly what I was looking for to recreate the taste from my past.  Still Very nice thank you!!

I don't even have to make this to know that it is scrumptous.  My neighbors mother is Romanian and she makes these all the time.  She always send my family a few slices.  I am leaving germany soon so I decided to hunt the recipe down myself.  I can't wait to try and make it on my own.

This is the real deal. Having eaten a lot of beigli, including in Hungary, I decided to make my own. This was the recipe I decided to try based on several others I saw.  All beigli recipes are subtly different: for example, some use ordinary flour whereas this one uses self-rising flour. So it is best to follow this recipe as close as you can - allowing for the inevitable things that don't quite work out.  

Some hints and tips I found useful.  The recipe calls for the sugar and milk to be at "a syrupy consistency". I wasn't quite sure what that meant but found it occurred after about 10 minutes of warming/boiling the mixture. This probably a bit long as the mixture when cooled became quite stiff and hard to work. It tasted delicious mind you but beware not to leave the mixture too long to cool.  If it does, try flattening it with a rolling pin.

The sour cream where I live is quite thick - unlike the more liquid type found in Hungary. A bit of water, or milk, helps loosen the sour cream.

Amount of dough is definitely just right for three rolls - no more no less.

Cooking time was a bit less than above - closer to 25 minutes.

Do allow plenty of time, especially the first time.  It probably took me closer to 4-5 hours start to finish, including preparation. 

The rolls splitting while cooking  is by far the biggest 'danger', so take care with the dough and getting the right thickness.  

But this a delicious, authentic beigli. Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed.

This is so close to the recipe that I make with my Hungarian grandmother and her five sisters! So many memories of these wonderful women teaching me, a new generation, to make these family recipes! Makes me think of all of them with loved

Today my sister reminded me of our tradition of our mother making Beigli for Christmas (we are from Hungary). So I decided to give it a whirl and found this recipe. I followed the recipe almost verbatim except for grinding the walnuts (using a hand grater) not just chopping them. That is the way our mother made them. My next attempt will be with poppy seed.

It was very good. One question for the crowd: my beigli always splits at the top. Anybody have suggestions for preventing this?
