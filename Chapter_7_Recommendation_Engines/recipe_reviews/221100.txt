I made this cake the other night - I'm torn between the rating to give, and may remake this cake and adjust the rating based on the second outcome.  First up - the only company I'm aware of to make strawberry extract is Watkins - which fortunately I had a brand new bottle and thus why I made this recipe.  I scaled the recipe back to make 8 servings and used regular cake tins.  I found this cake to be dense and quite heavy which surprised me as the batter was remarkable light/airy and reminded me of a boxed cake mix. I couldn't detect a noticeable strawberry taste either.  The cake took on a somewhat muted pink tone that wasn't so detectable after it had been baked, frosted and cut. The recipe didn't suggest the cake be frosted but I used an all butter buttercream frosting and used a dark chocolate drizzle w/ fresh strawberries on top.

I made this cake today and was disappointed.  I was expecting more strawberry flavor...it didn't have much flavor to me.  My husband liked it though, so I guess it wasn't that bad.  I made the vanilla glaze (substituting strawberry extract for vanilla) for it and that was good.  I also made mine in a 9X13 pan instead of springform pans and it was done in 30 minutes.

I made this cake and I think the recipe is wrong!!!! I think it calls 1 tsp baking powder instead of 4 tsp.. I followed the recipe exactly and my cake was hard like pudding.. not good at all
