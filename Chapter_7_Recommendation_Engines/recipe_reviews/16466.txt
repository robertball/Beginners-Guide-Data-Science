Delicious! I love chicken salads and anything with bacon is bound to be good so I had to give this a try. I used leftover rotisserie chicken and 1/2 cup of Hellman's light mayo with 1/4 cup of light sour cream for the dressing. I de-seeded my tomato so nothing would get "watery". I loved the crunch from the celery and instead of just placing this on a plate as a "salad", I decided to roll this up inside large tortillas with the romaine lettuce and avocado slices because afterall, some chicken salads deserve to be eaten with your hands rather than just a fork!

This was a decent chicken salad...very simple to make and you probably have everything you need.  I only used half a cup of mayo and added a good deal of Lemon Pepper seasoning and garlic salt...it needs some spicing up.  I've made it twice now and it's much better with diced chicken breast than with canned chicken...it's a better texture.  I also added the avocado to the mixture rather than as a garnish.  You really can add anything to this and it will turn out pretty good.

My family LOVED this salad. The mix of flavors was terrific. I served it over a bed of shredded lettuce and it made a beautiful and very simple dinner for a hot summer day. There was enough leftover for one lunch the next day and we fought over who would get it. I will make this again and again!

Awesome chicken salad!  I have made it twice this week already!!  Even my 3 year old loves it.  I added some chopped apple in there to give it a little sweetness and it was fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!!!!!  The dressing makes this sooooo good. Eventhough the most of the dressing being mayo, I thought "Eww, I don't know about this"  but this was a very excellent choice and refreshing.  The ingredients calls for celery but when following the directions it doesn't mention celery so I forgot to add it.  I don't think I will either when making this again because it was good just like it was.

Great light but satisfying main dish salad. I didn't really play around with the ingredients other than adding some sour cream to the dressing.  This is a beautiful, healthy and tasty salad, with all its confetti colors and fresh ingredients.  Most notable was the avocado and bacon, which lent not only great flavor but creaminess and crunch.  It's kind of a sedate salad, not boldly flavored, but I actually found that appealing after heavier meals.   I'm not generally a "salad for supper" kind of person, but served with "Peppery Cheddar Muffins," this was quite nice!

This is great! I added some shredded cheddar cheese and served it in wrap sandwiches.  My family loved it! My family loves chicken salad and liked the addition of the bacon.  I'll be making this version quite often!!

Very good. I used campari tomatoes from Costco and low-fat mayonnaise. I did add fresh ground pepper. I had my sandwich on toasted low carb bread, the boys had theirs on toasted Orowheat potato bread. Next time, I'd add a little more green onion.

This was really good!  I used the chicken in a can and added a little garlic powder to the dressing.  But other than that, I thought it was great as is.  Thanks for a new twist on an old favorite!

This is an excellent recipe.  Everyone I have made it for loves the unique change to the regular chicken salad.  I add one bunch of arugala or watercress chopped into the salad itslef instead of serving it over lettuce leaves.  Makes great sandwiches too.

This is a good base recipe to be adjusted depending on personal taste preferences.  My suggestions: Unless you *love* celery, leave it out, definitely mix the chopped avocado in with the chicken, tomatoes and bacon. The dressing was a tad bland even after I added garlic powder and a splash of white balsamic vinegar. We ended up squeezing a little extra fresh lemon juice over the top of the salad (placed on a bed of mixed greens) and it did the trick. I would also use red onion instead of green onion. I sprinkled the top with a little crumbled blue cheese and slivered almonds, which I would repeat (perhaps walnuts instead).

Absolutely delicious!  The more you ate, the more you wanted.  I mixed the avocado right in and it picked up the flavors from the dressing.  Yummy!

Pretty good (if I do say so myself!)!!! My fiance and I are going to Harry Caray's for his bro's surprise 40th Bday party tonigt. Since we are on a tight budget (we are planning a wedding = $$$) and don't want to spend tons of money on food while there, I decided to make a quick meal at home before heading out. I didn't have much time to prepare anything but sandwiches, but was craving something other than just a plain jane one. This fit the bill perfectly! I ended up making four servings for the two of us (so that I'd have enough leftover for a couple of sandwiches this week). To speed prep even further, I purchased an 8 oz. bag of Tyson's diced rotisserie chx. & pre-cooked bacon. I found that an 8 oz. pkg. of chx. was all I needed (I didn't even open the 2nd one - apparentlly an 8 oz. bag is equivalent to appox. 2 c. worth...). My only other ch. were to add 1/2 t garlic powder & ~ a t of distilled white vinegar. Aft. tasting the salad as written, I felt it needed something, but couldn't determine what. I add. a bit more lemon juice, but wasn't impressed. It was not until I add. the vinegar that this went from meh to mmmm. :-) I think using Miracle-whip may even be a good sub. (and would give me the zing I'm looking for). Served on toasted white (split top) bread w/ lettuce as a garnish. You can't get any closer to a BLT than this! Salt & pepper kettle chips were a great side. Thx. for sharing, Britt. I'll definitely be add. this to my reg. rotation!

I really like this salad. It makes a wonderful low-carb lunch. I used uncured turkey bacon and canned chicken (a little salty, but so easy). I chopped up some avocado and just threw them in the salad. I also added some sunflower nuts. I will be making this again!

My parents-in-law went on and on about how great this was! Always nice to impress the p-i-l's. I made the recipe as suggested. I also used the Boiled Chicken recipe from this site for the cooked chicken. Oh, I completely forgot about the avocado. Maybe I'll add that next time. Can't imagine this getting any better. Thanks! I have a feeling this is going to be asked for in the future :D

I was very impressed with this!  I cooked my bacon in the microwave and used leftover grilled chicken.  I didn't use the avacado (didnt have).  Make sure to chill this to get the best flavors.  I sprinkled with onion powder and paprika.  I will make this again.

Wow, this is an amazing recipe! It tastes absolutely fantastic and I have already made it twice this week! It is terrific how it is, although I tend to use less mayo, and I have also played around with the ingredients depending on what I have had on hand. Instead of celery I used apples and it was fantastic. My wife and I have been using it as filling in wraps instead of on a salad, and it's so yummy! Add a bit of cheese and pop it in the oven on broil for 5 or so minutes- what a yummy lunch! I will keep this recipe as a standard in the kitchen for a long time!

A really good salad!  My family of ten all liked it and that's saying something!  I added sliced almonds to the top for crunchiness.  YUM!!

This is awesome!  Love it!  I think I'm addicted to it!  I eat leftovers for lunch for the week.  I eat it with apple, too, for that extra fiber!  Thank you!!

I used a rotisserie chicken from the store.  This was just ok for us.  I have another chic salad recipe we prefer much more.  This was just not the kind of flavor we were looking for I guess.

This was pretty good. I felt that it needed a little something though. The boyfriend hates chicken but he enjoyed this. Made the crusty french bread on this site into a big bun and put it on there. Not bad. Thankyou!

We really loved this. I made it with leftover Roasted Lemon Herb Chicken from this site, and otherwise followed the recipe adding lots of black pepper. I ate mine on lettuce with avocados as instructed, and my guys had theirs on potato rolls. Everyone happy, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe has won me MANY praises by family and friends.  I also like to add some red grapes - YUM! When pressed for time, I buy a rotisserie chicken from the local supermarket which results in really flavorful and tender chicken, perfect for this salad.

Excellent! Excellent!  This will be a regular moving forward. Thank you!  I'm desperately looking for yummy salads to get off rice and bread at night. This was an answered prayer. I used cilantro and light mayo. I did not have celery. I also did not have Worcestershire sauce so I used Braggs Amino Acid (soy sauce). Yum!!!!!

The first time I made this, the celery was a little overpowering. I cut the celery amount in half the second time, and it turned out great! Very nice as a lettuce wrap.

I just put this together for dinner tonight.  Wow!  I made the dressing with light mayo and dried parsley.  I used the packaged grilled chicken breast strips from Costco and increased the bacon to eight slices.  I mixed the celery with the chicken, tomatoes, and bacon, then tossed in the dressing.  When I licked the spoon...WOW!!  I will serve it with shredded butter leaf lettuce tonight.  I've been looking for a go-to chicken salad recipe and I think I found it!  Easy to make with staple ingredients.  Yummy!!

Terrific salad! I followed a couple reviews and used some sour cream, rotisseries chicken and mixed the avocado in with the chicken, etc. It would be good as a wrap sandwich, too. My husband rated this as better than his favorite chicken salad from a favorite restaurant!

Fantastic recipe !!!!  I added 1 chopped apple, 1/2 cup walnuts & shredded cheddar cheese. I mixed 1/4 cup mayo with 1/4 cup Miracle Whip, 1 tsp lemon juice & 1/8 tsp Worcester. I put it in a whole wheat wrap & topped it with shredded lettuce. My family LOVED it - including my fussy son who doesn't normally like mayo based salads/sandwiches.

Scaled this down to a simple sandwich for me and have to say that of all the times I've made these sandwiches, I never thought to add a dash of worcestershire.  Between that and the chopped seeded tomato and center cut bacon, it was a delicious pita dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! Try using breaded chicken finger strips - this is very good. Omit the avacado and serve over lettuce leaves. Also, try a honey mustard dressing - super yummy.

Anything with bacon is almost guaranteed 5stars =)  This was great! I modified slightly because I wasn't intending to make this, but since I was multi-tasking and my chicken got a lil dry, I decided to make a chicken salad out of it... LOVE THIS! I didn't have celery, which would add a nice crunch... and I don't have avocado, but I can only imagine how the creaminess of the avocado would take it OVER the TOP! Can't wait to make again!

What a nice salad!  We made it into wraps and topped with monteray jack cheese.  Yum!  I was lazy, so I used bacon bits instead of actual bacon. Added a nice saltiness. I also cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup.  It was plenty.

I made this and surprise my husband.  I cut up the romain lettuce to make it easier to eat.  The next day we put the salad in pita pockets!  Delicious!  However the next time I will cut down the mayo.  A great dish to make for a ladies luncheon also.

Used cooked chicken breast from a recipe earlier in the week. Perfect for lunch. Loved another reviewer's suggestion to de-seed the tomato to avoid being watery. Used Greek yogurt and light mayo.

Great chicken salad!  I followed the recipe exactly. This was wonderful as a wrap. Served it with cucumber salad and potato chips. Great light dinner on a hot summer night. I used grape tomatoes right out of the garden.  Hubby and son fought over the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for a new twist on chicken salad.

Made this as a quick dinner during dress rehearsal week (in community theater.)  LOVED it! Totally kid approved, they liked that it was like a "taco." I liked that it let me feel less guilty about the chips I was eating as there was no carbs from bread.

Excellent low-carb recipe!  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of the parsley where we used dried parsley flakes instead of fresh parsley - just because it's what we had on-hand, still turned out fine.  Great either on a salad or in a wrap.

I have made this salad twice now this summer.  Both were hits.  I have to admit, I hate it when writers say how wonderful a recipe was only to say they made all these changes but here I go.  I love the addition of bacon to the salad but I really like to add fruit to give a sweetness and a variety of textures.  I added sliced green olives, sliced red grapes, pineapple and walnuts.  The lemon and Worcestershire sauce gives a nice zing. My Bunco and Beach friends were very complimentary.  Thanks Brit!

I enjoyed eating this, but I did not enjoy making it. I'm not a chef or even a great cook. I cook so we can eat. It took me two hours to make this. With all the chopping done the old fashioned way, it took a ton of effort. I'm exhausted! I agree that using one half cup of mayonnaise is sufficient. I'm not sure I'll make it again, which is a shame since this is a really good recipe. If i every get better at chopping, I'll certainly make it again.

I made this using Bacon Bits instead of frying bacon. Left out the tomatoes but used sliced cherry tomatoes as garnishment on my plate of chicken salad atop a bed of lettuce. Looked and tasted awesome!

Very good! I tore the lettuse up and mixed it all together in order to coat all of the lettuce. We also used mayo that had olive oil in it. We may try it on regular salad next time! Over all, good recipe! Definitely worth trying!

YUM! I brought this for lunch when I visited a friend with a new baby. We devoured it!! The only changes I made were omitting the celery and green onion (don't like them), adding garlic powder, chopping the avocado and mixing it right in with the chicken, and serving it with the lettuce in wrapped sandwiches. Made a fruit salad to serve on the side. A delicious lunch!!! Thank you Britt!

This was pretty good, though maybe not quite as good as I expected.  I left out the avocado since I don't care for it, and I prefer iceburg lettuce.  Although I didn't end up liking it on the lettuce anyway and ate the rest without it.  It seems like it ought to be easy, but I dislike chopping stuff, so bit of a hassle from my point of view.

Great lunch!  Yummy and easy.  I made this on Sunday for a week's worth of work lunches for myself.  Portioned the chicken mixture into 5 containers, and then portioned the lettuce into 5 separate containers so it won't get soggy and nasty.  I omitted the avocado due to personal preference.  This dressing is very good - thanks!

I ommitted the bacon because it is just not healthy and necessary.  Also I couldn't find any worchestershire sauce in the house so ommitted that.  I added 1 finely chopped jalapeno because I like spicy foods and capsicum the spicy chemical helps burn calories.  This was really delicious and filling.  I served it for 4 guests and they all loved it.

My entire family LOVED this.  I used a lemon pepper, rotisserie chicken, and I mixed the avocado into the dressing.  We ate it on homemade pita bread and my 2 and 4 year old devoured it!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I really, really like this chicken salad.  The bacon really adds a great flavor.  And the avocado is a MUST!  If you want to save a little $, poach one chicken breast and three skinless boneless chicken thighs.  Once you chop them all up and mix them together in the salad, it tastes the same as it would if it were all breast (though maybe a little more fattening).

We always make wraps w/ this at our house and whenever my husband brings it to work, ppl think he bought the sandwich at a local gourmet deli! Great way to use our left-over chicken- I like to mash the avocado right into the salad so its not too over powering, but still gives that flavor to the dish. :-)

This was ok. My husband LOVES chicken salad and he said "it was fine". I don't know if I'll make it again or not. Not that it was bad, but it just wasn't all that great either.

Really good!  My husband and son love this salad.  I left out the avocado (son hates them) and used canned chicken that I had in the pantry, and it turned out just great!  I definately recomend it!

I have made this twice in two days.  Both times I omitted avocado, but, that was for choice.  The first time I made it, it was excellent!  The second time I made it, I added chopped slivered almonds...oh, good heavens was it good!  Forgot to add that I did use a Rotisserie Chicken for the chicken...more flavor!

The combination was really tasty. I was looking for a salad that combined both romaine and avocado. I left out the chicken because it was used as an appetizer salad. I would like to make it as a wrap as some others suggestd.

this recipe was delicious!  I am in phase 1 of the South Beach Diet and was able to use this recipe!  (i scooped it on top of salad for an excellent lunch!)
I don't care for celery, so i did dice up some dill pickle spears and replaced the celery with those.  I used turkey bacon and light mayo and it was still excellent!
i'm looking forward to trying it with the avocado (didn't have any on hand).
thanks for sharing!

Made this as written and it was outstanding! Tasted just like a great BLT sandwich.  The only thing I found was it was a little thick, so added a bit more lemon juice to thin it out a bit.  I also skipped the avocado as this is something I'm not that big a fan of.

If you want to make this a touch healthier, substitute Plain Greek Yogurt for the mayo. I just made a batch of the dressing with yogurt, juice of half a lemon and 1% milk to get the consistency right and it is superb! In a carton in my fridge for lunch salads and a veggie dip!

Thanks for a great recipe!

This may be our new favorite summer salad.  You don't just have to use romaine lettuce, this goes well with any type of salad green or great as a wrap.

A great low carb meal! Consider switching the parsley for cilantro and add cucumbers, cubed green apples and a dash of  curry powder...yummy in my tummy.

Love the dressing.  I didn't have any lemon so I used Lemon Pepper and some lime juice.  Turned out very well.  Next time I will have to add more bacon and it will be perfect.  Everyone enjoyed it.

This is a great summer salad with good flavor. I think it needs a generous portion of salt and next time I think I'll add something to add crunch...seeds or croutons. I used leftover grilled chicken and leftover pork tenderloin as my meat. Added a few more avocados because we love them. The bowl was gone at the end of the night. Husband and two teen aged boys all loved it.

I mixed Miracle Whip with sour cream for the dressing and added a little garlic powder and garlic salt. I used no regular salt. I tore the romaine leaves and made it like regular salad and served it in a salad bowl.

Could be good, but you'd have to play with the seasoning.  I thought it was rather bland.  Miracle Whip would probably help or adding a bit of sugar.  Has potential, but was not impressed with this version of the recipe.

Of course I couldn't follow the recipe. Is that even allowed? No romaine in the house. I was really looking for a recipe that I could use up the chicken I had thawed for last night and not  cooked. Since we were going for a bike ride, it had to be picnic-able, so I went for a chicken salad. I marinaded my chicken breasts for 45 minutes or so in lemon juice with a dash of Worcestershire, then grilled and diced them.I burned the bacon because I was trying to do too many things at once, but it didn't hurt anything. I did have parsley,  green onions, and tomato, so I used them along with some red cabbage that clamored to be included. No mayo, so the dressing became a dash of brown mustard, a couple dollops of miracle whip, some Ken's Vidalia Onion dressing, and some Beets All Ranch dressing. Added some grated parmesan just because parmesan. At the picnic table we wrapped them in tortillas and devoured them. Thanks for the inspiration and guidance! My wife insisted that I add this to my favorites.

Still a bit of a newbie in the kitchen but made this tonight in about 45 minutes top-to-bottom and it was a hit. Tried it on both a slider bun and on a bed of spinach--both were great. This is definitely going in the repeat pile.

I made this chicken salad and I loved it! It was a light dinner but very satisfying. I made it on whole wheat toast instead of  the Romain lettuce and omitted the celery because my husband doesn’t like it.  I was considering leaving out the bacon...but
everything is better with bacon!  
Thanks for this delicious recipe.

This recipe is fantastic. I made it for two and only adjusted the salt and pepper.  I however added a little bit more of lemon juice. It is perfect! As someone suggested, it is a great fill for a wrap. This recipe is a winner and a very good summer recipe. I will make it again!

Good Recipe! Like so many AllRecipe followers certain new recipes "speak" to me when read ..... as did this one. We made it exactly as written. It was flavorful, moist, and we enjoyed it, but it lacked any boldness. I think we will make it again and will consider either cayenne added to the mayo or a few chopped jalapenos.

Really easy to make, with minimal effort needed. So good, even my picky eater kids asked for seconds. I ended up mixing the avocado into the salad instead of serving it on the side. Makes plenty enough to serve a hungry family of four and still have leftovers. Big thumbs up!

Delicious and simple! It's like a BLT but without the bread and with chicken! Great with Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner as you can add in the turkey/chicken scraps from the giblets.

The ingredients are very simple but they marry beautifully with each other. I always loved tomato with mayo as the acidity cuts through the fattiness.

It is a great recipe if you eat all of it in one sitting.  It does not retain the great flavors over night in a refrigerator.  I would make it again.

This is a perfect summer lunch.  The combination of flavors with the creamy dressing was very good.  I chilled it for a couple of hours before eating it.  Very refreshing! I liked it so much that I think I'll make it again this week.

We loved this recipe!  I only had canned chicken, about 1 1/2 cups and filled in with 4 hard boiled eggs.  I added 8 or 9 thinly sliced  pimento stuffed green olives, and a dash of smoked paprika  to the mayo.  This recipe, with occasional variations, will be my go-to chicken salad recipe.

I would add more bacon and tomatoes. Also, extra dressing would be nice. The greens needed a bit. To preserve extra salad, only add avocado to what is being served. 
Delicious salad!

I love this however, I used a ranch dressing and added blue cheese crumbles. It does taste good as a salad or a wrap. Very versatile.

I did add some breaded chicken to the mix as I didn't feel there was quite enough when I adjusted the servings.  It needs something  else so I added Ranch dressing to the finished product which helped the flavors.

We made it as listed. Used an heirloom tomato because we could. We had leftover chicken from the crockpot and leftover bacon (three slices). This is quick and easy and great for a hot summer night. Great recipe!

I didn't use celery, don't much care for it and hubby doesn't like it at all, I used parsley and chives seasoning instead of fresh. But it turned out very good. Even hubby liked it and he's picky. Will try to have fresh parsley sometime, Will make this again.Oh forgot I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. Don't like mayo.

Yum, this was so good!  So refreshing to serve in the lettuce cups on a hot day.  I went by the recipe and thought it needed a little more seasoning and I added in some garlic and onion powders.  I didn't have avocado but I know it would of been delicious in this.  I let it sit about 45 min. before eating and it was nice a flavorful and I loved the bacon in it.  I will be having the leftovers today for lunch.  I think this would be delicious served in tortillas layered with lettuce, if you wanted something a little more filling.  I do think next time I will also replace a little bit of the mayo with sour cream.  Overall it was great!  Thank you for the recipe!

I used more than 3 cups of grilled chicken, turkey bacon, about half cup of mayo and more than 2 table spoons of green onion and lemon juice. I used plum tomatoes and deseeded them. This was an excellent and easy meal to prepare. I wished I had more parsley...

I cut the recipe in half so that I could use a leftover roasted chicken breast.  Even though my proportions were probably a little off, we really enjoyed this salad.  I will definitely make it again!

This chicken salad is delicious!! I make it often and everybody loves it. I made just a few small changes: I used 1 tsp. dried parsley and 1 tablespoon chopped green onion instead of 2 (I'm not a huge fan of strong onion flavor). I cooked my chicken in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes. I used 3 boneless breasts (trimmed and tenderized just a little with a meat mallet) and drizzled with olive oil, seasoned with salt & pepper. it turns out firm but tender. I like chunks in my chicken salad.

This was delicious and easy! Loved the bacon in it. Used what we had in the house, so no green onions but used red onions and they were a great addition. Not a huge fan of parsley, so we used basil. All and all, really great receipe. Thanks for sharing!

Followed this recipe to a T, except added an extra 2 slices of bacon.  Served on toast with romaine and avocado.  Delicious.  Perfect summer salad and a great way to use those garden fresh tomatoes.

Loved it. Made it without the celery which my wife doesn't eat. Added a little more Worcestershire than a dash as we're big fans...Great light meal that was super delicious.

Great easy recipe!  My husband loved it.  There are so many ways you could add your own touch to it...add some grated cheese, black beans, tortilla shreds, dried fruits.  Thanks for sharing.

I can't even talk about how good this chicken salad is!  It is simple and so pretty!  I used red onion instead of green onion, a rotisserie chicken, light miracle whip and bacon that is already cooked.  Everything else stayed the same and my Book Club group loved it!  Thanks, Britt!

The Worcestershire and lemon give it just the right zip. I seasoned my chicken while cooking, used miracle whip, omitted the avocado, served over iceburg with a side of cucumbers and crusty bread. Oh, and added a little shredded cheese on top. Very refreshing!

Not bad...  I sauted some onion with the bacon and added grapes.  It needed more mayo.  I may have used more than 3 cups of chicken.  I'll make it again!

Tastes very good.  I did not have tomato, green onion or avocado, so those were omitted.  I used celery salt also.  The bacon gives the recipe a great flavor. If you have articoke, you can also try that.

Yummy chicken salad.  I omitted the celery (don't like it) and the avocado (too high in calories), and used extra light mayo.  Very tasty!  Makes a simple lunch.  Thanks.

I really enjoyed this salad, especially with fresh garden tomatoes and the avocado in it!  The Worcestershire sauce jazzes up the mayo dressing just a little bit.  It was a light, refreshing lunch and uses ingredients that most people have on hand.    Only thing I omitted was the celery.

i used this chicken salad instead of putting it on top of lettuce i used a flour tortilla wrap i also added garlic powder along with all the other ingredients, i even mixed my avocado in the chicken mix  that gave a wonderful taste.

This was not a wow for me.  I used a rotisserie chicken and then followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe too much mayo for my taste.

This was just okay. I guess I was thinking it would have a more savory flavor. It seamed a bit bland to me. It was good though just not great. Thanks for the recipe though.

I had too much wine and forgot the avocado!!  Ugh, the best part.  This was a wonderful salad and I will make it again.  I would probably have deserved 5 stars, had I not forgotten the avocado.

My husband and all five of my young children (ages 10 down to 1 yo)liked this very much. And so did I. I used all the ingredients and quantities as listed in the recipe, except my grocery store had avocados that were not yet ripe, so we missed that dimension of the dish. I think I may try this at our church's weekly potluck sometime...

This is outstanding! I have made this quite a few times and am always asked for the recipe. I left the avocado out as we dont care for them. Cant wait until summer when I can use fresh tomatoes and chives from my garden again!
