This will be my house garlic bread from now on!  I made mostly as written (ommiting the salt), but it made a lot of the butter spread... I would recommend not using it all, as it made the bread a little greasy and soggy.  Use just enough to cover the bread, and it turns out crispier.  A great taste, and the recipe was requested!

Very very good.  We eat garlic bread a lot (stale hotdog and hamburger buns work wonderfully in a pinch), and this was a great change.  I used italian seasoning instead of sage and oregano, and I used Miracle Whip instead of standard mayo.  Also, I used garlic powder instead of cloves of garlic.

This bread was good, but I found the oregano a little over powering.  Next time, I would cut it in half.  The cheese on top is great and the mayonnaise gives it a little extra tang.  I also left the salt out of mine.

This was fantastic.  It's my new favorite recipe for garlic bread.  I think the reason everyone says its so salty is because of the butter - perhaps if unsalted butter were used, there would be more control over the amount of salt.  I used regular (salted) butter and just a big pinch of salt, and it was fine.  I added an extra dollop of mayo and a squeeze of lemon juice as well.  Overall, I loved this and will be making it a lot.  Thanks for a great new recipe!!

I like to take the butter mixture, and melt a couple tablespoons full. Then I toss it with some bread cubes, and bake at 425 for 15-20 minutes, stirring once or twice. Makes the best croutons, and they keep well in a zip loc bag for about a week.

This is the best garlic bread I ever made and I tried alot of other recipes. My whole family loved it. I used half the pepper and next time will use half the salt.

This was SOOO salty it wasn't even funny - a bit of a waste of time and effort.  I cut the recipe in half, so I only added a 1/2 tsp of salt...I'm a salt lover and this was just too much.  I gave it two stars because I think with the amount of salt reduced, this might be good.  I will make again, but not add any salt.  I think it's also worthwhile to mention that I added about 1 tsp of (bottled) lemon juice as well - to cut through the intensity of the garlic.

I made this to go along with our pasta dinner (Brian's Favorite Sauce), also found on this site.  I absolutely loved it.  I didn't have any french bread, so I used this on regular toast.  I didn't add any sage but I don't think it matters much. I really think it's the combination of mayo, parmesan and oregano that give this such a good flavor. Hubby and son had plain garlic toast. I can't wait to try this on a french baguette.  Thanks Sharon.

Been making this for years!  I only make half the spread for a french bread.  Half a cup is waaayyy too much for one loaf of bread.

This turned out delicious!  I used minced garlic out of a jar, used margarine instead of butter, added chopped sundried tomatoes to the margarine mixture, omitted the sage, and made half the recipe, which was enough to cover one sliced french baguette.  It was a big hit and everyone had seconds and thirds.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this on the day before I went grocery shopping and I have a habit of as-you-go cooking, so I tweaked this recipe a bit. I left out the sage, used four cloves of garlic instead of three (I also minced it instead of chopping), used Italian seasoning instead of Oregano, used a bit less salt, since I didn't have any Parmesan cheese on hand, I used this "Parmesan and Herb" seasoning I had instead since it was the closest thing I had, and I used regular white bread instead of a baguette. I also changed the amount of ingredients I used since I was only cooking for me and one other person.

When all was said and done, I absolutely LOVED this bread. The only complaint I have is that there wasn't any left over after we were done eating. It's the best garlic bread that I've ever had and I honestly don't ever see myself ever buying pre-made, frozen garlic bread ever again.

Simple and different. I left out the sage (didn't have any) and added a bit of basil and parsley. It was a hit with my guests and paired great with both marinara and alfredo.

since it was just a dinner for two, I had to recalculate the ingredients ... took the base of the butter, garlic (minced) and mayo (hellmens).. used Italian seasoning instead of oregano/sage ... like the flavor of the mix better ... just personal preference. Tasted it, added some salt and pepper to my taste ... I also added some dried parsley ... buttered up some Italian sliced bread ... and BAM ... some of the best garlic bread I've had!!!  Great idea with the mayo ... my mother worked in a dinner in the 50s, they used mayo alot in place of butter for grilled sandwhiches ... never put the two together!  Thanks a Million!!!!!!!

This recipe was great!  I was looking for something a little bit different than my normal garlic bread when I stumbled on this recipe.  The only thing I did different, was to leave the salt out (after reading other reviews).  I used salted butter and it was plenty salty.  You will not regret making this garlic bread!

i didnt add the salt and found it didnt need it. i used leftover hotdog buns and regular hellmans mayo. i like the kick the mayo gives it. i used fresh parm cheese too and that helped. four stars because as is i can see this would be way too salty.

This is absolutely the best garlic bread ever!  I buy a huge country oven French bread (Kroger).  Prepare the baguette and cut it in half.  I wrap the other half (top and bottom) in foil and freeze.  That way I have 2, one for dinner and one for a future dinner.  Before putting the garlic bread in the oven, I top it with mozzarella cheese.  It is amazing!  Every time I make it, people ask for the recipe.

Delicious!! We were grilling out, so I followed the recipe almost exactly (I used low-fat mayo and  forgot to top with Parmesan) and then wrapped the loaf of bread in foil and threw it on the grill for about 10 minutes. Yum!

So easy, but the bottom of the bread was too soft.  I think next time I'll cook it at a lower temp and for longer before broiling.

I thought this was pretty good - But hubby thought it was okay. I skipped the salt, pepper, amd parmeasean (sp) becuase I did not have any. Instead I used shredded mozzerella cheese after it browned - I really liked it :)

Fantastic! Or I guess I should say "fantastique!" We really loved this bread. It is so much like Pepperidge Farm cheese garlic bread (from the freezer section at the grocery store). The addition of the mayo and oregano is perfect. I used a reduced-fat margarine and skipped the salt and it was absolutely the best cheesy garlic bread I've made.

This was very good, and I think the spread could've covered 2 baguettes.  I still have some of the mixture left over, which makes my family very happy.......because that means we'll have it again soon.

I've made this twice and like it very much, but it was noticably better with one important change:  I used 3 *bulbs* of garlic rather than 3 cloves, and roasted the bulbs for 30 minutes (drizzled with olive oil) before using them.

Very yummy. I prefer to bake the bread for about 10-12 minutes because I like it crunchy and then finish off by broiling it for a few minutes to crisp and brown the top.

This. Was. AWESOME.

I "trashed" it up a bit, using ingredients I could afford. I used
cheap store brand white bread and margerine spread. I skipped the salt,
as I thought it would be salty enough with the combination of parmesan cheese
and margerine and bypassed the sage. 
I cut back a bit on the other spices,
as I have three boys at home who aren't big on a lot of spices in their food.
This made quite a bit of spread, so I
saved the rest to use at a later date.

Really good. The mayo adds a little tang
and it really reminds me of restaraunt
garlic bread. 

This is now my new go-to recipe for garlic bread. Thanks SO much to the person who posted it.

EDITED 06/22/08: I will say that this 
not only a good bread for an egg sandwich, but it is also good in a pinch
with a hungry husband for leftover speghetti sandwiches!

This stuff was soo easy and good!  I didn't have sage, so I used Thyme and it still tasted wonderful!  I also used some fresh rolls because the store was out of french bread.  I made the mixture the night before I actually used it so the flavors could really meld together.  There were no leftovers!

This really is FANTASTIC!  I was skeptical with the mayo, but it's one of the best garlic breads I've ever made.  I omitted the sage and parmesan (didn't have any) and used jarred minced garlic.  A definite keeper!

This recipe was ok but I thought the mayo was a bit strange. I actually substituted miracle whip instead. Plus I didn't have sage so I just left that out. I actually liked the amount of oregano. If I'm in a pinch, I may make it again...
For some reason this tastes much better the next day...

Very good.  I find, however, that toasting/grilling/broiling the bread first avoids the soggy problem.  Stays crisp and delicious.

This is a fast delicious recipe for garlic bread, the difference is there is a slight tang which makes it so much better than regular garlic bread. Now I make this in place of my old garlic bread recipe.

This is the first recipe I have ever reviewed here and that is because of how awesome this recipe is! The ingredients sound so weird but it is so yummy! The only thing I change is that I use roasted garlic instead of the raw garlic and I used Italian seasoning in place of the oregano and sage (basically because I was out of both when I made the recipe the first time!). It is the only garlic bread I ever make anymore. Thank for the amazing recipe!

This was actually really delicious. The oregano was a little over-powering, so i would definitely down it to half.

This is great!  The only thing I did different because it's all I had was to use a 4 cheese blend instead of straight parmesan.  It was yummy, and I'm sure it would have been just as good with parm.  Really easy to make and a nice change from regular garlic bread that's just made with butter and garlic.

Excellent recipe and easy.  I omittted sage and cut salt in half. Also I sliced the bread, spread butter mixture on one side. I placed them on a cookie sheet butter side up and toasted in oven preheated to 375 to toast the bottoms slightly and then broiled until lighly browned on top. This helped not to have bread soggy as others had described.

I made this garlic bread with pasta for dinner last night. I mixed the parmasan cheese into the butter mixture and spread that on and topped it with a mix of shredded cheese that had garlic and herbs in it. Very tasty! We both loved it!

I like this garlic bread. First time I made it I had added the 2 t parmesan cheese to the mixture before putting on the bread, then I added more cheese on top. This is my second time first on french bread now on hoggie rolls, based on other comments that it is good on any bread

I use this with any kind of sliced bread I have on hand, and it works great.  Scaled down to 3 (original recipe halved), with 5 slices of bread, I have just the right amount for my family of 2 adults and 2 small children.  I also omit the sage and cut the oregano to half.  My picky kids love it.

I never would have thought to use mayonaise to make garlic bread, but what a difference it made.  Overall, the bread is very yummy.  The only thing that kept this from 5 stars is that it is a bit on the "greasy" side (thus making it a bit soggy) when prepared as listed in the recipe.  I used a pastry brush and went over the bread less heavily, and that seemed to do the trick.

What a great idea to add the mayo, it makes a difference.  My family loved this and there were no left overs.  I served it with Donna's Lasagna.

This is super good however, I have made it twice and the first time I followed the directions exactly and found it way too salty. So, the second time I left out the salt all together and it was SO good. The butter has enough salt in it so you really dont need it. Thanks for the recipe! We will be using this for now on!!

I was hesitant to use mayo as it sounded kinda odd but it turned out to be very flavorful and received rave reviews from the family. No more prepackaged Texas Toast for us!

TOO MUCH SALT! I love salt, and this was way too much for me. The underlying flavor was really good though. I will try not adding any salt next time.

Yup, a little too much oregano, and, frankly, a little too much butter/mayo overall. I'm eating it on whole wheat baguette from the bakery where I work, and I can taste the butter practically dripping out of the bread whenever I take a bite. But darn is it good! :)

Fantastique is right!  I had a large round loaf of Italian bread.  I eyeballed the oregano so as not to overdo and also used parsley flakes.  I served with Chili by George!! for Opening Game Day today and there is very little of either left.  Very yummy!

This was very good.  I think I prefer it without the sage.  But overall it is excellent! I used regular French bread instead of Baguette.

Wow!! I was kind of leery of the mayo, but don’t let it scare you away! This was so much better than I expected!  I used a seeded Italian loaf, cut the oregano down to 1/4 tsp (not a big fan of oregano) and added some dried basil. I ended up eating 3 pieces with dinner. This recipe could be trouble for me…bread is a huge downfall of mine!

This garlic bread was really good. I used homemade sourdough instead of french bread. I think next time I may use a little less of the spices, but overall a very good bread that I will continue to use. Thanks for sharing!

This garlic bread was great, though I felt the flavor of oregano was a bit too strong for my tastes so I would decrease that next time. I also didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder and no sage.

Really, really yummy.  It is SO much better then the foil-wrapped stuff at the grocery store and it only takes a few minutes more to make.  Perfect with Karen Marshall's Italian Sausage Soup.

Only some guess the sage, and no one realizes there's mayo. Just delicious - best garlic bread you'll ever make. Mixture keeps well in fridge too.

GREAT garlic bread ~ and it makes ALOT!! I used miracle whip instead of mayo for some extra zip and ommitted the sage since I didn't have any available. Went very well with our chicken dinner and would make this bread again. I think this also might make for a great appetizer!

I have made this twice.  Tonight will be the 3rd time.  I went straight by the recipe both times.  1st time it was wonderful!!  My son-in-law, who considers himself a home chef, couldn't believe it wasn't store bought cheese bread!  The 2nd time I made it I was thinking that if a little is good, a lot will be great!  Well I was wrong.  I put too much of the cheese mixture on the bread and it made it soggy.  So I will serve it again tonight and I will be sensible about the about of cheese mixture I put on the bread and it should be "fantastique!"

Hubby didn't care for this at all & I thought it was just ok.  The herbs just didn't do a thing for us as using garlic or Italian seasoning along with the cheese is much better.

Yummy!  Need to cut the amount of salt down, though.  I'll probably use half as much next time.

This was really good but it was too salty. Next time I will leave the salt out.

I did not read the reviews beforehand and made this exactly as specified. The bread turned out soggy and way too salty. I've had so many other versions that were so much better. I will not make this again.

This was great for my French bread.  I halved the recipe and didn't use as much salt as indicated.  I used basil instead of sage.  It turned out perfect with the French baguette recipe from this site.

This flavor was really good.  I did not have the french baguettes and I was looking for a recipe for Texas Toast that I had left over from breakfast.  I decided to try this and I guess I used to much spread on 6 slices because it was kinda soggy, but my kids loved it and the flavor was excellent.  It's a keeper.  Later tried on french baguette and it worked out perfectly.  Yum

Yummy.  I thought it was too salty, and I only used half of the amount of salt called for, and I used unsalted butter.  But my guests thought it was great.  But it was still really, really good.  Everyone still ate it up.  thanks for a great recipe.  I will make again.

This is so good, and so easy to make. I've made it at least ten times now and it always turns out delicious.  Just be sure you don't put too much on your bread, unless you like it really buttery.

Pretty good!  However, I only used: butter, minced garlic, oregano, 1/8 tsp. of garlic salt (instead of reg. salt) & a few pinches of pepper.  I also added a bit of paprika.  Using mayo seemed weird to me & I'm not a fan of mayo anyways, so I left it out. My boyfriend & I enjoyed it :-).

This is the best garlic bread recipe I've ever tried! The mayonnaise really makes this extra delicious, and normally I don't even eat mayonnaise. This bread just disappears when I make it for myself and my fiance. I cut the salt back, due to recommendations by others. I don't have any sage, so I skip that. Instead of oregano I add italian seasoning (because that's what I have). Even with the changes, it's delicious! May not be the healthiest garlic bread, but it is my favorite to make.

This garlic bread is really good, but I am not giving it five stars because it was waaaay too salty! I wish I'd read the reviews first, but as has been said: halve the salt, at least! Otherwise very tasty!

This was okay but a few small tweaks would make it better IMO.  As others said, cut down on the salt and pepper - I used a scant 1/4 teaspoon of each.  I also added another tablespoon of mayo to make it less greasy.  Great with "Simple Chicken Parmesan" from this site.

So quick and easy I made this up while my husband was washing up for dinner and setting the table.  Now instead of ordering the neighborhood pizza place bread sticks to go with spaghetti or lasagna I just whip this up.

Loved it! I wasn't sure b/c I hate Mayo so I only used 1 Tbs. It was better than Olive Garden!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly minus the sage because I didn't have it. I made it for a family dinner with lasagna and it was a huge hit. This recipe made enough for 2 baguettes so, you may want to make half for 1 baguette.

Made far, far more than I needed, so I froze the excess butter until the next time I wanted garlic bread.  I thought the sage could have been dropped by about 1/3-1/2.

UPDATE: I used this on Texas Toast and broiled it until it was golden. My hubby LOVED this bread. 
ORIGINAL REVIEW: This made too much butter spread for just 1 loaf of bread. It was tasty though and had a tang to it, maybe that's the mayo? Worth trying for sure, this was tasty. Thanks Sharon for sharing this!

Was a little hesitant at first with the mayo, but it turned out yummy.  Will make again, everyone loved it.  Maybe I'll add some mozzerella next time at the end.

This is our new favorite garlic bread.  I love the taste the sage adds to it.  This is more like something you would get in a restaurant.  Most garlic bread options taste like something you buy in the frozen section of a grocery store.  This is definitely worth making again and again and again!

Very yummy! I changed things though a little. First, I just wanted enough to cover a couple peices of home made french bread I made. So, I just eye balled my amounts. I ended up using almost equal amounts of butter and mayo. (Probably about 3tblsp each) For ease, I used Italian Seasoning. Worked great! So flavourful, and cooked up nice and crispy under the broiler. Will make again for sure!

I, too, had forgotten what previous reviewers had said about it being salty and followed the recipe as written.  While it was good, it was way too salty.  Also, I thought that the spread would be richer, given it has mayonnaise in it.  All in all, not bad, and my husband quite liked it. However, I will make this again with half the salt, and perhaps fresh herbs as opposed to dried.

I did not have any baguette bread, so we used our favorite (hot dog buns, split and placed open faced on a cookie sheet).  I cut the salt in 1/2, as others recommended, but added extra chopped garlic, garlic powder, extra parmesan, and a sprinkle of Alpine Touch seasoning. Delicious!!

I LOVED it!  And the flavor was excellent (I love lots of flavor in my foods, so this was excellent!).  The only suggestion I have is to cut back on the salt to about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon.  Otherwise, this was A+++++++++++++!!!!

I had forgotten what a previous reviewer had said about it being salty and put the full amount in. I thought it was still really good, but way too salty. I recommend cutting the salt at least in half or adding to taste. I will definitely make this again, but without all the salt. If it merits 5 stars, will edit the rating.
***edited to say that it was so much better eliminating the salt. I love this bread!

WOW!!!  Adding the mayonnaise with butter gives this a more full-bodied and complex flavor than your standard garlic bread recipe.  I made a loaf the other night for my house and it was absolutely devoured.  Kudos, Sharon

Very good.  I tried to spread this over 2 baguettes, and while I got good coverage, the final product would have been much more moist had I stuck to one roll.  We also thought that mozzerella or a pizza cheese mixture would have been nice rather than the parmesan.

We really enjoyed this. The only thing I would do different, is to use half the amount of oregano. It was a bit overpowering. It gave it a kick though,but will adjust to our taste. I will deffinately make this again and would serve it to guests.Was very tastey.Thanks Sharon!

I made this for a family dinner where I needed a lot of garlic bread. I kept almost everything as listed in the recipe except for the sage. I did not add the sage because I don't care for Sage flavor. Also, initially I thought it was a little on the salty side as well. As I've seen in several other reviews. But I added a little bit extra mayo and that totally took away from the saltiness of it. I was shocked. But it worked like a champ.

It was amazing. I made it up early and cooked it down a little bit and then let it cool and harden up again. That way I spread it on to the loaves of French bread like regular butter. It was so good! Getting ready right now to make some more of it up for a crab feed tonight for dipping the crab in. Love it love it love it!

Fantastic!!! Best Garlic Bread recipe ever!! No need for a meal... Just a pile of this delicious bread and a bottle of good red wine. I made no changes to the recipe because it doesn't need it.

My family loves this garlic bread.  I finally can duplicate the garlic bread at our favorite restaurant.  We have been going there for over 55 years!  I omit the cheese.

Sometimes I sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.

This was amazing! The whole family gobbled it up. I kind of just eyeballed the amounts, not as much butter, extra minced garlic, Italian seasoning, and a Parmesan blend. Beats store bought!

I made this easy recipe almost exactly as stated, I left out the sage because I did not have any, but otherwise I followed it to the letter.  We loved it and so did our guests.  I will be making this tasty garlic bread again this week.  Be sure to make plenty as it is gobbled up quickly and you will want to be sure to have enough for your family/guests and yourself.  I would be happy with just this yummy bread for dinner and a glass of wine... yep, it's that good ;))))

Followed the instructions pretty much as listed, just added a bit more garlic for my liking.  Loved it!  I even got a request from a family member for the recipe, he said it was the best garlic toast he's ever eaten.

Flavor was really good.  I put too little of the butter mixture on the bread so it came out dry so I won't do that next time.  Otherwise, yum!

This was definitely fantastique! I made it on a Beetroot and Chia Sourdough and it was to die for. The hubby wasn't a big fan (he's not a fan of sourdough) but my two girls loved it. Will make this again next time I'm having a BBQ.

Absolutely love this, and unashamedly pass it off as mine...I'm terribly sorry, I feel a little bad, but everyone LOVES this! Just on regular ol sliced bread out of the toaster, and its perfect.. by the way, this is great to do for spaghettti sandwiches! Just slap leftover cold spaghetti on fresh toasted garlic bread (which is so easy to have fresh because this lasts quite awhile in the fridge, and we always have sliced bread) and you have the best sandwich EVER! That's thanks to my Italian husband and his love of leftovers!

This is utterly amazing. All those times I thought I made garlic bread before were just hollow attempts compared to this recipe. I took a chance and almost left the mayo out because I thought it sounded weird, but that may seriously be the secret ingredient for greatness. For everyone who thought it was too salty, remember that Parmesan cheese is salty and depending on the butter you use, that might be salty too. If you're using salty cheese and butter, definitely cut back on the amount of extra salt you use. I recommend mixing all the ingredients except the salt, tasting it, and then adding extra salt accordingly. Do yourself a favor and make this. It's incredible.

I made it just as written the first several times....so-o-o good. Now, sometimes I up the savory herbs & spices (except the salt)...it just gets better & better. The wonderful part is any leftovers can go into an empty sour cream or yogurt container then back into the refrigerator....means you can make just a couple of slices of good bread into yummy garlic bread to go with your lunch salad.

The most PERFECT, scrumptious garlic bread EVER!!! This is now a definite request from my family for all family events. Your family will be amazed, and there won't even be one crumb left over!!! I guarantee it!
As a bonus, this makes way more butter mixture than you need, so I store the extra in the fridge, and the next time I want to make it, I just pull out the butter mix from the fridge and leave it on the counter to come to room temp, and go from there. EASY PEASY, and soooooo DELICIOUS!!!!

After readng some reviews decided to try this with a couple of small changes.  You definitly will not want to use all the salt called for as even with just a pinch it was still noticable.  Next time will try without adding any.  I did reduce the sage by half but may try a bit more next time.  
I served this for company and it got rave reviews all around.  It had full flavor went together very quick and wqs the only thing served to be eaten up.
This will be the only garlic bread recipe I make.

Try adding onions to this recipe...either dehydrated (re-hydrated) or fresh onions that are sauteed. One of our favorite restaurants serves a very similar bread and they were gracious enough to share the recipe...only difference is the onions...yummy!

This was good! I did reduce the salt, and oregano (personal preference), but followed the recipe otherwise. I really liked the sage in this. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought this was delicious!  I loved the flavor the sage added.  I did not find this to be overly salty, as others have stated- perhaps because I always use unsalted butter?  It was terrific served with spaghetti and meatballs.  Oh, I also made my own French baguette from scratch, which surely made it all the more tasty- can't beat fresh, homemade bread :)

Really good! I decreased the butter by half, used 1 very large clove of garlic and reduced the spices by half as well. Delicious! I did wrap the bread loosely in foil to bake. Kids loved it...thanks!

Absolutely fantastic!!! I used my own seasonings to taste (what ever looked good at the time) and would omit the salt next time, that said, it was still addicting. The loaf didn't last more than a few hours.

Amazing recipe, extremely tasty!  I omitted the sage entirely and just used oregano.  I didn't read the reviews first and used all the salt that it called for.  I got a little nervous after I read the reviews, but can't say that I would change anything or cut the salt next time I make.  DELICIOUS!

Very delicious recipe I must say. My kids loved them so much that they didn't bother with the other prepared items for dinner. For those who's going to try this one, I would suggest omitting the salt. Since the mayo & perhaps the butter already have the sodium you need.

This bread was unreal it was so good! My roommate was a little skeptical at the addition of mayonnaise but couldn't taste it in the final product. We didn't have sage but it still tasted great!! I selfishly took half a loaf as an accompaniment to my meals the next day. Awesome and easy! thanks!!

I made half of the butter mixture, cutting back on the oregano by half.  And I mixed the parmesan in rather than sprinkling it on top.  I used just a few slices of French baguette, toasting them on both sides under the broiler, allowing them to cool and then spreading them with the butter mixture and popping them under the broiler.  This was just ok.  Even though I cut back on the oregano, I still thought it was too much.  I have leftovers of the butter mixture, so maybe I’ll try adding some mozzarella or provolone to see if that helps.

Just made this recipe to go with lasagna, WOW it's a keeper!  The only things I changed was to omit the salt and instead of sage and oregano I used a dipping spice from Mazzaro's Italian Market in St. Pete FL.  It is one of the best garlic bread recipes I've tried and all the others are going in the recycle bin!  Thanks for a great recipe

I was surprised when I found this recipe. I've been making this bread for years with just the mayo and parmesan cheese and its great! Everyone loves it. I'll have to try adding the seasonings next time. I've used sandwich rolls, thick bread (like for french toast) and french bread and its always wonderful.

We thought this was 5 stars all the way. I left a section w/o cheese for one of my children who doesn't like cheese. He really liked the recipe. The rest of us had cheese on ours and it was gobbled up in no time.

I love this bread, and use this recipe always for making garlic bread.  Omit the salt in the recipe though, it isn't needed.  Recipe makes a lot of spread-I wouldn't suggest using it all on one half a baguette.

Sweet.   Made this bread on a French baguette. I took everything and added it into a bowl.  (Doubled the garlic, of course) sliced the bread lengthwise, then I grilled the 2 opened slices of bread on my big green egg until it was nice and smoky-about 1 minute. I then proceeded to slice the 2 loaves in half and cut 2 slits down the center for maximum garlic butter concoction absorption. The result was fantastic. I finished this bread by putting it back together and grilling it on my Big Green Egg (The BGE) at 300 for about 10 minutes in foil. Smokey, garlic, carb. Jesus Christ!

I varied it w/1 t. oregano & 1 t. basil. Also, I mix the parm right in, and often use a 3-cheese blend of parm, asiago & romano sold at most stores. To be really decadent, I sometimes top w/shredded mozzarella - makes a great stand-along appetizer that way.

Delicious! I did not use nearly as much butter as the recipe called for...used about 3 T butter spread and 1 T Mayo, and I omitted the salt altogether because the butter added enough salt for me. I also mixed the parmesan cheese in with the spread, and then sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top. It was fantastic!! The mayo was really an awesome addition to traditional garlic bread recipes.  I only gave 4 stars because I think that 1/2 cup of butter would have been way excessive, and the recipe really does not need any extra salt.

Very good.  A bit too salty as others indicated.  I will eliminate the salt next time since I use salted butter.  Watch the bread carefully when it's under the broiler.  I burned the first batch.  I was glad I had another loaf of bread :)

Yum. This is so great. Just be careful not to burn it. 4 minutes under my broiler was almost too much. It would be a shame to ruin such great bread! Caution: be sure your butter is soft enough so you can really blend all the ingredients well.

UPDATE: MADE AGAIN TONIGHT, BUT THIS TIME, I SLICED MY ITALIAN LOAF IN HALF AS DIRECTED, MINCED MY GARLIC AND SPRINKLED WITH SHREDDED MOZZA - EVEN BETTER THIS WAY!!! Pretty good (if I do say so myself!)!!! I had some French baugette leftover from Sun. night's dinner that needed using up, so I decided to give this a try. With a few modifications, I think this has potential to become my "tried & true" stand-by recipe for sure! The recipe I have been using for yrs. is pretty basic - butter, garlic, parsley and Parm mixed together. I like the fact that Mela's recipe is "kicked" up a notch. The mayo and sage are perfect (who knew?)! I did not find this to be salty at all, but I used unsalted butter, so that could be why (?). My only changes were slicing my baugette into med-thick slices as opposed to halving it lengthwise as directed (I wasn't paying attention when I cut my bread into slices!) and mixing the Parm cheese into my butter mixture. Oh, and I drizzled each slice with a bit of EVOO in hopes that everything would "crisp" up a bit (and it did - nicely!). It took exactly 4.5 min. to broil to perfection in my oven. I can't wait to try this with a bit of mozzarella or Italian-blend cheese melted on top, on thick slices of Texas Toast or for meatball sandwiches... yum, yum! My only suggestion for next time (and there will be one!) would be to mince rather than chop my garlic (personal preference), but I still think this is EXCELLENT as is!!! Thanks for sharing, Mela :)

Overall very good.  As the other reviews said I would definitley reduce or omit the salt and reduce the Oregano.  Both were very overpowering. Even though I used unsalted butter it was way to much.

This is a great garlic bread. I used fresh sage as that's all I had on hand. I used salted butter and the full amount of salt called for and we did not think it was salty at all. Thx for the great recipe.

Agreed with all of the other reviews that it was GOOD, but too salty. I really liked the butter/mayo mixture, but will omit the salt next time.

Best garlic bread!!! Tastes like the garlic bread Costco used to sell, but discontinued several years ago. Love it! I'm always asked for the recipe.

This was just ok. Not really worth the extra fat/calories that the mayo adds.

According to my boyfriend "This is the BEST garlic bread I have EVER had!" I thought so too. I did change a few things. I did not have Sage so I used Italian Seasoning. I also used the Parmisan/Romano Cheese blend that comes in the bottle. I would reccomend it. I also cut the Oregano back like the others suggested.

Really good. My two-year-old son ate two pieces. I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, and instead of broiling it, I baked it at 400 for about 12 minutes. Thanks for sharing. Will make again.

YUMMY!!!  I've made this a few times and everyone loves it!  Although, the first time I made it, it was much too salty, so I no longer add salt.  Also, I've never used sage...only because I didn't have any.  And it's DELICIOUS!!!

Very good, though I rate it lower than Parmesan Garlic Bread, also available at the allrecipes website. I use the broiler so rarely that I have to be especially careful that I don't get sidetracked and burn the bread. The combination of spices, mayo, and butter is hard to beat.

There was way too much Oregano in this recipe for me - it turned the bread green, which was actually kind of funny :) Also, it doesn't need the salt at all.  I am going to try it again with less oregano and more salt, and I'm sure it will be perfect.

Overall, it was very good.  I would reccomend reducing the oregano and salt.  The loaf of bread I used was a little on the small side so keep that in mind when preparing.

The best garlic bread recipe that I have found and very simple to make but I do suggest leaving out the sauce until you taste the mixture and then salt to taste, I left my salt out. This mixture also makes wonderful dipping sauce for bread sticks and pizza.

This was very good! I didn't have sage so I skipped it. Cut the oregano in half, but I still thought it was over-powering and will probably use even less next time. Will also try shredded mozzarella cheese next time. YUM!

After reading other reviews, I cut back on the oregano, omitted the salt and spread the mixture on a crusty peasant bread - it was the best! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This garlic bread was delicious and easy to prepare.  I was a little bit shy of 1/2 cup on the butter, so I added a bit of olive oil.  It turned out very well- I will definitely make this again.  Watch the edges of the bread so as not to burn!

This is really good - next time I will use fresher bread, and less oregano.  I also think topping it with some shredded mozzarella and crushed red pepper would really be great!

I made this to go along with To Die for Fettuccine Alfredo. It was super great but the oregano was kinda overpowering. I should've reduced it a tinch but I followed the recipe exactly. The hubby raved about it all evening and said I should make this everytime we have pasta. I'll be making this OFTEN.

We really liked this. Had a small dinner so I used a leftover hamburger bun as the bread and basicly just used the idea of this recipe and threw together a good spoonful of mayo, bout a teaspoon of butter, a good pinch of oregano, and a few dashes of garlic powder and parm cheese. Then I nuked it so it would melt a little bit, mixed it up and spread it on before broiling for 5 mins. Yum! I will do it this way next time but add more parm & lots more garlic. And the sage if I restock. Good stuff, will use this one a LOT!

I thought this would be a great recipe for us. We love garlic bread from the bag. The kids went crazy for the recipe. I think I would rather go with the store bought kind. It is very salty. I wish I would have listened to other posters. And the oregano is overpowering. I had an issue with my broiler. I burned the first one I made because I plan to cook for 5 minutes in my broiler. At 4 minutes, my fire alarm went off. 2 minutes is all I needed in my oven. So be watchful! Good recipe but not worth the time.

I could have just eaten this all by itself dipped in tomato pasta sauce!  I added Parmesan cheese to the mayo-butter mixture and also sprinkled more on top.

Guess I am in the minority here, but wasn't a big fan of this.  Maybe added a little too much parmesean cheese, but 5 minutes under the broiler was too long, started burning at 3 1/2.  Scraped off the burnt parts, and it tasted OK.  Probably won't make it again, but thanks anyway!

Very easy and delicious!  I omitted the salt, and used basil and oregano.   even used a light butter spread instead of real butter (though I did spring for the real mayo).  Made half on plain baguette, half on multi-grain.  My husband, who doesn't like "stuff" on his bread ate all the plain!  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful.  I was looking for a recipe we called "puff bread" at a restaurant I used to work at.  This was not it, but it was fairly close.  I didn't have a baguette, so used a high quality  but regular bread.  The bread wasn't substantial enough to hold the mixture and fell apart when eating, but who could mind when it tasted so good?  I was shocked to find I didn't have sage, but we loved it anyway.  I don't even think it needs the parmesan.  We'll keep using this for comfort food.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this to go with lasagna. I had to make some substitutions. I also reduced the oregano after reading other feedback but will probably increase it closer to what is called out in the recipe. I didn't have any mayo on hand so i used a bit of leftover ricotta cheese and olive oil in the mix and then did not sprinkle any parmesan. I could not find any french baguettes so I bought some course bread sold as "Texas Toast" and used that.

The family loved it and I'll do it again. Sometimes there is leftover garlic bread when we nuke the storebought kind. There were no leftovers with this. I'll certainly keep this recipe and use it over and over.

I used this on hamburger buns to get rid of them.  It needed to go on thinner, but it was really good anyway. A little less oregano would have made it perfect.

This was quick and easy.  I didn't have garlic cloves on hand so I used about 1/4 t. of garlic powder.  I put this on regular bread and toasted the bread.  I couldn't even taste the mayonnaise and was really impressed with the subtle flavor.  Will definitely use again.

My family loved this!  It was served with the Yummy Lasagna from this site for our Christmas Eve dinner.  It was terrific!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, using lite margarine and low fat mayo.  I will make this again for sure.

Fantastic!  This has such a nice salty flavour without being overpowering.  I really liked how quickly these grilled too - usually when I use just melted garlic butter brushed over the bread, it takes FOREVER to brown up, and then burns quickly - it's always a risk.

I used basil & a good amount of parmesan.

We loved this. I will definately make this again. I will, however, cut the salt & oregano down a bit next time.

This was awesome.  I didn't have sage, so I omitted it.  This is the best garlic bread, and it is very much like restaurant style.  Way better than the frozen stuff at the store.

This was the best garlic bread I've had and it was SO easy!  I read the reviews and left out the salt, and it was perfect.  I also added a light layer of mozzarella cheese just before I put it in the broiler....delicious!

This is a keeper.  We will definitely be using this recipe whenever we want homemade garlic bread.  Leftovers heat up well wrapped in tinfoil and thrown back in the oven.

This was good but I thought the topping was a little too creamy.  Next time I will cut the amount in half.  Thanks for the recipe, though - the flavor is awesome!

Very good garlic bread. The mayo makes it greasy, but for a once in a while meal it's ok. Used less than a t. of salt. I served it with simple black bean soup, delicious combination.

YUMMY!  This recipe really "kicks up" my old recipe.  Only added a very small pinch of salt and it was great.  My new mainstay for garlic bread......

This might have been a bit too zippy for our tastes. I think I prefer the Garlic Butter recipe (from allrecipes) but thanks for letting me try it. Oh yeah, forgot to say that I didn't add any salt at all & thought it needed a pinch or two.

My family thought this made the best garlic bread we've had - much better than just the normal butter/garlic mixture I normally make.  Be sure to keep an eye on the broiler - half of mine was scorched and it was just in for over a minute.  After reading the other reviews I only put 1/2 tsp salt in, but after eating it I think next time I will use the whole amount listed - but we like salty things, so maybe its not for everyone.

This was excellent!  I didn't read the reviews before I made this and I agree that it was a bit too salty.  I will be making this on a regular basis.

Wasn't sure about the mayonnaise and sage but this turned out rather nicely. Looked pretty as well. Used shredded parmesan instead of grated, next time I will use a combination of both.

Not the best recipe i've had for garlic bread, but tasty. This recipe might need a bit more salt, and I thought that the spread would come out to be a bit more rich, since it has mayonnaise in it.

Very good.  I used a little less pepper, but everything else is wonderful.  My husband LOVES this bread and always keeps some in the refrigerator.

Delicious - and as another reviewer stated - the butter keeps well in the refrigerator - we've been enjoying garlic bread every night.  Thanks submitter!
