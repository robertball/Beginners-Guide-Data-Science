Simple and delicious! Plus it not only tastes good but it's good for you too! I love the crunch from the granola. These are perfect for breakfast or a really nice "guilt free" snack. I cut the recipe in half opted to use fat free greek vanilla yogurt and threw in a few blackberries as well. The honey drizzled over top is a nice addition. This is a great base for whatever add-in's you like and no matter what kind of fruit you have on hand it's bound to be tasty!

Quick, easy to assemble, just quick to devour it.  Boys made it for their dad on father''s day to eat while breakfast was cooking.  Definitely a keeper.

My family had a Birthday gathering for my son and I served this along with other breakfast items and it was a huge hit!!  I made it the night before and covered in the refrigerator.  The only problem I encountered was the bananas turned slightly darker.  Next time I will make sure the bananas are slightly over ripe otherwise it was PERFECT!!

I used the limited edition of cheerios very berry cereal in place of the granola and I dusted it with brown sugar. Really good.
