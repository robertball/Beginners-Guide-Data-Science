I’m happy to be the first reviewer, the first, but not the last I’m sure, to report that this dressing is excellent.  I had my doubts, given there was no sour cream in the recipe, but the higher proportion of buttermilk to mayonnaise took care of that.  As for the mayonnaise,  these type dressings do need it, but what I so appreciated in this recipe was that it did not  dominate as I’ve found it does in some recipes I’ve tried.  The recipe lends itself well to improvisation with any number of fresh herbs – in this case I used parsley, basil, and tarragon, already growing fresh in my Wisconsin garden.  Dill would have been a nice choice too.  Fresh thyme and/or oregano might also be interesting additions for a bolder taste. (I don’t think Hubs or I would have cared for the cilantro but that’s just our preference, I’m sure)  The fresh garlic was apparent and I loved it – so much better than garlic powder, tho’ that would certainly work in a pinch. Great dressing Michellejo3 – we’ll use it often.

This definitely is a "Delicious" ranch dressing! And just as the submitter states, the fresh herbs really do make it stand out.  I'm used to ranch dressing recipes that call for a mix of mayo, buttermilk, and sour cream but this was a pleasant surprise as I didn't have any sour cream on hand.  I opted for low fat buttermilk and Hellman's light mayo - I think any mayo you use would be fine.  I also subbed dill for the cilantro and wow - perfect over mixed greens!

This was good stuff!  I made it as written, and it does get better as it sits.  I used this with Elfie's Ranch Beer Butt Chicken on this site, and it gave it good flavor.  We had some of this with our accompanying salad, but I think I'll use the rest of it with carrot and celery sticks.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this as was except changed out dill for cilantro, as other reviews suggest.  As is, didn't enjoy the flavor or the consistency.  It was extremely "runny," it was like pouring milk. Ended up adding sour cream/greek yogurt to get it to thicken up.

This is more like a vegetable dip. I am looking for something more similar to salad dressing.

Made this basically the same as usual, but having never used buttermilk in a salad dressing before, I wanted to try this. It was great. I added a combo of fresh basil, tarragon, parsley and dill and added a dash of horseradish and some tubed cilantro. I added this to shrimp, crabmeat, pasta, cucumber and tomatoes. Delish!

I've substituted butter milk with sour cream and was out of cilantro so I've put parsley. Tasted like store bought or even better!

This is much better than store bought! I made 2 changes:fresh basil, and half & half instead of buttermilk since I had none.

Definitely delicious - and oh so fresh!  I substituted fresh parsley for the tarragon and basil, and upped the garlic & buttermilk a bit.  Absolutely love this recipe that my daughter found.

This is pretty good. I thought it was too garlicky, but I’m not a fan of garlic. Thank you for the recipe.
