I would rate this 10 stars if I could. This is the real deal ... REAl simple, REAL easy , and REAL good!
My family is picky about mac& cheese ( usually they want a specific frozen brand and they can tell if it's not that)
But the PREFER this recipe! I don't add the tomato and bread crumbs

It was delicious after I made some changes. I used Fusili instead of macaroni. I only used 1 and 1/2 c flour, a 1/4 c oil, and 2 cups of cream. I used chicken broth as needed to make a smooth sauce. I also added about a cup of shredded Mexican cheeses. I used a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes, undrained. I didn't use any bread crumbs. I think I just stumbled upon my best mac and cheese yet!

I'm giving this a four because of the nice cheesy flavour. Beware! this recipe serves eight! Large pots are a must.

I have mixed feelings about this one. It's ok.  I didn't add the tomatoes.  I think it has a heavy flour taste and not much of a cheese taste.  I didnt have a sauce pan big enough to make the cheese mixture, and I didn't add as much milk as called for.  I used about 3 cups.  I really liked the consistency though.  It was creamy, but just did't have enough cheese flavor.  I will try this again with less flour, probably a cup and a half and add more cheese, probably some sharp cheddar.

Way too much milk!  I didn't even use half the cheese sauce (froze it for another time).   Next time I will use less milk, no flour, and no oil.   Otherwise it was perfect. ;)

Think broccoli cheese soup and substitute noodles for the broccoli then bake. Not enough flavor for me. I didn't use American cheese, instead I used part mozzarella and part cheddar.

Left out the tomatoes and bread crumbs. Also, I didn't use that much milk. My mother used to make this and never added the oil.

Very Confused. When I clicked on pic of recipe I wanted - gave me ingredients -ok. Purchased all I needed. When clicked on preparation, butter which was part of original list of ingredients wasn't needed but crushed tomatoes were - not on original list. Overall - it was easy to prepare (first time baking it) - but very very bland. My kids thought it was bland as well but the pan was gone by next afternoon (2 boys). I now have the base ingredients, and will go make my own changes and try again using my own touches. Overall - ok but nothing to write home about. A bit disappointed but the boys (by the way - ages 21 and 25) liked NOT loved it. Thank you.

I did not like this recipe at all, i followed the directions exactly and thought it was very bland. It tasted like there was too much flour in it and i would use cheddar cheese instead. I would not recommend this recipe for anyone, im glad that i was just making it for my boyfriend and me because i would have been mortified if anybody else tasted it.

I made this for my family and scaled back on the oil.  Hated it with tomatos and used shredded Italian blend of cheese instead.  It was good with that cheese but will make it w/o tomatos nex time!

Not bad, I made my own American  cheese. I used a bit of dry mustard and grated fresh nutmeg. It makes a lot, good for parties or big families.  Thank you Irene
