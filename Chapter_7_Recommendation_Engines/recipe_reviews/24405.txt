I could not believe how good this soup was! I even substituted 3/4 c. of rice milk and 2 T. of butter for the heavy cream, and it was still so creamy. I've never had sorrel before and now have requested more from my farmer's co-op. Thank you!!

My husband and I belong to an organic food coop that delivers us a box of vegetables every two weeks. Last week's delivery contained a big bunch of sorrel and I had no idea what to do with it. I made this soup this weekend and it was wonderful-very savory. I added a bay leaf to my broth and I used a little more cream than was called for. I will definitely make this again.

I had never had sorrel before and purchsed some from the farmers market today. Saw this recipe and thought I would try it. I didn't have heavy cream, but used FF half and half. Good but a little thin. Put in 4 T of frozen potato flakes to help thicken it up...delish. Has a light lemony flavor. Will make again.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I made so many changes.  I used chicken broth in place of veggie and about a cup and a half of diced potatoes instead of rice.  I also added about half a small leek I had on hand as the recipe seemed a little bland.  Used an immersion blender and added Vit D milk with 1tbs butter since I didn't have any cream.  This was delicious!  I had a little bit of fresh mozz that I diced and served with it.  Even my husband, who usually scoffs at creations from our CSA share loved it.

So tasty...I cooked as directed but placed the broth, sorrel, and rice in the food processor to puree. While in there. I used the same pot and made a roux and added about 2 tbs of butter and 1 tbs of flour and about a 1/2 cup of milk, cooked until think and bubbly. I processed the soup and added it to the pot. It was so delicious my 2 year old couldn't get enough.

Like many others, I too received a bunch of Sorrel in my CSA share. I had never tried it before this recipe. All I can say is WOW. What a phenomenal taste for so few ingredients and such a small amount of effort. I followed the recipe exactly and used an immersion blender. Thanks for sharing!

Didn't even know what sorrel was until joining an organic vegetable coop.  This recipe was surprisingly easy and delicious. I prepped it to the point where the cream would have been added and froze it.  It thawed and reheated well.

Delicious! Instead of rice, I used a handful of small potatoes that I needed to use up. Chopped them up, simmered until soft in broth with a bay leaf and about 3T of dried minced onion. Added sorrel and enough broth to cover. 

After blending, I added 1 cup of milk and 2 teaspoons of butter with the salt and pepper. The potatoes thickened it nicely. Lovely, smooth and tangy. My husband said he'd love to have this whenever the CSA sends sorrel.

My grandma in France made a similiar soup but used potato instead of rice. I would love to know where I can purchase sorrel in the states or where to get the seeds to plant it.

Thank you for this recipe. I'm grateful that my dear Hungarian mother and father taught me how to make soska. We have it growing in my NJ garden. Seeds from Hungary. The taste is so much better than the sorrel plant I bought here in NJ. Anyway, we make it like this: fry 2 chopped onions in oil, add about 3-4  gallon sized ziplock bags worth of washed soska/ sorrel with stems removed. Let cook/ soften. Turn off heat. Add mixture to Vitamix ( so worth the investment), blend. Then add 5-8 tablespoons of sugar and a 1/2 cup - 1 cup of sour cream if desired. My dear dad said this was awesome. I asked my mom to help guide me in making this recipe. I know she helped me from Heaven.

This soup was soooo good!  Yum!  Substituted mimic cream for the cream for dairy free.  Also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.

This was good - I went with the other suggestions and doubled the cream and I also blended ramp's leaves along with the sorrel.

Very traditional Slavic dish. My background is Polish and its a staple in some regions. This chef  recipe is very close to traditional sorrel soup and sounds great. More traditional options as reviewers noted: instead of rice. sub cubed cooked potatoes and/or hard boiled eggs (we add eggs to each bowl). Also, to thicken instead of cream, temper in 1-2 whole eggs or yolks.

This was pretty good.  I cut the recipe in half and thought it made about 1 1/2 servings.  Subbed 1 large potato for rice and subbed milk and butter for cream.  Added 1 bay leaf.  It was a nice light soup and will likely make it again when I get sorrel from our co-op farm next year.  Thanks!

This is a surprisingly delicious soup.  I had never used sorrel before and I got some in my cna box today. I added a few potatoes as was suggested and used my stick my stick blender to blend it all up.  I will be making this again and passing it along to my friends.

The hubby loved this.  Very unique and a great way to eat cooked greens without losing any of the vitamins. A delicate-flavored soup with a creamy lemony taste.  I used chicken stock.

I love to forage and cook out of what I find. Here in Iceland, we have a lot of what is called Northern Dock, which is closely related to sorrel, and which is regarded purely as a nuisance weed in disturbed ground, but which originated hundreds of years ago as a cultivated garden vegetable.  Now it grows luxuriantly and beautifully all over the place, and nobody uses it. For years I have thought about collecting a bunch of it and making soup out of it, and having found this recipe, I decided to finally go for it! 

I did not add the rice mentioned in the recipe - I might try it next time, or perhaps a chopped up potato. My husband and I were delighted with the flavor and texture of the soup. I gathered a huge bunch of leaves in late spring, well away from automobile traffic - kind of at the latest advisable time, as the leaves do toughen when the plant blossoms. Next spring I'll start earlier in the season and make it a few more times before the season advances too much.

Very nice velvety texture. As others did I added potatoes. It is very lemony so cream it's a good. Complement. Husband made croutons and made it better
