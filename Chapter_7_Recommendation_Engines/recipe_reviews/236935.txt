I thought it was good, but my hubby thought it was too fishy tasting.  I think he just didn't love the tuna, but he likes tuna fish salad.

Tasty! The only variation I made to this recipe was that I used onion salt in place of the onion and salt. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. I did have to use mozzarella cheese because I didn't have cottage cheese. My kids and husband enjoyed it.  Thanks.

I made this recipe just as listed. I wondered if I should sauté the onions first, but they are delightfully crisp and slightly crunchy when added raw. I was hesitant to try it because it sounds quite odd. I have made it for my family twice now and have gotten rave reviews both times. I usually leave off the bread crumbs on top, when a recipe calls for them. They are another nice “crunch factor” here though, so I’m glad I used them. The flavor is a nice creamy surprise and the tuna taste is very subtle.  One family member said it is their favorite of the tuna casserole recipes that I have made.

This is one of the best tuna casserole recipes. I only had one can of tuna on hand but otherwise made it per instructions. Fast, easy, and a crowd pleaser.

The tuna taste in this casserole is less pronounced than in other tuna noodle casseroles.  I'll make it again.
