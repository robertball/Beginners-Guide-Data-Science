This recipe turned out good for me. I may have been a little heavy handed on the dill but I really like the dill. This is a recipe that can easily be changed to suit your taste and you could put whatever you like in the breadcrumb mixture. Great recipe!

Very easy . I will make this again. excellent flavors. Just use what seasoning you prefer. I use garlic powder and Jane’s crazy salt. A little olive oil and some sautéed mushrooms. After Cooking the chicken I added a little cream and served with fetachini and peas.

Very simple. You have to watch it because there’s a fine line between burning the coating and drying out the chicken. Medium heat will help and prep is fast so be patient.

This recipe was only ok. We didn't feel like it had a lot of flavor and being told to using cooking spray as opposed to oil was a negative. I started out with cooking oil and realized it was just going to burn the chicken so I switched to Olive oil instead.
