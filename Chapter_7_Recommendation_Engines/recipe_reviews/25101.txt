I have a similar recipe to these "yummies" as we all them.

Heat to disolve:1C sugar, 1C corn syrup. Remove from heat, stir in 1C creamy peanut butter. Pour mixture over 5-6C cornflakes, stir. Drop on wax paper.

I made these last week, and they were gone in 2 days!

This recipe turned out delicious but I substituted sesame tahini (sesami butter) instead of peanut butter I also added more sugar since tahini is not sweetened. My only problem was getting the candy to stick together, I think I will just serve it over ice cream...

I made these and let my neighborhood sample them and rate them with me.  These were a big hit with the adults and the kids.  I wish they didn't get so soggy from the corn syrup and would still hold a bit more of a crunch.  Next time I make them I am going to add more corn flakes to make that happen.

I made a few slight changes.  I used agave instead of corn syrup and 1 cup peanut butter.  Instead of sesame seeds I used chopped dates (my family loves peanut butter and dates :)  They turned out great!  Kind of a cross between a crunchy cookie and peanut butter fudge.

Really simple. Peanut buttery and sweet and crunchy...what's not to like? As easy as Rice Krispie treats, but something a little different.
