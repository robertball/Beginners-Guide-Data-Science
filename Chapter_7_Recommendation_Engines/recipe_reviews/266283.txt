Delicious tomato soup! I used a mixture of Roma and cherry from our garden. I didn’t have a countertop blender, so I used my immersion blender. Next time I’ll run it through the food mill after blending. The skins were a texture issue for us.

It was easy to make, and I was excited to use the immersion blender. But overall, it was really bland. Add lots more salt if you want to try this recipe.

This recipe was in my opinion OK, but still liked it. I expected a different flavor or the like but for some reason I did not find this soup outstanding or surprising. I sprinkled a pinch of parmesan cheese  when I served it. This recipe was very similar in flavor to the Garden Fresh Tomato Soup from this site minus the roux. I highly recommend to use a hand blender if you have it. This will shorten the preparation time and yield a creamy soup. I will make this recipe again but will try it with roux and may pass it through a sieve for texture.

Loved it.
I did need to roast for  longer but thought the balance of flavours was wonderful.

I rated this 3 stars because of the cooking time and amount of broth used. After 30 minutes my onions were still hard. I added another 30 minutes before adding the garlic. This gave my puree a silky texture instead of chunky. I used homemade chicken broth but since I like more of a pureed texture I only needed two cups, 5 cups would've been too watery for me. I added 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil after returning the mixture to the pot and simmered for 10 minutes in additional to the fresh as a garnish. I also used Sante fe peppers instead of red bell peppers which upset my stomach. They have the same texture but a little heat. I will definitely make again with the changes.

There is nothing like homemade tomato soup!  This recipe was delicious  and easy but I found it a little thin but to be fair, I used Jersey tomatoes instead of plum and that could be why.  going to add just a little more red pepper next time.

I have always made my own tomato soup and it was good. This is sensational. Sublime. Divine. Thank you!
