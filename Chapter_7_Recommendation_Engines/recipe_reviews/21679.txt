I was thrilled to find a good recipe for ground pork! This was so delicious! Instead of using jarred sweet and sour sauce, I used the Sweet & Sour Sauce II recipe on this site. The combination was perfection! Tastes exactly like take out chinese! Thanks so much Linda!

I altered the recipe a bit and made meatballs instead of patties, using the same ingredients except I used 3/4 cup bread crumbs. I baked them at 350 for 20 min. and then let them simmer in a pot with sweet & sour sauce and a little soy sauce.  These were great.  I will definately make these again.

Really, really good.  I only gave 4 stars because I did some changes.  I baked them in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes as meatballs.  I added a 1/4 tsp of chinese five spice a tsp of salt 1 tsp of ketchup  1tsp of mustard and 1 tsp of worcestershire sauce.  These were unbelievable I know the mustard and ketchup sounds weird but they are delicious.

I tried this recipe for ground beef since that was what I had on hand and we very rarely have ground pork in the house.  I also combined tips I followed from several reviewers and adapted my recipe as follows:  I made meatballs, placed them on an ungreased nonstick cookie sheet and baked them for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  I added 1 tsp each of ketchup, dijon mustard and worcestershire, 1/4 tsp each of Chinese spice and ground ginger, and added some black pepper.  But I think the black pepper was overwhelming.  I'll omit it next time.  The recommendation for coordinating this with the Sweet and Sour Sauce II recipe was a good one.  That's what I used to go with the meatballs and served over white rice.  Both my toddlers enjoyed this.  DH loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again.

We loved this recipe!  I wasn't sure about the combination of pork patties and sweet & sour sauce but it was fantastic.  The only change I made was using 1/2 of plain breadcrumbs and 1/2 of Italian-style breadcrumbs (I ran out of the plain).  I also took other reviewer's suggestions and made the sweet & sour sauce II and we think it's better than most bottled sweet & sour sauce. We couldn't believe how great the combination was.  Served with wild-rice and stir-fried broccoli made it a wonderful meal. Thanks Linda for a great post! It will become a regular in our house!

I just received this recipe and read through it.  I haven't made them yet, but I think when I do I will make them into little meatballs and serve them as an appetizer, kept warm in my slowcooker!  Sounds very yummy!!

Pretty good but not outstanding. Needs quite a lot more seasoning, and the patties didn't hold together very well. Husband wasn't terribly keen on the parsley with the sweet and sour sauce. Nice for a change but I won't be making them again. Thanks.

This was very good, the sweet and sour sauce goes well with rice.  A nice change and the red pepper flakes gives it a nice zing.

Accidently bought ground pork(instead of beef) and wasn't sure what to do with it.  This is really quick and easy.  Has become a family favorite.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe.  I made it a few months ago and have been craving it since.  I baked the patties in the oven rather than panfry, but other than that followed the recipe.  Served with rice.

AMAZING! Thank You to Linda for sharing this recipe! I made it for almost 30 people here and all of them gave it 2 thumbs up! I made them as larger patties (almost burger sized) and they still cooked thouroughly in good time. Will definately be making these again in the future!

I can tell I will use this recipe a lot. Like some of the others I too will use the AR II SW&Sr sauceI I needed one of them too.I likelywillincorperate some garbanzo beans and/or tofu with the pork and make sweet and sour meat balls to serve different ways,I like the usefulness of this,and the flavor and ease and good for you makes me able to give a5 star.

These were a huge hit in my home.  I served them with brown rice, roasted red peppers, pineapple chunks, and homemade sweet and sour sauce.  I used green scallions in place of the onions and they were fabulous.

Love this!  I made into meatballs and served with Uncle Bill's Sweet and Sour sauce from this site.  Yummy :)  Only change I made was using onion powder instead of onion because I was out.

Different and will make again when I have leftover duck sauce from a kielbasa recipe I make sometimes. I followed most of the reviewers and baked the meatballs at 350 for 30 minutes. I did have to add about 1/4 more cup of bread crumbs (maybe because I used the canned/prepared kind), and I also added a tablespoon of oriental seasoning to the mix that I made as meatballs, not patties. I also doubled the amount of duck sauce used, coated the meatballs in it and allowed it to simmer for about 15 minutes in a suate pan. Served with white rice and stir fry green beans cooked in a little oil, soy sauce and oriental seasoning.

Wow- this is really good!  I made this just as recipe says except I made them into meatballs instead of patties.  Used 3/4 c. breadcrumbs instead of 1/2 c.  Baked at 350 and poured the sweet & sour sauce over the meatballs when done. Served over Minute Rice.  Delicious!!

This was really good. I only used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, added fresh garlic and used 2 egg whites instead of the whole egg. I made meatballs instead of patties and cooked them in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes instead of cooking them on the stove. I used sweet and sour sauce I from this site instead of the jarred stuff and they went really well together. I got about 6 servings out of this. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow for lunch!

I thought this was really good. The changes I  made was adding 1 tsp minced garlic and forming the meat into meatballs and baking them as suggested by other reviews.  It is a keeper. I made the sweet and Sour Sauce II by myrite from this site. I served it over white rice. Delicious.

As others suggested, I made into meatballs, baked them one day ahead of time in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  Also, I added pineapple chunks, sliced red peppers and onion to sauce/meatballs and simmered all together until the meatballs were heated through.  The vegetables remained crisp-tender.  I served over rice - AWESOME!

This was a nice change from the usual.  I added a teaspoon of worchestershire, ketchup, and yellow mustard, as well as a 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger.  I also increased the breadcrumbs to about 3/4 cup.  I formed the mixture into balls (about 1 inch) and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  I actually froze these, then defrosted them out when we were ready to eat and heated them through in a skillet with the sweet and sour sauce.  Next time, I'm going to make my own sweet and sour sauce and probably double the amount called for, so we have enough sauce to serve over rice.

This recipe was a perfect alternative to traditional sweet and sour pork.  It was so easy.  My only problem was that I should have made more!  I followed the recipe for the patties to a T and it was perfect.  I used the Sweet and Sour Sauce II (submitted by myrite on allrecipes.com)- which by the way was almost as easy as opening a jar of store sauce, but much better.  After adding the sweet and sour sauce to the patties, I added about 1/2 of a bell pepper and 1/2 of an onion cut into really big chunks.. I let that cook together for about 15 min.  My family almost inhaled supper that night it was so good!  THANKS for sharing your recipe, Linda.
 ***foot note*** my 6 year old daughter thought it was too spicy and couldn't eat it, so keep that in mind with the pepper flakes.

These were great and quick to make.  I cooked these on med-high for 4 minutes each side and they were perfect.  As another member had suggested, I used the S&S sauce II recipe (submitted by Debbie) on this website and it was delicious!!

Pretty good recipe my husband liked it, though it did not really taste like sweet and sour you would get from an oriental restraunt, but good nonetheless. I made formed them into meatballs instead of patties. Thanks!

I used your basic recipe and formed meatballs. I baked them at 350 for about 35 minutes. Meanwhile I cooked 1 chopped green pepper, 1 chopped red pepper, 1/4 chopped onion in a frying pan with 2 TBl of pineapple juice over med heat. Once the peppers were crisp/tender I added a can of pineapple chunks. I then added the meatballs and sweet and sour sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes while I cooked the rice. This dish was so amazing and is now a favorite in our house! Thank you for the base recipe-I recommend trying it made like this!

I changed this recipe to go with what I had in my pantry.  I didn't have pepper flakes, parsley or sweet and sour sauce. Instead I grated carrots and pineapple then added sweet chili sauce.  They were so good I didn't even need a dipping sauce. I love this recipe. Thank you so much for the great idea, especially since my husband loves ground pork:-)

This was wonderful. I added ginger, but the next time I'll add garlic poweder and green onions. The three G's of asian cooking. Since I had left overs, I made more white rice and added more ginger while it cooked. Amazining on what flavor it added to the whold dish. I think I also might try making my own Sweet and Sour sauce.

Yummy! My husband and I loved this! Made a few changes to suit our liking,  but it was great! It will be in our meal plans now. Took the advice and made the meatballs.

This was very good for how easy it was. I don't know how "healthy" it is for you, but it was a delicious meal. I forgot to patty the pork and just used it ground, but it turned out just fine. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!  My picky 2 year old and not quite as picky husband and 4 year old ate this up.  I sauteed half an onion and half a green pepper as well and added with the sauce at the end.  Would probably add twice as much or more of both next time.  Also halved the amount of red pepper because of the aforementioned children and still had a nice kick.  Thank you!

Instead of using jarred sauce, I made the Sweet and Sour sauce II from this site and it was delicious. I followed the pork patty recipe exactly and they were delicious, my husband and I loved this meal.

This is a wonderful dish! It took less time to cook when I made the patties. I went a little light on the sauce and added about 1/4 cup of hot banana peppers in the patties.

This is a good, easy family pleasing recipe.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used the Sweet and Sour Sauce II recipe. But, be sure to half it for a family of four or otherwise you will have too much sauce.

We love this.  I made a homemade, but simple sweet and sour sauce from this site, called Sweet and Sour Sauce I, to save money on buying a jar and it was delish!  All the kids ate well.

We thought these were great.  Added a couple crushed cloves of garlic and subbed hoisin sauce for the milk we didn't have.  Made our own sweet and sour sauce using the Sweet and Sour Turkey patties recipe, which uses maple syrup.  Amazing flavor and great dinner served with brown rice and broccoli.

I thought these were OK, but way too salty for my taste.  My son did not like them at all.  I might try them for myself again with reduced salt.

These were awesome! I left out the onion as my husband isn't a fan of them and added 1/2 a tsp of ground Coriander seed (it goes well with pork). They were awesome over a bed of rice with the Sweet and Sour Sauce II recipe! ENJOY!

I made these as meatballs.  It felt like they were missing something, possibly garlic.  The meatballs themselves needed something else, besides the sauce.

Awesome! We loved these. We also used the sweet & sour II sauce but really I think they stand alone as a great meatball dish. (we made them into balls rather than patties.)

These were delicious. I made homemade sweet and sour sauce from the all recipes website called sweet and sour sauce II. I made the meat as meatballs instead of patties. I also baked them for a less fatty version. I added some green peppers and onions to the sauce and meat balls and served it over rice.

This was fun and different!  I used other reviewer's suggestions and made meatballs instead and baked them in the oven for 25 minutes.  I also used Sweet and Sour Sauce II (also as suggested) and it was perfect.  Will probably make again, and next time might try ground turkey instead.

After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to make these into meatballs and make a sweet and sour sauce to go with them. I added the ketchup and mustart that was recommended in another review. I loved the kick the pepper flakes added.  My family loved these and requested that I make them again.

This is a wonderful way to use ground pork. If you like spicy, add a pinch more red pepper. This has become part of our regular meals.

Actually my daughter found this recipe on your site about 4 years ago.  Anyone that makes this recipe will be a huge  hit.  We have been making this recipe for so many years.  We get a five star rating from people everytime we make it.  It has been passed around to so many family and friends.  The whole recipe will please over and beyond the palete.  The sauce is excellent and it is homemade.  If you don't like red pepper flakes try and cut it down to 1/2 tsp or omit all together in the pork.  We make rice and put pork pattie over rice with the sauce.  Once you have tried it the family will always want it again and they surly will enjoy this for supper.  Thank you Linda for submitting the recipe!!

Ok Gang!  I had a package of ground pork that I had to use and stumbled upon this recipe.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I tried crushed Triscuits (deli-style rye) and added cumin & garlic to the other ingredients.  I also left out the sauce as I didn't have any in my pantry and didn't want to make it from scratch but "WoW"!  This was very tastey which left a little tingle on the tongue for a short moment...MMMMMMMMMMMM!  I'll make this again but next time I'll make into meatballs and try the sauce with it.

Not bad, but just felt like it was any other hamburger with sauce instead.

These were very good, easy and unique!  I added onion wedges to the sauce and will add chunks of pineapple next time.

These patties were awesome.  I added 1/2 of a red bell pepper, chopped, and a tablespoon of teriyaki sauce.  I served these with the Danish Christmas Red Cabbage recipe and some mashed potatoes.  Just wonderful and quick!

Made this last night with white rice and stir-fry, very good and very easy.  Made my own sweet and sour sauce and used extra to pour over rice/veggies before serving.

Only addition I made was to add siracha to the pork mixture.  I love spicy food, and if you do as well, it's a great addition.

Absolutely delicious!  It was hard to find ground pork, so it might be tasty with ground turkey instead.  I added a little ground ginger and cilantro to the  mix, too.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious! My grandma used to make something similiar when we were little, without the sweet and sour sauce. I added a few extra ingredients such as soy sauce and garlic powder. You could put a variety of spices in these. I also used the sweet and sour sauce II recipe. I didn't have any rice, so I made mashed potatoes with it and it was still awesome! Thanks!

I was glad to see these as a featured recipe in an email as they are wonderful.  We eat a lot of ground pork in place of ground beef and I have made them many times and my husband loves them.

Really Really good. Had to make with grnd turkey since my tchotchke store had no ground pork. The consistency was a little mushy, although they were cooked through. Not sure why.... Anyway, really good despite. Kids and hubby are like they were starving and had seconds and thirds. Yummy!! Everyone would be happy to see this go into the rotation! Thanks!!

I personally liked the pork patties. They were easy to make and cooked up in no time and quite tasty! But my husband didn't really care for them- I think he couldnt get past the ground pork part!

Nice and easy recipe. But don't just stick to pepper flakes. Make it up add your own preferences of herbs and spices.

This was just lovely!  Rave reviews in my family with my husband asking for it weekly.  I also used the recommendation of another reviewer and used the Sweet & Sour Sauce II recipe.  I have also made this with chicken and it is equally tasty.  I do add ground pepper however, as I love my pepper, but all in all it a fantastic meal.

I loved this! I made 7 patties with the one pound of ground pork that I had. I used previous suggestions of 1/4 t Chinese five spice powder, 1 clove garlic, and half the amount of seasoning salt. Also used one large scallion in place of onion. I used All recipes Sweet and Sour Sauce I and served with brown rice. Delicious way to use ground pork!

Yummers!!  I stumbled upon this b/c we had ground pork to use up!  The kids loved eating the patties plain, just like meatballs.  My husband and I ate with a homemade sweet and sour sauce (sweet and sour sauce II in all recipes), and served with green peppers, pineapples and water chestnuts.   No modifications, made as is.  Thought we would have extra for everyone's lunch the next day...Nope!  They were all gobbled up!

Really good!  Made as is but added a little five spice powder as suggested by another cook, and baked at 350. Then I used a sweet and sour recipe from this site. Really good!!! Kid approved.

I agree with other reviews - a great way to use up ground pork.  I only had a pound of ground pork (recipe says 1 1/2 pounds), so I decreased the other ingredients to compensate.  I used half of a white onion, and the onion was overpowering - it may have been the onion, because I shed quite a few tears when cutting it.  The next time I make this I will use a yellow onion instead of white.  I liked the parsley in the patties.  I added a mixture of frozen Asian vegetables at the end, and sticky rice to accompany.  I do think the sauce could have used something else, like fresh pineapple chunks, but overall this recipe was easy and enjoyed by everyone.  I will tweak it some to suit my family's tastes.

I needed a recipe for ground pork as a stir-fried topping over rice, I tried this one minus the egg, crumbs and milk.  Also added a 1/4 tsp of ginger, splash of soy sauce and rice vinegar to the pork as it browned.  Great with Sweet & Sour Sauce II recipe as another reviewer mentioned.  This will be my go-to meal for ground pork now!  Very yummy!

Good with the following changes and additions. 1. Increase bread crumbs to 3/4 c, 2. Decrease red pepper flakes to 1/2 t, 3. Reduce salt to 1/2 t, 4. Add 1/4 t. each ground ginger & Asian Spice, 5. add 1 clove garlic, minced, 6. add 1 green and 1 red pepper, 7. add canned pineapple chunks, drain and reserve juice to make "Sweet and Sour Sauce II" but use juice for part of water in that recipe, 8. add can each bamboo shoots & sliced water chestnuts. Make your own sweet & sour sauce and serve with rice.

It was delicious, I made them into meatballs. I used the stems of cilantro instead of parsley since I do not like the taste of parsley. and the stems gave it a nice crunch. I used more cilantro and onion than the recipe called for. I forgot to put the milk and I made my own sweet and sour sauce. Also I used garlic roasted bread crumbs. YUM!

This recipe was a good, basic pork meatball/patti recipe.  I made it as listed, then added things we love. . . garlic, curry, oregano, basil.  I browned the meatballs then mixed it with the Sweet and Sour II recipe on this site and it made a fantastic meal.

This was really a great alternative to orinary burgers.   Even my husband who is a hamburger fan, love the pork.  He omitted the sweet sour sauce, but I like it with the sauce.   Good that you can have the option!

This was pretty good, and something we'll definitely try again. The flavor of the pork patties was milder than I expected; I think that next time I'll add some of the ingredients others have suggested like ground ginger and five-spice.  The texture reminded me of meatloaf, which I didn't expect, either.  Overall, this is a good recipe.

This recipe is one of our favorites.  I always make it into meatballs and add soy sauce as mentioned by another reviewer.  We never have leftovers!

WOW! I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried and only had red pepper flakes so I just guessed on that. My egg was really big so I ended up not adding milk and put more bread crumbs to hold it together. I used the Sweet and Sour Sauce I from this site (with a few tweaks) and was so surprised how well this turned out. I didn't make the patties as small as suggested, next time I will. Before I added the sauce, I drizzled some Thai sweet Chili Sauce over the patties to give it a little kick because after trying a piece of one, I realized I hadn't put enough red pepper in for our tastes. Served over rice, boyfriend had two big helpings. We will definatley be making this again!

These were good but I didnt really taste the sweet n sour as much as I thought. They kinda just tasted like meatloaf. Good, but I was a little disappointed.

These were great! The second time I made it I forgot to buy duck sauce so used Grape Jelly and some mustard to make the sweet and sour sauce. It still turned out a winner with the family!

This was good, but a little weird.  The first bite is okay, then the more you eat the better it gets.  I will make again....it was different than anything else i make.  I also used the sweet and sour sauce II as others did.

Good recipe for a sweet & sour dish. Next time I will use a little less red pepper flakes and buy a different brand of sweet & sour sauce. It gave me a chance to finish the fresh parsley from Thanksgiving. I think it's a must.I made 9 patties and cooked them in my square electric skillet.

Not bad - followed recipe with exception of not having any pepper flakes -used a pinch of cayenne instead. Followed suggestion to do med-high - 4 min per side and patties came out 'just' cooked enough, (8 patties).
Would do this one again.

These were ok.  I thought they were a bit bland.  My husband liked them though so I gave them 3 stars.  We served them with rice & store bought sweet and sour sauce...perhaps that makes a difference!

This recipe was so good! The pork patties were seasoned perfectly, and contrasted beautifully with the sauce. I was afraid when I saw pepper flakes in the ingredient list but there was just the right amount of spice, by no means "spicy" in the traditional sense.  My 3 year old ate this up! Will make again and again. Yummy!!

This recipe is excellent! I use the grill to cook the patties. Medium heat for 7 minutes on one side and about 5 on the other. I also use foil to keep the juices in. Then heat up the sweet and sour sauce and pour over top.

This turned out WONDERFULLY!  I was in a hurry and accidently doubled the red pepper flakes, it was the perfect zip!  We had it over rice. Definetly one that we'll make again.

These were not bad - I shaped them into meatballs too. I felt they lacked a little kick though - perhaps some pepper would have made a difference, or chilli powder, or soy sauce (use less salt if using soy sauce). Some assorted vegetables could be fried/simmered in the sweet and sour sauce before adding the meatballs to make this a complete meal, as well as to add colour to this dish.

Great idea for ground pork.  I had a pound in the freezer and a bottle of sweet and sour sauce on hand...and this was the solution.  I used powdered cayenne instead of the red pepper flakes, two slices of white bread softened in water, and regular salt.  I made small meatballs instead of patties...and served it over rice. It received a "thumbs up".
