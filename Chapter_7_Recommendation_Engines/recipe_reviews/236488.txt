This is the same recipe I've called Marzipan Square, which I make only at Christmas. I divide the batter, color one red the other green and carefully swirl once on top of the jam. Thanks RedApple for giving me an excuse to make these again, on Canada Day!

I'm soooo glad I came across this recipe (again)! I had it in my collection for years, but somehow managed to lose it. Thanks for posting it.
I divide the batter in half, and tint one part. Then I do a checkerboard pattern by dropping alternate colors of batter onto the base. You can make the 'drops' as large / small as you like. Tint the frost with a complementing color. Great addition to any dessert tray.

I love this great tasting and easy to make but I had to refrigerate it so the icing would become solid enough s I could cut it but other than that it was perfect
