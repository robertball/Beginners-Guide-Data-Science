I made this for my coworkers and they loved it!  The cheese melted just enough to make it kind of springy.  I loved the texture and flavor with the salsa.  Such an easy and flavorful recipe for a party!

Great flavors and the added jalapenos add a nice kick. Queso fresco takes on a smoother texture when heated.
