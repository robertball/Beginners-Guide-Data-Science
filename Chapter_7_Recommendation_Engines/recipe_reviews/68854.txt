I made several adjustments because the original recipe was too chalky and not chocolatey enough for our taste.  We used half and half instead of powdered creamer and doubled the halfand half, cocoa, and vanilla extract.  We also topped it off with whipped cream!  Raised the carb count, but it tasted just like Starbucks!

Mmmm....  I'm on a low carb diet and this was a wonderful treat!  I'm not a big fan of ricotta cheese but in this, you have no idea that's what you are having.  Make sure you use strong coffee because mine was too weak.

I used 4 packages of sweetener but did not get the sweetness I was looking for. Perhaps I will use a liquid sugar-free flavoring next time.

I thought this was really good. I made it low carb by using three packets of Splenda, sugar free vanilla syrup, sugar free chocolate syrup and leaving out the powdered coffee and cocoa powder. I blended the mixture and then poured over ice. There were a few bits of ricotta in the drink but it didn't bother me. Texture was fine.

This was very good for a sweet treat! I used sugar free vanilla Torani syrup and 1/8 splenda and half and half instead of the powder creamer. Very good!

Ick. There wasn't enough ricotta in this to make it creamy, but enough in it to make it have a weird, grainy texture. Flavor wasn't terrible, but the texture definitely wasn't good.

This wasn't sweet enough or chocolately enough for my tastes so I added some sugar free chocolate syrup. The ricotta also did not blend up very well for me. I make a simlar drink with cottage cheese that seems to do fine in my blender so I don't think I'll use ricotta in a drink again.

Didn't care for this and thought it tasted chalky.  But then I've never been on a low-carb diet so maybe this is normal.

I am low carb and liked it. I, like some others found it a bit chalky. I used powdered espresso mixed to 2/3 c for one. I also used regular half and half and liquid SweetEz to taste. Nice for a treat.
