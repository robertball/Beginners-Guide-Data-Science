I left out the hot beef link sausage and used dried peas.  This was awesome.  The smoked turkey leg gave a far superior flavor than my usual  smoked ham  hock.  Will make this my standard recipe for black-eyed peas.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty! I made these black eyed peas for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit! I used dried peas as well. I used only one diced sausage link and the smoked turkey leg. Honestly, the turkey leg by itself is probably good enough for seasoning these peas. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Made this for New Years 2010! Absolutely the best!!! I truly don't think you could top this. I couldn't find a smoked turkey leg so I used a smoked turkey sausage and I added all the last hour the peas were cooking. I also used dried black eyed peas.

Great recipe Tam!  Glad to see someone remembers hot water cornbread.  I am a Texas raised country boy with influences in food from deep east Texas as well as Louisiana!  To me, nothing finer on earth than good old country, soul food and REAL Mexican food (not that Tex-Mex stuff).  Even though I do need a dose of TM every so often!

Best black eyed peas ever! I'm a vegetarian, so I left out the turkey and the sausage, but everything else I cooked as directed. I served it with turnip greens and the homesteader's cornbread from this site. Wonderful!

I know I made a pot of black-eyed peas last year and I used a recipe on AR but I couldn't remember which one and I guess I forgot to rate it. Used this recipe with some changes (namely a leftover ham bone instead of the turkey leg) and used another recipe on here (CB's) for the method in a slow cooker. Thanks for the inspiration---just tasted some and they were delish! Happy New Year! Thanks, Tam!

I used dried black-eyed peas and just smoked turkey necks (no turkey legs or sausage).  Very good.  Boiled turkey necks and other ingredients for about an hour, poured peas in and simmered for about 1.5 hours, and it turned out fabulously.

These are out of control GOOD! You can spice them up however but don't leave out the turkey leg! I didn't use sausage, added some bay leaves and celery and used a broth/water combo. I will probably reduce the amount of liquid by atleast a cup next time. YUMMMMMM.

I made this dish for thanksgiving and people who don't even eat black eyed peas went back for seconds. I left out the turkey and just added the beef hot links along with the other ingredients. I added about a tablespoon of cumin which brought out a lot of flavor. This recipe will be the ONLY way I make black eyed peas.

this was my first time making black eyed peas that didn't come out of a can and they taste amazing! I used smoked turkey wings instead of a leg and no beef sausage (my father doesn't eat red meat) and I diced some green peppers in as well. I also used dried beans instead of frozen. So pleased with my first attempt!

Perfect! Don't add the salt seasoning until the end of cooking. Then allow it to sit for 30 minutes to allow seasoning to marinate or prepare the night before.

I made Tam's recipe for New Year's day. I didn't use the sausage and it was incredible, everyone really loved this dish.  After spooning up a bowl of these black-eyed peas I shook some Crystal hot sauce over the top and this gave some heat and another slight flavor profile which was incredible.  I'm going to make them again in a few weeks, super good!

Sooooo good!  Followed the instructions with the smoked turkey leg but also added in smoked beef sausage and used chicken broth instead (just enough to cover the meat).  With all the smoked meat, I decided to skip the seasoned salt and sugar.  I doubled my recipe and my family of 4 devoured it!  My daughter had like 3 servings.  Full of flavor!!!  Will most definitely make again.

This is now my go-to recipe for black-eyed peas. However, I didn't stop to think about the amount 3lbs of beans would make so I now have a year's supply of frozen peas :-) The tast was very good, close to what Mom and my Grandmothers, and Aunts used to make. Even omitting some ingredients, it still tasted great. No turkey legs at the store, so I used two links of turkey sausage. Next time, I'll listen and go with three. Didn't have garlic salt, so used a little garlic powder. Didn't have seasoning salt so used sea salt. Used dried beans after soaking over night. Still tasted great!!!!!  The only change I'll make next time is to cut the portions in half.

This one is a keeper. I used 2 New Orlean's style beef sausage links. Since we wanted to eat this as a side dish and not a soup, I added just enough water to cover the peas instead of the 6 cups. The only think that would have set it off was corn bread!!! That'll be added tomorrow with the left overs.

This is awesome. I didn't have seasoned salt So I substituted Creole seasoning and a few sprinkles of red pepper. Also used andouille sausage. Gave it a nice kick . Excellent Will definitely make again. Also added some chopped up kale for vitamins and color. Looked so pretty .

These recipe was a big hit!  I only thing that I did different was that I had to change the amounts to make enough for one bag of beans (there are only two of us) and used two smoked turkey legs instead of the sausage.  I will try it again with the sausage.  THANKS TAM!

So, I followed the recipe to a T, except....I only had 2 packages of black eye peas so I had to add a package of lentils. Other than that it turned out wonderful.  Next time i will make sure to have 3 packages of peas.

Very tasty!  I tested for seasoning half way through and found it to be a tad salty but I think that was the fault of the smoked turkey leg I used, not the fault of the recipe.  Added a cut potato and that took out the saltiness.  I like the spice and flavor of this dish and will be making again.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This recipe is absolutely WONDERFUL!  LOVE IT!  WILL MAKE AGAIN!  I always use fresh dried beans.  Be sure to soak the beans in water for a day or night and change it out 2-3 times to release the gases.  And as for all my recipes that call for water, I use stock instead...in this case, vegetable stock.  UPDATE:  I still continue to make this recipe.  It does not disappoint!
