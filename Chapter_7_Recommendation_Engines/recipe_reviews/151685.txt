My family really enjoyed this recipe.  It's quick and easy for a week night.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add salt and pepper to the pork chops and I put the stuffing on top of the chops.  It came out excellent. Thanks for sharing this one--it's a keeper!

Some minor changes I made:  I seasoned the pork chops and quickly seared them first.  I don't like gray looking chops!  I used lawry's and some garlic/pepper.  I greased the dish and put the prepared stuffing (stovetop brand) down first. Put the chops on top, covered with the cream of celery soup and milk mixture and then covered with foil.  Baked for 30 min.  Easy and good!

This is a great way to make pork chops.  I've never had good luck cooking pork chops on the stove top so I'm thrilled to have found this recipe. 

I used one bag of plain dressing/stuffing.  I diced half an onion, one carrot and one celery stalk and cooked them in a little butter.  I added sage to the veggies and then mixed in the dressing.  I mixed the dressing with 2 cups of chicken broth.

I sprinkled the pork chops with Mrs. Dash and CONCENTRATED cream of mushroom.  I did not mix the soup with milk and everything came out plenty moist.  

FANTASTIC

With a little help, this can be a great recipe. Before making the stuffing, I sauteed 1-1/2 stalks of diced celery, 1/2 a medium-sized onion (diced) in 2 tbl. butter. I also added 1 tsp sage, and 1/2 tsp thyme before I added the water and butter to the stuffing cubes. Needed a little longer than 30 mins to bake, but turned out pretty good.

I have made this in various ways for years - best part is if it is made just like the recipe says it is 40 mins start to finish, perfect for weeknights. I usually use cream of mushroom soup with either pork or mushroom & onion stovetop stuffing. I also season the pork chops with salt, pepper, italian seasoning & paprika before covering them. Delicious!

We have a similar recipe in my family that we have used for years and in my opinion it's much more flavorful.  First cook the porchops for 30 min. till done, drain and set aside.  Then cover with the following mixture:a can each of cream of celery and cream of mushroom condensed soup, 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup bbq sauce, and 1-2 T mustard.   prepare the stuffing as directed and folled into one end of pan.  Cover with foil and bake an additional 30 min.  This tastes so delicious, it's so tender the meat just falls of the pork chops.

This is a family favorite. Be careful not to overcook the pork chops. I use a slightly lower temp in the oven.

This was good and really simple. I did as another reader suggested and put the stuffing down first, then topped it with the chops and then the soup mixture. I didn't use the cheese.

I add 1 tsp. of celery seed, 1 tsp. white pepper, and 1 Tblsp. of poultry seasoning to the stuffing mix.  My husband LOVES this dish!  I love it because it's so easy! Sometimes, I add chopped onion to the stuffing mix, too.

My pork chops were so thick, I decided to stuff them as well.  I also added some sausage to the cornbread stuffing.  Yum!

I had too much stuffing to put it in the middle so I put the chops on top. This created a very soggy, mushy dish. I wish I had read the reviewer that put the stuffing on top, I would think it turned out better. Over all though I liked the flavor and the ease of preparation.

This is our new family FAVORITE! We season the pork chops with some paprika, salt, pepper and italian seasonings and then follow the recipe as is.... My 6 year old has gotten so good at this she can nearly make it herself and says she can't wait to get married so she can make it for her family!

I used a thicker cut of tenderloin, 1 1/2 inch, and it ended up a little bland. I think it was because the meat to stuffing & soup ratio was skewed. Perhaps it would be better with the 3/4 inch cut.

This recipe turned out to be mushy and bland. I doubled the stuffing and gravy and used bone in pork chops, so I don't know if any of that had anything to do with it. I won't be making this again.

This was so disappointing. I followed the exact recipe. It was bland, very little flavor, and mushy.

This was a great base idea ..... it came out super moist. I mostly followed the recipe as give with only minnor tweaks ...1- used chickrn broth instead of water 2- used two boxes of stove top (it was all i had on hand) 3- used four boneless chops 4 - put stuffing underneath chops and 5 i quickly browed the chops before cooking in oven ...... thanks for this idea it was simple fast and easy...i think next time i make this i will add to the dressing ..like apples and onions ....this ones a keeper

Mmmm boy! This was delicious!! I did a few things different. I seasoned the chops with Lawry's seasoned salt before searing them a few minutes on each side. I spread the stuffing over the top of the chops and poured the soup mixture over that. I didn't have cream of celery so I used cream of onion instead. And I didn't sprinkle with cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe.  It was easy and delicious.  I am wondering why people would not like this except maybe they made it wrong, the pork chops go on the bottom, soup mix then add the stuffing and bake covered w/alum. foil (brown the pork chops first).

I was really hoping this would be good as the recipe is written, but it was bland and the pork chops over-cooked in the 30 minutes.  Definitely needs some fresh herbs, maybe garlic. My kids suggested using chicken next time.  But the Pepperidge farm cornbread stuffing is good.

Tried this recipe recently and was disappointed in it....after reading about pouring the soup over the pork chops, I thought, how is that not going to make the stuffing really moist?  I was right...when I pulled it out of the oven, the stuffing was just too wet.  It was like eating stuffing soup.  There still was some of the soup on the pork chops, but it mostly just saturated the stuffing.  I liked the taste of it, but to be honest I think I would not fix this again.
