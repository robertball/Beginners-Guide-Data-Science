I really liked this however I felt the "spicy" got lost. I think red peeper flakes would bring more heat but that is just my opinion. I made two different salmon jerky recipes this weekend and this one was by far the best. I may just tweak it a little next time. Plenty of flavor but just not enough heat for me.
