I got the old recipe(add flour to right consistency), thank you so much for the ammounts, i used to get together with my grandmother every christmas and make these. This is a wonderful recipe for cookies, the longer u keep them, the better they become...If they last that long... Great cookies to decorate any way u like...

Had trouble getting thin enough, but otherwise, just like Grandma used to make.
