This was very different than any other clam dish I've had. It was very sweet; actually much sweeter than I expected. I'd make it again but I'd love to know what others are serving with this dish. I served miso soup but that wasn't a very good match to the flavor of this dish.

I made this recipe a couple of months ago and my hubby, who is sceptical of clams, loved it.  When he asked for it today I dug out the recipe, added it to my recipe notebook (only recipes I will prepare again and again make it in), and decided I should add my review.    I prepared the clams as per the recipe.  At the end I sprinkled it with lots of green onions sliced in long, diagonal slices just to pretty it up.    This one is a keeper - easy to prepare and delicious.  Many thanks to Lilibeth for the recipe.

I haven't try this recipe yet, but it sounds good. I just want to post my question here for those who have tried this recipe. The amount of liquid (sake, mirin, rice vingar, and soy sauce) seen to be very little compare to the amount of clams. Is that work out OK? Or I should double the liquid? Thanks

This is really delicious. I quadrupled this recipe, but only doubled the butter. Excellent - thanks!

the flavor was to die for, but we may have slightly overcooked out clams; they were slightly chewy.

The goal is to achieve clarity in the broth.  So I ditched the soy  sauce  and used kosher salt.  Also added another dash of good sake  after taking clams off the fire in order to taste a bit of the alcohol.

I use Countnecks ,the smallest legal size
Or Littlenecks the next size bigger
After I steam them open I losen the clam in it's half of the shell,but don't separate the other half of the shell. I give it a 10
