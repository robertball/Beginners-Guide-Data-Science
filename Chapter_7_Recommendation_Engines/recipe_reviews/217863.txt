never mind the flour tortillas.  We are gluten free, so just grill the shrimp.  Make a really good guacamole,  Use corn tortillas crisped, and we are set.  A little freshly made salsa out of tomatoes, cilantro, onions etc goes great with it too.

I needed a new idea for the shrimp that was in my freezer.  This is a great recipe! I cooked in a pan instead of grilling but it was still good :)

Really good! One mistake from making it completely sugar free. Most white flour products have added sugar in them. But to get around that, just buy whole grain tortillas :) Other than that they were amazing.

These were incredible but I made a few changes. I added a crushed garlic clove to the marinade and put it and the shrimp in a bag to sit for an hour. We grilled the shrimp in a grill basket instead of skewers and they looked so pretty I decided not to chop them up. I also didn't have the salad kit so I mixed ranch dressing with a little salsa, and skipped the sour cream. We loved these, the dressing was a perfect compliment to the citrusy shrimp.

amazing flavor.  I cooked on stove top with a grill pan (too many things going on in the kitchen for me to walk outside to grill).  Good warm as well as cold!  A definite keeper.  May use it by itself for a meal (add veggie and salad)  without the tacos.

Came out great!  Instead of southwest salad, I made fresh mango salsa (recipe on this site), added some avocado slices, & shredded Mexican blend cheese and served in warm corn tortillas.  They were delish!  Can't wait to make again.

I loved this meal but I did make several changes. I diced jicama into sticks and added grilled zucchini and mushrooms instead of the salad. I also made my own sauce - one tablespoon low fat ranch and three tablespoons salsa.  I also made my own tortillas from a recipe of this site.  LOVED!

The recipe for the actual shrimp is awesome. However, I'm glad I read a lot of the comments. We also decided to take ranch & mix with salsa, we used a peach salsa & did 3 parts ranch to the 2 parts salsa & it was AMAZINGLY good. Saw it mentioned in several comments, so we decided to try it & it rocked. Thanks for the awesome shrimp part & idea! Wish I could save this twist on it without paying them stupid money just to do so! I highly recommend adding this in the recipe as a tip at the end or something. Since so many commenters ended up doing that & it worked so well. :)

Couldn't find the Dole salad, so just mixed Ranch Dressing w/ some salsa & added a dash of Pico Pica hot sauce.  Sauteed the shrimp on the grill using one of those frying pans w/ holes (I hate threading skewers!) The smokiness of the grill w/ the lime juice & zest made for great shrimp.  Thanks!

Amazingly simple yet full of flavor - only thing I added was a bit of chopped tomato and avocado because I love it, but otherwise no changes.

This was really yummy.  I didn't used the packaged salad mix, just chopped up some lettuce and some green onion.  Then I layered sour cream, salsa, shrimp and lettuce mix onto a tortilla.  Very good! I used the marinated grilled shrimp recipe from this site. I gave tree stars for a good idea but it seeems I didn't use much of the actual recipe

These were super-easy and everyone loved them! My very picky 12-year-old son rated them "28 out of 10". I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't bother to chop up the shrimp. Yummy!

I accidentally added a little cilantro by mistake..thought it was cumin..So,we had a cilantro/cumin seasoning.  Not sure it made a difference, but these shrimp were excellent.. Sometimes mistakes turn out well….

These were really good and easy! I don't have a grill, so I just sauteed the shrimp in the lime-oil mixture. Was very tasty.

My sons' are baseball players so they always rate my dinners in terms of baseball terms ... this one was a "home run" :). The only change I made in order to make it a bit more healthy, was instead of using the dressing in the salad mix, I got fat free sour cream, low fat cheddar and a little reduced fat ranch. I mixed those together for the sauce. Outstanding.

These were a big hit with my family.  It's easy and fast to make.  I'd recommend using more shrimp.  We used 2 lbs for 3 people and that seemed to work.  We had a bit left over for the next day.

Great fast food when stressed for having dinner a bit late. I used frozen shrimp instead and had a healthy meal instantly. I also used flour tortilla, added fresh diced tomatoes, frozen mangoes and  fresh spinach.

Added garlic to the marinade, and let soak for an hour before grilling. Used corn tortillas, cabbage, and a ranch avocado sauce that I found on this site, and it was delicious! I always grill my shrimp on skewers because it doesn't taste the same when I cook them in a pan. But in S.Cal we cook outdoors year round.

Simply amazing, cooked this for my girlfriend who is a huge shrimp fan. Since my apartment complex does not allow for grilling i pan seared the shrimp to perfection as a substitute.

We made this recipe for Cinco De Mayo and it was fantastic!  It was a great mixture of flavors and not difficult to make.  We added some homemade salsa and grilled some zucchini and red peppers to serve with it.  Will definitely be making this again.

Amazing shrimps. Grilling them adds a bit of irresistible smoked flavor. It easily feeds a crowd. Simple and fast to make. This just became my favorite taconite choice.

Better idea to use a smaller size tortilla, such as 6 inch, or even  
4 inch. Otherwise, very good

This is an easy go-to meal for my busy family during the week. This recipe isn’t trying to be gourmet, but it gets the job done. Easy to find ingredients on the fly with easy prep.  Really tasty. Not Torchy’s tacos, but almost as fast.

The marinade for the shrimp was amazing. I didn't have the exact salad mix so i had to wing it a little. I made the sauce with ranch dip mix and taco seasoning in sour cream. And that ended up being delicious. The tacos were absolutely delicious. My husband couldn't stop talking about how good it was over dinner.

I combined 2 recipes together l used the sauce recipe from the spicy grilled tacos and the southwest salad mixture from this recipe. I put them on skewers and grilled them. I then cut the shrimp up slightly and made the tacos that way. They are a great hit while tailgating at Raiders games.

These were delicious! The shrimp were absolutely delicious. The cumin paired perfectly with the shrimp! I added cilantro to the shrimp marinade because it works and I have a ton of it. I grilled the shrimp on a cast iron flat grill pan. I did not use the salad mix because I have food allergies.  To make the ranch sauce I used 1/3 cup sour cream, 1 tsp taco seasoning and 1 tsp dry ranch dressing mix all three together. Serve the taco s with chopped lettuce, tomato, onion and cheese.  Definitely making again as it came together quickly.

Made as recipe stated but as others did I did not use Dole salad kit.  Did lettuce and tomato and made sauce from scratch (2/3rds ranch and a 1/3 peach salsa).  Family loved them.

Fantastic and so easy.  Modified the sauce a bit to our tastes, needed more.  Also served with fresh mango.  Needs less grill time.

This was pretty good, but I feel like the shrimp could've used a little more kick...the lime juice and cumin just didn't add quite as much flavor as I'd like. I'd probably make it again, but maybe add a pinch of cayenne next time!

Great recipe! The flavor of the shrimp was amazing. I couldn't find the dole salad kit so I mixed tomatoes and avocados with a little lime juice, bought the store ready mixed slaw and lime cilantro flavor ranch dressing.

Delicious.  I did not have the southwest salad mix, so I made my own with ranch dressing and taco seasoning.  I also used the taco seasoning on the shrimp (with the lime and oil) b/c I didn't have any cumin.  Grilled them in my Pampered Chef grill pan in the kitchen.

I marinated the shrimp in the lime mixture and cooked them in a skillet....I used frozen shrimp which I will NOT do next time... I'll get fresh, but they were still good just not as good as I think they could've been.  The taco ranch seasoning I made by mixing the prepared Hidden Valley ranch packet with cumin,  red pepper,  garlic etc. So I can control the level of salt and unnecessary ingredients,  but that was SO good on the tortillas...they were very fresh tasting and light...I will use more fresh shrimp next time, but overall they were very good!  :-)

These were some pretty good tacos. My only critic is that there  was not enough of the southwest ranch mixture for all 4 of us, so we had to go easy on it. Other than that it was a good easy and yummy recipe.

I love this recipe! I didn't use the taco kit, just made my own and didn't use cumin but it turned out delicious. 2nd weekend for my husband to grill out some fresh shrimp on the grill :)

Thanks!

We deviated a little bit on the marinade. We used a Hawaiian marinade for half and some Tapatio sauce on the other half. Epic.

I served this simple recipe along with grilled onions and a Cilantro Serrano Cream Sauce found on this site.  Used the lime mixture as a 15-minute marinade (along with some minced garlic), and didn't bother to chop the shrimp.  No salad kit...just lettuce and tomato.  A big hit with the wife and baby!

I did not grill the shrimp. I just tossed the shrimp and the misture in a bowl, then cooked them on the stove top. They were still delicious and flavorful! Otherwise, I followed the receiped exactly, just adding guacamole to my tacos. This is such an easy recipe and I love how all the incredients come in the Dole Salad Kit. Makes it easy to shop for!

Amazing!  Next time I will try with taco seasoning mix on the shrimp instead of the lime.  Loved the dressing that came with the salad mix.
