This is an EXCELLENT and easy pie.  I used a ready-made graham cracker crust.  I also needed to let it cool longer than one hour in order for it to be set well.  I think the next time I make it, though, I will use another 4 oz. cream cheese and more sugar, as I really like the flavor of the cream cheese.  AWESOME PIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone loved it!!!

Worth trying!  I've made it twice and the second time I forgot to add sugar- it still turned out great.

I feel bad about this but I have to give this recipe a serious thumbs down! I planned to make this for a teacher luncheon and THANKFULLY I made a trial run first. It was just a total flop. I followed the recipe and it never set up, even the next day the top was set but the inside runny. If anyone else ran up against this and knows how to resolve it, I would consider trying my hand at it again. Otherwise, stick w/ another recipe!!!

Made this recipe for our family's Easter dinner and it was definitely well received! I added another 1/2 pkg. cream cheese, as well as 1 Tbsp margarine and 6 Tbsp thawed Cool Whip. Turned out great!

I made this last Thanksgiving.  It tasted a bit more like pudding-y than cheesecake-y.  You can't beat it for ease.

This recipe was AWESOME!  My husband, who doesn't normally eat sweets, absolutely loved it!  We added some fresh strawberries on top and made it even better.  The sweetness of the strawberries with the tart lemon was a wonderful combo.  Also, I added about a tablespoon of lemon zest to the pudding after it had boiled for a little extra tart.  Overall, PERECT!!  Can't wait to make it for a function!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It had great consistency, flavor and was super easy!  It resembled our favorite recipe, Sour Cream Lemon pie but was easier and had less calories.

Easy, but not great.  It may have been better with more cream cheese, but I won't try again.

After reading reviews I decided to make this recipe. The only adjustment I made was to add a bit more creamcheese and a splash of lemon juice. I had a huge problem getting the creamcheese to melt (it stayed as little lumps throughout the pudding). I stirred it (over low heat...gently simmering) for probably at least 15-20 minutes before I gave up and dumped the mixture into a bowl and beat it with an electric mixer until the creamcheese was more disolved. It still never got perfectly smooth. I poured it into the crust and it set and had wonderful flavor, but was slightly lumpy. I plan on trying this again and pre-softening/melting the creamcheese in the microwave prior to adding it to the pudding to see if it helps.

I followed the recipe exactly and took it to a potluck. It got rave reviews and many asked for the recipe. I even liked it and I don't usually care for lemon pie. I didn't have any problems with how it set up at all.

I think this needs more cream cheese and less lemon.  It seemed more of a heavy lemon meringue to me so it wasn't what I expected.

I must have done something wrong, because the cream cheese would not melt all the way for me. It ended up in small clumps, and was like eating lemon tapioca pudding. The flavor was good though.

Quick and Easy...but I was hoping for a more "pukery" lemon flavor.  If you like a mild lemon taste...then you'll love this!!!

I read all the reviews first. 
 so I added 3 tablespoons of real lemon juice to the pudding mixture make sure the pudding was nice and thick. Used 2 8oz cream cheese not 1. Put the cream cheese and sugar in my mixer, poured hot pudding over...Mixed it up perfectly.  
Made my own graham cracker crust baked. Turned out perfect!

I also found that adding the cream cheese to the pudding mix made for a lumpy mixture.  Instead add the the pudding mixture a little at a time to the cream cheese and stir well after each addition. Also adding real lemon juice and extra cream cheese makes it better. It doesn't have that fake lemon flavor that way.

I used choco pudding because my family is picky and won't eat lemon.   Fabulous results!  The whole fam loved it!!  Will try again with lemon pudding for me; I personally love lemon even though the rest of my fam doesn't.

I love this recipe!
I love lemon pie, and this is a definite upgrade!
I made my crust with graham cracker crumbs, but used 1 egg instead or 2 egg yolks and omitted the sugar that is supposed to be added with the cream cheese.
    It was perfect, the sugar that you add to the lemon pudding (per the pudding recipe) was plenty.
      Very good, my new favorite!

Very good lemony pie.  As suggested by some reviewers, I added an additional 4 oz. cream cheese.  Next time I will add 4 oz. more.  I would like this to be a little more cheesy.  Also, recipe makes a lot of filling.  I had enough for 2 pies---one with graham cracker crumb crust, one traditional crust.  Both tasted excellent.

Quick and easy for those times when you don't have enough time for a baked cheesecake but want or need cheesecake badly! I served this recipe in individual ramekins garnished with candied lemon and mint leaves and got requests for the recipe and seconds!!
