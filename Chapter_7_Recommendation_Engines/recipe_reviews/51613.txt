I love this recipe and it has become a part of my regular rotation. It is a nice change from the usual sauce and pasta and an interesting way to serve tortellini. I make a couple of changes: add 2 tsp. of minced garlic, increase the stir-fry sauce to 1/2 cup and leave off the peanuts. To make the dish a tad bit more filling I add a chicken breast that is cut up into strips. I highly recommend this recipe.

I was so anxious to try this and very disappointed upon tasting it. I had to make something else for dinner. My husband liked this better than I did though he thought it was weird to have cheese tortellini in stir fry. Upped the red pepper and also added more stir fry sauce and garlic. I put it in the fridge thinking maybe today it will reincarnate itself as a cold pasta salad. If not, I will not be making it again.

Surprisingly good, although I did have to alter the recipe ingredients a little to what I had on hand. I didn't have tortellini so I used cheese-filled raviolini. I also substituted olive oil for the oil and I didn't have stir-fry sauce so I created my own by using almost 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1 tsp ginger, about 1/2 tsp sesame oil and 1/2 tsp cornstarch. I used a wok to cook everything in instead of a large pan. It was very quick and easy. A little salty because of all the soy sauce, but very delicious. Very different, distinct flavor with the pasta, but very good. Thank you for the recipe...a keeper!

We love this recipe.  We leave the crushed red pepper out for the kids but it gives a nice kick to it.  We've used both Peanut sauce and Garlic flavored stir fry sauce- both are good but garlic is my fave.  SO fast it makes a great weeknight meal.

I wasn't sure how this would be since it's not a combination that I'd usually think of, but it was surprisingly good. I really liked the mix of veggies and pasta, & it was a good way to get some nutrition into a pasta dish.

We really liked this recipe.  We used frozen veggies but next time we'll probably use fresh.
