These were so easy to make and so, so yummy!  I used a crunchy peanut butter for a more pronounced peanut taste...  To prepare the chocolate filing, use a glass measuring cup and melt the ingredients in the microwave.  Using the measuring cup, allows you to "reheat" the chocolate as necessary for an easy "pour".  These disappeared as quickly as I filled the "cups" with my family clamoring for more!!!

These were excellent! I made the recipe exactly as indicated, except I DOUBLED the cookie dough/muffin part (I used the exact amount of chocolate filling ingredients per the recipe, though). That gave me exactly the amount of chocolate filling I needed, since I read other people's reviews that they had too much chocolate left over. I made the exact amount of chocolate in the recipe, but doubled the amount of cookie dough, and the amount of chocolate filling came out perfect for the doubled batch of muffins. 

The trick I learned to getting the muffins to come out without any trouble was this--as soon as they are out of the oven, go ahead and use the melon baller to make the indentation in the muffin (as recipe indicates). Then, let the muffins rest in the pan about 10 minutes before you remove them from the pan--mine came out perfectly. I just used a sharp knife and it took no effort to remove them. I also greased the mini-muffin pans before using, so that may have helped, and baked them exactly for 14 minutes. I highly recommend these--they are visually very appealing also. It looks like you spent a lot of time making them, when they were really pretty easy. Thanks for the great recipe Deborah! They will become a staple of our household, and not just for Christmas.

Excellent!!  I made the recipe as written.  I used the pestle (from my mortar & pestle) to make the well in the center.  It was well worth the time it took.  I didn't have to double the dough but I did make sure that the well was deep without making the bottom see through.  I let them cool for about 8 minutes before removing them from the pan and transferring them to the cooling wracks.  Then I let them cool for another 15 minutes before I started on the fudge filling.  There was maybe enough left over fudge to fill two more puddles. The result was delicious!

Yum! I used a small cookie scoop instead of making balls and filled the mini-muffin tin.  This was done in a snap.  I ended up with 36, I didn't double the recipe.  I also used the scoop to fill the cookies with the fudge filling.  The scoop is about 1 oz.  Make sure not to overbake.  Take out of the oven when they start to brown.Very easy and very yummy.  The chocolate center is rich. The peanut butter cookie cup does not stand out. You will have a little fudge left over, put it in a small plastic container and chill it and you have yourself some fudge!   UPDATE ------- I find the trick to removing the cookie without them breaking is to rotate them by pressing gently in to the right or left.  Once they start to spin they come out without breaking. They should cool around 10 minutes before attempting to do this.

These look sooo fancy! You can't go wrong with PB and Chocolate. While I did not have difficulty removing my cookie base from the muffin tin, it does take a little bit of time to remove 24 to 48 of them one-by-one. So I would recommend that you only make the filling once they are all removed from the pan and cooling on the rack. Otherwise, your fudge will start to set in the pot while you're taking them out. I found it a little difficult to scoop up the right amount of filling so that I wouldn't overflow or end up with drips ruining the perfect edges. Any tips out there?

Looks so fancy with such little effort!  The taste is very good too.  The fudge center is awesome!  This cookie intrigued me for a Christmas type of offering, but my kids liked it enough to have more often and it was certainly easy enough.  It was a 5 star, recipe for ease, presentation, and taste, but I fixed a double batch of dough as per reviewers suggestions.  I used my mini muffin tins, and had 70 cookies to fill.  My issue was there was enough fudge to fill 48 cookies full, or about 55 cookies 3/4 full.  This recipe is perfect on amounts so don't make extra dough as suggested, unless you want a lot of peanut butter muffin shells.  :-) Thanks for a keeper recipe!

Superb concept. As many others have noted, you must have patience and not try to take them out of the tins too soon. I found that waiting about 10 minutes allowed them to pop out easily by simply inserting the tip of a knife between the outside of the cookie and the tin. Only 4 stars because we disliked the artificial taste and megawatt sweetness imparted by the  condensed milk. Having a hunch as to how to improve the filling, I heated about 1/3 cup of heavy cream until the edges got bubbly, adding 2 Tb butter and 6 ounces of milk chocolate and 6 oz bittersweet chocolate, both Ghirardelli. Stirred it until the chocolate was melted and the mixture was perfectly smooth and shiny, then filled. OFF THE FLIPPIN' HOOK'!! The tender cookie acts as the perfect vehicle for fudgy truffle/ganache  filling. You can easily adjust the sweetness by changing the proportion of milk chocolate to semisweet or bittersweet chocolate you use, according to your taste. The proportions above represent a more adult, sophisticated version of the cookie, not sickeningly sweet as the written filling is. Rich, sinfully chocolate. Now THAT's what I'm talkin' about!!! NOTE: The easiest way to fill is to put your filling in a zip-lock sandwich bag, cut one of the corners off by snipping a small piece of the plastic, and squeeze to fill. If the filling gets a little thick, microwave for 10-15 seconds and it should loosen up enough for you to resume filling. Easy and no mess!

These were really good, I used butterscotch chips instead of Milk Chocolate and it was not my favorite, but everyone who tried them absolutely loved them. These are so easy and impressive, they are going to be a sure thing for cookie trays, catering events, etc.  My daughter said that she liked them better on the second day.  Oh, I had enough fudge left over to make about 20 more.  And, I put the warm fudge in a large squeeze bottle and just went from 'cup' to 'cup' with this yummy goodness!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Where has this recipe been all my life? I did not use mini tins but full-sized and they turned out perfect. I think that by using the bigger tin size you are less likely to have leftover icing. I didn't. The cookie came out perfectly from the tin also. Use a thin, pointed tip of a knife and slide it down at 3 different spots and they come right out. I think putting pecans on top is not necessary.

Great cookies!  My pan is a dark non-stick so I reduced heat to 325.  I used a rounded measuring spoon to make the well then twisted the cookie before I removed them from the pan and didn't have any casualties.  There was a lot of fudge left over but it can be mounded pretty high, it immediately holds it's form.  I did have to reheat as it cools quickly plus the sprinkles I added in lieu of the pecans had to be added after ever few cookies to ensure they'd stick.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  These were incredibly easy to make, and I followed the directions to a tee.
I didn't have a melon baller, so I used the backside of a tablespoon to create the 'wells' for the fudge; worked like a charm.
When using the cookie scoop be sure to scoop just enough as the cookie will spill over the mini-muffin mold.
The peanut butter flavour doesn't stand out as much, but that could be a good thing depending on your taste =)

Okay for those who don't really like peanut butter, or people who can't eat peanut butter, replace it with cocoa powder. My sister did this and everyone loves them. There like little mini brownies with a filling. She added between 3 to 5 tablespoons of the cocoa, and she used the Toll House cocoa. She just baked 120 of them for her sons football team and families, and everyone loved them. Hope this helps someone.

Just had to try this recipe! Very Good!!! I found it easier to remove cookies from pans if you refrigerate for a few extra minutes after the intial 5 minutes cooling. Tastes like a bite size chocolate cream pie with PB crust! Thanks Deborah!

These are the BEST!!!! I now use them for any type of peanut butter cookie I need. We love them with raspberry jelly in them, tastes like a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich.

These are great!  They're very similar to peanut butter blossoms, but much better.  I didn't have any problem popping them out of the muffin tin.  i just used a butter knife and started running it around the edge and they popped right out.  i also didn't have a problem with a lot of leftover fudge...  just about 3/4 cup.  everyone loves these.  it's definitely a keeper.

these are every bit as good as they look.  I took them to a large event and they were the first dessert to disappear.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out beautifully.  I had just enough of both dough and filling.  I used a "Pampered Chef" tool that is made to fit inside of a mini muffin cup to press the dough after they were baked.  I also used silicone muffin pans set on a baking sheet and I found that they actually took longer to bake.  I piped the filling from a pastry bag fitted with a tip into the still warm cups, stuck the whole thing in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes, then popped the entire thing out onto a rack.  Worked better for me this way as the cookie cups didn't warp, crack or crumble with the filling already in them.

Wow!!  These are SO good.  I made them and brought them to work for Valentine's Day.  I just used mini muffin tin with no paper liner, and instead of a pecan I put a Valentines Day peanut butter M&M on top of each one.  They were gone in about an hour.

Absolutely delicious, AND adorable! I will absolutely make these again, no question. I had way too much choco filling left over, so I did what another reviewer said, and put it in a pan for bonus pan of fudge (didn't bother me one bit, haha) Baking them in mini muffin pans with colourful liners worked perfectly.

Excellent cookies and so easy to make! I used a 1 ounce cookie scoop, which only made 24 cups. I used the back of the scoop to make the wells. I simply poured the chocolate filling into each cup directly from the pan (it takes a little finesse and a spouted pan). Each cup was filled to the brim, with only an ounce or so of fudge remaining. Definitely a favorite!

Ok so after reading other reviews, I doubled the cookie part and left the chocolate part as stated in the recipe. It made about 60 cookie cups and I still had chocolate left over. That being said, I left out some sugar so the cookies were not so sweet. They turned out GREAT!!! I will be making these again for sure. Super easy. PS have extra flour handy for making the cookie balls. :)

These turned out great!  Wish I had discovered this recipe before the Christmas holiday.  I let the chocolate set up a bit before I put them in the cup which allowed me to get the chocolate in the center without a mess.  I halved the chocolate part and mixed in a teaspoon of peanut butter and it was a perfect amount.

Delicious!!  This was so easy to make and it looked professionally done. Everyone kept asking where I bought them.  I followed the recipe exactly- I didn't have a mellon baller so used a tablespoon and it  worked perfectly.  This has become a favorite!

Peanut butter cookie and chocolate fudge... WOW.  Absolutely perfect recipe, and indulgent taste.. Hand-down-the-recipe-to-the-grandkids good. DO follow the recipe exactly because it is spot on.  It says 1 inch balls for a reason: larger... and they overflow the mini-wells. And do *immediately* use your melon baller to push down the cookie shell: or the cookie gets too crispy to push down and just cracks.  And, 15 minutes was right on, for my oven. I found that gently twisting the cookie after the 5 min worked perfecly for  removing intact.  THANK YOU debzy! This one is good enough for gifts. And thats coming from someone who is very picky.

these are great cookies...after i made them the first time though, I decided to an opposite cookie, and added 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa, 2 extra tbs butter, and 1 tbs milk to the cookie batter for a chocolate cookie, and used 1/3 cup peanutbutter, 3/4 cup powder sugar, and 1/8 cup flour for a peanutbutter filling...and it was like a reese's peanutbutter cup in a cookie!!  Most excellent

It's only getting 3 stars bc the recipe for the "fudge" is horrendous. I'd made chocolate covered cherry cookies w/a similar recipe, so I knew[through trial & error] not to use as much sweetened condensed milk as stated.... was still wayyyyy too gooey, and artificial tasting.  Don't waste your time w/the fudge recipe.... if you have choc chips on hand just melt em and pour it in the middle or something. 
The cookie recipe however, is amazing!! Great base for ANY filling. I'll prob use reese's pb cups next time, or hershey kisses for an easier, less time consuming recipe.

A frosting bag and tip are a MUST if you want to not kill yourself while making these or if you at least want them to look beautiful like they do in the pics. While filling them (I tried using a ziplock bag with a corner cut) I kept alternately burning myself and spilling fudge everywhere. They looked fantastic though, and although I was regretting making these at the time, THEY TASTED AMAZING! Four days later (they only survived that long because they were on a plate waiting for the recipients to be home-we ended up giving into temptation and eating them-too bad for the neighbors), they were still soft and the fudge was just as delicious as the first day. I will make this recipe again and again!

These did not turn out well for me at all. I followed the directions exactly, and have given many other recipes great reviews. But for this one, the peanut butter shell just tasted okay - nothing special. And the inner fudge tasted alright, it just looked unappealing. The nut did nothing for the appearance or taste. I will not be making these again, sorry.

We made these to give as a part of some holiday gifts. Maybe we did something off, but I wasn't too impressed. I thought they were okay although my husband liked them, says we have to bake more for him. Overall though, cute idea. Careful with your timing on the fudge, you gotta be fast filling the cookies!

Thanks for posting this recipe! I used to love the ones you could get at the mall! I used my own cookie recipe and maked them in regular size muffin tins, but the chocolate fudge was perfect!

VERY GOOD!  I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did melt the chocolate in the microwave stirring at 30 second intervals, then mixed in the vanilla and sweetened condensed milk.  When it came time to add the fudge, I piped it into the cups feeling I could pile it on and make less mess.  Doing it this way, I hardly had any fudge left over.  My only question while making this was whether or not to grease the muffin tins.  I did not and they came out just fine.  There was no need to pick them out individually, just turn over and tap gently.  This recipe is being enjoyed by all.  Thank you debzy for sharing!

Made these for tailgating and they were gone so fast!  I had a few left at home and they stayed fresh in a sealed container for almost a week.  Very good!  I didn't have the condensed milk, so simmered 1/3 cup of milk, 2 tbsp of butter and a dash of vanilla and brought it almost to a boil.  I then added that to the chocolate, covered it with plastic wrap and then stirred after about 5 mins. Worked perfectly.

I'm not a big chocoholic but I love these. My family eats them before I can freeze them for Christmas. I will be making my 3rd double batch in the next week. I have to admit, on the last batch, I cheated and used Betty Crocker Peanut Butter Cookie bag instead of making the cookie part from scratch because I was in a hurry. Still made the fudge part per the directions and they were amazing as usual.

FABULOUS!! Super easy and they look like a million bucks! I baked them in a cupcake pan for 12 minutes in my convection oven at 317 and they turned out great! I also decreased the sugars to 1/3 cup because I used honey roasted peter pan peanut butter which is pretty sweet.

So I was a little worried when I ate the first one, it was warm and gooey but the texture was a little off.  But then I had one in the morning and the chocolate had "set up" and it was fantastic!  I had a little extra chocolate but not too much, probably enough for 3 more.  I made the wells really deep using a wine cork, I just don't think a melon baller would have done the trick.  I topped with chopped peanuts since I already had them on hand.  I melted the chocolate in a pyrex in the microwave.  I did it in 10 second incraments to keep it from burning while the cookies were cooling.  It doesn't need to get hot, just melted.

Took these to a cookie exchange recently.  Everyone wanted to know how I got them into that shape!  These are a great basic cookie for anyone whol loves peanut butter and chocolate.  They are also easy to customize.  I made a double batch of shells and single batch of fudge and it yeilded around 100 cookies.  This is why it is such a great one for cookie exchanges.

I give it four stars. It's a good, easy, no fail recipe. I piped the fudge in with pastry bag and had exactly enough. I agree not to start warming the chocolate chips until after you pull them out of the oven. I just warmed mine in the microwave and they set up perfetly. It is a good recipe and looks really pretty, but taste wise it wasn't a huge wow factor.

I found this recipe for my husband to make for a cookie swap at his job. He made them tonight and had a few left over and I gobbled them up. The cookie is fantastic by itself, but the chocolate just makes it even better. I was actually expecting the chocolate to be a bit thicker. The way it is w/ the recipe is more like a frosting. It's still tasty and yummy though so not even a problem at all.

Mmmmm, these are super yummy!  A little tedious, but worth the effort.  I sprayed my muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray and they came right out.  I used a 1 tsp. measuring spoon to make the wells.  My one grievance with this recipe is that the fudge is too thick to pour into the cups. So I put the fudge in a heavy-duty freezer bag with the corner cut off to squeeze into the cookies.  I wrapped the bag with a towel so I wouldn't burn my fingers.  They came out very pretty with sprinkles.  Ideally, you should use 1.5 times the cookie part, so you don't have any fudge left over.  I doubled the cookie part and had some dough left over, but it was no biggie.  I just added some chocolate chips and baked them up like regular cookies.

These are a favorite in my house!  I get requests to bring them all the time, especially at Christmas.  Make the well deep in the center with the pestle from a mortar and pestle set or with the back of a measuring spoon.  I put the fudge into a piping bag without a tip on it and it fills them beautifully!  I don't put anything on top of the fudge.  Just make sure to hold the piping bag with a tea towel as the fudge is warm!  I think I'll go make some right now!!!  Oh, and they freeze very well

I was disappointed... not as yummy as I expected by the recipe. I couldn't taste the peanut butter and the cookie part seemed kinda bland. They'll get eaten, but I doubt it's worth the effort to make again.

This recipe depends on the chocolate chip brand and the peanut butter you use. If you use good brands that you like, they're going to taste like them. I used Hershey's Milk Chocolate chips and Skippy peanut butter with honey, and they tasted FABULOUS! Very creamy and rich. Actually, they were so good that when I woke up in the middle of the night, I saw my brother (works night shift) sitting at the table with the whole plate in front of him, eating them! Great recipe!

These are really good, and cute!  I gave my mini muffin pans a quick spray to ensure the cookies wouldn't stick.  I managed to get exactly 48 1-inch cookie balls.  Do not over bake.  Used a pestle to make the wells immediately upon coming out of the oven, then let cool in pans for 10 mins.  A little pressure and they turned free, stuck my finger into the well and pulled them right out.  Nice and easy - looked perfect.  I didn't have any milk choc chips the first time, so I used 3oz of choc bark, with 1 cup of semi-sweet chips, plus about 10oz of the milk (still made too much).  Accidentally forgot the vanilla.  Heated in microwave, 30 seconds at first, then in 10 sec increments until smooth (stir after each stint).  Put the melted choc mix into a plastic bag, squeezed out the air, twisted bag closed, snipped the corner and filled the cups.  Easy!  They came out great, and I think taste better the second day (bagged them overnight) once the cookie has softened a little.  UPDATE:  I have experimented with the filling, including adding a couple tbls of creamy peanut butter to it, using a small splash of regular milk instead of the SCM, and also using butter -- all worked fine.  Also, I prefer crunchy peanut butter for the cookie part.

I thought these were pretty good overall.  If you look at the batter, it is the basic peanut butter cookie recipe found in multiple recipes.  You may or may not have extra fudge filling, depending upon how deep your holes are.  I used a teaspoon and made a fairly large hole, and didn't have much left over.  I used 3/4 c semisweet and 1/4 c milk chocolate chips and I thought it was the perfect amount of sweet (others said it was too sweet with 1/2 to 1/2).  I used a metal icing spatula and loosened the sides up on 3 places before turning to remove, and i didn't have any problem with them breaking.  These were a nice change from a traditional cookie.

Made these to take to  a cookie party they are very easy and really good. Next time I will double the cookie part of the recipe since I had enough chocolate filling for two batches.  I will also use less milk chocolate since I like dark chocolate better.

I was so excited to see how these came out.  They were not as complicated to prepare as I thought.  I mixed the dough in my food processor, melted choc chips in the microwave, and got to use my favorite pampered chef gadgets (tart tamper, and trigger-type decorator).  My amounts came out almost perfectly.  I had maybe enough fudge left over to fill about 2 more cups, but not enough to worry about.   This will definitely become a holiday gift regular for me.

I was really hoping to like this more.  The p.b. cup seemed a bit dry and the fudge center was a bit rich for my liking.  Probably just me as it got so many good reviews.

These were so easy and turned out great!  I substituted half of the flour with ground oats for a chewier texture and used about 3/4 cup of peanut butter.  The dough was pretty sticky but still baked up fine with a little extra time.  I only got 24 mini muffin size cookies with the dough.  To make the well, I used the bottom of a shot glass.  For the filling I used a batch of fudge that I had made earlier in the week that didn't set up properly and it was heavenly.  Sprinkled with Christmas sprinkles it looks very festive.

Easy and delicious! I had left over fudge for probably 10-15 more "puddles". I omitted the pecans because I was also making pecan tassies and wanted something completely different from that. So... I used autumn colored sprinkles. I have no patience for double boilers so I used the microwave 20 seconds at a time. Stir, 20 more seconds, stir... until melted. Doesn't take long at all. The fudge sets quite rapidly so I had to reheat (about 15 seconds in microwave) every now and then. I used a plastic bottle (Wilton brand sells 2 for $2 at Walmart) to squeeze the fudge in the cups. I guess you could also use a ziploc bag and just cut the tip (one of the corners) off and use that as a piping baggie. Quite delicious!

So cute. I'd give them 10 stars. Very easy and delicious. I sprayed the mini muffin tins lightly with Pam and had no problem getting them out. Followed the directions exactly as written. I only got 24 and had enough chocolate leftover to make 24 more so next time I will double the cookie dough. This will be a recipe I will be making often.

I sprayed my pan with baking spray to ensure they wouldn't stick. I used a regular sized cookie scoop and rounded the dough in my hand and dropped into the pan. I made a slight indent in the middle with my finger and baked for 14-15 minutes. I found the cookies were not ready to come out 5 minutes after cooling in the pan and it was better to wait 10 or 15 minutes until they set up all the way, otherwise they are still soft and heavy enough where the rim of the cookie breaks apart from the bottoms and they are ruined. I tried to lightly pry them up with a small knife, but I found rotating them in the pan did the trick and them came out perfect with absolutely no problems at all. When they came out, I used my 1 tsp. measuring spoon to make the indent because I don't have a mellon baller. They are soft, not crumbly, no overfilling or any other issues. Don't skip the exact chocolate filling as written, it really makes this cookie.

I made these last night and they turned out perfectly.  I'm only giving a 4 star rating as I have a better recipe (sorry).   I do have a few hints however.  Make sure you do as the recipe says and melt your chips in a double boiler.  Milk chocolate chips just don't melt well in a microwave.  ALSO - stir in the vanilla (to the fudge) LAST!  Vanilla causes the fudge filling to harden up quickly.  You must fill your little peanut butter cups quickly.  I had no trouble as others removing my cups from the pans but in all fairness I have pretty nice non-stick muffin pans - you don't have to grease at all.

Ridiculously delicious! These things are dangerous! I had to make some modifications based on what I had in the pantry. I added 2 tablespoons of Nutella to the peanut butter in order to have half a cup. I used dark brown sugar instead of light. And I used dark chocolate chips instead of milk. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and have discovered my all time favorite treat!

I love these! They were super easy and delicious. I did what a lot of people suggested and melted the chocolate in the measuring cup in the microwave. I ended up spooning it into the cups though, since the pouring was hard to control. 

Every time I've made this I've had leftover chocolate. I did what a lot of people suggested and put it in a dish in the fridge for a fudgy snack, but I also add coconut shavings to it for a little extra flavor.

Great cookie!  I have long made peanut butter cookies with a kiss in the center.  This are much better due to the chocolate being in each bite, not just the center.  Will be using this recipe often!

Mine definitely aren't as pretty as some in the pictures but they sure tasted great!  Made these with my sons to bring to a friends house along with some red velvet woopie pies.  Made 36 cookies and had just the right amount of chocolate fudge to fill each of them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I agree with some other reviewers - the fudge centers were not so great.  Way too sweet and not truly chocolatey.  The cookie part is a keeper, but you should definitely experiment with the puddle.

It was a good recipe. I would not put a nut on top. I think its more appealing to children without nuts. I may try a vanilla based cake to make this cookie for my friend with a peanut allergy.

Oh. My. God. These are to die for. I was a little intimidated by the recipe, but it's really nothing more than making some PB cookies and melting some chocolate. It was so easy. These puppies are rich too, don't let their small size fool you. You won't be popping one after another in your mouth because of the sweetness. Can't wait to pass some of these out to the neighbor lady. The recipe made just enough cookies and just enough filling (which I piped out of a plastic baggie). There's really no need to go doubling anything, unless you're doubling the whole recipe.

These are awesome.  I made it super easy on myself and used Pillsbury Simply Peanut Butter pre-portioned cookie dough and just dropped them into a regular sized cupcake pan.  Used the back of a tablespoon to form the well in the cookies.  Nuked the fudge ingredients together for one minute and stirred until completely melted.  Had two dozen of these baked and filled in about 20 minutes.  How easy is that?  Everyone (including a picky son) raved about them.  Thanks, Debzy, for a great recipes

The Bomb! Everyone loves these.  I used the mini muffin cups and it came out great.  This recipe is fantastic without any modifications but ... Agree with other cooks: 1) make fudge when you are ready to fill 2) put in gallon zip bag to fill the cookies 3) Use 1 cup semi sweet and 1 cup Reese's chips in the fudge to add to the peanut butter flavor.

These were very cute and tasty. The one thing that suprised me was the consistency of the "fudge". It was very sticky, almost like caramel (duh Jess, it has sweetened condensed milk in it), and I had to work fast to get it poured into the cookie cups. Also, the filling burned my fingers a bit as I was pouring (glopping it in with my bare fingers). It was worth the fuss to see the sheer delight on my kiddos faces as they devoured these.

Delicous and simple! I will absolutely make these again! We didnt have a double boiler so I microwaved the chocolate chips till soft (30 seconds or so) then mixed in the condensed milk and microwaved again in 30 sec intervals, stirring inbetween, till blended and smooth. Worked like a charm!

The peanut butter cup was excellent.  However, I ha d alittle problem with the fudge.  I am not sure what happended, but the moment I put the vanilla extract in the melted chocolate it clumped up...I ended up with a clumpy, gooey mess that was very difficult to use to fill the cups.  I think I will stick with the peanut butter cup cookies from this site instead.

Yummy, easy, but WAY too sweet for us.  I want to try using this technique to make sugar cookie cups with slightly sweetened cream cheese filling instead.

I love peanut butter cookies and my DH loves chocolate.  I don't have a mini muffin pan so I used a regular sized muffin pan.  After reading through the reviews, this is what I found most helpful: 1) Cool dough balls for 1 hour prior to baking. 2) Grease your muffin pan before baking. 3) Use bottom of shot glass to make depressions a few mins after cookies come out of oven. 4) My suggestion: Don't make the fudge until the cookies come out of the oven.  The fudge will set quickly and you'll have to keep rewarming it if you make it too early. 5) Make the fudge in the microwave, heating for 20 secs at a time then stirring chips. 6) Add the vanilla extract to the fudge last as it can cause the fudge to harden quickly. 7) Filling substitutions: white chocolate fudge, chocolate ganache, more semi-sweet if you prefer darker chocolate. 8) Topping substitutions: chopped peanuts, peanut butter chips/Reese's Pieces, sprinkles.

I make these almost every year at Christmas. The only thing I do different is top them with chopped peanuts instead of the pecans. My family and friends love these.

I followed the measurements exactly and had the right amount to make 48 cookies.  I had a few spoonfuls of the fudge filling left and gobbled it up before the kids knew there was any left!  I did leave off the pecans and added Christmas sprinkles.  And after reading about the cookies breaking apart I also decided to use mini paper liners which worked out great!  This will definitely stay in my recipe box for special treats and bake sales.

These were just okay. Followed recipe exactly, but baking time is too long. Too much dough made cookies puff up and over sides like muffins. Dough was very sticky and difficult to work with.

While I love the concept, the recipe as written needs work. Bake 14 - 16 minutes? Are you kidding me? I baked for exactly 10 minutes and they were extremely overcooked...unless they're supposed to be a crispy crunchy, very browned cookie. The sides and tops of the cookies in the pictures look a uniform color. Mine are sure not. And the filling...here in Canada sw.cond.milk is sold in 300 ml or about 10 oz. Using that, there is still enough filling left over to fill 48 more cookies. Will try again, cutting baking time at least in half. Each dough ball is just slightly over level of 2 tsp of dough, which makes 48 cookies. Each indentation took 1 tsp of filling.

These deserve 10 stars!! After letting the cookies cool for 5 minutes in the pan, I still found it difficult to remove them from the pan without the top ring wanting to separate from the rest of the cookie.  I think they definitely need more time to cool like other reviewers mentioned.  I actually  made the rest of them in regular muffin cups and thought it was MUCH easier.  Still plenty of room for filling and no waiting for them to cool down so it's a speedier process.  Needless to say they were devoured!!

These we soooo easy! I used mini muffin papers so they came out of the pan like a dream. I also used the end of my whisk to make the wells for the chocolate. I made them nice and deep so I didn't have much chocolate left over. Note: the chocolate is not as messy if you let it cool just a little bit before filling the wells. Yum!

Delicious!! I love chocolate & these are perfect for a craving. Here's what I did: I did NOT double the cookie batch; my cookie wells were deep & used up almost all of the fudge filling (just a little left over for ice cream topping:)  I sprayed the muffin tins before baking the cookies. I made the wells using a round 1 tsp measuring spoon immediately after the cookies came out of the oven. After cooling for a few minutes, I used a sharp knife to cut around the cookies (to loosen them). Then I put the mini muffin tin in the freezer for a few minutes. The cookies just popped right out. They look beautiful! Thanks for the recipe -- my boys will love them when they get home from school!!

Great cookies! I doubled the cookie dough but used a single recipe for the fudge since a lot of people commented that they had too much fudge and it was the perfect amount.  I skipped the pecans since my daughter and I don't like nuts in our cookies although I know it would be great in them if you like them.  I used a small cookie dough scoop so I didn't have to roll them in balls and cooked them for the least amount of time, 14 minutes.  For the fudge, I just put the chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk in a pan on the stove on low heat to melt the chocolate chips. It works fine that way as long as you continually stir. When it was all melted, I took it off the heat and added the vanilla.  I will make these often!

I made these with my 7 year old for a M&M cookie contest. I don't have a mini muffin pan so we made 24 cookies in a regular muffin pan (with some batter left over, maybe enough for 1 or 2 cookies.) After they were cool my daughter put a peanut butter M&M in each well before we added the fudge. We did not use the fudge from this recipe, instead we went with the No Fail Chocolate Fudge from this site. It made enough for these cookies and some left over for 8 pieces of fudge. Before the fudge got hard my daughter put mini M&Ms on top. She got 1st place in the contest for doing something different.

These were pretty good. I still prefer the PB cup in the middle but these were simple. I used mini muffin cup liner and had no problem taking them out after they cooled. Before I put them in the oven I made a small indent with my finger in each one so when it came time to making the well it was alot easier.

Have been making these for years, tried something new this year. Used Nutella instead of peanut butter and made a chocolate cookie cup, and made the fudge with peanut butter and butterscotch chips.. I did 1/2 and 1/2, but I think I would do 3/4 pb and 1/4 butterscotch next time.

These are a fantastic cookie.  I didn't have a melon baller but the back side of a Half Tablespoon did the trick.  I followed the directions exactly and I was very pleased with the results.  The next time I might try to add a little peanut butter to the chocolate but other than that I would not change a thing.  I will definitely make these over and over and over again.  Great Recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I have seen this many times and finally decided to try it. I give it a 5 for taste, although they are really sweet. I also didn't realize until I started making them that they called for a "melon baller." I think it would have been ideal to make a deep enough well. I ended up using a baby spoon, but don't think I dug deep or wide enough. I ended up with more than half the fudge left. I also think a pastry bag would work best for the fudge part. I ended up also spooning that on very carefully. I tried one with some nuts and some without, and I thought they were much better without. I made 1/2 recipe and it yielded 18. Interesting combination.

I made them for a Halloween party and everyone loved them and they were gone super quick!  I will be making these again and next time more!  I will say that I ended up with a lot of the fudge filling left so I'll probably make double the cookie and the same amount of fudge.

This recipe is DELISH! Having made these several times this is what I do for PERFECT PUDDLES every time. 1.) bake in mini muffin tin.... I like Rachel Rays with the pretty orange grips ;-) 2.) use the large end of a melon baller to scoop dough out & plop into tin (no need to roll in a ball just plop dough in the tin) 3.) immediately upon taking out of oven, take a 1 TBLS measuring spoon & using the back side of the measuring spoon make the well in each "cookie". 4.) let cool in pan 10 minutes before removing from pan 5.) a Pampered Chef paring knife is very thin & perfect for removing puddles from pan. 6.) adding vanilla to the chocolate chip mixture will make it goopy. If you want the extra vanilla, just add the extra teaspoon to the peanut butter dough. 7.) melt chocolate chips & SC Milk in microwave in 30 second increments. Once melted & stirred until smooth, pour into plastic Wilton decorating bottle. It will almost all fit and pours PERFECTLY & neatly into the puddles. your Fudge Puddles will be picture perfect!

It was a good cookie, not awesome.   Got 20 little muffin shaped cookies and filled them up really well with the filling.  Followed the recipe exactly and yes way too much filling left over.  Got to find something to do with it maybe fudge.

I must have done something wrong because these were HORRIBLE!
The cookie recipe is similar to another that I found on here, for the peanut butter part anyway. I followed the recipe exactly as it states, even went out and bought a melon baller. However, when I removed them from the trays, easy enough, and waited for them to cool -- when I added the fudge filling the cookies melted and I ended up with literal fudge puddles all over my table.
Out of the 48 cookies, only 20 survived. The rest melted everywhere. I tried making them a second time, only this time I left the cookies IN the tray and added the fudge. Though it prevented them from melting everywhere, it was near impossible to get them out of the trays.
Third time was not the charm either. I probably won't be making these again.

My husband loves these and he's not a big dessert eater.  I've made them 3-4 times.  I agree that you only need half of the chocolate in the recipe.  The trick to making them look good and easy to get out is to spray the pan good and don't overfill with cookie dough.  I used all dark chocolate semisweet and no pecan.  Also I doubled the vanilla.

These were GREAT!!, I'm making more today. I followed the receipe to the T, When making the fudge filling, after filing my decorating bag, I allowed the filling to cool just a bit ( so the filling isnt runny) and then use a decorating tip to fill the wells , so not only were they tasty they looked Great!!

Yummy! If you like chocolate, this recipe will knock your socks off.  I wouldn't call this a cookie by any means, instead I would refer to it as a little piece of chocolate heaven.

I was quite disappointed in this recipe after all the great review I read!  Something is amiss with the baking...either time or temp, but 14-16 min at 325 is too long!  The cookie part was hard and over cooked.  Also, I was expecting a softer cookie!  Someone on the recipe buzz suggested using 1 cup brown sugar instead of the white...might be worth a try, if I made them again.  And will try baking at 350 for closer to 10 min.  The cookie part of this recipe should be doubled to use up all the cholocate filling. I used my Pampered Chef small cookie scoop to make into uniform balls then pressed down on each before baking with an ice cream scoop handle to make the indention. For the filling,  I used a decorator bag with the 1M tip to fill the cookies...worked great!  Also didn't have any milk chocolate chips so used 1/2 cup pb chips and the rest semi sweet.  You can be flexible there.

Way TOO sweet! While the cookie was pretty much your basic peanut butter cookie, the "fudge" basically tasted like the store bought frosting you buy in a container.  The smell was too sweet. I tried to eat one of the finished cookies so I could rate it fairly and I couldn't finish it. If my coworkers like them, I'll make them again, but otherwise this definitely is not going into my recipe box.

These were a hit with my family! :)  My husband loves peanut butter with chocolate, so I knew he would like these.  My son is a picky eater, so I wasn't sure whether or not he would like them, but he did.  Awesome dessert!

These are very good, and really cute too! I did get 48 "cups" but I did have a lot of fudge filling leftover. I used my pestle to make the wells, which were very deep, so I was surprised I had that much filling left. I let these cool in the pan 10 minutes and I used the tip of a butter knife to help loosen them and gave them a slight twist. Every single one came out of the pan so easy. I used a small spoon to fill these, but next time I will try a pastry bag because you really have to work quick with the fudge, it dries and hardens fast! I highly recommend waiting to make the filling until all the cups are ready to go. I can't imagine making it any earlier. Overall, these were well received but they are very sweet and rich. Also, if you plan to use sprinkles on these, fill about 3 or 4 cups, then top with sprinkles so you don't have any problems with them adhereing. Otherwise they will just roll off the top. I will make these again upon requests, which I'm sure I'll have. Thanks for sharing :)

Holy shnikies! I totally understand why this recipe has 5 stars.  I left off the pecans but my husband said it probably would have be awesome with them.  I normally hate semi-sweet chocolate but I make it a rule never to make major changes to a recipe before I try it word-for-word. Trust me, use both chocolates. Also I double the cookie part of the recipe and single the chocolate part, and it’s almost perfectly portioned. To make the little canyons in my cookies I use a clean medicine cup that comes with my kids Tylenol (I swear it’s the perfect size). I have a small cookie scoop to help portion the chocolate and it  scoops one TBSP and I fill mine to a level load. I live at 6000 feet elevation and I didn't need to add any extra flour at all. THANK YOU!

this is a double 5 stars recipe!   It was one of the easiest recipes to make.  One thing to share-I made like a crust in the mini muffin pan before cooking and that made an indent when it came out. When hot, just re-did indent--super easy!! putting in fridge before trying to get them out was an answer to many tries of being frustrated!  now the fridge IS a great idea. Ya gotta try it!

Fun, pretty and yummy.  I thought that this recipe was going to be a lot of work, but it went very quickly and easily.  The dough was easy to work with and baked in 14 minutes.  I had the fudge ready to pipe in (which makes it so easy) and after cooling for 5 minutes, I filled them, sprinkled them, and the kids attacked them.  I barely had time to snap a picture of them finished.  They turned out perfect looking and they taste great, too.  I made 24 in my mini-muffin pan, and made the remaining dough into regular peanut butter cookies.  My husband said they were the best he has had (and he has had A LOT), so this will be my new peanut butter cookie recipe as well - THANKS!

These are really good- the dough is just a little sticky to work with, and the chocolate has a hard time melting smooth, but they are so cute and yummy that it's worth it.

I made 22 cups in a regular-sized muffin tin. I used a nonstick pan and spritzed each up with Pam before filling and had absolutely no issues at all with sticking. I used a shot glass to press down the centers. I used my regular cookie scoop to measure out the amounts and had exactly 22 cups and used all of the fudge perfectly. This recipe is dangerously addictive delicious!

These were great! I followed the recipe as written and they turned out excellent. I filled a piping bag with the fudge mixture to fill the cups. I brought these along to a get together for something different than cookies or bars and everyone enjoyed them - only mistake was not making a double batch.

Awesome! These are sooo tasty and they really are quite adorable. It's super easy to fill the wells with the chocolate if you use a squeeze bottle. That way you can keep heating the chocolate up if it gets too cool to squeeze out easily. I'll make these again. I topped half with the pecans, the other half with sprinkles. Thanks! :)

Great, simple recipe!  Brought these to work and everyone loved them.  I followed the previous reviewers advice and "twisted" the cookies out of the pan without any problems (also greased pan).  I only have one mini-muffin pan and had to keep the fudge mixture warm on the oven while the second batch cooked.  This was a little tricky and it seemed like the fudge on the second batch dried hard instead of staying soft.  Next time I will wait until all of the cookies are done before I start the fudge.  Overall, great recipe...I followed it exactly.  Had to use hershey kisses for the milk chocolate b/c I didn't have any milk chocolate chips on hand but it worked great.

I patted the balls down a little once in the cups, I was afraid they'd bake up different heights. They baked beautifully. I love the filling, I'd like to use it for other applications. To fill, I used a pastry bag and round tip, just piped in a spiraling motion. The presentation is wonderful for these, they look SO pretty, and it's really easy to make them festive and/or customized with different toppings. However, when it's all said and done, I'm not sure they are THAT much better than the classic peanut butter cookies with a Hershey's kiss on top (which require a whole lot less effort and ingredients). I would only make these again for the beautiful presentation.  I wish I could give them 3 1/2 stars.

These are tasty cookies and my son's absolute favorite, however as is they're not my ideal... The filling as made comes out like fudge, a bit thick and with a fudgy consistency. This may be great for a lot of folks. I'll also readily admit I have a bit of a stigma against condensed milk in recipes, and I rarely have it on hand...  So, the last time I made these, finding myself with no condensed milk, I just filled them with a simple ganache instead. A cup of semisweet chocolate chips, a quarter cup of heavy cream and a few tablespoons of butter. Melt the butter and heat the cream in a pot, stir in chips after removing from heat. Hot off the stove it's fairly thin and will pour into the cups easily. Once cooled it firms up to a buttery consistency. I find the soft smooth ganache filling to be much tastier.

These are excellent! I hardly ever make a recipe without thinking that something about it could be altered: cooking time, more sugar, etc. But other than the fact that I only needed half the filling, this recipe is perfect!     I baked mine for 16 minutes, they were perfect! I also used the pestal from my mortar and pestal to make the indentations like another reviewer suggested. Great idea! Made the perfect little well in the center!   These are just the most delicious little peanut butter cookies with wonderful fudgeyness inside!      Update: Made them and used 1 1/2 the amount of sweetened condensed milk called for to make the center stay a little softer. Wow! I didn't think they could get any better, but somehow they did! They seem like the are fresh out of the oven even the next day! Yum!

These tasted good, but the fudge didn't go inside the cookies well, and for all the work I did, I'd much rather make easier peanut butter blossoms. Very time consuming.

Big and Small kids loved these.   I thought they were awesome too.  I made the wells and then i cooked my chocolate after all the cookies were done...this helped me fill all them up at one time. I filled some chocolate into a measuring cup and then spooned the chocolate in then went back as I ran low.  No drips, pretty and omg yummie

I've made these multiple times now and they have come out perfectly each time!  I am a HUGE chocolate lover and was sure that I would not have trouble using all of the chocolate, but I, too, found myself needing more of the cookie part so I definitely suggest either doubling the cookie part of halving the chocolate part.   Also, I suggest waiting at least a few hours (if not over night) before serving them.  The fudgey center hardens slightly with time and they become even more delicious!!

Oh, my, these are the best cookies ever!!!  No adjustments necessary but so many variations can be made.  Different chips, different nuts, but the base cookie is dynamite.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I thought these were pretty good. Very important to undercook slightly or they will get too crispy.  The cookie part was good, not great. The fudge part was very good. My kids devoured the fudge, but wouldn't eat the cookie at all. They went over pretty well at the cookie swap. I will definitely make again, although I may adjust the cookie base a little to make it more flavorful.

Yummy & rich. I made exactly as written however, I don't have a mini muffin pan so I used a regular sized one. I think they would have been better in a mini pan. They turned out just fine and the taste is great but because of their size, they were very rich. I will make them again as one of my many Christmas treats, but I'll invest in a mini muffin pan for my next batch. **Side notes...I did have alot of chocolate left over so I think I'll double the cookie part next time--let them cool for about 5 mins before forming the well & removing from the pan or they do fall apart easily--making the choc mixture in the microwave & using a zip-loc baggie to pipe the chocolate worked great.

UPDATED: 12/11

A few hints for easier baking:

*There is enough chocolate for two batches of cookies so don't waste the chocolate - make more cookies!

*I don't have a double boiler, but I have a great solution for anyone else who doesn't.  Put the chocolate chips in a saucepan & place on top of the stove WHILE you're preparing/baking the cookies.  As they bake, the heat radiating from the oven will soften the chocolate gently.  If you wait to mix the chocolate mixture until after the last batch of cookies has cooked, it will be easy to mix the now-warm chocolate chips with the sweetened condensed milk & vanilla.

*To make an easy piping bag for the chocolate, open a sandwich bag inside a large coffee mug, pulling the edges of the bag over the top of the mug.  Fill the mug with chocolate, remove the bag when finished, cut off one corner of the bag and you're ready to go!

*The chocolate develops a firm surface quickly, so if you want to cover with sprinkles, pour them on quickly after dispensing the chocolate. 

Original Review: I grew up with the traditional peanut butter blossom cookies Mom made every Christmas.  One of the minor problems with the blossom cookie is that there isn't enough chocolate in every bite.  This recipe cures that!  Wow!  The chocolate isn't over powering and complements the 'not so sweet' peanut butter cookie perfectly!  I will never make blossom cookies ever again!  These are FAR better!

These are one of the best cookies I've ever made!  They are adorable when finished too and you can top with any decoration you like! I topped each with a candy corn for a halloween bake sale and they turned out so cute!  I left out the pecans also.

WOW !! Can't stop eating them !  The filling is addictive.  Didn't have mini muffin tins so did cookies out of 1 inch balls and cooked them for 7 minutes.  Perfect.  Just a little filling left... but not for long !! Thanks

These were so good! Made the cookie part and the fudge part exactly as written. For the topping, I added the pecans to some, added toffee bits to others (thanks to the reviewer who suggested it) and left the rest plain. The toffee bits were the best ones. It's true you will likely have a bit of the fudge left over. I suggest getting a spoon eating it up like I did - its very yummy and that way nothing goes to waste :)

Okay, debzy - That's enough of *that* kind of stuff! LOL! WOW, are those good! They had a wonderfully light peanut butter flavor that was not overpowered by the fudge, they were fun to make and not so difficult that a ham-handed baking mechanic (as vs Baking Chef!) like me can make them. I used your recipe as written, making minor adjustments for my 8,000 foot altitude. I also lined the mini-pan with liners and used a #50 (4 teaspoon) scoop instead of rolling the somewhat sticky dough into balls by hand. I grant you that the scoop, which measures about 1-1/4 inches in diameter nets a ball that is slightly under 1" in diameter; still a few of them mushroomed slightly on top during baking. I'll try a #60 (1 Tablespoon) scoop next time. I ended up with 32 cookies when done, and anticipate about 48 with the slightly smaller scoop. The more, the marrier!  I also used the Ziplock piping bag trick to fill them with the fudge, and that worked out very well. And, ummmm....don't worry about the 1/2 cup or so of excess fudge. I'll just make a batch of cinnamon ice cream to top with that!

This excellent cookie is perfect for cookie exchanges.  Just be sure not to make the crusts too thin, or they will leak or fall apart.  

I found this recipe on the internet as published in the Dec. 1998 County Woman magazine, so would like to give credit.  This recipe calls for chilling the dough for 1 hour before shaping into balls and placing in mini-muffin tins.

Very good!  Easy and impressive looking!  I just melted the chips and the milk in the microwave for about 1 minute on high then stirred in the vanilla.  Also, for me, there was exactly the right amount of fudge filling for 48 cookies.  In fact, I almost ran out.  I was scraping the bowl to get enough.  I must have made my wells deeper then others did.  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely amazing! These were so easy to make and the most delicious cookies I've ever had. I used a regular muffin tin, and since I didn't have a melon baller I just used a tablespoon to make the indentations. It made 24 regular sized cookies, and I had some extra filling left over (about enough to make 6 more). I just used the extra chocolate to make smores for the kids.

I really did like the recipe since it was something a little different than what I usually bake. I did not have an extra amount of the filling left over as some others suggested, perhaps I made the well a little deeper. I did as one other suggested and lightly greased the tin. They came out so easily. It was a good balance of the chocolate and the peanut butter cookie. I will make these again.

These cookies are excellent!!!  I too had some chocolate left over. I had doubled the whole recipe, but could have made the single recipe for the filling. Maybe next time I will make the wells a little deeper. However they taste great with the amount of chocolate I have in them now.  I am thinking I will not have any left come Christmas day because my daughters have already scarfed a bunch down before they have even cooled!  I will have to find a hiding spot or Santa won’t have any cookies to eat on Christmas eve!   I ended up putting the chocolate in a large plastic baggie and piping the chocolate into the cookies. The chocolate had cooled a little and was not pouring out of the measuring cup very well. Thank you for a great recipe!! I will certainly be making these again, and again, and again and again!!

Yummy! I didn't have enough mini muffin tins so i made some in normal sized ones. They all turned out great! I made the fudge in the microwave because I didn't want to wash out a double broiler. The fudge turned out just fine and they were sweet enough even when I only used semi sweet chocolate chips! I'll definitely be making these again.

These are light and good, not overly sweet. I took them to a church event and they vanished. My husband raves about them. Also, my 10 year old helped make these. A good project for a beginning baker.

update:  this will be my 4th yr making these for the Christmas trays.  No matter what, people always oooh and ahhh over these. I love that it makes so many.  I always double the dough because the 'puddle' part of the recipe makes enough for a double batch of dough.  these are so good and present so nicely.  To the reviewer that suggested using the end of the mortal and pestal to make the indentation, thanks so much; this worked fantastic!  Didn't have a bit of trouble getting them out. let them set for just a few minutes then using a small butter knife, they popped right out.  I did have to double the dough so thanks to all that suggested this, as there would have been leftover 'puddle' but if you have leftover, just warm it and use over icecream as hot fudge.  thanks again for this nice recipe.

Amazing!!!!! I used chunky peanut butter. I also used mini muffin liners which made life so much easier. I used the double boiler fir melting and mixing the chocolates and sweetened condensed milk. If you make the wells deep enough in each one, you'll have almost exactly enough cookie/fudge ratio.

I just made these with my 8 year old twin grandchildren (boy and girl) It was quite easy even though it looks complicated.  The taste was great and all who have tried them have raved about them.  I think I will try some other variations.  The one suggestion I have is to use mini cupcake liners, makes it easier to remove from pan and nice for serving.  Miki

I thought they were pretty good but everyone else thought they were great. It's a little bit of work but if you nkow someone who really likes peanut butter and chocolate, it will go over well.

Before I made the cookies I read the review on the chocolate center tasting a little fake and overly sweet, but I had the ingredients and made them directly as the instructions said. And...the chocolate center was bland. The cookie is definitely yummy, but next time I'll experiment with a different chocolate center.

This cookies was simple to make and looked lovely when finished.  I sprayed the mini muffin pans with a little Pam before filling.  I used all semi-sweet chocolate for the filling because I didn't have milk chocolate.  I put the filling in a large ziploc bag with a star piping tip and piped it into the shells.  It looked very nice, especially when topped with a pecan half.  Would definitely make again.  May even try white chocolate with a little peppermint and use all butter instead of peanut butter in the cookie.

They're good.. But they don't have the flavor with a wow factor.  After following this recipe I concluded that these are just peanut butter cookies with fudge. I think these can be spiced up  a bit alternating cookie crust flavors like gingersnap or chocolate or sugar cookie and using perhaps dark chocolate laced with raspberry or mint extract or white chocolate with lemon zest or caramel with peanuts or rubella with hazelnuts for a different twist to the fudge. When I made  original recipe I put crushed butterfinger pieces into the crusts before topping with fudge so that's another thing  to make them more exciting. These cookies are  aesthetically pleasing. I will definitely be making them often =)

Fantastic!  I heavily greased the pan with non-stick spray and had no issue getting the cookies out.  Also, I used a pastry bag to get the choco into the cups.  I don't think a measuring cup could have possibly worked - would have been a mess - but with the pastry bag, it was a snap!  Like everyone else, I had a bit extra choco, but not too much.

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out great! I didn't have a melonballer, so I just used my teaspoon and it worked fine. I used natural sweetened peanut butter and I could definitely taste the peanut butter. I think I may try making these again but without peanut butter and maybe adding some mini chocolate chips to the batter. I love peanut butter, but unfortunately, my boyfriend doesn't!

These are a great idea!  I've made them twice.  One time I topped them with pieces of peanuts I carmelized in melted sugar, and the next time I pressed three peanut butter m&m's on the tops of each.  They were really delicous both times.

We took Krista's advise and made some using cocoa, so we could have a variety and they all came out great. We used buttercream to decorate tops instead of choc filling to make halloween designs, next time we will make them with the choc filling.  My kids loved them.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty... used end of my meat injector syringe to make well in cookie.  Was the perfect size.  I kept the chocolate in the double broiler as I filled and decorated each immediately with Reese's Pieces and fall colored sprinkles.  Taking them to a party tomorrow night, however, I couldn't go to bed without trying at least one!  Will definately make again!

Yummy!  These are awesome and even better the second day!  I didn't have semi-sweet chips so I just used milk chocolate chips and it turned out fine.  I microwaved the chocolate and then added the milk and the vanilla at the same time and didn't have any trouble with clumping.  My dough was very sticky even after putting in the fridge for a good while so I didn't get to roll into balls but they still turned out fine.  I will have to try the two kinds of chocolate, but I will be making these a lot!

These were fun to make and a hit with our company. I know from experience that as fudge cools it can be difficult to work with so I used a piping bag to fill the cookies with the fudge. That worked well.

Great cookie, I made these for a wedding and they really went over well, I used mini cupcake papers to line the mini muffin pan, they looked nice and they made getting them out simple.   the fudge does set up quick so be sure to have them all out before you make it.  I also rolled the tops in chopped walnuts rather than the pecans only because I had them sitting around but it worked out really well and they looked nice.    I doubled the recipe but only made a single batch of the fudge and it was almost enough, I had about 5 left when the fudge ran out so a broke and Andes mint in half and put it in the cup and just put in the oven long enough to melt the chocolate, turned out nice too..  I will make this again they turned out great.

These were great.  The only thing different I did was to melt the chocolate chips in the microwave....worked great.  Put the chips in for about 1 min, then stir and add the milk.  Nuke for about 1 more minute or until melted....then add the vanilla and stir.  I just filled mine with a spoon and that worked good.  If the choc got hard I heated for abt 30 seconds in the micro wave to  melt it again.  These also freeze really well, and taste great frozen!

I made these today and they are delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but put sprinkles instead of pecans.  The peanut butter isn't overpowerful and has a good balance between the chocolate and peanut butter.  I had just enough chocolate to fill the cups and i used a half-tablespoon measure to make the dents.  I will definitely make this again and won't change the recipe one bit!

These are tasty, but nothing over the top special.  Could use more peanut butter in my opinion, perhaps some mixed into the chocolate filling.

I made these for my co-workers.  They were gone before lunch.  I also used a regular muffin tin and shot glass to make the wells.  I did not wait until the end to fill all of the wells, and I had issues with the chocolate.  I will absolutely make them again.

These were delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except used a very 'heaping' 1/2 cup of pb because I love pb! Baked 15 minutes and the result was a soft, chewy, peanutbuttery cookie filled with fudge goodness! cooled shells for 10 minutes before removing from pan with a very sharp knife and had no problems! Definitely will make again!

so easy to make..i did use the normal size muffin pan and used an ice cream scoop to make the cookie balls..at other reviews wait till the last 5 minutes of cooking to do filling as it does need to be stired alot so it doesn't stiffen up.

These are the prettiest little dessert cups.  They will impress anyone.  Looks are one thing, but these deliver on taste as well.  Very good, very sweet, everything combined, I will continue to make these on a regular basis.  Thank you for a nice recipe.

Excellent as written!  I think I rolled my first batch a little too big--ended up with 40 cups and a few tablespoons of the fudge left over. Didn't make the fudge until the first batch was out of the oven and the timing worked out well. Had to definitely keep on top of stirring it while the second batch baked. Great recipe... Will definitely make these again!

If you make the wells big enough, the amount of filling works well.  These are a huge hit with all ages.  I've been asked for the recipe many times.

Yummy! I followed the advice of another reviewer and added an extra 1/2 can of condensed milk to the fudge center. The consistency was perfect. I also melted some peanut butter chips and drizzled the tops- I'm a huge peanut butter fan and thought they needed a little more!

OMG!! These are wonderful!!!  They have become one of my "go to" recipes.  I didn't have milk chocolate chips so I used 2 cups semi sweet.  I also used a cake decorating tip and bag to pipe the chocolate.  I was also able to use the sweetened condensed milk recipe I found on this site!

These turned out so pretty!!! I used a ball about an inch in diameter and it was perfect. Followed the baking instuctions to a tee and it was perfect. I used a ziplock bag to pipe my fudge. I made a double batch of the dough and needed about  1.5 batches of the fudge. Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe! These are a bit like the Peanut Blossom cookies...but the fudge center in these really pushes the taste over the top! Followed the recipe until I got to the left over chocolate filling. Then I pulled out the tub of Toll House Peanut Butter cookie dough from the fridge to make a few more cookies and used up the rest of the filling. Not sure there is a big difference between the homemade and the ready-made...it's the fudge filling that keeps the cookie moist and gives you the flavor explosion in your mouth. This might be a quicker way to make them if you are in a rush. Absolutely wonderful, though. My favorite Holiday cookie this year!

An overall good flavor. Myhusband loved these.  As far as the left over chocolate, I have a suggestion. I spread it in a pan and put in the fridge. Once hardened I took a spoon to scrape off pieces. I rolled them up and then in toppings to make about 15 truffles. It is a nice accent to the dessert tray I was making. I did only get three dozen cups out of the recipe. Could have made even a little smaller, but wouldn't have filled the muffin cup when done baking. I am rating a four because the directions we not really detailed. I did get hint for revies(spray pan,wait to make chocolate until cooled for 10 min).

This is a great recipe.  Made them today as part of my Xmas baking.  Definitely agree with others with regards to doubling the "cookie" batch.  I didn't but, saved the left over chocolate filling (in fridge) and will make more.  As for baking time, I'm in agreement with others that 14-16 minutes is way too long.  I baked mine for 10 minutes and they were perfect.  The only issue I have with the recipe (being Canadian and all) is the can of condensed milk.  I had to open two of our "Canadian" cans to make 14oz (1 3/4cups).  On a positive note, the extra milk did not go to wate as I mixed coconut in with the extra milk and made macaroons!!

LOVE these.  I did make 1.5 the amount of dough and it was just the right amount for the fudge filling.  I ended up with 56 cookies all together.  The only bad thing about these cookies is I can't stop eating them.  :)

So good...so easy!!  Like a lot of others suggested, I doubled the cookie recipe, which worked perfectly.  I also waited until all of cookies were done to pour in the fudge. (which was not as easy as I expected, but worth it in the end!!)  Everyone that I had sample these has LOVED them.  Thanks for such a great cookie recipe.

These were very good, and although some of the reviews made me a little apprehensive, I found these to be very easy to make.  Even though they seemed a little small, I rolled the dough into 1" balls and when they baked they were the perfect size for the mini-muffn cups - no overflowing.  In fact, there were already little wells formed in the dough, but I did use my steel measuring spoon (teaspoon-sized) to further form the wells - it was the perfect shape and size!  I actually baked them at 350 degrees for 12 minutes and they were perfectly done.  Before trying to remove from the pans, I gave each cookie a little spin to loosen it, and they came out easily.  I used all semi-sweet chocolate chips for the filling, using a plastic zipper-type bag with one corner snipped off to fill the cookies.  I did have a fair amount of filling left over, though.  Finally, I wanted to decorate them with various holiday sprinkles, but I found the filling isn't sticky enough to make the sprinkles adhere, so I gently dipped the tops of the cookies into bowls of sprinkles and that worked perfectly!  The cookies have great flavor and are very attractive - we love 'em! Thanks for sharing, debzy!  This will be a regular for us!

These are fantastic!!  I didn't realize that I had bought evaporated milk instead of sweet condensed milk, so I substituted one cup of the evaporated milk and 1 1/4 cups of sugar.  Simmer until sugar is dissolved and let cool.   Delicious!

These were so good and easy!  The only thing that wasn't that much fun was putting the fudge in the middle (it was pretty messy...)  Mine are not as cute as the pictures, but they're still cute.  I used little tiny cupcake holders and they of course popped right out.  I read the reviews to use some sort of squirt bottle for the chocolate, but I couldn't find anything aroung my house to work.  I'll definitely find something next time I make these...and there will be a next time!  Thanks for sharing!

These turned out very, very well.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not experience any problems with the peanut butter cups being too crumbly or hard.  Mine came right out of the pan (non-stick mini-muffin pan sprayed with Pam) with no problems at all.  The only problem I had was with getting the filling into the cups.  I tried to use squeeze bottles, but my filling set up too much and it was kind of frustrating.  Next time, I will work faster and use the baggie method so I don't have to fool around so long trying to get the filling into the bottles.  These cookies are delicious -- the perfect amount of rich fudge with a just-sweet-enough soft peanut butter cookie.

I have made these several times and they are delicious every time!  Perfect for the Christmas party with red/green sprinkles on top.  Everyone raved about them from kids to the adults.  I made mine in dark non stick mini muffin pans and let them cool slightly in the pan.  Never had a problem with sticking at all.  Thanks!  I will use this over and over again.

My husband really likes these cookies! Easy to make, used the microwave for the chocolate but should have maybe did the broiler.  If you let the chocolate set, it gets a little stickier.  Also using the zippy bag as someone suggested was a disaster for me but great cookies!

These are very good! The trick I found to getting the chocolate in easily is to pour it into a condiment bottle  and then squirt it into the cookies. It made it go quickly and neatly! I also tried these with chocolate chip cookie dough and they were yummy too.

Great recipe.  Easy to make and tastes great.  Bake all of your cookie shells first and then make the fudge center since it will start to harden up.  I used a pastry bag with a large tip to make them a little more "dressy".  Thanks for the great recipe.  It will make an excellent addition to my Christmas cookie trays!

Devine!! My son went nuts over them!  They are a bit time consuming, but worth the effort.  I ended up with way to much chocolate filling. Next time I will make half as much of the chocolate.  I topped with peanut butter chips. Very sinfull!!

Yummy!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had a little bit of chocolate leftover but we just put it on graham crackers.  I tried putting the fudge in a squeeze bottle but found it was too thick.  I ended up up using a mini ladle and a mini rubber scraper.  We will make these again, for sure!

These are fantastic!!  You should make them.  I used a small scoop to fill the mini muffin pan instead of making balls and when I pressed the centers I rotated left and right while they were warm to prevent sticking.  I have a Pampered Chef set and it worked great.  I baked exactly 14 minutes, cooled for 5 minutes before pressing the centers and then cooled another 15-20 minutes before starting the filling.  I will include these in my Christmas gift goodie baskets and make them when I need a special dessert.  They look and taste like you spends hours and hours in the kitchen.  Very yummy!!!!

these cookies are great! i already made them twice in the last three weeks! for my boyfriends birthday and for his mothers.  the thing i did differently the second time around was double the cookie recipe.  there is just too much delicious fudge to waste! the pecans in the fudge was good, but seems optional. i did put them in the first time i made them but the second time i found walnuts to put in instead! great cookies!!!!

Wonderful! Delicious! Adorable! One word of warning though- the recipe says to make the wells immediately out of the oven, but if you do that, they will crumble because they are too hot. Cooling for 10-15 minutes before welling works very well. Well, get it? Haha.

WOW!  Fudgey!  These taste like the cookies that you put the chocolate star in the middle of.  I thought it was a little to much chocolate, but my husband liked.  To remedy this, next time i won't make as big of a indent to pour the chocolate into.  These will be very nice to put on candy trays and Christmas; it looks like you fussed over them, but actually this recipe is very easy to do.  Recommended!

Yummy!  So far everyone has loved them!  I did add 1 tbsp. of Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa to the fudge for an extra kick of chocolate.  Also, the fudge does set up so it isn't all gooey.  I was wondering if transporting the cookies would be a mess, but it wasn't.  Thanks for the great recipe!

A friend gave me a similar recipe years ago and I had lost it.  If you blink, they are all gone.  Be sure to hide one for yourself or you won't get any.  Ages 3 to 80 love them.

These taste great. I was a little disppointed because they were very crumbly and when I used the melon baller to scoop alot of them just fell apart.  It did not make 48 only 38 which is no big deal but I did have some of the chocolate filling left over.  Not much but had some left.  I think next time I will bake them a minute or two less, maybe they won't be so crumbly.  I'm not sure if it would be better to make them normal size muffins and make less or to stick with the mini ones.

These are great! I used cupcake/muffin pans and they came out to be a great size. I doubled the cookie part and still had fudge leftover at the end, so doubling that is a must. Instead of pecans, I garnished with toffee bits. These were a huge hit.

These were fantastic! I had the same problem as most of you (some filling leftover). And the dough didn't make 48 like it said, BUT, even with these minor problems, I would still make them again. I am fine with the amount of dough I had, and the filling is so wonderful that I was glad to have some leftover (I had about a cup). So now I can use the filling for something else and make anything FANTASTIC!

These were yummy, but super rich.  I think next time I will try milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  That's just my personal taste though.  The cookie part was super delicious.

I chose NOT to double the cookie portion of the recipe (as others had suggested) and it turned out just fine. There wasn't that much fudge left over to matter. I added a tiny bit extra peanut butter to the recipe, to make the peanut flavor stand out a bit more.   **TIP: Finish baking/cooling all the cookies before you melt the chocolate filling. That way, you fill them all at once. I had to put the fudge into a plastic bag & cut the tip off in order to NICELY fill the cookies, however. Otherwise, VERY messy! lol  I also topped mine with chopped peanuts (makes more sense to me to use those and not a pecan). Great cookie, family loved them! Thanks!

These cookies are pretty awsome. Just a note though, if you make your cookies too big, you end up putting alot of chocolate in them and it can be a bit overwhelming.

wow!  These are great. A nice soft and chewy cookie.  I like them better than the cookie you have to use Kisses in.  Easy to make.  My co-workers didn't believe they were homemade, they thought I bought them at the bakery. This cookie is going on my Christmas cookie tray.  I didn't roll the dough into balls.  I just used my small cookie scoop to drop the dough into the pans, it made things alot easier.

These were great!  I didn't have milk chocolate chips, so I used a half of a cup of peanut butter chips (That's all i had,so used less condensed milk to balance) and a cup of semi-sweet. YUMMM! I thought it went well with the PB flavored cookie.

Like everyone else says...delicious! I used a 1" cookie scoop (because I don't like rolling all those little balls) and ended up with 40 cookies. I did have a little fudge left over, so I spread it between graham crackers to make cheap cookies for the kids.

Wow! Great addition to my recipe box. I had just enough of the fudge...made the indentations pretty deep with the cylindrical end of a whisk (maybe an inch in diameter?)I used 2 3/4 c semisweet and 1/4c white chocolate chips for a more intense chocolate flavor. I've been thinking about variations on the theme.... maybe a sugar cookie dough with the fudge.... maybe a chocolate cookie with all white chocolate chips or carmel chips. Thanks for the idea!

These look and taste great! They were easy to make too. I didn't double the dough recipe so I had a lot of the chocolate filling left over. However, I am going to use it as a topping for cocoa squares. Also, I did not put the pecans on top because my children are not fond of nuts in baking and they still tasted great. They are a nice change from the usual lunch bag cookies.

doubled the dough and still had left over fudge... I got around 80 cookies.  Also I did not use the melon baller I thought that the cookie sank in enough to just put the fudge on top.  I just microwaved the chips and the milk, 30 seconds at a time and stirred, lot easier than stove top.

These are THE BEST. I did follow blueeyez suggestion and doubled the dough. I do want to add that instead of the fudge filling, which I ran out of on the first batch, fill with grape jelly instead. Very good!!

these were great, I loved making them, although at some points in the process it felt like I was stiring cement.  They turned out great the only thing I had a problem with was the fudge, it turned out more like a fondent and didn't really pour so I just spooned it in!

Came out great, won a cookie contest at work with these and it was the first time I made them. 
A definite keeper.

I agree with another baker , to double the dough recipe. I had a lot of filling left, so I made fudge with it . It’s a great recipe and plan to make more .

These taste delicious but I gave it only 3 stars because the fudge part started to set up as soon as I added the condensed milk & so it is piled high vs the smooth look in the photo. (I've since read another reviewer who suggested using a glass measuring cup to make & distribute the fudge.) Also, in the instructions the fudge part is made prior to baking the 'cups'. This was confusing as the fudge would have been very set by time I finished baking the cups. I baked them all, then made the fudge. I had quite a bit of fudge left over, so maybe should have made the indents larger? Also, I used almond butter so I can take them to work where someone  has a severe peanut allergy. Like I said, they were delicious.

I made this exactly as written.   So good, especially if you have a sweet tooth like I do!  It yield 42 cookies using the mini muffin tins.   I did have some chocolate filling left- about enough to fill around six or so more.  I took some reviewers advise and lightly sprayed the tins.  I also used a cookie scoop which made it a breeze for fast and easy filling of the tins.  I used a large glass measuring cup for the  chocolate filling and put in microwave at 50% power which took about 4 minutes.  Then I used the cookie scope to fill. 
I let the cookies cool for around 10 -15 min. before taking out of tins.  Just inserted a butter knife and they popped right out. Peanut butter and chocolate is  winning combination.  Great recipe!

Our fudge puddles were really scrumptious. The peanut butter was a perfect choice to add with the chocolate. It was pretty simple to make. We loved it.

I’m not necessarily a peanut butter person but my family loved these.  I think I’m going to try this recipe without peanut butter next time and make it more of a sugar cookie and see how that comes out.  Very easy to make.

Yum! These were super easy to make and they taste fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using a regular size muffin pan rather than a mini muffin pan. I used a dosing cup from some children's Tylenol to form the wells in the cups so they were nice and deep. I still had just a little bit of left over fudge but that just means that I have bonus fudge to eat now!

I make these every year for Christmas.  I have had times where I didn't have the exact items needed for the filling so subbed peanut butter chips with chocolate chips, butterscotch chips with or w/o chocolate chips, etc. and all combinations have worked great!  Love these!

So easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. Using the melon baller to make the dent as well as to fill them. I melted the chocolate over a low heat on the stove top and that allowed me to keep it warm while filling the cups. The melon baller held the perfect amount of filling. Will definitely make again.

Made these cookies (sort of) for XMas cookie tray.  Actually I just used a bagged cookie mix (gasp) in the interest of time BUT I used the ganache recipe (semisweet chocolate only) to fill the cookie cups.  They were superb and I can't imagine them being any better with the full 'from scratch' recipe. I used a ccokie scoop to make the wells in the middle, a couple of decorative sprinkles on top and VIOLA instant batch of awesome cookies!

To prepare the chocolate filing, use a glass measuring cup and melt the ingredients in the microwave. Using the measuring cup, allows you to "reheat" the chocolate as necessary for an easy "pour".

These are good, all though quite sweet and a little finicky to make.  Whatever you do, follow these 2 instructions...
1. Make sure you divide the peanut butter dough into all 48 (divide into four equal sections and then fill 12 mini muffin tins with each).  I tried to make 1" balls and only made 39 cookies, many rose too large around the edges.
2. Listen to the 4 min cooling time then pop them out of the tins.  I tried some with paper liners, some without and minus a couple that stuck on the bottom, the rest popped out fine.

I too, made the chocolate filling in a glass bowl in the microwave and reheated as needed.  If I was doing it again, I would probably make the peanut butter cookies that you stick a chocolate kiss on top, same idea and easier.

I was very frustrated because the recipe did NOT say to grease the muffin cups and I was totally unable to get the bottoms out  in one peice and I scraped my brand new muffin tin getting them out.  They might taste good but they sure don't look appetizing.

Yummy tasting! A little bit fussy but worth the effort.  I had a little trouble with my fudge filling. It seemed to be too hard to get into the cups. I'll definitely try again though. I had lots of fudge filling left over so I can see the benefit of doubling the cookie part of the recipe.

Very easy to make but I did make a few changes like one reviewer said. Used half milk chocolate and half semi sweet chocolate. To make the indentation in the cookie  used the back of a Tb measuring spoon. To set the chocolate faster put in the refrigerator  and then froze them.Tastes even better frozen.  Thanks for the recipe

I really liked this dish. I made it for my family Christmas party and they were a big hit. I didn't put on the pecan half because my family has a lot of people suffering from a nut allergy so I just replaced them with a chunk of a chocolate bar. It tasted just as good (I think because I am one of the people in my family with a nut allergy). Also, I didn't include the peanut butter and just replaced it with sun butter (sunflower seeds).

These were delicious. Generously sprayed pan with Pam and had no problem getting them out after suggested cooling time.

These came out really good. They didn't look anything like the picture, but were really tasty. I felt like I should have waited to make the chocolate until the cookies were cool...then it would have been more pourable. Still really good!

I made these exactly to the recipe and they are awesome.  I used a half teaspoon to measure out the dough, and it's the perfect amount.  I also used a one quarter of a teaspoon to make the wells.  I put the chocolate mix in a cake icer bag, just squeezed out the needed amount.  Only real problem I had was too much fudge left over.  I only used about 2/3rds of the fudge.

These cookies look great & are easy to make, but I thought it was a lot of work for the taste.  It was a bit difficult removing them from the tin, if I did them again I would probably spray Pam for easier removal.

Out of Sweetened Condensed Milk?  You can substitute condensed milk that you have boiled with 1 1/2 cups of white sugar.  Then let cool, and mix with the melted chocolate.  Because this recipe has chocolate that hardens, its okay to substitute this runnier substitute.

My cookies came out crumbly. As soon as you touch them they fall apart. This has made me grumpy because my cookie exchange is tonight. I'm going to take them anyway. I know they will taste good. The pecan on top adds class!  Don't omit it.

Easiest of all ... buy a roll of Peanut butter cookies, use the same procedure with a mini-muffin pan, fill the shell with a mini peanut butter cup sans paper.  I have not tried this procedure, found it on my local Patch just this morning and could not resist sharing  ... might do in a hurry pinch, no?

These turned out great! My husband took them to work and everyone wanted the recipe.  We tried it two different ways-one with a pecan on top and one with chopped pecans added to the batter.  Both were good.

Liked it more than I anticipated! I used 1/2 c peanut butter chips barely melted in the micro since I didn't have peanut butter. Worked out great! Also used regular muffin pans. Will make again!

These are amazing!! I used a spoon to fill the cookie cups which made it very easy with little mess. I did have fudge left over so maybe next time I will make more dough for more cookies.  I made these for the National Championship so I decorated them with red sprinkles and drew the Alabama "A" with red icing...so cute!  Took them to my husbands work and they got rave reviews!!  I will absolutely be making these again.

Yum, took these to a cookie exchange and everyone liked them. I used mini tins with paper liners, got exactly 48 balls. Made wells immediately out of oven, hard at first with a few cracks but got the hang of it after a few. I only made 1/2 batch of chocolate filling and it was the perfect amount for me. Heated chocolate ingredients in a Pyrex measuring cup in microwave 20 seconds, stir, repeat until melted, then poured into a bag with #3 tip to fill. Christmas sprinkles on top instead of nuts. Son followed behind me with the sprinkles because they set-up quickly. Look and taste wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious! Made these and took them to a family function. They were a huge hit! Everyone was saying that they taste just like a Reeses! I struggled with them being a little bit soft, but made them bigger than called for, so I'm sure that was my issue. I will make the proper adjustments next time and will be trying these again soon for a holiday party!!

I made these the other day and they were a HUGE hit!  I think I actually liked them more after a couple days because my cookie got softer and chewer.  I used a zippy bag to put the chocolate into the center and it worked perfect (just don't cut the hole too big).  Thanks for the delicious cookie recipe!

Wow!  These were so easy and fast to make!  And so yummy!!  I did add a few steps to make things a little easier.  I did use Pam Baking spray to make the cookies pop out a little easier.  I also poured my melted chocolate into a squeeze bottle.  This made filling the cookies a breeze!!   This is a definite addition to my Christmas cookie collection for this year!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

These were so easy to make and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and did have some extra fudge, but not too much.  I poured my fudge into a ziploc bag and used a pastry tip to pipe in the filling, it gave me good control and made the cookies look extra special.  I also baked mine in mini-muffin cups/papers and they looked almost professional (and trust me, I am not a master baker).  Great recipe, thank you for sharing!

The best cookies I have ever eaten.  I used to go to the mall and get these at Mrs. Fields.  I haven't had one in years.  I did use a little bit more salt than the recipe called for, but other than that I followed it to a tee.  Perfect.  Absolutely perfect.  Can't wait to make again, seeing as how I ate most of them, and my kids didn't get any.

these were great!!! as i was making them, esp the fudge part (mine clumped a bit after i added the vanilla, too) i thought it would've been easier to sick a hershey's kiss in the middle like the recipe we've all had.  but trust me, it's worth the extra step.  the fudge is delicious!!  i served theses for dessert at a family dinner party re: lots of kids.  i let them put sprinkles on themselves.  way exciting.

These taste amazing and are very easy to make.  Instead of rolling into balls, I used a cookie scoop to drop the dough into the muffin tins.  I used the same scoop to fill the baked shells, very easy to fill them this way with no mess.  Have made these twice in the last week so I could share them with the neighbors.  Definitely a keeper.

Unfortunatly I messed up and used regular milk instead of condensed milk. This made the chocolate chip mixture WAY too liquid-y. But I was munching on the center bits that were removed to make room for the chocolate filling, and was dipping those into the extreamly liquid-y chocolate mixture I made like fondue. Verry delicious! Right now I'm waiting on these to cool in the fridge to see if that will help the chocolate harden and not run when eaten. I will defidently try making these again but with the sweeten condensed milk, or maybe just a lot less regular milk instead. :)

I brought these to work and everyone loved them! I didn't have a melon baller so I used the end of a cork stopper for wine and rolled it around to make the "puddle" and it worked great! I I did end up greasing the muffin tin to help the crust come out easier after it cooled.

A very solid recipe; the filling isn't spectacular, but is still very tasty - you can never go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter.  I used a squeeze-bottle for making chocolate moulds to fill the "cups".

Outstanding! I made the recipe exactly as stated, except I used Hershey's kisses in place of the milk chocolate morsels. I used a pastry bag to pipe the fudge, but next time I will use a squeeze bottle as another reviewer suggested. I also made my cookies slightly larger than the recipe called for, but they still came out perfectly! Thanks for sharing- this is a definite keeper:-)

Delicious.  I had just the right amount of dough and fudge, and didn't double the dough as others suggested.  I topped with chopped peanuts.  The only thing I didn't like was piping the fudge in the zip bag... it was hot and I couldn't use a towel because it was too cumbersome.  These are awesome cookies!

What a great recipe.  This was too easy to do!   These little guys hold a lot of chocolate so be prepared for a chocolate overload!  I piped the semi-cooled chocolate into the cups with a ziploc bag.  It worked perfectly.  I followed the recipe exactly, but forgot to put the vanilla in the chocolate filling...still tasted great!

These are good, but very rich. They are also little time consuming to make as you have to maintain the filling at a warm temperature to aid pouring, but still worth the extra effort.

These were very good.  I made very deep wells as others suggested and had the perfect amount of fudge.  I poured the chocolate into a ziplock bag and snipped off one corner to make quick work of filling the cookies. Next time I might try with all semi-sweet chips.****UPDATE! - these are SO much better by day 2/3/4.  I highly recommend making them and then waiting at least a day to eat them.  Really terrific!

I absolutely loved the crust/cookie portion, but the filling was a little boring. Dont get me wrong, this is an awesome recipe. I recommend filling the cups with a spoon and really slowly because the wells are smaller than they look and they fill up fast. I sprinkled mine with powdered sugar and they look fabulous!! Thanks debzy

These were great! As someone who doesn't use dairy I used an egg replacement (1Tb ground flaxseed & 3Tb water, simmered 3 min, cooled= 1egg). These are definitely going into the recipe box.

I don't think these were bad, necessarily. I would say this, the resulting cookies were very sweet--overly so, I think. The fudge recipe as written makes much more than is needed. When pouring the fudge, it has to be very hot to get the smooth tops (and it took some practice not to make a total mess with these). Folks at work eventually ate these, but only one person commented that the cookies were good (and that is unusual). I don't think I will take the time to make these again.

These were fabulous!  To make life easier, I used mini muffin liners.  I wouldn't change a thing!  It takes a little practice to get the fudge into the cups without making a mess, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy!  YUM!

After screwing up a truffle recipe and having 8 lbs or so of truffle filling that wouldn't form into balls, I needed a recipe that would utilize it. This recipe worked perfectly, and they came out so yummy. I followed the directions exactly and baked them for 13 minutes, and they came out great.

These are really good and very easy to make!  I used a piping bag with a large star tip to fill the cookie cups with the fudge.  They turned out really pretty.  My only complaint is that the cookies don't seem to have enough peanut butter flavor to them.  I wound up making a third batch using Betty Crocker Peanut Butter Cookie Mix with this fudge recipe - MMMMMM!!

I made these for our Christmas Open House and they were so good! I only got 40 cookies but the amount of fudge came out about right. I will definitely make these again.

A big hit! My kids had such fun making these cookies (and tasting them!). Keep the balls small when you add them to the muffin pan, otherwise, the cookies will get ginormous!

Wondering if anyone else was as anxious to bake them that they failed to see where the cookie part is supposed to be baked before adding the chocolate??? Well, I didn't catch that little direction and they still turned out wonderfully..Am axiously awaiting the second batch to do them "right" but the other way is delicious too. How can one fail with chocolate and peanut butter? Wonderful recipe. Thanks for this keeper!!

Excellent recipe.  I had a little of the chocolate filling left over to which I added chopped pecans and spread over buttered parchment. Very good fudge!  Next time that I make Fudge Puddles, I plan on mixing the chopped pecans into the chocolate filling before I fill the cups.

My husband and son loved these cookies. I had no problems getting the cups out of the pan. I sprayed the pan with baking spray, made sure they were completely cooled, and used a small paring knife to tip them out. I used Fisher nut topping(found with the ice cream toppings in the grocery) instead of pecans. It is a little salty and the combination of the salty and sweet is a favorite at my house!

Excellent cookie. I read through some of the reviews and slipped a knife around the edge and they came right out of the pan. I made half with a combination milk chocolate and peanut butter chips, and the other half the way it was written. I will make these this year for an annual cookie exchange.

These are wonderful! Very easy to make. Everything turned out well, no leftover fudge only made 42 but that could be due to portion sizes that I made, needless to say this will be going to my next family gathering.  I can't walk past them without snitching one!

Wow.. Didn't make a single change.. These are so good... I will make these over and over again.. *added note 2nd time made* I took a few batches to work and had co-workers ooohhing and aahhing over them, asking for the recipe.. I did add walnuts to the top and replaced the milk chocolate with white chocolate chips.. The fudge was so smooth and I believe tasted better. I will probably make them this way from now on. *A tip* don't fill the mini muffin cups to full, when they flowed over the cup, the overflow part would cut off from the cookie  when I made the well.. These are so worth making you won't be dissapointed.

This is a good recipe but next time I'll use semisweet chocolate chips for the fudge - it wasn't quite as dark and rich as I had hoped for.  I also think, for presentation sake, it's important to use a melon baller to get the "puddles" to look nice.  I didn't have one on hand and they weren't the best looking cookie - I mean, looked fine but not like some of the pictures attached here.

these turned out wonderful! I did not use the muffin tin, just rolled into 1" balls and made the well before baking baked only for 7 minutes; when taken out I used the melen baller to reshape the well. This recipe made 48 cookies.

Not bad. Had lots of fudge left over but was able to use in another recipe. Was afraid I would make these too big and in the end ended up with several shells that were smaller than I was aiming for. Overall a delicious treat!

I just made these for the 2nd time, and we are really enjoying them! This time when I took them out of the oven I just crowned them with some chocolate chunks. Much easier, and almost as good, but the fudge is worth it when you are not in a hurry (or feeling lazy!). The only thing I don't like about the prep is that the dough is super sticky and is hard to roll into balls. And the first time I made them I made the balls too big and that created a "muffin top," which is not what you're going for in this recipe. We are big fans of peanut butter, so I think I will be keeping this recipe handy.

Very Good.  Very rich. Best warm just before the fudge sets.  You can make the wells deep so you use most or all of the fudge filling.  If you do that, beware, that makes them very sweet, overpowering the peanut butter flavor.  When I make these again I'll likely do about 2/3ds of the filling mix and not fill them so full.  I think those will be perfect. Definitely use mini paper cups, clean up is a snap. A keeper for sure. My 4yr old loved helping me roll out those peanut butter balls.

This is a great recipe.  I baked and cooled the shells, then prepared the filling.  I used a 2-tablespoon scoop (level) to fill the mini muffin tin.  I used the same scoop to measure the filling.  The proportions were good, and I didn't have leftover shells or filling.

5 stars for looks, 4 stars for taste--I agree with other reviewers that the cookie base is just so-so.  However, the presentation is magnificent--I melted some pb and drizzled that over the fudge center, and they looked fantastic.  The cookie needs more pb flavor--next time I'll cut the butter for some pb and see if that does the job.  Also I used large muffin tins and a melon baller and had only a teaspoon of leftover fudge.  Great base recipe, looking forward to tweaking it for perfection!

Awesome! and Easy!  I made a batch then made a double batch (about 11 1/2 dozen).  When I ran out of fudge I made a white chocolate mixture and decorated with green and red sprinkles and also did a butterscotch filling.  Kids and husband loved them. I froze most for a cookie exchange.  Will surely be a holiday favorite in our house!  Thanks!

WOW!  Awesome recipe without any adjustments. Love the rich, sweet fudge center combined with the taste of creamy peanut butter "crust".  OMG...we can't stop eating them. This recipe made 2 1/2 dozen cookies for me instead of only 24. The only tip I can add is to use a plastic zip lock bag, cut the corner and use it to pipe fudge into the cookie wells. It makes for a much neater end product. I started out filling wells with a spoon, but it was too messy. The next time, I may mix chopped pecans into the fudge filling insted of placing an entire half of a pecan on top of the cookie. Enjoy! These are a real crowd pleasure. Everyone loves them!

Very good and looked great!  I would definitely recommend either doubling the cookie recipe or cutting the filling in half, I had a lot of filling left over.  I put the cookies in the freezer for a few minutes to cool and did not have a hard time getting them out of the pan.

This Recipe was a hit at my company however instead of pecans I chopped up peanut butter chips and sprinkled them on top.  Loved it going to make it a lot more...very easy. Some turned out smaller then others and I should have put more dough in each cup. I actually used muffin paper cups so they looked presentable.

Turned out good, but a little to rich for me. I also doubled the cookie recipe and had about enough dough left over to make into about 1 dozen peanut butter cookies.

These are amazing.  I agree that doubling the cookie dough is the way to go.

I make them for all the teachers at my son's school and they just go wild for them!

I thought these were good. Maybe alittle more peanut butter the in cookie part. I made the recipe as writen, only used alittle less of the condensed milk. Made too much fudge than needed for how many cookie you get. Will definitely make again.

I really like this recipe.  It is much better when cooled off.  We ate some of them while they were just out of the oven, but after the chocolate puddle sets, it is really great.  They come out of the muffin tin very easily and are very pretty to take to a party.

We were not nearly as wowed as others with this.  We thought they were simply "ok" and I won't make them again.  We could not taste any peanut butter in the final product which was disappointing.  The chocolate "puddle" wasn't nearly as rich as I thought it would be either.  They were very cute but my family and mommys group agreed they were more cute than tasty.  Sorry.

Mmmm-mmmm good! Very rich! I didn't think it was much more time consuming than other cookie recipes. I doubled the dough, and was able to bake 2 batches (24 cookies in each batch, per my mini muffin tin). What other recipe has a batch that big?? It wasn't too much extra work to spoon in the fudge. Will make these again, my family gobbled them up with big glasses of milk!

This recipe was worth the extra time, I suggest having 2 mini muffin pans due to the wait time. I didn't make the fudge portion until the cookies were done and cool and it worked great. My kids and husband loved them and I made smaller balls so my yeild was more, I also doubled the cookie recipe and still had plenty of fudge.

So good. My boyfriend, who is the one who craves chocolate, can't get enough of them. There was the perfect amount of cookie and filling, I didn't need to double the cookies like others had suggested.

Wow wow wow!  I loved these, made them for my boyfriend, big hit.  I made mine with 1/2 c melted chocolate chips and 1/4 c cocoa powder.  So the dough was peanut buttery and chocolate. Instead of condensed milk I used evaporated milk and made my filling in the microwave. It set-up very nicely.  Great recipe!

Wow! These are really much better than I thought they would be. I made them for Father's Day and they were a huge hit with my family.

These came out of the oven about an hour ago and I'm racing to rate this one.  If I could, I'd give it a 6.  I used Plugra European butter and Ghiradelli chocolates.  This recipe deserves the finest ingredients.  It makes ordinary cooks like myself look like pro masters.  Easy enough for beginners; yet, tasty enough for masters.  The perfect recipe.  Also, I did have a little chocolate left over, but I really filled the cookies well with the fudge filling so I wouldn't have had enough to double batches as previous cooks had.

Yummy!   I made these as part of Christmas gift baskets and they were a huge hit.  They not only taste great but also look great.  I did double the cookie part of the recipe as suggested and it was just enough.
