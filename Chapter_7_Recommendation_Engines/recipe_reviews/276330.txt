This is one of those recipes that you look at; see that it consists of only a few simple ingredients; and wonder: " can it really be that good?" And the answer to that question is a resounding "YES!!" Wow, this rice pudding is delicious! It's creamy, coconut-y, and so easy to make! I only made 3 servings of the recipe, to allow for only using 1 can of light coconut milk (which gave me about 1 3/4 cups of liquid), and made up the extra 1/4 cup needed with unsweetened almond milk. I also added a pinch of salt, but other than that--kept it as-is. The cook time was perfect. Just make sure you stir the rice quite frequently or it will stick to the bottom of the pan. It was also exceptional when served with some toasted coconut and almonds on top. I will most definitely be making this again---thank you for the recipe!
