This was my second attempt at fondant - I first tried the marshmallow fondant, and it never got past the sticky stage.  I tried again with this recipe, and success!  I don't think I got all 8 cups of confectioners sugar in, but it was close.  It rolls like a dream, and was incredibly easy to use.  It's very sweet, but you don't use fondant for the taste, so I can live with it.  I spritzed the bowl of my mixer with some cooking spray before I started, and had no trouble with sticking.

Great taste. doesn't take long but you need to put the sugar in before the cornsyrup or it will stick to the bottem

I don't know what the first review is all about...your hands are going to hurt after making any fondant. Anyways, I adore this recipe. I think my fondant turned out great! I have never used it before so I was hesitant about which recipe to use. I am so glad I chose this one because I was terrified it wouldn't turn out and this did. It was super fun to make. My little hand mixer couldn't hold up to it but I figured that from the start. My hands worked just as well. I had to add a little extra powdered sugar but other than that I had no problems! Thanks for a great recipe that I will use over and over again!

Great Fondant recipe, and I've tried quite a few...for those reviewers that say it's too sticky, make sure you let it SET at least until room temperature...DON'T just add more and more sugar!  That is what makes it so crumbly when you go to use it (I made that mistake myself the first time trying this recipe).  If it's still even slightly warm from the gelatin mixture, it's NOT READY! 
   It has worked best for me to make it a day ahead, and tightly wrap in a couple layers of plastic wrap for the next day's use (I always put a TINY bit of shortening (like the size of a pearl) on my hands and then pat it into a ball before putting in plastic to keep it from drying out or sticking to the plastic).
  As for COLORING, I use Wilton Gel Paste colors...just put a couple spots of color around your desired amoutn of fondant with a toothpick and knead it by hand (if fondant starts to stick to your hands, and it WILL, spread a tiny bit of shortening all over your hands and continue...I always do this several times).  Best technique I've found for totally blending in colors is stretching it repeatedly like taffy...if your fondant is the correct consistency you should be able to stretch it without breakage after softening by kneading it.  
  Quick softening tip: rub fondant between hands into a cylindrical shape a couple of times...spreads your body heat quicker!
  Don't be afraid of getting your hands a little dirty!  Happy Decorating!

Super easy, yummy and not as sweet as the marshmallow fondant recipe.  I put 7 cups of powdered sugar in the kitchen aid bowl and added all the ingredients on top of that (used all oil instead of adding the shortening) and then with the dough hook I turned the machine on low.  After all the sugar was kneaded in (by the machine :), if it still looked sticky I added more powdered sugar and when I took it out I only kneaded it a few times before storing.  This is my new go-to recipe for fondant.

This was a great help. I avoided the expense of a fondant rolling pin and bought a pvc pipe for $2.00 It worked wonderfully!

This recipe is perfect!  I've never made fondant & today felt especially crafty, so I gave it a shot. I sort of mixed it up roughly by hand, then used my bread machine to do all the thorough mixing (in 1/3 portions) and got the most perfect fondant within minutes. This goes in my permanent collection. Thanks

I also tried the marshmallow fondant and couldn’t get past the sticky stage. This had the slightly milder flavor I was looking for and rolled out so much better. The first time I rolled it out with too much powdered sugar, got it too dry, and it cracked. But once I figured out that it didn’t take as much powdered sugar to roll out, it turned out to be the easiest fondant I have ever used. Rolling it on the wax paper was a great tip and worked like a charm!

I used this recipe for a small red velvet cake, and I had some left over. So I added a bit of food coloring and used it to make some flowers. This is a great recipe!

We made this fondant and it was our firtst try so it could be that, but it didn't work well. It seemed very greasy and we couldn't get it on the cake so we just decorated with it. We also had trouble with that so we put the fondant in the fridge to finish with in the morning and after it chilled it was much better.

Very good recipe! This was the first time I had ever used fondant, let alone make it and it was awesome. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews, they probably didn't take it all the way. Yes it is crumbly when you are mixing it and it doesn't seem that it will ever come together, but once you have all the ingredients mixed, take the bowl off the mixer stand and use your hands!! I had to add about a tbs of water when I was kneading it and once I had all the crumbly bits stuck into one big ball I kneaded it some more and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds, it softened up and I had it all uniformly mixed within a couple minutes.  Oh if you want to make it taste even better than it already does add about 3 tsp of your favorite extract, or just stick to the ole stand-by and use vanilla (clear if you want to keep it white, and it's easily found at any grocery store; I got clear vanilla at wal-mart). Another couple of tips, if you add food color, add it and mix it in before you begin adding the sugar, and leave the corn starch out for rolling it out, use the vegetable shortening, rub some on the roller and the surface, it works like a dream!  I would recommend this recipe to any first-timer, it tastes great and as long as you roll it out to the right thickness, it goes on a cake easily and smoothly! Go buy a fondant rolling pin and smoother, that'll cost you about 25 bucks at wal-mart! Happy baking, hope this helps!!

I think I did it!!!! This is my first fondant trial. I was so scared I keep putting it off. It was done in minutes! I chose this recipe because I don't have a microwave for the marshmallow fondant. I did not use a mixer, I don't have a stand mixer and from the other reviews the hand mixer can't handle the whole batch anyway. So I put the sugar in a big bowl, made a well in the center, add the corn syrup, oil, shortening in the middle and I stirred with a wooden spoon, add the gelatin mixture while still stirring the spoon. This incorporates about half the batch, then I knead the rest with hand. DONE!!!! I'm so happy! I'm going to use this for decoration only so I will tint some of the fondant with colors and go from there. It tastes sugary (well, what do you expect? lol). Thank you so much for an easy recipe!

This was my 1st time making fondant - I've always used buttercream in the past but we wanted something extra special for baby's 1st birthday so I tried this recipe and I'm glad I did!  It rolls like a dream and was so easy to use. It's very sweet and decorates cake beautifully!!
UPDATE:  The more I use this fondant the easier it gets and the better my cakes look.  I love this recipe and now I only use fondant :)

Super simple to make and easy to work with.  Ingredients are easy to come by and taste so much better than store bought fondant.  Definately a keeper.  FYI one recipe makes a batch approx size of a grapefruit.  I made 2 batches and ended up with WAY too much for what I'm doing

This was my first attempt at fondant and it turned out great.  I made a layered cake so I frosted each layer with buttercream icing recipe (also 5 stars) and froze them so the fondant was easier to munipulate.  It looks awesome!! I was so happy that the consistency was easy to work with.

This was a great recipe to work with for a first timer. I had a hard time finding the glycerin called for in other recipes. This was very easy to work with and only had to get the geletin. Really had to work in the color that was the most work i had to work it. I will def. be using this recipe again. I did add a tablespoon of vanilla.

This fondant is PERFECT!! I've made AR's marshmallow fondant before, and it worked out but I needed something FAST! I tried the buttercream fondant recipe from AR but it didn't work out at all, so this recipe was great for a quick fix! I followed the recipe and directions exactly and it gave me perfect, easy to roll, good tasting fondant. This is the ONLY fondant recipe I will ever use again. Thanks so much for the recipe Holly!!

This is my new go to fondant recipe. I have always made the marshmallow fondant and liked the taste but often had trouble with it being sticky. This has a great texture. I did probably use a cup less sugar than called for.

This was my first time making or using fondant, and it worked out pretty well. The difficulties I encountered were more because of my inexperience than because of the recipe, which seemed great. I echo what another reviewer said--add the corn syrup AFTER the sugar; mine did stick to the bowl. I don't have a stand mixer so I mixed by hand, which wasn't too bad but be prepared to have very sticky, fondant-covered hands, and be sure you've prepared something to put the mixed fondant down on (or scrape it off your hands on to) when you're done! After chilling I used powdered sugar instead of cornstarch for rolling and it worked fine.

i have two left hands when it comes to things like this but this recipe won't fail you.  note though that you need an industrial mixer to make this work - don't burn out your regular one.  if it starts to slow down, put on some gloves and mix it by hand.  it will roll out just fine this way.  my 11 year old daughter made this with me and could roll it out by herself and make shapes.  tastes good too but mostly will make you look like you work for the "cake boss" himself!

this is an incredibly simple recipe with great texture. 
i just microwaved the gelatin and water for 20 seconds and that worked well.
putting the icing sugar in the bowl first and adding the other ingredients after, like other reviews suggested was good because you didnt have you worry about the corn syrup or anything sticking to the bottom of the bowl.

a few tweaks i would suggest is first, that although it doesnt taste bad, its not as tasty as the marshmallow fondant, so maybe next time i will add a teaspoon or two of clear vanilla extract. 

second, you need to use the dough hook for the stand mixer, any other beater would be too big and will burn out the motor and not mix it properly.

also, you dont need to mix it for 15 minutes. let the stand mixer mix it for about 5 or so minutes just to let the ingredients combine and start to hold together, then take it out and finish it up by kneading it on a surface dusted with cornstarch. you dont need to knead it for long, maybe 2 minutes?
and i would skip the refridgeration if you are using it right away, it holds its shape extremely well and doesnt get too sticky.

This is very similar to a recipes I used in a cake book some years ago, and since my library was closed, I defaulted to this recipe and I am not disappointed with it.  This fondant, and the other fondants I;ve made are pretty fail proof if you follow the direction and they take minutes.  You can spend $6+ on premade fondant or make your own for just over a dollar, hmmm which would you choose?  I take expending a bit of energy to get the same product or better thank you.  :)  Although I still prefer buttercreams or other frosting and icing, fondant has its uses, I would personally rather eat flowers made of butter cream then fondant, they are quite tasteless and overly sweet, but fondant is generally smoother looking, but I think this also makes cakes appear more dull and boring, even the more elaborate ones.  :)  I like to see a combination of both mediums personally.  :)  God Bless ~Amy

I tried this and my fondant stuck straight onto the counter. I asked someone who makes cakes and she said to use confectioner's sugar, not cornstarch to powder the surface. I had to trash an entire batch because of the cornstarch :(

Love this it is the closest recipe I have found to a traditional fondant! Very easy to work, and simple to make!! Will definatly use again!!! Only thing I did to add to this recipe is to add a little vanilla extract.

First time making fondant and will continue to use this easy recipe.  Cake turned out perfect.  Next time will use a cup less confectioners' sugar.

A++++++  ?The Best and Easiest Fondant Recipe I have ever made....and i have made a lot of them...I would suggest putting the confectioners sugar in the bowl BEFORE ANY liquids, and I like to flavor mine so i added a trablespoon of Almond extract...i tried 1 tsp. but couldn't taste anything...i did turn mine out onto a confectioner sugar covered marble surface and needed another cup into the dough before putting into the frig...

I had to add more water then recipe called for, rolling on cornstarch was difficult. I used oil on the countertop for rolling fondant. Texture was not as smooth as I anticipated. I chose this recipe because it looked easy, but will not use it again.

I have a friend who is allergic to corn syrup, a terrible thing to be allergic to!  So I substituted a simple syrup for the corn syrup and it turned out fantastic!!!  It's my first time making fondant and I was really impressed!

It didnt turn out well and kept on breaking due to dryness...i wanted to cover a v small cake but it couldnt spread even little! I was very disappointed as I was decorating my bday cake and had put lot of efforts and $$!  I had followed the recipe as suggested and infact added less sugar and thought I would add more if needed but it didnt work out for me :(.

I thought this recipe was great. We accidentally left some out and it got dry, but just kneading it again with a little Crisco softened it right back up.

This fondant recipe is good but in my opinion could be improved! I noticed how gross the unflavored gelatin smelled. I'll look for an alternative. There's simply too much powdered sugar in this recipe. I ended up adding about 1 1/2 -2 Tablespoons of water. I feel this could use a little flavoring. I think the suggestion of clear vanilla would be nice. 
On the whole it behaves perfectly as a fondant icing(better than the marshmallow) and stores nicely

Awesome Recipe.  Thank You Coryb, your comments were really helpful.  my first attempt was successful, but like others i didn't get all 8 cups of sugar in.  i mixed it like dough eventually like Samantha mentioned and got as much in as i could.  it was awesome, but i needed it to be black for my son's Cubscout cake contest.  so i created a second batch using dough hooks on my hand mixer.  that worked out great.  i put food color, maple flavor and butter flavor in the water/shortening/oil/cornsyrup mixture and that worked out well.  the fondant is really tasty and black.  Coryb's comments of using shortening to handle it was a great idea.  i put the ball on a wax paper, rolled out the fondant with a regular rolling pin, put it quickly in the freezer to set it so i could turn it over onto my cake.  Fantastic stuff.  you guys are working hard to make me an expert. Thanks for everyone's comments.  DShane

This was so easy in my kitchen aid and so easy t work with and to make different colors that my three year old son helped me!  I will be using this many times this year as i cannot wait to practice my technique!  Yay for fancy decorating!  I used this over a whole wheat applesauce cake, and next time i think i will add different extracts to make it different flavors!  thanks for the recipe!

I'm 16 and I did this with my mom no problem! It was a fun experiment and we finished two batches within the hour! We don't know what all the complaints about - it was very easy. A little messy, sure, but what recipe isn't? If you know how to knead bread dough, this is cake (no pun intended).

I used this recipe for my son's first birthday cake. I had tried making my own marshmallow fondant before, but it was so sticky--I couldn't work with it. This recipe, though, was great! I actually had to make 3 recipes to cover and decorate my cake. It took me a while to figure out how to lift it up onto the cake without it tearing, but once I VERY THOROUGHLY covered my rolling area with confectioners suger, it lifted without a hitch. The more I worked with it, the easier it became. It covered great and was also perfect for cutouts and ribbons! All of our guests raved about the look and taste of the fondant! This is definitely going to be my permanent recipe!! ANYONE could do this!!

This fondant is wonderful and very easy to work with. I had never made or used fondant before and I found this recipe very simple to make and work with. I used my dough hook on my kitchenaid so I didnt have to knead by hand. I made one recipe and split it after it was made and then tinted it and it was perfect. It also tasted very good and had a good texture. I could totally see mixing in different kind of extracts and things for different flavors to accent different kinds of cakes. I will use this recipe every time I go to make fondant.

Easy recipe to follow.... a little more about how to ensure success in step 2 would help. I had virtually no liquid in the bowl - - it was just powder and would not turn to that paste stage. Was it something I did with the gelatin?? I had to add more water. Also, I recommend adding some flavoring - I added a splash of vanilla and a splash of almond to round the flavor out.

wow, if I only knew it's this easy to make your own fondant...I am going to use cookie cutters to make cut-out to place on cupcakes, it looks like it'd be pretty easy.  I haven't colored them because I need a deep color, so I'm using this one as a white fondant. I would only color my own fondant if I need a pastel color otherwise it will take a lot of coloring to get a deep color, at that rate you might as well buy ready made ones. One thing I encountered that was an issue was that I let my gelatin mixture sit too long and it started to solidify, and became hard to mixed in, so I would prepare the mixture when you're already mixing the dough.

I absolutely loved this fondant! It worked out really well for us. I've had to go back and forth on using cornstarch or shortening to roll it out on depending on the humidity here. Only once did I have it too dry to roll out as it kept cracking, but that was my own error. When I follow the recipe, it comes out perfect! Tastes awesome too!

After reading most of the reviews, I felt confident this fondant could be easy to work with.  I did not have any problems working with the fondant, and I followed the directions exactly.  This was the first time I have ever made my own fondant and was very pleased with the results.  The guests raved about the fondant.  Definitely would recommend this easy to make and delicious recipe!

This was my first time making fondant. We followed the recipe exactly. It took forever to get it to form a paste, I think my corn syrup was a bit old and thick and my low-end stand mixer is not the strongest tool so that may have played into it. Eventually it came together.  I tinted mine yellow and had to work it in the bowl by hand to distribute the color. I just coated my hands with shortening and it worked beautifully.  No mess no fuss.  We were so pleased with our end results.  I am keeping this recipe!!

This is an excellent and easy recipe.  I used a kitchen aid mixer with my cookie attachment & near the end had to finish by hand as the mixer kept stopping...mine is about 20 years old, though!  It makes tons of fondant if you're using 1/8" as your thickness for rolling. (I could easily cover two 9" round 4" thick cakes with excess, maybe enough for a third)  Coloring has to be done in small batches afterwards, if you can't do it before hand mixing the coloring in with the syrup (when I did this you couldn't tell what the color would be until the very end & some hand kneading was still necessary to get it even)...I haven't tried mixing it with the water, yet.

Also, I watched some youtube videos (I found Krazy Kool Cakes to be the most helpful and thorough) on how to keep it from cracking, how to patch, and covering a round cake without excess that were really helpful...even though I live near the ocean and in high humidity, kneading a small bit of the recipe and spraying it with water when you see it not smooth as you knead made it a wonderful consistency for rolling out.  I also had good success using betty crocker or duncan hines buttercream to 'stick' my fondant to my cake.  I'm sure homemade would also work well, but while practicing, I went the easy route!

I'm making my stepson's bday cake at the end of the month and am going to attempt to use fondant, so I wanted to try to work with it first before I started his cake.  I thought I would try this recipe as it had pretty good reviews.  I don't know if I did something wrong but this just didn't work for me.  It tasted pretty good, but it didn't seem to matter what I did, I could not work with it without it cracking and tearing.  I tried adding a little water, more shortening, rolling out on corn starch, icing sugar, shortening....  I ended up running out and buying fondant which was WAY easier to work with.  I was able to use this fondant for smaller cut out pieces, but there was no way it was going to work to cover a cake.  

Maybe someday I will try making fondant again, but in the meantime I think I'll stick to buying it.  Most people I've seen don't eat it anyway, even the homemade stuff (which is really sweet), so I think for now I'll save the frustration and buy it.

i used this on i cake for a party and it was really easy and looked really good on my cake, but it doesnt taste half as great as it looks. most people ended up just eating around it. if you're looking for an easy recipe this is definately the way to go.

I do not like the taste of store bought fonant so I decided to try this recipe out.  This is a keeper!!! I had no problems with it.  I started out using my kitchen aid and finished with my hands.  It was very easy to work with.  I had no problems with it sticking and did not need to chill it.  It made more than enough.  Thank you for sharing:)

This recipe showed up on my daily feed the same day my daughter asked about fondant so I said why not.  We made it and had a blast practicing and playing.   It comes together easily and has a great texture to it.  Inexperienced teenage girls had great success.  and the flavor wasn't too bad either.   Highly recommend this recipe.

I used this recipe for my very first fondant cake.  It was a 12" round wedding cake and it came out beautifully.  The only issue I had was I had to add only 7 cups sugar and then knead the rest in by hand because it was too stiff for my mixer.  Other than than absolutely perfect.

It was my first try at making fondant, and even though I don't own a KitchenAid mixer, I made it anyway. I just had to roll up my sleeves and knead away, and it was tough and left me with aching hands and forearms - but so worth it! I did use food coloring and had to knead it in after the initial mixing, but next time I make it (and if I know I need a lot of one color), I will add in the food color at the beginning with the water and gelatin on the stove. Also, when I made it, I didn't use cornstarch at all. I sprayed my hands down with Pam and the table as well where I kneaded the fondant. Next time I make it, I don't think I'll refrigerate it either 'cause it actually made more work for my poor hands & seemed to dry it out more, too. For my first time, I think it went well, considering my lack of kitchen appliances, and I look forward to the next time I get to play with fondant. :)

My first time ever using fondant and this recipe was easy and did a great job! I do not recommend using a cheap mixer. I made that mistake and it blew the engine on it, lucky grandma has a heavy duty cake mixer.Oh and this fondant has a wayyy better flavor than the store bought fondant which is what I was going to do first until I realized how much cheaper it is to just make.

Until recently I had never worked with fondant.  I do like the marshmallow fondant recipe but that one takes a lot of time.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  It was quite easy to make and doesn't have to be refrigerated long if at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and as previous users stated, there was no need for the full 8 cups of confectionery sugar.  I worked a little oil/water into the fondant when it seemed a bit dry.  I know practicing more will prevent my fondant from cracking but overall I was very happy with this recipe!

I tried the marshmallow fondant without much success. You need a Kitchen Aid to make this - I think the stickiness of the fondant will overheat/break normal hand beaters.  Very easy to roll (used PAM to coat my rolling pin instead of corn starch) and had no problems with cracking or dryness.  Once made, it assembles like play dough.

The first time I made this fondant, I was unfamiliar with working with gelatin and the fondant turned out a bit of a mess. But the second time – perfect. This will be my go to fondant recipe. It's awesome.

I made two batches of this to make a two-tiered birthday cake. Each tier was three layers. Had plenty on fondant to cover and decorate with plus it tastes GREAT! I used to use a different recipe but this is now my number one recipe. I didn't have any problems with stickiness or excessive tearing. I was surprised that with both oil and shortening in the recipe that it wasn't greasy either. 
I also rolled out my fondant on Saran Wrap to make transferring to my cakes easier. Worked like charm since I couldn't spring for a fondant mat and had forgotten to get cornstarch.

This was pretty good for my first time making fondant. Putting the ingredients together was not hard, the first time I wasn't paying attention and I completely messed up the measurements and had to start over, but once it was finished the texture was pretty good. I used dark corn syrup and it did not affect the color. Although, I would definitely advise using powdered sugar instead of corn starch to avoid sticking. The hardest part was rolling it so it wouldn't be too thin and tear, but I think this will get easier with practice.

Wow! So easy to make and fun to work with once you use plenty cornstarch to prevent sticking. I used 2 lb sugar because that's how the bags are even though that should be a little less than the amount required. It was perfect. First time ever making fondant and using it too, I followed instructions exactly, used paddle attachment in stand mixer, it was a lot of work for my poor mixer tough. I then gathered into a ball and dusted with cornstarch and wrapped in plastic wrap to place in fridge.

First time using fondant and first time making it. We only had 4 cups of powdered sugar (the package was only 32oz) and I ended up having to add another 1/4 cup of water and package of gelatin. But everything came together after that. Also we added a bit of vanilla extract. Tastes delicious! 

BTW: I do not have a mixer. I mixed it all by hand

Love this recipe.  It was super easy and I used my hands to mix it as I don't have a stand mixer...... it worked really well.  Not sure about it's tastes was using it more for decorating, going to try a little flavour in the water next time and see how it tastes then right now it just taste like sugar

Thank you so much for posting this recipe. I used it to make a birthday cake for my sister and it came out perfectly! This was my first time ever making homemade fondant and only my second time ever using fondant. It actually tastes good, too, unlike the store bought kind I got last time. It was easy to make colorful by kneading in pretty food dye, so the flowers on the cake came out lovely. Thank you!

this has been a wonderful recipe for me.  i began making decorator cakes more than a year and a half ago.  this is the recipe i began with and have tweeked until i have something that is wonderful to work with and has a fantastic flavor.  experiment, add some glycerin, some tylose powder and some flavors. the glycerin will give you a longer working time with it and the tylose will give it a stronger, better consistency.  if you add larger amounts of tylose you'll be able to use it to make cutouts and figures.  people complain about the flavor of fondant and by adding flavors you get an end product that most people will eat and i get comments all the time about how they heard fondant tasted bad, but this was great!  my go too are vanilla and butter, lorann brand is worth the extra cost & you don't have to use a lot.  you can also use lorann oils, just a drop or two and get a huge range of flavors.  wrap this tightly in two layers of plastic wrap and put it in a gallon zip lock and remove all the air.  you can leave it on the counter or in the fridge.  it will last at least a month, or you can freeze it, keep it wrapped until it's thawed.

I also used this recipe and oh my was it perfect! This was my first attemp ever t homeade fondant and i could not have asked for anything better! I would recommend you have a large enough bowl to mix it in, specially if you are making a double recipe for a tiered cake; but it tuned out perfect. I also used a clear butter flavor for taste value, again, perfect! Thanks so much!

Love this recipe! I did find it a bit sticky and hard to work with even after letting it cool to room temp, but then I lightly dusted my hands with cornstarch and it was great!It stretches well, doesn't crack, and smoothed out easily. 

This was the third recipe that I tried, and I was ready to give up and cry. 
Third time's a charm!

Instead of using shortening, can I use margarine?
