It came out terrific. The easiest omelette recipe I have ever used. I did not use the bacon, red pepper or green onions and it still tasted great!

Easy recipe to make, with exceptional results.  Wanted to only put onions and peppers on half so the kids would eat it too, so instead of mixing these in, I sprinkled them on top.  Turned out really well, and it was devoured by everyone!  Thanks for the recipe.  We'll be making it often!

This was very good. I had trouble getting the flour mixed in so it had lots of little flour lumps but in the end result you can't tell. I used precooked bacon pieces (like for salad topping) dried chives and some onion powder in place of the green onions. I served this with El Fenix restaurant salsa, and it was so delicious. Some of the eggs ran under the parchment paper but it still came out the dish easily and the loss was only about 1 egg. I'll make this again. Thanks!

we do anther recpe similar to this one but it has cream cheese in the egg mixture. I was out of cream cheese and needed to make breakfast for a crowd so I tried this recipe and filled it with baby spinach, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, green onion and bacon. For cheese we used a combo of pepper jack and cheddar. It was amazing everyone said. ;-)

I sauteed my veggies so when I went to roll it, it did not roll.  I scooped it up and put it in a dish to have a serving in the mornings as breakfast.  It tastes good but does not look good since it did not roll.  The only reason I can think of is because of the cooked veggies adding more liquid.  May try again sometime with raw veggies.

This recipe was fabulous!  I added turkey bacon and sausage, spinach leaves and parsley to the ingredients.  I did not have parchment paper, so I used foil instead (did not work!).  After it baked, I just messily scraped it into bowls and it made a wonderfully filling breakfast bowl.  I also mixed in pineapple mango salsa and it was a great add!  We loved it! :)

I may have overdone it with the oregano, but this was like a warm, delicious Italian breakfast. I can't wait to make it again with different vegetables!

My family and I really enjoyed this form of omlette. It was delicious, and I learned what a jelly roll pan was and how to use it.

This recipe has been added to my Keepsake recipes book. I followed the basic egg recipe and cooking directions, but I changed up the meats and veggies. Have made it several times since and get RAVE reviews every time I make it. You can change the meats, veggies and cheeses and it is perfect (and beautiful) each time. I cooked the meat & lightly saut√©ed the veggies and just spooned them on top the eggs before baking. My family has requested it be added to our traditional Christmas morning brunch. That is high praise indeed. THANK YOU for this recipe. 
Do not try this at home WITHOUT PARCHMENT PAPER. :)

I did not care for this recipe. Next time, little to no flour.

Even my 9 year old grandson loved this recipe! I used my food processor to finely chop veggies (and I added mushrooms, too). Loved the presentation and how easy it was to slice it for servings.

I have never made an omelette. First try for fathers day. This was fantastic - super easy to make and the whole family loved it. Would definitely do this again - maybe christmas morning.

Absolutely perfect! I added 3 more eggs a little more milk and flour because I had a larger pan. I skipped the salsa so you can add it on top. I will make this for Christmas morning because it has all the Christmas colors except I did not have a red bell pepper but I will next time! Loved this! Oh I forgot Do Not cook the veggies first mix all together then bake and the peppers will still have a little crunch.

I was skeptical of this working but we loved it. I used less flour/milk than called for (it seemed like too much). I didn't have any bell pepper so I wilted a bit of spinach and put it on under the cheese (at the end). I went with different spices since we like heat - added in some cajun seasoning instead of oregano. Thanks for the recipe!

I had major, major brain obstruction while making this.  I am way overdue to go grocery shopping and we've been on bare bones for a few days now, so really all I had was eggs, 3 slices of bacon, and salsa.  I mixed them together b/c apparently I can't read, seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked in a too-large pan for 10 min.  It made a very thin, perfectly cooked roll.  I just sprinkled the cheese and rolled straight up, did not return it to the oven.  I also used my silpat and greased it with a bit of bacon grease.  Yum!  Everyone enjoyed.
