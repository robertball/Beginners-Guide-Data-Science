I made this in the crockpot.  I put 5 frozen chicken breasts in with the Italian dressing.  After it was cooked I shredded the chicken and added the rest of the ingredients.  When it was nice and creamy I stirred in a package of cooked egg noodles.  Easy and yummy.  Everyone said it was a make again.

So I liked the basics of this recipe but I did make changes that suited my taste after reading that it ended up tasting bland.
 
I used the Italian dressing mix as a dry rub on my chicken and it sat in the fridge for a couple of hours. I sauteed onions in the olive oil  instead of using chives. I added the 2 minced garlic cloves because I love garlic. I poured chicken stock (because it's more flavorful than chicken broth) into the pan with the sauteed onions and garlic.  I then added my lemon juice, lemon pepper, garlic and onion powder and some herbs de provence.. I after bringing to a boil, I reduces the temp to low and added the cream cheese, whisking until creams.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella for the bolder flavor it gives. I placed my chicken in the bottom of my casserole dish topped with a layer of cheese next my spinach and then the creamy mixture topped with more cheese and cooked it for 30 minutes at the 375. It tasted very flavorful and was completely devoured.

Not bad.  Very creamy, which isn't my favorite but hubs likes creamy dishes and it sounded intriguing, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Until I realized (after taking everything out of course) that I didn't have enough cream cheese for a full or even a half recipe.  :(  So I improvised and made a roux to compensate.  It made for a very runny but good casserole.  I actually liked it a lot, despite the runniness and the cream.  I'll have to try it again when I have the correct amount of cream cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out soupy and the mozzarella cheese even sank in. I'd like to try to make this again with some tweeks. I would add more chicken, more spinach, less broth.

There were no leftovers!  I made a couple of changed based on what I had on hand, but otherwise followed it to the tee.  (I used  a half cup of parmesan instead of mozzarella and teaspoon of  italian seasoning instead of  marinating)  I will be making this again and this time I will have everything on hand to follow the recipe exactly.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I doubled the recipe and it turned into soup.  It was very tasty but the texture was all wrong.  Seems like it needed eggs or something to make the cream cheese more stiff.

This is easy, relatively quick and no fuss. Great as a leftover. My fam loved it.  Due to time constraints I didn't marinate the chicken but cooked it before shredding in a crock pot with the italian dressing and some broth.  Then put it together and shoved it in the oven.  Would make again, thanks.

I have a 13 year old daughter who likes everything dry simple and plain. I made this dish and she actually said she liked it. It even went the next day as leftovers. Usually my family just leaves  leftovers for me to clean out of the fridge.

Made it by the directions. (Always do, the first time) It was a kid win (ages 3 and 7) and husband win. I would add more spinach next time and try more diligently to have softened cream cheese. I think because mine was made quickly it was a little chunky, but still delicious!

This was awesome! I didnâ€™t cut chicken up but cooked whole breasts that were cut thin.  Made pasta and peas for sides.

This must be written wrong!  If made as written it's a soup!
I made it with 2 cups cubed chicken, half of the spinach and 1/4 of the rest of the ingredients.  It was delicious this way!!!!!

The flavor was ok.  Followed the directions but it was VERY soupy!  Uncovered it, kept cooking hoping some of the liquid would evaporate but gave up and added some dry noodles to absorb the extra liquid.  That worked.  Probably won't make again.

Prepared with low calorie bleu cheese dressing, low fat cream cheese (used only 1/2 the cream cheese), half the chicken broth and it was delicious.  Lower in calories than recipe stated.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I will change next time is I'll add more spinach and probably some fresh parm cheese. I also made some egg noodles and put this over the top of the pasta.

It was good - not great but I liked it.  I was hoping my picky husband would like it, but he said it was just ok and although I would make it for myself again I doubt he would want me to make it for him again.  I am actually going to make a vegan version for my son and I am pretty sure he and his girlfriend will really like it.  Oh, and the 2 packages of cream cheese was not too much.  It made just the right amount of sauce.
