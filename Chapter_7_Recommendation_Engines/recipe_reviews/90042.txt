Good except the dressing was way too sweet.  Will try it with half the sugar.

I made a 1/2 recipe and went a little light on the spinach, I used about 1/2 the dressing, we like it light.  I also only used 1/2 the amount of sugar like other reviewers suggested which was perfect.  I topped the salad with fresh bacon bits and I sauteed the mushrooms in a little bacon grease and white wine and threw them on top warm just before serving, it made kind of a wilted spinach salad.  We just don't care much for raw mushrooms.

The flavors in the salad are great, I reduced the sugar (the ketchup already has some) and I cut the total amount of dressing in half and it was still a little too much for me.  The dressing is good, but I like to be able to taste the vegetables.

TASTY! This dressing was one of the nicest I've had - chock full of flavor. Only change to recipe was the use of sunflower oil instead of canola - as it was all I had. Surprised that caloric level is so high.

I made as written except that I added crumbled bacon to the top for my meat loving husband. I do wish I would have read the reviews beforehand for I too found the dressing to be entirely too sweet and will cut the sugar in half next time. Other than that, this was a winner all the way and I very much enjoyed the addition of mustard powder and paprika.

Salad tasted good, but not great.  The dressing was way to much for me -- I halved the sugar but left the recipe the same otherwise.  I just left the dressing on the side and dipped my fork tongs in before each bite.

This salad is very good for something a little different.  I agree that the dressing is too sweet, so you may want to half the sugar then add more if necessary.  I also increased the oil and vinegar slightly to make it a little thinner.  I used regular tomatoes and sunflower seeds because I didn't have almonds.  Very tasty though!

I loved all the ingredients, but thought the dressing was not right at all.

Great salad! The hearts of palms gave a nice flavor to this salad. I omitted the cherry tomatoes and added an envelope of splenda instead of sugar.

Made this salad for hubby because he loves hearts of palm.  Knowing him, I omitted the sugar altogether because he dislikes sweet dressing.  The blend of flavours along with the tweaked dressing was fantastic.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this salad for company.  The added crunch of the almonds was my favourite part and I think I would try adding bacon next time.
