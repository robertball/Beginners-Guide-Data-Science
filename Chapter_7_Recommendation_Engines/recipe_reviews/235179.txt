I find adding a cup of sauce makes this dish too sweet. So I added 3 chillies to balance it out. Reduce the tomato sauce to half a cup rather as it also creates too much of a gravy sauce as well. I added chickpeas to my version as a filler....

The photograph shows carrots and chickpeas which are not in the ingredients but I added. I also added more allspice and some 7spice. I would have added a bit more meat as there's not much on neck bones but even without the added meat there was the lamb flavor. This is a good and easy recipe. I also served mine over a cracked wheat/vermicelli mixture a opposed to rice.
