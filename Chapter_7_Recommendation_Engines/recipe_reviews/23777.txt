This was really good flavored!  Texture was a little odd though.  I only made one pie, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and the water to 1 1/2 cups.  Next time I will cut the cornstarch to 2 T. as it "jelled" really quickly and firmly!  But will definitely make again.  Will try with Splenda and sugar-free Jello to eliminate the sugar.  Addendum:  Made the second one sugar free using 1/2 cup Splenda, 2 T. cornstarch, 1 cup water and sugar free Jello.  It was great!

This is a wonderful way to use fresh peaches.  It's also a cool summertime dessert that almost prepares itself.

This recipe is so versatile. Just match the fresh fruit to the jello flavor. The strawberry is incredible. I don't think there is enough filling to make 2 pies but definitely enough for a deep dish pie or a regular pie shell and a few tarts. I have also used this with prepared shortbread crust for a really easy version. Enjoy!

It was the best way to use the peaches we bought in our trip to Georgia. The recipe is good and easy.

It was pretty sugery so I would cut that down.  I would also do more peaches and less glaze.  Pretty good taste however.

This pie is amazing! This is the first recipe I've ever used for a fresh peach pie (my mom always baked them), and now it's the only recipe I ever use. The instructions are clear, and it's quick and simple to make. The first time I made it I modified it because I happened to have apricot jell-o on hand instead of peach. Now I much prefer this variation.

This is the best fresh peach pie I have ever made.  As soon as I make them, they are gone, my whole family loves the fresh peach taste.

Great Peach Pie. Recipe only made one pie though. I only used 1/3 cup sugar and a large box of sugar free peach jello. Turned out a bit stiff but fantastic for an extremely low sugar dessert!

I've used this recipe many times over the last few years -- typically in August, when we get fresh peaches from the Western Slope of Colorado.  The pies are always a big hit, and very easy to make.

This recipe was great, BUT.. I used about 5-6 cups of peaches and this barely covered one pie. I used all of the peaches I had, so I had way entirely too much of the jello mixture that went to waste. Next time I'll cut the jello mixture in half for one pie and definitley use more than four cups of peaches. I thought the pie would mold more but I may not have refrigerated it long enough.

My mother has used this recipe for years. We've experimented over time and used different combinations of jello and fruit. Our favorite was one made with tropical fruit jello and all different kinds of fruits and berries.

This is my husband's all-time favorite pie. An improvement over my family's old recipe that called for too much cornstarch. This seemed to gel up just right. Homemade crust and real whipped cream make a huge difference.

This is a good recipe, but it depends on how much thick gelatin you want covering the peaches (I use 1/2, or a little more, pkg. flavored gelatin and about 1 cup of water).  The sugar could be cut to 1/2 cup.  By adding the sugar a little at a time until you can get the level of sweetness you'd like in your pie. The cornstarch does thicken it up even more.  I used 2 T cornstarch and the filling turned out fine and plenty stiff.  This recipe is like making a package of peach gelatin, putting peaches in it and putting it into a crust, but the cornstarch gives it less of a chance to make the pie crust soggy and a pie with a  better texture.

Way to sugery!  I cut the recipe in half to make only one pie and I wish I would have cut the sugar in half after that as well.  I didn't have any cornstarch so I used flour instead.  For every 1 tablespoon of cornstarch I used 2 tablespoons flour.

This pie is getting 5 stars because my husband said it's the best one I've ever made.  I did use a little less sugar and made one deep dish peach pie instead of 2 regular pies.

This fresh, no-bake (except the crust) peach pie was excellent!  A great summer dessert.  Willl make it again next summer with my husband.

I had to modify this recipe quite a bit to enjoy it.  I can see how this recipe works for those who don't mind artificial flavor from peach gelatin and don't have access to a decent fresh peach.  But I found the gelatin flavor to be very distracting from the natural taste of the peaches I used (which happened to be really tangy, sweet and flavorful on their own).  I used 1/3 of the glaze and still felt like it didn't compliment the peaches, even though I received glowing compliments.  So my guests probably give it five and I give it two stars-- next time I will try to make a more neutral glaze with some lemon and possibly tapioca.

What a great recipe!  My husband, son, and father said it was the best tasting peach pie they ever had, cooked or uncooked!  We have made 4 pies in 3 days.  My only problem is that my glaze didn't set well.  I will up the cornstarch next time.  Thanks for the recipe!
