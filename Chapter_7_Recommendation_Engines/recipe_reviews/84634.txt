This recipe just needs more half-&-half, about a cup more, and then it tastes terrific. I'd add a little bit more right before blending, and then the rest when it goes back on the stove.

Very good! I used homemade chicken broth in place of the bouillon and the white wine, and added garlic to the roux. Instead of puree-ing, I left everything intact and served as is. Will definitely use again!

I used canned salmon for this recipe and it turned out great! I can only imagine how good it would be by the original recipe.

I recently returned from upstate NY with 25 wild, chinhook salmon, so my fish was white and not pink and had a lot less fat than the farm-raised chum salmon that's usually available. Accordingly, I made a few alterations, but overall loved the recipe.  I also crisped a few slices of bacon and threw them into the food processor instead of adding salt. I used skim milk and fish stock with sherry to finish in lieu of cream, chicken bouillon and white wine.  Overall, the bisque absolutely kicked butt and everyone was mopping their bowls with bread (I may have even seen one of the women actually licking hers...)   Everyone has their own tastes, so I imagine that people will prefer their own variations and modifications, but this was a great base for a new "go-to" salmon recipe for my repertoire.  Thanks for a great recipe! Gonzo

This was delicious!  Like a previous reviewer I used chicken broth instead of whiten wine and chicken bouillon.  I also did not puree the mixture, although I think this would have been delicious.  It turned more into a salmon chowder but was very flavorful and tasty.

I was SO disappointment with this bisque - not the flavor so much as the texture! It was almost grainy in texture. I followed the recipe and pureed it thoroughly but, my husband and I both disliked it.

This is a great recipe. I did a few substitutions, as I used 2% milk instead of cream - which brought down the calories. Instead of paprika, is gave the soup a good helping of chili powder - about a full tablespoon. Even with a basic pre-packaged salmon from the grocery store, it was fantastic. Definitely a recipe to keep.

This has a good flavor, but I think port wine was the wrong choice. A nice Chardonnay would be better. Using the port wine causes the bisque to look muddy. The recipe doesn't suggest if a smoked salmon should be used, but I think it would be a suitable choice as well. I only had one serving based on the ingredients suggested so perhaps double the recipe if you want two servings.

This was a good and easy recipe, however I agree with other reviewers that this really needs more half-and-half. Also, put in moris (if not all) of the half-and-half before pureeing... it makes it WAY easier to remove it from the blender.
