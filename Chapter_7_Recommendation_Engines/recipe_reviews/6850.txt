When prepared as directed in the original recipe, I found the bread came out a little too doughy and the procedure was a bit lengthy.  However, the taste of the bread was quite good. You may prefer to use the Sweet Bread setting on your machine rather than using just the dough cycle.  Then simply add the chocolate chips at the beep, if your machine has this feature (or after the first kneading).  Worth trying again.

Just ok, nothing special.  I added more chocolate chips.  This is the second time I made it.

Fabulous!  I used soy milk instead of evaporated,  honey instead of sugar, and some whole wheat flour.  I shaped the rolled up dough in a ring, then baked.  After baking, I added a glaze of 1 T melted butter, 1 T coffee flavored liqueur, 1 T soy milk, and 1 cup powdered sugar.  Especially good when warm!

Reading the ingredients, I can see why it is called "Mocha" bread. I used the Sweet Dough setting on my bread machine as suggested by another reviewer, making the preparation quite simple. However, after tasting it, I would call it simply chocolate chip bread.
