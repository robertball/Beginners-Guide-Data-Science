This is it!  I frequent a resturant that serves pizza soup and this is the closest recipe I've found for it.  I added chopped green pepper and used pizza sausage.  I also made my own pizza sauce, using "easy pizza sauce II" (from this site).  I realize that this may be an aquired taste, but I think it's great, I can't wait to make it for my brother...he's gonna flip!  Thanks Pam!

This was very good. We did modify it based on some reviews. We added garlic & peppers, and used 1/2 the pepperoni which we cut into quarters. Next time we want to get stick pepperoni to have bigger bits in the soup. Another addition we tried was adding another cup of water and a cup of orzo, we liked the texture the pasta added. The flavor was pretty good, it does need a boost, maybe more italian seasoning next time too. We'll have it again though - it was easy & quick as well, that always helps on busy work nights :)  **UPDATE** I made this again using 1tbsp italian seasoning and cutting up a 5oz stick of pepperoni into chuncks and it made the world of difference - we all really loved it - it disappeared this time lol :)

This recipe was fantastic! Everyone loved it! I added green and red bell pepper and black olives, and I also seasoned with garlic pepper, garlic salt and basil in addition to the Italian seasoning. It had the perfect flavor and was very filling. I will definitely make this again!

Used hamburger meat instead of Italian sausage and cooked it in the slow cooker. The kids loved it. We'll be making this again soon.

Made some modifications to suit our family's tastes, added black olives, took out the mushrooms, added some green onions.  Fried up the onions with the italian sausage along with about a clove of garlic. Had to add about another cup of water and a can of tomato paste due to the increased toppings, (i used a whole  lb. of italian sausage).  Threw it all in the crock pot for about 3 hours on high.  My family was skepitcal when i said i was making pizza soup but once tasting it even the picky eaters loved it!  Definately one for the recipe books.

I've made pizza soup before & I found this recipe to guide me. I gave it 4 stars because it needs extra seasoning not provided by the recipe. I changed the water for beef stock, added garlic SALT (which I find it needs), salt, black pepper, about a tbsp of the italian seasoning & extra oregano & basil ( 1tbsp of oregano & 1tsp. of basil). I assume the lack of salt is (I didn't have the sausage) because the sausage provides it.
I had pepperoni cubes (1"x1" thick) frozen for making pizza pockets, but they ended up in the soup. The hubs prefers the peppers crunchy, so I'll add them before he goes to work so that they cook a bit when he reheats it there.
Not bad, just a bit more is needed & you have it all in your spice rack.

This is exactly what I was looking for. Tweeked it a little. Added green and red peppers, used pizza seasoning, garlic and onion diced canned tomatoes, the parmesean is critical and mozzeralla when served. Added 2 tsp jarred garlic and used 6 cups of water for a larger serving amount and adjusted the amounts for the rest of the receipe. Also added pre cooked penne pasta in the end. It was so good I made two pots back to back as my husband and I couldn't get enough. I Served with breadsticks or Italian bread is a hearty meal I will definately be making all winter. I am also giving samples to my friends and the receipe upon request.

Cooked in my Crockpot. Added green pepper, added black olive slices, left out the sausage and added macaroni noodles the last hour of cooking. Very good recipe :)

This soup is similar to one that my uncle likes to make for his kids.  He uses a couple of cans of condensed tomato instead of the pizza sauce and dilutes the concentrate with milk.  I find that if you chunck the motzarella before you stir in it won't get too stringy.  Also, serve with warm rolls, this gives it a "crust" effect.

This was great! Tasted just like pizza! I added extra ingredients: bell pepper, minced garlic (from a jar), about 1/4 c. parsley for color, and olives. Some reviews suggested red bell pepper, and I used green. I'm glad I did because it added color to an already red soup. Also, I found Owen's brand sausage has an Italian flavor variety and that was delicious. I will use that again. It turned out more like a stew than a soup. Being watery wasn't an issue at all. This was very filling and I will definitley make this again. Great recipe!

The soup was ok. But it did not taste even a little like pizza. It was way too watery. It was not red at all. I think it needed more tomato/pizza sauce.  I was very disappointed that I made it. After all the good reviews I was disappointed with it. It tasted fine, but not like pizza.

My fiance and I love this! I made it for Valentine's Day and sent the rest with my mom and her husband ate all of it in one night after having already eaten supper. He goes on and on about it all the time. Highly recommended.

Easy to make and had the ingredients on hand. My husband was skeptical when I told him what I was making but after trying it he said it did taste like pizza soup. Will make it again but will make some changes - too much pepperoni, will add more meat (hamburg and sausage) and veggies to offset the pepperoni. Flavor was good.

My kids especially enjoyed making this soup and liked getting to choose and add the "PIZZA" ingredients.  They told the neighbor kid about it who has now requested the recipe!

This soup was very good. I only rated it 4 stars since I added more to it based on the advice of other users. We are watching our weight so I used turkey pepperoni and italian-seasoned ground turkey. I also added red pepper, green pepper and garlic. After pouring soup into bowls, I topped it off with some garlic croutons and parmesan cheese. Very goood!

This was extremely easy to make. I used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of fresh though. I also froze the left overs and on another night used it as a sauce on some penne pasta for a quick delicious meal.

I made this recipe last week and thought it was fantastic!  It tastes exactly like pizza, but soup.  I added a few extra veggies that we normally put on our pizza and I think you can probably be as liberal as you want in terms of that. I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of cutting my own, which was just as good, if not better.  I saw that someone characterized this soup as watery, but I did not have any issues with that.  I didn't think it was watery in the least, which was my only concern. Very yummy for pizza lovers... will be making it again soon!

It didn't turn out how I expected it to. There was WAY too much pepperoni in it and that made it a little too greasy. Also, there was not enough liquid in it to call it "soup". I wouldn't make it again, but if you are planning on it, I would suggest adding more liquid and less pepperoni.

I'm basing the amount of stars on the recipe AS IS.  The flavor is there and it does come out thick.   The following are the changes I made and in my humble opinion, make the soup a 5 star. 
1)  Use 2 cans of plain tomato soup as a stock.
2)  Add shredded Asiago to the list and mix with mozzarella.  Add some garlic (non salted) powder with the cheese, do this by taste so you know it tastes right and will not blow out anyone's pallet . Set aside.
3) Roast 2 bell peppers on an open flame but watch so they don't have a heavy charring.  Slice into strips and add to the soup.
4) Create or purchase bread bowls
Once you have this done and the soup is ready to serve, cut out the center of the bread bowl, leaving a thicker allowance at the bottom so the soup does not leak.   Cover the top of the soup and the top of the bread bowl with the cheese mix.
Place oven on broil and when the cheese melts and slightly browns (think baked onion soup brown).   Remove and serve .If you like my version, please leave me a message.  Thanks!

I used Bilinski's Mild Italian Chicken Sausage this time. It has less fat than the sausage I used the first time. Totally amazing flavor!

Good pizza flavour. I used salami instead of pepperoni, green bell pepper instead of Italian sausage, beef broth instead of water and I added a small can of diced tomatoes and some sliced black olives.

I just finished eating a bowl of this pizza soup and the pot is calling me to eat more. However, I made several adjustments to it. I used ground pork instead of Italian sausage and I did not use pepperoni.  I used chicken broth instead of water and added enough to make it more soup like.  I added 4 big cloves of garlic, chopped and 2 tablespoons of freshly dried oregano and basil. Then topped it with crumpled, crispy bacon, parm cheese, black olives and purple onions.  Outstanding!

i didn't even know pizza soup existed, i wish i would have known this years ago, my husband could eat pizza every day of the week, this was one of the best soups we've ever eaten. I added more of the italian sausage than the recipe called for. Next time the only thing i wold change is to double the recipe and add black olives!
