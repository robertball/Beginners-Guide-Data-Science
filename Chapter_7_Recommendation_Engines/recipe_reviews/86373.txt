I can't believe that this recipe isn't used OVER something like a pasta.  It's SO rich.

I made it exactly according to the recipe: but was using it as a sauce for linguine, and it was STILL too rich.  I like the flavours, but I feel they need to be spread out a bit more than this recipe allows.  I would say this recipe feeds 8, with pasta, at least.    I would also use the veg oil instead of peanut oil:  peanut oil adds too much extra flavouring...

I hate mushrooms but made this for hubby as a treat with his steak. I used red wine and a beef bouillion cube and omitted the cornstarch as I had to leave this on the stove a bit longer due to the steaks finishing cooking than the recipe called for. Thanks for the post.

Nice recipe, however, I used marsala wine with this. I was just getting ready to add the cornstarch when I opted not to. It looked wonderful the way it was and my family loved it. Thanks!

As written, just average.  Very good, however, after tinkering with the recipe. I used olive oil and a little butter rather than peanut or vegetable oil.  NO water - I wanted sauteed mushrooms, not boiled; and no cornstarch.  Loved the flavor of the basil with this.

So I didn't have an onion and used a green onion, didn't have cornstarch and used flour, don't use chicken anything so I eliminated bouillon...needless to say it was awesome.  I used it on top of horseradish mashed potatoes.

This was a great side dish with our London broil tonight. Sliced up a red onion instead of using diced. Used red wine instead of white since I was serving red meat and didn't want to open another bottle. Also, didn't add the cornstarch because it wasn't necessary.

We loved this recipe.  I also omitted the flour, the thickness after simmering was just perfect.

Yummy base recipe for white mushroom sauce. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great... it was maybe a little thick so might cut back or omit the cornstarch next time. I think it would also be good with red wine and beef bouillon if you wanted to use it with red meats.

This is very good, but quite rich for a side dish.  I poured it over some almond-crusted chicken and brown rice, which was delicious.  I used dry sherry wine and added a splash of heavy cream for a creamier color/texture.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this recipe to be used as a gravy/sauce, but not to be eaten as a side-dish.

I used a good red wine with a solid pucker factor with olive oil and butter and replaced the Basil with dried Rosemary, no corn starch and let them simmer for a bit to reduce down.

excellent recipe. just a little salty, and absolutely no need for the cornstarch. like another review, I think it would also be great to substitute beef bouillon and red wine.

I use vegetable oil and not nearly as much as was called for didn't need it and I didn't want this to turn out greasy.   Instead of water I used beef broth because I had some if I had had chicken broth opened I would have used that instead of the water and chicken bouillon cube.  Didn't used the cornstarch  didn't need it.  Thanks for sharing.

What's not to love? I did leave out the bouillon to let the wine - a nice Kendall-Jackson chardonnay- take more of a leading role.  To the person who found this a bit rich... it could've been the sherry and heavy cream you added, though not called for at all in the recipe.

This mushroom sauce can be used with anything! I've had it with a simple grilled chicken breast or baked cod/ tilapia filet, over various pastas, and also as a baked potato topping (add a little grated cheese). I use white wine or marsala wine (whatever I have on hand). If I have some cream or half and half in the fridge, I add a splash of that, but it's still great without. Definitely use fresh garlic - garlic powder just doesn't work as well. Delicious and versatile. Thanks so much!

Awesome flavor. The wife is a picky eater and she loved it. I left out the cornstarch and just reduced the liquid down in the pan. All in all we were very happy with the result.

Very good and easy recipe. I made this for an impromptu dinner as a pasta sauce (over Granoro Italian pasta) with a friend and it is definitely a pleaser. Some changes I made: 1)Used Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and  2)substituted fresh with bottled crushed garlic.

Absolutely amazing.   Made this with a portabella mushroom we received in our food co-op and served over a grilled steak, yum!  I only used 1/2 c of water and added a Tbsp of butter and let it reduce down a lot.

So, I wanted something with cream added. I used a bit of cream of mushroom to the finished product and it was pretty good. Only suggestion is to let it cook more than just heat through because I could tell it was a canned soup added (although no one else could).

I used this for a sauce over penne pasta.  Used a vegetable bouillon as I'm vegetarian.  Added steamed broccoli & peas to the pasta.  Viola, dinner! Really delicious!

After we made the mushrooms my daughter felt it would be better over something insteada of as a side so I put it over a fish and cooked it alittle more. It was delicious! Thanks, I've been looking for a good mushroom sauce (even tough that wasn't the intention here.

Extremely easy, tasted and looked fancy. I used chicken broth instead of water and didn't use the chicken bullion. Also, I added a few hand-fulls of fresh spinach as this simmered, which looked nice and added a little color to the presentation. This can be even more gourmet with shallots instead of regular onions. Good over steak, chicken and even just plain egg noodles.

this was soo good, i didn't use the cornstarch, i just cooked the sauce at a low temperature while i was making the rest of the meal.  I added a dab of butter for more flavor and used about a tablespoon of chicken broth instead of the bouillon cube (i only made 2 servings, not the 6 servings that the recipe calls for).  Then i cooked spaghetti noodles and topped it with the mushrooms in white wine sauce.  This was a great side dish to my tilapia marinated in white wine with parmesan cheese and garlic. yum!

thought 1/4 cup oil would be complete overload so substituted 1 T butter instead  -  used as a sauce over pasta with a parmesan cheese topping  -  was okay but not fantastic

this recipe was de-LISH!!! instead of dry wine i used pinot grigio...a bit more than what was called for.  in addition, i used flour instead of cornstarch with a pinch of lemon.  i poured it over breaded chicken cutlets and a family recipe of the left over breadcrumbs, eggs and garlic from the breading of the cutlets.  really, this recipe was easy to make and pleasantly wonderful!!!

Simple.  I like it.  I used asaparagus though instead of mushrooms since I didn't have any fresh ones (and I refuse to use anything canned in sauces!) and it still tasted great.  Served on top of fusilli.

I've been making this low carb staple for years using sherry and a little sour cream. It's wonderful alone, on a baked potato and once I broiled it with guyere cheese on the top. Very versatile. I can't imagine anyone calling it 'rich', I don't use corn starch though,maybe that's why some called it rich.

Very tasty sauce! I used butter instead of oil and added a bit of  dried thyme. Since I used salted butter I did not add any salt. I actually let it simmer on the stove for about an hour and seasoned to taste.

Very tasty!  I scaled it down for the two of us, and inverted the proportions of water/wine.  Also used butter instead of oil, and reduced that amount quite a bit.  Slow-cooked the onions and mushrooms then removed from the pan.  Added a tiny bit more butter, sprinkled about 1.5 T flour and "toasted" this before adding the wine and broth.  I always use seasonings I like, sometimes different from the recipe.  I'm 66, and I know what I like.   :)  Threw in a tiny bit of Worcester and Dijon and tinier bit of honey, added back the seasoned onions and mushrooms; melded well.  Slow simmer, didn't need the cornstarch.  Made this to sauce crispy eggplant slices (1" thick) which were warming in the oven - nice and creamy inside, crunchy outside.  Salmon, salad, made a really good meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

I wanted to make chicken Marsala from this site but only had white wine on hand, so i used this recipe for my sauce and kept it warm on the side while i prepared my chicken per the Marsala recipe and simmered the chicken in the 'sauce' for about 10 minutes. I was very good and thick and rich and actually prefer it to the sauce in the Marsala recipe. I have to start to remember to take pictures! Made this with Cesar salad and crock pot mashed potatoes from this site. The response I got from hubby was "Oh My God....babe!!!!"  Definitely not a side dish, used over chicken or pasta.

Awesome! I did cut back on the cornstarch.  Poured over lemon chicken and side of rice. Absolutely yummy!

I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and left out the water and cornstarch.  I also used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter and it was wonderful.  I wanted sauted mushrooms to go with a steak and it was the perfect side dish.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday steak. Very easy to make. Accomodates variances, such as I did not add white wine, but added 1/4 cup tequila and 2 T Worchestire. Great basic recipe.

This is incredibly tasty. Made a few changes. Didn't use any water. Doubled the basil. And replaced the cornstarch with quarter teaspoon of arrow root  powder. Absolutely divine!

I used olive oil instead of peanut oil and used more onion than it called for.   I did thicken it with cornstarch and served it over grilled pork chops.  It was awesome and my husband loved it.

It was alright, I would make it again. It definately had a seafoodish taste to it, maybe because of the white wine and garlic? Lots and lots of cheese make this dish tasty.

I was looking for something easy to cook on a Friday after a long week of work. This was good with pasta. I added a little slice of lemon on the top as a finishing touch.
