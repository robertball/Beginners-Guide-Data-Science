This is a very good recipe. Quick and easy to make when you don't feel like cooking or don't have much time to make dinner. I did think the seasoning needed a little bit of jazzing up, so I added a sprinkling of sugar and a few twists of lemon.

YUMM!! This was great- didn't have Teriyaki sauce so doubled the SOY  sauce.  This had a KICK.  VERY good.  served over white rice. We even used canned baking poppy seeds! :)

This is pretty good, nothing spectacular but a very decent stir fry. I used less black pepper in the sauce and had to omit the poppy seeds as I didn't have any but I added some chopped pecans, I like nuts in stir fry. I thought it could have used more sauce but I did use more chicken than stated; still I think making 1.5 times the sauce would be good. Instead of a bag of veggies, I used broccoli florets, snow peas and red bell pepper strips.
