I made this in the microwave, it came out perfect ! I just got all my ingredients hot first in the microwave, approx 1 1/2 minutes, kept stirring in .30 minute intervals, then beat my eggs in a separate bowl and slowly added the hot mixture while stirring the eggs, , keeps the eggs from cooking into scrambled eggs !! Once i had it all added together popped it back into the microwave and kept cooking in .30 minute intervals until it was creamy and thick , : )

I doubled this and used store-bought lemon juice as opposed to freshly squeezed lemons and it was fabulous (and so darn easy!).

Good, reliable "go-to" recipe for lemon curd.  Just right sweet, just right tart, buttery smooth and creamy. I like mine particularly lemony so I increased the lemon zest to a full tablesoon.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and ended up with a delicious pint of lemon curd. Be sure to use real lemon juice and the zest from that lemon. One large lemon should be enough. Others say that it could be done in a microwave, which is probably true, but you would need to be very patient to stop and stir often to avoid having the mixture curdle. (I speak from experience, having curdled a batch of custard before.) Over a double boiler, you'll end up with perfect lemon curd without worrying about curdled eggs. I'll be using this lemon curd in the morning for my crepes. Can't wait.

This is the best lemon curd! Tastes fresh and tangy. When I want a more toned down flavor, I will make a batch of pastry cream (exact  name on all recipes) and mix the 2. Its amazing!

I just made this.  I only had 1/4 cup of lemon juice, so I just adjusted down to compensate.  3/4 cup sugar and 2 eggs and 2-3 tablespoons of butter.  I will add the zest tomorrow since I don't have a lemon at the moment.  It tastes awesome.  It took considerably longer than 10 minutes before it thickened.  The reason why some people never get it to thicken is because of their stove and the type of bowl they used.  Many glass bowls take a lot longer to heat up than the metal does due to the thickness of most Pyrex mixing bowls.  I ended up putting mine on 4 instead of 2(where it says simmer on the stove) and whisking it constantly.  I ended up with not a single lump.  It couldn't of came out better.

I used this between the layers and over the top of a simple yellow layer cake, and stacked a bunch of blackberries on top of the whole thing.  It was the perfect amount of zing and a lovely consistency... adding just a little more moisture to the cake.

I made this pretty close to as written.  I used a steel bowl and an oven mitt over a stock pot, and skipped the straining part.  This is a great staple recipe to have on hand.

The taste is excellent and it was so easy to make. However, I stirred it on the double boiler for 20 minutes and it didn't thicken at all. No problem, I just put it in a pot over the direct heat, stirred it vigorously and it thickened right up. Also I used a metal whisk (because I didn't read the authors note until I was done cooking), and there is no metallic taste.

I used meyer lemons which gave it less of a tang.  I like it but prefer the tang.  Gave it 5 stars because with regular lemons it would be that for me!  Turned out great.  If your still having runny curd after 20 minutes of stirring your heat may not be high enough.  It should thicken with the eggs.

Ww stirred for 20 minutes and it never thickened enough.  Chilling didn't help.  So we have oversweet, runny lemon sauce with lumps of butter in it.  Very disappointing.

This is my go to recipe for lemon curd. Over the last several years I have hooked all my friends and relatives on it and gift it for most holidays and birthdays by doubling or tripling the batch. I often make this and add a spoonful to prebaked philo cups then top with blueberries for a top notch potluck contribution as well.

This is my "go to" lemon curd for cake filling. It is most popular flavor after strawberry.  It's easy and nearly fool proof. I had trouble getting it to thicken once (thus the 4 stars). It was probably my error somehow. I'm very happy with it

This was good and really easy to make. It didn't turn out quite as thick as I would have hoped but will work fine for my needs. It's quite sweet - not in a bad way, I love sweet, but when I make lemon-something, I want a bit more tang. I could eat this as a sweet pudding by itself, but I made it to use as a layer in a ricotta-cream 'cake' with lady fingers, and would have liked more tang for this purposes. Still, it's good, no real complaints and I'd probably make again reducing the sugar a little, or upping the lemon zest.

I fell in love with Lemon Curd when my daughter took me to a tea when I visited her in Hawaii. It was the first time I had Lemon Curd and it was wonderful. This recipe is just as wonderful. I just finished making it and it is very easy to make. I did add very slightly over the amount of lemon juice and it took about 15 min to thicken. Also, I only added 1 teaspoon of zest because I decided I wanted it to stay on the creamy side. I will definitely make this again. I guess now I have to make scones to go with it :)

This is a great recipe for lemon curd, although I increased the lemon zest in mine because I like it extra tart. As I was reading the reviews, I started laughing when I read the review written by luv2cook. I wondered if this reviewer is my twin. Everything s/he said is spot on, and I had planned to say the same things. By all means, please use fresh lemon juice! It's fresher than bottled, it tastes so much better, AND it's cheaper than buying a bottle (or a plastic filled lemon). It's also not really hard to squeeze fresh juice from the lemons. Finally, the zest is really important, so unless you omit it you need fresh lemons. (The essential oils in the zest add a ton of flavor.) Bottom line--lemons are the star of this recipe, so use the best ingredients possible. 

Likewise, I would caution against using the microwave for this. While it can work, it is very easy to overshoot it and end up with lemony scrambled eggs. There's a very good reason that virtually no curd (or custard) recipe calls for using the microwave. I actually get nervous when I see recipes that instruct one to cook curd/custard directly in a saucepan. Using a saucepan is less risky than the microwave, but I always take the precaution of using a double boiler. No need for special equipment here--a heat proof bowl on top of a saucepan with simmering water works perfectly (make sure the water is low enough not to touch the bottom of the bowl). Yes, this takes a bit longer (but not much), but curds are intended

We have a Meyer lemon tree in the yard, huge & productive. I had thought for a while about making curd but never did til this year. I looked at a few lemon curd recipes but settled on this one as it used fewer eggs than some others, and used both yolks & whites, and I didn't want to keep the whites around. We try to cut down sugar in our cooking, and so I used 1/2 cup agave syrup and 1/2 cup simple syrup I made the week before (1 part white sugar & one part water, boiled). It was still a little on the sweet side for me so I added more lemon juice until I liked it, which ended up being double the recipe, about 2/3 cup. I don't squeeze the juice but cut the lemon in sections (most are large so not too hard) and blend it in a small processor. Whisked over the simmering waterper the instructions and it came out super creamy and exactly a pint. Our kids love it, spread it on toast with cream cheese, yum!

I followed the recipe exactly, using a mixing bowl over a pot of simmering water, whisking constantly. It came out completely smooth with no need to sieve. I used it as filling in puff pastry tartlets, and also on scones. Sweet and tart. I will be making it again!

This is a good recipe, which can be even easier done in the microwave.  The secret to not having to strain after cooking is to cream butter and sugar, then add the eggs and zest and lastly the lemon juice.  Then put the whole mixture into the microwave for 1 min, stir, then 45 sec, stir, 35 sec, stir etc until looking like it is starting to set.  I do it one more time for 25 sec in my microwave.  It is perfect every time with no egg bits to strain out.  Pour into your jar/container and let cool then refrigerate.  No metal tools used except beaters when creaming butter, sugar and eggs  I havevalso  cut back on sugar for a lower calorie version using 1/2 c  sugar and 6 packtets of splenda.  Other sweetener could be used as per your personal taste.

I made this as the filling between 2 layers of the made from scratch lemon cake.  The curd was so smooth and delicious I wanted to eat it out of the pot instead of using it for the cake!

Perfect method and lovely color.  Cooking time for a thick product is longer than indicated.  Lost one star as I think it's a bit too sweet.  Next time I will reduce the sugar by 1/4 c.  Also was a little "loose" even with the extra cooking time so I'll also add an additional tablespoon of butter for help tighten it up.  I topped a spring cheesecake with this and fresh blueberries.  Family loved it.

Easy recipe if you just follow the instructions as is. Tartness depends on your lemons so let tase be your guide. I like to mince the lemon zest finely to impart flavor without too much texture.

THis turned out well but it did take nearly 30 minutes to reach 170’F, after the first 15 minutes I started  increasing  the heat from Lo to 2, then 3, then 4, and finally the temp climbed and thickening happened exactly at the recommended temp.  It was just the right balance of tart and sweet and just nicely lemony.

This recipe came out perfectly with a tartness to it as I also added extra lemon zest.  It never lasts long in my house when my sons come home!

I made this as a filling for macarons, and it turned out great. We used bottled lemon juice and McCormick California Lemon Peel instead of fresh (in my defense, it was a last-minute snow-day project, and I was working with what I had). It turned out really well, although it would have been better with fresh juice and zest.

For all you high altitude cooks, my experience with this was that it needed some direct heat at the end to get it to thicken up.  I moved it from the double boiler pan to a small sauce pan and within about 5 minutes it was nice and thick.  It is delicious and I will serve it with scones tomorrow morning.

Love this recipe. I changed it slightly. I combined all ingredients except the butter, stirred it well to melt the sugar and then placed over my double boiler. Once it thickens then I added my butter. I did not need to strain. No lumps at all! This is sooooo smooth and tasty

Excellent recipe. Nice and tart and delicious. Just right for my lemon merengue pie. All I did differently was reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup. I'm trying to reduce the evil sugar from our diets. It was still sweet tart and tasty. Excess sugar is becoming quite a problem in the US. I bake a lot and Im finding that by reducing sugar by half or one third in all my baking results in a still tasty and quite sweet enough dessert. And i love sweets. Try it. You'll see what I mean

The recipe was very easy to follow. I rated it as a 3 only because I was expecting a little more tart flavor.  I only had salted butter on hand so I substituted that for unsalted.  If I were to make it again I would use unsalted.

This is the third year I've made this. I have to put it in pint jars because I have NO control over myself and eat ALL in front of me. Delicious!  Easy to make. I melt the butter and mix with sugar and lemon zest and then add the whisked eggs and have no problem with curdling. My girlfriend has just informed me that you can freeze this too!  She say it comes out like a sorbet eliminating the need to defrost.   Yum. I will make another batch with my beautiful eureka lemons.

Very tasty! I followed the directions, but it didn't thicken. I placed it back in the saucepan on direct heat stirring constantly and that worked. Next time, I'll make sure the mixture bubbles for the time directed for the double boiler. I used it between layers of the Lemon Cake from Scratch, with Real Strawberry frosting.

This recipe is very simple and has a delicious outcome.
If you don't want to wait four hours for the curd to set place it in an ice bath for ten to fifteen minutes. It won't be as thickly set but if your on a time crunch it saves a lot of time. Thank you for this recipe. Happy Baking!

Amazing.  Thought it might be too sweet but was just perfect.  Be sure the roll your lemon over countertop before extracting the juice - makes a big difference.

Delicious! My family loved this recipe. Suggestion, make sure your lemon & eggs come to almost a boil when cooking them in a double boiler. If the mixture does not get hot enough, the lemon curd will not set. It will be runny. You must bring the lemon & egg mixture to a small boil for about 4 or 5 min. Delicious! Oh, I also used double the the fresh lemon juice.

So easy!  I used 3 lemons as they were small, 2 whole eggs and no lemon zest.  Stirred the whole time it was on the stove - no double boiler - and it turned out better than store bought - lots fresher and cheaper.  Keeper for sure since I use it in many recipes.  Thanx for the recipe!

We loved it!  I folded in whipped cream at the end and served it over strawberry and biscuits.  I used 2 lemons and some bottled juice the first time, and it was perfect.  The second time, I only used 2 lemons, and it was not flavorful enough, so make sure you use enough lemon juice for full flavor.

I used this for a version of lemon meringue pie, and I added some vanilla bean paste to it. It was a little runny when I was preparing it so I was a little worried but it set up just fine. I piped meringue cookies and filled them with it.

This was yummy and easy! Really sweet though... I wonder if it would be possible to cut the sugar? I used half this recipe to fold into a lemon mousse. The recipe almost makes 2 cups.

I made this this afternoon, but since I do not have a double boiler nor any way to rig one up, I just did it on direct but low flame. I whisked it steadily for about 10 minutes over the heat and it was barely any thicker than when I started but it had thickened a bit. I poured it into a container and stuck it in the fridge. 2 hours later it was like a slightly thin jelly, so it is setting up thicker, but taking its sweet time. Flavor is fantastic though and will make this again for sure. I am curious to know how this would be with slightly less sugar- its super sweet as it is.

i used the microwave, stirring every 5 or 10 seconds. It came out great. It thickened right about 180 degrees.
I like to stir it into plain yogurt.

Was looking for a guideline for citrus curd.  This worked well and as expected from making lemon curd in the past.  Easy to make, plus uses the whole egg, which is great.  I used a mixture of lemon, lime, and orange juice and zest.  Very colorful. Tasted great.

Wow!  This was absolutely great!  The fresh lemon I used didn't have enough juice so I added bottled to make the difference.  It turned out great!  All else fails, always use homemade rather than store bought.  We have 3 stores in town that could have had Lemon Curd - 2 stores were out and the third store had 2 jars - "Best if Used By Dates" were 2/2013 and 9/2012-no thanks!

I was a little nervous as I whisked the ingredients because it didn't seem to thicken up, but as it cooled it was thick and smooth. I did not use a sieve. I served this in between two cake rounds and drizzled it on top of the cake as well. It was a hit.

I loved this.  I use it to fill my vanilla pound cake cupcakes.
Because I use it in cupcakes and they have a vanilla butter cream icing I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup to off set the sweetness. My kids and husband love it as well...next big test will be to serve it to my Grandma and see what she thinks. ;-)

My neighbor gave me two giant bags of lemons, so I figured I'd best get cooking...I found this recipe and made it for the first time earlier this evening.  I followed it exactly and ended up with gorgeous, creamy, delicious lemon curd!  Sweet, tangy, and smooth...I cooked it for the full 10 minutes on the double boiler, and used 1/4 cup fresh butter (from the farmer's market).  I put the curd in 4oz jars so I can share it...can't wait to say thanks to my neighbor!

Perfect and used the microwave as recommended. That was easy, less clean up. Thanks!
