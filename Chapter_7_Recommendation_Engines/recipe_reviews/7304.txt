My Family has been making this for years and years. One way to avoid having to refridgerate it over night is to lay each side of the graham cracker squares in milk for a few seconds until slightly soft, right before laying them on the cake. This keeps them moist and it's ready to serve right then. We used our own topping instead of the frosting: 3T Butter, 3T. Hot water, 3T Cocoa powder and about 1 and 1/2 cup powdered sugar (to desired thickness)Just pour over the top. This creates a thin layer of chocolate and makes it much more elegant in my opinion!

I'm giving this 4 stars b/c I thought it was ok, but my guests loved it.  I had a version of this before that was absolutely delicious, but I don't think this recipe was as good.  Part of it may be that it was barely fridged for 4 hours, so possibly if it had "sat" longer, it would've tasted better.  I also used cinnamon graham crackers b/c that's all I had, and I personally didn't like the cinnamon flavor in the cake, but other people thought it was a great touch.  I think some great variations would be to make it like tiramisu with some coffee flavoring, b/c overall it just tasted plain to me - sweet - but plain in flavor.  The version I had eaten before had vanilla and chocolate layers.  I may try that next time, maybe even add some coffee into the mix.
UPDATE:
I made a variation with chocolate graham crackers and Fat/sugar free cheesecake pudding w/ dark chocolate frosting.  It was REALLY good.  The tip to heat up the frosting is a must since it's SO much easier that way and you end up getting a nice smooth, shiny coating just like an eclair.  Also, I would recommend making this in a big rectangular tupperware so that you can just snap the lid on top.  I kept finding my saran wrap would "suction" itself to my frosting when I made it in a pan and not look as pretty.  It's also essential to let the cake sit for at least overnight.  This version sat for 2 days and the texture was just WAY better than the first one I made which barely sat for 4 hours as the recipe stated.

This dessert is awesome.  I took the advice on another review and put the frosting in the microwave for 30 sec and just poured it over the top.  Very delicious.

Anything this GOOD, easy, quick & inexpensive to make must be a sin!!!  The only thing I changed was I made homemade milk choc. frosting.  Will be making again!!!

Made again, but in  alOW FAT version using low fat grahm crackers, sugar free pudding, fat free cool whip, 2 Cups instead of  3 of skim milk & drizzled sugar free chocolate syrup for frosting.  Still very good & great for people watching their weigh or diebetics

Wow, this is so sinfully delicious!  This was my second time making it, and I'm glad I did because the first one I made was not that great.  My family and I thought the store-bought frosting I put on the first one was way too sweet, as well as way too much.  Also, I used cheesecake flavored pudding on the first one and we didn't really care for that flavor either.  This time I decided to use the vanilla flavor pudding (as per recipe) and make a chocolate ganache for the topping.  OMG heaven!!  I made it the night before to allow the flavors to set and took it to a potluck at work.  Everyone was fighting over the leftovers & they all wanted the recipe.  I cannot begin to describe how delicious this is for such a simple dessert (took less than 10 minutes to put together).  I think the ganache is what really made the difference this time.  (2/3 cup heavy whipping cream brought just to a boil, then pour over 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips...I used Ghirardelli, whisk until smooth and pour over cake.  Then allow to refrigerate overnight to set.)  You have to try this recipe...trust me, you won't be disappointed!

This is wonderful. Took it to a knitting club and they loved it. I did make some changes. You can lighten it up. As some of the others suggest. I did do one vanilla and one cheesecake sugar and fat free pudding. I also used 1/2 can of Betty Crocker triple fudge and chocolate chip frosting. And I heated like they suggested in microwave. Had only a thin layer of chocolate. Wonderful. Thank you so much.

Eclair cake is the best.  I use my own home made frosting, better than anything out of a can.  We also let it sit over night.  It is better when the graham crackers get soft.

This recipe is an old favorite, so easy. The only thing I would suggust is to try dipping the graham crackers in amaretto liqueur. Helps soften  crackers and cuts down on required waiting. Taste good too!

I'm not sure that this tasted anything like an eclair, but it was simple to make. In no time at all I had a dish prepared for a last minute neighborhood BBQ. It was one of the first desserts gone, so I guess they enjoyed it. I guess I'm not much of a coolwhip/pudding dessert fan. Thanks anyway Cathy.

Although this is not a gourmet dessert, it gets 5 stars because it's so easy, tasty and a real crowd pleaser. I followed some other reviewers' advice: Used French vanilla pudding to make cake and put in the fridge for a few hours prior to adding topping.  Then made a simple ganache using 2/3 cup heavy cream and 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Don't be afraid of the word "ganache"---just let heavy cream come to a boil and then pour over chips in bowl. Let sit for one minute and stir until smooth.  Cool slightly and pour over cake.  It will seem liquidity but thickens nicely after refrigerating overnight. Really very little work and a huge improvement over store bought frosting.  And definitely refrigerate overnight---4 hours does not allow enough time for crackers to soften and flavors to meld.  Also, it's easy to cut and presents nicely when it's made well in advance.

I LOVE this recipe! (and so does everyone I make it for!) I would absolutely suggest not using a can of frosting, but doing 3T butter, 3T cocoa powder and 2C powdered sugar instead for the topping.

this is always an easy go-to dessert I've been making for years.  Only difference is I add sliced banana on bottom layer and when I can find it, substitute banana cream pudding for vanilla pudding mix.

I love homemade whipped cream and frosting so much more than the store bought kind, so I made the recipe a little more complicated.  I used non-fat milk, homemade whipped cream, and I made ganache for the frosting which I spooned over the cake before the ganache got a chance to harden.  I mashed up the graham crackers and added melted butter to form a crust just because I like graham cracker crust more than graham crackers.  For the second and third graham cracker layers I just sprinkled the graham cracker and butter crumbles.  The cake is delicious after a few hours of chilling (we couldn't wait till the next day) but it doesn't hold together well until a full night in the fridge.  I read the recipe wrong and only put in 1 box of pudding mix and so it was a little thin.  But sooo fab!  Thanks for the great idea! :)(For the ganache I whisked in about 9 oz of Nestle Toll House mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to 1 cup of gently boiling heavy whipping cream but I had way too much frosting left over, so next time I'll reduce it or make something else to put the frosting on.)

I've made this for both home and office parties and everyone loves it.  However the "ready" time is far too short.

1.  If using a disposable cake pan you will need more than 1 box of graham crackers.  It will take about 1 more package of crackers.
 
2.  Because the pudding mixture thickens so very quickly, open the graham crackers packages and put on a tray, etc so you can quickly grab and place them.  If you don't, by the time you get to the second layer the pudding mix will be difficult to pour.
 
3.  Using a wisk, quickly mix the pudding and milk for a few seconds and then add the cool whip continuing to mix.  Make sure the cool whip is completely mixed in.  
 
4.  Microwave the icing (I use Betty Crocker creamy chocolate) for about 30 seconds, stir and then pour over the top layer of crackers.

5.  Give the graham crackers time to soften.  If making for lunch or dinner, make cake the night before.
 
I haven't tried it yet but was thinking that this might be good with a chocolate pudding/cool whip mixture for the filling with vanilla icing as the topping.

I love cooking with my young granddaughter (9) and this is one of her favorites.  We add a package of softened cream cheese to the filling for a really rich flavor.  This is a hit at pot lucks, bible studies, and church functions.

This is a really good and very easy cake to make.  Although I'm a chocolate lover, I hesitated to make something with store bought chocolate frosting.  So instead, I made ganache in place of it.  2 cups ghiradelli dark choc chips melted with 1/2 c heavy cream.  My 9 year old daughter made the rest of the cake exactly as the recipe called for.  It was a huge hit at our Christmas dinner, everyone raved.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  It has already been requested for next Christmas!

I made this to use up graham crackers and pudding mix I had on hand.  It was so easy and so delicious.  I made my own chocolate glaze for the top (3 tbsp cocoa, 3 tbsp melted butter, 3 tbsp milk, enough powdered sugar to make pouring consistency) and it turned out great.  This will be something I will take to potlucks in the summer months definitely.

This is an awesome and easy recipe, and as Cathy said, it's great for kids to make. The only thing I do differently is I use French Vanilla pudding mix, instead of regular vanilla...this gives it a more "custard" taste.

I have to bake the desserts at least twice a month for my local VFW where we serve dinners every Saturday. I made this and followed some of the reviews that said to soak graham crackers in milk first. I was glad I did this. Also used French Vanilla pudding and did use prepared frosting. I did make it the day before and refrigerated it over night. This was so easy to make and I got rave reviews from everyone. It was awesome. Everyone loved it, even those that don't like sweets ate it and they loved it also. It held together great and wasn't soupy at all because I made the pudding first before adding the whipped topping as someone suggested. I will make this again many times since they all loved it so much. Because of the number of people who have dinner, I made 2 batches and both came out perfect.  I will definitely make this again and next time I will make one to keep at home. It was so easy to make. Thank you to the person who submitted this recipe. It is a keeper!!!!

Needed a recipe for a dessert I could make the night before a family reunion and decided to try this one.  I'm glad I did!  SO easy and relatively inexpensive!  This dessert got many compliments and I had to share the recipe, of course.  The only thing I changed was that I made my own ganache topping (1 cup heavy cream heated just to boiling and poured over 9 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips, whisk to melt) instead of using store-bought chocolate frosting.  It made for a much richer chocolate topping and set up wonderfully.  This will probably be my go-to dessert for family gatherings now!

Yummy!!  This was excellent.  It really tasted just like an eclair.  I couldn't bring myself to use store bought icing so I made a chocolate butter cream.  Everyone loved it.  It doesn't get much easier!!  Enjoy!!!

So easy to make, a friend made this for a party and everyone loved it so now I make it, and its easy to make and take.  However, instead of the canned icing she made ganache and I prefer it that way.   I cup of cream brought almost to a boil, pour it over 1 cup of bittersweet chocolate that has been chopped and allow it to soften for a minute, then whisk.  Let it set 10 minutes to cool and thicken, then pour it over.  See Eclair Cake with Chocolate Ganache on this site for the Ganache recipe if needed.

i have made this for years.  Everyone asks me to bring it at holiday time. French vanilla pudding tastes the best. Definitely let it set over night before eating.  It is so much better after it has settled. My family and friends Love It!

This is SO good. I used French Vanilla pudding as some others suggested. I also microwaved the frosting (about 30 sec) to make spreading easier and sprinkled chopped pecans on top. YUM! Everyone loved it and had seconds. Super easy and I LOVED that it only had a few ingredients.

This dessert was too easy to taste as good as it did! I took the advice of some other posters and used cinnamon graham crackers, and I heated the frosting in the mocrowave for 30 seconds. It was the perfect pouring/speading consisency. I got so many compliments on this dish. It will be one of my "go-to" dishes from now on.

This is exactly like the Eclair Dessert that was served at a Deli by my house when I was younger. I'm glad to have found the recipe. Thank you.

I was pleasantly surprised to see this recipe here! My aunt made this cake at a family get-together about 7 years ago, and I have made it many times since. It is always a hit and completely disappears! However, our family's recipe doesn't call for the third cup of milk, only the 2 cups needed to prepare the instant pudding according to the pudding box directions. I might try it with the third cup.   Also, the chocolate frosting spreads easier if you microwave the container for 30-45 seconds (be sure to remove the aluminum film from the container entirely, because you don't want metal sparking in the microwave). Then stir the frosting with a spoon or knife, pour it over the pie, and spread. Then I refrigerate it at least 4 hours, but really this dish is best the 2nd and 3rd days, if it lasts that long!

7/31/11 Easy to make.  Soaked graham crackers in milk to make sure it'll be ready in 4 hours.  Used dark chocolate frosting.  Pretty good, but probably won't make again.

I've been making this dessert for at least 10 years and it's always a huge success.  My recipe is a tiny bit different..  I use French vanilla pudding and add 1 t. of vanilla to the filling.  If you use canned frosting that you nuke slightly it is much easier to frost.  And it is absolutely necessary to refrigerate overnight if you want good results.  For special occasions I make a HUGE cream puff with a hole in the center.  I cut it in half horizontally and then add the filling.  I believe that's where the name came from as the original recipe did call for a cream puff instead of graham crackers.  Made this way it would look more like an éclair and knocks people off their feet!

This was phenomenally easy to make! My 7 year old twins were able to help. I have made it several times since the beginning of the holiday season. Made it for Thanksgiving for a pot-luck at my in-laws & it was one of the first desserts gone despite the table full of pumpkin & pecan pies. I've made it the way it's written, but we've also made it with banana pudding, with toasted coconut & chopped up marachino cherry bits on top-it was like a sunday! We've also made it with toasted coconut, sliced bananas & (well-drained) mandarin oranges. It made a fruity & tropical fresh dessert.

This was amazingly scrumptious!  I used 1% milk, lite cool whip, low-fat cinnamon graham crackers, fat-free, sugar-free pudding mix, and sugar-free chocolate frosting.  Took other reviewer's advice and melted frosting in microwave, then poured over chilled cake, and chilled some more.  A big hit at my dinner party.  Thanks, Cathy.

I have been making this for years, and it is awesome.  Frosting tip:  Melt the frosting in the microwave and pour over the top of the cake before refrigerating.  Much more like an eclair icing when you do this and easy to spread.

Something so easy just should not taste this good - too tempting to just keep making it and eating it.  I used all the usual cast of low-fat, reduced-sugar ingredients and this was still amazing.  Heed all the advice on microwaving the frosting - you definitely need it to be pourable for this. Thanks!

Oh man.  Yes.  This was SOOO good.  I wish I would've gone with a canned frosting..  I decided to make my own (which was suggested in a few of the reviews), and it was a bad choice.  This is such a "box-tasting" dessert, that the pre-packaged frosting would've been better.  It is REALLY good though.  My husband ate almost all of it in one day!!  Thanks for a super easy and super tasty recipe!  :)

My only problem with this recipe is it's name.  I tastes exactly as you imagine it would when you read the ingredients: pudding on graham crackers with fake icing on top.  But that is nothing like an eclair.  If you need something super easy and quick it'll be fine.  If you're looking for eclairs - stay away or make the real thing.

This was a hit at the super bowl party.  I beg to differ with reviewers, this tasted very much like the choco covered eclairs I buy in the freezer section.  The graham crackers I bought were store brand, not very sweet and tasted like cardboard to me.   But I had to use them since I bought them especially for this.  Used the cool whip and instant vanilla pudding as called for.  Followed other reviewers and brought 1 cup of heavy cream to boil and poured over a full 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet Ghiradelli chips and whisked in 1 tsp of Rodelle vanilla.  Poured over and smoothed out and put in the fridge for 24 hours.  AMAZING!!!!

My family loved this cake.  I couldn't eat it because I am diabetic however, I think next time I will try it with sugar free cool whip, pudding and frosting.  The graham crackers don't have much sugar.  Definitely easy and you can keep the ingredients on hand.

This was just ok to me. I guess I was expecting it to be fantastic with all the great reviews. The great thing about it was that it was so fast to make and my kids really liked it. I whipped 1/2 cup of cream and used that instead of  the cool whip. I also used homemade frosting instead of the store bought.

This is my brothers' favorite cake - they always requested it for their birthdays.  I made it for a team of teenage boys and used french vanilla pudding instead of plain vanilla.  They loved it.  My mom sometimes uses butterscotch pudding.

This was a huge hit! I too used French Vanilla pudding, I made the bottom layer of graham crackers chocolate ones, and I melted the frosting in the microwave and just poured on top. Ridiculously easy and soooooo delicious! I think next time I'm going to leave out the frosting. It won't look as good, but the frosting made it a little too sweet for me. It would be AMAZING and way less unhealthy if I left it out :)

I made two of these for work. The first I followed the recipe exactly, and the other I followed another reviewrs suggention and used Cheesecake pudding and chocolate grahms. The first was Wonderful and was gone rather quickly! The second was dubed the "Moon Pie" cake and became a vanishing act in its own right! There are many possibilities with this! Thank you so much for posting it!

Oh, my!  So easy, such a nice presentation.  Followed the recomendation to melt the frosting in microwave and this is the way to go.  I want to try it it with chocolate pudding.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks Cathy!

Wow, made this with all low or non-fat ingredients and it was delicious.  Instead of the frosting I used the fat free chocolate pudding for the topping.  I've made this with sliced bananas added to the vanilla layer and that's also good.

Amazingly easy, inexpensive and delicious!  I am not a big fan of reviews that reinvent recipes but I would like to suggest a few things.  Using french vanilla cool whip made the filling even more vanilla custard like.  Also, we heated the chocolate frosting slightly in the microwave and only used half a can, but that's personal preference.  My 15 year old made this, with a little help but her cooking skill is NOVICE, for Christmas, with rave reviews from everyone.

This is the type of dessert that is perfect if you are very limited on time or simply not up to a challenge.  It is very good and extremely easy to make.  I used a package of prepared chocolate frosting and almost went ahead and made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site or another topping.  I now wish I had.  It was ok but there was no wow factor.  Just a simple but good dessert.

EXCELLENT!! I made this recipe with the following substitutuions:

I accidentally used the larger size envelopes of pudding. I added 1/2 cup of extra milk and 1/2 cup of Tuaca (Vanilla Liquor)

I used up the entire box of graham crackers and heated the icing in the microwave.......

It was incredible. I plan to serve it at this weekend's brunch!! YOUM!!

Excellent!  I took this to my family's Christmas party and everyone loved it.  They kept saying how they never would've thought that the ingrediants could become an eclair.  The dessert was easy to make, especially softening the frosting.  I also let the pudding mixture set in the fridge for about 5 minutes before using it.

Very good recipe, although I've found that the kind of graham cracker you use can make a big difference. I would go with a thinner graham cracker. Keebler worked very well, Honey Maid didn't work very well. Excellent recipe.

A dessert that my husband loves, but was a little disappointed in the store bought chocolate frosting. Below the frosting was delicious and was even better the second day. I will make this again, only next time make a homemade chocolate icing for the topping.

This recipe is an oldie, but a goody! You can play around with ingredients and have a whole different, but still super easy and delicious dessert! I sometimes use Oreo's in place of the graham crackers - yummy! I have also used vanilla wafers and banana pudding, ginger snaps and cheese cake pudding, chocolate chip cookies with a layer of vanilla and a layer of chocolate pudding, - all super delicious. The trick is to let this sit over night whatever combo you use. It allows the moisture in the pudding to infuse into whatever cookie or cracker you use so they become soft and oh so scrumptious! Enjoy!!

I gave this a 5 even though I changed it a bit. I followed as written except I added an 8 ounce brick of softened whipped cream cheese to the pudding mixture before  I folded in the whipped topping. I also used a tub of dark chocolate frosting which I microwaved for about 30 seconds and poured over the top layer of crackers. Refrigerated overnight, and my family loved it the next day! Thanks for sharing!!!

Many people asked me for this recipe, because they loved it.  They didn't even realize that there were graham crackers used.  It is so easy to make!  The only change that I made was to heat the frosting in the microwave until I could easily pour it over the cake.  Delish!

I made this twice. The first time I bought vanilla cook and serve pudding thinking it was instant. Then after waiting 24 hours and cutting into it, the cake was liquified. The next day I remade it using a layer of cheesecake instant pudding on the bottom and a layer of banana cream instant pudding on the top. Yummy! My husband thought it tasted like a donut. So, if your pudding comes out liquified, you pulled a Michelle and used the wrong pudding mix! :P

Easy and delicious.  I usually split it into two pans - keep one at home and take one to work.  Otherwise it is too rich to get through the whole pan :)

An easier way to ice the "cake" is to put the container of chocolate fudge icing in the microwave for 1 minute, then pour over the top.  It will harden just like icing on a bakery eclair in the refrigerator.

This "cake" is so delicious and so easy.  I used one package of chocolate pudding and one package of vanilla pudding for variety.  I quickly dunked the graham crakers in milk, and they weren't crunchy at all by the time the dessert was served.  This is just so unique!!!!

Perfection and oh so easy to make!!  Just a tip to make icing the top layer of graham crackers a little easier; assemble as directed but refrigerate before icing.  That way the "cake" sets and it is much easier to ice.

try microwaving your frosting until it becomes liquid.  .  Don't over heat it, just enough so you can pour it.  Then you can simply pour it over the top, and when it cools, it will have smooth finish, just like a real eclair.

Awesome, I followed the reviews and melted the frosting in the microwave, 30 sec stir then 15 sec stir and pour over.  I also only had an 9X11 pan which it filled to the rim perfectly.  I had my husband grab the pudding while shopping and he grabbed a vanilla and a cheesecake which ended up tasting great.  Everybody at the party asked for the recipe. I made this today 1/13/11 and used a 9X13 pan, I think it looks better in the small pan.

LOOOOVE this! When my husband was little, his mom made him this instead of a birthday cake, as it is his favorite. I made this for Thanksgiving and it has replaced a cake that my Grandma has made since I can remember as the favorite dessert! This is so easy and inexpensive to make! It is best to make the night before and allow it to marry in the fridge overnight. Also, I use the "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" from this site instead of store bought icing. Sinfully good!

Frosting tip,  blend nutella, cool whip and caramel syrup ......... begin in a bowl of course and make in small amounts, adjusting the ingredients to your taste preference. Before refrigerating, top the cake with half of the frosting mixture, saving the remaining frosting in the cool whip container to top the cake before serving. That way you have no worries of the saran or foil affecting the frosting appearance.

This is now my son's "famous" recipe (thanks, Cathy!) he's 12 and whips it up himself for many get -togethers. Sometimes he switches up the pudding flavors (banana and cheesecake are his favorites) but in general, this recipe comes together quickly and easily and never fails to find a captive audience!

This was great....I followed the recipe exactly, except topped it with a glaze made from Nutella. I fed it to a group of adults, teens and children and everyone loved it!

Super easy! I made this for a party and I received many compliments.  I followed the recipe exactly and allowed it to sit in the fridge for about 24 hours before serving.  I personally think there was too much of the graham cracker taste, but my friends disagreed.  I also thought this tasted better the longer it sat in the fridge.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this about 5 times now and every time is a different flavor combination: oreo pudding with dark chocolate frosting, chocolate chip vanilla pudding with coconut pecan frosting, caramel chip chocolate pudding with birthday cake frosting, etc.. The possibilities are endless and it is always so tasty and easy! I recommend refrigerating for 2 hours before eating.

This recipe was very good. I substituted lady fingers for the graham crackers because I don't like graham crackers. I also added a little whipped cream cheese to cut down on the sweetness. It was AWESOME. Now I keep the ingredients for the filling on hand just in case!

I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought "how good can it be since it is so easy to make" but it was very, very good!  Took it to a gathering and it flew out of the dish.  One person even wanted to lick the remains!  Definitely a keeper.  I microwaved the store bought icing and it tasted great!  I might go make some more right now........

I was looking for a recipe that would be similar to Portillo's eclair cake and this one came VERY close! I used sugar free Jell-o and cool whip and it still had a great flavor! It was very hard NOT to eat the entire pan in one sitting!!!

Using Keebler Club Crackers instead of graham crackers give the cake layers like a real Eclair.

I have made this cake several times and it is a favorite with my son... I do my own variation because the chocolate frosting was just TOO sweet for us... instead I use chocolate pudding mix with cool whip so I use one small box pudding and 8 oz cool whip.... i also have diabetic family members.. so i also do the sugar free puddings and cool whip, skim milk and low fat graham crackers and my son can't tell the difference...

This was the first dessert to be finished at a recent cookout.  I followed the suggestion about softening the graham crackers in milk before layering.  Used French Vanilla pudding and, instead of frosting, I melted half a bag of chocolate chips (mixed w/ a tad of milk) and drizzled over the top.  This made it more like an eclair.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit with my friends.  I wouldn't say it taste exactly like an Eclair, but it was still awesome.....and so easy to make.  FYI:  I used sugar free pudding, lite whipped topping, and cinnamon grahman crackers.  I also melted chocolate chips and poured it on top, rather then using canned icing.  I think it is the perfect desert for a summer time BBQ, because it is chilled and super easy.

I love this cake! I was taught how to make it using no salt saltine crackers instead of graham crackers. I tried the graham crackers last time I made it, but felt that they were too heavy and thick. I personally like the saltines better! BUt still a really yummy cake! And it much easier to get the frosting on by melting it in the microwave first, and then just pouring it on.

So good!  I use this recipe for the frosting instead of canned:  4 T butter, ½ C water, 6 T cocoa, 1 t vanilla, 2 C powdered sugar.
Melt butter in water.  Remove from heat.  Add vanilla, cocoa and powdered sugar.  Spread on top of crackers.

I made this for my mother's birthday, and it was a hit!  Delicious!
I also used one package regular vanilla, and one french (that's all they had left at the store!), and it turned out great.
I also dipped the graham crackers in milk first, as someone suggested.
Oh, I did use a recipe for the chocolate, which ended up going with the rest of it GREAT.
2 cups powdered sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Everyone loves this.  Had at many get togethers.  But don't use cinnamon graham crackers like i did.  Gave it a funny taste, was good however.  But I know it's better without the cinnamon.

I fixed this for a housewarming party and it was a crowd pleaser. Everyone wanted the recipe. It was very easy to make and I wasn't in the kitchen very long. I did have to add at least another 1/2 cup of milk for a smoother texture. One great tip for this recipe is to put your store bought chocolate frosting in the microwave for about 30-35 seconds. After    mixing the chocolate  I just poured it on top of the eclair cake. I didn't even have to spread it with a knife. I will be making the recipe many, many more times.

Very good and very quick and tastes like a moon pie.  I used non-fat milk, one package vanilla and one package banana pudding mixes and low fat cool whip.  I microwaved my fudge frosting for 30 seconds or so and then put it in a pastry decorating bag with a small round opening and drew lines back and forth on top - it looks very pretty that way. Thanks for the recipe.

I like this recipe for several reasons. Not only is it the easiest thing in the world to make, it's one dessert that appeals to both adults and kids (there aren't too many of those!) I use the French vanilla pudding and add a little extra vanilla. Also, if you microwave the icing (as suggested by some of the reviewers), not only is it easier to spread but you can just get a thin "glaze" on top instead of a thick coating (which is what you want in an "eclair.") Haven't met anyone yet who doesn't love it!!

I've made this several times. Always a hit. We like it better when it sets up overnight, as opposed to only 4 hours. I find it easier to ice the graham crackers individually just holding them in my hand (I use about 1/2 the container), then lay them down on the pudding and use the remaining icing to pull it all together and smooth it out. Yummy!!!

VERY tasty, as written!  A keeper for sure! [Maybe my math is bad but I just couldn't figure how to cut 14 portions from a 13x9x2" pan. The best I could do was 12 servings].  Using the basic recipe I also make my own variation, which my family enjoys. I use butterscotch pudding mix, and add Butter Brickle Bits, when combining with the whipped topping.  Everything else is the same as the original recipe.

i've never made anything that people loved as much as they did this!  and so nice to be able to make it ahead of time!  i made only one variation from cathy's recipe - instead of using 2 boxes of vanilla pudding, i used 1 box of vanilla and 1 box of cheesecake flavored pudding - it was the perfect touch!  the icing was just plain ol' chocolate (i had wanted something more "fancy" but there was no other choice in the store!) and it was JUST like the icing on an eclair in both taste and consistency (microwaved 25 secs and poured, as many others suggested).  SO FABULOUS!!!!  will make again & again.  thanks, cathy!

Have been making this for a couple years now - always a treat and surprisingly good for so few ingredients and no-baking. It definitely has to sit though or else the graham crackers are too crunchy which makes it hard to cut into and serve and it ruins the "eclair effect" of it being soft and gooey!

BIG FAT YUM!  I made this today to take to friends' house tomorrow because I heard that it is even better the next day.  I don't know, but it sure was INCREDIBLE today!  Just a couple tips others have suggested.  I used my kitchen aid mixer with the whisk attached to mix the cool whip, milk and pudding.  I let it set in the fridge for just a couple minutes.  Also, it does help to microwave the frosting at 15-20 second intervals, stirring after each interval.  THIS WILL BE GOOD FOR BREAKFAST, TOO!  HA!

This is so easy and delicious.  My 3 year-old enjoyed stirring the pudding mixture and helping arrange the graham crackers.  I used low-fat graham crackers, fat free vanilla pudding mix, and fat free cool whip.  Still great!  Now I'm waiting for Betty Crocker to make a fat free frosting!?

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ and everyone loved it. It was very simple of make. I used two large boxes of pudding and one large container of cool whip and it was plenty for the large crowd.

This has been a family favorite for years.
*** Here's a tip: remove foil from frosting can
and microwave on high for 30 seconds, then just
pour frosting over cake & refridgerate ***

This was very good, and so easy that it deserves 5 stars. I mad half the recipe, used real heavy cream, whipped, and made the chocolate topping suggested by the most popular reviewer of this recipe instead of using prepared frosting. Thanks!

Another frosting tip is to microwave the frosting, until it gets thin, about 30 sec, it pours over the crackers with ease, it sets up after it cools. but it is more like a glaze than a frosting.. yummy

I take this to many functions. To make it healthier, using heavy whipping cream w/o sugar works well, and I definitely think making the icing v. canned is very worth it if you have time. It is pretty to put a layer of whipped topping over the icing even, especially if you put this in a glass pan. The layers look intriguing! Use french vanilla pudding instead of plain vanilla.

Delicious! I used Cheesecake flavored pudding instead of vanilla, and topped with chocolate ganache. Let this cake sit in the fridge at least 8 hours before eating, the longer it sits the better it gets! 

Also, this cake is a very "pretty" cake, so it's perfect for parties, potlucks, etc.

I think I only got the bits left in the bottom of the pan!!  Definitely a hit in my house.  Awesome and incredibly easy to make.  I used cookies & cream pudding only because that's all I had on hand.  This was gobbled up in a hurry and I've made it again already this week!  AWESOME

This went over big with my family and so easy.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a tsp. of vanilla extract to the pudding mixture and letting the cracker/pudding layers set in the refrigerator for about 2 hours before frosting (I used milk chocolate), which, upon the tips of others here, I heated at 80 power for 30 seconds then stirred.  This made it quite easy to spread over the top cracker layer.  I refrigerated it for a full 7 hours before cutting.  Quite pretty.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I make a similar cake, but quickly dip the crakers in a mixture of 1 cup prepared coffee + 1 Tablespoon of cognac or brandy, instead of canned frosting I top with chocolate ganache. you can have a lot of variations for this cake, you can be as creative or as sophisticated as you want it to be.

I love this. I've been making it for years! Instead of spreading the frosting, I've always melted it in a small pan then poured it over the top. Looks beautiful, tastes excellent.

The recipe I have calls for French Vanilla Pudding and says to let sit for 3 days in the fridge. If you can wait that long, it really is much better! Microwaving the frosting works very well since you can pour it! Always the first dessert gone!

The kids ate this up however I found this a bit sweet. Easy to make however I would suggest letting it set so the frosting is easier to put on.
Overall I would make it again for a quick and easy kid friendly dessert.

I've been making this dessert for years.  It's one of my favorites, especially for summer.  I use 3 boxes of French vanilla instant pudding, 2 1/4 cups of milk and 2 8oz. containers of whipped topping though.  I've used the plain vanilla pudding, but the French vanilla makes it so much better!  Enjoy!

Made this dessert for 25 hungry high school basketball players!  they were scrapping the pan..I should have made more...needless to say this is fanastic and simple to make.  You can keep it on the lighter side by using fat free milk, and light cool whip.  I also added a little bit of vanilla extract to the vanilla pudding as it was mixing (yummy!).  As per other recommondations I also softened (not melted) the chocolate frosting-I used whipped fudge icing and its pretty soft already.  This is a delicious dessert...oh If you have the time, letting this chill over night is a must!!! perfect consistency and texture.

The first time I made this, my colleagues liked it but I  thought it had too much of an "instant/out of the box" taste.  I tweaked this by adding bananas (ripe but still firm) and folding in natural peanut butter (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup, depending how strong you want the PB taste to be) into the pudding and whipped topping mix.  And instead of packaged frosting, I make a quick ganache--8 oz chocolate melted in 8 oz hot cream for the full recipe. I now call it "banana refrigerator cake" and actually prefer it to banana cream pie because it's less sweet.

Yum!  This was an easy, yummy dessert that everyone loved.  I made it for work the other day and it was a hit.  The only change I made was that I made chocolate ganache (9 oz semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup heavy cream) to pour on top rather than using can frosting.

This was sensational!!  I made this for the first time for a friend's summer bbq......which I NEVER do, because I always like to try it at home first.....and it was a huge hit!  I did as others suggested and melted the icing before pouring it over the cake---it ended up being the perfect chocolaty layer when I served it.  Thank you for posting this recipe---it is my new potluck gem!!

This was excellent!!!  One of the things I like the be best about this website is being able to read other people's reviews and using some of their tweaks.  I used cinnamon graham crackers, french vanilla pudding, and dark chocolate icing (which I heated and poured over the top layer of graham crackers as suggested by several others). I cannot believe how good this is!!!!  AND SO SIMPLE!!!

This was very good. I didnt have the two pkgs. of graham crackers. So, I improvised and made personal servings.  I also soaked the crackers in a bit of milk to soften them. So, that we could eat them right away. And, lastly, we are a family of white chocolate lovers..So, I sparingly used white choc. I used a fork to make pretty lines over the pudding. I am going to try the chocolate forsure now. My family absolutely loved it!

followed recipe exactly.  I read a lot of reviews discussing frosting or not - the frosting is a must for it to taste as an eclair does.  We tried it after 15 hours and I really did not like it.  It tasted like soggy graham crackers.  I brought it to a party the next day to get rid of it and many people liked it so I tried it again and it was better. Morale of the story - it must be chilled for at least 24hrs.

Outstanding, I get asked to make this a lot. I don't change a thing, except I melt the frosting in the microwave first to make spreading easier.

It's amazingly simple but it tastes phenomenal!! My family didn't believe that it needed no baking. 

They don't sell graham crackers where I live (Sad, huh?) so I used ladies' finger cookies instead. I sliced them lengthwise and layered them with the cream. If you let it sit for 1-2 days, it tastes just like cake!!

Another thing I changed was I omitted the milk altogether and used real vanilla pudding (not the mix! those that come in the snack cups) instead. Just mix the pudding with the whipped cream and voila! A perfect cream for layering.

Delicious and super easy to make. I used skim milk and low-fat whipped topping and it still tastes great.

I made this Monday night for dinner on Tuesday and was a bit skeptical because I didn't have a chance to test it out beforehand.  But everyone loved it and raved about it.  The person I was most worried about was my boyfriend because he doesn't like mushy desserts (eg. tiramisu) and he loved it the most!  The graham crackers didn't get soggy but soft and still had a bit of texture.  I used cinnamon graham crackers and vanilla pudding (I wanted to use white chocolate but they only had sugar free) and canned frosting.  I didn't find the dessert sweet at all except for the frosting.  In fact, I will use only half a can next time because I had some left over and thought there was too much on top.  Oh and I also nuked the can in the microwave to make spreading easier.  Very quick and easy dessert and I like that I can play around with the flavours.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious!  I didn't know how it would be but read the reviews, so figured I'd test it on my family as guinea pigs.  It was a huge success.  There were 6 desserts to choose from, and this was the one everyone ate, and had seconds of.  It is a cinch to make!  I did use cinnamon graham crackers, but I don't think that made a huge difference.  Also, I did follow the tip of microwaving the frosting before putting it on.  I just threw mine in the microwave for approximately 30 seconds, and it was thin enough to pour.  I will, 100%, definitely be making this again!

This was very good, and I'm glad I made it for a holiday party.  It was easy to put together- not fancy, but tasted great for the ingredients that were involved.  I'll keep it in mind again for a party or potluck.

I have been making this recipe for 25 years and the easiest way I have found to spread the frosting is to put it in the microwave for a few seconds (about 30 seconds) to soften it, stir and spread.  My family has always loved this recipe.

I remember making this as a youngster, since it was a no-bake dessert that was a great 'training wheels' type of recipe. Years later, it was great to try this comfort food classic again and share it with co-workers for a Thanksgiving potluck. Thanks!

This is absolutely heavenly and SO simple to make!! I used french vanilla pudding and added just a touch of vanilla extract to the pudding mixture. I also followed the advice of a couple of other reviewer's and dipped the graham crackers in milk before putting in the cake and they were nice and soft after only refrigerating for 4 hours, but not mushy the next day (This only lasted 2 days in our house!!). Lastly, I put the chocolate frosting in the microwave for 45 seconds, which made it very easy to just pour on top. Delicious!!

This was good and easy.  I do prefer it with the crackers more crunchy so I'll make it when I know there will be little to no leftovers.  I did take the advice of heating the frosting first.

This can also be made lowfat by changing the products to low fat instant vanilla pudding mix and skim or soy milk, fat free whipped topping, reduced calorie grahams, and lower calorie chocolate frosting; and it is still amazing and rich.

This dessert is way toooooo sweet.  Not to mention that the graham crackers get very soggy, and it seems as if you're only eating pudding with chocolate.

Very easy and simple to make, and it did taste so good.  I let it sit in the fridge for over 24 hours before eating.  The only thing I though was that it was too much vanilla mixture.  Next time I think I will double the layer of Graham's crackers.  And may be cut down of the Vanilla mixture, that way it may come out looking a little bit more presentable.

wow. This is an amazing dessert. I was hesitant to make it just because it looked so easy. I like my desserts to impress, but trust me, this will impress! Stick the frosting in the microwave for 30 seconds so you can pour it on. I like to let mine sit in the fridge overnight and by morning its perfect.

Have made this twice.  First time used store bought frosting.  Second time went for homemade chocolate frosting.  Took the second one to work and was immediately asked for the recipe.  Delicious and extremely easy to make.  I think I might try dipping the graham crackers in espresso next time to get a tiramisu flavor.

Very good!  Exactly what my husband's aunt always brings to family reunions.  My husband saw me looking at this recipe and literally begged me to make it. =)  I could eat a bowl full of the filling.  It is SO good!  I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from the site on top but used milk chocolate chips instead of bittersweet.

This really was very good.  I was skeptical.  As others suggested, I used chocolate graham crackers (not to be confused with chocolate-covered graham crackers).  I also used sugar free pudding mix and fat free cool whip.  All the kids loved it and ate it for days.  And it is definitely better if you let it refrigerate for 4-6 hours but even better is overnight--the longer the better--everything starts to meld together.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was excellent.  The only thing I changed is used french vanilla pudding and honey graham crackers.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The recipe as is, is okay, but I didn't really think it tasted like an eclair. I experimented a bit and made some variations which I think really improved on it and resulted in an eclair taste. Instead of using graham crackers I used crushed vanilla wafers for the bottom and middle layers. The top layer I used crushed chocolate wafers. For the filling I only used 2 cups of milk as it made the filling a little more thicker and flavorful. I folded in the Cool Whip after I thoroughly mixed the milk and pudding together. I used a milk chocolate frosting on top, but only used about 1/2 of the container so it would just have a thin layer on top and like other reviewers microwaved it for about 30 seconds so it became a glaze and was easy to pour and spread. It was so much better. Both times I did use the Cool Whip, but next time I will use my homemade whipped cream as I prefer it to Cool Whip and I think will enhance the flavor even more.

Made this recipe and just had it for dessert. It was excellent and so easy to prepare. I only made 1/2 the recipe in case we didn't like it. I made it in a 9 X 9 pan and used 9 graham crackers for each layer.

We loved this recipe.  It did taste a lot like an eclair!  My 3 year old son actually did most of the work...very easy and loved that it is no-bake.  Great for summer barbeques. Made my own fudge icing, which hardedned nicely in the fridge and then softened slightly at room temp: 1cup sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup milk, 4 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp lt corn syrup, dash of salt.  Boil together in saucepan 3 minutes,then add 1 tsp vanilla and 3/4 to 1 cup powdered sugar.  it will pour right over the cake.  will definately make this again for a crowd!

This one gets 5 stars because of taste, presentation and being quick and easy to prepare. I usually try to avoid "shortcut" ingredients, especially when having guests over.... but sometimes you just don't have time to do something fancy (I have two kids under 2)and this is always enjoyed by all. AND I can remember it without having to look at the recipe :)

My roommate made this for a Christmas party, and I thoroughly enjoyed the leftovers. She did use French Vanilla pudding, and I think that makes all the difference, along with a long refrigeration time. Divine.

we loved it! i announced that it had to be refrigerated for 2 days before we could eat it...that was hard! i would recommend the cinnamon graham crackers and french vanilla pudding. i personally don't like prepared frostings, so i tried hot fudge ice cream topping. i heated it in the microwave and poured it on...good, but very sweet.

I followed this recipe exactly and turned out awesome.  I even used fat free cool whip.  The frosting I melted in the microwave for 1 minute at 1/2 power and just poured it over the cake. Next time I will go for lite or fat free graham crackers and see how that works out.  I actually made it on a Tuesday and did not serve it until Friday. My guests loved it. It tastes exactly like a chocolate eclair!  This is a keeper for sure!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

This was very good and so easy to make.  I made individual ramekins by crushing the graham crackers into medium sized chunks and layering it into the ramikens as the directions said.  They were very pretty and everyone loved them.

We all enjoyed this.  I melted the icing in the microwave, thinned it a tiny bit with milk and poured 1/3 in the middle layer, and the rest on top.  If I make this again, I think I will make a homemade chocolate ganache instead of the pre-packaged icing.  This was totally different than anything I've had before so thanks for the recipe, will probably make again with a few tweeks.

Yum yum yum.... this was so good.  I added about 1/4 cup of peanut butter to my filling, and I made my own frosting but next time I probably won't bother & just buy a can of frosting.

I scaled this down to make in a 9x9 pan-a 6 serving package of pudding, 2 1/3 cups milk, 3/4 of the container of whipped topping, enough graham crackers to cover the pan, and what was left of a can of chocolate frosting, which I heated in the microwave and poured over.  It was much more reasonable for two people, although I've been eating it for four days and it gets better the longer it sits.  Also, next time I'll splurge on brand-name graham crackers, since it took forever for mine to get soft.  
For people who substituted sugar free pudding and tried to match the number of ounces, I think it's easier to match the serving size or it will be too stiff.

A++++
I love, love, love this recipe!  So easy and delicious.  I made this for my parents 39th anniversary!  I chose this recipe because it reminded me of a dessert that we all enjoy when we are in Florida.  My parents couldn't believe how close it was to the famous restaurant's version.  I made the cake exactly as the recipe states.  However, I did not use the canned frosting because we do not like canned frosting.  I used the chocolate glaze recipe found here.  It was sooo beautiful.  I then drizzled white icing over the glaze and it looked quite fancy! I highly suggest kicking it up a notch with homemade icing.  You'll be appreciated!

Really good.  Really dangerous.  I'll be doing pilates for next six weeks to work off the GIGANTIC piece(s) I had.  For me, this didn't really carry an eclair flavor - more like a regular pudding pie.  Only, with that yummy layer of frosting on the top...

Rated this 4 stars because my husband loved it.  Too much icing for me and when the cake is refrigerated, the icing becomes hard, the filling remains soft so it mushes out from under the icing.

I was embarrassed when I served this dessert. First I was afraid the graham crackers wouldn't be good if they weren't cruched, but I followed the recipe regardless. And they just ended up soggy graham crackers. It doesn't taste like a chocolate eclair either. If you want your guests to suspect you didn't put any time, effort and thought into a dessert, then make this for them. Yuck. Never again. I gave it one star - only because it would be an easy dessert for kids to make.

Anyone who says this is not good is just plain nuts!! Where can you go wrong? Pudding, cool whip, graham and frosting all together = perfection. I have made this dessert a million times and have NEVER had one person say they didn't like it. Easy enough for my kid brother to make and he's a college student. Give it a try you will love it.

Sooo Yummy! 
i used french vanilla pudding and fat free cool whip, which worked wonderfully, then I also sprinkled cocoa on top of each pudding layer. I also dunked the graham crackers in milk before placing them down on the pudding, which i suggest doing! For the topping i use the Chocolate Ganache recipe on this site, using semisweet chocolate chips, heavy cream, and vanilla, and it made it even more delicious.
I left it in the frig over night and it was great!

It was somewhat reminiscent of an eclair, but the graham crackers tasted like graham crackers, not pate a choux. If you like really sweet desserts, you will like it though.

I had this recipe and I love it. It is great for a summer dessert. The only thing that I changed is instead of chocolate frosting, I use Hershey's hot fudge sauce, it spreads really well and is not as sweet as the frosting!

I made this for Father's Day.  I used half the frosting and used Lite Cool-Whip.  Everyone commented how lite and refreshing it was.

I got this recipe years ago from a friend. It's currently in storage so I was happy to find it here so I could make it for a recent potluck. I did change it a bit to make it like my original recipe. I used French Vanilla pudding and a chocolate glaze rather than frosting on top. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I make this all summer long as it's so easy, has few ingredients, is inexpensive and you don't have to heat up your kitchen baking. It always impresses people and you almost hate to have to admit to how easy it really is! It's the kind of desert you can eat after a meal when you think you're full because it's so light and it really a nice finishing touch.

Easy, good tasting dessert...but next time I make it I don't think I'll use the whole tub of frosting because it was a little to chocolate-y and it kind of overwhelmed the dessert.  Maybe half a tub or just enough to get a thin layer on top.  But I will make it again!

I first ate this several years ago, and made it soon after from memory based off what the woman who made it told me.  I never wrote it down, and ended up forgetting what was in in.  So I was very excited to find this recipe on allrcipes.com.  It's out of this world!!  One recommendation: Remove all of the foil from the frosting container, and heat the container until the frosting is slightly melted.  You can then pour the frosting on top of the graham crackers and spread it easier.  The frosting will set up after you put it in the refrigerator.  Just be careful to not overheat the chocolate.

This cake was YUMMY, although very rich.  The next time I make it, I think I will cut the amount of frosting by about half (and I am a chocoholic!).  I used the frosting that is made to microwave and pour - it came out perfect, and was really easy to spread - even over the creamy filling.  I can't believe how easy this was to make, and so good!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you!!

This was SO easy and delicious.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  I took someone elses advice and used a homemade chocolate buttercream.  I'm sure I'll be making this one again.

First of all, I wouldn't call it "eclair" cake, but more lke "mille-feuille"cake! Because of the shape and taste. I made my own whipped cream and frosting to control the amount of sugar I put in it, and still came out a bit too rich. I personally loved it, but my family said it was a bit too sweet. I think that they have just become a bit too picky because I make them a different dessert every Sunday!

Had this at a bridal shower and it was wonderful!  However, as a diabetic, I had to change it somewhat for my families consumption.  I used SF pudding and SF whipped topping.  I also cut down the chcolate amount by melting only a couple of ounces and drizzling it in a diagonal pattern over the top.  With small servings this was great for my family!

This cake, is rich, but light and VERY easy to do! Excellent and fun choice to make with your child chef and get them encouraged & interrested in the kitchen! But even if you don't have kids, this one's really worth it to make. If you are new to this site & feeling overwhelmed at all the decedant desserts. this is a good place to start!...8/7/06: I made this again last night and I can't stop eating it, it's sooo good. Don't alter a thing on this recipe!

I give this recipe 5 stars because it was so easy to make and my family really enjoyed it at a birthday party.  I'm not too fond of eclairs, but my mom loves them and she had two pieces of the cake.  Also I do not have a microwave, so I heated the frosting on the stove...it turned out perfect.

I made this almost as-is, except I made my own frosting (Chocolate Frosting II on this site) and used low fat cool whip. I found that you did not need a full package of graham crackers --- more like 2/3rds, so if you don't have a full box on hand, don't worry about it. Overall, this is really rich and delicious and does actually taste like an eclair. I used lactose-free milk.

It doesn't get any easier than this!  The one adjustment I made was mixing half of the cool whip with 8 oz. of cream cheese for the bottom layer, and the vanilla pudding and cool whip for the second layer.  It was awesome!!  Definitely let it refrigerate overnight so the graham crackers get soft.

For those that didn't like this recipe, it may be the store bought icing.  I am partial to homemade icing.  Here's my suggestion: 9Tbsp cocoa, 5 Tbsp melted butter, 1/2 t. vanilla, 4-5 Tbsp milk, 1.5 c powered sugar. Melt butter, add the rest. YUM!

very easy recipe to make, I didn't think it tasted much like an eclair but still none the less very very good.  Whole family enjoyed it.  I did put the vanilla cream in the fridge for about 10 minutes though and it helped it wasn't as runny.  Will definitely make this again

Oh so easy!! As far as the chocolate frosting at the end goes, I have found that if you stick the whole jar of chocolate frosting in the microwave for 10-20 seconds it will melt it  enough to POUR it over the cake!!

It was easy to make & looked great, but I can only give it three stars.  My biggest issue is that it was too sweet for me.  I will try again with sugar-free whipped cream.

I've made this recipe many many times but I've tweeked it a bit:
1. Since I strongly dislike frosting, I buy a large bar of milk chocolate (a good quality is best). I break it into pieces and melt it in the microwavable bowl with a splash of canola oil. I heat at 5-10 second intervals (stirring in between). Then, I drizzle the melted chocolate on top of the final layer of the eclair. It hardens into perfection.
2. I make 5-6 layers instead of the three that's called for in this recipe.
3. The graham crackers can be replaced with plain tea biscuits. They are cheaper than and taste the same, if not better. :)

I made it! Took it to a Christmas party and everyone loved it. I took advise from others and microwaved the frosting - great advise... Thank you!

Made it again for a friend's birthday  who really  loves  this recipe. This time when I got home and already started to mix the pudding  I discovered I bought banana pudding... oops I also added bananas to the recipe. Everyone liked it.

I fell in love with this dessert in a restaurant and was thrilled to find the recipe online - it tastes exactly like it! I used the chocolate topping recipe from the reviewer BaysChick in the "Chocolate Eclair Dessert" recipe, as anything canned or artificial wouldn't do it justice - I wanted a restaurant-quality dish and I got it!

Very good and easy to put together!  I used hot fudge topping instead of frosting and sprinkled some nut topping on top that I had on hand.  Will make again!

TOOK to work today for a lunch potluck and it WAS GONE in one hour !! I never made this before and I had to double this recipe. FIRST of all in case you DONT thaw the cool whip in the frig, no worries.  I did not thaw in the frig I was in a hurry. I had 4 boxes of pudding - 2 banana and 2 French vanilla, cheap brands.  I used 2% milk. 2 containers of STORE brand topping that looks like cool whip but I did use good gram crackers.  I made in the large square aluminum pan i got from the 99 cent store.  no spraying anything at the bottom I saw those on some recipes and why? your not baking anything.  Anyway first thing i did was have the bags of crackers cut open and on a dish so that you have them ready to layer especially when the second layering starts. in a large bowl I dumped the 4 boxes of pudding, 6 cups of milk and dumped on top of all that the two containers of the FROZEN whipped topping.  I used my mixer and had a nice thick mixture in 3 minutes.  filled open  spots with broken pieces.  i used honey and cinnamon,  my frosting was a blend of heated choc and vanilla.  CHILLED covered with foil from 7pm to when I took to work chilled again until we had at noon and it was GONE and delicious !! I wonder what it will be like when I do thaw the cool whip ha-ha does not matter this is a FAIL PROOF recipe !!

This was really yummy however it reminded me more of a tiramisu just with less cake texture. I tried to healthify this, if you will, and used So Delicious whipped light coconut topping (lactose intolerant here), original almond milk light, 2 1oz packets of sugar free white chocolate, 1 1oz sugar free cheesecake and 1 3.5oz vanilla (I got a little creative with what I had on hand). I brought it in to my co-workers and they devoured it in one day, mind you we only have 5 of us in our office! I also took the advice from another user with the chocolate frosting and made it myself with the coco powder, butter, etc. I'm quite sure the original recipe is fabulous if It still tasted great with my revisions!

This recipe is easy to make and so delicious!!  
*****One easy tip though****....I actually warm up the frosting to liquefy it then pour it on and even it out.  I recommend doing it on the stove on low heat though....then it doesn't burn like the microwave could make it do.  When it chills back up it is back to frosting form and still just as yummy!

Made this for a Christmas party and everyone loved it. So easy and yummy. I melted Hersheys milk choc frosting right in the container in the microwave until it was pourable. Going to put this one in my personal recipe book for sure.

I loved this. It was quick and easy to make other than the fridge time. but husband and son didn't think to much of it. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.....but it's different strokes for different folks.

Tasted nothing like an eclair, not even close! Too artificial tasting with all that cool whip and instant pudding. I rather make real eclairs, even if they are a little bit more work, well worth it.

I have been making this for years!  You have to use Instant "French Vanilla" pudding and it makes all the difference in the taste....Really!  My family loves when I make this, and now my kids are making it to take to gatherings as well.   Thanks for all the other tips too!

This is my goto for potlucks. Instead of vanilla instant pudding I use French vanilla instant pudding. To spread the icing easier I microwave it for 30- 45 seconds then poured on top!

this recipes is wonderful except I substitute for the icing, choc. fudge instant pudding (small box) and 1 3/4 cup cold mile, 1/2 c confections sugar sifted. I combine all the above and spread over the 
cold cake base. my family likes it better than icing.

I tried this recipe for a friends birthday and it didn't work out at all for me.  It turned out soupy, literally liquid was spilling from it and I put it in the refrigerator overnight and again when I got to work hoping it would harden up.  Not so.  I think maybe put 1 cup of milk in and stir everything together and maybe another cup of milk, but I wouldn't do 3 again, it just did not set for me at all.  I will try it again, just because of all the rave reviews... I will do a cup of milk at a time next time though.

We really liked the eclair cake.  I've eaten other versions and I would definately increase the cream filling by one and a half or double.  I also highly recommend microwaving the frosting so it is pourable and using about 3/4 of the container.  Even without the changes it was tasty and so easy.  It is pretty too.  Definately a keeper.

This is such a hit in my house!  I have 3 small boys and a husband with a sweet tooth and this cake is cheap, easy, and it makes a whole lot!  It keeps very well in the fridge too.  Only thing I did different was double the chocolate frosting.  We just love it and I make it whenever we have company or go to a cookout or function where we've been asked to bring something.

This has been a favorite in our house for YEARS. I am a little tired of it - but, the kids ALWAYS love it. To change it up, I will sometimes substitute cherry pie filling (might take 2 cans for a 13x9) for the chocolate frosting. It is delish this way - and a nice change from the chocolate. **I also always make a point to find the French Vanilla pudding - it does make a difference.

So simple, so good. Have even made using the cheapest pudding and graham crackers I can find and you can't tell the difference to the final product whether I used Jell-O brand pudding of Walmart store brand, same goes for the crackers which I find to be a plus. Adults and kids alike rave about this easy to make, no bake dessert.

A great crowd pleaser, and so easy to make. Melting the icing in the microwave for 30 seconds so it would pour was perfect. It sat in the fridge for 18 hours before being served and the graham crackers were still just the right texture - soft but in tact enough to be yummy. I used classic chocolate icing, but I think milk chocolate might be nice too.

This was a super-easy last minute dessert to make for a dinner get-together. Everyone was thinking that it was a recipe that took a lot of time to prepare, and they laughed with gitty when I told them it was mainly instant pudding and some whipped topping...... Then of coarse they had to have the recipe!!! :)

WOW, so easy and so delicious. I took several suggestions from reviewers. I did use french vanilla pudding. Did put frosting in microwave for 30 seconds and gave it a good stir to pour on top. And made it the night before to sit overnight to let graham crackers get moist. This was very popular and church members couldn't stop coming back for more. Should have made 2!

I made exactly as written the first time. It was yummy and easy but needed more fridge time to really soften the graham crackers. The second time I used cheesecake flavored pudding mix, thinned out the frosting in a double boiler and added strong coffee to it. I only used about 1/3 of that mixutre, just drizzling it on top. OVER THE TOP DELISH. Thanks for a great recipe, Cathy!

Try making this with chocolate grahams & French vanilla pudding. To make the frosting easier to spread, sit the unopened can in a container of really hot water for about 15 minutes (or longer). It makes it a breeze to spread on the grahams.

The first time I made this, the "pudding" mixture turned out extremely watery so I put it in the freezer. When I poured it over the first layer of crackers it went right through and the crackers became soggy. the next time, I tried this I made the pudding mix first and then slowly added the milk and whipped topping. It turned out perfectly. overall, it tasted phenomenal!

I seriously could not believe how delicious this was.  I made it 24 hours in advance of serving it (a must, so the graham crackers absorb the pudding and convert to the consistency of crust).  Wow.  Unbelievable.  It reminded me of a cream-filled maple bar (donut).  I used homemade chocolate frosting (softened in the microwave to a pourable consistency).  As the frosting cools in the fridge, it takes on the appearance/consistency of a ganache.  Next time, I plan to use a dark chocolate ganache.  Whipped this whole thing up in literally minutes.  A thousand "thank you's" for the recipe.

DELICIOUS!

The tip about melting the chocolate icing & pouring over the cake was a "wealth of info" for me.  I've been making this cake for years and never thought about that!  Duh!

Thank you!

I agree with others, melt frosting and pour over.  Also I used french vanilla pudding instead of vanilla, I like the taste better!  Oh, also make sure it sits at least overnight.  The graham crackers soften better that way.

I made this cake twice in one week and I was intent in producing a rich, creamy dessert.   Both times I used homemade ganache topping and I used whole milk for the pudding.  I did use whipped topping as the recipe called for.  The first cake had 9 hours to soften and comingle flavors.  It was very good but the graham crackers were not fully softened.  Everyone liked it however my dad preferred milk chocolate for the ganache.  I used bittersweet chocolate so it was not very sweet.  The second cake I made 60 hours in advance of consumption for an office lunch and it was wonderful.  This time I used semisweet chocolate.  In fact the lunch and dessert were also a competition and my Éclair Cake won first place, out of six other desserts.   For both cakes I added a nice decorative variegated white topping (using a toothpick technique, like a spider web.  See photo.)  This is a keeper recipe!

YUMMY!!!!!  I made this last night with 1pkg French Vanilla & 1pkg Vanilla (all I had at home) also used light honey grahams and Pillsbury Chocolate Fudge frosting (slightly microwaved) after I chilled cake for about an hour.  I also let the frosting set about 30min in fridge before covering with foil (no frosting stuck).

This was super easy and my 5yr old girl enjoyed helping.  The only hard part is getting the 1st piece of cake out.  My daughter loves it.  Can't wait to take the rest to work so they can try it too.  Next time I'll make sure to use all French Vanilla tho.

This is so good! I had a dessert like this a month or so ago and googled for the recipe as soon as I got home. It really is like a chocolate glazed eclair donut. I followed the recipe exactly, made the dessert 20 hours in advance and it was perfection!! I'm making it again this week for a game night. Thanks!

Easy, quick and delicious dessert. It tastes just like eating a homemade Eclair. I can't wait to make this recipe again.

I agree with some previous reviewers that I'm not sure whether it tasted like an eclair.....but it was very tasty and VERY easy....I made this for a snackbar I cater and it went fast and furious and everyone seemed to love it.  I followed the recipe but took one suggestion to double up the layer of graham crackers for extra texture...next time I won't double the very first  or top layer, but will double the middle one for sure...the extra bottom crackers never moistened and it was awkward to serve with the falling grahams.  Will absolutely make this one again.....per order of my customers :)

Everyone loved this, but next time I will double the layers of graham crackers. They get really soft after sitting for some time so there's basically no substance or flavor to them. I used 1 box each SF vanilla and cheesecake pudding, SF Cool Whip, and made my own frosting.

So easy & soooo yummy!!! I whisked the milk and pudding together until firm and then folded in the whipped topping. Also, I sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top of each of the pudding layers. The choc. chips added a nice touch. This is a definite keeper!

Love this recipe! I’ve been making it for years for all kinds of celebrations. I use French Vanilla pudding for a slightly stronger taste. I buy chocolate frosting and slowly melt it on low power in the microwave. Pour it evenly on top and spread. Cool in fridge. Delicious!! Thank you!,

I will give this 5 stars but I did NOT use the store bought frosting and instead made a ganache to top.  I let it set overnight and it was a big hit at my progressive diner.  I also made this in a loaf pan so I had extra ingredients ..I let it set in the fridge over night and then turned it over onto a serving platter and then topped with the ganache and put back into the fridge until serving time...Looked good and tasted good.

EXCELLENT!  The 1st time I made it I used French Vanilla pudding and regular graham crackers.  Everyone at worked liked it and several co-workers (men!) asked me for the recipe. The 2nd time I used chocolate pudding and cinnamon graham crackers!  IT WAS WONDERFUL!  I am anxious to make again and try pumpkin pudding and cinnamon graham crackers for the holidays!

This desert is so delicious and very easy to make.  For the chocolate frosting try the following: -1 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips -1/2 cup butter -1 cup heavy cream Mix the three ingreadients and place on the stove on low heat until chocolate melts.  I guarantee it will be the best frosting ever.  I will definately make this again.

Very similar to my recipe, but faster to make. I used the canned frosting and heated in the microwave and drizzled it over the top. I found it is too sweet if any more than that is added.

I really enjoyed this, and so did my guests.  I made some changes:  I did use a handmixer in order to get a pudding-type consistency.  I blended 3 boxes French Vanilla Instant Pudding with 4 cups very cold milk, then blended in 16 oz (2 reg. size Cool Whip) Cool Whip.  I used an entire box of graham crackers, for a total of three layers.  For the icing, I microwaved hot fudge frosting in the can until syrupy and then poured over the top.  This is best two or more days after making, so it's great to make ahead of an event in order to leave time for cleaning and preparing other foods closer to the event.  It has a very rich flavor and holds its shape well.  I might blend 1+ cup of creamy peanut butter to the pudding mixture next time for something different.  Delicious!

My family has made this recipe for over 25 years.  We have always used French Vanilla pudding.  I think it makes a world of difference in the flavor.  Homemade frosting is so much better, but whichever you use a quick microwaving of the frosting makes it so much easier to pour it over the graham crackers than to frost each cracker.  A fantastic quick and easy to prepare dessert the night before an event.

I made this for my family and received rave reviews!  I brought leftovers to work the next day and, again, had many compliments.  The funny thing was that a few others had made this recipe and commented on how theirs was fluffier.  A colleage asked how much milk I used and I replied, "There's no milk in the recipe."  I had to laugh when I printed her out a copy and saw there is, in fact, 3 cups of milk!  It was still delicious, and when I make it again, I might still leave out the milk.

I brought this to a church dinner, and it was the first to disappear! I didn't change a thing, and was excellent!  I did follow another's tip and microwaved the frosting before pouring it on.  Made it easy to spread around.

This is a repeat request when making a dish for a potluck.  I have used a jar of melted hot fudge in place of frosting.  This is a super easy crowd pleaser!

I used Chocolate tea biscuits - I dipped each one in a cup of hot coffee and then lined them up as the recipe calls - I used about 5 packages of those tea biscuits - on the final row, I ended up not covering it with another layer of the crackers, instead I left the pudding uncovered, and crumbled the remaining crackers and sprinkled the crumbs on top, I also added some chopped walnuts and chocolate chip cookies, and then I made zig-zag lines with Chocolate syrup (the one that you use for Ice cream) - covered it and stuffed it in the fridge over night - in the morning we had it with coffee - so delicious!

Very simple and delicious dessert.  Ended up having it in the fridge for about 30 hours before eating it, don't know that it needed that long but that's just how it worked out.  Will definitely make again and may try different cracker/pudding flavor combos.

This is a definite keeper.  The minute I saw the title, I wanted to make it for the eclair lover in my life.  I wasn't interested myself, but after licking the spoon when I mixed the milk/pudding/cool whip together, there was no way I was going to pass it up.  We couldn't even wait the four hours -- we finally broke into it after three.  It was fantastic and will be getting regular rotation in my dessert menus.

My mom used to make this all the time.  I was looking for a quick, easy recipe for a party that I knew picky eaters were going to be.  I came across this one and it was PERFECT.  I whipped it up in minutes.  I also took a cherry pie with me to the party.  I took 3/4 of the pie home and NONE of the eclair cake.  It was a huge hit.  I made it with the whipped chocolate frosting which I thought was yum, yum.  I'm keeping this for a trusty standby.

This recipe is so easy to make and always impresses!  I have made it many times as a cake, and recently got the idea to transform it into a pie for the holidays!  I used a graham cracker crust, filled with one layer of pudding mixture, one layer of graham crackers, and one layer of pudding mixture... then topped it off with graham cracker pieces and chocolate shavings (pudding mixture filled two 9" pie crusts.

This is a very nice and refreshing dessert.  I made it with chocolate turtle pudding because that was all I had and because this recipe can be altered with the variety of puddings and frostings available.  I will make this again and try other flavors as well.  Thank you for this versatile recipe.

I remember making this about 10 years ago and thought it was fantastic. I had forgotten about this recipe until recently and made it again. I found it waaay to sweet for me the second time around and even my 9 year old said it hurt her teeth it was so sweet.

This wasn't bad.  I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and put it in an 8x8 square pan.  It seemed the graham crackers over powered the pudding.  I made my own chocolate buttercream frosting, the taste was good, but kind of dry.  Next time even though I half the recipe, I will  keep the pudding mix and  the whipped topping as per the original recipe.

I used the backbone of this recipe but my changes are as follows: chocolate grahams, one box of sugar free vanilla pudding, one box of sugar free cheesecake pudding, and lite cool whip. Absolutely decadent and delicious! I think next time I will dip the grahams in some espresso or strong coffee for a tiramisu effect. Delicious!

This "cake" is not special enough to make for birthdays or special events. Many reviewers suggested that they rec'd requests for birthdays, etc., and that it was a big hit. Hmm? It's not a terrible recipe, because it's easy to make and tastes good, but it's nothing great. We're talking about graham crackers and pudding, basically. This is the type of thing that is perfect to make when you're craving a dessert and have all or most of the ingredients on hand. It's perfect to half for one or two people to keep on hand to snack on. It's far from being too sweet. It's mild. As for a special occasion or to present to important company, I'd skip this one and do a little more work.

This is delicious! I like to make it with sugar free pudding and light coolwhip.  Also, i substitute hot fudge topping for the frosting.  Heat it up in the microwave for a few seconds and it spreads on perfect!

Was looking for this recipe to make for home and work.  Everyone devoured it. I used the chocolate glaze from another review and it was awesome. It was cocoapowder, butter and milk. It came out with a darker chocolate flavor which complimented the vanilla nicely. Definitely a keeper:)

I thought this was pretty good.  I used French vanilla pudding instead of the plain vanilla.  I also halved the recipe and put it into a smaller mini version of the 13x9 pan.  I am not sure what size it was but it worked out beautifully and was more than enough.  I used one 3.5 box of French vanilla pudding, 1/2 tub of 8oz fat free whipped topping and I also ended up with 3 layers instead of 2.  I put one layer of graham crackers, pudding, crackers, pudding, crackers and pudding and finally the last layer of crackers.  For the frosting, I used Baker's brand dipping chocolate and melted it as instructed and poured this over the entire dish.  It worked out really well.  I thought it was simple and good!

I can't believe how easy this was to make! It was so good, that my husbands family asked me to bring it again to the next family gathering! I haven't been allowed to bring anything but deviled eggs for 17 YEARS!!!!! Microwaving icing 30 seconds made icing quick and easy!  LOVED IT!

I have made this twice now for two different parties. Both times I was ask for the recipe. It looks and taste as if it took hours. Everyone is surprised how easy it is. I do recommend using the cheesecake pudding mixes or at lease one of them. Also, it is a great idea to stick the icing in the microwave for 20 seconds or so, then you can just pour it over the cake and you get this really pretty smooth top. Make this it is great and way to easy!!! love it

Yes it is a sweet desert but what desert isn't especially those made with a lot of sweet ingredients to start?? Anyhow, it was delicious and adults and kids loved it.Only difference is that I used low fat honey graham crackers and 1/2 can vanilla frosting (all I had) and added 2 to 3 oz of melted baker's chocolate in the frosting then microwaved for 30 secs for spreadability.Its flavour reminded me of an eclair so this desert deserves it's name for sure.

This is a favorite family recipe, just wonderful! It really does need to set for it to taste best, although I have made it last minute and lightly sprayed the graham crackers in each layer with a water bottle. It helped them to get soft, like they're supposed to be!

I have not made this recipe for a while so I decided to bring it to a work potluck this week.  I cannot believe the rave reviews I received for something so simple to make.  I gave this recipe out to several in attendance.  This recipe is a permanent fixture in my recipe box.  Thank you!

Very quick and easy.  Much richer flavor if French Vanilla Pudding is used.    I, too, always heat the chocolate icing slightly so that it pours easily, smoothly covering the cake with little or no effort

I've been making this for years and it's always asked for when I have a office party.  The only difference is I microwave the frosting (dark fudge is what we like) for 30 seconds, stir until all melted and then pour it all over the top.  It's quicker and alot easier.  I have used cheesecake flavored pudding and it's great too.

This is yummy!  I did follow the advice of others and microwaved the frosting and poured it on, then refrigerated it.  Thanks for a great recipe that's fun and quick to put together!  I'm sure other flavors of pudding and frosting would be great to try too.  Our youth group devours this every time we bring it!

YUM YUM YUM!  Didn't think this was going to be anything other than the same ol' pudding recipe...wrong!  Really does taste like an eclair!  I used skim milk and light cool whip, and it was still amazing!  DEFINITELY warm the frosting in the microwave then drizzle it on top- soo much easier than spreading.  And it gets better as it sits.  Day 2 and it was perfect!  Will definitely be making this again soon!

I had to make a fast, but yummy dessert last new years day. I checked this website using quick no bake desserts. EVERYONE loved this easy recipe. I love it because its so quick and easy. I ended up making it 3 more times this year. I didn't use frosting for the chocolate I used hot fudge, heated up made it easy to pour over top.

Made my own 'fudge' like topping for this...it was very very very sweet, but good. Individual servings need not be large. Extremely easy and I think could be a pretty presentation.

I'm only giving this a 4 because I had an old version of the recipe that I think is better.  Try using french vanilla pudding instead of regular vanilla and always refrigerate overnight.  That will make it take exactly like an eclair.  Also, as someone else on the site noted, heat the frosting and pour it over the cake.  It will be smooth and shiny the next morning when you take it out of the fridge.  With those changes, this is a 5.

I had this at a dinner, and it was gooey and and I did not care for the taste--I was excited to have "eclair" cake but it didn't really taste like a real eclair. Pudding and canned frosting just don't do it for me I guess.

This was easy to prepare and would be good for pot lucks since it makes a large pan full. It is a pudding dessert though and not really cakey at all. It's good for a hot summer night dessert since it is pretty light and nice and cool and creamy. This is a great one for a beginning cook to start out with. Thanks.

I thought this was pretty good. I agree it was very easy, but to me, it seemed something was missing to put it over the top. Not sure what that is but I may try one of the suggestions of using cheesecake pudding and chocolate graham crackers instead of what the recipe calls for. My 3 year old son, however, who is actually picky about desserts, couldn't get enough of it!

To make this taste like a real eclair, use unsalted tops saltine crackers in place of the graham crackers.  Softened in the chilling process, at least overnight, and you will get a more realistic taste of eclair.  

Graham crackers are ok, but will never make it taste like an eclair.

I do not know how you could not give this recipe 5 stars! I made this for a small group of people and it was gone by the end of the night and they all wanted the recipe. It is great to give as a gift to someone who just had a baby because it can easily be stored in the fridge and served up whenever. It is so simple to put together and just has great flavor. Anytime I make it, this dish gets rave reviews. Thank you! This is a staple in my house and for all gatherings.

My 4 year-old and I made this.  We had fun making it AND it was easy.  I melted the frosting and poured it as others had suggested.  I took the cake to a BBQ and it was a big hit with everyone!  Thanks to Cathy for this one!

Oh my, this is awesome!  I used French Vanilla pudding and made the homemade chocolate frosting as suggested by Rachel H. I let the dessert set for 20 minutes prior to spreading the frosting.  Thank you!

This is one of my favorite desserts ever, I made it for the first time on Valentine's Day and then just made it again this afternoon! When my boyfriend tasted it, he asked where it had been his whole life. If you have a couple extra minutes, I recommend you use the Eagle Brand Chocolate Fondue recipe from this site for the chocolate on top:  Just mix together a 14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons water in a saucepan over medium heat until the chocolate chips are melted. Remove from heat and stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Pour over the eclair and spread with a spatula to cover everything. It's so good this way! The one I made today I used banana pudding in and it tastes good, too.

I was very skeptical as to whether or not this recipe was going to be impressive for my Valentine... and it was!  I actually did about 5 layers high and on top of the icing, I decorated it with edible sparkling red glitter gel.

I used cinnamon graham crackers and soaked them in milk for just a couple of seconds on each side.  I topped it with a homemade chocolate ganache.  I let it sit in the fridge for about a half hour before serving it up.  Delicous!

I served this at a holiday party and a lot of people enjoyed it.  But, for me, it was way too sweet with the thick chocolate frosting on top.  If I make this again I will drizzle the frosting on (warming it slightly first) and not have the frosting cover the whole thing.  Also, it is best served ice cold.

I have been making this exact recipe for about 10 years now. It really is so easy and absolutely delicious.  I think it came on the back of a cool whip container.  My big tip is that it is so much better the next day! Definitely a make ahead recipe. My brother and I used to fight over the left overs, now my children do.

Really easy to make and it tastes fantastic!  Be sure to make it 4 days ahead.  We have found that it takes about that long for the flavors to incorporate and for the texture to be "right".

This is quick easy and everyone loves it.  But of course I like to shake things up a bit.
So when the gingerbread gramhan crackers come out at the holidays and if you can find the pumpking pudding.  Go for it. I cannot tell you how many times I made it last year.  It is soooooo yummy.

Even though I did not think this reminded me of an elcair, I did think this recipe was good. My sister is constantly asking me to make it for her even though I tell her t is really easy to make. Definitely can't eat too much at one time though :)

MMMmmm. Terrific, easy dessert.  I wasn't sure how I'd like the texture of the Graham wafers, but it was fine.  I was afraid that just using vanilla pudding would be bland so I added a layer of raspberries (1 cup) to the second layer.  I made my own chocolate glaze.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Next time I'll try adding bananas or use banana pudding to taste like a banana cream pie.  UPDATE:  Made it with chocolate pudding and used sliced bananas on the layers.  YUMMMM.

Delicious!  The longer it sits in the fridge, the tastier it gets. I used the whole tub of frosting (microwaving it for 30 seconds for easy spreading) and thought it was a little too chocolatey.  Everyone else thought it was perfect though.  

Definitely a keeper.  It took less than 10 minutes to put together.  Perfect summertime dessert!

Is this an awesome dessert?  Yes.  Have I seen it at too many potlucks to count?  Yes!  Try it with cheesecake flavored instant pudding instead of the vanilla.  You won't be sorry.

Serves up really pretty with all the layers intact.  I got rave reviews with lots of requests for the recipe.  It was a little light for me.  I may try it sometime with a richer layer (add cream cheese and sugar to pudding or sweetened condensed milk)but for most everyone else it was fab.

Tastes just like an eclair cake would taste!  I took it over to a friends house for Sunday dinner.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitly make again.  Soooooo so easy to make and put together.  I made it the night before so the graham crackers were soft.

YUMMY....I made this for family and it didn't last long...the only change i made was to omit the chocolate frosting..instead i melted semi sweet choc. pieces, and drizzled over the top..gave it candy flavor and wasn't too rich...definitely a make again recipe...

I forgot the milk!  Which meant it was very sticky and hard to spread.  However, it still turned out very good :)  Next time I will remember the milk and hopefully it will be easier to spread.

I used extra creamy cool whip topping and 3/4 of a can of milk chocolate frosting.

Fantastic dessert!  We've made this a few times now and have found for the best result it should definitely be refrigerated at least 4 hours.  Otherwise the graham crackers still have a crunch which doesn't work as well as when they're soft.

I made this with soymilk and I also didn't understand the whipped topping description.  I didn't realize that the topping is the PRE-whipped topping as opposed to the 8 oz. carton that is thawed to pour like cream and then whipped.  So, my Eclair Cake was runny and because of the soy milk, tasted like ... soy.  Here's what I'm going to try next - vanilla soy and pre-whipped topping.  I'll letchya know the results!

Made it as a school project. My daughter was assigned to make a dish representing Monaco (which is influenced by French cusine). Easy to make and transport. It was perfect for moms and kids. Everybody loved it!! I think that a low sugar version would taste great.

AMAZING! This is one of my favorites because it's so delicious and easy to make. The trick is really to get the graham crackers soggy (the longer time in the fridge, the better). I always use dark chocolate frosting for more of an eclair-y taste. A real tummy pleaser!

Very easy to make. I used low-fat graham crackers to help out on some of the fat grams.  Randall my husband said it was light, not overly sweet and ver very good.  I'm sure I will be making this many times over. It is a keeper in my recipe box.  Thanks for the recipe I am always looking for something good and simple to make.  God bless you....

Very easy to make, and yummy. My brother, who never likes anything sweet, liked it very much. It made me happy to finally see him enjoy a dessert that I made :) But I think I would use only half the can of the chocolate frosting next time, because the chocolate can be way too sweet.

My 13-year-old son took one bite and exclaimed, "Mom, this is good!"  Hard to believe something this easy to make is so delicious.  I heated the opened tub of chocolate frosting on 40 percent power in the microwave for a minute, stirred it, poured it on and then spread it around a little.  Ate it after 3 1/2 hours of refrigeration--we couldn't wait!

This was very popular at our last cookout.  Because it is frosted, it looks like a typical ordinary cake. Everyone was delighted to cut into it and find its rich, creamy goodness.

Yummmmmy!  I agree with the previous post about the frosting.  I like to make the cake 1 day ahead so that the graham crackers won't be too crunchy, by then the crackers are nice and soft.

Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.  I had lost mine.  The only thing that I do different is take the chocolate frosting.  Remove the lid, take off the foil and microwave for about one to two minutes or until chocolate turns liquid. Poor over cake smooth with knife then refrigerate for four to six hours so cake flavors can set. This gives it a high gloss look and makes you think of ice cream cones dipped in chocolate.  Thanks for the post, I lost mine.

I made several dishes for a friend who had leg surgery and sent this dessert over too. I used chocolate pudding instead of the vanilla and from what I heard, it was a hit; not only with the kids but with the adults too! Thanks so much!

Very easy and tasty....I whipped this up over the weekend, I didn't have the full amount of ingredients, so I made a smaller dish.  I will make this again. I think I'll use the french vanilla pudding.

This tasted pretty good. I used honey grahams, butter pecan pudding, and dark chocolate frosting from a can I melted in the micro for 30 seconds and then poured on top. I probably ended up using more coolwhip than specified, as I am metric and I never know if that sort of packaging is weight or volume, so I added coolwhip until it tasted good but wasn't too fluffy (basically aimed for the texture of my home-made pastry cream) since the cool whip is also labelled in ml's. Will probably make again, I want to try the rocky road variation, or maybe try it with other wafer cookies.

i just have to say that this is the easiest thing to make! i made it for thanksgiving, and it was gone within an hour. i didnt have all vanilla pudding, so i used cheescake pudding instead. i put it together the night before, and didnt have extra room in the fridge, so i put it in the freezer. thawed the next morning, and melted half a can of chocolate frosting in the microwave, and poured on top.  it was excellent, and i will make this again.

YUM!!!! I took the suggestion of another and let the cake sit in the refrigerator overnight for the crackers to soften a bit. Other than that, took no time at all. VERY EASY.

This is excellent and soooo easy. I could hardly believe it. I guess that I've had it before but never could have imagined how easy it is. I used skim milk and fat free cool whip to "lighten" it up. I did melt the frosting a little in the micro before spreading. I refrigerated for about 6 hrs but I'm thinking it may be even better after a little longer. We took it to a potluck and unfortunately had nothing left in the pan:)

I made this to take to my DH's family reunion last summer, and despite the ridiculously huge amount of food present, there were no left overs of this!  People were wandering around raving about this dessert.  I made it the night before and it was perfect the following afternoon - not crunchy, but not soggy.  Easy and delicious!

Easy recipe and a big hit.  Melting the frosting as others recommended makes an easy recipe even easier.  Thanks for sharing.

I have to say that I was disappointed with this recipe.  While it was easy to make, and most of my guests liked it, I thought it tasted kind of bland.  I probably won't be making this one again anytime soon.

Excellent dessert!  Very easy I might add.  I agree with other users to let the dessert sit overnight which allows the graham crackers to soften to a cake like consistency.  Delicious!

I have to say I was very skeptical about this recipe. I always bake eveything from scratch, and usually find no bake recipes to be lacking in flavor. But I took a chance and boy am I glad I did! Wonderful flavor and consistancy for a no-bake dessert! My husband and co-workers loved it, and so did I. Thanks for sharing cathy.

Great recipe, with one change...use low sodium club crackers rather than graham crackers...and THEN, yes, it tastes just like and eclair.

Soo good, but very rich and very sweet!! I might add a bit more milk next time so the pudding isn't so thick.

I don't know what went wrong, but the pudding mixture never set and was very runny. Almost like there was too much milk. This ruined the cake because the graham crackers became soggy. The flavor was very good.

I've made this several times, and it's always a hit.  Everytime I've shared it with a new audience, someone has asked for the recipe.  I use Low Sodium Club Crackers instead of the graham crackers, which I think is closer to an eclair.  Enjoy!

This is a great recipe to have on file.  Particularly in the summer because it doesn't require turning on the oven at all --- big plus for those scorching summer days.  There are so many versions of this recipe out there it really doesn't matter which one you use.  I will say however that it seems easier just to use the container of chocolate frosting for the top rather than melting chocolate chips because you just pour the frosting on straight from the can once you nuke it for a bit.

This recipe is wonderful.  It really is quick and delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and make it in a 9 inch square pan as I thought the full recipe would be too much for four of us.  As it turned out, I wish I had made the larger size as it went fast.  I also used fat-free pudding and lite cool whip and it was still great.

I've made this recipe many times and it is always a hit. You have to be sure to give it time to sit, overnight at least. I've also made it with sugar-free pudding, lite Cool Whip and lite frosting. Taste almost as great, but with much less guilt :-)

I followed the recipe along with the suggestion to put the container of frosting in the microwave for 30 seconds to make it easier to spread.  It was perfect!  My husband is a big fan of chocolate eclairs & he loved this desert.  I will be making this again and again.

It was good, but the store bought icing does not taste as good as a homemade chocolate sauce would.  Other than that, it was pretty good.

Exceptionally Good ! You do have to microwave the chocolate frosting for 30 seconds or make your own chocolate sauce ( mix 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 stick of butter bring to boil for 1 min asd tdp Vanilla ) . Next time I will dip the crackers in Amaretto for a Tiramisu taste !

My family’s favorIte. I make it a couple of times each month. I have been using French Vanilla pudding as I believe it adds a little more flavor.

My family enjoyed it but my husband said it wasn’t guest or dinner party worthy. It’s a very casual type dessert.

Super easy and delicious. Followed other reviewers suggestions and used chocolate graham crackers and made my own chocolate sauce. Everyone really enjoyed this dessert. A keeper recipe I plan to make again and again. Next time will try regular graham crackers and cheese cake pudding. Thanks for this great recipe!

Assemble then put in fridge for a couple hours before frosting. Heat frosting a little bit and spread on top of Graham's. Back in fridge till serving.

OMG delicious! I substituted a 7oz package of  vanilla mousse I had instead of pudding so no whip cream needed and only half the milk. It does take an entire box of graham crackers. Will make again ?

My granddaughter and I made this and it is delicious! 
The only thing we did differently is we heated the frosting in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Stir well and just pour it over the top.
Waaaay easier than trying to spread it.

Love this as is, but I usually make my own frosting. It tastes better, imho, and isn't much more difficult than store-bought. 2 cups confectioners (powdered) sugar, 4 T milk, 3T cocoa powder. Mix together, pour, and spread! If you want more frosting, just up everything by half, but I think it is sweet enough without more frosting. Delicious! Otherwise, I make this recipe as is. I do think it would be delicious w/coffee brushed over the Graham crackers and espresso powder in the glaze, with different flavored puddings, or with cinnamon or chocolate crackers. Yummy and versatile

Everyone raves over this cake when I make it.  When we have a dinner at church, people always request that I bring this.  I also make a "diabetic friendly" version also for my stepdad with sugar free ingredients.

Maybe banana pudding instead.  Tasted like a dessert from a cafeteria.  Hubby and I were not impressed.  My parents liked it though.

Only a 4 star because I made a couple of changes , then had to rush the time. It tasted great with my changes, I used cooked pudding, because I can’t stand the taste of instant, but I didn’t let it cool completely, before blending in fresh whipped cream, also can’t stand Cool Whip. Only had 3 hours to chill, and result was Eclair Soup. I should have thought about Cool Whip probably having a stiffening agent that fresh whipped doesn’t have, although I added a teaspoon of cream of tartar while whipping. Anyone know anything else I might have messed up? Otherwise, people liked the taste, even though they had to eat it with a spoon. That’s what I get when I only bake for company, and always want to try something new, and always want to tweak it!

I took this cake to my daughters for Christmas.  Everyone LOVED it....and no one knew I made it with sugar-free pudding and sugar-free frosting!!!  They were all shocked when I told them.  I have a feeling the family will be requesting this cake often.  Yummy cake and so easy to make!

I grew up with my mom making this and now I do it for gatherings, as requested by the attendees. The only thing I do different than this recipe is; instead of using regular icing which is hard to spread on this bc of the pudding, I use chocolate topping for ice cream which hardens and spreads super easily.

This is always a hit during the holidays! Our little trick is to heat the frosting (in the container) and pour over top. It’s easy and always comes out smooth and perfect! 
*remove lid and foil from the frosting and heat in 20 second intervals until melted

I have made this several times and it is delicious. I used good quality graham crackers (the store brand crackers didn't soften enough),  french vanilla pudding, I nuked the frosting for 30 seconds and it poured beautifully, and I made this the day before
serving it. So easy!!

perhaps the easiest dessert to make and takes no time at all.  Best if you make it the day before an event, although a few hours  will do if you're in a pinch.

Dairy Free adjustments - I used vanilla soy milk instead of cows milk. This turned out fine but I need to add one extra package of instant vanilla putting, making it 3 cups of soy milk vanilla to 3 packages of instant pudding mix. Everyone loved it! I cut the pieces big, too yummy!

This is an easy and delicious recipe.....the first time i made it exactly like directions said....found that the frosting was way to sweet for me. The second time i did it, i used hersheys magic shell instead giving it a thinner layer of chocolate that was just enough....everyone loved it

I have also made this with pumpkin pudding, but instead of frosting on top I use cool whip, things like this should sit over night to absorb all that great flavor, cinnamon grains crackers are a must for me

I've enjoyed this dessert many times at boy scout events, and decided to try it myself to make for Easter.  I did a test batch and halved the recipe, and warmed the frosting in the microwave, otherwise no subs.  Delicious!

This is easy and a good crowd-pleaser. I made it with chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, because that's what my kids like, and I think it was a little too much chocolate. It would have tasted more like an eclair with vanilla. I always use real whipped cream instead of Cool-Whip, I substitute 8oz/1c whipped cream and one packet of Whip-It stabilizer, optionally add a tablespoon or two of sugar when you whip it. I cut this recipe in half to make a 9" pie. I used packaged chocolate frosting because I was in a hurry, but I think next time I will make a ganache instead.

We've been making this in my family for over 40 years. Had it as a child however we make our own frosting which I think makes this cake even better. We also let it sit in the refrigerator over night. You can follow the recipe on the bake of any unsweetened cocoa bake. Add the butter, milk and powder sugar as the frosting recipe calls for. Yum

Any weeknight when guests are coming and you need a quick and super easy no-fuss dessert, this is it.  I used chocolate graham crackers, cheesecake pudding and a French vanilla.   Nuked the "canned" frosting for just a few seconds and used about 1/2 a can.   Five adults and 3 kids wiped it out with a dab left over to go into honey's lunch the next day.

This is one of my go-to dessert recipes. If you make it the night before it is awesome when you get ready to eat it. I recommend heating the frosting for about 30 seconds because that makes it much easier to spread. I almost hate sharing this recipe because then everyone will know how easy it is.

This is a pretty good quick dessert.  I made a chocolate ganache for the top and that was delicious.  Probably not an "eclair" but a pretty good dessert for graham crackers nd pudding.  I would try banana pudding next time and maybe sliced bananas or strawberries for a banana split theme.

Easy-peasy. My girls love to make it and eat it; it's not my favorite but that keeps me and my husband eating less of it ;) we half the recipe and make it in a pie pan bc it's always just a dessert for our family of 4. Also we make the 3T cocoa, water, butter, and 1/2 C powdered sugar icing as one reviewer suggested instead of the store bought icing. This has a more concentrated chocolate/less sugary taste and I like that.  Thank you for the recipe!

Easy, quick, and a hit with the crowd.  I made a few adjustments.  I only used one vanilla pudding packet, and doubled the whipped cream - made from scratch with whipping cream, real vanilla extract and confectioners sugar.  The resulting pie was very light but rich in flavor, especially the frosting top.  I think if I make this again I'd add a thin layer of whipped cream over the top graham crackers, then only dust with cocoa powder.

I made this exactly as written and it was ok. There was absolutely nothing wrong with it, it's just kind of flat. Don't get me wrong, look at the ingredients of course it's good, it just really tasted like what it was. I guess I was somehow expecting the end result to be more than just the sum of its parts :)

I made this, but I didn't have any graham crackers, so I used graham cracker crumbs instead.  I also put a layer of mini chocolate chips and I made the chocolate sauce out of 3 tbsp butter, 1.5 cups powdered sugar, and 3 tbsp cocoa.

Easy and Yummy, dipped crackers in milk before making layers to speed absorption of pudding because I only had 4 hours for it to sit, put frosting can in the microwave for  40 seconds and stir and then just pour over cake it's easier and prettier, turned out great!

This is an ice box cake.  I agree, use Fr.Vanilla pudding for custard taste.  When I am lazy and don't feel like making a ganache, I use a jar of hot fudge sauce. It will set better in the frig and look shiny and smooth like eclair icing.

I have made this many times and it is a family favorite. The only difference in my recipe is that I use Hot Fudge ice cream topping instead of the frosting. Wonderful stuff, never any left:)

It is easier to melt the  icing in the microwave for 30 seconds then spread on top of the graham crackers and let the icing set. A good recipe quick and easy and delicious.

I've made this cake before and love it, but I just have to say this. The suggestion to microwave the frosting for 15-30 seconds is a simple, yet genius idea. I don't make this recipe nearly as often as I like because it's incredibly difficult to frost graham crackers that are on a bed of pudding. Like, I want to poke out my eyeballs when I'm done, difficult. But the frosting softening makes it a snap, and I might be whipping this up a lot more often now. I love the eclair cake as is, but I also make a variation with chocolate Graham's, cheesecake pudding, and cheesecake frosting. Wowza!

The family loved it,but me not as much....I'll definitely make it again for them. I too used French vanilla pudding and made a chocolate ganache instead of using canned frosting.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I made it this morning, and I was skeptical that anything so simple could be worthwhile. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  I used up a can of german chocolate frosting and used half sugar free pudding mix, since that was all I had on hand.  The whole family enjoyed it. Thanks again.

Made this for a potluck party Friday, I thought it was good, but the friends RAVED!! I could not believe the compliments I got.  Of coarse I had fresh strawberry rhubarb pie at home!  But all aside, I like to have something always in my pantry for a quick dish to bring and this will be perfect! I made this exactly as the recipe called, however I used dark chocolate frosting, but that isn't much of a change (and dark chocolate is healthy isn't it?)

This is a great recipe that I've used to feed large crowds. My only advice is to not use store-brand ingredients. I have made with store-brand and name brand (ie; Nabisco, Jello, Betty Crocker). When made with store-brand, it really had a terrible aftertaste. Likewise with banana pudding. Use real Nilla wafers and jello pudding - you'll be much happier with the results!

This is an AWESOME recipe!  It is so ridiculously easy to make.  I made it as is, and heated the frosting like others recommended.  Next time I will make my own frosting and try it that way.  Although I really do not see how it could taste any better.

Great recipe!  Try putting the frosting in the microwave for about 30-45 seconds before spreading on the cake.  It's much easier!

Oh my goodness!!!  I am a slave to my stove on purpose; I love to cook. But when someone told me about yummy desserts that take almost no time to prepare I'm on it .  A friend described an eclair cake as a family recipe but declined giving the recipe out so on to google I went and found this insanely delicious and super easy recipe.  I read a lot of the reviews and made some of the changes mentioned: used french vanilla pudding mix and nuked the frosting to make it spread so much easier.  I also refrigerated the cake a good 24 hours but I have to say even 2 days later it was stupendous.  You MUST try this one!!!  So tasty and so easy

This was a very easy and simple recipe to make which I loved. The only thing that everyone who ate this said, including myself, is that the topping is VERY VERY sweet. I personally love sweet, but this was over the top sweet. So I recommend eliminating the chocolate frosting the top and maybe just add an additional layer of pudding. Also I used chocolate graham crackers to give it more flavor and it was a hit! I will make this again, but just not use the chocolate frosting.

Yet another fantastic easy cake that looks like you spent hours on it (the other is the coconut "poke cake" on this site, which I highly recommend as well). It's much more delicious than it would seem from the simple ingredients. I agree with reviewers that found the vanilla pudding filling a bit "bland" but then, so is the pastry cream that fills an eclair! But the recipe can be customized and the filling is so delicious and versatile, I'm going to try it with a simple trifle and other fruit desserts.

I'm optimistically giving this five stars, though that wasn't my result.  I think the thickness of the layers may be crucial to a good result.  Mine were too thick and completely overwhelmed the cracker layer.  It's definitely easy to make and would lend itself to many variations.  Using real whipped cream, for example, would be excellent, though you'd have to make sure it would all be eaten pretty quickly.

Excellent and so easy! I don't care for dark chocolate but I did use the chocolate fudge frosting which seems more "eclair-like." This is so easy, it's a dessert I make while on vacation when we are staying in a condo. A quick and simple way to enjoy homemade dessert while enjoying sun and sand!

I tried this recipe and found it bland with the plain vanilla and the frosting was way too sweet. So I changed it a little. I swapped out one of the vanilla's for a French vanilla. I usually double the recipe making it easier. I do 2 vanilla's for a layer, 2 French vanilla's with the whipped topping mixed in, for the 2nd layer. Then instead of the frosting. I use chocolate pudding. The dark chocolate is the best but if I can't find it. I use regular chocolate. This is super simple and always a crowd pleaser. I have taken this to several potlucks and always bring 2 pans of this. Normally 1 pan is empty in no time and I am able to bring home just enough for my family of 5 to have 1 helping a piece.

Unbelievably easy and delicious.  I'm wondering how caramel could be introduced to this recipe. Also thought their may be a low fat/low calorie way to make this as well but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time.  Maybe reduced fat crackers, frosting and milk and pudding.  This is so easy and great to take if you are a guest for dinner.Definitely a keeper.

I've used this similiar recipe from my mom. But used chocolate syrup for the topping. I've also changed the pudding from vanilla to chocolate to banana flavors. It's good either because you can mix up the layers.

I love chocolate eclair cake, but I always make one alteration when manking it. If the chocolate frosting is melted prior to putting it on the cake, then there is no struggle to spread it evenly. You simply pour it over the cake and spread it around with a spatula. Refrigeration sets it once more.

This is a family favorite.  One tip:  put the frosting in the microwave for a few seconds; and, then, the frosting will be a pourable consistency and will be much easier to spread on the top of the cake.

This one is a keeper!! YUMMY!!
I made this dessert for my hubby's bday.
He loves Boston cream pie so I thought this 
would be to his pleasing...It sure is!!
He couldn't stop after one large serving.
And he also could not believe the recipe is semi-homemade since I usually bake from scratch.
Things I changed...  
*I used french vanilla pudding mixes.
*I topped with chocolate ganache recipe submitted by INGRIDEVOGEL via allrecipes (but I used  organic pure vanilla in place of the rum in the ganache recipe)super easy to make!!
**The last thing...I used a smaller clear casserole dish (8x10x3)approx...It made my slices of dessert more dense..If you use this smaller pan you only need about 1/2 recipe for the ganache topping.
If you are using 13x9 pan you need about 2/3 of the ganache recipe.

I used two 5.1 ounces of pudding. I kept the milk the same and the whipped topping the same. 
I also used supreme whipped chocolate frosting. It was easy to frost and tasted yummy!
A great easy and fast dessert!

I used cinnamon graham crackers and can honestly say I wouldn't again - it really deters from the flavor of the pudding.  Other than that, it was a very quick and easy to create dessert - I made it the day before for a birthday cake and my family loved it!

Soooo good! I made it and found eclair heaven! lol  I will be making this again and again. Thanks for such a awesome recipe. The only thing I did that was different was that I didnt use the whole tub of whipped topping. I would say I used 3/4 of it. Also found out to only use a thin layer of chocolate frosting. A little goes a long way.

My family loved this recipe.  I was nervous the crackers would get soggy, but turned out delicious.  I didn't have two full packages of vanilla so poured a half package of banana pudding  and it was perfect.  Not too much banana, but my family loved it.  I also used a homemade chocolate frosting and thought maybe next time make one laye of the pudding half chocolate and half vanilla.

So very very easy. I was woried about how to serve it because it was so mushy when i put it into the fridge. But letting it set overnight made a big difference. i was able to cut it into little rectangles to serve. I did try to make it a little more "healthy" by using low fat graham crackers, one sugar free pudding and sugar free whipped cream. It tasted so fantastic, there was no way you could tell. I bought it in to an office party, and they were still talking about it a week later. Definatly a keeper.

A huge hit with adults and kids alike. I use chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. We also whip our own heavy whipping cream and use it as a layer in between the crackers in addition to the choc pudding. It makes it taste more like a real eclair!

Love it!  This is going to be my next birthday cake even if I have to make it myself!  I have made it using French vanilla pudding and regular vanilla and prefer the flavor of the French vanilla.  I also made my own chocolate buttercream because I think most prepared chocolate frostings are gross.  I let the cake sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours before serving to allow the graham crackers to soften.  I have found that if I serve it too soon the graham crackers will still be crunchy and eclairs should not crunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good, but not over-the-moon great. It tastes exactly like its ingredients -- pudding and frosting, with a little graham cracker. It's a dessert to make for the family, but I wouldn't bring it to a party. Also, save yourself a bunch of calories by skipping adding whipped topping into the pudding; the pudding just tastes like pudding, and isn't discernibly better with the addition of whipped topping.

I didn't want to make this recipe a day ahead so I dredged the graham crackers in milk before placing them in the recipe. I used homemade frosting but my family felt that the frosting over powered the pudding so I removed it (yes I did) and used chocolate glaze instead, perfect.  I also used the French vanilla pudding and vanilla cool whip.  Great go to dessert for office too!

This is very similar to an eclair.  It's not a very "elegant" dessert, but it is delicious.  My 3yo loves it.  To make spreading the frosting easier, put the container in the microwave for 20 or 30 seconds, stir, and then just pour it over the top, it's MUCH easier than trying to spread it on.

I had my doubts, but this came out GREAT! My hubby and 14 yo son are such dessert snobs, I was worried. They like "plain vanilla" everything. But, they loved this dessert!!! YAY!!! I didn't change anything.  I can add this to my dessert menu choices! THANK YOU!!!

YUMMY!!!! For an effortless recipe this was delicious! Will be keeping it as a favorite for a long time. I have to say though I did drizzle some chocolate between layers(if you're a chocoholic as I am)and also mixed the chocolate frosting with some left over whipped topping so the textures  compliment each other. ENJOY!!!!

This turned out to be one of my new favorite recipes!  Me and my sister actually fought over the last piece.  One suggestion about the icing...microwave it just a little bit then pour it over the top.  It spreads a lot easier that way.

Recently made this for the first time. Everyone loved it! It was so easy to make. I read the reviews and melted the chocolate frosting as was suggested and it worked well. Will definitely make this again soon, especially in the summer since it's "no bake".

I made this for a potluck. It won "best dish" and I felt a little guilty since it was so easy to make. I used one box of vanilla and one of cheesecake pudding mix. I also microwaved chocolate whipped icing just enough to melt it, and poured it over the top very easily. I also used skim milk and light whipped topping to make it a little "healthier". This stays absolutely delicious for several days in the fridge!

This was turned out well.  It tasted good, but I wouldn't call it great.  However, it was cheap, and really easy and quick to make.  I may try this again with a few of my own "upgrades".

Outstanding! I made it with French Vanilla pudding and heated the frosting in the microwave for easier spreading. One suggestion. Make it when there will be more than 2 of you at home to eat it, otherwise you can't stop eatng it and it's gone in 3 days!

This recipe was fantastic!  Super easy and so good!  I took this to a ladies potluck at my church and it looked like the dish was wiped clean!  Several people asked me for the recipe.  I am making it again for some friends that are coming over today.  I also microwave the chocolate frosting for 30 seconds before adding it to the top.

This cake was amazing.  I did not change a thing but next time I make it I may try the chocolate ganache that others are recommending.  I have made it twice in the last week for two different parties and everyone has raved about it and asked for the recipe!  Very easy!

I had my kids make this (5 & 7) .  It was easy for them to do (with help) and the results tasted great.  I would not call this a "cake"...more of a pudding dessert (trifle?).  Nevertheless, it is VERY yummy!

I tried this for my boyfriend and his roommate and it came out great! They loved it and I am definitely making this one for the holidays. It's extremely easy...tips: the store was out of regular Vanilla so I used French Vanilla pudding mix; melt the frosting so you can just pour it on top; I refrigerated mine over night.

Super easy!!  I used the suggestion of another to soak graham crackers on each side in milk for a couple of seconds since I was making this last minute.  I also used whipped chocolate frosting & microwaved a few seconds to make spreading easy.  Turned out delicious!

This turned out so good.  I put the frosting in the microwave for 1 minute.  I only had one vanilla pudding mix, so I did 1 vanilla, and 1 pistacio.  And I only had strawberry whipped topping so I used that.  It was amazing.  How can something this simple taste so good?!  I will keep pondering that thought while I chow down.  Try this recipe!!!

What a great treat! The graham cracker texture with the pudding is creamy and the flavor is yummy. Definately melt and pour the choc icing on top for an eclair-like glaze.      For more sophisticated flavors, use cook/serve pudding with homemade whipped cream and frosting :)

Followed recipe exactly. Microwaved the frosting. Tasted wonderful. Had some people think it was tiramisu, so you know the recipe is good when you can fool people into thinking you made that! Tasted just like a Tasteycake Eclair.

Simple! I took the advice of others and used French Vanilla pudding.  I also did the chocolate ganache instead of using the chocolate pudding.  It came out fantastic!!!  My boyfriend loved it and I'm making it again today for a party tomorrow.  It's better if you let it sit overnight

I take back the previous 4 stars and upgrade this to a 5.  I've made it 4 times since last week bc people are addicted to it including myself.  I had to throw away the last half of the cake bc I was constantlygoing to the fridge for "just one more bite.".

YUM. So good and easy! Since I needed it in less than 4 hours, I took another suggestion and dipped the graham crackers in milk before layering. I used reduced fat and sugar ingredients and it was still good. Also topped with reduced sugar frosting that had been microwaved. Will make again.

This is the recipe I use to bribe my kids.  The yummiest ever. My mom made this and now I found the recipe on allrecipes.  If my kids had their pick we would eat this every week. Perfectly done!

Fast, easy, delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except for slightly melting the chocolate frosting to make it easier to spread, and everyone loved it - even a few people who said they hate eclairs.  I didn't think it tasted like an eclair at all, but it certainly did look like one.  I made it on Saturday for a party Sunday, and then ate leftovers on Monday - I thought it tasted even better on Monday.  Going to make this again this weekend for a church dinner.

This was super quick and easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out terrific!! I used "whipped" chocolate frosting, which was really easy to melt on to the top by popping it in the microwave for 30sec as other reviews have said, and it was perfect! I brought this to a potluck and they finished every last bite! So good!!

This was good and really easy.  It took me 17 minutes to make from start to finish.  You can't ask for better than that.  Great for taking to that potluck or office party. Also very inexpensive to make.

This dessert is great and so simple! I used one pudding package instead of two by accident, but it still turned out thick enough once it had refrigerated for a few hours.  I melted my frosting for 30 seconds in the microwaves as others suggested.  Very good-- thanks for the recipe!

I bake A LOT and make some very elaborate/labor intensive desserts but I needed a no-bake recipe for Father's day. This was PERFECT and so easy. I couldn't believe how good it tasted with so little effort. I added 1tsp. of carmel extract to the pudding mixture and made my own fudge icing. It was great! Thank you!

This is one of  my all time favorite desserts.  I try and make it a little "better" for you by using SF/FF instant pudding, Coolwhip free, skim milk, reduced fat graham crackers, and good old regular fatty chocolate frosting on top.  Problem is I love it too much, cant keep portions under control!!  The taste is still excellent, even with the healthier version!

This is a great recipe, I make mine a lighter recipe by using no sugar, no fat pudding mix, 2% milk, lite whip cream, no fat ritz crackers and no sugar chocolate frosting.  It tastes like real eclairs!

OMG! I can't even explain how delicious this is! I will say this, there were two pieces left over one night. We had both already had 2 pieces that day BUT we knew that if we didn't eat that third piece, our daughter was going to eat it the following day. So, we dove in! Yummmm! We just had to do some extra workouts for the next couple of days. :-)

My coworkers loved this (I'm talking 2nd and 3rd helpings), and several people asked for the recipe.  Heating the frosting made it a snap to spread over the last layer of graham crackers.

I made this for a superbowl party and it was a hit! I made it the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I did use French Vanilla pudding and dark chocolate frosting but really didn't change a thing! My husband was hoping there would be leftovers so he could eat some more at home! I will make this again for sure!

It's not gourmet, but it sure is good! I used MEME's suggestion & recipe for the chocolate topping rather than store-bought frosting. Very simple, but if go that route, double MEME's topping or else it's a bit skimpy and the graham crackers wind up being visible under the chocolate :) I have always loved this type of cake, and it works great with "healthified" ingredients, too. I used sugar-free Cool Whip and sugar free pudding, but couldn't healthy up the graham crackers and chocolate sauce--perfect combo! I did tint my pudding pink for Valentine's. Thanks for the recipe!

Five stars because it is so easy, is made with items I always have on hand, and gets rave reviews every time I make it. We prefer it with Jello French Vanilla pudding and Duncan Hines Dark Fudge frosting. Tastes better the longer it sits.

So good!  I did follow the recommendations of other reviewers and used only 2 cups of milk and I microwaved the container of frosting so I could pour it on top.  It worked out great!! I also sprinkled some jimmies on top and it was super cute! I kept it in the fridge for about 6 hours. I took it to a party and everyone raved about it!

I use fat free cool whip and low fat graham crackers and about 12 oz of cool whip. I use French Vanilla pudding and microwave the frosting for about 30 seconds. This is a big hit with my family and is a sinch to make!

I've had this several times before and was hoping that this recipe might be the one that makes me LOVE it, but it wasn't.  Considering the amount of positive feedback, I made it exactly as written.  While it was good, it wasn't a spectacular dessert and I'd only make it again for the kids and not as a dessert to a dinner party.  Thanks though!

This is a wonderful recipe because it's easy, requires few ingredients and tastes good. It's not too sweet, at all. For those saying it's too sweet, why eat dessert? I didn't think it would taste like an eclair, but it actually does. I halfed the recipe and made it in a square cake pan. I used Betty Crocker (my fav for baking goods) Dark Chocolate frosting. I chilled the cake for 30 mintues as recommended by some reviewers, and microwaved the frosting slightly for easy spreading, as was also recommened. Awesome recipe!!

I made this for own household first before the get together I was going to make it for. My daughter loved it. I made a few changes to fit our household. First I used sugar free French Vanilla pudding, 1% milk and lite whipped topping. I also got dark chocolate frosting which I think made it a bit sweet but it looked great. I also melted the chocolate in the microwave for 40 sec. and poured it over the graham cracker and pudding mixture. All in all I love it.

I thought this was good. It is really sweet. Great for a quick good tasting dessert. I think I'll try it with a different flavor pudding and maybe try making my on chocolate glaze. The frosting was a bit much.

This was an awesome recipe that my whole family loved.  I've tried it with several different puddings, and it changes the flavor of the whole dessert.  I use it with fat free milk and it provides a lower fat dessert that my whole family will eat (and never know the difference).  Try fat free sweetened condensed milk with milk chocolate, white chocolate, or butterscotch morsels to make various flavored frostings that you can mix and match!

This was definitely an easy and inexpensive dessert to put together but I don't see what all the rave reviews are all about.  I thought this was a very blah dessert with not much flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

What a great dessert! Followed ingredients, although I used 1 box of fat free/sugar free box of vanilla pudding mix. I also used another reviwers recipe for the chocolate frosting. Overall an quick and easy dessert, very cost effective as well.

This is a wonderful, easy dessert! Every time I make this I get tons of compliments. I have made this several times now, it's delicious. To spread the frosting on top, I soften the frosting in the microwave for a few seconds so it's easier to spread. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. Thanks (:

This is very good, very easy, and tastes remarkably like an eclair.  I did not have frosting, so made a simple topping of semisweet chips, butter, and confectioner's sugar.  Will rely on this for a quick standby!

Oh my!  This is SO GOOD.  I made mine with french vanilla pudding and melted the frosting as recommended.  Great taste and so easy to prepare.  Not just like an eclair, but the ingredients taste awesome together and that satiny smooth top and layering effect make it so pretty.  Can't wait to try it with chocolate grahams and cheesecake pudding!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is super easy to make!! And, it tastes great! Takes nearly a whole box of graham crackers for the 9x13 pan. Everyone one loved this and you couldn't tell I used the sugar free pudding mix and light cool whip to cut down on the calories.

This recipe is fabulous!  What I call a great value recipe - super easy to make, few ingredients needed, inexpensive and great taste!!!  I used 4 cups of milk instead of 3 by accident and it still turned out great.  I also added some crushed walnuts to the top for some extra taste.  Next time I would make my own frosting rather than buying the pre-made stuff. I used the low calorie/low-fat versions of most ingredients - coolwhip, jello and frosting.

The dessert is awesome! It tastes good and it's very easy to make. It won the "creamiest" award at the church bake off. The only suggestion I had was to leave the cake in the refrigerator for closer to an hour before icing it. I found that by doing this, the cake cooperated more.

Very delicious! My guests loved it and I melted the frosting beforehand as suggested, I will probably use more of the delicious pudding mixture next time.

This was such a quick and easy dessert.  From start to finish, we were done in less than 15 minutes.  I would make this the night before so the graham crackers soften a bit as others recommended.  Our guests were surprised at how light and fluffy this was.

Outstanding!! It was shockingly easy to make and the end result was delicious!  It is a very sweet cake though. I might try it again with a dark chocolate frosting. Thank you for posting this recipe. It's a no-fail!

i thought that this recipe was pretty good. i took it to a family dinner and everyone loved it, especially the kids. next time i make it i might try to add some stuff or try different pudding mixes or cinnamon graham crackers. i also took the advice of microwaving the frosting and pouring it on. made it much easier. thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipie and so easy to make.  I've had it before at a company party and I always wanted to make it.  This is so easy I'm going to let my 7 year old neice make it next time.  I did heat the frosting in the microwave for about 40 sec and the poured the icing over the cake.  That made it even easier.  I will definately make this one again.

My step-daughter requested this for her birthday dinner yesterday; it was excellent as usual. I always use french vanilla pudding. It's such a quick, easy dessert and we love the creaminess and of course the chocolate. It can be made healthier by substituting sugar-free pudding mix, low-fat milk, light cool whip and the new reduced sugar icing.

I took the advice of one person and used not salted saltine crackers, it turned out very very good!  Next time I will try with gram crackers to see which is best.

This was yummy! My family really liked it!  I will definitely be making this again!  

I couldn't resist adding more chocolate to the recipe--I frosted the underside of the second layer of graham crackers.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS.  It overpowered the cream flavor.  The dessert was very good, but we all agreed that it was too sweet and rich.  If I had left out the extra chocolate frosting in the middle, it would have probably be great, so I'm giving it five stars anyway, since I strayed from the recipe.  Maybe if I made one layer with chocolate pudding and one layer with vanilla pudding... hmm...  I guess I just can't leave the recipe as is!

This was very good and very easy to make.  And it's so simple to make this your own.  I used butterscotch pudding, because that's what I was in the mood for, and I used cinnamon graham crackers which I thought tasted amazing in this dish.  As per previous reviews, I heated the frosting and poured it on top.  Although it didn't taste much like an eclair due to the changes that I made, we still finished it in 2 days!

My mom has made this recipe for years and it's the "most requested" item at any family gathering.  My oldest daughter loves helping ma-maw make this...it's so simple. It does make A LOT, but the leftovers are just a yummy (if not better).

Made this months ago and just realized I hadn't reviewed it.  This cake is awesome.  My boyfriend always orders "eclair cake" at a local resturant and I wanted to surprise him with it one day.  This is the exact recipe that he orders at the resturant.  So delicious!

This was incredibly easy and perfect for a crowd but I did find it much too sweet, probably because of the graham crackers.  Next time I'll try using the saltine crackers like another reviewer mentioned.

this is the perfect summer dessert.  i love it exactly the way this recipe is, but it's also good with banana pudding mix and chocolate graham crackers.  it also works well with sugar free pudding and cool whip and skim milk.  still tastes decadent!

This was AWESOME - I used fat free/sugar free vanilla pudding and fat free cool whip.  I also used chocolate graham crackers and took the advise of others and melted the frosting before pouring on top of the last row of graham crackers.  This was sooo good people kept asking me for the recipe and I have already been asked to make it for two more family functions!  So easy to make and so rich tasting - easy to make it somewhat fat free/sugar free!

My best friends mom, a southern belle from Donalsonville Georgia, used to make this dessert for every family reunion, potluck.. whatever. And we ate it up every time. I remember when I finally got old enough to ask her for the recipe, and I could not believe it was so crazy easy! Loved it then, make it and love it now!And yes, it is great with cheesecake or white chocolate pudding, and please, make your own chocolate glaze! Ms. Jean always did!

Absolutely fantastic!  Pillsbury Creamy Supreme (blue container) Chocolate is a good frosting if you don't make the frosting yourself.  Everyone loves it...except for the name, which isn't really accurate and a mouthful to spit out.  But that's okay; it tastes so good, no one cares!

Followed the advice of JH: I soaked the crackers in milk & poured the frosting on after heating in the microwave. Yummy!

This was so easy and so good.  I used french vanilla pudding and made my own chocolate frosting.  The entire family went for seconds.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! OMG!!!This was so delish. I did alter it a bit....I used 2 1oz sugar free CHEESECAKE boxes of pudding, instead of vanilla. So I layered crackers, pudding mix, 1 can of wilderness cherry pie filling, crackers, pudding mix, crackers, choc. frosting.I let it sit for about 12 hours too. It tastes like choc covered cherry cheesecake......it is fabulous.

So good, and so easy. I took this to a BBQ, and when I went to take their leftovers home, the 6 year old asked if I could please leave them for her. I did experience a little trouble spreading the frosting, and I even warmed it. I wish I would have chilled it for a while before trying to top it.

I made this for a friend's family and I got excellent reviews.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  They said of all the desserts it was the first one gone:) All I got to do was lick the bowl after I made it, but that tasted pretty good.  Plan to make again this weekend for my family.

Wow! Wow! Wow! How easy was this recipe?!? It seriously took me about 5 minutes to make. My family loves everything I make, and they all said this is one of the top things they have tasted. Next time I think I might add a thin layer of strawberry or raspberry preserve to the top of the middle layer of graham crackers.

We love this dessert, and it is so simple. But, we make it a bit different. We use pistachio pudding mix and vanilla frosting (the 'Whipped' kind you buy at the grocery). The pistachio flavor is SO GOOD! You have got to try it, great for St. Patrick's Day! :)

I've been using this recipe for years (my mother passed it down to me.) It never fails to get at least one request for the recipe. If you're expecting it to taste exactly like an eclair from a bakery in cake form, you're going to be disappointed. Of course it's not going to taste just like an eclair! This is more of an imitation, simpler, poor man's eclair :) I typically go a little light on the chocolate frosting topping... preferring to drizzle rather than spread. Too much tends to make the whole cake a little too sweet.

Super easy and very well-received. I'm on the call list for funeral dinners at church and this is something that I can have all the ingredients on hand and whip up in no time. My 11 year old daughter has been making this for at least 3 years!

Everyone loved it, and it disappeared quickly. Several comments that I could've left the frosting off, just used cool whip instead. I did use vanilla frosting instead of chocolate, as the guys here at work don't like chocolate. But overall a great, easy, tasty and popular recipe!

Very tasty - just like I remember my Mom making it.  I did dip the graham crackers in the milk for a second or so, but they were cheap, generic ones so I think it made them mushy but still very good.  I also microwaved the frosting for about 40 seconds to melt it and then poured it over the top - made it look much prettier than if you had to spread it.

I make this every year for my sister's birthday because she loves it. I got the recipe about 5 years ago from a co-worker. It's the exact same as this one only her's called for putting the frosting in the microwave for a minute then pouring it over. I would give it 5 stars personally because I love it, but there a couple people in my family who really don't like it.

My husband really enjoyed this dessert for his birthday!! We followed the recipe except using sugar free pudding and cool whip instead of regular. One comment - if using sugar free pudding mix like we did, do not use 7 ounces total of pudding mix like the recipe calls for. This turned out to be way too much. Use 4-5 ounces instead. Ours turned out quite stiff with 7 ounces of pudding mix. Add slowly, then you can judge for yourself how much you will need.

Yummy! Used one French vanilla pudding, one standard vanilla pudding and milk chocolate frosting. Followed the advice of others and microwaved the frosting for 30 seconds, the frosting was very manageable then.  Will make again.

It is really funny that I try to make all of these intricate fancy desserts, and this is my sisters favorite by far.  She always requests this at all the familiy picnics and cookouts.  Instead of Cool Whip, I use real whipped cream and it works out pretty well.

This is a faithful standby for me.  It's so easy that th ekids can help make it.  I can throw it together in no time. Even though it's soooo easy, it's still delicious!  I never have leftovers when I take this to a potluck!

This was really good and super easy.  I ended up using the 12 oz. cool whip and it was still great.    Will try another user's suggestion for homemade chocolate topping next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Easy to make and delicious! Used fat-free whipped topping and sugar free pudding to make it healthier. I got rave reviews when I brought this to work.

This is about as easy as it gets! Not a gourmet cake this is great for a childrens party or teaching somebody to cook. Per another reviewers idea I microwaved the frosting for 20 seconds before and it made it super easy to spread. I also made this the day before and it held up wonderfully.

It's hard to review this recipe, since I had it in my head this would taste like an eclair from a bakery.  While it reminds you of an eclair, it doesn't taste like one; rather it tastes exactly like what it is...a layering of store bought items: graham crackers, pudding, and a tub of frosting.  If you are looking for a recipe simple enough for a child to make that anyone would enjoy, it's great.  If you are going for a homemade dessert that looks and tastes amazing, find a recipe that starts from scratch.

Fantastic!  I had a recipe like this a few years ago which I lost.  I was so excited to find this, and it's exactly what I was looking for.  My husband and I think it is even better the second day.  The only change that I made was to make my own chocolate icing.   It's delicious and nobody would ever guess how simple it is to prepare.  Thanks for sharing!

I've been using this recipe for years.  My 3 year old and I make this for most of our family get togethers - it's delicious and it tastes much harder to make than it is.  I'm going to try and lighten it up next time, though - skim milk, cool whip free, maybe fat free/sugar free pudding?

I used cinammon crackers dipped in coffee,2 cups of milk and 1 cup of strong coffee and french vanilla pudding. I topped it with crushed crackers and cocoa powder. This turned out great. Thanks for a great recipe.

Try dipping the graham crackers in milk before layering (it will be ready to eat quicker) and melt the icing first- sooo easy and yummy!

This recipe is a hit at parties. Don't forget to chill it for a minimum of a few hours before serving. Overnight chilling is even better. It is a great recipe even using lower fat ingredients. I've even made it using chocolate pudding as a replacement for the high-fat frosting topping. It was still very tasty!

I made this for Easter Potluck at church and it was a huge hit. The other lady who also bought desert was upset that everyone ate the eclair cake and did not touch any of her desert.

I did not change anything about the recipe. Instead of using store bought chocolate frosting, I made ganache, using the recipe I found at this site... DEFINITELY A CROWD PLEASER!!!!

Extremely Easy, Super tasty. I think to avoid the graham cracker look on top, I might cruble it over the mixture next time. Otherwise everyone said this recipe was perfectly delicious, neither too sweet or bland. (I didn't even add any chocolate)

If you really want this to taste like an eclair, top it with a chocolate ganache instead of chocolate frosting(I used the 'chocolate ganache' recipe from this site, using milk chocolate--VERY easy to make and quick).  It's really the only way to go-- trust me on this one.

A friend of mine made this for me, and I couldn't seem to get enough of it! Especially the next day, as someone stated. Except for the texture it tasted just like those mille-feuilles I've had back in France... Yummy!

Love it!  Much better the next day because the graham crackers are soft.  For the best variation, try melting semi sweet chocolate for the top instead of frosting.  Yum yum!

I have made this again and again and I still can't get enough of it! I first tried it at my godmother's party when I was 8 years old. She gave me this exact recipe!! 

The only thing is I hated the chocolate on top - much too strong of a flavor for the cake and ruins it. Instead, on the top layer of graham crackers we put a thin layer of the pudding mixture and sprinkled cocoa on top. MUCH better!!

I have made this twice and will a million times more! Everyone raves and it is so easy to prep. I have also used banana cream jello instant pudding instead of vanilla for a little twist on the original.

Okay, the family liked it, but I was disappointed of the frosting. I took a reviewer's advice and heated the frosting in the microwave for 30 seconds and I'm not sure if this was the cause but the frosting was constantly running after you took it out of the frig. I'll give it another try.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving and all of my brothers loved it.  One of them had a birthday shortly after Thanksgiving and this is the cake he wanted.  I really, really like this recipe.  It's very rich and creamy.  My husband who is definitely NOT a chocoholic did not care for it too much.  I think the chocolate frosting made the cake too rich for him.  (I think he's just plain wierd about food sometimes, so don't let his opinion convince you not to try this cake at least once!)

I have been using a recipe much like this for years, and have always enjoyed the results.  One trick I've learned is that when using store bought icing (which I do) you can heat it up in the microwave and pour it over the top.  This greatly simplifies spreading it around since the platform is somewhat fluid.

Sorry to say, but I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I made it the night before, and it turned out like a cake, but it was just to sickly sweet for me, and I usually love sweet things.  My guests were polite, but nobody had seconds, not even the children.  If I were to make this again, I would not use store bought icing, I would make my own, then it would be slightly less sweet and easier to eat.

I would give it three stars and my husband would give it five so I'll go with four.  I would try this one at home before you make it to take to a function.  I'm going to try it again, but the jury is out on weather I make this a regular in my household.  I wouldn't make this to take somewhere else.

Quick and Delicious.  Definitely put the frosting into the microwave and pour over the cake.  Husband was a little skeptical but had a bite and went and cut a piece for himself.  The kids like making it and eating it.

This was a pretty good recipe. I wasn't wowed by it but it did taste good. I'm giving it an extra star because it was super easy and fast to make and is also very kid friendly.

A good simple dessert for a crowd, very popular with the kids.  I made my own chocolate butter frosting instead of using store-bought.  I made it 24 hours in advance and it cut beautifully.

Always a hit!  I use more like 3.5 cups of milk and sugar-free pudding mix.  I also make my own chocolate glaze.  You *MUST* make this 24 hours in advance, or you won't be able to cut it well, and it won't taste as good.

Everyone raved about this and I didn't like it.  It was very easy to make but the cake ended up way to sweet because of the frosting and I just felt fat eating it.  I won't be making this again.

WOW... this recipe has been a total hit!  I made the mistake of "halfing" the recipe the  first time to make sure I would like it, everyone chewed my head off for not making the whole recipe!  I have already made it 2 times this week, and have another event to go to this weekend, and will definetly be making this one!  I never had eclairs before, so I couldnt tell you if the taste compared, but if it does, I have been missing out for 31 years...LOL

This recipe is amazing!  I had such an easy time making it and it truly does taste like eating an eclair.  People just couldn't stop telling me how wonderful it was.  I've already made it five times!  Thanks, Cathy!

My husband loves Boston Cream Pie and he really loved this dessert. He was also happy that it was reduced fat and calories. I made it w/ reduced fat graham crackers, light cool whip, skim milk, and sugar/fat free pudding. I cut the recipe in half and put it in a 8X8 inch pan. I also made half of the Busy Day Frosting from this website. It was very yummy and easy. I will make it again very soon.

I made this for a function at church. This was one of the best desserts I made so far. What makes it even more wonderful is, it's easy to prepare and it's very inexpensive to make. Great dessert. Everyone will love it.

We love this recipe. I use it often, especially large gatherings.  I even substituted lite whip topping, sugar free vanilla instant pudding and low fat graham crackers.  It still tastes yummy. To decorate I topped it with small dollops of whip cream and put a little shaved chocolate on top.

I HAVE MADE THIS CAKE SEVEN TIMES IN THE LAST MONTH.  EVERYTIME I TAKE IT SOMEWHERE PEOPLE RAVE ABOUT IT.  IT REALLY TASTES LIKE A CHOCOLATE ECLAIR!!  IT IS SO EASY TO MAKE AND I ALWAYS KEEP THE ENGREDENTS HANDY FOR COMPANY OR TO TAKE TO WORK.
