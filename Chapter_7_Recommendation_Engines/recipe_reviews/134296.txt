I thought these were lovely. I made a miniature version & added fresh thyme & garlic chives, topped with some flash-fried Black Forest ham strips & drizzled with truffle oil. You can make these as fancy or as home-style as you like, whatever fits the occasion. Thanks for sharing your recipe:o)

Absolutely delicious. I added a little minced green onion and only used a pinch of salt/pepper. My family didn't care for them but it's their loss. This was a great way to use up a couple pieces of day old bread and a little bit of the evaporated milk I had in the fridge.

So I used the basic idea but I changed it a bit. I added a chopped onion, extra garlic and a dash of oregano and savoury. I also added almond milk instead of cream with an extra egg white. I didn't use any butter but sprayed the pan. Because the bread was looking dry I gave them an egg wash with one egg white and some almond milk. They turned out great! I took them to a potluck and they were a big hit and smelled delicious!

Very good as is. But also great with salsa on top!
Did not need to use salt, great flavor from the garlic and butter. stands up well to eat with fork or without. Will cook this again!
