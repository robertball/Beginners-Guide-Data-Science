I thought this was a very good recipe! Everyone enjoyed it. To the person who gave it 1 star and said they were burnt to a crisp, it says to keep an eye on it so it doesn't go from caramelized to burnt. Common sense. Every oven is different. They also say to cook until caramelized and cooked through, ABOUT 45 min. Thank you very much for the recipe, will definitely make it again!!

I add cabbage or Brussels, onions, potatoes, squash yellow and zucchini, green peppers, mushrooms ; I love to use McCormick's Roasted Garlic seasoning and olive oil. I roast this in a throw away pan on the grille. I start with potatoes and cabbage then add other veggies so they don't over cook.  Love this for out door cooking.

I've made variations on this recipe and they are all wonderful. The cook's note is correct, it lends itself to changing up based on what's available and in season. It's also true that you may want to vary the times and temps based on your oven and tastes. I personally like mine pretty caramelized, so I prefer the longer, higher cooking times. Thanks, also, for the tip about soaking the brussel sprouts. That's the change that pushes this to the top for me.

This is wonderful.  I changed out a couple of the veggies and also added some sweet potatoes (did not omit the white potatoes).  Very good and perfectly baked.  Nice texture and nice carmelization. 

@ cookin grams - You should have your oven checked out if burnt to a crisp.  Also, when baking something like this you should watch carefully toward end of time.  This is good.  I would advise you to try again.

This is a good basic equation for roasted veggies.  I used carrot, beets, zucchini, onion, and brussel sprouts because that's what I had on hand.  I roasted at 400 for just over 30 minutes.  Simple and delicious.

Yummers! This was my first time roasting vegetables and I am so glad that this recipe was here for the choosing. I used sweet potato, Japanese eggplant, red onions, garlic, brussel sprouts, and asparagus. I cooked it for the 45 minutes, but at 400 degrees. This was delicious. I cannot wait to try it again with other veggies. Thank you.

Good recipe. It turned out to be very tasty. My husband liked it and he's not wild about veggies. It very versatile since I can use whatever I have at the time. I used orange and purple carrots, parsnips, red onion, red potatoes and apples for 45 minutes at 425F.   I'll try it with different veggies too.

This is so versatile. For a large party of 25 guests, for which garlic mashed potatoes was already on the menu, my vegetable combo omitted potatoes, and instead included butternut squash, carrots, brussels sprouts, and beets. Olive oil, salt, and pepper with the recommended heat and oven-time made magical veggie deliciousness! The roasted veggies were as much of a hit as every other dish served, and even took pride-of-place on some guests plates. This is a for-sure repeat.

After I roasted at 400F for 28 min, it was drying out, shriveling up and unattractive.  Tasted alright, but certainly nothing to go back to.  Think I'll try microwaving for 5 min, and then crisping a bit under the broiler.  I like the mixture of vegetables !

Love love love this recipe. The flavors meld together. East it as a side dulish or on top of rice or salad as a main meal.

This is a great basic recipe for roasted Veggies! I followed the directions, including soaking the brussel sprouts and putting the pan on  the lowest rack in the oven. Soaking the b. Sprouts versus not- personally I didn't see a difference from when I haven't done it, so I won't bother with it next time.  I recommend to start watching the doneness at 30 minutes if you don't like a darker roast. We love our veggies really roasted, everything was cooked nicely and tasted delicious!

Remember to put it on the lower rack and it won't burn. I used a bay leaf crumbled and scattered among the veggies.

This has become my favorite way to have vegetables. The only change I made was to use onion instead of shallots because I had them on hand. The left overs were a great lunch the next day.
