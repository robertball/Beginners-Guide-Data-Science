This is a recipe that I had passed down from my mum, As I have in my notes I do not use sour cream, I use Heinz Lite Salad dressing this is a little bit sweeter and lower in fat. The mint adds a freshness on hot summers day this is a great treat for BBQ's

I cant wait to try this - Im planning a huge Memorial Day Picnic/Barbecue so this is going to be on trial this weekend first :) It soulnds perfect although I have reservations about the mint... but be that as it may, Im going to give it a shot and will let you know the results on Monday. UPDATE: WONDERFUL! LOVED it - I had to make one change because the family did not care for the idea of mint w/pototoes (no sense of adventure! :)) anyways, I left out the mint. PERFECT, thank you

I'm actually rating this 3.5 stars. We thought this was good for something different and the color of it was really beautiful, but I just thought it was lacking something, which is odd because of all the flavors that were going on. I made this just as written, except for adding some salt, which I felt it needed. I think next time I would add some chopped hard boiled eggs for something extra too. This will not replace my usual potato salad recipe, but it was nice to try and I may make it on occasion! Thanks for sharing. :)
