I have got to say that this was one of the most delicious dishes that I have tasted in a long time. It turned out that I did not have a full half-cup of salsa, so I added some Chi-Chi's salsa vinaigrette dressing that was in the fridge. Lacking orange juice I added some Best Foods Oriental Orange salad dressing, and that was delicious. All in all it was a great meal, but the salad dressing did make the sauce a little bit runny. I am going to use the full half-cup of salsa next time and see how I like it then. Delicious and thanks for sharing!

I've also made this several times since I posted the first review, and my favorite variation thus far is to use a jar of peach-pineapple salsa, cut the chicken breasts into cubes, and let it simmer in the salsa, then serve it with brown rice. I love this stuff!

I really enjoyed this e-z receipe.  It is so different and quick to make.  However I used regular oj instead of the frozen cause I had it in the house and it came out very nice.  I will try this receipe on salamon soon.

This was very good.  Sweet & spicy.  I would suggest having an extra can of peaches on hand just in case b/c this didn't make enough sauce for our liking.  Also, as other reviewers suggested I too sliced the chicken up before cooking and we served it over brown rice (which I guess is why I wanted extra sauce).  We'll definately make this one again.

Both my husband and myself liked this recipe. I usually don't like tomatoes with my chicken, but this recipe was very good. The only changes I made were:  add more green peppers, cut the chicken breasts into strips for quicker cooking, and used pineapple and tomato salsa.

This was great fast and easy! I made some quick salsa and used fresh peaches I just put them in the food processor after I made the salsa then added the peaches to the salsa and mixed together,everything else I followed.My husband and kids enjoyed as much as I did!

This was a colourful, easy and healthy dinner item.  My daughter, who wasn't so hot on the peach idea, simply removed the peaches and enjoyed the chicken nonetheless.  I made this ahead of time and reheated it in the microwave, which worked well.  Served with broccoli and rice.

GREAT!!!  When DH saw this recipe, he
refused to try it... but after I made
it, he, of course, did and absolutely 
loved it!!! It's pretty easy to make and
tastes yummy and spicy!! Not kid friendly
though - too spicy.  I will take
as much of the sauce off of the chicken and 
peaches though, and my 17 mos. old loves
it!

This recipe was outstanding!!  Instead of canned peaches I used fresh. I also used orange marmalade instead of OJ.  Next time I will probably double it.  We are hearty eaters.

A really quick and easy recipe and oh so tasty. I wondered about the combination of salsa and orange juice with peaches but it worked perfectly. Definitely a recipe to keep around for anytime but especially when you need a quick meal.

This is a new and interesting way to prepare chicken breasts.  The flavor lacked something for me, but definately one I will try again.

A recipe in my book for years now and even my picky father enjoys this dish.  Cook the chicken until a little bit brown, but be careful not to overcook or your chicken will be dry.  I prefer to make this with a chipotle salsa and I add cilantro for more depth.

Great summer recipe.  I used fresh peaches, in season, and I added mushrooms as well.  Was very good and liked by all at the dinner table.  Thanks for the idea

Loved it! Flavors blended really nicely together. Next time, we are going to try it with my husband's home-made salsa. Will definitely make this one pretty often.

Extremely easy and very good recipe.  I didn't have a fresh bell pepper so used a frozen red pepper & onion mix instead.  Still turned out great.  Will definitely make again.

A quick, spicy, colorful dish.  I enjoyed it.  My boyfriend doesn't really like cooked fruit in anything unless it's a dessert so he ate everything but the peaches.  I think this had nice flavors, nothing extravagant...simple ingredients.  I think it would probably work with canned pineapple too.

This recipe was pretty average for me.  Edible, but nothing to write home about.  I do think that it is worth tweeking to your own personal taste. I thought it needed something to make it more flavorful. I will try it again, but I think with pineapple, or maybe pineapple and peaches.  Needs something...

Absolutely fantastic. I used two fresh peaches, so I added extra orange juice and stirred in a tablespoon of sugar in place of the syrup. It was delicious.

Pretty tasty if you like it spicy.  I used pineapple instead of peaches and green instead of red pepper.  The chicken was sorta dry, maybe I cooked it too long, I was trying to bring it up to 180 degrees (or whatever the temp. for chicken is).  Next time I will let it finish cooking in the sauce.

Had this tonight... We loved it.  The only thing different that I did was added some onions and I used no added sugar peaches.  I will be making this again and when peach season is here I am going to try making it with fresh peaches.  May even try this recipe with mango or apricots too.

Very special, especially for such common ingredients - but in spite of the 'common' nature of the ingredients, we had to modify quite a bit because of what was on hand.  We had a big carton of *fresh* peaches from a friend's tree to use up - thus a search of 'peach' recipes (so no canned peaches were used).  Moreover, we had no chicken - just fish.  So, fish is what we used. Used a yellow onion instead of a red pepper. Plus we had to use apple juice concentrate and lime juice in place of the OJ.  Great anyway, though we doubled the picante&juice!  Really eager to try recipe as written though, just for a comparison.  I baked the fish and prep'd the sauce in a skillet while the fish cooked.   Served over black beans and rice.  My husband says this is nice enough for one of our special dinners when we keep the kids busy with a movie of an evening.  Will serve again with a green salad topped with a dressing made of jalapeno jelly and brown mustard.  I do want to try this recipe as written just for a comparison - and since we don't always have fresh peaches, will do so.  Oh...., we have a garden and had one piece of okra to use up. I sliced it up and sauteed it before putting in the onion, oh, and garlic.  The okra didn't bother myself or my husband, but our 14 yo son could actually taste okra in each bite of peach, so he didn't care for that.  In spite of that, though, that son had three helpings!  It must not have been too bad..... *grin*  Thanks for such a nice change of pace!
