Amazing!!!  This dish is amazing for all seafood lovers.  I used 1 lb shrimp and 8oz small bay scallops.  The scallops added a great seafood taste to the dish. I increased the sour cream and swiss cheese and stretched it by adding more shells. I also added two cloves of garlic diced to the sauce to kick it up a notch.  Next time I will make sure to get garlic bread for a side!  AMAZING!!

I couldn't find large shells so I used manicotti instead.  I used milk instead of cream.  This was fantastic.  No leftovers and will definitely be making it again.

This was really delicious.  I followed it to the letter except I forgot to remove the shells with a slotted spoon and used a strainer so I had problems with broken shells, etc.  That is on me.  However, I got it together and it was delicious even if my presentation was not good (again my fault).  Luckily it was just me.  I reheated the left overs the next day and one thing that happened is some of the top shells got hard on the reheating.  I'm a single guy so I'm still learning some of this stuff.

Was a huge hit at my dinner party! I followed the recipe, using small pre-cooked frozen shrimp instead of fresh - they fit into the shells easier. I also doubled the recipe and made an alternate pan using leftover rotisserie chicken (& smoked gouda instead of swiss) for my non-shrimp liking friends.  Both were gone in 10 minutes! Thanks!!

Kevin....you scored with this one!!!  My very picky husband said "please feel free to make this again"!  I just made one change quite by accident, instead of picking up sour cream at the market, I grabbed french onion dip.  I decided to use it anyways and it was great!!!  Thanks for a great new dish for dinner.

Awsome... This was the best meal I have ever eaten,and I have cooked and eaten alot. Everyone should try these, easy to make, and easy to make an impression with guest. Did not chang a thing. I served it with the white french loaf that blended perfectly with the sea shells. A nice white wine goes well with this dish.

Absolutely delicious! My kids and husband loved this. My husband said it was his favorite thing I have ever made. For the filling I used shrimp and small bay scallops. I also used double the amount of mushrooms. I used whole milk instead of half and half and used light sour cream. Served with asparagus.

This is my favorite site because of all of the reviews and helpful suggestions. Some say you should only rate a recipe by following it to the letter. I disagree. I think any recipe can be rated on concept. I think that most people that love to cook look at all recipes in this light. " This sounds terrific. How can I modify it to my own family's preference?" Rated on concept, this recipe rates more than 5 stars. 

We used manicotta instead of shells for ease in stuffing pasta. Italian blend of shredded cheese instead of Swiss. Whole milk instead of cream. Sauteed the mushrooms with 2 tablespoons of finely minced garlic. Cut the shrimp in thirds. Seasoned them with Cajun seasoning and sauteed in a little butter for 2 minutes. Just enough to set the seasoning.  Doubled the recipe with same amount of shrimp and used a like amount of imitation crab meat. (Wish we could have afforded the real thing. Maybe next time.) I think the leftovers reheated the next day may have been even better. Kevin, this was a fairly inexpensive meal fit for a king. Thank you.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe, but used 1 lb. shrimp. It made 12, which was plenty for us.  The sauce was great.  I'm sure I'll be using it for other fish dishes. Thanks, Kevin.

This was really good & I would have given 5 stars except for I did have to add a bit of spice, etc to help the white sauce. I used medium shrimp and cut them into thirds after cooking for barely 1 minute as I did not want to overcook them. Remember they are going to cook more in the oven  Half seemed too big.  I too only used a bottom shell.  It seemed like too much pasta to put a top on it.  I sealed the mixture in the shell by adding a bit of the shredded swiss to the top of the shell - YUM. I added in 4 chopped garlic cloves to the mushroom mixture.  The only thing else different was in the sauce.  It seemed bland so added some garlic pepper and about a tablespoon of dry sherry & a bit more wine to the sauce. Had a salad and garlic bread on side.  It was very good and I will make again.

I would give this six stars if I could. Mind you, I did make some changes. My husband doesn't like shrimp so I used three cooked chicken breasts instead. I ground them into flaked chicken in the food processor then increased the sour cream to 1- 1 1/2 cups. The sauce was good, but if I ever want to cut down on time I think I might just use Classico Alfredo sauce and I think it could be delicious  (I might also sautee some mushrooms, onions, and garlic to add to the sauce). I used chicken broth instead of the white whine and just used the swiss on top as well since I didn't want to buy two kinds of cheese.

Made this for my dinner party tonight, it was a big hit!  I made with precooked shrimp and added 1lb of scallops to the shrimp mix.  I also used manicotti instead of the shells, I could not find them in two stores.  I will make this again!

Wow! Fabulous dish, was a hit at the party and everyone agreed this might be the best dish I have ever cooked. And I am an accomplished cook. I accidently sauteed the mushrooms longer, but it came out great!

I liked this recipe very much.  It was a little involved for a weeknight with the kids hanging on me, but if I had time I would definitely make it again.  Good seafood comfort food.

Very good. I only had 1 lb. shrimp so I added about a cup of sauteed mushrooms to the filling. I also added garlic to the sauce. I didn't cover the filled shells with another shell (mostly because half of them broke while cooking!) But I think I'd do it that way again anyway. Be careful not to overcook the shrimp. Mine were a tad chewy but the taste was so good it didn't really matter.

This was very easy and very good!  I don't think it took as long as 1-1/2 hrs. so that made me happy.  I did not change a single thing, except I added a tad more wine and 1/2 & 1/2 as the sauce seemed a little too thick for me.  My husband really enjoyed this.  I'm taking left overs for lunch and can't wait to eat it.

Amazing!  Only think I change is to substitute swiss cheese with mozzarella cheese.

Update on July 3rd 2016

So,... I have been using this recipe for a few years. In the last few years I went from vegetarian to Vegan and am still using this recipe.  I just got done making it today and it's still fantastic. In place of the sea food I use different types of mushrooms and vegan sausage. In place of the milk I use almond milk. It still turns out fantastic.

was very good, but rich and heavy.. Needed more spice so added italian seasoning, garlic and some jarred pesto to the shrimp mixture. Ran out of mixture and didn't want to double fill the shells, so made the other 1/2 with garden veg cream cheese (all I had on hand) and italian cheeses.. The kids actually preferred the cream cheese filling over the shrimp. I enjoyed both and will make again.

Great recipe, the  thing I did different was adding garlic powder and italian seasoning to the sauce, it gave it a more italian taste, I also sauteed the shrimp in blackened seasoning to give it a kick. It came out great.

This was really good.  My son has had the left overs for three meals straight. I buy the cut up shrimp pieces at the seafood market to save $.  Stuff all the shells before you put the second one on to make sure you use up all the filling.

My husband said "best dish I have ever made!"  I did change it just a bit...I sauteed the shrimp for added flavor, and included cilantro and fresh lime juice...this is a keeper.

I really enjoyed it!  I found this doing an ingredient search when I suddenly realized I didn't have dinner planned.  So I had to make some substitutions.  I left out the mushrooms.  I could tell it would be good, but since it would have meant my kids would refuse to eat it, I thought it would be best.  My kids also don't like swiss cheese, so I used a 4-cheese mexican blend and it was really good.  I didn't have white wine, so I just used a little extra milk, and did the substitution of butter and milk since I didn't have half-and-half.  I know I completely substituted a lot, but it worked really well.  This is a good recipe that is flexible with your personal preferences.  I think the white wine would have added a lot of depth of flavor, but when you're desperately figuring out what you can make from what's left in the house, sometimes exact recipe following is impossible!

This was rather bland and pretty fatty. I had never worked with the shells before, so that was fun, and the shrimp was good.

I made quite a few changes, but we loved them!  Cut recipe in half for 2 of us and did not wrap each shell with another to enclose.  Used 8oz shrimp & 4oz lump crabmeat. I added a jar of pimentos & about 4oz chopped mushrooms to the shrimp stuffing.  I omitted onions based on preference & used skim milk instead of half & half.  Also used shredded asiago instead of parmesan.  Filled about 15 shells and plan on making again!  Only thing I will try is a bit more white wine in the sauce.  Superb!

This was absoulutely FABULOUS! The only thing I added was bread crumbs on top of the parmesean cheese. (I like a little crunch). It was a big hit, and very easy to make. Enjoy!!

Kevin- THANK YOU!!!  I  have been looking for new things to try and just made these last night. The flavors were savory, worked well together, blended nicely but also stood out by themselves. 

I did not use the extra shell to cover them, instead stuffed those and made more.   I also chopped up some fresh spinach, sprinkled it over the shells before adding the sauce  and cheese. Great way to add a little color and sneak in a vegetable. Broccoli would also work. 

This tasted like something I would order in an expensive restaurant.  Even my daughter who doesn't like shrimp- devoured her plate of them without asking what it was.  I will definately be making these again! And again, and again...

This was fantastic!  My husband loved this meal!  I used a lot more wine than calle for and put half a chicken boullion cube to neutralize the flavor.  More mushrooms because we loved mushrooms and sauteed spinach on the side.  Thank you for this recipe.  WIll def make again!

These shells are BEYOND amazing. I made them for Valentine's Day dinner and my boyfriend didn't stop talking about them until today .. this dish is just awesome. I used a little less shrimp (to cut cost) and used a sauvignon blanc for the white wine .. and I was just so impressed. Definitely recommend!!!

This was SO GOOD! I forgot mushrooms at the grocery store so I used a couple tbsp's of cream of mushroom soup just to get the flavor. It was still amazing. My only complaint was that after baking in the oven, the sour cream inside the shells pretty much turned to liquid. I'm not sure what the solution would be to fix that (I used regular Sour Cream, no light or fat free), but I would have prefered that a little creamier. Still, it did not ruin the flavor of this delicious dish!

I made this for Valentine's dinner.  I get bored of the same old dinners and this recipe was very inventive!!  It is a little spendy so definitely for a special occasion or for the wealthy!  =)  I was hesitant to use sour cream because I am not a huge sour cream fan and thought that it would be weird with seafood, but surprisingly the swiss cheese mixed with it really compliments the dish very well!!  For the sauce that you cook and spread on top, I would use a little less flour, and a little more butter and white wine and add a few garlic cloves to the mushrooms..  The amount of flour called for makes the sauce cakey and has a weird flavor in my opinion.  Over-all a fantastic idea and who doesn't love shrimp!!! Yum!  I served this with sourdough artisan bread.

this was delicious but I did change the recipe up a lot. I seasoned the shrimp with salt,pepper,garlic salt, red pepper flakes, and tonys. Then added crab boil to the water for the shrimp. I took the shrimp out and put them in the freezer so they wouldn't cook any more while in the bowl. I also sautéed the green onions mushrooms and garlic together while seasoning them with worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic salt, cayenne and cooked them down until my mushrooms were really soft then added the wine and half n half .... while heating that up i slowly stirred in flour and grated parmesan until it was thick. i also had to use manicotti noodles, also wit the stuffing i used GOUDA not swiss. My boyfriend and I loved this sooooo much

This was a delicious addition to my recipe collection. On the advice of one reviewer, I used sour cream-based onion dip instead of plain sour cream to add flavor. I don't think I would make it any other way because it came out so creamy and tasty. I doubled the mushrooms and added the green onions at the last minute to the sauce so they wouldn't lose their color, taste or texture. This was a dish that required some time to make, but it was well worth it. I know I will make this again.

I added  bay scallops, decreasing the amount of shrimp by the same amount, and that was fine. However the reason for my rating is that there was not sufficient sauce to adequately cover the shells. the next time I make it I will double the amount of sauce. I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce to give it additional flavor.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed is that I cooked the shrimp in a little butter, garlic, and old bay seasoning instead of boiling them in water. Will definitely be added to my dinner rotation! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Looked and smelled good, but the filling produced a lot of liquid while cooking, although the overall presentation was nice.  Would have been better with some of the Parmesan sauce mixed with the filling.  I added garlic, which was a nice compliment, but I wouldn't make this again unless I modified the filling to have a thicker consistency.

Instead of the wine I used the shrimp stock to carry the shrimp theme into the sauce along with a couple of shakes seafood spice, yum!!

Didn't have time to make and stuff the shells, so I used egg noodles instead......equally delicious in less time!  Love the sauce this is a sure hit!

This dish had great flavor even though I had a hard time getting the pasta to look picture perfect. Perhaps I over cooked the pasta a tad?

This turned out really tasty! I think I would use more cheese inside the shells next time though.

This is alot of prep, but worth every minute. Wife's been after stuffed shells for 6 mo. She loved this.  That's whats important will be making this again.

Loved the recipe.  Was short on sour cream so I put a little Ranch dressing in.  We both liked the flavor.  Used immitation crab this time but will try it with shrimp next time.  Thanks for a flexible recipe that is pantry friendly.

We absolutely loved it. Flavorful, filling and a definite hit with everyone including my 4 yr old. The only change I made was to use frozen shrimp and I don't think the dish suffered for it. My husband and I both said that we felt like you could substitute in chicken for someone who isn't a seafood lover and it would still be great.

Enjoyed it, but next time I would use ricotta cheese instead of sour cream. Cut the shrimp smaller and more sauce over the top. Helps if you make a slurry with the flour before you add it also. Eliminates the clumps.

This was actually fun and easy to make.   Everybody loved it.  Only suggestion:  next time I’ll cover my 9 X13  with aluminum foil, as some shell edges got too crispy.

Kinda bland as is.   When reheating leftovers I Added Prego sauce and mozzarella on top and that made a world of difference.

Loved it! Used 2 lbs of shrimp and doubled the swiss cheese and sour cream but followed everything else exact to the recipe. Will definitely be making this again for dinner parties.

I made it according to the recipe except I didn't add the shell on top of the stuffed shells. Added some garlic powder in the sauce. Served with garlic bread and salad on the side. This recipe is a keeper!!

I didn't have the patience to stuff shells, so I left out the sour cream and Swiss cheese, threw the seafood (shrimp & scallops) and mushrooms in the sauce and made lasagna!  I layered it with an Italian blend of cheese and no boil noodles.  My husband was eating out of the pan as I layered.  The sauce is delicious and I'm sure stuffed shells would be wonderful!

With homemade herb cheese, this recipe worked perfectly! I added some imitation lobster to add more protein and made it with manicotti pasta instead. (The grocery store was out of shells!) This is a delicious take on a traditional al recipe that is guaranteed to please!

Only change I made was a suggestion to add garlic to the mushrooms and green onions.  My picky Husband who never likes anything but red sauce actually went back for seconds!  No leftovers.  This is a keeper
