Great recipe to work off. I didn't have exactly what was called for.  So I did onion, garlic, green pepper, beef, 2 tomato sauce, 1 basil and oregano diced tomatoes, salt, pepper, and a very generous pour of merlot. Simmered for 3 hours, cooled and refrigerated for the next day. It was very good. I will use this recipe often. Much less time consuming than the sauce that I usually make.

I made this sauce with some changes partly due to not having on hand certain things and partly due to reading other reviews.  I used my homemade canned tomato sauce and tomatoes I preserved from  my garden because I didn't have any fire roasted tomatoes on hand.  I also added a chopped green pepper and some garlic because I like both of those in a meat sauce.  I also cooked it with a couple of bay leaves.  It was fabulous.  However, I suspect that the fire roasted tomatoes would have been equally as good.  My family loved it.

Good sauce as is, or can easily be tweaked to satisfy anyone"s taste. I added some garlic as well as some mild Italian sausage, because had it. It turned out very good.

Great, easy sauce that doesn’t take all day. I did add garlic and a little sugar as it is very acidy without the sugar in my opinion.

I changed a few things. I used chopped fresh tomatoes instead of the canned and added garlic powder. It was easy and delicious!  Served it over spaghetti squash!  I will definitely be keeping this as a regular dinner item.

Dish was terrific. I usually follow directions to the tee but my husband prefers ground turkey instead of ground beef so I used turkey. Came out great and is definitely a keeper.

This sauce is easy and delicious. I did add fresh garlic to sauté with the onions. I also used a can of crushed tomatoes and a jar of Botticelli Marinara sauce. I did not use the wine or fire roasted tomatoes but it was still so good!  I ate it right out of the pan.

Very easy and simple recipe with that a large number of ingredients. The only modifications I made was adding three quarters of a pound of hot Italian sausage, one extra can of tomato sauce and 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning.

Good recipe, I added a green pepper chopped, and garlic powder to taste. With out the garlic powder I found this to be on the bland side slightly. Over all a good recipe. I will make it again. ( note, I may have found it a bit bland because I did not have red wine for the splash of it that the recipe called for).

We all loved this sauce! I did add some garlic and cut back the Italian seasoning b/c we like it, but not THAT much, lol. Also, I slightly drained the fire roasted tomatoes to ensure a thicker sauce, which worked great. This was simple and delicious and it makes A LOT, but I'm glad b/c I was able to freeze a container for next time. I will def be using this recipe again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
