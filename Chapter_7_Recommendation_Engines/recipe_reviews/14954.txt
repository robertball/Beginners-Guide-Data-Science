Soooooo good!  I've made twice and the second time dispensed with the chicken livers and the pork...less expensive this way. (Lamb is also good.)  I stuck with the rest of the recipe but added 3 chopped garlic cloves because I think all sauces benefit from it.  I used canned chopped and diced tomatoes too and a couple of sloshes of red wine, though marsala would be good too. Oh this was fantastic!  If you double the recipe, you can freeze the remnants and have on hand for unexpected company or nights when you need comfort. Five stars!!
