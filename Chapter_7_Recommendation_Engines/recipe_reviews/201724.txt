Great hamburger!  I love cooking with beer, but never thought to add whiskey before.  I scaled this down to 4 servings for 1 pound of ground beef.  I used minced garlic from a jar instead of garlic powder and instead of Sam Adam's used Michelob Ultra.  I think any type of full bodied beer will work fine in this recipe.  After mixing the ground beef, we let it set for a half hour in the fridge before making the patties to let the flavors come together.  These burgers came out very moist and juicy.  We will definitely make these again.  They were perfect on a toasted roll with melted cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion.

I used 1 lb hamburger, and less of each ingriedient accordingly. 4 of my family thought these were good, 2 of my family didn't like them at all. I would make again for the ones of us who like, and plain ones for the ones who don't.

Adjusted this for about 2lbs of ground beef and added a touch more whiskey (after all, I was making this for my man! :D ). Turned out to be the best burgers we've had yet. I made them thick and big and he still had 2 AND put 2 more away to take to work tomorrow! Definitely strong compliments coming from him. 
Will be making these for him again. They were also a hit with my grandparents. My parents are upset they didn't get invited! 
The whiskey adds a little bit of a bite to the burger, and the beer helps make them nice and juicy, even if you prefer yours more on the well-done side. 
I used Karl Strauss Amber Lager. 
These will be a fun summer hit for sure!

So good!! I used Zeigenbock for the beer and Jameson's for the whiskey (go big or go home!) These were so moist and flavorful. I have to admit to just "eyeballing" the spices - could have used more S&P but that's my error - I'm no Justin Wilson. I'm going to make these again and instead of hamburgers, do a chopped steak and gravy application. It was a shame to waste all those delicious pan bits!!!!!

These burgers were moist and juicy.  Mixed all the ingredients and let sit in the fridge for about 4 hours.  Washn't crazy with the flavor.  I'll keep looking for better recipes.

I have picky eaters here, at first when I told everyone whiskey and beer was added they were skeptical to say the least.  After they tried them they were an instant hit with my family as well as a couple of friends.

Entirely too much garlic powder.  The garlic powder was so overpowering we could barely eat the burgers.  I will try this again but with a lot less garlic powder.

Really great hamburgers. I made them for friends for a barbecue this weekend and everybody raved aboput them. The alcohol made the patties very moist. (I did add a "touch" more than you said) They turned out very moist and tasty. Great recipe.

These burgers taste just like the ones I used to get at my favorite burger joint in Austin, Dirty Martin's.  Be sure to cook them through or they'll taste alcoholic; when you cook off the alcohol it's insanely delicious.

Made these with our own groiund beef.  Delicious.  I had one with a bun and one without.  It definitely needed a bun to balance the flavors.  Family enjoyed

I tried this on turkey burgers with lots of cayenne (because my baby likes things extra spicy).  It was delicious!  I did add a little extra whiskey right before they finished cooking, so there was kind of a whiskey glaze.  Thanks so much for the recipe:)

The powdered garlic and onion was overwhelming.  Switching to fresh makes this recipe much better.

Made this with some Killian's and Grant's Scotch whiskey. We also used diced fresh onion instead of powder which adds a nice little crunch. My wife said it is the best homemade burger she's ever had and that it rivals most nice restaurant burgers. I have no complaints, I just gave it 4 of 5 because it was really good and juicy, but there wasn't anything over the top, just a really great burger recipe. I made 1/4 lb patties about 3/8-1/2" thick and cooked them at about 350 for 7-9 minutes. The 7-8 minute mark seemed to be ideal. The last two that stayed on an extra minute or two were a little more dry, but that goes for any burgers, not just these.

These were great.  I used bison instead of beef, Jim Bean whiskey, and Blue Moon beer.  These were very moist and the whiskey imparted a nice smokey flavor.  I forgot to throw in the Worcestershire sauce so I imagine they must be even better with it.  Served with sweet potato fries and broccoli slaw.  Thanks!

Loved it! Used Guinness and Jack...what else is there? For those of you scaling the recipe to 4, that's 2 T of whiskey. Great with spinach and BBQ sauce on top....or just by itself....

I'm a serious burger hound so I was excited to try these but my husband and I thought they seriously lacked in flavor. It was like I hadn't added anything. :( A lot of ingredients to not taste like much.

So Good!
I had to alter a bit since I had pre-formed hamburger patties (left over from a huge party).  

Rather than adding to the hamburger then forming the patties, I simply marinated them for 60 minutes then brushed more 'sauce' on during the cooking

The only change to ingrediants I made was to use minced garlic rather than powdered, I also used a seasoning blend that I make during the grilling.

A delicious burger, and the taste was even improved as they were cooked on a charcoal grill rather than a gas grill. I used organic 85/15 beef and these burgers did not shrink up, at all!  I mixed them up early in the day so that the flavors had time to meld.  Once I took them out of the fridge, I let rest about 30 minutes to take off the chill.  We added cheese, lettuce, pickles and tomatoes and enjoyed 'Honey Mustard Macaroni Salad' from AR and fresh veggies along with the burgers.

YUM! Followed the recipe exactly and it was so good and tender. Perfect burgers. I did leave the burgers out for a while before cooking them (longer than planned because it took forever to get my coals going). Definitey my go-to burger from now on. Also, its really nice to have the rest of the beer to sip while grilling!

I have made these several times now.  Just like the recipe, no changes.  It is now my favorite.  When I grill them for company, every one loves them too.

The burgers were really moist.  I used Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss and they turned out really well.  They had really good flavor.  I couldn't really taste the Jack over the garlic though.

These sounded so good... They were definitely juicy, but all I could taste was the Jack Daniels. My husband LOVES whiskey, especially Jack, and even he said it was over powering. I gave this recipe 3 stars because we are going to try them again, only next time with less whiskey. Hopefully they will turn out better

Town Branch Bourbon worked out well for this recipe, topped with eggs on Auntie Millie Pretzel bun, would also suggest a nice Cider as a pairing for this yummy dish.

While the burgers were moist, I did not care for the flavor at all.  I'm glad I reduced the garlic and onion powder. They would have been inedible. I used the correct amount of the other ingredients and the Worcester and whiskey was overwhelming. I will not make this again.

Great recipe. The burgers were juicy despite using 96% lean beef. I didn't use the whiskey because my Mother was coming over for dinner, but the beer and other ingredients gave them much flavor.

the burgers came out okay but i was expecting something more..  i subbed 4 cloves of garlic for the garlic powder and 1/2 a yellow onion for the onion powder.. i could taste the beer (budlite) and the whiskey (bushmills) in the burgers but i wanted a punchy component.. we cooked these in the oven as it was raining outside.. on a positive note, the burgers were very moist and juicy

These are amazing! I noticed a lot of people turned off by the strong whiskey flavor, so I only used half of the whiskey and replaced the rest with beer. I used very lean beef and tossed an egg in to keep it all together.  This is now my go-to burger recipe.
