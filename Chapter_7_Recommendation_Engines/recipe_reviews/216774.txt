Awesome banana bread, and yes this recipe is "To-Die-For"! I know that may seem a bit overly dramatic, but this stuff is really good. I've made a lot of banana breads on this site and this is one of the better recipes. I cut the recipe in half as I only needed one bread but I wish I'd made two! I used butter-flavored shortening, added a little more banana, and used low-fat buttermilk and sour cream. I did add a bit of cinnamon and next time I think I might add in some walnuts or chocolate chips - and believe me there will definitely be a next time! This bread was very moist (ya just gotta love baking with buttermilk), rich and delicious. Oh so good warm out of the oven with a bit of butter. Thanks for a great recipe AMHORSCH!

To die for......yes, ma'am! I made this today with my older boy only substituting whole wheat white flour for the regular flour and cutting the white sugar back to a scant 1/2 cup. I made 12 large-ish muffins for us as snacks and three "gift" loaves for friends (random acts of kindness!). This banana bread is one of the best we've ever had. Really, REALLY to die for! I hate to make it lighter because it's really freaking yummy but next time, I might cut the butter and oil back by half and add more mashed banana. NOTE: To prevent a tough banana bread, I always wisk together all my dry ingredients (including sugar) and all my wet ingredients and then fold the dry into the wet until just moistened making sure not to overmix. You get perfect quick bread/muffins every time. EDITED: I've now made this recipe twice and not only does my family love it, but so do the six people we've made gift loaves for. Thanks!

Wow...thanks so much for this.  And, BTW, my daughter is a very new cook and really appreciated the review explaining to add separated dry ingredients to wet and mix just till moistened.  It is NOT always obvious to the newer cook and such information is very worthwhile.  You never know who gains a lifetime trick from such helpful hints.  Thanks again.

Thanks for the reviews everyone.  Im glad most everyone loves it like we do.  As far as the way I wrote the instructions about mixing was simply to help those who dont bake often.  Im making 2 loaves in the morning and cant wait. Bake on and pass this recipe on to your friends - theyll thank you for it!!! Angie

I just got this bread out of the oven and had to try it right away.  It's almost too hot to eat but it's absolutely delicious.  It's very light, moist and has a wonderful banana flavor.  I followed the recipe to a T except I did add some cinnamon.  I've tried lots of banana bread recipes but this one is my favorite by far.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I was a little nervous about being the first to make muffins with this recipe, but I don't have a loaf pan, so I did! 18 minutes in a pan prepped with cooking spray was perfect. I sprinkled them with rolled oats. To-Die-For indeed! The recipe will make about 36 muffins. :)

Yes, it is a great recipe.  Thank you!  I also added some cinamon and nutmeg.  I used 3/4 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup rum and it was so delicious my husband said he fell in love all over again!  BTW  as a general rule of thumb you do mix the dry together before adding the wet, but in certain circumstances (such as when using bananas) it does work better as shown in the recipe.  Thanks again, and keep em coming!

Very moist banana bread.  I had a little buttermilk and 4 bananas to use up and this recipe was perfect.  For nut lovers - you can easily add nuts without changing anything else.  When I make this again - and there will be a next time - I am going to sub applesauce for the shortening and try doing one of the loaves as muffins.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Recipe was fun making. Took 45 minutes to prepare, 1 hour to bake. Bread is not too sweet, especially since I had to use 1 cup Apriva to 1 cup of white sugar. Busy adding all ingredients and did not add cinnamon or nutmeg, which I usually do. No buttermilk in house so mixed my own using 2 cups whole milk to which I added 1/2 TBSP of white vinegar. Used 1 cup in recipe, storing remaining cup in frig in covered container. Bread is golden brown, but texture was not dense. Next time, I will add 2-3 more bananas for greater flavor. HINT: Definitely use a large bowl for banana mix; by end of mixing bowl will be full. Loaf pans were 3/4 full so I put them on top of a cookie sheet to avoid spillovers. Cake rose 1/2-inch below top rack. After eating 1 warm piece, I placed each loaf in a plastic bag and left loaves on countertop overnight. Had a room temp slice with late breakfast; doesn't tickle my taste buds so will heat some before eating next time. Normally, I freeze banana bread but freezer went out so am storing loaves in the frig, leaving in bags. Enjoy!

This really is to die for. Made it this morning and my neighbours down the hall came over to have a piece. they could smell the Banana Bread all through the hallway of our apartment building. They all raved about it as the bread was super moist and delicious. I substituted low fat sour cream for the full fat without affecting the texture. Also added walnuts as I love walnuts in my banana bread. Yummo!!!!!!

My family loved this banana bread. I made this for my son's teachers as gifts and I sent a few loaves with my sister who works at the hospital. Everyone went crazy over it. I wound up making two more loaves for one of the nurses to bring to her book club. This is very moist and delicious and I like that it makes two loaves because you can eat one and gift one.

Ok,  so I make/have made a LOT of banana bread (several times a month for over 30 years. My family never tires of it!). I have a tried and true recipe I've used for many years but always am curious about trying others, ready to swap out for a better bread...Well, I believe I have found one! I chose this recipe because I am partial to buttermilk in my recipe and the addition of sour cream intrigued me.  It is a keeper.  My family noticed a difference immediately.  I may have added an extra banana or two (my frozen ones were small.  I always freeze my very, very ripe bananas to be used in bread)  but other than that I did not deviate from the recipe. It did take a bit over and hour to bake, but ovens can really vary and you just need to take that in account when trying a new recipe. This is an excellent bread and I do not agree with other  reviewers that it is too sweet or cake like, my bread was perfect consistency and just the right sweetness!  Try it, I don't think you will be disappointed.

We really loved this banana bread! I think it will be my new go-to recipe. The only changes I made was that I substituted oil for the shortening, and used a total of 6 bananas, 3 really really ripe ones (black peels) and 3 ripe ones (brown/yellow peel). I think the total was about 1 2/3 C banana. We like lots of banana flavor! If I use extra bananas again, I may try to cut back on the oil to 1/4 Cup. I may also try cutting back on the sugar to 2 cups total (instead of 2 1/2) since it is a pretty sweet bread. But, like other reviewers said, it's practically perfect, so it's almost a shame to mess with it. When making for gifts I will make as is; if it's just for us, my waistline might appreciate a few lighter modifications. ;)

i have yet to try the recipe but definitely will.  Just want to tell Sue to tell her daughter, the very new cook/baker, to plug away girl, keep cooking and baking and you will learn all of these little secrets that make the end products amazing.  Ignore comments by Sherrie, she was once a newbie too and it seems that she has forgotten this, either that or she can't read because it clearly says that you are a very new cook/baker.  Thanks again for the recipe Angie, i am sure it will be amazing.

Very moist cake. Really enjoyed the banana flavor. There was plenty of batter left over after filling two large loaf pans, so I made a dozen muffins as well. My grandson wouldn't stop eating them! I've been making a banana bread recipe for over 30 years from a cookbook of my mother's that she got as a gift when she married my father. It served me well over the years, but this one was so full of flavor and so much easier to make that it will be my go-to recipe for banana bread from now on. 
Thank you very much for your contribution!

FOLLOWUP:
It's been 6 months since my first review, and I'm still getting requests for this banana bread from my family & friends.  As fantastic as it is, I've also put my personal spin on it. I've substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream because it's creamier & has less fat content. I prefer to sour milk I have on hand with vinegar rather than wasting my money to buy buttermilk at the market. I use 5 bananas instead of four & pour all of the batter into a 9 x 13 pan & bake for 60 minutes. (Even better when I make a double batch & bake with two 9x13 pans!)  I use my eggs at room temperature to make a lighter, less dense cake. I like the glossy appearance of the cake once it's baked. So very tasty!
Thank you again Angie, for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I made this bread as written. It is very moist. The texture was very good. It's a little too sweet but I will make again reducing the sugar at least 1/2 cup. It calls for white and light brown sugar. The next time I'll leave out the brown sugar. Also I thought it needed more bananas.

7.2.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/216774/angies-to-die-for-banana-bread/ ... Yes, agreed, uh-huh, very good.  'Reduced white sugar by a half & used an additional banana.Added a little vanilla, too.Very moist.I also substituted a cup & a half soy yogurt for the buttermilk & sour cream.They didn't need the additional fat from either.I made twelve muffins & two 8x4 loaves.'Not so sure that much batter would fit in two 9x5s as the recipe states.In the bread I put a layer of fresh blueberries.'Not so pretty, but good, too.I also like banana bread 8 & 4.Later: Ya know, I think it may be too moist.'Think I'll try reducing the shortening.It didn't last long enough to happen, but with quickbread getting that sticky top anyway plus being extramoist, 'seems you're inviting an early mold.  (Sorry to bring that up with a good recipe!) Note: Was years between making this & other two I liked (Deborah Stone-Gove & Teri Lynn), but I think I liked theirs better.

Okay, so I only had one loaf pan (not sure where that second one went) so I had to get creative with the 20 other pans I have. Using round cake pans didn't seem right and I didn't want to make mini loaves or cupcakes. Aha, there's my trusty Bundt pan. Still an odd choice but it made the most sense. She worked like a charm. I did have to cook it longer, 70 mins to be exact. The bread turned out beautiful and very tasty. It had a wonderful crust on top and once out of the pan and cooled the outside crisped up nicely. I will definitely be making this again, loafed or Bundted.

I am retired and believe me I have tried a lot of recipes looking for the best banana bread. This is it. Delicious,moist and flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly as stated (but did add some cinnamon). This is definitely a 5 Star keeper,even my finicky hubby loved it.

This is the second time I have made this Banana Bread and I will never use any other recipe again.  This is THE BEST!  The only change I made was I used 3 loaf pans and they turned out beautiful, nice-sized, loaves.  Most delicious banana bread; the family loved it, and so did my friend that I shared a loaf with.

I see I am very late in discovering this recipe as the reviews go all the way back to 2011. I have now made this banana bread three times within a month. Wow. Is it ever good. I have gotten two delectable perfect loaves each time.  We can't get enough of it.  Angie, you are correct.  I will never use another banana bread recipe again.  I am not one to fiddle with the chemistry of a perfect recipe so I was only tempted to add the walnuts I love.  Thanks for sharing this. You have made me very happy!

This is a moist bread. I couldn't taste the bananas and I'll add 2 more next time. I'll also omit 1/2 cup of sugar.

This recipe is more like cake.  Everyone seemed to like them but it’s not the typical moist banana bread.  For the volume it should have more bananas.

Loved it! It was fine, just that it makes a really big loaf. Next time I might halve the recipe.

This is really really good banana bread! I was looking around for a banana bread recipe and reading the reviews and everything and I'm glad I chose this one. The only thing I did different was used regular 2% milk and it was fine. I'll definitely be keeping this recipe.

I have used this recipe a few times.  It comes out perfect every time.  I did reverse the amount brown sugar and white sugar.  I am also a nut lover, so of course I added 1 cup of chopped pecans.  I usually have make 2 for the family; 1 with nuts and 1 without.

Subbed half the white sugar with honey. Very moist, slightly dense, a little on the sweet side, good flavor.

Looking for banana bread that used buttermilk, this is the one I chose.  It is very good and moist, just how it should be.  I made it into five small loaves rather than 2 larger loaves.  The flavor is good and it freezes nicely.  I added walnuts to 3 of the loaves and left the other 2 without. Our favorite way to eat banana bread is toasted as it really brings out the banana flavor.  This bread did not disappoint as toasted banana bread.

Ok just made these, and they are more like a cake. 
my mom says she loves them. but i think i like a little more denced. i also cut down on the sugar, I used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and it was still a little sweet for my taste and i also added 1.tsp of cinnamon. but overall i will make again but i think i will use banana extra as well or extra bananas. thank you for sharing your recipe!

I almost forgot the eggs!  Had to take out of oven and add them.  Added some chocolate chips. Might be a little over baked but tastes good.  Would make again.

This turned out really well. I cut the recipe in half and used 2 1/2 bananas (had a half left over from yesterday's cereal) and it was perfect. Needed to let it bake a few minutes longer due to my oven but it still was rather tasty!

My oven temp is off which is why the bread is darker than it should be.  It is delicious, soft and moist!  I can definitely see making 3 loaves out of this recipe.  These are large loaves and one has been partiality eaten!   Banana flavor is good, sweet, but not overly sweet.  You can definitely reduce sugar in this recipe if you like and I don’t think it would be any issue.  I would make this again in a heart beat.  I didn’t have buttermilk so I used unsweetened almond milk and French vanilla refrigerated coffee creamer and a splash of lemon juice.

Very good banana bread. Simple to make and the recipe is really easy to follow. There aren’t any of the over-the-top steps instead it can be made easily with understandable, rational steps. It makes 2 loaves which is a personal preference. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I would classify this as a cake.  It wasn't very bread like, much lighter and fluffier.  Not what I prefer.
