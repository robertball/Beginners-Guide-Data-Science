I prepared this with yellow rice and was already nervous cause I find that a lot of simplistic recipes with rice come out a little wonky, whether it has to do with incorrect times or different heat, etc. However, this recipe proved successful and the rice was cooked very well, and was extremely flavorful. I didn't quite realize how spicy the jalepeno would make it(not having much experience with them), so just be conscious of that (a tasty spice, though!) I really liked the taste of the garlic with these ingredients, it was unexpected and great. Very simple and tasty!

This recipe is a very good starting point for something great. What the pork needs is a rub, because without it, the pork's a tad bland. I made it Mexican with chili powder, cumin, dried coriander and paprika (not so Mexican, but gives it a nice red color). Also the recipe calls for scraping up the brown bits. That's what deglazing does. Just use a bit of the beer beforehand to clean up all the bits as you fry the onion and garlic. Problems with rice? They key, as always, is to keep the lid on. Thanks OP
