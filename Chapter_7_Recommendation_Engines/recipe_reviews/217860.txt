Well, you just can't go wrong with a classic like  Caesar salad! And since I love the salad I figured I'd try the sandwich which proved to be just as good. And if you don't have a Caesar Salad Kit on hand you can easily do what I did and use light cream cheese mixed with a little garlic and Italian seasoning, Romaine lettuce, shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses and add use your own croutons or leave them out altogether.  For the Caesar dressing I used "Caesar Vinaigrette' from this site.  I made wraps into this vs. pinwheels and since this was more of a meal than an appetizer I added some grilled chicken - YUM!

I didn't much care for this. I used a tortilla for the bread. The ceasar salad kits come with dressing and not powder so I had to add some of that. It was near impossible to drain the sun dried tomatoes as they are sitting in so much oil. The cream cheese got really oily due to the tomatoes and even small bit of dressing added. I ended up making one sandwich and adding turkey and extra cheese and then taking the cream cheese mixture and doctoring it up to make a dip. Something wasn't right about the recipe. As is, the cream cheese just tasted too much of sun dried tomatoes and had an odd after taste from the ceasar dressing. Maybe, the powder would have been different, but I have never seen it in a kit that way. I am giving it a 3, because I tried it as is and didn't care for it. However, I was able to salvage it so it wasn't a total flop.

Usually I make Caesar wraps with finely diced chicken, so i did add that. What i loved was the presention of these. Beautiful for a light lunch with the mother in law! And buying the kit made it all much simpler.

These were a hit!  I added chicken cooked with a little ceasar dressing and used flour tortillas.  Will make again.

If you like Caesar salad, you will love this recipe!  I used the sundried tomatoes not in oil, and the salad kit I bought didn't have a seasoning kit, so I added some of my own seasonings to the cream cheese and it turned out good with the caesar dressing poured over.  I will definitely make this again!

I used 4 large Flour Tortillas instead of Lavosh, & I took the advice from other chefs and increased the Cream Cheese to 6oz. added 1/2t Garlic Powder, and 1/2t Italian Seasoning to softened Cream Cheese and drained the Sundried Tomatoes well on a paper towel to remove more oil before adding. I also added 1 chopped Avocado and 1/2 Minced Sweet Red Pepper for substance.  I folded in the ends and rolled as tightly as possible & cut each in half next to the toothpicks... YUM!! Thx so much for posting, I'll definitely make it again.
