I made this recipe tonight and it was awesome.  My family loved it.  I had to make a few modifications though.  I only had 1.19 lbs of ground beef so I used only one egg and 1 cup of bread crumbs.  One other thing I would recommend is to warm the rest of the Ragu sauce in a sauce pan and use it as a gravy for the meatloaf and mashed potatoes served with the meal. I also added a clove of crushed garlic, because we love garlic.

We really liked this!! Very kid friendly and simple recipe to prepare. This was a different twist to the normal ketchup-brown sugar glaze I generally use for meatloaf...Like other reviewers, I added some garlic as well as using just regular bread crumbs from a can as opposed to the fresh ones the recipe called for.  All in all, very tasty!!

Husband loved it!  We added one clove of chopped garlic, and next time will probably add two cloves of chopped garlic.  Would recommend basting with a little more sauce perhaps when adding the last portion of cheese just for a bit more of a "sauce" on the meatloaf.  This will be added into the nightly cooking rotation.  The only thing I was slightly concerned about is that I don't think the calorie count is correct (332 Calories) unless you are using ULTRA LEAN ground beef.

My mother passed away four years ago due to cancer. I haven't had her pizza meatloaf since. Tonight I attempted this recipe and let me tell ya, it brought tears to my eyes. PERFECT match. Thank You for posting. P.S. First time making meatloaf.  Thanks Mom.

This meatloaf was very flavorful and my family loved it.  However, it didn't strike me as very "pizza-ish".  The consistency and choice of ingredients in the recipe were perfect (not too salty or overpowering).  I also definitely prefer pouring spaghetti sauce over the meat as opposed to ketchup.  My one issue is that the center of the meatloaf was still very pink after cooking for 50min + the additional 10min.  We ended up eating the side pieces, and threw the center portion back into the oven for about 10 min longer.  Overall, it was great and I will definitely make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe if you are using ground game (like deer) and do not like the "gamey" taste.  A tip if you do not have bread crumbs--put a couple slices of bread into the blender and hit puree.  I like to have the extra sauce and highly recommend the pepper as it rounds out the flavor.  This is a perfect make ahead meal.  Thank you for the recipe!!

This was pretty good the first night, but was really a bigger hit as sandwiches the next day! We will definitely be having this one again.

My kids said this was good but it really didn't have any taste to me.  I may make this again if they ask me to.

This was very good- I love the pizza flavor it has while still retaining that comfort food meat loafy texture. I'll definitely be making this again. 



Modifications: I used a Prego Tomato/Basil pasta sauce instead of Ragu. Didn't make too much of a difference. Also, I added some Italian seasoning, as well as some diced pepperoni to the meat.  Note about the pepperoni- microwave it first for about 30 seconds, then squeeze out as much of the grease as you can with paper towel so it doesn't make the loaf too greasy when you bake it. But it makes it taste even more like pizza when added ;)
