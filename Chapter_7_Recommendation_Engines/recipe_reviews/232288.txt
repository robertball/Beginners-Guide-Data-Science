I made these last night and added an extra half of recipe amount so I could make 2 full dozen. The only difference from the original was that I used up the fresh pineapple I had in the fridge and added extra water to make up for some liquid. I added the (optional coconut) as I like the flavour. I had a little extra batter than what the original recipe amount calls for because I made 24 instead of 27 since it was an odd number with the two-12 cup muffin pans that I have. Even at that my muffins were done in 20-22 minutes. I can't see it taking 30 minutes to bake, I guess it may depend on where you live and your oven. Well, anyways they were so moist and light I couldn't believe it, and this without any oil or butter! I kept the amount of sugar as I like to stick to the original recipe as much as possible to rate it first, and I'm glad I did as the sugar makes the tops of the muffins like candy, sticky a bit. I really like that combination of soft moist middle and bottoms and a somewhat sticky crunchy top. We have only 2 muffins left, that should tell you something about this recipe :) Thanks for the post Katrina!

I made these exactly as stated except I cut back the sugar to 1 cup.  They were moist and delciousl  It made 12 decent size muffins,  I only needed to bake the for 20 minutes and they were done.  Everyone in my house loved them.  Next time I might cut sugar to 3/4 cup and see what happens.  They were a great muffin.  I loved taht there was no oil in them!  Thanks for sharing.

1c sugar was plenty as another reviewer noted.  I was out of oat bran and/or wheat germ, so I simply ground up the same amount of rolled oats and it worked just fine.  We did leave out the coconut as a family member doesn't care for the texture of it - but I'm glad to have another different muffin recipe in the rotation!!

Didn't care for these at all. A little chewy on the outside & flavor was just "off". Not sure how to explain it just didn't like them.

I had some crushed pineapple to use up and found this recipe (adapted for 12 muffins because of the amount of pineapple I had). I cut the sugar in half and added cinnamon and allspice. I also didn't have oat bran or wheat germ, so I added about 1/3 cup of rolled oats (and used a bit of whole wheat flour instead of just white). We also added raisins. Delicious! My toddler is inhaling them.

I added the coconut making this a pina colada muffin, used Truvia Baking Blend instead of sugar, and sub'd Egg Beaters for eggs.  I made larger muffins (got a dozen), and the only criticism that I have is the muffins were slightly overcooked.  I checked at 25 minutes (not even 30), but will check at 20 minutes in the future.  This must be a very old recipe because I haven't seen crushed pineapple in a 14-oz can for MANY years (always 8 or 20 oz these days).  Chopped pecans would be a nice addition.   This made a very nice breakfast muffin, and I definitely will make again.

Very moist, and tasty!  I ended up with 15 cupcake size muffins. These were quick and easy to make.  I will be making these again soon!  I did use whole wheat flour, and next time I might cut the sugar back by a 1/2 cup just to make them a little healthier.

I cut the sugar back by half and added in one teaspoon coconut extract, as the recipe submitter suggested for Pina Colada Muffins. I made no other changes. I did get 11 muffins out of one recipe that were a bit on the smaller side. Baked at 350*, these muffins were done at exactly twenty minutes. Seriously moist muffins, the pineapple and coconut combination was really a nice combination. The kids raved about them--they each at three a piece this morning!

Really good!  So surprising that there is no fat in this.!  I cut sugar down to 1 cup and omitted oat bran and wheat germ.  I also used Gluten Free flour blend and turned out great.

I used fresh pineapple so substituted yogurt whey for the juice that would have been in the canned pineapple.  Perhaps that's why I got the mushy, pudding like centre. Added the coconut extract and the coconut but find them very bland. Used only 1 cup of sugar.
