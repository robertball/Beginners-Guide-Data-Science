Well I used the aluminum foil, but that is it!!!  I used 2 slabs of baby back ribs and cut into 4 sections. I removed the membrane!  Brushed with Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce and put each section into aluminum foil in the fridge over night!  Next day I put the ribs in the oven for 2.5 hrs on 300 degrees on a cookie sheet! When done, I simply put them on the grill for 5 minutes to give that barbecued flavor!  Simply fell off the bone! And absolutely no mess!! Soo good!!!

As they were sealed in foil and cooked by indirect heat, I saw no need to use the Grill (where maintaining a set heat requires a tad more attention than an oven).

So, I used the  oven (set on bake initially and broil for the finish). 

They came out "fall off the bone good."

Awesome!  Made this for a last minute get together with my parents and everyone was amazed.  I did a few things different but the cooking instructions were exactly as described.  I did use my own marinade and let them marinade for 6 hours before cooking.  Marinade made with two bottles of Guiness, paprika, tamerik, garlic, pepper, BBQ sauce and A1.  Then cooked in BBQ with the ice cubes as instructed.  Then at the end, hit it with some BBQ sauce and cooked for 5 minutes on flame.  Amazing.  I originally wanted to keep checking it to see if it's cooking but I put it on the BBQ in foil, off flame at 400 degrees and didn't touch it for 1 1/2 hours.  It was perfect.  I used a 4 burner BBQ and just ignited the left and right burners and put the aluminum foil wraps in the middle off flame.  Then added the BBQ at the end blacking it for 5 mins.  Da Bomb

Best short rib recipe that exists in the planet. Super juicy. Very accessible ingredients and cheap. 
After the ribs are cooked I like to roast them directly on the grill for about 15-20 minutes.

YUM!!!!  I Don't have time to cook during the week so I used this rub on 4 meaty boneless chuck ribs & let them rest on the counter for about 15 minutes.   Then I cooked them with olive oil on the George Foreman Grill.   They cooked to perfection in about 15 minutes or so.  I served them with our favorite BBQ sauce on the side but they were juicy, tender,  & delicious on their own.

Very good! Some of the best I've had, or made. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Changes I made as follows: hot smoked paprika and chipotle chili powder were substituted. Also, the recipe didn't specify but I cooked mine over lump charcoal, two towers of coals each an hour apart.

I made the short ribs a few weeks ago and they were amazing!  Today I used the same recipe and technique to make pork tenderloin and holy cow.  It was fantastic!

My husband has not stopped raving about this recipe! The ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender. The rub was not overpowering and added just the right amount of kick. You knocked this out of the park! Will definitely make this again!!!!

OMGosh! Thank you for this recipe and technique for putting the ice cubes in the foil. I used thick cut boneless ribs and cooked them slow on the upper shelf in the grill. I did everything per the recipe and cooking method. Absolutely fabulous!

My husband made them with Tyson's pork baby back ribs for the 4th of July and they were incredible! He wrapped in foil prior to bbqing and they fell off the bone! Meat was so tender! Love this recipe!

Followed the recipe to the letter and they actually turned out fork-tender...I think I’d try a splash of beer instead of the ice cubes next time!!

I made it in the oven... only 1.5 hours and meat was a little tough and there was way to much paprika. Will not make again. If I do will be making drastic changes.

Will definitely make again.  They were really good.  I made them I. To oven and finished them off using the broiler to caramelize the BBQ sauce.  From now on my go to recipe.  Easy to prepare and very little clean up.

I had my doubts, but this worked. Everyone said the seasonings were on point. It cooked a lot faster than this for me, so do check it after 45 minutes or an hour. I think it might depend on how fatty/bony your ribs are, and how many are in each packet. Glad I had a method to give me courage to try this less-common cut of meat.

My husband brought his boss home for dinner and I decided to give this recipe a try. I followed the recipe exactly and the ribs were wonderful. They were definitely moist and had a wonderful flavor. I did put the ribs directly over medium heat for the last 10 minutes and coated them with the BBQ sauce then, and this made them have a nice crisp outside. This is a very easy recipe and one that I'll be using very frequently during our grilling season.

Very good.  I was looking for a (quick) recipe for boneless beef short ribs, and this was the closest I found.  Short on time, I only let the ribs rest with the rub for about 15 minutes.  Followed the rest of the recipe.  I thought they'd be done quickly, being boneless, but they still needed over an hour on the grill.  We skipped the BBQ sauce step, plenty of flavor.  I thought they were a little gritty, but that's probably because I didn't let the rub sink in for the full time.  Taste and texture were great!  Oh, PS--skipped the salt....as in so many recipes, really no need for it.

Delicious! Made the rub exactly as shown, spread on a slab of baby back ribs after stripping off the membrane, put in foil in fridge overnight, and cooked along with ice cubes. Used our  favorite bottle BBQ sauce. The best ever!

I loved this technique! It was so easy. I used the heavy duty non-stick Reynolds foil and there was no mess at all! I used my own rub because I already had some made. I will use this technique again for sure!

Delish! Followed the recipe to a T and the result was a tender, moist "fall off the bone" tasty short rib! Perfectly seasoned. The foil pockets made clean up super easy! Can't wait to show off at the next office luncheon, this recipe will have them bowing down callling me MasterChef!

It is simple, so not that exciting.  I wanted to do something easy and that's what I got.  I'll try more garlic and maybe brown sugar next time.  I liked that there was less mess to clean up than with a marinade.

My ribs came with the rub already on them.  So I wrapped them in foil and cooked them with a few pieces of ice to steam. Followed the recipe and then threw them on the grill. They could not have been better!

I have made these multiple times, in the oven and in an instant pot. I do add an additional tablespoon of  onion powder along with the other spices listed in the recipe; When I use my Instant Pot (IP) —I add a 1/2 Cup of each apple cider vinegar and apple juice and push the “pressure cook button” on the IP  set for 25 min. I also broil them for 3min. At the end and then you can put your favorite BBQ sauce on! You also only do step #1  in the directions and at this point if you want to make ahead throw them in the freezer and you can use either method (IP) or  follow this recipe to step # 2 ( thaw ribs overnight in fridge) or directly put ribs in instant pot frozen!!! ( only 25 minutes) It Pessure cooks it so no worries!!! So, when I am crunched for time this is also a fast and super yummy alternative!!! I thought I would add a photo as I make double batches and freeze them for something quick to pull out when I am in a pinch for time! I buy my short ribs from a local butcher that is same price as the grocery store, but much better quality and cut.

This recipe was great. I boiled my ribs in half water/half chicken broth with fresh onions and garlic for about an hour. After I threw them into a ziplock bag with the all the ingredients this recipe called for. After about 5 hours I threw these bad boys onto the grill. Perfection!

I added some sesame oil to the dry rub and a little soy sauce to marinade some wings at the same time.

Very tasty. Solid Rub with no weird ingredients that you probably don't already have.

Amazing! We applied the dry rub in the morning...Letting it sit the entire day in the fridge. We then cooked it according to the original recipe instructions. ..however,  we added a little beer to our barbecue sauce & grilled them directly on the grill. They were the best ribs I have ever had!
