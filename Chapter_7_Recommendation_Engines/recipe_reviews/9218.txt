I think I made a different recipe altogether because I assumed that the balls were going to be mushy to work with and mushy inside so I used fresh baked potatoes and mashed those instead.  Then I mixed in butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, cream cheese, one beaten egg, the crushed corn flakes, and a couple tablespoons of self-rising flour. Then I floured my hands and took some of the mixture, placed 4 to 5 miniature marshmallows inside, then rolled them into a ball and baked.  I put one marshmallow on top during the last few minutes of baking.  They tasted great!  They tasted like sweet potato pie inside with a crusty outside.

This was a very good idea, though I think next time I would add an egg and some flower to firm them up.  I also used butter pecan syrup instead of maple.  The cornflakes were my favorite part, very nice texture.  This recipe went over well for Christmas Dinner.

We always have sweet potatoes for the Holidays, but decided to fix these because they were a little different.  Got rave reviews and now fix them for a gathering, even if it isn't a Holiday.

I thought these were alright.  I thought the cornflakes would make them crunchy, but they turned out soggy instead.

This was a delicious recipe!  We order these at a restaurant in town and my sister loves them.  I made this recipe and she said it was even better than the restaurant's version!  I agree!

This recipe was wonderful.  Very tasty.  The only problem I had was keeping them in the nice little balls.  I ended up putting all the balls in a bowl and mixing.  Still tasted grate.

I have mixed feelings on this recipe. The mixture was very runny making it  difficlt to form the mix into balls. The balls were flat and not really firm balls. I even tried putting the mixture into the refrigerator for a little while before I rolled it into balls hoping it would firm up; but that didn't work all that well. My feelings are mixed because I ordinarily wouldn't make a recipe with results such as this again; however despite how it looked two people at the table, who otherwise do not care for sweet potatoes, actually liked it so I'm going to keep it.

Delicous recipe!  The balls were mushy to make but worth it.  The maple syrup really adds to this since the sweet potato mixture itself wasn't sweet enough.  I'll definitely make again!

The boyfriend who swears up and down he doesn't like sweet potatoes gobbled these up last night.  Delish! as written.  The marshmallows were sort of ugly.  Maybe I'll try with fluff next time.

Delicious. I add cinnamon and nutmeg to the mashed sweet potatoes, which added some additional flavor. Very, very sweet though- nearly a dessert.

These were very good and I will make again.  I used cinnamon flavored corn flakes and true maple syrup.  If anything, they were too sweet.  A very nice change from traditional sweet potato casserole.

I tried this recipe last year for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I normally don't like Sweet Potato dishes, but this one I really did enjoy.

Pretty good if you like sweet potatoes. Making the casserole tastes about as good and is easier.

Always good to have an easy serve and easy store side dish on hand.
