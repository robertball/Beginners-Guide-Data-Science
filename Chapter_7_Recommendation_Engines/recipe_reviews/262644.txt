10 minutes plus natural release was not long enough for 1 large artichoke. I had to put it back in.

I truly love artichokes! But the traditional way of making them takes forever. I love the ease of using the pressure cooker. As written, this recipe is ok. I've been using a similar recipe for a couple years now. Trim and wash as directed, place them face up in the pot, squeeze 1/2 to a whole lemon over them and then sprinkle with lemon pepper seasoning and garlic powder (or garlic salt if you prefer). Snap the lid into place and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes. Delicious!

I found this rather bland. If I were to make this again I would tuck the garlic into the artichokes and sprinkle the salt over them.  The lemon can only be tasted in the very centre and is a little bitter. They weren't done after 10 minutes so I put the lid back on and and cooked them for another 2 minutes.

This is a great recipe.  I put sliced lemon in the bottom with the whole garlic cloves  bay leaf and salt.  I added chokes then poured water over the top.  This helped the garlic powder coat the chokes.  Squeezed lemon juice on top.  I used two of the large artichokes from Costco and cooked for 25 minutes with a natural cool down.  The flavor permeated every leaf, even the heart!

We followed the directions as written and I ended up having to try again and this time for 25 minutes . I suggest if you have large ones to adjust to 25 minutes with slow release instead of quick.

It needs olive oil, red wine vinegar and Italian spices.  Then it is stuffed and eaten with an aioli dip.

I'd not made artichokes nor used our instant pot before, so after reading other reviews, I increased the water, squeezed fresh lemon, and spread roasted garlic on the three fairly large artichokes. I steamed them for 20 minutes and did a quick release. They were all cooked thoroughly. We dipped them in melted butter. However, they were not fabulous, but kinda "meh." Well, I can't say I've never made artichokes before!

Scaled recipe down for 1 artichoke and 1/4 cup of water was not enough.

Tried with two fairly small artichokes. Not cooked through at all. Used 10 minute cook time. Used "natural" pressure release , as recommended in InstantPot manual for vegetables. Tried to finish in the microwave. Very disappointed in first use of our new InstantPot.
