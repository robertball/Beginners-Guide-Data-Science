This is probably the best basic chicken recipe I have ever tried.  If you don't have all the dried spices it calls for, reach over to that spice rack and substitute!  I've used all sorts of herbs from my spice rack and everytime the end product is wonderful.  It works equally well with bonelss skinless breasts.

I made this chicken this weekend and my daughter said it should be called "Kick-butt" chicken.  My family loved it.  I put the chicken and the sauce in a plastic bag and left it in the fridge all day and baked it that evening.  I did baste it and that kept it very moist.  I would recommend using chicken with skin on (even though I usually don't bake with the skin on) because the pieces with skin on seemed moister than the pieces without.  I didn't have any hot sauce and it was still great.  So were the leftovers.  Oh, and I took the cover off the last 15 or 20 minutes and it was an appetizing golden brown color.  Excellent.

Amazing! I have made this many times and really look forward to it. I always make the following tweaks: Double the marinade, use 1 teaspoon of Aleppo pepper instead of the hot sauce, cook for 45 minutes and baste every 15 minutes and add 1 cup of chicken broth.

An easy, delicious recipe. Even my picky eaters love it so I make this often. This smells so good when it's cooking. I omit the hot sauce and substitute dried parsley for fresh. I frequently make this with boneless, skinless chicken cooking it at 375 degrees covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for 20 minutes. Make sure to baste occasionally. Comes out very moist and tasty.

Chicken roasting in the oven is inarguably one of the best aromas to hit your nose.  Even two chicken breasts for Hubs and me filled the air with that mouth-watering smell.  I used bone-in, skin-on breasts as the submitter recommends.  There is just no comparison between them and boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  You get SO much more flavor with bone-in breasts!  As one reviewer suggested, don’t worry if you don’t have the exact herbs called for – substituting, mixing or matching will all result in a darned fine piece of chicken; tender, moist and flavorful.  A “Sunday Dinner” type of chicken for sure!  I knew that covering the chicken would not produce the deep golden brown skin I wanted so I sprinkled it with paprika before it went into the oven and uncovered it during the last fifteen minutes of roasting.  They were, indeed, the color I was after with a nicely crisped skin. Chicken breasts vary greatly in size, so use the cooking time suggested as only a guide.  A meat thermometer should register 160-165 degrees and the juices should run clear, not pink.  This is some of the best chicken I’ve had in some time and this recipe reaffirms that bone-in, skin-on breasts are superior to boneless.  I served these with Lemon Parsley Potatoes and Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes.

This is SO yummy!!  My whole family loved it. The 2nd time I made it I doubled the recipe and added potatoes. Perfect! I also made 5 ziplock bags with the seasoning, so now I just have to add the garlic and tabasco sauce, mix it with the oil and put it on the chicken and potatoes. Great for a night that I don't want to cook!

This is a very basic recipe.  I didn't use this exact thing, although I used a couple of the ideas in the recipe to make my own chicken.  I took five or six boneless chicken breasts, salted & peppered them, then placed them in a pyrex baking dish.  I just sprinkled herbs over the chicken, (dried thyme, basil, a little sage & rosemary, etc.) plus fresh garlic and about a half a cup of white wine (NOT cooking wine).  Chicken was EXCELLENT--you really can't go wrong when you flavor the chicken with herbs!  As other reviewers have noted, this is a great one to play around with.  The wine and herbs smelled divine while cooking.  Fail-safe, wonderful chicken!!

This was very good.  I used boneless, skinless breasts and didn't bother with basting while cooking.  Also left out parsley and hot sauce as I did not have them.  Will make again!

I made this recipe for my chicken loving husband, and he loved it.  I took the olive oil with the herbs, onion, and garlic and gave it a quick whiz in the blender and it made it very easy to brush over the chicken. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and also incorporated the parsley into the recipe instead of on top. It was great, and we have made it several times since.

Yummy!  Chicken was very moist, juicy, and flavorful. As another reviewer suggested, i added a little lemon zest.  Also, I had some fresh rosemary & sage, so I used that instead of dry.  I let the chicken marinate all day while I was at work and I used fresh organic chicken.  Maybe that is why is was so moist & juicy!
I might brown it first next time for a browner, crispier skin. Again, as another reviewer suggested. But we thought it was great cooked as directed.

This was fantastic!  I made as directed except for no sage, hot sauce or fresh parsley (didn't have them), and added a few shakes of chicken/steak seasoning.  I put the oil and seasoning in a gallon ziploc bag, then shook it all up with the chicken and four chopped Yukon gold potatoes.  I roasted it all in one pan and in 45 minutes had heaven on a plate!  Served with broccoli and cornbread - unbelievable!

This recipe is easy to translate to many guests, which I did for my restaurant. Alternatively, I would cautiously limit the amount of sage for any size of this dish. I also used chicken thighs, cut the fatty flap off, and seared the chicken in the marinade before roasting them in the oven (subtract 15-20 minutes, or gauge by internal temp). After searing, use FRESH rosemary sprigs, which flavor the rendered fat that is produced from roasting.

The wife LOVES this.  If you have a cuboard full of dried spices and a couple peices of chicken...this is a sinch.  We didnt have any rosemary or marjoram, so we subbed in basil and oregano.  Turned out GREAT.  Making it again tonight and it has been added to our bi-monthly  cooking list.  Cheap, easy and good!  We make it with boneless skinless breasts.
We read though the reviews and made the following adjustments to the recipe:

Oven Temp - 375 degrees (boneless skinless chicken breasts)

Cooking: 20 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered

Baste Occasionally - keep a small reserve (about 1/2 cup) of basting sauce for 2nd 20 minutes.
Ingredient Additions: 1/2 stick butter (melted) added to basting sauce

Ingredient Substitutions:  Oregano and Basil for rosemary and marjoram

If you want this dish to really stand out, use fresh herbs.  It made such a huge difference and really wonderful gravy. Can't wait to make it again.

Amazing recipe, so full of flavour. I doubled the recipe and made it as a baste/rub for a whole chicken. The gravy I made from the juices was so good. The chicken was juicy and tasty, the way my Grandma's used to taste. I will definately use this one again. Thanks!!

5 stars, with caveat. This is the second time I made this, this time w/ fresh rosemary and fresh thyme. I also added lemon, since the last time I made this it was lacking "something". The lemon helps to freshen it up a bit. I added about 2 TB of fresh lemon juice (not that concentrate bottled stuff). I upped the amount of herbs for the fresh herbs.  I placed the bone-in breasts in a baking dish, and spread the marinade (it's a bit thick) on the skin side. Then I placed cut lemon slices (rounds) on top. I covered w/ wrap and refrigerate for 3 hrs. I baked about 25 minutes foil covered, then basted and removed the foil and lemon slices on top for a remaining 25 minutes (they were thick breasts) to crisp up the skin. Then I let it rest (foil covered) for 10 minutes before serving (essential for the juices to run back into the meat). These were juicy succulent good tasting chicken.

Very good, will probably make it again. Also very easy. It was nice to make something that I had everything on hand for.  If you have big pieces of chicken like I did, you will need a pan larger than a 9x13.  I took the foil off for the last 6 minutes and you will need it off longer if you are wanting the skin to be crispy.  The chicken was very juicy (used the bone-in split chicken breasts).

Tasted excellent and was easy enough to make.  Only made a few minor changes (omitted onion and pepper sauce).  Used boneless/skinless chicken (grocery store was out of bone-in with skin).  Still tasted great and came out nice and moist.  Served with risotto and it was well recieved.

This was a great meal!!!  I substituted boneless, skinless chicken breasts because it was what I had on hand.  I also increased the garlic to 1 tbsp of jarred minced garlic, and diced the onion instead of mincing.  I spread 1/2 of the seasoning mixture on the bottom of my baking dish and added a little extra olive oil also.  Then I spooned the rest of the mixture on top of the chicken.  I baked for 30 minutes at 425 as another reviewer suggested.  This recipe was juicy and flavorful.  It is a great recipe for a quick meal!!  I will DEFINITELY make this again and again!

Excellent chicken - some modifications, I didn't have regular olive oil so I used the herb infused dipping olive oil, also didn't have sage.  Still very tasty, moist.  Easy to make and easy cleanup too - a keeper!

This chicken was SO good!!! I made some changes... instead of adding hot pepper sauce, I added about 1 tsp of lemon juice. I also marinated the chicken for about an hour or two. I cooked the chicken at 375 for 20 minutes covered and then 20 minutes uncovered. I served this chicken with the Four Cheese Sauce which I found on this web site. I put garlic mashed potatoes on the plate then I put a piece of the chicken on top and the sauce on top. It was very yummy!!!

This was really good! My boyfriend and I really liked it but next time we will use boneless chicken breasts.     Here is what I did after looking through the reviews:    6 T EVOO, 2 T lemon juice, 2 tsp each onion powder, dried thyme, and salt, 5 cloves of garlic minced, 1.5 tsp oregano (subbed for rosemary and sage), 0.5 tsp basil (for marjoram), 1 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce (for hot pepper sauce)     Mix above together and rub over 2 big chicken breasts, leave sitting in fridge for a couple hours. Put in 9x13 (chicken and extra of mixture), add 1 c chicken stock and put 1 tbsp butter on top of each chicken breast. Bake, covered, for 25 minutes at 425. Uncover, baste, and bake for 20 more minutes or until done. Let rest at least 5 minutes before cutting.    It came out nice and juicy with plenty of flavor. We turned the pan juices into a gravy but the chicken didn't need it. Definitely a new staple in our house. :-)

Very savory and simple.  Best with bone-in breasts. Unless small, I cut the breasts in half- allows more surface area for the sauce.  I also increase the amount of sauce by 1.5.  This is also great grilled (use extra sauce to baste).  Has quickly become one of my go-to chicken recipes.

Good recipe Christine! I used dipping herbs that came with the garlic infused olive oil I purchased at a kitchen store. Added some fresh herbs too. I didn't cover the dish at all becasue my hubby loves crispy skin on his chicken. Delicious and thanks!

Very good chicken.  I think that the next time I make it, however, I may uncover the chicken about halfway through so it seems more like "roasted" chicken, and less like "baked" chicken.

Great recipe, but as usual, I had to add my own twist!  I took 4 chicken breast and also some yellow squash and zucchini, and placed it on a large piece of aluminum foil.  For the oil, I used garlic flavored grape seed oil, and a bit extra due to adding the veggies.  In addition to the ingredients listed, I added a packet of chicken bouillon.  Mixed it all up, poured over meat and veggies, and wrapped the foil up to make a "packet".  After sitting for a bit, and flipping the packet occasionally, I placed foil packet in pan and roasted for the time and temp specified in this recipe.  I flipped the packet again 1/2 way through cooking to "baste" the veggies and chicken.  Whipped up some red skinned garlic mashies and dinner was served!

This is delicious. I did use different herbs to use what i had (rosemary, basil, mrs dash herb blend0 and used about 3 tbsp of garlic. I also seasoned the meat with cajun seasoning and a touch of lemon pepper.  I also cooked a whole onion with it bc I didnt read the ingredients right. I added 3 tbsp of melted butter and a can of mushrooms to the pan. Cooked covered for 30 min then uncovered for 20. My hubsband couldnt stop raving about how good it was. Tonight with the leftovers I am making gravy with the pan drippings and pour it over some ratoni pasta and shred the leftover chicken to go in it.

Very good!  Definitely a keeper!  I marinated it for a while prior to baking.  I also removed the cover for about the last 10 mins. to brown the chicken.

I really liked the flavour of the herb sauce, but my chicken did not turn out well. I did, however, change the cooking technique, but it has been a previously fool-proof method. I doubled the herb sauce ingredients and tossed half with some chunked up potatoes, carrots, and onions.  I placed that at the bottom of a slow cooker. I rubbed the chicken with the remaining sauce, even loosening the skin and getting some under there. I then placed the chicken on top of the veggies and slow cooked on low for 8 hours. The veggies had a wonderful flavour from the sauce, but the chicken was very dry and pasty, which amazes me because I just cooked some chicken breasts in this very same manner the night before and they were perfect.  So I don't now about that.  But I will try this again because the flavour alone was wonderful.  I will just cook the chicken as specified and see if that works out for me.

The chicken came out well.  I left out the hot pepper sauce and the dish was still packed with flavor.  And, I got to cook with some of the my less-used spices.

The chicken in this recipe turned out juicy and very tender. However, in  my opinion, it lacked personality, so I added some garlic salt and cajun seasoning. It's a great recipe to get someone started who likes to tweak things a bit. I also prefer pan searing my chicken before baking, so I did, and the outside turned out crisp and wonderful. The house also smelled great while cooking. Will use this again.

I have made chicken just about every way from Sunday but this recipe stands out as a clear winner. Hands down the best recipe for bone in, skin on chicken around. The herb combination is amazing, with no one herb standing out. Takes less than 2 minutes to whip together - I dredge the chicken in it, then rub it into the skin, front and back. I make a little extra to pour over top once in the pan. 

This is good also for skinless chicken, chicken thighs and also roasted potatoes. I have only substituted one thing and that is dehydrated onion when out of real onion and it still turns out perfect, otherwise have not changed a thing. 

Thank you so much for this recipe - my family literally cheers when I make this!

I only had skinless, boneless chicken breasts. I mixed the herbs and oil in a bowl, then poured into a ziplock adding the chicken. Let it set for about an hour. I poured out all into a baking pan. I thought maybe I should add a little water. I did, then thought...why not some white wine and fresh sliced mushrooms. I also covered with aluminum foil. Turned out excellent!!

I made this with boneless, skinless meat, and it was fabulous!!  Just reduce the cooking time to about 25 min. The herbs give it an unusual but great flavor.  Will have this again, for sure!!

This is a great recipe!  Of all the ingredients, I had garlic clove and dried chopped onion...for the rest, I replaced them with Emeril's Essence and it was outstanding.  Awesome said my daughter.  Perfect said the hubs.  Thanks!

Fantastic!!! I used bone in and skinless chicken breast. I marinated it in the olive oil/herb for about 1 1/2 hours. Baked at at 425 for about 30 minutes and took the foil off and baked it for another 10-15 minutes. Keep basting for moist chicken. Great combination of spices and smelled delicious while it is cooking

My boyfriend and I love this, and we have it over and over again.  I double the mixture (to make sure I have enough for basting) and add a tablespoon of lemon juice for a little more zest.  I also quarter some red potatoes and cook them with the chicken.  The flavor is always wonderful.  Thanks for this new favorite!

These are easy to prepare and wonderfully moist and delicious. I did change a few things. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I made the sauce up and placed the chicken with the sauce in a ziplock bag and let them marinate in the refrigerator for several hours. I baked them for 30 minutes covered, then took the foil off and turned the broiler on for about 10-15 minutes until they were nicely browned. My family loved them and I will make them again. They would be awesome on the grill.

I made this for dinner using bone in, skin on breasts and thighs.  I doubled the basting sauce ingredients and allowed the coated chicken to marinade for about 45 minutes.  The chicken was moist and my husband and children said it was 'good.'  The chicken did not really have much in the way of flavor; I was expecting a lot more, and as one reviewer said it was just sort of 'blah.'  Not a bad recipe, just not for us.

WONDERFUL recipe! I doubled the sauce as some suggested, and used skinless boneless chicken breasts. They took only 30 min at 425 and I didn't do any baisting. Served with garlic red mashed potatoes and corn. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I liked this basic recipe.  I wanted roasted chicken, but didn't want to spend the time and only had boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I did things a little differently. I first marinated boneless skinless chicken breasts in 1/2 cup white wine.  Then I also added lemon juice to the herb mix and increased the garlic.  I added chopped celery, onion, and carrots to the pan first with a little bit of chicken broth.  I topped that with the chicken breasts and wine and basted them with the herb mix.  I dabbed a little bit or margerine on top.  Covered it and cooked them for about 25-30 minutes.  Actually while the chicken marinaded in the wine, I started the vegetables in the oven to get a head start on the cooking.  I also sprinkled a little bit of poultry seasoning all over.  I think it turned out really good this way.  I served it with boiled (boiled in water/chicken broth) red potatoes with parsley and butter.

I suggest using chicken breats with the skin on - the skin is where the juice comes from and makes pan drippings.

The recipe is very good. The bone in breast took 45 min and was super moist. I skipped the hot sauce but I should not have. Need a little kick.

This is amazing.  I have made this multiple times, and I will say the measurements are pretty accurate, as once I tried not measuring and it didn't come out as well.  I use a 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce.  I also use a poultry seasoning in place of marjoram and sage which I don't ever have, and the seasoning has both in it.  I pour the whole sauce over the chicken and bake, basting every 15 minutes.  It's the most moist chicken I've ever made, and the flavor is amazing.

Definitely go with skin-on breasts.  I used boneless, skinless, as someone else had mentioned, and I think it's a fair assumption that the spices are so much more appropriate for a moister chicken which always comes with using skin-on.

I marinated the chicken breasts in the sauce, omitting the rosemary, marjoram and hot sauce, but it was still good.  Boneless skinless breasts only took 20-30 mins. @ 375 F.

This did add great flavor to baked chicken, though I found it didn't make very much sauce.  I used only 2 chicken breasts and made the full amount of basting sauce and barely had enough.   Very basic recipe and easy to make.  Went great with stuffing and a tasty salad.  I'll use this whenever I want to have baked chicken.

This was SO tasty.  I doubled the marinade based on others' recommendations and increased the amount of garlic to 5 cloves (we love garlic).  I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and baked them for about 45 min covered in foil.  The last 7 min I took the foil off and the chicken was amazingly moist.  I didn't even baste it during cooking.  Since my marinade was pretty thick I used it more as a rub on the chicken.  The whole family loved it.  Thanks for sharing!!

Followed the recipe pretty much, added a bit more of each spice to it, because I had 4 very huge chicken breasts. Added chopped up potatoes to the dish too before putting into the oven. Tasted good! Definitely a very good herb blend.

I was looking for a good way to prepare bone-in chicken breasts.  The chicken smelled awesome as it was cooking but in the end I was disappointed.  The taste was just OK.

Sorry...

Simple and delicious!  Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts so I reduced oven temp to about 375 and it was done in 30 minutes.  The only other change was to use fresh rosemary instead of dried.

This was fabulous!  My husband just started Weight Watchers, and I adapted this to be low points.  He loved it, and so did the rest of us!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.

Simple, quick, and oh, so good.  The fragrant herbs entice even before you cut into the chicken, which stays juicy thanks to the herb-infused basting sauce combined with the pan juices.

I really liked the chicken, so did my family. The blend of all spices is incredible, only I added a little bit of lemon juice. And first I browned it, since I had olive oil in sauce, and then I added some water and sauteed it. After I took it from the pan I tossed some baby spinach in the left juice. Was GREAT!!!!!

I was very pleased with the flavor of this recipe but not with its presentation. Because it is baked with a cover it remained very moist but it was extremely pale in color. Next time I will either brown the chicken breasts first or remove the cover 10 minutes, or so, before it is done to give it a bit of a golden color.

I was absolutely thrilled with this recipie! I changed it a bit according to my tastes and resourses; I added a little bit of pesto, substituted rosemary for oreagano, I cut out the parsley as well, and I didn't cover it so it blackened a bit. It was excellent though. It has become one of my boyfriend's favorite dishes and he asks me to make it all the time, (which I don't mid because it's quick and easy). Every one who's tried it has loved it.

I found this to be a very flavorful chicken recipe. I made it with boneless chicken breasts and adjusted the cooking time a bit and they turned out great. It's very quick and easy to prepare and the flavors really get into the meat. I will be making this again when I need a good dinner in a hurry with out much fuss.

This basting sauce is great with *or* without the parsley (I ran out one day and had to do without; now sometimes I make it without the parsley on purpose).  I've even used it on steak (without parsley) and it was fantastic.  I make it all the time now since I discovered it.  This is great for those who love good flavor, but don't want an overpowering single (boring) taste.

Keeping the chicken covered kept it pretty moist. I uncovered it for the last 15 minutes or so because I like a bit of a crust on my chicken. I didn't have marjoram or Sage, so I just used some poultry seasoning. My picky 4 year old said it was good, so I'm keeping it on my list!

I make this often and my family loves it! I use boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I coat potato chunks in the same basting sauce and cook at the same time as chicken and they all come out crispy and yummy. There are tasty juices on bottom of pan to spoon over the chicken and potatoes to serve. I bake at 425 until everything is browned and crisp, probably about 45 min.

Made this for dinner last night and was WOWED.  Couple of minor changes: brushed olive oil herb mixture on chicken and did not baste (no need).  Added chopped Yukon Gold potatoes to pan for roasted potatoes (shook potatoes in plastic bag of 1.5 tbs olive oil and herbs de provence) set oven at 425 for 50 mins and then upped to 450 for 10 mins so that the potatoes were crunchy brown and the chicken perfectly browned.  Family raved!

As some reviewers suggested, I doubled the recipe and added vegetables.  It was good, but it was very oily.  Next time I think I'll double the herbs and leave the olive oil at 3 T.  

Regardless, the flavor was nice, but I think it could have used a little more salt or some garlic or onion salt.  And I was very happy about the suggestion to include the vegetables to make it a one-dish meal.  Served with fresh bread and enjoyed.

THIS IS A EXCELLENT RECIPE AND I TOO ADDED POTATOES BECAUSE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE A VEG. I QUESS FRESH CARROTS WOULD WORK WITH THE POTATOES. I BAKED MY CHICKEN ONE HOUR AND REMOVED THE FOIL FOR ANOTHER 20 MINUTES TO BROWN AND IT DID NOT DRY THE CHICKEN OUT AT ALL.

THIS WAS AMAZING!!! I made this feeling doubtful and a little reluctent, but it turned out sooooooo good! I baked it in the oven for about an hour, but that was because the dish was deeper. The porportions were perfect and made just enough so I didn't have any basting sauce left over! I plan to make this over and over again!!!

I loved the flavors, moistness, ease and availibility of indredients in my pantry for this recipe.  I followed recipe closely with the exception of marinating chicken all day in rub, used dried parsley in place of fresh since I had it in the pantry and I also uncovered my breasts after 25 mins of cooking to brown the skin.  They were done in my oven in 50 minutes.  Thank you for the delicious dinner...!!  I WILL be making again.

I think I may be spoiled by the Rosemary Roasted Turkey recipe from this site (I use it for whole chickens on the rotisserie or for oven-roasting), and because it tastes so good, this recipe pales in comparison in taste.  However, I can see how if you haven't tried any olive oil/herb mixtures on chicken before, that you would be wow'ed by this recipe.  I don't think it's bad - I just didn't think it was as spectacular as all of the 5 star reviews.  I made the recipe as described except, I used skinless boneless chicken breasts at 375 degrees for 25 minutes.

This was a really tasty recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and it was still delicious. The herb mixture is great. I will definitely be making this again.

This was ok, not enough flavor even with all the herbs.  Good base to do more with, but not on the top 5 list.

This was recommended to me when I was looking for something for my non-cooking brother to make his new girlfriend. He said she thought he was a genius so I had try it for myself. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and uncovered them for the last 10 minutes of cooking. Fantastic I'll repeat this many times. Many Thanks.

Excellent!!!  I added 2 tbs. of lemon juice, and a pinch of tarragon.  I BBQed, and micro-waved the marinade, and used that as my baste.  Very juicy, and tender!

My husband made this for me on Mother's Day. It was delicious. He rarely cooks dinner, which makes it a very user friendly recipe. The whole family enjoyed the various flavors and I got a wonderful break. Highly recommend.

This was great!  I used 4 boneless skinless breast halves, cut in fourths, and tossed in a couple of chunked potatoes as well.  Lovely, and delicious.  I also uncovered it for the last 30 minutes of cooking.

Just okay. The herbs used in this recipe can be found in Poultry Seasoning, so why not just use that? I agree with many of the other reviewers that the chicken came out dry and there isn't enough sauce to baste with.

I've made this twice and both times it came out so good. I followed others and substituted basil and oregano for spices I didn't have (sage and marjoram). Will definitely keep this one.

This recipe was great!  I made it exactly as it was and it turned out wonderful.  What a wonderful combination of flavors!  I used the boneless skinless chicken breasts and used a meat thermometer to accurately bake.  Very tasty, very juicy, and very easy!!  A+

Thanks for this recipe, I love it!

WONDERFUL!!!  I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and laid the basted chicken (I DOUBLED the sauce/herb part!) on a bed of sliced, fresh mushrooms.  I baked covered for 45 minutes - then uncovered for 15 more minutes.  The mushrooms added thier own liquid - so the chicken was very moist!!!  Thanks - we even discussed using this herb/sauce on steaks too!!!!!!!!

This tasted SIMILAR to "Chicken Savoy" (w/o the balsamic vinegar) which uses less spices/ingredients, and I always make with just breasts. Very nice recipe but I miss the Balsamic vinegar flavor and the CRISPY skin of the Savoy.  Would have made again (if I hadn't tried the other prior).

Absolutely delicious! I did double the marinade, added 1/4 cup melted butter, 3 large quartered potatoes, and 8 oz. sliced mushrooms. Basted the chicken & veggies about every 10 minutes. During the last 8-10 minutes, I removed the cover to lightly brown the chicken and vegetables. This was fabulous!! Will definitely make again as the chicken was very moist & the potatoes were wonderful.

Like Zipporah, I used this on a whole chicken and it turned out fab.  Tender & juicy.  I agree that it did smell funky, I kept thinking that there was stuffing in the oven as well.  I threw some cut potatoes in with the chicken and the basting sauce & they turned out great as well.  Thanks Christine!!

Quick and easy.  This recipe tastes better to me when I chop up the chicken in to smaller pieces before rolling in sause and baking.  I also recommend using more olive oil than the recipes calls for.

I get repeated requests for this from my fiance and his family (especially his mother)!  This  is extremely easy even though the number of ingredients looks overwhelming at first.  A definite addition to my repitoire.

I made the recipe as written, and I was quite excited about all the herbs. I had one boneless/skinless large breast and 2 bone-in, skin-on thighs. I was kind of worried about covering the dish in the oven, as I thought it would result in a pale skin, and when I uncovered it midway, I saw it would never brown up. So I removed the  covering for the remaining time and continued baking until the thighs browned. Although it smelled good, we got no extra flavor from the coating.  Not a repeat for us. Thanks for sharing, though. You made lots of people happy.

The basting sauce is flavorful, but the chicken did not absorb enough taste from it and was rather bland.  I will not make this again.

Can you say yum? This chicken breast recipe is fantastic. I noticed someone put the chicken and sauce in a bag and let it marinate all day. I think I'll try that next time with all the seasonings and the sauce. I was a little skeptical of the hot sauce at first, but it blended well with the other flavors. It had a very faint kick- just the right amount for this recipe. Very flavorful, super delicious.

We love this herbed chicken so much that we added it to our week night meal rotation long ago! We always use boneless skinless chicken breast, and it's still quite tasty! We usually serve it with Asparagus Cashew Rice Pilaf, minus the cashews.

This will definitely be on my rotation! I tend to stay away from baked chicken dishes as they're always bland, dry or both. This recipe is the antidote to those problems. The skinless, boneless chicken breasts were moist and delicious. Definitely consider doubling the recipe -- so glad I did. I didn't have marjoram so used basil instead and added parsley to the mixture instead of as a topping. I also used 5 cloves of garlic ( love garlic!) and 1/4 cup of diced onions. In addition, I mixed together 1/4 cup of Sauvignon Blanc (it was already opened), 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and 1/4 cup of diced onion (onion fan here). I spread 2 tablespoons of the wine mixture on the baking pan before adding the herbed chicken breasts then poured the remaining wine mixture over the chicken. Baked for 20 minutes with the foil on then 20 minutes with it off followed by 3 minutes under the broiler made the perfect chicken!

Worthy of your fancy dishes for company or quick week night meal on those everyday plates.I don't do not sauce so I left it out.After all it has pepper.I fixed all the ingredients the night before in a zip lock bag.At dinner I simply followed the cooking instructions.I had sweet potatoes and beets to use so I wrapped them in foil with olive oil and garlic.I put them in the oven as the chicken baked.This needs to go to the top of my favorites.

Best breasts EVER!!! 
I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used FRESH ROSEMARY. Don't be afraid of the long spice list. It's all SO worth it! I made it with 2 HUGE bone-in, skin-on breasts, so big that the two of us could only snarf 1 of them (with the red potatoes & fresh green beans I made with it).
This left me with my fave ingredient... LEFTOVER CHICKEN to make Chicken Philly Cheese-steaks out of (I do this regularly, with leftover chicken).  The flavor from the original recipe made the BEST Chicken Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches EVER! (I know, 'cause my wife even said so!) 2 hours later, I can STILL smell the aroma... from LEFTOVERS! (YUM!)
I'd love to submit the sandwich recipe, on its own, but I'd have to do the whole original recipe, for this chicken, first. 
This recipe MADE it!!! It's THAT GOOD!!!

This was excellant!  Didn't change a thing except as someone else commented, remove foil/lid about 20 minutes before taking out of the oven for a crispier finish.  I think this may be the most moist baked chicken I have ever cooked!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

These chicken breasts turned out very moist with beautiful coloring and flavor.  As suggested by another reviewer, I removed the foil with approx 15 minutes left to let the skin crisp.

what a fabulous, no sweat, can't mess up recipe!! I followed the recipe,but didn't add sage, cuz I don't like it and I  didn't take out a measuring spoon, but I did make more of the basting sauce than called for.. doubled it pretty much.  I had 5 large bone in half breasts with skin on. I combined the ingredients and allowed to sit for aabout half hour.. then I rubbed some under the skin and above, and placed in oven, I only basted once during cooking. I did place fresh rosemary sprigs on top of each breast during last 10/15 minutes of cooking.  When I served, I basted with pan juices.. was yummmmy!! EVERYONE loved it!!

Pretty disappointing - I made it with skinless, boneless meat & followed the recipe.  The flavor was bland - I am shocked at all the 5 star reviews!  I'm giving it 2 stars because the chicken was nice and moist but where was the basting sauce?  After it was done, I made a citrus dijon mustard/butter sauce because I felt it needed more flavor.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  We altered the spices to our tastes (next time, I will not use nearly so much thyme), and I guarantee this will become a staple in our kitchen.  I'll probably mix it up by varying the spices and making complimentary sauces to go with it.  We used a nice mushroom/onion/garlic bechamel, and this was just delicious.  We used the recipe for two boneless skinless breasts and three thighs.  Because they were skinless, I started it out at 400 to get the internal temp up and try to keep from burning the outside.  Then, we they were almost done, we upped it to 425 to get the internal temperature right.  Probably took a total of 50 minutes.  I basted twice during the process, and they came out perfect and oh-so-juicy.  Like I said, we will be making this recipe multiple times in the future.  Thanks for sharing!

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever tried. The only thing that I did different was to bake it much longer. I guess my chicken breasts were very thick. I did uncover so the breast would brown at the end.  I basted it a few times and then made a thin gravy out of the drippings with milk and flour. Yummy!

My husband says he could eat this every night. I prefer fish to chicken so I make it with Tilapia. I make it exactly as written, but keep forgetting to buy marjoram and parsley, so I throw in some frozen basil cubes. Perfect recipe!

Excellent! I did not have any marjoram, but used the rest of the ingredients. I used boneless skinless. Like other users, I baked the chicken covered for 25 minutes and then uncovered them for the last 20 to get them golden brown. The chicken was juicy and very flavorful.

I was extremely surprised at all the great reviews! I used the bone in/skin on chicken breasts as called for in the recipe.  During roasting, there was barely any juice for basting.  Also, because we don't eat the skin of the chicken, we found it kind of bland, although it was quite moist. I will probably not make this again.

Great, I marinated boneless chicken in the basting sauce with the addition of 1T. lemon juice and 1/4c. red wine, also I didn't use pepper sauce, I used 1/4t. of cayenne pepper, then cooked along with the marinade and it was amazing.

If you are looking for a light chicken meal with great taste.... this was perfect.  I did add some fresh lemon juice as well as chicken stock.  I used the reserve sauce as grave for my husband's mashed potatos.  Would make again!

Flavorful and moist. I forgot to spoon the sauce because I was busy cooking other things. Also, because of baking other dishes I added 5-10 minutes to the recipe, being as though I kept opening the oven. This in no way dryed the chicken. Came out juicy and tender. A great way to use your spice rack and a nice change to average chicken. Will make again.

This was very yummy! I just made it tonight. Wish I could have everyone over for dinner and serve this. I didn't have sage, so that was not in there, but I added cumin and 1 C chicken broth (needs a bit more than that even) and put new potatoes and a little bit of yellow squash in the pan with it. MUST DO: baste, baste, baste! I cooked 3 chicken breasts (boneless) on 375 for 1 hour, 10 mins. Overdone for most people, but that's how I like my chicken. I'm sure for others, 50 to 60 mins. would be fine. Next time, I'm adding more chicken broth and more rosemary!

I was very disappointed.  Baked the chicken for 40 minutes and even tho I had basted it during the cooking time, it was dry and not very flavorful.  There were no drippings to spoon over the chicken when presenting for serving.

This was VERY EASY and VERY GOOD! A very tasty chicken dish; the olive oil and fresh herbs made this wonderful!!! Served this with baked brown rice on this web site.    This is simple enough and week night dinners, but I think I'll put this on my "company menu" plan too! It's a dish that almost everyone will like!!

This was delicious!  I followed the advice of others and marinated the chicken for several hours, used fresh rosemary and thyme, and substituted 1 TB lemon juice for the hot sauce.  I also covered the dish for 25 minutes and uncovered it for the last 25 minutes.

Big hit with the family and I loved not just the taste but how easy this was to make.  I did follow some of the reviews and marinated the chicken for few hours, added potatoes, and doubled the spices.  And I just had to add my own twist by adding about 4 tbs of white wine.  Will make again soon.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW!  I doubled the herb mixture (subbed extra thyme and some tarragon for rosemary), added about 2 c. halved mini yellow potatoes and about 1 c. halved crimini mushrooms (add shrooms about half way through baking.)  The aroma was divine, the chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the mushrooms were to die for.

Tender and juicy-- good flavor.  Just be sure to roast long enough to crisp up the skin (I had to cook mine a bit longer than indicated in the recipe).

I used boneless/skinless and doubled the oil and spices because the chicken breasts I used were HUGE. I also let it marinate for a couple of hours. It's good if you like eating a big slab of meat.

Very good!  I added lemon juice, potatoes and had no parsley but it was a great dinner.  Had to cook a little longer because of the potatoes but the chicken was still very moist and yummy.

I really like this recipe.  I read some of the other reviews and tweaked it a little. I stabbed the chicken breast many times, combined the rest of the ingredients and then put it in the fridge of an hour, flipping it once. Instead of basting I simply put a dab of butter and made a basket out of tin foil and put it in a 450 deg oven for 45 minutes.  Just great

Excellent recipe.  I marinated it overnight, then threw it all in a pan to bake, no basting necessary.  Very tasty!

For being a simple recipe it turned out good.  The chicken was juicy and tender.  I had paired the chicken with Au Gratin potatoes.  Will make again.

The best thing I can say is that it was juicy.  It did not have enough flavor at all and seemed bland to me and my husband.  The only thing I was missing was the marjoram.  I also added white wine.  I kind of think this could have stood some lemon juice and maybe worstershire but I didn't try it.  Not a fan of this at all.

This was o.k.  The chicken breasts eneded up being very juicy and moist and that I loved, but the seasonings didn't permeate throughout.  That is usually why I take the skins off.  I may try again but just remove the skins.  Will see.

LOVED this recipe!  I'm just getting back to cooking after a 5 year love affair with fast food and honestly couldn't remember how to cook a chicken breast in the oven and had to think fast.  I made a couple quick changes to it because of what I had on hand and they turned out great - used 1/4 cup olive oil, used poultry seasoning instead of the list of spices (didn't have time to drag them out), skipped the parsley and hot sauce as I didn't have them.  I spooned the drippings over it every 15 minutes and pulled off the foil for another 5 minutes after 45 minutes (I used huge breasts and they weren't to 160 yet).  Thanks SO much for a great recipe!

This is a wonderful tasty basting sauce.  I doubled the recipe because we like a lot of flavor, and it turned out wonderfully.  The next time we cook a turkey breast on the smoker, we will use this recipe to baste it.  Yummy!

This was fabulous.   I had all the ingredients on hand, except fresh parsley.    I prepared the basting sauce, covered the chicken breasts (front and back) with the sauce, covered them and put them in the frig for a few hours.   This just added to the wonderful flavor.   Love it.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  However, I had to eliminate a couple of seasonings because I didn't have them.  I also added more olive oil and used boneless chicken breasts.  Regardless, it was delicious!

The chicken pieces I got were Perdue (huge) so it took substantially longer to bake.  There wasn't any basting sauce for quite a while. I just kept it covered & basted when I could. It was good, but I think I'll try the sauce (adjusting spices to 1/2t thyme, 1/4t rosemary & 1/4t pepper - the rest as listed) on roasted potatoes.  That sounds yum.

I disagree with the folks who thought that the chicken turned out dry.  Ours not only turned out very moist, but also DELICIOUS.  I upped the herbs a little bit, as I want my herbed chicken to be almost green with them.  Thanks for a GREAT and SIMPLE recipe.

This recipe was okay. We used it as fajita and it worked with the guacamole, cheese, etc. But as a stand alone dish we didn't care for it much. I grilled the chicken so maybe that had something to do with it.

I had high hopes for this based on the great reviews, but even though I used fresh herbs, rubbed some under the skin and marinated 3 hours and basted while cooking, the taste did not penetrate.  Sorry, but thanks for sharing.

Great!  When my 4-year old came into the kitchen and said "WHAT'S STINKY?" I was sure I didn't have a winner.  The herbs give a very strong aroma while cooking, but I was pleasantly surprised that the flavor was not at all overwhelming.  My husband, 4 and 6-year-old give it thumbs up.

I made this recipe for the first time for company tonight, and I was somewhat disapointed. More olive oil is definitely called for enough basting sauce to cover 4 chicken breasts. (the recipe was scaled for 2-4) I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which looked a sickly gray by the end of the cooking time, and I did use dried, bottled herbs, rather than fresh. Although I noticed that fresh herbs were not specified in the recipe, I wonder if the addition could have added the oomph that this recipe lacked. There was really nothing special about it, although I do plan to try it again based on the other reviews. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere, although this recipe seemed rather simple...

This recipe is great and never fails.  I have used bone in chicken breasts and boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I have marinated and not marinated.  Every time it has turned out perfectly.  A definite staple in this house!  Wonderful, tender and flavorful.  5 stars!!  -  especially because it is SO easy.

This turns out very good! Don't let appearances fool you. When my family saw it they joked and said, "Oh, look we get chicken covered in grass!" But they ate every last bite. It is a very good recipe.

This is not bad if you just want a simple sort of marinade; however, it's nothing too special.

This recipe is a keeper as it delivers! The chicken is moist and flavorful. You must use bone in chicken breast and if you wish add the paprika for color. EXCELLENT results and definitely I will make it again no questions about it!

This recipe was amazing! I didn't put in the hot pepper sauce though. I added red potatoes with similar seasoning and covered the dish with tin foil so it all cooked together. Mine took about  an hour and a half to cook that way. I didn't leave the skin on either. The last 30mins I left it uncovered to brown a bit. I will definitely be making this dish again! It was a big big hit! :)

My family of four loved this!  I made double the seasoning for six chicken breasts, although they were quite large.  I marinated them for a couple of hours in a ziploc bag before cooking.  I added fingerling potatoes, sliced onion and fresh green beans  in the baking pan as well as about a cup of chicken broth per other reviews.  It did take quite a bit longer to cook though.  About an hour to an hour and 15 minutes total.  The chicken was very tender, juicy and tasty with just the right amount of spice :)

I would like to give it more stars as it tasted great, it's did not look anything like the photo. It didn't  brown at all. When I knew chicken was done, I even left it in the oven a couple of minutes under the broiler but didn't help.

Ours appeared brown(ish) grayish, almost looking like it had been boiled. Not the most appealing thing to look at and nothing like picture, but actually tasted great! 

Will maybe try again, but not sure how to get the expected results with baking it covered.

Easy does it!  I just grab my Mrs Dash no salt seasoning shaker in either the Table Blend or Original Blend and sprinkle it on everything! No more wasted jars of expensive seasonings. Great on most cooked or raw veggies, meats, seafood, poultry.

I made this exactly as written, but added one red potato to the pan.  The chicken turned out very tender and the flavor of the spices as written was good, but there wasn't enough to baste.  I didn't think there was enough sauce to baste.  Also, the skin, although keeping the chicken very moist didn't brown at all.

My thoughts for the next time I make this because I did like it:  I will double the sauce and add way more garlic because I love to  eat it when it has been roasted and it was delicious the first time.  I would also add some moisture after the first basting and cook the chicken in a cast-iron skillet so I can put it under the broiler.  Other than that, I loved the flavor, but would have liked more of the sauce.

I made this with bone-in skin on chicken breasts and used Naples34102's advice of uncovering the last 20 minutes for a nice brown and crispy skin.  Delicious and tender. Will use this recipe again and again!

Ready to go to the next level?  Brine the chicken this way:  I took fresh herbs on the ingredient list mix them with 4 smashed garlic cloves, 1/3 cup  salt and water to cover then fridged for 20 hours. Subsequently, I followed the recipe.  People have been known to bow in front of me during meals. Always brine your chicken.

Only had skinless and boneless breast which I brine ahead of time for 30 minutes. First time I've tried it. Followed the recipe otherwise with oven at 375 for 20 minutes covered, then 20 minutes uncovered. It was juicy and delicious! Will definitely make again.

Make sure you check doneness after 30 minutes. 45 minutes left it a bit dry. Herb mix was great!

I'm always looking for new chicken recipes, and this one was very good.  I left out the hot sauce, and my seasonings were not fresh but dried.  I used boneless skinless breasts and they were not dried out or tough, but moist and tender.  Will definitely make this again.

This was amazing. I made it exactly as described except with 4 full chicken breasts. I made it instead of thanksgiving turkey.... And I think I looked it even better with gravy than turkey would have tasted. Will definitely be making this again!

This is a wonderful, simple but versitle recipe. There are many ways to vary the spices and flavor. I followed it as written. The breast pieces I bought were large so my cooking time had to be longer. I just used a meat thermometer. I think that I would try a spicy sweet sauce sometime. Thank you for a great basic recipe.

This was quite good.  Used bone in breasts and cooked for a little over an hour. The sauce was fantastic and there was plenty to go around.  I'd make it again.  The only thing I did differently was omit the marjoram because I was out.  
Yummy and very juicy.

This recipe is even better if you stuff tapenade under the skin of the chicken. It becomes so moist and flavorful.

This is a great recipe. I made soup the next day with the leftover chicken and the bones.  And that was the best chicken soup I ever had.  Must be the combination of herbs.

I used the ingredients of this dish to marinade some chicken breast tenderloins I had, and they were amazing!  I simply put all of the ingredients in a Ziploc bag and sealed it for a couple of hours.  After that, I just cooked them in a skillet for several minutes/side.  So easy and so tasty!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts rather than the bone in chicken breasts with skin.  Everything else I made as the recipe called for.  The chicken seemed a little dry and I thought it would have been a little more flavorful than it was.  I thought it was just ok.

Used all ingredients as stated.  Would cut down the 'black pepper' by at least 1/2 next time (the whole family found it almost overpowering).  As for process, I prepared the basting sauce, and used 2/3 of it to marinate the breasts for a few hours in the fridge.  When it was time to bake, I used the remaining 1/3 to coat 4 cut up potatoes, and added these to the same baking dish as the chicken.  Chicken was very tender, and the potatoes took in the flavors very well.

I do wonder if I'm missing something.  My chicken was almost perfectly moist, but the flavor (and this is where I'm confused) is respectable, but very subtle.  Dare I say, bland...Maybe it's just my palate or possibly this is my first time cooking chicken breast so I just don't know.  I'm a dark meat girl, so my point of reference was something more moist and flavorful.  I know that to correct the moisture problem, the next time I ensure that no part of the chicken overlaps (made me think that the entire chicken was not done, when it was really only that small portion).  Otherwise, I used a skinless bone in chicken breast that I covered the entire time for 40 min.  I think I can also take 5 min off the baking time.  I noticed that other baked chicken recipes had lower temperatures, but I think that with these minor changes, my meat will come out perfectly moist and not cause anyone food poisoning.  Before I repeat this recipe though, I will try recipes where the chicken is marinated in an acid/oil combo and see if that does not give me the dish I am seeking.

Was looking for a bone-in, healthy  chicken recipe  -  Just made this-- it has such wonderful flavor  - and is so juicy.  I did use a little chicken broth for first basting but then juice came & used those.   Will definitely keep this as a favorite.

Very simple and good!  I just placed the chicken in the pan, poured the basting sauce over it all, and used my hands to make sure it coated completely while rubbing the herbs in.  I did as another reviewer suggested and removed the foil during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking to brown it slightly.  I also turned the chicken over once.  I used a brush instead of a baster to distribute the sauce while cooking.  The chicken came out so tender and juicy, and very flavorful too.  I didn't change much except using dry parsley and adding it with the other herbs, and eliminating the hot sauce.  I used split, bone-in chicken breasts and left the skin on while roasting.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I didn't know what some of the ingredients were actually but I used them, WOW. The aroma was so inviting, and the taste was amazing. The chicken was tender and juicy.

This dish was phenomenal!!! I followed the recipe completely except I had no hot sauce. It was still amazing!!!

I did double the recipe for the marinade and I'm so glad I did! I used skinless, boneless, chicken breasts - and did NOT pound them smaller. Instead, I cut them in half so they would cook in time. In 45 minutes, I had scrumptious, juicy chicken! 

Thank you so much! I thought this would be a boring recipe - and instead I'll be making this every other week - it's SO GOOD!!!!

Wonderful recipe, I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for my chicken breasts.  This is it, I had everything in my cupboard and made is just as the recipe directed.  It was delicious, juicy so good and my house smelled so good.  What a treat, I will be making this again for sure.

Very good!  I was going to attempt doing this on the grill and using the sauce as a basting sauce.  But the weather changed and rather than have Hubs stand out in the rain and baste, I decided to do it in the oven as the recipe instructs.  I covered this for about half of  the baking time and mine roasted perfectly in 35 minutes and was moist and flavorful.  My only disappointment was that this didn’t brown very well, even though I slipped it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end.  Regardless, I would make this one again.

I'm not sure what happened, but this was not good.  I used boneless chicken breasts and baked at 375 for about 35 minutes (covered for the first 25 minutes).  They were tough and just not good.

Four stars for the flavor. Very tasty. I did, however, change it up a bit.  I added a half stick of butter into the marinade and a cup of chicken broth because I simply could not see how it was going to be enough. I browned my chicken and then baked w/ marinade and green beans scattered throughout.  Last 15min of cooking, I removed foil and added breadcrumbs/parmesan mixture and drizzled with juices and baked.  Whole house ate it and went for seconds (including 13 year old).

Very Tasty!!! I did have to make a few substitutions as I did not have oil, red onions or white rice. Instead I used cooking onion browned in butter, and Basmati rice. I also only used half the pepper suggested & just before serving I added about 3/4c  cooked from frozen green peas. Wonderful recipe, will do it again :)

I've made this twice now...the 1st time it was excellent, the 2nd time not so good, but that was strictly because I cooked too long & dried them out.  If you make sure not to overcook your chicken this is an excellent recipe.  I also think I might try butter instead of oil next time.

I've made this a few times over the years, trying and wanting to like it - thinking I'd done something wrong, but I've decided this just isn't for us.  I don't understand it since there are fabulous reviews for it.  I find it bland, and not exciting.  I'm glad everyone else has better luck, although I wish I was one of them.  :(

I made this last night with skinless, boneless chicken breasts, and it turned out to be one of the best chicken meals I've ever made.  My picky 3 year old even loved it.  Great recipe!

Fixed almost exactly except I did not have any Rosemary. I also put all in  a plastic bag and added the chicken breast. Scrunched it with my hands and put in the oven, covered the pan with foil until the last 10 min. Basting a couple of times. YUMMY, the juice was savory and would  make a good gravy if  thickened

This wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be, which was a surprise with all the seasonings in it.  I used skinless chicken breasts and that may have contributed.  I doubled the sauce and was very glad I did.  It wouldn't have covered all the chicken otherwise!  Baked covered for 40 minutes and then uncovered the last 5 minutes.

This recipe is amazing!  However, we don't use the fresh parsley, and instead of chicken, we basted the sauce over a turkey breast roast.  It was the best herb roasted turkey I have EVER eaten.

Very good. So easy that my boyfriend made it! We used a pound of boneless skinless chicken breasts and omitted the fresh parsley. We didn't baste at all while cooking, but the chicken was still nice and juicy. I actually thought the flavors were a little bit too strong, so I might cut back just a tad next time I make this.

Chicken was very moist, but it wasn't as flavorful as I expected from the reviews.  I'll probably try again, double the hot sauce and marinade the chicken for longer.  My picky 7 year old, however, loved it!

Excellent - I doubled the spices (except for the rosemary which I've never cared for much) and used whole chicken pieces. I roasted it on 425 for about 45 minutes and then put the grill on for two minutes to make it extra crispy. It was a hit.

We liked this - I had 2 large bone-in chicken breasts (only 2 of us) but actually doubled the herb mix. Marinated for about 2 hours in the herb mixture before baking. Ommited the hot sauce and basted every 15 mins.  Will definitely make again.

I used chicken legs with the bone.  Breast w/ or w/out bone is known to be bland, no matter what.    Added fresh parsley.  I believe this dish would be best if all ingredients were fresh.  Either case, it was great.    I served with a side of parmesan asparagus.    Believe it or not, the dish was much better as leftover.  I also marinated the chicken overnight.

I used boneless breast and seared each side in very hot olive oil for a few minutes to brown the breasts.  The chicken was tender and tasty.

I just made this,and it is delicious!!!The only changeI made was to add 1/4 lime juice... I used boneless chicken breast, roasted it in the oven. My DH was concerned, but insisted this was some of the best chicken. I used 3 of the breasts to make chicken salad - IT IS FABULOUS!!!!!Thank you so much for this recipe, it be a staple in our house.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I have made it twice within the last week.  The first time I cooked as described just doubled the recipe and added potatoes as suggested by another reviewer.  The second time I cooked the same way but with pork chops, was just as good.  Thanks so much for an awesome recipe, this ones a keeper!

Strong herb flavor. Easy. I would make this again. A bonus is that it's make with spices you probably already have at home.

Excellent!!! I used 4 boneless/skinless chicken breasts halves. Had all spices except  sage, so I used Poultry Seasoning, which had everything in this original recipie and in addition Nutmeg. I substituted 2 tsps of this instead of the, thyme, rosemary sage, marjoram, salt, black pepper. I placed in medium glass cooking dish, covered with foil and cooked at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. Uncovered for the last 10 minutes and then put on broil for 3 additional minutes. Very, very good!!! Served with Sauteed Garlic Asparagus on this website (made with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil that another reader suggested). Thank you! I will for SURE make this again!!!

This was pretty good and healthy chicken.  Next time I will add a touch of lemon juice for a little more flavor.  Other than that this is a good quick and easy recipe.  Used boneless breast instead of bone-in.  Thanks will make again and try on the grill this summer.

Moist and juicy Chicken, perfect blend of seasoning. I, too baked uncovered for the last 20 minutes and the skin was golden brown.  I'm going to use this blend of herbs next time I roast a whole chicken (under the skin as well as on top).  Will add this one to my favorites. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for dinner tonight and my family loved it!  My son is a big eater and he thought it was great.  Definitely recommend taking the cover off for about 10-15 min. at the end. I did baste and think it helped keep it moist. I didn't use the parsley and it was fine.

Very good. Followed exactly except used boneless skinless breasts, cooked for about 30 mins.  I didn't have time to marinade this but will definitely do so the next time just for comparison. Thanks for the recipe. Very moist chicken.

I thought this was an excellent recipe and very simple to follow. I marinated the chicken in the oil and spices for about 2 hours and then cooked it uncovered for 30 minutes. I cut up the chicken and mixed it in a salad.  I also thought you could add it to pasta and it would be great.

Very good...kids & husband enjoyed this one too.  Substituted poultry seasoning for sage since we ran out.  Also used 6 drumsticks w/the skins on.  Had lots of flavor and was very moist & juicy.  Served w/rice and asparagus.

My wife, teen daughter and I all liked it and I was asked to make again.  Followed the recipe as written. I get a kick out of people who change the recipe then don't like the outcome. Skinless, boneless chicken could very well be dryer. Thanks

Delicious! I didn't have hot pepper sauce so I went without. I doubled the recipe and added potatoes. Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I thought the chicken was a little dry but my husband didn't. Next time I will cover with foil to help keep the moisture in. I will definitely make this again though.

I thought this was really good! On the advice of other reviewers, I substituted basil and oregano for the marjoram and rosemary, added a cup of chicken broth to the pan and brushed a tablespoon of melted butter over the chicken right before putting in the oven. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because my husband didn't seem to love it. When I asked him how it was, all he said was "It's fine". I thought it was great!

This dish was pretty bland, and the drippings weren't really enough to use for basting.  If I were to make this again (which I wouldn't), I'd probably use the ingredients as a marinade.

Wonderfully seasoned!! Yum! Even my very picky friend loved them.  Easy to make, although a bit of a hassle to bend into the oven every so often to baste the chicken.

Sorry but this didn't do it for me. The chicken was dry and rubbery, not crispy-skinned like I prefer. Maybe using fresh chicken that has not been frozen first would help.

Very good combination of herbs and spices.  Definitely brown the chicken prior to baking. We overcooked the chicken a little (typical at our house) but otherwise it was good.

Very moist!  My chicken breasts are usually kinda dry.  I had 5 HUGE boneless/skinless breasts which were still partially frozen.  I did what others did with a few modifications.  I used 1/2 fresh herbs and 1/2 dried - that's what I had on hand.  I doubled the amount of basting sauce.  I baked it covered for 20 min of 425 then 20 minutes uncovered.  I also then put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to give it a golden color (otherwise they were too pale looking and the kids wouldn't eat).  Watch out for the splattering of the olive oil - don't let it get too close to the broiler or you'll have fire.  They were so moist!   A definite repeat!  But I must say the fresh herbs did add a "fresh-light" taste.

Wonderful, healthy, tasty way to cook chicken breasts!  I cut the recipe to make only 1 serving for supper and cooked it in a foil packet - no cleanup, and the flavor was infused throughout the meat!  Will definitely make again.

GREAT! I followed a variation of some of the other reviews. I added about a tbsp of melted unsalted butter to the mixture, and doubled the hot sauce. I also baked at 375 covered for 20 minutes, then uncovered for 20 minutes.

Delicious.  I have to admit I changed the recipe a lot, though.  Here's my "easy-breezy summertime" variation: First, I used all fresh herbs from my garden instead of dried.  Second, I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, which are faster/easier to defrost and clean.  I marinated the chicken in the basting sauce for about an hour.  Then, since it was too hot to turn on the oven, I sauteed them by pouring the whole deal - chicken, marinade and all - into a large, high-sided pan on med/high.  After the chicken was browned and cooked, I place it in a serving dish, then added about 1/3 cup of white wine to the pan, simmered the sauce for ten minutes to reduce, then poured it over the chicken.  Then I sprinkled the fresh parsley on top.  Everyone loved it.  I will probably try the original recipe when the weather cools down!

This was most tasty!  I actually chopped up my chicken, and tossed it with the remaining "dressing" in the pan with some Romaine lettuce for a nice herbal chicken salad!  Try it!

This is an excellent recipe -- it's quick, easy and therresults are outstanding!  I used 6 boneless, skinless breasts and increased the olive oil by a Tbsp and the spices accordingly.  I took the advice of another reviewer and basted the breasts in the drippings about every 10 - 12 minutes and the chicken was extremely moist and flavorful.  This one will make it on our table at least once a week.

I used skinless, boneless breasts in making this recipe.  First, I had very little sauce or drippings, and second, the chicken was extremely dry.

Excellent chicken dish!  I doubled the marinade, added two large baking potatoes cut into quarters, added a 1/2 stick melted butter to the baking dish prior to putting the chicken and potatoes in to bake, and served it with the "Salad with Artichokes".  Excellent.

Made this last night and used tenderloins instead of the whole breasts. It was ok. I did not care for it, neither did my son. Hubby loved it though which kind of surprised me. Just way too many spices! May make it again only using just a few of the spices that I really like but as is...I would not reccomend it.

This chicken was very flavorful and juicy. I used fresh parsley and a bit more oil. After "marinating" for 3 hours in the refrigerator, I browned the chicken in a hot skillet and then baked it.  I wouldn't call an oil and herb mixture a sauce or a marinade, but it was still a good way to season bone-in chicken breasts.

I'm from Houston and I like herby and spicy foods.  This recipe is excellent!  For juicier chicken, I double the spices and add a can of Campbell's chicken broth, rotating chicken and basting.

My family loved this; the only thing I did differently is that I grilled the breasts after marinating them and then basted them while grilling with a second batch of the sauce. I made these for our pastor and family also and received rave reviews. Definitely a keeper!!

I made this today exactly as the recipe is written and it came out great! Very moist and tasty! My husband, who’s not a big fan of chicken, said how good it smelled while baking and actually gave positive comments on the flavor (yay!) I did have to bake it a bit longer (45 mins.) I’m assuming it was because the split breasts were a bit large? Thanks for great chicken recipe!

Followed the recipe except I used skinless chicken breasts. I doubled the marinade and tossed some quartered potatoes into it.

The chicken came out moist, but the flavor was just okay. However, the potatoes tasted delicious with this marinade.

!Sometimes simple is best. This chicken is so good. I did melt a bit of butter to add to the pan because I threw some baby Yukon Gold potatoes in to roast with the chicken. I let the chicken rest when I pulled it from the oven and sliced on the diagonal. Elegant, easy and yummy

It should be called 5 star chicken! Tender juicy with so much flavor. I used bone in breasts which can be dry when baked. Not these! I like that it doesn’t have a lot of salt or fat. Healthy yet tasty and moist. Winner winner!

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  Will definitely make it again.  Only changes I made was to skip the marjoram as I didn't have any on hand and added a 1/8 tsp. of salt.  Next time will try it with the marjoram.

I used bone in thighs with the skin.
I also used the herb oil that comes with the mozzarella balls sold at Trader Joe's instead of the olive oil.
Added the juice of half a lemon.
Cut 3 Yukon gold potatoes in half and marinated them in the oil herb mixture.
Covered with foil for 25 min, removed foil and cooked another 15 min.
Fantastic!

Made this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Didn't change anything else in the recipe.  The chicken was tender and very flavorful.  Will definitely make this again!

It was juicy, but lacked a little flavor. I’ll try tweaking the herbs next time. Also only use nine in chicken boneless is just not good to roast maybe grill it if you use boneless.

Really good.  I did not have marjoram or sage so had to leave those off but still tasted great!  I used dried minced onion b/c that is what I think it was supposed to be verses fresh.  We also don't like hot sauce so kept that off. Uncovered it towards the end to brown the skin.

I made this and marinaded boneless/skinless chicken breasts all day. I did rotate the chicken every couple of hours so it was totally coated all over. I did adjust the cooking time accordingly, and it was fantastic. This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be used frequently.

Delicious flavor and nice moist chicken. Followed recipe as written but added some sliced sweet potatoes along side the chicken.   My only suggestion is to double the amount of marinade and NOT TO COVER so it gets nice and crispy!

I found the quantity of sauce in the recipe only covered the chicken and left none for basting. Nice flavor, will increase quantity of sauce next time. 
Works for skinless, boneless chicken breasts cooked at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes.
Used leftover chicken in a casserole the next evening and liked the seasoning already in the meat.

I added a bit of sugar as it was too bland.  All the spices the recipe calls for are in the same family and it needed a bit of sprucing up.  I will most likely not make it again as I have umpteen chicken dishes that are a whole lot better.

Thought the flavors were good and used fresh thyme and rosemary as had them on hand. Put 1/2 marinade mixture under the skin and half on top. Wonderful smell and since we remove skin after cooking all that flavor was lost. The flavor just did not penetrate through the entire breast.   So  It was good enough that I will try again and will cut into the breast and put 1/2 marinade in the chicken, the other half under skin and none on top.  
I did uncover last 15 minutes of cooking  and skin was golden brown. I also prepared chicken and put in fridge for a few hours to marinade before cooking. 
Will try again with changes so all the meat is flavored

Awful.  Needs to use boneless, skin on chicken thighs for flavor.  Quintuple "basting sauce"; reserve one part for basting, use 4 parts to marinate overnight in a  sealed plastic bag.  Both the basting sauce and the marinade need at least double the garlic  and onion called for.

If using the typicay dry chicken breast, might not hurt to start this 36 hours ahead of when you want to serve it,  and brine the chicken breasts for 12 hours  befote marinating.

As written, this is flavorless and a waste of good herbs.

Fantastic!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and cooked at 400 for about 35 minutes.  Forgot to cover, but with chicken thighs that didn't matter.  I flipped and basted after 20 minutes.  I also cut up a russet potato, 3 carrots, and a large onion, mixed those with the leftover marinade, and cooked them in a 9x13 dish with the chicken.  The veggies were fantastic (potatoes needed to cook a hair longer than everything else - broiled those at the end after removing chicken), and everything was devoured!

Amazing flavor,used half of the leftover chicken to make chicken gnocchi soup and the herbs already on the meat made the soup even better.

This chicken was yummy!  I used boneless, skinless breasts and cooked at 375 degrees, 20 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered at the suggestion of some other reviewers.  Versatile main dish that can be served with lots of different side dishes.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Did not like.  I had everything this recipe required.  Bland as ever and I even seasoned the chicken with additional salt and pepper prior to coating it with the mixture.

i thought it was great.  i was searching for a recipe to use my abundance of marjoram, & this was perfect.  i don't understand how anyone found this recipe  bland.   herbs/garlic/hot sauce connotes anything but bland.  possibly outdated herbs contributed...i used fresh from the garden herbs,  & the combination of marjoram, sage, thyme, rosemary & parsley are not only fragrant but delicious.   my sage was pineapple sage & had a very subtle edge & balanced the rosemary & marjoram perfectly.   also i used chinese hot sauce, it was all i had, as well i sprinkled red pepper flakes into the oil liberally...that provided plenty of heat.  i used a bulb of organic garlic.  love my garlic.  the chicken was organic, no doubt that makes a difference, not only in food value (studies show the body processes  organic by up to 60% better( so what you gain in buying cheaper you lose in what the body utilizes)) but taste.  i marinated it for about 4hrs in the herb, onion, garlic, oil combo.  baked it covered on a bed of carrots, diced beets, mushrooms, potatoes, onions & garlic, which cooks down to make a very hearty 'country' gravy.  tossed in some white wine & a little chicken broth.  took another poster's suggestion & sprinkled it with hungarian paprika to ensure a nice colour.   next time i'll probably stuff artichoke hearts & goat cheese under the skin & bone.  DH liked it, but he prefers coq au vin or italian chicken, that's why only 4 stars, however, i loved it. also because my breast w

I bought bone-in chicken breasts for half the price of boneless. This recipe was perfect for them. I added all the stated ingredients, along with juice from one lemon, to a large plastic bag and shook the bag to evenly distribute. I set it the fridge for three hours, turning a few times. I cooked for a full hour, basting a couple times and removed the foil with 20 mins cooking time left. After removing from oven, I loosely covered with foil and rested the meat for 15 mins. Delicious!  We had leftovers and my hub enjoyed it warmed up with a squeeze of fresh lemon.

I made this last week and will surely make it again. My family loved it.  I tried other's suggestions and added potatoes and carrots along with about a cup of chicken broth which made it a whole meal. I also put cornstarch in the broth at the end because I wanted a thicker gravy. Delicious!

Bought what I thought was 4 halves of chicken breast but package contained 2 super large ones.  Used the recipe as is w/ fresh rosemary instead of dry, left out hot sauce since a drop of our special brand is a killer heat.  Chicken was ok, needed another 10 min., since was a little pink at recommended time and I used convection setting too.  Not super tender, nothing exceptional.  Spices were a nice mix though.  I put some cut up potato around it as some suggested.  Not the best recipe to get a tender, tasty chicken breast...Will try something else.

Such a simple recipe, but out of this world! I marinated the chicken in the OO and herbs for 3 hours. I added 1/2 stick butter and a splash of dry white wine into the marinade mixture right before it was poured over the chicken,  before putting it in  the oven.  Otherwise, followed the recipe. This was wonderful

Followed this as written, except I removed the foil for the last 10 minutes and increased the oven temp. to 450 degrees to crisp the skin. It was delicious, and I will definitely be making it again.

It was very flavorful.  In the end, though, I wanted more basting sauce than the recipe gave me, so I threw in a little butter to stretch it.  Gave the dish a very rich flavor.  I will probably make again as it is pretty easy.

This is a MUST MAKE DISH!  Very tasty and favorable. My family LOVED it.  Couple of suggestions...add a little season salt and red pepper for that added flair.  Allow chicken to marinate in base for 1 hour.  Either way your family and guest will love it.   Enjoy!

Loved it , made with thighs and left out the pepper sauce because that is what my elderly mom likes, she can't do spicy.  The thighs were moist and very tasty.  Will make it again, very easy too.  Yum

Very tender and easy to make!  Next time I would reduce the dry herbs a bit as is a little strong in taste and covers the meat too thickly.

Sept 2016
Update:  We tried it again with skin-on chicken breast.  A major difference! I had no hot sauce and used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. The chicken was juicy and tender and the skin tasted delicious with the herb baste.  Will definitely keep this as a "go to" chicken recipe!


Earlier review:  We liked the taste of the herbs, but since I made it with skinless chicken, we missed the richer flavor of the juices. Will use chicken breasts with skin next time.

I prepared the chicken by the original recipe, and for a basic baked chicken, it was delicious.  Prep work was quick and easy.  I used chicken thighs as I didn't have any chicken breasts.  It worked just fine.  It was full of flavor, and everyone in my family loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

Very simple recipe. I followed the directions exactly. My family likes a little heat so next time I'll add red pepper flakes to the recipe.

I  LOOOOVE   baked chicken with all those herbs. It smelled and tasted like I was at someone else's house!
I cook very different than most people. I sprinkled on all those herbs in olive oil in the cast iron pan, just a shake of each one or so, then I slow cooked on low heat until the chicken was half done turning pieces over a few times.  Then only on one side I sprinkled everything on the chicken again and added Hungarian Paprika  and  Herb de Provence. Then I put the pieces directly on a rack with a drip pan underneath in the toaster oven and cooked on low heat for an hour. Actually I had so many pieces in there it took an hour and a half.  When you get the feel of it you can sprinkle on the right amount of herbs and seasonings. I'm just one guy and don't need tons of everything. Sprinkle less of the strongest seasonings and herbs and the flavors from each will marriage together and make a unique flavor.
''Update''  I do not cook the chicken like that anymore.  I have eliminated the oregano. Forgot to mention in my original comment. Now here's the recipe I use on a constant basis:
Rosemary Leaves
Parsley 
Thyme
Basil 
Marjoram
Cayenne Pepper
Garlic Powder
Pepper
Hungarian Paprika
Drumsticks Thighs etc 
   
Sprinkle only one side of pieces Rosemary Leaves on rather thick and the rest medium sprinkle except Thyme  and Basil, (One or two pinches around)    And I do a light dusting of the Marjoram ...
 Put Chicken on middle rack of your table top oven with drip pan underneath.

This was an excellent way to make chicken.  I love love love it!  I made it with a skinless/boneless chicken breast.
I will definitely make this again :)
Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really good dish and my husband raved about it.  I left out the hot pepper sauce and it was still great.  The only thing I'd do different is maybe double the sauce since there wasn't a lot to baste with.  I will definitely make this again.

I  like to use recipes the first time out just as written, substitutes at the minimum.  This one WINS.  I increased the cooking time to 60 mins. due to my 70 yr old Tappan oven ' s quirks. The chicken was moist and delicious and the skin crispy, the herbs in a nice flavor balance! I served over white rice. Next time I might arrange potatoes and carrots in the baking dish and use some Chili powder and cayenne along with the pepper & hot sauce.

Absolutely will make again.  I used frozen chicken breasts and the longer cooking time was spot on.  I was lucky enough to have fresh herbs on hand and used those.  Excellent recipe!

This chicken was so great, I didn't use parsely instead I put two tomato slices on each chicken and topped it with some cilantro and put it in the oven. In the mixture I squeezed lime juice into it and put.

Though the chicken was tender, the taste was not there, and the skin did not get crispy or browned.

Quite good. Much like other combos I use often.  Be sure to adjust cooking times for size of meat and lower time for sure with skinless boneless type.
Hints from an old gal to newbie cooks... get a good meat thermometer with the digital part outside the oven..it rings when reached desired temp. Do not put probe near the bone.  Also allow for carry over temp rise while resting out of oven. I usually go to reading of 159 and it works at 165 as recommended by some, you will likely overcook and dry.  Another tool I love is a meat injector that I use for many things to inject marinade or melted butter or flavored oils into meat for flavor[as calorie-wise as you like, even fruit juice is good]  Hope this is helpful to some of you from a 72 yo Granny!!

This is the perfect bast, so easy and great results., I was missing 3 ingredients the pepper sauce, marjoram and the thyme and it still came out wonderful. I will use these ingredients as an injection to the meat next time. This is a keeper. Thanks for the tip!

Fantastic recipe! Very juicy. Next time, I will bake at 450 for less than 45 minutes, probably would be done at 35 minutes with the bone in breasts. I drizzled with olive oil and then sprinkled salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic powder. This was pretty tasty and can made with many different varieties of herbs!

Delicious and aromatic! This was a delectable dish that everyone in my family enjoyed - even my picky 6 year old! I took the suggestion of another reviewer, and added a bit of chicken broth to help in the basting. I doubled the mix for more chicken pieces, and served with buttery angel hair pasta. It will be a requested staple in our home from now on -- thank you!

Delicious! My husband wanted a lighter dinner tonight & this hit the spot. Perfectly moist & juicy - and throwing it together couldn't have been easier. Thanks!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I generally don't like chicken that is baked in a basting sauce, so I modified the instructions. I used boneless skinless chicken breast tenderloins, because that's what I had. To avoid them becoming dry, I spread the spice mixture on, wrapped them in aluminum foil, then baked them at 350F for 45 min. It was moist and kept the flavor in. Done that way, there was not much dipping sauce, but enough for one meal. I served over a bed of Far East brand chicken-flavored cous cous.

Simple and kept chicken moist. I just used 2 tsp Italian seasoning since I didn't have all the ones individually. Turned out well but I'm sure the flavor is even better with the appropriate individual seasoning. Will be using this again.

A great basic chicken recipe. With just 2 of us in the house, I like to bake 4 or 5 chicken breasts, have some for dinner and then use the leftovers for meals the next day (soup, quesadillas, etc). Thanks for a great standby!

Everyone like this.  It was really easy to make too.  I did put the bone-in chicken breast in a zip lock baggie with the seasonings and marinated it a couple hours before I baked it.  I didn't baste the chicken very well either (no baster here) & it still turned out moist and flavorful.

This was absolutely delicious. The chicken was moist and flavourful. Definitely a keeper. Next time I will do it for a party. I used boneless breasts with the skin on, as that was all I had, and they worked out perfectly.

Easy enough, but not impressed. I had boneless, skinless breasts to use, but that shouldn't have made much difference. Also, I cooked at 350 for half an hour because of the different type of chicken. I had to uncover it the last 5 to 10 min because the chicken was so pale. The meat was on the tougher, dry side. If I did ever do something like this again, I wouldn't cover it (my Salsa Chicken I don't & it is moist & juicy). Also, I'd probably just use Italian seasoning with a couple other things - less work.

Maybe I did it wrong, but it seemed really dry.  It was ooooooookay, not the best in my opinion. I'm dieting, so it is a good dieters chicken. If you're interested in something awesome, and not on a diet, I wouldn't have this as my main.

Very flavorful. I used boneless, skinless breasts and marinated for a few hours. When done marinating, it looked like all the sauce had been absorbed by the chicken. But when I checked after 15 minutes or so, there was plenty. Took about 30 minutes overall.

This is my new favorite chicken recipe. The whole house smelled good enough to eat, and the chicken is beautiful with te herbs covering it. Served over rice with steamed veggies, plates were spotless and leftovers vanished in lunches.

It is really to die for when you use fresh herbs!

Excellent, the hot sauce gives it a great subtle kick underneath all of the herbs.  I doubled the sauce and used it on a whole bird, rubbing it under the skin and in the cavity.  Added some lemon zest and used fresh cracked pepper to the sauce.  The summer, I am going to try this with my grill.

This came out very oily and greasy.  I used bone-in breasts and even removed the skin but they were still too oily for us.  I would try either a dry rub with the herbs and then grilling, or less oil and maybe some cream of mushroom soup.

This was really, really tasty...my husband grabbed a slice of pizza on his way home from work and said he wasn't too hungry...next thing I know, he practically licked the plate clean!  My son helped pour all the spices, great meal to "cook" with kids-did add butter (melted over top right before baking-and removed foil halfway through cooking to brown) Thanks for the great recipe!

Very much enjoyed this chicken...but I added more herbs and olive oil and rubbed it onto the chicken instead of just pouring it on top. I also removed the skin. Smelled wonderful as well.

I loved it!  I overcooked the chicken a bit so mine was a bit dry, however that was my own fault, not the recipe's.  I will definitely make this again only next time be more cautious about the cooking time.

This was great, and the chicken was so tender and juicy.  the only thing i would suggest would to maybe grind up the herb sauce before putting it on the chicken... if your ingredients are already ground.  That way it doesn't have the texture of eating grass

This was delicious! I followed another reviewer's suggestion of adding fresh mushrooms. They were awesome with the juices from the pan! I also left mine uncovered the entire time in the oven. My husband said it was the best chicken and mushrooms he's ever had!

I made this as part of a Christmas dinner and it was EXCELLENT! I followed a previous reviewer's suggestions and added butter to the basting sauce, and I used boneless and skinless. Even my 10-year old nephew liked it, and his favorite foods are noodles, noodles, and noodles.

I followed reviewers' advice, and cooked the chicken (skinless, boneless) for 20 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered- turned out very moist. The flavor was pretty good- my only real complaint is that the chicken gets an "F" for presentation... next time I will brown the chicken in a pan prior to baking. However, I must admit, my husband DID have a point when he said, "If it tastes good- who cares what it looks like?"

Very good ... I used a roasting pan and poured a can of chicken broth in the bottom to use for basting. The second time I made it, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked at 375 for 20 minuted covered and 30 minutes uncovered, per someone else'e review. It was a lot spicier that way, but still really good and juicy.

Really liked this!  I didn't have marjoram - just omited it.  Also did not have fresh parsley, used dried.  I used bone-in breasts and uncovered for last 10-15 minutes so the skin would brown and crisp up a bit.  The sauce was great and next time I make, I will also make garlic mashed potatoes as a side dish for the sauce!!!

This is a wonderful recipe with great flavor!  I made it with boneless breasts and followed the suggestion to reduce heat and cover.  It didn't really brown up at all but what it lacked in color was more than compensated by flavor.  I also used chicken broth in place of some of the oil (I ran out).  I will definitedly be making this again.

Really yummy.  My chicken breasts were huge so it took a little over an hour to cook, plenty of time to bake some potatos in the oven with it.  I also added a chopped purple onion-some sprinkled on top and some in the basting sauce which browned nicely.

I prepared this recipe in the oven with boneless, skinless breasts per Ms. Sullivan's review -- moist, tasty, and definitely a keeper. As I was putting the spices together, I realized that "Poultry Seasoning" has the same seasonings, with the addition of Allspice, so I used that instead. I would like to try this recipe with the sauce further enhanced by white wine. Thanks!

I used this baked chicken in another recipe also off of this site, "Easy Chicken Tetrazzini," and it was fabulous. I am sure that by themselves these chicken breasts would also be wonderful!!! Two thumbs way up!

A very good base recipe that become excellent with a few modifications:

* I used 2 legs/thighs and 2 breasts (with bones, skin on).  
* I reduced the olive oil to 1 T (with the chicken skin, I found 3 too fatty).
* I added 2 cups of chicken broth.
* I added vegetables (1/2 onion, a couple handfulls of new potatoes).
* Herbs: fresh basil, 3 cloves garlic, fresh ground black pepper, and a sprinkle of cajun seasoning.

It's a simple recipe to make either way... but with the changes, the aroma and taste were fantastic.

I used skinless, boneless breasts and they came out very moist with pretty good flavor.  I think the herbs are a little overpowering though.  But overall, not a bad dish.  Will probably make again.

GREAT DISH!!!  I made this last night and it was a big hit.  I didn't have rosemary so I substituted basil.  I also made a double dose of the marinade and cut us potatoes as another reviewer suggested and it was better than I imagined.  Thank you Christine.  This one will be added to my repretoire.

WOW! This is a wonderful recipe. Very easy to make (our seven yr old helped us make this) and tastes wonderful! The chicken was the most tender and moist we have had. The herbal basting sauce gives a nice flavor without being overpowering. Delicious! Thanks for the keeper!

I marinated the chicken for 6 hours and cooked it uncovered since we like the skin crispy. We like thyme and sage so we did enjoy this dish.  I made this a second time and it didn't turn out well.  The second time the chicken breasts were quite large and I didn't account for that and the chicken was quite raw when I served it - had to go back in the oven.  I should have known better and cooked it for an hour.

Delicious! I melted 1/2 stick of butter in the pan in the oven until melted before placing the chicken in the pan.  From the recipe and other reviews, I was worried the chicken would be dry.  But spooning the butter over the chicken during the cooking assured that it was very moist and tasty.

This is absolutely wonderful and smells great while cooking.  I followed the recipe exactly and used boneless breasts and it was enjoyed by all.  I served with pasta, but will try potatoes next time.
