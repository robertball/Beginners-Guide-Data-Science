Made this for a family get together and it was really good. I went a little heavy on the avocado so it was reminiscent of guacamole but the family still really liked it as a healthier option than traditional coleslaw. The recipe does seem light on the amount of olive oil it calls for.

This was a delicious alternative for a slaw. The nuts really added a little extra. The prep time was longer then I am used to for a side dish but with some make ahead of time planning this is worth it. Also several of the ingredients are ones I won't normally have on hand. The "sauce" never got to a sauce point for me. My avocado seemed average sized but the oil ratio was way off to make a "sauce". I ended up basically doubling the oil measurement and pulling out an electric hand mixer to try to get it to sauce consistency. Still was rather thick but was able to kind of fold it in with the cabbage. I found the ripest avocado the store had. Hard to get genuinely ripe from the store produce here. If I had planned this meal ahead of time I would have waited a few days for the avocado to soften up more. I'm sure that would have solved the consistency issue. So PLAN ahead for your ingredients list/and prep time and this is well worth the effort. Don't attempt this with a last minute dash for produce. (Oh and don't make for date night MAJOR garlic breathe.) But DO make it.

Very good salad. I was looking for a salad to use my avocado & shredded cabbage & found this recipe. We had everything except the yogurt so I replaced yogurt with cottage cheese. Great flavor in this salad.

i liked the idea of it, but was not thrilled with the flavor. Of course, I used a red onion which may have been too much for it.
