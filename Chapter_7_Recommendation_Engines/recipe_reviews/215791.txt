This recipe is awesome. I marinate it in a large ziplock or tupperware leaving out the avacado. Then we take it with us camping. I add the avacado just before serving and add some cilantro. Bring to the picnic table with a ladle, some vodka, a bottle of tabasco, some crackers and a deck of pinochle cards. You can also add a ladle of the of the sauce to an icy beer. Yum! I am very popular on camping trips. Thank you for the great recipe. I have never added jicama, but will do so from here on out.

We have a favorite shrimp cocktail in Puerto Penasco, Mexico -- and now with this recipe we can make it at home! Adding Cilantro is a good idea.
