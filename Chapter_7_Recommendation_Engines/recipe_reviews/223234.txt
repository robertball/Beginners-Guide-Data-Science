I am the original submitter of this recipe, so here are some tips to follow, since All Recipes changes the recipe a bit when they approve it.  

1.) You have to measure the ingredients by weight.  They've put the weights in the footnotes.  If you measure out, say, three egg whites instead of 50g of egg whites, you might be off enough to mess up the cookie, and it won't puff up correctly (or at all).

2.) YES YOU DO HAVE TO SIFT THE INGREDIENTS!  I'm so lazy.  I've tried to do it without sifting.  It never works out, trust me.  Sift that powdered sugar and almond powder together.  You won't regret it.

2.) The "silicone baking mat" in step one was originally a Silpat.  I have tried making these on every surface known to man, including my cookie favorite, parchment paper.  You need the Silpat or you won't be able to get the cookies off the sheet.

3.) People debate on whether it's necessary to let them set for an hour before baking.  We tried setting them from 1 to 240 minutes.  One hour is perfect.

4.) It is possible to mix it too much, and the cookie won't puff up when baked.  Use as few strokes as possible when folding the almond into the egg whites.

5.) I highly recommend finding already-ground almonds, rather than grinding them yourself.  It was our experience that grinding our own almonds resulted in an inferior cookie.  They have to be ground to a very fine powder, and it's nearly impossible to do with regular kitchen equipment.

Good luck!

This is a perfect recipe for Macarons; I have made them several times and each time i get perfect round mounds with no cracks and cute little "feet". I have, however, made a slight adjustment on the sugar level and have also been able to add flavorings to make different varieties. 

Weighing the ingredients is key. Ive found that you MUST weigh the almond flour & powdered sugar. Its not, however, that crucial to weigh the egg whites (i never have. my thought process was, umm if i'm short 3-4 grams am i reaaally gonna try and get 3 grams from another egg? Meh!) 3 egg whites will do the trick :)

It is also not crucial to add a total of 50 grams of regular sugar to the eggs while youre beating them. This is where I have tested many different weights, and for me and my friends/family, 35 GRAMS is PLENTY sweet enough. Seriously! it already has 200 g powdered sugar! By decreasing the amount of sugar to 35 g only, the almond flavor shines a LOT brighter. Trust me.

To make chocolate macaroons: sift in one tablespoon of cocoa powder into the almond flour & p. sugar. Easy peasy. Stir in a small amount of Brown Gel food coloring into the egg whites.

To make coffee macaroons (my fav!): sift one teaspoon of instant espresso powder (you know, the one with the green cap!) into the almond flour & p. sugar. Brown food coloring into the egg whites.

Thank you for this recipe! Have never tried a macaron but have recently been obsessed with trying them. Of course, there's nowhere to buy them within a hundred miles and I hate risking buying food online. So I tried this out. For my first try, I think I did really good, considering how hard people always say it is to get them right. Tasted good, had little feet, just didn't puff up all the way (too much liquid in mine, I think-- because i never fully follow directions). The only problem was a technical one. I didn't have a non-stick base (had JUST run out of parchment paper) so 90% of them stuck and lost their bottoms too much to ignore. It wasn't a bad thing though, because my spouse ate them all anyway. He actually didn't like the ones I filled, just the plain ones. ^-^'  Will definitely do this again.

The ingredients overall worked, but baking them was a complete flop the first time around.  They came out perfectly the second time.  What I did differently the second time.  
Piping:  I used a real pastry bag.  I tried to shortcut it the first time and it was a sloppy mess.  I also rubber-banded of the end of the bag so the batter wouldn't leak out and cut it right before piping.  I made a template on a piece of parchment paper with circles as a guide for piping so they are more uniform in size. Template was taped to the table and I placed other sheets of parchment on top of template to pipe.  On round one, I noticed the macarons I piped toward the end of the sheet were more loose, so on round two I took a break and iced my hand so that the heat from my hand wasn't loosening up the batter.  
Baking:  preheat oven to 375.  Before putting sheet in, reduce heat to 325.  Bake 5 min.  Rotate tray.  bake 5 min.  Take sheet out and reheat oven to 375 for next sheet.  I found I could not bake more than one sheet at a time.  
Baking sheets:  They did not get "feet" on any sheet other than an old, thin baking sheet.  My thermal sheets and baking stones did not work. 
After filling: let macarons sit for 24 before serving.  Something happens to them to soften the cookie ever so slightly that makes them just like the European macarons my friend was craving.  Serve within 48 hours or freeze.

These came out great!  This was my first attempt at macarons and I was afraid because I always hear how hard they are to make.  I can't believe I was able to do it on my first try!  I weighed the ingredients instead of measuring as the author of this recipe suggested: 100 grams egg whites 50 grams white sugar 200 grams confectioners' sugar 110 grams ground almonds.  I also did not have a silicone baking sheet so I lightly greased parchment paper and it worked great. I left them in the oven on 170 degrees for a long time (I think about an hour )because they were too moist in the middle still after the baking time.  They turned out great!

I went to french pastry school and have a recipe we used in school for macarons all the time but when I started trying to make them at home it was a total disaster so I've been looking for a good recipe for quite some time that works for home baking. I just made these and after trying sooo many different recipes and methods, finally I found one that worked!

Some notes that helped me: 
I found that to get a really good foot but still have them not crack, to leave them out for 20 minutes on my pan after piping with my fan on them. Tried leaving them out for an hour with no fan before and I had a smaller foot and they cracked. 

Hit your pan hard on the counter after piping them so any bubbles get out, they're smooth on top and they don't crack. 

I did medium peaks (not soft and not stiff) which seemed to work better because too soft of peaks makes it really hard not to overmix your batter when combining. Too stiff makes it really hard to not look chunky. 

In school we were taught to age our egg whites and almond flour. I didn't and it worked fine. I would say that it is really important that the almond flour is dried out though. Humidity will effect the texture.

You absolutely have to sift the almond flour and confectionary sugar. I hate doing this, but it's necessary. Trust me I've tried to skip this step so many times and it never works. Also, be careful that your almond flour is very finely ground. Sometimes even the stuff you buy can get crumbly.

Hope this helps!

This is my third macaron recipe, and FINALLY, I got lift and feet and no cracks, but ONLY after I bought a scale and weighed everything. Volume measurements didn't work for me at all.

I've made this twice and both times the macarons haven't baked. they come out of the oven soft and with an air pocket inside the shell. likely I've somehow over-mixed them but a the same time I'm not sure how to mix them any less without ending up with chunks of almond flour. Also, they don't seem to puff like other macarons- these ones are flatter.

I have made these now about half a dozen times and they come out a little better each time I try it.  I have a few suggestions to make them fool proof.  Start with room temperature eggs, add 1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar  when whipping the eggs, (it stabilizes the mixture). I used superfine sugar or Castor sugar to make the meringue smooth, and sifted the almond meal and powdered sugar through a sieve to get out the pieces of almond that were larger.  (A hand sifter cannot sift the meal properly.) When making slightly larger Macarons, add extra minutes to the time. I have even turned off the oven and cracked the door and left the cookies in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes to assure they come off the pan easily. I used a Silpat for some and parchment for others.  Both are good! Once you see the results?  you'll be hooked! :)

I have not yet tried this recipe, but intend to do so within the next week.  I would like to know how the vibrant colors are achieved in the pictured macarons.  What type of food coloring was used and at what point in the mixing process was it added?  Thanks!

I'm sure this is completely my fault which is why I am not giving it a low rating. Anyhow,

The macarons crack within 4 - 5 minutes of baking! I've tried many many variations of 'resting.' I achieve pretty dry - hard shells, but they crack in the oven anyway. The feets are all perfect though...  Did I just simply over mix? How can you tell you've overmixed *before* baking?

For the 'skin', I've done the 30 mins, the hour, the hour 1/2... I even tried popping them right into the oven after piping at 200F for 15 minutes, achieving a really nice hard shell (Advice taken from "Les Petits. Macarons"). I've tried leaving it in the oven on "warm" for 10 minutes and also got a nice shell (advice taken from a blogger I found on google.
 But every time I start to actually bake it, every thing goes wrong. 

Please help...!

I have made macarons dozens and dozens of times- this one had the best results. They dried within 20 minutes, and I baked them for 20 minutes. I absolutely loved them- made chocolate macarons using 4.5 tbsp of dark cocoa, and filled them with a dark chocolate raspberry ganache. EXCELLENT! go to http://hotchocolatehits.blogspot.com/ to see my adjustments and photos. I may even make a video soon!

A really great base recipe for macarons.  Definitely use the weight measures!  A few tips not mentioned in the recipe:  make sure your egg whites are at room temp before starting.  They won't whip properly when cold.  SLOWLY  pour the sugar into the foamy whites with the mixer running; don't just dump it all in at once.  If you want to color your macarons, add the coloring just before the egg whites reach soft peaks.  Same if you want to flavor the cookie (I add 1/2 tsp almond extract to really make the almond flavor pop).  Watch the baking process carefully.  If it's a humid day, you may need to bake them a minute or two longer. Finally, leave the cookies on the baking sheet for a few minutes before attempting to remove to a wire rack.  It (and a thin bladed spatula) will make the process much easier.

I tried this recipe last week and without using a scale and although they didn't taste bad, they looked horrible!  However, this week I was extremely meticulous about following every single direction and even some other tips from other people and they came out great!  You do need to give in and buy a scale!  In the long run you will have pretty macarons and you will save money from going to a baker just so you can enjoy some!  The baking of a macaron is going to be different from everyone.  I did half the batch on a silipat and half on parchment paper.  The parchment paper batch came off easier and looked much nicer.  The silipat batch had a problem sticking and a few cracked (those were probably done from me).  Anyway, do what works best for you!

Ok...to make the perfect macaron- 1) buy a scale. 2) find confectioners sugar that does not have cornstarch in it (or make your own). 3) find a template to trace circles on parchment paper (I find using the plastic casing from the outside of a tealight to work perfectly), filling in the stencil with the pastry bag straight up and pull away as soon as batter reaches the edge of the circle, and 4) do let them rest before baking! (Otherwise you might get a cracked top.) oh yeah- the cookies are done when they don't stick to the parchment paper, but peel right off. These tips always help them work out! I fill mine with an Italian buttercream flavored with a vanilla bean. I also scrape the seeds from part of a vanilla bean into the batter-you can see the seeds in the finished cookie (see my picture). Yum!

This is a great recipe for a very finicky cookie. If you use the weight measurements you'll have much more success. Also, you must sift- otherwise your cookies will come out a bit lumpy. The finer your almond meal the better, the store bought stuff I got wasn't fine enough, had to blitz it in a food processor to help it a bit.

The cooking time listed is too short, at 285 F it's more like 20 minutes, otherwise the inside is mush and they'll stick to the sheet.

To color them, you want gel colors, you need to use too much liquid to get the color you want- they're relatively inexpensive, I got 8 colors for under $10.

The shells are usually not flavored, but you can substitute some of the almonds or powdered sugar for other powdered ingredients, but be sure to keep the weight of the ingredients the same overall. To make chocolate ones I used 40g of cocoa, and subtracted 20g each of the sugar and almonds. You can do similar with powdered fruit ingredients as well.

I have tried many versions of macarons, only with this single recipe I found successful and pleasing. Instead of just plain vanilla flavour, I dared to try and substitute 10 grams cocoa powder and 100 grams almond powder instead of 110 grams almond powder which ended with wonderful results. Also baking one tray at a time helped a lot; not a single one cracked in between baking times. I have planned to make this recipe much more times in the future.

This recipe is perfect if you pay attention to what Ellie says in her comments. 
In the video the glossed over what I think is the most important part of successful macarons and that is the texture of the batter. If you don't get that right you will not have success. The batter needs to be loose and not hold a peak. It should flow off the spatula but not be liquid. When you pick up the spatula the batter should fall off and flatten out by the time you count to 10.  You will work it a bit more adding it to your pasty bag and piping it out. If when you pipe the cookies you get peaks, you did not mix enough. Hope this is bellyful info.

I tried this recipe and followed it with minor changes.  I used a cookie sheet with parchment paper instead of the silicone pan (When I compared this recipe with others, they all used the cookie sheet with parchment so I went ahead and used that.)  Also, I made sure to bang the cookie sheets hard on the counter-top several times to make sure all of the air bubbles came to the surface.  This prevents the cracks that some of the reviewers talked about.  When the air bubbles come to the top, I took a tooth pin and pierced the air bubble.    I used the gram measurements instead of the ones allrecipes printed.  The first batch I made were overcooked.  10 minutes didn't work for my oven but 7.5 was perfect.  Note, buy a oven thermometer to make sure your oven is the exact temperature.  My second batch was perfection!  Great recipe.

I've tried a couple of macaron recipes and this has been the only one that has worked!  They turned out looking great.  Biting into the shells, they seem a bit soft though, not sure if anyone else has experienced this.  But otherwise a great recipe.  Thanks!

My first try turned out great with no cracks and they puffed!  I will find a cookie cutter next time so they are all the same size.  A couple of notes:  I used Almond Meal (Bob's Red Mill) and sifted it with the sugar but still had several tiny bits.  Next time will blend it through the food processor first. I weighed all ingredients a folded approx 35 strokes.   

Added 1 tsp vanilla to egg whites once firm, and dusted macaroons with cinnamon & sugar just before going into the oven.   Filled with a cinnamon butter cream.  Yum!!

Good recipe, but I recommend following the quantities under "Cook's Notes" if you want consistent results every time.  Invest in a good electronic scale if you plan to bake a lot.  Using "cups" for dry ingredients is generally not a good idea for highly technical recipes such as this.

Also it took me 16-18 minutes to properly cook a batch using the recommended temperatures, so it will vary depending on your oven.  If this is your first time making it like I did, they're cooked when they peel off the silpat effortlessly. if they crumble, they're nowhere near cooked.

I am so happy with this recipe, it was my first time ever making these & I was exstatic to see when I opened the oven they were puffed up the way they should be. I used a kitchen scale. The only thing that went wrong was that I used a sandwich bag instead of a piping bag & it was really making a mess, so I started scooping it with a spoon, this made them very mis shaped but still tasty, I will be using a piping bag next time I make these. I added a little lavender to the almond mixture & blended it after sifting, also put some purple gel food coloring in when I folded it in. These came out so great, I was really expecting worse than just mis shaped cookies, I am so excited they will be perfect next time. Thank you for the excellent recipe!

Absolutely fabulous!  These are my FAVORITE cookies and although I bake (all. the.  time.) I have never attempted a macaron until tonight.  These were better than the $2 per cookie ones I last had in NYC!  I am so, so , SO thrilled to have tried this!  I let them rest for one hour as suggested.  I baked one sheet on silpat and one on parchment which I also sprayed with bakers joy (to be on the safe side, lol) and the silpat actually took significantly longer - baked more like 15 minutes.  The parchment batch came out just fine, no sticking for me!  Rose perfectly, perfect texture, delicious!  I filled some with an almond buttercream and some with raspberry preserves and some with a layer of both - YUM!  Oh, I also added about a half teaspoon of almond bakery emulsion (not sure how extract would impact the meringue) after the whites were whipped, but before adding the almond/sugar mixture.  I also ground my own almonds - I keep a separate coffee grinder for nuts, does a great job.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Weighed all the ingredients, sifted the drys together, used a COOKIE SCOOP instead of piping (sorry to the purists!), used parchment paper, let rest 20 minutes before baking at 350F (oops)and they still turned out amazing. I will reduce sugar next time.

I made this recipe for Xmas pressies, wrapped up in tissue paper and sat in handmade boxes.
I followed the recipe to the t (except I just used 3 egg whites - only thing I didn't weigh)
I read loads of comments and have summarized these tips that worked for me, if anyone nervous is about tackling these beauties:
1. Weigh your ingredients - I never used cups and spooons, only ever a scale.
2. Sift Icing sugar and almonds together (several times)
3. Work quickly, have everything ready to go.
4. Use ingredients fresh from their packaging (this is not a must but if you're worried about humidity this could help - I however made these in the height of Summer) 
5. Fan Dry - I trained my fan onto the prepared macarons to "set up and skin" 
6. Rotate pans in the oven - We have a fan oven and it does NOT brown evenly.
I made two flavours: green was white chocolate and lime ganache center and Pink was Dark chocolate Raspberry ganache filling.
SO YUMMY! Will never need another macaron recipe.

This was a solid recipe. I was happy with the result, but happier with a few adjustments I made to account for my oven, and my taste preferences. I found 30 grams of fine sugar was sufficient to mix with the egg whites. I used 210 grams of the icing sugar and 125 grams of the ground almonds. I add a thin dab of colour to the egg whites to give the little roonies a bit of colour. I also add a tiny amount of very intensive almond extract. I found I had to add more after sifting the almonds because there were so many little pieces left in the sieve. I also sift the icing sugar and almonds separately and weight them after sifting, then sifting again all together.... I know its  pain, but so are these tasty cookies! I let them rest on the pan for 35-40 minutes and this worked for me (my house is warm though). I needed to bake at a higher temp for longer- 315 F for 12-13 minutes. I was successful with quality parchment paper. Fantastic little bite of delicious delicacy! Thanks for posting it Elle!

I have never made FM's before. I had time, took my time to read the reviews n tricks. If I'm gonna take the time to make these, that seem really technical, I don't want to screw em up! So, I went and bought my first digital scale. Measure, measure, measure!! I ran the almond flour through the FP and Still had a heck of a time sifting it! I was making these for the family so I just dumped the rest of the flour (2 tbls) that still had tiny pebbles in the bowl. Mey;) Gives texture and didn't seem to make a difference to me. I gave them some color, let them sit by an open window on a hot summer day and popped them in the oven. There is a vast difference of temps, I setitled on 375 then down to 325 once the pan went in, turned after 5 minutes. 
My cookies didn't rise as much as I thought and the lost a bit of color, the higher temp might be the reason. I will correct this next time. I GOT FEET!!  No cracks, I used both silpat & parchment paper with no spray, nothing stuck. I made a mocha filling with Hershey/hazelnut coco spread & 1 tbls. Instant coffee crystals along with a little coffee creamer to thin it out. 
The family thought they were very good! Well, now I know I Can make them;) Thank you very much Elle. Keeper!!

This recipe is great! I've always wanted to attempt the famous Macaron but was admittedly terrified! But I am proud of my first attempt, and I know what I did wrong so I can fix it the second time round. What went wrong for me? Piping uniform circles, not letting them set long enough, under baking (10 minutes wasn't long enough for mine) Definitely measure your ingredients on a scale, sift, sift, sift! Let them set, and watch the baking process!

Don't use the measurements from the video! They are wrong. It says 50g egg white, 50g sugar, 100g almonds, 200g powered sugar. I couldn't see the footnotes on my phone and didn't know they were wrong until I started mixing it and it was way way too thick. Trying it again with the correct measurements from the footnotes!

Edited, made using the measurements from the footnote and they were great! Had to make 3 batches because we couldn't wait long enough to eat them with filling. The first tray my kids were eating straight off the pan as they cooled. We are waiting on the filled one to eat tomorrow as I have read they are better if they refrigerate 24 hours.

It worked for me!!! I weighed my ingredients,added cream of tartar to my egg whites while betting them and after piping the batter onto the cookie sheets lined with parchment paper I gave the cookie sheet a good hits against the table (this is supposed to get the bubbles out and prevent cracking. I filled mine with Nutella yum yum :) I have never actually tasted a macaron before I took on the challenge of making them. And after creating the perfect macaroon I know what all the fuss is about. THEY ARE AMAZING!!!

I have baked macarons from a macaron cookbook, as well as Joy of Cooking, and an online site. I did not care for this version at all. I did sift! but I didn't weigh because I cook in a home kitchen, not a professional bakery. The other recipes turned out pretty well with simple measuring, so this simple recipe looked like it would as well. They were tasteless, and while I got feet on a quarter of the batch, the rest had every other problem covered in the macaron cookbook -- all on one sheet :) They also came out raw in the middle, even with an extra minute of baking; my other recipes used a similar temp but longer baking time, so something isn't quite right here.

This was my first attempt at macarons and it was much easier than I thought it would be. I used a scale as suggested by the submitter and followed the recipe to a T. The macarons did not crack or stick.  I was very pleased. To make all the macarons the same size I make a template out of a big sheet of paper and placed it under the parchment paper. The only problem I have with this recipe was the bake time was not long enough.  The centers were still a bit moist. I used an oven thermometer so I know the temp was at 285. Will bake for maybe 15 min next time. Used chocolate ganache for filling.

Followed directions exactly, even using volume measurement because I don't have a scale, and they turned out great.  Only one change- I baked them for about 8 minutes longer because the first pan was still wet in the center.  Will make again!

The recipe is perfect if you follow the additional instructions the baker submitted below. I gave it four stars only because she also added to use food coloring gel...it is more common practice of French bakeries to use natural foods to color their pastries.

This was my first time making french macaroons, and they turned out perfect. I used berry sugar as most macaron recipes call for very fine sugar. I added purple gel and they came out a lovely colour. Very time consuming but turned out great. I will definitely be making these again.

They weren't done at 10 minutes. After putting them back in, 2 min at a time, 3 times, the tops were done but bottoms mushy. I wish I'd seen the Pop Sugar website which cooks them on the bottom two racks (switching half way) for 15 to 18 minutes which is more accurate.

This worked fine, my previous attempts at other recipes failed. I am going to try again with slightly more almond, and slightly less powdered sugar though.

I have made this recipe in the past with real eggs, and it turned out great.  However, this time I decided to try a short cut, and use egg whites from a carton. The cookies were a complete flop.  This is the only thing I did differently, so I'm thinking it had to be the egg whites.

overall this recipe was perfect! this was my first time baking macarons. The only thing is that the baking is much longer than 10 minutes. my first batch was pretty much a loss. second time around i put the over at 325 instead of 285 and baked them for 12 minutes.

I made them over the weekend. Well, the taste and texture was great but I had one problem. My Macarons didn't have feet, those coin looking flat bottoms, instead mine turned out to be concave mushroom caps. But, the taste was just like store bought. For cream I made orange flavored cream cheese filling and every one in my family pitched in some money (to buy more ingredients) to make more.  Thank you for the recipe. It was wonderful.... Oh, next time, I think I will lessen the amount of sugar. It was really sweet!

Thank you so much for this recipe! It's awesome! It is a basic recipe that allowed me to try different variations each time I make it. I've made:
1) coconut macarons: vanilla cookies with coconut frosting
2) chocolate orange macarons: chocolate cookies (used 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder in place of the powdered sugar) with orange cream
3) berry cheesecake: vanilla cookies (teaspoon of vanilla extract and 3 drops of red food color) with berry cream cheese frosting. Frosting from my left over 
Carrot Cake III. I used about equal amount of frozen berries to frosting; (1 cup: 1 cup). Defrosted berries and pressed through a sieve. This was by far the best batch.

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star for the insight the original poster left in the comments. I was finally able to get PERFECT results after I bought a kitchen scale. I've found that 3 grade A large egg whites weigh closer to 85 grams, which messed this recipe up the first 2 times I made these cookies. They cooked fine with only 20-30 min resting on the tray before baking, good luck. This recipe definitely takes patience!!!

Le sigh.  I thought it was too sweet, and although used a calibrated oven thermometer, it took over twice as long for my macarons to cook.  I'm willing to keep trying though.

Followed this recipe exactly for the first time and they came out perfectly! Some were stuck to the paper but most survived fully intact. I didn't have to wait an hour before a skin formed though, it took about 20 min but I'm told it varies depending on the air in your kitchen anyway. I also beat the eggs to stiff peaks as opposed to soft ones... I think it gave me more leeway when folding the almond flour/icing sugar in?

Made them at altitude (Denver) and the recipe was great.    I let them sit 30 minutes to form skin.  I got beautiful feet.  Make sure to sift almond meal to remove lumps.  Also use a silpat so they don't stick. The ones on a silpat were perfect,  the ones on parchment stuck and were a pain to remove.

I have yet to bake, but so far so good! The batter is thick yet fluffy. The only thing wrong is my batteries grainy, but that is because I ground my own almonds! Oh, and someone asked how do you know when you should be ready after folding but before baking. Here is the answer, use a spatula or a spoon and pick up some batter, the batter should be thick when pulling up some, yet It should drop off of your tool. Hope this helped:)

After reading so many recipes and watching so many tutorials on how to make french macarons I finally decided to give this recipe a try but with notes from other recipes and tips from reviewers. This recipe and directions don't go into depth, which can lead someone who has not done some background homework to mess up. For instance you Must bring your eggs to room temp. When adding food coloring if you choose, it's best to add it towards the end after you've almost folded in the mixture. Gel colors are better than liquid. You must also throw out any coarse pieces of almonds and although I bought almond meal I put it through the blender along with the sugar another time before sifting. After piping the cookies you must tap the bottom of the cookie sheet onto the counter about 6 times for the air bubbles to come up and pop. This way they also flatten out into a more circular shape. Other sites have mentioned to put in one cookie sheet at a time. I did just that. Don't know how it would work otherwise. I didn't have a weighing scale but my cookies still turned out amazing, with feet and all:)

This is a fairly good recipe but I had trouble taking them off the silicone mat without ruining them, (they're now cracked and not as pretty) and they turned out to be flat as pancakes. They didn't cook with the time. I put the oven temperature a bit higher and watched them cook.

I tried the recipe and I measured everything with no luck. It may be that I added vanilla extract. I've made soufles with no trouble when I added vanilla though. It may also be that it mixed it too much. Who knows what it is but I'll keep trying until I get it right. Not as easy as it claims.

First time making macarons and these turned out great! Followed the recipe exactly, only let sit for 45 mins but probably could have put them in at 30. Baked at 285ish for 10 mins exactly. No cracks, did get the feet. :) Used a strawberry buttercream filling. Does anyone know about food coloring? I would have liked to turn them pink but wasn't sure when to add the color and if water based was okay. Ground my own almonds with a food processor and coffee bean grinder, that seemed to work just fine.

My 9 year old daughter REALLY wanted to try to make macarons and I was super hesitant despite the fact that I have always wanted to figure it out. I have read and heard they were very difficult to make and didn't want her to be disappointed. The fact that macarons are delicious combined with being gluten free (which is necessity for me) makes this an ideal treat so I tasked her with finding an EASY recipe that didn't require a food scale. We followed the recipe to the tee (grinding our own almonds in the coffee grinder) and to my surprise they came out perfect! I did have to bake them for an additional 8 minutes or so (easy enough) so they wouldn't stick to the parchment paper. I am excited to try this again and again and experiment with different food colorings as well as flavoring.

Okay peeps. EIGHT tries later, I finally got decent macarons. With every failure I tried again, altering one thing at a time because baking is science. This is what I learned: 1. temperature or age of the whites doesn't matter.  2. 50 g of eggs was not enough. I weighed all ingredients and used 3 egg whites. 3. Soft peaks, people. Soft peaks. A lot of macaron recipes call for stiff peaks, but follow instructions here. 4. The macaronage isn't that complicated. There are hours of macaron tutorials on YouTube. Watch a few. Get a good idea of the ideal batter consistency you're looking for and it'll succeed every time. 5. After I mastered those last four steps I was baffled why my last four batches were disasters. OVEN TEMPERATURE. That's why. My oven was nearly 50 degrees off. I bought an oven thermometer,  and adjusted the oven temperature accordingly. I baked them in a convection oven at 300 degrees for 18 minutes. They're not perfect, but pretty darned close. I'll take it. It's a good thing that even failed macarons are delicious.

This recipe is great, but I must make a few suggestions to help you achieve perfect macarons. Firstly, the baking time is completely off. The recipe states to cook the macaron's for 10 minutes, I typically cook mine for about 19 minutes. This way, you won't need to worry about your macaron's sticking to the bottom of your pan and separating in the middle. After they cook, take them out of your oven and let them cool completely before filling them. Also, you must remember NOT to ever open the oven during the baking process. Your macaron's will deflate and crack if you open the door. Also, please leave about two inches between your macaron's when piping them onto your baking sheet. I've made the mistake of piping them too close to each other, and was greeted with an unpleasant surprise later on (aka-sumo macaron). Lastly, when mixing your fluffy egg whites with the powder sugar/almond flour mixture, slowly mix in half cup spoonfuls.Your macaron's will thank you, because this will help you avoid bumps in the mix, and over mixing. Perfect results.

Really good. I used ground almonds that had a little skin on them, and it turned out fine although the they look speckled. I also added 1/4 tsp of cream of tarter and a pinch of salt to the egg whites before whisking (as another recipe suggested) and they turned out great.

Experimented a bit on sugar levels.. Decreased the confectioners by 40 grams and it still turned out great! Some tips for Canadians, bulk barn almond meal is the lowest quality i tried. Yielded like 30% fine almond flour.. The no name brand yields 50%. Will try redmill brand to see if that is better. Now i have a lot of coarse grind almond flour. Lol.

Well, I tried this today. I let the egg whites beat too long, didn't catch them until they had stiff peaks - oops.  I did weigh the ingredients, but next time I will run the almond meal (Bob's Mill) thru the food processor first and then sift the meal and the powdered sugar together. I didn't really fold it in, I just put the mixer on really slow, so I overbeat it at this point too.  The batter tried really hard and it did rise a bit in the oven, and had a lovely delicate crust on the top, but the rest did not rise with the crust and was a sticky mess that even stuck to my silicone sheet!  It sure tasted good as we scraped it off the silpat, though!  Next time:  Don't overbeat the whites, process the almond meal, gently fold the sifted meal/p. sugar into the whites, and gently put into a bag to squeeze out the discs.  I see where the almond meal has to be a fine powder or it can't rise with the delicate whites.

Like other reviewers, I had to go by volume instead of weight because I don't own a kitchen scale, and mine still turned out light and airy and SUPER sweet. Five drops of red food coloring to the mix yielded the prettiest pink cookies. I can't wait to make these again!

First time ever making.  Needed 14 minutes baking otherwise it was gooey underneath.  Seems a bit grainy to me.  Will try blending sugar and almond meal prior to sifting next time.

I have tried soooo oh soo many recipes for macaroons, for literary years on end now. There is a French restaurant close by that have them but they are quite expensive and the way I go through them adds up ($1ea).
I tried and did my best to make these for my wedding last year,?? I dream of delicate rose petal and chocolate and mocha macaroons to blend in with my romantic candlelit reception, but obviously it didn't happened.I spent time after time doing recipe after recipe and I always ended crying on my kitchen floor. I wish I had this recipe by then its so easy and detailed!THANK YOU!!!!

This recipe is great! I made pistachio macrons so I replaced half of the almond flour with some ground pistachios (very fine) and sifted both flours together. I added green food coloring right before the egg whites reached soft peaks. I even feel like I overwhipped them a bit and they still turned out! I got little "feet" and everything. Very nice recipe I will definitely use this one again!

I have given this 5/5 because the instructions and tips were great, the macaroons i made tasted so good...however i rushed making them and that was my first mistake!  allow yourself plenty of time and i think next time i would make them smaller as i seemed to make them a bit big so when i tried to assemble them they were much to thin

Amazing recipe. My first attempt at making macarons using a different recipe was a complete failure, but I tried this one on my second attempt and I was impressed with how easy it was to follow and how beautiful everything came together. Thanks for sharing!

I liked this recipe. I saw some other's reviews about there being air pockets. To get rid of them, bang the trays against the counter to release the air.

Followed the directions weighing all ingredients, and it worked the first time!  I did have to bake for about double the time listed here, as half of the macarons were still underbaked when I tried to remove them from the oven (that's the only time they stuck - when they weren't cooked all the way through).  I simply removed those that were done, and put the rest back into the oven.  Next time, I'll either reverse their position in the oven after about 8 minutes, or I might try the convection oven.  I used a silicone mat that is marked on one side with circles for macarons purchased from Amazon.com, and it made creating perfect macarons of equal size and shape easy, and the cookies came off without any effort.  As another reviewer suggested, I will reduce the 50 grams of baker's sugar to 35 grams the next time around, as this was a little too sweet for us.  I used a salted caramel and a strawberry buttercream filling.  Both were yummy, but next time, I think I'll pipe the icing onto the cookie to keep from sometimes shattering the shell.

I made this recipe a while back.  I was diligent in following the original poster's additional instructions.

One mistake I made was I under-mixed the batter.  As such, the first half of my cookies looked like bulls-eyes.  

I found success in used parchment paper sprayed with cooking spray (as one previous commenter suggested).  I also used a silicon baking mat, which was fine but not as good.  I'm sure an actual brand-name Silpat works better than an ordinary silicon baking mat though.

Thank you so much Elle for posting this recipe.

After trying four other different recipes, these macarons turned out really well for me! Although my piping skills need to be improved. I added gel food coloring before adding the almond & sugar to the egg whites. I baked mine for about 20 minutes (after ten minutes it still stuck to the parchment paper). 
Also, using butter cream was too sweet for me, so I filled mine with vanilla whipped cream. I plan on making this again.

the prep and waiting for the skin to harden is the most irritating thing about this recipe, hence the 4 stars. they didn't taste all that great, but came out beautiful and baked perfectly. i think it all really depends on what filling you use. they are just so sugary and sticky. when they are filled and packaged, they are they gorgeous.

These came out great! I followed the recipe exactly (just added some green gel coloring). I also used the weight measurements in order to be more exact. I think next time though I will either increase the oven temp or the bake time. They came out a bit soft. I'd like to get them a little more crisp on the outside. But other than that, they were delicious!

I made this recipe and it turned out perfect. I made it twice and there were never any cracks. I've tried other recipes and they never turned out well. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. As far as the fillings, I used Nutella.

While I loved the fact this recipe came with a video tutorial that I utilized step by step through this process, the recipe itself I found way too sweet. My macarons tasted of nothing more than  confectionary sugar. Very disappointing. Ended up throwing out the entire batch and freezing the filling I made for it.

I followed the recipe via weight instead of measure and they turned out perfectly.  I found that the optimum time to bake was 12 minutes to get the dry enough to easily remove from the  parchment paper.  If they are sticking to the paper, you didn’t bake them enough.

I have had to experiment with this recipe to get them to turn out right. First, it is essential to sift the confectioner's sugar and almonds.  I use almond flour which is finely ground and works well.  If you wish to tint the macarons, add color paste to the egg whites before beating; otherwise, you will overmix the batter. I purchased a macaron mat at Michaels which helped. The biggest issue I had with this recipe was the oven temperature and bake time resulted in underdone cookies that stuck to the mat after cooling. I increased the oven temperature to 310, baked for 7-8 minutes, quickly opened and closed the oven door and baked for an additional 7 minutes. After cooling these popped off the mat perfectly.  I filled with a chocolate ganache.  They were delicious.

It is harder than you would think! I have tried twice: the first time I over mixed and they did not develop a "foot" and when baked they did not rise. The second time I made stiff peaks and didn't mix enough. I got the foot - YAY! But when baked the tops cracked and fell in. I will try again. This recipe will not get the better of me!

This is the second time I made macarons, and the first time I made them with this recipe. I measured the recipe by grams. Made sure to sift before measuring to be more precise. I made no changes to the recipe. Used gel colouring. Piped on both a silicon baking sheet and parchment paper that I lightly greased with regular butter. Let the macarons sit for more than 30 minutes. Macarons came out wonderful! They didn't crack, and had feet! I just need to work on making them the same size and shape. Filled with Cream Cheese icing and Dulce de Leche in the center. So yummy!

I'm a bit of a perfectionist.  I don't like to fail.  I love to bake.  My background is science and math.  These attributes, I believe, are beneficial when it comes to baking.  Before attempting French macarons for the first time, I conducted a considerable amount of research:  read many recipes, reviews, and watched videos.  I selected this recipe for two reasons: 1) it was developed, tested, and perfected by a baker and his/her apprentice.  2) It had a significant amount of favorable reviews.
Although I followed this recipe, I did adopt a few techniques/suggestions which I had read repeatedly from other recipes/reviews/videos which raved increased success if adopted.  I will specify these below.  Here is what I did, didn’t do, and my results.
As per the suggestions in this recipes footnotes and the “Most helpful positive review” written by the original submitter of this recipe:  I weighed all ingredients.  I used almond flour rather than ground my own from whole almonds.  I let the macarons set for 1 hour prior to baking.   I didn’t have a shifter, so I used a blender to mix the almond flour and confectioner’s sugar as per the suggestion.
The majority of the other recipes/reviews/videos instructed to whisk the meringue until stiff peaks form, rather than soft peaks as per this recipe.  With this on my mind, I unintentionally whisked my meringue until stiff peaks formed.  Once I folded in my dry ingredients, my batter was thicker than I what I had expected from watching vide

The first time i tried these, i followed the directions exactly, except for using greased parchment instead of a silicone mat. After 10 minutes, they looked nice on the outside but were fully uncooked on the inside. 

Thinking that my oven must be off, i bought an oven thermometer for my second try. So with a confirmed 285 degrees i tried again, this time cooking for 13 minutes. They were much better the second time around, but still a bit undone on the inside. 

If i try again, i'd shoot for 18-20 minutes. I have no idea how people are getting these to fully bake in 10 minutes.

The batter was completely liquid with an exception of a few clumps of the sifted almond meal the first time I made it. Then I found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ636Y8N6E8 on Beth's Foolproof French Macarons, and the second time I made it it turned out perfect the second time, but it was very sweet. I hope this video will help you too.

The first time, I didn't weigh my ingredients, since of course I didn't read the reviews until after I've made them. But both times, they came out very flat, the outside shell seemed perfect, but the inside was completely unbaked. I'm not a master baker, so I don't know if I'm over mixing, we're not cooking them long enough. I may try this recipe one more time, baking them longer.

Wonderful macarons! This was the first time I made them and they turned out great! I ground my almonds and that was no problem. I baked them on parchment paper and no sticking! They even had perfect feet! I filled them with frosting and everyone loved them. I will use this recipe again 100%. I was skeptical at first because I thought macaroons would be too hard but they weren't. So if any of you have doubts just make this, if done right, you won't regret it.

It looked great until I put them on the sheet. They were very runny in the sheet, runny enough so that when I came back an hour later to stick them in the oven some had merged together. After baking and cooling, I tried to get them off the tray only to have the top shells crumble into pieces and the bottom part to be completely stuck to the sheet (I used parchment paper). I got about 10 usable cookies from the recipe, they were quite cracked however and a bit too sweet. I give it three stars because this is my first time trying these and I am aware its a very difficult recipe that I'll have to work on to perfect.

My teenage daughter made these today. She weighed out the ingredients per the footnotes. We used almond flour. She cooked them for 12 minutes before taking them out, but realized after they cooled that they were not done. She put them back in the oven and they did puff up this time. 

We will be making these again, next time using less sugar with the egg whites and cooking longer. After hearing how hard macarons were to make, we found this recipe easy to follow and turned out great.

I flavored my macarons using a vanilla bean and tried to color them blue with gel food color, but they ended up looking green as I was afraid if I added more color that I would ruin the macarons. Other than that I measured the ingredients out with measuring cups and sifted to the best of my abilities and the macarons turned out perfect! My first try too. I filled them with a chocolate ganache, thus creating heavenly little pillows of chocolate and vanilla goodness. I will definitely try this again and in varying flavors.

I have tried several other recipes but was not successful.  I thought I gave this a last try and viola it turned out perfect.  You must follow the measurement and instructions religiously, do not over mix the egg white and bake it on the lowest level of the oven,  My first batch did not turn our right because I was using an insulated baking sheet, the bottom stuck to the silicon mat.  Great recipe and the result comparable to those I sampled in Paris. Please visit my blog "mi0ven.com" for Singapore/Malaysian dessert recipe.

I had some trouble. Maybe my almond meal wasn't ground fine enough?  I also made a lot and separated the batter and added food coloring and extract--maybe that's why.

The directions were great for such a difficult recipe. I do think that 35 to 40g of sugar would be plenty. It is too sweet with 50g.  I wish there was better instruction on when to add food coloring. I did weigh out all of my ingredients and the texture was okay but I am certain if I made them smaller they would cook in the time suggested. I think they need to be piped about the size of a 50 cent piece. You cannot find the footnotes in the mobile version of the site so it did take a while to find the measurements. Patience is definitely key in making this recipe. Someone asked me to make these for a birthday party for kids and I decided no after the ultimate failure on my first try. I am sure with practice it would get easier.

They barely blended together. Then when I tried to pipe them onto the baking sheet they seemed all right and then clumped together to make these massive pools of batter.

I've used this recipe for shells many times with great success...now I've come back to it again to make another batch and cannot find the weights!! The website has been re-formated and I can't find the footnotes. Can anyone help and post the ingredient weights for me? Thank you!

Great recipe! I used the silicon mats on my pan which affected my cooking time, along with my elevation so the first tray was undercooked I went with 320 for the temp and 15 minutes. I made them rootbeer flavour!

just a suggestion based on my experience with a mortar and pestle at work but if you cannot find ground almonds or if they are expensive you might try using one of these to ground them - it is what phamacists use to ground tablets for compounding and it grinds them very fine - it is relatively inexpensive too - just FYI

It turned pretty well and pretty.  My daughter and I had fun making this.  I would like to play with this recipe such as flavoring it and pairing it with different fillings.  Make sure your sieve your powdered sugar and almond flour really well.

Follow the instructions exactly. Sift the almond flour and confectioners sugar twice; it has to be ultra fine. Delicious! And I'll definitely make these again (and again!).

Like the OP states in the comment section, you should weigh the ingredients out.  I followed all of their tips and tricks and came out with perfect cookies on my first try.  These are now asked for all the time by friends and family.

I did the following and it miraculously worked for me:

3 fresh egg whites (size not important, mix on setting 6 until stiff peaks)
35 g white sugar
110 g almond flour
190 g confectioners sugar
I added a splash of lemon extract.

Fold until just incorporated. Pipe high so they grow tall and keep it small ~ a quarter coin size (it will spread a little) - leave 1 inch of space in between each.  They just dried faster for me than my big ones. Drop the tray a few times and use a tool/your nail to push batter over the holes.
Very Important: Leave to dry until you can lightly poke it with your nail and it will not indent - feel hard and close to their final texture. For me, I used a box fan and left them in front of it for 2 hours (I did other errands). 
Baking: preheat oven to 375F.  Reduce heat to 325F, then put the sheet. Bake 5 min. Rotate tray. Bake 6 min. Take sheet out and reheat oven to 375F for next sheet. I did one sheet at time since I had 1 batch on silpat and 1 on parchment paper and I didn't know how their times would differ. Another tip: it is better to slightly overbake than to underbake since overbaked macarons are salvagable so if they look wrinkly or not like the final product, leave em in the oven.

Everything seemed to work well except the baking time. I took the first batch out after 10 min, and they flattened shortly after. I tried putting them back in, but it was too late. I let the next batch stay in about 18 min and those came out perfectly. Unfortunately I only had those two batches, so I only have 9 macarons to take to the party we are attending. Kind of sad.

The only change I now make is I heat the oven to 300 and bake for 18-20 min, then let them cool on the sheet. I also prefer parchment to a silpat. You really have to weigh your ingredients. Awesome recipe, thank you!

This recipe is the best macaron recipe I’ve found (and I’ve tried a bunch). YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WEIGH the ingredients. Does not work otherwise. Also you must wait an hour. Any less and the cookies bake out and are flat. Appreciate this excellent recipe. Would love variations for other flavors. I don’t want to mess it up by adding chocolate.

This was a very good first attempt!  Watched the video (very helpful), read the extra notes from the author and all of the reviewers and went for it!  I used parchment paper and as an experiment sprayed half of the surface with Pam and left the other half dry.  The cookies slid right off of the sprayed side, but needed a little coaxing from the other side. So spray it is.  I took them out at nine minutes, but will leave in for the full 10 minutes next time.  I piped Nutella on them and they were amazing!

This works great! I used this recipe for chocolate macarons by adding 2 Tbsp of cocoa powder (I prefer Hershey's 100%)to my dry ingredients. Through my trial and error I found it easier to not over whip the whites if I got them just barely fluffy with the beater and then finish them off by hand with a wisk. It took more work, but it was all the more rewarding!

This recipe with all the great suggestions in the helpful reviews is 5 stars. I like the idea to substitute 40g of cocoa or fruit powder for 20g each of powdered sugar and almonds. I did bake, preheating the oven to 275 and then drop down to 225 when you put each pan in the oven. 10-12 minutes was enough for this. My silpat was not as successful. The batch baked on parchment was great. Don't over pipe the circles, they will spread a bit. I made non-dairy fillings for my gluten-free, dairy-free friend. Great recipe!

I’ve increased the temp and the time for my conventional oven at home. I’ve also added the fan like someone suggested , after piping, and what I’m witnessing in the oven is beautiful macarons, but you must weigh! Look for the notes for measure in grams and get yourself a scale! These look beautiful! I’m at 17 minutes temp 300 oven at about 305 watching my oven temp with another oven thermometer I hung from the rack. I checked at 12 min, gently touch the top of the cookie ... if there is movement it’s not ready! They were definitely NOT ready and not ready at 16. They needed the extra min. So far they look great at 17 minutes. I put them back in front of the fan to cool and they are wonderful! Beautiful macarons! It’s a nice cool day here in NH. Not much humidity, about 65°.

Just an FYI adding about a 1/2 tsp of Cream of Tarter to the egg whites helps them mix faster. Also I've made these plenty of times and I only use parchment paper. Everyone has their own preference but parchment paper has worked perfectly for me. I refuse to buy a silicone mat for one recipe. I use an electric stove, I actually cook them on 275 for about 13-15 min.

This was our second time making macarons, but the first time we used a different recipe, and they turned out very strange and had no foot. This time, they were PERFECT.  The cookies were a perfect size, looked good, and had a great flavor. We didn't change anything about the recipe, but we did need to cook it for a few extra minutes.

First time ever making macarons and they turned out amazing. Perfectly crispy shell, chewy middle. They puffed up perfectly! 


I used superfine almond flour for these.  I beat the merengue a little stiffer thank soft peak but still not stiff and folded in the almond mixture with about 25 folds.  Use a toothpick to pop bubbles while the batter is still setting, before it starts to harden.


Filled with a vanilla & honey buttercream these beauties were a hit! 


I'll be making these often!

I was in the process of making these and luckily I started with grinding the almonds. This ingredient is a horrible idea as there is too much moisture in the nuts to create a fine powder. Either there needs to be more instructions or a specific machine is needed. If you had just said to buy almond flour, I'd be able to complete this recipe. As it stands, I'm stuck with unusable almond mush that cost me money that I could have spent on useful almond flour. And I have no cookies. Disappointed.

HORRIBLE RECIPE! I tried this recipe 4 times and could not get it to bake correctly. The oven temperature they list is too low, and even boosting the temperature and cook times did not result in perfect cookies. When I finally got the cookies to bake, they were brown.

First, my fault for not recognizing that almonds had to be flour- like texture for sifting with flour.  These cookies are so sweet I couldn't eat more than 1.  I ended up not filling them but drizzling them with a semi-sweet/milk chocolate drizzle. Sorry, but not a satisfyingly successful effort.  We've bought them many times so know what we were going for.

I'm not a very experienced baker, and I didn't expect these macarons to be very good, but they were excellent! I tasted them, but they tasted sort of ...sticky? Is that normal? Anyway, I'm sure I added too much sugar, really sweet. Also, I didn't add any food coloring, but it still had a little brown color. ( not that I'm complaining, they look professional.) I used two trays on two different racks, but the one on the bottom had cracks, and didn't look as good as the one on top.

I've been baking macarons professionally the last 4 years ... Your proportions look pretty standard although they should be weighed if possible ... The main issue I see is that the oven temp and time suggestions are way off.  These shells are not done until you can reach into the oven and easily and cleanly peel one of the shells off  the silpat or parchment.  A correctly cooked macaron will be very firm after it cools so when the filling is added it absorbs the moisture from the filling and has the correct chewy texture after maturation.  I would recommend a temp of 305-315 for around 12-15 minutes for silpats or parchment but use one cookie sheet for silpats and  two cookie sheets for parchment.

If you're ever unsure if you are cooking them long enough and here is an easy trick so that you can tell....... After your cookies have baked and cooled completely then grab your ugliest shell (almost every batch will have one that just didn't come out perfect) and drop it on the ground ... If it's so moist that none of the shell breaks or cracks then it's undercooked.

Very good recipe! Only thing is that the baking time is too short. 15-18 minutes worked better for me

When I made this recipe it took me 2 attempts to get it right which is not bad, but the 2nd attempt turned really delicate the tops were easy to crack and 1/3 of the batch were cracked. I waited the 1 hour and baked it, did I do something wrong? Did I need to adjust the time myself?

I have been baking for years but macarons still scare the  out of me... I finally made them tonight and they turned out great! 

Based on reviews, here are some minor tweaks I made to the recipe:
- added a bit of cream of tartar to the egg whites, which were room temperature 
- I used a specialty macaron silicon mat, nothing stuck to it and it had little circles for piping guidance
- baked for 20 mins, they were nowhere near done after 10 mins (I do use an oven thermometer)

I filled them with homemade chocolate almond frosting... it was a bit too rich for me. I think I’d stick to a lighter filling next time. 

I will definitely be making these again! Such a simple recipe :)

First time attempting macarons, and omg they turned out pretty good! Easy recipe to follow, and tips along the way way great (eg how the batter would flatten when piped). I did over cook them slightly though, as came out a bit crunchy, but the buttercream softened them after about 12hours though, so pretty good. I put them in for designated time, however were undercooked...so put them in for longer...ended up forgetting to set a timer, hence why came out slightly over cooked lol but definitely a recipe I would use again!

This is by far the worst macaron recipe I have ever had the displeasure of making. The first I messed up I just thought that I made it wrong not the recipe but by the third try  I realized that these macrons will never turn out. Thanks for nothing.

The 3 star review is only because of the instructions given in the video. I followed it and added only 50 grams of egg whites, instead of the 100 grams I should have added. When I saw the batter was too thick, I added more whipped egg whites, but I’m sure the recipe suffered.

I made a double batch of these the first time I made them and I’m so very grateful I did.  I knew it was a complicated recipe, not in the ingredients, but in the techniques.  I used the weight measurements and made 100% sure I was dead on, which is rare for me because I’m a kind of “do what you like” cook.  It took three different sets of baked to finally get it perfect.  Again- I made no adjustments to the recipe.  But heres what I did find: 1) a Silpat is completely necessary.  So much that after my first two bakes, I went to the store to buy one because by the end of my second bake I was in tears.  2)Like with all recipes, it was important for me to pay attention to how warm my oven was against what the recipe called for.  I ended up adding an additional minute and a half to my cook time in the end to make them perfect.  Finally 3) Even with the Silpat, they didn’t just pop off like I wanted them to.  So I took a pairing knife and slid it under each one.  It worked and I was able to have 32 beautiful macaron cookies, which I then turned into 16 sandwich cookies.  My husband and both daughters gobbled them up and all agreed this is their new favorite cookie.  It is a ton of effort, way more than two hours for this lady!  But every minute was worth it when they were fighting over who gets the most of them.

This recipe looks a little daunting but it was actually not as tricky as I thought it would be...and it’s delicious! Mine came out perfect the first time ( some were not perfect round at first). Light. Flaky. Just enough stick to the teeth perfection. I think my big learning was to pipe it from the center of the cookie and don’t move your piping bag around in circles in attempt to make them round. I filled mine with whipped cream and cream cheese frosting. Delicious.

I made these and halved the recipe, because I didn’t want that many. I set the oven for 285, and they were burnt after three minutes. Would not reuse this recipe.

Amazing! Made these with the girls, our poor piping skills not withstanding, and they turned out amazing! They tasted just as good as the expensive store bought ones, and we had a ton of fun making and eating them all afternoon.

This was my first attempt at macarons, and I thought it was pretty successful. I added a splash of strawberry extract and gel coloring, and I filled them with a strawberry buttercream. I had to bake them much longer at 285 degrees, more like 15-16 minutes. Ten minutes left them too soft in the middle and sticking to my baking mat. Mine developed proportionate looking feet, no lumps, and they were not hollow, so all in all, a win!

perfect macaron recipe. follow directions carefully. drop of lemon juice or cream of tartar will help egg whites hold volume. These are so delicious and very impressive. Oh, my oven takes 20 minutes. Just be sure macaron's will come away from paper with spatula before you remove from oven.  Cooling them slowly will help prevent cracking. I fill mine with dark chocolate ganache.
Here are gram weights for those who prefer. egg whites, 105 g.;  granulated sugar, 50g; 10x sugar, 377 g.; almond meal, 84 g.

I feel like I've tried to make Macarons 100's of times and they never work. Easy or complicated methods and recipes have all failed.... Except this one. At last I've done it!! My measurements are not precise and this still works but I would say one key thing for me was a silicone baking sheet on top of a baking tray and leaving the piped round Macarons out for as long as possible before putting them in the oven. I left them for two hours and they rose evenly and perfectly round. Fantastic recipe!!!

I substituted Hazelnuts for the almonds, and baked for 1 hour instead of 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the macarons were still gooey. Need to bake till they are dried and can be removed from the silicon mat with your fingers, and the bottom is shiny. For the first time you make these, watch the baking closely, check every 10-15 minutes. 
They came out really good. The filling I made was ganache with raspberry.

This is a perfect recipe! I followed to a tee and did not change anything. I've actually tried several other recipes that have slightly different measurements. It's very intimidating at first and it takes a few batches and watching videos but now I know the recipe by heart and I've had many people tell me my macarons are better than some they've bought at French bakeries (I now buy the almond flour and powder sugar from Costco in bulk!) I've also found that it's not necessary to measure out by grams--I did this at first but then realized that is not a science either. Used consistently the same measuring cups and spoons and got consistent results every time. My family's favorite flavors are green tea and espresso macarons that I make. Add 1 Tbsp of either matcha green tea powder or espresso powder to the dry ingredients, mix it well prior to adding to the egg white mixture. Also add the corresponding powder to the buttercream mixture for the flavor. It's definitely important to let the cookies set at room temp (I do 45-60 mins depending on the weather) before baking. This certainly helps to dry out the shell so you get that slightly crispy exterior but still chewy on the inside. And "slapping" the pan on the counter a couple times helps to get out the air bubbles and create those beautiful feet. Thanks so much for this--I LOVE making macarons and this is by far the best recipe for macarons that people think are professionally made.

I made this with a friend and oh my goodness it was amazing. They had a gorgeous hard shell yet it was light, fluffy, and slightly chewy on the inside. We filled them with meringue and lemon curd and was absolutely delicious—we ate them all in one sitting! However we had to put them in for around 20 minutes total (give or take) because we found that after 10 minutes they weren't very cooked and they fell apart really easily. Definitely would make again—super fun, super easy, super tasty!

I was very excited about these, my batter looked amazing but when I baked them to the exact directions they came out raw! And when I cooked them for longer at low heat for short periods of time they bubbles and cracked. They looked awful and I’m very disappointed

I really wanted to love these, but I only found them okay. They are way too sweet for me and the baking time was too short for my oven. Those two components together meant that I think these are edible, but I'm not being drawn back to the kitchen for more. Should I ever try them again, I'll leave out some of the powdered sugar and see how that works.

This batter came out just perfectly. However I was making wider macarons, so they didn't cook properly. Most macarons cooking directions go by quarter size wafers. When making bigger ones add more time to get the film development correct. Sometimes it could take as long as 45 min.

Temp is way too low. They don’t cook through. Even after 17 minutes, was just a pretty shell with a gloppy mess inside.

This was my first time trying macarons, I’d say I did pretty good but when I tried taking them off the silicon mat I noticed they were uncooked. I tried cooking them for up to a half hour extra but they were still mushy in the middle, they looked fine otherwise. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT WENT WRONG, I LOVE MACARONS AND I CANNOT FIND THEM ANYWHERE! Thanks!

While this is the recipe I use for macarons, there are a few major things you need to know: 1. DO NOT USE A SILPAT! If you do this, the macaroons will stick. Every. Single. Time. I use parchment paper and it works fine. 2. You don't need to measure by weight. The cup measures should work most of the time unless your ingredients are weird. That's all ?

The heat that was told on the recipe wasn't high enough and the cook time wasn't long enough. The inside was all gooey that you couldn't eat it.

This is a great recipe. The macarons came out perfect. Delicious, soft, perfect texture inside and out. I recommend watching YouTube videos  to help with exactly what each stage needs to look like.   I had trouble with the egg whites initially, so here are my recommendations for a smooth start: crack open fresh, cold egg whites. I was not successful with the store bought carton-boxed egg whites. Measure the weight on a scale, as recommended by OP. After measuring, I realized I needed four eggs total. The night before, put the eggs in an air-tight container, and leave them out. I live in a mild climate, so nothing happened to the egg whites overnight. The next day, make the macarons and you'll have a much easier time with beating the egg whites.     I used a KitchenAid mixer for the beating and it was slow to produce results in the beginning. So I did the "dime" test (Google it!) and adjusted the height of the bowl. That helped tremendously, because the whisk was able to reach the bottom of the bowl.     Finally, I flavored the mix with earl grey tea leaves from a teabag and added violet food coloring. Perfect!! Can't wait to make these again!

The first batch I overmixed and the batter was very runny and thin. Second batch was better but then they cracked and didn't hold up well. Overall, both batches were way too sweet and sticky, I wasn't a fan.

Worst macaroons I’ve ever made. Didn’t turn out at all. I’ve never had this much trouble with a Mac recipe. I was super excited to use my new kitchen aid stand mixer. Merengue was perfect, batter looked good and then they didn’t cook. Adding more time only made them crack. Waste of time and ingredients. Won’t make this again.

I made this and I didn't see the comments. I really wish that they didn't change it. They ended up really smushy and weird. We put them back in the oven to see if they will turn out better. Yes, we let them sit for the right amount of time

These were really good macarons. I made them 2  times, the first time I had them in the oven at 285 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 and they didn't seem to be baked all the way. The tops seemed fine but the rest was not cooked enough. The second time I had the oven at  300 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes and that seemed to help and the macaron was baked fully.

I made this, but did what the recipe said and later found out it was more egg whites rather than the one quoted.  So once I did the 100mg of egg whites, it went fine.  Scaled everything and it was easy.  Will do this many times.  I added the raspberry flavor and pink color during the whipping of the egg whites and then added the shifted almond flour and confection sugar.  Went well.  Might want to make that change on the front so people don't make that mistake.

Quick tip, before letting them set tap the pan on the table or whatever you're cooking on to release air bubles.

I supposed if you're OK with about a 25% yield rate of actual good-quality macarons, this recipe is OK. It's easy to follow. Certainly not full proof, though, and only a small percentage of the cookies turn out looking like real macarons and not some sad-faced two-bit imitation.

I have made 3 batches and they came out perfect except for hollows. I made a mistake and turned my oven 100F higher than required for the first pan of my third batch. They cooked in 7 min, had really brown bottoms, but perfect other than that so I kept them. I cut the temp down and cooked the rest of the macaroons. When it came time to try them the ones with brown bottoms were the only ones not hollow. Should I adjust cooking temp? My oven is gas and on point with temp, I have a thermometer inside of the oven as well. I just can not seem to make macaroons without hollows unless I burn them.

A few friends and I got together to make these, our very first time with macarons and they were amazing! Living at 8,200 ft baking at high altitude can be tough, but we didn't even alter this recipe and they turned out amazing. We ground our own almonds and we're a bit skeptical, but after filling them a yummy dark chocolate filling. So happy and we plan to experiment with a few more flavors in the future!

This recipe is perfect. This was my fist time trying macarons, and they were PERFECT. I followed the comment from the original submitter that had some tips for making the recipe successful. Instead of sifting the powdered sugar and almond flour, I ran them through my food processor. Also, I added my food coloring in at around 22 strokes. Do NOT go over 30 strokes total or the mixture will be too runny. Overall, GREAT recipe!

I've tried to make this recipe six or seven times now. The first time I got a decent cookie, but out of all my tries today (using the gram weights and varying the way I was cooking them to try to get an edible result), nothing has worked. I either get an under-cooked blob or a dry brick of sugar; there doesn't seem to be any in-between. I really wanted this to work, but for me it was a huge waste of ingredients.

Fantastic flavor and crunch for the shell--but the insides were a different story. It's true that one of the key points of appeal of the macaron is the almond-y, sweet crunch of the shell contrasting with the slightly fudgy-cakey insides, but  I couldn't get em off the sheets when I'd cooled them. 

I recommend freezing up the whole sheet or mat for around 15 minutes before you try and take it off.

I need help! I've made these twice, both times they look good, no cracks, nice feet, don't stick to parchment paper, but they are hollow! They seem to be a bit under cooked on the inside, and the outside is completely perfect. What am I doing wrong? I've cooked them at  285° For about 11 mins. Should I change the temp?

I made these macaroons and they were awful. I don't know if I did something wrong, but when they went in the oven, they spread way to far so I was left with macaroon batter covering the bottom of the pan.

I did exactly what the recipe said: weighed my ingredients, was gentle with the batter, and let them sit for at least 45 minutes (because I was impatient, hungry, and excited). These came out perfectly! I added a sachet of instant coffee for coffee-flavored ones, a teaspoon of rose water for rose-flavored, and a sprig of dried lavender for lavender-flavored.  My only adjustment was that I baked them for 11 to 14 minutes, while consistently checking on them, because the macarons were still sticky on the bottom for some, which caused the bottoms to rip off. My biggest tip would be to SIFT, SIFT, AND SIFT!

this recipe was sooo good, our macarons tasted great ,the only thing that went wrong was that when we were mixing  the eggs with the almonds and sugar we over mixed it so our macarons didn't rise that well.Also if you are doing food coloring you should put it in right as you start folding the almonds and sugar!!

Everything was perfect with the batter until it came to baking. 10 minutes was WAY too short. My first tray was severely undercooked. My second tray was in for 20+ minutes and looked great when I pulled it out. However after letting it cool it was also undercooked. I had another 4 on a third tray, left in for over 30min. They not only browned on top but were still slightly undercooked and lost most of the inside when removing from the sheet.

Having never made macarons before, I found that this recipe is quite easy, and I followed the recipe exactly. I made a simple almond buttercream frosting, and a raspberry compote for the filling, and am getting requests to make them so often that my mixer is constantly at the ready. I don't color the cookie due to allergies but the filling makes them look very classy.

a great recipe, although theres definitely things I can improve on. I beat the egg whites too much, so when in the oven, I still got feet, but it spread out too much.  I mixed with an electric mixer, but when adding the almond and sugar mixture, I used a spatula. I used parchment paper and they did not stick.  I left the them on the tray for an hour till the tops were shiny. 
I'm still unsure about baking times. I warmed the oven for 300, and lowered it to 275 when I put them in, but at 10 minutes they were still soft.

This was a great recipe! My only suggestion would be to use a lightly greased parchment paper, instead of a silicone mat. I did two batches, one with each, and the parchment paper batch not only came off easier, but rose much more. 

Also be sure to weigh things with a scale! (I made these with a blueberry jam, they were delicious!)

THIS RECIPE ROCKS!! I was so nervous about spending so much time for a simple cookie, but the steps are all so necessary and will yield you fabulous macarons if adhered to. One important point that the recipe misses: allow your egg whites to reach room temperature before whipping. Well worth the time and the purchase of a food scale! Will be making these again!

This recipe is awesome! The first time I made them, I didn't have almond flour, so I tried grounding the almonds myself. :( They didn't turn out good. But then, I bought some almond flour, and then I made them, and they turned out almost perfect. The only bad thing, was my macaroons didn't grow any *FEET*  ! ! !

But overall, it was awesome, me and my friends couldn't stop eating them! They kept begging me for more, I loved them. And they weren't too sweet like my family says, they were perfect to me. :) :) :) :) I

Made the recipe and love it! Weighed the ingredients and just for a hint of stability I added cream of tartar. Tastes amazing. They were a little runny and a couple cracked but I think that is due to me not the recipe. Probably over mixed or under whipped my whites. Love it! Will be using again!

I can't believe how "easy" this recipe made these. I always thought it was gonna be a long torturous process... followed the instructions to the letter except that I did use parchment paper instead bc I don't have a silicone mat, and came out with beautiful puffy little bits of heaven with crunchy outsides and chewy insides and so yummy. Also, I ran out of time so didn't get to make proper filling; we opted for Nutella in half and strawberry jam in the other half :)

Macarons came out with great feet and a nice rise, which is more than I can say about other recipes I tried.  Simple methods that really work, forget about italian meringues or aging of egg whites, this recipe just plain works.  The only fault I found was the sweetness, it's just too sweet for my taste and I'm afraid that changing the sugar ratio will spoil the results, I'll try lowering the sugar on the merengue and see how that pans out.

Followed the recipe and weighed the ingredients and used fine almond flour. The only reason I did not give a 5 star was because I think the cooking time is off. I had to cook them for almost twice as long to ensure they were done. With the cooking time as listed the bottoms were not done. I made them a couple of times, I must say adding a little cocoa powder (and sifting it in with the powdered sugar and almond flour) and then filling them with nutella is delightful! Next, time I will add a little ginger and do a lemon filling ;)

These turned out surprisingly nice!  
I separated the mixture into two halfway through the folding and added flavorings and colors, then continued mixing until it reached a "lava-like" consistency.   
Some extra tips/observations: 1) make sure egg whites are at room temp.  Adding cream of tartar will also help the texture.
2) weighing ingredients is key.  
3) I used both parchment paper and silpat.  The macarons lifted much better from the parchment.  
4)  whack the tray on the bottom a few times after piping to remove air bubbles.
5)  mine baked for about 18 minutes.

Followed the recipe as was called for....even the egg. It turned out superbly. My only query though is this: after sifting the almond flour and icing sugar, there are sooo much leftover in the sieve, do I add more to make up what is lost or carry on as is?

Okay so what is missing from this recipe is that you have to bang the pan on the counter a couple times to get all the air pockets out. This will help the cookies rise, give them feet, and come off nice and easy.

Awesome recipe!! A few tips I used from other recipes is have ROOM TEMPETURE eggs and blend the almond meal + confection sugar for 2-3 min, then sift 2 times. If you want to add color, then do it when you mix all the ingredients together. Goodluck!

This has become my "go to " macarons recipe!  I  add different flavors to both the cookie and the fillings and the crowd goes wild! This recipe is well deserving of 5 stars since the measurements and instructions go above and beyond.  I have made these several times and did not go into anywhere near the detail of the author  (like weighing ingredients in metric gauge- I don't even have any tools that do that lol) and they still come out perfect and get raves!

FORM: This recipe creates the perfect looking cookie. You get the smooth, shiny tops and little feet. My only issue is that my cookies are not easily removed from the silicon mat. They stick and even with meticulous handling, I could only get a handful of perfect cookies with each batch I've tried. I was reading through the other comments and the weighed instructions might be better than the volume ones. I will try to weigh my measurements next time and see how that goes.

MODIFICATION: I added 1 tbsp of unsweetened matcha green tea powder for flavoring and it was perfect. I like a really flavorful cookie, so if you want more of a hint of flavor, I'd go with 2 tsp instead. I also reduced the sugar I used in the egg whites because my first batch was too sweet.

I followed the directions exactly and was very pleased with the results.  It took about 20 minutes for the cookie to set up before I could bake them.  I baked for a minute or two less (probably because regulating oven to exact temp recommended is difficult on standard dial)  I filled them with chocolate ganache.  They were a huge hit with my friends.  I will definitely be making them again.

I tried this recipe tonight, and it worked really well! I sifted everything twice, just to make sure it was ground enough. I recommend when using food color, use dye. It makes the batter runnier, making for a better looking macaron. This was my third time trying... and well, third time's a charm!

I used a scale and measured accordingly.  Also I followed some of the other reviews and baked them at 285 but left them in for a total of 20 min (rotating halfway).  Also I added 1 tbs of coco powder and it came out fantastic.

I have tried a couple of other french macaron recipes that i have found online and nothing seems to work until i tried this one out . The batch i made had no cracks,  are not hollow  and had feet at the first try using this recipe.  I'm glad I found this here and thank you!

They seems like a super easy recipe!! I'm only a kid but I bake like an adult so it doesn't seem so so hard i guess. If u were going to do chocolate macaroons would u still use the almond meal (fine almonds) or would u replace the coca with the almonds?

This is my first time making French Macarons, and I have to say, I was very doubtful that they would bake correctly. To my surprise, they baked perfectly. I was patient and let them completely dry before I baked them. I weighed the ingredients just as the author suggested. They were in the oven at 285 for 14 minutes. It was a tad to sweet for me and my family. I'll be experimenting in the following weeks.... Very good recipe though.

My daughter saw macaron's  being made on a cooking show and heard how difficult it can be to get them right...so of course she wanted to give them a shot!!  Followed the recipe using the weight measurements and cut down the white sugar to 35 g as was recommended by another reviewer.  I don't have a silicone baking mat, so I used parchment paper and prayed.  I did let them cook for about 15 mins to dry them just a tad more and they came right off.  Used a chocolate buttercream filling, and they were wonderful!!!

I made this recipe precisely as it's written and they turned out perfectly. I've never made macarons before and I've been too intimidated to try them, but these are absolutely beautiful. Use weight measurements and follow the instructions exactly.

Mine turned out great! At least as good as the macarons I had in France. They  had the perfect texture and were very shiny; I filled with an almond white chocolate ganache. 
A few extra tips:

It MUST be a silicone baking mat, I tried using waxed paper and parchment and was unable to get the cookies off.

Wait until they are completely cooled to remove from the silpat.

I left mine out on the counter for only 30 minutes and it was fine. 

I had to leave mine in for longer than 10 minutes---possibly because my silpat was on an airbake. Just use your eyes for the amount of time past 10 minutes.

I store mine in an airtight container in the fridge and they stay good for a long time!

This is my first time closely following a macaron recipe. Weighing ingredients was  very helpful-no guesswork. I used parchment paper. I got feet but the cookies did not puff up- they are more like wafers and they  were gluey inside at 10 minutes baking. Piping onto the baking sheets resulted in odd shapes, but that is my lack of skill, not the recipe. Using an old chopstick to sculpt the edges worked well.

Right now I have a great many clam shells which I can fill. Next time will be better.

Lesson's learned: 
I tried today. The shape is not great (too moist) but the taste is absolutely delicious! I just have learned a few tips from the other reviews. Will definitely try again next time with following change: (1) accurate measurement (2) use food processor to make the ground almond finer and mix with icing sugar better (3) bake longer time with lower temperature.

I use almond flour instead of ground almonds. Must sift it for it to work correctly. I piped them onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. The trick is and I haven't seen it listed is to gently drop the cookie sheet onto your counter. This knocks out any air bubbles and makes your batter set. Mine turned out beautifully. Tricky cookie but oh so worth it!

OMG, thank you. I make Macarons every year for my friend's birthday. The recipe I used before worked... 65% of the time I'd say. I always ended up with at least 3 trays of wasted cookie shells. This year, I decided to try a new one and chose this because it also made a smaller amount. I followed the recipe exactly (using weights) the only difference is I used parchment paper. My only *small* gripe was that my macarons didn't develop very tall feet, but whatever - I don't care. I did have a couple crack, that was on the tray that I had more on, so I suspect they were just too close together? Moisture?  Cookies slid right off the parchment paper (I always had issues with sticking before), and absolutely NO browning. woo hoo! Also, because it was a smaller recipe, my kitchen wasn't as big of a disaster as it usually is after making these.  :) This is now my go to recipe, and because it wasn't a giant pain in my a**, I may even make it more than once a year!

It took a lot for me to decide to attempt to make a macaron. I watched countless amounts of youtube videos on macaron  recipes and finally decided to follow this one. What I liked about this particular recipe was the simplicity and clear directions. I had perfect macaron on my very first try and I could not be more thrilled about it. The key to this recipe or to making macaron in general is that the ingredients must be measured using a kitchen scale. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. Although this recipe says 3 eggs, it took 2 eggs for me to get 100g. It also took me 30 strokes to mix the dry ingredients with egg white mixture perfectly. I left the uncooked cookies on the counter for exactly 1 hour and then i baked them for exactly 10 min. I did rotate the tray at 5 min though. Thank you so much for giving us the perfect macaron recipe!!! I feel like such a pro baker...
