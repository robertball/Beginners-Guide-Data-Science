Everyone liked this! I did cut the butter in half and still had plenty of sauce - maybe it depends on the size chicken pieces you're using (I cooked drumsticks).  I followed the advice of another reviewer and turned the oven up to 375 for the last 15 minutes to brown the chicken more.

Excellent!!  Very moist and full of flavor!! This is one recipe that I will make over and over again.  The sauce is wonderful!!  I turned the oven up to 375 degrees the last l5 minutes of bake time, just enough to brown the top of the chicken. Top with sauce when serving.  Great with baked potatoes.  Very easy and quick recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I also used chicken breasts for this one.  I felt the sauce was a little too thin and could have used more flavor.  If I did this one again, I might brown the chicken and add a mixture of cornstarch and water to the sauce to give it more consistency.

I prepared the butter, onion, honey, almonds and lemon on the stove-top as directed and poured it over my frozen chicken breasts until they reached room temperature.  Then baked as directed.  BOY was this an awesome dish!  Juicy, tender, and comforting.  I'll definitely make this again and I won't hesitate making it for guests.  Thanks CRAFTYGIRL!

A wonderful dish. My girlfriend and I prepared this meal for 13 people and not one of them stopped eating until their belts were loosened. Bravo. Try adding some shaved lemon peel to it.

This is definitely a tasty, simple dish.  I made half the sauce with two chicken breasts cut in half.  Because they were breasts, not thick pieces of chicken, I only cooked it for a half hour total, and they were perfect.  I halved the butter and mixed in a Tbsp of cornstarch with the lemon juice before adding and that helped thicken it up a little, but I'll add more cornstarch next time.  I think the sauce was really good.  Next time I'll cut up the chicken in pieces, brown them and cook them on the stove and just addd the sauce to the chicken pieces, serve it over rice, and call it lemon chicken.  :)  I think that's a more suitable name for the flavor, but whatever you call it, it's good.

Can't get much easier than this.  Great flavor.  We were very pleased with this.  Reheated well the next day, too.  We will definitely make this again!

We weren't crazy about this one.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either.  It was easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I did use chicken breasts, instead of bone-in chicken - but that was the only change I made.  The 1/2 cup of butter made it fairly greasy, and the sauce was so thin, it just didn't do much for the chicken.  I probably won't be making it again.

This recipe was prefect!  It really appealed to me because of its simplicity and ease of prep.  Just what you need on a busy day or a tight budget.  I shared the recipe with co-workers.

I browned one chicken and used the leavings from that to make the sauce. I added Louisiana wing sauce, some orange marmalade, lemon pepper seasoning and flour to this..this is a partial recipe from orange Asian chicken sauce to give the sauce a bit more taste for me and my family.

i loved it! i used boneless skinless chicken breast instead and i doubled the sauce recipe. i also reccomend cutting the chicken in half when putting in the oven. dont expect it to brown though... lemon juice prevents it from doing that and if you try it will overcook. anyway it was very tender and moist and if you give yourself enogh time its perfect for dinner parties or casual dinners.

Pretty good, but heavy on the onion! I followed other people's advice and cut down the butter, but next time I think I will also cut down on the onion and the lemon juice. Otherwise, not bad!

With my changes it was great. I was going to just put some chicken in the oven but decide to check here for a recipe.  The chicken was already seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder when I decided to make this recipe.   I double the recipe; I added the zest of one lemon plus the juice, and one clove of chopped garlic.  I too will reduce the amount of butter by half it was too much. I will make again exactly like l made it this time.  It seems like the chicken would be very bland without the changes.

This recipe was a complete disappointment.The chicken was dry and the smell from the sauce actually made me neauseous. The only adjustment I made was to half the reccomended amount of butter as this is what many other suggested. I will never be making this again.

Nice recipe, would be company-worthy. The day-old left overs were maybe even tastier!  Following reviewers' suggestions, I only used 1/4 cup butter and that was definitely plenty, even for my very large onion.

Nice subtle tasting chicken recipe.  Very easy to prepare.  I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and followed other reviews by using a little less butter and setting oven to 375 near the end of baking time.  Will be making this again.

I gave it three stars because it was very moist, but taste-wise it was missing something. I also added french fried onions about 5 min. before the end of baking time and only baked it for 30 min. The sauce is a bit bland, I probably won't make it again

I also cut down the butter by a lot, used chicken breasts, and added one golden delicious apple to the recipe.  It was a tasty dish, but I would imagine the dish being bland if it did not have the apple in it.  I also think the sauce was enough, even with a couple tablespoons of butter, but that could be because I used really good honey--which may make a difference, I am not sure.  I served it with brown rice in which I added some sage and raisins!

I have made this recipe several many times. It is always a light, summer version of chicken. Better with bone-in dark meat, but it works with my family's favorite: boneless white chicken breasts (I recommend using 3 large breasts). Other reviewers have been disappointment by the amount of work for a subtle flavor. Honestly, I have made it both ways, and there is no need to saute the onions first, you can mix all the ingredients (even cut the onion into large slices if you only want the flavor and take them out after baking) and put it in the oven with almonds on top.  It is a watery sauce, so it is best served with rice or mashed potatoes to sop up some of that nice light flavor.

Loved the sauce, although it was really thin.  Next time I think I'll make this with rice and chopped chicken instead.  It also needed more almonds.

Truthful Tasty! Used only  1/2 the butter amount.  In a fry pan I browned chicken breast that were pounded thin. Took chicken out added other ingredients to pan (scrapping brown bits on bottom of pan).  Added chicken back to pan after glaze was finished.

Used this recipe to re-create my fiance's favorite dish from our favorite restaurant. I add it to pasta (usually penne) with a homemade cream sauce with a hint of honey.

Always looking for new things to do with chicken breasts. This was good, but I wasn't blown away. I thought the recipe called for way too much onion. Will definitely do less onion next time. Otherwise, simple and sweet.

Very easy and quick. But not much flavor.

I did not care for this recipe. The sauce was thin and had little flavor. The chicken skin did not brown but the almonds and onions on the skin burned. I would not make this again.

I made this recipe using chicken breasts and it was fantastic, I cooked it for a group of 13 and tripled the recipe(but used a little less honey), to thicken the sauce I added extra almonds and I had great responses from my guests, great recipe, will definitely cook it again.

The sauce is quite thin and has a very subtle flavor.  Personally, we would prefer a thicker sauce.

This was tasty. Quick and easy to put together. Only thing I changed was to cut down the lemon juice just a little bit because hubby is never to thrilled with lemon juice on chicken. Thanks!

This was fine.  Very moist, but also pretty bland.  I would not make again.

The chicken is very moist, but not what I was expecting. Thanks for letting me try it.

This did not turn out well at all for me.  I used chicken breasts and they got very dry and chewy--I think 1 hour was too long to bake!  I agree that the sauce was greasy (and I even used less butter) and didn't have much flavor.  I don't recommend this.  Sorry.

Was as expected -- moist and mildly flavored chicken. Was looking for just that -- something with just a little flavor, but not too much, as I was serving it with tortellini in a brown-butter sage sauce, which had enough flavor and aroma to carry the meal. Chicken was good and moist. Turned up heat toward end to get it to brown a bit. Was a lot of prep for not much return, though, so I probably wouldn't make it a staple.

Very good recipe, I used chicken breasts instead of bone-in chicken. Turned out very good!
