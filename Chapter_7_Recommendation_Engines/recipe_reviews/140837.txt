I have been searching for a light whipped frosting that will hold up without refrigeration.  THIS IS IT!!  Delicious, light, and sturdy.  I decorated a cake and left it at room temp overnight just to see, and it was still perfect the next morning.  Also tried a chocolate variation by adding a little cocoa with the sugar.  That too, turned out beautifully.  Thanks!

**Please read this review if you had trouble with this recipe or are new at baking! 
This recipe is good but has flaws with the method. Heavy cream (or heavy whipping cream) CAN'T be beaten into the peak stage with any presence of fat or grease in the bowl or on the beaters- it won't whip. This is why many recipes will specifically say "start with clean bowl and beaters". So pouring the heavy cream into a big bowl of fat (cream cheese) will most likely end up with a broken mess.  

The cream needs to be beat to stiff peaks FIRST & separately. I also would suggest adding 1 tsp of cream of tartar to the cream to help stabilize it. Place cream, cream of tartar in CLEAN bowl (I always use stainless steel one when whipping cream) and clean beaters into the fridge to chill. After it's chilled whip it to stiff peaks then place back in fridge while you do the other part. 

Beat the cream cheese, extract, sugar (I used powdered sugar to again help with keeping it stiff) and I added orange zest, so its combined. Then I added about 1/3 of the whipped cream to the cream cheese and gently folded it together, then I added the remaining whipped cream.  Folding a smaller amount first lets things mix better and requires less folding/mixing in the end. 

The taste was great! Still the great tang from the cream cheese (although subdued a tad) but not overly sweet as cream cheese frosting can be. It piped well for me using this method!

I was asked to make a wedding cake for a friend on which the frosting was not too sweet. She absolutely loved the flavour. As for sturdiness, I added a package of gelatine powder just before decorating as the cake would be sitting in the fridge overnight, and out on a table for a few hours. Definately a good alternative to supersweet buttercream.

I just served this frosting on my baby boy's first birthday cake. It was a BIG hit, and in my book is perfect--thicker than whip cream frosting and lighter than buttercreme. A great fresh flavor and not too sweet. I used full-fat cream cheese because the store i went to didn't have reduced fat. This will become my standard frosting.

This is my second update:  PLEASE NOTE: I submitted this recipe and want to make sure that people understand what it is and what it isn't.  This is frosting -- it's NOT meant to be piped like buttercream icing.  If you can get it to the consistency that will pipe -- great -- but my own experience is that it will probably "break" if beaten that much. Secondly, my comment about "leaving it out" doesn't mean to leave it out overnight or for a long period of time -- dairy shouldn't be left out long term, as many reviewers have noted.  The comment was meant to compare this frosting to standard whipped cream frosting which starts to "fade" very quickly and can be problematic.  If you're set on trying to use this as decoration instead of just the frosting I meant it as, you may want to try adding some Confectioners (XXX or 10X) sugar. That should help to stiffen it . Also, using chilled beaters and bowls is always a good idea when working with dairy. Hope you enjoy!  Happy baking!

I made this recipe for my daughter's Strawberry Birthday cake.  My husband loves buttercream frosting (super sweet) while I prefer a light whipped cream frosting (not too sweet).  By adding more sugar and using more vanilla instead of the almond extract (we don't care for that flavor) it was the perfect!  Without the extra sugar and vanilla (minus the almond extract) it tasted too much like cream cheese, so I just kept adding sugar and vanilla until I got the flavor I was looking for.

This turned out great! It whipped up nice and fast, was fluffy and held up nicely. The only change I made was that instead of almond extract I used lemon extract. You could use any flavor you'd want with great results, Im sure. I will definitely be using this recipe again! :)

Easy, great flavor, and fairly sturdy.  It didn't melt, but it wasn't the best for piping.  When piped, the details didn't come out as sharply as buttercream.  I had to add a package of whipped cream stabilizer to stiffen it up some more.  However, this would work fine as is for regular icing.  I also wouldn't let this sit out for hours because it still has cream cheese and cream, which can spoil if left out too long.

This is and EXCELLENT whipped cream Frosting!! The texture is very stable and the taste is heavenly! I used a hand mixer with regular beaters,full fat cream cheese and granulated sugar. It was a cinch to make. I put in a few drops of green dye and it was a big hit at my St.Paddy's party! Thank you Jo-Lynn! This will be my cake icing forever!

Not sturdy. And, as others have commented, because you wait and expect it will GET sturdy, you keep on whipping... and then it collapses.  The taste isn't even all that great either - not sweet enough and too much tang from the cream cheese, so I added another 1/4 cup of sugar.  While this was a definite improvement in the taste, it of course did nothing to help make this frosting live up to its name.  I had intended to pipe this to decorate my cake, but that wasn't EVEN about to happen with this frosting.

This whipped cream frosting is AMAZING! I have received so many compliments on it that I haven't used another frosting since. I have done this countless of times and have never had a problem with it being runny or lumpy. 

Here's what you do! 
THIS IS CRUCIAL: Freeze your mixing bowl (preferably metal) and your whisks for at least a half hour prior to starting this process. (You can even freeze the heavy cream for about 10 minutes before starting.)

Make sure the cream cheese is soft and at or close to room temperature (soft enough that you can easily smush it with the back of a spoon). 
Using a mixer, I blend the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract until it is all blended, soft, and creamy. 

I then switch up to the highest speed of the hand mixer while slowly pouring the heavy cream into the bowl. Make sure to use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl once or twice. Once the heavy cream is fully incorporated into the cream cheese mixture, I continue mixing at the highest speed, but move the hand mixer in a quick, circular motion (this gets even more air into your frosting.) 

Use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom and continue with the high speed and circular motion until the frosting gets thick. When the frosting has stiff peaks (meaning a peak can stand on its own and won't fall over), you are DONE! :)

It holds up so well in room temperature and tastes absolutely delicious, especially with chocolate cake, so don't give up on this!

This was really good! I just made it for my son's birthday cupcakes and it was so easy and not too sweet. Instead of using a mixer, I used my food processor (chopping blade) and it was nearly done by the time I finished pouring the cream in! The processor really cut the time down and is powerful enough to turn your cream into butter, so don't let it go too long!

We used this frosting on the American Flag cake made with blueberries and strawberries.  We also used original cream cheese because that was what was on hand.  We took it to a BBQ and everyone wanted the recipe!  VERY sturdy compared to other whipped cream frosting recipes.  My husband who used to be the cake decorator at our local Safeway was VERY impressed.  I would use it as a dip for fruit as suggested also, YUMMY!!!

Fabulous flavor that very light - however I did this a bit differently.... I used full fat cream cheese and used all vanilla extract. I whippped that together in my stand mixer and put that in a separate bowl and chilled it. I cleaned out the stand mixer bowl and chilled it in the freezer for 10 minutes then whippped the heavy cream until it formed stiff peaks. I then gently folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Overall, very good.

I had to try three times to get this recipe right.  The first two times I had soup - it tasted good, but wasn't what I was going for.  Here is what I did to solve the problem - I whipped the heavy cream first. I had to be pretty patient with this - it took longer than I thought.  In a different bowl I mixed the other ingredients.  Then I mixed the two together.  Worked out perfectly.  The frosting was sturdy even in high humidity.  I was so impressed I joined allrecipes just so I could write a review.

OK as a fruit dip but a bit tangy from the cream cheese. I'd use it on a 9x13 cake with berries but not on other cakes. Not what I was looking for in a whipped cream frosting.

This was an excellent frosting that held up well to travel - several hours out of refrigeration.  It tasted lovely and had just the "right" texture.  I did add 1/4 t. cornstarch and subbed the almond extract for strawberry and used powdered sugar (instead of regular).  Tip:  Using chilled bowls and beaters and extra cold whipping cream (30 minutes in the freezer) whip the cream and cornstarch until stiff peaks.  In a separate bowl, mix all the other ingredients and then gently fold the two together and the texture is wonderful.  I have a cheap hand mixer only and that worked to form stiff peaks fairly quickly for me because it was so cold.  In the end, using a taste test, I actually only used 1 1/2 cups of the heavy cream (yeah, saved some calories) but it still tasted excellent.  I paired with Heavenly Angel Food Cake (from this site) and made a layer in the middle with frosting and strawberries and then topped with more frosting and berries.  My nieces were delighted with their birthday treat!

I whipped the cream separately and then added it to the already combined cream cheese,sugar and flavoring mixtures. It works much better this way, it's much thicker and a better consistency, than just adding the cream to it as instructed.

So I read most of the reviews and some were very helpful. It's clear that majority get this right and assume everyone has the expertise. I've never had to whip cream so some of the terminologies were confusing. Firstly, the recipe calls for white sugar. Most people say confectioner's sugar when referring to ingredients for frosting. I assumed white sugar was granulated sugar and it worked perfectly.

I have to say though, there were one or two mentions about this and I wasn't sure who to go with when I read the reviews but I have to admit I only read the reviews after I thought it had gone wrong.

I did exactly as the recipe stated. I'm in the UK though so I used extra thick cream as could not find heavy cream. I also used a hand mixer as that's all I use. I'd made a cake with my mixer and washed up my whisks and glass mixing bowl with hot water as its winter. I don't know if this affected my whisking as it all became very runny, like single cream! I was convinced I would have to chuck it away and start again but I just kept it in the fridge overnight in a jug and then read all the reviews. 

In the morning, I put my glass mixing bowl and whisks in the freezer for 30 mins as advised by some of the reviewers. I then whisked straight for about 5 mins and the consistency was brilliant even for piping!

I would advise to not give up, try this, it's a keeper. I used this on the creamy coconut cake on this website and everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing. Hope this helps x

This was great! It made my cupcakes taste even better with this whipping cream frosting. Just loved it! A heads up for others out there just in case. When it says to pour the heavy cream slowly, it definitely means sssllooooowwwwlllllyyyy. I made the mistake of pouring it all at once and it became a liquid texture. Did it the right way the second time and of course it was perfect then. So ya, hope this helped!

Apparently they didn't mention you can over whip this. If you whip it to make it stiffer it curdles and then you have to throw it out.  (P.s. I've been a decorator for 14 years... I am very dissapointed to say the least!)

This turned out fantastic!  Here's what I did (steps changed slightly per posted suggestions and needs):

1. beat the slightly softened cream cheese (I used full-fat...why not, I'm using heavy cream after all), extracts (I used vanilla and raspbery), and sugar (I used powdered).
2. separately whip the heavy cream (and I added a tsp of cream of tartar) to stiff peaks (if you beat it too far, add a little more cream and whip slowly until it is incorporated; repeat until it is back to the desired consistency. also add a little more sugar to balance).  I put the heavy cream, mixing bowl and beater in the freezer for 30 minutes before starting.
3. Fold the two mixtures together

You can really use any extract flavor to this recipe...I also added 2/3 cup of raspberry jam to step 1.  The texture and taste were fantastic!  I piped this raspberry cream frosting onto my cupcakes (chocolate cake w/ raspberry jam filling) with a pastry bag and large star tip.
It seemed very sturdy and kept it's shape and texture while on my counter for hours.
In an air tight containter, it has kept well in the fridge for 3 days (thus far).  However, when I refridgerated my cupcakes in their bakery boxes (not air-tight) the frosting did not have as fluffy a texture when thawed (yet were definitely still delicious!).  I also froze one in a zip-lock baggie to see if it would work...I will report back when I thaw (and taste test).

I highly recommend this frosting! It tastes divine and is quite sturdy!

I try so very hard to not give low ratings. :-( This turned out just awful for me! Like others, my frosting is not stable at all - not even close! I think if I'd have whipped it any more, it might have turned to butter - it got to stiff peaks - but after it sits for literally 30 seconds, it's soft and won't hold its shape again. I started with ice cold cream - had it in the freezer for 20 minutes before I began - and ice cold bowl and beaters. Room temperature cream cheese. The flavor is alright, but really quite bitter for some reason. New cream cheese, new cream. IF I were to make this again, which I just can't imagine doing, I'd add at least a cup of powdered sugar to the finished frosting to help give it some body; otherwise, I have cupcakes literally dripping with frosting. I honestly don't even think it would do well on a sheet cake. :-( I have no clue how those who took pictures of this frosting actually have any height...

I really wish that I had read the reviews based on ratings:(.  If you check the ratings from lowest to highest, I know I am not the only one who had a soft liquidy frosting. All my utensils, KA bowl were chilled, too.
Not sure what happened here, but there is no way the frosting that resulted would have ever piped like the frosting in the picture.  About half the pictures show defined piping, the other half look super soft and like cool whip.  I had to scrap the whole thing since I was looking for a stable frosting to pipe rosettes onto red velvet.  Flavor was good and rich, though.

Perhaps an unfair rating, but I don't want others to be fooled by the name like I was. I thought I was going to get an icing that I could ice & decorate a cake with just like the bakeries use.  WRONG!  I could never get this past a Cool Whip consistency.  I ended up over beating it which caused the cream to fall.  This recipe is basically a rich and heavy cool whip that tastes great, but it is not a "sturdy frosting."

I read a few pages of reviews and don't understand why people are having trouble with this frosting.  No, it's not stiff enough to pipe, but I wouldn't expect it to be without a stabilizer of some sort.  And no, somebody got confused between cream and egg whites--cream has enough fat in it that everything does NOT need to be spotless (though clean is always a good idea), and cream of tartar has nothing to do with cream, either.  It's truly no-fail, though!  I let my regular cream cheese sit in my steel bowl for maybe 1/2 hour--not long enough to soften much, but enough to be able to beat in the sugar & extracts.  Once that was a little fluffy, I added all of the cream at once (straight out of the refrigerator) and beat with my hand mixer, starting on low to mix everything well, then went to high for maybe a minute and I had lovely stiff peaks.  It tastes great on strawberry cake, and I bet it'd be good on any cake that has enough of its own flavor--I wouldn't try it on a white or yellow cake.  It has a very mild cream cheese flavor.  I think that the addition of almond extract tones it down some, so if you use just vanilla, you'll taste the cream cheese more.

I used regular cream cheese, followed recipe and it turned out really good.  It was light and fluffy, yet sturdy enough to ice a three tier cake with.  I really loved the flavor of it and will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I have made this twice in the last 2 days!!  The first I made as is, with the slight sub of omitting the almond extract and adding extra vanilla.  This was for a carrot cake, so YUMMY!  Then I made it again for a chocolate cake, subbing strawberry extract for almond and adding 2 tbls. of unsweetened cocoa!  FANTASTIC!!  Will be making over and over and over again.  Note to anyone who finds it runny, you didn't whip it long enough!!  I got nervous the first time I made it, but kept whipping and it ended up perfect!!!!

Okay, I must admit I was VERY nervous about making this frosting for my husband's birthday cake. I read through the majority of the reviews and became more and more concerned about whether or not the recipe was going to work out! But I'm happy to report it was SO easy! I did make a few changes based on what I read in the reviews: 
1) I used mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese to avoid the cream cheese flavour; 
2) I used icing sugar instead of regular white sugar; 
3) I chilled my Kitchen Aid bowl and whisk in the freezer for an hour before; 
4) I chilled the cream in the freezer for 20 minutes prior; 
5) I added in half a packet of gelatine but I honestly don't think I even needed it. 

It turned out amazing! Fabulous flavour and so creamy and spreadable. Very sturdy.

Very delicious! love the hint of cream cheese. If you are using it to decorate with, only whip til it holds shape, be careful not to over whip, it breaks down and gets runny. Made this for mothers day, I like how it has all the flavor and alot less sugar than traditional frosting! Will definantly make this one again!

So yummy, like pure whipped cream.  I used it on pumpkin cake.  
I used cream cheese that was not reduced fat.  I used a little more sugar (to taste) and no almond extract, but a little more vanilla. After I whipped the cream cheese and sugar, etc, it was too warm, a little more than room temperature, so I put it in the frig for about 30 minutes or so, so that it was still soft but cold.  I whipped it some more then added the 2 cups of very heavy cream and whipped it until stiff.  Soooooo good!  I think maybe those who have problems with the recipe are letting some part of the recipe get warm and the chemistry of the whole thing goes to soup.  Just an educated guess.  Hope this helps.

My first review but couldn't resist sharing how AWESOME this frosting was for my daughter's "Dirt n' Worms" birthday cupcakes. DON'T BE AFRAID IF YOUR A BAKING NOVICE! I'm not the best baker but followed feedback from the reviews. My tips:

1)  Chilled my KA bowl and whisk in the freezer for about 30 minutes.
2) Chilled the heavy cream for about 15 minutes. 
3) For CHOCOLATE frosting, I added about 1/2 c. cocoa powder and 1/4 c. confectioner's sugar (in addition to the granulated sugar in recipe). 
4) Used reg. cream cheese.

It was light and creamy and if I could bathe in it I think I would. Enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it never became stiff! It was just a cream cheese puddle. I tried saving it with powder sugar, but it never became stiff. A waste of money and time. Never again.

I just made this whipped frosting and although I was skeptical (first time using my stand mixer!), the results were great, fast and delicious! Thank you, Jo! 

1) CHILL YOUR MIXING BOWL FIRST in the freezer before using. This allows the metal to keep your fats cool while whisking at a high enough speed to not liquify. 
2) To make a stiffer frosting - a very simple adjustment is all you need: Use only 1/2 cup of white sugar (rather than 1 whole cup as the recipe states) and 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar/powdered sugar. I literally took my cup measure, poured in the white sugar about halfway and filled the balance with the powdered sugar and then followed the directions as normal. This gave me the stiffness I wanted without changing any flavors or adding anything else AKA easy peasy. 

SO: STIFFER VERSION OF THIS WHIPPED TOPPING = 1/2 CUP WHITE SUGAR & 1/2 CUP CONFECTIONERS SUGAR

Perfect. Not to sweet. So simple to make. I double this recipe, tossed in two envelopes of unflavored gelatin to stabilize for an evening event. Tinted light pink. My chocolate cake was a 14 inch round cake filled with raspberry creme filling. I don't know what the fuss is, I refrigerated my metal bowl and beaters which I think is essential.  I also added a few drops of raspberry liquor.  Once you make this, you won't make another frosting for a cake.   As for it falling, honestly, I have to wonder if someone is using a plastic bowl. I have leftovers and spooned this frosting between graham crackers and tossed in freezer for a frozen treat.

This icing is simply delicious!  However, it was not as "sturdy" as I had hoped.  Perhaps because I was using a hand mixer instead of the "whisk attachment" mentioned.  I will try this again, but will use a chilled bowl, beaters, and won't soften the cream cheese as much as I did.  I do have to say that my daughter and nephew completely ignored my cake, and just licked the frosting off!

This recipe gets ONE star, only because the flavor was decent. It was NO WHERE near sturdy - more like a pudding than frosting. Such a let-down.

This is a great recipe!  Highly recommended doing it my way though.  I noticed mention of the "tang" of cream cheese turning people off but the cure for that is using mascarpone cheese. Mascarpone is Italian triple-cream cheese and has a smoother texture than regular cream cheese and is pretty bland so it doesn't have that tang. I used this recipe using mascarpone for our cannoli cake to keep it more Italian and it turned out perfect and not too sweet!  Also, using mascarpone really allows the flavorings/ extracts to be more noticeable!  This will be my go to frosting using mascarpone from now on.

I love love love this! I have made it about 3 times. 2 times were unsuccessful... :( But today was awesome! I followed the suggestions of other reviews. I chilled my mixing bowl and beaters. I used 2 packets of whip it stabilizer, whipped the cream separately and set aside while I combined the other ingredients. Then mixed the everything together. I think next time I will use cherry extract for cordial cupcakes.. mmmm :)

Great taste as a dip perhaps, but as a fr osting, I never got it to form stiff peaks and the more I beat it, it seemed to separate. I even put in in my food processor to no avail, just got creamy, which made me think it would make a great fruit dip.  Taste was yummy, but not something I could frost my cake.  Darn!  Don't know what else I could have done. Was really disappointed as I really thought this would be perfect on my son's sheet cake.

I pretty much became an AllRecipes member just so I could review this recipe.  I make several different frosting recipes and this has become my new favorite.  Now, the first time I made it, it wasn't perfect.  I used granulated sugar and didn't whip it long enough and had a gloopy mess on my cupcakes.  So, after reading some of the reviews, I added some powdered sugar and whipped it some more.  Perfection!  

Now I know just to use all powdered sugar (I use a heavy cup).  I also chill the HEAVY whipping cream in the freezer for several minutes beforehand.  I tend not to chill my bowl because it makes it difficult to cream the (full-fat) cream cheese and sugar together.  I then make sure to pour the whipping cream in very slowly and to whip it long enough (between 1 - 2 minutes with my KitchenAid on high).  I also use all vanilla extract and omit the almond.  

As per suggestions from other reviewers, I've even made this with mascarpone cheese when I didn't want the tang of the cream cheese and it makes the perfect sturdy whipped cream frosting for cakes and cupcakes.  

So, if at first you don't succeed, please try, try again because this recipe is definitely worth getting right.  :)

ETA:  I just made a lemon version of this that was divine.  Instead of the extracts, I added 5 Tablespoons of fresh lemon juice -- btw, tried it with lemon extract.  Trust me, go with the lemon juice instead.  Other than using 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, all other ingredients were the same.

This is the recipe I have been searching for!  I love the lightness of whipped frosting  and  the sturdiness of cream cheese frosting--this is the perfect marriage of the two.  I used my trusty old electric hand mixer and made a lemon version for my son's lemon birthday cake by omitting the almond extract and adding the juice of half a lemon and about a teaspoon or so of dried lemon peel granules.  I'll add more lemon juice next time as it was only lightly lemony.  I actually halved the sugar and doubled the recipe and it came out perfect for our tastes.  I generously frosted 2 9-in. stacked cakes (using it as the middle layer as well)  and had some left over for cupcakes.  It did hold up well sitting on the table in a warm kitchen and everyone raved that it was the best frosting they had ever eaten!  This will be my standard frosting recipe from now on.

I don't know what's going on with this recipe. I tried it twice and it still comes out looking like watery cottage cheese. The first time I will admit that I probably added the whipping cream too fast but the second time I followed the directions to a T and poured the whipping cream veeeery slow. Still cottage cheese.

Good recipe as an alternative to cream cheese frosting especially if you are looking for a consistancy that is light and fluffy.  The taste of the cream cheese does come through so I have used 1 cup of confectioners sugar in place of the 1/2 cup granulated sugar with better taste results. It works well with red velvet and carrot cakes and as a topping over cheesecakes. It is somewhat sturdier than whipped cream alone but I recommend the addition of 2Tbs piping gel if you plan on decorating the day before serving. It will hold up much better and for much longer.

Not sturdy at all.  Soupy is more like it.  So disappointed as this recipe was recommended to me.  Tasted good, but was worthless.

I made this today to try it out for a cake order this weekend. The taste/texture is wonderful. My question is how far in advance can I make it and let it sit in the fridge before covering my cake??

I have not tried this recipe yet but I am commenting on the fact people are saying it can be left out at room temp.  Anything with heavy cream must be refridgerated or you are asking for trouble. People are going to get sick.

This was wonderful! Made this for my daughter's cupcakes. I admit I was afraid to try this since baking is not my forte. The 1-3 star reviews almost scared me away but I read through the rest for tips and have to say thank you to everyone who was successful! I had ZERO problems making this icing and it tasted like cool whip! Here is what i did, and if I can do it, ANYONE at any level can do this:
Heavy whipping cream. Pretty sure this is a must
I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese
I ended up chilling the metal bowl and mixer blades overnight since I was afraid the icing would collapse. 
Confectioners sugar (not sure if this is a must but other cream cheese icing recipes call for confectioners so I decided to stick with it). 
I creamed the cream cheese, sugar and extracts in a separate bowl first. I put the heavy whipping cream in the chilled mixing bowl in the freezer as I worked on the cream cheese part of the recipe. Then I cleaned off the mixer blades (I am not fancy and only have a 3-speed hand mixer) and brought the chilled bowl out of the freezer and whipped the heavy cream to a cool whip consistency. I "folded" the cream cheese into the bowl with the whipped cream, and I use the term "folded" very loosely here since it wasn't combing the way I wanted it to, so I took the hand mixer to it at the lowest speed to combine. I was able to get this light, fluffy icing into my piping bag with a large star tip and it went onto the cupcakes very easily. The icing never fell, it kept

I just made this...it's chilling in the fridge until my cake is cool. It is soooo good! I used 1 cup of confectioners sugar and omitted the almond extract. I also froze my bowl and whisk attachment. Once I added the cream, it was the perfect consistency in about 3 minutes. I will be able to pipe this for a border on my cake. The taste is PERFECT...not too sweet, even though I added extra sugar and it's so smooth. This will be my go to frosting recipe from now on!

This is a GREAT recipe***Helpful Hints**** Use cold cream cheese right from the fridge. Soften cold cream cheese along with sugar and extract in the mixer first before adding the heavy whipping cream. Slowly add the heavy whipping cream and stop mixer frequently to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate the ingredients. Pay attention to the consistency. Keep mixing until the frosting does not drip off of the mixer whisk. Just be careful to not over mix and turn it into butter! Hope this helps!

My only complaint about this frosting is that it was not very sturdy! I made it exactly as directed and took it to a BBQ. I left my cupcakes inside the house but even so, they melted. The flavor is very good and the almond flavor is very noticeable (if you don't like that flavor, scale it back or leave it out). The next time I make this, I will try using regular cream cheese instead of the reduced fat-- I think the red. fat cream cheese gives it a 'tangy' flavor. Overall, this frosting is very good.

Very good cream frosting!  Not sure what all the fuss is about regarding the difficulty in making this... pretty straight forward.  It's definitely a detour from heavily sweetened buttercreams, but a pleasant one.

If *cream cheese* was in the name, I'd rate it a 5.   Here's the deal....whipped cream frosting tastes good with almost ALL cake flavors, however, cream cheese does not.  It did not work on my butter cake today.    It has a distinct tart flavor from the cream cheese.  I knew it was too good to be true.  Its just another cream cheese frosting recipe but a VERY GOOD cream cheese frosting! ETA; The name is deceiving.  Most people are looking for a light sweet frosting…this is cream cheese…. COMING back again to use for a cake that I'm wanting a cream cheese frosting.   It is an excellent cream cheese frosting.  I did not have problems with over whipping and it being too thin.

I see the problem some people had. I softened my cream cheese in the microwave and as a result I couldn't get my cream to whip up (and I've made fresh whipped cream more time than I could count), it was runny and kinda clotted so I tossed it and started over. ring the cream cheese to room temp on the counter and whip it in after you whipped your cream. I still wouldn't leave it out over night because its dairy and just unsafe. I made this to go with hummingbird cake off of this site. It didn't work for piping... at all as you will be able to see from the pics so learn from me and just don't bother to try.

great frosting, if I would have used it for frosting?  this is unbelievable, so light and wonderful.  I used some of it (added a few dashes of ground cinnamon) as a fruit dip with sliced bananas (friends said it tasted like banana bread with cream cheese) and the rest was dipped with chocolate covered strawberries.. absolutely sinful!

I've used this recipe for the flag cake (also on this site) a couple times and it's the bomb!  Exactly what I was looking for and I thought it piped out beautifully.  I love the ease of the recipe and it's never been temperamental or fussy.  The cream goes in, the mixer whips it and, voila!, beautiful.  Make chocolate by adding in about 1/3 cup cocoa powder.  This would be good filling for cream puffs or cream horns, too.  It's a versatile filling.  Thanks, Jo-Lynn!

YUM! I am a huge fan of whipped cream, and cream cheese, and this frosting tastes fresh and delicious and not too sweet. I really wanted something in between frosting and whipped cream, so I cut the cream cheese amount in half and followed everything else on the recipe. The results were heavenly...

Best. Frosting. EVER! This truly is epic frosting. I made Jell-o poke cupcakes in a variety of flavors for Easter and decided on trying this frosting since half of my family loves whipped cream frosting and the other loves cream cheese frosting (and I needed something sturdy enough to hold up for a 45 minute drive). This frosting not only made the drive, but it got RAVE reviews! We ended up having enough to frost some of my sister's sugar cookies and it was delicious on those as well. I don't want to forget to mention how great this tastes on fresh fruit, too! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I will use this frosting for the rest of my life! One tip: Unless you have clear vanilla extract for this recipe, plan on at least tinting your frosting a little bit to offset the brownish tint that comes from regular vanilla extract. Enjoy!

Waaaay better than buttercream. This was one of THE best frostings I've had in a long time. It has the light texture and taste of the whipped cream frosting from the bakery I buy my cupcakes and cakes at. It's very easy to use through a piping bag and frosting tip. I will never use a different frosting recipe again.

I am giving two stars because there is a very real possibility that I did something to screw this up, but I followed the original recipe exactly and got something the consistency of loose foam that did not "set up" or even form peaks.

It does seem sturdy but I think it's to bland..I think I'm going to try a strawberry gelatin next time to add flavor..But if you like something light and nothing over the top this is the recipe for you..I used this on top of white cupcakes.

Somebody help maybe? I made this twice and could not get peaks to form. The first time it completely separated on me -- is the cream cheese holding the heavy cream down from forming whipped cream (i.e. being too heavy for the air to be held by the cream)? Everyone else is giving this rave reviews, I don't understand.

Cream cheese is definitely a very prevalent flavor in this... not 100% what I was looking for...would be fantastic on something fruit-based. As many previous reviews state- not a replacement for buttercream texture, much softer, but should hold for a basic frosting job.

WOW. WOW. WOW.  I love this frosting, BUT I feel that I have to mention that I tried this the first time as directed and it came out a little too liquidy and too 'salty'/cheese-tasting, which is ok normally, but it was too overwhelming the first time I made it.  Tonight, I cut the recipe in half (only frosting a couple of mini cakes) and used a tad bit more sugar as well as full-fat cream cheese/regular cream cheese.  It was PERFECT.  Not too salty or cheesy tasting. I also added 1 tsp of beet powder to dye it naturally PINK and it came out awesome!  NOTE: I think it also helped that I stuck the mixing bowl, whisk attachment and whipping cream in the freezer for 5-10 mins prior to starting the process.  Thank you for an incredible recipe!

Used this on a wedding cake when the bride requested a whipped filling with strawberries.  I had no room in the refrigerator.  It stood up beautifully overnight.  Everyone loved the flavor, too.  Thanks!

Very delicious whipped cream frosting. The cream cheese taste is barely noticeable and it piped fairly well for me. Of course, it's not buttercream, so you won't get the same definition with this recipe, but it was very workable and held up perfectly. Made a pretty and delicious addition to my cheesecake and did not compete with or overpower it.

The first time I made this the texture was almost there but not quite, the taste is way to creamcheesy, so I tried to alter the recipe the 2nd time and it didn't set at all, it was runny, and I ended up having to toss it, however, if I do decide to try this a third time and it turns out, I will update my rating :)

A little disappointed with this recipe since its rated really high. First, the almond taste was too strong for me. Second, the frosting was so runny, I had a hard time decorating my cake although it frosted the cake well but its not stiff enough for decoration. I chilled the heavy cream, beaters, bowls. I will try again but this time add stabilizer & dont add almond extract.

Absolutely the easiest and BEST whipped cream frosting I've ever made.  It will be my "go to" recipe.  NOTE:  I use a metal mixing bowl that has been placed in the freezer for 20-30 minutes.  The heavy cream should be very cold, NOT room temperature.

I had been looking for a whipped cream similar to what they use on restaraunt desserts. I think this is possibly very close. It holds it's shape, is pipable and has a good flavor. Not quite as good as some restaraunt whipped topping I have tried but I will use this until I find the "secret".

Love, love, love this frosting!  It is the PERFECT frosting for the "Strawberry Cake from Scratch" recipe from this site.  It's light and fluffy and not too sweet.  After adding all of the whipped cream, I turned my KA mixer on high and watched it turn into whipped cream (it always fascinates me).  I found the vanilla and almond flavors to be just right and not overpowering at all.  The cream cheese flavor is rather subtle as this frosting is more reminiscent of whipped cream, rather than cream cheese frosting.

I'm an avid cake maker/decorator, and this has become my absolute go to frosting when the cake doesn't need to sit out for too long. I did try this out months ago and it turned into a sloppy mess. I think it may have been because I left the cream cheese out to soften too long. I have since started beating it right out of the fridge. I whip it a bit longer so that it softens, but it still remains its integrity which helps to keep the frosting together. You just need to make sure you scrape down the sides several times so that you don't end up with chunks once you add the cream in.

This was awesome!  I made this frosting to top angel food cake cupcakes (found on this site as well) for my daughter's first birthday.  It was perfect... not too sweet, very light, which is exactly what I was looking for.  Definitely my new favorite frosting recipe!  And it is true, the end product holds up for hours without getting runny or breaking down.  I was skeptical but glad to be proven wrong!

This was perfect! I used whipping cream v. heavy cream (because I was out of heavy cream) Since the whipping cream is a bit lighter the cream cheese and whipping cream went well together. I will definitely make this frosting again. The taste was light to the pallet with a savory cream cheese taste.

Delicious!!  I added gel food coloring to color the frosting.  Also, I decided after the icing was made that it was not quite sweet enough for me so I added 1/2 cup confectioners sugar.  The icing was flavorful!!  Be forewarned, however, it is not sturdy enough for piped decorations.  I used this icing to frost the cake and added piped decorations with store bought vanilla icing.  So good!!!

This is good for fans of frosting that is not very sweet.  I never could get mine past the Cool Whip consistency like another reviewer.  It made a lot, that is a good part about this recipe.  There are better frosting recipes out there as far as I'm concerned.

I was baking cupcakes for my 4 year old daughter's Pre-K class as a way to celebrate her birthday. This was extremely delicious and easy to make. I needed a whipped cream topping that not too sweet for the "Angel Food Cupcakes" recipe, also from this site. I followed the recipe exactly except that I omitted the almond extract, just in case a child had allergies, and substituted an additional 1/2 tsp of vanilla. The serving for 12 covered 30 cupcakes comfortably. I added sprinkles and sugar glazed strawberries on top of the cupcakes and it was a huge hit! I did refrigerate the cupcakes overnight after the frosting was applied, and it held up well on the drive to school and throughout the morning until the party started. I will use this recipe again and again...

This recipe really performed as stated - not too sweet and held up well, even 2 days later!  I used this for the "sea" on my kids' pirate cake and only wished I'd added cocoa and used it for the chocolate "ship" too!  Will experiment with a chocolate version next time and also plan to try it with extra cream cheese for a sturdier, less sweet cream cheese frosting for carrot cake.  Excellent frosting - definitely a keeper!

If you want a sturdy whipped frosting just add 2 TBS of instant pudding vanilla powder I just add the powder after mixing all the ingredents . I also uset 1/4 of Truvia baking mix instead of sugar . Every one loved it and I think this was the best creamcheese frosting I ever had

Whew!! Words can't describe how nervous I was making this for a pink cupcake dress I offered to make for a good friends daughter's 1yr. old Bday party tomorrow. Yes..tomorrow! lol I have never made a whipped cream frosting!
After reading many reviews, I made sure everything was chilled. I even placed the miking bowl in a larger bowl of ice! 
Slowly pouring the heavy whipping cream, I felt less nervous. 
Long story short, I am now a huge fan of this frosting! Great tasting & fluffy as I hoped for! 
I meant to take the advice of a few I saw, using the 2tsps. of creme of tarter. Yes, I made a double batch..pretty gutsy I thought. Better too much than not enough. :) When I finished & was happy with the results, I looked over & saw my cream of tarter sitting there! I didn't need it anyway! 
The cupcakes are now in the fridge waiting to be assembled in the morning. Plus, I have extra that will make a fantastic fruit dip! I worried for nothing. :) TY!!!!

OH my god, this is the most delicious thing I've ever eaten.  I honestly don't think I will ever make any other frosting ever again.

I used full fat cream cheese and doubled the recipe to frost 24 cupcakes and had way too much left over.  I over-frosted those 24 (ahem..  23... I had to eat one) and put the rest of the frosting in a tupperware to bring along - because people will dunk.  It's amazing!

Just made this and it's absolutely awesome. Husband and son agree! Read reviews where some said it was "thin". Would recommend they use regular, full-fat cream cheese. That's what I used and mine whipped up like whipped cream and kept the fluffy texture as I iced the cake. I did refrigerate it - hey, it's got uncooked cream cheese and whipped cream in it - that stuff goes bad if it's not cooked, I don't care what they say. I don't care for almond flavoring so just increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoon. I'll be using this for my granddaughters birthday cake - yellow cake, this icing, fresh sliced strawberries, kiwi, and mandarin oranges on the icing and between the layers. YUM!  4.15.17 Update: Okay, this is now my "go-to" recipe for cakes, I've made it more times than I can count and it's been great without fail. Especially good with Tres Leches cake, Coconut cake, any cake with fresh fruit. USE FULL-FAT CREAM CHEESE AND HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM to achieve stiff peaks.  Google "how to whip cream" if you've not done it before so you can see pics of the different stages. Yes, you can over whip.

This turned out absolutely PERFECT!!!  Not only did it whip up as the recipe said it would, but it tastes so DELICIOUS!  This was my first time making this recipe.  I made a milk chocolate cake for my grandson's birthday and used broken candy bars for the garnish.  I'm not sure what some of the reviewers did that messed up the whipping, but it worked perfectly for me.  I used my stand mixer, followed directions exactly, and cranked it up to top speed as I added whipping cream.  This is my new "everytime" recipe!!!  Thanks Jo-Lynn :)

I read so many of the reviews, and found a lot of different advice for tweaking the recipe. In the end, the only advice I took was to use a chilled mixing bowl, and to use regular cream cheese instead of reduced fat. I have a vintage mixer, and if it can pull this off by following the recipe to a T, I wouldn't bother listening to the rest of the advice - you could suffer my fate and become increasingly confused, which is why I decided to ignore the other tips. I found the structure plenty stiff enough. The flavor was AMAZING (tasted like cream cheese, but MUCH lighter and creamier), I got an insane amount of compliments on the taste of the frosting. For my own personal preference, I left out the almond extract.

Excellent light frosting both in taste and texture.  Didn't taste too cream cheesy (think carrot cake) but there was still a mild tang from the cream cheese.  I was going to use other reviewer's suggestion of powdered sugar, but turned out i didn't have any in the pantry.  Turned out that regular white granulated sugar does not make the frosting gritty at all! Right amount of sweetness using what recipe called for.  A note that this recipe did not yield enough to frost a 3 layer cake, no crumb layer possible, so cake had small flecks of chocolate cake coming through.  I needed to strategically decorate cake with fruit to conceal these issues.   I made recipe using light cream cheese that was much softer than regular fat cream cheese right out of refrigerator.  I believe full fat would yield a frosting that would be sturdier and pipeable. I will use full fat next time.  I also used "heavy whipping cream".

Was not a fan of this recipe. First of all found the almound exract very overwhelming flavor in the icing, maybe I am just not a fan of this flavor. Secondly the icing on the cake cracked and turned yellow in spots had to reapply. Thirdly leftover icing in fridge began to destabilize within a day or two made reapplication difficult.

I only gave this 2 stars because as a fruit dip, it's amazing! However, as a frosting, this recipe is off. I tried it as it was written, also tried adding unflavored gelatin and a box of pudding. I have made 6 half-batches trying different techniques. None of them have been stiff enough to actually decorate with. I had my bowl, cream, and beaters chilled. Kept everything nice and cold, it just didn't get anywhere near "sturdy" for me. Oh well, I'll continue looking for a whipped frosting recipe, but at least I did get a great fruit dip out of it!

The flavor of this was great, not super sweet globs of frosting, so a big hit with my parents. Only four stars because I wouldn't call it as sturdy as it seems to claim - held up pretty well at room temp, but it is so light and fluffy it kind of deflated over time.

I can't say enough about this recipe, so easy and so good and works for just about anything that needs frosting. Not over-poweringly sweet but the kids still loved it and so did Mom! Thanks for submitting it! :)

Mine came out pretty runny despite mixing forever...but I downsized the recipe so maybe the measurements were off. I've never been much off a cream cheese frosting fan so I'm not sure why I thought this would be different. I did like the use of vanilla & almond extract.

Followed the directions exactly and ended up with a concoction that had the consistency of cottage cheese. Would not use this recipe again or recommend it to anyone.

I always look for butter free frosting since I am European and we are not used to buttery and very sweet frosting. I made my first batch late and night with my kitchen aid and it turned out great. It had the stiff peaks of whipped cream and it held better then whipped cream. I added a little more sugar and I will just use vanilla next time. I frosted a dozen cupcakes and then sprinkled coconut shavings to resemble snow. I left in the fridge overnight and they looked great in the morning. The same applied to the extra I had left in a container. I put a candy cane in the cupcakes and took them to my high school students as a treat. The kids loved them and made many positive comments about the icing. I give this recipe an A+ .

by far the best recipie I have found for this yet.  I doubled the recipe and that was enough for 52 cup cakes and one big cup cake.  Next time I will also use my secret weapon 1pkg of jello pudding ""white Chocolate"  It gives it a nice flavor and is even more firm.

AMAZING texture & flavor! Held up in very warm room (>80*) for 4 hrs. My new go-to frosting!
CHANGES- I combined the cream cheese, sugar, and extracts and beat with a hand mixer until smooth. 
In a separate bowl (that was sitting in an ice water bath) I whipped the heavy cream until it held peaks. 
Then I poured the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture and mixed less than a minute- just until combined. The texture was perfect- light & airy, yet stayed where I put it. It did not melt or break down all day. 
*This is a whipped cream frosting & can NOT be piped- 'sturdy' in this case means 'won't break down or melt in a warm room'. The submitter of this recipe left an excellent comment on 2/19/09.
Everyone- toddlers thru teens & all the parents- raved about this frosting & asked for the recipe.

It is fairly sturdy but still a little creamy, but not too soft. When I piped it I noticed it did not come out as detailed or sharp as I would have liked. However, this held up great in room temperature on top of cream cheesecakes. I used this whipped cream topping for, “Easy PHILLY OREO Cheesecakes,” also from this website. Easy to put together and whipped up fluffy. It’s thicker than whipped cream. I used all vanilla extract and omitted the almond. It has a nice flavor, not too sweet, just the way I like my frosting to taste.

This is the most terriffic frosting!  I bake cakes for a local restaurant and use this on my banana cakes.  It holds up beautifully and stays fresh tasting for 3 or 4 days when kept in the cooler.  (The cakes don't last any longer than that so this frosting may hold up even longer - who knows)  It is an excellent choice for people who don't like really sweet frostings.  I make it just as the recipe states and it turns out perfect every time.

Very tastey. This recipe is good to use when you don't like a real sweet frosting, like me. I have also added other flavorings like fresh lemon juice and zest and it comes out great each time.

Great taste and would be awesome for a fruit dip but it turned out like soup instead of a frosting.  Ended up throwing out the batch as no matter what I tried, I could not get it to forms peaks.  I won't even attempt this again due to the other negative reviews I've read.

LOVED IT. I was worried about the cream cheese flavor and some of the reviews of it being soupy. I did freeze my bowl before using, froze the heavy whipping cream just for about 20 minutes before using. It was soupy at first but i just kept beating at fast speed and there it was, PERFECT stiff peaks. I did add a tad more sugar and vanilla to taste. It was super good. I frosted the entire two layer cake and piped it as well. All worked great. 

Thank you for this great recipe. Will make again.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  I have been searching for a great frosting recipe for years, and feel like I have finally found it!  I didn't use the almond extract since I don't care too much for it, but I doubled the vanilla and added a little bit of powdered sugar in at the end because I thought it could use a little more sweetness.  I think that this recipe could be very versatile and worked out great for me! Smooth, creamy, thick, and delicious !  Thanks again.  =)

I followed this exactly, and it came out runny. I tried putting it in the freezer to firm up, but it never did.  I was very disappointed--it was somewhat expensive and I'm left trying to figure out what to do with the cupcakes I have to have ready tomorrow. I agree with the others--the taste is good.

This was a yummy frosting, but I agree with other reviewers that this probably would be better for a fruit cake or pie or simply a dip for fruit.  I froze my whips and bowl for about 30 minutes prior.  I also placed the whipping cream in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes to get it real cold.  I mixed the whipping cream until it almost formed peaks.  Then I whipped the other stuff and added it to the whipped cream and whipped it some more.  I will make this again!  EDIT - It's just my husband and I in the house so I had to put the frosting in the fridge so it does not go bad.  It does go runny after the second day, lost its firmness.  Still great flavor though!

Here's what I learned - when prewhipping the cream, "fold" in the cream chesse-sugar mixture after. If you beat it in, the whole thing loses it air and turns to soup. I whipped the cream until it was almost butter (the top will look whipped but check underneath), then folded in the cream cheese. Held up well to pipe, frost, etc. SO many compliments too!

This makes the PERFECT fruit dip,  creamy, fluffy, and held it's texture.  Dipping strawberries into it is simply divine!

This didn't turn out in any way that you have written in your description. It tastes great! However this is not a sturdy whipped cream frosting.  I will admit that maybe I possibly did something wrong... I followed the directions exactly and tried to follow other review's advice about mixing it slow and so forth. It just didn't come out how I was hoping. This was my last attempt at making a cream cheese frosting and now I won't ever try making one for a cake again.

This was so easy to make and just what i was looking for. I did add a couple of shakes of powdered sugar at the end to adjust to my sweetness pref, otherwise followed exactly. Thank you so much this is my only whipped cream recipe from now on!!

This recipe is incredible!!  I wanted to avoid a strong almond flavor, so I only used 1/4 tsp and it was fabulous on Hershey's Chocolate cake recipe!

this frosting turns out perfect every time and I get tons of compliments every time I make it.  I've tried other whipped cream frostings with no luck.  I do add cream of tarter when mixing.  I made cupcakes for a bridal shower and they sat out on the table and kept their shape the entire time.

The taste was good but I followed the directions and recipe exactly and it was soupy like yogurt dip. I may  wait awhile and try again just because the reviews are so good that it has to be something I did wrong, right??

I needed a frosting for cupcakes for my 2 yr old and her friends.  Thought this would be a good recipe since it didn't have too much sugar.  I didn't really care for it, tasted too much like cream cheese.  I added another 1/4 cup sugar which helped, but the frosting didn't hold up as well as I'd like.  The warm kitchen kind of flattened the frosting out.  My friends seemed to like it, but I don't think I'll be using this again.

I love whipped cream frosting but the softness always poses a problem when frosting a cake for decorating. But this recipe achieved my expectations. I did substitute macarpone cheese for the cream cheese and it worked beautifully. I kept the sugar the same. But, as always, added more vanilla :) The macarpone has an excellent airiness about it yet very sturdy and without the tanginess that cream cheese can add. Absolutely delicious and worked great for frosting. Be careful though when adding coloring for as you continue to whip, it will turn to cottage cheese like texture. so stir gently!

Tasted great.  Was not very 'sturdy'.  Did not hold up at an outside birthday party - it *was* pretty hot, but I thought being 'sturdy', the icing would hold up better.  It's not suitable for outside parties.

Wonderful frosting!  Light, airy, and just enough sweetness.  I will definitely try this out with a variety of extracts, but for my husband's birthday cake, I just used vanilla.  Also used full-fat cream cheese.  What a wonderful coincidence that this was a featured recipe just a couple days before my husband requested whipped frosting on his birthday cake!  Will definitely make this again.

I created this account just to sing the praises of this recipe. To make this work flawlessly you must follow the directions added by reviewer cker1010. Freeze your bowl and mixer  just like you would for beating egg whites and your cream cheese must be totally soft at room temp. I smushed mine before putting it into the bowl to make sure. Combine all but the whipping cream first, taking time as if these were the only ingredients, making it light and creamy, and then add the cream.  I will not look for another whipped cream frosting. The cream cheese adds a teeny tang but it tastes good. I skipped the almond extract. Some day I will try adding coffee or coffee flavoring to this. If this could take flavors like a buttercream this would become my only non-chocolate frosting, it’s that good! If you are the type that hates overly sweet, heavy on confectioners sugar frostings and you are not excited about the work that goes into a really good buttercream, do yourself a favor and try this.

Definitely 5 stars in my book!  I had to make a light whipped cream frosting for a strawberry filled white cake.  I didn't have much time and I knew there would be no way to keep the cake refrigerated after it was cut for serving.  This was perfect.  I did chill my bowl and beater really well before mixing it all up.  And, you do have to keep an eye on this when you add  the whipped cream.  It will be loose then all of a sudden you'll see the texture change - check it, because it will probably  be done or very close to it.  This is delicious.  The cream cheese is not really noticeable with the other flavors of the cake.  Everyone raved about the dessert  and I believe it was because the frosting was light, not very sweet, and very tasty AND it held up really well - no melting.  Definitely will keep this in my frosting collection.**forgot to share: I used regular cream cheese when I made this.  It's what I had & it worked great!

I followed this recipe as written, using Neufschatel cheese.  It came out perfect and the taste is sublime.  Just be sure to use heavy whipping cream, not just any heavy cream as you may run the risk of it not stiffening up since a higher amount of milk fat is needed.  I used it on a Black Forest Cake that I needed to make a day before.  This is a very easy recipe and takes only minutes to make.  It also works nicely using a piping tip and smoothes over the sides of a layer cake well with a spatula.   I am a seasoned cook and have made many different types of cake and worked with making decorative specialty cakes over the years.  I will definitely make this again and most highly recommend this whipped cream recipe!!!

Very easy and quick to make!  I used about 10% less sugar, 1 pint (8 oz.) heavy whipping cream and 1 pint regular whipping cream.  I used Jo-Lynn's reminder recommendation to chill the bowl and whisk (freezer for about ten minutes) and followed the recipe directions exactly. I had my doubts, but the frosting was perfect!  I was only frosting some mini carrot cake cupcakes and had a ton leftover.  After two days of finger swiping little tidbits from the bowl, here's what I made:  4 versions of chocolate moussettes!  Folded in the following: melted Nutella, melted Nutella with some instant espresso powder, melted chocolate, and melted chocolate and espresso powder.   YUM!  Note: when adding the warmer melted chocolate, start folding immediately if you want a smooth product!  I hesitated on the plain chocolate moussette and this resulted in a speckled version...still yummy! (BTW my favorite was chocolate espresso.)

This is the best! I'm not sure why others are having difficulty getting the heavy whipping cream to form stiff peaks, when for me it comes together beautifully with the method written. I add 1 cup of confectionary sugar and omit the granular sugar, as I could taste a little of the granular texture the very first time I made this. The bit of extra sugar also serves to tame the cream cheese flavor. I don't chill my beater/bowl, but I do use room temperature cream cheese AND add 1 stick of softened butter. The addition of the butter seems to increase stabilization and the creamy texture. Everything except the heavy whipping cream goes into the mixer and gets whipped until completely smooth. I then pour in 3 cups of the cold cream while the mixer is going at high speed. It's not long before it comes together, thick, fluffy, and heavenly.  I also add 1 Tbsp of vanilla and omit the almond extract. I've made this maybe a dozen times already - each to frost a deep dark chocolate cake - perfect every time.

This makes a delicious, not too sweet, but sweet enough frosting.  I got many compliments on it.  I am commenting because I first tried this recipe using the suggestions from some comments of chilling the bowl, whipping the cream separately, etc.  This did not work for me!  (I find it weird that the reason for beating it separately was b/c of the fat in the cream cheese...that would only hold true if you were beating egg whites.  In that case, yes fat would mess up the whipping process, but heavy cream is full of fat!)  Anyway...that frosting was runny.  I also substituted confectioner's sugar for the granulated sugar and ended up doubling the amount to get any sweetness (are measurements different?).  When I tried the recipe mostly as written (I used full fat cream cheese [b/c why skimp on a birthday cake?] and omitted the almond extract) it was perfect.  It was very firm (almost firm enough to pipe) and delicious.  Stick to the original recipe.  Make sure you add the chilled cream at a slow, steady pace while the mixer is running.  It took about 2 minutes of whipping on med. high in my standing mixer to achieve the appropriate consistency.  This will be my 'go to' frosting from now on!

This is perfect! I was afraid that the cream cheese would make it too tangy like someone else mentioned, but not at all! I made chocolate peppermint cupcakes with this frosting. I added peppermint extract instead of the almond and it had just a touch of the peppermint taste. Everyone loved it!!

I read several reviews (both good and bad), but since I am not a creative cook/baker, I decided to follow the recipe to the letter. I was worried because I had already ruined the first cake and had to run out and buy another box.  The 2nd cake came out fine, but if the frosting didn't work out, I was going to be in trouble!  The frosting came out FABULOUS!!!!!!  I was so pleased with it.  It's not very sweet - which is what I wanted.  My granddaughter loved it and grabbed a spoon to eat the frosting that was left over.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!  I think my Christmas dessert is going to be a hit!

This worked well for a kid's birthday cake - he doesn't like buttercream so needed some sort of stable whipped cream frosting for a Minecraft-themed cake. The frosting tasted great (not too tangy from the cream cheese) and piped out of a star tip very well. My only complaint is that adding different gel coloring and mixing the color in could make the frosting a bit runny. Solved the problem by only mixing two colors and adding them immediately after making a batch of frosting.

Will definitely use again!

Listen this recipe works as advertised, the problem is that some people shouldn't attempt to go past boiling water for Ramen noodles:( even that's a stretch for some. There is a small amount of knowledge required to make this and that is the tendencies of heavy cream/ whipping creams. The failures I read are all due to the simple fact over over-whipping to the point of butter conversion. Hence the cottage cheese consistency. I tested the recipe as a learned chef and I give this two thumbs up. Cheers!

I am glad I stumbled upon this recipe. I needed a simple frosting recipe for chocolate cupcakes. I figured that since this is actualy for cakes I cut the ingredients in half as I only made 16 cupcakes. I read the comments before I decided on this and was worried that the heavy cream won't get stiff. I had to watched a youtube video to actually understand the consistency of a whipped heavy cream. I am very new to baking and it was my first time to make cupcakes. Here's what I did: I put my mixing bowl, the mixer attachments and the box of heavy cream in the freezer before I started making cupcakes. While my cupcakes are cooling off in the rack, I set up my stand mixer(btw, my mixer is not kitchen aid) and poured 8 0z of the heavy cream in the bowl and added 1 tsp of cream of tartar. I started it at low speed (about 10 seconds) as my heavy cream was a bit chunky and then high speed. While the heavy cream is whipping , I mix 4oz of cream cheese, 1/4cup of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and the zest of 1 orange in a separate bowl and set it aside. After about 6-7 minutes of the heavy cream whipping, the heavy cream became thicker and so I started slowly adding the cream cheese mixture in 1/3 parts. I turned the mixer off once the cream cheese mixture is mixed well to the stiff heavy cream.  This recipe turned out really well with the cupcakes and was just the right amount I needed. I got lots of compliments for it.

This is the best Whipped Cream Frosting!!! I get lots of compliments everytime I use it. It comes out perfect everytime! I use a stand mixer, make sure my cream cheese is at room temp, chill my mixing bowl and beaters; I omit the almond extract (I do not like the taste) I use an extra teaspoon or 3 of vanilla extract (this will darken your frosting, but the taste is so worth it). I also use Dr. Oetker Whipping Cream Stabilizer (purchased at World Market). The frosting pipes beautifully. I have also tinted the color of the frosting.

LOVE this frosting and I always get compliments on it.  First time I made this it was perfect.  Second time I over-beat and whipping cream became clumpy like bits of butter.  Not sure how this happened as I was waiting for “stiff peaks” which never quite got there and then it started to get clumpy-and-liquidy, rather than smooth and frosting like.  The last time, for her 3rd birthday, I turned off the beaters as soon as I saw the tracks forming and staying after passing through the beaters and it was perfect.  
All of our parties have been out doors in August and the frosting has always held up well.  This year, making a big cake for our huge birthday party was too much, as we have a new baby, so I ordered an all natural cake from Whole Foods Bakery.  While it was delicious and beautiful, after a while, the Whipped Cream frosting started to fall apart and melt.  This frosting always stays together.  The first year, I added a little beat juice to a small portion for pink writing.  Last year, I added homemade raspberry sauce for color and flavor.  I had to be careful to not add too much, so it wouldn't liquify.  It tasted great!  Also piped it(with the raspberry and without) onto a Nilla wafer cookie and topped with a gummy bear(all natural) for birthday treats for kiddo's preschool class for a treat that's just the right size and doesn't result in a discarded, licked clean cupcake.  This is my "Go-to" frosting and people always ask for the recipe!!!

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  This held it's texture while frosting and provided a light and extremely flavorful frosting that compliments but does not overpower the cake itself.  I did increase the extract by an additional 1/4 tsp. for the almond and I found it helped decrease any potential cheesy flavor.  Can't recommend enough!!

Finally tried it today with regular cream cheese, and it worked out great! The texture was good & sturdy for frosting my cake. Can't see it being good for piping. The flavor was lightly sweet which I enjoy. Not tangy at all. Topped it with fresh raspberries. A hit to be made again.

I love this recipe. I use it every time I make cupcakes or cakes. mine usually pipes just fine when chilled. it isn't as sharp as buttercream but for what i do with it just fine. I do use powdered sugar instead though it gives it slightly more strength and mixes easier. i have made it using vanilla, strawberry and peanut butter. the peanut butter with chocolate cake was a huge hit!

I have to admit I was skeptical... cream cheese? And whipped cream? Would this make an icing that went on anything but a spice cake, red velvet or carrot cake? Alas, as I can leave no recipe untouched (and because I was making cupcakes for my daughter's birthday), I dropped the almond extract and added 1/3 cup of strawberry pudding mix. UNBELIEVABLE! I may never make buttercream again!!!

I'm gonna give this a 4 star mainly because the instructions weren't all that well put. The ratio of ingredients is perfect. I didn't use almond extract because I don't have any, but it tasted perfect and I kept getting people asking for seconds and thirds. It did melt, slightly, so I'm not too sure what happened there. However this is the first recipe I've run across where the icing keeps it shape! 

I found that to do this recipe properly, all the ingredients (less the heavy cream) need to be beaten together until smooth, as instructed. However, the heavy cream needs to be whipped until foamy in a separate dish. Then, the whipped heavy cream should be folded into the cream cheese mixture until you get firm peaks. Oh! I almost forgot. Everything MUST be chilled. The bowl, the beater, and all the ingredients need to be really cold before even starting the recipe. :)

good but...   it's thinner in consistency than I needed for my cake, ended up adding about a cup and a half of powdered sugar to thicken it up.  The added powdered sugar made it a thin marshmallow fluff consistency, but not too much more sweetness.  Would be great on a 9x13 cake with a fruit topping or as a fruit dip.

Sooo Delicious!!  I had to take into consideration the majority of reviewers suggestions (since I had only exact ingredients I didn't want to have to run to the store again!)  So the original recipe is perfect, its just the prep that needs alteration.  After freezing my bowl/mixer for my kitchenaid for 20 min; I whipped the heavy cream with 1-2tsp of cream of tartar.  Set the whipped cream in the fridge while I beat together room temp cream cheese, vanilla, and almond.  Finally folded in the whipped cream with some maple syrup.  End result: a delectable frosting for my pumpkin cupcakes, had everyone who tried ask for the recipe! I can't wait to try with other cupcakes/cakes/or as a fruit dip!!

I love this recipe! I made this twice now and each time it turned out great! I made it yesterday to put on my daughter's birthday cake, I made a 4 layer yellow cake with strawberry filling.  I made the whip icing  the first time with granulated sugar and it work fine, but yesterday I made it with powdered sugar and it was even better! I added a pack of unflavored gelatin and left out the almond extract and it was wondeful! I was able to pipe with it to make a beautiful birthday cake.  This is a keeper! Everyone loved it, including the workers at Red Lobster!!!

Did not hold for me, flavor was good, I whipped it with a hand mixer on highest setting, in a chilled metal bowl with an icewater bath under it the whole time, I whipped till stiff. left it covered in the fridge for 8 hours, it was flat when I returned, rewhipped it, but it ended up soft. I will try gelatine as read in other reviews next time.

This is the icing that I've been looking for!
A light and fluffy icing that will hold it's shape and it's not overly sweet.  
The only down side is that when it's warm, any piping decorations added to the side of the cake ran unless the cake and icing were freshly chilled.

I'm making it again next month for my daughter's birthday cake, devils food cake with this icing flavored with flavoring of her choosing.

I'm not sure how I feel about this frosting.  The flavor is good, but no matter how soft my cream cheese was (I made two batches), I couldn't get it to completely incorporate into the rest of the ingredients.  Also, the white sugar made it rather grainy.  The flavor was great, but I think the name "Whipped Cream Frosting" is a little deceiving.  This is more of a whipped cream CHEESE frosting, so you really must like the flavor of cream cheese frosting in order to enjoy this.  I will probably use this recipe again, but only as a filling instead of for icing cakes.

I wanted to love this recipe, but it sure didn't work for me.  I followed it, using full fat cream cheese, 1/2  cup granulated and 1/2  cup confectioner's sugar.  The taste was OK.  I have a full size Kitchenaid mixer and no matter how long I whipped it, it never made peaks.  I managed to get it to a level where I could "pour" it over the cake (and between the layers, which were  refrigerator cold).  I hope that it stiffens up a little while it sits in the fridge for my husband's birthday dinner tonight.  I am keeping my fingers crossed, but I will not be using this recipe again.

Not sweet at all.  Will have to cut down on the liquid as it comes out liquidy until I put it in the fridge before it solidifies somewhat.

This recipe is EXACTLY as easy as Jo Lynn said in the recipe description.
I saw someone asked about adding food coloring, I did and it worked out perfectly!  I added it with vanilla and almond had about the intensity that I wanted but did have to add a little bit more when I added the cream.  I think you could add it anytime as long as it is before the mixture starts "firming" up.

Also fyi one batch will more than easily decorate two dozen cupcakes, I didn't see that anywhere.

This did not turn out at all for me.  I wish I would of listemed to the others that said it did not work as it turned out to be a very expensieve lesson.  Just was one big soupy mess.  It might work better if you whip the cream and then fold in the cream cheese, but not sure

Excellent!  I did use regular cream cheese, and I changed the almond extract to lemon because I was frosting lemon cupcakes.  I used a stand mixer, and this came together VERY well - I was afraid using regular sugar would make it gritty and it wouldn't have a good texture, but it was wonderful.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over, changing the flavorings to suit my needs.  We did have ONE leftover cupcake that sat out all night, and the texture and taste was just as good the next day - no weeping or melt-down at all... not that I would recommend leaving it out overnight!

WOW!!! I am so grateful for all the helpful comments and all of you were right on....this is easy, easy to make, and exactly the way I wanted a frosting to taste...not too sweet, fluffy, perfect texture. I made it a couple of hours ahead, it was great to pipe on..a breeze. I did USAF organic heavy cream because I personally notice the difference. Thanks a million times for a frosting that is finally a winner!!!!

Delicious! I was a little nervous going into this, unsure of how the cream would whip with cream cheese thrown in the mix -- but it turned out wonderful. It was exactly what I wanted. I was afraid it would be too cream cheesy (and did NOT want a cream cheese frosting!). You truly cannot taste the cream cheese at all. It just tastes like fresh whipped cream. I doubled the vanilla and almond extracts, but otherwise kept the recipe as stated. I will make again and again!

This is a great recipe. It's light, just sweet enough and it does hold up without needing to be in the fridge. When I'm looking for a lighter, less sweet frosting than Buttercream, this is the one I use. I added strawberry jam once and it still held up.

This is a similiar recipe for the one I usually use for cream cheese frosting. The only thing with this recipe is that it calls for less sugar and more heavy cream. It turned out alright. It wasn't as sweet as frosting usually is. I enjoyed it and will probably make it again!

If i could I would give this 6 stars.
I used it for my friends wedding cupcakes. They held perfectly for over 5 hrs. Wedding reception was late at night.
I was skeptic because of the cream, but i had no problem and everyone loved them. I too used the cream cheese a bit chilled as well as the cream. I omitted the almond extract and put 1 Tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. I creamed the cream cheese first with my paddle attachment and then switched to the whisk for the rest of the recipe. More work but it helps with the lumps. :)

I live in Canada and we do not have 'heavy cream' here. Instead, I used the closest option; 35% whipping cream. I don't know if the recipe didn't work because of my substitution, but I read online that it should have. It required a TON of gelatine to get any peaks in the frosting while whipping, and the taste was VERY tangy and just overall not nice. I would not use this recipe again, nor would I recommend it. Stick with a regular whipped cream icing and avoid the cream cheese completely.

I so wanted this to work! I am a pretty avid baker and followed the instructions exactly, but my frosting never became stiff enough to pipe. What a disappointment. 
I see in some of the reviews that others have had this problem. Anyone have any idea why?

this "frosting" would be better as a topping in my opinion it is too thin and fluffy or airy to frost or decorate a cake. With a little tweeking worked perfectly! Added 1/2 cup of vegitable shortning and 1 pkg of powdered sugar... Gave a nice sheen and not oily at all.. Placed in piping bags and in freezer for 1 hr  then in fridge ovrrnight... Worked very well with decorating tips and held the shape nicely did not break down after sitting out during baby shower... So wonderful recipe with a little tweeking..   :-)

Excellent flavor, as long as you like the flavor of cream cheese! If you do not like any cream cheese tang at all, this isn't the frosting for you. The cream cheese flavor is not overwhelming, but it is present. Personally, I loved it. It beats up very quickly, especially if your cream cheese/bowl/cream is very cold, and I did end up overbeating it my first time, so that it was slightly grainy in appearance (though not in mouthfeel!) I did successfully pipe it out into shapes and it held, but I suspect that it may not have held so rock-solid if I'd whipped it to the proper consistency. In any case, it was very popular, extremely delicious (Definitely use the most expensive cream you can find!) and will be my go-to recipe from now on!

Delicious and easy to make. I folded crushed chocolate sandwich cookies into the frosting for a delicious cookies and cream filling. I like that it isn't super sweet.

This is the PERFECT cake frosting!  I was looking for something a little softer than buttercream, yet sturdy enough to hold its shape.  I love the flavor; the almond extract really gives it that special something.  Following another reviewer's suggestion, I beat the heavy cream first (in a chilled bowl) to form stiff peaks, then added it to the other mixed ingredients.  I paired this with the White Almond Wedding Cake recipe, and it is to die for!!

Not a fan of cherries, therefore, not a fan of almond extract. I left that ingredient out with no problems. Love this recipe! However, heavy cream virgins, be warned. Cream can be made into fluffy whipped cream or butter. You don't want butter, so DON'T OVER WHIP!!!

I wanted a good whipped cream frosting for my strawberry cake that didn't melt as fast and this was it!! I read all of the reviews and was a little nervous. But it turned out fabulous!! I also used regular cream cheese and all vanilla, and ended up using an extra 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar because my cake was not very sweet. It turned out perfectly, fluffy and yummy!! Thank you!!!

I followed the instructions to the T. I was looking for a whipped frosting, that had enough consistency to pipe flowers and whatnot. But it was like whipped cream. I make a similar one with cool whip and sour cream....same consistency. Not what I was looking for . Great flavor.

Wow has this recipe been helpful for me.  I make lots of cakes / cupcakes for friends and neighbors. I live in the southwest and many of my hispanic friends do not like SWEET.  This is a GREAT frosting sturdy and not too sweet and I have used it many times as a filling for cupcakes.  Filled with this recipe and unfrosted they are perfect in my husbands lunch bag.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I use it at least once a week.  I also omit vanilla & almond extract, and add powdered cocoa to make chocolate frosting or filling.  YUM!!

This recipe was similar to the "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" on this site.  This one is good but I like the other one better.  It has less cream, a bit of salt, and only one extract.

This frosting is delicious, and easy to make. I used a dab of paste food colouring to tint it, and had to beat it on high in my stand mixer, did not use almond extract, as I wanted just the vanilla flavour. It is beautiful for piping and tastes light and delicious. Thanks!

This recipe tastes really delicious, and compliments the chiffon cupcakes I made really well. However, i had a hard time getting That "stiff peak" for piping. I did go ahead and piped what I could without making a mess and stuck the cupcakes in the fridge. They then began to firm up. I believe next time, I will allow the icing to firm first and then pipe, or add a touch of powdered sugar to help the icing stiffen better.

Very tasty - not too sweet.  But for you novices (LIKE ME) - use Powdered Sugar!

I just made this recipe today for my husband's birthday cake.  I LOVE it!  It's my first time EVER making frosting, and after today, I don't think I'll ever buy ready-made frosting again!  I usually don't comment on recipes, but this is SOO good, I just had to.  I read that some people are having trouble with consistency of the frosting, but I don't see how.  I followed the recipe to a T, except I used 1/3 tsp almond, and 1 1/3 tsp vanilla.  I also didn't use a hand mixer, I used a whisk and put some elbow grease into it.  I whipped it for about 5 mins. or so until I got the "stiff peak".  It iced my cake beautifully, and I was able to pipe with it as well.  I think people are either over beating it, or not beating it enough. At first it was watery, but I kept at it and I ended up with a frosting that looks like what is in the picture above.  Just Beautiful!

Added extra 1/2 powdered sugar, just to sweeten.  changed almond extract to vanilla (total vanilla 1 1/2 tsp).  Awesome!  Loved it.

The taste was fantastic, and mine held up in the refrigerator pretty well overnight. But there's no way I could've piped this like I see in the pictures, and I don't want others to think you're necessarily going to get that result. Maybe with regular cream cheese and a good bit more sugar. I did beat it to stiff peaks -- much longer and I'd have had cream-cheese-flavored-butter, so I don't think that was the issue. If I tried this again, and I just might because like I said, it was fine on a refrigerator cake and very tasty -- I might scrape some vanilla bean seeds into it and omit the extracts. And I will use regular cream cheese, if I do this again. It is of course still possible that I just did something wrong and will get a great result on a colder day with frozen (not just refrigerated) beaters, so I wouldn't discourage you from trying this recipe, but if you're looking to pipe it, have a back-up plan just to be safe! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is excellent. I used marscapone cheese instead of cream cheese to avoid a tangy flavor (the only downside is that marscapone cheese is rather expensive- but it's also easy to make yourself, it just takes time). I also added some gelatin to make sure it would stand up without separating overnight. I have about 2 c leftover from frosting my cake and am tempted to eat it by the spoonful!

This is a perfect not so sweet frosting! Followed the recipe except for the almond extract. SO easy! It shouldn't come out runny unless you are softening your cream cheese in the microwave or using not cold ingredients. I actually used cream cheese right out of the fridge, unsoftened, and it worked great! The colder the cream the better to get the whipping cream to whip. Great recipe! Thanks a bunch!!

Very tasty frosting. Not too sweet. Instead of food coloring I added 3 tsp of raspberry jam.(you could use strawberry) It colored the frosting pink and added to the delicious flavour

This came out as a tangy cream, tasted quite good.
However, I consider it no good for pipping.
I made this today intending to decorate my cupcakes, but these were way too soft to stand nicely.  A very very soft cream  consistency, which just barely stands.

Such a good recipe. I used lemon extract instead od almond extract. I added some of It to raspberry seedless jam for an inbetween layer on my cake.  It's now my favorite.

I took the advice of others and added another 1/4 cup of sugar which worked perfectly!  Made it sweeter and cut a lot of the cream cheese flavor down.  Remember when working with whipping cream to FREEZE your bowls prior to mixing and place your whipping cream in the freezer for about 20 minutes before mixing!  I think the key is to mix only until peaks form...NOT STIFF PEAKS.  Otherwise you will over mix and it will fall flat.

My daughter made this frosting for my husband's birthday cake. Many thanks to the reviewer who suggested folding the cream cheese into the already whipped cream, because the frosting turned out perfect, and she was able to use it to both frost and decorate the cake. (She also added strawberries to a portion for the cake filling.) Everyone loved it, and it will be a staple in our baking arsenal for a long time to come.

I did exactly as the recipe called for, and before I new it, I had butter.  I kept waiting for the stiff peaks to appear, never happened.

whoops, I used heavy whipping cream - thought the carton said heavy cream.  Up until about 1 1/2 cups of the cream consistency was great.  But I mistakenly added the whole 2 cups.  Added more sugar, (Oh Well!) and refrigerated it was just fine.  

I didn't have almond extract so I used extra vanilla, like others have.  Topped these onto confetti cupcakes with peppermint sugar and it was great for my son's valentine birthday!  

This is a "Go-To" recipe!  Will try the fruit dip next!

I made this recipe without the almond extract and it was so tasty and so good!  I used it on a double layer 12" Rapunzel cake that I decorated for a birthday party. I have included the photo of the cake. I wasn't sure how well it would hold up overnight so I spread it on the night before, put it in the fridge and decorated the next day. It spread BEAUTIFULLY! So easy to make smooth! It did not melt or wilt or anything overnight!  Decorating on top of it was a dream! The lettering did bleed a bit into the frosting a few hours after it was decorated but that might just be because I used a buttercream frosting for decorating and colored it with color gels.  In the future I will try to tint this frosting and see if it will be good to decorate with as well.  The taste was wonderful.  I used a yellow cake with a strawberry-lemonade filling topped with the Pastry Cream custard recipe from this site inside. Phenomenal taste!  EVERYONE raved about it! Similar to a Danish layer cake. Thank you Jo-Lynn for giving me another tool in my cake making tools and tricks box!

This is a very tasty frosting that I will be using often! I made it with almond extract and a couple of drops of yellow foodcoloring, for cupcakes. I did not add milk, but think it could have used at least a splash or drizzle as the results were very firm--so firm, I broke my Wilton frosting gun for pressing so hard on the trigger. I know another reviewer commented on not caring for the texture. The texture was great on the cupcakes I decorated with the gun, but once that had broken, I spread the frosting with a knife, and the appearance wasn't as pretty/smooth. Stil, it's a wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Hands down THE best whipped cream I've ever had! It's so light and fluffy & very easy to make. I put this on top of some red velvet cupcakes I made, because I don't like the cream cheese / sour cream traditional icing that normally goes on them. This proved to be a perfect match for my cupcakes! I didn't change a thing about the recipe & it came out wonderfully!

This recipe was awesome...easy to make and it turned out perfectly. I was looking for a whipped cream frosting that wouldn't slide off the cake at room temp and this recipe did not disappoint! BTW- I followed the recipe without changing a thing.

I don't understand why people call this "soupy" or "runny." It was perfectly firm for me following the recipe as written. I piped cupcakes using extra large tips (Ateco 808 and 828) and the icing held beautifully and was a great consistency for holding decorations (nonpareils, assorted sprinkles). It was also nicely balanced in both flavor and sweetness. This is an excellent recipe.

Just tried this recipe but it was so soupy and runny I couldn't use it.  I think it would have turned out well if I had not used 2 cups of the heavy cream, maybe 1 cup would have made it easier to work with.

I first tried this when I needed to make 80 cupcakes for a baby shower. I could never beat it, and this is the only frosting I make now. We always try to have a little left over for waffles the next morning.

This frosting is excellent. It's a nice change from the traditional buttercream. Not nearly as sweet and has a wonderful light texture. I used it on a wedding cake, it looked gorgeous and held up wonderfully on a hot day. My kids dipped strawberries in the left over frosting. Thanks for a great recipe. It's my new favorite standard frosting!

This is great for a light taste with a hint of sweetness, but it wasn't as firm as I would have liked.  I didn't trust it to hold up overnight so I put the cake in the fridge.  If it had a stiffer texture I would have given 5 stars.

This frosting tastes amazing! I was looking for a frosting for a birthday cake I made for my daughter and this was perfect! Everyone raved about it! I also used it on cupcakes I baked for daycare. I made the frosting exactly as the recipe reads, however, I do not feel that it is sturdy outside of the fridge. I kept one cupcake on the counter overnight, in an air conditioned house and put the rest in the fridge. The frosting from the cupcake on the counter "melted" and did not hold.

This was great frosting.  Great texture and taste.  I made two batches, one as the recipe calls for and one with a package of plain gelatin in it.  The latter held up much better overnight in the fridge.  Will be making it that way in the future.  I mixed in fresh raspberries and it was phenomenal as a filling for my cake.

This is excellent! It goes very well with a strawberry layered cake. I used it on my husbands birthday cake. He loved it. I would make sure you like the almond flavor as it is not for everybody beacuse it takes over in a very good way though. I had a little extra and added grand marnier to see how it would taste. It was great.

Great recipe.  I cut down the cream cheese to 3/4's of a block and added ~2TBS of gelatin in warm water and 1/4 c. pureed strawberries.  Stayed fluffy all day in and out of the refrigerator.  Was delicious! This will be a regular for sure.

I gave this 3 stars because the flavor was great and it could have actually frosted a cake or cupcakes.  Unfortunately, if you whip this too long, looking for a frosting that is actually slightly stiff (just a little!) it will curdle and be completely ruined, which is what happened to me.  The stiffest I could get it was just not a texture I was happy with for frosting.  But, again, the flavor is fantastic.

this had great taste but it definitely didn't hold like the picture shows.  it may have been due to the cream i bought - whipping cream 35% - but that was the highest b.f percentage of cream i could find and i went to 3 different grocery stores.  it got sort of sturdy but by the next day it was a runny mess.  again, still tasted good, just was more of a glaze than a frosting.

Absolutely fantastic!  I made my son's first birthday cake (Strawberry Dream Cake I) with this frosting and it was a huge hit!  It felt a little runny when I was spreading and piping it, so I did keep it in the refrigerator overnight, but it held up fine and tasted great!  Such a super recipe, thank you!

Excellent frosting recipe!
I used regular cream cheese, a bit more sugar (closer to 3/4 cup) and no almond extract.  It was sturdy enough to pipe onto my cupcakes.  Deceptively light and airy with all the heavy cream and cream cheese.  It's killer!  YUM!!!!

I paired this frosting with a rich chocolate pound cake for my daughter's first birthday.  After making it successfully the first time, being unsuccessful the second time and getting it right again the third time around, I think I know the secret to getting this frosting to hold a peak and live up to its "sturdy" name.  You can use reduced fat or full fat cream cheese (I've tried both), but the cream cheese does not need to come all the way to room temperature- I think it should come right out of the fridge.  The cream cheese-sugar mixture needs to look stiff, not soupy after beating.  This recipe came out perfect using super-chilled cream and cream cheese.  I made it on a Sunday morning for the birthday party and took the leftover cake to work the next day.  The cake sat out all day long on its second day and the frosting was NEVER effected!!  I too eliminated the almond extract to appeal to a larger group of people.  I will certainly use this recipe again and again . . . so light and fluffy and perfect to pair with a rich cake!  Another note:  Tinting your frosting with a gel food coloring will not effect the recipe.  If your frosting doesn't come to a stiff peak it is not due to using food coloring.  I used pink for mine.

This was fantastic!  It was the perfect combination of creamy and sweet (not too sweet!), and it lived up to its name - I used it to frost some banana bars that I took to work, and it held up all day without refrigeration!  Very easy to make, too - pretty much foolproof!

I am famous with family and friends, for my strawberry cream cake, which I had always frosted with sweetened whipped cream. I decided to use this recipe, and what can I say it is absolutely amazing. It whipped up flawlessly, and the taste is so rich without being too sweet. Thanks for a fantastic recipe. I will no longer use simple whip cream in any of my recipes, but only this.

This icing was WONDERFUL - very rich, very yummy, and it held its form for a couple days. I added about a cup of cocoa to it for a rich chocolate flavour.

The word "sturdy" caught my eye in the name of this recipe, so I tried it -- twice. The recipe failed both times. The first time, I whipped the cream cheese a very long time until it was light and fluffy. The finished result had a consistency of Cool Whip (with a much better taste), but was definitely NOT sturdy. So, I tried adding a bit of additional sugar to stiffen up the mixture. It immediately disintegrated into a gloppy bowl of sweet cream butter and buttermilk. Being a glutten for punishment I tried again. The 2nd time I added an envelope of whipped topping mix. Again it failed, never reaching any kind of "peaked" consistency. I wasted a quart of whipping cream and a pound of cream cheese. Normally, making whipped cream from scratch requires absolutely fat-free bowl & utensils. So, a recipe that combines cream cheese & whipping cream defies the odds. But, with all the good reviews, I thought I would try it. I wonder about those reviews. Where do they live? I live in Florida. Perhaps that's the difference? Although I do agree, it would make a great dip for fruit.

Fantastic, versatile recipe.  I used 3/4 powdered sugar b/c our (organic) granulated doesn't dissolve well.  Not very sweet at all-- just perfect.  Iced and filled an angel food cake (sliced in half horizontally, tunneled out and filled with the whipped cream and strawberries).  With the leftover, added a scant 1/4 c cocoa, a little more powdered sugar and 1/2 cup more cream to make plenty of frosting to frost 15 chocolate cupcakes.  Both the cake and the cupcakes transported and held up beautifully, even at a warm outdoor birthday party.  Had about a cup left over, which I froze to make a yummy ice cream-like dessert.  Talk about getting a lot of bang out of your recipe buck!

Very special looking and not too sweet frosting!! I will use this as my frosting recipe from now on instead of butter based frosting. Super easy to make and, it looked good for a long time.  I used all vanilla in place of the almond extract.  Excellent!

I made this frosting for cupcakes.  Using the stand mixer, it whips up quite firm and was very easy to pipe onto the tops of the cupcakes.  The recipe calls for white sugar-I was not sure if this was granulated white, or powdered (icing sugar) so I opted for icing cugar and it turned out perfectly.  The frosting is so light and airy.  This is my frosting of choice now.

Excellent!  The frosting had stiff peaks within 3 minutes with a hand mixer. Used it with angel food cake and topped with raspberries.  Held up beautifully and got rave reviews.  Thanks!

I am rating this frosting recipe before I even frost the cupcakes!  5 stars for ease of preparation and speed! And taste!  I did not have any almond extract so I just used 2 tsp of vanilla extract and I think the flavor is great!  Light and not too sweet and overpowering, it seriously tastes as great as cool whip!  I dont know about the sturdy thing bc like I said I havent even frosted the cupcakes yet, but if it works out, I will use this frosting for birthday cakes and more!

This was a great frosting for my butter cake.  I also used a berry filling with it and it complimented it so well.  I did add a touch more sugar as I didn't want too much of a cream cheese taste and it was still not too sweet and not too cheese tasting either.  I whipped it with a processor and it came out a great texture.  Definetly holds up in room temperture.  Will use this as a base recipe for a lot of my cakes if I don't want to do buttercream.  Thanks.

I'm making this again now. I'm not sure about the almond extract. I remember it being a little strong (I've made this deliciousness before). I'm doubling the recipe w the exception of the almond extract. Keeping that @ 1/2 tsp. Going to add gel food coloring & see how that works out.

Super happy with this recipe. I did take 'Qupcake's' advice and added 1tsp cream of tartar to help with stiffness since I wanted to pipe the icing. After folding the whipped cream into the cream cheese portion I set it back in the fridge for another 5-10 min before piping it. It turned out perfect, couldn't be happier! This is my new go-to icing recipe. It's light, fluffy and not too sweet. Everyone loved it.
FYI 9x11 dbl-layered cake requires double recipe

I made this a couple times. If you're in a hurry like I was the first time, it was not good. I made it tonight with all the time in the world to get it done. It was beautiful and tasted wonderful! Whip the cream cheese until smooth and creamy and then add the whipping cream and beat, stirring a couple times like recommended.  I may just add a box of pudding next time for a chocolate flavor!

so... I've made this frosting a handful of times and its always a hit. i always follow the directions exactly.  i would suggest not making big batches or using fat free cr cheese as the only times it doesnt hold up quite as good have been when i veered off the recipe. still works but not great to pipe

Excellent recipe. Exactly as written. There’s no need to beat the whipping cream separately. Why add unnecessary work.

It was very easy and had a great flavor. I ended up with an almost whipped cream consistency; I think I may have overwhipped it. While I was doing it I think I hit the ideal consistency, but then I kept going since I've never made a whipped frosting before in order to make sure it was properly thickened. I probably should have stopped there.

I will definitely try again and will monitor the consistency more closely throughout but will also keep some extra cream cheese on hand in case it turns out the same as this time.

I'll make it again. It turned out great with the following changes I incorporated from an earlier review. Powdered sugar - 1 cup instead of granulated sugar. Addition of 1 t. cream of tartar to the heavy cream. Chilled the bowl and beaters in the freezer for 10 minutes before whipping the heavy cream.  Did not use the almond extract but doubled the vanilla. Mixed the cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla separate from the heavy cream. Incorporated 1/3 of the whipped cream after whipping to stiff peaks by folding into the cream cheese mixture, before folding all of the cream in.  It worked great piping onto cupcakes. Tasted great!

I use this recipe for most of my cakes. The only thing I changed about it was the heavy cream. I never use the full two cups of heavy cream. I pour a little at a time. I use less than one cup of the heavy cream and it makes the cream cheese frosting really thick.

This was a perfect frosting for the angle food cake I served for an old friends birthday. I think I liked the fact that is wasn't so sweet best of all, but it spread and held up well! Because it has cream & cream cheese in it I refrigerated it up until serving it! My only regret was that I didn't have any strawberries to serve with it! Next time I will be sure to have fruit or a fruit sauce on hand! Delish and filed away in my favorites! Thanks for the share Jo-Lynn!

OUTSTANDING recipe!  This whipped cream frosting turned out 100% PERFECT.  I followed the instructions to the "T" except I added 1 1/2 t vanilla extract, omitted the almond extract, & used full fat Philly cream cheese at room temp.  Once I slowly added the cold heavy whipping cream, it was at stiff peaks in just under 2 minutes.  I used 5-6 setting on my Kitchenaid stand mixer.  I just delivered my cupcake order 6 hours later (which had set out at room temp the entire time), & the frosting was as sturdy as when I piped it on.  I also garnished with half large strawberry & the frosting molded tightly around each berry half so there were no worries of them shifting or falling over.  I transported 7 miles without one issue.  The taste is amazing with the cream cheese.  I will never use any other recipe.  For those who said this recipe turned out runny, it's no doubt because it was beaten too long which broke it down.  I also chilled my bowl & whisk attachment 30 minutes prior to. Super easy to make & takes less than 5 minutes to make.

I have made this many times, and all but twice it turned out perfectly. The only thing I did differently was use Philadelphia regular cream cheese instead of the low- or no- fat. I didn't think twice about it, especially since you can get three pounds of regular Philadelphia at Costco, but you will be sad and this stuff will never whip up right if you do. Another trick, if you need a tad more structure, is to reduce the cream by a 1/2 cup. People adore this recipe when I serve it on  top of White Almond Sour Cream Wedding Cake cupcakes, and I always get asked to do some for baptisms and weddings.

Super easy, absolutely delicious!!! Light and holds up well.  I love the traditional cream cheese frosting but didn't have powdered sugar in the house so I "tried" this one.  Not sure I will ever go back to traditional cream cheese frosting!  This is amazing!!!

If I could give this more stars I would!! This is the best frosting I have EVER had! I usually don't eat frosting because I don't like it, but this was so good I could just eat it straight. My kids loved it and my husband too! I didn't use the almond extract because I didn't have enough money for it so I just put another half teaspoon of the vanilla extract instead. I can't say enough about this frosting. It is just beautiful and delicious! It was sturdy as well and just perfect in every way.

I have used this twice before.  This Christmas will be my third on a pudding poke cake.  Everyone loved it and ate it up fast.  I almost didn't get a piece myself.  LOL!  I did not need to add anything with it to make it sturdier.  It held up as was promised.  Most delicious and very light.  When I had cake before with the buttercream frosting, most would just scrap off the frosting cause it was to sugary. Too heavy.  Thanks for this recipe.

Thank you for sharing a great recipe. It not only holds up the whipped frosting, but also help preventing from over-mix! And it is so delicious too!

I love it! I made birthday cupcakes for the roommate around mid-day; there were still a couple left when I was putting everything away after dinner, and the frosting was still holding it's shape. My son had piped it on in a swirl with a pastry bag and decorative "star" tip, and the edges were still sharp. I don't know what to say about why it doesn't work for others, but this is the first time I made it, and we had no problems. 
It is true that it's not really sweet like canned frosting, but that's a plus for me. :)
Edit: My son just reminded me that we used confectioner's (powdered) sugar, so maybe that was the difference. I use it in my cookies, too, because it gives them a nice smooth texture.

Too much cream, you cannot taste the cream cheese, less sugar has no flavor.

I used regular whipping cream instead of heavy whipping cream (they were out at the store).  I think it made a difference of the thickness.  Taste and texture was great!  Look forward to trying it again.

Freaking awesome. I wanted a whipped cream frosting recipe that I could flavor into pumpkin spice and boy was this it! You need a stand mixer with this baby and if you have one, make this frosting! It's a nice heavy weight that can be piped but with the light flavor of whipped cream and it takes to any flavor you add into it. I see myself making many variations of this. Love, love love it!

This frosting did not get stiff, but since I was using it to frost a Bundt cake, I liked the softer texture. It had just enough sweetness, and turned out to be very creamy and light with a delicate cream cheese flavor. I omitted the almond extract because I was frosting a pumpkin cake, but I wish I would've put in a little extra vanilla. Next time I'll try powdered sugar and regular cream cheese to stiffen the frosting just a little.

Followed directions exactly & this is absolutely perfect! Agree with what others said: the perfect sweetness-doesn't make your teeth hurt, but sweet & the flavors of the cream cheese & almond & vanilla extract really come through. VERY easy. Of course make sure your cake is cooled before frosting or you may experience the sliding, but easily fixable-just put cake & frosting in fridge. This is certainly going to be my go-to frosting from now on!!!!!

I love this frosting. I have used it on many different types of cakes. While I would say it isn't quite as stable as I'd like it to be, the flavor is certainly there. I love the subtle almond flavor to it. Personally, I still refrigerate it just for stability. Nothing I put it on lasts very long in my house anyway ;)

Love it! Iced cupcakes, I just added powdered sugar to make it a little thicker and was able to pipe it onto the cupcakes. Had allot left over and I used it as fruit dip. Taste amazing!

I have been making cake frostings for over 50 years - this is easy and delicious. It also makes enough to actually frost a cake! I followed the instructions completely except I made a double batch and added probably 1/2 C extra sugar to the two batches. I did refrigerate the bowl and the beaters. Love this. It will be the frosting I use everywhere!

Awesome recipe! Does exactly as the poster said it does. The key is to follow the recipe to a T: use granulated sugar, not powdered sugar and follow the steps as directed. The result is a delicious sturdy frosting you can pipe, it just doesn't have the smooth consistency of the buttercream, but for basic piping it is perfect! I tested the frosting and left a cupcake loaded with frosting at room temp for about 8 hours. No melting, no leaking, nada! Perrrrrfect for all those who find buttercream way too sweet and they avoid eating cupcakes because of it.  This is truly a keeper and a great find! Thank you for the recipe!

I've made this frosting several times now, and LOVE IT. I just use a regular hand mixer to whip it & it whips perfectly and holds its shape so well. The perfect marriage of cream cheese and whipped cream frosting... I use it with Ina Garten's dark chocolate cake & yeah, they're totally why I haven't lost the baby weight yet ;).

This is my new favorite frosting! It is so light, minimally-sweet, and fluffy-- perfect for dense or rich cakes/cupcakes.  I made it exactly as the recipe suggested, except I used full-fat cream cheese (it's what I had on hand).  As for other reviews... I don't feel that it is necessary to whip up the cream ahead of time and then fold it in (I didn't and it came out perfectly!),.  I mixed the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla/almond extract together until WELL blended, scraped it off the edges, then slowly added the cream, increasing the speed of the mixer gradually.  Just stick with it and keep scraping the sides until it is well-incorporated and thick.  Once you have a good, thick consistency, it stays thick and hold up well. It was very quick/easy and so SO good.  It is a MUST-TRY!

I really liked how this turned out and would definitely make it again. I would consider adding less cream cheese in the future, depending on how I wanted it - as written, this is about halfway between regular whipped cream and a cream cheese frosting. I had no problems getting the cream to whip while using the instructions as written, but I did add it very very slowly and my kitchenaid was probably on med-high instead of medium speed while I was adding it. I used it as a middle layer and the outer frosting on a cake and it held up well for about two hours at room temperature.

I used confectioners sugar instead of granular in this recipe, It came out great! We had leftover cake for 6 days and it held up. I also piped and decorated with it and it still looked just as nice as the first day.

I had never made homemade frosting before trying this recipe, and I was nervous. Let me just say, YUM. I did take the advice of the folks who suggested whipping the cream first and separately then beating the rest of the ingredients and finally mixing them altogether. I also used confectioners sugar instead of regular and extra vanilla and omitted the almond. AMAZING. DELICIOUS. FLUFFY. MAGICAL. Thank you.

This recipe for whipped cream frosting is out of this world. It is the best I have ever made. I do a lot of baking and am not a fan of butter cream. I usually go with whipped cream but it doesn't have enough stiffness in it. This one does and it taste unbelievable. I used it on a full cake as you can see. Yummy!

As I was getting ready to frost my daughter's birthday cupcakes, I was informed by my newly minted 7 year old that she no longer likes the usual buttercream frosting that I use. With literally an hour to go before a gaggle of little girls show up for her party, I had to scramble to find a new frosting recipe - and this is where Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting comes in. I whipped this up in a matter of minutes (pun intended!) and it turned out like a dream! I could easily pipe this on cupcakes with little difficulty (and I am far from a pro!) I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding about 1/2 tsp of salt to round out the flavor and the end result easily covered 24 cupcakes with frosting piled high. Thanks so much for a great recipe - this might be my new go-to!

Excellent!  I added 2 T of powered sugar to stiffen it just a little and add a tiny but more sweetness, so one less star because it wasn't really as sturdy as pictured or as stated.  With the powdered sugar, it was much better.

Did exactly as directed and it came out perfectly.  Oh course, this recipe isn't meant for piping.  I use it as a filling for my fondant covered cakes or as a frosting for non fondant cakes.  This recipe isn't meant for piping or detailed decorating.  This has a perfect flavor and holds up beautifully.

This frosting is wonderful! It's truly a combination of a whipped cream and cream cheese consistency. I made this recipe as it's written, except I used full-fat cream cheese. Unlike one of the top reviewer's claims that this doesn't stiffen, mine turned out exactly as I expected; stiff. Perfect. Delicious. Amazing. Did I say, fantastic? 

*I didn't allow my cream cheese to soften, so perhaps doing so would have caused the recipe to not stiffen. My cream cheese was mixed immediately coming out of the fridge. 

I whole-heartedly recommend this recipe!

I made this to frost an angel food cake that I made, and it was delicious.  Both my husband and my mother-in-law loved it, and she even asked me for the recipe!  It's great for those who like cream cheese frosting but want something a little lighter, or just a little different.
I did what other's recommended and put my mixing bowl and beater in the freezer for about half an hour, and the cream in the freezer for about ten minutes.  I whipped the cream cheese, sugar, and extracts together until very smooth first, and then slowly added in the cream while my mixer was on high.  It was pretty easy to frost with, and I even did some simple piping with it!  I left the cake out for most of the day after decorating so the piping did get a bit droopy, but it was still pretty, and probably would have stayed nicer it I had gone ahead and refrigerated the cake.  All in all, a very delicious and easy frosting, and I will definitely make it again.

Very good on my strawberry shortcake cupcakes.  Used powdered sugar & had to use extra to help make it pipable.  Yummy!  Hubby's favorite so far.

Finally found an icing my husband likes! I do think adding the cream very gradually is the key. Did add a bit of extra confectioners sugar to make it more stable. First attempt and it was a hit, but the other reviews helped a lot.

I haven't tried it yet, but I do know from experience that regular cream cheese holds much better than reduced fat. I have tried to use reduced fat in regular cream cheese frosting recipes, like a cream cheese/buttercream frosting for carrot cake, and reduce fat cream cheese does not hold. It makes it runny.

I made this for cupcakes and for a fruit dip. I read the reviews and a lot of people complained about not being able to use it for piping so I out the bowl of my stand mixer in the freezer for about 45 mins before I made this, I followed the directions exactly, it seemed to be looking pretty good, I piped it and in between piping I kept the bowl in the freezer. After about an hour at room temperature it started to lose the shape of the piping. It didn't get watery or dip or anything but definitely don't try piping with it unless you put in some sort of stabilizer. I had a lot of the frosting left over so I froze it and like 3 months later I frosted it and served it as a dip with fruit and everyone liked it and kept asking for the recipe. Would work great on cake or for dips, not so much for cupcakes.

This was good. I used regular cream cheese instead of reduced fat.  I made this the night before and refrigerated it, and it didn't break or have any issues the next day.  Some people thought it was regular whipped cream frosting.  It wasn't too sweet.  I thought it was easier to spread than the stabilized whipped cream that I usually make.

I LOVE this recipe and have used it on carrot cakes, chocolate cupcakes, and between ginger cookies for whoopie pies. I definitely reccomend it for any cake that usually calls for cream cheese frosting and you can easily add more cream cheese or less whipping cream when I want it cream-cheesier and substitute vanilla extract or liquor for the almond extract when that seems like a better choice. Delicious and always gets lots of compliments!

I found this recipe one day when my whipped cream frosting would not hold together. I was so frustrated and find this recipe by chance. I already had softened cream cheese since I was working on other cakes so I decided to try it. I am an instant fan and it has become my standard whipped cream frosting. My family has this lady from church do our special event cakes. We like to call her 'the cake lady'. She tried this frosting and was asking where I bought it from. My family loves my baking and I think after this last event where I made the  cake I've officially become my family's  new 'cake lady'.

Success! Made this for my daughters birthday cupcakes everyone loved it. I used powdered sugar. Worked up nicely not to sweet which worked out perfect because we topped with sugar sprinkles for decoration stayed stiff while it was unrefrigerated. My husband called this his new favorite frosting. Will use again.

Awesome texture and flavor. I made a 9" round pineapple upside down cake and decided to make it with a layer and needed a thick whipped cream frosting for the filling and sides that would not melt a minute after it is out of the fridge. I also added shredded cocoanut to the frosting - about 1/3 cup. So I guess it is now a "Layered cocoanut cream filled pineapple upside down cake"! Thank you for making this great!

Made  a 1/3 recipe for a mini Epiphany cake. Used 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1-2 tsps Chambord liqueur instead of vanilla. Turned out great- not too sweet, fast, filled the bill and the beaters were very tasty too.

This wasn't for a new person trying to make a frosting. Now that I am looking elsewhere on the internet I see much better recipes that explain to whip the cream separately. Chill the bowl and beaters.

I made this recipe just as directed and it was heavenly. I'm not even a big frosting fan! Just take care not to over-whip in the final stages or you'll lose some of the sturdy fluffiness. If you do happen to over-whip and end up a bit too runny, try adding just a touch more cream and whip again; however, you can't keep saving the recipe this way. Stop whipping as soon as you notice the frosting forming sturdy peeks.

This whipped frosting recipe is the BEST!  I have no idea why so many people had problems...I made two different batches of this icing one after the other and they both turned out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT for the almond extract.  I used Vanilla Butternut flavoring instead and it was delicious!  I used this frosting on a black forest cake, icing in between 3 layers and then covered the cake in the icing and piped detail and left it in a 50 degree room overnight and it held up awesomely!  I was using Wilton­'s Whipped Icing Mix purchased from Wal-Mart or Michael's Craft Store and it stands up okay, but the taste isn't the greatest.  Your Icing recipe was sweet, but not too sweet, it was completely perfect and I am forever grateful for this life saving recipe!  I will use this for my main icing from now on!

Amazing, especially after it sits for a day. The almond extract starts to penetrate the cake making it moist and so delicious!! My kids, husband, everyone who tries it, absolutely loves this frosting. Great on cakes, even better on brownies.

I probably won't use it again as a whipped cream frosting, as I found the cream cheese taste too prevalent. Or if I do, I'll cut way back on the cream cheese (thus making it less sturdy).  However, I've been looking all over for a recipe for cream cheese frosting that isn't too sweet.  For that, this recipe will be perfect!

Loved this frosting! I was a little worried after reading other reviews, but I followed the directions (only adding a little more sugar) and it worked great. I tinted it purple for my daughter's birthday cupcakes, and she loved it.

Just finished frosting a fresh apple/pecan cake with this.  So easy, so delicious, not heavy, just right.  A wonderful topping that's sure to delight.  Left out the almond extract for this particular cake and added a dash of cinnamon.  P E R F E C T !!

I just tried this recipe.  It's delicious and I will definitely be eating it vs using it for frosting, but mine was too soft and not holding the peaks like in the video and other users' pictures. I am not for sure, but I think because I used Heavy Whipping Cream instead of Heavy Cream... I googled and it seems there is a big difference as Heavy Cream is better for piping. I think this should be confirmed and pointed out in the directions for us ambitious amateurs please!

This is a great alternative to cream cheese icing! Lighter and less sweet, with the deliciousness of whipped cream added. I followed the recipe exactly and used it to frost a red velvet cake. Because of the telltale tang of cream cheese, I wouldn't recommend this as a standard "whipped cream" icing, but it is delicious anywhere you would normally use a cream cheese icing - carrot cake, banana cake, red velvet or chocolate.

Sadly, this is anything but sturdy. I am a very experienced baker and I could not get this to whip past the texture of pudding. I tried chilling it overnight and whipping again. I tried adding 2 packets of Dr. Oetker's Whipped Cream stabilizer and whipping it agian, and then I added some powdered sugar. Nothing worked. It tasted great and I didn't want to waste it, so eventually I added another block of cream cheese and then made a loose version of frozen chocolate terrine so I wouldn't have to toss it out. The terrine got rave reviews. If you can't get the frosting to whip, I highly recommend it.

I absolutely LOVE this frosting recipe! It works the best for cupcakes. I've made this several times and everyone raves over the frosting. I usually omit the almond extract though and just add a bit more vanilla. I have also made this before and added about 2-3 Tablespoons of Bailey's for Irish cream cupcakes! Wonderful!

This frosting was great!  I wanted something creamy and fluffy but not too sweet and this was perfect.  It didn't taste like a cream cheese frosting and it didn't taste like a cool-whip frosting...it was just right.  I put it on a Cookies and Cream cake and everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I use this for every cake and or cupcake that I make. It is also great as a fruit dip or to dip anything in. My family loves this Frosting! I add a little bit more almond extract than it says though. I also sometimes add food coloring and it turns out wonderfully.

I have to make a sheet cake for our Women's Day and I baked a small cake and used this recipe, it was what I was looking for but the only thing it was a little runny but it worked very well, I have to find out what else I can use to make it a little stiffer. I have to put decorations on the cake and I don't want it to look to runny. I would give it a five rating because it is not too sweet like the butter cream, I will be using this recipe for a long time.

I love this frosting! I made a few changes, I use 1/2 a cup icing sugar and 1/4 cup regular sugar. I also skip the almond and add lemon because I like it with fruit toppings. It is nice and fluffy and refreshing without being too sweet. Not great for decorating but its firm enough to hold its shape out of the fridge.

Mine melted after less than an hour. It was perfect at first, but after a while, it became a total disaster. I followed every single step, so I'm not sure what I did wrong. I LOVED how it tasted, though, and I'm sure it was me and not the recipe, so I'm giving it a perfect rating. More practice for me, I guess.

I absolutely love this recipe! The flavor was fantasic and it easy to make! I loved it...the 2nd time - I had to make this twice, the first time was not successfuL; it was runny and I didn't enjoy it as much with the almond extract. However. the second time - I used regular cream cheese, used only the vanilla extract and as a lot of these ratings say, I used a chilled  metal bowl and cream. Also, I whipped the cream first then added the ingredients to that, oh and added a bit of powdered sugar and yes, this time it was sturdy. YUM!

I am VERY new to cooking and my step-son wanted a "homemade" birthday cake (since his mom is a chef, this was a scary thing for me to say the least). I went searching for an easy icing recipe and found this. Since I didn't have time to do a trial run, the morning of his birthday party was my first attempt... it came out GREAT! Very easy to do and just let the mixer do the rest! It did take a little longer then I thought it would for it to get a good peak but once it did, it was perfect - and tasted delicious!!!! Would totally recommend this one for anyone - the newest cook or the expert!!!

Fantastic - reading the words of warning in other reviews, I beat the cream cheese (not reduced fat), sugar and maple extract like crazy and then put the bowl and mixer end in the fridge to chill and mixed gelatin with water per pkg directions and waited for that to cool.  I then beat the chilled cream cheese with the gelatin till mixed and slowly added the cream in a fine stream then beat till peaks formed.   Wow, it turned out perfect and tastes delicious and easily covered my spice chiffon cake.  I made a bit of buttercream for piping.  I will use this for icing cakes as it isn't as sweet as buttercream and is light and delicious.  I would not attempt to pipe anything with it though.

This was an awesome recipe!!!  I added 1/2 a tsp of cream of tartar since some before me wrote it tended to fall, it worked great!  Everyone loved it, in fact I will be making this again for my 4 year old's birthday next month.  A definite keeper!

the title of this frosting got my attention because i was looking for a light whipped cream type frosting but one that was sturdy enough for piping on my cupcakes because my go-to buttercream recipe is really sweet and i needed something different for a coworkers bday cupcakes i was making her. i am a little disappointed in this recipe because i followed it exact and "sturdy" it was not. i had to put my cupcakes in the fridge because i was scared the frosting woud run. i even added 3/4 cup of powdered sugar to the mix. i am going to try this again with a little less whipping cream and maybe cream of tartar

Perfect texture and easy to make. It keeps its shape outside of the refrigerator and is great with fruit.

Wonderful recipe!  I will make this often!  I prepared the cream cheese mixtire in a bowl and set it aside.  Then I whipped the cream with an electric mixer until almost done, added the cream cheese mixture, and then finished whipping (stop quickly before it turns to butter!).  It made enough to cover a 12x18" sheet cake.  It's creamy and delicious, and holds up like it says.  Plenty sweet, I would not want more sugar.

My first attempt failed.  It separated and was soupy.  On my second attempt, I made sure to use a chilled bowl (and I saw online that to make whipped cream you should use chilled glass, but I didn't have glass) and chilled cream.  Using a handheld mixer, I kept it on low, mixed it at a much slower speed, and stopped at just the point it I saw peaks.  The second try turned out so much better than the first attempt. And it tasted pretty awesome, too.

One star for tasting good zero stars for being a soupy mess, I tried everything under the sun to get this stuff to get any kinda peak and nothing. I was very paitient, after 15 minutes in my stand mixer I went for the hand mixer, put the bowl of soup and the beaters in the fridge, there was hope for a second then soupy mess. Now out of heavy cream at 1:00am and no hope I made some awesome buttercream and used the soup as the "Heavy Cream" for that recipe.  Very disapointed.

I do not know what I did wrong, but this did not whip into stiff peaks!  I did not have time to try to remake it, so went with another tried and true frosting recipe.  Would love it if this one would work for me!  It just was a sloppy mess.  Anyone know what I did wrong?  I tried to follow the directions exactly . . .

I made this for some cupcakes for a baby shower and everyone loved it!!  It stood sturdy and tasted great.  I didn't have almond extract and it was still great. Everyone kept asking what kind of frosting it was and they were shocked when they found out it was homemade.

I'm so frustrated! This recipe ruined my cupcakes I had planned for today - the 4th of July. I made this recipe once, went to the grocery store in the sweltering heat to buy more ingredients because it didn't work the first time, and made it a second time only to have it flop again.

I used this for a blueberry vanilla cake for a co-worker's birthday. EVERYONE loved it, and so far I have one request for the recipe. Thank you!

I used full fat cream cheese, heavy whipping cream, and Baker's Sugar (finer than granulated). I omitted the almond extract.

This is the ABSOLUTE best frosting I've ever tasted!  And it was so incredibly easy to make.  I whipped it up in less than five minutes. My son wanted orange frosting for his bday cupcakes so we made "orange cream" frosting by omitting the almond extract and using orange extract instead.  You could really make any flavor you'd like with extract. Great recipe!

I love this recipe! I use it from dipping fruit to decorating wedding cakes! It holds up great. I don't use the almond extract because it is overpowering for me and my clients. Instead I use vanilla or maybe even a little coconut, depending on the occasion. Love it!

This was delicious and very light tasting!!
Not too sweet or sour, just a perfect balance.

Perfect for cupcake swirls, but has anyone tried piping decorations like roses etc?  And would I need to add gelatine or mirangue powder and how much?

Thanks Jo-Lynn for an awesome recipe and looking forward to hearing anyone's suggestions on making it more sturdy for piping :)

Used this for Irish Whiskey Cakes in a jar. I followed the advice of others to whip the cream cheese separate from the heavy cream and then combine the two. Left the cream in the freezer for 30 mins. and didn't bother with cold bowls or beaters. Perfect! Tasted like whip cream to me with a slight cream cheese flavor. It did not break down and was fine as a icing topping for the jarred cakes.

I will never make another frosting, this was so delicious and was just what I was looking for. It's light tasting and not too sweet. I can't rave about this enough! It makes plenty of frosting, I frosted 2 9x13 cakes.

This is an excellent cream cheese frosting that is sturdy, light, not too sweet.  Will work on any cake.  I frosted chocolate cupcakes with it, so good.  Have been searching for a cream cheese frosting that is not so sweet and hold up without refrigerating.  Placing the bowl and beater in the refrigerator for atleast 15-20 minutes before beating was a good suggestion.  I also used 3/4 instead of 1/2 cup sugar.  Turned out perfect and worked well with my icing bag and tip.

This frosting is so good. Cream cheese frosting is my go to frosting but I was looking for something lighter and this was perfect. My frosting was a little soft, still pipped, just not as well as I hoped, but that is probably my fault since I was nervous of over whipping it. will make again.

Tried this twice... No success!  We can't get heavy cream in my town so I tried whipping cream which just didn't have enough fat content to work.  I was really hoping to find a less buttery icing!

I have used this recipe on cakes for events, and everyone loves it. Not too sweet, and it holds up well. I do use regular cream cheese instead of reduced fat.  Another reviewer asked about food coloring, and I've found that gel food coloring works great. Every time I use this frosting, I get loads of compliments.

This was an excellent recipe and exactly what I needed to top my dessert shooters.  I used regular cream cheese and only vanilla extract.  I put my mixing bowl in the freezer for about 10 minutes before starting.  It whipped up beautifully and the taste was amazing!!  I was eating it out of the bowl.

Exactly what I was looking for. Light whipped cream cheese frosting and not too sweet. A mound of whipped frosting that never fell.

This recipe is easy.  I use 1/2 the reduced-fat cream cheese but everything else the same.  Make sure you whip it long enough and beat at no more than medium speed.  I've made it several times and it always come out creamy and delicious.

wow this is delicious. I used the new white chocolate cream cheese by Philadelphia and the vanilla I used is more like vanilla syrup with seeds so it has seeds in the frosting to make it a bit more swanky. ;) so light and sweet and yummy!

This frosting is awesome!  I used it on chocolate stout cupcakes, piping it on using a ziplock bag I'd cut a corner from.  The flavor is great, not too tangy from the cream cheese, and the texture is perfect.  It held up well to simple piping and would be very easy to spread as well.  I especially love that this recipe doesn't start out calling for a huge amount of sugar!  I used powdered because the granulated I have on hand at the moment is a bit coarse and I was worried about it giving the frosting a grainy texture.  I did add more than the 1/2 c called for, probably more like a full cup, but it still isn't overly sweet.  I will definitely be using this frosting again!

Super yummy frosting! I used it to frost my Christmas sugar cookies, so instead of the almond extract, I added mint extract (and a little green food dye) and holy cow! Cool and refreshing, my cookies just vanished!

This was excellent! I did add just a little extra sugar and only used vanilla extract. I used this on Creamy Coconut Cake from this site and it was perfect! Light and not too sweet! I look forward to using this recipe over and over again!

As a rule, I hate frosting. It's always too sweet. This frosting, however, is really light and has just the right sweetness. I think it would also be really good as a fruit dip. My husband was making this for my birthday cake and he got a little enthusiastic with the mixer. He kept on beating it until it collapsed in on itself and turned to butter. He was really disappointed until we decided to put it in the fridge and let it solidify. It became this delicious almond flavored buttery spread that tastes fantastic on cinnamon raisin English muffins or toast. What a happy mistake!

This is a cream cheese frosting, I don't think you can classify this as a whipped cream frosting. A suggestion for those who don't like cream cheese and would like a stiffer whipped cream and a tsp or 2 of cream of tartar when whipping your cream, I've decorated cakes and used on cupcakes and the whipped cream held up at room temp for hours it has even held its shape after a couple days in the fridge. The cream cheese recipe is a good one though for those who like it.

OMG!  Best. Frosting. Ever.  I could have eaten the whole bowl.  Slathered it on to the cake thick and messy...gorgeous!  I didn't have any almond extract, so I was bummed about that, but I will definitely keep this recipe forever.  I used Neufchatel cheese and heavy cream.  Can't wait to try again with different extracts.  I layered the frosting over a thin layer of peach preserves in the middle...the not-so-sweet flavor of the frosting will be awesome with the sweet flavor of peach.

I use regular sugar, and it turns out great!  I can't even imagine using powdered sugar with it!  I have made it so many times I tend to use it more than buttercream! What do you think the "safe zone"  is on this though as far as spoilage?

This worked out fantastic for me. I doubled the recipe and added 2 packages of grape kool-aid and the flavor was wonderful and it was perfectly sturdy even in 98 degrees. I will be using this recipe again and again.

I made this last night. I had to make it twice since the first batch went a little too far and the frosting broke. I don't know that I would call this sturdy. I frosted cupcakes, and the frosting didn't hold it's stiffness as well as I thought it would. After refrigeration the frosting still gets soft quickly at room temperature.

Mine came out runny and started to get little lunps...  But it did taste good.  I used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar.  It was too runny to put on top of the 9x13 cake. I guess I can use it as a fruit dip.  Maybe next time, whip the heavy cream and set aside then whip the cream cheese and fold together...?

This frosting is amazing and so good.  I'm making 60
cupcakes for a birthday party and I'll be traveling 2
hours away from my home.  If I make this frosting just before leaving and store it in a ice chest will it keep and still be the same texture.  Plan to frost the cupcakes upon my arrival.  Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks

A winning recipe...followed exactely. Frosted Clown Cake from this site which I died red, white and blue for the holiday. This frosting was very light and not too sweet with a slight hint of almond. It was perfect on these patriotic cupcakes. Adults and kiddos loved them. Will be making this frosting again...not only was it a cinch to make....again...not too sweet and that was a huge plus for all of us. Thanks!

Loved it!! First time making my own frosting and it was relatively easy. I followed other's advice and chilled the bowl and whisks before starting to beat the heavy cream. I skipped the almond extract and just used a bit more of the vanilla since that's a better flavor for us. I also added a package of unflavored gelatin to make it stiffer and easier to beat. The frosting was a big hit! It was not overly sweet and it held up nicely! Recommend to all!

This frosting is very tasty. It's light and fluffy and not overly sweet like some bakery frosting tends to be. I made this for miniature cupcakes for a baby shower. They were a hit and the frosting did hold its' shape very well. It looks excellent when piped out of a large star tip! Super easy to make and it looks professional!

Oh wow! This frosting is AMAZING! Sweet without being too sweet, rich but not heavy, beautiful and amazing! I made mine with just vanilla as the flavoring and used it to frost/fill my red velvet wedding cake. It was beautiful, delicious and the frosting held up all throughout the reception. THANK YOU for the the best frosting I have ever had.

This is a fabulous frosting.  It has lots of volume and does not run.  It's my new favorite.  I have tried it using vanilla, strawberry and chocolate flavoring.  They were all very good.

This is a geat icing recipe!  I put in on carrot cake, and it was really easy to make, and really easy to work with.  Worked great for piping through a pastry bag.  I had a lot of requests for the recipe.  Light and not too sweet!

I did not use the almond and vanilla extracts and I slightly reduced the cream cheese (6 ounces). Whipped the whipping cream with sugar until firm, then mixed with cream cheese.

I used this on some really rich chocolate chip chocolate cupcakes.  The flavor of the frosting went perfectly, just light enough to work well with the chocolate.  I was eating the leftover frosting with a spoon.

I am not a fan of cream cheese frosting at all unless it is on carrot cake. But I must say this recipe is the best I have had tried. I have looked & tried a lot of recipes from this site & somewhere else. So far this is the best. And I am not looking any more. The only change I made was to add 1/4 c sugar to make it less cream cheesy. Then just like a previous post, I added unflavored gelatin at the end to keep it firmer. I was thinking of skipping the almond extract but it actually is a very good & delicious addition. My 4 y/o daughter who is not a fan of sweets at all, loved this frosting...yep, this is not very sweet at all.

I used this with the Strawberry Cake from Scratch. I added leftover strawberry puree. This frosting was delicious before and after addition of strawberries. This is a great standard icing.

I have never made whipped cream or frosting before. I wanted a recipe that I could use all organic ingredients for my daughter's 2nd birthday. I used half the amount of cream cheese and sugar and used 2 tsp of vanilla. I omitted the almond extract. The recipe came out fabulous. It was not too sweet but tasted delicious and was very easy to make. I used a hand mixer and it only took about 2-3 minutes to form stiff peaks. I made extra for dipping with fruit. I can't wait for my guests to taste it.

Left out the almond & added baking cocoa to the cream cheese to make chocolate frosting.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  Was concned about it not thickening without whipping cream first, but tried it cream cheese first anyway & it worked just fine.  Piped ok, would have piped better if I let it chill longer.  Served over cafe late muffins with shaved espresso chocoate on top.  Yummy!

MMmm! I have to say though: This had me sooo nervous while I was whipping. I used an electric hand mixer and it literally took longer than 10 minutes for me to get it to a spreadable texture. I was worried that I had done something wrong, but just keep chugging along- it'll stiffen! And it's worth the time- it's delicious! Many compliments! I'm about to whip up a batch again in about 20 minutes for a friend's cake! This is THE recipe to use for cream cheese frosting!!

I join the group that had a "soupy" result.  Maybe I warmed the cream cheese in the microwave too long to soften it when I started.
I just double checked my carton of cream.  It says "HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM".

Very tasty frosting, though I wouldn't exactly call it "sturdy" (hence the 4, not 5, stars). A little goes a long way. I doubled the recipe for the first two dozen of a three dozen cupcake project and ended up with enough frosting for all three dozen plus a little left over--an easy excuse to make another small cake. All the kids (and grownups!) loved the almond flavor. I'll definitely make this again, though I think I might add a little more cream cheese, a little less cream, or some powdered sugar to thicken it up a bit.

Not sure if I did something wrong as I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I could taste the heavy cream over everything. Confused on this. Maybe lower the amount of heavy cream or maybe use milk instead?

Depending on what I'm using this for I change it a bit. I never use the almond extract, mainly because I don't keep it on hand. I usually follow the recipe except half the cream for a french silk pie because it holds up a lot better. But for cakes and cupcakes I follow it exact and it's still great.

I had to use a food processor to make mine in since I'm in the middle of a big move and my mixer is in storage. So I'm rating the flavor more than the consistency. I think it's a little more like a light cream cheese frosting then a whipped cream frosting. I taste cream cheese more than whipped cream. I'll try it again when I have a mixer but I do think I'll use less cream cheese and more whipping cream to change the flavor, unless I'm looking for a cream cheese taste. It's also pretty sweet so I'd add the sugar in a little bit at a time to desired sweetness.

I made this to top the Florida Key Lime Pie submitted by Marion McWhorter for a friend's birthday.  I was very impressed with how easy this frosting was to make and that it was not overly sweet like most cream frostings are.  To me this is a cross between a cream cheese frosting and actual whipped cream.  When I made this to top the Key Lime Pie I also squeezed 2 key limes (about 1 tsp) into the frosting and it was simply amazing!  Both my husband and the friend for whom I made this for said it was better than any resteraunt version they have ever had!

The flavor is great - not to sweet, not to bland. It did not turn out good for piping. I followed the directions and then put the frosting in the fridge until my cake cooled, and it was very runny. It does firm up if you leave it sitting at room temperature, but I agree with previous reviews - it is heavy on dairy products and should not be left out for long periods due to the dairy products spoiling.

I don't know what went wrong but this frosting is not sturdy at all. I added the whipped cream and beat until it became grainy, but it would not become stiff. I am pretty sure that my cream has not expired. This frosting is soupy and the recipe not clear. Horrible if you had wanted a Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting

This frosting tastes delicious, BUT, if you're not looking for a cream cheese taste, do not use this one.  It should be called CREAM CHEESE whipped frosting.  I made it to go on chocolate cupcakes and quite honestly, it ruined them.  I think it would be great on carrot cake or strawberry.  I had no problem piping it onto cupcakes.

This is such an easy preparation for this icing. I don't love cream cheese flavor but this is wonderful - I used a full c. of sugar and that took the tangy edge off the cream cheese taste. Used this on a large red velvet cake for a wedding shower and the guests could not get enough!

Best frosting I ever had or made. Very easy. I served on cupcakes. There was enough to frost 24 piled high. Cupcakes were lemon cake and for the frosting I substituted strawberry extract for the vanilla extract. I topped each one with fresh lemon zest and a slice of strawberry. The frosting held up perfectly. Perfect ending to a meal.

This frosting was *so* easy to make, and so light and delicious that it will definitely be a 'keeper' recipe for me.  This recipe frosted 24 cupcakes with *lots* of frosting on each, and even in my warm kitchen the swirls on top of each are still holding their shape and are not drooping or melting.  I used 4 oz. full-fat cream cheese + 4 oz. fat-free cream cheese because my store didn't have 'reduced fat,' and it turned out great.  Awesome recipe!

Great frosting.  I'll use this all the time.  I didn't have almond so just used all vanilla.  I wanted it to look chocolaty so i added a couple tablespoons of cocoa.  Put it on Dark Chocolate Cake I.  Big hit.

WOW!  Yummy, yummy!  My sister-in-law and I made this recipe to go on a box mix of chocolate butter cake.  We made a double layer cake with fresh strawberries dipped in Nutella in the middle of the layers and spread the frosting between the strawberries, then frosted the whole thing with it.  We chilled the whipping cream in the freezer for about 45 minutes to help it set easily and we used confectioners sugar instead of granulated and added a little more than 1/2 cup,  also a little extra vanilla.  AMAZING!!!!!

excellent frosting!  It went over much better with the family than a too sweet buttercream.  I used it on a fresh strawberry cake from this site and everyone loved it.  I did add an extra 1/2 c of powdered sugar per other's suggestions.  It wasn't quite as 'sturdy' as I expected but I was still able to frost and pipe with it and I did store the cake in the fridge.  Overall, and excellent frosting that I will use again and again.

This frosting holds up well, which is exactly what I wanted. However, it did not pipe out as nicely as I wanted it to. Great taste! I omitted the almond extract, and added 1/2 cup powdered sugar in addition to the 1/2 cup white sugar to stiffen it up and minimize the tang of the cream cheese.

Awesome frosting!! I'm doing a cupcake tree for a wedding and needed something that would look great (without being overpowering) and hold up. This is it. I took someone's suggestion and added a packet of gelatin. I also added 1/2 cup of pwd. sugar b/c I wanted it to be a bit sweeter. Turned out great and has held up great on cupcakes that I have left out for 24 hours.

this is excellent, i made a practice batch before hand as I have two daughters getting married this month, one wedding is 3 hours away and this daughter does not want her cake refrigerated, this has such good flavor and texture, it will be hard to get the cupcakes frosted before I make another batch.....can't stop tasting it.....I can see the expressions on our guests faces when they find it is homemade......

I really liked this recipe for a frosting that wouldn't take away from the flavor of the cake too much or be too rich.  I used powdered sugar instead of granulated, and added 3 Tbsp Saco cocoa when I added the sugar.  This made for a delicious, creamy, fluffy, light frosting for the devils food cake, and I garnished with chocolate curls.  I usually make homemade buttercream frosting (the real way) which takes forever and is very testy.  This was fast but still melt-in-your mouth creamy.  It also held up well.  Mmmm.

Good frosting, I did cut back the cream cheese on a second batch I made and liked it better. As for leaving it at room temperature, I wouldn't recommend that for anything that has cream cheese or cream in it.

Wow!!! This frosting is fantastic...very easy and quick. Tastes amazing, I didn't use the almond extract (only because I don't have any on hand) and it was just fine.  At 1st I didn't think it was going to get sturdy then I turned up the speed of the mixer to almost the fastest speed and it fluffed up perfectly. Thanks for sharing!  This is going to be my staple frosting from now on!!!

HOLY WOW!!!!!! This one is a keeper for real. The only way you can mess it up is too not follow the directions EXACTLY if you beat everything but the cream first until it's creamy then SLOWLY add the heavy cream beat until stiff you can't loose. It's the best frosting ever. I think so cuz buttercream is just way too sweet for my taste. But go ahead and go crazy with this one.

This was really good, creamy frosting, without being too heavy or too light. It really is perfectly in the middle, easy to spread and easy to make. I used this on a dark chocolate cake and the combination was awesome.

I love this recipe.  This is the only frosting I will use for all of my homemade cakes. You can flavor it so many ways, too. I've used it with various food colorings, maple syrup, lemon extract, almond extract, chocolate powder, honey, strawberry jam; of course not all together, but they all turned out great!

Really good frosting!  Mine turned out a little "soft"...more like a drizzle. But was really good on a basic, dense white cake. We drizzled it over:  Simple White Cake SUBMITTED BY: SCOTTOSMAN  and it was sooo good! Everyone agreed it was great! Love it!

This frosting tasted great! I used it to make a Strawberry Shortcake and it tasted/looked amazing! ***Word of advice! DO NOT MAKE THE NIGHT BEFORE!!!!*** I did this and it was perfect and stiff would have definately held my cake, I put it in the fridge to do the cake in the morning, but the frosting deflated...oops!  Other than that...AWESOME!

Very light and creamy, easy to work with in frosting a sheet cake. I did not put any in a pastry bag and pipe with it, so I do not know how well it would stand up to the warmth of your hands in doing so. Got rave reviews from co-workers! Easier to "whip" up then stabilized whipped cream using the dissolved gelatin method. I really liked the twist of the very subtle flavors of cream cheese and almond. I will use this frosting very often

Very good minus the Almond Extract.  The first time I made this frosting I used the Almond Extract and it was way too over powering.  The second time I left out the Almond and it was wonderful!

I was surprised this would hold up containing so much whipping cream. I left out a frosted cupcake overnight and the frosting is still perfect. It had a little too much cream cheese flavor, though. Next time I'd add more vanilla. Surprising and tasty.

I followed the recipe as written and it tasted great.  I chilled the beaters and bowl first to make sure it whipped up well.  It was easy and quick but the reason I gave it a 4 is because it was out of the refrig a few hours and did not hold up well at all.  The weather was cool, too, so that wasn't the problem.  It just needs refrigeration.

Excellent recipe. I will adapt this for every cake I make in the future. I increased the sugar - using 1 cup powdered sugar. I also used all coconut extract and sprinkled the top of my Cream of Coconut cake with coconut. A wonderful birthday cake for my 19-year-old son. Delicious. My daughter put in her request for the chocolate version but I don't think I can wait until her birthday to try it.

The taste and texture of this frosting compensates for its lack of sturdiness.  Its really sweet and light but I worry about it sitting at room temperature.

This is the best frosting ever! I never need to hunt for another fluffy frosting again. Aside from halving the recipe (I didn't need to fill the cake), I followed it exactly, and it turned out wonderfully. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Hands down the best whipped cream I have ever had!! It reminds me of the same whipped cream that Jason's Deli uses for their strawberry shortcake.  I adjust it for my preference, only used 40z (half) of cream cheese and 1 cup (half) of heavy cream.  Everything else I kept the same and followed the instruction.  I had enough for a 9x13 pound cake I made for strawberry shortcake.  I assembly the cake with the whipped cream and put in the refrigerator. I can't wait until dessert time tomorrow!  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

For those that said it was too runny - I think they needed to just beat/mix it more.  I made a double batch and it took a good 5 minutes (give or take) to get to the right consistency.  
I made this with my $15 Walmart mixer, so you don't need a "good" mixer as the recipe suggests.
I made 2 13x9 white cake mix (added TBSP almond extract to make it taste kinda home-made), layered this frosting in the middle and on top, and topped with sliced almonds and fresh strawberries.  I've never had so many compliments!

This was really good!!!! I like it that it doesn't contain butter or margerine!!! I was going to decorate a cake and relized I did not have confectioner's sugar in my pantry - So this recipe really worked out great! I kept it non-dairy - so I used non dairy whip and tofuti cream cheese. The texture was nice and light and not overly sweet! It also maintained its shape when I decorated the cake (Giant Chocolate Chip Cookie" recipe from this site!) I did add about 2 tsp corn starch - I don't know if it helped or not - but I thought I needed a little something just to maintain the shape. If I were to use this recipe just to frost a cake - I would not add anything. I used lemon extract in place of the almond and vailla extract. I whipped the whole thing for a very long time to get it quite thick. I also added some cocoa powder to a small amount of the frosting to make chocolate frosting. - The texture was obviously asturdier than the origonal recipe - but I did not like the taste. Overall - a fantastic recipe - and I will be using this again!

The taste of this recipe is a 5-starer. It would be very good to simply cover a cake. However, I would not use this recipe to do any decorating, learn from my mistake. It does warm and and get a bit melty looking.

Came together quickly and easily and held up well at room temperature. With the leftovers, I added more cream and whipped it all together, and it tasted just like cool whip.

Wow! I made this for my child's birthday strawberry cake. Totally STURDY. I decorated it on a cake tray and put a glass dome over it.I drove a half hour from home with the AC blowing on it in the front seat (buckled in the seatbelt). It totally held up perfectly. I used chilled softened cream cheese. Everyone was raving and 2 people were fighting over the last piece. Thank you for the recipe.

Super easy to make.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 for a batch of cupcakes.  I used powdered sugar, but next time will try white sugar as the recipe calls... wasn't as sweet as we would have liked.  Would be perfect for a dip for fruit or as a binder for fruit salad.

I loved this recipe. You get the light flavor of the whip cream but have he sturdiness of buttercream. Just the right amount of sweetness and very easy to make.

That reviewer is WRONG! About there can't be any fat when whipping the cream? Absolute bs! There is FAT in the cream!! She's talking about egg whites and angel food cake!! Not whipped cream! The main thing you need to keep an eye on is what type of cream you buy! I noticed w/ my store brand "heavy cream" ive had difficulties getting it to the consistency I want  I think they are watering down the cream now more than ever!! Your best bet and more expensive is to buy heavy whipping cream!! You will get better results with this recipe! Because there is MORE fat in heavy whipping cream ?? Also adding a whipped cream stabilizer to the cheaper cream like dr. Oetker whip it or cornebys ez gel ( same as whip it but without added sugar) Helps to ensure everything stays together I call it insurance!! Lol I always add a stabilizer just to be safe especially when I'm using cheaper cream. The cream cheese itself already has thickener and guar gum it which helps to keep the icing together. Also I rarely have trouble with name brand heavy cream just store brand! Land o lakes and dean's ( my fav) always worked for me

I wish I read the reviews and watched the video first! The cake in the video looks soft NOT sturdy (what I perceive as sturdy)  and the frosting wasn’t  piped. Although, had I watched the video I wouldn’t  have made the frosting which taste great and would be excellent as a dip and/or fruit tart.
I had better results than some of the other reviewers probably because I did a few things differently:
1. I didn’t have time to let the cream cheese soften and cubed it in 8 chunks 
2. Before I added the heavy cream to the combined ingredients I put the mix, bowl and all, in the freezer for about 5 minutes 
Four (4) hours later the peaks look thick and sturdy, but quickly softened (dip consistency) when I applied it to a cup cake ?? 
It tastes great!!

This is my go-to whipped cream for most needs. Not overly sweet and it is more sturdy. I usually don't add all the cream cheese. I have always follwed the directions, and it does whip. The only time I've had a problem was when the bowl or cream was not cold before whipping.

It never firmed up.  I read somewhere afterward that you should whip the whipping cream first then add the cream cheese.  Anyway, I will not be trying this recipe again.  It was more like a drizzle than a frosting.  The only good part was that it was't too sweet.  My family liked that.

The frosting was very tasty and easy to make. I liked it a lot, but I had to add liquid Splenda to make it sweeter, since with vanilla and a little sugar alone it wasn't very sweet.

This has got to be one of the best frostings I've ever made or tasted!  So light and fluffy yet holds up without melting at room temp.  The flavor is to die for!  Definitely my go to frosting from now on!

I loved this and would not change a thing!  I hate, just hate, when people rewrite the recipe like they are some renowned baking expert.  This was submitted because the baker felt it was good enough to share, which it is.  If you want to submit your own version of someone else's recipe, do so.  It is a real turn off when I start reading reviews and see a page of changes.  I think it is inconsiderate and rude.  But that's just me.

This is quickly becoming my favorite frosting. Not overly sweet and holds up to decorating.  I wanted chocolate frosting, so I added 1/2 box of sugar free chocolate pudding mix. Great flavor and added firmness without extra sugar. My friends and family want it on everything!

I used 8oz of cream cheese with 1 1/2 c. Of heavy whipping cream (I was making way to much if I added all ) like the others I had trouble with the sturdyness ..but overall this is a simple unique recipe that I will be using again. The extra cream cheese made it perfect for my pumpkin pie cheesecake bars.

Very nice. The cream cheese adds a nice bite to the frosting. Can't speak to the sturdiness of it (the cake didn't last long), but definitely tasty.

This frosting is exactly what I needed! I made a lemon cake and was looking for a simple frosting that wouldn't deter from the fresh lemon flavor of the cake. I did use confectioners sugar only because I always do with my whipped cream. I only used half a package of full fat cream cheese because that's what I just happened to have in the fridge and I omitted the almond extract just because this was going on a lemon cake. I would definitely make this again!

This is my go-to frosting!  I love the fact that it's not too sweet..it has just the right amount of sweetness for my extended family.  I've made it several times and the only thing I have done differently on a few occasions is the extracts....I was out of almond & used all vanilla and I've also substituted orange or lemon. Aside from that, I've followed the recipe exactly & have had great success each time. I really don't understand the problems some seem to be having..perhaps an altitude issue? Also, it is NOT a piping frosting so I can see how some people may be disappointed in that. Anyway, bottom line, it's a delicious & not too sweet frosting!!!

Made per the recipe and this frosting is delicious.  Very light and not real sweet.  Holds up nicely.

I added in powdered sugar instead of white sugar and doubled the amount because I wanted it sweeter.   I don't know what went wrong for other people, but I used a cold bowl for adding the cream and only added a bit at a time while making sure that it was mixed fully before adding more cream.  It turned out fantastic!

Don't know how this can have so many good reviews. I whipped up the heavy cream separately in a clean dry bowl to stiff peaks, but when I mixed everything together I ended up with runny whipped cream. Even refrigerated it was runny. Could not use and had to run to the store to buy a can of frosting.

I can't believe just how delicious this whipped cream frosting is. Not too sweet and it is firmer than whipped cream and totally spreadable on my sons birthday cake.  I took the advice of some and whipped my sugar (yes it is cane sugar and not confection) and put vanilla in whipped it up first then added it to my cold stainless steel mixing bowl that I put it in the freezer. I added the heavy cream very very slow letting it mix in before adding more.  Thank you! I'll make this all the time now!

I just made this. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. Very stiff. Not sure why other people had trouble. I love that it's not too sweet. I hate most frostings and cakes that are made up mostly of sugar. Just follow the recipe and you should have no problems. Taste great.

Maybe I did something wrong or got the wrong type of almond extract but mine ended up tasting too much like a bitter amaretto instead of like a plain frosting. It did hold up quite well but didn’t love the taste at all.

I wanted a fall flavor and so I made some changes! First I used Neufchâtel cheese instead of cream cheese because I like the flavor of it better. Then I added approx 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg for some fall flavor. I also dusted the cupcakes with cinnamon sugar. This is a DELICIOUS recipe!

First, I'd like to correct an earlier reviewer:  it is egg whites that should be free of grease when whipped, not whipping cream, which is, after all, very high in fat itself. That's the reason for the five star review; in hopes that others would see this erroneous information.  (I'm an experienced baker, both professional and home.)  As far as this recipe is concerned, it did not work for me at all.  I wish I could figure out why, though I suspect if I'd whipped the cream and stabilized it, then folded it into the cream cheese and sugar, I'd have had better luck.  The taste, thought, IS wonderful, and it does make superb fruit dip.  I may try it again.

This recipe is a hit! It is especially great for people who don't like a lot of frosting, something too sweet or something heavy on their cupcakes. I often add either gel or liquid color depending on what I am making it for. I get so many complements every time I make cupcakes or cakes with this frosting.

Tasted good, light and creamy but, it did not hold its shape.   I did whip it to stiff peaks but it melted pretty quick anyway.

I made this recipe exactly the way it’s listed, mixing the ingredients all together at one time, and it turned out perfect! The only mistake I made, which ended up not being a problem, was not mixing the cream cheese and sugar together first to make it smooth. I had a few tiny specks of cream cheese in the finished frosting. I didn’t have any issues with it not whipping or forming stiff peaks. I wouldn’t have been able to pipe with it, but it was definitely thicker and firmer than just whipped cream. It spread beautifully and held its shape very well. Best of all, it was so delicious!

I whipped the cream first then slowly added it with the mixer on low to the cream cheese mixture, I didn't have the almond.  Everyone loved it, light and fluffy, lasted in place for days.  Not too sweet, just creamy.  I used regular cream cheese.

Followed the instructions to whip cream separately and fold in the cream cheese after and that worked like a charm.

I made this for some Almond Joy Cupcakes and it was fantastic! Mine wasn't super sturdy but I recently moved and haven't unboxed my hand mixer yet and had to whip this by hand! Whew! But I was still able to get it mostly sturdy and the taste is amazing! The only changes I did was switch the amount on the vanilla and almond flavoring to give it that extra almond flavor.

This is my favorite frosting to make for cakes. It is not overly sweet and is super light. I was experimenting with the recipe and added 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder to make a chocolate version of this recipe :9

Would definitely make again. Used low fat Cool Whip in place of whipping cream, trying to lower calorie intake.

I added a little more cream, just to increase volume as I was covering a 4 layer cake. Very good flavor - tastes more like a cream cheese frosting - but much lighter. Will definitely make it again!

I have made this frosting many times. I make is as directed, but I add 1 packet of non-flavored gelatin in right before I start pouring in the heavy cream. This frosting  gets rave reviews every time I make it. I’ve used it as a tiered cake frosting, but also as a side dish for people to add on as they like. Everyone askes for the recipe. It really is fabulous!

This is my go-to frosting! I absolutely love it, and so does everyone that tries it! It always looks beautiful on my desserts. The only thing I do differently is omit the almond extract, since we're not too fond of the flavor. Just be careful not to over whip it. I definitely recommend it!

Delicious frosting. I decided to use this on top of a cheese cake for decoration because it was more firm than fresh whipped cream. It turned out perfect and delicious.

I prefer using half a cup of powdered sugar rather than the white sugar.  I adore this frosting as it is not heavy or too sweet.  Works very well with the chocolate cake made with hot water.  This is my go to for most family gatherings.

I whipped the cream with a small amount of half powdered sugar and half granulated sugar first and then added the vanilla and almond extract, then set aside in the fridge. I then whipped the cream cheese in a separate bowl with the remaining sugar. I first folded a small amount of the whipped cream into the whipped cream cheese, and then slowly folded in the remaining whipped cream. This icing held up well and was also easy to pipe words into a cake. It is also not too sweet, which I like.

If I could rate it ten stars, I would. This frosting is incredible. I made it to dollop over pineapple upside down cake but substituted a few drops of lime extract in place of the almond. What a winner with the pineapple. And it held the peaks for over two days. I kept it in the refrigerator until ready to use and put it on the cake at room temperature. Held up incredibly well. Will definitely make it again and again using different flavored extracts.

absolutely fantastic recipe i played around with it a bit but its good if followed to a tee if your not a big fan of almond extract or have allergies this is just as good with just vanilla  but the almond extract does give it a little extra something. now a favorite for  every birthday cake request i get. this does stay sturdy at room temperature but be careful to cool your cakes completely because it will melt on hot cakes ( but if put on hot cakes intentionally its still very yummy melty creamy goodness)

This has been my go-to recipe for frosting for years! Only thing I change is substituting the almond extract for more vanilla. One of the ways we really enjoy eating this is with our fruit! Just chop up all of your fruit, put it into a big bowl and add this whipped goodness to it and you have a fruit salad people will be talking about for days!

Followed the directions, ended up with a liquid mess. Second attempt went better but the flavor was really gross-the cream cheese overpowers everything else. Would not recommend.

made it but never so pertubed. Froze the mixer bowl and beaters. Eliminated the almond extract. could not get this to form peaks. Flavor was there but not a peak in sight with almost 20 min mixing time. Turned making my lemon into a poke cake a pouring this miv over the top.

The taste was delicious, but like some of the reviews, mine never stiffened up. Before I even finished icing my cake the icing was practically sliding off. I now have it in the fridge with rest of the icing to hopefully stiffen enough to save the cake. I went completely by the recipe, even stopping to scrapensure the bottom of the bowl.

Followed recipe as written. The frosting is not as stable as I would like it to be (could be because I did not whip long enough or my measurements were off slightly). I piped the frosting on cupcakes and the day after the edges softened up a bit. I enjoy the taste of the cream cheese followed by the almond extract. It adds more depth to the flavor of the frosting.

Made this today. My daughter and her fiance were coming to dinner. I followed the advice of one reviewer and added cream of tarter, used powdered sugar instead of granulated, and most importantly separated the whipped cream and folded it in last. This is an amazing tasting frosting and looked beautiful on my cupcakes. Comes out bright white and held up nicely. The family loved it, could get my husband to stop eating it out of the bowl. Will definitely be making this again.

I just LOVE this frosting! I have made it several times and yes, CHILL your stainless bowl and beaters!!!  I use this for all my fruit filled cakes as it is light and not overly sweet! It's especially good on my Cannoli cake!I will try to add some chocolate to it and use it as a faux mousse filling. Fingers crossed! Thanks for this lovely recipe.

I followed the recipe as written except I used full fat cream cheese because that's what I had on hand. It was very easy to make and I didn't have any problems with getting peaks.  It is softer than butter cream so I don't think it could be used for the same type of decorating but it could probably be used with a large tip on cupcakes. Loved the lightness of this-give it a try!

Just to confirm, it is 1/2 a cup of powdered (icing) sugar right??
Also, if I skip the almond extract and replace with vanilla how would it be?

This is SUPER watery. I tried making two batches. One where I followed the recipe to a tee. And another where I read some reviews and followed other suggestions. All I did was end up wasting a lot of precious food. I am quite disappointed.

Texture came out great and I was able to easily pipe onto cupcakes. I wasn't crazy about the cream cheese taste though. Most likely will not make again. I want one that tastes like whipped cream, not whipped cheesecake.

This was THE best frosting I have made so far! I did have to double the recipe though because I had more than 24 cupcakes, but it held up well and I was able to pipe it! The other frostings I have made (with butter) seem to not hold well or have that melting-grainy look. This one was the best. I do recommend putting your whisk and mixing bowl in the freezer for about 30 min-1 hour  before you whip the heavy cream though.

I use this all the time. I make over 200 cupcakes a month and this is my go to frosting. I pipe it  on, it pipes beautifully. It is easy to add other flavoring such as maple syrup and carmel.

Came out amazing ! Used vanilla only (was out of almond).  Used on top of the chocolate whole wheat cake from 100daysofrealfood. Used full fat cream cheese. *(update) made a 2nd batch adding 4 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder - for chocolate).

Easy to make, great for piping.  Does taste a little like cream cheese frosting which my son loved, my husband not as much. Maybe next time I will try with marscapone cheese and see what the flavor is like. Very good recipe though!

This is a great recipe, it's not sweet and I love the little tart that the cream cheese gives it. I added 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar for stability, others wise this is  great recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Make sure you whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks before combining it with the cream cheese mixture. Works great as a frosting, and any leftovers (ha!) can serve as a wonderful dip for fruit and cookies.

It wouldn't t set up. Very runny. Something important is missing from this recipe. I couldn't even spread it it just ran off so piping wasn't even an option.

It was really tasty and held up well outside the fridge like it said it would. I made no adjustments and while I enjoyed it, I do have to say that you feel the presence of the cream cheese and for certain recipes that's not always something you want. I will probably use this recipe when I want a light and fluffy CREAM CHEESE frosting

The frosting was sloppy, not sturdy at all. It never stiffened up, even after an overnight in the fridge. Ended up buying store bought frosting for the other batch of cupcakes. I followed the recipe except more vanilla in place of almond due to an allergy. Bummer!

I love this recipe.  It is my go to frosting and I always receive compliments on it!  The only changes I made was to use regular cream cheese ( I tend to steer clear of reduced/low fat items), and I usually cut out the almond extract so the frosting will go anything :)

Total disaster.  I made this exactly as written.  It was not sturdy but instead was a runny glob that would not pipe.  It was very loose and I couldn't do a thing with it.

This icing was wonderful.  It will become my go-to recipe. The only change I have made is to omit the almond extract. Vanilla carries the recipe just fine.  I am, however, going to try it with coffee extract.

Tasted great. I ended up having to use more sugar than it called for so it would thicken up. I'm sure it was my fault somehow. Either way, it was really good.

I just made this and it is so light so fluffy, not too sweet rating it four stars to see how it will hold up if it truly is a sturdy as they say which I'm hoping it is thank you for sharing.

UPDATE: 10/1/16

I made this for the black magic cupcakes posted by Jo-ann; the frosting did not disappoint. I made it w/rum extract as I did not have almond on hand. It was a hit at our church potluck. One of the teens said the frosting tasted like ice cream, and I had several recipe requests. This is my go-to frosting recipe. Thank you for sharing -- I do so prefer homemade frosting vs. store bought. Thanks again!

This was a LIFESAVER yesterday when stabilising cream with gelatin didn't work out for me. This cream stays beautifully light and white despite the vanilla, and held up beautifully on a 2 hour journey. Whenever I need a light topping for cakes now, I will turn to this.

Love this frosting!  Its terrific with red velvet cake & cupcakes. Qupcake's tips of adding 1 tsp of cream of tarter to the whipping cream and using confectioners sugar in place of granulated sugar are smart -they make the frosting studier.  Took 2 dozen cupcakes with this frosting to a shower and got raves about the frosting.

I followed the recipe as stated, with the exception of using regular cream cheese. It turned out as described, and I had no problems with the frosting breaking. One reviewer stated that you cannot whip whipping cream with any fat in the bowl, but this is incorrect. Heavy whipping cream is mostly fat. They seem to be mixing it up with egg whites. You do not need to follow the longer directions, just make sure you add the whipping cream slowly, and use a mixer!

Light, mousse-like texture and very delicious!  I used regular cream cheese (note to those who stated the frosting was a bit "tangy"- I find that the reduced fat cream cheese has a slightly tangy, less smooth taste than regular cream cheese).   I added about 1/4 cup of cocoa which resulted in a very light coffee colored frosting.  I beat all the listed ingredients except the whipped cream into one bowl, and like many other readers, whipped the whipping cream along with about 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar separately after chilling the bowl and the beaters for about 30 minutes.  I folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture and immediately frosted my cake.  This recipe makes plenty to cover a two layer round cake.  I have added this to my box and will try with pineapple extract on carrot cake, maybe a little raspberry jam on chocolate cake or even a bit of instant coffee with cocoa for a mocha flavored frosting for chocolate cake.

Awesome! Made this to top a homemade rootbeer ice cream cake. Didn't have 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar so I used 1 cup powdered sugar, and didn't want the almond taste im my rootbeer cake so I used all vanilla extract. It whipped up nice and thick and stayed firm throughout candles and th birthday song.

I absolutely love this recipe. I only had maple extract and it was awesome. It's my favourite icing ever.

I made this with low fat strawberry cream cheese, for a strawberry shortcake (less sugar, no almond extract). It turned a 'pretty pink', and was delicious: beautifully  textured...thick!!!
It kept its shape forever in the fridge (1wk), even with chopped strawberries on top. That would never work with plain whipped cream.   ??This is staying in my best recipie book.
More experiments to come: different cream cheese/ extract flavours, peanut butter powder (?!), etc.

This icing was a hit at the party I brought cupcakes to. To get it to stay stiff, I did a double recipe and while pouring in the heavy cream I didn't pour the whole amount in. I left maybe a 1/4 cup out and that seemed to keep it from falling.

I whipped the cream separately and added it last as other recommended; that seemed the safest course of action.  It tastes heavenly and really is sturdy.  I topped cupcakes for a party with this fabulous frosting and it held up beautifully.  I refrigerated the left overs and three days later they still look great.   You can't pipe this into flower and letter decorations, but you can use a big star tip and swirl it onto a cupcake (if you were good and actually let the cream cheese come to room temperature before beating...if you were bad like me, then you might need a big open round tip because the little unbeaten bits of cold cream cheese will clog the star tip.)   I believe it will spread nicely on a cake too; I'm going to try that next!

I made it lemon flavored instead. Unfortunately, my lemon extract was a little too old and it had a metallic taste, so added some vanilla extract and a bit more sugar. That helped a bit, so I put it on the cake anyways. The texture was great! Very easy to make, too.

Super delicious.  I don't know that I would use it to frost a cake as it isn't very sweet as is.  I wound up using 2 cups confectioners sugar and no almond extract (didn't have any, just used all vanilla).  Anyway, even before I added the extra sugar, I had no trouble whipping this into a nice consistency.  The directions are fine.  Slowly add the cream and whip.

This is the first time I have left a review and I love this frosting!  I have been looking for A frosting that is not so sweet and this is it!  I did follow the recommendation to  whip the cream first in cold bowl with cream of tarter and use powder sugar instead of granulated sugar added to cream cheese and it worked out great thanks for that tip and I will be making this over and over

I hunted high and low for this recipe again, used it for Christmas and needed to use it again. I do love the taste of almond so that and vanilla I doubled but otherwise followed the recipe. It was delicious and easy to pipe out on to cupcakes.

It came out perfect! I did add atleast 1/4 c more sugar to tone down the cream cheese taste. It still does taste like cream cheese when I was looking for more of a milky flavor but it's still yummy! It's stuff enough to pipe and stays on the cake at room temp. Will make again.

I don't like whipped cream frosting and I've never made any before but my daughter loves it and it's her birthday today so I gave this one a try and it's actually very good. She loves it and my husband couldn't keep his fingers out of it. It was so good he wants me to make just the frosting so he can eat it alone. Great recipe.

I made it according to the recipe. Next time I think I would leave out the almond extract as I didn't like the taste with the cream cheese. It was not a failure however . It looked  very nice and fluffy and held its shape! I  tinted the frosting blue for a baby shower!  Hopefully the gals will like it!

I made it the way that one reviewer suggested, by making the whipped cream first in one bowl, then creaming the remaining ingredients together in another then folding them together.  It turned out perfect!  It was a perfectly light frosting that looked great (I piped it on my cupcakes but not in a real decorative way).  The frosting looked good and tasted good while the cupcakes sat out during the entire three hour party--now weird film on the outside or "wilting" like sometimes happens with plain whipped cream frosting.  My guests and I loved the flavor.  I will definitely be making this again.  
I only gave it four stars since I felt I had to change my method of making it to what was in a review rather than what was in the directions in order to get it to turn out great.  I applaud the original creator for coming up with this idea though.
By the way, in my experience one recipe can frost approximately four dozen cupcakes, less if you like to tower your frosting on top.

Perfect! (I used organic cane sugar.) I substituted this  recipe in place of the store bought chemical laden junk that comes in a tub, you know what I'm talking about ~ lol.  No more fake cream  topping for me.  It held up great.  Thanks!

I read the reviews before making this because it appeared that the recipe as written had some issues. So, I took the advice of a few and I made the whipped cream (and cream of tartar) separately from the cream cheese mixture and then folded them together. I used about 1 1/2 C of sugar and omitted the almond (just didn't have any). 

This is really good, not too sweet and the whipped cream cuts down on the cream cheese tang. I'll make this again but I'll try with powdered sugar instead of regular sugar. The consistency is more of a whipped cream then a frosting. It's really quite light but it spreads OK.

Worked like a charm. I used a cold bowl as many suggested. Started out w/cream cheese just lightly softened, full fat, as it's what I had. Added a couple of tsp of fresh lime juice and zest (It's going on a lime and white cake), a tsp of almond extract, and about 1/2 C of powdered sugar. When it was combined, I added the heavy cream about 1 C at a time. Whipped until I had the consistency of frosting. Added about 1/4 C more powdered sugar too. Great, lighter frosting for my lime poke cake. Thanks!

This is wonderful icing.   I made just like recipe stated except no almond extract bc of allergies.  Just put a dash more vanilla.  
I'm looking forward to experimenting with it. Next time I'm going to add cocoa and rum!

I used full instead of reduced fat cream cheese, but this a wonderful recipe! I tried it for my son's first birthday cake and it was a huge hit with everyone. I've made it several times since then, great for summer time desserts. I plan on making this frosting again for my daughter's first smash cake. ?? I've recommended this recipe to friends and family, and those who have made it, enjoyed it also. Great share!!

I never post reviews, but this recipe is by far the best I have ever had! It's the only one I will make now. I love it! I could just eat it out of the bowl without the cake. So creamy and smooth and excellent texture. I would give it more stars if I could. Wonderful! You must try it.

Recipe is not sturdy at all. Very disappointed I didn't try it before hand. It's very watery can't even   frost it onto cupcakes. I tried adding more cream cheese and didn't work.  I'll just stick to my standard whipped recipe which works way better.  Whipping cream and sugar. Don't waste your money and time with this recipe

I feel as if I struck gold. Goodness was this the best recipe ever! So easy, cheap and effortless! After many tried and failed attempts to make a good heavy  whip, this one (in first attempt) was like  a miracle. Not a lie when I said I almost did a tap dance. My son's cookie sandwich cake is already a go! Thank you soooooooooo much for this recipe!

This works great for making the whipped topping "stand" a little longer and still keeping it light and not-greasy. I've even piped bigger flowers or other not-so-intricate designs and it worked just fine.

I got mixed feedback on taste. I (and some others) loved the flavor of the cream cheese. Hubby and some others didn't like it "as much as the other one" i.e. just whipped cream frosting.

So, be aware that the cream cheese does alter the taste. Whether you like it or not is your choice.  But this is a lovely frosting recipe!

I was looking for a light frosting that I could easily adapt to alternate sugars (my father became allergic to cane sugar a few years ago) and decorate the edges of my already delectable sugar-sub cheesecakes and this works beautifully! Just be careful if you, like me, are using alternate sweeteners--the frosting's flavor is so light that using just Splenda gives it a slightly odd flavor.

This is a great frosting! I use powdered sugar because I like the texture better, but otherwise make as is. It's not good for piping, but it's great for frosting and as a fruit dip.

I made this to top red velvet cupcakes and it was quick and easy to make.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar because I didn't  think it was sweet enough.  It tastes like a fresh whipped  cream with a hint of cream cheese.  Would make again.

I have a catering business and we use this not only for icing but as a fruit dip. Everyone loves it . You can change the flavor by using different extracs.

A good recipe with regards to flavor. It was also sturdy enough to ice a sponge. I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and whipped the cream separately  and used cream of tartar to stabilize it. I probably won't use this recipe again because it really just tastes like a sour cream frosting, and sour cream frosting actually holds up better on the cake.

Turned out great!  I didn't have any of the problems others talked about with the consistency. The only change I would make is the almond extract. Even with a chocolate mocha cupcake I'm tasting way too much of the almond extract. Next time I will either cut the amount in half or cut it all together. Otherwise, this frosting is wonderful!

I followed a reviewer suggestion to add cream of tarter as a stabilizer. That was a mistake for me -- added unexpected tartness and icing tasted tangy like a cream-cheese icing, which I did not want. Not this recipe's fault -- mine. And now I know that cream of tarter is as good as its name! Tasted 3 stars but giving 4 for human error.

This recipe is the best whipped cream frosting I have made to this day. Is exactly as it is described. Completely sturdy, not at all milky our way to creamy. it's the perfect frosting for any cupcake or cake topping.

Amazing texture and flavor! it wasn't too "cheesy" and more creamy and fresh so I guess it can go great with any cake! I dyed it using gel colors and the color turned out amazing. It didn't melt at room temperature but started to in a warmer weather (~30 degrees C). I suggest you refrigerate the cake decorated with it for a while before eating as this will help it keep the cream shape longer. I didn't use almond extract, just all vanilla.

All the people stating this frosting didn't work must have over whipped it! I just tried this recipe and I even added food color to it and it was perfect. Bowl and beater were room temp. Made no difference what so ever. I think the error is not the recipe but the  error was in execution. I will use this in place of buttercream every time. It is less sweet lighter and works well. We have made a few wedding cakes and wish we would have known about this recipe.

Loved this!!! We had an outdoor party for my one year old's birthday and the whipped cream stood up to the heat. We wanted a frosting that wasn't really sweet like buttercream and this fit the bill. Also, I know it wasn't made for piping onto a cake but I did and it came out beautifully!

My husband loves whipped cream frosting, but I've never been able to get it right. This recipe did the trick! I used only vanilla (no almond) but other than that followed to the letter. It came out PERFECT. Made icing and iced the cakes about three hours before serving. Put cake in the fridge. Delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again and again. THANK YOU!

After reading all the negative reviews about it not holding stiff peaks, I used 1 cup powdered sugar instead of white sugar and it worked fine. Really held up for outdoor summer dessert I made.

I had no problems with this frosting. I did, however, start off with cold cream cheese.  Not room temperature or softened. Be careful to stop beating the after you add the cold whipping cream as soon as the mixture gets stiff.  Overbeating will cause it to break and not hold up.  You must use both vanilla and almond extract, because it has sort of an odd flavor with just the vanilla.  I piped the frosting onto cupcakes and they came out beautiful.  It is a nice light frosting option and less sweet than traditional buttercream.

I found out the hard way that it is very important to use low-fat cream cheese. The regular cream cheese has too much oil in it and the frosting would not set up well enough to sit-up on the cupcake. It is very tasty and made a great dip.

I've made this 3 times now and every time it came out perfect.  My husband doesn't like very sweet frosting so this is perfect, and it's easy enough to add a little more sugar is you like it sweet.  I was able to pipe it using a large ziploc bag because I didn't have a piping bag. I'm going to attempt to make a raspberry version of it today.

I followed this recipe exactly with one exception; I used standard cream cheese not reduced fat cream cheese. I followed every thing else exactly and the frosting turned out fabulous! I've made it 4 times now and would not change any thing. Next time I will try adding cocoa like one of the participants and will let you know what I think.

Awful.  I served this for Easter dinner dessert.  We love whipped icing, but everyone agreed that it has a weird taste.  The Almond flavoring and cream cheese flavors do not mingle well.

This frosting is fantastic! It works perfectly on my pineapple coconut cake. I use the leftover frosting as a fruit dip! Delicious!

I tried this recipe on Christmas Eve. White cake with strawberries...I am still getting raves about how good it was!
It was easy (less than 5 minutes...I did omit almond extract and added a little extra vanilla). I can't wait to make it again!!

Awesome!! Followed mixing directions, except mixed cream cheese, sugar and extract together first.  Then put in ice cold bowl and beat in whip cream and added 1/2 teaspoon of dissolved gelatin to stabilize.  Incredible flavor. Did not use almond extract, doubled vanilla.  This one is a keeper!!!!

I just made this recipe...I don't know where the word sturdy comes in here, but this is NOT  a sturdy frosting. I followed the recipe exactly and it was still too runny, so I added an entire 2lb bag of powdered sugar to it just to try and save the batch and all it was still not stiff enough to use on cupcakes, or to even frost a cake for that matter. I will not be using this again.

This recipe was fantastic! I did make a few changes tho and that was instead of regular cream cheese I done it with strawberry cream cheese and yum! I put about a tablespoon of vanilla and the 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and for those of who are having issues with the firmness this is what I done which is what some viewers did as well. Make sure you wash out your METAL bowl and beaters and dry them and then stick them in th freezer for about 10 mins or longer, I also washed out another bowl and dried it and put in the freezer for about 10 mins and brought it out  and beat my cream cheese until smooth and no lumps and then I stuck 1/2 cup of sugar at a time until you get 11/2 cups of sugar and then I stuck my vanilla and almond extract in and beat and when I got done doing that I put my bowl of cream cheese inside of another bowl full of hot water and mixed again to make sure of no lumps (it seems like alot of work but it's not) and when I got done doing that then I got my METAL bowl out and whipped out the heavy cream and then I folded the cream cheese in with the cream and it stayed firm and was very easy to pipe onto cupcakes and very  good thank you for the recipe it's a for sure keeper

Great , tried it for Great Granddaughters 1st Birthday cake, It was a hit.Easy, good flavor and held up perfect..I did use a metal bowl to mix it up in and had all my utensils cold as well. I didn't use the almond flavoring , just added more vanilla.

The taste to the frosting was delicious , however the consistency was not thick enough. Next time I will try gelatin powder. For flavor I give it four stars but two stars for sturdiness.

This was fantastic. Just as advertised. Lighter than butter cream and standard cream cheese frosting, sturdier and richer than whipped cream. Perfect middle-of-the-road option. This will become my go-to for cupcakes. Would be delicious with any other extracts in place of the almond. I think I'll try coconut next!

The bit about having a good mixer is an  excellent suggestion. As I have learned, a blender is a terrible substitute. The sloppy but delicious liquid I created would have been a wonderful frosting given a competent cook/baker with the most basic electric  mixing device. Alas, this recipe found neither tonight.

Excellent  I used 1&3/4 cups confectionary sugar. Little soft for decorating . I will use either more confectionary sugar or less cream next time. Only used vanilla extract   2 tsps Best tasting frosting  I have ever made. Everyone loved it adults & children. Not too sweet . Children decorated with a cherry & red sugared sprinkles . Great  for valentines day.

I liked the flavor and that it was not too sweet, however it was not all that sturdy and was difficult to eat the cupcake because it was too soft.  some melted off the cupcake right after coming out of the fridge.  If I was having a formal event, I would have been disappointed but for the family it was fine, because they liked the flavor. I made one with fresh lemon juice instead of vanilla and it tasted amazing and held up a little better than the classic version.

This cream cheese whipped cream is amazinG!!! I made it with All Recipe's Rach56 Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe!  The only issue I have is that it doesn't remain sturdy.  After an hour, it was starting to melt.  I've read in previous reviews to add gelatin so I may try that the next time.  Otherwise, great taste.

I made this to frost a white cake for my sister's 6th birthday. I followed this recipe exactly and chilled the bowl and whisk for an hour before starting. The frosting turned out perfect, not too sweet and a touch of tang from the cream cheese. It was really fluffy and kept its shape on room temp. Thank you!

I love this frosting.  It is very similar to mine.  I substitute raw honey in place of the sugar add I am sugar free and do not use sugar substitutes.  For those that need a great,  sugar free frosting,  try it with the raw honey.  Add it a little at a time to get the right amount of sweetness for your taste.  Goes perfect on my sugar free, grain free, carrot cake!

Easy recipe and turned out great.  Only change I would make is to reduce amount or skip the almond extract. I think it was a bit overpowering in this flavor.  I used this recently for pumpkin cupcakes and added 1/4 cup of pumpkin creamer in place of some of the heavy cream.  Turned out great.

Needed to make cupcakes for my daughter's school fundraiser that is once a month called Cupcake Friday and I just loath heavy cupcakes.  I wanted something light and fresh tasting and I love whipped cream toppings!  It was a challenge to find a good one that would hold up and even braver of me to try this recipe on the night before. Wow! Its fresh, light and melts in your mouth! With a super light chocolate cupcake its like eating a flavored cloud! I will use this recipe for frosing from now on!

Great frosting if you are looking for something lighter than buttercream but still has flavor. Make sure cream cheese is at room temp, I also stuck my heavy cream in the freezer for a few minutes before making the frosting. Was able to pipe rosettes with it.

Delicious!  I used the method recommended by others where you beat the cream cheese, sugar, and extract together 1st, then fold in the whipped heavy cream.  I used  a few tablespoons of raspberry jello powder in place of some of the sugar to get a pretty pink raspberry frosting for my daughter's sweet sixteen cake.

This is delicious! I made it the night before, and piped it onto my cupcakes 3hrs. before consumption the next day, with no problems (though they were waiting in an air conditioned room). I did use my paddle attachment first on my Kitchen Aid Mixer for the cream cheese, sugar, and extracts. Then, once that was creamy, changed to the whisk attachment, and added the cream. Once the cream was stiffened up I used a spatula by hand to get the stuff off the bottom mixed together a little better, put it in a Ziploc bag, and then into the fridge. I was afraid it might get runny overnight, but it was perfect!

I made this exactly as written, no modifications. It wasn't sturdy, the flavor was tangy, and my family didn't like it. It may be good for just a fruit dip, I liked the flavor, but needs to be sweeter. I should have read all the reviews first.

Yes, this is the one. I used 3/4 Cup sugar, 1-1/2 tsp clear vanilla extract, full fat cream cheese, chilled whip beater and mixing bowl. I used a stand mixer. Not a bit of cream cheese taste, just whipped cream. I chilled the whipping cream as well. I think the secret is blend the whipping cream in slowly as the mixer runs on medium. Scrape down the bowl and then whip the cream on high for 1-2 min. This is a keeper.

Used this recipe a few times and it is always a hit.  I am thinking about putting it on an ice cream cake, does anyone know if it freezes well or would be good for this application?

Amazing not to rich not to soft like whipped cream. We used it for whoopie pies worked perfect, to keep them from being to heavy and rich. I will be using this on alot of my cakes from now on, due to the fact I think frosting is to rich and heavy.

Omg! This frosting is the bomb!!!... 5 stars all the way!!! Like some of the reviews, i  whipped the heavy cream separately and added my already mixed together cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Folded in lightly and whipped on high for a min or so..I added 1/4 corn starch as I whipped the cream. The result was fantastic! I put bowl with frosting back in my freezer for a few minutes then just scooped as I needed leaving the rest to continue to chill! It was so sturdy! I frosted my cake nicely! I have mixed some with food color gel and will be piping soon! I shall come back with the result of that one! Thanks All recipes! Don't forget to chill your bowl and whip bf! I left mine a long while!

This recipe turned out great!  I made a chocolate cake with strawberries and it made the perfect frosting. I will certainly be using this again and possibly use this as a base for other flavor profiles.

I used this icing for a strawberry shortcake birthday cake.  It was extremely easy to make and tastes great.  It is not too heavy of an icing, or so thin that it wont stay on the cake.

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe. Bad news is the whip cream never set. I tried whisking a little longer but it was still runny. I don't know if I had done something wrong in the process but it just wasn't as impressive as it showed on the video. Thumbs down for me.

I couldn't get my frosting to form stiff peaks.  That may have been maker error though.  True to the claim though, it did not melt.  The taste was ok. It had a tangy milk flavor.  I think it needed more sugar to cover the milk flavor more and sweeten the cream cheese more.

I just used this recipe for a spiced apple layer cake with apple filling and whipped cream frosting. The frosting came out perfect. It's so good we saved the extra to dip strawberries in. Not too sweet, which I love. I WILL be using this recipe again.

I read the reviews and watched the video for this recipe because there were so many reviewers that had an issue with it. I followed it exactly. Following the instructions exactly, it turned out fantastic!!! The sheet cake is beautiful!!  I cannot wait to find other times to use it! Also, I use allrecipes all the time and love to cook. But this is the first recipe I have ever rated. It's just that good.

Frosting is delicious. It holds up well. Not as well as buttercream but for a whipped topping, It's great. Kids might not like it as much because of the tang from the cream cheese and it's not as sweet as the traditional buttercream frosting from bakeries. I added 3/4 cup sugar instead of the 1/2 cup listed. Thanks for the recipe.

I usually think the whipped frosting is somewhat flavorless, not this one! It is amazing, easy to work with and I get rave reviews from all who try it!

Easy to make, and very sturdy. It does not have a strong cream cheese flavour. Next time I make it I think I will only use 1 cup cream.

Great recipe!  I used this for a "flag cake" and it behaved much better than using regular whipped cream.

My new go-to frosting. Everyone loved it! I did not make any changes except half the ingredients because I only had 1 cup of heavy cream. This was the perfect amount to frost a 9x13" cake. It kept its shape overnight and was just sweet enough without being too much.

This is a great frosting, however I think the cream cheese taste overpowers the actual "whipped cream" taste. It is sturdy, it is delicious, but it's more of a whipped cream cheese frosting than a whipped cream!

I've made this frosting twice now, both times for a wonderful fresh strawberry cake. It is so delicious! The texture is nice and thick (and sturdy!), and the flavor is lightly sweet...a perfect complement to cake. I made it again last night for my family Easter gathering and I'm sure it will be a hit. Thank you for this recipe! It will be made repeatedly.

Very good taste however be careful with the serving size. I needed to frost 48 cup cakes so I adjusted the serving size to such and ended up with a huge bowl of yummy frosting I had to toss.

Made this to top the red velvet cupcakes I made for hubby's birthday and got rave reviews! Only thing I changed was used extra vanilla instead of almond essence because we had a few nut-allergy friends with us. It was not really tangy, but had a very subtle fruity flavor. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

LOVE this! I used it for Pineapple Angel Food Cake I on this site, except I substituted coconut extract for almond extract. Simply divine. Make sure you really give it a good whipping once the cream is added, otherwise it WILL liquefy on you.

Delicious, not overly sweet, and frosts beautifully. This was the easiest, smoothest frosting I've ever spread on a cake(and did I say delicious?) I used 8 oz of 'whipped" cream cheese and made it with a hand mixer. Will make this again and again.

Excellent recipe.  Not too sweet but easy toe spread. I used it on a coconut cake and it was just the right texture. I started with room theme low fat cream cheese and used a prechilled bowl. Lovely.

The almond extract is overwhelming.  If that's the taste you're going for, great, but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  The texture is good, but not quite the sweet, tangy cream cheese frosting that I intended.

I always read reviews before trying to make something, both good and bad. I have made this frosting twice now for two different family members birthday cakes. I have absolutely no complaints. The first time I made it just as directed, and it came out stiff and was easy to manipulate. I just made it again adding some peppermint, and my 7yr old nephew LOVED it. I don't know what consistency issues others were having, but both times this has been a wonderful hit.

We all LOVED this frosting, which was also easy to make. Our family prefers to avoid the sickeningly sweet butter cream frostings and this was just perfect. Since finding this recipe, I've adapted it many times over, changing the flavors of the extracts.  Most recently I substituted 1 1/2 tsps of peppermint extract to frost a moist chocolate cake for the holidays, with crushed candy cane on top. This was a big hit. We've also used this frosting to sandwich two cookies together and as a dip for strawberries and raspberries. Yummy always!

I really liked this recipe. The slightly tangy taste paired well with the cherry pie filling I was using in my black forest cake. After reading many reviewers suggestions, I did whip the cream separately and the cream cheese afterward. The cream cheese was still cold, it had been sitting out for only half an hour. It mixed very well into the whipped cream. Again, following other reviewers suggestions, I was verrry careful not to overmix...great results!! My son was delighted with the rosettes I piped and sprinkled generously with shaved dark chocolate! Thanks for sharing!!!

I thought this recipe was just OK. It does come out relativley stable, although I wouldnt recommend it for piping. I substituted powdered sugar for the regular sugar because in my first attempt I thought the sugar made it somewhat gritty. Has a very rich cream cheese flavor a little too much for my liking.

I was looking for a fresh tasting whipped cream that would hold up when "dolloped" onto pumpkin pie.  This worked just right when I tested it  and let it sit for about 15 minutes.  The shape held.  No breakdown.  Perfect!  great taste, light and fresh.  I skipped the almond and just used vanilla extract.  Next batch I am not using extract and using Bourbon... mmmmmm.....

This was sooo good.  I made it as written (placed mixing bowl and wisk attachment in fridge first) and it turned out perfect.  I loved that it wasn't overly sweet.  It was great on homemade banana cupcakes and chocolate cupcakes with crushed oreos on top.  It worked well to pipe onto cupcakes, but probably wouldn't work for small details.  I also wouldn't leave it unrefrigerated for too long.  Thanks for the recipe!

Stop looking for frosting recipes. This is the right one!!!!! For everything!!! It is the best frosting I have EVER made. Perfect for piping, very stable, almost cheesecake like, it was heaven. Not too sweet cause there is not a pound of confectioners sugar in it like buttercream. Use granulated sugar, cold cream cheese, and pour the cream in slowly, it will be perfect and everybody will love you for making it.

This is a perfect FROSTING for fruity filled cakes.  I'm asked to make cakes for parties all the time, and the most popular one is a chocolate cake with strawberry filling, and this FROSTING.  The flavors compliment themselves so well!  Thank you for this recipe!

AWESOME!  I added this to an angel food cake with strawberries for a summer birthday party.
Not one drop was left.  Everyone from 2yr old to 88yr old LOVED IT!
Used 12oz of whipped cream cheese. Vanilla and lemon as I didn't have almond extract.
Will make this frosting FOREVER!

I used all vanilla extract because of an almond allergy. Would make an excellent fruit dip. Makes an ok frosting. The consistancy is good but I feel that it could be a bit sweeter as the tang of the cream cheese really stands out when you're expecting whipped cream.

Used this frosting on the Coconut Poke Cake from this site, which I made using the Simple White Cake recipe also from this site. It was a hit! 
I used my Kitchen Aid Mixer. I did NOT use confectionary sugar like one user said (duh) we should all know is what the author meant.  I actually am quite sure the poster meant white sugar just like he or she indicated...I have several other frosting mixes that are excellent and use white sugar.  You do have to beat it well and it helps to have the stand mixer.  I whipped the heavy cream separately from the cream cheese (used regular cream cheese) sugar and flavorings (I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp coconut for the coconut cake) and then beat them together for just a few seconds.  Delicious.  Really, really light and perfect for the cononut cake I used it on.

Amazing!  Holds up beautifully and the taste is great too! These do not always go hand in hand.  I used regular cream cheese and cut back on sugar just a bit.  On red velvet cupcakes for valentines and now on carrot cake for easter!

This frosting was wonderful with a little tweaking! I added the same amount of cream cheese, sugar, and the extracts, but after adding 1 cup heavy cream it seemed very thin to me. I then added about 4 tablespoons of flour and just a touch more heavy cream (total of 1 pint heavy cream) and it turned out perfect! Great flavor-love the almond flavor! Complemented the german marble cake perfectly!

Best frosting EVER!  It tastes just like whipped cream.  I used marscapone cheese, half a cup of powdered sugar and both vanilla and almond extract.  It has the perfect amount of sweetness and it is very firm.  This frosting will go on every cake and cupcake I bake from now on.  I also plan to use it as a fruit dip.

If you like something that is light - SUPER LIGHT - then this is perfection! It is almost like straight whipped cream in texture.  My family went off on this like crazy.  They LOVED it! For my taste, I will try to add a little something (don't know what) because I wanted it to be just a tiny little bit heavier.

This is a great recipe but I had to tweak it being that I didn't have a few of the ingredients.  Instead of cream cheese I used the equivalent of plain Greek yogurt (healthier??), used 1c of powdered sugar and omitted the almond extract. It turned out stable, light, fluffy and very tasty. I took a picture of it, you can find it on my photos link.  It held up well, but I would not recommend leaving this tweaked recipe at room temp for extended periods of time.  It held up but I didn't test to see how long it would go before breaking down or even if it would.  Try for yourself, I received raves about the taste.

Excellent frosting! Everyone really liked it. Not too sweet and great flavor. I didn't add the almond extract because I didn't have any and personal preference. I also used mascapone cheese instead of cream cheese as others suggested. Cream cheese has a much stronger flavor and didn't want it to interfere with the flavor of the whip cream. It turned out great! I recommend putting this in the fridge for a bit to stiffen up a little before frosting the cake.

I love this so easy but takes time to get it to the stiff peak. I used all almond since I did not have clear vanilla. taste awesome!

This is an excellent alternative to cool whip top type of frosting, used for a black forest cake - superb.  I also used only vanilla flavoring but will venture into others. Added a bit of powdered sugar this time, but planning on using for a carrot cake trifle as is. THANK YOU!

This recipe is amazing!!!  I have never found a frosting that I don't scrape off the cake and not eat, and I don't do that to this one!  The frosting is light and not too sweet, but I don't think it has that tart edge like a cream cheese frosting does.  I have piped it just fine, but use a small batch at a time because your body temp from your hands will melt it.  It stays firm and delicious!!!  Thanks!!!

This frosting turned out wonderfully!  It was perfectly light yet was stiff enough to pipe.  I left the cake out to see how well the frosting would stand up and after 5 hours it still looked good.  There was only one 2 inch section of the border that looked like it was starting to slide.  I also folded in a raspberry compote to make a raspberry mousse filling.  It was so good. My family went bonkers for it and my hubby said to add it to the list of his favorite cakes (and that's saying alot). I did have to make a double batch for a triple layer 9 inch round cake.  Mmmmm!

This is the best frosting I have ever had!! Its the one I go to everytime I need a frosting. I personally dont like almond flavoring in it so I make mine with either all vanilla or I add in a different flavor like lemon or raspberry. Delicious and it pipes so well onto cupcakes!

This is an amazing recipe!  I substituted orange juice for the vanilla and added some grated orange peel and put it on an orange cake.  My son said it tasted like a creamsicle!  It's easy and gets rave reviews.  Doesn't get much better than that!

This worked really well, even though I substituted maple flavoring and used already made whipped topping. Used on homemade doughnuts for maple bars. Delicious.Just beat a 12oz. tub of whip into other ing.

Great frosting! I put it over a chocolate cake and it was a hit with my family!  I used confectioners sugar not granulated sugar.  The recipe did not specify but I always make whipped cream with confectioners sugar so I just did the same for this and it was perfect.

This calls for "white sugar".  This mean Icing sugar, I'm assuming, because I made it with granulated sugar and it would not thicken. Otherwise, it tastes great! I poured it on the cake;)

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I just couldn't get it stiff enough to pipe! I've tried it twice once with gelatin and once with Whip It! I have no idea what I'm doing wrong...I love the flavor though, it's been awesome for just icing cakes and as a fruit dip!!!!! YUUUUMMMMM I just can't pipe with it WHAAAAAAAA ;-(

This was an excellent recipe! I used a full cup of sugar and 2 tsp vanilla extract (no almond extract) and added about a cup of cool whipped topping before adding a pint of heavy whipping cream. I've been looking for a frosting to top a fresh strawberry cake and this was perfect!

Best Whipped Cream frosting ever - can't taste the cream cheese at all, I didn't have low fat, so used standard Philly.  I did use my Kitchen aid with the whisk attachment - chilled the bowl and the whisk for an hour first - Perfect!

This frosting had great flavor, but was definitely not sturdy in my book.  I used a cold bowl and whisk attachment in my Kitchenaid stand mixer, and I never did get it to form a truly stiff peak.  I would say it was a soft peak at best.  It didn't  work for piping or decorating a cake.  I should've taken the advice of some of the other reviewers.  However, it would be great for icing a 9x13 in a baking dish, and it was tasty.

Not bad, was more cream cheese frosting than whipped cream frosting. Not too sweet. It wasn't really what I was looking for for the cake I made. However, it would be good on carrot cake. Also, too much almond flavor... either cut in half or omit.

I must have done something wrong.  The flavor was nice, but I could not get the desired consistency, as in the photos.  It will definitely be necessary to refrigerate the cupcakes I make for the school pary.

Used my kitchen aid with whisk attachment. Followed recipe except omitted the sugar and almond extract for my baby's first birthday cake and it held up perfectly. I never put it in the fridge as I made it about 30 mins before the party. I bet it would have been super yummy with the sugar!! I will be using this on carrot cake. I think it is a perfect cream cheese frosting.  Very light and similar in texture to pastry-pride.  Great to work with.
UPDATE:
Used Neufatel cheese (1/3 less fat) and the frosting did not hold up...it needs the fat!

AMAZING!  I used for my son's first birthday cake and it held up awesome in the warm weather (and all over his face), but best of all, tasted great.  I got many comments on the frosting and everyone got the recipe!  Thank you!

This is a great recipe my only suggestion is to use ready to whip topping like Pastry Pride instead of heavy cream, it will hold up much better and will not turn out soupy like a coulple of comments I saw earlier. Thank You

This was exactly what I needed for my coconut cake.  Wasn't sure which sugar to use, but used confectioner's sugar and it was delicious.  Used a lemon curd filling, frosted the cake with the icing and then put coconut on top and sides.  Took it to a birthday party and everyone raved about it.

If I use this frosting recipe for cupcakes, can they be frozen?  I can decorate cupcakes with cream cheese frosting and they freeze nicely...how about this one??

first time trying this recipe and very disappointed.  even though it says you can use a regular mixer, it doesn't work.  i have a regular mixer and my recipe turned out very soupy.  ended up putting in about another cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and it made it a little thicker.  it will make a great fruit dip, but it will never do what the picture shows! i now have to go to the grocery store to get frosting for cupcakes that i was hoping to use this recipe with.

Very good frosting! I was surprised to have any left for my cake after I was done "sampling" it.  You can really taste the cream cheese, so if you don't like cream cheese this may not be for you.  Went very well with chocolate cake and raspberry sauce!

This was amazing! I made angel food cupcakes and used this as the whip cream, pure heaven. Amazinginly delicious! I didn't use almond extract and instead just used vanilla. Next time I think I'll use some coconut?

This is an awesome recipe! I put together a few loafs of angel food to make a flag cake for the 4th of July!  It went great with the berries! I didn't have any almond extract, so I used some amaretto. Everyone loved it and one person even commented that it is the best cake she's ever had!  I'm going to try and make it with stevia next time for a sugar-free version.  I was afraid to make it based on some of the bad reviews, but it whipped up perfectly!  I'm not sure how it’s possible to mess this up unless you whisk it too much (then it will turn into butter), i.e. the runny curdled mess some people were talking about. Maybe they need to consider using a cold metal bowl and refrigerate the utensils for ten minutes before mixing.

I LOVE this recipe.  I just tried it for the first time for my tiramisu cheesecake experiment.  It's great with a sprinkle of super fine fresh ground coffee to top off the cheesecake.  It was so fast and easy to make too.

Very nice to work with and tastes great! I added a little more sugar than it called for originally. My family and I thought it was just like the whipped frosting that you would order from a professional bakery.

OMG this frosting is awesome!  I made the Williams-Sonoma Coconut Cake with Lime Curd Filling recipe.  However, the frosting recipe that accompanied the cake recipe looked far too sweet for my taste.  I made this recipe instead.  I replaced the vanilla and almond extract with coconut extract and then added sweetened, flaked coconut to the outside of the cake.  It is SO delicious.  This is now my go-to frosting recipe.

This frosting was divine.  The perfect middle ground between buttercream and whipped cream. It was very simple to make and took less than 5 minutes using my KitchenAid mixer. It was sturdy enough for me to pipe clouds on the ends of my rainbow cake with ease and held up well at room temperature. The only change I made was to use all vanilla instead of vanilla and almond extracts. Highly recommended!

I used this on a slightly unconventional chocolate cake. A fantastic frosting that's none too sweet. I'm going to try again later with half as much cream cheese to see if it can be made even lighter!

Great taste, but no where near as "sturdy" as I was expecting.  Had to cut the cream down by 1/2 a cup, as it was just getting more and more sloppy and liquid.   If I were to make this again, I'd only use 1 cup of heavy whipping cream, and just make a separate batch if I needed more. I think this would keep it a litter stiffer.  On a side note, it did taste so good that I noticed the frosting it's self disappeared from the tops of a few cupcakes it was on.

I used this  with Sweetheart Cupcakes from this site. Delicious frosting but it wasn't sturdy as the its' title say's.   I had to referigerate it.  Tastes like some professional bakeries.

This a great light frosting.  I was expecting it to taste like cream cheese but it did not. I used vanilla extract instead of using almond flavoring.  I think the next time I will the almond as recommended.

I really liked this frosting, but I think I would have titled it "Sturdy Whipped Cream CHEESE Frosting".  The cream cheese flavor definitely came through.  I liked it, but it was not a plain whipped cream flavor.

This was so perfect! I was making cupcakes for a church event and needed a frosting that I could pipe on easily and would hold up to sitting around for awhile.  This was great and soooo YUMMY!  It's like having a cheesecake on top of each cupcake.  Thanks for the recipe.  (Oh and my daughter is allergic to nuts so I left out the almond extract and it was still delicious.)

Really sturdy icing as stated, very nice balance between whipped icing and cream cheese icing.  We like Cream Cheese icing and this wasn't quite cheesy enough for a carrot cake but I will for sure use this on other cakes.

it was a little messy, i thot it woulda been more sturdy, but it definitley is sturdier than ur average whipped cream icing. taste is barely sweet, i would have added some more sugar but decided against it. i used this for pumpkin gobs and it was a little too messy for that, wish i woulda tried something else, but this still tastes good!

I can't imagine using any other frosting again.  I've used it twice for parties and got rave reviews both times. Many samplers said it was the best they had ever eaten. I plan to try a chocolate version next.  It is simple and delicious!  The best part was that it makes a LOT and since I baked sheet cakes there was a lot left for fruit, cookie, and finger dipping.

This frosting was delicious!  My only complaint was that it was a little too cream cheesey. So, I added a little more sugar and some confectioners sugar to take some of the cream cheese taste out.  And then it was PERFECT!!!  Light, fluffy, and tasty!!

I was really hoping to frost my daughter's birthday princess cake with this frosting, but after adding four droops of food coloring to turn it pink, the stiff peaks collapsed and turned to goo.  It worked out fine as a fruit-dip, but as a frosting, it isn't sturdy enough on its own.  If I have the time next time, I'll consider experimenting with gelatin or maybe even a meringue powder as an additive.  It really was an insanely YUMMY frosting and I loved that it only took 1/2 a cup of sugar.  Simply lovely taste.  But the standard buttercream held up better under the circumstances for my daughter's pink Sleeping Beauty cake.

Not bad. A little more cream cheese-y than what I was hoping for, but good. This recipe yields A LOT of frosting, so be sure to have plenty of cake to frost or you'll end up with an extra jar-ful of frosting (like I did). Went great with the Rasberry Angel Food Cake (also from this site), but I would have liked something a bit lighter and sweeter.

I used this frosting on a white almond cake with a raspberry filling. The frosting complimented it PERFECTLY! I loved how it stood up against the heat. I put fresh berries all over the cake and the frosting held up great. THIS is a great recipe!

Made as is, I did give 4 stars because I'm not a fan of almond extract. Without the almond extract, 5 stars. Made this as a trial frosting for LTH's cookie dough cupcakes. I will probably use this frosting because it wasn't so sweet but without the almond extract and less heavy cream.

Very good frosting!  I did, however try to make this on a very humid day and it "broke".  The first time was awesome and loved by all!  I will use this again and again!  Just make sure you use cold bowl and beaters in summer!

Delicious and plentiful, but not quite sturdy enough for hot weather, especially if it needs to travel.  I didn't use light cream cheese and wonder if that or a higher percentage of cream cheese would make it even sturdier.

This recipe was perfect.  We added Cocoa powder for a chocolate flavoring!  Not too sweet.....The almond extract flavor really comes through.  If that is not your thing, use a little less....great recipe thanks!

This frosting was amazing, I used it on the best strawberry cake and frosting recipe.  I put this frosting on the outside, and the strawberry frosting in between the layers and as a crumb coat.  It was sooo yummy!  Because I didn't use this frosting in between the layers I had some left over.  So, I dipped fresh strawberries in this frosting and ate them.  I think I must haven't eaten almost a quart of berries on my own (I didn't want to share this discovery with the rest of my family, shhh....).  So, it makes a wonderful fruit dip.

I'm giving this 4 stars even though it didn't turn out sturdy the way it should because I really think it had more to do w/ me & the weather than the recipe. The flavor was amazing, but it just would not stiffen up for me. That said it is spring in Texas & very humid so I think I'll try it again later on when the weather is better. I passed it off to a friend who is hosting a wedding shower to use as a fruit dip.

This was a great recipe. I just think it needed a bit more sugar. I will definitely use it again. This time I used it to top chocolate cupcakes and it was sturdy enough to be piped on.

Okay this was really good...I needed to frost 24 cupcakes so I changed the quantity to 24...big no no, I have TONS of frosting but then again I had way too much cupcake mix so I can frost cupcakes and not skimp and same with the cake i made.  This is so light.  I made it last night and put it in the fridge so I can frost the cupcakes today.  I have found my frosting.  I added some blue food coloring to to tint it and it took really well.

This recipe is so tasty!! I used it on a layered white cake with pastry cream and strawberries in the middle. The cake tastes like I bought it at a bakery!! I will use this over and over again. I omitted the almond extrat. I only gave 4 stars because it didn't hold up as stated. After being out for about 2 hours the icing was very soft and my cake started sliding around on itself. Could be due to the filling as well. I must say this icing was very good in the mixing bowl, but on a cake it is 10x better!! A keeper!

It's light. You can tell it's whipped cream, and you can tell it has cream cheese in it. Very good. I used it to frost my Frog Cupcakes with.

Very good whipped cream frosting.  I didn't have almond extract, so I just used extra vanilla.  I did add a little more sugar and vanilla so I would have more of a whipped cream taste instead of cream cheese frosting.  Overall very delicious.

I didn't think this icing would hold up, but it did and it's light but holds its form and doesn't melt off. Good recipe

If you like Cool Whip, then you will like this.  It is the easiest frosting I've made, and it washes up easier than butter frostings.  I used it on a banana cake for my daughter's 1st birthday.  I wanted something that was not too sugary or buttery.  She liked it, but my husband and I don't like Cool Whip, so we didn't really like it.   I think it is a good recipe, but again, if you don't like Cool Whip, probably not the best choice.

This is a really good, not too sweet whipped cream frosting.  I used it to frost a black magic cake, also from this site.  I think this recipe would also make a great cool whip inspired fruit dip.

Pretty good. I would omit the almond paste until you've test tasted it. Then add it if you wish.

I made this for a pumpkin cake for Halloween at work, not very sturdy as the recipe title suggests, its best kept in the refrigerator and used quickly. I do have to add however that my coworkers young daughter apologized for eating the frosting off of the remaining cake that was left in the refrigerator... priceless!

This frosting was good, but it had too much of a cream cheese frosting taste. I had left overs and used it to frost a cake about a week later-didn't taste very good.

I made this to top a chocolate cake and then decorated with strawberries. It was delicious and stayed on the cake like cream cheese or butter bream frosting, yet tasted like whip cream. I know I will use this recipe for years to come!

This is now my favorite frosting!  It came out light and tangy, with just enough sweetness.  I used coconut extract instead of almond because I was using it for a coconut cream cake, and it was fabulous!
