I mixed the cherry pie filling together with the pitted sweet cherries (yes, I kept the liquid.....it's like when you make a regular dump cake with the cherry pie filling and whole can of crushed pineapple with juice). I also used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. My dump cake was done in just over 30 minutes. I served this slightly warm with dollops of Cool-Whip. My family adored this dessert. Very good. NOTE: If you cut your butter into very thin slices and layer them over the dry cake mix/nut layer, you should have enough to cover the whole dry layer and end up with a topping that looks like a crisp/cobbler. I don't always get the results I want if I melt the butter and drizzle it over.

Very Tasty!  The trick to getting all the cake mix to bake is to cut very thin slices from a cold stick of utter and lay them as close together over top of the cake mix layer.

This cake is just awesome.  Quick, easy and so GOOD!  For those of you who were complaining about having dry cake mix after baking - you need to use more butter.  I usually use a whole stick and it turns out terrific.  I also substitute pecans for the walnuts.

I can see how some people weren't impressed with this, BUT I LOVED it! I'd give it 5 stars for flavor alone but gave it 4 just because of  the non-cake like consistency. 

If you are thinking of making this be warned that it is not a cake, rather more of a dessert (you spoon it into dishes). The woman who said the trick is to cut very thin pieces from a stick of butter and cover the _entire_ top is correct. I did this and didn't have the crumbly problem others mentioned. Instead, the top turned out a bit crusty with the gooey cherry stuff underneath. Keep an eye on temp so the top doesn't scorch (my oven runs hot).

Serve with whipped cream. (I skipped the nuts; a personal preference.)

By reducing the cake mix to 1/2 and the butter to 1/2 cup then pouring the juice from the can of cherries over top instead of beneath the mix it will make it moist and all will be cooked.  Next time I will use an 8x8 pan so the fruit is thicker and still reduce the mix to 1/2.

This recipe is good when you want to whip up something quick.  I think people are mislead about dump cakes.  Most people expect it to be like an actual cake but it's supposed to be like fruit filling with a crunchy topping. I used pecans and slice up a really cold stick of butter and placed the butter slices on top that way you get more even coverage. Dump cakes are great !!! Give them a chance !!!

very good flavor. instead of the thin slices of butter I grate a frozen stick over the top of the cake mix, works like a charm.

This is not a cake recipe.  First I called it pudding, then I decided it was more like cherry crisp, except not crisp.  The flavor is strange with the cake mix, and I had to mix it all together after cooking for it to taste okay.  It does taste okay... but it is not cake.

My cake turned out with the cake mix still there.  I did just as it said.  Don't know what I could have done different.  ??  Used it with vanilla ice cream after I removed some of the cake mix that didn't make a cake

the best way to mix topping on any dump cake is to mix cold butter with cake mix as though you were making biscuits (before the milk is added that is). Then you will have a strusel-type topping, therefore more crumbly and crunchy!

This was about as quick and easy as you can get. I normally don't like cherries, but this is excellent! I think melting the butter and then pouring it on top would be better as some of the cake mix didn't incorporate. It was still good....very brownie like. Great served warm with whipped cream. Will be making again and again.

This is a great Black Forest Pudding, rather than a cake. Why not make it more German by soaking the pitted dark sweet cherries in Kirschwasser overnight and using the booze/cherry instead of just cherry and cherry juice? A great treat!

Oh my gosh! This is too good!  I used two cans of cherry pie filling, added 1tsp almond extract and sprinkled a semisweet chocolate chips across the top before I put the cake mix on. Grating the butter really helps. Wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this pudding cake. I used more butter than what was on the recipe though. I also tried it with raspberry filling instead of the cherry filling. The men here loved it. I wasn't very keen with it! I told my husband that he would eat anything that I make,  within reason, that is! HEHE!

This was great, I customized it with marachino cherries instead of dark, which helped with the moisture and cooking. I drained the juice and poured it over the the cake mix before adding the butter. Also, heatted can of dark choc icinge in micro for 1 min, stirred and poured over as well. This is a very rich cake, but very delicious!

The trick to getting the butter evenly over the top of the cake mix is to melt the butter and pour it over the top. I use at least one stick of butter. It will puddle on top and slowly sink into the cake mix. It makes a fantistic crust for almost a reverse dessert. Very, very tasty.

This was wonderful!  I used frozen cherries instead of canned, since I had some.  I also used a bit more butter, just to make sure it all got covered.  Hubby said this is a keeper!

This is awesome! So awesome I have made it 2 times this month in addition to making a variation 2 times. My variation is 2 cans of apple pie filling, 1 jar of carmel sundae topping, one box of butter cake, with pecan pieces on top, and butter of course. serve with whipped cream or ice cream. unfortunately the scale shows how good it is too. But nothing this good can be good for you right?

Really good! to avoid the "dry spots" reported by other reviewers, I simply cut the butter into the dry cake mix, like you would for pie crust.

I am not a fan of chocolate unless pared with rasberries so I replaced the cherry pie filling with rasberry pie filling.  Mix the rasberries and cherries and spread in a 9x13 pan-no need to use cooking spray.  Sprinkle the chocolate cake mix over the fruit and break up cake mix "clumps" to avoid uncooked cake mix.  I simply LIGHTLY pat it down. Thinly slice one stick of butter and place pieces over cake mix to evenly cover.  Top with nuts and bake 1 hour at 350 degrees.

I made this for a work function and it turned out well.  However, I did make some changes.

I could not find pitted dark sweet cherries.  So, I substituted a 5 oz bag of dried cherries, 1/8c Light Agave Nectar and 1/2c water.

Not a keeper for me. The taste was off for me. My kids picked at it, but I still had more than 3/4 left over a week later. Thanks for the recipe, but it just wasn't for me.

Definitely recommend cutting in the butter like with a pie crust / biscuit recipe.      The 45 min at 375 was way excessive for me.  It was done in about 30 min.  I'm disappointed it tastes a little burnt b/c I wasn't sure how long to leave it (toothpick doesn't seem to work w/ a dumper).

Very good. My kids really liked this.  I've been dreaming about this dessert ever since I saw TxCin~ILove2Ck's picture of it. I used a whole stick of butter and I grated it over the whole cake per some other reviewers suggestion and I had no problem with the cake being crumbly or dry.  I also reserved the liquid from the cherries and poured that on the top of the cake as well after the butter.  Turned out nicely. Thanks.

Sinfully delicious. That is how my husband described this. I used a whole stick of margarine, pecan halves instead, and all I had was 2 cans of cherries not filling so I drained most of the juice off. This was done 10 minutes early. Good, we all liked this. It is really rich.

This is sooo yummy!! I used 2 big cans of cherry pie filling because I couldn't find a can of pitted cherries. In an 8x8 pan i spread a little more than half the cake mix ontop, then i grated a stick of butter over that. Make sure the butter has been in the freezer so you don't have a huge mess. Baked for about 42 mins.

This was almost too easy and too good, everyone thought I spent hours and it was actually about 5 minutes to prepare.  I will make this again and again.  It was so good it was gone in no time and I never take seconds of desserts but I had three servings of this.  I used a triple chocolate cake mix, I think it was Betty Crocker and it was perfect.

This did not turn out at all.  Some of the cake mixture does not cook, and the part that did was so hard it was like chewing a rock. No I will not make this again.

talk about a comfort food. we served warm with a scoop of ice cream on top. i cannot describe how tempted i was to keep on eating this one. the only thing i might change next time is that maybe i will only use half a can of the pie filling and see how that works out. it was a little too much cherry for me. i used the advice of others and sliced the butter very thin so that the top of the cake was pretty evenly covered. i love easy recipes like this one.

Using canned cherries definitely steps it up a few notches, and results are so much more like the traditional Black Forest cake.  When in a hurry, though - I tend to rely on my speediest version (just 3 ingredients): 1- microwave the butter to melt, 2 - dump two cans of cherry pie filling in pan, 3 - dump devil's food cake mix over cherries, drizzle the melted butter over cake mix, 4 - bake at 350 degrees until done.  Total time from start to oven - 3 minutes tops.  The end result never fails to produce smiles & compliments - and no one but yourself is the wiser of how little of your time and effort it took (kinda like Rice Krispies treats)

Great dessert-  This is a very good dessert made even better served with cool whip or vanilla ice cream.  You have to make sure that you cut the butter very thin and layer it over the cake mix so that the butter is almost touching.  (no big chunks)  You will get a top that is crisp with almost no cake mix unbaked.

Not only is this a quick and easy recipe, it is delicious!  I doubled the recipe for a large group and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  It came out perfect just as the recipe was written.  I made no substitutions.

When I read how this cake was made I was sure it would be nasty, but one of my friends insisted so I gave it a try. Wow I am glad I did! This is just perfect and so tasty. I have made this lots of times now.

I liked the idea of the cherries. It didn't turn out all that well, dry chunks. We tossed more than 1/2 of the cake.

PLEASE  EDUCATE YOURSELF about what a dump cake is.  This was GREAT, but I hate the negative reviews because it isn't a cake.  IT'S NOT SUPPOSED to be a cake.  It's not a pie, not a cake, not a cobbler... It is it's own unique thing, and it's delicious!!!
So HATERS - - STOP YOUR HATING!!!  :-)

I followed the recipe and then did as directed by other reviewers with the butter placement. It came out as it was supposed to but I still didnt think it was awesome. I found it too salty based on the betty crocker triple chocolate cake mix I used. I know all cake mix has salt and I understand why but this was too much for me to enjoy. I dont think I would make this again although the guys in my house loved it and thought it was perfect.

Great change up on dump cake flavor. For those stuck on the word cake, get pass the word "dump", because it is not fluffy.

This recipe was amazing! I did modify it a little. I mixed some mini chocolate chips into the dry cake mix before putting it on the cherries. I also melted the butter before I put it on. Oh, and I stirred in about 1 1/2 tsp vanilla into the pitted dark cherries before I spread them over the pie filling. And I found out that this recipe tastes MUCH better cold. Super yummy though, everyone loved it!!

the taste is not bad, but almost everything the previous rewievers said is true: yes, you have the crumbly crust problem, and it's not quite cooked; yes I had to mix it after taking it out of the oven; yes, the trick of slicing the butter is good, and yes, this means so much butter... yes, 1 package of cake mix is definitely too much, I thought half would have been quite the thing; yes, the walnuts are almost out of place here. I'll give it another try before throwing this recipe to the wind, but...

I really don't know what to call this recipe, but cake is not it.  Way to sweet and the consistancy of undercooked brownies in some areas and hard crumbles in others.  Did not got over well at all.  Sorry.

This was so wonderful, I made it late one night to take into work the next day and everyone just loved it.  I did not have any cherries in juice on hand, just the canned cherry pie filling so i just added a little water to the can after i emptied it and it worked just fine.  I also melted the butter and used a lil more then called for and it turned out wonderful.  Thank you for a great and easy recipe!

I am calorie conscious, so I used lite cherry pie filling. Also, all the cake mixes around here for years, have been only 15.25 oz. As I overdid chopping  the walnuts, I only needed 1/2 cup, which worked out well. And, per other reviews, I froze the salted butter and then shredded over the pan - only needed 1/2 cup.  Turned out nicely, but next time I'll add 1/2 tsp almond flavoring. Calorie count was 156 per 1/24 - but who can eat such a small piece!?!  For me, 1/18 was 208 cal.

It tastes good. I made it EXACTLY according to the directions. Except it was very loose after 45 minutes, so I baked it 5 minutes more FOUR times, checking each time. After cooling, it’s still not cake-like, but more like a pudding.

Turned out really well.  This was for a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone liked it.  The only thing I did differently was to soften the butter, cut the cake mix into the butter to make like a streusel, stir the nuts into the cake mix-butter mixture, and the spoon it over the cherries.

I made recipe as written, omitting almonds (had none in the cabinet).  It was easy and delicious.  I served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Will definitely keep this one.

To help moisten the dry cake mix I use more butter about 1-1/2 sticks and cut it in with a pastry blender. I'd rather use two cans of refilling.

Wonderful recipe!  Delicious!  Made twice (without nuts, using two cherry pie fillings instead of cherries. a 1 1/2 sticks of melted butter) and not a bite left in pan; one for American Legion Thanksgiving and one for husband's company Christmas party.  Baking a third one now for home.

I made this using a Devils Food cake mix. I also added semi sweet chocolate chips to the dry cake mix. The finished product was served with vanilla ice cream, and was a big hit with the family!  I will definitely make this again.

I just made this and it is WONDERFUL, so rich and good. Just make sure you use enough butter on the top, you need pretty good coverage from thin slices of butter. My husband is REALLY picky and he's in heaven eating this.

I thought this was an okay recipe, but needed more cherries. Not nearly as good as some black forest cakes out there, plus with all that butter it is way too fattening.

It was fair.  Certainly easy, but nothing I'd ever make again.  My family said it had too many cherries.  I didn't mind those, I just wasn't wild about the texture of the chocolate part.

This was a tasty, easy dessert. I used two cans filling instead of the pitted cherries and it worked quite well. It is great topped with fresh whipped cream!

really easy to make, but it came out very crunchy at the end.  messy and have to eat with a spoon, but otherwise tastes pretty good.

The cake took a very long time to come out and there was still cake mix left on top. I didn't like this recipe at all.

I've never had Black Forest anything, so I was a little nervous about chocolate and cherries but it was great!  Very easy.  I don't know if my boyfriend has tried it, but his boy did and liked it, I'll most likely make this again!
