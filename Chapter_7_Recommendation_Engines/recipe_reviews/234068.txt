Wow this is really good.  I made exactly as written with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper for half a recipe.  Oh...except I used frozen peas that i rinsed under cold water and let drain really well.  I served really cold and I wouldn't change a thing.  Maybe experiment with cheese as I think pepper jack might be really good but as is with mild cheddar it is yum yum tasty, and something different.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was Delicious. I only used 2 slices of bacon and added 2 hard boiled eggs chopped and it was great. next time I will add more celery for some extra crunch. Thanks for the recipe.

I've made other pea salads, but this one is my favorite. I followed the directions exactly and it's very good! I'm not sure that it's not even better one or two days later! I will make this one again!

This pea salad was delicious! I made the recipe as directed without making any changes.  This will become my go-to recipe for pea salad in the future.

This recipe was so incredibly delicious. I would definitely listen to the recipe when it says to DRIZZLE the dressing over the salad. I had at least half the batch of dressing leftover and if I'd used it all, I think it would have ruined it.
Personally, I would add another strip or two of bacon and use shredded cheese instead of cubed so you can actually get all the ingredients in one unbelievably tasty forkful.

I wondered if I'd like the honey in this dressing and I found that I did enjoy it very much.  I made the recipe as directed except that I minced the onion finely and mixed it into the dressing and probably didn't use quite the full recommend amount.  Delicious!

Very good pea salad! My only addition to it is hard boiled eggs. My version has diced eggs, peas, bacon, cheese, onion. The dressing in this recipe takes it over the top!!! Woot-Woot!

I have made this salad many times.  My husband loves it.   It is a great substitute for potato salad to go with  BBQ sandwiches.   I change it up a bit by using 1/2 frozen peas and 1/2 frozen corn.  I also have  added both green and black olives, chopped raw carrots, yellow and red bell peppers, avocado, and cucumber.  It is great!

Had originally planned on making tuna salad and had already boiled the pasta when I realized-out of tuna. I found this doing an ingredient search for peas and bacon. So I easily adapted it into a pasta salad. I had already chopped some pickles and carrots so I threw those in. I ended up using only 1/2 c of peas. Turned out great. I agree with other reviewers to wait until the end to add the bacon. Quick, easy, and budget friendly. Served with cheeseburgers and potato chips. Looking forward to taking leftovers for lunch tomorrow

My husband said he knew he wasn't going to like this, but he did. I think he must have liked it even better than I did since I didn't get the chance to have more the next day thanks to a midnight raid by him.

Trying to watch fat, is cholesterol. Rather than use 3/4 cup mayonnaise I used 1/3 cup mayonnaise and mixed it with 1/4 cup of milk to create the volume needed. Took it to a picnic and did not have any leftovers.

Used pre-cooked bacon which did not give me any bacon fat to cook with so substituted with olive oil. Still turned out fantastic!

I didn't add the bacon or celery but I think I will next time I liked the sweetness of the honey and sugar but my husband did not. I will make this again and add the celery and possibly the bacon and boiled egg. Also I put to much red  onion I may use white onion next time or chive onion because the onion I had was a little strong.

This was quite good. Even my lover, who doesn't like vegetables much, quite liked this.

The only change I would make next time is I think I would shred rather than cube the cheddar to spread out the cheesy flavor. But it was otherwise quite good.

I used extra celery (about 6 stalks total) because I was using up a celery bunch I had leftover. I also used a bit more bacon (5 slices) and cheese. I also used defrosted frozen peas rather than fresh ones. 

I found cooking my bacon on medium high on my stove burned it, so I will cook on medium next time.

A vegetarian version omitting the bacon also tastes fine. Sometimes I'll add bacon salt to taste to mimic the bacon flavor.

Wow this is great. I recommend not adding the cheese and bacon until right before serving to prevent getting soggy. I took this in my lunch for four days and it held up well.

Since there are only 2 1/2 of us, I always half the recipe. My 25 yr old daughter would never touch a pea and isn't fond of celery either. She sucks down this pea salad like crazy. Even half a recipe makes a lot of salad for a small family, but there are never leftovers. We can't get enough of it. It's rotated into the dinner menu biweekly, if not weekly. The only change I make is to use shredded cheese.

I made this for a family dinner with our grandchildren, and it was a hit with everyone,  definitely a keeper.  The celery adds a nice crunch.  I used frozen peas because that’s what I had, and it can be a year-round dish.

Excellent Pea Salad.  Made it as directed.  Great taste and it is better a day after making it.  Don't just pour all the dressing on the salad, I also had some left over dressing. I think I will add some hard boiled egg next time.

I loved this recipe! I will make it again. Very refreshing.I used 5 slices of thick cut bacon, shredded sharp cheddar,  Vidalia onion and 13 oz of frozen peas along with other ingredients. I like the crunch from the celery and addy some nuts or sunflower seeds might be good. I added the dressing just to coat the salad.

We grew
Peas this year so this was a no brainer to make this salad. So very good. I let the flavors blend together for two days, stirring once every day.

Don't attend many potlucks these days, but I remember this salad being one of my favorites, but I never made it myself! This recipe is simple and quick. It was even better the second day I had it so I recommend making it well ahead of your event so the delicious flavors can meld!

Used fresh peas from my garden, 2-1/4 cups, blanched for 2 minutes, quickly cooled, drained and refrigerated. Used 6 thick slices of bacon. Note: make sure peas are well drained.

I took this to a church potluck supper and it was all gone at the end of the evening. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I didn’t change anything because it tasted great the way it was.

My husband and I loved this.  I have made it twice now.  Like others, I used frozen peas.  I also used real bacon bits, so I didn’t use the bacon grease.  I had to put a little half and half in to thin the mayonnaise.  I also used shredded cheddar instead of chunks of cheese.  This is a definite keeper!

Made 2 batches.  One exactly as written, second with my changes.  I used more bacon, less mayo and less salt.  Both excellent.  A fun side dish for any occasion.

Very tasty salad and very easy. I used frozen peas and drained very well and shredded the cheese instead of cubed.

This was the best squash casserole I’ve ever made. The only thing I did different was I added some French’s French Fried Onions on top. It was awesome!!

Love this recipe! I make it often and the only change I've made is to add 3-4 chopped boiled eggs. I prefer the dressing with honey, but I recently realized mid-recipe I was out of it. I subbed Karo light corn syrup instead; an equal amount of regular sugar will also work fine.

First time making a pea salad. Made it for  a party and everyone loved it. No changes. Almost omitted the raisins but it adds just a touch  of sweetness. It's a keeper.

I love bacon pea salad! 

I altered the recipe to suit my taste: omitted white sugar; omitted celery; no extra salt; doubled raw honey; 1/2 cup chopped onion.

I will definitely make this again!

I. Have made this twice.  Once as written and was loved by one and all.
The second time that I made it, I used a sharp cheese and shredded it.  It was so good that my husband raved over it , and said "best salad ever".
Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I had a "pea pie" at one of my son's school functions & didn't get the recipe then :-/ It was absolutely delicious and I've been trying to recreate it since... This is the closest I've come. And it is wonderful!! I omitted the sugar, and added the bacon grease... Yummy!! Will definitely keep tweaking this recipe until it's perfect.

This salad was my aunt's go-to at summer picnics. I was so excited to find this recipe. The first batch came out sweeter than I like, so I cut back on the sugar to taste in my next batch and used scallions instead of onions. The bacon grease adds a wonderful smokiness. I have now made it several times since for friends and family with rave reviews.
