Excellent!  Only I substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts because the kids don't like nuts!  Everyone RAVED about them!

Are you supposed to be able to get the bars out of the pan before cutting them?  That's what I triedâ€¦ I had trouble with that and my single baked cookie broke into about 5 pieces.  Luckily they were still warm and I could stick them back together.  And confectioners sugar, I learned, covers up a bunch of imperfections.  Gave it 4 stars because despite all the trouble, they still tasted great!

These bars are excellent! I was worried about the butter at the bottom of the pan, but I followed the directions and they came out perfectly. The only thing I added was a handful of chocolate chips,
very yummy.

These are amazing! The bars are so chewy  and sweet.  We didn't have any nuts, so just like someone else who made this recipe, we used chocolate chips instead. It makes them so chunky and sweet!

I love these bars and have made them many times  - sometimes  with pecans but usually with walnuts.  Today, I will make them again but am planning on adding a little shredded coconut and using pecans.

I like this recipe it is very easy and the bars chewy but they needed some zest. I did figure out what I think that the recipe needed and that was a good amount of allspice it gave them more of a specialty cookie flavor without it they are bland and with it they are nice!

Very tasty! I used flaked almonds instead of walnuts as that was all I had in my cupboard but still tasted lovely.

These were pretty good, and I would probably make them again, but I felt like they were missing something.
