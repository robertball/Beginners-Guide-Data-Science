I've made this several times now and found adding a little cumin and salt worked great with it. I made dinner for a few friends and used this rub on and under the skin of some chicken thighs, they loved it.

This is awesome!  I smoked 10 lbs of riblets and needed a rub for them.  This was the best I have ever used.  The flavor was delicate, which allows the smoke flavor to not be overpowered.  Also, it was simple, using only ingredients in my pantry.  

"What is garlic pepper and what do I do if I don't have any?"  Use garlic powder and black pepper (1/2 tbs of each, which increases the garlic flavor).

Add salt to this recipe! I added about 2 tbsp of salt and it was great. I put it on the chicken and let it sit in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Very flavorful.

I tripled the recipe because I had my own dried rosemary and sage to use up. I also added 2 TBSP of dried, chopped, lemon zest that I had on hand. Very versatile recipe. Not only can be used as a rub but I have added it to stuffing for chicken, and mushrooms. Sealed up good, can use over and over.

This was just fine on a boneless leg of lamb.  No heat, which my wife liked and plenty of taste which we all liked.  I agree that it needs salt.

Used this on baked chicken. It's very traditional and inoffensive, but it feels like it needs something more. 4.5 out of 5.
