You can't go wrong with potatoes, cheese and sour cream as far as I'm concerned.  I didn't have corn flakes, so I smashed up some crackers for the top instead.  Also I scaled it down quite a bit because with just me in the house, I thought I'd be better off not tempting myself with a big batch :)

I omitted both the soup and corn flakes since I had neither on hand.  I mixed the sour cream and cream cheese with milk to get the consistency I wanted.  I seasoned the potatoes with salt and pepper, chili powder and a small shake of cayenne.  It still seemed a bit bland for our taste so I used pepper jack cheese.  Rich and satisfying and very easy to put together.

I made it exactly to the recipe and both my husband and I loved it.  I will make it again and have it as a side for Christmas brunch.  Great recipe.

I made this recipe tonight for our family of six.  I did everything exactly like the recipe except the cornflakes.  I didn't have any cornflakes so I used crushed croutons.  I liked it just as well.  Everyone thought it was delicious.

The only change I made was leaving out the cereal.  It was a big hit with everyone. Very good.

Great dish. I made this last night for my husband and I. I replaced the butter with a cup of milk, replaced the corn flakes with crushed croutons, and added my typical blend of spices(salt, pepper, garlic salt, paprika, onion powder, and a few other add ins like frozen peas to make it healthier). He didn't even save some for lunch today because it was so good.
