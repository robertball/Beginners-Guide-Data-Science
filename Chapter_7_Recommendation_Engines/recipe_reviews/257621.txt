4.11.17  Used freshly-squeezed orange juice, so this smoothie had all fresh fruit.  None of my fruit was frozen, so I did add crushed ice and achieved the perfect consistency for a smoothie.  Many smoothies are based with yogurt (I like yogurt, but I know many don't), and they have a bit of tang to them.  This smoothie just has mellow, pure fruit flavor with all three fruits sharing equally in taste.   Very nice!
