Great as written! I can't wait to try this again with chicken and green sauce.

The BF and company really liked this. I doubled all the seasonings and made the Enchlada sauce. I used a Mexican cheese blend and some leftover Queso Fresco, didn't add any cheese to the top out of preference. There was a lot of meat mixture left, but it will make great nachos or taco salad! Thank you for sharing!

Oh so delicious! Far better then regular chili relleno's! I added a slice of cream cheese for added richness.
