11.23.16  The recipe author suggests using buttermilk in place of whole milk.   I had some on hand, so I used buttermilk, otherwise, followed the recipe.  The texture is not what I’m used to for a pound cake, it has more of what I consider a quick bread consistency.  The cake is light, but I didn’t get much rise, so I’ll bump up the baking powder the next time.  It certainly is quick-and-easy with ingredients I always have on hand.  It’s a nice cake, just not what I think of as pound cake.  This would be very good with fresh strawberries or raspberries over the top.  Cookin Mama, thanks for sharing your grandmother’s recipe, we enjoyed it.

first time i've made any pound cake, following the directions 325 degrees for 30 minutes....thinking either the time or the temperature is way off.  as it took close to hour and twenty minutes to finish cooking at 325. 

looks pretty, smells good, have yet to taste it though. top seems sticky so going to powder it with confectioner's sugar.

I cut the sugar by 3/4c but definitely feel that was too much. If I make it again I will use 1&1/2 c of sugar. I also used 4 eggs instead of 5. I topped it with powdered sugar. Everyone liked it!

Turned out great! Though I changed the amount of lemon extract to 1 1/2 tbsp and also added 1tbsp of lemon juice.

Delicious cake that everyone loved! I just found the cake a bit dense and underwhelming in lemon.

I made this and ended up throwing it out. The oven temperature and time are way off. I put it in for 45 minutes and the top of the loaf was still soggy!

The cake is really dense and took more than 30 minutes for the cake to be fully cooked. I will be looking for another recipe.

Easy to make, but not quite a pound cake texture. I had to cook 45 minutes.
