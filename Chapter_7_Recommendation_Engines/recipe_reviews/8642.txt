This is a great recipe.  My husband loves it.  I made a few changes to make it a little heathier.  Instead of Russian dressing I used a raspberry vinegerette preferably one with splenda.  I also use a entire jar of apricot preserves also the sugar free variety with Splenda.  This helps lower the amount of sugar in the recipe and cuts out a lot of calories and fat that is in the Russian dressing.  I think it tastes better too.

I make this recipe all of the time, but I only use one envelope of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and I use boneless chicken breasts.  I have grown up on this recipe since I was a little girl. I love the sauce over my chicken and my rice.  My whole family loves it, too.

I prepared this for a group and it was just wonderful!  I cooked the chicken overnight in the crock pot then put it all together the next morning.  I only used one soup envelope and one cup of pineapple preserves along with two small bottles of the Russian dressing.  It made the most wonderful glaze.  I will add this to my favorites!

I grew up on a similar rendition of this recipe and it's one of my kids favorites today. I use boneless breasts and mix 1 package dry onion soup, 1 bottle russian dressing, 1 jar apricot preserves and 1 jar pineapple preserves. I use 6 - 8 chicken breasts, too. Yummy!

This was horrible. The taste was extremely bland. The sauce became too thin during cooking.The presentation was very poor. I would not use as much Russian dressing, more apricot preserves, and double the dry onion soup mix. Also, I would probably throw in garlic, onions, and some curry/ginger, and maybe some soy sauce. I really don't know. I do know this is not a fix again for our family.

my mom made this recipe every week when i was growing up in the oven.  the chicken was always too dry- I tried it in a slow cooker and it came out MUCH better.   if you still want to bake the chicken I recommend putting foil over the pan  for all but the last 2 minutes.  this will help keep the moisture in.

This is okay, especially for kids.  You can toss in pineapple chunks, too.  For adults, a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes makes it less bland and similar to a dish at PF Chang's.  Easy to keep ingredients in the pantry. Serve over rice.

I have made this many times, usually with boneless breasts and just 1 packet of onion soup mix. Recently tried substituting can of cranberry sauce for apricot preserves tastes even better.

Easy, quick and delicious.  I used 3 lbs of skinless bone-in chicken thighs.  Also followed an earlier suggestion and covered with foil for first 30 minutes, then uncovered for balance of cooking time.  Result was very flavorful and moist chicken.

I used this recipe to prepare a great quick supper.  Instead of russian dressing I used French dressing.  I served it with some orzo and it was a smashing success- with my husband, at least!

I LOVE this recipe! I use it all the time! The sauce is amazing poured over rice too. I did make a couple of changes to it though. I use boneless chicken breasts and to the sauce I add, pineapple chunks, brown sugar, and soy sauce! It is so so good!

This recipe was very easy as compared to the other sweet and sour recipes.  When you're in a hurry this would work.  It tasted good but not quite like you would expect.

This was a good. I did follow other reviewers suggestions and only used one package of onion soup mix. That was plenty! I added a small can of pineapple. My sauce was a little runny? I thickened it with some corn starch.  Served over rice, my kids gobbled it down. I thought it was a little too sweet so I added soy sauce, it helped. Thanks for the recipe, I will make again with some of my own changes, but anything my kids will eat gets a minimum of 4 stars!

I can't believe I discovered this recipe on this site.  I've been enjoying this delicious chicken dish for over 50 years.  My mother made it often.  The sauce will thicken nicely if baked at least part of the time uncovered.  Great family dish and good enough for guests! This is a winner!

The meal is a success in our house if we can get the kids to eat it, and they did! I will be making this again! After reading some of the reviews, I only used 1 package of the onion soup mix, and added pineapple preserves and crushed red pepper too. Maybe would have been even better with more pineapple in it! Also, I boiled the chicken so it wouldn't dry out and then oven cooked it for the last 20 minutes.

as a vegetarian, i cannot vouch for how this recipe tastes myself, but i can say that whenever i make it, it disappears! it is the quickest, easiest, lowest clean-up recipe in my arsenal. it is also the most versatile--- great for an in-a-pinch weeknight and suitable for company. like other reviewers, i use only one onion soup packet, and boneless, skinless chicken breasts. served over rice it's an easy dinner!

I followed it to a tee, except I used only one packet of soup mix.  It was OK.  I will make again, but only to use the other half of the Catalina (the West coast name for Russian) dressing.  The search continues...

I really liked this dish, but next time I make it, it will be ten times better.  I took others suggestions and added pineapple, used only 1 package of onion soup and I added a chopped green pepper.  I also took someone elses advice and used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  BIG MISTAKE.  Don't use thighs.  The meat is all dark and it doesn't go well with this dish.  It's also a pain to eat around the bones.  Just go with good old boneless, skinless breasts.  When I took it out of the oven, it was very runny.  I would recommend adding some corn starch to thicken it up.  Other than that, this dish is delicious and I will make it again.

I have used this same recipe for years.  It is not bland and it's become a standard for all family members from 2 yrs old to 80!  I too use boneless chicken, in fact FROZEN breast filets from Costco.  No need to thaw at all.  I do only use 1 packet of onion soup mix in my recipe and it covers about 20-25 filets.  Double sauce if you use the entire bag of filets.  Enjoy!

I thought this recipe was good, easy and something different to do with chicken.  I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, and I didn't have a whole pack of dry onion soup mix so I used French's French Fried Onions.  (who doesn't have those laying around!!!)    My husband liked it and the kids.  Will make again.

I made this for two with boneless pork chops and it was very good. Added an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple, a whole onion soup pkg, and just eyeballed the dressing and preserves (I used Smuckers). Served over rice made with chicken broth and we had no leftovers. I need to play with the bake time; 40 mins was a little long but my oven runs hot. This one's a keeper for sure.

I've been doing this for years, and have also used it for turkey breasts, in the slow cooker!  Sometimes I add pineapple tidbits, green/red/yellow peppers & celery to the sauce.  Have also used the "Light" version of the dressing, & it came out great

This is a variation of a recipe I make all the time.  When I make it I use 8 oz of Catalina style dressing, a can of whole cranberry sauce and an envelope of onion soup mix for the sauce. I usually make chicken cutlets so we don't have to struggle with bones, which can be messy in a dish like this.  Everyone I have ever made it for just loves it.    To Tayl5286 I'd say two things: -Use an entire evelope of onion soup mix.  You'll get far more flavor. -While this is a "wet" not "creamy" sauce, I know from baking experience that some brands of jams and preserves have less substance than others.  Try using different brands until you find one that melts down to a consistency that you like.    This is a quick, great family meal that makes a nice enough presetation for company.  I've even served it at a buffet dinner by cutting the chicken into bite size pieces before I cook it.

I have been making this same dish for years, too.  Everyone loves it.  One slight difference that I do is that I mix the dressing, preserves and soup in a poy and heat to boiling.  I let the mixture cool to room temperature, then add the chicken and let it marinate in the refrigerator overnight.  Everything comes out nice and tender.

I have been making this recipe for almost 50 years.  2 boxes of onion soup mix is way too much. Bake uncovered if the sauce is too thin, or just thicken the sauce with a slurry (flour or cornstarch).  My family loved the extra sauce over rice or noodles.  I only use thighs because breast meat is too dry. I also make extra to freeze for another day. My DH and children (when they lived at home) liked this dish better the second time around.

This was so delicious!  And very easy!  I made the sauce exactly as written except halfed it because there are only 3 of us but I am not a fan of cutting up whole chickens so I just used boneless skinless breasts and thighs.  Served it over leftover fried rice from some chinese takeout the night before and it was perfect!  Next time I think I will try putting in some pineaple and green bell peppers.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and just one pack of onion soup mix.  This was easy and yummy.  A good stand-by recipe for a week night...you can keep all the ingredients in your pantry and just pick up the chicken!  Good over rice!

This recipe is great but even better if you add a can of diced pineapple, coursley chopped fresh tomato (if you love tomatoes) and for more colour, coursley chopped green and red peppers as well as one course chopped onion.  Makes for a great one pot meal served over rice.

I've been making this recipe for years. To get the best tasting sauce you need to use Dark (red) Russian Dressing. Can be hard to find, I usually find it in smaller grocery stores. I use 1 small bottle dark Red Russian Dressing, 2 envelopes onion soup mix, i jar 18oz apricot preserves and any combination of chicken pieces. Pour over chicken, cover with foil, bake 45 min, uncover baste and bake 15 min. This is a huge hit in my family.

I have made a version of this recipe for many years and it has become a family favourite.To cut down on salt I use fresh finely chopped onion instead of the soup mix. I have always used chicken breasts and so do not need to cook it as long as chicken with the bone. It has always turned out moist and tender - we serve it on rice with a salad on the side for a complete meal - yummy and easy!

We have made this in our family for years...the only difference is we use fresh sliced onions instead of soup mix.  This is so yummy you will be spooning the sauce over bread...yumm!  You MUST use the wishbone russian dressing..not a vinagrette.  Also if using boneless chicken make sure to keep basting so they don't dry out or just turn them over frequently.

This is a great idea. I could not find Russian Dressing but FRENCH dressing worked great and everyone loved it.  It is so easy.  I added garlic and mushrooms.  I can't wait to do this again and add pinapple and carrots.

I have also been making this for years and have yet to have it glaze the chicken.  It is a good flavor and good over rice and easy so I guess that outweighs not having the glaze on the chicken.  Any suggestions anyone?

I made the sauce (w/o the pkg of onion soup - too salty!) and added 1 clove crushed garlic and finely chopped onion instead and stirred them all together - then nuked it in the microwave.  We put this over Turkey Meatballs (yep - the frozen store-bought kind) which had already been heated in the Microwave.  Poured the sauce over the top of those and heated it for a couple minutes more.  Served it with rice and got rave reviews from the family.  It was AWESOME, and only took me about 10 minutes to make (not including the rice) and we LOVED the Russion Dressing and Apricot Preserves though - was an excellent "base" to get the right "sticky-ness" and flavor for the sauce.

I have made this recipe for years, and like some of the others, used only one envelope of onion soup mix. If I have extra sauce, it keeps well in a jar in the refrigerator to be used at a later date for a quick supper. It's especially good mixed with white rice!

This was great, so easy. I browned the chicken first and added fresh minced garlic, one clove. Served over rice.  Nest time I will use some of the suggestions here and add a green pepper, can of pineapple and a chopped tomato for more colour.

This was good, a little salty because of the onion soup mix but overall my family liked it.  I used chicken breast cut up and served the glazed chicken with rice and a bag of oriental veggie mix.

I have made this hundreds of times. It is a recipie my mother made when I was a kid. She called it Hawaian Chicken. The only thing that is different is instead of 2 packs of Lipton Onion Soup I used one pack and I cooked chicken breasts with skin and bone in Turkey size Reynolds oven cooking bags for 1 hour. No Basting, no mess and the chicken is so tender and the sauce mmmmm yummy!!! I always thought it was my mom's own crazy mix of ingredients but obviously she found the recipe somewhere. I no longer make it because my hubby does not like it but it is one of my personal favorites!!!

I have been making this recipe for years but I have changed it up myself. I use canned chunky pineapple and omit the onion soup mix. I marinate the night before and it is even better. It is a crowd pleaser and very easy! I also add pineapple juice if I have some along with the Russian salad dressing.

I totally agree with another viewer...this recipe is way too bland. There are 5 of us and no one liked this dish. Perhaps if you tweaked the recipe a bit it would taste better. I don't plan to make it again to try though. Very disappointing, I was really looking forward to a great tasting dish.

We call this recipe Russian Chicken at home!  Its always a huge hit.  I put salt and pepper on the chicken before I put the sauce on cuz it always seems to need a little salt.  I also you apricot-pineapple preserves for some added sweetness.  We put it on top of white rice!  YUM!

I used 1 pkg of onion soup mix as others suggested and added chunk pineapple and used boneless, skinless chicken breast. Turned out good!

This recipe has been made by my family for about 30 years! We use ONE envelope of onion soup mix. I can't imagine it with two! It's already pretty salty! I also use boneless chicken to save on calories! YUM! Enjoy!

I'VE BEEN MAKING THIS RECIPE IN THE OVEN FOR YEARS NOW. I ALWAYS USE BONELESS CHICKEN AND COOK IT FOR ABOUT 1/2 AN HOUR OR SO. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAMILY'S FAVORITE DISHES, ESP MY HUSBAND! I LIKE THE IDEA OF USING A CROCK POT, WILL TRY THAT NEXT TIME.

Great  recipe! And is there room for a  chuckle?  I think it's amazing that h2odancerqt spent her childhood growing up in the oven (if I read her comment correctly).

I too only use one envelope of Lioton's. I spray the pan bottom and put two cups of brown rice with 3/4 cup water in first, then chicken, then sauce over it all. Comes out great with sauce on the rice and the chicken. I use 1 c preserves to half bottle of Russian.

Made these last night with fresh fried broccoli and rice to serve it on with a side of Best Egg Rolls from this site. Used boneless chicken breasts instead of a cut up chicken, put it in the crock pot, and cut back to 1 pack of onion soup. Close to the end it would take your breath if you tried smelling it due to the onion still overpowering it so I added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar. Helped some but I think next time I'll add the pineapple everyones talking about and see if it helps or completely eliminate the onion soup. Overall great meal just need to tweak it to our taste.

Delicious! My husband and I both loved this sauce.  We actually made chicken meatballs, browned them on both sides, then added the sauce and let it cook for about 30 minutes.  Served over rice and we both devoured it.  It sounds like a strange mix of ingredients but the end product was great!  Also, we added just a few shakes of red pepper flakes, gave it a little kick but not to much. Thanks for sharing!

The chicken wasn't overly flavorful but I enjoyed it. I don't know if I'll make it again, but it's a decent and relatively easy recipe.

I have been making this recipe for years. The family loves it.  It surely is a winner.   It also goes by the name Delicious Chicken.
