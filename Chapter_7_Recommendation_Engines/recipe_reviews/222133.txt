I added a few more spices to the flour and bread crumbs for a little kick. The chops browned very nicely--NONE of the breading fell off at all, which pleased me a great deal. When I made the "gravy", I used fat free evaporated milk (and I did use a little more than asked for--a full "soup can" for a little thinner gravy) only because I like the flavor that it gives to the recipe and it works better as a cooking milk. I added a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce to the "gravy". I served this with fluffy rice and garlic broccoli. Great comfort food, very similar to something Mom used to make for me when I was a kid.

These pork chops were amazing!  I only changed one thing and that was using cream of chicken soup rather than cream of mushroom just for personal preference.  These pork chops are so tender and tasty, my family loved it!

Surprisingly good, easy and very little clean up. Pour soup around the chops rather than over to keep the top crispier. Will make this again.

Ok... First of all there is no need to dirty a bunch of dishes. 1. You can dredge the chops in flour in a 1 qt bag then 2. use a 1 gallon bag for the bread crumbs. 3. I  drained the oil from the pan I cooked the chops in then added the soup mixture. That way you get all the flavor from  the yummy drippings. So you have the bowl from the eggs, the frying pan and the baking dish. Not too bad!:) if you want more gravy, just make a simple gravy with flour and chicken stock then add the soup mixture. My son ate it up really fast! :)

So yummy!!!  I substituted a few ingredients, but the pork chops turned out to be amazing!  Instead of garlic powder, I used Mrs. Dash table blend seasoning (out of curiosity of how it would taste).  After breading them, I sprinkled some basil on top - mostly to make it look snazzy.  Instead of using cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of chicken soup.  I omitted the white wine completely.  Served on a bed of brown rice.  The result was fantastic!!  We will definitely be making this again!

The family loved this dish.  The only thing I would different next time is spray the baking dish first.

As I suspected nothing "browned" in 10 minutes at 350.

I came across this recipe by accident. So glad I did. Was a nice change to our normal routine.  Would recommend doubling the sauce.  Other than that...no changes.

Note: this takes a while to cook.  I added real mushrooms, celery and peas to the sauce.

Our family LOVES these pork chops. I have made these a few times now for my family, and I always get requests to make them again. It is a fairly simple recipe with a delicious result. If you have the time to make them, I would do so tonight!

The only change I made was adding 1 TB of Worcestershire sauce to the sauce, and it was delicious! ! I also brined the pork chops (In water, salt, brown sugar and mustard powder) for 3 hours prior to baking.. they turned out sooo tender. I will definitely be making this again.

Tasty & pretty simple. This is a variation of a recipe I regularly use & it was nice for a change. Add some veggies & potatoes & it's a complete meal. PC's were tender & moist, I'd make it again.

These were very good! The only things I changed was changing the soup from cream of mushroom, which my wife despises,to cream of chicken and doubling the wine(which she loves). It was wonderful and she loved it!

This was a pretty good recipe. I wish it had a little more wine flavor, but overall, everyone seemed to like it just fine.
