This soup was great!  I followed the recipe as written, but made it before work and put all into the slow cooker after cooking the kale down a little.  I did not add the sausage, as the soup was flavorful and peppery without it, but will add some later for my husband, as he's more likely to eat it with the meat.  I was uncertain at first, as I've tried kale and some other greens before and found them too bitter, but this soup was a wonderful way to get the health benefits of kale and the other vegetables without the disadvantages of canned, high sodium soups.

A good, hearty soup to start. I ended up adding a few more things for flavor and heartiness. I added a tsp each of parsley, thyme and rosemary, doubled the garlic and added one cup of diced tomatoes in juice, a cup of white wine and a handful of chopped mushrooms. I also tossed in some chopped cooked kielbasa toward the end of cooking to add more protein. Yum!

This recipe is excellent! I served it over brown rice, and added less broth, so it was more of a stew than a soup.

I'm rather new to eating kale and this was the perfect recipe to start with.  I did cut back on the red pepper and used a mild italian sausage for my kids, but it still had a subtle heat to it. Talk about aromatics! This soup had my mouth watering before I even added the stock.  My husband, the kids, and I all loved it.  I will definitely make it again!

I LOVE soup.  I found this to be the tastiest I've ever made.  AND, I happen to be one of those who really likes spicy hot.  So, in addition to the 2T of red pepper flakes, I added jalapeno peppers.  Thanks, Lisa!

I would give it 5 stars but I thought it had way too much crushed red pepper.  I followed the recipe (except I cut the red pepper flakes by half).  Wonderful recipe and I plan to make this again and often!

Now really, does anything need 2 tablespoons of crushed red pepper flakes?  Could do with much less otherwise a great recipe.

I LOVE kale! It's so nutritious and delicious. This soup was great, and I would have given it 5 stars had it called for less red pepper flakes. It was so so spicy that I had to add more broth to tone it down. I will definitely make this again, but with a third or so of the red pepper flakes. I didn't use the sausage, but I did make tiny little meatballs which were great in this.

Fantastically easy and a great use for kale. I did find it a bit too spicy and next time I will reduce the red pepper flakes. But, there will be a next time! :)

Love it! I added some diced tomatoes, and didn't add the crushed red peppers. The sausage made it spicy enough for my two kids. I added extra crushed red pepper to my own as seasoning, along with some grated Parmesan. Yum! Thank you for the recipe.

Great for my Weight Watcher diet.  I used Jimmy Dean Turkey Sausage Crumbles for the sausage.  That eliminated the need to brown sausage.

Too spicy, and we usually like heat.  The broth lacks flavor, like it needed more herbs and spices.  I enjoyed using up my Kale, but I won't be making this again.  No one was wow'd by it at all.  (FYI--I did not make any changes to this recipe; everything was cooked as directed.)

Delicous.  I started the recipe as written and then tossed it in my crockpot for 8 hours on low.  I added the sausage to the crockpot.

This soup was great!  I changed a few things to add a Portuguese flavor.  I used extra Garbanzo beans doubled, double water and doubled the sausage amount.  I also used linguica, which is a very Portuguese style ingredient in food.  I did not have regular kale so I used red kale and it was just wonderful!  Hearty and delicious!

Awesome recipe!!  After reading the reviews, I cut the red pepper in half.  I also substituted veggie broth and tofurky italian sausage.  Finally, I threw in some chard with the kale, because I had to use it.  The soup was awesome, and my meat-eating boyfriend loved it too!  Will definitely be cooking this again!!

I love this soup. I had a bunch of kale from my csa so I made this according to the recipe except for halving the red pepper flakes - i'm afraid of all that heat. It was still quite spicy and delicious. Best Kale Soup I've made so far.

Loved this recipe! I don't eat a lot of meat so adding it at the end for others in the family was a bonus. I added more garlic, skipped the crushed red pepper, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. It was great being able to use such a healthy green and have the kids eat it :) I highly recommend this recipe!

This soup is fabulous!  In the spring, when kale is one of the first greens of the season, this is a great way to use it.  I used an entire pound of homemade, hotly spiced sausage and substituted homemade chicken broth and beef broth that I had around for the veggie broth.

This is an easy, hearty and healthy soup that is also really good!  I used veggie broth and left out the sausage and I used a third of the crushed red pepper flakes that was called for (2 tablespoons would make for a painful soup experience, IMO).  It has a great earthy flavor and looked pretty in the bowl, too!

I was looking for a stew/soup to use up some garden chard.  This was delicious.  I did not add salt or pepper flakes because I used a lot of sausage.  Very nice flavor and the  chickpeas make it hearty.

This soup is delicious!  I found it when I was looking for a kale soup recipe to use some kale up before it went bad.  So, it wasn't a planned meal.  I was just making it to freeze.  I had a spoonful before I froze it, and it was amazing!!  I did only two things different from the main recipe.  I used baby kale (because that is what I had) and I only put in 1 Tbl of red pepper flakes because I thought 2 would be too spicy for me.  1 Tbl was great.  It had really good heat, but it complimented the soup well.  I do think that 2 would have been too much for me, but if you like spice, go for it!!  I will make this soup again...and I might try adding some sweet potato in too.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I love this soup! It is so easy to make with ingredients I usually have in my pantry. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was too spicy for me. (And I'm korean so I eat a lot of spicy food!) Plus, I wanted my toddler to be able to eat it so I made a few modifications. I use sweet or regular Italian sausage and only add a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes. I usually add some siracha to my bowl right before I eat it because I do enjoy spicy, just don't want the entire pot to be so spicy! I also add a can of drained chopped tomatoes just because I think it adds a nice flavor. Otherwise, the recipe is perfect! I have also switched out the garbanzos with whatever beans I have in my pantry and it's still delicious.

I'm glad I read the comments on the crushed red pepper, I only used about 3/4Tbsp of it instead of the full 2Tbsp, and it worked well with the amount of heat it gave.  I didn't use the optional sausage since I didn't have any on hand. Because of this I made 2cups of the 6, beef broth to give a little meaty flavor.  The flavor of the broth was excellent, but the kale was overpowering.  It may have been my fault though.  I didn't have bunches of kale, just a big bag of chopped kale.  It may have been too much. I'm glad I tried it but I don't think I'll make again.

I was looking for something light after the holiday gluttony & this looked perfect! It's yummy! I was cleaning out the fridge so added a few stalks of celery & a few fresh jalapenos (so only did the red pepper flakes to taste). Next time I will use more seasoning as well. Maybe parsley & bay? But it's still a very delicious recipe as is!

I am new to kale and found this recipe to be easy and very flavorful. After reading other reviews on the crushed red pepper, I only used 1/2 tbsp. I used black-eyed peas and pre-cooked spicy Italian sausage(what I had on hand). I also put everything in the crockpot after cooking down the onions, carrots, garlic and kale then cooked it for about 5 hours on low. Served it over rice and it was wonderful. I wil make again. Thanks Lisa for the new kale recipe!

I just made this recipe. I definetly used alot less red pepper flakes! We were out of Italian sausage, so I used breakfast sausage links instead. I also added some spinach and cheese ravioli at the last 10 minutes of cooking. SUPERB!! We are for sure making this one again!!!
