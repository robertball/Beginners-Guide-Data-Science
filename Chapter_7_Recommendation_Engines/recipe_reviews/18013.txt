With changes this is a 5 star recipe! My husband is a German citizen, and we go there often for extended vacations, we always miss the bread when we get back. We have tried dozens and dozens of times to bake brotchen rolls, one weekend we made over a half dozen recipes, this was the best one of all the recipes we tried but we made *Several* changes to get the flavor we wanted. We only bake this kind of bread on a stone if possible. We also added about a tsp of salt, and increased the sugar to about 2 tbsp. Don't use water, but use whole milk instead. Make the rolls bigger, only 8 not 12. The second time they rise, don't cover them with anything. Finally about the actual baking. Place a tray of ice cubes on the bottom of the oven to create a nice steam in the oven, and only cook these on the bottom rack. Follow this method and it will be the closest you will get to real brotchen without going to Germany.

I will agree with the others, that it needs salt.
However, it is missing a more important ingredient, I believe.   In the 1960s, I lived with my parents, who were stationed in Baumholder, Germany, and we loved the fresh breads that were sold in the village.  However, there were two types of Brötchen:water and milk.   The milk  Brötchen was so much better, and we quickly quit buying the water Brötchen, in favour of the milk Brötchen. I suggest that the water be replaced with whole milk, or half/half.   You will clearly notice a Huge difference here.

I wish I had read the previous reviews before starting - this definitely could have used a pinch of salt, as the others noted.  But it was extremely easy (the FIRST successful thing I've made with yeast, I'm only 21 and haven't baked all that much).

I immediately baked half the recipe, but first I mixed it with small-cubed cheddar cheese, tiny chopped onions, and fresh garlic. I sprinkled the top with a little extra cheese.  They came out wonderfully!  Wow!

I took the other half and, as instructed in the page with general info about rolls, froze them in roll shape before baking.

These rolls have  a wonderful chewy texture.  They were very simple to make.  The flavor is a bit bland, however.  Next time I'm going to add a bit of salt.  But there will be a next time!

My daughter and niece both loved these rolls.  The adults in the family
thought it needed some salt.  It was easy to add, and got rave reviews.

I'm glad I read over the reviews before making this. Using 1 tsp of salt really brought out a good flavor to the bread.  I used water, but will try it with milk for comparison the next time I make it.  I am a beginner when it comes to baking but I found this recipe extremely simple and quite forgiving! While making the dough I was worried that it was too dry and added a little bit of water. It ended up making the dough wetter than I wanted. Lucky for me, using some of the reserved 1/2 cup of bread flour while kneading fixed it right up again.   Maybe it was because of my earlier fudge-up, but I ended up kneading the dough a little bit longer, about 10-15 mins. to get that good, squishy elasticity.  Instead of making 12 small rolls, I also made 8 slightly bigger rolls so I could use it to make sandwiches. In an end rush I forgot to separate my egg white and used the whole egg with some water to make the wash.. No biggie though. I baked them on a stone for 20 minutes until beautifully golden brown. After cooling they came out really soft and chewy.  I used them tonight to make buffalo chicken sandwiches and honey mustard chicken sandwiches. Both got rave reviews! This will definitely be one of my go-to recipes. Thank you so very much for sharing this!

Has a great crust, crispy without being tough, nice and soft on the inside, but *desperately* needs salt.

Definitely needs salt. Doubled so I could make long rolls for sandwiches; used almost 5 cups flour, not quite. Taste was good, except for needing salt, texture inside was great. However, outside came out too crispy, maybe it was the egg wash, I'm not sure. Will try with salt and no wash next time.

These were Very Good.  I did add a pinch of salt (per other reviewers) and I am really glad that I did.  Will definately make again.  Looks great for company.  Thanks for the post.

Great Recipe! I made a few tweaks: when placing rolls in over to bake, place a shallow dish with 1/2 cup of water on the bottom rack as well. The moisture helps to give it that great crust that you find at bakeries and is delicious. Additionally, I added cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon to the dough and then sprinkled the tops with cheddar cheese as well after I sliced an "x" into the top. Beautiful and delicious, my faince will be so happy!

It was very good- worth all that extra rising time.  I changed it a bit, and substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup white flour.  I was actually afraid it would be too salty, but once it was baked it was perfect.  Just like buns from a bakery!

This is the brotchen recipe that takes me back to Germany and the one I've been looking for a long time.  There is only one problem I noted with it and that is the lack of salt.  I added 1 tsp. (0.2 oz.) of salt and it made the difference!  Thanks for this one.

It tastes good. I thought it will rise like a bun but it didn't plus it is better to broil the top for a couple of minutes.

I read reviews by LSBUI and John L before starting and I'm glad I did. I took their suggestions and used milk (all I had was 1%) instead of water; it still wasn't quite salty enough.
I made the mistake of trying to make two recipes at once, in separate bowls - I won't do that again. the second bowl didn't rise like it should; they'll go in the freezer for the next time I make bread pudding. 
All in all it was a success, I think. My older son spent some time in Germany while he was in the Army and he approved; I'll be making these again.

Not a bad recipe, and the results are quite fluffy, but my attempt resulted in rather bland rolls. Great if you have something to dip them in, but otherwise, I'd pass for something more flavorful.
