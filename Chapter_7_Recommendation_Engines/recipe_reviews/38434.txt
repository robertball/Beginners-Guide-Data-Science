I am appalled that this recipe has not been removed or changed in all this time. In my foolishness I didn't read the comments stating the ratios were all wrong and you ended up with bland banana soup that can only be poured down the drain. What a waste of time and money. Please save others from this by dealing with this. This is a great site and this should have been dealt with by now.

SOMEONE PLEASE TAKE THIS RECIPE OFF THE SITE BECAUSE all I did was was waste a lot of food trying it.  The mixture is the consistancy of soup, and couldn't be formed into balls.  When I tried to compensate for the liquidity I wasted a whole bag of flour and 4 eggs.  Yuck, what a mess.  Too much milk and it tasted bland.

Something is wrong about this recipe.  I think the milk quantity is supposed to be 2/3 cup, not 2 cups!  I had to add almost three more cups of flour and it is still not right.  I'll keep trying though because banana fritters sound great!

I did this recipe but I only added 2 T of milk. They turned out really good I still couldn't roll them in my hand but dropped by spoon into pan of oil. They tasted really good. My friend who loves banana loved them.

When following this recipe I got liquid dough I wouldn't be able to form into a ball. By adding flour and sugar I got better consistency and fritters that tasted delicious. I wasn't able to repeat this again though, since I didn't measure what I was adding the first time.

This recipe cannot be made into fritters.There is to much liquid in it! But by adding 1/2 cup flour and 2tablespoons powered sugar, You can have some wonderful banana pancakes!!!
Serve with maple syrup or honey.

milk is way off. I slowly added the milk after mixing everything together until I got a batter that was thick enough to hold together and fry. Almost like a muffin batter :) The flavor was pretty good but it could use some sugar and I think brown sugar would give it an extra boost of flavor. I'd say about a 1/4 cup since you do add powdered sugar after frying. Just really wasn't sweet enough.

Absolutely one of the worst recipes ever!!! All it is is slop. All the ingredients are the wrong measuring amounts. Please do not use this recipe.
