My husband doesn't eat much fish,if it tastes the least bit fishy he won't eat it . I made this and he said it was the best he has ever eaten ,including any  five star restaurant . I will definitely make this again ,fortunately we have a very good specialty small grocery where I can buy good quality fresh fish . The key ingredient in my opinion is the smoked paprika  and jale

We loved this! my husband said "best fish ever". I did change 2 things-I used red pepper instead of jalapeño and 1T each of sherry and white wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar. I think next time I'll use a bit more liquid so there's more sauce for the potatoes! It was great!

Another 5 star fish from Chef John! I adjusted it to my 2 year old and the ingredients I had on hand. I used green bell peppers instead of red jalapeños, red wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, and leeks instead of green onions. I can't wait to try this with sherry vinegar as I think it would be even more delicious! I think I will also add 1/2 a sliced onion just because onion makes everything taste better ?? I paired it with roasted Brussel sprouts and sliced avocado. Amazing meal!

I was a little wary of trying a unrated recipe, but I have made one of Chef John's other recipes and took a chance.  I'm glad I did!  This came together pretty fast, looked beautiful and tasted great.  The marinade had such a different taste and was great with both the fish and the potatoes.  This would be a great dish for company.  The only thing I did differently was use 1 tablespoon of vinegar because my husband isn't a big fan of it.  He loved it!

I made it without potatoes.  I altered the recipe a bit. I miss read and added 2 tablespoons so the consistency was thicker and it coated the fish very well.  I didn't have Sherry vinegar, used red wine vinegar. I didn't have jalapenos so I used pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.  Even with all these changes it was amazingly tastey. My son love it! I will definitely make this again.

My only complaint on this one is that 15 minutes was too long to cook it.  Depending on the thickness of the fish, it may require much less, especially at 450, so make sure to to check it sooner.  I got busy and overcooked mine, which was a real shame.  The recipe itself, however, is very good.  It's rather easy to make with a good amount of flavor!  Would make this again for sure!

Did it for my picky kids, substituted all spicy peppers with 2 tablespoons of sweet chilli sauce, added carrots, celeries and tomatoes to the potatoes and onions. Baked the potatoes a bit while preparing the mixtures then put it in the microwave then the sauce and veggie mixture then with the fish in the oven. The sea bass was amazing, we freshly fought at a lodge around Vancouver island, this is a favourite recipe now ... Great shared info

Cooking time WARNING below!! Excellent flavors. The sherry vinegar makes it - awesomely tangy - delish. I think red wine vinegar could be substituted, but use the sherry if you can. Red/yellow/orange peppers sliced thin can be substituted for the red jalapeno. With sea bass so expensive, I think a thick cod filet could be substituted. 

BE AWARE... for a thick chunk of sea bass the cooking time is CRAZY wrong. It took over 45 mins and that was AFTER going in and out of the oven over and over and OVER, AND cutting it multiple times. It was worth it, but the "pre-cooked" potatoes were WAY overcooked. If guests had been seated it would have been an embarrassment. I have to say I've seen this lot lately in reviews of Chef John recipes. Maybe his oven his faster ;)

A hit with the whole family and a quick and healthy after work meal.  I didn't have any sherry wine so I used 2T white wine vinegar and 1T sherry cooking wine and the flavor was spot on.  I didn't have a red jalapeno pepper so I used a small yellow and orange pepper instead.  I steamed some fingerling potatoes for 5 minutes and then added the rest of the ingredients and sauce to the potatoes.  The sauce is great on the potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband bought some sea bass and I decided to try this. I didn't want to go to the store for one ingredient so based on reviews I did use wine vinegar instead of the white sherry  (don't care for it). I prepared it a bit different though after seeing the video. I doubled the batch of marinade and since I didn't mind extra dishes- I tossed the cooked potatoes with half the sauce and the other half with the fish. It was so good- my husband was super impressed and cant stop thanking me for preparing it so well. Everything had a pleasant clean taste, the sea bass came out perfect at 145F- we just really enjoyed it. It was both our first time eating sea bass and not our last thanks to this recipe. Thanks for sharing another great recipe- oh and it was super easy to make!

I used 5 potatoes because the wife and I love them. Next time I will double the sauce because the potatoes used up more than the sauce. Super aromatic with the smoked paprika.

This recipe is amazing!  I've made it 3 times and everyone always loves it. Ask your fish mart to take the skin off. Makes it much easier. So rich and buttery. Enjoy!

It has always been a success on presentation!  Great meld of flavors... I substituted red wine vinegar for the sherry vinegar which gave it a mild wine taste and it was not a problem of balance in the palate... Potatoes are an issue regarding how soft you'd like to have them ... But... Really... The flavor so overcame any problems of texture or consistency... Always a ++ palate able plate!!!!

I cut this in half since it was a meal for one- me! It was delicious even though I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted. I used a cod loin instead of sea bass.  I used white cooking wine instead of sherry. I had no paprika but I did have a chipotle pepper as a sub. I had no jalapenos and used red peppers.  And I only used one potato instead of the 2 the recipe would recommend for one person. I needed 18 minutes to get the fish to cook and it was amazing. I will most definitely cook this again. Feel free to play with the ingredients. The fish comes out great from the oven. Good luck.

This was a really great way to have fish! I boiled the potatoes out of preference. I used 3T of the oil and Sherry and doubled the paprika for more of a sauce per suggestions. I didn't have green onion so I sautéed  thin slices of the green part of a leek in butter for a couple of minutes to make sure they would be tinder after the 15 minute baking. I used red bell and green jalapeno too, so I tossed those in the hot butter for just a minute with a bit of garlic to mix everything up before adding it to the vinaigrette. My store didn't have bass so I used a tilapia fillet, it was still good. Next time I'll go for a meatier fish. Thank you for another great, and fast dinner!

Absolutely excellent and delicious!!! I do not cook fish often and this recipe will be one I will always use! You don’t smell the fish even cooking. The combination of spices and vinegar combination masks any fish smell or taste. It is a must have and do! Thank you Chef For such an awesome recipe!

Both of my local fish stores were sold out of sea bass, so I made this with cod loin. I am so glad I did because the cod loin was superb in this recipe--at 1/3 the price of sea bass. For the potatoes, I used 3/4 lb. of mixed white, red, and blue baby potatoes. I pierced them, then microwaved them for 3 1/2 minutes. Next time, I'll microwave for 4 or 4 1/2 minutes, because they were a little al dente. This recipe has definitely earned a spot in my regular dinner rotation, for its ease, high flavor profile, and--thanks to my substitution of cod loin for sea bass--affordability.

Fish melts in your mouth and the taste was amazing. I had to do some changes because I can't eat spicy food, so the hot peppers got substitute for green beans and I just had regular paprika. Will make it again, probably try with another kind of fish.

Excellent flavors, the smoked paprika and jalapeño really complements the sea bass. As an added bonus, this dish is both healthy and quick to make! Thanks Chef John.

Minus one star since the vinegar didn't "cook off" for me. Otherwise, delicious. Thanks, Chef John.

Delicious recipe and cook time is spot on! I was looking for a recipe to make black bass and a friend referred this recipe to me. Instead of red jalapeno, I used red bell pepper. I can imagine how the heat would give this dish an extra umph but we thought it was great, especially the potatoes. Next time, I would lightly coat the fish first and remove to a plate, and then add in the green onion, pepper, and potatoes. The fish was good, but the flavors of the dressing/sauce wasn't even subtly present. Overall, very good and I would make this dish again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with changes.  I looked all over for Chilean Sea Bass.  No one had it.  My local fish market told me it is over fished and on the verge of becoming endangered, so I elected to substitute with some really good quality Cod.  Instead of baking this on the potatoes, I used the seasonings and grilled it outdoors.  I made the potatoes separately.  It was a hit, even with my 12 year old boys who don't usually like fish.  The flavor was  delicious.

I used pomegranate balsamic vinegar because that was all I had. I used sliced radishes instead of potatoes due to my dietary restrictions. Absolutely delicious! Definitely a recipe to impress guests, if you can afford to buy the sea bass.

So good we are having again in a week.  Could not find red jalapeno. I subed in some (2 tbl) sweet chili sauce and that was a great flavor surprise.

I thought I had Sherry Vinegar, but when I got it out it was Sherry Wine, so that's what I put in.  Everything turned out very well even with the flub up.  I think it might be even better because people were complaining about the vinegar taste.  I will cut the oil back a little next time.  I watched the video of Chef John, and he is a little heavy handed with the olive oil. I followed his lead this time, but next time I will make it lighter.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have the thick cut, just the frozen filets and it still turned out well. I made it with only 1/2 tsp. of salt because I cook for a 97 year old man that cannot have much sodium. He LOVED it and so did I. I think the vinegar really helped with the flavoring of which now I think I'm going to try using the sherry/vinegar to flavor other recipes. Really the only issue I had was trying to find a "sherry vinegar" so I bought the separately. Thank you, Chef John! I use a lot of your recipes!

Super highly rated by so many but it was just okay for us. We purchased fresh sea bass and the fish was lovely but the marinade wasn't for us - lots of vinegar. My ten year old is a very adventurous eater but she wasn't up for it either. Watched the video, followed the recipe, etc.

This is a very simple, easy to cook and  it is delicious.
Found this recipe while my wife was away for a few days and I had to cook myself something  easy.
For now on, this is our go to recipe for fish.

This was a great dish - I substituted with black sea bass that I caught and it was great. May also substitute red jalapeno with cherry peppers next time but this was super easy and tasted great.

I wasn’t expecting much (even with the good ratings) but this was really tasty. My only change was that I added just a touch of balsamic.

I didn't have any sherry vinegar so I used italian dressing and added extra olive oil.  Delicious and super easy to make.  I also used two fresh potatoes instead of canned.

Didn't have sea bass: used cod instead.  Not a great substitution.  Still, it was a good dish.  I plan to use the recipe again with grouper, halibut or sea bass.

Wow, what an easy way to prepare sea bass (or probably any other white fish)! I didn't have jalapeños or green onion so I just used a little cayenne pepper and onion powder. Instead of sherry vinegar I used apricot white balsamic and MMM...delish. The smoked paprika is a must. And I steamed the potatoes about 20 min and that was perfect for finishing the roasting. Make extra marinade...just yum.

OMG this was fantastic- and we are fish people.  I used sherry cooking wine and would recommend using a thinner filet; the filet I bought was very thick and took quite awhile to cook.  Doubled the amount of sauce; probably could use less of the oil.  Will definitely make this again!

I caught some sea bass recently off of Montauk Point, NY and decided to give this recipe a try.   Everyone loved it.  I didn't have smoked paprika so i added some chipotle seasoning and it worked great.  Terrific way to do any kind of sea bass for sure.
