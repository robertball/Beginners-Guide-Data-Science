I made this cake twice yesterday.  I used a 12 cup, 10" inch bundt pan.  I beat the sugars/butter for about 8 minutes & another 3-4 minutes after adding eggs.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp salt to the dry ingredients. The cake was HUGE, moist & smelled wonderful when baking.  I made the 1st cake with pecans & it was delicious.  I made the 2nd cake without pecans and topped the slightly warm cake with a caramel frosting which dripped down the sides. YUMMY! (Caramel frosting: melt 1/2 stick real butter over low heat; add 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup milk; heat until almost boiling.  Remove from heat and cool 10 min.  Add 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Beat in 2 cups sifted confectioners sugar until smooth.  Cool 5 minutes and spoon on warm cake).  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made it tonight.  Followed exactly - came out great!  I read earlier comments.. You shouldn't lessen the sugar, it'll make the cake less dense.  Also, it's very important to add sugar very slowly.  Take 5-7 minutes to add.    Add eggs one at a time and beat until just blended.  Don't over beat eggs!  Your cake will overflow if you do.

I baked mine in a metal bundt pan for 70 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

after reading all the reviews, I did decide to modify this recipe just a bit to add more flavor.  I added: 1/2 tsp salt to dry ingredients; to the egg& sugar mixture I also added: 1 tsp of "vanilla butter&nut extract" (it's by mccormick and in most stores), 1 tsp of lemon zest (helps balance out all the sweetness) and substituted half&half instead of milk.  I ground the pecans in the food processor untill they were fine but not dust or paste, about 20 sec maybe; folded them in at the end.  For a glaze I did: 6 tbl butter, 3 tbl corn syrup, 1/2 tsp lemon zest, 1/4 c brown sugar.  Cooked over med heat for until well combined and butter is completely melted.  Off heat add: 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp of the vanilla butter extract and 1 cup of finely chopped pecans.  It should resemble the topping for a sticky bun, thick and gooey.  Spoon over the top of the cake when still warm.  It is very sweet and decadent dessert that is fabulous for company.  I sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar around the plate when I served it.  It was beautiful and scrumptous and everyone loved it!  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!!!

I make many pound cakes and am always testing recipes for new ones.  This one is a hit!  Great texture and flavor.  Add icing if you need a little pizzaz, but wonderful by it's self.  Great for breakfast too!

I think I found a new pound cake recipe.  This is a delicious, moist and flavorful cake.  I got it out of the oven around 7 o'clock that evening, and by the end of the day there was barely a piece left for me.

Wow! Not for anyone watching their calories and weight but...wow! Shared a piece with a friend this morning: her review..."it was the BEST thing I have EVER put into my mouth!" I think that pretty much sums it up. Made it exactly as stated but used the frosting from Caramel Poundcake recipe. Delish.

Personally, I thought this was bland and too crumbly (2-stars at best) BUT my family gives this a 4-star rating. They thought it was really good. Thank goodness I headed others advice: I added a handful of Hershey's cinnamon chips to the bottom of the cake pan before I poured the batter in and another small handful into the batter itself. Without this addition - I doubt I would have a received the high approval rating from my family that it did. Tastes similar to a sugar cookie but too plain for me (very unusual!). I'll let my family eat this cake up but I'm sorry - I just don't think I'll make it again.

WOW!  This was a wonderful pound cake.  The brown sugar just gave it a nice flavor that was not your usual pound cake.  I doubled the vanilla called for and made it in a bundt pan.  I made sure to really whip the sugar and butter, adding both gradually to really keep it light and fluffy, and added each egg slowly as well. It was easy and everyone loved it.  Served it topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was fine, but it didn't turn out like a pound cake at all, just a regular cake in a bundt pan.  It didn't have the pound cake crust, or really firm texture.  It was firm enough, just not like a pound cake.  However, it did come out of my rose bundt pan looking beautiful.  And everyone loved it.  We had it with ice cream.  Good brown sugar flavor.  I did cut back on the white sugar by about 1/4 cup, and it was still plenty sweet.

This recipe made a really moist and interesting cake. I love the pecans! They add something extra and keep it from being too plain, but it still remains simple. I don't make pound cake often, but when I do again, I will use this recipe.

This is the best pound cake!  It turned out so moist, not too sweet.  My husband and his friend raved over it!  It is a big cake, but my hubby didn't mind that!  I just made a simple warm powdered sugar glaze.  Just melt 1/3 stick butter in saucepan and stir in 2 C. powdered sugar and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Add 2-4 tbsp water, 1 tbsp at a time until smooth and sort of like a thick syrup.  Then you drizzle it over the cooled cake!  YUMMY!!  Great for the Thanksgiving and CHRISTmas!  Will make again!  Thanks! =)

Skipping the pecans didn't compromise any flavor, that's for sure!  Hubs asked if there was maple syrup in the cake because it tasted just like waffles and maple syrup! Can't do any complaining about a cake that tastes like waffles and syrup, right?

Excellent and easy. You do need a large bundt pan for this recipe though. I used a square bundt pan which takes larger recipes.

Moist and falvorful this cake. Can not understand reviewers saying it was dry. You do need to beat butter and sugar thoroughly, and the same goes for the eggs.   After it sits a few days the texture and flavour improves.   Thanks for submitting - it is a classy cake.

Fabulous! I did change the recipe up a bit. I am in grad school for gastronomy and our class was doing coffee history one week. We all take turns bringing food to class, so I made this fabulous recipe, replacing half the milk with espresso, and the pecans with white chocolate chips. It was just decadent!

Perhaps it's better right out of the oven, but I found this cake to be rather bland.  Personally, I think it would benefit from cinnamon chips or a cinnamon crumb topping.  It didn't seem to be anything special.

Dense and moist, with a nice butterscotch flavor, not too sweet. I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top. It would also probably be good with a light orange glaze.

Made this cake 12/13/10 for my co-workers.  Everyone loved it so much I had to join allrecipes to rate/review.  It was great!  No complaints whatsoever.  I made no changes.

I left out the pecans and added a dash of cinnamon.  The cake came out very, very nice.  When warm, my husband said it tastes like a pancake.  It  tasted very good, the brown sugar was subtle.  I thought it needed a little something..maybe a little salt?   I would definitely make this agian.

I made this yesterday.  It was delicious!!!! Next time I will not add pecans for a change.  Or 1/2 called for.  I used it for a strawberry shortcake base and we loved it.  No changes to it except I did cut it down for 8 servings and put in a loaf pan and had to cook it too long to get it done inside and too brown on the outside.  Will use less batter in loaf pan. But that was my problem. Thanks for a delicious, easy dessert cake.

i emitted the pecans and added finely chopped walnuts instead.. 
this cake was to die for. just the right amount of sweetness and it was super moist and had a wonderful texture. i made enough for a bundt cake and there was still some batter left over, which i poured into these bite size cupcake molds. amazing!

This cake was outstanding!!  Very moist and just the right amount of sweetness.  The chopped pecans was a nice addition. I did not change a thing when I made it.  My husband, sister, and 2-yr-old daugther loved it.  Needless to say I did as well.  I topped it with caramel frosting, a recipe I got from this site.  It was fantastic.  I will definitely make this one again....especially this Christmas!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I had two brown sugar pound cake recipes I tried last week and I thought this was the better one by far.  It was like a pecan chew made into a pound cake.  Really yummy.

I kept in mind what everyone was saying about the dryness and slight lack of flavor and added 2 tbsp of oil and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. It turned out to be pretty good. It's really good with strawberries and whipped cream!

Today makes the second time I  made this cake in a month and both times I've had issues with it being really crusty and the edges falling off. The first time I camouflaged it with Carmel Icing. Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong or has other experienced this also but doesn't mention it. The cake though covered with Carmel Icing got mad reviews and requests for more. HELP PLEASE!!!!!

I didn't realize that this recipe made so much!  I only had a loaf pan.  I would highly recommend halving the recipe if you're not wanting to make a large bundt.  I ended up having to make two loaves because I had so much batter.  When using a loaf pan, increase the cooking time to 75 minutes.  At 60 minutes, it's still gooey in the middle.  Also, for a better flavor, use a tablespoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of almond extract.  That helps with the complaints on here about the cake being too bland.  Also, I sprinkled a sweet cinnamon sprinkle on top with crushed walnuts and it came out delicious (the ends were a little tough, but soften up nicely with whipped cream on top).  :)  All in all, a delicious cake recipe I'll add to my box.

The only change was I didn't add any pecans. Because we didn't have any. We had walnuts And I wasn't sure about adding them. I also added homemade carmel icing.

I'm glad I made it. It's absolutely delicious. We are having it with vanilla ice cream.

I subbed milk for sour cream and added a 1/4 cup of maple syrup. I also creamed the brown sugar with the butter and folded an extra tbsp of vanilla into the Mix after the flour. 
It was yummy!

This recipe is wonderful.  I paired it with Butter Pecan Ice Cream and it vanished.  Thanks for this beautiful cake.  I'm sure to be making it many more times.

Absolutely delicious.  Next time may try reducing butter to 1 cup and adding 1/2 c applesauce, (just to cut down on so much butter).  I'm sure it won't be as rich, but maybe we won't notice it too much.

I've made this a couple of times for my family and also for a graduation party (I'm a professor at a small college and we have an annual party for graduating seniors in the department). I omitted the nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe. Rave reviews from all, but the best comment came from a student who suggested we serve the cake in our intro classes to recruit majors with the promise of getting it again when they graduated. Senior grades were in and I didn't even have him in a class that semester, so it wasn't just brown nosing.

I followed the directions exactly and the cake came out beautifully.  It has a lovely dense texture and was extremely moist. Decreasing the sugar will affect moisture and density. The crust had that wonderful crunch that a pound cake should. I used high quality ingredients. If you got a poor result that may be a consideration. This is definitely one of the best cakes I've made.

I made this cake and my family absolutely loved it.  I incorporated a few variations of my own which I would recommend.  I added 1/2 tsp salt as recommended by others and instead of the pecans I used Heath English Toffee chips in the batter.  This recipe makes a large pound cake and it was very moist.  I made a caramel icing using a recipe from another reviewer, but the cake would be just as good without the additional frosting.

This was my first time I ever made a pound cake from scratch but it came out beautifully. I did make one change which was used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  Everybody body loved it and I will use this again but next time make a glaze to go with it. :-)

I adapted this recipe to my taste. I omitted the white sugar, glad I did because the cake is sweet enough. It would have been too sweet with the white sugar as well. I loved the look of the batter and it was light and moist when I tried it. I didn't let it completely cool before trying a slice, it is lovely warm and fully cooled. I also used self raising flour as I did not have baking powder to hand and omitted the nuts as my partner doesn't really like cakes with nuts in them.

My family and I loved this! Had great texture and flavor! I did half the recipe to make a loaf pan since there are only four of us and I did omit the pecans (don't like pieces of things in cake). I went on the side of caution and used 3 eggs when I halved it, figured it wouldn't hurt. I had to cover it with foil for the last 20 mins of baking to make sure the tip didn't burn. I also used a caramel frosting but im sure it'd be delicious plain too.

This was a good recipe. It wasn't very fluffy, I don't enjoy my cakes dense. But it must have been something I did wrong. The flavor was great though. I think I'll try to learn from my mistakes and make this again.

Delicious!  Makes a nice big cake.  I omitted pecans, very good recipe, will definitely be making this again.  Made the mistake of trying to put all batter in my Temptations Bundt pan, about  1/3 too much batter.  Made a small loaf pan with extra third.

I'm not a great baker, so I was scrupulous about measuring, beating, mixing, blending and stirring…so I know I prepared it properly.  This cake was a huge disappointment. It had no flavor, bland and didn't smell great while baking.

I used someone's suggestion of substituting almond milk, and I substituted toasted walnuts instead of pecans only because I had no pecans.  This cake is sooooo delicious.  Even the crust has a caramelly taste.  It does not need a glaze.  Such a treat for the first day of Autumn. . . and the second . . . and every day after!

This cake was a hit at my roommate's Bday party.  I modified it significantly.  I added 1/4 cup Hennessy and substituted almond milk for the cow milk.

The cake was super moist, super delicious and the brown sugar glaze (brown sugar, butter melted together with 2 tblsp cream and 1/4 tsp salt added) with almond slivers made it lovely.  

Also, it was very tall.  Very. Make sure your bunt pan is large enough.

So I had some issues with this recipe, but it may very well have been me. The ingredients went together with no issue, but when it came time to put them in the pan (I was using the rose bundt like the one pictured) there was WAY too much batter! I ended up making 2 bundts out of this! (One rose and one heart) I admit that the rose could have been more full, but the heart bundt rose right to the brim and the rose wasn't far behind. As far as baking goes, the heart came out more evenly cooked and took less time that the rose- but this may have been the pan/my oven. Overall, the recipe tasted great, I just wish I could figure out why it didn't work out so well for me.

I made this for a bake sale, and let me tell you, it was a real act of charity to give it away.  The batter and crumbs were delicious and I only wish I could have had a big piece.  It smelled wonderful when baking.  I used Caramel Frosting I on it.
10/20/08--I wanted to try this cake so badly that I bought it back at the bake sale!  It's very good, has the brown sugar taste, the right pound cake consistency, and is very moist.

Great flavor and it's nice and moist.  It baked up with no problem and I like the nuts and might even add a 1/2c mini chocolate chips next time.  The brown sugar flavor reminds me of chocolate chip cookies so I think it'll be a great match but I don't want to make it too chocolatey.

I'm really not impressed with this recipe. I had to give it a three b/c it is way too dense for my liking and it wasn't that flavorful (even though I added an extra half teaspoon of vanilla and two pinches of salt). It's not a bad recipe but in my opinion, the major problem was the density (no cake should be this heavy!).

This cake was very easy to make and everyone (including kids) loved it. I served it with just warmed up jar carmel sauce drizzled over each individual piece. Left overs held up very well. A nice change of pace from typical chocolate/yellow/carrot cakes.

excellent, i added 1/2 tsp salt 1 tsp brandy extract, and the frosting from TLBRAN, soooo good. Also I had to cook a lot longer.
