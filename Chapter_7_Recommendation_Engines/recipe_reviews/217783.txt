I made this on the weekend and it is the most flavourful ginger marmalade that I have ever tasted. I made one minor change to the directions on this marmalade because  I have been making jam for years and years so after I added the pectin, I removed the pot from the heat and stirred and skimmed for 7 minutes instead of turning the pot to a simmer and cooking an additional 7 minutes with the pectin added to the pot.This is what I do with the other jams and marmalades that I have made. I also didn't use the hot water bath in the recipe. I sterilized my jars by washing them in hot soapy water and rinsing in clean water, then I placed them in a pre heated 225 degree oven for 10 minutes. I washed the lids the same way and boiled them for 1 minute to sterilize. I poured the hot marmalade into the warm jars and immediately put the lid on and tightened. I have used this sterilization method for years and found that it is so quick and easy. This recipe made 2 1/2 500ml jam jars for me.

This recipe does not work as it is written.  The ginger in little 'cubes' becomes floating fibrous chunks.  We boiled it for 3+ hrs in hopes the pieces would disintegrate but they didn't.  We added copious amounts of extra water for the long boil. 
    Adding more water to create a reasonable consistency on the second day still left crunchy bits.
     In order to salvage the batch, we fished out the floating cubed bits, and added 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/2 cup orange juice.  We also used powdered pectin when we added the sugar rather than liquid pectin.  It is delicious.
       I would like to give zero stars because you should find a different recipe but the smallest number allowed is 1

This recipe makes absolutely amazing ginger marmalade. It is not very labor intensive and you get a phenomenal product. I like to eat it plain on toast or whisked with some garlic and soy sauce to make a teriyaki glaze. And don't be afraid of the "chunks" of ginger, they become almost candied in the final product and give it a really nice texture.

It was the first time I made ginger marmalade, and this recipes worked out very well. The taste is amazing! I made 2 changes: I used 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup of the ginger-flavored water, and I reduced the amount of sugar to 4 cups, which I think is plenty. Other than that I stuck to the recipe, and we love the result!

The recipe worked out well, but it had a learning curve for me as I had never cooked ginger before.  Some of the little cubes didn't soften.  I think it must depend a lot on the age of the ginger root.  Also, one must be aware that the fiberous, stringy parts of old ginger root don't soften much with cooking either.  Don't include them in your mix. That said, after I fished out the hard parts and the fiber, I made some great jam from the recipe.

I really liked this recipe but it didn't set up terribly firm in my jars -- maybe my liquid pectin pouches are smaller than the ones used? I didn't think they would be, I just used a pouch of Certo liquid pectin and I find I tend to have this problem with liquid pectin in general... I'm debating whether or not to open all my jars and re-boil to get a more jelly marmalade. I did open one and try some on bread and it was so delicious the way it is! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly but I was very careful when shredding the ginger to stop when my piece was too fibrous to properly grate any more... I think this contributes to a possibly stringy/crunchy marmalade people experienced. I also think using a food processor for the grating might let some of those fibrous pieces sneak in. I didn't cut very much of it into cubes as I was paranoid of a woody piece of ginger making it into the pot. The only change to the recipe I made was I added a few thinly sliced rings of a small orange for a bit of variation. It's nice to see little flecks of orange in the jars. I also added a bit of green dye to make some jars into festive gifts for the holidays and those are very pretty -- otherwise the marmalade turned out a lovely bright yellow. It's a bit of a labour-intensive project but it is so tasty! I'd make this again, but I might use powdered pectin to see the difference.

ETA: This recipe as-is has grown on me! Just know it's not as firm as a "jelly" but not at all bad, very tasty

Marmalade and cordial! I kept the liquid after you strain the fruit, mixed the liquid half and half with sugar and make a delicious cordial! You could also use it as a sweet hot tea.  
Instead of liquid pectin I used 2 tablespoons powdered pectin. I didn't cool the mixture either, just strained it after cooking, added the powdered pectin, boiled a few minutes then added the sugar and hard boiled for another seven minutes. It turned out really well! I will make it again for sure.

First time making jam or marmalade and this turned out FABULOUS!  After reading reviews I decided to food process all the ginger into little bits rather than making a grated+cube mix.  I boiled it until I only had a little liquid left to make sure the ginger was starting to get tender (this took over an hour as stated in instructions, regardless of the ginger being in bits)l and not larger chunks).  I let it cool as instructed then made my pectin mixture, since I bought Sure-Jell pectin powder instead of liquid.  Then, I added 4 cups of sugar instead of 5 and let that simmer for a really long time on low until the liquid from sugar decreased then added my pectin.  I let that simmer for a while.

Loved it - so powerful! I tamed it a little by adding a cooking apple and some lemon. I agree that the bits that are chopped up have to be very tiny to become soft - tried it with all grated ginger but it is better with some small bits of ginger in the mix.

Tastes delicious, but didn't set up firmly enough.  

My guess is that draining the cooked ginger (the cooking worked fine for me, unlike for several of the reviewers here), and using 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid is too much; I'd guess the strained, cooked ginger has enough moisture for the marmalade.

I'm also surprised by the direction to boil the ginger + cooking liquid + sugar for only one minute, but then boil an additional 7 minutes after addition of the pectin.  Most jam recipes I've used that call for pectin are written exactly the opposite -- cook the fruit + sugar for several minutes, add pectin, then cook one minute more.

I made a bitter orange/ginger/cardamom version with an extra cup of brown sugar. It turned out golden and rustic. The whole house smells amazing! Good recipe!

This is a great recipe. For those who didn't like the texture, make sure you are only using ginger that cuts very easily. If it is tough or stringy it will probably be like that in the cooked product. Just for fun I added several drops of Doterra's essential  ginger oil. I agree with Cupcake about taking the mixture off the stove and stirring for 7 minutes.  This makes sure the chunks of ginger will be well distributed.

The flavor is incredible - my whole extended family loves it spread on toast.  I've made it a few times and once when toying around with the sugar content it came out quite liquid-y.  No problem!  A couple tablespoons of the syrupy version stirred into hot water tastes amazing (especially when you have a cold!).  I also added it to carbonated water once to make ginger ale when my husband felt sick and we didn't have ginger ale at home.  The original recipe is awesome, though!  Thanks.
