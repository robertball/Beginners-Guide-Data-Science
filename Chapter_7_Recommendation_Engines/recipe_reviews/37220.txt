Awesome!  Delicious!  Very quick and easy to make.  It is wonderful just as it is.  A good variation of this would be to saute artichoke hearts with the garlic and use penne pasta to make a heartier dish.  As is, this dish will remain in my collection of frequently cooked meals.  Thanks, Southern Living!!!

Easy recipe, though not too flavorful (I had added an extra clove of garlic).  No one in my family enjoyed it. I will not make this again.

This recipe is very delicious..flavorful but not overpowering. I used fresh spinach and grated parmesan cheese. I wish I had shredded, but that will have to be for next time. I did what a previous reviewer said and sprinkled the pine nuts on top instead of tossing them in, and it worked great! They're a really good addition. I'd make this again!

This recipe was actually very good..  I was a bit wary of having pasta without any sort of sauce, but it was delicious in the end.  I used grated parmesan instead of shredded, but shredded would have made it better.  I used 3/4 of the Spinach asked for (thinking it may have been too much) but what's called for is definately the best amount I now realize.  I added a bit more garlic and it went well.  What I recommend to others with the (nonessential) nuts is to save some to sprinkle on top after tossing the pasta or else the nuts tend to collect at the bottom.  Thanks for the recipe!
