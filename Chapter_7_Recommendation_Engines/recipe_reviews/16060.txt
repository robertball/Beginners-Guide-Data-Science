This recipe was delicious! I tweaked it a little bit to fit my tastes. Instead of a graham cracker crust I used an Oreo pre-made crust. Delicious! I also used light cream cheese and fat free Cool Whip. To the cool whip/cream cheese mixture, I still added the vanilla extract, but also added some sugar free vanilla pudding mix (just the powder). It makes it even better! I also layered the pie-bottom with cream cheese mixture, topped with "light" cherry pie filling, another lay er of cream cheese and finished off with a top layer of cherries! If you love cherries and do the layering technique--I would suggest 2 cans of cherry pie filling. All in all--recipe was awesome! Boyfriend and I loved it! Perfect Valentine's Day dessert!

I've brought tons of desserts to my workplace for years, much to the delight of my co-workers, but this holiday recipe just brought the house down on February 14th!  The really nice thing, though, is that you can make it any time of the year ... and that's why I made and brought another one the very next day - with the same positive reception from everyone who loved it the first time!  An outstanding recipe that I'll never stop making - Thanks, Karela!

I followed the recipe as directed only using reduced fat cream cheese and "free" whipped topping. I also made my own crust and strawberry topping. WAY too sweet for us. I think this would be much better as a frozen pie without the topping. As it was, the filling was goopy and flavor-wise, it was like melted soft-serve. It was a quick pie (after my cupcakes bombed) that could be made lighter and more personal but it just wasn't a hit with us. NOTE: And so my review isn't misunderstood, I've made pies like this with fat free ingredients and had a good outcome. I think what my issue could have been was the confectioners sugar. When I make this with granulated sugar, I don't have that issue. It's like whipping butter with sugar, it fills with air and "puffs". This didn't do that. It was gloppy and overly sweet. Maybe too much of the confectioners sugar?

I'am 48 years old and you are right this is the best recipe my mother made this every Christmas, when I was a child
she call it Cherry Delight and used the box mix to make the cool whip. I also make this during the winter and Christmas this pie is the Bomb! I did ever think I would see this recipe anywhere!

This is one pie that is easy to make.  I would recommend using the "light" cherry pie filling which has less sugar- it compliments the sweetness of the filling.  Looks beautiful and is sure to make your valentine smile.

I made this for valentines day and it was terrific! The whipped topping made it creamier and not as thick and rich as regular cheesecake~ it went over very well with my boyfriend too! Thanks!

Great if you want something quick and easy.  I made this to "woo" my boyfriend into my arms (or so he says).  Followed the recipe to the letter, was perfect as is.

I really liked this!  Made a regular pie crust, no time to run out to the store.  Also I used Dream Whip in place of the frozen whipped topping.  Thanks for this yummy recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

Great pie! I made it for a Valentines Day party and they were a hit. I made two pies and they were gone before any of the other treats. I added a few teaspoons of lemon juice to add some zing. Delicious.

**Also I decorated the top with some canned whipped topping (the stuff you put on ice cream). Not a good idea. The flavors did not mesh.

My Mom always made this when I was growing up.  Instead of cherry she used a can of crushed pineapple (without the juice) and pineapple cream cheese.  It was so good.  This isn't a new recipe but a super easy no bake "cheesecake", and if you haven't tried it you should.  So I will give this recipe 5 stars even though I haven't made this one, but it is identical to (other than the fruit used) my mom's...

This pie is very good.  I would reduce the powdered sugar to 3/4 cup, though.  (Maybe even 1/2 cup next time.)

This is super simple to make. I had a 9 serving graham crust, so I wanted more filling. I used two packages of cream cheese, instead of one, which made it more like cheesecake- except fluffier.  Instead of cool whip, I made (a half batch) of the homemade the whipped cream recipe from this website.  Used pineapple pie filling, instead of cherry, since that is what is preferred by my family.  So, this was a great base recipe, and I'm sure it's great as is, without changing it.

This was great and sooooo easy!  Next time I might add just a bit less powdered sugar and a bit more cherries (without the syrup).  Thanks for sharing!

I'd had this recipe years ago as a child, and had been searching for it ever since. I typed in the ingredients that I remembered and up popped this recipe! It was exactly what I was looking for- it brought me back to my childhood again! I couldn't believe how easy it was to make too!

i loved this "cheese cake" pie!
in stead of the canned cherries on top--i made my own stawberry sauce.
we had this for our easter desert.
