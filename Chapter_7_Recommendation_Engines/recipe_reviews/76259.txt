The only thing I would change is the corn meal.  It just ended up being crunchy and disturbing an otherwise pleasant pancake experience.  I did add flax meal and oats instead of some of the flours that I didn't have on hand.

THIS IS A SUPER RECIPE. WHAT A HEALTHY FIBER BREAKFAST THAT TASTE WONDERFUL. I WOULD SUGGEST THIS TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR BETTER HEALTH. I DID ADD A FEW THINGS. I ADDED SOME CHOPPED APPLES AND CINNAMON.  I DID'NT HAVE DRIED BUTTERMILK BUT I HAD POWDERED MILK .I DID NOT HAVE WHEAT GERM, SO I USED WHEAT BRAN WHICH DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF WHEAT BRAN. WITH SOME SUGAR FREE SYRUP I WAS IN HEAVEN. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECPIE.

I thought this recipe was great. The second time I tried it I added some multigrain pancake and waffle mix from heartland foods. I bought it several weeks ago and it makes a great addition to a lot of recipes. Enjoy
