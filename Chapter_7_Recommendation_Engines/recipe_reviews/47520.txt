I am a consummate pepper jelly maker...so I will tll you how I make this wonderful recipe. 

I use 6 cups of sugar. Add a tbsp. or 2 of butter just before you put the certo in...it keeps the foam down. Also I do not remove the seeds. Just put all the peppers into the food processor and grind finely. I do not stain...so the final result is more like jam than jelly. I boil for a few minutes after adding the certo...about 3 to 5 minutes. It 'jells' beautifully and is delicious.

I made this for my husband.  He loved it.  I didn't strain the jalapenos before adding the pectin, so it was more of a jam.  My hasband said that the only thing it needed was more spice.  But that was my fault because I removed *all* of the seeds and ribs before blending.  Thanks!

The liquid arrived at in step 2 has been changed to 1 cup. We have updated this recipe to change the amount of the yield. It should be 2 (8 ounce) jars instead of 4.

Great!!!! I had to make some modifications being diabetic. Here is the recipe with splenda.

Same ingredients as above except: sugar & pectin
•	1 box sure jell for no sugar recipe (mix with ¼ cup real sugar) set aside
•	5 ½ cups splenda:  set aside
•	1 ½ cups water                                                               
DIRECTIONS
1.	Same as above
2.	Same as above set aside for the moment
3.	Use large pan: Add water, to this add the sure jell with sugar added stir,  add peppers. Bring to a full boil, boil 1-3 min. Stirring constantly

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!!  I have made it twice and followed it exactly.  I did get more than one cup of juice but it didn't seem to make any difference in the preperation. When I added the cut up jalapenos I had to shake the jars several times after it came out of the water bath as it was cooling. If I didn't do this they all stayed at the rim and didn't disperse through the jelly. The color is great if you don't push it through cheese cloth just let it drip naturally. Thanks for a real winner!!ps  I just won 2nd place at the county fair with this recipe!!

I made this to give for Christmas presents (and to use up jalapeno peppers from my garden), when I took a jar to my sisters house to test it out, the whole jar was eaten and I have people begging to be put on my Christmas List!  It was fabulous!  I left the seeds in all of the jalapenos (except the last four that goes in at the end), and it was hot, but that's what everyone loved about it!  Great recipe!  Thanks!  Already planning on making a few more batches for gifts and for us!

I love this stuff! I pick up jalopeno pepper jelly at all the craft fairs and bazaars, but it gets quite spendy. I didn't realize that I, too, could make such a wonderful jelly. The recipe (after corrected by Allrecipe Staff) is easy, tasty and excellent. Thanks for sharing, Sue!

Very good.  Try this appetizer:  Get a ritz (or other buttery cracker) and spread cream cheese on it.  Add this wonderful jelly and top with a slice of jalapeno - aka Cowboy Candy!  Delicious!

Recipe didn't work as printed.  When you are supposed to get 4 cups of liquid, and all you get is about 3/4 cup, who knows which way to go.  And with Jelly that is wrong.  I couldn't get a set.  Although the taste was good it is soup.

Have now made this 3 times over the last 7 days every time I make it gets better! I found that to get a nice rosy appearance you must use a red bell pepper, out of the 12 jalapeno peppers, I used 2 larger ones without seeding or deveining them. I simmered for 13 minutes and yielded 12 oz after straining. Like other reviewers I added 2 tbsp butter before adding liquid pectin and shook jars to evenly distribute chopped jalapeno prior to hot water bath. Had no problems jelling. WOW! Thanks for this recipe, I now have a new favourite jelly!

So easy to make!  Followed receipe as fellow reviewer Rae suggested (Nov. 18th 2006).  Finely processed peppers, bypassed any straining, did not remove any seeds, used 6 cups of sugar & 2 tbsp. of butter and wow so good to eat!  My only recommendation would be to wear gloves while preparing peppers & enjoy!

I did as others suggested I used 6 cups sugar and did not strain and put all peppers in food processor at once. I made 3 batches and ended up with 10- 1/2 pints and 6 pints. This is the BEST. Also I didnt add any food color and used 2 lg green bell and 1 red bell(for 3 batches) and it turned out beautiful. I will continue to make as long as my peppers produce as well as years to come. Even my father ate this and he doesnt like jalapenos that was a compliment in itself.

Unfortunately, this recipe produces a variable amount of juice due to variations in the size & juicyness of the peppers.
If there is too much juice, it won't set with the amount of pectin asked for in the recipe. It can be reboiled using traditional jam setting methods--how it comes off the spoon or if some is placed on a cold plate it won't come together if you rub your finger through it (p833 Joy of Cooking)--it was a little rubbery, though, when I did this but of excellant appearance and flavor. When I make it again, I will try to boil down the juice to the stated amount before I add the pectin and chopped pepper. Adding in chopped red jalepenos makes it look real christmasy. This is a great recipe but it takes a few times to get it right. Best to make small batches til you are through experimenting. Enjoy

I made this to the "T" last summer when I had a garden overflowing with peppers.  It's great just as is.  Now if your sensitive to heat or you get a batch of really hot peppers (as they can vary), you can cut the jam by half with mayo for sandwich spreads.  Or, you can add grilled corn removed from the cob-awesome!  That way your peppers and efforts will not be wasted.  This year, I made some adjustments.  After straining, I added the juice from 1 lime.  And, when adding the jalapenos at the end, I added finely grated zest of said lime.  It just turned out great!

I made the recipe with the following variations:

I pureed the peppers & seeds into a fine slurry and did not strain anything.

My Certo came in 3-oz pouches, so I used 3 oz. instead of 4 oz. and it set just fine.

Good stuff!  :)

I recently made this recipe and followed it to the letter.  After straining the mixture I did end up with 1 cup of liquid.  I simply want to let you know that this recipe yields four (4) 8-ounce jelly jars, not just "two" as you stated.  Can't understand why you changed the original 4 jar yield to 2 jars.

Delicious and very easy to make. I put all 16 peppers in the blender (in small batches) until finely chopped. As suggested, I used 6 cups of sugar, and I put in 1 TBLS butter before adding the Certo. I didn't strain. It actually set up too much and was a little too sweet for my liking. Next time I will use 5 cups sugar and just 3 oz Certo. Great recipe and wonderful way to use those extra peppers from the garden!

This was my first time to make my own pepper jelly and my first time to can anything.  This recipe is good but I think it could be better. Harry and David's pepper jelly is what I'm use to and this recipe isn't to that level.  I followed the directions exactly other than using a red bell pepper instead of green (for color).   Problems I encountered:  The liquid pectin comes in 3 ounce packets but this recipe calls for 4 ounces (that's just not very thrifty).  If you actually get all the liquid out in step 2 it actually ends up making enough to fill 4 - 8 oz jars; I had to quickly wash an extra jar and I had 3 ready just in case it filled more than the 2 specified. It does not say how long to process the jars (from looking at other canning recipes I assumed 20 minutes; Ball's instructions says the recipe should indicate canning time).  UPDATE:  After sitting for a couple days in the jar the flavor improved significantly.  It is also highly jelly so I think the liquid pectin could be cut back to 3oz so that only one packet could be used.  So I'd give it a 4 for flavor but the odd amount of pectin as written makes stay a 3.

My family, my husband's family, and my sisters and dad LOVE this recipe.  I usually only remove seeds from 1/2  the 16 peppers, and grind them all up so it's a jam consistency.  I take advice from one reviewer by adding 6 cups of sugar and the tbsp of butter to keep the foam down.  WONDERFUL!!  ~ I used this recipe last summer with the spicier Fresno peppers from my sister's garden.  The result was a spicier and absolutely stunning appearance in the presentation.  After giving out samples...I sold 4 jars to neighbors!

This is amazing stuff! Can't wait to slather some on a piece of corn bread. I doubled the recipe, pulverizing the peppers in a food processor, then cooking them in the vinegar as directed. Rather than straining the pulp, I ran it all through a food mill. With this treatment, I ended up with 11 cups of very flavorful jelly. Lots to share!

I loved this jalapeno jelly.  I did not strain jalapeno's or stir in extra jalapeno's at the end.  I seeded all of my jalapenos (they were extra spicy).  After cooking the jalapenos, I ended up with 2 cups instead of one and used all 2 cups.  Also since the jalapeno mixture was thick because I did not strain I used 3 oz of liquid pectin instead of 4oz, (it comes in 3oz packages anyways).  It turned out great.  I especially like it with cream cheese. Warning:  Wear rubber gloves (not thin plastic ones) when chopping jalapenos, the jalapeno's can burn you pretty bad.

This is a great recipe. We used large 
Jalapenos and it has a nice kick.  We doubled it and didnt have any problems. Make sure you boil it for at least one min after adding the sugar and that you use the liquid pectin. I believe these are the keys to getting it to set up. 
We yielded 7 jars from the doubled recipe. We cooked the japalenos and apple cider with a lid on to keeps the liquid from steaming off, hence the higher yield. We did add 2 oz more pectin becasue we had 3 cups of liquid from a doubled redipe

I just made this yummy sounding recipe and followed Rae's suggestion of using 6 cups sugar and not straining. Wished I was more sure of how to do a hot water bath for sealing the jars, but since I used hot jars filled with hot jelly and kept them in the hot water bath for about 5 minutes, I am assuming that as it cools, it will 1) jell and 2) seal the jars. I added 1 drop of green food color to enhance the color and was able to fill 6 half pint jars. Can't wait to try it out once it cools! What a great way to use up jalapenos from the garden! Thank you for this amazing recipe that is surely a keeper.

I thought this was really delicious.  I modified a little.  I added 1/4 of a vidalia onion and used red rather than green pepper in the food processor with the japenenos. I did not strain so it was like a jam.  I used 6 c sugar after boiling and just before adding the pectin, I stirred in 1.5T butter.  I used 2 packs of ball liquid fruit pectin (6 oz total) .  The red peper made for a nice pink color.  It was reasonably hot but very flavorful.

I made this jalapeno jelly recipe as my first canning experience and I have to say it was very easy to make! I used 8 cups of sugar and it is so sweet that I hardly doubt it made any difference in taste. Also I used pectin powder (1 box) since I couldn't find the liquid one in our local grocery store. I also used electric chopper to chop everything. I would suggest this recipe to everyone. It is very delicious!

great!  had a bumper crop of peppers this year.  i took others advice- did not strain, used 6c sugar, 2tb butter to keep the foam down.  turned out AMAZING.    really spicy, but totally addictive.  set wonderfully, so easy i did  it while my toddler and baby ate dinner in their high chairs.  i didnt put it in a boiling water bath, because i know we will go through it pretty quickly, but it made a lot more than i expected- 38oz!  ill probably give away the two 8oz cans, and keep the pint can and the rest of myself.  i CANNOT WAIT to have this on some mild cheese with a cold beer.  perfect!

Holy cow this was so good!  I think it was just the right amount of sweet vs. hot and tastes fantastic with cream cheese and some crackers.  Thanks!

Tastes great!  As we enjoy spicy food I left the seeds in....I did not strain it....In a ramekin I put a piece of cream cheese and spoon the jelly over top...I usually cut tortillas into bite size pieces, place them on a cookie sheet and toast slightly in the oven then serve with the jelly....the tortillas have less calories that some crackers, they do not have any salt or fat making them a healthier choice than some crackers....and the taste of the tortillas does not over-power the jelly...great as an appetizer with friends.......

It took me 2 hrs to make this the first time because I wanted to make sure I read everything correctly.  Now, it takes me 45 mins. and that's including cleanup time.  Love this recipe!  It's absolutely the easiest thing I've ever made. I'm even giving a class on how to make it. I have doubled the recipe and it turned out perfect.  I've probably made it 10 times.  Perfect every time.

Love the flavor of this.  I can't get it to gel right.  I got one batch to do it but don't know what I did different.  It still taste great and can use it on pork as a glaze but hard to give it away if it isn't setting up.  If someone can please help me to get it to gel that would be great!

This is awesome!!  Sweet, tangy, and spicy all in one.  I used a sieve to put the jalapeno and vinegar mixture through (I didn't want to search for my cheesecloth) and it worked just fine.  It's not a difficult recipe; just a little time consuming and a juggling act with the canning.  I will make this again next summer!!!

This recipe DOES make 4 8 oz. containers (ignore 11/13/2003 staff comment to contrary). Used Certo liquid pectin and found that 4 oz. is too much. Batch made with a 3 oz. packet of Certo was far superior.

I was surprised at the degree to which the sugar kills the heat of the peppers.  When I saw that some folks add a habanero or two I thought that was crazy, but it's not.  To make this warm (not hot) I have progressed over 3 batches from 1. All jalapeños with 2/3 seeded to 2. Two seeded serranos and the balance jalapeños with 1/3 of them seeded and finally 3. Three serranos plus jalapeños, and all seeds included.  Cut stems from the peppers, toss whole in cuisinart with berries.  Easy, but needs a tad more heat yet.  Just remember before you modify recipe that some jalapenos are hotter than others.  Try this drizzled on cheesecake - WOW!!

Ok, I've never jarred or canned anything. I was a bit nervouse going into this after hearing all the horror stories about how difficult jarring can be. So, I followed the recipe to the letter. At stage 2, I had slightly more than 1 cup of liquid. Only mistake was that I let the mixture boil over... lots of cleaning afterwards :)

Anyway, as I was pouring the jelly into the three cup jars I had ready, it was obvious there was going to be a substantial amount left over. Luckily, I had another jar sterilized, so all I needed to do was to grab and use that.

Now, my suggestion is to let the jelly sit for a while (a minute or so), then stir the peppers from the top of the jar into the body of the jelly. The jelly thickens fast, so it doesn't take too long.

The jelly came out beautifully. And, as an added bonus, I got over four cups!!! This recipe was excellent. I will certainly make this for Christmas presents. It's taste is wonderful! It tates like jalapinos, but is not hot. We had it with bagels, whipped cream cheese and lox. 

I can't stress enough; when you pour the jelly into the jars, let them sit for a minute or so, then mix the peppers that are floating on the top into the body of the mixture... it's beautiful.

For a divorced dad, this was a precursor to making grape jelly with my daughters this weekend! Looking forward to more success!!!

WEAR GLOVES...'nuff said about that.

I doubled the recipe and added 24t powdered pectin at the beginning. I put most of my peppers in the blender with 1C regular distilled vinegar and pureed them. I finely chopped the rest. I put all of it in the pot and cooked it until I had a rolling boil and canned them. I yielded 9- 8oz jars. Wish I had thought ahead to use 4oz jars instead. They turned out perfect!

May try red and yellow bell peppers next time just to jazz it up.

Very yummy!  I didn't have any liquid pectin so I tried to substitute the powder (using a conversion I found online) and it was ok but next time I will surely use the liquid pectin.

Thank you for the recipe. I try every jalapeno jelly recipe and we enjoy it with my family. and if you cant make it at home or the recipe doesnt work out for you, dont worry people there are so many good jalapeno jellies out there. I personally dont like the ones that dont have real jalapenos inside and have food colorings and preservatives. The best all natural jalapeno jelly I tasted is Mediterranean Deluxe Jalapeno Jelly. They have the whole jalapenos with the seeds and all, so it has a little extra punch.

My sister and I made 4 batches of this recipe. We started out using the 12 jalapenos with seeds and membranes, and with each batch, reduced that amount. But, after all was said and done, the first batch was the best, and everybody raves about it. We made the jam, not the jelly, so we got 6 half pint jars with every batch. I wouldn't do one thing different! This jam/jelly is wonderful!

This is a good basic recipe for jalapeno jelly. I use my own jalapenos from the garden and just a little less pectin and it turned out great.

I just made this recipe and it turned out quite well.  I followed the recipe exactly, cooked the peppers/vinegar without the lid and ended up with a little less than 1 cup liquid.  I added a little water to make 1 cup.  The liquid pectin I purchased came in 3 oz packages, so I opened another package and measured exactly 4 oz.   I live at 5,000 ft, so I needed to adjust the water process time.  I also added 1/4 tsp green food color.   I hope this helps those whose jelly didn't set quite right.   I removed the seeds of the jalepenos before cooking, but next time I think I will leave them in so the jelly is a little hotter.  However, it was delicious as is.

We had a glut of peppers from the garden this year, and I was at a loss of what to do with them. This recipe is amazing. I add crushed red pepper, as I prefer very hot things. This is a favorite of my husband's and mine. Had planned to give away as gifts at Christmas, but couldn't bring myself to part with it. :-)

After printing this recipe last year I finally made it! Wonderful. I added a couple of drops of green food coloring but don't know that you need this. I had double the jalapenos so I doubled the inital part of the recipe, ending upwith enough juice to make triple the amount of jelly. Hadn't made jelly in several years so was unfamiliar with the new packaging for certo but one  envelope jelled each batch beautifully! Drfinitely a do again recipe.

This was my first time canning ever, but with an overload of Jalapenos I had too.  Great recipe - easy.  The taste is great.  Sweet at first with a good bite at the end.  Like others noted - I kept some seeds in, but not all. I think I will mix this with whipped cream cheese for a dip.

This is awsome.  I followed the recipe almost exactly,(I used Habaneros instead of Jalapenos).  It came out great. It's been a week and I have to make more, everyone who tried it wanted a jar of their own.

Although this recipe burned my eyes and under my fingernails were on fire for a week, the end result was fantastic! I too ended up with more liquid, sort of on purpose and it turned out fine. Although my husband wanted it even hotter. Great recipe!

Great Recipe.  I use a zester to remove the skin of the peppers before chopping.

I followed the tips provided by the first reviewer (raearendt). I did not strain or remove seeds. It made a wonderful, slightly spicy pepper jam. My husband,who isn't a huge fan of jalapenos or anything spicy, loved it too. Note: when you don't strain you end up with much more than 2 eight oz jars from this recipe.

Great recipe.  I used one green pepper, 6 jalapenos with seeds and 6 without.  I also used 3 anaham (sp) seeded peppers.  I put all in a ninja blender with 1.5 cups of reg vinager.  Great blender!!!  it completly pureed beautifuly without scraping the sides.  During cooking I added 2 Tbls butter to help with the foaming...this trick works great.  followed recipe as written except I used only one 3 oz packet of liquid fruit pectin and 4 seeded and fine chopped/minced jalapenos.

I ended up with two cups of liquid, but just made sure to take the temp up to 220 degrees before adding the pectin. I did shake the jars while cooling to distribute the chopped peppers. It is delicious!!! Perfectly spicy and not too sweet. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This is a great recipe!. Just beware and wear gloves when you are working with the jalapenos as the oil will burn your hands.

I never had made Jalapeno jelly in my life.  This was so easy and is really quite tasty!  It made 4 jars which I put in the hot water bath for 10 minutes and the jars sealed quickly.  This will be great over cream cheese on bagels!

my my... what a taste!  It's rather addicting...  I've never had anything like it, and that's what everybody who tries it says too!  I still have a bunch in the fridge.  I didn't get enough pectin in mine though.  Used a jar of jalapenos (the point of the recipe was to use them up...) and included all the parts of the pepper.

We had our first vegetable garden this year and grew a few too many Jalapenos!  This recipe is ideal for using up quite a lot of them and it tastes great!  It's quite sweet with a really good tangy kick.  Very easy to make.  I didn't bother with the food colouring or adding the chopped peppers at the end. Everyone who's tried it loves it!

this ain't bad stuff.  Like others I can't get it to set properly, and get more liquid than stated.  Question- why does the uncook jelly solidify but the cooked jely come out like honey?  Also, I use the pulp in ~1/2 of the jars to make it a "jam" - why through this good stuff away, y'all?

Amazing! I've never made jalapeno jelly before but wanted to for my family Christmas gift baskets this year. It made 4 1/2 eight ounce jars. I took the half jar to work and served over cream cheese with crackers. Everybody raved about it! It was so yummy and very easy to make!

I addded 1cup of fresh raspberries to this & also used the box of pectin instead of the liquid.  This is a very good recipe. The only thing is it could have been a touch thicker or more set.  I even cooked a second time & added another full box of pectin which did help.  I could have done something wrong, but that would be the only thing I wasn't happy with ~ flavor is great.

I know this was several years ago but I wanted a recipe for pepper jelly and found this with all the helpful comments.  The thing I found most helpful was the butter to prevent the foam on top.  I remember my mother and grandmother both getting a spoon and saucer and dipping the foam off.  I just wish that I could share this with them now.  

Now I want to give you a tip.  For those of you that want to remove the seeds use a grapefruit spoon.  The serrated edges work great to clean them out.  Even if you have to cut the pepper open you can use it to scrape the veins and seeds out.  

Thanks to all of you that wrote the comments and hints.  All of us recipe hunters really appreciate finding out from someone "in the field" that has really had the experience of making and fine tuning the recipe.

There is a huge flaw in the directions- the pectin is added before the one minute boil, not after. I found out the hard way by following the directions exactly, even though I should have known better. Also, it is unnecessary to divide the peppers, or to strain and take out the pulp and seeds. The processing really knocks down the heat, so don't worry about setting anyone's mouth on fire with it.

Used 6 cups sugar, and did not strain.
Excellent, seeds & all!  Pretty, too.
Made 12 little 4oz. gift jars, and a spoonful for me to have with bread & butter!

I've made this twice following the instructions and also without the added chopped jalapeno and it turns out great. It does make at least 4-8 oz. jars, not 2 as the recipe states. I normally get a bit over 1 cup of liquid and use the 4 ounces of liquid pectin as called for and it sets just fine.
I gave it away for Xmas last year in 4 oz jars along with jars of cranberry jelly. They looked cute together.

I used Sure-Jel pectin and the package says it may take hot pepper jelly up to a week to gel. After 12 hrs it is very thick but not set. We will see. The flavor is great.  I used the entire pepper except for the cap and it has the right amount of heat for us. The color is a bit drab so I may use the coloring next time. After cooking the peppers I had 2 cups of liquid.  Not sure whether I should have used more pectin or reduced the liquid but I'll know in a week how to adjust.

Super yummy and jelled very nicely. I left a few seeds in for some extra spice and it was perfect. I actually only came out with about 3/4 cup of liquid after simmering/straining, but I added enough cider vinegar to the liquid to make a cup and that worked just fine.

I have been looking for a good 'pepper jelly' recipe forever... so many of them were green bell peppers, this one is much spicier, and to my taste.  I raise chili peppers, but didn't have any jalapenos, so I used sereno chili once, and this time, I used the tiny Thai chilies..... MMmmmm good, I strained it the 1st time, and this time I put the pulp back in.  Great! both ways.. oh I used pepin (instead of Certo) for a Vegan friend this last time..

Delicious. Even my 7yo son liked it. (He requested I say that) I ended up with about double the Jalapeno juice needed so I saved half for next time. Also, the liquid pectin was sold in 3oz packets, so I just used one packet instead of the 4oz called for. Also, I had no idea what a hot water bath was, but I did a little research and put a metal bowl inside a pot, filled it up with water to cover the lids of the jars, and boiled it for 5mins. The suction worked, so hopefully that's all it needed.

This jelly is delicious! The first time I used this recipe the jelly turned out perfectly. The second time I made the recipe the jalapeno peppers (& a few chops of red bell pepper) that I added in the last step all rose to the top of the jelly jar. It's so much prettier to see the chopped peppers dispersed throughout the jelly.

Excellent. I opted not to add the pieces of jalapeno and used a couple drops of green food color. I served it on Ritz crackers with cream cheese and a dallop of the jelly. Everyone wants the recipe. Thanks. This will be made time and again!

We love Jalapeno Jelly and this was our first experience making it.  The recipe yielded much more liquid and we were concerned as to why we had so much extra.  It turned out well and jelled perfectly.

This was my first experience making jelly and what a great way to start!!  Easy to find ingredients and delicious....if you like it hot, leave some seeds and membranes from the jalapenos but either way...yummy!!!

This was my first attempt at canning.  Yea for me this is wonderful.  I altered the original recipie to work with the liquid pectin that I was able to purchase.  Can I say "YEA"  this is so great.  If you like this kind of thing this is the one to try.

My first time ever doing jelly.  I had some heirloom Black Hungarian peppers that just went nuts this year and I didn't know what to do with all of them, so I gave this recipe a try. Like other reviewers, I didn't strain the jelly; I prefer a jam-like texture. Anyway, after reading through the reviews, I used about 5 cups of sugar and that gave me a really pleasant sweetness. Like another reviewer suggested, I put some butter in before the pectin and it worked! No foam! I also let the mixture boil for a good 5 minutes after adding the pectin. The taste test I did was sweet (but not overly so), with a nice warming heat after you swallow (my hubby can't do spicy foods, so this was perfect; I seeded all my peppers except three). I can't wait to taste it again after it has time to sit! I will be making this again, as my little pepper plants aren't done with me yet!

Everyone loves this recipe. Made on 3 different occasions and put it over cream cheese- this is what I discovered: Jalapenos from your own garden are best! If you let the jalapenos sit out on the counter for a few days to dry out you should have no problem with the jelly setting. You can use old wrinkled jalapenos and you can't even tell the difference! Bell pepper is completely optional- couldn't tell a big difference.

Love this jelly. My only problem is that first of all I don’t know how many jars it makes and secondly because I made a triple batch, some of the last jars got hard and turned into rock candy. ??

This came out great in taste, consistency and color.  I used red and green jalapenos which turned the jam into an amber color.   I used 6 cups sugar and didn't strain.  I would absolutely use this recipe again.

Easy to follow. 
This was the first time I've ever made jelly/jam, OMG how easy it was and only took about a hour. 
I did add to the recipe though, I added 1 tlb spoon of lemon extract,  medium red and yellow bell peppers and Serrano peppers(i like it with a kick!).

This recipe is most excellent.  It is a good base and you can tinker with it a few ways to adjust the heat, sweetness, and taste to your (and everyone else's) liking.  I have a huge bag of frozen jalapenos and habaneros which have lost a bit of their heat.  I use 8 thawed jally's, 1 thawed Habby, and 4 fresh Jally's (and the bell pepper) for the first step.  

When I strain the cider/chopped pepper mix, I let an arbitrary portion of the crushed/boiled/chopped peppers into the liquid.  Puts a little more substance and flavor into the jelly.

For the 4 chopped jalapenos it calls for at the end, I use 4 fresh ones from the garden, 2 regular, 2 "mild".  I also use a thawed habanero I have.  I do not de-seed.  If seeds come out so-be it, but whatever is there I keep in.

The jelly is phenomenal.  Everyone loves it and I have been asked for some jars.  I have tried it on hamburgers and it is terrific.  Plain hamburgers and also experimented on one with egg and bacon also.... OMG!   Went really well on Pretzel Crisps too.  


In all, being as efficient as possible, it takes just over an hour to complete.  It is well worth it and this jelly is going to be a frequent destination for my garden peppers.

I make this a lot. If I want it hotter, I add more seeds. Milder, I use flavored jello. Splenda also works to make it lower calorie.

Used this recipe to make jelly for my very first time ever. I didn't remove the seeds from the peppers I boiled or those added at the end. It was so easy and it turned out great! Tastes wonderful and looks fantastic. Can't wait to try it with other types of hot peppers.

the flavor is great. I think I had a bit more product, so the jam didn't set up. I am going to put it back in the pan and add another box of pectin.  Also, my finger is burning and I even wore gloves. Next time I will wear thicker ones. (the little nit-rile type are apparently too thin).

I tried a Texas Blue Ribbon recipe the first time I made jalapeno jelly. That was not what I was looking for.  Waste of time.  Decided to try your recipe, and so glad I did.  It's easy, jelled perfectly, and tastes fabulous.  Thank you.

I didn't try this before the corrections so 1 cup of liquid was exactly what I got when draining the pulp. Perfect. Followed the recipe exactly except for two things. Added a few drops of colouring to make more of an emerald colour, and used a few finely minced red chili peppers in place of 2 of the final minced jalapenos for added colour. It's as delicious as it is beautiful

This turned out pretty good. It seemed to be sweeter more than spicy. Next time I will add a few hotter types of peppers to give it more of a kick. Also had to add a bit more pectin to thicken. I did not strain it either per other reviews. Thanks for a good recipe. Wonderful on cream cheese with crackers.

This is an easy-to-make recipe that creates an excellent tasting jalapeño jelly!  I found that I had slightly more than a cup of pepper juice after simmering.  When the sugar, pectin and chopped jalapeños were added and I reached the end of the cooking, I had 4½ cups of jelly, not 2 cups as suggested by the amended recipe yield.  I heartily recommend this recipe!!

This jelly is excellent. It starts off sweet, then the bite kicks in. I made this & served it with cream cheese several times. It's been a hit each time!

I made this jelly four years ago and totally forgot about it.  I opened a jar recently (having come across it when my husband asked me to get a jar of pickled jalapenos from our pantry for a salad).  I am so head over heels fond of this recipe.   It is wonderful on anything.  It can be said that I have a little bit of English muffin with this Jalapeno Pepper Jelly.  A "must try" for the Jalapeno Pepper Jelly lover in you!

I just finished jarring mine. It made 6 little jars. I added green food coloring to add a little eye appeal to the olive green it was.

My jalapenos turned bright red so I made this with a red bell pepper - the colour is beautiful. I did not add the extra chopped peppers at the end. No too hot, pleasant flavour.

I ended up with 3 cups of liquid as I started with 16 jalapenos and 2 cups of vinegar.  I did squeeze the juice out as that is just what we Norwegians do -- waste not want not.  I used two 3 oz packages of Certo liquid pectin.  I did boil for 3 minutes after putting in the pectin and I used 2 tbs (approx) to tame the foam.  I ended up with at least 8 half pints of jelly. ran out of  canning jars so I had to put in other small jars I had and just put them in the fridge w/o processing them.  They will keep for months.  Just tasted the last bit I had to put in a small bowl.  It is yummy with cream cheese and crackers.  I think the gal who said hers was soup didn't boil after adding the pectin.  I will be making this again!

Best recipe I've made. Incorporated all the peppers into the jam rather than straining them and discarding. Used 6 cups of sugar ,3 oz (1 pouch) of liquid pectin and 15 hot peppers from out summer harvest.

We loved the flavor if if our slight alterations made it a bit more spicy! However it did not set up correctly. I'm not sure what I did wrong. After refrigeration it gelled a little more but  not like it should have.

So delicious I couldn't stop tasting it. This was my first time making jam or jelly so thanks for the positive experience. I was short on regular sugar and so about two cups of the sugar was brown sugar which resulted in a lovely amber appearance and caramel-y flavor. Recommended! I also left in all the peppers and left the seeds in about five peppers total.

I’ve been making this for several years now, ever since I found the recipe. I follow Raearendt instructions, but usually I remove the seeds from half the jalapeños. One time I guess my peppers were so hot I couldn’t eat it, when I left all the seeds in, so now I’m a chicken and remove seeds from half. I gave a jar to someone at work and now he makes sure to give me a big bag of jalapeños every year!

Loved this jam! I didn't put it through the cheesecloth and removed the seeds of about 3/4 of the jalapeño peppers. Just delicious with the right amount of heat.

Wow!  Spicy hot, even for a native Southern Arizonan like me, but very delicious!  I did make some changes:I did not strain the peppers as directed - left them in as suggested by other reviewers;  Used 2 green bells instead of 1; eliminated 4 fresh jalapeños at the end (can’t imagine hot much hotter that would have been!); used dry pectin (because that is what I had and found a relatively good conversion: 2T dry=1 pouch liquid and I added 1T extra for good measure); added a little green paste color since the mixture was not the pretty green I wanted.  All in all, I will use this recipe again with my adjustments.  It was plenty spicy...my hubby and I tried some on some crackers with cream cheese as a snack - passed the hubby test!

Great recipe!  Don’t do it alone the first time! I had to have help when I was boiling the recipe. My sauce pot wasn’t large enough and I panicked! Lol I haven’t tasted the jelly yet, but I’m sure it’s delish!

This is my forever-go-to-fav-for-pepper jelly. I tried it several times tweaking the ingredients. I got bad and great results. Learned to keep key components (jalapeño, apple cider and liquid pectin)the same, but found I could change bell pepper color if needed for seasonal color change..

Intensely sweet and spicy. I made juice first, from 15 jalapeños and a green pepper. Let it sit and settle overnight, and poured off the clear juice, discarding the sediment. 
Then proceeded with technique described in the Pomona Pectin package. Added two chopped jalapeños to the liquid, with some extra cider vinegar and 2 tsp of pomona’s Calcium water, and simmered 5 minutes. Brought back to a boil, adding ½ cup granulated sugar mixed with 1-½ tsp pomona Pectin, until it all dissolved, then the rest of the sugar (1-5/6 cups) until all done. Removed from heat, filled 2 1-cup jars, and put a slice of fresh jalapeño in, then wiped the rims, sealed the jars and processed 10 minutes. Then I licked the spoon.

This is a great recipe. While simmering the peppers, I tossed in a handful of frozen berries for color and a hint of fruit. I ended up with more liquid than anticipated, leftover pectin and only had large jars, that when I got the brainstorm to rebatch some 3yo crabapple jelly that never jelled. I do think that 4oz has of pectin was a bit much, will probably use only 3 me time.

I have made this twice now. Both times it came out great. I used about a half cup less sugar and kept the seeds of all peppers the second time. It came out a little spicier but just as good.  I doubled the recipe both times, next time I will probably make a triple batch.  I got about five 8oz.  jars.

Easy to make, spice depends on the quality of pepper. I have made this a few times, always happy with the results.

All of the liquid pectin that I could find came in two 3-ounce packets. I had many peppers so I tripled the recipe. I saved a lot of time by just washing the peppers and removing the stems. The seeds aren't going to change anything and they end up being discarded with the pulp (which I add to my compost). I also added some of the vinegar when using the food processor for chopping. The liquid makes the chopping in the processor go faster.  I add either red or green food coloring. I also add some finely chopped colorful peppers at the end with the pectin. I highly recommend this jelly served with butterkase cheese on slices of french baguette bread.

I made it exactly as recipe stated,  very good flavor,  but it was runny.  Does set up if kept refrigerated.  Made a similar recipe,  more sugar, boiled longer after adding pectin,  set up perfectly.

Add water to waste pulp, 1 pkg pectin, 1/4 cup lemon juice.  Bring to rolling boil, add 6 cups sugar, back to rolling boil for 1 minute.  Jar and seal.

I made some revisions, and this turned out great! 

I had foraged a bunch of random hot peppers out of my friend's garden, so I just used what I had and made half a batch (1 32-oz Ball Jar).  I hand chopped the peppers and it came out to about 2 cups. I also left the seeds in to make it spicy. I boiled them down with 1.5 cups Bragg's ACV for 15 mins.  I added in 3 cups of sugar and let it come to a boil (about a minute). Then I pulled it off the heat and threw it into a blender to make it smooth like soup. Next I added an entire package of sugar-free Sure Gel and let it boil for about 1.5 mins. It set up great. No food coloring (that's just weird, frankly); mine is a beautiful green. 

My local grocers never carry jalapeno jelly so this may be in my regular rotation. Also, now my mouth is on fire! Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum, yum and yum. I followed the recipe exactly other than the fact that I used a fine mesh strainer rather than cheesecloth (didn't have any on hand) which seemed to work just as well.  I chopped up whole jalapeños in the food processor which added to the heat and now have a beautiful jelly with significant bite.

However, I didn't make it like the recipe reads. I didn't have any cheesecloth so I pureed all the peppers, used red instead of green bell because that's what I had, and my Certo packet was 3 oz instead of 4. I cored/seeded about half of my jalapeños, which were very large and hot. Used 6 cups sugar, and 2 Tbsp of butter right before adding the pectin. My batch yielded 7 1/2 jelly jars. It's super spicy, but I love it.(5 stars for how I did it, 4 for this because I changed the recipe)

I was disappointed at the yield, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I substituted Splenda for sugar and had to figure out the conversion of powdered pectin to liquid (1 oz liquid = 1 tsp powdered).  I kept the seeds in to make it a little hotter. Can't wait to have this over some cream cheese with crackers.

Worked out great, tastes fantastic! Not very spicy, pretty sweet. Next time I'll leave the seeds in. I didn't strain the pepper pieces out because I wanted them for the texture and appearance. Pairs well with cream cheese on a club cracker or bagel.

I made this without straining and added the 6 cups of sugar as raearendt suggested.  Mine came out good, but the vinegar seems a little strong.  I don't know what would happen if I cut it back a bit.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The taste is fabulous!! My jalapenos from the garden had turned red (too long on the vine) so the result is a beautiful vibrant red color. I added the chopped jalapenos in green so it has a great holiday look!  I agree with the other comments that it didn't produce enough liquid. I panicked and then thought to reboil more APC with the peppers which seemed to work.  I can't imagine that the peppers would lose all their heat in the first boil.  I'm a little unsure about the pectin as I only had powdered but I found some info on the web about conversions.  If it doesn't set properly, I'll just use it as a meat glaze/marinade.  The flavor right now is stupendous! And for the commenter who was looking for the Pepper Relish recipe (similar to H&D) there is a great one on the web from Copycat Cook. :) Thanks for the great recipe, I'm new at canning but I think I'll be a converter soon! :) ENJOY!!!

I gave made this many times and have altered it several ways. My favorite way is to puree the peppers after cooking instead of straining them. I put my immersion blender into the pot and it gets a smooth consistancy.

Great recipe! Just read the directions, and it works great. I got more juice than the recipe said I should get, but I just measured the juice, and added the proper ratio of sugar and pectin. And as others said, just add a little more or less peppers to the juice to make it hotter or to give it more substance. I also just did this with red peppers and it worked great.

This is an excellent condiment or addition to chicken and fish recipes. When heated it becomes a wonderful glaze. I sometimes mix it with prepared mustard for a sweet n sour spicy glaze or dipping sauce.

This recipe is great. I actually made two different jalapeno jelly recipes and this one is by far the better one. Has just the right amount of sweetness and tang. Awesome on a toasted English muffin!

I doubled the vinegar, sugar and pectin to tame down the HOT!  Also added 4 Sweet Hungarian Peppers to mixture.  Instead of chopping up 4 Jalapenos at the end, I added 2 tablespoons of the pulp.  Turned out fantastic with no waste! It made 8- 8 ounces jars of jelly.

I went to the local farmers market to get jalapenos and ended up getting hungarian wax peppers instead. I only needed 3 large ones to make up for the jalapenos!  I also added a small red pepper.  I didn't strain it (lazy) but it set nicely as it was.  It was a hit around our house last fall.  I'll definitely be making a double batch this year!

This recipe is excellent.  It has a great taste with a kick.  I especially like the ratio of jalapeno's to green peppers.  This gives it the great jalapeno taste.
