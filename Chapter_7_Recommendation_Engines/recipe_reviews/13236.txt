I am a big fan of soups, and I am also a very picky eater.  I wouldn't say this recpie was fantastic, but it was very good.  I would definitely make this one again.

I tried this recipe because I needed a vegetarian soup for a very large group.  This soup is easy to make, tastes great and freezes well.  A great find, I have used it with a couple of large groups!

I tweaked this recipe a bit to suit my family's tastes- the recipe itself is a wonderful base.  I added diced redskin potatoes with the vegetables.  I only drained about half the water from the veggies- just depends on how you like the consistency of your soup.  I also added diced chicken, which I browned with lots of minced garlic prior to adding.  Due to my added ingredients, I added an additional cup of milk and a cup of half and half.  We are big cheese lovers, so I used a whole brick of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I seasoned the soup with pepper, garlic salt, and bay leaf.  It was absolutely delicious!  One of our new family favorites.

Very good and easy to prepare.  I will definitely make again. The only thing that I did different was add a little garlic powder to add more flavor.

My kids really liked this soup. I added frozen peas and carrots, frozen mixed colored peppers,and fresh zucchini in addiotion to the celery, onion, and creamed corn. I used about 4c of chicken broth and used fat free half and half instead of milk. I also omnitted the butter and made a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the soup. Will add more cheese next time as per my oldest's request. Thanks!

I have to admit, as I was making this, I thought of many methods I thought I should be using to impart more flavor (cooking the veggies in broth or simply sauteing them in butter/garlic, adding assorted herbs, etc).  However, I stuck to recipe (worried it was going to be bland and tasteless) and I'm so glad I did.  This is REALLY good AND really quick to throw together (my school's on a two hour delay this morning, so I made it as our French toast cooked...it's that easy).  I also like that it uses staple ingredients (if I add canned creamed corn to the grocery list), so it can be a great lastminutedidntplandinnernowwhatdoimake meal.  It's not the healthiest soup in the world, but at least we're getting some veggies.  THANKS for a new soup recipe that will get used again at the LTH house!  Random notes:  I left out the celery (because it's gross) and used a red onion because it's the only onion I had and the recipe didn't specify type (I'll use yellow in the future, though the red added nice color).  I also added some extra leftover frozen corn because my mixed veggie bag was 12 oz.  There are no cook temps listed, so I went w/medium high for the roux.

Hubby and the little guy LOVED this, and I thought it was very good, but I feel like something's missing. I added in garlic w/ the other veggies, but I still feel it needed something else...This was a snap to make and it is tasty. The fact that the little guy ate his entire bowl before hubby and I even sat down, says a lot! I used 2% Velveeta in place of the cheddar. I will def be making this again, and try to figure out what's missing, lol! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe was good and I liked how it was so basic. However, it didn't have much flavour for my personal liking. I stirred in a little chili powder and beef oxo and it tasted great!

I've been in the mood for cheesy vegetable soup but couldn't find any good, easy recipes. Well, this I've definitely hit the spot. I even got my son (who isn't a big fan of his veggies) to eat a whole bowl of it. I'll be making this again shortly :)

This was okay but bland.  I will make again but add some more spices and maybe a can of green chiles or even rotel  just to perk it up.  Good base though and did get my son to eat some veggies.

This soup was delicious and very easy. I didn't change a thing.
