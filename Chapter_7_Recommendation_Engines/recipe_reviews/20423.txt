This is a delicious drink - very tasty and thirst-quenching, but the recipe needed some adjustment. When scaled to one serving only 2T rum was called for in a pint of soda. I just used the measurements listed as a guideline. What I did: a large water glass, 4 ice cubes, a shot of  rum, 2T grenadine, 1/4 lime, juiced; and then filled the glass with lime soda. You could not taste the rum at all and it was very delicious.

This is a wonderful and simple drink. You can't imagine how great this drink is. It is a wonderful summer drink and I HIGHLY recommend buying the ingredients and trying it. It deserves 10 stars!!!

Yum!  Made this over the weekend of the Fourth and used Sierra Mist soda, which would be the only thing I change for the next time - that soda tends to taste flat sooner than most.  I actually took the cherries and marinated them in vodka prior to garnishing the drinks with them.  Everyone got a nice POP once they were to the end of the drink.  I also halved the amount of grenadine per the advice of others.

Yep - this was tasty.  I love cherry limeades...especially from Sonic, but there's no Sonic within a reasonable distance around here so I always make my own.  I juiced 2 limes since I like a sour taste and went easy on the rum...I didn't want to see double! I added some of the cherry juice which really sent this over the top.  Will keep this drink in mind for summer.  Thanks a bunch :)

This is a nice summery drink, but as written it is waaaay too sweet (and I like sweet drinks!). I recommend halving the amount of grenadine.

This is so good! You really can't taste the rum at all. The flavor is really yummy and fruity.

This tastes EXACTLY like a cherry limeade ( & I'm an expert on the subject!) I did cut wayyy back on the grenadine...I don't think it needs more than an ounce & a half.

This was just okay.  I cut back on the grenadine a little, but it was still sickeningly sweet.  It was drinkable, but I don't think I'll make it again.  It reminded me of fizzy cough syrup.

I personally thought this looked and tasted like cough syrup. However, the people I served it to both told me they liked it. I would use less grenadine and more soda if I make again.

Loved this as written! We didn't think it was too syrupy. But you may want to halve the grenadine and work your way up just to be certain. :) Oh, and be careful with these! We couldn't taste the rum...at all!!! It hit me after about the 4th one. lol.

This drink was awesome. I'm not a big drinker so I like to not notice the alcohol in my drinks and this tasted like cherry 7up. It was great. I took it to a BBQ and everyone loved it. Thanks for the great drink. Will use for all get togethers...

Very light, crisp, and refreshing! Great for sipping on the patio on a warm summer evening. I really liked these. My hubby said they tasted just like cherry seven up and he wasn't too impressed because he thinks they need more rum and he added more rum to his glass anyway. He gave these 3 stars, before he doctored them with more rum but I thought they were a perfect 5. I couldn't find lime soda, used Sprite instead. I used Cruzan Estate light rum. This was not too strong for me at all, and I am really picky. If I can smell alcohol, I complain it's too strong, so when I like a drink, I  know it is a good one!This is a grown up Shirley Temple. Very very good! I will keep this in my file, it is definitely worthy.

we had a big bottle of rum... and i was never too fond of rum until i found this recipe.  i used diet 7up because i couldn't find just lime soda.  also when i don't have fresh limes i just use a little lime juice...  i also make mine with just a splash of grenadine in each glass, 4 oz was way too sweet for me.  i definitely have all the ingredients on hand for when company comes over, so easy to make and so tasty!

I didn't have grenadine on hand or maraschino cherries so I used homemade amaretto cherries and the juice from the cherries. Super good!

This was better with twice the amount of rum, which cut the sweetness to an acceptable level. We poured these over shaved ice which added to the refreshing quality.

This was a great recipe if you make it exactly the way it is written. You have to mix all of the lemon lime soda in with the mix or it will be too sweet.

Made a big batch of this for a party. Tastes just like cherry limeade.
