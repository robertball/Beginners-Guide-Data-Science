Finally getting around to reviewing this recipe. It's delicious! I haven't cooked with barley in ages and was looking for a new recipe to use it. I made the recipe exactly as written. I used dried oyster mushrooms and loved the flavor! I almost used fresh mushroom since they're cheaper than dried, but do not, I repeat, DO NOT skimp out on this! The dried mushrooms add such a lovely flavor that is more concentrated than fresh, and a nice texture.  It was almost a pity tossing out the soaking liquid from the mushrooms. I'm thinking I may use that liquid as part of the water requirements next time. The only thing I might suggest is adding the potatoes halfway through cooking. I found they were falling apart by the time the soup was done.  Thank you Kathie for sharing your dad's soup!

I did like the premise of the soup but had to make a lot of alterations.  There were hardly any seasoning in the original recipe so I updated it with salt, marjoram, thyme & Italian Seasoning.  Hopefully, that will solve the lack of seasoning.

I'm a vegetarian. I replaced the chicken broth with vegi broth and it didn't work. No flavor.
