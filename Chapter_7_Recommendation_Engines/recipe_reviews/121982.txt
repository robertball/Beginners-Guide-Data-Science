This is fantastic!  I modify the layers a bit which makes it even easier to prepare.  I put 1 layer of sandwiches, 1 jar of caramel sauce, another layer of sandwiches, 1 jar of hot fudge sauce then all the whipped topping on top.  I usually finish with 3 crushed toffee candy bars.  We call it ice cream lasagna.  You won't be disappointed!

Loved this, although I did tweek it a bit. I used this recipe and another I found in a Kraft Foods cookbook. I mixed one package of dry chocolate instant pudding mix with half the tub of cool whip, half a cup of hot fudge, added a little milk and 12 crushed oreo cookies. Layed out the first layer of sandwiches, spread the chocolate/cookie mixture on top, next layer of sandwiches, and then spread the rest of the plain cool whip on top followed by red, white, and blue sprinkles for the holiday. Family and guests loved this dessert. Definately a keeper and I will try it with the peanuts next time. Great recipe!

Absolutely delicious!!  I made a scaled down version the first time around.  Followed the recipe exactly, just made it smaller in a loaf pan.

The second time I made it was for my brother's birthday.  I did the bottom layer with sandwiches, then a jar of hot fudge sauce, then a tiny jar of peanut butter (melt for about 30 seconds first to make it easier to spread).  Then 1/2 of the whipped cream mixture.  Then another layer of sandwiches, a jar of caramel sauce then the rest of the whipped cream.  I chopped up 2 peanut butter cups to put on top.  So rich and so good!

This was really good and so easy.  I used french vanilla cool whip instead of regular.  It was hard to spread the hot fudge around on the cool whip, so next time I will spread the cool whip on and then put it in the freezer until the cool whip firms up so I can spread the fudge on easier.  I might also try toffee bits in place of the peanuts next time I make this.  I cut some of the sandwiches into thin strips to fill in some of the gaps and it worked great.  Thanks a lot!

This is a great recipe.  I saw it and I had to share my modifications!  Instead of hot fudge sauce and peanuts I use caramel sauce and chopped Hershey Symphony bars in between the layers along with the cool whip.  This dessert is so good!

So easy to make but everyone will think you spent alot of time on this!  I buy the Neopolitan ice cream sandwiches and face them all one way on the bottom layer and the opposite way on the top layer so you get a bite of every flavor.  I also add maraschino cherries to the top.

This was a huge hit and perfect ending to our Memorial Day meal this year. The weather is unusally warm and this dessert really hit the spot with everyone. We purchased a large box (24 count) of Ice Cream Sandwiches and they were a little smaller than usual. I ended up cutting/pasting and using the entire box in a 13x9. I also felt that 12 oz of Cool Whip wasn't enough (would have been a very thin layer in the middle) so I used 2 - 8oz containers - 1 in the middle and 1 on top. That worked out great. We had company and I wasn't sure about including the nuts in the dessert so just left them out and served on the side for those who wanted them sprinkled on top. I also microwaved the fudge topping for just a few seconds to thin it out a little so I could cover the middle layer better and held a small amount back to drizzle over the top with caramel sauce right before serving. I can't believe how easy this was and how much everyone enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!!

I made this for hubby's birthday and it was a huge hit! I used chocolate Cool Whip and like KGravel, I also used toffee bits in lieu of the nuts which IMHO really made the dessert. Thank you Jody; this had to be the fastest dessert I've ever put together!

OMG! My friend made this for her son's birthday today and everyone at the party LOVED this amazing dessert! SOOO yummy and SOOOO decadent! 
She eliminated the peanuts due to her son's allergies and used crushed toffee bars instead (yummy!!!). And in addition to the chocolate fudge, she added caramel topping. Positively TO DIE FOR!!

OMG, desserts don't come much easier than this.  My husband took a couple of bites and said "Ummm, why haven't you made this before?"  I used 24 ice cream sandwiches in my 9X13 dish.  The ice cream sandwiches were rather small and I had to cut a few in half lengthwise and widthwise to make them all fit.  I sprinkled heath bar crumbles too, along with the salted peanuts.  And after plating, I drizzled more hot fudge sauce and caramel sauce.  I let mine sit out for about 30 minutes, and it was still nice and cold.  My parents and husband were very surprised to hear that the dish was made with ice cream sandwiches.  A super easy, tasty dessert.  Thanks for sharing, Jody!

I was tempted to give this 4 stars because I was frustrated that it took more ice cream sandwiches than stated, but it was so good I can't help but give it 5! Definitely need at least 24 sandwiches, though! I did sandwiches, caramel, peanutes, cool whip, sandwiches, hot fudge, cool whip, peanuts as suggested by another reviewer. EVERYONE wanted the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years.  It is so fun to see the reactions of those who try it and are told it is made with ice cream sandwiches.  I rate and review recipes according to the EXACT recipe.  This one is 5 stars! I have made a few variations that are fantastic as well.  I have used caramel in place of the hot fudge. For another occasion, I used strawberry ice cream topping in place of the hot fudge, sliced bananas and put them on top of the top layer of ice cream sandwiches - just under the whipped cream.  When I served it, I drizzled it with chocolate sauce and VOILA!  Banana split dessert!  You can also find vanilla cookie ice cream sandwiches that are great for layering with peanut butter and bananas... the possibilities are endless! One thing is certain - no one had EVER guessed that this begins with ice cream sandwiches.  Thanks for the great kick start to a million possibilities!

Excellent!! I changed this up a bit...only did 1 layer of ice cream sandwiches which turned out to be plenty. One side topped with Dove Milk Chocolate and the other Carmel. Since this dish was for adults only, I mixed some DiSaronno Amaretti with the Fat Free Cool Whip and covered the entire dish. Talk about good! Finishing touch Ghirardelli white chocolate and Dove dark chocolate shavings on the top.

I'm NOT a desert maker - and when I had this for a family game night, everyone was shocked. . .then they tasted it. . and they were shocked even more!   I did a weight watchers version of this using their icecream sandwhiches and reduced fat whipped cream.    I agree with adding the nuts -  a great idea.

huge hit at the party! there were several desserts, so i figured i would have a lot to take back home, but that was not the case! everyone loved it and it was gone by the end! i used one reviewer's tip to use crushed butterfingers in lieu of peanuts, and it was amazing! i also didn't have any cool whip on hand, so i bought 2 large aresol cans of it (i didn't have time to wait for the tubs of cool whip to defrost).  
i am still in shock at how well it went over. i will definitely make this again! thank you for the great recipe jody!

I simply loved this idea!I am always looking for something easy and this was perfect! I made a few changes after reading several reviews. I could only find mini ice cream sandwiches but it worked out perfect because I did not have to slice them in half. I did put the hot fudge layer on the sandwiches first then the cool whip. Instead of peanuts, I used toffee bits. Next time I am going to try chopped up peanut butter cups! The possibilties are endless!!

I make this throughout the summer, with just a little modification (still using a 13x9 glass dish). One layer of each in this order... lite ice cream sandwiches, complete 16oz jar of hot fudge topping (microwaved for just less than a minute), salted peanuts chopped, 12oz lite cool-whip thawed, and a sprinking of more peanuts.

I'm not a dessert person But I make an exception for this!  I have made this about 5 times and have had to give the "recipe" to about 25 people.  No One believes that it is ice cream sandwiches!  I have used eahughes review (Aug 8, 07) input and perferred it using carmel sauce in the middle, hot fudge sauce on the top, then the Cooll Whip topped with lovely crushed Heath toffee bars.  YUMMY!  For our 4th of July party I put the toffee in the middle to keep the top all white, then topped with halved strawberry's and blueberry's to create an American flag.  What a Hit!   Thanks for a creation that I will be making forever!

This is absolutely AMAZING! The best dessert recipe EVER! I put a layer of sandwiches in a 9x13 pan, a layer of melted chunky peanut butter, a layer of half tub whip cream mixed w/ 1/2 packet dry chocolate pudding mix, sprinkled crumbled peanut butter cups, drizzled hot fudge and caramel sauce, another layer of ice cream sandwiches, spread the other half of the tub of whip cream, and sprinkled remaining peanut butter cups!  Freeze, eat, enjoy! DELICIOUS! This recipe will be used over and over and stored as a family favorite!

This is a great recipe.  I made it for my in laws and they absolutely loved it.  I made half of the dessert with hot fudge and the other half with carmel ice cream topping.  Everyone had to try both sides.  You can even add peanut butter ice cream topping.  It's a recipe everyone always asks for.

You wouldn't think something so easy could taste so delicious! People love this one! I do recommend that you put in the freezer after you do the first layer of sandwiches and whipped cream. It will help you spread the hot fudge on MUCH easier. I also used Heath Toffee Bits instead of peanuts and that was very delicious! :)

It was a fun, summer dessert, but I think perhaps I've moved beyond putting pre-made items along with pre-made sauce in a pan.  I like the idea, it looked nice, but it was just lacking a bit.  For what it is, it's fine, but due to the pre-packaged taste, it's not something I'd make again.

My family loves this dessert!!  I definitely tweek it to our tastes but I use this recipe as the basis. On the first layer of sandwiches I put caramel topping and crushed oreos.  I put cool whip on top of that and then another layer of sandwiches.  Then comes the hot fudge sundae topping and more crushed oreos.  I cover that layer with more cool whip and then drizzle hot fudge and caramel sundae topping over the top with crushed oreos to make a perfect (and rich) dessert

I loved this!  It's now the requested dessert when we go camping with our friends.  Just make it at home and stick it in the freezer.  I looked like a dessert goddess!!  No one needs to know, right?

This was so easy to make!!  The only thing I will do different next time is switch the peanuts for walnuts.  I used hot fudge that came in a pourable bottle to make it easier to spread between the layers.  Also, I ended up using more cool whip that what the recipe called for.

Made this for the 4th of July and everyone loved it.  A great basic recipe that can easily be built upon.  Next time I would use a large container of cool whip, add some peanut butter, and maybe some chopped snickers.

This was a very good dessert.The only change I made was to spread the fudge sauce  over the ice cream sandwiches first and then add the cool whip. This was a winner for me.

This is a great dessert. I made a pan of this along with a pecan pie and everyone came back for seconds and hardly touched the pie. I followed other suggestions and added carmel sauce between layers 1 and 2 and used skor chips instead of peanuts. It was delicous.

This recipe is fantastic and so easy!  I have made it several times, however, I changed it by adding caramel sauce along with the chocolate sauce.  I also substituted chopped pecans in place of the peanuts because so many of my friends and family are allergic to peanuts.  It is delicious!

Just wonderful! Took to a cookout and everyone raved about it! I stacked mine on a rectangle (longaberger) plate, which allowed me to spread cool whip on the sides. Looked more like a cake, great apperance, and made very easy to slice right through. Yum, Yum, Yum!

The french vanilla cool whip was great with it!  And I crumbled up some reses cups for the top (don't like peanuts)!! Fantastic!! Thanks for sharing!

So easy to put together & everyone at our family reunion loved it. Left out the nuts (allergies) & it still turned out great, but I felt it lacked a bit of crunch, so I will definitely try the toffee bits next time.

This recipe is so good in the summer time when everyone wants ice cream cake.  I make the following changes, I crush oreo cookies and stir them in the cool whip I also use carmel and hot fudge sauce.  You can also use the neopolitan icecream sandwiches for a nice change.

So wonderful and simple, but makes a fancy looking dessert!  Who dosn't love icecream sandwhichs?  One piece of advice.  Only take one or two icecream sandwhichs out of your freezer at a time.  They melt quickly and are much easier to handle when not too soft.

I made it with a layer of vanilla ice cream sandwiches followed by caramel syrup, cool whip, mint chocolate chip sandwiches, hot fudge sauce, cool whip, peanuts and just a touch of heath toffee bits.  Everyone wanted the recipe, and was totally shocked to find out how easy it was.  I would give it 10 stars if I could

I used 24 sandwiches also, I think mine were kinda small in size. I could have used a few more to fill in areas that had gaps. I used peanut butter chips on the top and hot fudge in the middle. Such a great and easy dessert. My daughter just turned 22 and asked for this again for her birthday!

Very cute and easy recipe.  My kids made this and added colored sprinkles as one of the layers.  We didn't use all the fudge and we wish we did. It was hard to spread but we just smeared it into the cool whip.  I can't wait to experiment and doctor up the  cool whip to give it more flavor.  The nut part was the best for me so I wouldn't skip that.  My husband thought it was delicious.  Cute treat that's different and easy for the kids to help.

I'm going to make this when my hubby comes home for R&R, b/c he loves ice cream sandwiches, and I'm going to use chocolate sprinkles. I'm thinking about trying this with vanilla ice cream sandwiches and rainbow sprinkles for my daughter's birthday. Thanks!

I love this recipe! It's so fast, and so simple! Even my super picky husband loved this.  The only change I made was to use fat free cool whip and Hershey's syrup to cut down on the fat/calories somewhat.  Also, since it's just for the two of us, I made it in a loaf pan using 10 ice cream sandwiches and 8 oz. cool whip - it worked great! I'll definitely be making this again!

Absolutely delicious!!! If you are going to a bbq in the near future than this is the perfect dessert to bring. My family loved it. I did take another viewer's suggestion and let the cool whip firm up in the freezer before spreading the fudge sauce on top. This will be a highly requested dessert at our house. Thanks soo much for sharing!!

My husband and I can't get enough of this delicious and easy dessert! I made one very minor change; instead of peanuts I topped this dish with mini chocolate chips. Then I drizzled and swirled the hot fudge sauce on the middle layer and the top layer for a very nice look (before adding the mini chocolate chips).

I made this for a work party and everyone loved it.  Since there were people there that are allergic to nuts, I used chocolate chips instead.  I think if I make this for a summer party, I'll use strawberries in the middle with the fudge.  Very easy to make, and extremely tasty!

I really wanted to LOVE this...  I'm a huge fan of ice cream and ice cream sandwiches.  I made this for a football party and followed the directions exactly, except for substituting pecans for peanuts.  The kids liked it, but one of the adults said, "This tastes like ice cream sandwiches and cool whip, and it did. It was nothing special.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but after reading so many reviews and hearing from so many people that you can't taste the ice cream sandwiches and it tastes like ice cream cake.....I was a little disappointed.  I wouldn't make this for a group of adults again.  I would make it for the kids, though.

This was delicious and looked very impressive...my guest thought I bought it.  Tasted as good as it look.   May improvise next time with different toppings.  Made as the recipe stated.  But I needed to use 30 sandwiches (they were small) and I did microwave the hot chocolate a little before spreading it.  This is definately a keeper!!

I loved it. The kids loved it. We even made it as a dish for an auction, and the people who bid and won loved it.

This was very easy to make! The only difference I made was to add crushed peanut butter cups in the middle just for something extra!

So easy and fun! I broke Oreos on top instead of peanuts.

Used Sugar free hot fudge and sugar free ice cream sandwiches and chopped the peanuts. Was one of the best ice cream cakes we've ever had, and about $20 cheaper than store bought. The hardest part is unwrapping the sandwiches; you will have no trouble making this!

Made this with the "Hot Fudge" recipe from this site since I didn't want to go to the store. Used cashews instead of peanuts.

The hardest part about this recipe is unwrapping the sandwiches. Very good recipe, probably better for the summer instead of the middle of winter...but still tastes great

So great and SOOO easy.  I took the suggestions here and layered the hot fudge BEFORE the whipped topping.  I also added a layer of mini marshmallows and instead of a second layer of hot fugde, I did a layer of carmel!!  SOOOO YUMMY!!

This is so good!  I had to use 24 ice cream sandwiches to fill a 9x13 pan, and I used some caramel sauce and some hot fudge sauce, both the Smucker's Sugar Free varieties.  Topped with chopped Take Five bars, everyone raved at our 4th of July picnic!  I will definitely make this again whenever I want to "Wow" the crowd.  You can't let this sit out for long.  Keep it in the freezer whenever you aren't serving it.

Easy, but fancy looking dessert.  For a holiday party, I found eggnog flavored ice cream sandwiches.  Also, to dress it up a little, I added crushed whoppers to the top and in the layers.  I didn't need quite as many ice cream sandwiches as the recipe called for.  I only did one layer of each of the ingredients, and it was still plenty.

It is amazing how beautiful and fancy this looks.  I made this while on a family vacation (13people) and everyone loved it. I wanted something really easy that would not take a lot of prep work from me.  It makes a lot, some even had it for breakfast the next day.

My friends thought I had gone to extreme work with making thin layers of cake.  They thought it looked professional.  AND it was AMAZING to boot!  The salted peanuts just put a great finish to all of the sweetness!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was great!  Made this for my son's pool party and people loved it.  Instead of peanuts I sprinkled crushed Butterfinger bar over the top.  I also think toffee bits would be awesome too.  Thanks!

This recipe was great.  I cut the recipe in half and made in a loaf pan.  It was easy to prepare and delicious.  Tastes fabulous.  Could not have picked a better recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this dessert for church.  I received sooo many raves I was embarrassed.  It was great!  I did add, however, some caramel sauce on the top layer--something about salted peanuts and caramel sauce just says, yes!
