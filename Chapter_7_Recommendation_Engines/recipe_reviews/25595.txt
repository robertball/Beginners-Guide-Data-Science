this cake is easy to make and has a good flavor
however, if you find it a bit dry add powdered
sugar and butter together over low heat
until you get a buttery glaze add a little lemon
extract if you wish,and pour over warm cake.
example; 1cup p.sugar to 1/3 cup butter
but make it simple make as little or as much
glaze to your cake as you wish .

This cake is fool proof! I did tweek it  bit to fit me. I added lemon zest to it, I also used margarine out the fridge instead of the shortening. The cake came out wonderful. I think this recipe is great for the least experinced baker to an old pro

This is a lovely recipe!  I did not have any butter flavoured shortening, so I just used butter and it turned out fine.  I added a tad more lemon extract also then what was called for.  I halved the recipe and put it in a bundt pan instead of a tube pan.  The glaze I used consisted of melted butter, confectioner's sugar, milk and lemon extract.  Will definately make again!

I've made this twice; once I didn't have enough sour cream on hand, so I used some cream cheese as well, and the second time I didn't have *any* sour cream, so I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and used condensed milk in place of the cream. Delicious both times. I serve with fresh berries and whipped cream for dessert, or plain with coffee.

I really loved this cake.  I put the batter in a smaller pan and it over flew, as soon as it started baking.  I just greased a larger pan quickly and poured the batter in.  With all this tragedy the cake was awesome!  "Foolproof"

this recipe was delicious!  I loved it and so did my family. My father described as thick, like bread.  i really enjoyed this recipe!  P.S.  i am lactose intolerant so I used rice milk. It tasted great just the same.

I made this cake and it was exactly what I had a taste for. I used a cup of sweet creamed butter in the place of the shortening and the consistency was perfect (it reminded me of my grandmother's cake). I also used fresh squeezed lemons along with lemon zest in the cake for some extra tartness and was very satisfied with the results. I look forward to making this cake again.

What a perfect recipe! I love lemon, I made these for my brothers house-warming party as little flower cakelettes, topped with a simple lemon confectioners glaze. They were a total hit, much more popular than the excellent chocolate cakes I made. This is a recipe I'll make again and again, very classic and elegant. And just as the recipe says perfect with a nice cup of tea.

great recipe indeed & i followed it as is, but the only problem is that i didnt change the scaling and the default 16 servings recipe is way too much (oh, i didnt use a tube pan, but a regular 10" round pan) - & the cake mix was enough for two of my cake pans so next time I will just halve the recipe portions.  perfect moist pound cake texture - delicious taste!  i tried my hand at making glaze from melting 1/3 cup butter with 1 cup powder sugar - now that didnt work....it just kinda turned out too dry (not of drizzle consistency) & I didnt know how to fix that. Other than my glaze problem, a GREAT cake recipe.

I made this for my wife, who absolutely loved it. I thought it was a little dry. Next time, I'll reduce baking time a little bit, and I will let it cool longer than 10 minutes. The cake fell apart a bit when I tried to remove it from the pan. Excellent flavor, though.

I read a bunch of reviews and was amazed at how many complained that it either fell, or was dry.  Folks, if it fell, you didn't cook it long enough.  If it was dry, you cooked it too long.  It's as easy as that.  I used butter instead of butter flavored shortening.  That stuff is like wax in you bloodstream.  Also, it tastes awful and stinks.  My cake came out perfectly moist and very good.  I've made lemon pound cakes before but lost the recipe.  I wasn't sure about this one, but as you can see, I love it.  It's better than my old recipe.

Made exactly as written and it's perfect! Made into three loaf pans and baked for 35/40 minutes.  Shortening gives such a great texture and makes this super moist, I would imagine using butter would be ok but not the same.

This was one good cake !!! I used reduced fat margerine in stead of shortening, 1 fat free lemon yogurt in stead of sour cream and only half the sugar (the yogurt is already sweetened). These were the ingredients I had on hand but it worked out perfectly. The cake was ewtrmely moist and flavorful. Thanks for sharing !!

This is a wonderful recipe! I didn't have enough shortening, so I used softened regular margarine instead. I also used a little butter flavoring. The nutmeg gives it just that little bit of something extra. I took a half tub of store bought vanilla icing, mixed with about a TBSP lemon juice and a little lemon extract and drizzled over the top. Yummy! The texture of the cake was just right. It was not dry at all. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe pretty closely. The only things I changed were slightly less baking powder about 1/4 tsp less and 25 degrees hotter oven. This is to compensate for high altitude where I live. Also, I didn't have lemon extract so I used lemon juice.  Cake turned out great, very light and fluffy. There's just a hint of lemon taste and I would prefer stronger so next time I will add more lemon juice or zest.

This is a great recipe! Not too hard to make and fun to bake. I did not have lemon extract so I made Orange Pound cake with orange extract instead! It still tasted great. For extra fun, I added food coloring. I did not have any butter flavored shortening so I used softened butter. This is a great recipe that i would definitely recommend!

Very easy and super quick.  Great for tea parties.  I like my very lemony so I double the lemon in the cake.  I also top my with a thick lemon glaze. (1 1/2 cup powder sugar 2 teaspoons lemon extract and a touch of milk till I get the consistency I want)

Not sure what happened here. Like some reviews that I read, my cake fell. I followed the recipe to a T. The taste was forgettable and I could barely taste any lemon. Sorry, would not make again.

Made this pound cake today for the first time. I didn't have butter flavored shortening on hand, so I used 1 stick of margarine and a 1/2 cup of shortening, 1 tsp butter flavoring, 1 tsp lemon bakery emulsion and 1 tsp real lemon extract. I wanted a true lemon flavor so I omitted the nutmeg. Baked in a 10" tube pan at 350 for 60-70 minutes. Let it cool for about 15 minutes before turning it out of the pan. Smelled delish while baking. Drizzled with a lemon-butter rum glaze (about a Tbsp of melted butter, about a cup of powered sugar, rum to taste, dash of milk - sorry I didn't measure it, just made by sight :)). Pretty good basic lemon pound.

This cake was easy to make but came out dry and crumbly with very little lemon flavor. I even added the zest of 2 lemons. Would not make again.

Made it twice in one week. I shared it with my grandparents and they loved it(my picky eaters). I couldn't get enough. The only change I made was using butter instead of shortening. Will be making this for many years to come!

Excellent. For the sour cream I added 2tbsps vinegar and proceeded with recipe. I used lemon essence and lemon rind and actually added 2tbsps of poppy seed and turned this into a lemon poppy seed cake. Going to make it again but this time as a pineapple upside down. Sorry forgot to take pics, would do for pineapple upside down.

This is a wonderful cake recipe.  I also put lemon glaze on this cake and it came out great.  You can taste and enjoy the lemony taste.  Must make it. Also it did cook about 50 mins so make sure after 45 mins you stick it with a toothpick.  Cake can overdry when you cook it too long.  Came out beautifully!!! 5 stars!!!

It came out wonderfully and definitely not too dry. It goes perfectly with coffee or tea, and tastes great with a little bit of butter melted on top.

This is a wonderful lemon pound cake, I made it and it has a very fine grain. A very creamy, moist, lemony cake.  I made it and served it with sugared sliced strawberries.  I have also served it with a blueberry raspberry compote.  AWESOME!!

This is one of the best recipes for pound cake I have made. I love lemon and there isn't enough extract to add for a wonderful flavor. Some of the reviews say not to use a bundt pan but it has always turned out fantastic. I followed the directions exactly and this cake turns out moist and dense. I add lots of lemon extract on top of the vanilla. I undercook my cake slightly to keep it moist and let it sit in the pan for about 10 minutes. I have made this cake about 5 times now and it is a hit. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!

Followed the recipe exactly but it still fell, even after baking for almost 1.5 hours. Taste was OK though.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars because I just made it and had to make several adjustments. My changes were: I added lemon zest, doubled the amount of lemon extract and omitted the nutmeg. (I wanted a really lemony cake!) The baking took about one hour.  I then made a lemon glaze from powder sugar, milk and lemon extract, which I poured over the cake after it had cooled for about 15 minutes.  I poured the glaze in several coatings/phases so that it was thicker each time. The ends of the cake were rather dry and crumbled like bread, as others have described. However, the rest of the cake was actually moist.  Overall, it is very good with milk or coffee. :)

I made this with alterations because I did not have all of the original recipe ingredients in the house.  I used margarine instead of the shortening and real lemon juice instead of the extract.  I also make it in a bundt pan.  I made the recipe for 24 servings and added about a teaspoon more of lemon juice and also 1t ground lemon peel.  I was careful not to overbake the cake.  I let it cool for about 10 min then flipped it outside of the pan.  I was disappointed not to see a recipe for a glaze attached to this recipe so I used another glaze recipe that I found.  This seems to be a great base recipe to use to get creative and add other flavors/ingredients.

This is a delicious and surprisingly light cake. I used butter instead of shortening.  I also don't use extracts, so used fresh squeezed lemon juice and lemon zest instead. Made no other changes to the cake recipe and didn't make the glaze. Tastes great on its own. When I had guests over though, I whipped together some mascarpone cheese, with a little heavy cream, honey, a splash of lemon juice and sprinkle of lemon zest, as a topping, to accompany  the cake and it was a hit!

This recipe is super easy & works very well. I made a few changes to adjust it to my tastes. I used all butter instead of the butter flavored shortening. No vanilla flavoring, all lemon flavoring with an extra teaspoon for more intense flavor. Next time I will probably try a splash of lemon juice as well..  I used lactose free milk.  I replaced the sugar with a Truvia blend. I discovered that I was out of nutmeg & used ground cinnamon.Since I used a bundt pan, I had to adjust the baking time  & just gauged it by sight.  Will definitely be baking this again soon

I will definitely recommend doing this recipe in a circle pan it makes it look nicer for festivities. Also add a little lemon zest and use butter not flavored shortening. Probably the best thing I've put in my mouth in my whole baking life.

I didn't have lemon extract, so I used orange peel-- to make it Orange Pound Cake! It wasn't bad, but next time I will use the extract...and vegetable oil instead of lard.

I made this cake yesterday and it was perfect! I only had 1/4 tsp of lemon extract, so I made up the difference with fresh squeezed lemon juice, added lemon zest and used 1 cup butter. I didn't frost it, but it was perfect without frosting - moist and full of lemon flavor! This will be a family favorite! Thanks for sharing!

Very very simple and easy to make! I've tried a few variations with flavorings and extracts such as orange extract and orange zest, coconut extract and a coconut glaze and each turned out marvelously. I've also substituted buttermilk for the milk and the extra little "bite" it gave it was something I'd recommend to anyone who wants to try that! I too have used butter instead of shortening and it seemed a bit moister than the basic recipe and maybe a tad heavier.

Prepared to the letter. It came out great! I did add a glaze of lemon juice and confectioners sugar.

I stuck mostly to the recipe with the addition of grated lime zest since I didn't have any lemons. This recipe is the consistency of cornbread and though the taste is ok, it's not as sweet as my well talked about Five Flavor pound cake. This cake is just ok and needs to be doctored up for me to take it anywhere for others to eat.

easy to make, smooth and moist.  I made it in my pamper chef stoneware bundt cake pan and it took a few extra minutes (as PC's directions say will) delicious!  No frosting needed.
