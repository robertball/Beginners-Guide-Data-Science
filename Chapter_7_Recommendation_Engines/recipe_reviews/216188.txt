I reduced the servings to 4 allowing for faster cooking time on the noodles and baking time. I used canned peas and fresh mushrooms. Also used Sea Salt instead of the Iodized type. I found this to be a tasty recipe and a definate keeper. Thanks!

It's a great recipe for a base but its quite bland. I added old bay to the water for the shrimp, and cooked the noodles in a separate pot. I sauteed two crushed cloves of garlic in the butter before adding the flour, and added black pepper and a dash of dehydrated onions (I have a picky eater that won't eat onions any other way). I also added parmesan to the crushed crackers too. Mega hit at my house.

I made some changes because I didn't have everything on hand. I used elbow macaroni instead of egg noodles, chicken broth instead of most of the milk, Italian bread crumbs and Parmesan instead of butter crackers. I am anxious to try it again using the real ingredients, although my sub's worked deliciously!

My family liked this recipe and when we had leftovers they tasted even better so I would consider making this the day before I wanted it and sticking it in the fridge. It did end up taking a lot more than 20 minutes of prep time though!

My changes were to thicken with cornstarch instead of flour, and like others, I added more and different vegetables. I did not have cream so I substituted. What I did to make it not so bland was to brown some minced garlic in the butter and I used dried chopped onion. Additionally, I didn't have any crackers on hand, but I did have some leftover cornbread from the previous morning, so I crumbled that and it worked out.

Next time I might consider browning fresh chopped onion with the garlic, possibly using a dash of chili powder, and I might throw in a can of beans to up the protein content. I will not skip the cream next time as I think the richness will increase the flavor. Definitely sticking with the cornbread topping and may throw a dash of Parmesan on top too.
Going into my "Fish on Friday" file permanently.

Very interesting combination. We liked it, though. I used milk rather than cream, just because I don't usually keep it around. We will probably make this again, and maybe up the spices. Thanks for sharing!

I thought it was a little bland although the simpleness and creativity was good i think it could have used a little more flavor

I really, really enjoyed this, but did make a couple of minor alterations.

First, I used a large can of mushrooms (it's what I had in the pantry).  I also added old bay to the water before i cooked the shrimp and a touch more when i added the pasta.  I added a little grated parmesean cheese to the sauce (mine wouldn't thicken, and this helped give it a touch more flavor).  I sprinkled a little more cheese and a bit of paprika on top before baking.  

It was absolutely delicious, and i almost when back for a 3rd piece!

I read the recipe and thought it was a good base recipe, but made some major tweaks. Instead of boiling the shrimp, I roasted it, with salt, pepper, and a little Cajun seasoning. I sauteed fresh mushrooms, along with some chopped onion and minced garlic, and built the sauce from that. I seasoned the sauce with some Cajun seasoning. It was good, but I feel like it would have been pretty bland without the extra flavors.

My family loves this. I did tweek it a bit. I use fresh mushrooms & corn instead of peas. I also added some bay scallops and a small can of lump crabmeat.  I agree with a previous post that it is even better the next day!

Shrimp was overcooked in the process - what do you expect when it needs to be in the oven for an hr :(

I tried it tonight and found it a little blank. It needs garlic or something to spice it up.

My husband found this recipe and when he showed it to me I was skeptical.  3 cups of milk and cream, no real seasoning to add extra flavour and in the oven for over an hour?!?  But he is new since retiring to this cooking thing, so I was supportive.  I'm sorry to say this was awful.  Not even palatable, AWFUL.  Overcooked, not any flavour, shrimp are tough and it's baked for so long that the milk/cream mixture is nonexistent.  Look elsewhere.  Sorry :(

Really good. I added some Italian seasoning to the sauce for some added flavor (dry oregano, parsley and basil mix). I think the crackers added a nice crunch when not crushed so finely. With those additions our whole family and my picky best friend loved it! Will definitely make again.

I was so excited to try this tonight, but I must have done a few things wrong.  I used the "adjustment" feature to automatically recalculate the ingredients, as I was making this for only two people (and I don't have a 9 x 13 dish).  Perhaps the numbers were not quite accurate?  

It was incredibly dry and lacked a lot of flavor.  Because I was using a smaller dish, I did reduce the cooking time to about 25 minutes, but I could see as it was cooking that the pasta layer on the bottom did not have any sauce on it.

I took other reviewers' suggestions and threw a few smashed garlic cloves in with the butter when making the sauce, and I also added 2T of parmesan and a generous amount of pepper.  It was still very bland.

I refuse to give up and will try this recipe again, as I love ALL of the ingredients, but I will study more reviews and see if I can tweak it a bit to make it creamier and more flavorful.  Perhaps a little curry might do the trick.  Anyone tried curry?

Also, there was no heavy cream at my grocery store so I substituted sour cream instead (which, sadly, is very "runny" here in the Philippines - not thick like it is in the U.S.).  That could have caused another problem? 

I will try it again and update my review.  Thanks for posting -- everyone else loves the dish, so I'm sure it's my mistake(s) that caused this!  :)
