The more I make this, the more I like it. It has become a  staple of my diet, because I can make a batch on Sunday, freeze it in individual portions, and have it for lunch at work all week.  (Note: if freezing, do not add the noodles until the moment before you put it in the freezer, to prevent over-absorption of the liquid.)

This was really great. I needed to make it vegan  so I substituted vegetable stock. They only thing I would do different is I would not add the pasta to the soup. It soaked up so much of the liquid I had to add additional stock when I went to use the left overs. I will add past to the bowl and pour over the soup

Great, easy recipe. I Made a few alterations. skipped the spinach and carrots and added a 16 oz bag of frozen mixed green beans,carrots and corn. Used crushed tomatoes with olive oil and sea salt. Substituted garbanzo beans. Added tbs of ground oregano and used vegetable stock instead of chicken.

Excellent, hardy soup!  I omitted the oregano, wine, green beans, pinto beans  and added cabbage, zucchini, peas, cannelloni beans.  It's thick and super flavorful - I'm dining on it daily!  Love it!

A great, easy soup and made the house smell wonderful. I wouldn't change a thing, although I ADDED browned ground turkey just because  we are meat lovers (definitely not necessary).

I followed the recipe, but did not include the wine. I also added black eyed peas, and it was a hit with the entire family. Makes a large pot full. Fantastic and healthy!
