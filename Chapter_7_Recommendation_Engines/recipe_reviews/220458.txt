I made my egg dye using 1 cup warm water & 1/4 cup white vinegar + green food color.  My eggs must have had really thick membranes because even though I thoroughly cracked the shells the dye didn't soak through to the egg white except for in a couple of places.  WARNING - if you want to pipe the filling into the eggs do not use a star tip - the celery plugged the tip - I pushed a little too hard to try and clear it and ended up with a green egg yolk explosion.  As for the filling it needs to be kicked up a notch.  Thanks for a fun idea - it just didn't work out too well for me.

Not as easy as stated! Getting the marbled effect for the whites was far from easy & required far more effort than these directions noted. I had to take cuticle scissors & cut through the membrane - following some of the broken shell marks - before soaking to get anything like what was pictured.  Way way too much work.

This is a fun idea!  Everyone at our gathering loved it. I plan to repeat it for Easter with pastels.  Easy to do if you plan ahead for the dye to adequately color the egg whites.  I let them sit overnight.   But next time I'll make the yolk filling more interesting this time with some of the traditional ideas for deviled eggs.
