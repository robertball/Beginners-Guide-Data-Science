Okay, good cooks and foodie people. This sorbet is probably for foodie tasters and viewers to determine the level of what you can handle on such shows that may be close to the thoughts of weird food combinations involving competitors. In not wanting to waste all that fresh celery. I went for the outside the box celery sorbet, fresh and sweet, and you can, taste the celery. It's celery. I enjoyed, but unless you have adventure eaters as family and friends they may go to the corner store and get some ice cream. 
In the realm of food culture it is in the high end category of what to with this in the kitchen of creative ideas. I finished it off about a week ago. I had forgotten it in the freezer for a moment. Now, remember sorbet has lots of sugar, which made this a sorbet and flavorful.

Try it  yourself,
Foodie Kim

Absolutely wonderful treat! I used honey instead of simple syrup and didn't strain the mixture. I just let it sit in the freezer for several hours by mixing the mixture every 30 minutes. 

I sure will make this again!

Surprisingly delicious although I would cut down the sugar by at least half.
