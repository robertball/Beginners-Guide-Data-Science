This is a really tasty recipe for a burger-like entree. I was surprised by the meaty consistency and I think the recipe could also be turned into a tasty vegetarian meatloaf.

Kind of grainy and monotonous tasting. I think next time I'll make it into "meatballs" and cover with vegetarian gravy over noodles.
