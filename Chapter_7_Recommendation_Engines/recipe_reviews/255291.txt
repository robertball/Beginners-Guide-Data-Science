1.16.17 Made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. You can a nice pop of the lemon but not overwhelming. Next time I might try substituting some fresh dill for the chives just as an option. Worked well as a condiment for salmon cakes.

Yum! I think this may be my new tarter sauce for everything. Made a half recipe and followed it exactly except used dried chives and parsley. Delicious! A new favorite. Served with Chef John's Crab Cakes from this site. Can't wait to try it with some grilled salmon.

My lemon was rather large, so I only used the juice from one half and it was perfect.  We put it over asparagus and even my picky grandsons loved it.

Yummy on grilled shrimp. Didn't have dry mustard just carefully put in Dijon to taste. Added more lemon to taste. Will make again for sure.

This is soooo good!! Made exactly as directed I served it with salmon patties then decided it should also go on a tomato cut into chunks and to top broccoli that was partially steamed then sauteed in olive oil with crushed red pepper. It was a great meal!

Although not a true aioli it's still a wonderful sauce full of flavor! I didn't change a thing. For a large meeting I soaked chicken breasts in a honey lemon sage brine roasted them and served sliced thin on croissants with this sauce. Rave reviews from everyone!

This was quick and easy to put together. The lemon and lemon zest made all the difference in the world. I used this over salmon patties as well as a drizzle over asparagus. It was divine! Itâ€™s 5 stars as written but I also like Skipping the mustard and adding dill to change it up.

I made this today and love it! I had it with some ceviche shrimp and it was delicious. I'm looking forward to using it on Shrimp tacos tomorrow. I made it exactly per the recipe (except the parsley because I forgot to buy it). It was perfect as is but I will definitely put the parsley in next time. Great recipe thank you!

Really delicious, well balanced recipe. The lemon is perfect with seafood. I did sub nonfat Greek yoghurt for sour cream, cause it's what I had on hand.  Will use this tonight with salmon cooked in the smoker with lemon, parsley, garlic, salt and olive oil.  Would be great with roasted potatoes, too.
