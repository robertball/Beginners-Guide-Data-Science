This is delicious!  Been making this for many years. I got the same recipe from a neighbor. I will never change the ingredients. It's fine the way it is!

I liked this very much, but did cut it down to a smaller scale.  After cooking orzo, I put cooked orzo in a bowl and added juice to orzo without heating and allowed the juice to absorb into orzo, stirring occasionally.  Once juice was absorbed into orzo, I put the bowl of orzo into the refrigerator for about an hour.  After given time to cool, I added fruit in recipe (1 can of pineapple tidbits, 1 can mandarin oranges, and maraschino cherries) to bowl I also added some coconut flakes and crushed pecans.  Then I mixed in cool whip, until well blended.  Ihe salad isn't thick but it's lightly sweet and very enjoyable.

I use fruit cocktail instead of pineapple chunks and have used both a can of regular and large chunk fruit cocktail to change the textures a bit.  I also add a large jar of maraschino cherries  along with the called for can of crushed pineapple and large can or 2 smaller cans of mandarin oranges.  Drain all juices into pan to thicken as listed, then add most of a large tub of cool whip.  It's what I had on hand and now the family and friends ask for it!  Both the original recipe and my adapted are very good!

My brother LOVES this stuff.  I made it more out of sentimentality than anything for Easter this year.  It went over poorly with my husband's family. Texture was an issue. Flavor is sweet enough.

I have made Rosa Marina for years, and it is a reliable hit. I mix the pasta and thickened juices and let them blend overnight before adding the fruit. Also, I have found that an 8oz. tub of Cool Whip is plenty.

I cut the recipe in half because it makes so much, so only used the can of crushed pineapple and not the chunks. I cooked the syrup but it didn't thicken, even after cooling for 30 minutes, so brought it back up to a slow boil, mixed 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in a tablespoon of water, added that, brought it to  boil, and it thickened nicely. Definitely a keeper!

I like this recipe, but do not like how the egg whites clump up in the sauce.

I love this fruit salad made just the way the recipe says.  I think it would also make a very good dessert since it is sweet and light.  More kinds of fruit could be added also, but it is so good just the way it is.

Very good,but...The amount the recipe makes is HUGE! If you want an amount for a one time dinner, try to scale it down. We had a ton leftover.

Instead of the chunks of pineapple, cherries and mandarin oranges, I cut up strawberries and added blueberries. It was delicious.

Delicious as-is! But I usually make it without the eggs, flour, and added sugar. I simply mix the cooked orzo with the fruits (the kind packed in 100% fruit juice) and their juices and let that refrigerate until I'm ready to eat it. Then I fold in the whipped cream and serve. Yum!

The orzo made it weird and unpleasant. Many tried it, no one took more than a spoonful and it went into the garbage.

This was a big hit at  the sprinkle I made it for. I did not change a thing and made it just as instructed. It makes ALOT! It is very similar to ambrosia but with pasta instead of marshmallow. I will definitely make it again.
