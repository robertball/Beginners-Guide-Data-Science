OH MY!!!!  I love this salsa.  I have a local orchard in town and picked up a peck of ripe peaches this week.  If it's good with canned, it is excellent with fresh.  I scaled it to 24 servings and it made 10 pint jars (should have scaled to 30 and it would have made 12 jars).  I did add a teaspoon of ground cumin when adding salt and pepper.

Wow! This salsa came out even better than I expected. I made very few changes (used fresh peaches instead of canned, but ground ginger instead of fresh - just what I had on hand). The flavors mixed very well together, and I can't imagine substituting any of them (except trying other fruits). I did add more chipotles, but I'm guessing mine were not as spicy as normal because I'm VERY wimpy about spice - would have been fine as directed, however. I marinated some chicken with the salsa for about three hours, then baked it all for 40 minutes at 350. Came out PERFECT. Tasted good on its own as well - I'll be making this for the next cookout I attend. One thing though - prep time is definitely more than 10 minutes to chop and mince all those ingredients.

I don't think you are supposed to provide such incredible recipies - I believe you are supposed to hold something back and keep the really spectacular recipies to yourself... thanks this was wonderful.  I've used this twice now and have people convinced it is an old family secret and I can't share the details.  Great Stuff - thanks.

I actually switched this recipe up quite a bit, but what I put together was great, so I'll give this recipe the credit for that and 5 stars.  I made this with mango and chipotle powder, since I had that on hand.  I spread it over chicken and baked it for 40 mins.  It was great.  Thanks.

Fabulous recipe!  I used fresh peaches and then pureed all the ingredients in my food processor.  Added some honey for sweetness and then canned it as a sauce!  Use it for grilling on chicken, pork or fish.  Also can put it in the crock pot with pork or chicken & serve on Hawaiian sweet rolls!  AWESOME!

Made this for the 4th of July family gathering.  The taste and texture is outstanding.  It was a big hit.  The only modification I made was that I added a little extra minced chipotle to up the heat a little.

This recipe has potential, but after following it twice I've found it has a LOT of ginger flavor, way too much for my liking.  So with the ginger scaled back profusely, I would definitely recommend it.

I'm giving this one 4 stars because while I love it, others find it too hot for their palates.  If you like it hot, it's a definite 5-star.  If you can't take the heat, it only gets a three.  Split the difference and it gets an overall "4 stars".

I made this as a last minute topping for some black bean burgers I was making, and I really enjoyed it. I had to modify it a bit to use what I had on hand. I added 1/2 a yellow bell pepper and tomato. Left out the chipotle peppers (didn't have them) but subbed with a chipotle hot sauce. Left out the cilantro and added cumin. Left out the ginger and used some cinnamon instead. I also added some sugar to counter balance the potent onions I used. This went perfectly with my burgers and I can't wait to make it again with all the intended ingredients.

I made this the other night and served it over some grilled chicken I marinated in a mango sauce and it came out pretty good. I used fresh peaches however instead of canned because I wanted the flavor of the fruit to be the stand out. I also used about 3 chipotles instead of the one because with just the one it was a little on the bland side. Plus I enjoy food with a lot of fire to it, so adding that much more was perfect and it blended really well with the lime juice and the cilantro. I had enough left over and gave it to my neighbors and they loved it too! I'll make this again though and try it on some pork chops or halibut.

Spicy and delicious. Great alternative salsa- only change I make is to puree the end result. People seem to love it and can never guess that the subtle background flavor is ginger... **tried recently with 1 lg champagne mango instead of peaches-delicious.

I served this with a bbq chicken breast and loved it. I'm not a big fan of canned fruit but it worked for this recipe.  I'll defintely make it again.

This is really a good salsa recipe,I made one change,however, I used fresh mango instead of the peaches. They are in season right now and are great for salsas.
 Try this with grilled shrimp for a great appetizer while bar-b-queing.

I really wanted to love this salsa, but I just didn't.  I enjoy spicy food, but if I do make this agin I will decrease the chipotles.  Too hot even for this Southwestern gal!

Wonderful!  This was even better than I had anticipated.  I used white onions and about half of one jalapeno pepper instead of the red onions and minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce   simply because I did no have either on hand. I served it on chicken breasts that were cooked on the grill. I liked it better warmed slightly, so I piled the salsa on top of the chicken on th grill and let them sit for a minute to warm teh salsa.  Wonderful flavor!  I will use this one again!

Good stuff isn't it? I buy large jars of Sam's choice ( Wal-Mart brand)Peach pineapple chipotle salsa and just love it. I'm not a big cilantro eater and yes, I know it's in most salsa.
   If you like fruit in your salsa I'm sure you'll like this recipe.
   Only three stars 'cus I've got to have tomatoes.

Loved this salsa. Didn't have peaches so I used canned pears, oregano instead of cilantro and white onion instead of red. I also used a can of diced tomatoes with (hot) habanero chilies. That's all I had on hand, and it was oh soooo delicious! Great recipe!

Loved it - great flavor - great as a topper or just on its own.  The Chipolte peppers give it a good kick.  Nice combination of flavors. Thanks for sharing!

This is an awesome salsa, simply delicious and besides looks very colorful and pretty. A complete hit with nachos.

The salsa was good and a nice change in flavor.  I was not very keen on the flavor initially, but I let it marinate a bit and the flavors came together yet kept their own distinctive taste.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try something new.

I didn't have any chipotle peppers in adobo sauce so I used chipotle powder.  Still very tasty.

I used half a cup of chopped canned peaches, and half a cup of chopped mango. I knew this was going to be way too hot for me (and I'm not a huge salsa fan either) so this is Husband's star rating and review. He really enjoyed it, saying that the combination of flavors was 'really different' and 'super tasty.' The only complaint was that even though he has an asbestos mouth when it comes to spicy food, this was too hot even for him. I rectified this by simply adding more peach and mango. Great recipe. Thanks, Oompah!

I made this salsa using fresh peaches from my tree, and with the help of my food processor and it was a breeze to make. Very tasty, in fact my husband wants me to make more to share with our friends.

This is our go- to recipe ALL SUMMER LONG! We use fresh peaches or mangoes in place of canned and that is the only change. It is quick,  flavorful and complements just about any food, whether grilled or not. We make it by the pound for events and when everyone starts begging for the recipe, I tell them it's a secret! Thanks for one of rhe best recipes we've ever had!

Love this.  This year's yield from my white peach tree was about 10 cups once the slicing and dicing were completed, so I scaled up the recipe to 30 servings as previous reviewer suggusted.  Tip:  if you are using fresh peaches as I did, have a bowl handy with the lime juice already in it, this will prevent browning as you peel, slice and dice.  End product was 9 quart jars canned.  Huge hit at the family reunion.

Liked the combination of flavors and the heat. Nice with grilled chicken, also flavored with chipotle.
