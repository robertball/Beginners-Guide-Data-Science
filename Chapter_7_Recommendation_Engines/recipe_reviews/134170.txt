I am totally shocked that this has gone five years without another review.  This was really great---just like what you'd get at a Lawry's restaurant.  I would maybe add a little more horseradish next time, but that's just a matter of taste.  I loved that it was frozen!  I don't even know why----it's just a neat twist, and it worked for us!  Very good!  Just goes to show you that some things stand the test of time very well!  Thanks to the grandma who came up with this!  UPDATE:  I kept this in the refrigerator after removing it from the freezer, and it holds its consistency very well.  Yum!
