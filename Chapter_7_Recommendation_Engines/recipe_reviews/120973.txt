Definitely a crunchy fruit salad - it kinda reminds me of a waldorf salad with the addition of the celery.  With that in mind, I used red grapes and added some raisins and walnuts to give it even more "crunch".  Overall, this was very good and if you don't like plain yogurt you could use vanilla.

This is good, but I'm still not sure I like the celery with the fruit. That's just me. I found myself leaving the celery in the bowl. I substituted pepitas for sunflower seeds as I had them on hand and used red grapes instead of green for the same reason. Very tasty recipe.
