Awesome Jerky Marinade! The flavors meld well together. Its a little sweet, a little smokey, and a little spicy. We are very discriminating and this is our family's favorite. We marinate london broil overnight and put in food dehydrator the following day.

I tried this and loved it. Actually what caught my eye, was the fact that you are from Cresent City Ca. I was born in Arcats and lived in Cresent city when I was younger. Went to Pine Grove and St. Josephs. That made me try your recipie! Celeste

Great flavor, but not perfect... Here's what I learned for next time:

1. We marinated for 24 hours, provided excellent flavor to the meat
2. Used skirt steak, worked well
3. Some of my slices were too thin-- turned out crispy and had to throw out
4. Would go for 1/3-1/2" slices, they turned out meatier and excellent
5. The recipe states to wipe off the marinade- we didn't do this, some of our pieces had a glaze on the meat that burned, I would recommend doing this for sure
6. Would go low on the smoker heat, 175ish. We smoked at 200 for 4 hours and they were done. Next time will do 175 for longer.
7. Used Applewood which was great

This was the first thing I made in my electric smoker and it was AMAZING! I sliced the meat a little too thick (rookie mistake), but it still didn't last more than 2 hours with just me eating it and I'm not even a big guy. It's not as sweet as you might think, it has just the right blend of flavors. The steak sauce is key! I used A1 and hickory wood chips, smoked at 160 degrees. I will never buy beef jerky again and am going to be making this again this weekend, I am even going to make twice the amount. This is an amazing recipe!

If you like a sweeter jerky, you might like this. I prefer a more "store-bought" jerky taste.

Great recipe. Used my Pit Boss smoker and the only change I'll make next time will be to cut back on the teriyaki sauce a bit.
