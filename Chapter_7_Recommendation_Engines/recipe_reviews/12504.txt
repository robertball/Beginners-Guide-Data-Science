I have made this recipe for years its the only pumpkin pie my family will eat now! One hint- you dont need to whip the egg whites and it turns out the same, very fluffy and raised. I have always used deep dish pie crusts, makes one very full and nice, I dont use any nuts in the crumb topping.. make sure your butter is very chilled before you start using it, also, add 2 tablespoons more flour, seems to absorb and set better. Lastly, I cover the outside of the crust with foil, it bakes so fast with this recipe, can take it off 10 minutes before its done, but I use frozen crusts, so easier and just as good to me. You really cant mess this pie up, my husband even helps make it, its so easy. ****

Fantastic, easy pie to make.  When using 9" shallow pie crusts, makes 2 pies though.

OMIGOSH!! I started making this last Thanksgiving and it quickly became my signature! My family no longer buys their pumpkin pies and my young cousins will eat the whole thing if left alone! The topping is to DIE FOR!! My husbands family (Portuguese) didn't eat pumpking pie, now they do!

This is the BEST!  Most recipes that call for canned pumpkin come out kind of squishy when you substitute fresh pumpkin.  This didn't.  Even my very picky daughter loves it!  I reduce the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon, add 1/8 teaspoon cloves and use peacans instead of walnuts (just cuz I like 'em better).  It comes out perfect every time.   THANKS!

There aren't enough stars for this pumpkin pie!  I followed the recipe exactly and added two teaspoons of vanilla extract.  Everyone raved about it!  The streusel topping is incredible and the pie itself makes a great presentation.  I served it bourbon whipped cream from this site.

Thank you for sharing this delightful recipe. I had enough pumpkin for two pies last night, so I made them. The pie was as light and smooth as can be, and the streusel topping was delicious, too. However, next time I will half the amount of streusel, as I find it to be a little too much for a pie (and it almost overcomes the nice flavor of the pumpkin filling).

I used fresh pumpkin and the results were amazing.  It's the best pumpkin pie I've ever had.
I did not, however, make the streusel top, and the pie stands on its own just fine.

Made this pie yesterday as a trial run for Thanksgiving - it was delicious. I substituted pecans for the walnuts and chopped very fine (my husband does not like nuts). He loved it! A keeper!

Oh my lord.  This pie is absolutely gorgeous.  I had people going up for thirds at our Thanksgiving lunch this weekend.  The filling is much lighter than a regular pumpkin pie and the streusal topping just gives it that extra something.  Beware though - I found that this recipe made two deep dish pies instead of one.  A good job on this occassion.

What a wonderful recipe!  I changed the streusel a little and used my crust recipe and it won best pumpkin pie at the fair.  It has a light taste and texture, not to mention how simple it was to make.

YUM!  I love this pie.  Very flavorful.  I gave half to my parents.  I don't know if they liked it but that's tough because this is the only pumpkin pie I'll be making from now on!

I have to admit, I altered the recipe quite a bit. Instead of sweetened condensed milk I used evaporated milk. Then added about a cup of white sugar and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. My family loves nutmeg and cinnamon so I doubled what was called for. I didn't use the nuts in the streusal...in fact I used all of the ingredients and mixed it too much. It came very creamy so I put it in a zip lock bag, cut a hole in the corner and covered the pie with beautiful lines of what was supposed to be streusal. I used graham cracker crust. IT TURNED OUT EXCELLENT!!! The topping made a crunchy and almost chewing addition. It was everyone's favorite at our Christmas Party. I will certainly try to make it again. I hope that I can make it like that again, I just added thing until it tasted good! Everyone wanted the recipe!

Wonderful recipe. Lives up to other raves. One guest-usually a non-sweet eater, ate second slice saying he has never had a second piece of dessert ever.
The second time I made it, having no condensed milk, did as one reviewer suggested, substituted with evaporated milk and added 1c. white sugar, and 1/2c. brown sugar - no perceivable difference.  This recipe made a 10" pie plus two - 5"pies.  Delicious.  #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada
#PumpkinCraze
Topping:Almonds, pecans or walnuts - use whatever is on hand, although it does produce a lot more than the average pie will take. Leftovers can be used on ice cream or other fruits.
Fabulous recipe, thank you. Am making it again for the fourth time in five days.

This was a delicious pumpkin pie with a twist! We followed the recipe, except doubling it (but we had extra batter left over, probably enough to make a third pie).  We ate some the first day we made it and thought it was okay but it was GREAT the second day after being refrigerated one night. Co workers loved it too!

Very good. I did not do the streusel topping, just wanted a "regular" pie. I doubled cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, because I like a spicier pie. Next time will do topping. Thank you!  Update: When writing the first review, I did as directed except I didn't separate the eggs. Didn't even see that step. Did this recipe again - this time realizing to separate the eggs, and I left spices as written. Did not like so much; much prefer first version I did. As written, not enough pumpkin taste and too bland; although the texture was fluffy.

I was a little reluctant to try this one because of the crumbly top but we loved it.  Followed the recipe to the letter.  It tasted even better the next day after the spices had more time to meld.

I've never made a pumpkin pie before, so I read ALL the reviews. I mixed all the ingredients in the blender. I omitted the ginger and added 1 tsp of vanilla and 3/4 tblspn pumpkin pie spice. For the topping you can use walnuts, pecans or almonds. Recipe will make 2 reg pies or 1 deep dish. Make a day ahead and serve with whipped cream or ice cream. Delicious!

I've never made pumpkin pie until now (or even tasted it!) I got elected to make one for a family gathering, and I'm so glad I did.  This was outstanding!  I can't wait to make it again. I used pecans instead of walnuts (family preference) and it was great.  Thank you Cindy B. for sharing!

This recipe has become my family's favorite Thanksgiving and Christmas staple.  It is a different texture, but we like it better than the traditional pumpkin pie.  The texture is whipped versus dense.  Make sure to use a deep dish pie shell; I add 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon of brandy; make sure to prepare steusel topping before putting pie in oven-there is not enough time to make streusel topping after it goes into oven.

OMG soooooo DELICIOUS!!!! You will not regret trying this recipe.  I tried this recipe for the first time about 3 years ago and have never rated it until today.  I have been making it every Thanksgiving & Christmas since then.  Everyone who tries it ends up asking me for the recipe and telling me how delicious it truly was.    Thanks to the Brown Family for such a terrific recipe & if you have any other recipes to share...keep them coming!!!!

I am not sure I understand this pie.  The topping did not seem to go with the filling.  The spice blend seemed very off and the filling was not very sweet like a pumpkin pie.  No one ate more than one piece after trying.  Not sure what was missing.

I like to "test" pies on my family so I can decide what pies to make for Thanksgiving.  My family LOVED this pie!  I used pecans instead of walnuts in the topping because that's all I had - I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and it was wonderful!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this pie a few weeks ago for my husband and some friends. I followed the recipe exactly, but used fresh pumpkin puree instead. 

I made a mistake with the streusel layer and over-mixed it, so it looked more like cinnamon-roll filling than of a crumb topping. I dropped it in spoonfuls all over the pie before I baked it. My friend said it was the best pie he'd ever eaten, and he's pretty picky. 

I made it again, this time getting the streusel right, and my husband said it was good, but not as good as my first attempt.

I am going to make it again, and really soften the butter in the streusel, almost to melting, and drop it on top of the pie and draw it through with a knife all over. I also added the spices for the pie again into the topping (to make it a little spicier).

Great pie (though I can't eat it)! This will be my standard pumpkin pie recipe from now on.

So good that my family took all of it home and left me with the plain, boring pumpking pie.  So, naturally, I had to make another to keep all to myself!  The only thing I did differently was using pecan instead of walnut.  It fit the Christmas spirit better!

This is similar to a recipe that I made 2 years ago from a Eagle Brand/Keebler Ready Crust ad in a newspaper. That recipe used a Ready Crust Graham Cracker pie crust(6oz) and the eggs are used whole(not separated and egg whites beaten) and the streusel topping is optional. That pumpkin pie was a favorite that year.
     This year, I followed this recipe and beat the egg whites and used a 9inch deep dish pie crust. It tasted very good, but I prefer not to beat the egg white because I feel that it makes the pie filling texture a little too soft. And I have never used the streusel topping in either pies and it still taste great.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!
I have made this twice and both times it came out great.  If you like an extra crunchy top double the topping amounts, it turns out great.   Also, this recipe yielded 2 pies, when in the recipe it said only one.  I'm not complaining though, that means there is one for my family and one ALL FOR ME. hehehe
Thanks Cindy!

This is the best.  Super light.  Perfect blend of the warm custardy filling and the crunchy cinnamon and walnut topping.

I've never made pumpkin pies before and never tasted one.  My roommate bought pumpkins to carve for Halloween and we were wondering if we could actually cook the meat and make pumpkin pie.  

I cut up a whole pumpkin and pass it through a food processor.  So instead of using canned puree, I used two cups of food processed raw pumpkin.  Kept most of the recipe intact.  I was liberal on the spices so I'm sure I put more than the prescribed amounts.  Oh god, it turned out amazing.  I served it with a scoop of ice cream on the side.  The warm custardy pie, crunchy top and the cold creamy ice cream just went so well together.  Yum yum...

I'm not much of a pumpkin pie eater, so I was surprised when my family RAVED over this one. I don't know if it's because of all the spices that are used or what, but they found it more flavorful, and new and different from what they're used to. I think it was the streusel topping. But from now on, I'm supposed to make ALL the pumpkin pies like this, so I guess this one's a keeper.

This is the first pumpkin pie I have ever made and it came out perfect! This recipe is easy to follow and very tasty.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg and ginger and it was still amazing.  Thanks.

This is a very hearty, filling pie.  The topping adds a very unique flavor.  Mine sunk a bit in the middle, but I may have put the topping on before it had set completely.  Delicious, though!

I have made this pie two times now and am just getting around to rating it. I am not a fan of pumpkin pie but I can eat this one. It has more of a "mousse-like" filling, not as dense as your regular pumpkin pie. I made this for my husbands work and it was a hit. I followed the recipe to a tee, all except the crust. I used a graham cracker crust and it was great! Thank you for sharing.

I didn't like the streusel topping on this at all. I had to pick all the walnuts out of it after baking because they were all burned and I didn't even leave it for as long as the recipe said. I wasn't crazy about the look of the sugar in the topping either. It wasn't a very nice crumbly texture. Maybe if I cut the topping in half and left out the nuts or even kept the nuts and put it on the pie with about 25 minutes left of baking it might have been better. I also found that there was so much of the pumpkin mixture leftover after filling the pie, (and I filled it really high) so I mixed the remaining filling with 1/2 cup of bisquick, and a big tablespoon of butter, and poured it into some greased muffin tins and cooked for 25 minutes. They were pretty good.

I LOVE this pie! I've never seen a puffed up pumpkin pie before! I'm so glad I made it, it was very easy, light, and full of flavor! I used low-fat condensed milk, and threw in pumpkin spice as well as the spices listed. I will make this again, and I can't wait I forward this recipe to my mother! Thanks Cindy!!

This was a huge hit at our Christmas dinner! I was a little worried about how the light consistency of the pumpkin portion would go over, but everyone else said they loved that about it. It's really the topping that makes the difference though. It will be on our Thanksgiving menu for sure. UPDATE: I have been making this recipe for almost 2.5 years now and I just at Christmas finally stopped buying a regular pumpkin pie in case somebody wanted it because it was never touched! From now on, I make this pie and this pie only!

I had high hopes for this pie recipe going into Thanksgiving this year. I made recipe exactly as stated but without much success on the "dessert table" end. I brought this recipe to 2 different Thanksgiving meals, labeled it "pumpkin pie" and hardly any of my family touched it. (BTW, my pumpkin pies were the ONLY pumpkin pies represented at both parties.) Out of 2 pies, I came back home with 3/4 of the pie leftover. I asked my people why I didn't succeed with such a promising, exciting recipe, and the one who did try it said, "It was good, but it didn't taste like pumpkin pie." The others said they wanted "straight up pumpkin pie without all the stuff on top." I am posting this review as a warning to all who may be tempted to try this recipe out for the "stand in" pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving: It is a good pie, BUT--it may be the pumpkin pie for people who don't really like pumpkin pie. My family, who are true pumpkin pie lovers, just wanted traditional pumpkin. I will not attempt this recipe again and will keep searching for a more traditional recipe.

WOWZA!!  This pie was AWESOME!  The Sweetened condensed milk made the pumpkin filling decadent but the topping turned the same ole pumpkin pie into a star!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I thought for sure that there was going to be too much of the streusel topping but it was just the right amount.  If you like a little crunch you are going to love this!  This is definitely going to be part of my Thanksgiving every year now!  Thanks Brown Family=)

#1 PROBLEM w/ this recipe..NOT sweet enough! This pie has great texture and a good balance of spices (it's more on the milder side than anything..but who wants a mouth full of spices anyhow?). BUT - This pie is not nearly as sweet as it should be! If you like things not as sweet and/or if you are cooking for an older crowd, I recommend this pie. If you like things sweeter and/or are cooking for a younger crowd...I definitely recommend adding 1/4cup white sugar and a 1/4 cup of light brown sugar. (most pumpkin pie recipes have around 3/4cup of sugar so you could even add more if you wanted and it would still taste great and no overly sweet...) Other than the sugar issue.... I'd say this pie is pretty darn good. And just for personal taste; I'm adding a little more cinnamon next time because the cinnamon was also a little low IMO.

EXCELLANT TWIST ON PUMPKIN PIE.  I DID PREBAKE THE PIE CRUST (LINED IT WITH FOIL AND ADDED SOME DRY BEANS FOR WEIGHT) FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES THE SECOND TIME I MADE IT AND IT MADE THE CRUST NICE AND CRISPY ON THE BOTTOM. MADE A HOMEMADE CARMEL SAUCE AND DRIZZLED IT WARM ON THE PIE WHEN I SERVED IT. ALSO SERVED IT WITH FRESH, HOMEMADE WHIPPED CREAM.

I searched and searched for a good pumpkin pie recipe when I finally decided on this one....I took it to my aunt's house for Christmas dinner in 2002...she said it was better than the pumpkin pie my grandmother used to make...i was very flattered....I now make it every year....

2009 UPDATE: still making this pie every year...i've tried others and this is still the best..i usually make it without the topping. It is fab either way...

What is going on here?  I am an experienced pie maker, and this pie in NOT going in my "favorites".  The topping WAY overpowers the pumpkin, is dry, browns (burns) way too fast, and ruins an otherwise not-so-great pie.  I followed the recipe exactly, using a deep dish pie plate.  If you're looking for a really good pumpkin pie, this is NOT it!  All reviews must be from the Brown family!  sorry.

The recipe yields a delicious pie!  Some thoughts: too much brown sugar on top makes it overly sweet, and it's better with canned pumpkin than fresh.  Don't overdo the walnuts either as they can overpower the pumpkin flavor.  I've made this many times now and don't even use the topping anymore.  The whipped egg whites make it too fluffy when it's warm or at room temperature.  Put this one in the fridge...so much better cold.

This was a delicious pie that really pleased the whole family at Thanksgiving.  Truly more delicious than the normal plain pumpkin pie.  
As one admirer said, "It's like having pumpkin pie and pecan pie all together!"(even though it was walnuts).

This is THE BEST pumpkin pie ever! I made it for a Halloween gathering, and people are still raving about it. The taste and consistency of the filling is superb, and the topping makes it a wonderful, unique dessert. I had never really liked pumpkin pie very much before trying this one. Now it's a favorite!

Used golden hubbard squash and the pie turned out light and not too sweet.  Not as dense as the typical "out of the can" pie which was nice.  The topping gave it all the sweetness it needed!

Well on behalf of my family, I give this a 5 star rating.  My dad who is SUPER picky, said it was the best pumpkin pie he has EVER had.  And I had lots of others say it was great.  I did use real pumpkin, I don't know if it changes the consistancy or what have you, but I thought the pie was quite moist.  I would like to try it with pumpkin from a can.  Considering this was my first pumpkin pie ever, and one of the first pies I've ever made, I think it turned out pretty good.  I did love the topping, and Im not a walnut fan.  Also I didn't feel that there was enough spice in the pie.  I like it really spicy to bring out the pumpkin flavour.  I even baked the pie a day before hand hoping the flavours would come out.  So I would probably add more spices.  I will definatly try this pie again!  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!Husband and kids really liked this one. This is my third time trying to find a great pumpkin pie recipe and this is it. The texture is very Mousse like. I raided my pantry to make this. I substituted Peach yogurt for the condensed milk and also used a Graham cracker crust instead of the pie crust. I used organic Pumpkin puree from trader Joe's and Cracked my own Nut blend walnuts. brazilians, etc etc. . I used others recommendations and added Vanilla extract *great idea* The sweet crunchy topping goes so well with this recipe. I am truly impressed. I served it with whipped cream and it was simply heavenly. I recommend making it the day before like any mousse ... It adds a nice spongy texture. Thanks for the recipe. We will make it again.

I made this for my husbands work pot luck where it was dubbed "nut pie". Now his co-workers request nut pie for all their gatherings.  Great recipe- my only suggestion is to cook the pie for about 10 minutes longer before adding the topping so that it will not sink to the bottom.

This pumpkin pie was THE BEST!!!  My husband is not a fan of pumpkin, but loved this pie. Even requested it for Christmas!! I made it for family thanksgiving and got rave reviews. Everyone said the topping adds a little "extra".

Couple of notes:  1. I doubled the struesel topping since I thought that would make it more yummy and cover the whole pie.  I also melted the butter for 30 seconds which helped with the topping. 2.  I didn't make the topping with nuts and it still turned out great. I don't think I will add them in the future.

THIS IS A KEEPER!!!

You know - I really liked this recipe - I love Pumpkin pie and since I'm a cooking novice and this was my first ever attempt at pumpkin pie - it worked really well and was really easy - again inhaled - you can't really screw this up.  Excellent - will definitely do again and again. 
Thanks.

Everyone went crazy over this.  My adaptations were to press some cinnamon sugar into the crust (obviously undersized crust I bought...the pie was perilously close to overflowing)...but my sons thought it was fantastic with a lot more filling than crust.  And they asked that I skip the topping, so I just sprinkled more cinnamon sugar on top before baking.

5 stars here!  Thanks!!!

This is like a pumpkin chiffon with a wonderful nutty topping. I had pecans and so I used them and it was great. I made this for Thanksgiving, and also made a plain pumpkin pie. I shouldn't have bothered, no one wanted the plain pie after tasting this one!

Awesome!  I made this for Christmas - and my entire family said they never had such a deliciously light and tasty pumpkin pie.
I've already been asked to make it again!
Quite easy and tasty.  A fabulous twist on an old holiday original!

This is by far the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten!  The pie was so good that I made two and my family was fighting over who could take the couple pieces left over home with them!!  I did also make the struessel topping and must say it made the pie extraordinary!  You could eat the struessel by itself, but on top of the pumpkin pie...yum yum...crunchy and creamy.  Thank you Cindy B. for sharing this wonderful recipe, it will definately be on my holiday table next year as well!!

Same traditional pumpkin pie flavor, but a little fluffier and the topping is a really nice touch.  Made this for Thanksgiving and was really pleased.  Will make it again.

This is my favorite recipe for pumpkin pie! I used fat free condensed milk and pumpkin pie spice. I also did not separate the eggs and it came out fine. Best looking pie I have ever made.

I added a spoonful (maybe 1-2 tablespoons) of Neufschatel cheese and cut the streudel to 1/4 the recipe but otherwise did this pretty much exactly according to the recipe. It was wonderful.

The struesel topping is a nice alternative, though not all may appreciate it.  A good pie, but nothing to knock our socks off.

I have made this for three holiday seasons running to rave reviews.  I use pecans rather than walnuts, Trader Joe's pie crust, Libby's pumpkin, and regular sweetened and condensed milk.  When I have deviated of these ingredients it hasn't been quite as tasty.

I just have to say that I made this pie this morning and entered it into my parish's pie baking contest.  I never got to try it because it won first prize and nothing was left of it when I went to collect my pie!   I'll have to make it again. I made it exactly as it is written ( except I didn't have any ground ginger so I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of the cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg) and it made one beautiful 9inch deep dish pie.  It looked lovely.

This pumpkin pie is amazing! I used a 10 oz (300 mL) can of condensed milk because that is the only size i could find in the store and this came out perfect! and i used pecans because i had an abundance on hand. I did have to bake at 350 for closer to 50 minutes for the pie to set. This was a delicious pumpkin pie! This is definitely our 'go-to' pie for the holidays from now on

Great recipe... it took a bit to make since we did it from scratch but it was definitely worth it!! we did add more cinnamon and nutmeg than indicated since it brings out the pumpkin flavour and the TOPPING is absolutely worth it!!! again thanks for sharing!

This is the BEST pumpkin pie I've ever had. Super easy to make. I made a few changes but not much. I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. SO GOOD and makes a big difference. I used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and added 1/2 c. brown sugar. I did not separate the eggs (too lazy). I beat them in a bowl w/ a whisk then added the condensed milk, mixed, then added that to the pumpkin. Baked my crust for 6 mins first then filled it. I covered the crust w/ foil after 15 mins to prevent burning. Worked great! This time I chose not to add the topping because I know my husband will not eat it, but I'm sure it would just make this pie even better, if that's even possible. This is a keeper!

BIG hit with the family! Instead of separating the eggs, I just mixed everything together. I also cut out the nutmeg and ginger and added two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla as well. Came out perfect! Remember to bake the pie crust before adding the filling for about 10 minutes so the bottom doesn't come out soggy and wrap the crust with foil when baking the pie. LOVED the streusel topping; I made it both with walnuts and pecans and both turned out excellent!

This pie is wonderful.  So quick and easy to make.  It's light and has just the right amount of sweetness.  The only change that I made was omitting the nutmeg (didn't have any) and I added some cloves to give it the flavor of my usual pumpkin pie.  I used a regular 9" pie plate and had difficulty adding the nut topping.  It kept rolling off the rounded top of the filling so a deep dish plate would be a better choice. I think that the nut topping sets it off nicely as a notch above the average pie.  Just be careful not to burn the crust.  I covered the whole top with fold about 15 minutes before it was finished. I will be serving this for my Christmas dinner.

This recipe makes THE BEST PUMPKIN PIE!!  EVER! This is my first time making a pumpkin pie.  I followed the directions exactly as stated (except I omitted the streusel topping) and it turned out to be the most delicious pumpkin pie i've ever tasted and it was easy to make!  It came out looking gorgeous as if it came from one of the high-end bakeries.  It wasn't too sweet, just perfectly sweetened and the pumpkin pie spice was just right.  Texture was light and fluffy.  This will be my first and only pumpkin pie recipe that I will ever use.  Thank you Carol A.!!!!

A wonderful pumpkin pie! I used fresh pumpkin puree, as I cannot find the canned here in Thailand.  I did NOT add the walnut topping-it was still great.  Shall add that special topping for a Thanksgiving treat.

I agree with another reviewer that said this pie was "blah." It was ok but really was missing all the yummy spicy favor of traditional pumpkin pie. I made this pie and the traditional Libby's pie and tasted them side by side. The Libby's pie was far better in taste. Just look for the recipe on the back on the can.

AWESOME!!!  My family loved this recipe.  I guess I'd fallen into the rut of making "tradition" pumpkin pie, and was anxious for a change when I found this one.  I didn't whip the whites as other reviewers hadn't; I don't feel it altered the texture  Also omitted the ginger (as a personal choice).  Fantastic all the way through.  Didn't last long and this was just a trial run before Thanksgiving...it WILL be made again for the holiday!

I have to agree with everyone else regarding this recipe, it is excellant. I added 1/4 t cloves because I love them in anything sweet, and used pecans in stead of walnuts for the topping. It was a great and easy pie with -never fail pie crust II- from this site.

YUM. I made 2 pies out of it with frozen pie shells, and the topping made it go pretty much to the crust. Next time though, I'll make a deep dish pie crust and just fill it up, and maybe put topping on one half of it, just because although it was yummy, I do enjoy just the pumpkin, without any added stuff. Will definitely use this pumpkin pie recipe from now on!

I forgot to turn the oven from 425 to 350. Thank goodness I caught it in time but the streusel still burnt just a bit. It was still a good pumpkin pie though.

pretty good...not sure what all the fuss is about. hubby and i thought it was bland. the nut crumble (which i used pecans rather than walnuts) on top is a major part of the taste. i'm making it again this weekend for canadian thanksgiving and i'm going to up the spices and add vanilla and sugar.

the best pumpkin pie ever! I substituted the pumpkin puree and used pumpkin pie puree instead, thus not adding the nutmeg. I still used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. also didn't have sweetened condensed milk, so followed previous reviews, and used 1 can evaporated milk, 1 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. turned out absolutely AMAZING. though using the substitute results in like around 2 cups of leftover pie filling with one 9" deep dish pan. also cover the crust with foil to prevent it from burning. :)  you can also forgo the streusel and melt dark chocolate and drizzel on top. an amazing combination!

I will say this pie was alright. I definitely prefer the traditional, dense pumpkin pie to this airy/soufflé type. I (stupidly) used a generic condensed milk... BAD idea, the pie part tastes like condensed milk with a little pumpkin added in. 

The topping was nice for nut lovers. Next time I think I will use a traditional, dense pumpkin pie recipe, then use the topping for it... but I think the walnuts or pecans need to be chopped super finely.

I have used this recipe for several years and it gets rave reviews every time!  I do use Fat Free Sweetened Condensed Milk to cut down fat, 2 cups of fresh Pumpkin Puree rather than canned, and I ground a cinnamon stick in a coffee bean grinder for better flavor. This recipe is excellent with or without the streusel topping. For some added nutrition, I have also added Flax Seeds to the Pumpkin Puree; however, if doing this, then I cut back on the streusal topping since flax seeds add a nutty flavor.

I used fresh pumpkin that I baked and pureed because, in Venezuela where I am living, there is no canned pumpkin.  The pie was lighter in color than what I would expect but the taste was perfect.  Light, fluffy, and not as dense as original pumpkin pies, but just as sweet and yummy!  I did find that I had to cook it for an extra 25 minutes or so in order for it to set.

This was an awesome recipe!  Everyone loved it. I would give it ten (10) Stars if I could.  I was unable to find a prepared pie pan at the store due to the Holiday, therefore, I used Pillsbury Pie Dough found in the dairy section and rolled onto a glass pie plate.  Worked well!

WOW! This was yummy!I made this for my b/f and he was very happy! I'm not usually a pumkin pie fan and I even loved it. I did add 1/3 Cup of sugar to sweeten it and it was great. The topping is definitely great too. I might reccommend using a pie shell that is bigger than 9 inch. I think the stores have a slightly bigger pie shell that would be better b/c there is more filling than needed. ENJOY! Thanks!

I've made this recipe several times now (without the topping) I usually add a tsp of vanilla. I also foung the temperature to be too strong...the edges get a bit burned. So I usually start at 400 for 15min, then reduce it to 325 for 35-40min.  It's everyone's fave!

I made this pie without the topping, and this was my first attempt at making a pumpkin pie.  This pie tasted really great even though I did not have ground ginger on hand.  It had just the right amount of sweetness and was refreshingly light, not dense.  I would rate it a 5 except that the pie came out looking like a monster, and the random pockets of custard (whipped egg whites) are really odd.  The reason this pie looked so awful for me was because of two things.  I made the mistake of using a shallow pie crust, so the filling almost overflowed.  I also folded the whipped egg whites as specified, but the whipped egg whites didn't settle, so the pie had weird bulges on top that burned while baking.  So the burned bulges on top of the pie made it look horrible, but it still tasted very good.  I think next time, I will whip the egg whites less and actually mix it into the pumpkin filling so everything is smooth and consistent.

I made this today in the qwest to find a pumpkin pie recipe that is great before thanksgiving.  I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.  It was okay,  I made it Per the recipe.  Hubby who loves everything did not like topping.  My six year old liked it.  I thought it was good but not good enough that warrented seperation of eggs.  The qwest goes on.  Thanks anyway.

Pumpkin filling has a nice blend of spices, very smooth, fluffy, and tasty.  I also halved the added toppings, but I think I might leave it out altogether next time.  Walnuts add a nice texture, but makes it a bit too rich.  Especially good with 'basic flaky pie crust'

Everyone seemed to like it.  Maybe I just don't like pumpkin pie but it wasn't my kind of dessert! Probably b/c it wasn't chocolate! :) I baked it for 30 mins after sprinkling on the topping and it was plenty!!!!!  Watch the time in the oven.  I thought the spices were too strong but if you like cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin type spices you'd like this pie :)

I've never been a big fan of pumpkin pie. But with Halloween and Thanksgiving I find myself fumbling around the kitchen making them. This pie I enjoy making AND eating. My kids love the streusel topping.I even let them help making that part of the pie.  Great recipe!!

This is absolutely the best pumpkin pies recipe!  The only ting I did different was used organic pumpkin from a jar, a wheat crust, non-fat condensed milk, and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I brought this pie into my school and everybody wanted the recipe!  I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving.

I made this a few weeks ago with kids at school and ended up making another three pies to keep the staffroom quiet! Its superb!!!.

I subbed the walnuts for toasted sesame seeds and its a nice combo. Also, have successfully swapped the condensed milk for a homemade cornstarch,light vanilla custard (1 egg) made to same consistancy as the condensed milk. Its less sweet and slightly lighter in texture.

However just as it is its still gorgeous.

Absolutely wonderful pumpkin pie!! The only thing I would change would be to use the food processor for the streusel, I like my nuts finer that what I got by hand chopping. My husband doesn't like pumpkin anything...so, more pie for me! YUM!

I used this recipe for thanksgiving and it came out great.  I reduced the walnuts to about 1/3 cup, as I'm not a big fan of walnuts.  My boyfriend was concerned the pie wasn't cooked thoroughly, as the color was a pale orange.  But he quickly changed his mind after one bite!

got rave reviews from many lucky recipients of this pie.  one time I substituted pecans for the walnuts and it was just as good, if not better, than with walnuts.  even better with fresh pumpkin puree.

DELICIOUS! Wow! I have been to several friends houses to sample their pumpkin pies, but I think I will have to start inviting a few of my own friends to come over and sample this one! I think the condensed milk as the sugar really helped the texture and consistency of the pie. It was extremely smooth, and had just the right amount of sweetness. you could even see the work of the condensed milk because the color of the pie wasn't the usual deep orange. it was more of a paler orange. My family loved it and this recipe is definitely going to be used!

Hated it. I followed the recipe to the letter but the pie was soggy and had absolutely no consistency.

Great recipe!! I used a glass pie plate so it was perfect for one pie. I didn't have any walnuts so I used pecans and it was perfect. I baked a little longer and it was perfect.

This recipe is amazing. Be sure to use SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK. I almost made the mistake of buying the standard evaporated milk and I think that is why some of the people are rating it low because their comments are that it is not sweet enough. Trust me if you use the RIGHT ingredients it's plenty sweet!

Delicious. I used a deep dish frozen crust (it was very full!) and covered the outside crust with foil while cooking, which seemed to keep the edges from burning.  I increased the spices (ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon) as others suggested for a slightly spicier pie. I really loved this pie.

This filled two pies for me.  Since I had two pies, I doubled the topping and it ended up more as an additional layer than a sprinkling.  I'd like to try this without the topping next time.

Awesome! and I'm not the biggest pumpkin pie fan.  I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and it was great, added some cloves, didn't separate the eggs, and used a gingersnap crust: 1/4 cup butter with crushed ginger snaps, threw some in the topping with pecans.

I followed the recipe for a family dinner & omitted the streusel. My mom's review (in email form):
Good morning;
That was the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten. And I've eaten alot of pumpkin pie in 54 years.  Would you consider making the same for Thanksgiving, please??
love,
Mom

I make this pie ALL the time and I love it! I've never tried the walnut topping and I think it's just fine without. Also, I don't separate the egg yolks from the whites so I don't think it makes a difference. Very easy pie to make and very yummy!

Amazing! I was skeptical about the condensed milk, but it's not too sweet. The meringue makes it light and delish! Add 1/4 teaspoon cloves to enhance the holiday spice factor.

OH MY GOD haha

I made this in a cast iron skillet with zero effort and eyeballed every single ingredient and it came out tasting so incredible! 

I used the All Recipes "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" by stephanie and made sure to put my bowl and dough cutter, and later the dough before rolling into the freezer. The colder the ingredients the flakier the crust!

Absolutely the best pumpkin pie I've ever made. Followed the recipe as printed but did add a little extra of all the spices as someone else had suggested.  Fabulous!  Compliments from all who tasted it.  This will be my only pumpkin pie recipe from now on.  Thanks.

This has become my ONLY pumpkin pie recipe! The only change I make is I substitute pecans for the walnuts and increase the topping! I have made this recipe at least 6 times and get rave reviews from everyone! I don't usually like pumpkin pie and even I like it. I made 6 of these last Christmas for dinner at the homeless shelter, There were tears from some ot the clients! Because they were sure I had slaved to make them these pies and couldn't believe I had wen't to the effort for them! At Thankgiving (Canadian) I of course had to repeat this. This has become my tradition both at home and at work!

Excellent recipe!!! I have made it two times now, Thanksgiving and Christmas and everyone has loved it!!! I added more of the spices and a splash of vanilla too. I also used a prepared frozen crust and tasted great all together. Very original with the streusel topping.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was okay.  I added extra spices as some reviewers did but it still did not have enough of a spicy flavor to it.  Also, the pie was not very pumpkin-y.  I think I'll stick with the Libby's recipe on the can.

Beware: the recipe calls for SWEETENED condensed milk. We had regular condensed milk on hand, and used that without adding any sugar, and the pumpkin part came out extremely bland. I would have rated this pie a 1-2 based on our experience, but I guess it wasn't their fault that we didn't use any sugar. The topping was pretty decent but there were a lot of nuts.

This was pretty straightforward. This was the first time I whipped egg whites and had them actually whip up firm. I did chill my Kitchen Aid bowl, whip and I kept my egg whites in the fridge until go time. I did add a little ground cloves, a capful of vanilla extract and used pecans instead of walnuts. I don't know what whipping the egg whites does, I did had a fluffy high pie until an hour after bake time. Then, it fell. I might skip that step next time and see if it REALLY makes a difference. This might be really good with a touch of maple flavoring in the pumpkin mixture. I also might take another reviewers advice and add just a little more flour to the topping. This is a very pretty pie and really not all that difficult to make. I'd make this again, with a few changes.

First time making pumpkin pie from scratch (for whole family for Thanksgiving no less) and this was fantastic!!! My Mom told me it was even better than hers (a huge compliment) and asked me for the recipe :) The only thing i 'changed' was the amount of condensed milk, since the only available can size would have had me using 1.3333 cans...and try to measure that in condensed milk! but it worked out great using only one can! Doubled the recipe to make 2 pies and had a bit leftover which i just made into a couple pumpkin filling muffins.  Awesome recipe! thanks so much for sharing!! :)

Great recipe! Perfect amount for 1 deep dish pie. I would probably wait 5 or 10 minutes after putting the pie in @ 350 before I put the streusel on because it did get just a  bit too brown. Make sure you cover the edges of your pie crust also because those will burn quickly with this recipe! Other than that it was beautiful,easy and delicious! Will make again! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Was looking for something a bit different from the usual pumpkin pie, and this delivered!  The pie is so light and fluffy and delicious, and the topping added such taste and texture.  Fantastic!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving instead of my traditional pumpkin pie and everyone enjoyed it.  I was very happy with it, but really I like anything with pumpkin in it so I knew I would like it.  I followed the recipe exactly and I love the consistency of the pie and it wasn't too sweet, the topping was perfect.  It's a very pretty pie, looks wonderful.  I will make it again, thanks for the recipe!

This was very good!  I didn't have any sweetned condensed milk so I made some from scratch and only had vanilla milk powder so the condensed milk was more flavorfull and it really added a rich taste to the pie.  Because I had some vanilla in there, I added more pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon, and about 3 TBS of PURE maple syrup (give or take).  This was a big hit as soon as I brought it to the command potluck today...it was on the table for 5 minutes and all but 3 pieces were gone!!  Thank you so much!

I made this pie without the walnut topping, but I really liked how soft and light the pie filling came out, not denser like I'm used to seeing in store-bought pies and stuff - I'm guessing it's from beating the egg whites separately before folding them in with the rest of the ingredients? On the other hand, I personally think there's too much ginger, so I'll have to experiment more with the spice ratios next time, but this is a good, easy recipe.

Ridiculous topping! It was too moist as I was making it and so sticky and moist as I was putting it on and after baking, it's hard! Who puts toppings on pumpkin pies anyway?!?
Good pie though...not sure if the cooking time is long enough.

Very good.  My only change would be that next time I will melt butter to add to the topping.  I don't like a powdery topping.  My husband raved on this though and though it was better than traditional pumpkin pie.

This pie was fabulous.  My boyfriend who LOVES pumpkin pie said it was the best he had ever had (and he's hard to please).  I sent one over to his parents as well and was praised for it.  Thank you for making me look good!!! Just wanted to add a note: the batter looked really thin and looked like WAAAAYYYY too much sweetened condensed milk at first that I thought I ruined it... but it eventually mixed well and turned out just fine.  So if anyone has the same reaction... don't worry, it will be just fine!!

The beaten egg whites folded into the custard mix in this recipe make the pumpkin pie more like a pumpkin mousse then a pumpkin custard -- which I happen to think is FABULOUS! Great recipe and really easy!

By far the best pie recipe I've tried! Everyone had seconds and I managed to impress my future mother in law- she's a great cook but she's been begging my fiancee to get the recipe from me! My mom has also decided to change pie recipes from the one she's been using for years, to start using this one. Thanks for sharing!

As is, I did not enjoy the pie.  I should have followed all the suggestions for more sugar, salt, and spices.  I don't care for super-spicy pumpkin pie, but this had very little spice taste at all...leaving the pie to be a squash pie...one that needed sugar.  I will make again adding in sugar, salt, vanilla and spices.

Fantastic!  Everyone loved the pie!!  Even people who said they normally dont like pumpkin pie, said this was the best they ever had!  I took suggestions from others&some of my own... added 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar and added 1 tsp vanilla, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, next time will make it an addtl 1 tsp cinnamon, didnt separate eggs, just put the two eggs in with all the other ingredients and mixed it up! Used only 1/4 tsp salt and I used 1/2 cup pecans and was the perfect amount!
Next time, I'll cut the ginger and nutmeg to only 1/4 tsp each, I like to taste cinnamon more than spices, but thats a preference!  I used Pillsbury deep dish frozen pie crust and cooked the night before. let sit for a couple hours then covered and refriged till I took the next day.  Left out till after dinner and the pie crust stuck a bit...next time I'll leave refriged till ready to eat.  MMMMM... good, wish I had some now to eat!  Enjoy!!

This is the second Thanksgiving dinner I have served this lovely pie at. My son asked me if I was going to make "that pie" again (12 yr. old). My adult daughter make a face when she heard the pie was going to be pumpkin but tried this one and was picking crumbs from her plate. I used Bakers Secret Pie Crust from this site and it was perfect. Thanks so much for sharing.

absolutely delicious..I really think that the topping sets this pumpkin pie apart.  I halfed the topping and replaced the walnuts with pecans.  I added a little more cinnamon and 1 tablespoon flour to the batter.

UPDATE: I made this pie again yesterday (yes, pumpkin pie in the middle of August) and it was gone in less than 24 hours.  I didn't have any sweetened condensed milk so I simmered 1/3 cup of evaporated milk with 1 cup brown sugar and 2 tbs. butter and added that to the batter instead.  PERFECT pumpkin pie!

I took a chance and made this for Thanksgiving instead of my standard recipe.  We had over 20 guests and I made two pies.  I had 1 1/2 pie left.  This was bland and definately not a hit!!  I will return to my old recipe.

I can eat one slice of a traditional pumpkin pie then the craving is sated and the next day slime factor usually ends up with the rest of the pie in the trash.  This recipe shouldn't wait around for the holidays.  The texture and  topping are what have  been missing from traditional pumpkin pies all along.

This was a huge hit with my family.  My mother-in-law said it was the best pumpkin pie she'd ever had.  We like to top it with fresh whipping cream.  I made it with the topping and without (for my children who prefer no nuts).  Excellent recipe!!!!!

Pretty good....easy to make, presentation was great....but I think  I like the old fashioned pumpkin pie better. Great twist with the strussel topping. Flavor was all there...maybe it was the texture of the pie that I thought was off...kinda airy and souffle like. Still tasty though.

I made the Brown Family's Pie along with my usual pumpkin pie recipe (on the back of the Libby Pumpkin can) on Thanksgiving for my very large extended family. Brown's pie was quite a bit lighter and fluffier and with the walnut top it looked absolutely beautiful.  Some liked the airy texture but other pumpkin-pie-purists didn't.  I thought that the topping was excellent!  It may not be the pie to please everyone, but it was very good.

My family liked this, the streusel topping was really yummy and a nice change.  The whipped egg whites did make the pie's texture a little lighter, but I think I like the standard custardy texture a little better.  A great recipe to try, I'll definitely make it again!

My husband says this is the best!!  I didn't put in walnuts because of allergies, and so I added a extra 1/4 cup of flour to the struesel. I did find that the entire amount of struesel was too much.  I only used half.
It was perfect, the only pumpkin pie I will ever make!!! I love the fact that it's not real heavy and dense and that you don't have to measure sugar and milk.

This was sort of like a pumpkin cloud,  which some people will just love.  We served it with whipping cream,  and many of our guests really enjoyed it. In the future though,  I will probably stick to a more heavy, traditional pie.

Wow!   I usually don't like pumpkin pie, but this was tasty!  I decided to try this with the scraps from the kid's Halloween pumpkin carving.  Everything I read online said I would be disappointed using a jack-o-lantern pumkin, but not with this recipe!  Thus, I used fresh pumpkin, which I steamed and pureed.  The only other change I made was using slivered almonds instead of walnumts, only because that's what I had.  Thanks Brown Family for giving a new holiday favorite to our family!

Awesome recipe.  Made it twice--once with struesel topping and one without.  My husband liked the topping, but I really didn't care for it.  We both agreed it was great without it.  I used my Easy Decorator from Pampered Chef and piped a decorative cool whip top on the palin one.  Will use agian--very easy and bakes up nicely.  ;-)

Ok, I threw away this recipe after I first made it. The whole family agreed that it was not good. It was too foamy from being whipped up and the pumpkin taste was not there. It did look pretty though. When I went to dispse of it the next day, I gave it another taste. It was sooo good!!! I couldn't believe it was the same pie. The flavors blended well and it had settled and really tasted good. If I made it again, I don't think I would take the time to whip the egg whites.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving this year, and it was the first time I cooked a pumpkin pie, but it was DELICIOUS!!!  It was by far the best pumpkin pie my family had ever tasted!  My dad, who normally doesn't like pumpkin pie, said it was the best he had ever had.

This is 2nd year that I have made this pie and everyone is raving about it and requesting it.  People who have never liked pumpkin pie like this one.  I add 1/4 tsp cloves to it as well and tastes wonderful.

Instead of all the spices i used 3/4 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I forgot to separate the egg yolks from the whites, I will try it next time along with the streusel topping.

This was my first attempt at making a Pumpkin Pie and it was a huge success.  I don't like ginger so I used less of it but it still turned out yummy.  I will definitely be making this again.  I think next time I'm going to be a bit adventureous and try and make the crust from stratch!  Thanks for such an easy recipe!

I like this the way it is.  I also found pressing flaked coconut into the crust adds to the pie even more.  This is the best I have ever had.  It has spread through the neighborhood via me. =) Thanks.

I had two pie pumpkins with no recipe. I went on the internet and found all recipes.com. This recipe sounded good. So I made the pumpkin pie, for a new years eve party. Out of all the deserts, Mine was the only one totally gone. I am not a baker(my trash can loved me)But I had people telling me that this was the best pie they had ever eaten.  
Thanks for sharing your recipe!

My husband made this pie for Thanksgiving - it was absolutely fabulous.  We brought it to two different family dinners, and it received rave reviews from everyone. I think people were eager to try something a little different from the norm. Delicious and easy recipe! Thanks Cindy!

Wow!!! This is undoubtably the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. The topping was absolutely delicious. Next time I might even add some more topping since it was so delicious. The topping cooks pretty quickly, so you have to be careful that it doesn't burn. Next time, I'd proabably wait 20 minutes (instead of 15) before I put the topping on.

very good and light but a little labor intensive with the egg whites. Still, good enough to make again. I'll use 1/2 the topping next time. It was a little much for us.

This was an awesome pumpkin pie!! Very light tasting, yet sweet because of the topping. I only added about half of the topping (just enough to completely cover the top), felt it was quite enough, it would have been too sweet with more. 

I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone couldn't stop raving about it!

What a great classic with a twist.  It was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner, I should've made a couple more!  The topping was great but I didn't use it all because too much of it would've made the pie too rich and take away from the light pumpkin taste, so I just used enough to cover.  DELICIOUS!  Will make it again next year!

My family was a little sceptical of trying a pumpking pie with "a crusty top" but soon gave over to "ohs and ahs" after digging in.  Perfect for the holidays!

Great pie.  I wasn't crazy about the streusel topping, but the pumpkin pie itself was wonderful and easy to prepare.

The pie itself taste great and the topping turned out pretty good-think I cooked it a little to long though. It is a great twist to the ordinary pumpkin pie.

I agree with everyone. This pie was the best. Eerone loved the struesel topping, but I used pecans. This pie and a can of whipped cream is all you need.

This is a great alternative to traditional pumpkin pie!  My fiance and I both loved it!  The topping gave it a crunchiness that we liked very much.  It wasn't complicated either.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  For the crust, I used the "Baker's Secret Pie Crust" submitted by Carole Rhodus which is excellent.

Excellent, it was a hit for Thanksgiving.  I made a
double portion, used the Walnut topping on one and left the other plain.  (I find our children tend to not like anything out of the ordinary.)  However, for those who love nuts -- this is top rate.  It was quick, easy, not too expensive to do.  My daughter (8 y/o) did most of it by herself.  She was very proud of her Pumpkin Pies.

This was a nice change of pace from regular pumpkin pie.  Very light and airy so good, but hard to get used to.  I will probably make it again sometime.

I really liked this pie.  It's got a lighter, more moist texture than most pumpkin pies (thanks to the whipped egg whites).  I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk and it turned out great and just a little healthier than your average pie!

This pie is light and delicious!  The steusel topping adds a little crunch and a lot of flavor.  I used fat free sweetened condensed milk without any problem.

This is a great recipe.  We did not make the topping, but the pumpkin pie filling was absolutely amazing.  Combined with a homemade pie crust, this is a definite keeper.

This recipe for what should be plain old pumpkin pie is "spiced up" a bit with the sweet walnut topping. My fiance loved it so much, he just ate it straight out of the pan!

Very good if you want a strudel-type pie.  Whipping the eggs probably doesn't make enough of a difference to bother with.

This pie was delicious! It's very sweet, so it's not for the dessert faint of heart. I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe from here. I cut up the remaining pie after we had eaten some slices into pumpkin pie bites for my fiancee's office. They were a hit in that form, too!

Very easy..a little nervous once it came out of the oven.it was all puffed up but settled as it cooled..the topping just takes pumpkin pie to a whole new level. Don't forget fresh whipped cream!!

I'm not sure about this one.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using fresh pumpkin and not putting on the streusel topping.  The spices are off, somehow.  Maybe too much nutmeg.  I'll probably keep looking for THE recipe.

This is the very most AMAZING pumpkin pie ever. The whipped egg whites make the difference.  The topping (which I've made with both walnuts and pecans)makes it just that much better.

My whole family loves this. No other pumpkin pie recipe will do.

I don't like pumpkin pie but I have to admit, this one changed my mind forever!!! This is incredible. The topping only added to the wonderful flavor and texture. I made it for my son for Fathers Day because he doesn't like cake or cookies. I can never thank him enough for his choice. So happy I found this recipe! I followed the recipe to a "T", except we also used pecans instead of the walnuts. The recipe also made 2 9" inch deep dish pies so we were able to share the goodness with a friend. Thank you Brown family, for sharing.

Made this pie (finally, it's been in my recipe box for over a year!) for Christmas dinner and party at a good friends house today I really like the flavor. I do like traditional pumpkin pie but this is just a little step above. I'll make this one again but will still like the Libby's recipe for a real basic pie! I did double the spice per one reviewer. I doubled the recipe for two big deep dish pies, so when I doubled the spices, I used "rounded" measuring spoons. That worked fine. I also doubled the topping and used it all but about 1/4 cup. There again, when I doubled the topping, it should have been 4TBS of flour but used 8TBS per another review. Cut very cold butter into the flour/spices. I used pecans rather than walnuts just because I like them better! I did not add the nuts to the topping mixture but sprinkled them on top of the topping mixture after it was divided between the two pies. I had chopped 2 cups of pecans but stopped after putting about 1/2 cup on each pie. Just looked like it was more than enough. Again, great recipe!

I made mini tarts for Thanksgiving last night with this recipe, because most of my family doesn't like pumpkin pie. But boy, they loved this recipe. They woke up this morning wanting to eat them for breakfast. Unreal, this is now my pumpkin pie recipe for good. Thank you.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. It is so delicious!!! More effortful than a regular pumpkin pie but it's so special that it's worth it. I halved the recipe for the filling to make a standard 9" pie, used my own pie crust recipe, and left the measurements for the topping intact (did not halve them). Even the pumpkin pie haters loved this and my family ate half the pie in one sitting.

So good you don't need cool whip!!!
I can't eat pumpkin pie without cool whip and this pie is really yummy that you can go with out or add it and make it even more special!!
What makes this pie so special is the brown sugar/walnut topping and adding sweetened condensed milk to the pumpkin filling.  You can not go wrong with this pie.  Make it every year for Thanksgiving!

I just made a test pie for thanksgiving, and wow! Per other suggestions, I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and added spices, including cloves, to taste.
Otherwise, I folowed the directions exactly, and my husband, as well as the guys at the deli across the street are quite happy!  I can't wait to make it in a few days!

Excellent! I just made it tonight and followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. Set beautifully and the streusel topping does give it that little bit extra. Served it with whipped cream.

I made this pie today for the first time the only problem i had was i made the puree my self right before hand and it left me with an awkward amount of pumpkin puree and i had to eyeball 14 oz and i think i added way too much and the filling looked too soupy  so i added two extra eggs the pie turned out delish !(i was worried it was going to be like a pumpkin pie omelet)

TOO Sweet and I like sweets!  I followed it exactly as a dry run for Thanksgiving. It came out looking lovely, it cut well, crust was not too brown, etc. But yikes, it's quite the sugar bomb!  Next time I will cut back the sugar in the topping.  I'll try it again cause it's so pretty and the inside of the pie was good.

Excellent.  I'm usually not a big pumpkin pie fan, but the crunchy topping made this pie better than just pumpkin pie.  I've added this to my recipe binder.

Very light and so easy to make .  I, too, like another reviewer, will cut the streusel topping in half because it's too sweet and takes away from the really great pumpkin pie flavor.

I am not a huge fan of pumpkin pie so when given other options I take those.  I didn't even get a chance to taste this since everyone else loved it.  I used the basic flaky crust recipe from this site, which is now my only crust recipe I use. :)

My husband really liked this pumpkin pie and I received compliments from other family members as well.  I left out the walnuts in the streusel due to a family member's nut allergy.

We really, really enjoyed this pie.  Other than adding some ground cloves, I changed nothing.  I did skip the topping because I wanted pure pumpkin taste.  Will make again for sure.

This recipe is always a winner.  I have tried others but always keep coming back to this.  Also, whipping the egg whites gives a MUCH better result.  I wouldn't recommend skipping that step!

this was excellent,used the pie receipe from the libby's can, but left out all the spices except cinnamon and added  some kalua instead of vanila. forgot to put in two tablespoons of flour, which I thot was a good thing, because the topping (I used pecans instead of the walnuts, much better)wasn't as died out or as hard, because the nuts help to absorb the butter you don't need the flour. baked for 1 hour ten minutes without crust burning.I did it  a little longer because you pull the pie out of the oven to put the topping on with the timmer still running, and with the topping on, it needs a little more time to cook the pumpkin.and yes it does get better the longer it sits, best pumpkin pie I have ever tasted

It was pretty good. I did like that it was very pumpkiny and not terribly sweet. I am going to add some cloves next time to bump up the spice. It was a very nice and fluffy pie and not dense like most. I didn't add the streusel.

This pie came out very tasty, even without the streusel topping. The only reason I'm giving this four instead of five stars is that, the pie was very good, but lacked that little something to make it just perfect. I think adding 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves would be the perfect touch to make this a five-star recipe.

I didn't have any brown sugar so i left off the topping. But my goodness, this pie needs NOTHING! I used a little more spices than the average joe, but I prefer a very flavorful pie. Even my roommate, who doesn't like pumpkin loved it! It was *almost* too much for a deep-dish pie crust, and the filling's almost an inch higher than the crust but its so light and fluffy that its not overwhelming.   Mine did take 20 minutes longer than the suggested 40 minutes and I did have to tent the edges with foil to keep them from burning before the middle was finished, but with results like this who could complain?

I made this recipe for a family dinner and nobody liked it. There are way too many nuts which totally overwhelm any pumpkin taste. The part without the nuts was pretty good, so I still gave it 2 stars but I wouldn't make it again.

This has been a favorite of mine for years and is now a staple in our house during the holidays. The only difference with mine is I use fresh pumpkin rather than canned.

My husband said to give it 3 stars...then the next day he said it was much better. It must have been because he took the week to eat the entire pie by himself. I thought it was good too and I don't even care for pumpkin pie. I'll be making this next year.

My husband insisted that I rate/review this recipe.  He said it was the best pumpkin pie he ever had.  He usually goes for the apple pies but he turned his nose up at it after tasting the pumpkin.  Yummy!

I'm giving this a 4 because I didn't add the toping so I can't really rate the full recipe. I did love this recipe though, nice light flavour. I used fresh pumpkin puree. Next time I might add a little more spices though but it was great. My egg whites for whatever reason didn't want to stiffen up but it still turned out nice and fluffy. For those who want to make small pies, for me it made 7.

I did not separate the yolks from the egg whites. Instead, I just mixed in two whole eggs. Also, I used a graham cracker crust instead of a pie shell. In addition, I chose not to make the streusel topping. The pie is delicious on its own. I'll most certainly be using this recipe again around Thanksgiving!

I did not change many things on this recipe and happy about it. With Wondra flour being so fine, I increased it to 4 tablespoons for the topping and the only nuts on hand were pecans. I cannot imagine walnuts giving the same aromatic taste and plan to use pecans on the best pumpkin pie ev-ver.

I added a lot more spice than the recipe called for, including clove and a little vanilla (just my preference for flavor - the taste is a little light and mild for my taste without the extra spices), and it turned out fantastic!  I've made this pie a couple times now, and it's gotten a lot of compliments.

My wife and I both loved this pie.  I have always enjoyed "traditional" thick, custard-type, pumpkin pies. This pie has a much lighter texture.  Combined with the crunchy topping, it is a real winner.  We are making it again tonight - this time to serve at Thanksgiving dinner!

This recipe turned out fantastic.  I'm a big fan of pine nuts (pignolias) and used them instead.  What a fantastic flavor!  One taste-tester said it looked and tasted like a pie from a professional bakery.

Great recipe. This is the first pie I have ever made and it was very easy. I improvised a little bit here and there with brown sugar and spices as I was mixing the filling. Very easy to adjust it to your taste! The quantity of pie filling is way more than one "regular" pie crust, but not quite enough for two full pies. One deep dish crust might be the answer. The topping is easy, I used pecans instead of walnuts. You can easily add or subtract ingredients based on your preferences. Overall this was a great recipe that I will definitely use again!

This pie was good, but not great as I expected from all the positive reviews.  I was especially disappointed because no one at my T-giving meal today cared for it, but raved over a pecan pie my mom made and a  pumpkin trifle cake my sister made.  The pie filling was a little too thick as opposed to being more like custard, which I prefer.  However, I used a different brand of sweetened condensed milk, NOT  EAGLE Brand condensed milk, which may have made a difference.  So, if you are going to try this, be sure to use EAGLE  brand in case that was the problem for me.

I made a few different pumpkin pie recipes from this site for Thanksgiving this year.  This one was everyones favorite hands down!  Folding in the fluffy egg whites really does something for the texture of it.  It's a much more fluffy/soft pumpkin pie because of it.  Not super dense at all like most.  The strussel was fabulous and put it over the top.  This recipe is a keeper.  A must try!

The best food I have ever made!! The pie was sweet and the walnuts, brown sugar, spices and pumpkin pie made this excellent. Using sweetened condensed milk I did not have to add sugar and it still came out very sweet. This recipe is a keeper!

This is a really good pumpkin pie. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of all the spices. It is somewhat lighter and has more of a "whipped" texture than your traditional pumpkin pie, I guess because of the whipped egg whites. I made it with the streusel, but it would also be great plain with some whipped cream on top.

This makes a great pie! I left it in the oven an extra 30 minutes because it didn't seem like it was setting up. Finally I took it out (even though it still looked really jiggly in the middle), I didn't want to ruin it! I guess it still wasn't long enough because the center fell. It tasted "done", though, and was delicious to boot. My husband loved the streusel topping. I will definitely make this again!

I made this for Thanksgiving a few years back and since then I have been asked to make it every year. It's the best pumpkin pie recipe that I've found. Even my husband (a notorious pie hater) will eat it!

This pie got rave reviews in our Christmas in July potluck. Several people asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper. I made it exactly as written. When I put the strudel topping on it seemed like way too much, but it worked out well when it was baked.

My boyfriend didn't say a word while he was eating this.  I was getting a little scared, but optimistic since he was still eating and hadn't stopped.  After he finished it he said it was better than any pumpkin pie his momma ever made :)  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.

This is without a doubt the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten!  I did not change anything and followed it to the letter.  I did make my own crust as I always do, and I got rave reviews from the family tonight!!  I definitely recommend this recipe and it is easy and trouble free to make.

My whole family loved the pie both warm from the oven and cold from the fridge the next morning. I like to keep things simple so I added the whole eggs at once instead of whipping the whites.

I'm not the biggest Pumpkin Pie fan, but this one was good.  I think its the usual texture that I don't like.  This recipe gave the pie more texture and interest.  I'll be making this again.

This is my 3rd year making this pie except it is called "Struesel Topped Pumpkin Pie" from Eagle Brand.  Exactly the same recipe except this one calls for 2 eggs, separating the yolks and the egg whites while my recipe only uses one egg.  I personally prefer a more dense filling so I probably wouldn't separate the eggs.  Just thought it was funny when I looked it up and saw it was pretty much a copy of that recipe.  The Eagle Brand recipe also uses a graham cracker crust which works great and is very tasty.  This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made and my husband loves it.  My 3 brothers and daughter do not like nuts so I may take some people's advice and omit the topping.   If you don't want a mousse type filling, try the Eagle Brand recipe.  You can find in the All Recipes site as well.

YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PIE!  My family raved about it at Thanksgiving.  I am not a big fan of pumpkin pie, but this is so light and airy, and the spices are spot on!  The topping gives it a wonderful crunch to offset the creamy deliciousness of the filling!  Simply the best you'll try, I promise.

Amazing, light, fluffy, sweet pie.  I don't normally like pumpkin pie so I was looking for a slight variation, and this one is great. I made both a regular pumpkin pie and this one, and this was a huge hit.  I added about 1/4 a cup of white sugar to it just to sweeten it up a tiny bit, and it was perfect.  The streusel topping is beautiful.  Very easy to bake and has definitely become a new tradition for this baker.

I make this pie every year for my coworkers, and every year I get at least two requests for an entire pie to take home.  One coworker gave me a pie plate for christmas to encourage me to make him more pies.  The year after that, he asked me to marry him so I could make him one pie a week (jokingly of course!).  That is just how good this recipe is!!!  It has a completely different consistancy from any other pumpkin pie that I've tried.  And I didn't really understand the hype since I had been eating it for so long until I tried a "normal" pie, and then I realized how truly fantastic this one is.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

Nice change from traditional pumpkin pie which I find too "heavy".  This has a nice airy texture.  Streusel topping is fantastic.  Definitely will be making this one on Thursday!Thanks.

I served this at a party I recently attended and got several compliments.  I didn't think it was too sweet and I liked the texture of the pie.  Like another reviewer, I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned, which certainly made all the difference.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was SO SIMPLE to make.  I thought that it sounded pretty easy, but it was even easier than I thought.  However, the 40 minutes to bake it went by SO SLOW as my house filled up with yummy pumpkin-pie fumes!  I couldn't resist and tried a bite last night a few hours after I made it, and I wasn't impressed.  However, this morning, after refridgerating all night, it was incredible!  I ate a quarter of it myself.  My parents, who usually hate pumpkin pie, also love it.  The inside is very fluffy. However, next time I might add a couple pinches of sugar to the filling, just because I have a huge sweet tooth and this wasn't very sweet.  Still A+!  I'll deffinetly be making it again!!!!

Yummy!  My daughter is allergic to eggs & nuts so I replaced the eggs with Ener-G Egg Replacer and left out the walnuts.  Still made a very tasty pie.  This one will be added to the family Thanksgiving recipe file!

This pie was fantastic! I was wary of making the topping because my boyfriend doesn't like walnuts or anything very sweet on pies, but it turned out perfect. I would definitely reccomend making the topping. It is delicious. Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

This was a pretty good recipe. All in all everyone enjoyed it. My mother-in-law doesn't even like pumpkin pie and she enjoyed this. She did make the comment that she couldn't even taste the pumpkin. I too found it good. Lighter then traditional pumpkin pie and the topping was yummy! I do have to say however, that it didn't satisfy my craving for "pumpkin pie". But a great treat..,yes I will make this one again. I did use pecans instead of walnuts.

Excellent pie!  My boyfriend absolutely loved it! Use a deep pie crust- the pie fits perfect in it.  Next time I might try pecans on the top instead of walnuts.  The streusel topping was good, but I'm just not a huge walnut fan.  I might use an extra tablespoon of butter on the top too.

Excellent! I don't usually like pumpkin pie, but I gave this one a try at Thanksgiving because I was preparing dinner for a friend from overseas and I wanted him to experience more traditional stuff. We both enjoyed it very much. Thank you for sharing.

Super easy even for A beginer. Makes more than enough for one so I usually make one with topping and one without, for those who like it A tad less sweet. I love it have used it at least 5 times since I found the recipe last month. Thanks it is A new favorite.

I have never been a huge pumpkin pie fan.  I just make it cause it is expected.  This is the best one I have ever made.  I mixed the eggs in w/o separating them and it was wonderful just the same.

Excellent.  I made my first pumpkin pie ever with this recipie, and its one of the best I've had.
I used fresh pumpkin for this and I doubled the recipie off the bat.  (About 3&1/4 cups pumpkin puree for 2 pies.)  I ended up with enough filling for a little more than 2 pies.  I use store bought crusts and put them in the oven about 5 minutes before adding the filling.  
I got lots of compliments.  Great Recipe, thanks.

We have always used the Libby's pumpkin pie recipe over the years - it is tried and true, but after seeing the reviews for this recipe, we gave it a try.  We did not care for the texture of the pumpkin in this recipe.  The flavor was good, but it just didn't quite measure up next to the Libby's recipe.  However, we all LOVED the topping and decided next time to use the Libby recipe for the pumpkin part and add the topping from this recipe.

I've never made a pie before, but I made this and a homemade crust (using the "Best Ever Pie Crust" found on the site) and it was the best pie I've ever had!

I made two, both with the streusel, but one without nuts. They were both fantastic, and *everyone* in my family raved about them! 

They went so quickly that from now on I'll be making three! Oh, and be sure to put a big spoonful of French Vanilla CoolWhip on top. YUM! Wish I had just one more slice!!!

For me this was a horrible pie, I followed the directions to a tee and the top came out burnt and cracked the middle was gooey and not done, and there was absolutely no flavor. This is not a recipe you can mess up, its very easy to make, but for some reason it did not like me. If you are gonna make this add more spices and you might want to bake it even lower than middle rack.

I made this pie a few days ago and it was delicious!  It did taste better after being refridgerated, the spices came together very nicely and I'd say it's the BEST pumpkin pie ever!  I will definitely make it for this year's Thanksgiving!

this is WONDERFUL. my pumpkin pie recipe search is over!!!!!!!!! i added two additional tbsps of flour as suggested by another reviewer but when i make this on thanksgiving i will go by the recipe. the extra flour left the streudel needing more sweetness. i used a store bought deep dish pie pan - i think they are just as good and i covered the edges with foil except for the last few minutes of cooking. THIS IS THE PERFECT PUMPKIN PIE and it offers a beautiful presentation

I think I should have baked this a little longer than 40 minutes after adding the topping.  It wasn't quite as firm as it should have been, but it was delicious.  We ate it warm the first night, but it was even better the next day.

Excellant recipie! I made one of these pies for my church's Harvest Festival and got rave reviews! It even won a prize in the baking contest. I also made it for a party at my house where it was also really well received. I added a little extra pumpkin pie spice and only used 1/2 cup of nuts because I don''t like nuts. I really liked the brown sugar topping. I wil make this again!

This pie has become a favorite with everybody I know.  They love the light, fluffy texture from the whipped egg whites, and the streusel topping is always a hit.  I add a little more cinnamon to the recipe and about 1/2 tsp. of ground clove to give it a little more spice.  I get requests for this EVERY year at Thanksgiving and Christmas.

This is my absolute favorite pie! I've been making it for probably 2 years now, and I'm just getting around to reviewing it. I must admit that I've never actually tried to do the walnut topping because I just love the pie as is! It's so easy to prepare and it tastes wonderful! I make this pie all year round, and my family loves it too. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

Great flavor to this pie.  I received lots of compliments from people who didn't really like pumpkin pie.  My only suggestion is to decrease the amount of filling that you put in the crust.  I used a deep dish crust and after adding the walnut topping, the filling rose so high that it broke the sides of the crust.  It has happened twice and the third time, I reduced the amount of filling that I added and had a perfect pie!

Unfortunately, I followed someone's advice and bought 2 deep dish shells...but really it would have filled 2 regular shells. Didn't care for the texture much or the taste...This would be good for someone who doesn't like "traditional" pumpkin pie, which I do...

I must admit that right out of the oven this pie made me a little nervous as it was puffed up so high compared to a standard pumpkin pie. But it settled as it cooled and looked quite appealing. The streusel topping was a wonderful touch! My family enjoyed it on Thanksgiving. A good holiday pie.

I made 7 of these for where I work for 63 sorority girls the next morning the pies were all gone (I also made 4 apple pies--88 pieces of pie total). We all LOVED this recipe. My hubby even liked this recipe---& he won't ever eat pumpkin pie. Great

This recipe is AWESOME!! We've made it every Friday for the last 3 weeks.  I accidentally doubled the amount of spices from 1/2 t to 1 t, and enjoyed it that way.  Also whisked in a tiny bit of vanilla and fresh ground nutmeg into whipping cream for the topping.

My boyfriend told me that when eating a piece of this pie he had to remind himself that I made it and that it wasn't store-bought!  The sweet, buttery walnut streusel is excellent - my favorite part.

I've never liked pumpkin pie before but this was good even to me!  All the pumpkin pie eaters in my family loved it too.  I followed the directions and it came out perfectly!  I will make it every Thanksgiving for sure!

Not a bad pie.   Definitely not traditional.   Do watch to NOT burn the topping / crust.  Best COLD the next day.

This was excellent!  I will stop looking for a pumpkin pie recipe.  As one of the reviewers noted, it is not necessary to whip the egg whites.  I didn't try the topping this time, but I might whip some up to put on the leftover pie for tonight.

I made this pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving 2002.  I usually worry when trying a new recipe for a holiday, but you need not worry with this one.  This pumpkin pie came out absolutely delicious and I am making it again for Christmas.  The topping made this pumpkin pie stand above the rest!

I thought this pie was great - the egg whites lightened the texture, and the crunchy topping really jazzed up what otherwise might be just an ordinary pumpkin pie.

Awesome, 
This was the first pumpkin pie I ever made and it was gobbled down quickly by a rowdy pack of goblins at my halloween party.  I actually liked it even more than my own grandmother's, (but I won't tell her that.)

The struesel topping really made it great. Easy enough for my 12 year old to make by herself. Husband doesn't like pumpkin pie but he said this one was "not bad" which means he still didn't like it but it was good for pumpkin pie :P Will plan on making this one every Thanksgiving. Thanks!

What can I say?  This was pumpkin pie x 10!  The pie itself is light & perfectly spiced,
and the streusel topping is to DIE FOR!  I also added ground walnuts in the pie crust -
I topped it with whipped cream that I added some ginger to.  I will make this every Thanksgiving!

This pie was wonderful.  It didnt make enough for two 9 inch pies unless each was a bit skimpy, but it was more than just one 9 inch.  I loved this pie, it was very very easy.  I wouldnt change a thing except chopping the nuts a bit smaller.  Overall a delicious pie.

The pie itself was good; however I believe the recipe for the topping is a bit much.  Next time I will cut it in half, I think it will be more of a complement with less topping.

Light & fluffly & deeelish!!  I made this for T-Day '02 & it was quite a hit!  As per the other reviewers, I made only 1/2 of the topping & that was plenty fine.  I use pecans, since I ran out of walnuts & it still turned out great.  I especially loved the light texture of this pumpkin pie...nice change from the dense traditional recipes.  I didn't even need to Cool-Whip my piece since it had a fabulous taste all by itself!  Thanks for submitting this recipe, it will be used again next year!

This pie was good, but I think I got too hyped up
about it from all the great reviews. I made this for 
Thanksgiving and it didn't go any faster than the regular pumpkin pies. There was too much filling for one pie.

This was a good pie. It tasted a lot like traditional pumpkin pie.  I didn't think the topping added any additional taste, really; but it was very pretty so I would do it again.  Mine was a little on the dry side so next time I will reduce the baking time by about 5 minutes.

This is fabulous. It is enough like a regular pumpkin pie to keep the die-hard traditionalists happy and enough unlike a regular pumpkin pie to get pumpkin pie haters to give it a try.  My husband said it's the best pumpkin pie he's ever had and I have to agree.  You must use a deep dish pie crust; even those are almost too small.  Also, I had to cook mine about ten minutes longer than the recipe said.

I do not normally even like Pumkin Pie, however it is a traditional dessert so I made this one.  It was WONDERFUL!  I used pecans instead of walnuts and it was the first pie gone.  Will make again.

I wanted to try out a couple of pumpkin pie recipes to see which one I liked best for Thanksgiving and I think this one is the one im going to make. It was a little bit sweet for my taste but I still loved it! I didnt buy pre-made crust, but used my grandmother's old recipe. Turned out great and it was mostly easy.

I tried using the evap milk - but I should have reduced the amount - also being Cdn - converting American quanties to Metric can be fun sometimes - but I'll know better next time. Topping - because of the liquidy mixture - became burnt abit since it took double time to set mixture - but I remedied the situation by drizzling Quebec maple syrup on top. With whipped creme - you didn't notice the difference - and the kids LOVED it - they had never had pumpkin pie before. This recipe is a keeper - am going to try it on my parents this w/e when I visit - and not make the same mistake as I did for this one. Bon appetite everyone!

This was the best pie!!  Everyone wanted seconds.  The only thing I did different was that I only used half the nuts.  I think all the nuts would have been too much.  I also used a deep dish pie crust!!

What a great pie!  I made this yesterday for our Thanksgiving dinner and everybody loved it. It was very creamy and the topping was superb. Easy to make also. Thank you for sharing this recipe Cindy, it will now be a regular at our table.

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.  I can't even describe how much the family loved this pie.  I fixed it at Thanksgiving and have had requests for it ever since.  It's truly exquisite.

The streusel topping was a real winner, people loved it! I added extra walnuts because they baked up so delicious people were eating them off the pie. Nobody even thought it was a pumpkin pie until they bit into it. The filling was pretty yummy too, although it was a bit much for a 9 inch pan and filled a 10 inch easily.

Super easy to make.  This was actually my first pumpkin pie!  I made two and had guests over for dessert after Thanksgiving.  All 6 other pies were neglected in favor of this one.  HIGH PRAISE.  I skipped the walnuts and no one missed them.

It was almost chiffon-like with the beaten egg whites.  I beat them til they were merangue, and it gave the pie an incredible texture.  It didn't taste pumpkiny enough for me, though.

A great recipe!  I wasn't sure if some family members would like it, so I only put the topping on 1/2 of each pie. Well, the topping half was the favorite!!!!!! Thanks for the new family tradition in our home!

Everybody loves this recipe. I do not like Pumpkin Pie so I have not tried it. All I know is one night my husband was on the phone with his friend and mentioned I had a Pumpkin Pie in the oven. This friend was over one night when I made this recipe before. Next thing you know, the friend was at my door inviting himself in. I also made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I used bakers secret pie crust found on this site.

My aunt said it was probably the best tasting pumpkin pie she ever had.  My daughter (11) did not want the topping.  Everybody else like the topping, though.

Wow, this was amazing! We made our first Thanksgiving dinner this year and so we really didn't know what we were doing (other than what we've learned from our parents), but this was really easy to make. The streusel topping places this pie above the rest. We also had 2 non-pumpkin pie eaters at our dinner and they both really liked it. It's especially good with French Vanilla ice cream! This will definitely stay with my Thanksgiving menu next year.

not sweet enough, needs more brown sugar in pumpkin mixture and should use a thickener for a more stable consistency vs just fluff. With a thickener it is better than the usual "custard-like" pumpkin pies. Just alter this recipes and it will be a success

This is a tasty, less-sweet and nicely spiced pie as per the directions. 
The first time we made this recipe we oopsed and messed up the pumpkin-spices ratio. It was delicious lol. So I’ve made it that way ever since.  I’ve also modified it over the years to be dairy/soy/gluten-free, with delicious results. 
I guess you could say this was the inspiration for my go-to pumpkin pie recipe.

It was terrible. The top tasted like nothing, and the spices were off and did not remind me of thanksgiving. It was not sweet at all inside and the spices seemed to change the way the pumpkin filling tasted. My family, who loves pumpkin pie, only ate half a slice each. I had to cook for 10 minutes longer, and the pie looked good, and the inside was jiggly and soft, but we hated it. Will never try this again, and I recommend that you don't try to bake this either! Big waste of perfectly good pumpkin filling, that could be used in a much better pie recipe.

I make this pie every year and it's always a huge hit! I like that the egg whites make the pie lighter, and since you're not using the canned "pumpkin pie mix" you can increase or decrease the spices depending on your own taste. The streusel topping is great, and you can change that up, too. I've used chopped pecans, or walnuts, but I like using pine nuts best, for some reason. I only allow myself to have Cool Whip once a year, and this pie is it!

This is AWESOME!  I use pecans instead of walnuts for the topping.  Have been making this for a few years now, and I am "not allowed in the door" at Thanksgiving without this pie!

The first time I made this, I used premade Graham cracker crusts to experiment. The recipe filled two crusts. The filling was so light and didn't truly set 100%, and the pie fell apart when serving.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Everyone loved it, despite it falling apart.  I'm making it today with homemade regular pie crusts, so hopefully it'll be a bit more successful.

This also tastes amazing with the Bourbon whipped cream recipe found here on Allrecipes.

This is my second Thanksgiving i've made this pie for. It's a huge family pleaser. Might be the streusel topping. We've tried with both canned pumpkin filling and fresh pumpkin. Both delicious. The Brown family pie is now our family tradition. Thanks!

I've been making this recipe for several years now and can't bring myself to make any other for pumpkin pie anymore.  I use my own personal pie crust recipe.  For seasonings, I change it up just a little to ensure that no one else can make it quite the same way I do after I tell them where to find the recipe.  :)  Everything else is exactly as the instructions say and well worth the effort!  I make at least 2 for Thanksgiving, then more for Christmas and New Year's.  After that, I need the long break to burn off the ridiculous amounts I end up eating myself!

This pie was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. I actually made 2 pies, one with the topping and one without.  The only substitution I made to the topping was pecans instead of walnuts. Otherwise everything else was exactly as the recipe called for.

It's a great recipe! As I live in Europe, I don't always have pureed pumpkin available. This year I had to substitute it with sweet potato and I could not tell the difference. The pie was so light and fluffy.  I think it might be the egg whites that you have to beat separately. Delicious!

Pie was good - the walnut topping didn't quite go with it. If I make it again, will consider using peacans.

If I could give 10 stars, I would. I receive nothing but rave reviews whenever I make this pie; friends, family, coworkers have all loved it! Whenever there's a potluck style function, this is what I bring. While I like the walnut topping, I like mixing it up a little and changing the topping.

I did not care for this recipe. I've made many pumpkin pies before and this is a simple recipe to follow. The texture was off and it was very mushy inside. Also, there was almost no spice flavor to it. I won't be making this again.

I made this pie last week for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Everyone raved about it, even the kids. Next year I will have to make two, because everyone wanted seconds. I made the pie filling the same, but I made my own crust. I have perfected a gingersnap cookie crust that paired very well will this pie. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this alot next year.

I have been making this pie every year since I've got married- 11 years! My husband has told me that this is THE BEST pumpkin pie. Better then his mother's and she is THE PIE QUEEN. I love the texture of this pie ,but I have few modifications: less ginger - 1/4 tsp( not my favorite spice) and 1/4 tsp allspice. Also always pecans instead walnuts. My pie is in the oven and this year my 9 year old daughter is making it! It is so easy. !

This is our favorite Pumpkin Pie!  I do make a couple alterations, I use 1 2/2 c. heavy Cream and 1 c. brown sugar instead of the sweetened condensed milk.  And I substitute Allspice for the nutmeg.  I was out of vanilla this time so I substituted Maple flavoring.  It smells delish! This time I'm going to double the topping ingredients, we love the crunch! Oh, I use pecans in the topping instead of walnuts, I'm allergic to walnuts.

The most delicious pumpkin pie ever......forget store bought this is better and easy to make. So i made it at my mom's house on thanksgiving. The house was buzzing from turkey being cooked to my sister making my little brother a birthday cake to me making this pie. I used store bought crust  and ended up with 2 pies. I made one with struesal topping and one plain. Added a little more spice. They were a hit. The walnut stresual one was gone in a flash. defenitly a keeper. i want to make it everyday. thankx

The best pumpkin pie recipe and used every year in our house. I replace the walnuts with pecans and use 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual ones.  I'm always asked for this at Thanksgiving in Canada!

My family loved this, didn't use the walnuts. Everything else as written. This was gone before the traditional pumpkin pie!

Delicious.  Easy to make and the topping is a yummy extra touch that also makes the pie look special.  I don't like walnuts, so I used pecans.

I've used this recipe for years now and it is a success every time. I'm not a huge fan of the regular pumpkin pie due to the lack of different textures. However, here you get the smooth pumpkin along with the crunchy topping. It is a sure winner!

This was a great pie! The nutmeg was a bit strong, so I might cut it back to 1/4 teaspoon next time. THANK YOU!

In place of nutmeg I used a 1/2tsp of cardomom, and 1/2 tsp cloves, it made all the difference becasue I dislike the flavor of nutmeg..other than that it was great!

The dough was uncooked but I had to take it out because the pie filling had already set. If I make it again I will definitley precook the crust before hand

This pie is by far the BEST pumpkin pie I have ever made! Not only does it look beautiful when done, it tastes AMAZING! I did not adjust the recipe at all, and it was perfect. I always like to try the original recipe before making the adjustments that other reviewers recommend, but I felt like this did not need any altering. My mother in law (who is an amazing cook herself) LOVED this pie to the point where she thought I should sell it, and my 3 year old daughter claims it is her "most favorite dessert ever!"

OMG! This is really good! I am not a fan of pumpkin pie because of its texture, but this recipe adds a crunch to the fluffy pie that I love! My father ate 3 slices and took half a pie home! I ended up making 2 more pies that weekend. The only change that I made was to add 1/4 all spice. Everyone who had a piece of this pie asked for the recipe and are making it theirs! Thank you Cindy! I finally found a pumpkin pie I like!

I'm not a pumpkin pie fan so I didn't try it but my husband said it was very good. Said he thought it was lighter/more airy than usual. I think the topping might have been a little bit too much. He said it was "different" but still it was good.

The consistency of this filling was perfect - it kept its shape beautifully when cut. I think it needs just a little more spice, though. I think I will double the amount of spices next time I make it.

I mostly used this recipe for the topping. I used fresh pumpkin puree and homemade crust. The topping turned out beautifully! But the topping to pumpkin ratio seems a bit overwhelming so I may crush the walnuts next time and see if I can't get a thinner layer so the pumpkin flavor can come through more. Overall a great recipe, especially if you have family/friends who don't particularly love pumpkin.

Big hit. It was about 4-1 on the topping, so next time I'll do 4 parts topping 1 part without. Made it exactly like recipe said except for the nuts. My wife even liked it, and she's not big on pumpkin pie.

Great recipe.  The toping almost tasted like it was burned, but once the pie was chilled and we added whipped cream, it was delicious. I wouldn't make a pumpkin pie any other way now.

This recipe turned out a beautiful pie.  It is good, but my family prefers the recipe on the pumpkin can.  The streusel topping overwhelms the normal pumpkin pie taste that we all love.

I don't like pumpkin pie but some of my family does, so i made this for thanksgiving dessert. They enjoyed it! I made recipe as is except ommited the ginger, and added more cinnamon. Also used a frozen deep dish pie crust, and omitted the streusel.

It alarmed me that there was no sugar in this pie (it just alarms me in general if there's no sugar in food I'm about to eat), but it turns out the sweetened condensed milk took care of it.  This pie didn't taste like a store bought one, but one that was truly home-made.  Definitely steal-able from a window sill.

Very nice!  I grew tired of pumpkin pie several years ago.  But when I saw this, I had to try it and I'm glad I did.  The topping is excellent and the pumpkin filling is very good.  I didn't need whipped cream or ice cream for mine!  And my family loved it too!

Made this exactly as it is written!  It looks just as beautiful!  My family loves it...  I chose it mostly because my sister just married a man with the last name Brown so I thought it would be cute to come with this pie's name.  SUCCESS!

I just made two of these today.  Easy recipe.  For the first pie I followed the original directions of the egg whites and the ingredients was quite high in the pie plate.  The second pie I did not whip the egg whites to see if there was a difference and this pie wasn't as high as the first one.  Although, after baking, the second pie had risen to the height of the first pie, then as they cooled, they both fell.  lso, I forgot to take the foil off the edges but the crust came out fine.  And finally, I doubled the topping and it was too much, so I'll take some off.  I'm making whipped cream to go with this on the side.  I sure would like to know if the pie is supposed to fall.

I've been making this pie for almost 6 years now and I've never had a complaint.  My husband won't let me make a different pumpkin pie now since this is his favorite.  I use pecans instead of walnuts since I like them better and I also add a pinch or so of ground cloves for a little extra spice.  Such a great recipe!!

Oh.My.God. I used fresh pumpkin (it makes a world of difference). Positively the best pumpkin pie, hands down. I followed the recipe to a T, aside from using fresh pumpkin. Wow.

DELICIOUS!!!!  Very easy to put together, an absolute no-brainer!  This custard was very light, not heavy like traditional pumpkin pie filling, but had all the traditional flavor.  I used graham cracker crust for my pre-Thanksgiving/Christmas test of this recipe and it fits the bill to a T!  The only thing I added was a little bit of ground clove and a little vanilla extract.  This is my go-to Pumpkin Pie recipe from now on.  And the strudel really makes this pie special.  For me, this recipe made two shallow (er)graham cracker crust pies.  This recipe is to DIE for, forget all the haters that said it was too bland or not sweet enough!

This was my first time making pumpkin pie and it turned out pretty good. I didn't add the streussel topping though - it just doesn't seem right on a pumpkin pie. Anyway, this pie was no better or worse than any other store-bought pie I've ever had, but it was really easy to make (although it is by no means made "from scratch"). Thus, 3 stars. I would make this pie again, but will keep searching for a better recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I made a few changes that worked out well.  I used fresh pumpkin puree, eliminated the nutmeg (I don't care for it), doubled the ginger (I love ginger), and omitted the topping.  The pie was fantastic! My new in-laws were impressed and even the pickiest nieces and nephews licked their plates.  This one is a keeper.

I loved this recipe!  I don't really like pumpkin pie usually, but I make it b/c my husband likes it.  The crumble on top made the pie so much more flavorful and interesting than the standard blah pie with just whipped cream on it.  I also loved that it was so light and fluffy in the pumpkin part!

All the ingredients were the same as traditional pumpkin pie except you separate the eggs and beat the whites. It makes the pie a little fluffier and not so dense.

A great, simple, traditional pumpkin pie. Very easy to make. I did the streusel topping the first time and didn't care for it, and now eliminate it. It still makes a great pie.

Really delicious pie! Very easy, but so yummy! I made one with the nut topping and one without, and both were gobbled up! I really liked the texture that the beaten egg whites added to the pie and definately recommend doing that part. It made it so light and fluffy, rather than dense.
I'm tempted to make another for my family tonight... so good!

Traditional pumpkin pie is a little boring for me and I never got too excited about it. But when I saw this recipe I thought I would give it a shot and I am so glad I did. It's not as heavy as the pumpkin pie I was used to having growing up, instead it's lite, fluffy and the perfect amount of sweetness. And that 'optional' streusel topping, should not be option. It was the best part! The only change was I used pecans instead of walnuts. I've already saved this recipe and plan on making it for Thanksgivings to come.

I ended up making two pies, one with the struesel topping and one without. Both were fantastic! The plain pumpkin had such a wonderful spice flavor and the struesel topped pie was sweet and spicey. This will be my pumpkin recipe every year! YUM, YUM!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving 2008! It's not like the traditional custard pumpkin pie.  It's much lighter and fluffier to balance the streusel topping. My mom loved this pie!

A little too light for me.  At least mine was;I used fresh pumkin puree. Could be a little more dense. I made real whipped cream to go on it.  Yum!!

This pie was great. I personally am not a fan of pumpkin piebut I wanted to make one for my husband as a trial run for the holidays. He loved it. I even tried a bite of his and I liked it. This was so easy. As a person that works full-time and goes to school.  This is as close to scratch as I'm going to get that fits into my schedule. Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious Pumpkin Pie.  I love the topping idea.  This even got rave review from my mother-in-law who said this will have to be our family's new pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving.

I made this with a graham cracker crust instead and it was delicious!  Had MANY requests for the recipe.  I did have a fair bit of leftover filling, but just put it in a ramekin and baked it alongside the pie for a little taste test preview.  :)

This was great! Made it for a dinner party and it was a big success! My mom (who doesn't give compliments out often). Even said it was better than Mrs. Smith's. The only thing I changed was omitting the nuts from the streusel topping. DON'T OMITT THE STREUSEL TOPPING! It completes this pie.

You know what's so great about this pie?  You actually get to taste 'pumpkin' not just sugar!  And because it's not horribly sweet you can appreciate the crunchy topping.  I've made this several times and it's always delicious.  You can also make the topping without nuts and it is yummy.  Last night I made it for the first time with homemade pie crust - Never Fail Pie Crust II  from this site - I didn't think it could taste any better...but it did.  Easy pie crust - mix ingredients with mixer and press into pie plate.  I prefer a thicker crust, so this made the pie PERFECT.  You gotta try this one....

This is the second pumpkin pie recipe that I've tried, and I just love it! But I misread the ingredients though and used tablespoons measurements instead of teaspoon for the ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon resulting in my pie to taste a little spicy! Still tasted good, though, but I'll make it right the next time!

This is the best. Everyone in my family asked for the recipe. The texture is lighter and fluffier than most pumpkin pies  (because of the egg whites)- delicious. And the streusel... absolutely delightful.

I'd never made, tasted pumpkin pie until I moved to this country.  I went by the reviews and made this one, and it's simply superb.  And it couldn't be easier to make.  Throw a few things together, throw it in the oven and you're done.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have made. The topping really makes the pie. Make sure you chop the walnuts very fine - I bought chopped walnuts and still chopped them until they were fine. I think it makes a better topping. Also be sure not to overbake this one. It's not nearly as good if the topping gets too brown.

This was a very good pie.  Definately will be adding sugar next time though!  I made the topping with pine nuts instead of walnuts!  We are such pine nut lovers.  Very good overall just needed that little bit of sugar to make it 5 stars!

Outstanding!  Made this for my first attempt at cooking Thanksgiving dinner and it was a total hit.  Rave reviews and no leftovers!  I did replace the walnuts with pecans in the streusel and added a couple extra ounces of puree.  This will become my signature holiday pie.

This was my first attempt at baking my own pumpkin pie. It was awkward, but that was due to my pie making technique, not this recipe. It was fine, but not the grand finale I was hoping for Thanksgiving dinner.

Thank you!  What a nice twist on an old favorite.  The only change I made was to serve it on the gingersnap crust from Shelley’s recipe for Pumpkin Cheesecake in a Gingersnap Crust also on this site.  Truly delicious and a beautiful presentation.

This was an awesome pie. The struesel topping nice and crsp and delicious. The pie itself lighter than the average. I love lots of spice, so I added extra. Very good!

The struesel (without nuts) was an O.K. change to your usual pumpkin pie.  I made one pie following the recipe and one pie following the recipe and not adding the struesel.  Both were good, but I liked the plain one much more.  It was very light and fluffy and not too strong in spices.

I've been making this pie for a few years.  I love it, and I get lots of complements on it.  It has a very light texture with the spices not been too overpowering.  The baking time works perfect for me.

I have been making this for 4 years, and it is a family favorite.  My only change is to use pecans instead of walnuts.  It seems to take longer to bake in my oven also, I usually end up baking for about 1 1/2 total, my pie middle never sets after the initial 55 minutes for the recipe.  I also wrap foil around the crust to prevent it from burning.  This is the best pie ever!!!

I don't love pumpkin pie, but the topping on this made it better.  It's a good pie and everybody at Thanksgiving enjoyed it.  I doubled the receipe and only put the topping on one.  Served with Cool Whip.

This pie is a total home run!  I had never ever made a pie before and signed up to bring one to my work's Thanksgiving lunch.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a whirl.  It is incredibly easy to make and the streusel topping really complements the pie.  It gives it a little something extra. My co-workers were asking for the recipe and none of them could believe that this was my first attempt at making a pie!  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!  It's delicious and is going to become a standard in my house at Thanksgiving from now on.

What a great pie! My husband is a big fan of pumpkin pie, and he's placed this one at the top of his list! I used a granola based crust, and it complimented the struesel. Will definitely make again.

Very fluffy but so flavourful!  It's amazing.  Also cooked some in a souffle dish without the crust, perfect!
Cooking time was alot shorter than suggested though...might be my oven?

W O W ! ! I think this is the best recipe I've found on this website. Incredible. I made it for my husband's Texas Hold 'Em night. The guys always want a sweet treat. My husband kept a tally sheet of how many compliments the pie got...among 7 guys, there were 21 compliments. You gotta try this now, even though we are eon's away from Thanksgiving!!!!!!!

Yes! I have found the best pumpkin pie in this world!! I came across this recipe to make two different kinds of pumpkin pie and this one came up the winner and I was to make another pumpkin pie for another dinner and this is the one that was requested!! I really love this recipe. The other one was very very good but this one is the winner above all!! When I came across this recipe the name caught my eye, my maiden name is Brown and so I had to test this one out especially after reading all of the reviews. And I was absolutely sold. The ratings are right on! Thank you!!

I didnt do the strussel topping because my guests dont like nuts....also I didnt separate the eggs because I was really pressed for time....I know I didnt follow the recipe like I should have but it turned out really well and probably will be better when I do as the instructions say.

WOW! My boyfriend said it was better than any pumpkin pie his momma ever made :)

I added 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, used pecans instead of walnuts and didn't seperate the eggs.  PERFECT!

This was a real hit with my family.  The streusel top got a little bit too brown, next time I may cover with tinfoil, but it tasted great!

Loved it!!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!  I served it with maple whipped cream (whipped cream recipe from this site w/maple extract instead of vanilla) and cinnamon ice cream (also from this site).

I tried this recipe last year and my kids asked me for it again this year. I'm not a good cook...(believe me, my husband and kids and a long line of relatives can attest to that, ha-ha!) but with this recipe, I've earned the "Best Pumpkin Pie baker in the family"... thanks!

I really liked the pie, but wasn't a huge fan of the crunch topping. I think the pie is a keeper, but I would make it plain or with a different topping.

This recipe is wonderful!  I didn't add the topping since I was also making pecan pie and wanted to have an option without nuts.  Since I didn't use the topping, I added just a little bit of sugar to the filling.  It was also so simple!  I would recommend this whether this is the first or the hundreth pie you've ever made.

Excellent!  I made this for Thanksgiving and the family loved it.  I added 1/3 cup sugar to make it a little sweeter as other reviews suggested.  The topping made it unique and it looked great.

Everyone loved this pumpkin pie.  Next time I'll skip the topping.  I made one with and one without and everyone went for the traditional pumpkin without the topping and just added the whipped cream.  This will be a regular at our Thankgiving table.

I substituted soy milk for the condensed milk and the pie ended up sort of soggy.  
I did really liked the streusel topping, though.

Very good, better when extra flavorings added (more spices,etc), topping burns easily.

The best pumpkin I've ever had!  My whole family loved it.  The first time we made it without the topping, but the second time we used the topping and it was great.  Sounded odd for pumpkin pie, but it was great.

This was only ok.  I've had and made better.  I didn't do the streusel topping, but probably should have.  If I do make this again, I will make the topping.

This pie was just a little too odd with the beaten egg whites for me.  It was better the next day, but still will not be a recipe I make again.  thanks anyway.

This recipe is simple to make and absolutely amazing! I didn't think that pumpkin pie would be this simple to make. It's also not extremely expensive to make...even for a college student!

The walnut streusel on top really adds to the flavor of the pumpkin pie!  Some people I made this for said they normally didn't like pumpkin pie very much, but they loved this!  I will definitely do it again.

I made this without the walnut topping for Thanksgiving. Despite stuffed stomachs, everyone went for a 2nd slice of this pie! The spices really make the difference between this and your standard pumpkin pie. Next time I would make this with medium size eggs. I used XL eggs and ended up with too much filling for the shell. Overall, easy and delicious!

The pie was great, no doubt about it.  The topping really dressed up an otherwise boring Thanksgiving standby.  However, the taste was a bit "off" for me.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't 5 stars either.

This recipe is good, just make sure you let it sit overnight.  It was a little to airy for me but after it sat it got better.  Loved the topping too.

Delicious!  This is my first attempt at making pumpkin pie.  It was light and fluffy...not dense like regular pumpkin pie.  I used fresh pumpkin and I think it made the consistency too soft/wet but the flavor was outstanding!  I think I will use canned pumpkin next time. FYI...this pie really grows in the oven!

I made two of these pies for Thanksgiving for my in-laws and they were a hit! I might skip the streusel topping next time as it wasn't entirely necessary and not everyone likes nuts.

This is a very good recipe.  I had never made a pumpkin pie before.  We had this for Thanksgiving and it was very good. We enjoyed it very much, I couldn't have been happier with the excellent taste and the final product. I honestly can't think of one thing that would have made it better.

Delicious pie and easy to make.  First time making the recipe it didn't occur to me to use a deep-dish pie crust, so I ended up with 2 pies, but still tasted very good!  Second time around I got the pie crust right and also used pecans instead of walnuts and preferred that.

I made this pie for a thanksgiving party at college and everyone loved it!  The only thing that went wrong was the topping was not crumbly and made puddles over the top, it still tasted great though.  I had to use gluten free flour because of allergies so this is most probably the reason the topping clumped up... It still tasted very good and was fluffy and light.  I added a bit more spice to my taste which is a personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very flavorful and aromatic. The walnut topping is very tasty and crispy, reminded me of candy brittle. It's also surprisingly easy to make. Tweaking is not needed for this recipe.  Mmmmm!!!

If I could give it more stars, I would!  I made this for Thanksgiving and 3 of my guests have called me since to see if I still had any pumpkin pie left over.  Unfortunately, I don't!  But I already promised my husband I would be making another one first thing tomorrow.  Everyone loves it and made me look like quite the chef :)

Everyone loved it.  I opted not to do the topping and I added an additional 1/2 a can of pumpkin pie mix.  Very good.

This is a fantastic pumpkin pie!  It's lighter and fluffier than the traditional pie and the streussel topping was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly and I don't think it needs any changes.  I thought I might miss the traditional, dense version but I didn't at all.  I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it.  I plan on making this one again.

I'm making this in place of the traditional pumpkin this year.  It's so pretty and tastes wonderful too!  Very light and airy with the egg whites mixed in.  Great contrast to the pecan pie I'm serving.  This time though I will cut back on the topping just a tad and possibly add a bit of sugar.  My son prefers traditional but everyone else loved this!  Thanks Cindy!

I tried this recipe yesterday, it was my first attempt at making pumpkin pie.  It was easy & very tasty, and looks much prettier than pumpkin pie usually does w/ the topping.  Will definitely become a staple at Thanksgiving from now on.  Had to come back & update...the pie was such a hit at Thanksgiving that I am making it again for Christmas, by special request of my Grandpa.  He LOVED it, and he usually doesn't like pumpkin pie.

This was my first attempt at pie baking.  The recipe was so easy and the pie was EXCELLENT.  Beware - when it first came out of the oven, I served it before it really cooled.  It was mushy and had a really strong taste.  Once it cooled it was great so definately let it cool before serving.  I used canned pumpkin and a ready made crust...

I made this pie last year for Thanksgiving, and will be making it again this year.  I don't like the traditional heavy pumpkin pie, so I tried this one and actually really liked it and the pumpkin pie lovers in the family thought it was heavenly.  This recipe is a definate "keeper"!

This is extremely sweet.  With the sweetened condensed milk you cannot control the sugar.  The sweet completely overpowered the pumpkin....company didn't like it either!

This was truly the best Pumpkin Pie I've ever had.  The egg whites made it extremely light and fluffy, and the struessel topping gave it the perfect finishing touch.  Add a little French Vanilla Icecream on the side and you can't beat it.

It was good.  I would say it wasn't that much better than regular pumpkin pie.  That was probably the first and last pastry pie crust I'll ever make, though.  Not worth the effort.  I'll buy mine next time.  Oh, also, like many others, my struesel was not crumbly at all (kind of doughy instead).  I should have put it in the microwave and drizzled it like another reviewer said.  Instead, I picked off little pieces and spread them on top trying to get the struesel effect.  Don't do that.  After baking, the pieces of "struesel" look like polka dots on top of the pie.  Good thing I just made this one for my husband and me, so presentation didn't matter much. :)

It's pretty good-my hubby said he liked it. I was on the fence...I liked the streusel topping, but I used pecans instead if walnuts because of personal preference. I got a sore arm from beating the egg whites until peaks formed, and I didn't notice a difference in the texture of this pie versus other pumpkin pies.

I was not a big fan of this recipe. The streudle topping was a hit but the fluffy pumpkin layer left much to be desired. My preference would be the more traditional dense texture. I will try the streudle topping again (using pecans instead. Recommendations with this recipe - don't whip the eggs and add additional nutmeg with a dash of ground cloves.

I was nervous when making my first pumpkin pie (using this recipe) to take to a dinner party.  I saw a couple negative reviews that made me think it might not be that great.  But, it was incredible! It was a hit! Thank you so much, Cindy.
 
Update: Been now making it for several years.  Haven't changed a thing to the recipe and it is always a hit. I do put foil over the crust, so it doesn't burn.

This was hands down the BEST pumpkin pie I've ever made-and I've made a few. Me and my sister and tried and true pumpkin pie fanatics and this satisfied even us. And then my husband isn't the biggest fan and even he liked this recipe. The only thing that I changed was using almonds instead of walnuts and it did the trick. I was testing this for Thanksgiving and the family clamored for it to be re-made! The only problem was that there was not enough pie to go around. So next time I will make two! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Excellent!!  I tried this recipe this weekend for our Canadian Thanksgiving.  When my husband found out we were trying a "new" recipe, he figured this should be interesting.  It was a HUGE hit!!  Light, fluffy and just overall yummy!  We didn't change a thing!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This really is an EXCELLENT pumpkin pie.  I was going to leave the topping off, but I decided to try it, without the nuts.  It was so good, there wasn't any need for whipped cream.

OMG OMG OMG, this pie has got to be the best pumpkin pie I've ever had!!!  I made it awhile ago, and became a member just so I could put in a review.  Everytime I make this pie for an event, I always bring recipe cards, because everyone wants to know where I got this recipe from!!

I like pumpkin pie that is really smooth and creamy. This had a strange texture and I didn't really like the flavor, although it did get a little better after sitting for a while and the pie really looked quite nice. I might try it again without the nutmeg and use the spices that Libby's uses on the side of the can. It just didn't do it for me tastewise so I probably won't attempt to make this for the next holiday meal.

This was my second homemade pumpkin pie in years. It turned out great! Never had a pumpkin pie taste so good.
I did beat the egg whites with the batter a little bit, because it just didn't seem to mix right with just folding in.
I also don't make my own crust, so I bought Marie Callender's frozen pie crust in the freezer section of the grocery store.
I did make it using fresh pumpkin, but canned would still be great.
It is so much better than the old recipes!

Oh my goodness! Wonderful. I'm not a big pumpkin pie fan, but this was great. The topping makes it I think. This was requested (and made) for Christmas this year. So long to the "traditional" pumpkin pie.

I was actually dubbed the "Pumpkin Pie Queen" after making this at Thanksgiving.  I used pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference).  I always thought my grandmother's pie was the best -not anymore!  Thanks Cindy B.

I don't know, maybe this pie would've turned out better if I didn't put that topping on it. I'll try it again, and rate it again... But for now, its only a 3 star.

This pie seems pretty bland. I prefer the recipe on the side of the can.

The pumpkin pie was delicious and a big hit at a recent party!  While the flavor was very nice, I thought that it could have benefited from a bit more spice in the flavor.  Thank you for sharing.  I think that in my future attempts I will experiment with ground cloves or pumpkin pie spice.

I guess I expected more after all the great reviews, but I wasn't too impressed.  The topping is definitely only for those who REALLY like walnuts.  I prefer other recipes for pumpkin pie I've tried - even just the traditional ones.

This pie was perfect!  I usually use the recipe on the can of pumpkin, but this one is much better.  The streusel topping made a huge difference!

This pie was fantastic; I have never made any sort of pie before, but this turned out just great for Thanksgiving.  I toned down the spices by about half for my second pie, and the family agreed it was much better.  Very easy and a great result...will make again and again!

This was probably one of the worse pumpkin pie recipe's ever!!  Unless you are diabetic, this pie, not cinnamon topping has no taste.  The pie is bland and should have a sweeter taste.  I compared this recipe with another and the biggest difference is that there was no sugar added to the pie mixure!  I have no idea why other people are raving about this recipe..

I cooked this pie for a much longer time than suggested and I still had no problem with the topping burning. The texture of the pie itself was a bit strange-it kinda looked uncooked. But I must say that the taste was good and I surely will be making it again. Thanks!

Loved it... I don't like the traditional pumpkin pie, but I love this one. My husband loved it too. It was a HUGE hit for Thanksgiving. I too substituted pecans for the walnuts (they were what I had on hand) and it was still wonderful.

Perfect.  I used the Basic Flaky pie crust from here.  I wanted something different than the recipe off the can.  This was kinda fluffy and moist.  These pies were devoured at Thanksgiving.

Again, this recipe never fails.  This was the second time I made this pie (the first was last Thanksgiving).  It's very easy to make and is great both cold (if you decide to bake it the night before and refrigerate it), or fresh out of the oven. I followed the exact recipe and it turned out beautifully.  I plan to make this again next year.

this pie turned out great for me. I used a different recipe for my crust and put a little tin foil over the pie while baking to keep the crust from going to golden brown. Just right. It was absolutely a hit amongst all the family.

I had to try this since the reviews are wonderful. I really thought it was just ok. Nothing to rave about. Tastes almost exactly like the recipe on the back of the pumpkin can did. Will not be making this again.

An absolutely awesome pie! Although the streusel topping is optional, I would definately recommend using it because it adds so much flavor.

Awesome!  Very fluffy, not like what I'm used to in a pumpkin pie.  Everyone scarfed it down.... even the husband, who rarely eats sweets.  I ended up using two 9-inch deep-dish pie pans, so I actually doubled the topping ingredients.  Thanks so much!!

This was a great pie.  I have made it twice now and my husband keeps begging me to make more.  And no, I am not from the Brown family.  My husband does not like nuts so I left those out.  Will be making it for Father's Day.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving not knowing that my new in-laws didn't like pumpkin pie.  They tried it and they've asked me to make it for them several times since then.  It was a hit!!

Just like the review below from Flannelpants, I made this at Thanksgiving and was the smash hit of the holiday.  I have had specific requests (demands?) to bring the pie again for Christmas.  My husband prefers the texture of a "traditional" pumpkin pie, which is more dense than this one.  But he was the only one out of 10 of my in-laws that had any objection.  This pie is so fluffy and light, and full of rich flavor.  The streusel crust was unconventional for a pumpkin pie, but really made the pie that much better.  A KEEPER !!!

Made great pie...I was able to make two pies with this filling, although one got cheated. This just needs to make like 3/4 of a cup more and it would fill two pies just fine. Overall very good

I am not a fan of pumpkin pie, in fact, I didn't even eat this one.  My boyfriend, however, loves pumpkin pie.  He had to fly on Thanksgiving Day, so when he came home, I had this pumpkin pie waiting for him.  He said this was the BEST pumpkin pie he's ever had.  I'm going to bring one of these to my mom's for Christmas.

This is one of four pies I made for Thanks Giving and I'm a first time pie baker. I can say it went over very well and it too will be a pie that will be made again in the near future. Thank you THE DAD.

This pie was pretty easy to make and tasted good.  After reading all the rave reviews I was a little disappointed however.  Maybe I built it up too much in my mind, but it was pretty similar to any other pumpkin pie I have had.  My family enjoyed it though.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  It was really fluffy and was so easy to make.  Don't be alarmed if it does rise in the oven.  It will go down after you take it out to cool.  Everyone loved this pie.  Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic! The pie was fun to make and the whipped egg whites made the consistancy lighter without taking away any of the richness of flavor. I served it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It is now my pumpkin pie recipe of choice. Thank you to the Brown family for posting it!

This pie is awesome. For Thanksgiving we had 5 different pies and this one was the only one that was gone by the end of dinner.I think what people really liked about it was the streusel topping. My advice would be to watch it when baking - those walnuts toast very quickly. I would not hesitate to make this one again and again.

I loved this pie!! It's not heavy like most pumpkin pie. I had people at dinner who don't like pumpkin pie compliment me on it. I took the advice on using finely chopped pecans instead of walnuts. It makes a wonderful topping that most who don't like nuts won't mind.

Good Stuff.  I made two 9 inch pies out of it though. I divided the streusel topping and made 1 pie with nuts and one pie with just streusel topping for those who don't care for nuts. It's a keeper!

I used Mrs. Sigg's pumpkin pie recipe, and added the struesel topping from this recipe. I substituted pecans for the walnuts, and it was a hit!!! Everyone loved it. We had a variety of pies, but everyone wanted this one! This will be a standard addition to my pumpkin pies from here on out. DELICIOUS!

I made this pie for a recent dinner party and it received rave reviews. It is truly the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. I added slivered almonds to the streusel topping since didn't have enough walnuts on hand. I topped it with fresh whipped cream. It was easy to make, and presented beautifully.

This is an awesome recipe.  Everyone loved it!!!  The only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts for the toppings.  My mom wants me to make just the topping to snack on.  I will make these again for Chistmas!

I made this for everyone at work and they all loved it! I had everyone asking for the recipe. I cooked it a bit longer than it says and I used real pumpkin instead of a can.

I've tried making pies before and they are sooo hard to make but this pie was pretty easy and came out tasty too!!  I loved the topping..it was a nice touch and I used a graham cracker crust because I didnt want to make a pie crust so if you're lazy like me, all you have to do is make the filling!  = )
