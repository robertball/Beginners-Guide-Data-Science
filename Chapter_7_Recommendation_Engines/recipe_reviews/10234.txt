Fantastic! I used chocolate covered caramels with great success. I handled these like refrigerator cookies, though. I divided the dough in thirds, rolled into "logs" and wrapped in waxed paper. After an HOUR I took out one log at a time and followed directions from there. This keeps the dough firm enough to work with (to avoid the sticky mess one reviewer complained of). Always get raves with this cookie!

Gave it five stars, but I did make a couple of changes.  Definitely add the extra 1/2 c flour!!! And a pinch of salt didn't hurt either.  I nixed the sugar/nut mixture and rather than those funky chocolate covered caramels, I used old fashioned plain caramels.  WOW!  They were great!  Highly recommend these - but be sure to alter the recipe a bit!

These cookies are WONDERFUL!  My boys love them, and they are now a Christmas tradition.  BUT, I will only make them with butter. It's worth it!

These cookies were a big hit!  I used caramel Hershey's Kisses and only made 1 dozen at a time so the batter could chill in the fridge between batches.

These are great cookies, and great for a cookie party. My aunt and I each made some - I used Milk Duds and she used Rolos and Milk Duds. The Milk Duds didn't melt for eaither of us! So you have this yummy cookie and get to this wad of candy in the middle, kind of a bummer, but still yummy. The Rolos melted just right! I'll use those next time.

This is a great cookie. It almost taste like a brownie. They only thing that I did different was, I didn't add the nuts, just because I don't like nuts. I also didn't add the sugar at the top, just because. I will tell you that they are very messy to make and you MUST work in tiny stages and to make sure not to let the dough get room temp. I did only use the little caramel pieces and not the chocolate covered ones, because they were on sale, of course! They were a hit at my work Christmas party!!!

This is the third time I made these cookies and I mistakingly used this recipe instead of the better one (the one in the website's book). This was the only time that the entire batch of cookies were ruined by being stuck to the pans - a waste of $50 and three hours (between driving, buying the ingredients, preparing, and cooking). I did everything that the recipe called for, and the difference between this recipe and the better one is that this only calls for 30 minutes of cooling time versus a minimum of two hours. Awful recipe. Get the better one.

These were really good.  I used Rolos, did not put nuts in the dough, added ~1/2t. salt, and used melted white chocolate chips to put spirals on the top of the cookies.  I may try a melted caramel drizzle on top next time.

AWESOME!!!    Although I would cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, it was a little too sweet.    I used a Cadbury Caramilk bar for the filling instead and that worked out great.    Putting the chocoloate in the freezer first is also a good trick.

I love these cookies.  I decide not to use the vanilla coating and instead rolled the dough in sugar and crushed pecans.  I use Rolos for the center, and they work great.

I made these last night and the previous reviewer was right-- they are very messy! Unfortunantely, I did not add the extra 1/2 cup of flour which would have helped tremendously, but they still came out OK.  They flattened out in the oven, and did not look like the picture, but the caramel didnt ooze and they still tasted great. I would highly recommend letting the cookies cool for at least  20 min before you try removing them off the pan, because if they do not harden up somewhat you will end up smushing them or they will break apart.

I've been trying to create my own "Rolo" cookie.  This is the PERFECT recipe!  My friend who requested it gets them every for his birthday.  Thank you for putting this out there, it would have taken me forever doing this on my own.

These cookiees are perfect!  Chcolatey and chewy!  I used rolos for the center and did not coat them with anything but a little sugar.  They don't need it!  They are great warm and even better when they have cooled down.  If you take these to any function people will LOVE it!!  They always do!

Really good cookies.  They are my 11 year old's new fave.(And I make a lot of cookies!)  I used butter instead of margarine.  I omitted the nuts and piped on white chocolate swirls once the cookies were cool.  Will make again.  Have to; my kid has not quit asking for them ;).

They were easy to form and I didn't have any problems with the caramel leaking out.  They were good but not stupendous as some of the reviewers seem to think.

The cookies tasted GREAT...although I had a really hard time getting the dough around the caramels.  I had a big sticky mess.  I made it work though...and the cookies were wonderful.  Some of the caramels did "leak" out of the cookies...which created yet another mess...but it was all worth it.  I think I will try again and see if the dough turns out a bit more stiff next time.

Absolutely amazing. Followed the recipe, but added the extra 1/2 c. flour and used softened butter instead per other reviews. Rolled them in half batches leaving the rest in the fridge to stay cool. Cooked them for 8 minutes each and let them finish "cooking" on the sheets out of the oven. I am quite the cookie critic and these were scrumptious, nice and chewy and chocolatey with the gooey caramel center (used rollos). Will definitely do again!

I was careful about making sure the cookie part completely covered the caramel, but the caramel must have melted through... I couldn't get the cookies off the pan! I must say the crumbs were delicious though...

Awesome.  I've made these cookies about 6 times now and everyone loves them.  Use good quality butter because it really affects the flavor of these cookies.  Rolos work prefect, peanut butter cups or Andes mints might be yummy too.

Took these to work and everyone loved them!  One person even wanted the recipe.  I used regular caramels instead of chocolate covered caramels and it was still great.

I added 1 tsp of baking powder.
For caramels I used the caramel bits, about 4 per cookie and folded them in the cookie batter. The batter/dough is fairly stiff. Put cookie batter/dough  together in my KitchenAid stand mixer.
The baking time is very  much off.
 I baked mine 18 minutes instead of the recommended 8-10 minutes... I have two thermometers inside my oven and both read 375 F, so it is not my oven temperature that is off.
One half of the cookie batter I rolled in chopped pecans, the other half of the cookie batter I didn't. My room temperature was 65F but I set the trays with the raw cookie balls in the cooler for 20 minutes.
Once baked, the cookie looked beautiful but it tasted very bland.  I re-checked the recipe and noticed no salt was listed!
Next time, if ever, I'll add 1 tsp of salt.

Every year I say I will never make these again.  Then it comes around and my kids beg for them.  These cookies cause fights in my house.  They are everyone’s favorite.  I use Rolo candy.  I don’t put sugar on top just a little drizzle of white chocolate for looks.

I used 1/2 cup more of flour and then let the Milk Duds sit on a warm stove just before wrapping them in the dough.  They came out perfect!  My family's new favorite.

These are excellent!  I used butter instead of margarine.  I made some with caramel filled Hershey kisses and some with cherry filled Hershey kisses.  I may like the cherry ones the best! There was a slight learning curve making them a uniform size.  Like others, I kept the dough chilled.  The only negative is that the sugar I dipped them in disappeared, so they aren't super attractive, just brown. Didn't do a white chocolate drizzle; that would help. I dusted powder sugar on them to make them look more festive.  I will definitely make them again.

These are my favorite cookies, and I am not a chocolate cookie fan. I love the caramel (rolos only) filling.  I made it as the recipe stated, but I add a 1/2 tsp salt to the batter as one reviewer stated.  I baked for 8 minutes and let cool on pans for 4 minutes. However, as soon as i took them out of the oven, I took my sea salt grinder and did one twist on each cookie followed by a dusting of powdered sugar.  They give a sweet, salty touch...like salt caramel.
Thank you for this recipe.

Great cookie. Did add extra flour & cocoa as suggested. Used caramel hershey kisses but cut tip off to wrap easier. Also used small cookie scoop & then pressed candy in center & molded around it. Some leaked but by end I got the hang of it.Will definitely make them again!

I didn't like the caramels in them the first time so I replaced them with mini marshmallows - they were better - then I tried putting a frozen raspberry in instead and baked them for 11 minutes - this gave them a five star rating.

I followed the cookie batter part of the recipe as written.  But omitted the nuts, sugar & and candy coating for the topping.  Instead of the chocolate covered carmels I used homemade carmel candies from this site.  I would highly recommend the sugar & chocolate topping, as the cookie batter alone was not sweet enough.  The batter was to dry, did not hold together once it was cooked.
