This was actually pretty incredible. Everything I used was organic, from the meat to the vegetables. I used carrots, sweet potato, and butternut squash. The only thing I did differently is add way more spices since I know I prefer a punchier palette and used cubed beef stew meat instead of sirloin. Super comforting and super filling. LOVED IT.

Mmmmm!  I made this tonite for a get-together with another couple.  Our infant daughters even loved it!  I used carrots, parnips, sweet potatoes and a butternut squash.  I adjusted the recipe to use 6 cups of vegetables and we still only had 1 serving left over after we were all done, so I would say double what you think you'll need.  The veggies cooked up nicely and we used apple juice instead of wine and I would definitely say that you do not need to add sugar.  It had great flavor and everyone loved it!

During preparation we decided that the vinegar taste was a little too much for the teenagers, we cut the flavor by adding some sugar and more chicken broth. They devoured the stew, taking second and third helpings. In retrospect I wonder if we should have used the apple juice instead of dry red wine.

Yummm!! I didn't bother with the wine (I'm sure it would be fantastic with it) and used homemade chicken stock I had lying around the freezer.  I used carrots, parsnips, sweet potato and baby potatoes and didn't bother with the mashed potatoes, it tured out great!  10/10 will cook again.

Overall I liked this recipe but the meat came out pretty tough. I used stir-fry sirloin cut up small, and also added green beans for color and crunch towards the end. The broth over mashed potatoes was delicious!

Hubby loved it! Very Healthy too! Had no idea you can use low sodium "Chicken Broth" in a Beef Dinner - But it tasted AWESOME!! Great spices to flavor it perfectly -Tasted like I used Beef broth.  I used fresh thyme, floured my meat after pan frying it (thickened sauce perfectly when mixed with broth) and our winter veggies used- squash, sweet potatoes, carrots, & russet potatoes! - no mashed potatoes needed to serve over.  -Thanks for sharing!- Great Idea & so healthy - Delicious Too!

I didn't like it and probably won't make again.  The "gravy" was very thin and the meat came out tough.  I had to come back and see if I missed an ingredient but I didn't.

Well I didn't like it because I messed it up. I forgot to put the apple juice or wine. I really think forgetting that last bit of liquid really is what messed it up. Also the veggies weren't as tender as I wanted. The steak was tough. I think this recipe would be really good in the crock pot too. Next time I will do that.
