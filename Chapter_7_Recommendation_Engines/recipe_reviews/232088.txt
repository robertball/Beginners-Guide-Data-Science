I made half the recipe, steamed the cauliflower for 3 minutes in the microwave, and used my immersion blender to mash the cauliflower (easy cleanup).  The whipped cream cheese makes this incredibly "creamy," and this is so easy to make. This is the first mashed cauliflower recipe that I would consider an honest-to-goodness replacement for mashed potatoes.   It's not only healthy for you, but it tastes wonderful.

Really good! I used part skim ricotta to lighten it up a bit and I would recommend this recipe for sure.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used regular salt and 1/4 of the garlic. Mine was a little soupy, patting the cauliflower dry was not enough, the water needed to be squeezed out inside a kitchen towel. Also the texture was gummy, just like when you overwork regular mashed potatoes. The flavor was ok, I felt the cream cheese overpowered the dish. The last recipe I tried for these called for roasting the cauliflower in the oven which I think is the better way to go. I like the flavor better and you don't have to ring the water (and the vitamins) out of the cauliflower. Also the food processor was overkill, that lead to the bad texture. Stick with a potato masher.

Umm... yes please??  In a world where potatoes are not an option, cauliflower to the rescue!  I tried this once with sour cream but because I boiled the  out of the 'flower, it was too watery.  It was still delicious.  And yes, I DID eat that bad boy with a straw.  The next day I made sure I had cream cheese on hand and voila!  Awesome fake mashed 'taters.  I should have taken a pic, but while I was thinking about taking said picture, I was eating the subject matter and before I knew it, it was in my belleh.

As far as going back to the real thing? I may never go back.  

Just kidding, yes I will!  But, when it's low-carb time, I'll be buying myself 'flowers...

After halving the amount of cream cheese and using regular versus whipped, my family loved this recipe! I will definitely be making it again as it is such an easy way to get my five-year-old to eat cauliflower.  I also steamed the cauliflower instead of boiling.  Incredibly easy and very tasty side dish!
Update: another variation is to cook up to 4 cloves of garlic in extra virgin olive oil, cut down the cream cheese to about 2 ounces, and enjoy an extra garlic-y delight!

Interesting recipe. I did not have whipped cream cheese, so I subbed 4 light laughing cow garlic and herb wedges.  I slightly undercooked the cauliflower and the mashed blend was a bit grainy which is easily corrected by cooking slightly longer.  It paired well with a baked tilapia loin (seasoned with a hint of grated parm. cheese and some of the Lawry's seasoning salt) and a hodgepodge blend of frozen vegetables from Trader Joes.  We will have again when we're in the mood for something different.

Very tasty! I would never have thought to make cauliflower this way. It even looks like mashed potatoes on the plate! We had it with a sirloin roast and a stir-fry medley of veggies, and it was great with or without the gravy. I streamlined it a bit: put the whole head of cauliflower into the pressure cooker for about 10 minutes on high, let cool a bit, then cored and simply mashed it smooth with a potato masher. I had an 8 oz. container of garlic-and-herb whipped cream cheese and put half of it in, tasted it and dumped the rest in. Sooo good! I did then whip with my hand blender, but I don't think that it was necessary and won't bother to next time. And that was it. No need for more garlic or any salt, it was already perfect. I did add some black pepper--but then I usually pepper everything. Next time my (grown) kids are here, I will make this without saying anything and see if they even notice - especially since I always put parmesan in my mashed potatoes  : )

I have to admit I put off fixing mashed cauliflower because I thought it would never be able to measure up to potatoes. NOT SO!! This recipe was delicious and I definitely will not hesitate to fix this over and over. YUM!

I made these and they were awesome . Instead of using cream cheese I used sour cream and for liquid I used chicken stock. Another time I made them and added some fresh dill. I have also used them with ground turkey to make a healthier version of shepherds pie.

I love cauliflower, so don't get me wrong - my first impression was not so good.  I eat a lot of raw veggies to include cauliflower, but the thought of mashed cauliflower seemed absurd and not pleasing at all.  But, since my daughter is a diabetic and we are always on the look-out for something creative to cook.  Months ago, she casually mentioned mashed cauliflower and I just smiled & nodded.  When this recipe came across my email, I thought...hmmm.  I am so glad I gave it a whirl!  I was so pleased! The only substitution was I used plain 'ol salt & pepper instead of seasoned salt just because it was a habit when making mashed potatoes.  Next time, I'll remember to pull out my seasoned salt. PS...No butter needed!  This was fabulous and there were no left overs in my house!  Thank you for sharing this recipe...definitely a keeper!

A big surprise. 
Wanted to try cauliflower as a change from potatoes. Steamed the cauliflower mashed it with fresh garlic and Old Bay Seasoning. That's all. Baked it for 25 minutes then grated sharp cheddar on top and baked another 5 minutes. 
Really, really good. Served it with baked bread as our starch. My husband LOVED IT.
Thanks for this interesting twist on an old favorite. Cauliflower rules!

Added a tbsp of butter, and used garlic salt instead of minced.  Delicious!  My potato loving boyfriend didn't notice the substitution until his plate was cleared.  Also, using the immersion blender is a treat, much better than mashing potatoes by hand!

I microwaved frozen cauliflower in a cover dish until tender.  While hot I added a 1/4 block of light cream cheese and season salt and 1/4 tsp minced garlic. I used a hand masher but might try immersion blender. Very easy and good!

Gave this to my husband and his first words were "We need to buy another Cauliflower" I agree! This is a great substitute for mashed potato. I didnt have whipped cream cheese, so I used regular block cream cheese but a much smaller portion. Turned out great.

Delicious! I am learning to like cauliflower and loved this recipe (the cream cheese helped a lot)! Next time I might add a little less cream cheese.

It tasted too much like mushy cauliflower , the consistency was soupy and I let the cauliflower drain before adding ti back the pot with cream cheese and remaining ingredients. I will try it again, maybe this time letting it sit our for 20 minutes to get all of the water off.

WOW! I was skeptical. And I forgot to buy the whipped cream cheese so I had to use 1/4 cup of the regular light cream cheese and 1/4 cup of regular light sour cream.  These were awesome! As a diabetic I needed to find something to replace potatoes and this definitely does the trick.  Although we had the first time with a gravy, hubby said they'd be good even with butter only.  Hubby doesn't really care for potatoes so this makes him pretty happy too.  So glad to add this to my regular side dish rotation.

did not have whipped cream cheese. Used Boursin herbed cheese instead. the garlic was a bit too much for me. Not necessary. Aside from that, really loved it  and will make it again.

My husband made this and we liked it well enough ... for a base. Admittedly we do a lot of flavor in our house so instead of telling you how we like it and didn't make it (in the end) according to recipe I will say - it is a stand up recipe all on it's own and easily adaptable to any palate, even after you've completed it according to the recipe!

I've had mashed cauliflower before and this was way better, and so simple. Sooooo good! I did not miss the potatoes at all. I will definitely be making it again. I agree with some other reviewers that it does need a tiny bit more salt... I only use lower sodium salt, and I don't know if that matters. Thank you for sharing!

Will certainly make this again.  We have bought frozen mashed cauliflower and enjoyed it.  This recipe wasn't difficult.  I didn't have whipped cream cheese so softened mine in the food processor with a little sour cream before adding the cooked cauliflower.  It turned out great.  Before serving I added chives.  We had this with low carb chicken marsala.  It was a yummy dinner!

I thought they were very good, but my husband wasn't too crazy about them.  But we're going to make them again anyway.

Boring!  Whipped cream cheese didn't add much flavor. This dish is in desperate need of something. I'm going to see how Chef John would prepare this.

My first time trying these so I followed the directions exactly. It turned out pretty good! I drained the cauliflower and you do need to pat it dry with a few paper towels. I added it to the processor while it was still fairly hot and it blended well. A little lumpy, but has the consistency of mashed potatoes. I will definitely make this again.

It turned out wonderful. My cauliflower was already pulverized so I only had to microwave it for 3 min. I put it on paper towels which were on a dish towel and just twisted.  I reduced the cream cheese by 1/2 and used whipping cream to make the  process easier with my stick blender.  It tastes really good and I will make it this way again.

I used a vegetable steamer to cook the cauliflower  and an immersible  blender to mash it. While mashing, I added 2 tablespoons of flaked instant potatoes. The flaked helped absorb any extra moisture and added a creamy texture. After mashing  all ingredients until creamy, I added a tablespoon of  lite butter. Yummy.

The taste was ok, but the texture was awful. It was not smooth like potatoes at all, you really need to put this in a food processor if that's what you're going for.

I've been making this recipe, or a facsimile, for a long time now.  I never boil the cauliflower as there's too much water residue.  I steam the flowerets in a colander over boiling water for about 8 - 10 minutes.  Even with just the basic of about a tsp of olive oil and a little salt and pepper, it is very tasty.  Adding cream cheese, or a little whipping cream, a little garlic, (powdered or fresh), butter, or different herbs, makes it such a lovely side dish that goes with just about anything.  A little grated cheese works well too. My small food processor handles a medium sized cauliflower easily.

I used a potato masher instead of a processor, and used garlic powder rather than garlic cloves.  I did not enjoy the taste; far too much cream cheese.  I'll probably try it again with at least half the cream cheese.  The texture was okay, but again I think it was the amount of cream cheese that threw me off.

Wound up very watery & had to cook the water out for about 5 minutes. Did not mash well and was very gritty. Had no flavor to it at all.

I liked this as I am a big cauliflower fan. It was a bit too much garlic for me and I will cut that back a bit next time. I steamed instead of boiled so I didn't have the worry about moisture. I will make it again.

I love cauliflower but I did not care for it cooked this way at all. My daughter also loves cauliflower but would not eat this. It was grainy and the texture just didn't do it any justice. The uncooked garlic was to over powering.

I've made Mock Mashed Potatoes many times and love it!! Thought I'd try this recipe for a change of pace, because we loved the idea of fresh garlic to spice it up. BEWARE! We ended up tossing the entire thing down the garbage disposal. Two cloves of garlic doesn't seem like much when you're sauteing it, but remember that you're eating it RAW in this recipe, and garlic cloves run the gamut in size. My husband couldn't even eat it, and he'll consume just about anything! My suggestion for this recipe would be to state the EXACT amount of fresh garlic to be added, such as 1/4 tsp. minced. Or even a bit of garlic granules or powder. I left the garlic cloves whole, since I added them to the Vita Mix blender with the other ingredients. As much as we enjoy garlic, I'd omit it next time, or use one very small clove. As a side note, the Vita Mix liquifies the cauliflower too much.  I'd use a masher or an immersion blender. A bit of freshly grated Parmesan cheese is an excellent addition.

Absolutely a keeper!  I used 1/2 bar Neufchatel Cheese and minced garlic. 

Made this again tonight - since I didn't have whipped cream cheese on hand, I used 1/4c reg cream cheese and 1/4c sour cream and it was divine!
