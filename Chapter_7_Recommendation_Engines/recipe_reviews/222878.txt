I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka in this recipe. For me, I liked it but there was a little too much cream and not enough vodka. I think cut back on the half-n-half by an ounce and up the vodka to an ounce or so then it would be perfect.

I used chocolate syrup to decorate glasses. I followed recipe except that I used 1 oz of whipped vodka and only 1 oz of whipping cream. Then I made a chocolate swirl on top with the syrup.

This came out fantastically. A wonderfully boozy take on dessert. love the creaminess of the half-n-half.

I substituted Heavy Cream for the Half and Half and all agreed that it tasted better.

Love, love, love it! Godiva chocolate liqueur is the only way to go! I agree with another review, cut back on the creamer and add slightly more vodka so it isn't quite so sweet. Still a fabulous drink.

I used 1 1/2 oz Vanilla Vodka and cut back to 1 oz of half and half. Also do a chocolate swirl in the glass.
