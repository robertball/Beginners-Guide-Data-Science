This is my 3rd year using this recipe.  I took other suggestions this year and baked it in a covered pan.  I poured a can of chicken broth over it and also added some turkey drippings for a moist texture.  It was great.  I think we'll prepare it outside of the bird in the future.

This was a very good stuffing; just old fashioned with no frills. Changes made are as follows --- used sage pork sausage instead of adding in the 2 tsp of the spice at the end --- only used 1 large granny smith apple ---* the onion used was very large, so only put 1/2 of it in --* doubled the amount of poultry seasoning --- * placed in a 9 x 13 pan and poured a 14 oz. can of chicken broth over the top to keep moist ---* covered w/aluminum foil and baked at 325 degree for 30 minutes, then upped the temp to 350, removed the foil, stirred it and baked for another 30 minutes.  Stuffing came out very moist with a crunchy exterior, just the way I like it.  Next time I might add in a bay leaf or 2 as well.

The recipe makes enough stuffing for 10-12 people.  People loved the meat stuffing, it was a great change.  We added 1 can of chicken stock and baked it in trays (not stuffed in the turkey).

This was the first time I have made stuffing from scratch. It was mouth watering good! I added 1 cup of homemade chicken stock to the stuffing mixture and baked it in a tray. Also used day old white bread for the bread cubes. I will definitely make this again!

This was my first time making my own stuffing, so I was a little nervous...but it came out great! I have no complaints. However, my husband said it tasted a little salty, so I will probably omit adding salt next time.

I love this recipe and so does my family.  My Mom doesn't make stuffing anymore because she likes this better than her own!  I make extra as dressing and moisten it with apple cider.  YUMMY!!!  Thank you Grandma Reid!

I LOVED this recipe, my husbands family, not so much. But then, they think the pinacle of success is the stuff from the stovetop box. I thought it was super yummy, with the ingrediants giving it something that stovetop could never create.

Fabulous. Very similar to my family recipe however we never used apple. The addition of apple is excellent. I always use some chicken stock as well.

Lots of chopping but probably worth it.  Got a compliment from a friend. Leave bread out for one whole day. Added a little extra garlic. Poured a can of chicken broth over the top.  Cooked it at 325 for 30 min. covered.  Then uncovered for 30 min at 350.

I've made this many a time, but haven't done the garlic (yet). Besides chicken stock as others have added, I have also added a diced carrot, craisins, and chopped walnuts.

I liked it a lot.  Next time I will use a bit more seasoning and a bit more sausage.

So I'm weird and don't personally like sausage, no problem! I just use the original recipe without the sausage, and its phenomenal. I usually bake it separately in a baking pan with a quart of chicken stock or brother to keep it moist while it cooks. Last year, I cooked it the night before regular, and then right before serving, I added a little more broth in the mixture and baked it until warm, turned out perfectly and eliminated some Thanksgiving day cooking time!

Big hit! I used spicy sausage and followed recipe.  The only thing I added was the can of chicken stock over mixture which I think helped with moistness without being soggy.  I left my bread cubes out over night to dry out. I think if you use fresh bread it would be soggy. I got lots of compliments. I cooked it in a pan, not in turkey. I stirred halfway through. I will be making this again.

The addition of pork sausage and apples to bread stuffing always has been a favorite of mine, and I've made similar recipes many times.  I cooked a turkey breast, so I baked the stuffing in a casserole dish.  I added quite a bit of chicken broth to moisten the stuffing, and I would have added chicken broth even if I were stuffing the turkey with it.  IMO this makes a lot more than 6 servings, and I doubt this much stuffing would even fit inside a 10-12 turkey. Particularly if you're making it for a holiday, like Thanksgiving, where you  typically have many side dishes.  It tasted good!
