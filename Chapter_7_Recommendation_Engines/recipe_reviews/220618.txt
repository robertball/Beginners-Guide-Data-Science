Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect! I made them on St. Patty's day morning and my guests raved about them. Be careful not to over bake because the tops do not brown. You need to watch the sides. Next time I'll try it with the cup of Baileys and maybe some green food coloring! Thanks for recipe!

I made these for St. Patrick's day to take to work.. had leftover Baily's from another recipe. made one batch with all irish cream and found it needed some texture. I added some mixed nuts and that seemed to help. These weren't bad muffins just not my taste.

These muffins have a nice taste but I would change the name to 'Basic Breakfast Muffins'. They are plain muffins and the Bailey's & whiskey taste are not detected at all after baking.

I made half a batch and used a whole egg and all Bailey's instead of milk and whiskey. I threw in a few chocolate chips also. They were moist and tasted great. The Bailey's flavor was strong and I'm glad I put the chocolate chips in. Anything like nuts or fruit would be a good addition; I don't think I'd like these as much plain. Thanks for a fun recipe that I'll probably try again sometime.

2 teaspoons Baileys for 12 muffins??? Just made some last week and used 1/2 cup Baileys while reducing the milk by the same amout. They were delicious!
