Perhaps it was the cream of tartar, the nonfat dry milk powder or both that caused me not to care for these much.  The texture was different from any other biscuit I've tried or made (somewhat dry and crumbly), as was the flavor. I swear I could taste the dry milk and think these would be better if made with just regular cold, fresh milk. In addition, my oven temperature is accurate yet I found even at 18 minutes the biscuits were a little overdone. Maybe these "pioneer biscuits," as the submitter identified them, will appeal to others but unfortunately they will not be a "Make again!" for me.

These were yummy! DS made them all by himself and they turned out light and fluffy. We did scale the recipe to six and got eight biscuits (used a regular mouth Mason ring for a cutter). Easy enough for a twelve year old!
