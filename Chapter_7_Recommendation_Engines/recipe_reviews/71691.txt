The recipe "caught my eye" due to poor reviews.  Read recipe/reviews. Was sure it wasn't recipe at fault but the reviewers as most probaby don't know what a SPONGE/FOAM cake is, nor do they understand the concept of mixing procedure, texture & very light flavor of THESE cakes.  It IS NOT a American heavy textured/flavored cake. I'm a profess. pastry chef/instructor. I make these cakes everyday/know the texture & very light flavor of these cakes are what makes them special. Sponge-type (also known as foam) cakes, depend on beaten eggs for their light, airy texture, the mixing & folding procedule is VERY important as the batter can deflate before it even goes into the oven. Because it has no butter/oil it is lighter in texture, the flavors are very slight. They DO NOT require a frosting, only a little Whip Cr. & fruit. Think of it as Angel Food Cake. I wk in an Asian bakery, this is like our cakes only sweeter.  Made this w/extra TBL of expresso & cocoa. Baked in 8" Springform pan-3" hi. Rose 2 3/4", deflated (which is what they do) to 2 1/2". Removed deflated sugary crusted top, split cake. Lined pan ring with acetate strip, put 1/2 cake in bottom of ring. Cut strawberries in 1/2, place along edge of cake, filled center w/whip.cr & sliced strawb. Added 2nd 1/2 of cake, piped whip cr. on top,added fresh strawberries. Removed pan ring to display cake. It was beautiful & declicious. THANKS for sharing recipe. Important & recom. all read about Sponge/Foam cakes to understand them.

It was light and fluffy, but it was very disappointing and lacked flavor. I replaced the coffee flavored liqueur with more chocolate, and it sure didn’t make a difference. It was very bland, and nobody liked it. My brother wouldn’t even touch it after a bite, and that says something.

I saw all the bad reviews and I tried it out of curiosity. It's an excellent recipe if you make a few changes. It was delicious, light, airy and soft. I increased the cocoa powder to a heaping tablespoon, Instead of chocolate flavored liqueur I used one tablespoon of good quality vanilla. Instead of espresso I used 1 tbsp of Nescafe crystals and 1 tablespoon of Kahlua. There was enough to fill both pans. I think the main reason people don't like it is because they don't know how to separate eggs or to beat whites to stiff peaks. I used superfine sugar and eggs at room temperature. Overall it's very satisfactory and only needs to be baked for 15 minutes at most! I used a chocolate ganache on top and a vanilla whipped cream to sandwich the two cakes together. Everyone loved it.

A'ight - so, I decided to give this recipe a try despite the horrible reviews, because the only complaints seemed to be about the flavour. I doubled the sugar, and put in more than double the original amount of coffee and cocoa. Everything else I did according to the recipe. It came out nice and spongy and the family liked it, although the recipe only made enough batter to fill one cake pan. Nevertheless, I thought it was tasty and made a good spongy cake, and it wasn't hard the next morning. I'm going to try it again with even more sugar and coffee next time.

apparently, not everyone appreciate what the cake is all about. Asian mocha cakes are very light and airy. They are not as sweet as typical American cakes or European cakes. If you make a butter mocha frosting it will compliment this cake very well.

Me, and my friend decided to ignore the other review. We made it any ways.  It was rock hard the next day. It tasted like a bran muffin but with less flavor. We didn't care for this.

Really light and yummy.  I made a whipped cream filling and a dark chocolate ganache glaze on top.  The cake itself is a little sweet for me, so I'll cut back on sugar next time! O, this cake does NOT need to bake more than 15 minutes.  Otherwise, it was a nice spongey cake (not as good as other Asian bakery mocha cakes, but pretty darn good for homemade).

This recipe is missing something...I made it as a bunt cake and once removed from the oven, I noticed it was pretty dry so I took a toothpick and made tiny holes all over the cake, then seperetely,  I took 2 cups of boiling water, added 2 tablespoons of instant coffee, 2 tablespoons of hot chocolate and 2 tablespoons of coffee liquor (I chose Tia Maria) added 3 tablespoons of sugar and mixed it all together, then poured  it all over the cake while it was still in the pan and continued to cook for 2 more minutes.....Amazing.  Please try this and let me know what you think...Mia

did no one notice that the recipe does not say when to add the chocolate liqueur?  after reading the recipe and following directions, i realized that my $20 bottle of godiva chocolate liqueur was sitting in the counter unopened.  my bad, but i find this happens fairly frequently on this website - hopefully, after adding it to the batter, the cake will still rise.

I tried the recipe and I liked it. I think my cake would turn out better if I whipped the egg whites well. And also if I used sugar as instructed instead of honey.I don`t use sugar that`s why my cakes never turn out as they should. Everyone must try this recipe, it`s great. Thank you Kimberly D.

This cake came out great! As serving sizes go... a double batch should serve 24 people?! NO WAY. My bundt holds the double batch, has 9 bumps, and half a bump (18 servings) is very modest. Most people will want a whole bump. :) I did make some changes. Someone following this recipe perfectly might think it was bland. I wanted strong flavors. Quadrupled the coffee and chocolate, and left out liquors. 45 minute bake at 350°. Beating the separated eggs and incorporating them properly is key to making this cake. Amazed at how little sugar and flour is used, and there's no grease besides what lines the pan. Some might say the cake isn't sweet enough, but those people need to learn that "sweet" doesn't equal flavor.  
Well, it was the BF's birthday, so I did sweeten it up a little bit more, by adding 6 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips, a very thin caramel glaze and some nuts and sugar on top for decoration.  The chocolate chips sank straight to the bottom of the bundt, which resulted in a thickish layer of chocolate on the top of the cake.  That was actually a little hard to cut through prettily, but it tasted fantastic.  I can't say I particularly tasted my caramel glaze though.  I made it too thin.  None of those additional things really affected the cake part so much that I couldn't tell it would be perfectly delicious without them, and could be suitable for more frequent indulgence that way. I am going to make another one ASAP!

As others have already commented, I believe those who do not care for this recipe do not understand sponge cakes.  This is a wonderful cake with great texture and flavor.

The instructions fail to tell when to to add the liqueurs.  I added them into the batter at the same time I added the espresso mixture in step 3.

I used a decorative tube pan to bake my cake.  I did NOT grease the pan!  (I never grease pans for sponge cakes.)  I baked the cake for 48 minutes.  I poked several holes in the cake and poured the following mixture over the cake:

1/2 c. hot water
1-1/2 tsp. instant espresso
1 tsp. coffee liqueur
1 tsp. chocolate liqueur

I then put the cake bake into the oven for 5 more minutes.  After those 5 minutes, I hung it on a glass bottle until it cooled completely (about 2 hours).  I used a plastic knife to loosen the cake from the pan, put it on a cake plate, and inverted it.  Beautiful!  I decorated it with berries and confectioner's sugar to make it more beautiful.  The taste was terrific.  Next time I make this, though, I am going to reduce the sugar by a tablespoon or two.

I tried this recipe but I made slight changes instead of coffee I used chocolate powder and the taste was better. Anyways children always enjoy chocolate taste.
