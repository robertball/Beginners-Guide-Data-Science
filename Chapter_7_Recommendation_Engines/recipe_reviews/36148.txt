This recipe was a beginning for me just now. I added finely chopped celery,a good amount of chopped fresh basil, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and about 2 tbl of a Lite Italian Dressing, and a heavy sprinkling of a No Salt Seasoning. This is tasting very good now. I felt it was too bland before, and too much of the papaya flavor came thru. Papaya is ok until the after taste hits. Ick. I am trying now to remember why I bought the ugly thing in the first place. But, I thank the submitter for sharing and allrecipes.com for posting it.This salad turned out great with my additions.

Love Love Love This salad!   It's good as is, but it is GREAT with some added fruits like blueberries and any other wonderful summer fruits!  i see pineapple, mangos, and melons mixed in there too~  I put only blueberries in THIS time, but next time...look out :-)

This is wonderful I did add a few seeds because I like the peppery taste and I did not add dressing.  Wonderful side for a nice hot day.
