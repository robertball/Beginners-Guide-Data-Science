I've seen it done.  I know it can be done.  And now I'm sure this is not the recipe to do it with.  I even made 2 batches thinking I was the problem.  I adjusted the heat, the cooking time, and even thinned out the batter.  Unless you're looking for an exercise in frustration, don't bother even trying this one.

This recipe worked well when I made it on my griddle.  It works better when the pan isn't greased (I used butter).  It has to be spread very thin and be quite brown before removal, or else it remains soft and floppy, more like a crepe.  Also, I beat the egg whites, but I would recommend leaving them unbeaten, so that they will not puff up so when cooked.  Thanks for this!
