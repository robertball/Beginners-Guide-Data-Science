This recipe is really good! didnt follow it exactly, tho. I used less water throughout because by the end, it would be too watery. I was a little worried that it would end up being a soup but the tomato sauce thickens it up. used probably half of the sugar called for because i didnt want it to be too sweet as well. I also switched out the bell peppers for frozen sweet peas instead.

I made this because I was missing my momâ€™s Filipino home cooking.  Easy to make and it is definitely a Filipino comfort food for me and my family.

Great recipe to follow. I was craving this dish after returning from my trip to the Philippines and it came out just as I imagined it to be!! I used beef stock instead of water and just eyed how much I needed. Used one potato instead. Brown sugar 3 table spoons.

Very good, but I think I needed to add more water to make a sauce.

One of my favorite childhood dishes. This recipe is really yummy, thank you! Also thank your excluding the peas. 

I agree with previous poster. I did not add all the water because I was afraid it was getting too soupy. Next time I'll start with 2 tbsp of sugar and work my way up. The 4 tbsp was a bit sweet for my personal preference so I added more soy sauce and salt to balance.
