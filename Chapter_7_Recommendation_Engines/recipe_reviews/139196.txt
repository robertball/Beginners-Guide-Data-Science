I followed this to the letter, except I doubled the recipe.  If you do choose to double it, do NOT add double the water, just add as needed.  Mine came out too watery, so it didn't have as much flavor as it should.  I think this did need some Cajun spice added to it.  I sprinkled Zatarain's Cajun season blend on individual servings.  Good basic recipe!

This was great! I left out the black/cayenne pepper and used Tony's cajun seasoning in it's place. We are used to more gravy so we added a can of cream of celery soup also.  We cooked our rice in a rice pot/cooker.  This will def be added to our regular menu.  Would be good with shrimp also! Thanks!!!!

I had an etouffee dish in Houston 10 years ago.  I have always ordered etouffee when I could find it on the menu at home in Ohio, it was never the same.  This was really close, so happy I tried this recipe.  Did some tweaking, can't find real crawfish in Ohio so I substituted Langostinos. I don't have cajun seasoning so I used Old Bay sprinkled on plus a dash or two of cayenne and a little pepper.  Tasted and thought I needed more pepper, accidentally opened the wrong side and dumped a good teaspoon of pepper into the dish, it was perfect!  I like spicy but not super hot.  I used the mushroom garlic soup and used the minced roasted garlic in a jar.  This was fabulous!  Thank you!

Very Good, the only change I made was to add Rotel-Mild.  My wife says it is the best she has ever had, can't get enough.  Very good over a Rib-eye.

This was a very quick and easy etouffee recipe. My husband and I had to add some hot sauce to it, but it was perfect for my 6 yr. old.

Very simple to make with only about ten minutes of prep work.  I ended up using about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne, with 1/2 tsp  pepper/salt.  Delicious, and well received at dinner.

I grew up on Cajun food and am super picky when comes to anything Cajun related. My grandmother spoiled me. This recipe is the “cheat” way I like to call it by using Cream of Mushroom. It sure does beat stirring a roux for hours! I added a spoon of Kary’s (the already made roux in a jar) to my Holy Trinity (the veggies) after sautéing them in butter for a while. I used 3 packs of crawfish therefore I used 3 cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup and filled each can up with water (i like getting all the soup off the can too) for my recipe. You always use the same amount of cans of soup that you would as packs crawfish. Instead of her seasonings I added Slap Ya Mama (because it’s less salty and better than Tony’s in my opinion and I grew up on Tony’s) andi added paprika for coloring! Add the crawfish in last so you don’t over cook.  It was to die for!!!! Highly recommend this recipe! I am so thankful to have found it because it’s really close to my mom’s. I’m thinking it might be even better! 10 stars!

I admit to being very skeptical with the absence of roux and the addition of a can of cream of mushroom soup.  But it totally works! It was a lot easier than other recipes I've tried, and with the addition of some hot sauce at the end, (for me, since I like it spicier than the rest of my family) it was perfect!

Quick and easy with great taste....I changed a few things added Tony's Cajun seasoning, added a chopped fresh tomato when I was simmering the rest of the ingredients. Boy was it a winner.
