My favorite additions to this pizza are to spread a little cream cheese on the crust before topping with the chicken and barbecue sauce. I also like to use canned green chiles instead of bell pepper and top it all off with crumbled bacon. Yum!

Even with the 5 star rating, I had my doubts about this recipe because it was so simple.  I was wrong!  It was delicious.  I left out all the veggies because we don't care for them.  It was still incredible.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket and shredded it.  Better than any frozen BBQ chicken pizza you can buy and as good or better than those I've had in restaurants.

My hubby and I LOVE this recipe-- have made it several times already. I use Kraft honey BBQ sauce, yellow onion, and cheddar and mozarella cheeses and still comes out fantastic! I also saute the onion and pepper quickly before putting on the pizza. Yum!

I really wasn't too sure that I'd like the taste of this, but I was curious so I made it. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised. Even our 1-year-old ate a decent amount of it. I actually made two mini pizzas and didn't really follow the quantities specified in the recipe. I just used the amount of sauce, peppers, onion, chicken and cheese that seemed appropriate. The only differences I made were the facts that I didn't have a red onion or monteray jack cheese, so I substituted white onion and used mozzarella and cheddar shredded cheese. Quite easy! Thanks!

The success of this recipe seems to be highly dependent on the BBQ sauce you use - the stuff I used didn't taste that great, but I'll try it again with a different, milder sauce.

I'm a big fan of BBQ chicken pizza & when I saw this recipe I had to try it! I stuck to the recipe as close as I could with some additions. I didn't have
any grilled chicken, so I used canned. I also subbed roasted red peppers. I added sliced fresh mushrooms, jalapenos & a sprinkle of garlic powder before putting the cheese on. I was very pleased with the results. Next time, I will add black olives. I will make this again & again,& I look forward to experimenting some more with the recipe.

I will definitely make this one again.  It is such a nice change from the traditional, heavy-on-the-fatty-meat pizzas.

Very good - just didn't have everything...sooooo like everyone else who has a brain...I improvised...1.) no pizza crust, used half loaf of Italian bread I had left over from my sgetti dinner last nite, 2.) used onion, green pepper (all I had) 3.) sharp cheddar cheese, put onions, peppers in skillet first, then mixed with the chicken that I had mixed the BBQ sauce with, and heated that before I mixed them all.  I also spread a lite layer of BBQ sauce on the bread before adding the chick/onion/pepper mix, then topped it off with sharp cheddar. Put that baby in the oven (preheated to 400) for 10 minutes, and OMG (my mouth is watering now) It was better than I expected. Just my version, and thanks for the recipe....God I love this site!  Thanks again, you people make my people think I am some kinda chef!!!

I make this actually on the BBQ. I mix Thai sauce with some tomato sauce instead of BBQ sauce which gives it a kind of sweetish tang. The pizza cooks very fast on th BBQ. We really love it.

What a great change!  I poached 1 lb. of boneless chicken, then shredded and tossed with BBQ sauce.  I used my homemade pizza crust, then spread a then layer of same BBQ sauce.  Sprinkled the chicken, finely diced red onion and finely diced red pepper.  I finished with shredded cheddar.  Would also be great cooked in a square pan and cut small for appetizers.  Will definitely be made again!

This was an excellent recipe. I tried it two weeks ago and thought it was good but a little to much bbq. And I made it again last night except instead of putting the bbq sauce down then the chicken. I shredded the chicken and mixed the bbq sauce in with it till I got a consistency I thought would be good...thank you very much for the recipe!!!

Oh my goodness, this is wonderful! I used the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust from this site. I used leftover bbq chicken sandwich meat, and a cherry bbq sauce spread thinly over the crust.  I only had shredded colby jack, and it was delicious!  I will make this again for sure!

I loved it, wife loved it. Used sweet baby *ays chipotle bbq sauce, diced the peppers, used a lil salsa Verde mixed into the bbq sauce, skipped the yellow or red onions in favor of dived green onion shoots. Colby jack/mozzarella, and topped with fresh green onion and cilantro. Fricken fabulous

Excellent!  I used rotisserie chicken.  I highly recommend carmalizing your onion and roasting your red pepper (I left out the green).  If you have never roasted a pepper, don't be intimidated!   It's actually EASIER than chopping raw pepper!   You can roast in oven/broiler.  It's a snap

I used a little more sauce than the recipe called for and I think it would've been better had I stuck with the original amount. (On mine, the BBQ sauce was a little overpowering.) I also cooked the green pepper and onions before adding it to the pizza b/c I don't really like a strong onion taste or the crunch that comes along with it. I shredded a piece of chicken breast that I'd let cook in the crock pot until it was falling apart and then placed it back in the crock pot with BBQ sauce to simmer for about 30 minutes. Put the BBQ sauce & chicken on homemade dough (cheaper than pre-made) and then put the onions and pepper on, followed by the cheese. Pretty good, but even better the 2nd day!

This was great!  I used homemade crust and homemade BBQ sauce with mozzarella instead of monterey jack (don't have that in Germany).  Also, I sauteed the onions and peppers for a few minutes in the same pan I cooked the chicken in.  It was great!  Will definitely make again.

Delicious and easy.  I used left over chicken and Pillsbury pizza crust.  I sauteed the peppers and onions with olive oil spray before I put on the pizza.  I also used 2 cups of cheese and about 1 1/2 cups of BBQ sauce.  Wonderful!!!!

This was a great Pizza! I bought a dough from a local pizza parlor instead of making my own due to time restraints and it was delicious! Loved the blend of the BBQ sauce, red onion, and MJ cheese! I am definitely adding this to my collection.

This is an amazing pizza. I have made it as directed and I have also added and taken away ingredients. My favorite way is to not add the peppers but add mushrooms and crisped bacon pieces, also add fresh basil on top after baking. So very tasty! Thanks for sharing.

This is me and my husbands favorite thing. I use the "just add water" pizza mix for the crust. The first time I made it, I used some left over chicken, and it tasted a little dry. Now whenever I have left over chicken, I add a half cup of BBQ sauce, so it can marinate over night, and it turns out absolutely perfect.

Very good. I had the good fortune to come across this recipe when I had some leftover grilled chicken and a pizza shell in the refrigerator. I did not use quite as much sauce as the recipe calls for, and I used a mix of cheeses - that's what was on hand. The red pepper adds a lot. I used hickory flavored bbq sauce - we prefer the smokey taste of this to the regular bottled red stuff. Thanks for the recipe.

My wife made this recipe for dinner tonight, It was delicious!!  The two things she did differantly were use cheddar cheese, and add cilantro.   This turned out perfect and I was quick to add it to my recipe index.

I love BBQ chicken pizza! This recipe makes it so easy to substitute what you have. I used yellow bell peppers (instead of red and green), yellow onion (instead of red), and a combination of cheddar and pepper jack cheeses (instead of Monterey Jack).

My two 10 year old nephews loved this pizza!! I got the personal pan pizza crusts from the Dollar Tree, (2 in a pack) and they were actually really good! I think the key is to use as simple a BBQ sauce as possible, I got the $.99 honey BBQ sauce from Aldi.  I fed two growing boys very inexpensively lol.  Thanks for the idea!

I used Pillsbury Pizza Dough, and took another reviewer's advices on using cream cheese before spreading the BBQ sauce and other ingredients.  I had a little bit of Kraft Zesty Honey BBQ Sauce left, so I used that up and then used Kraft Honey BBQ sauce.  I didn't have red onions, but think they would have been outstanding.  I used yellow onions instead.  I also put Turkey Bacon on top of the cheese before putting it in the oven, and seasoned our chicken with garlic salt before grilling on the george foreman to cook.

Like those before me, I wasn't sure this would taste good! We made two, one with vegies and one w/o. It was a big hit, even with our 3 teenagers! We also used the precooked chicken, which saved on time and still tasted delish!

It was pretty good, I did add blue cheese to one of the pizzas I made, just to experiment a little and it tasted really good I didn't really have any peppers but I was adding spinach and arugula to a couple of the pizzas and they turned out very tasty.

BBQ chicken pizza is great. I would add that it's even better if you saute your onion & peppers ahead of time to get that carmelized taste. I make a version of this recipe with store bought whole BBQ chicken and also I put my chicken in BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Rays is great ) and warm as this permeats chicken with sauce, even better.

This was awesome! I used a boboli crust and added some cilantro, and just pre cooked the chicken with some olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Not sure if I followed the measurements exactly, I just put on the amounts that looked to me, and we all loved it!

This is a quick meal go to for us, I pick up the ingredients from our store's salad bar and can have it ready in 12 minutes! I've taken it to dinner club with rave reviews and only a little shame that I have to invest any time into it. :)

Pretty tasty and so easy to make! I used a Boboli pre-baked crust (thin), a rotisserie chicken, and a honey barbeque sauce because I like it on the sweet side. If you don't, go with a regular or mesquite. I sauteed the veggies for about 2 minutes to soften them up a bit. I also added some chopped green onions and fresh basil. The result was a very pretty pizza that tasted great! Thanks for the super easy recipe.

We liked this recipe but with a number of modifications.  Here is what I did: I used a Boboli pizza crust and spread a small amount of Kraft Honey BBQ sauce (The BEST tip I can give you is to use your BBQ sauce extremely sparingly -- a couple of tablespoons spread thinly will go a LONG way -- you don't want to overdo it, or it will dominate the flavor of your pizza).  Next, I spread a load of freshly grated Mont Jack cheese. I then chopped up a handful of white meat from a rotisserie chicken and sprinkled it on top.  Next, I chopped up about a 1/3 c. of red onion and sauteed it in butter, then added it to the pizza.  Finally, I topped it off with a light sprinkling of cheddar and mozzarella that I had on hand.  Baked it for about 10-12 minutes.  Delicious!

I caramelized the onions and peppers w/ T. butter, a little brown sugar and pinch of salt for 15 min. until soft.  I took onions and peppers out to cool and added the chicken to the same pan and cooked for 15 minutes.  I added the peppers and onions w/ the chicken the last 5 minutes.  This was so yummy!

For a recipe-newbie this was a easy recipe. Per other reviewers suggestion I used "Baby Rays" BBQ sauce, Tyson grilled chicken strips, mozzarella & cheddar cheese. I sauteed all the veggies (plus mushrooms)in olive oil, a tiny bit of butter and salt. I used Pillsbury pizza crust and baked for 20 minutes. This was a very hearty pizza. A good alternative to other pizzas.

I made the pie crust a day in advance and kept covered in the refrigerator. Depending upon how strong the taste and consistency of the BBQ sauce used, reccomend adjusting the quantity that you spread on your crust. I put the sauce on light and it came out great. I made a little extra chicken and sauteed the bell peppers and red onion slightly. I kept the quantity of cheese down and used whole wheat flour to keep the meal healthy and light. Great recipe and very easy.

Awesome!! So easy and so good. Made 2 and they both quickly disappeared. Will certainly make again, used the recipe exactly as written. Used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce for a nice, hot tang.

Very good!  I did not use the red or green peppers due to personal preference, and I used the pre-cooked grilled chicken strips from Tyson because I had them on hand.  The family raved!

I used this recipe as a base.  I used Pillsbury refrigerated dough, precooked it but not browned.  I used my favorite local (Germantown Commissary) BBQ sauce, used the same company's bbq rub on the chicken breast that I baked in the oven.  Quick saute'd the green pepper and red onion in small amount of EVOO just till they started to get tender.  On crust...little bit of heated sauce, then cheese (mozzarella and cheddar), chicken, veggies, then drizzled with the remaining 1/3 cup of heated bbq sauce.  Returned to oven until cheese melted and crust nice and browned.  De-lish!

This was "ok".  Maybe it was the dough.  The overal pizza didn't have the overall texture or consistency i was hoping for.  Actually pretty messy...I may try again as my son did like it.

I love bbq chicken pizza and this is a great one!  I used 2 chicken breasts and added some diced tomato.  I found 1/2 cup of bbq sauce to be perfect.  Yum!

My hubby gives it 5 stars (I'm vegetarian, so didnt try it).  Easy!  I made a homemade pizza crust, dumped on some bbq sauce, the cheese, chicken and veggies.  My hubby does not like chicken and I'm desparately trying to find chicken recipes he'll like to rotate in with all the beef he eats!  This was a winner with him and me as its is soooooo easy!

Delicious!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and topped with chunks of chicken (I prefer this over diced), veggies sauteed in olive oil & a monterey jack cheese blend.  A keeper!

I used a pizza stone, was very good. Next time I plan to get more creative with cheeses to add a bit more flavor. I also suggest using the bbq sauce to taste, can easily get overpowering if too much is used.

Pizza is one of my family favorites...However, this is one that will be at the top...I made it just like the recipe said except I didn't use quite as much green pepper and I left out the red pepper.  It turned out great..Just as good if not better than any pizza you get at the pizza shop!

Quick, easy, and a favorite with kids.  All of the neighborhood moms have asked for this recipe.  I prefer to cook raw boneless chicken in the barbeque sauce with onions and peppers for a richer flavor.  I chop the chicken, return it to the sauce with the onions and peppers and spread the mixture on a Boboli or homemade crust and top with mozzerella.

yum, we really enjoyed this recipe! i made a large whole wheat pizza crust & spread about 3/4 cup barbeque sauce (sweet baby ray's original) over top. some reviewers mentioned adding bacon as a topping so i did the same. i also doubled the amount of grilled chicken & monterey jack cheese. this pizza is delicious either hot from the oven or the next day. thank you, iv!

My husband and I made this pizza together. The only thing we left out is the red peppers because we don't like them. We used rotisserie chicken for extra flavor. It came out great and we both loved it. This is a great recipe for an easy dinner night

This pizza surpassed my expectations!  Delicious.  I bought a Boboli premade crust which was okay, I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro and chicken.  It was quick and it tasted just like BJ's bbq chicken pizza.  Who needs BJ's when you've got this easy recipe!?

I broiled the chicken before dicing into small cubes and then reheated it in a pan with some extra BBQ sauce.  I also used more BBQ sauce than suggested on the dough before adding chicken.  I also carmalized an entire red onion before adding to the pizza, it was outstanding and my mother who is a BBQ sauce fanatic ended up eating 4 slices!

Great alternative to traditional pizza. I just used a envelope mix for the crust. We don't like our pizza so saucy so I reduced the sauce to closer to a 1/4 cup. I think that 1/2 cup would have overpowered the rest of the flavors...1/4 was still plenty of flavor and moisture. I will be making this again!

Fairly good. Pretty straight forward. I don't think I used quite a cup of cheese and paid for it. My pizza fell apart too easily and I think more cheese would have been the glue it needed.

Like many others, I couldn't believe that such a simple recipe would turn out so great. Just by starting with a simple layer of barbeque sauce, then a mix of fried green and red pepper with onion, bits of grilled chicken and a final layer of cheese, I got one of the best homemade pizzas ever. For sure I will make it again!

Outstanding! A 5++++ from the hubby and I. Our very first BBQ pizza and we loved it. I had leftover BBQ chicken tenders from the grill the night before so I chopped them up. Used bottled BBQ sauce, the green and red peppers, and red onion is key! It just goes so well with this pizza. I also used a monterey/cheddar cheese blend. I pretty much stacked this pizza pretty high with toppings. Wow..is all I can say. So different and delicious. Will most defiantely make again. Thanks!

Better than CPK! I shredded a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and mixed the chicken with the BBQ sauce before spreading it over the pizza crust. I recommend cooking your pizza dough for a few minutes before adding the toppings so that the crust doesn't get too soggy. Then return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted and pizza is bubbly.

Wow Wow Wow! This recipe is amazing! I used sweet baby rays sauce and instead of pre-baked crust I used Jiffy pizza crust mix. It's way cheaper and was only 50 cents a box and I used two boxes. I used a cookie sheet and made a large rectangular pizza.   I used 1 cp. sauce 8 oz. cheese and eyeballed the veggies and chicken. It was so good! I think I ate 5 slices but I can't remember lol. As soon as my husband bit into it he said it was really good. He was surprised b/c he never had bbq chkn and he didn't know what to expect.  I've ordered this at restaurants and this rivaled what I had and even tasted a little better! Oh, and might I add that this is my 1st time making pizza at home :-)

A very good pizza recipe. I made as directed, only I made the Bread Machine Pizza Dough from this site as opposed to using a pre-baked crust (so it needed to be in the oven about 24 minutes). I have made a similar recipe which uses some smoked gouda and mozzarella cheese, so will try that combination the next time, as there was something missing in the flavour. It's definitely worth trying again.

Outstanding!!  I used the recipe for the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust from this site and it came out sooo good!!  I used a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store as others suggested, and cut it up in bite size pieces.  My boyfriend loved it  =)

Girlfriend gave it a 6+* out of 5*. Only change was to use a rotisserie chicken chopped up from the grocery store, added sliced fresh shrooms. & broiled the pizza a few min to 'brown' the cheese. What an incredible pizza!!!!!
2nd time - only change was to use individua smalll pitas to make personal pizzas.

This was great! Just did a few changes: Sauted peppers, onions and chicken in barbeque sauce before I put on the pizza. Also I used a mix of Italian & Pizza cheese. I will be making this often for my family!

Great base recipe.  Used fresh spinach instead of peppers.  Used a homemade whole wheat crust and doubled chicken.  Delicious!

You may need to cook up two of these at a time!   Simple and great tasting! We just cooked up a fresh chicken breast instead of using leftovers. I recommend a sweet style of BBQ sauce as it compliments the red onions really well. Also a mix of Colby and Monteray worked well for the cheese.

I used this recipe as a guideline, but made many changes.  I prebaked a refrigerated pizza crust, used Kraft original mixed with honey, topped with LOTS of chicken, sauteed onion & peppers, and topped with mozzarella & cheddar.  Because I had an appointment and needed a quick dinner later, I put the pizza together, covered with foil & refrigerated for a few hours until I arrived home.  Then I baked for 20 minutes.  The results were delicious!

My family loved it!!! I used pizza dough not a pre-made form and it was amazing!! I also added a little mozzarella to get that stringy cheese effect.

Better then a restaurant!!!  This was simple, quick and cheap and tastes out of this world.  We will make this probably once a week!  I used Sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce and made a couple of minor revisions.  I thinly sliced the onions rather then diced, added a little cheddar, and parsley flakes. I omitted the red and green pepper.  I think next time we'll do a Hawaiian version and add pineapple and bacon.  YUMMY!!!

Made pizza dough in the breadmaker, pre-cooked it for a few minutes before adding toppings. I added some oil-packed sun dried tomatoes along with the peppers and used some fresh mozzarella in addition to monterey jack. Got rave reviews!

Can anyone say fantabulous?!?! (Is that even a word??) That was the best pizza, I have ever eaten and DH loved it, too! :) We did not use the veggies, because we're not big fans, but it was so easy and great tasting! Better than pizza chains!

We used Boboli's pre-baked pizza crust and Kraft Honey BBQ and it came together so good! I will make this again and again!!! :)

Yum!  I made my own dough and baked it for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings to it.  I prepared my chicken by simmering it in a water-barbeque mixture and then shredding it while it was cooking, which made it really tender and flavorful.  The pizza turned out great, and I thought the onions and peppers made a great combination with the chicken!

Made this for my hubsand and I, while making a half pepperoni/half cheese pizza for the kids. Guess what? The kids ate most of the BBQ Chicken Pizza! I skipped the peppers, as my husband doesn't care for them. I also couldn't get smoked gouda so used plain Mozzarella. Was still a delicious pizza. I'll try the smoked gouda next time though.

Because I was afraid of a mouthful of BBQ sauce as per the original recipe, I used 1/3 cup of barbeque sauce and a half can of store-bought pizza sauce. This change made the pizza delicious - no overwhelming BBQ flavor, just a nice balance between the sauces. I will definitely make this again; both my husband and I loved it!

This was fabulous.  My husband and I have been ordering BBQ chicken pizza from our local house of pizza, about once a week... not anymore.  We will make it ourselves with this simple but yummy recipe.  I used Pillsbury pizza dough.

This was really good. It was easy and quick to make and was visually pleasing.  I didn't have enough monterey jack cheese so I added a monterey jack/cheddar cheese blend and it came out fine.

I left off the green pepper and added sliced mushrooms.  I used half jack and half parm cheese.  I baked it at 425 for 15 min to help get the veggies a little more done.  Yum!

This was so incredibly easy and tasty!  I sauted the chicken and onions briefly in oil and then cooked it in the bbq sauce.  I spread a thin layer of bbq sauce over the crust and then the chicken combo.  Oh, I left out the peppers.  Really easy and tasty!

This matched or exceeded my hopes.  I have a favorite local restuarant that serves my favorite BBQ chicken pizza of all time.  Other restaurants always disappoint.  This recipe means I can have my all-time favorite meal right at home - it tastes just the same and was very very easy and quick.  And, my family, who doesn't even order this at the restaurant loved it too.

Loved this!  I've had a lot of different BBQ pizzas and I think this tastes just like you would get at a California Pizza Kitchen...maybe better!  I used more BBQ sauce than recommended which gave more flavor.

Yummy! New recipe added to the dinner rotation. I used a Boboli whole wheat thin crust.  I sauteed the veggies (added mushrooms) before topping the pizza.  Cooked the chicken in BBQ sauce.  Decided to use pepper jack cheese.

Excellent! We're not big fans of bell pepper so we omitted it, but otherwise this simple yet delicious pizza was a hit in our household where two of our family members work for a pizza parlor.  If they'll eat it after working at the parlor all day then it must be good!

This is a hit in our house. The only thing we did different was put pineapple chunks also.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  We use the Kraft Hickory Smoke BBQ Sauce, and mozzarella cheese.  We're not big pepper and/or onion fans, so we usually don't add those, but it still tastes delicious even without them.

It's also one of the few foods that tastes even better when heated up the next day, after the chicken marinates in the sauce for awhile.

I agree that the BBQ sauce can make or break this pizza.  I used a honey, roasted garlic sauce and thought it was too sweet.  We did like it enough to try again though.  I also added crumbled bacon and a combo of Mozzarella and MJ cheese.

This is a great dish for anyone who likes BBQ sauce, like I do! I added extra veggies like fresh tomatoes and mushrooms.  I also think this recipe would be good with real bacon bits for a Monterey style pizza.

This was delicious! I did doctor it a little. I used honey bourbon barbecue sauce, mozzarella and smoked gouda cheese (instead of the monterey jack), added a sprinkle of basil, oregano and thyme along with chopped garlic, a bunch of scissored chives and cilantro. Yum!

I wanted to use leftover chicken breasts in something different. Came across this recipe.. And it gave me inspiration. Never made a pizza using BBQ in place of tomato sauce before. I made a homemade pizza dough, and added sautéed mushrooms and garlic. Garnished half (mine) with Olives, banana peppers and cilantro. 
Delish! I love pizzas and how customizable they are.

Great recipe, I use a home made crust and pre-bake it for 10 minutes, then add ingredients as given in directions and baked and additional 15 minutes.  I use WAY more chicken than 1/2 cup, about 3 pre cooked chicken breasts cut into strips.

Instead of using Pizza crust I used Pita bread and toasted it in the oven. It came out really well. Also using bacon as well would be good. The pictures don't serve this recipe justice.

I really enjoyed this! I recently purchased a pizza stone & tried this (of course using parchment paper), I used the same amt of bbq sauce, and used half roasted red peppers & half fresh and carmelized the onion with the pepper before in olive oil.. & did not use the green bell pepper. Also used some cheddar & italian cheeses. Great recipe! I saved this to my recipe box and will definitely be my go to bbq chicken pizza!

Made this with the homemade pizza crust from my red cookbook.
Remember to precook the crust a bit before adding the toppings.

Huge hit with the hubby!  I used a Jiffy mix pizza crust and Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle BBQ Sauce.  Only had a yellow onion, but I did carmalize that and get some "grill" marks on the peppers in the pan before putting em on the pizza.  Ran out of Jack cheese - used left over mozzerella.  This really was easy & delicious & from scratch!

BIG HIT!!!  Everyone enjoyed this.  We made 2 pizzas.  One for the kids and one for us.  The kids decided to put BBQ sauce, chicken, cheese, red pepper on theirs.  We put BBQ sauce, chicken, cheese, red pepper, red onion and asparagus.  Delicious!!

WOW! This is amazing. I, too, was skeptical thinking it would be bland, but it was awesome! I made my own crust using a cheap Jiffy mix, honey bbq sauce and a mixture of monterey jack/cheddar shredded cheese. Everyone loved it and I will be making it again!

I cooked the whole thing on the grill. The rest of my family liked it more than I did. It was good, but I think it used a bit too much barbecue sauce. Next time, I'll cut that down and I think it'll be 5 stars.

Oh my goodness- this is the best BBQ chicken pizza ever!  I used Trader Joe's pizza dough, and Stubb's original BBQ sauce.  It has become a go-to meal in our household.

I'm eating this now & it is veryyy good. I was skeptical about it but it got such good reviews. I didn't use any of the measuments for the pepers or chicken or anything I just did it how it looked good & I think I used too much bbq sauce so it is veryyy sweet haha but that was my fault so 5 stars

Quick & tasty!  Used store bought fresh pizza dough... while pre-baking the dough for ten minutes, I grilled the onions, peppers, and chicken.  Ended up doubling the chicken and halving the bbq sauce.  Assembled the toppings and sprinkled with cheddar jack and baked for another ten minutes... yum-o!

I made this last week and my husband & I LOVED it. The only thing I adapted was that I used the packaged Martha White pizza crust. It was easy to mix up and bake. I am not a big fan of Boboli type crusts. Also, I used Jack Daniels original BBQ sauce along with cheddar cheese, not Monterey. This recipe is amazing. Thank you!!! I will be making it again.

My girlfriend and I have already made this recipe twice in just two weeks.  I admit that when I first looked at the ingredients list I thought it would be pretty plain and not very tasty.  After making it, it's terrific.  I used a Jack Daniel's brand BBQ sauce and it really tasted great.  Simple to make, but I'm sure we'll be making this regularly going forward!!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for its easiness to prepare (since you're using pre-bake pizza crust, grilled/rotisserie chicken from the deli, bottled bbq sauce, and pre-shredded cheese).  But the taste just does not deserve a 5-star rating, as it is just so-so. Hubby and I agree--we won't make again.

I have been making a similar bbq chicken pizza for the past few years.  I always use a particular bbq sauce out of Kansas City, I also often use as many vegetables as possible adding mushrooms is great.  I suggest using Sharp Cheddar cheese as well--always from a block (pre-shredded cheese has so much junk in it to keep from clumping together!)

Great pizza! I added more barbeque sauce and that was a mistake.  Make the pizza with these amounts and it will be great.

Exceptional! My son has a dairy allergy and with a couple of modifications we were able to make this safe for him, too! This will be a staple in my family's diet from now on! We did not add the peppers but did use the onions! Also, used Honey BBQ sauce from Kraft as the base. REALLY YUMMY!

This recipe was a classic with my family. I loved how easy and simple it was to do, no stress and yet it tasted delicious.  I ended up using four small crusts instead of one big one and putting certain toppings on certain pizzas (just a suggestion if you happen to have a picky family)  All and all it was an awesome recipe!

I had to try this and it was delicious! I used the crust mix that you add water to because that is what I always use and for the sauce I used the Sweet Baby Ray's that another reviewer suggested and I did not use the red pepper just because I didn't have any and I also added pineapple to 1/2 to try it out and I should have put it on the whole thing because it was so good. I will make again! Thanks

This was delicious, and so very easy. We cut out the onion and used garlic instead, and only used red pepper instead of the green, but it was still quite tasty. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipolte as the sauce and added a wee bit of soy sauce into it - finger licking good! And spicy with a kick. Will definitey make again. I had a lot left over and could have easily made two pizzas, so next time, I will!

I use Sweet Baby Ray barbecue sauce and my own homemade dough, either par-baked or fresh. This pizza always turns out great, as long as the barbecue sauce is thinly spread on the crust (you can always add more sauce to individual slices if desired). I also use cheddar sometimes if I don't have monterey jack on hand.

My husband said this was the best pizza to come out of our oven yet! I didn't have grilled chicken, so I just cooked 2 boneless breasts up in a cast iron skillet with EVOO, garlic powder, salt and pepper. I made my own dough from the "Pizza Dough I" recipe listed on this site. Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce. Next time I may add pineapple.

I omitted the peppers in this recipe, but the end result was still very good. I will probably make some version of this again, but it will probably just turn into a Hawaiian pizza.

Very good, used mozzarella cheese and minced onions because I didn't have the rest of the ingredients.

I guess that I am just not a fan of BBQ chicken pizza.  I am a pepperoni and sausage kind of gal.  It was easy to make and looked really yummy.  I used a rotesseri chicken from the grocery store.  I don't think that I will make it again, just not for my family

Great recipe and it is so easy.  In the summer I cook it on the BBQ grill.  It takes about 5 minutes.

Really simple and really delicious. I didn't follow specific quantities, just went with what looked right. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to spread a little cream cheese on the crust first. Used Boboli whole wheat crust and a little cheddar, as I didn't have enough Monterey Jack. Definitely will make again!

I added one clove of minced garlic when I pan fried the chicken. I used mozzarela instead of monterey jack and added 1/2 cup more.

This pizza was great. This was my first dish that I ever cooked and it was very simple. Now I am inspired to go cook some other recipes. The BBQ sauce I used was Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I made two pizzas. The other sauce was Honey BBQ. They both taste great!

Who could ask for anything easier?! This was my first time making or eating a BBQ chicken pizza. I seasoned my chicken well and baked it. I used only a very thin layer of BBQ sauce. I am sooo anxious to try this again using the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce on this site. It is the ultimate sauce! Thank you for sharing your recipe with us!

The grilled chicken in the recipe is what makes it really stand apart from the other recipes on this site. I prefer to use a fontina or smoked gouda.

Simply delicious.  Used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and pizza dough from Trader Joes.  I had no onions/peppers on hand, but I did have fresh portobello mushrooms and added those.  This is such a great recipe to try different combinations with.  Give it a try--you won't be disappointed!

I really liked this recipe.  I have made another one before, but I think I like this one better.  I like the flavor that the red bell pepper and red onion add.  It is also very colorful and makes for good presentation.

Sorry have to rate this a three. I followed the directions exactly. Hubby said it would of been a 5 if I used regular sauce. The BQ sauce didn't taste right, I won't make this again with Barbeque sauce.

This was excellent.  Like others, I sauted the veggies a bit in olive oil, then added my pre-cooked chicken and Famous Dave's BBQ Sauce to the pan.  Then I put everything on the pizza dough.  My store didn't have Jack cheese (just Colby/Jack), so that's what I used.  I'll bet pure Monterey Jack would have been better.  But, on the whole, this recipe definitely goes in my recipe box.  Thanks a lot Iv.

This was really good and it was so fast to make.  I seasoned the chicken, and also seasoned and very lightly sauteed the vegetables so that they wouldn't be crunchy.  My husband and 2 year old loved it.

Do yourself a favor and either make a fresh dough yourself or go to the local pizzeria and buy some dough.  It was so much better than the pre made crust.  Just use plenty of flour and shape the dough to the size and thickness you want.  Other than that it was very easy to make and it was full of flavor!  Everyone loved it and I made it again for New Year's Eve.  As soon as it came out of the oven... it was gone!

This is better than anything you will get at a pizza parlor...trust me!  I used a thin crust Boboli and followed the recipe perfectly.  (Oops, well almost: I used mozzarella cheese instead of Jack.)  I also mixed a little BBQ sauce with the chicken as well as spreading it on the crust.  Bring plenty of napkins, because it is finger licking good.

Boy was this ever tastey! I knew this was a recipe that my younger teenage daughter would love because she puts bar-b-que sauce on everthing. My older teenager was a bit leary but gave it a try anyway and ended up chowing down four slices! (very lady like) I cooked my chicken in barbeque sauce, used Pillsbury ready to bake pizza dough and pepper jack cheese. Thank you Iv for a different and delicious pizza recipe!

What a hit! We used a ready to bake crust from the refridgerated section - pre baked according to package and then put toppings on according to recipe. The whole family loved it! Thanks for the great twist on an old favorite!

I wasn't sure about this one, but decided to try it based on the reviews. I only put  a little over half the bbq sauce so it wasn't too sweet and even my husband (the picky eater) loved it. This one is worthy of the recipebox!

Tried this recipe tonight and it was a hit with everyone except my picky 3 year old.  I increased the amount of sauce to 1 cup.  I also a 16 oz package of Publix precooked chicken breasts in Bourbon BBQ sauce.  For the cheese, I used a finely shredded Italian blend.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time I am going to try shredded gouda.

This was really good and as someone else mentioned...even better the next day.  I think next time, I will let the chicken sit in the bbq sauce in the fridge for a few hours.

I always make my crust from scratch, but I did cut corners with some of the other things. I didn't have any red onion, so I used a combo of frozen peppers and onions. I used frozen grilled chicken.  

I mixed sharp cheddar, monterey jack and mozz. cheeses. I also used TS bacon bacon for the top.  Oh, and good old Kraft bbq sauce works great. 
TFS.

Absolutely delicious.  I did not have to add one thing.  Most recipies require something added.  This was perfect.  The whole family enjoyed it and it was quick to make.

This is delicious and you can add or vary the toppings to suit your tastes.
