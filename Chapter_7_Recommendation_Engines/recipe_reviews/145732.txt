I was looking for a quick Thai peanut salad dressing.  I was doubtful as I was making it but was definitely pleased with the outcome.  I wanted more of the salad so I could have more dressing!  I did not change the recipe at all.

Excellent dipping sauce.  Instead of adding the cornstarch I just let the sauce slow cook and it turned out excellent.

GREAT basic sauce. We used it the first time for a dipping sauce for seafood, then I used it in a stir-fry the second night. I made a chicken stir-fry, added a package of stir-fry vegetables, added a little stir-fry sauce to give it a little kick and then the peanut dressing.  I tossed it with spaghetti and it was the best stir-fry dish I have made.  Nice flavors.  It makes a pretty big recipe so try it many different ways. I can't wait to try something else with it today.

YUMMY!! I made this dressing for Thai Chicken Wraps and it turned out really good.  The only thing I changed was I didn't add the water and cornstarch mixture, just let it simmer for about 15-20 mins and it thickened up just fine.

This was so yummy! We had leftover Thai restaurant food, but not enough for the whole family, so I whipped up some of this dressing and some rice, threw a little leftover grilled chicken in, and YUM! Will do this instead of taking the fam out for Thai next time I have a hankering.

Delicious.  Just what I was looking for to make a salad. The recipe is great as is, but I also checked out the customized version " Asian Style Peanut Sauce By: jsheridan1956" and thought I would like some of the ingredients he used.  So I added a little more Rice Vinegar, some Mae Ploy sauce, a little honey, and a teaspoon of powdered ginger (of course fresh would have been even better). YUM!  I could drink this stuff.  My salad included green onion and cilantro so those flavors added a lot to the dish.

Followed the recipe exactly, but made enough for just 1 person since I live alone.  wouldn't change a thing about this dressing, it is five stars as is.  Adding some fresh ginger and a dash of siracha sauce takes it to another level.  Thanks for the recipe!

The consistency and basic recipe is pretty good, but the end product was a bit bland for me. I added some powdered ginger (no fresh on hand), extra soy sauce, honey, and sriracha chili sauce. I think the mint would have helped, as would green onions and cilantro in the accompanying dish.

This was "okay". Didn't seem to be enough peanut butter in it and was kind of watery.

This is a great peanut sauce for the vietnamese spring rolls I make!  I also left out the cornstarch and cold water and found that the sauce was plenty thick if you just cook it long enough.

This ended up too thick, and not very Asian tasting. Still good, but tasted just like peanut butter.

This is delicious, easy, and just what I was looking for...However, you don't need the cornstarch or the first 2 tablespoons of water.  Natural peanut butter will thicken the sauce on it's own in just a minute or two after your bring it to a simmer.  Sometimes I add fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice, but it's delicious as it is.

This is a delicious and easy dressing.  It really doesn't need the cornstarch as it becomes the perfect consistency by stirriing it over med. heat about 10 minutes.  I also added Rooster sauce and red chili flakes to make it spicy.  Try with a napa cabbage salad....delicious!

This was good. I did a little doctoring to it. I used honey rather than brown sugar. I also added red papper flakes and a few dashes of Red Hot Sauce to it. We used it as a dip for sesmae chicken.

I just made this pretty much to the T except I guesstimated rather than measure things out exactly... the only thing I changed was like others I did not add the corn starch... I did a rolling bubbling until it was the consistency I like which was only a few minutes.  Very good flavor, going to be great on the vietnamese spring rolls I am making.  Thanks for this recipe, just what I needed.

AMAZING!!!! I just cooked it down to thicken it (instead of adding the water and cornstarch), and added about a teaspoon of Thai fish sauce, and this was OUTSTANDING!!! It tastes so authentic. Love it.

I love Thai food and peanut sauce is my absolute favorite. This is by far both the best peanut sauce I've made and the best that I've ever tasted. I did make some minor tweaks - added ginger, garlic, and fish sauce - but it is a great recipe. I used it to dress a noodle salad but have plenty leftover so will use it as a dipping sauce as well.

This was OK.  Very peanutty and very thick.  Not really like any real thai food that I've had, but not bad.  I served it over whole wheat spaghetti noodles with stir-fried veggies.

Due to all the rave reviews, I thought this would be really good. I made it as stated. It was just okay, didn't really care for it. I was looking for a recipe similar to one that I eat at my local Thai restaurant.

This was great!  We have a peanut allergy in our house, so I used almond butter instead…yum!  Also, I substituted honey for the brown sugar and did not add the corn starch.  Perfecto!

Delicious!  This was a yummy treat.  I followed pretty closely but wanted to point out this is pretty thick like a satay dip v a salad dressing.  I used it once and was happy but ended up cutting it with way more rice vinegar to make a salad dressing and it was maybe even MORE amazing!  Think leftover satay, some fresh greens, red onion and shredded carrot.  Wow!!

So I made this recipe to specs, as I do all the recipes I try off this site, so I can give it the rating it deserves, in my humble opinion. I gave it 3.5. My husband liked it. I thought it was okay, but not what I was looking for, so I'll keep searching. I won't use the one's calling for fish sauce, as I know that ingredient isn't used in the real mccoy sauces/dips.  But thank you for your recipe. I actually sauteed some shrimp, then added the sauce, mixed and placed it on some rice noodles topped with fresh green onions and mint leaves. Like I said, it was good, just not great.

I love this as a dressing for a big bed of greens.  I didn't have any cornstarch, so I omitted the cold water/cornstarch and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  This version was quite flavorful, maybe a little too flavorful as a salad dressing for some folks, but my sister & I liked it & her picky-eater toddler enjoyed it on rice. I will make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Quite good. Maybe not quite up to the standards of really good restaurant peanut sauce but pretty darn close.

It wasn't what I was expecting because it didn't taste like the peanut sauce served at restaurants, but it was very tasty!

I used Skippy natural peanut butter, added a tablespoon of sambal olek and a tablespoon of fresh grated ginger, and left out the cornstarch + water step.

Perfect balance and texture.  This will be the first time that I will finalize a recipe here without any modifications.  
Thai cuisine has many choices with zip, bang, and zing.  This sauce is the perfect counterpoint for those dishes.

This was so, so good.  I made it last night intending to use it on a salad.  We changed plans so I put it in the fridge.  Took it out tonight, warmed it up and put it on a salad made with a bed of mixed greens and beet greens, sliced cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion, sliced red cabbage, quinoa on top of that and cooked chicken cubes on top of that.  After the sauce was dolloped on top, we sprinkled on slightly crushed raw peanuts.  The sauce made the meal ~ really amazing! My 16 yr old and husband loved it too.

This dressing was better than expected and really is like restaurant Thai peanut sauce. Before simmering the sauce, I was worried since it seemed very watery and separated. However the sauce will certainly thicken if you get the sauce to a boil, and the water cornstarch mixture is unnecessary. I also added about a teaspoon of ginger paste.

It was ok. I used it as a dressing on broccoli slaw with leftover chicken breast. Next time, I'll try to spice up with a bit of Thai chili paste.

I left out the corn starch, cooked it a few minutes longer and then had to add water as it was too thick.  Once adjusted the flavor was perfect .  I used some of it on a salad and the next day on chicken, veggie wraps.  A great basic receipt.

Quick and easy.  Had all the ingredients on hand.  Followed recipe exactly.  Used as salad dressing, and was a little thin, but good.  Allowed left overs to simmer and thickened nicely, but seemed to change the flavor a bit.

Made as directed but only put one teaspoon of the sesame oil since it has a strong flavor and I was making this for my kids who are leary of trying new foods. It turned out good and mild (I think I would have liked that other teaspoon of sesame oil though).  It wasn't really a hit with my dauhters but my husband and I liked it which makes it a keeper. Will make again for sure.

At the end it was to think and I even added more water ant it still was to think. I also don't know how I supposed to use it as a salad dressing because I made somethig alse  a ground Thai  turkey and I put some lettuce and combined everything togheter. I was not impressed at all especially the Thai turkey and the dressing by itself I don't like si I don't really know with what to eat it  to taste good.

Mine came out too liquidy.  I simmered it to boil out some of the water, which caused the oil in the peanut butter to separate.  Bad choice. It ended up a lumpy mess.

for more of a kick or traditional thai flavor substitute fish sauce a little less than 1/4 cup, (fish sauce is usually saltier than soy sauce).
