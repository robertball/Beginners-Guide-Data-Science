This is a very good recipe as is, but I made it yesterday with a couple of small changes to it to suit my personal preferences.
I used 4 cups of rhubarb, 4 eggs, and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar, added about a teaspoon of vanilla, and replaced the regular white rice flour in the rhubarb mixture with sweet white rice flour. 
I used rhubarb that I had in the freezer from last year, which I didn't thaw prior, so the additional rhubarb and the fact that it was frozen added to my baking time by about 15 minutes.
My family loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

We really liked this recipe. We are big rhubarb fans and good to find such tasty dessert that is gluten free. Since we like tart, did reduce sugar to 1-1/2 cups also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to egg mixture. Also replaced part of starch with almond meal to reduce carbs a bit. Baking description and times were very accurate. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. Have second batch in oven now and plan to make this whenever we can find rhubarb.

A sweet pudding like dessert. Goes nicely with some ice cream. The crust could be used on its own as a base for other desserts. Thank you for your recipe.

I made a few changes to this recipe as one other person commented I replaced some of the flour with almond flour for the base, really any gluten free flour will work. My daughter can’t have rice so I used XO flour. I didn’t use potato or tapioca flour because I didn’t see the point. I used corn starch for thickening the rhubarb mix. I used at least 6 cups of rhubarb and added about 3/4 cup coconut cream to the eggs and sugar. I didn’t reduce the sugar because of the extra rhubarb. I would have given this 5 * but thought too many different flours were used unnecessarily.
