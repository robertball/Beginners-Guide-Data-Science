This cake was okay--it needs salt, maybe 1/2 teaspoon.  It wasn't remarkable in any way for us, just tasted like a spiced cookie but with the texture of a quick bread.  It took twice as long to bake in my oven.

great flavor, but cooking it for 45 minutes made it overdone. next time i'll try it for 30 or 35 minutes.
