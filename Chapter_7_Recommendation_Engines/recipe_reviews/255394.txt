I added 1/4 tsp of turmeric and used a tablespoon of sriracha sauce.  It was delicious .

Thank you for an amazing recipe that was easy to make!!  I grilled two boneless-skinless chicken breasts after marinating, (lime juice, peanut oil, roasted garlic and soy sauce).  I also added zucchini squash to this great summer dish.

I'm always on the lookout for a tasty, healthy dinner recipe, and this one fills the bill!  There is no sauce, but the flavors come together, very well.  I used 1/2 the recommended amount of hot sauce, and that was quite enough for me.  I love to have another recipe that uses artichokes, too.  Thanks for posting!

Had a spaghetti squash laying around so I decided to try this recipe. AMAZING! Different from what I’m use to. Flavor is delicious. I highly recommend, especially for those being a first time spaghetti squash eater like myself. **followed recipe above. the only thing I did differently was: season chicken with cayenne pepper as a substitute for the hot sauce and add chopped black olives.

This was a terrific Fall recipe. We loved the chicken and pesto combo and we added lots sautéd mushrooms, diced onions and garlic. It turned out perfect. Once the fresh squash is out of season we plan to use angel hair spaghetti noodles.

I always try to stick with a recipe as it is written.  I omitted the artichoke just as a personal preference.  With that being said, I found this to be too bland.  It wasn't bad, just missing something.

This is fantastic! I made mine with skinless chicken thighs fried in Better than Bouillon. I also added black olives. Will definitely make it again.

My changes were minor. I add mushrooms instead of peppers. And I omitted the oregano but I was not impressed this time. This was the second time I made it. I loved it the first time. I didn’t write my notes. ??

I am generally scared of squash (lol) but decided to give it a go with this recipe and I am glad I did.  The only change I made was to use less cheese to cut a few more calories out.  It still had lots of flavor and I would make it again.  I used Sriracha sauce for my hot sauce and it was perfectly spicy for us.

Altered a bit, base of spaghetti squash was delicious, I had sprinkled Parmesan on after breaking it up. I added mushrooms instead of peppers, blended all of the spices with chicken and placed over squash.   I loved it and thought it was dinner guest worthy.
