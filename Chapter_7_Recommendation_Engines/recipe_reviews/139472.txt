I'm giving this one 4 stars b/c I thought it might be a little bland. Here are the changes I made: I sauteed 2 tbsp chopped garlic in olive oil, then 1 small onion and 1/2 lb of shitake mushrooms for about 5 minutes. Then I tossed it into the food processor and chopped it small and added it to the veal mix. I thought it gave depth that might have been missing. Served on whole wheat rolls with melted brie. My husband and I loved these!

I ended up not having and rosemary around when I made these burgers so I replaced it with chives. I served them with a Garden Salad with Mustard Greens (regular salad, I just replaced half the lettuce with the greens,) stuffed clams & a Pinot Noir I had laying around.  Maybe it was the burgers, maybe it was the company, maybe it was because they were grilled on a cold November day in New England, but these burgers were great.   I will make these again and highly suggest this recipe to others.

Left out the Rosemary since we don't like it. Cooked them on the electric George Foreman grill. Very tasty.

My boyfriend said, "It's a keeper!" 
I used white pepper and grilled over charcoal, topped them with colby-jack, butter lettuce, tomato, mayo, and yellow mustard.
I rubbed halves of a large summer squash with grapeseed oil and grilled flat-side down to serve alongside.
The herbs should be fresh. It makes all the difference and provides plenty of flavor. I used 3 basil leaves instead of 2 because mine were small.
Will make again!

I changed it a little to suit my taste & what I had available. I saut√©ed the onions & garlic, but I didn't have the shitake mushrooms. So I used 1/2can of diced tomatoes w/gr.chilies (drained). after the onions & garlic were done, I added them & let the flavors blend together (until cooled).I,also, didn't have any rosemary so I replaced it w/tarragon & 1/4tsp cumin & a pinch of turmeric. Let me tell you, those burgers were amazing! I'm sure that they are amazing even if you follow the original recipe...but I'm the person that always has to tweak it one way or the other LOL :) enjoy!!!

The flavor was very good and they were very tender...but I did not expect them to be so soupy. I followed the recipe to a "T" so my advice is to be prepared to grill them on a grill pad or thick foil. I will make again but be more mindful of how much liquid I add to my veal.

I did whir up 4 white button mushrooms, 3 cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup of Walla Walla sweet onion in a food processor (coarse).  Then tossed in a frying pan with a little oil - cooked until tender.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written, with the addition of the cooled mushroom mixture.  I rolled into 8 slider size meatballs and grilled them.  No condiments beyond a nice piece of lettuce some homemade aoli (or a little of your favorite mayo).  Absolutely a keeper!  Will make again and again.  BWT, no cheese needed.  NOM NOM NOM~ THANKS FOR SHARING!

It was SO DELICIOUS but I've made a lot changes to it. I added Garlic Powder, Oregano, Salt, Shredded Mozzarella Cheese, and I added 1 more egg. And Hell Yes I would definitely be making this again!!!

Very juicy and flavorful. I didn't have any basil and I think rosemary is too strong for veal, so I instead added some liquid garlic marinade from the frig and some powdered onion. (Forgive me: Someone in my family doesn't like any thing in a dish that has a different texture from the the main ingredient.) Sauteed the veal burgers with butter and crushed garlic, then added a handful of minced crimini mushrooms.  I turned the heat up high to give it a browned texture, on both sides, then lowered it to medium. When their internal temperature reached 160, I removed the burgers and added a half cup of a semi-fermented prune juice that I keep in the frig and a tablespoon of tomato paste. I boiled it down until it was thick, then put it in a serving dish to be put on top of their burgers.
Obviously, this is a recipe that, like a salad, begs for innovation and a slew of favorite flavors.
