Soup is my favorite food.  I used 6 cups vegetable broth rather than the bouillon and added a bit of salt rather than the tamari.  I used shitake and white mushrooms.  This soup is quite tasty.  I would like to try it with the tamari next time.  I think it will add depth.  Don't be afraid to try it without, though, if it's the only ingredient you're missing.

Pretty good soup and easy to make.  We threw a little more coconut milk and lime juice into the mix to suit our tastes.  I wonder if lemongrass would be good in this soup.

This was really good!  We had it for dinner tonight along with onion pita bread triangles for dipping per the suggestion at the beginning.  Even my children liked it!

The only thing I changed from the original recipe was that I crumbled a sheet of sushinori (seaweed) in place of the wakame because I could not find the wakame at the two grocery stores near me.  For the mushrooms, I used half baby bella and half white mushrooms.  We will be having this again!

Yummy! Made as directed but added some fresh ginger to taste and some cubed tofu that had been marinated for about an hour in a little tamari.  Served over brown rice.  A very yummy, flavorful, and filling meal!

I have made a lot of soup in my day and this has to be the best one I have ever made or eaten, it is wonderful!  I couldn't fine Wakame seaweed so I soaked two sheets of Kombu (not Nori), then diced it.  I increased the garlic by 1 clove because I love garlic.  Last I increased the soy sauce to 1 tablespoon.  Be sure to completely open the cans of coconut milk and scrape out the sediment on the bottom or you will lose a lot of flavor.  I  can't say how wonderfully rich the mushroom flavor was with just simple button mushrooms.  I will make this again and again, thank you so much!

I wish I could have rated this higher, especially given the current reviews. This soup has promise, but needs improvement. The coconut taste is virtually impossible to detect. Side note to say I reduced this by half...I also forgot to add in the full 3 cups of water, adding in just 1 1/2 cups water. Had I included the full 3 cups water this would have been more watery than it was. I won't make this again.
