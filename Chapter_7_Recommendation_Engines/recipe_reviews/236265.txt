I loved how quickly this came together. Super healthy, and uses ingredients I always have on hand. I thought this needed some salt. Very versatile and perfect for a weekday breakfast.

Add feta cheese and you'll have a  five-star dish. And don't remove egg. Cook tomatoes first till soft, then add pieces of feta, followed by the eggs. Delicious.

Pretty simple and it turned out good.  My one complaint would be that the recipe instructed me to cook the tomato until its juices had mostly evaporated, I cooked them for an additional five minutes.  However, the ripe tomatoes continued to leak out  water.  I went ahead with the rest of the recipe steps, but I could never get the tomatoes to stop leaking juices.  After another 10 minutes with the eggs and everything else, I used a lid and strained the juices from the pan.  After that the dish was great and still quite moist.  I agree that it could use a lot of salt and pepper, but the person eating can add that to their own taste.  I could see this being stuffed into tortillas and it needs to be doubled for my family.

It was a little bland. We ended up slathering it in salsa. Next time I'll try mixing some Cajun seasoning in.

I really enjoyed this!  I don't understand why you remove the egg, and then cook the tomatoes?  About 3 quarters of the way through my eggs being cooked I added in the tomatoes and cooked until done.  Worked perfectly, and less hassle.  :)  Added a pinch of salt as well.
