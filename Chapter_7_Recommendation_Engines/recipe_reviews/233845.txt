Delicious! Will definitely make again. I saut√©ed my own veggies: onion, sweet bell pepper and squash. And had a can of green enchilada sauce so used that. Everything else was as wrote. So good!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  Used fresh vegetables instead of the frozen ones and added broccoli just because I like it.

I used fresh peppers and onions. I just sauteed them in a tsp of olive oil and then picked up the recipe from there.

Had to use 8 inch tortillas and only made 6 to fit in casserole dish (3 servings), but tasted great.  My wife wasn't such a big fan - she wanted some meat in it.

I used pinto beans because I had some leftover from the night before and I made my own sauce. They were delicious! My family loves them, I love them, we will definitely have them again. I have found a new recipe to use my leftover beans in.

I made my own red enchilada sauce, whole grain tortillas and omitted cheese. This was very delicious!
