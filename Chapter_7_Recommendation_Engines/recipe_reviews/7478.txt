Very nice cake. Excellent crumb,texture and taste. Cream butter and sugar first, add eggs one at a time, then vanilla. Add sour cream and flour mixture alternately, beginning and ending with flour. To avoid a crusty, over-baked exterior bake at standard 350 degrees. Also, for a moist cake, do not overbake! This cake is very similar to one made with a yellow cake mix, but a much tastier choice. I omitted the nuts and used brown sugar for the filling--no need at all to double filling ingredients--then  drizzled with a powdered sugar glaze when cool. Excellent recipe!

I read the other reviews and made some modifications when I made the cake.  I coated the Bundt pan with cinnamon & sugar, used brown sugar instead of white for the filling, omitted the nuts and added a little extra sour cream (light) to the batter.  Results were great!!  We took it to a friend's house and I got a desperate e-mail two days later that the cake was finished and they needed the recipe ASAP.

This recipie was very good.  I would suggest using an icing to drizzle over the top.  The icing i used was: 1c. powdered sugar, 2tablespoons milk, and 1teaspon of vanilla extract.

This has been a big hit, very good but not too sweet.  The first time I tried this recipe the sour cream and butter were quite lumpy so I started over.  I now cream the  sugar and butter before adding the eggs and sour cream.  I also substituted pecans instead of walnuts. Do grease your pan well!

There are not enough stars to give this recipe it's just desserts! It has set the standard by which all cakes are judged in my house. Easy as can be, comes out perfect every time. My only modification is I double the amount of swirl mixture and divide the cake batter into three so I can layer the swirl. When cut the inside has 2 stripes of swirl and some on top! Fabulous Recipe, I make it often.

Wonderful & moist.  We loved it.  I made a couple of changes -  I did not have sour cream, so I used one cup milk & one TBLS vinegar, mix & let sit for 5 minutes (got this from King Arthur).  Also, at the suggestion of another reviewer I used 2 TBLS cinnamon.   This is probably the best coffee cake I've made & it looks nice, too!! :)

The cake tastes wonderful - the method of combining the eggs with the sugar and then adding the sour cream and butter is weird.  If you add the vanilla at the same time you add the butter, you get a more intense vanilla flavor.  I also added about a 1 teaspoon more cinnamon and added the nuts to the cinnamon sugar mixture rather than have them throughout the whole cake.  Definitely make it again but will use the standard mixing method - cream butter and sugars, add sour cream and eggs, etc.  Also I didn't use the 400 degree temp - just the 350 and baked it until it was done.

This recipe was so delicious! I am a big coffee cake fan and this one was the best one I've had. I made one modification-I doubled the cinnamon-sugar mixture, then to that added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 4 TBSP of melted butter, 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, mixed that up and sprinkled it in the middle of the cake. WONDERFUL!

This was good, but made a cake that only about half filled our bundt pan.  I recommend the "Streusel Coffee Cake" recipe submitted by Mary instead.  It's a very similar cake, but bigger and moister.

A very, very delicious and moist cake. I've made it MANY times and my family loves it. Here are the changes I made: I creamed the butter and sugar together, then added the eggs and mixed again, and last I added the sour cream and vanilla and mixed until blended. I also did not put the nuts into the cake, I added them to the cinnamon sugar swirl. For the swirl: I added 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 3/4 cups chopped walnuts. That is how I prefer it, and with these changes the cake was amazing. The longer it stays the better it taste. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was a delicious cake, moist & tasty. I doubled the cinnamon & sugar (half reg. sugar half brown sugar)& mixed it with the nuts. I also divided the cake in 3 so there was more of the cinnamon swirl. The only problem I had nothing to do with the recipe, my bundt pan burns my cake on top. It's not my oven everything else bakes fine. Someone help me, what kind of bundt pan is a good one! Thank you for an awesome cake!!!!!

I LOVE coffee cake and this one is by far the best I have ever had. I just got a bundt pan for christmas and this was the first recipe I had to try! Everything about this cake turned out perfect for us, the taste, texture and baking time. This was pulled out of the oven less than an hour ago and it is already half gone. My boyfriend thinks its best served warm. THANK YOU RUTH!

I've made this cake three times in the past month, twice for my classmates and once for my family over Christmas break.  It never lasts more than 24 hours!  I mixed up some cinnamon sugar (one tablespoon white sugar, one teaspoon ground cinnamon) and sprinkled it in the buttered bundt pan before pouring in the batter.  For the cake batter, I creamed the butter and sugar first, and added one egg at a time to the mixture.  Also, I used light brown sugar instead of white for the center swirl, and I doubled the recipe for the swirl.  It's actually better if you let it sit overnight; the cake gets moister, especially around the swirl.  The perfect breakfast cake... just sweet enough for a cup of coffee!

DIVINE! Made in my Nordicware bundt pan and when dusting flour on the pan, dusted some cinnamon as well. Tastes great and looks cute! 2 little changes: added 1 Tsp of cinnamon to the batter and instead of sugar I used a mix of Splenda+brown sugar to try and decrease a few Kcal.

I like this recipe better every time I try it. I double the cinnamon filling (1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white), and also add 2/3 c. buttermilk to the batter because it's too thick to pour, and bake at 350 for 45 min. I also put the chopped walnuts into the filling, not the batter, and add a confectioner's sugar glaze. It's becoming one of our favorites since I always have these ingredients on hand. I still think the original directions are funky - always cream the butter and sugar together then add eggs one at a time.

I thought this was pretty good. Not a show-stopper, but a nice coffee cake with good flavor. I made a few modifications: creamed the sugar and butter first, then added the eggs, and vanilla. Added the flour mixture and the sour cream. Used brown sugar (instead of white) with the cinnamon for the swirl mixture. I baked at 350 for the whole time instead of starting at 400. I ended up baking for just under an hour, and I think that might have been a bit too long, as I felt this cake was slightly drier than I had hoped. I love having a coffee cake on hand for weekend visitors, so I'm sure I'll try this again.

Awesome recipe!!! Only thing I did different was to use brown sugar/cinnamon mix for the middle and I cooked at 350 the entire time. Turned out perfect!! I made it yesterday & there are only a few pieces left today.

I am not normally a 'from scratch' cake baker, but this recipe came out well for me. I actually 'swirled' my cinnamon filling instead of layering it - by puting in a layer and cutting it through the batter with a knife, then a layer of batter and cutting again. I melted cream cheese icing, added a little of the cinnamon filling, and drizzled it over the cake. Very good, thanks.

Made this for Sunday School and got several compliments.  Good consistency.  I used brown sugar and Pampered Chef's "Cinnamon Plus" (which includes clove, orange peel, and other spices) for the filling.  This is a keeper!

I've made this recipe quite a few times. I've tried using milk instead of sour cream (as I had no sour cream), cut out the sour cream all together, and let me tell you it never comes out right without the sour cream. Also I've tried it with and without nutmeg. After very many tries I've found it to be perfect how it is and doubled the filling (also make filling with brown sugar) to split in the batter. Also sprinkling the pan with cinnamon sugar is a must.

I made this cake for the first time Christmas 2011.  It was a big hit.   I've since made it for special occasions and birthdays.   It's supper moist and flavorful without being too sweet.       The only problem I encountered was having clumps of cinnamon/sugar mixture in the finished cake.  I solved this by mixing the cinnamon/sugar blend  into a 1/2 cup of the prepared cake batter and adding that to the center of the cake. Also, I topped the cake with a cream cheese glaze and pressed crushed walnuts into it before it set.   I am a novice at baking and was very pleased with the finished product.   The center swirl really sets it off.  It is a very beautiful cake.    Add it to any desert tray with a slice or two cut out and it will be the center of attention (until it is devoured. ) Ruth thank you for adding this recipe.   It has become one of my favorites to give as gifts.

Yum this was really good. I did follow the modifications suggested by the "most helpfull" review as follows: Cream butter and sugar first, add eggs one at a time, then vanilla. Add sour cream and flour mixture alternately, beginning and ending with flour. To avoid a crusty, over-baked exterior bake at standard 350 degrees. Also, for a moist cake, do not overbake!

This went over great at work and everyone loved it!  It was quick and easy!  My only changes were to make 2 swirls throughout instead of just one.  This is a keeper!

This recipe was delicious! My family thoroughly enjoyed every bite! Instead of sour cream I used plain yogurt. I also used brown sugar instead of white in the swirl and doubled the amount.

Very good recipe!  This was family approved.  I left out the walnuts due to allergies in the family but left the recipe the same otherwise.  Yum, it was nice and moist.

I made this cake minus using the walnuts and used a mixture of different nuts using 1/2 cup.  The cake was delicious!  For the icing I used 1 cup of Confectioner's Sugar, 2 TB milk and 1 tsp of vanilla.

I love this recipe. It is so moist. I added chocolate chips though. It was so good. My family loved it! Next time I will leave out the chocolate and try a simple glaze on top.

Just follow the previous suggestions to cream the butter and sugar first, double the cinnamon/sugar filling and to bake it at 350 the whole time and you'll be fine. I used my DeMarle silicon bundt mold, and the cake came out moist and nonsticky. I also drizzled a vanilla glaze over the top.

This was awesome!  My husband was telling me of a cake like this his mom used to make him so I came to this site & found this recipe.  He was in heaven!!  The only modification I made was to double the swirl mix & use brown instead of white sugar for it.  I also used a powdered sugar glaze to finish it off.  Delishhhhhhh!

I just made this cake for a work colleagues birthday.  I only made a couple of adjustments to the recipe.  I used castor sugar instead of normal sugar and I used 1 cup sugar and 2 tbsp of cinnamon.  I made two layers of the sugar mix, one of which I sprinkled slivered almonds on as well.

The cake turned out very moist and it was devoured in seconds!  I had to cook it a bit longer than stated, but I think my oven runs a bit slow.

Good cake!  I left out the walnuts (didn't have any), doubled the sugar/cinnamon mix (also used brown sugar), mixed 1 cup of fresh cranberries with the sugar swirl and  added 1 tsp almond extract to batter.  I also just baked it in a 350 degree oven for 50 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  This made a very tasty cake!  I will make it again, perhaps adding different types of fruit to the filling.  Maybe Rhubarb??!!

Very good cake. I made two within the last week. I took the advice of another person and doubled the sugar/cinnamon mixture used for the swirl. This will be a regular at my house. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe boost my confidence after failed at making cinnamon rolls. Thought it will be difficult to create t6hat swirling brown line in the cake but mine turns out exactly as the pic shows. Easy and yummy, for sure. 

I made some changes. Separately, I beat the eggs until fluffy then add vanilla, mix flour with baking powder, mix yoghurt (I didn't use sour cream) with baking soda (it creates bubbles), then fold them all, alternating between powder and yoghurt mixture into the eggs. Then the nuts. The result is really satisfying to my taste. Crusty on the outside, moist and yummy inside. Awesome! 

Thank you for sharing!

This cake was delicious.  I had to add milk to it because the batter was a little low, but no other changes.  I will definitely be making this again.  I also made a glaze from another recipe on this site to use on it.  Fantastic together.

I decided to make this but didn't have enough butter so I halved it with Crisco and I did what the suggestions said about butter and sugar first then eggs and vanilla. I also halved the sour cream with milk and it turned out great. My boyfriend loves it! He can be pretty picky but it seemed to work out well.

A delicious cake!  As other reviewers suggested I used pecans instead of walnuts, doubled the cinnamon sugar mixture in the cake and added brown sugar to it, and coated the Bundt pan with cinnamon and sugar.   I drizzled a cream cheese/marzipan icing over the top, sprinkled with more chopped pecans, and served it as dessert, with Arabic coffee.  Definitely my new favorite coffee cake recipe!

Very, very good coffee cake. I follow the recommendations from GinnyLovesWhenIBake (6/11/09) and recommend you do so as well.  This cake stays moist for a day or so if well wrapped, and freezes well.

I really liked this...Although I did need to make a substitution - I didn't have enough sour cream and don't use plain yogurt.  Soooooo, I used peach non fat yogurt.  Surprisingly nice change, very subtle peach flavor.  I certainly will make this for my "yellow bus of freedom brunch" (first day of school party for moms)with the suggested brown sugar and maybe even another fruity yogurt!

This was soooo good!  Our family of 3 ate it up in about 2 days!  It was so moist and the flavour was perfect.  I made more of the cinnamon and brown sugar mix, and that made the cake sweeter.  Next time I will put two layers of cake, and two layers of the brown sugar mix for more colour and flavour.  This cake is great for a mid morning coffee or for dessert.

This was a very good cake. Easy to make, I just whipped it up in the morning and was ready by early afternoon! Slipped right out of the pan! I too used butter spray, and would also suggest doubling the cinnamon center. Rave reviews from my husbands office, I will make this one again!

Very tasty, and not too sweet - which I like! - but I found it a little too much like a pound cake for my personal taste. I prefer a coffee cake that is a little "cakier," if you know what I mean. Great recipe if that's what you're looking for, though!

My family and I loved this mice moist coffee cake. Made it on Saturday afternoon and it was gone by Sunday afternoon. I did modify a couple of things: 1st I substituted greek yogurt for sour cream and used one and a quarter cup. 2nd I used  brown sugar  in the filling and it was great. I also used a bundt pan, sprayed it well and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar in it. Did everything else exactly as the recipe directs. It was great! This is definitely going to be a new favorite! Thanks!

This was the first coffee cake I ever made, and it was insanely delicious!! So easy to make. I made a little icing to drizzle on top, which was the perfect finishing touch. It was hard to control myself and not eat half of it in one sitting!

I made my first cinnamon swirl coffee cake this past weekend, using this recipe.  I omitted the walnuts, doubled the cinnamon/sugar filling - using brown sugar for the filling as some other reviewers suggested.  And also made a glaze for the top, using confectioner's sugar, milk and vanilla.  I baked at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.  I was very pleased with the results, considering this was my first attempt - and I am not much of a baker.  I enjoy baking, but only do so in moderation - as my husband and I aren't big dessert eaters.

We really liked this cake. I used yogurt (whole milk plain) instead of the sour cream and whole wheat pastry flour in lieu of all purpose. It was nice and moist and tasted great. Not sure why anyone found this bland or dry. This will be a good base recipe to make either as-is or to play around with. Thanks!

This coffee cake turned out so well - dense but moist. I'll definitely make it again. Like others, I used the regular way of mixing ingredients for a cake: creamed together the butter and sugar, then added the eggs one at a time and then the vanilla. In a separate bowl, combined the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Alternated adding the flour mixture and sour cream until it was combined. Don't overmix once the flour is added.

Made this exactly as written except, like everyone else, I substituted brown sugar for the confectioners powdered sugar. I made mine in a bundt pan and baked it for 50 minutes. Came out perfect and delicious!!

This is in the oven now, and I'm sure it will turn out delicious, but it only halfway filled the pan. I didn't use the walnuts, but that 1/2 cup difference shouldn't only half-fill a 10 inch bundt! For that reason, I probably won't try this recipe again.

**NOTE: It rose enough to fill the pan and made a very nice moist cake. I should have read the other reviews and done twice the cinnamon mixture so I could have done two rows of cinnamon. I added a simple icing on top as well.

This was pretty tasty. To be honest I am not sure if it was something I did, but it was pretty dry tasting. I was hoping it would be more moist. But I made it for Easter and everyone loved it.

I had grown tired of the yellow cake mix coffee cake...began to taste too boxed, so I searched for a quick and easy "from scratch" version.  This cake was very good--not too sweet, but an excellent cake for breakfast or with coffee/tea. 

My Bundt pan was actually a larger tube pan...so I adjusted the time (5 mins. at 400) and then it finished baking at 350 in about 30 mins.  Also, one kid doesn't like walnuts, so I substituted mini chocolate chips.  I drizzled a cream cheese frosting (like for cinnamon buns) and it was delicious!

Lovely!  Very moist, with a perfect crust.  I sprinkled sugar and cinnamon in the buttered pan, dropped a little jam on top of the filling, and reduced the oven temp to 345 for the last 20ish minutes (I have a dark non-stick bundt).  Will make again.

I thought this was delicious, as did everyone who had a slice. Very moist. We had this for after dinner and breakfast the next day. I made no real modifications to the recipe, used unsalted butter. Will be baking another one this week.

This cake was just ok for me.  It didn't have as much flavor as I wish it did.  I would recommend adding a sugar/cinnamon mixture on the bottom of the pan.  And maybe something extra for the filling like a fruit filling.

Great cake! I made this dairy and nut free, and it came out really good. I used tofutti fake sour cream (used the whole 12oz tub) , and trans fat free marg.  At first I was surprised by the very thick batter (I couldn't even pour it) but spooned it into the pan and layered it with the brown sugar and cinnamon, and then it sort of melted in the oven, and rose really nicely. For those who have a problem removing it from the pan--check out nordicware's website. Always oil and flour the pan, and EXACTLY 10 minutes after it comes out the oven, run a plastic knive around the cake, and the center post and then put a plate on top and flip it.  (If it doesn't slide out, use the knive again).  ENJOY!

a great base recipe begging for some spin offs. i think i'll work on some variations for this next time though it was very good as is as well.  i did use brown sugar rather than white for the cinnamon mixture and i added the chopped walnuts to the cinnamon mix rather than the batter itself.  i made a glaze for the cake with 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons milk.  this cake is moist and delicious but not overly sweet.  i actually think that it wouldn't have been sweet enough had i not put the glaze on.  it actually reminds me of a cinnamon roll but with a different texture (cake-like instead of bread-like).  next time i think i'll do some experimenting and try adding almond extract instead of vanilla and maybe i'll make extra cinnamon/brown sugar/walnut mixture and try putting a layer at the bottom before putting in the batter... wonder if that might burn though? hmmmmmm... also, i was a little worried because the batter seemed REALLY thick (i definitely couldn't "pour" the batter in the bundt pan, it was spooning and scraping) but in the end it turned out perfectly all the same.

What a yummy treat! I doubled the cinnamon/sugar filling (making it with brown sugar). I added 1 t. cinnamon to the batter. I also sprinkled cinnamon/sugar onto the sprayed pan before putting the batter in. I topped the cooled cake with vanilla glaze (recipe on this site). I baked it exactly as the directions, but covered the cake for the last 10 minutes because it seemed to be getting a little dark. The cake was dense and moist--just like coffee cake should be!

I had such a "taste" for cinnamon coffee cake when I made this; maybe I set my sights too high!  I can say that this had a wonderful "crumb" and was nicely moist.  However, the "swirl" was almost non-existent; I would recommend maybe doubling it.   Overall, a nice cake, but not what I was looking for.  Thank you, Ruth, for sharing this!

I gave this cake as a gift to a friend who's sick. It went over amazingly! Here are the changes I made: I mixed a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon into the batter itself, and used pecans instead of walnuts. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon-sugar filling. When the cake was done, I made a caramel sauce on the stove and sprinkled the top with pecans. (Just melt down about a half bag of wrapped caramels with a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream.) It was absolutely delicious! Kept for days and delighted my friend.

Even with my healthier substitutions to this it still came out great!  I used coconut sugar for the first time since it is lower on the glycemic scale than sugar and used organic white whole wheat flour for the majority of the flour.  I used half regular and half low fat sour cream because that is what I had in the house.  Even with the whole wheat substitution this came out moist and delicious. Vietnamese cassia cinnamon and coconut sugar made up the filling and I wish I had increased the amount.  I am not sure, but that could have been because of a difference in sweetness between regular and coconut sugar.  Great recipe!

SO GOOD!  I used light sour cream and subbed brown sugar for the filling.
Delicious cake!

Mmmm so yummy! We like nuts so I used 1 1/2 cups of walnuts and I baked it at 350* for 45 min and it turned out great! Great with coffee or milk :)

I had never made a coffee cake before and this one seemed easy enough. I was right! It took me about 15 minutes to get the batter together and then of course the additional time for baking. But I shockingly got it done in time for Sunday school before church this morning!

My husband loved it and he doesn't like sweets at all! So it was a winner there.

I increased the sour cream by 1/2 cup and followed another reviewer's advice and doubled the filling mix as well and used brown sugar instead of white. I also left out the nuts, not a big nut fan. 

Great recipe, easy to fix, and quick on top of that!

I also doubled the cinnamon/sugar mix and made a couple of layers throughout the cake.  It was delicious!  Will make this again for sure....

Delicious! I used half brown half white sugar in the cake, and all brown in the swirl, and upped the cinnamon to 1.5 T and sugar to 1/3 cup. My DH loved it! Thanks!

Wow...very good coffee cake.  I just had a slice, still warm from the oven.  Very moist with a slightly crunchy top crust.  I used a low-fat sour cream and it worked wonderfully.  I'll make this one again.

This is such a great recipe.  I actually didn't have any (on SBD diet).  But purely made this one for my husband and friends on Sunday.  My friend even brought half of the cake home..  I will make it again for sure.

This cake was a real hit last night with my after-dinner coffee.  I did double the sugar/cinnamon mixture for added cinnamon taste and it was great!  The cake was moist and beautiful!  Definately a keeper!

Okay, I made this for a Sunday School breakfast and it was actually pretty good.  My 'swirl' was more like a blur but it still tasted very good.  I will add more of the cinnamon next time and maybe a tad bit of nutmeg too.  I did have a little bit left over but my husband fixed that for me.

Although I did follow previous posts and double the filling, it didn't do much for this recipie.  It was dry and lacking something.  Half of the cake is still sitting there after 3 days.

My hubby liked it, so I'll give 4 stars.  I was not that crazy about it though.  It seemed to be lacking something, not sure what though.  I'll keep looking for another recipe.

I made this recipe "as is."  It was delicious and everyone loved it.  The cake was very moist and came right out of the pan.  However, I would like to make 2 layers of the cinnamon swirl next time and use the brown sugar as others have suggested.  I will definitely be making this again!

I loved this cake! It was very easy to make ~ and tastes great. I expected it to be a little dry, but it was moist and fantastic! I had NO problem getting the cake out of the pan either! I used a non stick bundt pan and a quick spray of Pam! I would love to experiment with it more by using brown sugar and possibly sprinkling the pan with sugar before putting the batter in. I did not use walnuts and it was wonderful!

I have gotten more compliments on this coffee cake!! I also substitute brown sugar for the white {to mix with the cinnamon}. It really is light and airy, NOT dry at all, and absolutely delicious. This is the coffee cake I make when I want to impress my visitors or when I go for coffee at someone else's house! I've also baked this in 2 loaf pans and it's come out quite good-one's usually a little bigger than the other but that's ok..... Thanks for the great recipe Ruth!

I've made many coffee cakes over the years, and this is the best yet.
I found it very easy to prepare but would suggest that you cream the butter and sugar together before adding the eggs as I had some trouble getting the butter to mix in properly.
This cake rose just beautifully in my bundt pan and was really light and airy.

This, although easy to make, was nothing really stellar - I was a little disappointed (no one asked for the recipe).  I didn't do anything to reduce fat and it was dry - probably won't make again.  Sorry.

Added some brown sugar to the cinnamon sugar mixture! Topped with a confectioners sugar frosting and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top. I also cooked the cake at 350 the whole time rather than the suggested 8 min at 400.

This is my favorite non-fruit coffee cake so far! The sour cream really helps to keep the moisture so it's not a dry cake. Only change I made was using brown sugar for the cinnamon mixture instead of white sugar. Also, since I love cinnamon I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture. AND you can never go wrong with glaze... I topped this recipe off with 1 c. powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract on top. 
This is my second time making it in a week because the first time I made it and brought it to a meeting, it was devoured!

Very good!  I was looking for a coffee cake that would let me use what I had on hand and this one fit the bill. I followed directions except to use pecans instead of walnuts. It came out great. And the cake was so flavorful that it didn't require any icing. It was really ideal with morning coffee or tea. Next time I might consider trying to add a crumb topping, but I hesitate to mess with success.

This recipe is great. It was easy to make, with very few changes. A few reviews I noticed mentioned theirs turned out dry, mine did not. It was moist & fluffy and has stayed that way for 3 days! Perhaps their baking soda has gone flat? I did substitute 1/4 c of margarine in place of 1/4 c butter, added an extra 1/4 c sour cream, added 1 c of raisins, and I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon directly to the batter. Made a simple powdered sugar & milk glaze and added cinnamon to that as well. Will definitely make again!

I wish I read the other reviews first. I will make this again but with brown sugar! It tastes strange as is..not like coffee cake. I had some with my coffee this morning and it was still good. I did add an icing as others suggested (vanilla, powdered sugar and milk).

This is the first time I've tried making a cake and I was  pleased how it turned out. The only thing I would do different is add more sour cream to make it more moist and add glaze to the top. Any suggestions would be welcome.......

Delicious although I over baked it a bit - I'd definitely check at least 5 minutes sooner than the shorter time.

Very elegant, and not too sweet. Fairly easy to make, and the time put into it was  definitely worth it! Will make again.

Visually, this is a really pretty cake.  It's a little on the dry side, but my co-workers loved it.  I think next time I might add some applesauce or vegetable oil so that it's not so dry.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top which made it look really pretty as well.

I just made this! Wow! Followed it to the T except i used 1/2 tsp almond extract because I was out of vanilla and brown sugar instead of white for the topping. Super moist and much tastier than the coffe cake recipe that uses cake mix. Thank you!

I made some modifications to the recipe- 1. I thought it came out a little dry so I added 1/4 cup more sour cream and 2 tbls. butter. Next, while the swirl is beautiful, I was in a hurry so I combined the cinnamon into the batter. I increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tbls. and increased the vanilla to 2 tsp. I also changed the additional 1/4 c. sugar for the swirl to 1/4 c. brown sugar and mixed it into the batter with the other sugar at the beginning. 3. I followed the traditional pattern of creaming the butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, sour cream, dry mixture. 4. I baked it in two large loaf pans (about 45-50 minutes at 350 degrees) and added a crumble to the top. The crumble is 1/2 c. pecans, 1/3 c. sugar, 1/3 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. softened butter and 1/3 c. flour. Mix together and sprinkle over the top before baking.

This came out very moist and the cinnamon flavor was delicious! I substituted buttermilk for sour cream (didn't have any), added a tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the batter along with a little more sugar than stated, and I made a glaze to drizzle over the top using the recipe "Baking is Awesome" gave but doubling it.

Didn't have a bundt pan so I made it in a 9 inch square pan, sprayed with cooking spray.  Worked out great!  I made a few minor tweaks:  added to the flour mixture 1/4 tsp salt since I used unsalted butter, and added some cinnamon as another reviewer recommended.  sprinkled half the nuts (I used pecans instead of walnuts) onto the cinnamon-sugar mixture in the middle.  Also since I ran out of white sugar, I used brown sugar in the cinnamon-sugar mixture and it was great.  Would do that again.

This cake was a huge hit. I loved it. I made a little extra of the Cinnamon mixture. I also used nonfat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and it was so moist. Loved this cake and will be making it again.

It was great, kids loved it.  Made these changes: substituted nonfat plain greek yogurt for sour cream (because I didn't have sour cream), also based on reviewers suggestions I doubled streusal quantities & used brown sugar instead of white, baked at 350F the entire time (about 40 min), 'floured' the bundt pan with cinnamon sugar.  It's probably even better with sour cream, will try that next time!

Everyone at work loved it. Didn't use the nuts so it was safe for those with nut allergies. Also did half regular and half brown sugar for the swirl and left about a tablespoon to sprinkle over it all when it was done. Substituted sour cream with 2% Greek yogurt. Delicious and moist. Not too sweet.

This is one of my go to recipes for work or church functions.  everyone loves it.   i double the cinnamon/ brown sugar mixture and make 2 swirls in the cake instead of one. other than that i follow the recipe exactly.  I've used several different glades to top it and its always a hit.  thank you so much for this receipt

Made this as written.  Cake turned out well but we found it lacked a little bit in the flavour.  When I made again I added cinnamon to the flour mixture and for the swirl, I used brown sugar with extra cinnamon as well.  Hubby loves cinnamon and likes this cake much better since I made the changes.
Good Cake.

Very delicious coffee cake. Read all the reviews and took from them. I've always creamed butter and sugar first then added eggs one at a time. Once all the ingredients were combined,I mixed the batter another 2 minutes at medium speed.I doubled the cinnamon/sugar and made 2 layers. For the reviewer who's batter didn't fill the pan, I don't know what happened I had a very full pan and yielded a nice size bundt cake.

I really like this recipe but I did tweak it some - I coated the pan with cinnamon and sugar (and next time I make this I will be more generous with the coating). I used brown sugar for the filling and and added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans, because I had a guest coming and she is fond of pecans. The only disappointment was that the filling seemed to sink to the bottom of the cake - maybe too many nuts? I decided to add a glaze, and the normal confectioner's sugar glaze just didn't have the zip I wanted so I used Amaretto as a flavoring, which got a lot of compliments. Next time I think I will double the filling though, as it seemed a bit thin. Overall, a very very nice cake, my company loved it and its really easy to make.

One of my family's favorite cinnamon recipes. The sour cream is key to the soft, tender  consistancy of this cake.  I use brown sugar for the filling, and double the amounts.  Makes a delicious, gooey center.  Moist and delicious every time!

Very easy and delicious cake to make! My husband is German and while he likes cookies and brownies, what he really loves is cake. He was craving a cake one afternoon and I found this one. I had all the ingredients on hand. My husband would not stop talking about how good it was! It has a great texture and it is not too sweet. Perfect with coffee. I did not add icing. Baked at 45 minutes at 350 degrees in our Bosch on convention bake. I also used brown sugar for the swirl in the center.

This coffee cake is wonderful. After greasing the pan I sprinkled it with sugar; more appealing than flour. I use a brand of sour cream that is super thick so the batter could not be poured the way the instructions say to. I just dropped by spoonfuls around the pan and lighty spread to even. The batter only fills the pan 1/2 way, but it rises nice and high to fill the whole pan. I, like some other reviewers, baked at 350 for 45 min. It came out perfect.

This is the most delicious coffee cake ever!  I brought it into work for our annual Christmas feast, and it got devoured very quickly.   I did have a problem with it sticking to the bundt pan, so I floured the pan in addition to greasing it, and that worked.  I also left out the walnuts and substituted a half teaspoon of almond extract for half the vanilla.  I glazed it with a quarter cup of butter, a half cup of dark brown sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of cinnamon melted together in a saucepan.  YUM!

This cake turned out a little dry. I baked it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, next time I'll check it starting at 25 minutes. I used fat free vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream (didn't have any, maybe next time), and left out the nuts. I subbed brown sugar for white in the cinnamon mixture (I doubled both.) Nice taste, nice texture. I'll make this again.

Really good and I was able to make it MUCH healthier without sacrificing any flavor! I used only 1/4 cup of butter and a snack sized cup of apple sauce (1/2 cup?), 1 scant cup of Splenda, and all white whole wheat flour. It was still rich and moist. I think that it would make a great 9 x 13 coffee cake with a crumb topping! I will make again.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions about creaming the butter and sugar, and used brown sugar instead of white.  The result was very good, and even better the next day. The recipe is a little confusing about how much of the cinnamon-sugar mixture to put in the middle of the batter. (Does "generously" mean all of the mixture or not?)  Use ALL the mixture.  Next time I'll try it with white sugar and a glaze on top. Thanks for a tasty recipe.

I've been baking for years, and both my parents said this was the best cake I've ever made. Moist, not too sweet, and the perfect amount of cinnamon. Delicious!

Wow, just finished eating a piece and it was fantastic.  I used light sour cream, I can't believe its not butter light and egg beaters in place of full fat ingredients (what I normally do) and no nuts.  The cake rose fine and didn't suffer texture-wise.  It was very moist even without the glaze!  Based on reviews I used 1.5 times the sugar/cinnamon mixture and lightly glazed part  with a powdered sugar cake glaze.  Will definitely make again - probably as individual muffins.

Moist and delicious! I used half white sugar and half brown sugar for the cinnamon swirl and it was fantastic. I might make a bit more of the cinnamon swirl just to make it even more noticeable. Wonderful and easy!

This turned out really good. I used nonfat plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I was concerned at first because the batter was VERY thick, I couldn't pour it at all. But I spooned it in and spread it in the pan and it came out fine.  Next time I will use a bit more walnuts, I don't think 1/2 c. is enough. Also a bit more cinnamon/sugar in the middle. I think doubling it might be overkill but maybe just a bit more. I used a powdered sugar glaze over this.

My bundt cakes always turn out so dry you could sand walls with them, but this recipe is an absolute winner. I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and the result was Bundt-Meets-Cinnnabon, which makes me wonder how amazing it would be with a bit of cream cheese swirled in there as well.  Mmmmm ... cinnamony melted cream cheese ... *drools*

I followed the recipe as stated and found the volume of batter was low.  I was scrambling to pour 2 layers…..not enough batter.  Next time I’ll add about 20% more flour and buttermilk to the recipe to extend the batter.  Otherwise this is a wonderful, delicious recipe everyone loved, including my in-laws.

Yum! Good coffee cake. Used brown sugar for the swirl and reduced the white sugar to 1 and a quarter cups and it was just the right sweet. Might reduce the white sugar even more the next time. Dusted with icing sugar, very pretty!

Amazing coffee cake. It came out moist and delicious. The Cinnamon swirled. I didn't add all of the cinnamon and sugar mix because it would have turned out too sweet. I would reduce the amount of sugar added in the cinnamon-sugar combination to 30mL with 15mL of cinnamon. I shifted the flour.

This was excellent. I doubled the swirl mixture using brown sugar and cinnamon instead of white and cooked it at 350 degrees for 46 minutes, I also put white frosting on it. as others had suggested. Everyone loved it. I will make this recipe one of my favorites.

This was great! I, like many, changed the order in which I added the ingredients.  I also topped it with a vanilla cinnamon frosting made from store-bought vanilla frosting that I microwaved until it was runny, then added a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon.  I then drizzled it over the cooled cake. YUM!!!!!

This was so good.  I also creamed the butter with the sugar and used brown sugar for the filling instead of white.  My family loved it so much that it was gone before it had a chance to get cool.  Will DEFINITELY make this again.  Thanks for such an easy and  yummy recipe.

Moist and delicious.  Pefect with coffee or tea.  I too doubled the filling and used brown sugar instead of white.  I also used 1/2 brown sugar in the batter.  I lined the pan with sugar crystals before adding the batter and it helped give the cake a kick (the cake itself is a tad bland), but with the filling (if its doubled), the overall experience is yummy.

This is so tasty and moist. I only made one change because somehow I ran out of sugar. I can't believe it myself. So for the cinnamon sugar center I had to use a cinn/sugar mix that i bought. So I don't know how much cinnamon vs. sugar there was. I put enough to coat the mix. I served this for breakfast with cream cheese frosting on it and a slice of watermelon.

I followed the recipe exactly, and while the cake looked delicious, the "cake" part was very bland.  It was missing something, and I couldn't put my finger on it.  The sugar/cinnamon mixture was good, if it wasn't for that, I may have tossed the whole cake.

I made this to take to the hospital after my niece was born and it was an absolute hit.  I used brown sugar instead of white for the filling and doubled the mixture to add more layers.  I also used light sour cream to shave some calories.

I personally thought this cake was ok, but my family LOVED it, absolutely loved it.  They devoured it within 2 days even though they "only like chocolate cake".  I followed the recipe except I added chocolate-covered toffee bits along with the cinnamon/brown sugar filling.

great texture! but it seems to be missing something. I did make a couple changes though, half butter/half applesauce, brown sugar, and no nuts. I also did not read the rcipe correctly and made a few mistakes, I mixed the eggs and butter together then added sugar, I also mixed the cinnamon and sugar in the cake instead of layering (i misread it). But the cake still turned out great it was very moist. I probably needs the nuts and the layering. Icing would be great as well.

Wonderful, moist, just-sweet-enough coffee cake! I thought I had enough sour cream, but only had 1/2 cup so I used that plus 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt and it turned out! I would give this 5 stars, but I think it needs a light glaze on top. I made a quick one out of powdered sugar, milk, and melted butter. It looks beautiful and tastes wonderful. Worth the *little* extra effort vs. using a cake mix. Yum!

The first time I made this cake, it was a disaster. I don't think I've ever had a cake turn out that dry that hadn't been seriously overbaked, but something happened and it was inedible.

The recipe was worth trying again, but I made some changes the second time around. I changed the 3/4 cup of butter to 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup canola oil, added 1/2 tsp of salt and then thinned the batter out with maybe 1/4 cup of water...the batter's thickness was what I had noticed about the first cake. I also took this cake out at 35 minutes rather than 40.
VERY good cake. Perfect to go with coffee. Moist and not too sweet, but with a great flavor. Definitely a keeper.

This coffee cake is exceptional.  I read the reviews and used several ideas.  I have made this a couple of times now and think the following make great adjustments:  In the swirl layer, substitue brown sugar.  I put enough brown sugar to completely cover the dough underneath and then sprinkle about 1 tsp. of cinnamon on top of that.  I also added a frosting the second time around of 3 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 bag of powdered sugar, 1/2 stick of softened butter, 1/2 tsp almond flavoring, and enough milk to make it the consistency you want, beat together with the mixer.  Spread on cooled cake.Very addicting and delicious!

FAN-tastic... The only reason for 4 stars is the cake by itself doesn't do it for me. If there was an icing recipe added this would have been a 5.  It just seems incomplete.  Here is what I used for my icing:

1 stick butter (8 Tbsp)
1 1/2 C. powdered sugar
1/4 C cream cheese
1/2 t. vanilla extract

simply combine all ingredients and beat until fluffy.  Some might consider this icing a little overboard, but it is well worth it!

MMMmmm, good! Added a glaze to the top and made without the nuts. I followed the other suggestions about the order in which to mix the ingredients and didn't have any problems. It was moist and delicious!

What a nice recipe.Only thing I excluded was the walnuts. Lovely textured and the flavour and aroma were excellent. I shall make this again. Its a great cake for beginners as the recipe is so easy to follow. Thanks for sharing, it was a delight to make and eat!

Excellent!!  Followed a few suggestions by other reviewers and used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 plain yogurt and I also used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesause. I also used 3/4 brown sugar and 3/4 cup Splenda..I also made them into muffins instead of a bundt, baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes (made 12 really large muffins)...I also used some of the brown sugar/cinnamon mix and sprinkled it on top of the muffins before I baked them....These were well received an disappeared quickly by the parents at my daughter's soccer game! Thanks for a great recipe!

The texture and taste of this cake is simply excellent. However, for the filling, I added chopped nuts, 1/4 cup flour and 2 tbsp butter (cut in with pastry blender) so it is like a streusel rather than just cinnamon and sugar. This also added some crunch to the filling. I topped it with "Vanilla Glaze" from this site after it cooled completely. Delish!

This recipe is really good. The only problem was that the batter didn't seem sweet enough. 
I ended up making cupcakes instead of using a bundt pan. I did use the brown sugar instead of white for the filling-doubled and used most-and that was really good. I used whole wheat instead of white flour because I like the nuttier flavor (and I was trying to get rid of some guilt!). I sprinkled the brown sugar in the bottom of the cupcake pan, after greasing very well, in the middle, then again on top. I baked a dozen, regular size, at 350 for about 21 minutes. They're really good and I will make this recipe again, but maybe with a little extra sugar next time.

I thought this was average at best.  I definitely would not make it again.  I thought I wanted a change from my Mom's bundt cake, but this surely didn't do it.  It was dense, heavy, and small, like maybe they should have put in 1 tbs of baking powder.  It was a tiny, short bundt cake.

Nice and moist, a very basic coffee cake taste.  The swirl was very pretty and I know I'll be making this again for brunch one day.  One thing I had to change was the baking temp.  400 degrees seemed so high for a cake, I lowered mine to 325 and baked for 1 hour.  It turned out great.

Brought it to the family bunch and my picky brother (yes, he is 38 and still picky) tried it gingerly and then ate with gusto.  I am rating it four stars as the batter was more of a dough than a batter ... I had to spoon it in, it would NOT pour (and I even added milk to try to make it runnier).  It was drier than I had hoped, but just a lovely flavoring.  Not overwhelming and just plan good.  I might play with this some more (use oil instead of butter) and see if I can get it to the consistency I would like.  Great cake, though!

Delicious! I omitted the nuts and also used brown sugar in the topping. Made a lot more of sugar/cinnamon mix and put it in the middle and on top of the cake. I made two heart-shaped cakes and baked them for about 30 minutes. I added 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips to one cake, and that is also very good. As a top reviewer said, cream the sugar and butter together first. Overall great recipe - I will definitely  make it again and again! Thanks!

I've made this cake multiple times. My family loves it, and I like to only make it on special occasions so that they have to wait for it. I've also made it in loaf pans instead of a bunt pan, and just sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on top. I've done the same with muffins, and mini muffins. It's turned out great all three ways.

Not sure what happened here...after 45 minutes outside was cooked perfectly and inside was completely raw.  Scooped out batter and had to cook it for another hour.  Served it cut into pieces and the inside was moist but outside was dry. Very dense and heavy as well.

We really liked this cake. It's quick to make, moist and keeps fresh for a few days. However, I only give this recipe four stars because the cinnamon swirl "baked out," i.e. the sugar caramelized and became as hard as stone. I guess using confectioners sugar could fix that problem.

In my previous review, I failed to include that I also used 1 cup apple butter....This is yummy! These are the changes I made as I tested this for a friend's birthday who has some diet needs: Instead of sour cream, I used no fat plain yogurt; instead of butter, I used fat free I Can't Believe It's Not Butter; instead of sugar, I used Splenda; no nuts; instead of eggs, I used 1-4 oz. container of Egg Beaters. I poured half of batter (2 1/2 c) into a greased 9x9 pan, sprinkled half of Splenda/cinnimon mixture, then other half of batter. I baked it for 30 additional minutes although it probalby could use a few more.

This recipe is delicious! I used fat free vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream because I had no vanilla extract. The only thing I would do differently next time is add a LOT more cinnamon/sugar. It seemed like a lot when I sprinkled it on, but once it bakes there really isn't much. To make it a little sweeter I added a light layer of cream cheese icing and sprinkled more cinnamon sugar on top.  I also made mini loaves instead of a bundt cake, they turned out great.

This cake baked up very nicely, and presented beautifully.  However, it was dry and bland.  The texture was not fine, but a little grainy, somewhat like corn bread.  With all the high ratings I guess I was expecting something spectacular. Even my husband, who is usually very easy to please, commented on the bland flavor and odd texture (he said it was like a sponge).  Thanks anyway.

Everyone, even the kids, loved this recipe.  I had extra cinnamon and sugar left over, so I sprinkled it on the top(which became the bottom after cooking) and it made a sweet surprise for everyone. I will definitely make this again!

I made this last week and it was great.  I did not have any sour cream so I used skim milk with vinegar.  I doubled the filling mixture and used brown sugar instead.  I cooked it five minutes longer.  Def. grease the pan!

This coffee cake turned out wonderful.  It was easy to make, and tastes great.  I really suggest this to anyone who wants something other than icecream for dessert.  It's fabulous and I'll definately make it again!

My daughter altered this recipe by folding sliced almonds instead of walnuts into the batter and won a blue ribbon and class champion for Jr. class coffee cakes at the county fair.  I would say that speaks for itself.

I host a SAHM's coffee group once a week.  I made this for our snack, and it was a huge hit!  I used low fat sour cream, and this was moist and delicous.

I loved this recipe.  I followed another person's advice and used brown sugar as well as white sugar for the filling.  I will add a frosting next time.  I didn't want to use sour cream, so I used 3/4 cup of applesauce instead.  I think it turned out great.

This was very good.  I made it for breakfast one Sunday morning.  I didn't change a thing.  Very, very tasty.  I would recomend some kind of frosting.

This recipe was more than I expected!  I made the cake ahead and froze it until the morning of the birthday party.  Guests were very complimentary about the flavor.  I'll definitely make this one again!

This is a great recipe!  I made it for my boyfriend's family, and it went so fast!  Everyone loved it.  I added a layer of cinnamon and sugar to both the bottom and top of the cake, in addition to the middle.  I still wish it had more of a cinnamony flavor, so next time I plan to put cinnamon in the batter, as well.  :)

Cinnamon-sugar mixture sank to bottom of cake so top of super sticky "baked" cake stuck to bundt form. Whatever I could salvage was "ok" tasting.

Easy to make with ingredients from my pantry, which is always nice. I didn't have any trouble getting it out of the bundt pan because first I sprayed "PAM" on it and it almost slipped right out. I'll be using this recipe again. Thanks!

I made this for a Mother's Day Brunch. I took the other suggestions and used brown sugar with the cinnamon. It was fairly easy to make, had good flavor and everyone seemed to like it. However, no one asked for the recipe and I thought it was a little dry.  I will make again and try adding more sour cream or butter and mix the walnuts with the brown sugar and cinnamon. I also had trouble getting it out of the bundt pan.

I made this for Easter Brunch yesterday and it was a hit with everyone. I used the suggestions of other reviewers and used brown sugar as opposed to white in the filling. This made a beautiful swirl in the middle of the cake.

My mom was wanting to make some sort of a bundt cake so I got on here and found this recipe.  It was really easy and very quick to make.  My mom had all of the ingredients in her cabient and she made it that day and it was gone the next day.  The only thing she did different was she added a very thin glaze to it.  She has added this recipe to her normal collection of recipes. Thanks for the GREAT recipe Ruth!!

This is a wonderful cake! I followed the recipe to the tee, and it came out very moist. The only thing I did do differently, was added some brown sugar to the cinnamon sugar for the filling and it was like having a piece of gooey cinnamon roll cake. I would not advise doing it in a loaf pan though as another member did. I believe that mine would have been even better (if that is possible)if I had used my bundt pan or a regular 9x13 cake pan.

This was wonderful.  It has become a favourite.  The crust has a great crunchy texture, but moist and lovely inside.  I made it for breakfast when I had company and served it with yogurt and fresh fruit.  I mixed the cinnamon with brown sugar instead of white, and used yogurt instead of the sour cream.  We prefer to have the cinnamon in two layers instead of just the one.

I made this for a dinner get-together and everyone (all thirteen people, half of which were children) loved it.  The outside was nice and firm, almost like a crust, and the inside was just fantastic -- not too sweet but very moist and yummy.  Applause! Applause!

I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and baked it at 350 for 1 hour.  It really didn't have a super moist crumb or amazing taste, so don't think I'll make this recipe again.

I made this, only omitting the walnuts, and I used brown sugar for the swirl instead of white.  I also added a dash of nutmeg.  SO GOOD.  I got many compliments.  A wonderful recipe, thank you!

I loved this but did make some adjustments...I used 1 TBLS cinnamon, 1/4 cup of brown sugar & 1/2 cup of white sugar and melted 1/4 stick of butter...combined that all together for my swirl (omitted the nuts) :) I did have some left over but it was a nice thick swirl! I also dusted my pan with a cinnamon/white sugar/brown sugar mix which gave a nice sugar crust ?

This coffee cake is average at best!  I followed the recipe exactly and the cake looked great when it was finished.  However, it was very dry and did not impress me, my husband or family.

I added some cocoa to the mix and had to add some milk since I now had more dry ingredients.  I was not too happy with the cinnamon sugar mixture in the middle-I expected it to be more like a streusel.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I missed the part about turning the oven down to 350.  It didn’t burn or dry out, but I’ll be sure to do it right next time. My husband said it was good, but a little bland. Now I’ve read the comments, and I will make it again soon and add the brown sugar with the cinnamon, and probably double it. We ate cinnamon fanatics! I loved it because it was so easy!

Really moist, delicious coffee cake! I made some changes based on other helpful reviews and turned out great, everyone loved it. Substituted ½ cup finely chopped apples for the walnuts, added ½ tsp cinnamon to the batter and used light sour cream. I doubled the filling using 1/4 cup each of white and brown sugars in addition to 2 Tbsp cinnamon. Split batter into thirds so I could create two layers of filling. Baked at 350 for 50 minutes. Made simple vanilla glaze and drizzled over the top.

I modified the recipe slightly by adding 1/4 brown sugar and 1 cup of white granulated sugar to the cake batter. I also didn’t have sour cream on hand so substituted buttermilk. Instead of the glaze, I dusted it lightly with powdered sugar. It turned out great...really sweet, but great.

I'm a guy. I've made this twice. It's amazing. Try this.... use shortening to coat pan all over. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over that.  It has an amazing crust that reall sets it off. Enjoy

I did follow the recipe, but I only had one tablespoon of sour cream in which I did add. I had to add a quarter cup of vegetable oil and the cake turn out perfect. My wife liked it and that’s a plus for me.

Doubled  the cinnamon mixture and also added 1/4 cup applesauce because of many reviews it was dry despite sour cream, must have done the trick because very moist. Also swirled cinnamon mixture with knife,  baked  10 minutes at 400 degrees and 32 minutes at 350  degrees. Perfect! Make sure to grease and flour pan. Good recipe. Topped with a cinnamon vanilla glaze. Thanks for the recipe Ruth!

I followed the recipe and was very pleased with the result.  Great with your morning coffee! I would reduce the amount of walnuts to 1 cup next time.  I am surprised that there is no mention of a powdered sugar glaze for this coffee cake.  Despite no mention of a glaze in the recipe, I found one:  1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 3 tbsp of milk, and 2 tsp of vanilla extract.  It worked well but I would recommend reducing the vanilla extract to 1 tsp or forget it altogether.

Made this and was disappointed at how bland and dry it came out. I made it following the recipe exactly. If I did it again I would say it need less cooking time and maybe mix in the cinnamon sugar instead of just layering it in the middle.

I love this cake it is so easy!  I use a pint of sour cream (because I didn’t read the amount right.). I loved the results so much I kept making it that way.  Great crumb and cinnamon flavor. A little nutmeg in the cinnamon sugar adds an interesting note.

I think it's pretty good. But it was a little dry, so I put some glaze on it and it became really moist. Also, you should say how much cinnamon sugar to put in, because I didn't get the whole swirl look. I had only put a little on there, we'll actually pretty good amount but it didn't give me that swirl effect, just a little swirl is all I got. Over all it is a pretty good cake almost good as my grandparents coffee cake.

THIs is a great recipe!!!

After I put the first half of the batter in the pan, I realized I had forgotten the nuts! So after I put the cinnamon swirl in I put a layer of pecans. Worked out great!!
Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This is the best tasting coffee cake my family has ever had. My daughter and her friend made this twice this weekend, it is so easy to make. We used brown sugar and cinnamon for the filling and put more on top for a nice crunchy and pretty topping, and we just made it in a 9 x 13 inch cake pan. It was excellent, perfect old fashioned coffee cake taste. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I sprayed my bundt pan with cooking spray and coated it with sugar & cinnamon mixture like one reviewer did. It was good, and it slid right out of the pan. I deleted the nuts, but they would be good in it. I also used brown sugar and some fresh grated nutmeg in the filling. A keeper for sure.

Here I thought mine was so dry because I had a new bundt pan that was non stick and heavy and also that I had never made a bundt cake, but after reading a lot of reviews saying it was dry I guess my pan wasn't the reason. It's a good thing I drizzled a glaze on it otherwise there wouldn't have been much flavor. 
We will eat it as it's not too bad but I don't know if I would bother making it again.

Wow!!!!! Found this by mistake and decided to try it. Well, let me say I’m impressed for sure. I actually made a couple of changes, one by mistake. I read sour cream as cream cheese for some reason but for a very good reason. I used brown sugar in substitute for the 1/4 cup of white sugar. This turn out to be very good. I will make it again

I did not care for this at all. I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the addition of sour cream would make it moist, but it was very dry and much too dense for a coffee cake. I felt it had more of a bread texture and consistency. Also, I don't understand how it's called a swirl cake, as there is only a very shallow layer of cinnamon sugar in the middle of the batter and the mixture is not actually swirled into the cake. I took this to a family Christmas gathering and was very disappointed. No one even tried a slice except for me and my husband. I ended up bringing home almost an entire cake and my husband took it to work with him today. We'll see if anyone in his office cares for it. Next time I will look for a lighter and airier recipe.

Very good coffee cake. It wasn't overly sweet. Most of the sweetness came from the cinnamon-sugar dusting. The sour cream adds a nice extra flavor. Since I don't own a bundt pan, I poured my cake into a 9 x 9 square pan. I put the cinnamon-sugar mixture in the middle and on top. After baking, the dusting on top raised up (which was unintentional) and made a crust. I skipped the walnuts.

This was a really great coffee cake and I will have to make it again sometime.  I did mix in a box of vanilla pudding with the flour mixture for the batter, to get a richer and moist cake.  Used brown sugar instead of the white sugar, for the cinnamon layer inside.  I next time will double the brown sugar but leave the cinnamon the same, and do two layers inside.  I also only did half of it with the nuts, since my hubby doesn't like them added, and I added them in the middle instead of in the batter.  I cooked at 350 for around 40-45 minutes and it was perfect.  After cooling down, I added an icing drizzle on top.  We ate it warm right away, but it was even better and more moist the next day.  Thank you for the recipe!

Used reduced fat sour cream, a little more than the recipe. Cooked at 350 for 45 minutes, 30 minutes on "speed bake" air setting, which is similar to convection on my oven. added nuts to the cinnamon sugar mixture. Sprinkled a little of the cinnamon mixture on the top before putting in the oven. I didn't have vanilla extract, so I used 1/2 syrup, 1/2 almond syrup. Topped with a little sugar glaze at the end. yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. Not my favorite coffee cake. I feel it needs additional fat  & a shorter baking time. I baked at the suggested temperature, had to take it out 10 minutes early & it was over baked. Several reviewers added additional brown sugar with the cinnamon for the swirl & I would agree that would have been a good addition. I did make a powdered sugar, milk & vanilla icing to drizzle over the cake, which added a bit of needed sweetness.

I've made this one 3 times since November and it's been a hit every time!  My only recommendation is to NOT use spray Pam on the pan. Instead, I  happened upon the  awesome advice to mix equal parts of  shortening, veg oil and flour.  I mixed 1/3 cup of each and used it for 4 or 5 bundt pans, simply by using a paper towel and wiping it into the pan. This keeps the outer edge of the cake from getting  too crisp/hard.

Saved the nuts for cookies because I wasn't sure that they would fit in here... glad I did.  My swirl was top heavy, will try with less to start with.  I also wish I had taken it out a little earlier than the full time.  I cut it after leaving it for 6 hours and it is great!  Definitely planning to make this again.

Oh yeah, used buttery Pam and cinnamon sugar on the outside and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white... and had some leftover.  I did not glaze but ate it with butter.  Will stick with that, too.

The recipe calls for 3/4 cup butter...this results in a dry cake...use  1 cup butter for a much better result.  The addition of the walnuts dry out the cake so more butter is a better option.  I have tried this recipe twice now following it and its been dry.

Yes I will definitely make this again.  I had no sour cream so I used milk instead.  I also replaced the walnuts with 1 cup of raisins.  This cake was very easy to make. It was very moist and tasty.

I halved the butter and used coconut oil for other 1/2. Like others I used brown sugar on topping and added chopped pecans to this.  Also made icing

So yummy! I had to make a couple changes and it was delicious! My son is allergic to eggs so I used 2 "flax eggs" and 3 tbsp aquafaba from garbanzo beans. Also, I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream because I didn't have any. Still so yummy!

Love this recipe! Everyone that has it raves about it. I get many requests. It's simple and delicious. I glaze it or sometimes make a streusel for it. A simple flavor that can easily be modified.

Loved it, loved it, loved it. Made it for a family meet, and disappeared in a flash. Lowered the sugar content, but otherwise, the flavor and texture is great. Will make again.

I've made this a few times now and agree that a constant temp of 350 is great if you don't want a crunchier exterior (some people like that though, especially with a coffee cake). The recipe has been modified to cream the sugar and butter first so I can skip that detail.  I doubled the filling the second time because we love cinnamon. I also added a simple glaze. Delicious and moist. Quick and easy.

Easy and good recipe. The cake was more moist and fluffier than I would expect from a regular coffee cake but it was still nice for my taste. I made some modifications to the recipe (2% milk with lemon juice instead of sour cream, 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and 1 cup of sugar instead of 1.5 cups) but it still turned out great!

This cake had a nice flavor, however, I can say it was  TAD dry.  Also the cinnamon in the middle turned into a "cinnamon crunch"  I would probably look for another cinnamon bundt cake but overall it did have a good flavor.

Texture and taste are great  - my husband loved it. 
I did add chocolate chips to the cake batter and placed the walnuts within the swirl (instead of throughout the cake).
No other changes and I didn't even add an icing.

Followed recipe and it was moist and had just enough filling without making it too sweet. I also drizzled vanilla icing on it. Had it with coffee last night.

This coffee cake turned out SO good! I was very intimidated to attempt a coffee cake and this recipe was very easy to follow. The only thing I changed was omitting the walnuts and substituting brown sugar/cinnamon instead of white sugar/cinnamon for the filling. It tasted especially good the day after. Thank you so much for a great recipe! My hubby loved it and I will be sure to use it again!

It was really delicious and very moist.I alternated as others have mentioned the flour and sour cream and baked it at 350 not 400 for a little under 50 minutes. I will make this again. My picky daughter loved this cake.Yummy!

I live in Denver and made this as is and it turned out great. The crumb was good and it was a hit with friends for afternoon coffee. I put a drizzle of glaze on top and exchanged the white sugar for brown sugar in the middle swirl. I also substituted fat free greek yogurt for the sour cream and it worked fine. Delicious!!

This cake had a creamy texture and pleasing crust when I followed the top user tips on the orginial recipe. Overall, though, a bit bland. Needs salt and some type of coating to really be a top-tier coffee cake in my book.

tastes amazing! too bad I didn't grease the pan enough and it stuck! next time I make it ill use MORE butter than a thin layer I normally use. I unmolded it hot too, so that might have added to my problems. 

Note: tastes exactly like Starbuck's cinnamon swirl coffee cake.

Yummy, simple, lovely coffee cake.  It was perfect texture-plenty moist. It baked up beautifully at 350 degrees for an hour.  I was lazy and omitted the nuts but these would be nice added to the middle, too.  I did use brown sugar for the middle.  I brought it to a family breakfast and many compliments!  Thank you for the recipe.

Not my favorite.  Thought I used the correct size pan, there wasn't quite enough batter so my cake wasn't as high as I'd have liked. Maybe my baking powder wasn't fresh enough. I used a mix of light brown & white sugars mixed with the cinnamon for the swirl & that was fine.  I'll try this once more with fresh baking powder to see if I like it better.

I rarely follow recipes exactly as put. I had leftover mascarpone from making tiramisu so I added a cup of that instead of sour cream, threw in a pinch of salt, added about 1/2 cup of milk to thin out the batter, didn't put in walnuts, and before throwing in the second half of the batter into the cake I added some cocoa powder. It tastes excellent, and I was worried the mascarpone would make it too dense, but it turned out fairly light.

Excellent recipe, worked even at altitude with no adjustments.  Used bundt pan & batter filled about 3/4 full, which was perfect when baked & made it easy to remove from pan.  Omitted frosting - is plenty sweet without.  Will make again for sure!

Wonderful recipe. I substituted one cup of fat-free vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, and added a generous sprinkling of chocolate chips to the cinnamon sugar streusel in the middle. Also topped with a glaze of powdered sugar/milk/vanilla - it was spectacular - perfect for an office birthday celebration!

I only tweaked this a bit by adding more cinnamon and brown sugar to the swirled part as we luv cinnamon here I also coat bottom of bundt pan with sugar cinnamon mixture. Any light vanilla based drizzle works well.. Ive made this several times,as My family loves it so much.Sometimes I add raisins. Thanks SO much for this great recipe. The sour cream really makes this awesum

This is a very easy recipe that gives a moist cake with a crusty exterior (I dusted my bundt pan with cinnamon sugar before baking). I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with with the flavor of the cake, it was more bland than I prefer. While the cinnamon swirl helped with the flavor, I think I will experiment with the batter next time, perhaps adding cinnamon or additional vanilla, and most certainly double the swirl as many reviewers have suggested.  This is a great recipe, easy with most ingredients found in your refridgerator and pantry, and can be easily modified to suit individual tastes. Thanks for sharing!

Was really good. Only thing we had issue was.. is the cake tasted little on bland side. With icing or added sugar will be awesome my kids said lol but the crust of the cake was delicious. Need find how to get rest to taste like crust and will be 5stars all the way.

This is a very good cake!!! I cannot stop stealing pieces. The only thing different I did was cover the pan with some butter then a little but of cinnamon and sugar to coat it.  It made the outside have a lovely crunchy sweet crust.  I also used a cup of vanilla Greek yogurt because I had no sour cream on hand... Worked perfectly!!

Excellent texture and flavor.  We omit the nuts.  Still struggling with the cooling process thought.  I coat the pan thoroughly, but have problems with it sticking and not sure how long it should cool before removing from pan.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thank you so much for the perfect breakfast (paired with fruit) or dessert!

This was good!  My batter consistency was weird and doughy, and I thought I might end up with a failed cake, but it worked out in the oven!  Because of the odd consistency, I blended in the cinnamon (upped to 2 T) and omitted the extra sugar, instead of going for a swirl.  I also used 1 cup pecans, yogurt instead of sour cream, part whole wheat flour, and reduced the entire sugar content to 3/4 cup.  Delicious flavor and plenty sweet!

This is a good coffee cake but it really needs some glaze.  It does take a little longer to cook and you really need to grease your Bundt pan well as it does stick.

Loved this recipe, but made few changes... I added more vanilla, and substituted one tablespoon vinegar + one cup of milk instead of the sour cream. And in place of the walnuts i added cinnamon chips. Also I layered the batter with a different swirl filling made of melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. It has been the best cinnamon swirl coffee cake I have ever tasted :) So happy it is so easy to make and not to mention yummy!

The cake tastes wonderful. I did what the recipe says..baked 20 mins at 400 and then lowered temp to 350 for 40 minutes. That was a mistake, it caused the cake to harden and get too well done on the outside. the inside was delicious though. Next time I will bake at 350 the entire time.

This cake is yummy!  Soft, moist, and flavorful.  I made this recipe exactly as listed, only I didn't add walnuts (due to allergy).  The nuts aren't needed - plain this is a perfect coffee cake.  It could easily be dressed up with frosting, etc., for fancier occasions.  This recipe is a keeper!

This cake tasted wonderful and pretty easy to boot. The directions are pretty strange but if you do it the normal way (as in butter+sugar, then eggs, the vanilla, then dry ingredients alternated with sour cream) the result is fantastic. I ended up using less flour (about 1/2 a cup less) and a bit less sugar, and since I had no sour cream I used a couple packages of my fat free/sugar free yogurt that I had in the fridge and the final product was still deliciously moist. Instead of incorporating the cinnamon sugar into the batter (why would I want to do that?) I put half the cake batter into the bundt pan, sprinkled over the cinnamon sugar and dolloped the rest of the batter on top. Voila un cinnamon swirl. This cake was super tasty, pleasantly but not coyingly sweet and moist almost like a cinnamon bun at the very centre. In short, a cake that is very easy to get addicted to! Thanks so much for the recipe :)

This was a delicious dense coffee cake.  I made a healthier version subbing 4 egg whites for eggs, 1 cup of Splenda and 1/2 C of sugar for the full amount of sugar, and 1 cup of low fat yogurt for the sour cream.  I also used brown sugar in the middle per advice of others.  I added a cream cheese glaze and felt one should be included with this recipe as it needs either a glaze or a crumbly butter/sugar top to be complete.

This is a great cake.  I know some people like to review on fat and cholesterol and with all the butter and sour cream this has plenty of both but it is so worth it.  After all ratings are all about the taste.  Since I do not need the calorie police I just want to say you need to try this cake.  It is worth the indulgence.

I did not care for this recipe. It was SUPER dry and very sweet, and too "light" tasting - no depth of flavor.  Not sure if I just beat it too much, but the batter was so thick...I knew it wasn't gonna taste good even before I put it in the oven.

Liked very much & got raves; however, I always substitute brown sugar instead of white & use cane syrup when I can. Also found the recipe needed a little more baking powder; and as pecans are plentiful here in Texas, used them. They gave a better flavor to the cinnamon + nutmeg that I used. Definitely will do again.

I made this cake with Jules gluten free all purpose flour (substituting cup for cup) and with dairy free sour cream.  I followed the directions of others, creaming the butter and sugar, then one egg at a time, followed by alternating flour with sour cream.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes.  It tastes amazing!  You can't even tell it's gluten free!

Wonderful recipe. Mixed the cinnamon sugar mix in with the batter (Instead of a separate layer), and it turned out very good. Got many compliments on this.

Add sour cream to butter and sugar mixture. Double the swirl ingredients using brown sugar instead of white.  Put nuts in swirl instead of cake batter.

I made this for the first time yesterday.  As many of the reviewers suggested, I doubled the sugar ribbon but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  EXCELLENT results...it was more than 1/2 gone before it cooled.

This cake was easy to make and delicious-though instructions as written are not quite right.  Followed other users tips and mixed butter and sugar first, then eggs and vanilla, then sour cream, flour mix, and nuts.  I doubled the swirl filling and baked it in small individual bundt pans for 26 minutes at 350degrees.  Drizzled w/powdered sugar frosting.  Yum.

I accidentally used only 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour but it turned out excellent – very moist and fluffy. I made it a second time and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the sugar/cinnamon mix and as others suggested I made extra sugar/cinnamon, almost double. I baked mine in a 9" springform pan, 350º for 45 mins. I also made a drizzle on top as someone suggested: 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp milk.

EXCELLENT recipe. I used bread flour and took the advice of others to whip sugar and butter first then add vanilla then go from there. I also split the batter into 3 levels and HIGHLY recommend using all the filling. It may look like a lot but as it cooks and the dough expands you need that much to cover. Trust me.  Also, spray the bunt pan with buttter flavor cooking spray then sprinkly with sugar (white) for a sweet crust all around..uummmm just had it for breakfast today!

This was a nice cake especially for those who don't like their coffee cake very sweet.  It looked nice coming out of the pan and sliced on the plate.  I will make it again, but next time I will drizzle some powdered sugar glaze over the top to give it a little more sweetness.

After 1 hour in the oven & the cake nearly burning on the bottom, it was like a volcano of uncooked batter.  Very disappointing.  I have made similar cakes & never have seen such a mess...strongly DO NOT recommend.

Dont worry if the batter is thick it still turns out great and make sure you butter the pan well and you wont have any problems with it sticking. Great cake.

This is a very tasty and moist coffee cake. It is also very pretty! Like other reviewers, I added a vanilla glaze, and I also skipped the nuts, because I didn't have any and my sister is allergic. The cake was so pretty to cut into...the ribbon of cinnamon through the middle was beautiful! I really loved the texture of the cake, it has a very moist, tender crumb. The cinnamon flavor is very noticeable, but not overpowering. Thanks for sharing this one...it is a keeper!

I thought this recipe was very good.  Probably the best coffee cake like confection I have ever tasted.  The only problem I had was with the Bundt pan...The layers separated when I turned the pan over.  But, I NEVER have luck with Bundt pans. My cakes always break and stick even when I grease and flour...maybe I just get impatient with the cooling process! I KNEW I should have used a spring-form pan!  It would have been perfect!  I will try this recipe again with the spring-form.  Thanks for the recipe! At least it tasted delicious!

Really yummmy. I used brown sugar instead of white. Nice texture & not too sweet. I also made a coffee glaze using 1/4 cup butter at room temperature, 2 cups powdered sugar & 3 tablespoons freshly brewed coffee. Very good!

I was a little worried when I first mixed the batter because it was REALLY thick, but it turned out awesome. It is wonderful with tea, coffee, or a big glass of milk.

This was so delicious! Made it for a special family get together, today! I melted some chocolate and drizzled over the top and then drizzled the powedered sugar glaze over that, for a nice affect! I also substituted the sour cream with 1 cup of evaporated milk and added to it 1 TBl vinegar. Then, let it set 5 minutes, to "sour" before adding to the recipe.  This recipe is going to be saved to my recipe box, for future use!  :)

Absolutely to die for!!  I followed recipe as written with a couple of small changes.  I put 1/2 tspn butter in about 5 places along bottom of bundt cake pan prior to pouring batter..AND I made alot of sugar cinnamon mix for the filling ( like tripled it).. this has delicious flavor, texture, aroma.. Absolutely delightful coffee cake.  It's a keeper!! and earning instant entry into my family favorites recipe collection book.  YUMM!!

Very good! I did a few things different.  I didn't add the nuts to cake batter.  I added the nuts to the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.  I poured half the batter in the bundt pan & then sprinkled half of the the nuts/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture evenly. Then poured the remaining batter over that.  At the end, I added the other half of the nuts/brown sugar/cinnamon.  It came out very moist & flavorful.

This was a major hit at my son's birthday party, with caramel frosting drizzled on top.

I made it with whole wheat pastry flour and it was still very good with a couple of kids commenting that "it tastes like it came from the store, only better!"  LOL

I thought it could have been a bit moister but I used fat free sour cream so that could have been why.

Regardless, I will be making this again.  Would be great for brunch.

Absolutely scrumptious. I went with another's brilliant suggestion of doubling the "swirl". This one's a keeper.

The cake was a big hit at my house, everyone loved it :). I didnt have sour cream or walnuts, but even without that it was awesome.

Despite the fact that all the 'streudel' fell to the bottom of the pan, this cake is fabulous.  That fact just made the top of the inverted cake a crunchy sweet yum-fest.  I admit this cake has a dense consistency, which is complimented by that crunchiness, and it surprised me how cookie-like the batter became when i mixed the dry and wet ingredients.  It is a very sweet cake, and i used pecans, my favorite nut. My two-yr old saw me sampling it, and said "Me wan piece" and he ate a whole big piece of it :)  I made a homemade caramel sauce to go with it, but after trying the cake, I realized that I really like it better without. :0) Thanks for this 'scratch' addition to my box!

I tried this recipe and it was delicious, but I added my own touch. I did not have sour cream, so I used heavy cream and butter and substituted the butter the recipe called for and used apple sauce instead. I also added ginger and cinnamon to the cake batter and it was DELISH!!! Thanks for this recipe.

This was a good recipe with basic ingredients--all of which I happened to have on hand when looking for a quick coffee cake to make for morning guests.  This was good--especially warm from the oven--but I think I'd add maybe more swirl or sweetness to it next time.

YUM! Very good, despite my changes: I used Smart Balance spread instead of butter, and milk/vinegar instead of sour cream.  Following everyone else's advice, I added brown sugar to the filling mixture. Also, I baked at 350 for about 45 minutes.  Scrumptious!

Too eggy.  My Grandma's "German Bundt Cake" is very similar but calls for two eggs...I'll stick with hers.  Also needs more cinnamon flavor.  Not extraordinary.

Excellent flavor, and sooo simple to make.  I think I messed something up- my batter was super thick and I had to spoon it into the bundt pan- but it still turned out wonderfully.  Make sure to completely soften butter or it will stay lumpy.  Baked for 50 minutes at 350 and it was perfect.  Also, per previous suggestion, coated the ban with butter then the sugar/cinnamon mix, and did two layers of sugar/cinnamon swirl. Very tasty, and great warm.

This was a hit!  I made some changes based on the other reviews: used brown sugar for the swirl, added sliced almonds to it as well and doubled the swirl mixture overall.  I also creamed the butter & sugar first, then added eggs and vanilla.  I mixed flour with dry ingredients before adding that to butter alternately with the sour cream.  I also made two layers of swirl since I doubled the amount.  I baked it at 350.  I then topped it all off when it was cooled with powdered sugar.  It was delicious and moist and I will definitely make it again!

This was a great first bundt cake recipe for me. This is now a staple of mine and everybody at home including my very persnickety father enjoys eating it. I only made changes to suit my personal preferences like swapping the butter for oil, decreasing the sugar to 1 cup, and omitting the walnuts. But really, thanks for posting the recipe.

this recipe makes other coffee cakes pale in comparison. I followed the instructions minus: I used sour milk instead of sour cream (it was what I had) and I grated the nuts to nearly a powder (I dislike nut chunks unless they are in cookies!). awesome. thank you!

The cake was great! Some reviewers didn't like that the cake caramelized with the sugar, but I thought that was the best part! Next time I'm thinking sugar and cinnamon on the top, bottom, and 2 layers in the middle. Great recipe!!!

I loved this recipe. It is good, even without nuts, My hubby doesn't like them. I do. I even taken to making one with and one without, so he can take half of each to work with him. He is in the military and the boys tear it up.

I'm not sure what happened but the dough was very thick and sticky. Similar to biscuit dough.  The two layers didn't cook together but rather in two rings.  It was strange.  BUT it was good, not very pretty though. Probably won't make this again. Sorry.

I followed others suggestions and used extra white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon mix in the middle.  I was leary of beginning with a 400 degree oven, but these baked perfectly.   I also used bread tins and made 2 smaller cakes.  One with nuts and one without.  I made a pink glaze (butter, milk, vanilla,and confectioner's sugar, food coloring) for the plain cake  and used white glaze for the one with nuts.

I made this recipe exactly according to the directions, except I added an extra layer of cinnamon sugar. The sugar mixture was the best part of the cake. I thought it was a bit dense and not as moist as I hoped it would be. I may try it again with less mixing than the recipe calls for.

I made this for the Thanksgiving dessert spread this year and served it with my homemade cranberry sauce spooned atop. It was quite good. However, alone it is a bit lacking. This cake is perhaps, as a few have previously suggested, in need of an icing or frosting of sorts. I will most likely prepare this cake again, on account of my penchant for all things Bundt.

This coffee cake was pretty good. I found it a little dry but still tasty. I too used fat free sour cream. Will probably make this again, but perhaps serve it with ice cream or a caramel sauce.

This is a delicious coffee cake that was enjoyed by all that attended the shower I baked it for. I did make a small alteration, instead of mixing the walnuts throughout the cake I layered them with the filling mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon. I must admit that I had problems getting my cake out of the bundt pan. I followed the directions and lightly greased the pan...I even made the recipe twice using two different greasing techniques & products...still had trouble. I might lightly flour the pan next time. Otherwise an absolutely wonderful tasting cake and very moist.

A very good coffee cake.  It goes together quickly & makes a nice morning treat!
