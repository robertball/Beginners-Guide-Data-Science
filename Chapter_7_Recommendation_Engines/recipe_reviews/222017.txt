After baking for 18 minutes, it was not ready at all (the ice cubes were not even melted).  It took 30 minutes to bake.  Also, I replaced the instant rice with pre-cooked brown rice, which I steamed earlier in the day and left in the fridge to cool before baking in this recipe.  It was a healthy good meal, but maybe would have tasted better as a stir fry.

A good recipe, however, I made one foil packet first before I made the rest so that I could see how it turned out and I'm glad I did. I noticed that it didn't really cook through and that the flavoring was not very noticeable. I ended up cooking the rice ( I didn't use instant) a few minutes before spreading in the packet and after cooking the packets for the designated time I turned the oven off and let the packets remain in the cooling over for 10-20 minutes more. The flavours really blended better and everything was soft and came together really nice. My family loved it!

LOVED! I did make a few minor changes, used a popular cajun seasoning because I didn't have seafood seasoning. I use the Puerto Rican rice recipe on here and added it to the foil packets when the liquid was almost gone. 1/4 cup of water and on the grill for 20 minutes. I'm going to try different flavors like lemon pepper with lemon slices.

I am rating this with the changes I made. I used quinoa that was about 85% pre-cooked (my kids don't like rice) and only added 2 ice cubes per pocket and no water. I cooked this on the grill for about 13 minutes. 

I think this was just a little too long for the shrimp, but was perfect for the broccoli. Next time I'd cut my broccoli smaller and cook for about 10 or 11 minutes and maybe cut the ice to just one cube.

Overall it was easy, quick, and I'd make it again with the above changes.

This was a good recipe, and very easy. It would be perfect for a night when you have a lot going on, and best of all, no pots and pans to clean! I went only three stars because it isn't spectacular or out of this world, but it is good and a handy recipe to have in your back pocket, and I think there is potential to make it really yummy with some tweaking of the flavors used. I used old bay seasoning, and instant brown rice. The cooking time was more like 25 minutes, but that may have been due to the fact that I used brown rice...

Delicious!  I used brown instant rice, and only 2 ice cubes.  Next time I will try 1 ice cube.  Can't wait to try other variations!

We really enjoy these.  We made them the other night with scallops and they were yummy as well.

I agree this is a great week night dish.  Pretty easy to make... the folding of the foil took some practice.  I probably will add more ice cubes as some of my rice was still a little crunchy.

Easy and very tasty.  I doubled the recipe, making four packets, but otherwise followed it exactly.  When done, I dumped them all in a round casserole dish to stir.  Great with a little soy sauce!

I think with some modifications this recipe will be really good but it needs more water, the rice was not completely cooked. It also needs more spices but this is definitely a good starting point.
