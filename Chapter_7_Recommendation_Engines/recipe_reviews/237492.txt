I made this last night, and I liked it. My wife said that the green beans were not cooked enough,  so next time I'll put them in first for a longer cooking time and then add the kale afterwards. My wife doesn't like heat, so I eliminated the Sriracha. Instead of the cream cheese and sour cream, I used Greek style plain yogurt.
