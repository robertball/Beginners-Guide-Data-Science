My partner and I tried this last night, using shrimp.  We truly enjoyed it!  One thing I think I would modify in the recipe is to call for baby bella mushrooms - the little portabellas - sliced.  Otherwise, this is a terrific recipe!

I really liked how this one turned out.  I did change a few things though.  I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any on hand.  I also used imitation crab meat...thought it was safer with a new recipe.  I also added just a little bit of gouda cheese, to thicken and give a little bit more flavor.  I served over pasta and it was great.  Thanks for the post...delicious.

This is so good and so easy!  I used shrimp and scallops for mine. I also made 2 batches , one exactly as written and the other with fat free cream and fat free I cant believe its butter ( the liquid one , I just took the cap off and poured it in ) and light parmesan cheese ... I had my family try both , and they couldnt tell the difference  :)  Its so good either way!

I've made this sauce many times and each time it turns out great. To the other folks that said it had no taste and they had to throw it out, maybe you should try seasoning the food. As Emeril would say "I don't know where you buy your food, but mine doesn't come seasoned." Sometimes you have to adjust a recipe for your own taste buds.

Oh my goodness!  How can you be so delicious, lobster mornay?  This recipe definitely deserves more praise... of course it is in need of some minor adjustment.  Adding salt to taste was a wonderful suggestion.  Minced garlic to your liking.  And for preserving the whiteness of the end result, you'll want to use good quality butter for the beurre manie.  Because the flavor of the lobster is in the butter to which you are adding the broth, cream, and pepper, you don't want to pour that out!  You'll want to keep the butter... just make sure to clean your mushrooms and to not overcook them, which causes the butter to become discolored.

This recipe was really good.  The only problem I had with it was the appearance of the sauce after it was cooked.  It turned out a brownish black color and didn't look very appetizing, but it tasted great.  I cut the recipe in half and it made plenty for 2 people.  I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and it was still rich and thick.

I made this for my daughter's birthday on 4/1/07.  It was great!  I added shrimp, scallops and broccoli.  My family loved it.  It will probably be her traditional birthday meal from now on....Thanks...Mary

I used imitation crab and shrimp and sauteed garlic with the mushrooms and instead of the flour I thickened with corn startch.  My husband is not a big pasta fan but went back for seconds and we both loved the dish and none was left.  Thanks for sharing!

VERY yummy!!! I put mine over cheese Ravioli. I also added onion, green bell pepper and garlic. I used imitation lobster b/c thats the only thing I could find but it was so good. I also had a little lemon wedge and squeezed it over the chunks of lobster.

Delicious as written! This is so quick, easy and great tasting!  The only changes, I use cayenne pepper to taste and sometimes add a tablespoon or so of chopped chives.  If you want a little color, add 1/2 red bell pepper, finely diced and sautéed a couple of minutes in a little butter. I love making it with bow tie pasta.  thank you for the recipe!

Just finished eating this dish and wanted to write about how awful it was....... awful good:) !!! This was and is an absolute must try dish, Trust me I don't say this about many seafood dishes as most people kill the dish by over cooking the fish. The sauce must be cooked as instructed or you won't get the flavor. THUMBS UP Mr swizzleticks

I made this recipe for my husband on Valentines Day and he was very impressed, I served it over Tagliatelle pasta which is a long ribbon like egg noodle, and fresh made rosemary bread.

Delicious! Would be really good with about 1/4 cup of the sauce being white wine, I think. But made exactly as written it's very good.

My husband and I absolutely loved this dish! I added a splash of Maderia wine and some paprika and used fat-free half & half. I also added additional chicken broth to the flour to make a roux.  It came out wonderful.  I served it over pasta and it was divine!

Agreed, this was a delicious dish!  My "tweaks" were as follows:  sub. evaporated milk for the cream...half real butter/half margarine....chopped garlic and red onion sauteed with the lobster and mushrooms....lighten up on chicken broth by a tablespoon or two and sub. some sherry.  a dash of nutmeg didn't hurt, either.  We had some havartii cheese with dill, so I chopped up about 1/4 C of that and tossed it in, too!!  Some chopped fresh parsley would have sealed the deal, but didn't have any.   Served on a bed of boiled ravioli...with a salad.  Very good dinner and the kids loved it, too.

Very good recipe! Never had anything like it... To those that had problem with the flour turning a dark color, this is what could be done instead; When cooking Mushrooms and Lobster in pan, do not use the butter leftover to make the "Roux" (Butter and Flour mixture)cook it in a different pan with brand new butter, amount depending on servings desired. Making sure to stir constantly. Also be sure to add salt to taste.

Really thought it was quite good - did add garlic - salt, pepper, a little red pepper flakes but it is an excellent base for a great sauce.

We really enjoyed this!  I usually prepare pasta with tomatoe base or blush sauces, but was in the mood for something different tonight.  This was wonderful!  I prepared with shrimp and bay scallops, and added a splash of sherry to the seafood/mushroom mix.  Add LOTS of pepper and a dash of salt to the white sauce.  I also added blanched asparagus pieces to the mix.  Thanks, Wendy!

It was VERY thick..I think 1/8 cup of flour would have been fine.  I even kept on adding heavy cream to thin it out & was still told it was good but to thick.  Otherwise it was tasty.

Mixed reviews in my house, I thought it was thick, gummy and unappealing, but I'll give it a point because my preschooler liked it!  I used prawns because that is what I had, and I'm definitely glad I didn't spend the extra money and put lobster in.

A keeper.  The only suggestion I have is to get fresh lobster to cook with I used precook packaged lobster and felt that it took flavor away.  also cut back on the amout maybe 3/4 lb of lobster meat.

I also added fresh garlic, salt, asparagus, and regular portabello mushrooms to this recipe.  My husband loved it so much, he didn't utter a word during dinner!  The sauce still needed a kick, so I added tabasco sauce to every bite.

Thanks for the recipe, I was really just looking for a mornay sauce recipe and this was the only one on the site.  The mornay sauce was absolutely scrumptious!  For a spin on the seafood, instead of the lobster I used precooked chicken and steamed veges as filling for an open pie with a cheese topping. I'm stuffed but in heaven, having eaten about 8 serves in the last 2 days.

I prepared the dish for dinner at my wedding anniversary. It was good but I would like the lobster flavour to be more overwhelming. In conclusion, the sauce by itself was very tasty, that any kind of shellfish or even poultry used would be good.

This is an excellent sauce for seafood pasta.  Just add some salt when you cook it and it is perfect.  I used shrimp, crab meat and scallops in place of the lobster.

Lobster Mornay...how do I love thee...I can't even begin to count the ways. Made this with leftover lobster tails that I minced. The flavor was out of this world. Wasn't too salty for me and my wife. It actually tasted like it was from a restaurant. Used freshly grated parmesan and I think that made a big difference. Only complaint was that the lobster and mushrooms didn't cling to the pasta that well. Minced lobster & diced mushrooms next time. And I'll save some of the parmesan to add after the sauce is added to the pasta. A definite keeper to be added to my seafood recipes. Will try adding shrimp, scallops, and other seafood to this recipe.

OMG - this was amazing! I used shrimp, scallops and imitation crab. I also added minced garlic and a little salt.

After a wonderful weekend in Maine, I came home with two pounds of fresh cooked lobster.  This was a fabulous way to use it.  I added minced garlic, as others suggested and added a hearty splash of wine to the roux. Because my lobster was already cooked I added it at the end. I fed 3 hungry friends and they all raved.  This is elegant, easy and sumptuous!

Great base! I made this for my boyfriend's birthday. His parent's came and it really made an awesome impression. A few things I changed: I doubled all the sauce ingredients. I was feeding 5 people who like large portions and leftovers. Instead of double lobster, I got a half pound of bay scallops and some lump crab (bout a half cup). I split the butter, using half in the sauté and half in the sauce after the seafood was taken out, omitted the mushrooms (onions and garlic instead)and cooked the scallops in it for 45 seconds before adding the lobster. Once they looked not-quite-done, I pulled them out of the pan and into a bowl with foil over it. Very hard to resist snacking on those tasty chunks. Into the pan went the rest of the butter, half and half (its what I had) and the chicken broth (subbed a little sherry as suggested by another reviewer) I whisked the flour into the broth first, another suggestion, and I don't recommend this method. Cook the flour in the butter or use cornstarch. I added a lot of seasoning: thyme, nutmeg, cayenne, salt and white pepper. After the seafood went back in, I added fresh parsley and some lemon zest along with the cheese. Served with rosemary cheddar bay biscuits, it was a home run!

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, with the only addition being a pinch of salt in the end. I used fresh lobster meat, and it came out delicious. My extremely picky five year old cleaned his plate in record time. He never even finishes pizza! I will definitely make this again, but I think next time I will try shrimp, to see how that comes out (and I love shrimp). I highly recommend this recipe, as it is very quick and easy to make (the longest part was taking the lobsters apart), but the end result is very "gourmet", perfect for guests.

This is a good Mornay Sauce recipe, but for me, though, it overwhelms the wonderful, distinct flavor of the lobster. Perhaps if I lived in Maine and ate fresh lobster weekly I might not feel this way, but as it is, the four or five  times a year when I do buy lobster I think  that I prefer it with just the butter, and lemon.  I will definitely make this again, but using  shrimp instead. It will make an awesome Shrimp Mornay!

This was DELICIOUS!!! I made this with shrimp instead of lobster (cheaper!), and I omitted the mushrooms (boyfriend hates them) and used light cream instead of heavy cream. I followed the cooking directions as written, and this created the most silky, savory, and decadent sauce. My boyfriend was raving about this dish to friends and family. Best part? So incredibly easy to make. I served it over brown rice and sauteed squash. You could serve it over pasta, but I recommend (brown) rice because the sauce is pretty thick, so the rice was great for soaking it up; the pasta might be a bit too heavy with the sauce. 

Make this for your boss who you want to impress, and for your mother in law who you want to hush up. :-) YUM.

I didn't think this was very good at all, it definitely was very bland.  I added garlic but it wasn't enough.  A waste of good lobster, hmmm.  I recommend adding garlic, maybe some spice to kick it up.  If I ever try this again I would add some marinara and make it a pink sauce to give it some extra flavor.  Very disappointed, if you try this recipe definitely add, add, add, your favorite seasonings, I usually do that but wanted to follow the recipe.  By the way I would suggest squeezing some lemon juice in when sauting the lobster to bring out the flavor, I forgot to do that.  On a last note, if you payed a lot for your lobster, I would not try this recipe as is.  Luckily I got my lobster on sale.  Good Luck!!!

Very disappointed with this recipe.  This picture made it look so tempting, but the outcome was lacking taste.  Even my husband who is not a picky eater said it  lacked something.  Sorry, will not make again.

This is ok, but i think i need to sift the flour before adding, had a lot of clumps. Also, I don't really like mushrooms. Would make it again though.

I was so disappointed in this recipe after reading all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly with exception to adding a bit of onion and garlic (sauteed with the mushrooms) and in the end, we all thought this dish was very bland.  I used Parmagiana Reggiana straight from Italy and all the best ingredients I could find - yet the flavour was really lacking.  We won't be making this dish again I'm afraid.

As suggested by a reviewer, I added minced garlic to the sauce.  I served it over linguini pasta with steamed vegetables on the side for an easy meal.  Next time I will try it with shrimp.

I halved this recipe, which made two very generous portions.  I also used baby portobello mushrooms, as another reviewer suggested.  It was extremely simple and extremely rich and amazing.  One of those simple but very impressive dishes.  Serve with good pasta, preferably homemade.  Also - one other addition I made was a nice grinding of fresh nutmeg - gave it that added dimension.

I really dislike giving a bad review but this wasn't for us. I used top quality ingredients, imported cheese and cremini mushrooms. I even threw the shells into the skillet while cooking the mushrooms to give it some extra flavour but it's bland and needs something to kick it up, a little wine, lemon juice and perhaps some red pepper flakes or garlic?

My husband said this was the best seafood sauce I’ve ever made!!! Creamy, buttery, delicious.  The changes I made, only because I used what I had in my fridg & freezer, NOT because I didn’t like your suggestions because I WILL make again:  1) I doubled the recipe because we like lots, not just a drizzle 2) used fresh scallops and shrimp in the sauce instead of the namesake Lobster 3) had Striped Pangasius (Swai) Fillets instead of Salmon, 3) used grated 3 Cheese (Asiago, Romano, Parmesan)  & 4) used Unsalted Chicken Stock rather than broth. Will use this for so many dishes. Thank you Thank you

I’ve made this twice and one was amazing and once was pretty meh. I think it all came down to the quality of the lobster meat really. I sub veggie broth in for the chicken as I’m pescatarian and it’s still good.

Next time I will thin out the cream or add more chicken broth so as not to have such a thick consistency. I added Trade Winds Spice Blend which is a local product to enhance seafood from The Halifax Spice Company in Nova Scotia. Of course I increased the amount of mushrooms and lobster. Delish. Will be serving it at my next dinner party.

Made this with shrimp. Sauce was wonderful but shrimp was bland remade it and sautéed the shrimp with garlic and shallots then added the amount of butter called for. Used shredded Parmesan rather than graded.

I substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream and canned mushrooms for fresh because I didn't have fresh on hand. The texture was wonderful but the flavor needed something else. I'm thinking lemon juice or white wine and a little salt.
Easy recipe, will definitely make it again with modifications!

So far this is my favorite recipe on this site.. I have tried making several variations of it.. . Try using Gouda cheese mixed with mozzarella cheese.....   When you find your perfect blend you can try mixing seafood in such as scallops and lobster meat...  This is also good with chicken meatballs as the meat for the dish.. absolutely love this dish with a passion !!

I was impressed at the amount of lobster flavor In this pasta,  of course I made some modifications. I added equal amounts of Maine Lobster tail meat and Patagonia Scallops to this.  I did sauté several minced garlic cloves in butter  with baby Bella mushrooms.  Added old bay seasoning and followed the rest of the directions.  For the chicken broth I used "better than bouillon roasted chicken base".  I felt that it was flavorful enough the emit the cheese but did add some anyways.  I also increased the sauce and mixed it with Spaghetti pasta.  So yummy I am making it again today.

Deliciously rich and amazing! My husband had 4 helpings. I used 2 4-oz lobster tails and 1/2 lb of shrimp. I added minced garlic before adding the mushrooms and used 1/2 cup of dry white wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.

We left out the flour since we didn't need it to thicken the sauce.  We used chunked lobster meat, sea scallops and shrimp.  It turned out wonderfully to make a seafood pasta!  We'll be making this again and again.

Really delicious, and easy to make. One suggestion is to mix the flour with some cool liquid, before mixing it in to the hot butter/lobster/mushroom liquid, after removing the lightly cooked mushrooms and lobster. This way, you won't get any lumps in the sauce. It was rich, and delectable, and a great way to use a large frozen lobster tail, to make dinner for two.

Made it for JG and Sylvie.  Multiplied the recipe by x 1.5 to have more sauce and be able to add more lobster.  Added fresh garlic.  It was absolutely wonderful.

This sauce was super delish! My husband raved about it! I hate mushrooms, so I didn't us any. I doubled the sauce, added 1 pound of shrimp and 1 pound of chopped imitation crab meat. I think I might have added a shallot too. Also use REAL butter! Served it over thin spaghetti. It was amazing, I don't typically like any type of seafood pasta and I'm already thinking about making this again it was that good!

I added a few changes because I read several comments about the sauce being bland.  I used cornstarch instead of flour and added dill weed to the sauce. A few mins before it was done I added chives. It turned out really good. A new favorite!

I have been raving about this recipe! It was easy and delicious!  I've pinned it, emailed it, printed it out and saved it to the online recipe book, I don't plan on loosing it!  How I altered the recipe:  I had an extra cooked lobster so I de shelled it, then added the cooked lobster meat at the end. I substituted white mushrooms with baby portobello mushrooms. I did reserve extra pasta water to thin out the sauce to my liking.

Superb dish! I followed the recipe but added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic from a jar once the sauce started the thicken and before I added the Parmesan cheese. (I would use less cheese next time as I think it made the sauce too thick for my preference.)  Poured it over linguine, topped it off with some minced chives, paired it with roasted asparagus and a glass of delicious Pinot Noir.  Made it a happy date night. :)

This recipe is going into the rotation. I can see how some said it was bland, so I added a couple of minced cloves of garlic (and I could have added more). I added a little extra cream too, to cut down the thickness of the sauce. It tasted really, really good and looking forward to trying it with shrimp too!

I made this sauce earlier today for dinner and the result was not bad. I like the creamy taste to it although I think I may have added too much kosher salt (it tasted a little bland at first so I had to add a little bit of salt to it). I ended up adding some milk to dilute the salty taste and it turned out pretty good. One concern I had is in regards to the flour. Were we supposed to sift the flour before adding it into the pan? I felt like I could've done without the flour because my sauce seemed a bit thick and had a few small clumps here and there. Overall, this was a fun cooking experience. Pretty easy recipe to try!

Delish....this was a wonderful recipe.  I did add one clove of garlic in the 1st step and 2 tbsp of dry sherry in the last step.  I also added scallops.  Everyone raved over this dish served over linguine with aspargus on the side.

Substituted the heavy cream for Coffee Mate, which I do all the time and love the results. I also added chardonnay, but any white wine to taste, and some freshly grated nutmeg, also to taste. You could rub it in your hair it's so good!  ;).

Excellent and easy!  We served over crab-stuffed flounder and then had leftovers with pasta the next day.  I followed the recipe as written except couldn't get lobster so we used shrimp and crabmeat.  A keeper, for sure!

This was a great recipe.  VERY easy and tasty.  I used langostino and it was delish!  Next time I am going to try using 1/2 & 1/2 (less fat) and add some garlic.  My family gave this recipe rave reviews!

I thought this was very good. I did add a little garlic and I used shrimp, scallops, and lobster. For some reason I had to cook it much longer and the sauce never did really get thick.

I have to be honest, but I followed this recipe exactly, just added a little shrimp along w/ the lobster, and we had to throw it out and order the diner.  Just the creamy sauce didn't agree w/ the lobster and the shrimp.

I made this for Valentine's Day and it was really, really wonderful.  I didn't change a thing.  I had no problems with the sauce turning color and used a little over a pound of fresh lobster meat because we like it so much.  We'll definitely have it again!
