I have to say that the sauce is DELICIOUS!!! But...the execution of this recipe is off. If you cook the shrimp first as directed, they will be quite overcooked. I decided to cook the veggies first for 2-3 minutes, then add in the shrimp, cook another 2-3 minutes, and finally add in the bok choy leaves. I also don't recommend sprinkling cornstarch over the stir-fry; it will not incorporate well and will leave clumps. Instead, create a slurry/sauce by whisking together in a bowl the soy sauce, sweet vermouth, brown sugar, rice vinegar and cornstarch. When the veggies and shrimp are cooked, pour the sauce ingredients into the wok and stir to combine til thickened.  Lastly, this makes 4 VERY small servings. I suggest you double the recipe if you intend on serving 4. I will be making this again for a quick weeknight meal!
