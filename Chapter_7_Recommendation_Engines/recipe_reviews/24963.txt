As the first to reveiw, I'm sorry I can't give this more than 3 stars.  I followed the directions exactly.  The recipe is easy but is lacking in a couple of ways.  I think the addition of vanilla or almond extract to the batter and a sprinkling of cinnamon on top would give it a big boost.  I used a 10" dark nonstick springform pan and the cake was over-cooked at 30 minutes; I'm glad I checked when I did.  Also my peaches were rather small & 4 were plenty.  The cornmeal was an "interesting" touch.
