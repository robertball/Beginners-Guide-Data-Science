No one needs to add any chemicals or pickle crisp in their pickles.   When washing your cucumbers cut the flower end off of it.  There is an enzyme in it that will eventually cause your pickles to go soft.  Everyone raves over mine and I haven't had a jar of pickles go soft for years even after being in the jar for a year.

Oh my gosh - these are the BEST.  I tried a Ball recipe on my first go round and ended up dumping them out.  These are perfect!  The difference is the white vinegar and less of the pickling spice.  I did add 1/8 t. of Ball Pickle Crisp to each pint jar.  They are crunchy, tart, delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

Good Basic Recipe for pickles.  I made this by cutting my cucumbers into spears and cutting the blossom end off.  I could not locate fresh dill heads and did not want the little pieces of green on the pickle, so I used dill seed.  What I liked about this recipe is the right balance of salt and sweet, the sterilization instructions, and the amount of processing time, and the fact that you can adapt this recipe to your tastes by adding garlic or hot peppers.  I did add 1/4 tsp of pickling crisp to each of my quart jars based upon advice from other Canners.  I used two tsps of dill seed per jar and added half of a seeded serrano pepper to two of the 4 jars.  My daughter is intrigued by the process so I am going back to the farmer's market for more cucumbers.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe that takes me down memory lane.

UPDATE
After 8 wks, we opened a jar and they were delicious.  The pickles are crunchy and the taste of the dill, garlic, salt, vinegar, and sugar are perfect.

Excellent recipe! Although I love garlic, I prefer the simpler taste of "Pop's" original recipe without garlic. The first time I made these, I didn't have dill heads or seed, so I substituted 4 sprigs of fresh dill weed per 1 litre jar (2 sprigs at the bottom, 2 sprigs on top), and the result was great. I find have to increase the brine recipe by about a half to make sure I can fully cover the pickles.

Scaled this recipe way down....used 6 large kirbys that I cut into 4 spears each.....used only 2 tblspns of sugar which was sweet enough.....and used 1 heaping tspn of dried dill per quart....I also used 2 plastic tupperware type containers with screw on lids instead of jars...so I eliminated the sterilizing process and made these just refrigerator pickles. My crushed garlic did turn a bit blue...which I know is from the oxidizing from the vinegar.....no problem....just for flavor anyway....but a true 5 stars from this recipe....a very tasty and garlick-y, dill-y pickle in just 4 days. Will make again. Thanks!

There's no way this recipe makes 7 quarts. I just made it and there was only enough pickling liquid to fill 3 quarts. It just wouldve been nice if it were accurate.

Great recipe.  Will use it every year.  I only had dill seed, so I used about two teaspoons per pint jar.  I put two cloves of garlic in each jar. I like the garlic flavor.

Awesome Taste Easy to do but I had to triple the brine recipe to do 10 pounds of cucumbers. Either the allrecipe's calculator is out of whack or the recipe isn't quite accurate

This is a really nice and adaptable pickle recipe.  I had 14 3-4 pickling cukes from a friend and ended up with 4 pints of spears and two pints of chips.  I used my v-slicer to cut the chips.  I didn't bother with the cheesecloth because I like the way it looks to have the spices floating in the jar.  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar because we don't really like sweet pickles, and I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for fun.  I just used kosher salt because that's what I had.  Next time I'm going to pop a few grape leaves in the jars too.  The pickles are delicious, and it was fun to experiment with canning.

This is my first time making dill pickles and i  was very happy with this recipe but next time I will reduce the salt. I trimmed the blossom end as recommended and they stayed very crunchy. I believe the recipe author made a mistake saying the brine will fill 7 quart jars. it makes enough for 7 pint jars. so if you are filling quarts then double the brine.

Made this recipe tonight, much to my surprise after making up the pickling liquid, and loading up my 7 quart sized jars with the cukes, there was only enough liquid to top off 4 jars of the pickles. I think the recipe should have 8 cups of water and 8 cups of vinegar, 1.5 cups sugar and 1 cup pickling salt. I made a second batch of the liquid according to the recipe, and processed all my jars. I'm really looking forward to trying these pickles in a week. If they taste as good as the pickling juice smelled I'll be very happy, and make another batch.

I found this recipe on another site a few weeks ago.  It was my first try at making pickles.  It was super easy.  I just tried my first pickle a couple days ago and they were fantastic.  I liked them so much, I made another 8 jars last night.  The recipe I made also called for mustard and celery seed.  Not sure what the taste difference is; but it does add a nice look to the pickles in the jar.

These pickles were my first. I couldnt wait to try, so after 2 weeks i tried them. They were awesome, good flavor and not an overpowering vinegar taste. the addition of the clove is a nice touch as well. I Will be doubling, even tripling this recipe next year. I to used pickle crisp and trimmed the blossom end. Thank you for sharing.

I followed the recipe perfectly. I filled 6 quart jars, but only had enough brine mixture for four and 1/2 jars.  I packed the cucs tightly.  Very disappointed.   I don't know what happened as I didn't read this problem in any of the previous comments.   If I make them again, I will make a double batch of brine.

Wow--now these are pickles! Far stronger than any store-bought dill pickles, they have a real kick to them and we often finish off a pint jar in one sitting. The remaining juice is strong enough to make a weaker batch of crispier refrigerator pickles: slice fresh cukes and let sit in the fridge for a week.

Undoubtedly the BEST pickle recipe ever!  I got 5 quarts out of my first batch and allowed them to pickle for two weeks.  We all loved them so much the 5 quarts did not last 2 weeks!  Put up 9 more quarts which will be ready in a week.  Also, I used this brine for my pickled green beans.  Can hardly wait to taste them.

I used 10 pounds of small pickling cucumbers, in 10 x 1 litre jars, which needed 9 cups vinegar, 9 cups water, 1 cup pickling salt , 1 Tbsp sugar, a 3T cheese cloth bag of pickling spice, dill and garlic.... and WOW! Also cut a thin slice off both ends of cucumber.

I have made this recipe for three years .  The only thing I do different is add the pickling spices to the jar as I never know how much brine to make as I grow my own cucumbers and some days I have 3 and others 20.

This was my first attempt at pickles, and I was NOT dissapointed! they were so awsome! I threw a couple small pieces of hot pepper in each jar, so they were a tad hot, but in a good way. They would have been great without the peppers too. Most definatly will make again!

Way to much vinegar for me, next batch I used 2 cups vinegar to four cups water and scaled the Sugar back to 1/4 cup--they turned out much better this way.

These pickles were fabulous.  I used the really small pickling cucumbers because we like whole pickles as opposed to spears. I also used hot and spicy pickling spice, the serano peppers and garlic.  These pickles turned out great.  Will definitely keep this recipe.

Excellent pickles. The ice soak keeps them crisp.  

As usual we add a little more dill and use less sugar.

If your pickles turn out too salty, like mine did, then just pour out about 1/3 of the brine from the jar and fill with water. In a day or two, the saltiness will go down! I just discovered this by experimenting, and now my once-too-salty pickles are perfect!

These are great dill pickles.  I used 1 tbsp of crushed red pepper instead of pickling spice with some of the pickles and they were really good!!

I made these three weeks ago and they turned out with a great dill pickle flavor and very crispy.  I am making another batch as I type this review. The only thing I did was increase the amount if liquid. Follow the recipe and you will have flawless dill pickles that everyone raves about!

it was a easy recipe to use. but after letting them sit I really would not view this as a dill pickle recipe. when we tried them they were really strong after sitting only 8 days and were sweet with a hint of dill. if you are looking for a dill pickle recipe I would not use this one.

i made these this summer because my garlic dill recipe was kind of boring...these sounded like they'd have a little more schmuck.  these are THE best garlic dills i've had in awhile.  they really have a different flavor that's pleasing to everyone.  i've shared a few jars w/ co workers and they rave at how great they turned out.  my friend yvonne said they tasted like pickles her mother made, which is THE best compliment ever!

an excellent snack. Full of flavour. The longer these pickles sit sealed the better the flavour. They start out salty in the early days after canning but two weeks later the garlic melds witht vinegar and salt reducing the salty flavour. I reccommend letting them sit for at least two weeks before opening.

These pickles are okay, my wife likes them but I am put off a little by the use of pickling spice and sugar.  They just arent' what I was looking for in a dill pickle.  Nice crunch factor after covering my cucumbers in ice for 4-5 hours, but not the flavor profile I wanted.

This is now my go-to pickle recipe. For 6 large jars, I need to double the vinegar mixture. I skip the ice part, but the whole cucumbers typically sit in the fridge for a few days (out of laziness) before I'm ready to pickle/can - not sure if makes a difference.

Perfect with adjustment.
Firstly, only add all the sugar if you like sweet pickles. I like my pickles less sweet so I only added 2 tbsp of sugar.
Next, this is not enough brine to make 7 quarts. I made another half of the brine to fill the rest of jars.
Last, make sure you don't can the pickles with the pickling spice(I didn't have cheesecloth so I just strained the brine) or it will over power  the pickles.

I used a basket of pickles, added pickles and ice to a cooler and let set for 8 hours.  This causes the pickles to be crisp.  Adjusted recipe for weight of pickles, reduced salt by half.  Used fresh dill, one clove of fresh garlic and i half green jalapeno and half red sweet banana pepper with seeds per jar to spice the mix and add color.  
To the brine, I added pickling spice to be strained out as jars are filled.  Boiled brine, let cool to 170-200 degrees, strained and filled jars after stuffing with pickles. Used a five minute water bath in pre-boiling water to seal.  5 minute is important.

I haven't tried the pickles yet as I want them to have a good chance to soak up the brine. The brine was FANTASTIC so I'm excited that these will be good. I'm concerned about how crispy they will be but the reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is that there's NO WAY this makes 7 quarts of pickles. I only got 5 quarts out of the brine. I had plenty of pickles left over. It was really disappointing.

I made these with just the first two cucumbers that grew in our plant (we were excited). I did slices and obviously had to adjust the ingredients for my two cucumbers. We also made these as refrigerator pickles instead of canning. I might cut back on the salt a bit but this could be from a mistake I made in adjusting proportions. Overall these were crunchy and delicious. I just made them today and they already taste great so I am sure that in a few days they will be even better.

This recipe is a perfect starting out point, and very easy to make it your own with slight changes to ingredients. I like to use dill seed, I reduce the sugar a bit to be equal with the salt, and a little less of the pickling spice. The longer they are allowed to sit and become wonderful, the better! I like them best after about 6 months. They are crunchy and addicting.

This is the first time I was successful at making pickles. I am on my third batch. It's important to use the freshest cucumbers possible, as my first batch was shriveled but tasty. Use a scale. I had plenty of brine. Alot depends on the size of the cukes. I also used a pickling spice recipe from this site, which went very well with this recipe. My most recent batch is large but short cucumbers, so hopefully they won't be hollow or too seedy. Please thank your dad for me. This is a keeper!

Oh, my WORD, these are so good!!  I used fresh dill heads from my garden and a clove of garlic per pint, 2 cloves per quart.  I put up 7 quarts and 12 pints of spears, and I'm still not sure I made enough, lol!

These pickles are fantastic.  I just made them and I did one small jar to try immediately.  They should be even better after they sit for a while.  The only thing is, unless I did something wrong, I don't think this will do seven quart jars.  I used the full recipe.  I didn't weigh the cucumbers, but I wound up with 3 quarts and a pint packed pretty tight.  I barely had enough juice for that.  Maybe that should be pints?  Did anybody get seven quarts?  Anyway they turned out fantastic.

I am absolutely delighted with this recipe. It is going to be printed and added to my permanent collection of recipes. I was not able to find pickling spice so I made my own from another recipe on here. I made them exactly like the recipe, and processed them basically the same. My husband and kids also love them. Def the best garlic Dill pickles ever. (Now try them fried, they are AMAZING) :)

This is the first time I ever made/canned pickles.  I must tell you that these were the absolute best pickles I have ever had.  I just opened the first jar after about a week - I loved them, my wife loved them, my three year old loved them and my one year old loved them!
I will be making these for years to come.

These pickles are so good!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I guess I didn't read it thoroughly and I skipped the ice bath.  The pickles still came out wonderfully!  I enjoy the little bit of sweetness and like the fact that they are not overwhelmingly vinegary. Will make again and again. My family requests them now.  This year I am trying to zest some of the jars up by adding some hot peppers!

Followed this recipe exactly except I didn't use the cheesecloth because I like the look of the spices in the jar. These pickles are great!  I've made pickles before and threw them away because they were soft. These turned out crisp with just the right amount of dill and spicy flavors.  Perfect pickles!

Just made a large batch of these...very simple, I  needed to make more brine. Was surprised at the amount of sugar but I don't like an overly sour pickle. Looking forward to my first chomp!

Husband liked it, I thought it turned out a little too sweet.  The pickle texture was inconsistent  - some were crunchy, some were soft, although it was my first year making them.  I might try a new recipe next year.

Turned out very nicely. My family is enjoying but I found the pickling spice was a little too much. I will make again but cut back on the pickling spice.

I've made these for the last 8 years.  After trying different recipes, this is definitely my favorite. I have increased the recipe to make what should be 35 qts.  However, it actually makes 20 qts. so plan accordingly.  I let them stand for a month or two and then put a quart in the fridge.  They are crispy and delicious. I have had so many compliments on these pickles. They are still delicious after more than a year.

I found this recipe a little bit too sweet and too much "spice" from the pickling spice. I changed the sugar to 1/2 cup and removed the step to boil the brine with the sachet of spice. Instead, in each jar I added 1/8 tsp. of pickling spice right in the jar. I let it sit for a min of 4 days, and it was great!

So...
4C. Water
4C. Vinegar
1/2C. Sugar
1/2C. Pickling Salt
-Bring to boil and simmer for 10 min

In each jar add fresh dill, garlic and pickling spice. Happy Pickling!

I made these pickles yesterday. I had to use rice vinegar instead of regular vinegar which made them mush less tart. I added more water as well because I made 12 pint jars instead of quart jar. Head of dill for every jar. Came out great.

I couldn't wait and tried them at the 6 day mark.  They were already very flavorful!  I made 5 bigger jars and it wasn't enough brine for all, so I needed to quickly make a little more.  I will definitely try making them again!  Next time I will likely cut back a little on both the sugar and pickling salt though.

Pop must have liked his pickles salty. The flavor is nice if you can get past the salt. These will just turn into fried pickles. Because water and vinegar are equal, you can safely reduce the amount of salt. Am going to try again with half the salt and a bit of pickle crisp in the jar

Updated to 4 stars. Cut salt in half and added pickle crisp to jars. Still a tad salty.  Cut salt again, added pickle crisp and used this recipe the rest of the season.  I probably ended up with 20 jars of pickles that can be eaten as is. The others are all going is salad dressing, tartar sauce or being fried cause they are toooooo salty

Great pickles as is.  I wanted to jazz them up a bit so I added some Jalapeno, and I like the way my pickling spices look floating in the jar so I let those suckers loose in the jar and they look really nice.  Next time I'll use peppers that are a different color and add purple onions for color and flavor!  Keeper for sure!!

Well I believe the recipe is wrong in the brine amount, as other reviewers have stated,  and really hope it is changed for the next brave caner.  I have to make a quick repeat of the brine and I only canned less that 4 pounds of cucs. I used fresh dill as well. Looking forward to the taste test in a couple of weeks and the adventure of adding jalapeno
peppers to the next batch. I also added onion to a couple of the pints. Even with double brine I ended up with 5 pints and 1 quart of finished product.

We iced the cucembers for an hour and 45 minutes and some of them froze and were unusable. Also the recipe only made enough brine for 2 jars. We had to triple it.

My mouth is salivating even THINKING about these pickles.  Do not look further.  THIS is the dill pickle recipe you want.  I canned them in pints, and do believe I each grand could eat his/her way through a pint in one sitting.  They are that good.

I followed the recipe. Had just enough liquid for 7 pints. I had one jar not seal, so after 2 weeks in the fridge we tried the pickles. Definitely crunchy but too salty. I'll try this recipe again but will cut salt in half. Also would add some red pepper flakes and more dill. We don't use salt for the most part, so that may be why these tasted too salty.

My first time to make pickles.  I've never been patient-so as the instructions said, if the jay doesn't deal properly (the pop up lid doesn't stay down), refrigerate and eat within two weeks.  Two out of 9 jars didn't properly seal.  After being in the fridge about 2 1/2 hrs (after completing the recipe), we decided--what the heck--we'll go ahead and try them!  If they aren't good, we'll just wait it out the full week.  But they were delicious !!! We even agreed that they are the best pickles we've EVER had!!  Yum!! I'll be making this recipe regularly!

Made a variety, chips, stackers and spears. Made several jars with carrots (cause we like carrots) and a few hot pickles with red jalapeÃ±o peppers. They all taste amazing! Great recipe.

I used this recipe as I like the ingredient list and proportions.  They turned out excellent!  This will be our go-to recipe moving forward.  I also had left over brine, so have been using it with fresh sliced cukes and peppers as refrigerator pickles. (NOTE:  I did double the brine recipe to be sure I had enough based on some of the other reviews).

I made it the first time as listed but didn't like the sweetness from the sugar so omitted it the second time. Also added the pickling spice directly to the jars along with extra bay leaves and 2 whole cloves & chopped garlic. Used "pickle crisp" and grape leaves to keep the crunchy texture. They are being devoured! I used the same brine to make spicy pickled beans for Caesars and added some chili flakes. Such a great way to preserve the abundance growing in my garden!

This is my first time make dill spear pickles.  I cut the recipe in half so it said I needed 4 pounds of cucumbers.  And the brine was 2-1/2 cups of water and vinegar. I stuffed 3 quart  jars with cucumbers and had lots left over and the brine only filled one quart and a half of another. I made another patch and created another quart (making 4 total)... and had the same problem. I also probably have a pound and half of cucumber spears left over. Anyone else have this problem?  I hope they taste good at least.

I followed the receive exactly except I added a dried red pepper. The pickles were awful. Too sweet, and the pickling spice gave it a weird taste. While I like to use pickling spice in sweet pickles and relish the use with dill was definitely not good.  I had to throw away 12 quart jars

Excellent dill pickle recipe! I had to double the brine to cover the pickles. I used sprigs of dill from my garden instead of dill heads. I will be making these again once I have more cucumbers from my garden.

Complete WASTE.  KOSHER NOT DILL.  Apparently people don't know the difference.  Dill is crisp, vinegary and nice.  Kosher is nasty, slimy and gross

The recipe itself is awesome! I doubled the amount of solution you make. I didn't realize how much you have to pack the pickles in the container (may be this is why I needed more solution). I thought I had stuffed the containers, but when I filled them with liquid, the cukes floated up. Next time, I will know to pack these things very tight. I tried the first batch after a week, and they were really good. I did follow one person's suggestion to cut off the ends of the cukes to keep them crispy. It worked.

The recipe only makes enough liquid for 3-4 qts.  I doubled the recipe and filled 7 qts with 6lbs of pickles (3 two pound bags).  I also added two slices of habanero two give it a little kick, but copied the recipe exact otherwise.  It's was good.

Finally! An easy and tasty recipe! These pickles were amazing! After reading reviews I made 50% more brine and had a little leftover. One clove of garlic and 1-2 dill heads was the perfect balance. I added a Thai chili pepper to a few jars for fun and the spice was just perfect. 

I didn't soak my cukes - just took them from the fridge and they were great.

They tasted great after a month on the shelf but I popped a few jars into the fridge without processing and they were DIVINE after a week.

We are about to make our second batch.
The only negative is that I found them very slightly too sweet for my taste. This time we are reducing the sugar just slightly. Also, you may want to 1.5x or 2x the pickling liquid as the recipe doesn't make enough and we had to stop to make more.  We also left the pickling spices in the liquid instead of having them in a cloth. We like the extra flavour it adds, but everyone's tastes are different.

Followed the recipe exactly and got very nice, crisp dills.  They are a little bit too salty for my liking but perhaps I erred in my amounts - I had cut the recipe in half for the amount of cucumbers I got from my garden at the time.  As others did, I also needed more liquid but that was no trouble.  I'm doing another batch today.  I may add just a touch more sugar - they aren't sweet in the least.

Excellent pickle recipe! I made both chips and spears out of this recipe and followed every step perfectly. The pickles turned out tasting like deli pickles after a 7 day waiting period. One unsealed jar that I ate right away was a bit strong with a vinegar flavor, but still very good for my taste. I highly recommend this recipe for any deli pickle lovers.

My husband took one bite of the pickle and simply said "way too salty."  So for the second batch I used 1/3 cup pickling salt instead of 1/2 cup. Much better!  I agree with the previous poster that this brine only fills three quart jars so keep that in mind if you actually have 8 lbs of cucumbers.

Extremely sour. The vinegar to water ratio is way too high. Hopefully they'll work on sandwiches because they're not good on their own. Will not make again.

I have made this recipe 3x now.  I followed the exact recipe, except I used regular cucumbers from my garden, because I had to use them up.  I agree with other reviewers, there's only enough brine to do 7-8 pints, but that worked perfect for me with about four pound of cukes cut into crinkle coins.

I will use this recipe every year. The last batch turned out fantastic! And, it was my very first attempt at canning anything. Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe to a tee, but ended up having to double the amount of brine, despite having packed the cukes into the jars tightly. After about two weeks, I decided to try them. The smell when I first opened the jar was good, but the taste of the pickles was terrible.

Pickle were crisp and tasty but felt they were a little too salty for my taste.  Per other reviews cut back on sugar and that may account for the extra saltiness.  Maybe sugar is needed to balance that.  Next time I will cut back on the pickling salt.  I also added pickle crisp!

My teenage daughter and niece loved them! However the boys and I did not.  Even after doing the ice bath and cutting the flowering ends my pickles weren't that crispy. Maybe I'm just used to the store bought ones that give a big crunch.

Great recipe. no real need to put the pickling spice in cheesecloth. boil it with your mixture and add to the jars as you fill with brine. I cracked a jar open after one day and they are already excellent. I am on my 2nd run today.

Made 2 batches of these so far--the first one is almost gone!  Used only 1/4 cup sugar this time.  These are excellent! Until now, I have never had homemade pickles that I liked.  I added 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, just because I like the color. I saw someone else suggested that, and I think it works well. It's also supposed to be anti-inflammatory, so how wrong can you go?

Best pickles I've ever made. I like them a little spicy so I added about 3/4 cup jalapeÃ±o juice from a can.  Crisp, tart with just the perfect heat. Oh, and I just used regular store-bought cucumbers and just cut them into strips, worked great!  Thanks!

Good recipe but I think the sugar needs to be cut in half.  We liked them and ate them all so I this recipe is not bad jut too much sugar for our taste.

I don't really care for dill pickles but these are fantastic. I can't keep them around because people take them from me. I also use pickle crisp. This recipe is the best!

Good, but thought my pickles were slightly soft.  Tried Ball pickle crisp- utter fail! Ruined the ones I made with it, I'm going back to following the "pure" recipe.

Great recipe, but the amount of water/vinegar is way off.  As prepared with proper sized cukes I used 5 cups of water and 5 cups vinegar and could only fill 5 jars.  These were persian slim cukes too.

First time ever making pickles. I too cut off the blossom end. So crunchy and taste great. I added a couple extra cloves and ground ginger to my recipe and strained the liquid into the jars.

although the flavor is excellent I do not find them crisp at all.  Is there another non chemical way to make them like store boughten crisp?

I made 1 1/2 recipes of syrup, and still didn't quite have enough. Maybe I prefer more juice in my jars than most? That was my only change.
