This is a bit on the pricey side to make however it is really good. The dressing is nice and tart. I used blue cheese as called for my husband and I used cheddar for me because I do not like blue cheese. Any cheese of your choice would work good in here. The only deli turkey meat I could find was very thin so next time I will use chicken so that I will have a thicker chunk of meat. All in all good recipe and one I will make again.

I would not make this again because the salad dressing was nothing special.  We ended up using a bottled dressing when we finished off the salad.
