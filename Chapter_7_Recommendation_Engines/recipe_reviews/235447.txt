For low carb this is delish. I had about 1/2 cup leftover turkey broth and combined that with enough water to cover and cook the cauliflower. I increased the garlic to 4 cloves as we love garlic and added 2 bayleaves to the cooking liquid. I don't miss potatoes too much with this excellent substitute.
Give it a try you won't be disappointed.

Creamy and delicious, just how you want it to be. I used the Grand Gourmet Pro blender and  not a single lump....if u like it really smooth. Make sure not to use more butter or sour cream than it calls for might make it too thin. I also substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream to save calories. Could use another clove of garlic to be honest.

This tasted good, just made, and was quick to make. It does taste slightly different than mashed potatoes. It also keeps some of the texture despite blending it in a Vitamix blender. I have had mashed potatoes where the potato was boiled with the garlic that went really well. I am not sure the cauliflower was heavy enough to not leave a lingering garlic flavor. Also, I have tried another similar recipe without the added dairy that tasted equally good but lighter. A bit of it got eaten with dinner, but the leftovers were never touched afterwards. It started to get slightly watery and the garlic taste was just a bit to strong by that point. It worked for dinner that evening though.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I did not have high hopes for this being tasty, and was looking for a way to sneak veggies into my family's meals.  My husband wouldn't try it, and my 18 month old didn't like it, but I sure did.  I intend to make this for myself and have it around for lunches.  It's very smooth and has great flavor.  I used low fat sour cream and a bit less butter than called for.  DELICIOUS!

This was good and very easy to make, but definitely needs more garlic. For lactose free, I sub'd with vegan butter, coconut milk (try plain dairy free yogurt in place of sour cream next time or vegan cream cheese to get the texture right), and Cabot lactose free sharp cheddar. Since I felt more garlic flavor was needed, I added a different seasoning blend which had garlic, salt, and pepper in it. I'm definitely hooked on cauliflower mash now instead of the usual mashed potatoes. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious and easy to make!  I was even able to trick the kids into eating it.  Once they said they liked it, I told them what it really was.  They were in shock!  A great way to feel like you're having mashed potatoes, minus the carbs!

Made as written it is good.  It was made exactly as published.  Next time I cooked the cauliflower in chicken broth no water, added 6 strips of crumbled bacon (no need for additional salt), 1/2 small container of chive & onion cream cheese and doubled the sour cream.  Doesn't get any better than this!

Love this recipe! Like others have said it needed the extra garlic, I used 4cloves. Also I agreed that it needed extra salt and pepper. I have always loved cauliflower anyway,so I actually think I like the taste of this dish better than mashed potatoes! Also less filling,lighter than mashed potatoes.

Mashed potatoes...you're history! This recipe gives you all the flavor and goodness without the carbs.  I followed the recipe except for taking the advice of other reviewers and added extra garlic and salt

I omitted the garlic and added more sour cream. My husband loved it and next time I'll use two heads up of cauliflower.
