This was so easy and delicious!  My boyfriend raved about it all night.  Although I did do a few things differently (I used half and half rather than heavy cream, used a bag of frozen corn rather than ears, used boneless skinless chicken breasts, added 3 tablespoons of butter to the sweet potato mix, and I put about a teaspoon of salt into the marinade,) I think next time I make it I will add more chili powder, more hot sauce, and maybe some cayenne powder into the marinade.  I also think I would put a dash of chili powder on top of the corn along with the salt and pepper, and might try experimenting with a dash or so of cinnamon in the sweet potato mix.  With these changes, this recipe is certainly deserving of 5 stars!

After I've written all of that I'm craving this meal again.

This was a pretty tasty meal but it needed a minor tweak to the sweet potatoes and there needs to be a measurement for the oil used in the marinade. I used 1 tablespoon  because it didn't specify. Instead of grilling I did roast my chicken in the oven and it was great. After tasting the sweet potatoes I added 2 TB of butter, and that made them perfect. My husband has already requested for me to make it again. Next time I think I will make it with boneless, skinless chicken breast though.
