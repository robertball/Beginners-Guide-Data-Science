I have found when using herbs and seasoning in the instant pot it is better to add them at the end after the pressure has been released. Just a personal preference, but you can get the same effect by removing the onion and tomatoes, and substituting salsa. I wanted to give this recipe a bit more body and added in cheddar cheese. Very good and quick to make.

This should really be called Taco Hamburger Mac! Yum! I made this almost exactly as written and it was delicious! Proportion of ingredients is spot on. I have frequently made Taco Seasoning I (see Cook’s Note on this recipe), but tonight I used a taco seasoning blend that I sell, which worked very well using the measurements in the recipe. I was happy to catch the author’s review indicating a typo of the recipe in which only 2 cups diced tomatoes should be used and not 2 cans. My 1 can yielded very close to 2 cups with juices and was the perfect amount in this recipe. I was out of elbow noodles and subbed with 2 cups Gluten Free (GF) Rotini pasta. All pasta varies in cooking time so be careful if you end up subbing as I did due to dietary restrictions and being out of GF elbow/macaroni. My rule of thumb with IP pasta for cook time is to take the lowest cook time listed on the package (subtract 1 minute if necessary to get to an even number, then divide in half, and subtract 2 minutes. So for Barilla GF Rotini, 8 min/2 = 4 and minus 2 minutes = 2. I set the timer for 2 minutes and had perfectly cooked pasta). Unfortunately, I cannot attest to the cook time of regular elbow/macaroni pasta, but I suspect 3 minutes would be accurate for al dente. As the author suggested in the description, I added 1 cup of grated cheddar at the end. I also topped off our bowls with a little extra grated cheddar. My husband topped his bowl with a dollop of sour cream and loved this dish.

Fair. IMO too much noodles and I'd definitely add some cheese and some bell pepper if I make it again.

Great and easy dinner.  This was a hit at my house.  I thought for sure I would have leftovers the day after but nope, all gone in one day!

I added  a red bell pepper to the diced onion and pre sauteed them on low in the IP before adding the hamburger. Last but not least I added 1 extra cup of beef stock to ensure the pasta had enough liquid to cook properly, went 4 mins with a 5 min NPR. I also added 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese to mine and stirred it through before serving. My husband and I really loved it!

Very easy & yummy. The only change I had was I used Rotel tomatoes with chilies instead of just the plain tomatoes. Oh!  And I didn’t have macaroni so I substituted shells.

Family loved it! All pantry staples and 3 minute cook time with 5 minute natural release was perfect! Maybe add some green pepper next time, but it was yummo!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious.  The only thing is that I used Barilla pasta and the 3 minute cook time was not quite enough.  I will definitely make this again, but will up the cook time to 4 minutes.
