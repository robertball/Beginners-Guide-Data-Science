This was excellent, this spinach all deliciously  dressed up!  Perfect for company, but perfect for just Hubs and me too. I made it easy on myself and just microwaved the spinach to wilt it, adding it little by little to my microwave dish every 30 seconds or so as it wilted down.  I loved the bechamel sauce with the touch of nutmeg (I used fresh), but I didn't bother to use hot milk - cold worked just fine - and I found I had to use a little more of it, even tho' I didn't cook it for 10 minutes - it wasn't necessary when you scale this down to one serving which was an 8 oz. bag of baby spinach.  Also, I knew immediately that 10 minutes under the broiler would be far too long  - just a couple/few minutes turned out to all it needed .  This is a little elegant, a little gourmet, and very, very good, not to mention blessedly neither too rich nor too heavy.

I liked it alright, but my husband didn't like the consistency of the spinach at all...

Very good dish - especially if you already like spinach!  I personally  loved this.  I made it for a Christmas meal, everybody said it was good, but don't think it was a huge favorite either, except for fellow spinach lovers.  I made as the recipe stated, except didn't warm the milk.  My bechamel sauce turned out great, but next time I will mix this in with the spinach, rather than just put on top.  I think that would help even out the flavoring.  It is a beautiful dish, I will make again.

This recipe made WAY too much sauce for the spinach for me.

This is definitely worth trying.  We have been looking for a different spinach casserole recipe for some time - love gruyere cheese -so despite the slim reviews decided to try it.  My husband and I agree that this one is a keeper.  Even better the 2nd day.

I will try this again because the basic idea is a good one but it needs a lot of work to make it a really special dish. I think a combo of cheese under the broiler for a short time would help.

Loved this recipe!  I used double the Gruyere on top, and didn't have nutmeg so left it out.  It was delicious!  Definitely will make again. Thinking of adding in a little Parmesan cheese to the sauce next time. My family loved it!
