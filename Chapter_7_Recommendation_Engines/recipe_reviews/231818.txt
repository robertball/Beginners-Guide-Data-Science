Half of the recipe was made with Parmesan cheese, the other half without. Used soy milk instead of cream. Both halves were delicious!

Just tried this tonight.  Oh my was this good!  We made a few changes to lighten it up as follows:

1 tablespoon of butter instead of 2.
1 clove garlic
1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth (which we used to cook the turnips after the 7-10 minute cooking time and omitted adding the Parmesan and heavy cream at this time.  I added the herbs, salt and pepper.
1/2 cup lite sour cream and 1/4 cup of low fat yogurt substitued for the heavy cream.  I added this mixture to the turnips after the 10-15 minutes cooking time and broth had been reduced.  I also added Parmesan at this time too and shut off the heat. 

We made 5 servings out of it.

This is my first time eating a turnip in my whole life and I absolutely love this recipe! I'm trying to expand my vegetable horizon and I've always been curious about turnips. Try this! I soaked the cubed turnips in milk first, as I read somewhere that it makes the turnips less bitter. There was absolutely no bitterness! I didn't have parsley so I added some dried cilantro flakes (like another reviewer) and some dried chives. DELICIOUS! I will eat this all the time!

This was delicious, but I found the garlic cooked much faster than the recipe suggested and the turnips much slower. I cubed my turnips quite small, but would make them even smaller next time so they have more chance of being cooked through, and I won't add the parmesan until I'm just about finished as it made the pot difficult to clean!

Nice change from usually having pureed (mashed) turnips.  Used 1/2 cup whole milk (had no cream on hand) and only put about 2 tbsp of grated parmesan, therefore, not as creamy as it should be, but still had a great taste!  Plus, really easy to make.

This was so incredibly delicious!  I didn't even know I liked turnips.  I did use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream, which was still very rich, and the sad part is that I only got to eat a little bit, left the rest on the stove to cool down, forgot about putting it in the fridge, went to work, came home, and the cats had consumed the whole thing!  So mad I went out and bought more turnips and made it again!  ALL MINE THIS TIME!!!!  Yum!  Thanks!

VERRY GOOD alternative to potatoes.  Peel the turnips before cutting.

Quite delicious.  I used nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan, simply because I had no parm in the house.  I also added a kohlrabi to the party, just because I could.

Very Good. My husband even commented on how good they were that way. A nice change from the usual buttered turnips with salt and pepper.

I found that the turnips needed a little more cooking to soften them enough.  By mistake, I put no salt in the recipe and that was a huge mistake.  Good recipe for some root, winter veggies.

Who knew I would like turnips? This was very good. I used sour cream instead of whipping cream because that is what I had on hand. This was very good and my husband even liked it. Next time I get turnips in my organic box I will know what to do with them.

This is a new way for me to make turnips. I used coconut milk in stead of cream, added curry instead of oregano because I love in any dish that is creamy. Thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch mixed in a little milk. I  really enjoyed this dish.

This came out so delish!  Substituted homemade chicken broth for the cream.  Otherwise followed the recipe.

I've never known what to do with turnips - and found this to be a great side dish.  I will definitely make it again!  I found the need to cook the turnips (cut in 1/2" cubes) for a good 20 minutes for the right texture.   I added a bit of nutmeg and found that to be a nice touch.  This would make a great holiday side-dish.

We had never tried turnips before so this was the perfect starter recipe! Plus it has ingredients that I commonly have in the house.
