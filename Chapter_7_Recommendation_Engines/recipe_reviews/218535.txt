I've made this many times in the past with sliced almonds decorating the icing.  It's been called almond puff pastry too.  The only difference with this recipe is the addition of butter flavored extract which sounds very nice.  Love the recipe and it's always been a hit at get-togethers.

Been a favorite in my house for many, many years. I don't use the butter flavor but it might be good. Like other reviewer I also top with toasted sliced almonds. People are always impressed with this pastry. I just noticed that this says to bake for 55 minutes. I can't imagine. I make this a lot and 400 degrees for about 20 minutes is plenty. At 350 I think 45 minutes should be enough.

Loved this. Took it to church for Easter sunrise services. Looked for butter extract. Couldnt find it so i used almond, added some Butter Buds to the dough and topped with almonds. Stellar recipe. The only sweetness comes fro bthe icing so it isnt sicky sweet

I did change it a little but not much.  Between the layers I added Cherry preserves and they didn't have almonds in the grocery store I went to on vacation (except a huge bag) so i used chopped pecans.

I will make this again! My mom and grandma used up make this, but I didn't have the family cookbook on hand. This recipe seemed quite similar, so I did it. I used cream instead of milk (and needed more cream as a result since it's thicker) and added about a tablespoon of melted butter to the icing. Toasted the almond slices in a pan before sprinkling them. It was a big hit at the brunch I took it to. More than three people asked me for the recipe! Not too sweet, but sweet enough! And almond extract is rarely featured in desserts, so people really enjoyed it.

For those of you who have a hard time trying to find butter extract, I subbed in almond extract and it tasted just as good. Not a personal favourite but my parents loved it. I find the consistency of the egg to be a bit odd if you're used to more solid pastries.

Very good but doesn't keep well.  Also, mine "climbed" up the side of the pan making really large crusts so I would try to not let the egg layer touch the sides, if possible, next time.  The large crusts did not impact the tase much (it was really good) but it did negatively impact the presentation.
