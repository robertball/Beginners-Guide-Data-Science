I made this for morning church with seasonal apples and it was a big hit. Only change was to substitute light brown sugar for white.

I made this as a treat for my five children, they loved it. I made two adjustments, we used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil and increased the cinnamon to 1 Tbsp because we are cinnamon lovers. Thanks so much, I'm sure the kids will be asking for it again.
