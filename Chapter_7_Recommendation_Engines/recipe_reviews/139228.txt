I made these growing up with my grandma and this is just how she made hers.  I didn't have any cloth, so I made mine by wrapping the eggs in the skins and then wrapping them in aluminum foil.  I wasn't sure they would turn out, but they did!  So much easier and less time consuming.  The eggs are beautiful and I am happy to find a new spin on an old tradition.  I did add a teaspoon of vinegar to the pot; not sure whether that did anything or not.  Also, once the eggs are cool and dry, you can make them shine by rubbing a tiny bit of vegetable oil on the outside.

Another way to do this is to put one color of onion skin loose in the pot with the eggs, instead of wrapping them. This creates even coloring across the entire egg, if you don't like the mottled appearance created by wrapping the eggs.

In Greece they used to make Easter eggs this way before there was dye! They use only red onion skins to produce a gorgeous, deep hue. Try it!!!!!!!

I used red onion skins, and made as written. Make sure you use the dry skin and not moist peel or the color won't project on the egg. Look at the photos that Jr the submitter posted. They are very helpful.

My in-laws call these "wooden Easter eggs".  In their family tradition, the Easter Bunny lays wooden eggs around the house.  

The way I learned the technique, there's no need for cheesecloth.  Just put the eggs and onion skins in the water together, making sure that bits of skin are between the eggs for best marbling effect.  

When the eggs are finished, we rub them with vegetable oil to make them shine.

Keep them in the onion skins longer and they will turn out even darker. Also, be sure to make more than you'll need; some eggs will crack or take colour unevenly. Best part: the eggs look great and then you can still eat them!

I can remember  doing this some 40 years ago when I was a kid.  The only difference...we collected small leaves from the garden and placed them on the egg before wrapping them in the cheese cloth.  I always liked fern tips the best because they make the coolest design on the egg.  Brings back fun childhood memories as well as memories of doing this with my own children.

I am loving this idea. I despise the traditional method of dying eggs so I usually don't bother, but I'm looking forward to trying this. Thanks for the idea. :-)

An update to the original recipe...found out that you can use this method on blown out eggs.  Use your favorite method to blow out the raw egg from the shell - I just tap a small hole with the sharp end of a knife in each end of a raw egg and then blow with your mouth or and egg blowing tool on one hole while the raw egg pushes through the other hole.  If you have trouble, use a toothpick to try and lance the egg yolk while it is in the shell before blowing.  Once all the raw egg is out of the shell, rinse off the empty shell and begin to wrap (carefully) dry onion skins around the shell.  Secure with aluminum foil or cheese cloth and boil until desired color is achieved. Drain the eggs and let cool before unwrapping.  Boiling water will get inside the egg shell, so be careful and unwrap over a bowl or sink.  The marble affect will be permanent and you can use the eggs to decorate year after year.  You can leave with matte finish or cover with favorite clear coat finish.

I love this method and have been doing it for years! One additional tip: When cooled, coat each egg lightly in Olive oil to give it a gorgeous shine.
