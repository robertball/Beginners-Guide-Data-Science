This was great! I have to disagree with the other review saying too seasoned, and say that with just a dash of season salt, it was on the mild side for me (and I didn’t rinse the broth off!). I was just looking for a recipe that has a bunch of the ingredients I need to get rid of, but I’m going to save this as a template for other miscellaneous veggies. :)   The only improvement to the recipe I would make: please change the ingredients from saying “large chunks” to saying “shredded”. I had already chopped them by the time I got to the part that calls for a food processor, so I finely diced them best I could, when I could have used a grater. (Still good obviously and not a big deal. But mildly exasperated for a minute)

If you like foods with lots of seasoning, then this recipe is for you. It was a bit too seasoned for us. Thank you for the recipe.
