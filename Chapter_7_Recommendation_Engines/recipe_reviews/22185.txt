I've been tweaking this recipe for our own use.  I started by adding blue berries and have taken off with it.  With more batches, I have learned not to stir down the batter too much in the morning - otherwise you end up with flat,rubber disks. I found that the batter was better as it came up to room temp especially if I stired it too much.  I still want to try adding diced apple, but so far have been Vetoed by the family.  Blueberries are their favorite.

These were "ok" pancakes.  They did have some good flavor to them, a light hint of yeast/sourdough flavor.  The batter came out very thick and almost dough-like.  Next time I'll cut the flour to 2 cups and increase the milk a bit.  They were hard to spread on the grill, a little lumpy, but once cooked them you couldn't even tell.  When I took it out of the fridge, I let it sit for about 30 minutes before stirring (per the previous review), I did not want rubbery pancakes.  They did come out soft with a little fluff to them.  These are good when you want that light hint of sourdough flavor or you run out of your regular pancake mix.

I like these a bit thinner. They have a crunch missing from other pancakes and they are nearer to gaufres/belgian waffles. Cook longer with less heat to achieve this.

Very tasty!

These are really quick for weekday mornings.
They come out tasty too, but might benefit from the addition of some blueberries or something.

Great pancakes!  I changed the flour to whole wheat flour, the sugar to agave syrup, and used soy milk.  I let these rise for an hour instead of overnight.  I needed to add more soy milk, but I think that is because of the whole wheat flour, not the recipe.  These were quite fluffy; I compare them to fry bread!  These have a wonderful flavor!

These were good and I enjoyed them.  They were almost too yeasty for me, but they were still good.  I used a little whole wehat flour and served with real maple syrup.

This dough came out really thick. I had a little trouble transfering the dough from my spoon to the griddle. They came out okay, the flavor was different. I think if I were to make this again, I might just cut back a little on the flour and add more milk, like other 
reviewers have suggested.

These are edible, but thick and rubbery.  They don't taste like the yummy, thin yeast pancakes from a famous restaurant.

I have made great yeasted waffles, but never pancakes so I thought I would try these.  When I got it out this morning it was like dough not batter.  I tried several variations, finally I added more milk. Still not great results.  I like the use of vanilla, but not the cinnamon.  Tomorrow I'm going to try making waffles out of them.

the yeasty flavor is good. like buttermilk pancakes, but different.  I mixed all wet ingredients together before adding to dry, and stired until just combined. I also mashed a banana into wet ingredients. I only used 2 cups of flour and did half whole wheat. cooked on my electric griddle, 325Â° 4 or 5 mins each side. lots of butter and a drizzle of honey, and they were perfect.

I have made this recipe a couple of times now and it is a house favorite. The trick to this recipe is to not over stir before use. The pancakes have a great flavor and fantastic texture. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

The flavor of these remind me of mild sourdough without the extra work. Yum!  I should have read the other reviews first. I also had a batter that was more dough-like and thick. So I added mashed banana and milk to thin the consistency to make it easier to pour onto the electric griddle (375 degrees approx).  The flavor was good (we also added huckleberries!) but the texture was lacking. I will try these again with less flour, allow to come to room temperature and not over-stir (or use on a waffle iron if too thick).  I REALLY like that you can mix it up the night before and put in the fridge. A nice shortcut when you have company for breakfast. :)
