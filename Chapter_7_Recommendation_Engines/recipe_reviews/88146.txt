This was one of the best recipies I have ever made.  My husband thought it tasted like a "dairy farm" but agreed that it was exceptional. And yes, it is extremely fattening (although this really does end up being more than 4 servings).  A few things: I don't undertand why it says to cook the chicken for 30 mins...I think the adding watert and cooking the chicken step can me totally omitted(this recipe does not take nearly as long as it says). The cream cheese and butter don't blend well, I was worried I had done something wrong, but adding the cream completely remedied the problem.  Also, more chicken is definitely neccesary to give more substance. I might try lamb next time. A decadent meal...but certainly worth the (very rare) treat.

This was amazing! I just couldn't bring myself to add 1/2 cup of butter though, so I only added 1/4 cup. I also couldn't bring myself to add 1 1/2 cups of cream. Instead, I used 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of whole milk. As a last-minute decision, I steamed some broccoli, chopped it and added it in as well. The outcome was fabulous! Definitely a five star dish. The garlic, white pepper and cayenne was especially nice on the chicken. Believe it or not, it gets away with five cloves of garlic and tastes just right. Hubby couldn't believe it when I told him there were five cloves in it. Alright, I think I better go do some stomach crunches now. (yeah, right.)

Although this recipe has enough calories to feed a small village for a week, it was delectable!!!! I used another half of chicken breast for more 'substance'and added a bit more saffron and sprikled fresh parsley on top for a bit more flavoring.  Next time I would use a little less butter.  Next time we want a great 'resturant' meal, we'll make this again.

This was so-so.  The flavor was strongly overpowered by the cream cheese.  As another reviewer put it, "not worth the fat."  And don't be fooled by the pretentious title and description.  Algerian, French and Italian? Gimme a break. It's alfredo sauce with saffron.

After reading all the reviews, I made the following revisions: 3 chicken breast halves, 1/4 c butter,  light cream cheese, 1 c fat free half and half and a half cup evaporated milk, and Kraft parmesan cheese. Even with all the modifications, this was still very good. After dousing this with pepper at the table, I realized I couldn't taste the saffron so I would avoid adding additional pepper. I served this over vegetable pasta to mitigate the unhealthyness of the sauce. If I made this again, I would cut back on the cream cheese and possibly add some extra half and half or milk to make this sauce a little thinner.

The flavor of this is wonderful. I even had all the ingredients available (due to a prior investment in the costly saffron threads!) This dish is tasty as long as you can overlook an obscene amount of fat. You can feel your arteries clogging as you consume it, so I would have to call this an occasional, or perhaps rare, treat!

I was looking for an interesting dish to use with saffron.  I haven't tried this recipe yet, but it looks great.  Recipe resembles an alfredo sauce and to cut calories I just use a block of fat free cream cheese...with the other ingredients I don't lose the texture or taste...just less time to spend at the gym

i used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese, and evaporated skim milk instead of cream to cut down on the fat content of this dish. i also skipped the step of adding the water and cooking for 30 minutes, just browned the chicken pieces until they were cooked through. it was still very, very good.

This was very good. I liked the addition of saffron (to the look and taste). I may try this next time with some shrimp - although I'll definitely reduce the initial cooking time.

Completely amazing dish!  My husband and I loved the kick that the white pepper and cayenne gave it and thought the saffron was a genius addition!  I did use neufchatel instead of cream cheese and 1/2% milk instead of cream for a lighter version, and it was absolutely delicious nonetheless!

I had to make this recipe after reading the reviews, and was disappointed.  The only change I made was adding extra chicken.  I would add extra of both peppers, garlic, and saffron.  The sauce thickens very quickly as it cools to a bad consistency.  My family and I love pasta dishes, and this one simply did not impress (even my 8 yr old who loves alfredo sauce ate very slowly).  Not worth the calories.

This recipe is excellent. It's alfredo sauce with a twist and I love it. The only thing is what the other reviewers said. The step with cooking 30 minutes after adding water is too much. After you add the water, you can cook for about 5-10 minutes. I also added more saffron for a more defined flavor.

Fantastic!  I think next time I will add more saffron, but it was excellent just as it was.  Very easy to make.

I enjoyed it, but next time I use my $afron, it will be for something more interesting than chicken alfredo.

Excellent taste, but OH MY GOSH THE FAT!!!  I used Skim Milk instead of cream and thickened slightly with cornstarch.  Didn't miss the cream but I'm sure if you used it, it would knock the socks (and belts) off of company.   This makes a pile of sauce so I added some cut up cooked brocolli, mushrooms and red bell peppers.  Wonderful special occasion dish!

I've made this twice now, and oh wow...YUM!  The first time I made it, I was out of saffron, and last night, I was out of Parmesan, lol.  It was still out of this world though.  Like another poster mentioned--I didn't use quite as much butter, and I also added a third chicken breast half for more substance. Definitely a keeper, although probably only make it once or twice per year.  Thanks!

Over the years every once in a while I am caught off guard with an unexpected guest or two.  When those times happen, this is always a wonderful dish to serve as either an entree or as a first course (without the chicken. perhaps with a sliver of Truffle instead).  I always have these ingredients on hand, even the pasta, which I usually have in the form of tortellini in the freezer.
I have to say that this recipe is fantastic, unfortunately I and people of my age (older than dirt) can only take it in small doses if about 4 or 5 pieces, which makes for a nice appetizer (first course) with a special edible decoration.

Very good! A little on the sweeter side, because the cream cheese really stands out...but it was good! I did all as written, but drained some of the oil before adding the cream cheese because it seemed like way too much. Thanks!

This is totally a 5star recipe -- I followed some of the recommendations of others, and used 1/2 the butter, and 3/4 c cream plus 3/4 c milk. But I included ALL the cream cheese suggested in the recipe. I don't know what makes this alfredo so amazing, but perhaps it's the saffron? It's truly fantastic :) Love!

Tasted like your standard Alfredo to me, and it needed some vegetables to make it interesting. I added a bag of frozen peas, which helped a little.

My husband and kids always tells me if they like the food or not. My Husband said to keep this recipe so it was good. will make again. Oh I added broccoli to the recipe and it still was good.
