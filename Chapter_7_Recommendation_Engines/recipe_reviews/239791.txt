This rub is amazing. I used garlic powder, not onion powder and bought NY strips. I let them marinade for two hours. After four minutes on each side, and a square of butter for the last minute, they were done. This will be my go to rub for steaks on the grill.

I  grill year round and have never tasted such a great steak before. I'll  definitely be doing this one a lot more. I  covered it in the rub a few hours before I grilled it and put in a zip lock bag. 2-3 minutes each side creating the x mark.

Let it marinade it for about 30 minute and grill it medium rare... 2 to 3 minutes per side and creating the X marks for a great presentation

Made as directed.  Used Starbucks French Roast for my coffee.  Delicious kind of crust on our New York strip steak.

Rub was full of flavor complimenting the Fillet Minion. Four of us loved the rub. We liked it better than other coffee ribs.

We liked it a lot. I'm used to pretty basic steaks. I just want to taste the meat. But this was a nice change. As usual, I altered the quantity of some ingredients:  less chili powder, mixed garlic and onion powder. I wasnt sure how I'd like the sugar. I can see it's needed to balance the spice level. My partner liked it with the tiny sweet note. Personally, I'd cut back on that next time. Overall I liked it a lot and it was a nice, yet subtle change.
