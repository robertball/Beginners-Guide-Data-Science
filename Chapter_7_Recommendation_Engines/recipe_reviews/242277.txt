As I did not have cream cheese I made it using Ricotta cheese and a tiny bit of mayonnaise and I used real garlic in the place of the powder. Turned out well.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  Everyone enjoyed it. I added about a half a cup of shredded cheddar cheese before adding the bread crumbs. Make sure you take off as much of the harder areas of the artichokes as possible. I think next time I will mix the artichokes with the spinach.
