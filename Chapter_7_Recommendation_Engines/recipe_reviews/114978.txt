Liked the idea, but canned peas?  Tried it twice.  Second time I used frozen peas and it tasted much better.  Also, I used the olive oil mayo, not regular.  As I said, good idea.  Just monkey with it a bit to your own tastes.

I did enjoy this, but, I would think a can of peas to one can of tuna would be too much. I used about 1/2 C of frozen peas instead. It's a great way to add a veggie in. If I had added a tsp of black pepper I would never have been able to eat this. I am not a black pepper fan. I did put a few shakes in, though. I was almost leary of adding a whole teaspoon of garlic powder, but, I did add it. I really like garlic/garlic powder and use it quite a bit. I didn't really taste it all that much while I ate it but there was a bad aftertaste. I'll only add 1/2 tsp next time. I will make this again.  P.S. I just noticed this recipe is for 6 people!?!? LOL! I ate the whole thing!

Use thawed frozen peas, canned peas are mushy. Also I like to add some chopped red onion.

I love this recipe but spice it up a bit with a few chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce or Mexican hot sauce to taste.  I also add garlic powder and eat it all with tortilla chips.  Mmmmm!

Albacore tuna is a must. Yes frozen peas for sure as so many others suggested. I used 2.5 cups. Also I added green onion, and a little red. As well as some red bell pepper, taco cheese blend, to make it stretch farther. Oh and finally cayenne pepper, chili powder too. Fantastic

In my continued quest to get my family to eat peas, this worked wonderfully!  I had to improvise and use frozen peas instead of canned and then I used a little more (full-fat) mayo than the recipe asked for, but it worked well.  Nice easy recipe!

I think the roportions where off I used 2 cans of tuna instead of 1. I also used half of the what was called for pepper and garlic.  Placed on toasted wheat bread for a sandwhich.

I loved that this was super easy. I made it as written but I will prbably add some minced onion next time. Thank you for such a super easy idea and the canned peas help make it easy.

I agree with previous reviewers who suggest frozen peas in place of canned. Canned are too mushy -- the frozen ones add a nicer texture. I also add in a bit of minced onion. This is a great recipe/idea though. The peas really add something nice and a good change of pace from the standard celery in tuna salad! :)

I made this a few months ago but forgot to leave a rating. Leaving it 5 stars due to the fact that this is SUPER easy to whip up, and could feed a crowd or potluck easily! And my, is it yummy! We ate it with crackers, but this is versatile! Thank you!

PERFECT! I used this recipe to make a tuna melt for the kids and we ALL loved it! Thank you! We used frozen peas (didn't have canned) and let them thaw in the tuna salad while we heated the bread and melted the cheese.

We had Spaniards visiting some years back and they made this dish. Loved it then, love it now.  I also used frozen peas, added onion and small pasta shells for a heartier salad.  Awesome, thanks for sharing the recipe.

I am 50. My grandma made this when I was young, it's a childhood memory. I have talked about this for probably 30 years and came upon this recipe. I read every review, every "tweak" and first time followed the real written directions. If you have enough cooking history: you know that tuna is much more dense, would follow the mixing  directions and then add the can of peas. The recipe is perfect except we need to remember this came from our ancestors/WWII so they used real mayonnaise and then added salt. Made recipe spot on...tweaked mayo to 1/2 cup and salt to taste.

My can of tuna was only 5 oz, so I scaled down the amounts of the ingredients to my preference. I used frozen peas, and it seems many reviewers also preferred those. I just microwaved them for 20-30 seconds to soften a bit. I gave it a few shakes of lemon juice; it seems to freshen certain fish dishes. I also added a little chopped red onion, which others did. I wanted this for lunch, so mine was not cold. It will be much better after it is chilled. Thanks for this very easy, different and delicious recipe!

So easy yet so perfect. I love this recipe, and I make it often. I recommend using frozen peas that are slightly thawed. I love it on toasted bread for lunch.  A keeper for life!

Yummy! I have been trying to like tuna salad for a long time and this recipe just might be the key! I don't even buy canned peas, so I used frozen and just eyeballed the proportions. Mine had a lot of peas in it - like the picture. Also threw in some real bacon bits that I had on hand and plenty of onion and garlic powder. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this, especially on whole grain toast. Thanks for the tuna salad breakthrough!

I used two 12oz cans of tuna and about half the can of peas - also adjusted mayo & seasonings to my taste. I also added green onion and some celery salt. Good basic recipe that allows for easy changes for whatever you prefer.

This recipe was a hit with our family. However I only used a half can of the peas and added my favorite Mrs. Dash`s original seasoning (That is the best seasoning ever!).

I only had a small can of tuna and small can of peas, so I used 1 tbsp. mayo and half of the seasoning.  I enjoyed it with kalamata olives chopped.  Next time I'll add minced garlic instead of powder for more flavor.

It`s different and it`s would be good to take for a bunch of people since it is quick to make.
I would suggest more tuna in it though.
