There were some  issues with this recipe from the beginning. When it said to spray an 8-inch baking dish, I realized that there were too many ingredients in the recipe for such a small dish. I used an 11 x 7 inch baking dish, and even that was too small. I should have used my 9 X 13 inch baking dish. The second major fault in this recipe is that the zucchini should have been pre-cooked. The whole dish was full of liquid even after baking for 90 minutes, it overflowed while baking, and what a mess in the oven! I'm sure the liquid came out of the raw zucchinis. I used three small zucchinis rather than 1 1/2 large ones, and I used Italian-seasoned ground turkey instead of ground beef. I had fresh basil, so I added some of that and dried Italian seasoning to the sauce. As I typed this review I just noticed another issue . The "Cook" information  under the recipe title says to cook the lasagna for 60 minutes. In direction #6 of the recipe it says "Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until golden, about 15 minutes more." Mine baked for an hour before I removed the aluminum foil, and even after 30 more minutes, the cheese on the top had melted, but never became golden. In spite of all the issues, the lasagna tasted great. I will use this recipe again, with the changes I noted, especially pre-cooking the  zucchini slices. Some other recipes recommend roasting them in the oven. I will try that next time.

I made this the same way I make regular lasagna, adding parmesan cheese to the ricotta and adding some sauce to the pan first so the zucchini doesn't stick, also there is never a reason to add oil to the frying pan when cooking ground meat, it makes its own grease and you have to drain it anyway. Other than that this was a very tasty dish and I would make it again.

I excluded the salt and nutmeg the second time I made it.  It tasted too salty to me and I'm not a big fan of nutmeg.  I think I will add another layer the next time I make it.  I prefer my lasagna being three layers high.

This review is based on the recipe as written. I tried two different slicing methods for the zucchini and settled on the mandolin slicer. This made the noodles a little thicker than I wanted, but they turned out fine. I patted them dry with a paper towel but did not salt them or attempt to cook them prior to use. I did double the recipe so I could feed several people and have leftovers. The overall flavor was excellent. Everyone agreed that the nutmeg has to go. It overpowered the ricotta layer and no one cared for the flavor.
This recipe needed to cook much longer than written. I cooked it as written and it wasn't even bubbling. I added 15 minutes covered before it began to bubble. I removed the cover and cooked as written but the cheese didn't brown so I turned the oven to broil to really get the top layer of cheese burnt like we like it.
I read several reviews that talked about too much water so I cooked the pans of lasagna on a cookie sheet. I only had a slight amount of "boil over" and it appears that liquid was grease from the cheese.
We allowed the lasagna to rest about 15 minutes prior to cutting and it held its shape when served. This will be added to our recipes with a few minor changes.

This dish was quite tasty. I was feeding a crowd so I made the lasagne in a bigger baking dish. I added about 1/2 lbs. of mild Italian sausage to the ground beef. Also, did 15 ounces of ricotta, two eggs and Parmesan for that yummy, creamy layer. And rather than jarred sauce I made my own - olive oil  in a heated pan, salt, red pepper flakes, 3-4 cloves garlic (sauté for just a minute) then add a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes and simmer. Add the beef/sausage mixture to the sauce and a handful of chopped parsley. Be sure to use a mandolin to slice the zucchini about 3/8” think. Layer it up, bake and enjoy!

This was fantastic! I admit when I was preparing it, my 15 year old son gave me a little groan, but he agreed he would try it and it turned out to be really delicious! Personally, I feel like you couldn't even tell it wasn't pasta. The only things I did differently were that I sauteed onions and garlic in the beef. I also used 3 whole zucchinis, did not have any nutmeg, and I used a whole jar of marinara sauce (didn't measure it). Just make it however you normally make lasagna and you will like it!

Great recipe.  1 and 1/2 zucchini required a little guess work.  I salted the zucchini and let it drain for a half hour, before drying further on a towel.  I also omitted the salt.  Let the pan sit 10 minutes before slicing to serve.

Pretty much doubled the recipe (used four zukes) so I could use my usual 9" x 13" lasagna pan. Also added a tablespoon or so of garlic and some basil and oregano to the sauce, along with a splash of red wine. Carefully used a mandoline to uniformly slice the zukes, which I salted to help release some of their water. The finished dish was absolutely delicious — I think I actually prefer zucchini to lasagna noodles. Definitely will make this again; the only change from what I did this time will be to drain the beef after browning it (and before adding the sauce).

This is delish! I peeled the zucchini first and to reduce the amount of water I would periodically take my baster and suck out some of the water/grease sitting in the corners while cooking. My children complained a little that the "pasta" was a bit crunchy...next time I think I may cook it longer with the foil on for 45 min instead of 30 min.

Yes, it’s watery as others are saying. Taste good, but could be better. Maybe prebake the zucchini?

I'm a no fuss cook who looks for the shortcuts.  I'd rather be in my garden growing stuff than in the kitchen cooking it.  I am going to make this again but this time I am going to run the Zucchini through my shredder.  I will put the shredded Zucchini in a colander and allow the Zucchini to shed the excess liquids.  That was my family's only complaint - a little weepy.  Otherwise it was a hit.

Doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 pan. It was excellent!!! Next time I might salt the zucchini and let it set for an hour to draw some of the moisture out. I will definitely be making this again AND AGAIN!

It tastes great but the zucchini makes it's own juice so it can be watery.  Will definitely make again to see if I can find a solution.

Based on previous suggestions, I doubled the recipe and added sweet Italian sausage, and ground turkey. I also used garlic and onion. This zucchini lasagna was the highlight of a large family gathering. It received rave reviews and I had to promise to make sure it is  on hand for all future gatherings! Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!

Added a couple mild italian sausages with the ground beef.  Baked off the sliced, salted zucchini first and dried on paper towels.  Used more than the listed ricotta and as always, added eggs, grated parmesan cheese, dried basil and salt & pepper to it.  Husband loved it.  Also, made sure to use a low carb pasta sauce and more than listed.  Husband loved it.  Said it is better than regular lasagna.

Will make it again, but next time I'll bake the zucchini a little first.

Off course you have to season it the way you prefer, I added garlic, basil and broth to the marinara ground beef sauce. But the ricotta cheese mix was delicious, and sure tasted like an amazing lasagna.

Left out the ground beef. Used sour creme instead of the ricotta. Used mixed Italian cheese instead of mozzarella.

This is easy and delicious!  I swapped the beef with chicken so a friend could enjoy as well.  The Kitchenaid veggie slicer made perfect zucchini “pasta”, so if you don’t have one I highly recommend it.  Can’t wait to make it again!  So good!

Yummy! Next time I'll cook some of the water out of the zucchinis first, as mine didn't hold together well. But, the taste was great! I coated the pan with avocado oil, I never use cooking spray, but made no other changes. Great recipe!

This was delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I used 3 small zucchinis, and that wasn't enough to give me 3 layers, so I only made 2.  I didn't add the nutmeg either, and used 1/2 the amount of salt it called for.  Also used 9x13 pan

Everyone loved it. It is great for leftovers too. I did not change the recipe, only made sure the sauce was on the thick side to counter any water from the zucchini . Thanks for sharing :)

Amazing recipe! I added 1/2 extra cup of sauce and another cup of cheese. Again amazing!
