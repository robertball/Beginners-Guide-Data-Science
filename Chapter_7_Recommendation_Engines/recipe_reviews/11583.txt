It ran off the cookies and made a big mess.

Well I tried this recipe and we found it to be I'm sorry very tasteless. Also it's thin and runs off the cookie as it has nothing to hold it together. Like a base. I do not like sounding so harsh but I feel I need to be honest here as I like to know myself before I make a recipe.

My siblings and I used to do this with our Mom when we were kids. It isn't supposed to add more flavor to the cookies it is actually a better way to decorate them without adding extra sugar which works for me as my youngest boy doesn't need any extra. So yes this is all the ingredients there is nothing missing at all. It is fun to do and the cookies come out shiny and painted.

OK this cannot be all of the ingredients unless the poster meant Condensed milk instead of evaporated milk..... there has to be other ingredients for consistency. I think something was forgotten.

I have not tried this yet but I feel like this would be a great idea for making colors to paint on top of a thin icing like the sugar cookie icing on this site specially cute snowmen. I will try and see what happens.

Sorry thought this was a great idea. However didn't have much success with mine. It was so runny that no paintbrush could really control where the color was going. Might work well as a "stain" to color some light color cake.

I tried this years back. You do use evaporated milk and it does work. It's best to make the paint quite pale as it gets much darker after baking. Brush it on THINLY letting it sink into the cookie. It's true that it's hard to get fine details. You might want to use a toothpick to paint if you want to make eyes etc.
