Quick, easy, tasted great! I downsized the recipe to use for a smaller batch of cookies.  I loved it! It came out smooth and I was spreading this on cookies like a pro!  I made Valentine's cookies and the pink frosting looks and tastes delicious. I would recommend it and definately use it again! I like the petit fore (sp?) idea and will try that soon.

Outstanding, I needed a recipe that would give me a frosting in just a few minutes and this did the trick. My wife loved it so much she's been snacking on the leftovers!

Doesn't curdle like other frosting recipes I've tried. It has a great flavor and takes color really nicely. Even without coloring it produces a very nice white color. I put the frosting on while the cookies were still warm. They frosting melted nicely over them producing a shiny hard frosting layer. It looks professional. I highly recommend this recipe.

I love this frosting for cut out cookies!  You can vary the thickness by the amount of milk - I have used it in a bag with tip to write and decorate, and thinner as an all over frosting for cookies.  It dries very nicely so that you can stack the cookies and they still look good.

I used 1/4 of the milk for a thicker frosting. This was enough to cover the top and sides of a 25cm (10 inch) round cake with a cup full leftover. And yes, it's really GOOD.

I've tried many frosting recipes from this site and this is one of the best. The taste is great, it's easy to make, and it dries nice and hard. My cookies looked and tasted like something from a bakery. I highly recommend this recipe. Thank you, it's a relief to finally have a good frosting recipe!!!

I used this frosting to pipe onto cupcakes, so I only used enough milk to get it to the consistency I wanted for that. I found this on the high range of sweetness with 4 cups of powdered sugar, and for my liking 1 T. of vanilla was about three times more than I would have preferred.

I had to add extra powdered sugar and 2 teaspoons of flour to get piping consistancy. But it set up nicely in the fridge afterwards.

I am surprised at how many positive reviews this recipe has received. After reading the great reviews I was really disappointed after I tried it. It was really quick and easy to prepare, I will give it that. To me it tasted like liquid powdered sugar. Even with all of that butter and vanilla. It was too thin for a cake. I think my opinion might have been different if I tried them on sugar cookies...and that is the only reason I am giving it a 3. I won't try this again for a cake though!

Great, easy and yummy frosting!  I cut in half as I didn't need quite that much.  I used this to frost Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies (which don't really need frosting, but it was my 7 yr old son's birthday cake request!).  Very good and worked out well with the brownies and mini coloured M&M's!

It's got a great flavor, but it's slightly lumpy and hardens pretty quickly. The flavor overrides the textural issues, though. Yum!

Great Recipe.  I added some Almond extract and tasted wonderful.  Easy to work with.  I used this frosting on "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe for Christmas cookies and they tasted great!

I did not like this recipe. It tastes like powdered sugar. I was looking for a recipe that took less time than the one that I normally use but this was not it. I had to make a lot of changes such as heating it, adding lemon juice and more milk, pouring and then refrigerating it. Maybe it is good for cookies but it was not right for my petit fours.

Really GOOD and really simple.  I'm surprised more people haven't rated this one.  Followed it exactly and I had enough icing to frost 24 cupcakes.  Will make again, thanks.

This was great, altho I didn't use a full tablespoon of vanilla.  Also, it takes some time to dry completely.

This frosting is really good! If you want to use it with a cake, definitely use less milk. I used just under 1/4 cup and it was still slightly thin. The taste more than made up for it though!

I put this on sugar cookies..loved it so much I made a second batch and it also inspired me to double vanilla in all my baking.  The only thing is you have to use clear vanilla if you want it white since the extra vanilla makes it a little bit on the brown side.  I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract

Really good.  I'm not a fan of frosting but needed some "green grass" for my cake.  Easy to work with and tasty.  I used the same recipe but added 1/2 cup cocoa and reduced to 3 1/2 confectioners' sugar for the chocolate frosting in the middle of the cake.  Don't think I'll use another frosting recipe.   Thanks!! ^_^

At first, I thought this recipe was a bit too "sugary. But when I added a couple drops of peppermint flavoring, it tasted really fresh and set up so nicely, I will likely use this again!

Super easy! I cut the portion down to 12 and made a batch to frost Pumpkin Muffins II. It was pretty runny, so I'm not sure if the proportions were wrong, but the taste was good. I've got in the fridge now to see if it thickens. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe should be called really freakin awesome frosting.  So far, I have been settling for disgustingly fake tasting homemade frosting.  This one is anything but.  I will be throwing away all other frostings as this will be my go to frosting.  Thanks so much for making a frosting that doesn't suck!

Extremely easy and very tasty!  Simple to make thicker or thinner by adding more sugar or milk.  Great!

It tasted reallllly good and made a buncha frosting. I only had really thin 1% milk so I used a cream/milk combo (mostly cream). It worked out just fine. I also used the food coloring gel instead of dye-still okay. I'm guessing this is a hard one to mess up.:)

I love this recipe.  I substituted almond extract for vanilla and got rave reviews.  I used this recipe with "The Best Rolled Sugar cookies" recipe.  I will make again and again and again.  Thanks

I had to add more confectioners sugar to make a little stiffer.  I decorated a birthday cake with it, and I had alot of fun doing it.  I doubled the recipe and dyed it different colors.

Great cookie frosting! I used it to ice Christmas cookies so I divided it in half, making one half red and the other green.  I left ou the vanilla and flavored the red half with 1 tsp. strawberry extract, and the green half with about 3/4 tsp. almond extract.  It turned out delicious, and it dried perfectly!  This was my first time making frosted cookies. I am glad it was so easy and turned out so well.  My 2 1/2 year old son helped and enjoyed too!

This was very quick to make and the kids really enjoyed frosting the cookies we had made.  It was a lot thicker than I would have liked.  Next time I will use more milk to thin it down.

This was great frosting.  It is perfect for sugar cookies.  Once colored, the cookies look professional--just like store sugar cookies...only cheaper!  This is a recipe I will continue to use.

I made sugar cookies and I found this recipe for the frosting. I added lemon extract instead of vanilla to make it a lemon frosting and it worked so well! It’s the best frosting I’ve ever made! It tastes so good! So if you are looking for a frosting, definitely use this recipe!!

It was a little thin, but I added a quarter cup extra powdered sugar, which fixed that. Also, I added three T of almond extract.

Quick, easy frosting. Excellent consistancy. I used it to frost a cake, but I think might be better to use cookies.  Slightly on the sweet side, but will use again for sure.

I loved this recipe!  I used 1/4 cup of milk, but ended up adding a little more powdered sugar at the end because the vanilla changed the consistency drastically!  Beware; this frosting is MAJORLY sugary, so don't have too much before you try to fall asleep! :)

The recipe as written was too runny for me. I reduced the milk to 1/4 cup. It is delicious and is easy to half to frost 12 cupcakes.
