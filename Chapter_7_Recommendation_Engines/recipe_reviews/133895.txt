Very good! I changed the servings to two for the amounts of fish and veggies but changed the servings to 4 for the amount of spices to use.  I also used both kalamata and spanish olives, I also used 1 cup olives.  Not being a huge fan of beans, I replaced with broccoli.  Spicy, great tasting. The fish just soaks up all that flavor.  My husband was very suprised by this dish.  He loved it.

Absolutely an EXCELLENT recipe! My non-fish-loving husband gulfed this down in 5 minutes! I followed the recipe along with some of the raters' suggestions. These are the changes I made: 1) Cut down serving size for 2 for fish/veggies & serving for 4 for the spices (as another rater did) 2) used dry parsley since I didn't have fresh ones on hand 3) used 1 cup mixed black & green olives sliced 4) added 1 sliced serrano pepper to add more spice (we love spicy) 5) added 1/2 cup raisins to the dish. I also cooked the fish for 40 mins as the recipe said, but I think it would have been done in 30 mins (it started to break apart at 40 mins). 
I served the fish with the easy curry coucous (recipe found on this site) without the raisins in that recipe...the dishes combined was a GREAT hit!

I made this with a little less fish but all the vegetables.  I added more olives and also adde 1/2 cup of raisins for the savory/sweet combo that I remembered from my trip to Morocco.  A little spicy, but a BIG hit at my house

YUM!!!  I only used 3 pounds of tilapia with the veggie and spices remaining the same and it was good and made a HUGE portion.   Also, I changed the cooking method because I wanted to put it in the oven and leave it alone: I put the vegetable/spices/chickpeas mixture in a 9 x 13 baking dish, rubbed both sides of the fillets with the mixture, placed them on top of the vegetables, poured about a cup of chicken broth instead of the bouillon/water mix and baked for 25 min or so at 375 degrees (temp suggested by another user as well).  Served with rice and crusty bread.

I loved this recipe. THe only changes I made were to use a can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh, both kalamata and green olives (probably about a cup worth) and added some spinach on top. Oh I also cut the red pepper way down so that it wouldn't be too spicy for the kiddos. I will definitely be making this again and soon.

great North African recipe. I did add a few capers, and also added a few more olives,omitted the paprika and opted for rahs hanout instead. everything else the same. I think I only had 2.5# of tilapia and it was perfect as is over rice. I'd like to try this with cod.

We have been looking for variety as we try in increase our fish intake. This recipe will definitely be part of our regular collection. I followed the recipe very closely, only using about 1 cup of chicken broth instead of bouillion and water, cutting the spice down to 1/2 teas. cayenne (for preference), and used 20 oz. of mahi mahi (the amount our family eats in one meal). The half reduction of cayenne still gave it a little kick for the adults to enjoy and the kids would eat it too.

I made this recipe as published minus the carrots because we are on a low-carb diet.  I love other Spanish/Moroccan dishes.  Unfortunately we didn't love this recipe.  There was flavor, but it bordered on bland rather than complex.  It also was very expensive to make and 5lbs of tilapia is far too much.  If you'll notice the posted photo is in a tin foil pan.  That's because it won't all fit in ones skillet.

This definitely is reminscient of dishes my host mom would make when I was living in southern Spain.  I used more olives but otherwise kept it pretty consistent with the recipe.  Turned out great :)

I really liked it the next day more than the first day.  The flavors really blended more into the fish.  I think next time I may cook the vegetable combination really slowly to get the full flavor going and mix the fish into the hot mixture in small chunks or something so the flavor gets into the fish more and the fish flavor gets into the vegetables.  Thanks for sharing this unique dish!!!

I will definitely make this recipe again.  It reminded me a lot of my hostmom's cooking when I lived in Spain.  I used sole instead of tilapia, and omitted the olives and parsley just because of what I had on hand.  I think I also used a bit less cumin.  It was an easy and delicious dish.  I served it over couscous, but rice would work as well.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this last night with 3.5 pounds fish, double, double the vegies (except the red peper which stayed the same), 1 cup raisins, 1 cup olives, 3 cans chopped tomatoes and half the spices (for the three year old). I left out the salt and let people add it as they wished. It worked great and my son loved it. Keeping the spices as-is in the recipe would be quite nice as well. Also: I had access to some really nice sweet Spanish paprika which really enhanced the flavor.

My new favourite fish recipe. Must use fresh parsley and you definitely don't need 5lbs of fish. I used 1lb (5 filets) and it was perfect.

Spectacular recipe!  I was looking for something to use with Swai fillets. I prepared this recipe "for four", rounded all the ingredients up, used 1/2 cup of chicken boullion broth and added two large Swai fillets.  As hoped, I have enough left over vegetable base to reheat and add two more fillets for another dinner.  These are all my favorite spices and ingredients; was glad it was not too "bland-ized"; The cayenne was not at all timid.  Lovely meal! with a nice cold chardonnay!

Made this dish last night EXACTLY as written except I used haddock I had on hand instead of tilapia. I think this would be good with most mild white fish. It is a wonderful dish! My husband said I MUST keep this recipe. The mis of spices creates an amazing taste.

Oh this was soooooooo good. I did everything according to the recipe except for the olives just because I don't like them. I cut the recipe in half but there was still A LOT left over. I thought it was perfect but husband said he wanted more spice.

Needs lot's more other seasoning and what they recommend is too much of that especially cumin.  You put that much cumin and it will taste very gritty. Add about 6 cloves garlic and about tbs tomato paste for a thicker broth to put over couscous.

An excellent recipe and I think I made it even better.   I replaced the paprika with ground sumac.   Sumac is a Moroccan spice and it really works for this recipe.   I doubled everything except the amount of fish and it was the perfect amount for 9 adults.   I also added capers and doubled up again on the olives.   This has to be served with couscous.    I enhanced the couscous a little by adding pine nuts.    Great meal.

I used this recipe as a rough guide to make it for 2 with stuff I had on hand. I subbed canned tomatoes and coconut oil (I never cook with vegetable oil), I didn't have bell peppers or olives and I doubled the carrots. I also added raisins at another reviewer's suggestion, which is perfect. I can't imagine not having them in there.

I will definitely make this again. The vegetables are SO GOOD!

Had to modify slightly based on what I had in my cupboard but this was delicious!  Tasted just like the Moroccan dishes in the restaurants where I used to dance.  Was a huge hit with my husband and 18-month-old and got us talking about the "good old days" :)   Thank you for sharing!

Delicious - just be careful not to add too much water. I made that mistake the 2ndvtime and missed the intense flavors that make this dish so tasty.

Made it with cod rather than tilapia.  Loved the vegetables, but only Frank enjoyed the fish.  Will try again using tilapia and then review again.
Made it again with tilapia and it was wonderful.

I have made this dish many times and it always comes out delicious.  I make it using 2lbs of tilapia and switch the serving size to 4 for the veg. and spices.  I serve it with pita bread so it can be dipped into the spicy sauce. Thanks for the great recipe.

delicious. BUT - proportions in the recipe are seriously off. I used only 3.5 lbs of tilapia, and it was enough for 6 hungry people at LEAST. I also cut the cumin and the cayenne in half - I adore spices and cook moroccan, indian, etc. food all the time, but 4 tablespoons of cumin is insane. with my adjustments the fish came out excellent. as other reviewers have noted, it is better the next day (which makes it great for entertaining since you can prepare it the day before).

My husband really liked this but there was some spice I wasn't crazy about maybe the paprika since I don't use that often.  The fish was nice and tender easy to just plop on and forget about and the veggies were good.  Served it over mediterr. couscous.  Will try again but change up some of the spices

I changed it quite a bit, used a lot less fish, used extra fire roasted tomato, and used 2 fire roasted hatch peppers.  I think I would have like the original, but I made it more toward my husbands taste.

YUM! This was well worth the time to make. The only change I made was to cut back a bit on the cyanne (sp?) pepper. I figured I could add more in the end if it needed it. I served this over Saffron rice (cheap pack for grocery store) & it was a big hit. It was like a fish stew. mmm mmm mmm We had a little left over & I had to stop myself from raiding the 'fridge @ about 2 this morning & finishing it off. Great recipe, will make again!

This is my favorite recipe I have found on this site so far.  We didn't have chickpeas (and I really don't like them) so I used black beans instead.  Also used less fish just enough to cover the top.  It was fantastic and even better then next day!

Drummed this one up for some of my Vegitarian friends and I applied the following subs: Veg boulion black beans for  the garbanzo.  Upped the spicing a bit and with the Simple Curry Couscous found on this site was completely brilliant.

Unless you read a recipe before going to the store and buy all the ingredients chances are you are getting ideas and work with what you already have. At least that is my case. So, i had zuchinni and yellow squash, celery, no red pepper, yes olives, onion ,garlic, a can of diced tomato and chicken stuck leftover.  Smells like heaven. Will serve over plain white rice. (Cooking while I review, I know its going to be good)

Really flavorful and came out beautifully.  I made this a couple years ago then lost the recipe. Took me a while to find it again but I'm sure glad I did! The only change I made was I left out the carrots.

Absolutely delicious.  Just the right amount of spice and great flavor.  Split the serving size in half, left out onion (because I forgot to get one), and bouillon (also because we didn't have it) and added extra carrots and garlic.  Will definitely make again!!

This was delicious!  Easy to make, and also easy to halve the recipe to accommodate less fish.  Subbed in chicken broth for bullion, and added raisins.  I will definitely make again and again!

AMAZING. I used only 1.5lbs fish but kept all the veg and spice amounts the same and it was delicious. Did the veggie step the night before, then baked the fish w/veg on top (in some veg broth) for 30 min @ 375 right before serving. This was definitely spicy, and I might cut down on cayenne next time, but it was so flavorful! Sprinkling raisens into the veg mix is also a nice touch.

I omitted the red peppers.  Instead of the bouillon cubes, I poured about 1/2 cup of chicken broth over the fish/vegetable mixture and baked it in the oven at 375 degrees for approximately 20 minutes or until the fish was flaky.  I served it with couscous!  Yum!

This was fairly good, but I found the flavor very strange. I'm not sure if it was the recipe or the fact I don't care for fish paired with tomatoes.

Great taste good meal. I don't like tilapia and I have a freezer full of halibut so that's what I used.  I think cooking time of 40 minutes is way off.  I cooked my thick halibut fillet for about 20 minutes and it was flakey good.

I made this dish with what I had in the house, and went light on the salt.  I omitted the olives and bell pepper, and substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the fresh ones.  Instead of 5 pounds of  tilapia, I used about a pound of haddock, and added a yellow squash, cut into cubes.  It made three servings, heavier on beans and veges than fish, but really good.

I made this for 6, but used the full amounts of vegetables for 12 servings, and 6 tilapia fillets, which totaled slightly under 2 lb. But, the fish definitely does not need to cook for 40 minutes--10 to 15 was plenty. Good flavor and texture. I'll be doing this again.

I use another fish (preferable a wild caught) as recipe works well with any fish.

after reading the reviews it's very apparent you need to reduce the amount of fish and up the veggies.. i cut this down to 3 servings and used a little over a pound of tilapia.. i reduced the cayenne to 1/8 tsp and upped the bouillon to 4 tsp.. i used the following amounts for the veggies: 1/2 an onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1 red bell pepper, a large handful of baby carrots, 1 huge beefsteak tomato, a handful of olives, a little over a cup of kale, no garbanzos and cilantro for the parsley.. instead of cooking the fish on top i put it under the mixture.. i also didn't add water as there was enough liquid from the tomato.. about 10 minutes in i realized i forgot the olives so i added them and saw the fish was already done.. i wanted something more like a stew so i flaked the fish and stirred everything together.. i was going to make some kind of rice to serve it over but it already looked pretty hearty.. this tasted fine on it's own but i added chopped cilantro and a squirt of lemon over mine.. i don't think this will be a do over but it was fun to try something different

This is very delicious!! I'll be making this again. It would be especially good in winter since it gave me a perfectly warm& spicy feeling. I did put in 1tbsp less of the cumin & also the paprika & 1/2 the cayenne & only had a 1lb  package of tilapia. Since other reviewers added raisens I added about 1/3c dried apricots& plums. We are having it over rice but I also ate it just in a bowl. But it is a wonderful dish! My family will love it!

My fiance and I loved this dish -- especially he did and he's not a big fish fan.  I used what I had on hand which was about a pound of cod, so I cut the recipe down accordingly.

I also read reviews first and thus added more kick; I used Spanish smoked paprika. 

I also crumbled one dried small chili, one medium ancho chilli and cut up one  dried chipotle chili.  I also added one more olive.  Wow! What kick!  The smoky flavors of the paprika and the chipotle complemented everything and the flavor profile was awesome!  This is definitely a "do it again"!

Very good use of our Cod fish. I made this for our friends and they really enjoyed it. My wife felt it was a bit spicy which it was. Overall a good meal. I did reduce the paprika and cumin some. Next time I will add raisins for the additional sweetness and probably reduce the water to half veggie coverage. A very easy meal to prepare.

My husband and daughter don't like tomatoes so I omitted them but used chicken tomato bouillon instead of regular chicken to get that flavor. We all liked it, even the picky 2 1/2 year old.

BE AWARE...do not add much water if any. The veggies will add juices so very little water is needed. If you over add you will have a very bland dish. In fact I would wait till after adding fish and checking it later then adding some. The steam alone is making droplets.

Hi, I was searching for new recipe for tilapia and found this one. I did not have chick peas, olives and bell peppers but went ahead anyway. WOW. Excellent, even with the missing ingredients! This recipe is a keeper!

I used only to 2 pounds of fish for 4 people and it was still too much.  Also the flavor was bland. Would try this again with major overhaul.

Omigoodness, I thoroughly enjoyed the delicious flavors this dish has! I didn't have carrots or olives, but we could live without those ingredients. I used a can of whole tomatoes instead.  I love my food well seasoned so I added a few extra spices directly to the fish(adobo/season salt). This was superb and has now become a favorite in my recipe arsenal! Thank you for submitting this!

Good! The fish cooked perfectly using this method and the whole dish had a nice flavor, though I did choose to go a little lighter on the spices. I used fat free chicken broth in place of the water and bouillion. My only complaint was that the olives just didn't seem to work with all the other flavors. Still a very good dish though. Thanks for sharing! :)

Loved this!  I cut the fish and spices in 1/2 (5 lbs of tilapia seemed like way too much) and used the amount of veggies the recipe called for.  My husband and I loved this!

A simple and flavorful dish!  I added some pitted black moroccan olives, broccoli stems, and ras el hanout to taste.  The tilapi is wonderful and not too fishy.  I even had it for lunch the next day and it tasted just as good, which doesn't happen often with fish leftovers.

I took a slight shortcut. Figured that the onion and garlic would cook in the tomato mixture, I skipped sautéing them. This came out very good with lots of flavor. This recipe has a lot of spice flavor, so if you don't want it super hot, watch how much cayenne pepper you add.

Great recipe! Made it for company and they loved it. Of course, obligatory modifications: used caper berries instead of olives, 2 lbs of fresh halibut instead of tilapia, only used 3 tablespoons of cumin (same as paprika), used canned chopped tomatoes and chicken broth instead of water + bullion.

So so good.  I could not get enough of this dish.  And so easy to make.  What a way to pass as a great cook!  I did make some minor adjustments after reading  the reviews.  I only used 2 pounds of tilapia for 4 of us, but I used the same amount of vegetables that the recipe called for.  Because my family likes spicy, I used a can of Ro-tel hot diced tomatoes with habaneros in place of the tomatoes.  I served this over rice and it was amazing.

I love this recipe!  The fact that it came from a long handed-down family recipe made it the recipe to make.  My family loved it too.  I served it with large grain Israeli-style couscous.  And my husband can attest to it being even better the in the next days, because that’s when he happily finished the leftovers!  I’ll make it again this weekend!  Thank you!

This dish is wonderful,  full of flavor and a healthy dinner.  I cooked enough fish for 3 servings and used only 1 red pepper, not two.  I definitely will make this recipe again.

My husband and I really liked this. I used thawed frozen cod fillets that I pressed some of the liquid out of using paper towels. I found this recipe in the magazine, and there is an editors suggestion to remove the fish after 15-16 min, then reduce the liquid in the sauce until it is as thick as you want it. I did that and ended up with a thick and yummy sauce. I served each fillet over a pine nut couscous from a box (Near East) and spooned the veggie mixture over that. I reduced the cayenne by more than 2/3 and it was plenty spicy for us. I also reduced the cumin a little. I have to say the result I got was much more appealing to look at than the photos would lead you to believe.  I'm excited to make this again!
