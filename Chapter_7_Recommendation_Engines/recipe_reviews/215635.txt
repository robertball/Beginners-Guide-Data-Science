I love this recipe but I added more cilantro and a chopped and seeded tomato . The key to success is to use fruit that are firm but not overly ripe because otherwise the salsa is too juicy and therefore runny. I  use Italian tomatoes or remove the seeds and inner flesh from my garden tomatoes . I made it a second time and added some chopped, hot pepper.

Good but not wonderful. I added a small tomato, it could've used a little more sweetness.

I just served this at a party of 6 and they all loved it.  I omitted the cilantro, but everything else stayed the same.  It was loved by all!  Thanks ArizonaAmy

As written, this is pretty bland. However, adding a half of a jalapeño and a handful of diced red bell pepper takes it up to 5 stars.

It is an easy recipe. I would suggest not using the food processor, mine turned my mango to mush, but if I had just used a knife it would be a lot better. Lesson learned.
