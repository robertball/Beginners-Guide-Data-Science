Wow - this is really good! The Lasagna in the title has to go though! This is a Tex Mex dish without a smidgen of Italian. I softened the cream cheese to the extent that I just mixed all of the ingredients in a bowl, by hand, and it did fine. I don't have a lot of patience anyway to cut 16 oz of cream cheese into little pats. I also mixed the shredded cheese in but won't do this next time as it needs that color for a topping. One son wouldn't touch this because of its' "gastric" appearance. He missed out! I served this as a small meal in between a late Sunday breakfast and dinner. Be warned - this makes a TON! It really filled the entire 9 x 13 pan! This is very filling and rich and is to be served with sturdy chips.

As Rachel Ray would say...YUMM-O! I made this for a party, and it was scooped up quickly! I followed someone else's suggestion, and after layering the cream cheese, threw it in the oven for 5 mins to soften it up a bit, then spread it out, and THEN added the shredded cheese. This is definatly a make again!

I've made this tons of times and it is by far our favorite hot mexican dip. The cream cheese is a great touch and it's worth the effort to cut it up and not mix it in. It's easiest to cut if you put it in the freezer for 15 minutes and then cut with a cheese slicer. This dip does requires a sturdy chip. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a different Mexican dip. It will soon become your favorite as well.

Pretty good dip.  Needs more cream cheese and less meat and beans though.  That's just me, I like gooey cheesy.  I liked it for a change of pace from regular cheese dip.  It made enough I was able to make it on two different days.  The first day I layered it as directed.  The next day, I spread the cream cheese in a pie plate, then the meat and beans mixture, then cheese.  I really liked it best that way.  It just went together more smoothly.

We enjoyed this more the next day with hot sauce added. The cream cheese didn't melt and spread like I thought it would. The cheddar cheese looked hard. Will make again but with some changes. Salsa needs to be hot. Only 1 can of refried beans is necessary. Didn't feel the chili peppers added a thing. Will try cooking the beef with taco seasoning for added flavor. We like spice. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband likes this best without the cream cheese and cheddar cheese. I love it with both. However, I found it very difficult to spread the cream cheese on top (even if you do cut it up) and will just mix it in next time.

This was a good dip.  Tastes just like a bean burritto.  I did add a pkg of taco seasoning when mixing everything together. It needed a little something.  I sliced the cream cheese really thin because some reviews said the cream cheese didn't melt completely.

This was a good recipe, but could use a little more spice for my taste.  As other reviewers mentioned, this makes a large amount, filling a 13x9 pan almost to the top.

This is a great thing to make especially for the superbowl or guy parties, they love it! The only thing I did different is I added a packet of taco seasoning to the cream cheese mixture.

Wow!  This is awesome.  Super simple and relatively quick to prepare.  I even used this a couple nights later for a filling in tacos - YUMM!!

It does make a lot, so next time, I'm going to cut the recipe in half and make it in an 8x8 pan.  I think most of the guests thought it was a main dish and not a dip b/c it was so big and therefore didn't get eaten as much - even though it is super delicious!  The cream cheese makes it perfect.

If you want "kick" use jalepenos instead of chiles.  I agree with others bean/beef was bland needed some taco seasoning or something.  Liked the cream cheese I used 1 8oz plus 3 oz and that was plenty.  Not a keeper for me I much prefer the Clemons Family Bean Dip (on this site).

SO GOOD!! And easy! I used soy crumbles instead of meat, but other than that, I didn't change anything. I don't know why it's called lasagna either, but so delicious. I will make frequently.

This was so yummy!!  I made it this New Year's Eve night and the whole family loved it!  I had to use light red kidney beans in place of the refried because I didn't have the refried but it was still great!  I'll make it again and again!

The second time I made this I used Bob Evans hot sasuage.  After I layer the cream cheese on the top I put it in the oven for 5 minutes and then spread it and finally topped it with the 2 cups of cheddar.  Everyone was asking for this recipe.  I took home an empty dish!

Flippin' outstanding, though needs a little hot sauce.  I'm a mild food person, but it was not quite right without any kind of kick to it.  Once I added a little, it was heavenly!

This has great potential but I didn't find that it had a lot of taste.  Next time I try this I will had a spicier salsa plus some Mexican seasoning mix.

While this dip has all the ingredients that I love, it was lacking in taste.  Something more is needed to give it a kick, so I'll play around with it a little.  also, I think next time, I'll mix all the ingredients together and melt on the stove and then throw into a little crockpot.  I don't think the layering makes much difference and this way the cheeses will be distributed throughout rather than just on top.

I give this a 5 for high adaptability. I halved the recipe, added a couple tbsp of taco seasoning, some cayenne for kick, and left out the beans. I used veggie burger crumbles, but if you use regular meat you'd want the beans mixed in. Also, to make it lighter, I left out the cream cheese and put a thin layer of sour cream on top after it was done cooking, along with some shredded lettuce. I will definitely make this again, any number of ways.

This is a great dip.  I know Mexican lasagna doesn't seem like the right name, but after trying it(and without knowing the name) DH said, "This tastes like Mexican lasagna."  So maybe it's a perfect name after all.

This recipe was good, but I thought it needed a bit more flavor.  When I reheated the leftovers I added more salsa, and I liked it much more.  
Also, I thought that the cream cheese didn't really add to it at all, and it didn't melt very well in the amount of time that I had it in the oven, even after allowing it to bake longer than suggested.  Everyone else who ate it loved it as is, though, so maybe it just wasn't for me.

This was very tastey and even my little ones gobbled it up.  We used left over seasoned taco meat instead of plain brown ground and it was very good. Will make it again with seasoned taco meat. Cut the recipe in half for just my family, but would follow amounts if making for a large group.

I made this for the Cowboy game yesterday. I halved it & made it in an 8" cake pan. Left out the olives. Very good- hubby & son liked it too. Too bad Dallas lost!! Boohoo. I even bought "Cowboy" Tostitos!!!

I have made this recipe several times for potluck dinners and parties.  And everyone has raved over it.  Now, when we have a snack day or a party, everyone will request I make it. So good, you could eat as a meal. And what's so good about it is that it's not your typical dip. Thanks for a good recipe.

I made this for a church gathering and everyone absolutely loved it!  The only thing I changed was  I combined some sour cream with the cream cheese. Also, I poured some Rotel diced tomatoes on top after it came out of the oven.

I used a lb of faux meat crumbles and cooked them with the onion and two packets of McCormick's original taco seasoning. next time I'm going to mix in scallions and cook in the Crock-Pot sans the cheddar.

Just wanted to add my two cents.... I soften the cream cheese and smooth it out on the BOTTEM of the dish, then a can or two of Hormel chili (beef or just beans), a layer of diced tomatoes, lite layer of finely chopped red onion, lite layer of jalapeño , olives if you like them, I do not, then a good amount of whatever shredded cheese you like! Bake till bubbly , will be gone in a flash!!!!!       FYI , don't use no fat or lite cream cheese, it does not cook well at all, ends up looking like curdled milk, gross...

This was tasty; after reading some of the reviews, we added a pack of McCormick's taco seasoning to the meat as we sauteed it - also substituted mild jalapenos for the green chiles - just enough to give it a little kick. Great recipe for Super Bowl Sunday. We loved the addition of the cream cheese.

Good.  Cream cheese layer kind of stayed in little clumps and did not totally melt out.  Next time will soften the cream cheese and spread it for that layer instead of just placing slices.

I made this for our Superbowl party.  I halved the recipe because there was so much food already being served.  It was so filling!  Most people seemed to like it, but I personally thought it was a little bland.  I think it may have been everytime someone went to take some dip, they were blocking my view of the game!
