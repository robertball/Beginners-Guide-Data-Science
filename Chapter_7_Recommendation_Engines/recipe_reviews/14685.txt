SUPERB beef stew!  I took the great base recipe, and tweaked it with a compilation of reviewer recommendations.  The end result is a winner, to be sure.  Here is what I did (and I won't change a thing the next time I make it): 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt.  Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag.  Shake beef in bag to coat.  Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned.  Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften.  Transfer to slow cooker.  2.  Mix beef broth (I used Swanson's Certified Organic in aseptic carton) with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine.  Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker.  3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions:  increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning.  Your home will smell wonderful all day, and your meal will be a savory feast!  I served the stew in bowls, accompanied by slices of fresh, crusty bread.

I have been making this stew for almost 3 years and wanted to review it again.  Although I'm sure Corinne's suggestions are good, what I like most about this recipe is the simplicity of preparation...no browning the beef.  I've made this over a couple dozen times at least - doubled - and have never had leftovers.  It is a terrific recipe as written.

I made this stew for the first time using Corinne's suggestion.  The stew turned out great!  The next week, I made the stew following the exact recipe (minus the celery, since I didn't have any); and I must say that the stew turned out EVEN BETTER when following the exact recipe.  (Also, I didn't have as many dishes to wash.)  This stew is SO DELICIOUS.  Next time I make this you can bet I will follow the recipe EXACTLY AS WRITTEN.

I don't understand why Corrine doesn't just post her own recipe for beef stew.  The point is to review the given recipe, not list a million changes to it.  This stew is perfect AS WRITTEN.  If you make any changes, you are not making this recipe for beef stew!!!!

THIS is a terrific basic recipe!!  Nothing to stop you from adding your favorite things - although the TASTE is GREAT just like it is.  I used chuck because it's not as dry as a bottom round.  I had a tomato so I chopped it up & added it.  I saw where someone had added an envelope of beef gravy - great idea too!!!  Thank goodness there's people out there REALLY KNOW HOW TO COOK!!  Oh, and don't bother to brown the beef the way some recipes state - it only makes the beef dry.  Thanks for this recipe.

An excellent and easy stew recipe. I make minimal changes (I like parsnips, so I add three chopped in place of celery, and I add a little more broth because I like more gravy), but that's about it. This is one of those easy, homey, stick-to-your-ribs recipes. Some of the reviews tick me off: Yes, it's a "regular" stew recipe because it is, after all, STEW. And all the changes that other reviewers make? Don't say "I made this recipe, but I changed EVERYTHING about it." You aren't doing this recipe justice.. heck, you aren't doing THIS recipe at all. I'm as guilty of changing recipes to suit my tastes and pantry as much as anyone, but at least tell us that you've made the original recipe as written before doing your million-and-one changes! Thanks for sharing this tasty-as-written recipe, Buchko!

I made similar adjustments to previous raters.  I dredged the beef in flour/salt/pepper and pan friend until browned in olive oil before adding to the slow cooker.  Then I added some butter and onion to the pan and cooked until softened. Next I deglazed the pan with some of the broth being sure to  scrape up the yummy bits. In total I used 2 10 oz cans of beef broth.  I added 10 oz. sliced button mushrooms. Used almost 2T worchestershire sauce, added a bunch of extra herbs and finally thickened with cornstarch.  It was perfect.

I followed Corinnes suggestions and this came out fantastic! The flavor and cosistency were wonderful, and just as good the next day. 
So you dont have to search for it, here is her suggestion: 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning.

I have this exact recipe in the recipe booklet that came with my slow cooker! I make it all of the time and my family loves it. I use a packet of dry onion soup mix in place of all the spices, only because it's an easy and convenient way to toss it together.

The comments about tweaking the recipe, such as browning the meat first and deglazing (not even sure what that is) are nice, but the basic recipe worked out very well for someone who doesn't have time to cook. I like that the recipe is simple for those of us who only have 20 minutes in the morning to throw things in the cooker before running off to work and want to come home to a nice, hot homemade meal. The stew turned out very well and was tasty. I'm not a chef and don't claim to be, which is why I turn to this site for finding recipes like this that are quick to prepare and taste good with a minimal amount of work. This stew does the trick- I have it with some fresh crusty bread  that I pick up on the way home and it makes a satisfying meal for my husband and I after a long day's work.

Excellent!  VERY thick stew, so if you like a little bit of juice, increase the water.  I used inside round sirloin marinating beef (didn't have stewing beef on hand, and this is leaner than stewing beef).  I added an extra 1/2 cup of water, an extra celery stalk, frozen peas (during the last hour of cooking) and more potatoes to ensure that it was filling enough for four hungry adults.  It was polished off!  Double this recipe if you have more than four adults, or if you want some leftovers.  I served it with Maritime brown bread and cheese - yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great start for my tweeking, which I always seem to do! With no changes it still would have been at least 4 stars, it just needed some extra flavors.  First added a little more veggies substituting red potatoes. I dredged the meat in flour, salt & pepper, then pan fried in a little olive oil for only 5 minutes just until brown on all sides.  Removed the meat to the crock pot and deglazed the pan with beef broth and some red wine.  Added in some Mc Cormicks stew seasoning, rosemary, thyme and parsely. Increased the Worchestire sauce to 1 T. Then about an hour before done (about 11 hours) added a C. of fresh mushrooms.  This turned out great!  Perfectly thick for pouring over some mashed potatoes.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This just tasted like regular old beef stew to me.  Nothing unusual or great about it.  My fiance said there was too much meat and not enough vegetables.  I'll keep searching for another recipes.  I think this would've benefited from a 1/2 c. red wine.

This is a great beef stew recipe (as written). It's easy, doesn't make a lot of dishes, makes the house smell amazing, and my family loves it! I contemplated adding a thing or two the second time I made it, but I decided it was unnecessary. The flavors are great just using the base recipe. And really, why make more work for yourself by adding steps that aren't needed. Try this recipe as-is the first time you make it! You'll save yourself some work and I don't think you'll be disappointed.

I do have to say that it seems strange to me that people would give a recipe a 5 star rating, but they changed it so much that it's not the same recipe any more. It helps to rate the recipe as it's written. Not to mention that you should at least try it the way it's written before making all kinds of changes. As someone who's pretty new to the site, it makes it harder to find good recipes. Just my two cents.

YUM!!! I made just a few minor changes to the original recipe and it turned out incredibly delicious!... First off, there's no need to brown the meat first like some reviewers suggested. I just dumped the raw meat into the crockpot and added the flour and pepper and I also added a packet of McCormick Beef Stew Seasoning Mix (I didn't add the salt)... Then I poured in one 14.5 oz can of beef broth, mixed it up really well, and added all the other ingredients exactly as listed (minus the 1 1/2 cups beef broth, of course)... In addition, I also added a tablespoon or so of chopped fresh parsley and a little more of the carrots, potatoes and celery than what the recipe called for, as it didn't look like there were enough veggies in relation to the meat. I used baby carrots and small honey gold potatoes, cut in half... I cooked the stew on high for 6 hours, stirring it every hour or so, and it came out PERFECT! It was very flavorful and just the right consistency. Definitely my favorite beef stew recipe EVER, and it was sooooo easy to make!

I'm one of those guys who is a freakin disaster in the kitchen, but I can cut veggies without whacking off a finger and I have a slow cooker. I've been making this stew for a year now and it's my go-to meal to throw together on a Saturday morning so I can enjoy it all week long.

the review that called for adding mcormack's beef stew seasoning packet is making this less healthy because of the sodium content. Adding other spices, herbs and seasalt would be a much better choice.

This beef stew was EXCELLENT when prepared EXACTLY as written. I'm sure those people who leave lengthy reviews describing how they tweaked the recipe have the best of intentions, instead of wasting review space, perhaps they should submit their own recipe separately. Unless there is an inherent flaw in the recipe, I think it's rude to rework the recipe - ESPECIALLY if that same person gives it four or five stars! Submit your own recipes and leave these poor people alone!

Stew to die for!!! I used so many of other reviewers' suggestion-too many to mention, which turned out the most scrumptious stew I've ever made. Key improvements that made it great: Brown the floured beef first, use 3 c. beef broth or water/ water/bouillon combo, add Lawry's Beef Stew packet, add 1 cup frozen peas about 10-15 min. before finishing cooking. Prior to finding this recipe, I used only Lawry's Beef Stew packet, following the printed recipe. This recipe (with the tweaks) is soooooo much better.

Very good.  I have been making this same basic recipe for around 15 years. The only thing that is different about my recipe is that it asks for more salt (1½ tsp), and only ¼ tsp of pepper. I also carefully stir in cooked peas at the very end before serving. And I am telling you, if you can refrain from eating it the first day, it is much better the second day!!!  And if you like the consistency to be thicker, you can thicken it with a basic roux. After cooking the stew, remove all food and leave the broth in the slow cooker and turn the cooker to high. In a separate pan, melt and cook 3 Tablespoons butter and 3 Tablespoons flour for around 5 min. Add this roux to the broth in the slow cooker and whisk it until you like the consistency. Add the food back into the slow cooker and enjoy.

This was a good and flavorful stew; however, I like mine with more broth.  So, next time I will add enough beef broth to cover the food.

My husband is a picky eater and I did not have all the ingredients on hand, so here are the changes I made:  1 tsp of garlic powder (replacing minced garlic), no bay leaf, 1 tsp onion powder (replacing chopped onion) 2 cans beef broth (added a can of water as well, this helped make more base to the sauce), added about 1 cup baby carrots (replacing diced carrots), omitted celery, and added about 1 tsp or so of pepper.  These are just my personal changes, but the stew would be just as as good as the orginal recipe.

I made this at about 8 o'clock the night before...Our slow cooker has 3 settings - 'Keep Warm', 'Low' and 'High'.  'Low' is usually too high, so I turned it on 'Keep Warm' until about 7AM.  I found that the stew was not thickening up well and the beef was still pink, so I added about 1/3 cup Veloutine and turned it up to 'Low' and just prayed it wouldn't burn!

We turned it down to 'Keep Warm' again at 3PM and by dinner time it was absolutely perfect!  Two men and myself ate almost the whole pot (we all went back for seconds)!!!

Definately a keeper, 5 stars!!!  Great with biscuits!

Very average tasting.  I could have bought a big can of Dinty Moore Beef Stew, liked it more, and saved a few bucks.  I followed the recipe as well as I could.  I had to double the beef broth because it had nearly dried up after about 3 hours on high.  Actually it was completely done after three hours on high for me - maybe my slow cooker has some turbo switch I didn't know about.  The meat does not need browned prior to placing in the slow cooker as some people have reported doing - it comes out as tender as possible.  The problem I had was with the flavor just being bland as some others have reported.  I will probably try again but will most likely add the beef stew seasoning pack others have recommended, and will do maybe two hours on high and two hours on low.  I would listen to those who put in the extra seasoning pack (McCormick's, I believe).  Good luck!

So simple and so good. I only had about 20 minutes before I needed to run out the door when I opened the fridge and saw the stew meat.  A few clicks later I found this recipe and was so glad to see that I didn't need to take the time to brown the meat.  Dumped the flour, salt, pepper and garlic in a large ziplock baggie, tossed in the meat, poured it into the cooker. chopped up the veggies added the remaining ingredients and off I went.  With time to hunt for my shoes and car keys.  Thanks for such an easy and very tasty recipe.  How wonderful to  have a quick clean-up, too.    I did add a bit of extra beef broth as I like my stew a little thinner, but that is just a personal preference.

This is the exact recipe I have been using for 20 some years, with only one other ingredient...a TBS of Gravy Master or Kitchen Bouquet just to darken the gravy and make it pretty!! I have never had complaints..but always have gotten raves!!! Enjoy!

Sometimes adding wine too early in a recipe can leave a sour taste with the finished product. Many times I will add wine 1/2 to 45 minutes prior to the end of cooking. I avoid grocery store wines altogether (as they contain a ton of sodium and taste awful) and I never use a wine for cooking that I wouldn't drink. :) De-glazing pans with wine is a good idea for recipes that cook on the stove top for shorter amounts of time. Other ideas for this recipe: Always tenderize stew meat (pound cubes) and then shake them in seasoned flour before browning them. Tenderizing really does make a difference in tenderness.  I never used to brown my meat so as to "save time".  I realized, after browning my meat first, that I will NEVER skip this step again as the taste differential is very noticeable. The only other recommendation that I would make is more garlic and a couple of bay leaves (remove prior to serving).  The house smells wonderful when I make this recipe. Such a great comfort food for a cold winter's day!

Excellent, easy recipe.  But the reviews were my favorite part.  A little personal change is great but changing the entire recipe and the superior attitude reviews are so annoying to me.  Glad people are speaking up.

I have made this twice now.  First time, I made it as is, with the exception of adding a little extra broth.  The second time I had made it, I used 2 cans of Campbell's condensed beef broth.  One half hour before serving, I combined two tablespoons each of burgundy wine and Worcestershire sauce with one tablespoon of flour, and then poured it into the stew.  Stew thickened up quite nicely and was very flavorful.  Will be making it again and again as fall and winter approach.

This beef stew recipe is delicious & easy. I doubled up on the recipe because I have a large family and everyone LOVED it. I ended up putting the flour mixture in a ziploc bag and added the meat to that and shook really well until everything was evenly coated and then put it in the crockpot. I also added frozen sweet peas to the recipe and it was perfect. This is the first time I made beef stew that everyone in my house enjoyed. What a great recipe!! If you are looking for a great beef stew recipe, you should pick this one...

EXCELLENT & DELICIOUS.  I had only 1 lb stew meat which I cut into 1" cubes. Followed all other instructions.  My slow cooker is 'large' so I adjusted recipe for 2 plus extras for leftover: I used 2 cups left over corn beef broth, plus 1 can low sodium beef broth; 3 med red potatoes, cubed; 1/2 lb peeled baby carrots; 1 4oz can button mushrooms; 1 cup frozen peas. Cooked on high for 3 hrs, then low for 2 hr: total 5 hrs. 10 to 12 hrs is WAY TOO long for this recipe.   I added the mushrooms & peas the last 1/2 hr of cooking; then thicken liquid with 1 Tbl flour & broth. Switched cooker to 'warm' till ready for dinner.  New cookers power are higher than the old ones so food cooks a lot faster and more evenly.  Meat was tender, and veggies were perfect. Reviewers that state their meat was not tender, or that veggies were overcooked should check with the mfg of their cooker.  I was informed by my mfgr that the UL CODE was changed to cook at higher temperatures to insure that foods were cooked thoroughly to prevent bacteria or food poisoning.  That was good to know because you have to learn NOT to overcook, and come home to a burned meal.  I suggest that you check with your mfgr for the correct cooking times.  All cookers are not alike.

I tried this recipe due to the 4 1/2 out of 5 stars based on 499 reviews so I figured it must be good. I didn't have time to read the reviews when I printed it, but I should have. This recipe was just bland & blah. We added extra beef broth, 2 packets lipton onion soup mix, 2 cups water, some extra salt, extra vegetables, a rue to help thicken it a little, put it over white rice w/ butter & it was still just blah. After reading the reviews, it seems that most everyone had to tweak this recipe so I can't figure out why it had such a high star rating on the yummy factor. If reviewing this recipe on it's own merits without all the extra's needed, don't waste your time & money on the ingredients unless your're looking for a recipe to doctor up on your own. I recommend finding a different one.

So amazing! I definetly would not waste time searing the beef. I used to be fully beleive in searing the outside first, but after making it without, i realized the falvour is just as good and the beef is alot more tender, plus it takes way less time and less dishes! I added a pack of Club House stew seasoning and a little more salt when it was done. Wonderful.

Very good. I was a bit surprised because there didn't seem to be enough liquid. I thought for sure I was going to have to add more broth but I decided to wait and see what happened. Sure enough, the juices from the meat provided just enough liquid. Great recipe!

I loved the simplicity of this recipe - I did follow the recipe, with no extra steps to brown the meat.  It was delicious!  everyone needs a few good throw-and-go recipes for the crock pot, and this is definitely one of my new favorites.

Don't look at any other beef stew recipies. This is Awesome ! This is the beef stew recipe that I will continue to use forever. I used a bottom roast that I cut up into 1.5" cubes myself. Total cooking time was 5 hours on high. I did follow the changes that a reviewer named Corinne made and I highly recommend that you do too. They are as follows... 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth (I used Swanson's Certified Organic in aseptic carton) with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning.  Thanks for the additions Corinne.

This recipe does not need another glowing review, but it was good enough that it deserves one! While in reality, this is a good old, basic beef stew recipe, the beauty is in the cooking method - the crock pot AND that it does not call for browning the meat before slow cooking. While I don't add or subtract ingredients from this recipe, I do modify the ones that are there a little bit. I up the Worcestershire to 1 tablespoon and I use two to three cloves of garlic (just love that stuff!). I also dredge the meat in either flour (or corn starch sometimes) before placing in crock pot (I just think it is a bit easier this way, so just personal preference, no right or wrong way here). And because I adore cooked celery, I often add three stalks or so. So you see, no real changing of the recipe, just the amounts of some things to suit my family's tastes. Make exactly as is and you won't be disappointed - tweak it a bit to suit you and your family and you have a stellar recipe in your repertoire!

This is a great beef stew recipe! I didn't add anything or change a thing to this recipe.  Do yourself a favor - don't "doctor this up" until you try it as is.  If you don't like it (which you will) then play with it!

I've made this several ways. The first time I made it as Corinne suggested. It was a lot of extra work and I don't like salt. I don't recommend her way. The second time I made it, I made it as is. It was very, VERY good. My problem though was the amount of salt. Again, I don't like salt. The next time I made it, the third time, I eliminated the salt altogether. Because I do this, I usually have to add a couple of things to make up for it and in this case I did not. Needless to say, it was a bit bland. The fourth time I made it, I had great success! Again, I eliminated the salt. I added 2 tsp of sodium free beef bouillon powder, 1 tsp of onion powder, about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, a pinch of rosemary and 3 cloves of minced garlic. This one was a keeper. If you like salt, then the original recipe will is perfect. If not, then this last way may be something you'll enjoy. What is great about the original recipe and this last way is how easy and low mess it is. There is no reason to brown the meat in advance and this way the meat came out incredibly tender. Thanks for sharing this recipe! Our family loves it.

This was delicious. I've made this numerous times "as is" and it's perfect. I've also made it several times using Corinne's suggestions and it too is fantastic. Honestly, for me, it depends when I'm making it. If I'm throwing it together before work I do the easy "as is" version. If I have extra time I do Corinne's. While the two do taste different, they are both delicious in their own way. Definitely a keeper!

I made this 2 days in a row. My family thoroughly enjoyed this. The only thing I did the 2nd time around was spray non-stick cooking spray in the crock before adding ingredients and mixed the stew meat and flour mixture in a seperate bowl and let it sit a few minutes to have the flour mixture ahear to the meat so that it didn't stick to the bottom of the crock while cooking. Other then that I did followed to a T both times. I cooked at low temp all day but I did prepare it at 4:30 in the morning and we at it 7 in the evening, so the meat was extra soft. We liked it very much.

I took the great base recipe, and tweaked it with a compilation of reviewer recommendations. The end result is a winner, to be sure. Here is what I did (and I won't change a thing the next time I make it): 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into a zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth  with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning. Your home will smell wonderful all day, and your meal will be a savory feast! I served the stew in bowls, accompanied by slices of fresh, crusty bread.

My husband loves beefstew and I don't make it, so I used this recipe last night and it was FANTASTIC.  After reading others' reviews I decided to brown my meat in 1/4c of olive oil and deglaze the pan with 1/4c of sherry, 1/4c water & remaining flour.  I added this sauce to the crockpot with all the other ingredients.  I also added 1 can of tomato sauce for coloring.  It was so good we ate beefstew for breakfast this morning.  Thanks for such a simple recipe.

I love this recipe as is. It's also SUPER easy to tweak. The only thing I would say (because of some of the other recommendations here) is DO NOT brown the beef first, it just ends up dry and tough. I tried quite a few different recipes that called for browning the beef first and the first time I made it with THIS recipe the beef just falls apart so soft and tender. Seriously just try it this way at least once. It's amazing.

This beef stew also does really well with mushrooms added, my husband loves mushrooms. I also add quite a bit more worcestershire because I love it. But every time I make beef stew I do this basic recipe and then add whatever I want and it always turns out great.

Soooooo good.  Definitely do NOT need to go all crazy with browning meat, and DO cook on Low for the longer time period instead of trying to speed things up by putting it on High.  I made it both ways, and while I still enjoyed it when I put it on high, it made a difference in the meat texture and turned out perfectly when I cooked on low, as suggested.  I like mine to have more broth, so I made sure my ingredients were covered in beef broth (about 5 or 6 cups I think).  I added a glug of red wine, 1/4 tsp salt straight into the broth (in addition to the 1/2 tsp mixed into the flour already), and I put in 1.5 - 2 tablespoons of soy sauce instead of the worcestershire sauce (I made this recipe gluten free with gluten free soy sauce and gluten free flour).  Use red potatoes because they won't turn mushy on you.  It's the simple flavors of this recipe, cooked to perfection, that make this a great recipe.  It's like your grandma's best, classic Beef Stew. Definitely going to be a staple in my house.

Excellent as is. I also add 1/2 pack of onion soup mix, a tsp of dried thyme, mushrooms, and frozen peas. Perfect with warm crusty bread. The most recent time I made this, I quadrupled the recipe and froze 3 portions in large freezer bags and made the 4th in the slow cooker. For the frozen meals, I just marked how long to cook on the bag before filling. When I wanted to make the stew, I would thaw it in the fridge overnight so that the next day I could just pop it in the slow cooker.

I knew this was a good starting point.  What I did differently was coat the meat with the flour, salt and pepper and then fry it in dijon mustard flavored oil.  I put the potatoes, carrots, celery and onion on the bottom of the crock to be sure they would cook completely and put the meat over it.  I didn't have any beef broth so I took the trimmings from the meat cubes and boiled them for a few minutes along with a package of onion soup mix.  Remove the meat scraps since they're just stringy, and pour the resulting broth over contents in the crock after sprinkling with paprika and adding the worcestershire sauce, garlic and bay leaves (yes, more than one leaf).  No need to stir.  Then, about a half hour before it's done, add a can of stewed tomatoes, some mushrooms and about a cup of frozen peas.  Okay, now you can stir.  If it's too juicy for you, just do the corn starch/water mix and add it.  I made two batches, one in a 3.5 qt. crock pot and one in a 5 qt. slow cooker.   Both were done in about 4 hours on high doing it this way.  Bon apetit.

I have to agree with susanna's review. I hope I don't offend anyone when I write this: I know we all "tweak" sometimes - like I added 3 tablespoons of tomato paste and extra veggies and broth, but to change the recipe THAT much is to not make this recipe. Beef stew is supposed to be simple and great tasting - this recipe is both as it is written. As a busy mom of 3 kids, it is perfect. I will say I tried beef stew with red wine and my kids hardly touched it - it took away from the true taste of the stew. If you want beef stew like you had as a kid, this is it. The simplicity and reminder of home make this a 5 star recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

So easy! I followed the recipe exactly and let it cook all day when I was at work. I only made half. Next time I'll use a full cup of broth instead of 3/4 cup - all the liquid was sucked up by the time I got home.

Despite owning two crock pots, I don't have a lot of experience with them.  That may change, thanks to this recipe.  The stew was delicious!  The only things I measured were the flour and broth; just guessed at everything else.  Toward the end, I added cornstarch mixed with water just to thicken it up a bit, but followed the recipe to about 98% otherwise.  (Don't like bay leaf, added more broth, added pepper to my serving.)  Hubby had two bowls and our super-finicky youngest said, "Good dinner, Mom."  Whoa!

A very savory stew with NO leftovers!  My whole family gave it "two thumbs up".  Personally, I would cook this stew NO LESS than 12 hours on the low setting.  The meat was "fork tender".  I did scale the recipe to yield 8 servings, evenly browned the floured meat 1st in margarine, then transferred it over to the crock pot.  I also included 2 cups of water and 2 cups of beef stock for a heartier flavor and more gravy in the stew.  Additionally, I used a TBLS more of Worcestershire Sauce, (1) TBLS of Lawry's Seasoned Salt, 1 tsp. of sugar and more black pepper to taste.  Lastly, I blended 3 TBLS each of real butter and flour and "whisked" it into the stew w/a fork the last 2 hours of cooking time, to thicken the gravy.  Absolutely delicious with either crusty bread or hot, buttered cornbread fresh out the oven.  Next time, I'll add frozen peas the last hour or so.  Overall, this one will definitely remain in my recipe file.  I plan to make this stew again real soon!

This stew was pretty bland on it's own. I added a packet of beef stew seasoning at the end of cooking and it made a world of difference!

the point of this stew is the convenience and speed in which you can get it ready. if I want something quick, I do not dredge and brown and tweak, I put it in the slowcooker and turn it on. voila, something quick and delicious without making it a cecil b demille.

I'm a rookie to a slow cooker so I always research recipes before I make something. I found this recipe today and thought it seemed too easy to be good.... But figured I would try it and make it exactly as written except I added 1/4 cup of red wine. What a surprise. It is the best beef stew I've ever made! Cooked it for 4 hours on high and it was done to perfection! No browning and no sautéing vegetables....easy breezy. Definitely give it a try!

Great! If you like VERY meaty stew, this is the recipe for you!  I like a little more of a balance between meat and veggies so I add 6 carrots, 2 large russet potatoes, and 3 stalks of celery. I double the garlic and use an extra cup of beef broth. No need to brown the meat or saute the onions 1st, it's a slow cooker recipe! The meat is going to be fall apart succulent anyway you do it.  Also don't add red wine...it adds a sour flavour to it that's just off.  I served it with a dollop of cream cheese on top (if you have not tried this DO...you'll never eat beef stew again without it) and crusty bread  Thanx Buchko!

I made this beef stew exactly as written, even though it just felt "wrong" not to brown the stew meat first.  However, I wanted to give the recipe a fair chance.  Bottom line is, it was great.  My husband loved it, I loved it, and this will go in the regular lineup for meals this fall and winter.  It's a winner.

OMG.  This stew was so awesome and SO easy!  Left it on for my bf to come home to and he ate almost half the pot by himself lol.  Followed the recipe instructions and all ingredients...i just added a half cup of wine.  i think the wine gave it good flavor, just next time i think im going to just use like a 1/3 cup instead.

I made this exactly as the recipe says except that I only had 1.5lbs of beef. Also, I used reduced sodium beef broth and added frozen green peas in the last hour of cooking. Came out great! Husband loved it and I enjoyed it as well. But it felt like there was something missing...I can't put my finger on it :(

Good, hearty stew, wonderful for a chilly night! I made a mountain of it so that I'd have plenty to freeze for another dinner, but truth be told, we nearly finished it all! Small changes (FTW) - shook the cubed meat in a large zip-lock w/ flour, paprika, s&p) then browned it. Deglazed pan w/ sherry. Added to the crock pot, in addition to the potatoes, carrots, onion, and celery, 2 c. frozen mixed veggies, along w/ some bell pepper. Sopped up all the stew-ey goodness w/ hunks of cornbread and our bellies were very happy indeed.

This was excellent--I did put the flour mixture into a ziplock bag and coated the meat first; saute the beef quickly with onion until brown and then threw it into the crock pot. I also added more garlic and I used a packet of McCormicks beef stew mix.

The original recipe isn't bad, but with some alterations it can be superb! 1/2 C red wine gives it flavor, and increase the flour to 1/3 C to compensate for the extra liquid. Use at least a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and two each bay leaves and garlic cloves. We halved the onion and added a jar of those small "Holland-style" onions, but the veggies are flexible. Make sure to be bold with the flavoring, though! Delicious with crusty bread.

I seasoned the meat with S&P and coated with flour, then browned it on the stovetop before adding it to the slow cooker.  Topped it with onion & garlic, then added all the chopped veggies.  I then mixed together the broth, some red wine (about a 1/2 cup or so) and a packet of beef stew seasoning mix and poured it over the top.  Added 1 bay leaf & let it go.  It was ready in about 4 hours on the high setting.  Pure comfort food!

Mislead by other reviews. Stick with this recipe as is. DO NOT add McCormick seasoning!!!! You will ruin this recipe.

EXCELLENT!!  I followed the recipe with Corinne's recommendations from 10/10/06.  She said to increase flour to 1/3 cup.  I also added Morton's Nature's Seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker.  I mixed 1/2 cup of the broth with some Swanson's concentrated broth jellies (2 of them) and the worcestershire sauce and deglazed the pan.  I poured that into the slow cooker and added the remaining 1 cup of beef broth.  Add the remaining ingredients (I also added fresh green beans because I had them on hand).  Increased the garlic to 2 cloves minced.  I mixed everything in the crock pot and let it go on high for 4 hours.  The meat was amazingly tender and the veggies were flavorful.  The browning of the meat makes all the difference.  This is a keeper!

I agree with Corinne, This was a good base to start from as with all recipes they do not have to be followed to the letter. I agree with the browning as otherwise the meat looks kinda boiled and a little pale and adds alot of xtra flavour. I added my own variation of veg such as rutabegas, carrots, corn, potatoes and carrots as well as the onion and xtra garlic. The packet of seasoning really helps. This was very simple and will def make again mmmm :)

This is a good basic recipe.  I made it as is except I put about 1/4 c red wine in.  I think next time I will dust the meat with the flour and salt and pepper mixture and brown it and maybe add some thyme or rosemary.  It's pretty good as is though.  I cooked on high for 6 hours and the meat was fall apart tender.

4 stars because I had to almost triple the amount of broth to get the amount of gravy I wanted. Added about 2 tbs of corn starch at the end to make a nice rich thick gravy. I also used seasoned salt instead or regular salt. Also, used 1 extra potato.  Next time, I will add more celery than what it called for-I wish there was more.  My DH said it was "really really good". Enough said. =)

My husband said this is the BEST stew I have ever made.  Even 4 stew skeptics (kids under the age of 9) devoured it.  I also floured the beef, using top sirloin, not stewing beef, browned in a bit of oil and butter, then put them to the side and sauteed onions, adding carrots, then celery, then garlic in that order (leaving a 2 minute gap between each addition), also deglazed with red wine, then threw everything into the crock pot.  I put it in the fridge then pulled it out in the morning and put it on before I left for work.  I think the top sirloin is way better than the stewing beef, came out extremely tender and not dry at all.  Also, I diced the celery so it pretty much dissolved into the stew, without being mushy or anything but you still got the flavour of it.

STOP RIGHT HERE! THIS IS A TERRIFIC BEEF STEW RECIPE WITH THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER REVIEWER'S (CORINNE) TWEAKS. IN ADDITION TO CORINNE'S TWEAKS, I ADDED THE FOLLOWING: ADDED MORE POTATOES/CARROTS AND MORE LIQUID (BROTH & WINE), JUST A PERSONAL CHOICE. SERVE IT IN A BREAD BOWL (PANERRA'S CARRY THEM). YOU'LL EAT THE STEW AND THE BOWL!! RAVE REVIEWS FROM MY FAMILY AND MY COOKING CLUB. ENJOY!

Just made this on a -10 degree day here in Maine. It is so easy and so good. I added more carrot and potato because my son doesn't like celery. i added a tablespoon on tomato paste and otherwise as written. no need to brown meat, it adds work and isn't necessary. Thank you so much for the recipe. I always look for 4 and a half stars ratings and this deserves it!

This was great exactly as is.  I was nervous not to cook the beef first, but it was fork tender and the stew had a nice brown color to it.  I'd definitely make this again.  No adjustments made other than adding an extra potato.

I don't think I'll ever brown stew meat again.  I have never omitted this step before but I decided to follow this recipe and was pleasantly surprised. I left out the onions and garlic as I was short on time and it was still delicious.

I love this as a base recipe.  I follow some of the other reviewers suggestions of adding things like dry onion soup mix.  I also usually change it up to put in whatever vegetables I want at the time or have on hand.  I LOVE putting sweet potatoes in and hominy.  Good stuff.  Don't be put off by the picture-this stew looks disgusting in the pic if you ask me!

The nice thing about this stew is that I could put it in the slow cooker and not think about it until dinner time.  The stew itself tasted fine, but it had no special characteristics beyond that. It tasted like every other stew I have made.  So it gets 4 stars for being easy.

Stew is one of those recipes that just keeps growing until you find out it is too much to safely fit your slow cooker.  I baked everything for 3 1/2 hours (covered) at 375.  I added onion and corn to the recipe.  Pretty tasty stew.

I took the advice of other reviewers:  At the beginning, I added a package of gravy mix mixed with a cup of water, and tripled the amount of garlic.  With about an hour to go, I added a can of italian stewed tomatoes, a can of corn, a can of peas, and some sliced fresh mushrooms.  I did try to thicken it a bit with some cornstarch (for the first time ever -- but I think it worked!).  This was delicious -- we ate it over rice, with grated mozzarella cheese on top!  I added the cheese because I thought the pepper was a little too strong.  Next time, I'll put in less pepper and paprika, but everything else I'll do the same.

This is an excellent stew!  The flavour was great and b/c I cooked it on low for 10 hours the meat was soooo tender.  The only problem is there's never any left for left-overs!  The only thing I changed was that I pre-cooked the potatoes.  Next time I'll double the recipe.

Very good and husband liked it.  I thought it was a little over cooked although we cooked it for 7.5 hours and then to warm, but I think it's my slow cooker.  Next time I'll add more seasonings and more liquid as we like our stew a little saucy, especially next day.

This is the best stew recipe I've tried (and there were many tries)! My husband raved about it, all the kids gobbled it up in record time. I do want to say that there is no need to brown the beef before putting it in the slow cooker. In fact, it adds nothing at all to the taste or the tenderness. What it does add is more fat and calories. I wouldn't have thought that the best stew recipe on this site would have been the easiest, but the fact that you don't have to brown anything before putting it in the slow cooker is the beauty of this easy to make dish.

Preparing for the Frankenstorm to hit East Coast, I made this slow cooker beef stew last night. I didn't have beef broth so I used chicken broth and I didn't have enough Worcestershire sauce but the flavor is delish. I wanted a simple straight forward beef stew and this is it. I like to brown my meat first to give that extra flavor. This is a definite keeper.Serve with white rice and you are set.

We made this for dinner last night - following the directions exactly and the end result was decent beef stew - but in no way will it replace my regular recipe (done in the oven over the hours of hours).

This is the first stew I have ever made. It came out good and turned out excellent the  next day (even the day after that). I took other reviewers suggestions and seared the flour coated meat and added red wine. I didn't have worcestershire so I omitted it - will try it the next time.

This recipe was very good.  I would wait to add the potatoes since they get mushy when you cook them for so long.  I love soft carrots though so I added them right away.

I used all the ingredients listed with the exception of bay leaves because I didn't have any.  I really did consider using Corrinne's suggestions but figured I'd stick to the recipe as much as I could.  I was worried that this wouldn't turn out.  It was just okay.  It was definitely nothing to rave about and, in my opinion, is not worthy of the high rating it has.  Not as written, at least.  I seasoned the stew to my taste because it didn't have enough flavor.  I also added garlic powder, onion powder, and diced canned tomatoes.  After I added more spices and sampled a spoonful it tasted better.  But, I was very disappointed with the finished product because the stew meat was WAY too lean.  I mean, it was tender because I let this cook on low for about 10.5 or 11 hours, and the texture of the meat was just plain dry!  There was no "richness" to it.  Something told me to use the chuck roast instead, because it has fat throughout the meat, which would have provided a juicier, richer, flavor ... but I wanted to follow this recipe for the most part.  Big mistake.  So, while it was etable and not as bad and other people said it was, it just wasn't desirable and I will never make this again.

Very good!  I used only one lb. of meat and more carrots and potatoes and added a little extra Worcestershire sauce.  Cooked on high for 5 hours and it turned out great.

made this yesterday. very good stew. the best i have made. i tweaked it a bit. i mixed the flour and spices in a ziploc. put the meat in and coated it. then browned it a few minutes in a skillet. then i put it in crockpot and added other ingredients.. i added an extra bayleaf, extra salt and pepper, an extra teaspoon of worcestershire, alot of extra veggies, and an extra cup of broth. was delicious. i think it is great too start with and adjust it to your taste. this is a definite keeper.

Honestly, this was just blah. It tasted like beef with veggies. The seasoning was just not enough. It needed more, more, more. We use organic everything and I season with a liberal hand, but this recipe will not be hanging around.

This is an excellent 'base' recipe. i did like some others, and browned the meat before assembling in the crockpot. I also added some quartered mushrooms(baby belles), and more beef stock. I"ve never done stew in a crockpot before, it came out amazing!!!!

This makes a good crock pot stew.  I used 1 1/2 lbs. of beef because that is all I had, and it was plenty.   I will use that amount from now on.  I did brown the meat first, then sprinkled with the flour, etc. according to the directions.  I will ease up on the salt next time, as it was just a tad salty.  Thanks!

This is a very good slow cooker beef stew.  I floured the beef and browned it in olive oil before adding it to the slow cooker.  I then deglazed the pan with the beef broth and added that in for extra flavor.  In addition, I cooked the potatoes just before serving in a separate pan and added them in at the end to decrease the starchiness of the stew.  There were no leftovers.

We liked this a lot. I just threw it all in the crock pot and it turned out great - I added 1/4 cup wine and a 12 oz package of frozen mixed veggies, omitting the worchestershire sauce and carrots because of what I had on hand. Definitely a repeat.

Exceptional! I am a pot roast/beef stew FANATIC (as a kid, it's what I always picked for my "birthday meal"), so I consider myself a tough critic. I've been making pot roast/beef stew myself for years now without a recipe, but decided to give this one a whirl. BEST POT ROAST I EVER MADE! Thank you so much for sharing this one. No modifications. Yum, and my house smelled incredible. One tip; do NOT shortchange yourself on the cooking time.

This dish might rate higher than a two star when not overcooked, but I wouldn't know. I followed the recipe exactly, using a few modification suggestions from other reviewers (adding beef gravy packet). The problem I had was when I stuck to the 10-12 hour cooking time. I started cooking it on Low at around 7PM. I checked on it periodically until midnight, when I went to bed. It looked to be nearly cooked, but it was hours from the time the recipe said it would be cooked, so I let it cook the rest of the time overnight. By the time I turned off the crockpot at around 6:30 AM, it was overcooked and very close to being burnt. I would suggest that you cook it for probably no longer than 8 hours on low, and the suggested 4 hours on high. I have no idea why they think it takes so long to cook on low!

This is a great recipe. I tried it last week and thought the meal was good. I altered it slightly this week and thought it was outstanding. With the alterations I now give it 5 stars.  Here's what I did: After tossing the beef in flour to coat I browned the beef in a skillet. I added the onions to soften. I then added half a cup of red wine to deglaze. I threw it all in the slow cooker after that and followed the recipe as written with one minor adjustment- I added a hearty tablespoon of Worcestshire sauce. With these minor changes, the stew had a much greater depth of flavor.  I think the key was to brown the meat first and also add the wine. Thanks for the great base recipe and for all of the user review suggestions. This stew is simply perfection!

I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers, browned the beef first (in batches), increased flour to 1/3 cup, and added 1/2 cup of red wine to deglaze the pan. I also added a little more red wine, 1/4 cup, to the pot just because it looked like it needed more "juice." I also used McCormick's Beef Stew seasoning in addition to the other ingredients in the recipe, which may be cheating, but hey, it tasted great. This was a very hearty stew, perfect for a cold winter evening. The house smelled so wonderful, I was hungry all day! I, too served it with a crusty french bread. Yum!

I always wanted a way to make a slow cooker stew without having to brown the meat first.  I prepped everything the night before, put the veggies in first, added a can of diced tomatos, some pieces of crumbled, cooked bacon with the meat, added some wine and balsemic vinegar with the broth, and at the end added a 10 ounce box of frozen mixed vegetables.  It was perfect!!

I was going through my reviews and noticed i NEVER rated this yet added it almost two years ago haha!  This is a simple, easy, fantastic stew recipe. I have made it many times and there is never any leftovers! Sometimes I like to add a packet of Lipton onion soup mix to the pot for a little extra zest!

My mother-in-law gave me this recipe when I was first married and I make it often. I use 2 cups of beef broth ( made with boulion) and 1/2 can tomatoe sauce for the gravy. I also add 1 tsp of steak sauce and 2 tsp gravy master to the sauce. At the last 15 minutes I add frozen peas and I thicken with a little flour. We never have leftovers!!!!!!!!!!

SELF CONFESSED LAZY COOK
Ok there are few times I'll review. Either when it's really good or really gross. This dish is AWESOME. Chop it up. Bung it in the slow cooker. I use very lazy garlic.. but a real onion.  None of that celery nonsense. Bung another potato instead. Go to work, it's ready when you get home. Serve with a crusty bread and butter. Served family of 3 and lunch next day. Oh wow 2nd day tastes great too. Dishwasher friendly and very little mess (flour gets everywhere but that's just me). 
Look at me..  in the garden drinking a beer. The wife thinks I'm slaving in a hot kitchen making something special. 
Ha ha!

I am so glad I found this recipe and read through some of the reviews before I made it.  I was tempted to try Corinne's version because I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to cooking.  I read more reviews and decided to stick to the original recipe.  It came out SO SO good and it was SO SO easy.    Here is a GREAT tip to make cleanup a little easier.  I used a crock pock liner (it's like a plastic oven bag and you toss it when you're done) to which I added my beef then the flour mixture and shook it up and the beef was coated evenly.  Then I put the bag with the beef and flour in the crock pot and added the rest of the ingredients.  Cleanup was basically non existent!

First let me just say, I followed this recipe for the most part as written and I have no idea why the first top reviewer did what she did to it. I'm sure her stew came out great, however, this stew was DELICIOUS following the recipe posted. Totally unnecessary to do all those extra steps and ingredients. Because I used a little more beef than 2 pounds and put more potatoes, carrots, and celery then stated, I doubled many of the ingredients to make up for the added food. The only big changes I made were added a 6 oz can of tomato paste, and I did up my paprika to 2 TBSP as well as 2 TBSP worchester sauce and the stew was AMAZING!! What a great recipe. Oh, how could I forget, I love putting wine in any meat dish I cook, so I added a 1/2 cup of pinot noir. Perfection. My husband loved it so much, he was eating left overs after he finished his plate right out of the crock pot. Luckily I still had enough for dinner the next night. Thank you to the original poster for a great, simple, and TASTY recipe! It's getting added into my rotation of meals.

The beef was dry and fibrous even though it was cooked on low for 10 hours and was falling apart nicely! No body ate the beef but the sauce and veggies were gone even though the potatoes and veggies were over cooked, discolored and mushy!

Necessity/mother of invention and all that!  I've made this recipe before (must've forgotten to rate it), and followed Corrine's changes - excellent!  Yesterday, with a sick child at home and a package of stew meat to use up, I had to be inventive... and it was excellent again.  I had no beef broth, but did have an open box of vegetable broth to use up.  I added about 1 1/2 packets of beef seasoning from Ramen packages, which I was afraid would only add salt, but did seem to add some beefiness.  I also didn't have the McCormick Beef Stew packet (have never bought that) so I added in a package of Lipton's Onion Soup Mix.  No red wine, so I used white.  More garlic, full TBSP of worcestshire, and all the other changes as per Corinne (browning the beef, etc.), and it was so darn good that my family polished off 2 pounds of meat!  It was not overly salty as I had worried with all those soup/seasoning packets.  I did thicken the sauce a bit at the end as I had added a bit of extra broth and it was very thin.  I had a LOT of veggies and sauce leftover with no meat... so guess what's in the crockpot this morning? :-)  I'm cooking more meat to add in, and I think I'll throw in some peas today as well.  Very forgiving recipe/technique, and with a bit more garlic and onion, extremely flavorful.  I'd also like to say that I really do appreciate all the comments that add in changes - I rarely have exactly the ingredients on hand, and love the input of possible changes.  9/15/16 UPDATE -

Great stew.  Instead of putting the meat directly into the crock pot, I coat it in flour and seasonings brown it in some olive oil before adding it to the crock pot.  I then deglaze the skillet with some of the beef broth and add this to the crock pot as well.

We enjoyed the beef stew. Everything fit well in the crock pot. The seasoning suited the theme of a beef stew. This was made as part of a birthday celebration. Did add two more bay leaves!

Awe-some! Made exactly the way user Corinne modified and it came out fabulous! By far, the best slow cooker beef stew recipe I've ever tried. Here are her modifications:  1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth (I used Swanson's Certified Organic in aseptic carton) with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning.

We have made this twice now and it's great and very easy to make!  I always end up putting extra beef broth in at the end because it seems to suck up the juice and be too thick.

Very good!  I used 4 cups of chicken broth (had no beef) Not sure 1 1/2 cups would have been enough? Added sweet potato, garlic powder and onion powder. I also added 1 tbls of organic soup base.  Cooked on high 9 hours, I think 8 would have been perfect. served with homemade rosemarry bread! Yum!

Standard beef stew taste - I thought it would be more zippy (esp since I hadded worchestershire & red wine), but I had to add cans of tomatoes and extra beef broth so it wouldn't be a solid mass. And the beef fell apart after just 8 hours so it wasn't in chunks anymore. Maybe the oven would keep it from turning to mush.

This was my first attempt at Beef Stew and it was a total hit!  I pretty much followed the recipes with the exception of a few minor chnages.  Since I was opening a can of beef broth I added the whole 2 cups, but after 2 hours on low I was afraid it might get runny so I added a Tablespoon of corn starch to thicken.  Next time I'll just use the 1 1/2 cups, I also added a little bit more Worchester sauce, a tad bit more salt and pepper to suit my tastes and i doubled the bay leaf.  Came out fantastic, don't brother with all the extra work of browning absolutely no need for it!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

This is a huge hit in my house! Our son loved it...and he's NOT a stew eater. We like a 'brothier' stew, though, so I doubled all of the broth ingredients (beef broth, spices, etc.) as well as the flour for thickening. The first time I made it as is and it was more like beef and veggies with gravy. The second time it was more stew-like. Delicious either way, though! I also added a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce instead of a teaspoon (2 TBS for more broth). Thanks! It's great!

Great!  I really stink at following recipes to the "T", but I did the first time I made it.  It was really good, but a little bland for my taste.  Second time, I took some of the other reviewers suggestions (wine to deglaze, 2 bay leaves, more flour) and made it with sweet potatoes and and added dried rosemary.  It turned out great!
This is a really good one and I appreciate you sharing it with us.

I rated this recipe 4 stars, but if you follow Corinne's suggestions (another review) I would rate it 5 stars. I followed her advice in full. The only changes I made to the recipe was that I did not add celery (didn't have any), and toward the end of cooking I ended up adding about 3/4 cup of water because it was VERY thick stew.  The water thinned it out just enough to make it a nice thick stew (but not too thick). This stew had a very nice beefy flavor and very nice dark brown color. Very pleasing to the eye. Will definitely make again.

I didn't brown the meat and don't think I will, either.  Why make more work?  It was plenty moist and tasty and fell apart like a good stew should.  I put all the dry seasonings (include a packet of Beef Stew seasoning) in a zip lock and tossed the stew meat in there till well coated.  Put that in the slow cooker with diced up potatoes, halved baby carrots, a can of beef broth, the garlic, paprika and worchestshire.  Went to work.  Came home for lunch and threw in some cut up portobello mushrooms.  Served with some Pillsbury Garlic crescent rolls for Halloween dinner before passing out candy.  Everyone loved it.  It's a keeper!

So good!  This stew turns out so flavorful and hearty.  Perfect for a cold night in winter.  The broth was nice and thick, not at all runny.  I followed Corrine's recipe, too, except I didn't use the beef stew seasoning, and I didn't think it needed it.  I also threw in a 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes because I like a tomato-y flavor in my stews.  My husband went GOOFY over it!!!  He had 4 bowls!!!

Family really liked this stew and it was very easy for me to prep in the morning.  I did brown the meat first, added a few chopped up tomatoes, some red wine instead of beef stock and more garlic since we are a garlic loving family.  The stew along with some great crusty bread made for a fantastic fall meal.  My picky  son even asked to have leftovers as his lunch for school the next day.

Very good homestyle recipe.  When you are craving some good 'stick to your ribs' comfort food, this is the meal.  In the future I think I will play with using fresh herbs and red wine, but as is it is very good too.
I used good quality beef stock as opposed to beef broth, and closer to 2 cups.  Also, used 2 or 3 cloves of minced garlic, and more worchestershire sauce (just shook some in there) than it called for.
Great when served with biscuits hot out of the oven!

I finally bought a slow cooker and wanted a good beef stew recipe to christen it. This really hit the spot! I skipped the onion and paprika, subbed baby carrots and red potatoes, and added frozen petite peas in the final hour. (Oh, and poured in a few glugs of cab sav.) It was ready in 8 hours on Low. (I had cut the meat and potatoes into pretty small pieces.) The gravy was thick, perfect for mopping up with hot rolls. I will be making this all the time this winter! Thank you, Nancy!

Great tasting stew!  I also browned the meat first, added some button mushrooms and peas.  It tasted wonderful - meat was very tender.  Thanks.

This recipie was a hit with the family.  I doubled everything except the pepper and I still found it to be a bit too much.  However, it was wonderful to eat on a cool fall day.  Thanks

It was pretty good but a little too bland for my taste. Next time I think I will tweak it a little bit.

I have tried several slow cooker beef stew recipes, but this is by far the BEST.  The family always goes back for seconds or thirds (if there's any left).  And it's so easy.  I don't usually follow a recipe to the letter.  I like to put my own spin on the ingredients after I've made it once following the recipe exactly.  However, with this recipe I wouldn't change a thing.

I have made this twice.  Once browning the beef and the second time not.  Didn't really make a difference to me so I would chose not to bother browning in the future.
I did add a little Keg Steak Spice (like Montreal Steak Spice) part way through as I wanted a little more flavour and it did the trick.
Served with Over-Roasted Asparagus and nice bread.  Sooooo good!

I used this recipe as my base. I had a couple of big T-Bone steaks I cubed them then seared them in olive oil at med-high heat. Once they were seared I put them in the slow cooker. I used beef broth to deglaze my pan and added that liquid to the meat. 
I used 6 potatoes, 4 celery stocks, 1/2  large onion, baby carrots cut into 1/2" pieces. I minced 5 garlic cloves, 2 Tab of worstershire sauce, 2 packets of stew seasoning, 3 bay leaves, salt and pepper to taste put it all in the slow cooker on high for 5 1/2 to 6 hours then reduced to low. 
It was delicious, my husband and my parents who are visiting loved it . 
The only thing I'll do different next time is use a different cut of beef, I used a London broil last time put it in whole and after 10 hours it fell apart and I think it had a better taste. This is a great sit by the fire with a big bowl of stew to warm you up.

Sundays,Are starting to return to where I need something to make the house smell nice. Made this last night an had to patiently wait till midnight for it to be done, but it took me back to childhood it reminded me of my grandmothers Beef stew. Didnt change anything an it's awsome cant wait for lunch. Now to make biscuits to go with this lovely dish.

I thought it was very tasty, but when I did it for 4 hours on high all of the broth was gone and it was starting to burn, so just something to look for especially if you have new slow cooker because I have heard they get a lot hotter and can tend to over cook. I just added a little more broth and it was all good. =-)

So easy!  So delicious!  My picky kids had seconds!  Doubled the recipe for my family of 7 plus friends, skipped the flour (didn't end up needing it), subbed chicken broth, because I was out of beef, and voila!!  Delicious, hearty, healthy, and homemade.   Thank you, Buchko!  My family wolfed down the leftovers for BREAKFAST and are requesting more!  Score one for mom!

I made this today and it was awesome. I hesitated on adding the Worcestire sauce, but in the end you don't taste it. I didn't change any part or add anything to it and it turned out great. I cooked it on high for 6 hours in the crockpot and the meat is so tender. Great stew on a cold, snowy day. Love it!!

I am only giving 3 stars because the very basic step of browning the meat in a frying pan first was missed an no one likes gray meat.
Everything else was great. I will add some tomato paste next time too.

I LOVE this beef stew. My kids like it too. I have often substituted beef boullion cubes for the beef broth. I have used 2-3 and sometimes more. I am gluten intolerant, so I use gluten free flour and it is works fine. I can be guaranteed my boys will get their veggies with this recipe. Since we live in Alaska, sometimes I will throw other veggies into the mix like turnips and other squash. The squash I throw in at the very end.

This is a great beef stew recipe.  I love the fact that you don't have to brown the meat first making it so easy with very little clean up.  
I have shared this recipe many times with friends who all love it.

What did I do wrong. Apparently nothing as I followed the recipe to the "T" and to the video. After 8-1/2 hours on low, the liquid was non-existent, the food around the edges was burnt and the veggies had turned to mush :((

Made this for dinner tonight.  Yummy!  Made a few changes - some as suggested by others, some of my own.  Seared off the meat & deglazed the pan with the beef broth.  Pan needed further deglazing, so I added about 1 cup of water, the worscheshire sauce, and my own mixture of seasonings - celery flakes, steak seasoning mix, dried Basil, and some sprigs of thyme.  Also added the bay leaf to this mixture and let it simmer for a couple minutes before adding it to the beef already in the crock pot.  Some other changes I made - 3 stalks of celery instead of 1, about 8 oz. Mushrooms, and a small bag of frozen peas added about 1/2 hour before serving.  I cooked on high over night (a short night - 4 hours), refrigerated all day, and cooked on low for about 4 hours before serving.  This is a great recipe.  I love the addition of the worcheshire sauce as it gives a vinagery aspect to the stew (which my husband love but I'm not so fond of) without being as overpowering as vinegar would be.  This is my new go to for beef stew!

This is great, the meat is super tender and its very filling.. it tasted so good that my fiancé complains he had too much after eating it.  I kicked it up a notch with all the spices and seasoning to make it more tasty.  In additional, I added everything else I can find at home... fresh parsley, rosemary, thyme.... and doubled the Worcestershire sauce.

Best Beef Stew ever! I usually just use the McCormick's Slow cooker beef stew packet and it always seems like something is missing. I decided to try something new, so I followed Corrine's suggestions and it was SUPERB! My husband said it was the best beef stew he has ever had. I used about 3 pounds of lean beef stew meat, and added a can of corn, a can of green beans, and a can of fire roasted tomatoes with juices in with everything else. YUM-O. I don't even like red wine but the flavor of the beef stew was fantastic! I was very nervous trying Corrine's changes but I am SO glad I did. You won't regret it. I can say that if I hadn't added the changes, this might have been too bland for me. I like a lot of flavor. hope this helps :)

I made this  as the recipe said the only thing I changed was dredging the beef before I put it in the slow cooker and adding 1 package of onion soup mix as suggested by another reviewer. It turned out super yummy. It had so much flavor and the veggies were all cooked perfect. Even my very picky 14 yr old loved it. Thanks for the onion soup suggestion :)

Don't know why this is getting such strong reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly except adding the potatoes half way, 3 hours through the cooking process so they wouldn't fall apart.  I cooked on high for 6 hours and the potatoes still fell apart plus there was the taste of potatoes throughout the whole stew because they had begun to disintegrate.  Prior to adding the potatoes I did taste the stew and it was bland but figured I would stick to the recipe.  Pretty much the only taste was the dissolved potatoes, the other vegetables had no flavor after being cooked so long.  Will not make again...

Loved this! My changes: used just 1 lb. of beef stew meat, added an extra clove of garlic (total of 2), and for the 1 1/2 cups of beef broth, I substituted 10.5 ounces of beef consume (1 can) and 1 1/2 cups of red cooking wine.

I've tried a few versions over the years and I made this tonight and this was the best recipe I've ever had! I feel browning the meat first dries it out and toughens it so I prefer not to. The beef was shredded it was so tender! I added a drained can each of green beans and corn for more veggies in the last hour and didn't put the potatos in until 2 hrs left. I also thickened it with some cornstarch. Wonderful recipe and will be the one I always use.

I browned the meat before placing it into my slow cooker but otherwise I changed nothing.  This was excellent and full of flavor.  You could even serve this over egg noodles to feed more.

This was delicious! The only small adjustment I would suggest is to add the diced potatoes halfway through the cooking cycle - I personally like a little bit of firmness to my potatoes..and being cut small like that, they pretty much fell apart. A really excellent recipe though, great flavors..5 stars from me! Thanks for sharing!

Flavor is pretty good, but the soup portion was a little muddy (from the beef) and it wasn't thick enough. I ended up putting in some leftover mashed potatoes to thicken the stew. As a "throw everything in a pot and leave it" recipe, it's very good. But not as good as stew cooked on the stove top. I will make again if I need something easy to throw together.

An excellent recipe for a stew that doesn't require browning the meat prior to cooking.  That said, I still prefer a slow cooker stew where the meat has been browned first.
This will be my "go-to" recipe for when I'm in a hurry.

I pretty much followed this recipe except I added a little bit more potato and some red wine. I was hoping to have it cooked before going to bed, get it in fridge for next day's dinner.

I cooked on hi for 5 1/2 hours and the potatoes and carrots were no where close to being done. I turned it to low, added a bit more broth and let it cook all night.

Stuck it in fridge and we heated it up for dinner that night. I used Spice Island Bay Leaf and we thought the bay leaf flavor was overpowering everything else. I think next time I will leave it out, or take it out halfway through cooking.

Other than that, it was delicious. I prepped the meat as the recipe states, I didn't  mess with browning it at first. What's the point of using a crock pot if you have to dirty up other pots and pans?

The meat was tender, the gravy/soup was delicious. The potatoes and carrots held up and didn't turn mushy.

Oh, and we added canned green beans when re-heating and that was a very nice addition.

Excellent beef stew; will make it again.

Fabulous!!  We loved it!  Coming from the mistaken idea you have to brown the meat first, I was skeptical........loved it!!  Followed recipe exactly except didn't have any potatoes.........so served it over gnocchi!   Don't change a thing!  Easy and GREAT!!!

Fantastic Stew!  My picky son stated that this is the new stew recipe - no questions!  I really enjoyed the ease of this dish and the only addition I made is I added 3 large sprigs of Rosemary to the top of the crock pot and removed them after cooking - what an amazing aroma in our house!  This stew has a really lovely mellow flavour.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent basic beef stew recipe. If you are looking for basic, I wouldn't make any changes.  I don't dice my potatoes, I like quarter them. I also use baby carrots. I cut everything in half and cooked on high for 4 hours.

This was good, but nothing special.  I made it as written except, I added some Kitchen Bouquet near the end to darken the gravy and give a bit more flavor.  I also made a slurry of flour & water to thicken up the gravy at the end.  I don't see any reason to fry the meat first as some did.  My meat came out very tender and flavorful.

Simple and tasty.  I added about 1/3 cup of red wine and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar for a little extra flavour.  I didn't have a can of beef broth, so I used "Better Than Buillion', a wonderful organic beef paste.  I just ate a bowl fresh out of the crock pot on a cool autumn day - wonderful!  Oh yeah - and I used bison stew meat as that is what I had kicking around.

I have never had my beef stew turn out until now!  This is a spectacular recipe for stew. I followed the recipe exactly ( I added an extra bay leaf). It turned out perfectly. There was not a drop left after dinner. Follow the instructions and don't modify.  Perfect for a busy mom!

This slow cooker recipe replaced the slow cooker pot roast recipe I found in one of my cookbooks. It has more flavor, and it's easier to prepare. I especially love that the meat, potatoes, and vegetables are already in the slow cooker so I don't have to prepare a side dish.

Fabulous.  This was so much like Mom's beef stew.  I put the beef and boullion in the crockpot before I went to bed...added the veggies in the morning.  Came home to the welcoming aroma.  The meat fell apart and the gravy was perfect.  It's a repeat for sure!

This recipe was okay but nothing to write home about.  I had it on low for 12 hours and all the vegetables were complete mush.  The flavor was pretty decent, though.  I think it would have been quite improved if I'd only had it in the cooker for 8 hours or so.

I made this last night for me and my husband. He loved it. He took the leftovers to work the next day and shared with a friend. The friend said, "Tell you wife that is the best beef stew I have EVER had. It was really very good. Very tender and I loved the  gravy it made. Really good.

I followed the recipe and directions exactly how they are and I thought it was delicious!  I was a little concerned because of how little broth there was, but I love how it turned out!  The meat came out tender and the vegetables were super yummy!  I am definitely going to make this again.... next time i'll just add a little more pepper :-)

after tasting it, seemed to me like it was kind of bland, like missing some kind of saltiness. for asians, you might be familiar with fish sauce-- i added abt 1 tsp fish sauce (more to taste), & then it was good beef stew, not exactly the best i've had. didnt become "fishy-tasting" at all, took off the flatline in the taste. i would probably still make this with some mushrooms.

Great Recipe. Instead of chopping an onion, I used dry onion soup. My family likes the sauce to be thick, so I just mixed in some corn starch in the last half an hour.

I substituted Soy Saucr for the Worcestershire sauce, but did everything else the same.  
Can't say enough good things about this!!!

Best I have made! Follow the recipe exaclty and you won't be dissapointed. No need to brown beef in pan first as I was suprised to find out. I add a few parsnips or tunip/rutabega when I make it. Mmmm I always serve with home made bisquits.

Just wanted to mention that instead of stirring to coat the meat with the flour mixture, I used a Reynold's Crock Pot Liner and put the meat and flour mixture in and shook it to cover.  Worked perfectly!!

I followed the recipe as is, except I added mushrooms.  It was very good.  We felt it needed a little more flavor though.  I think next time I'll try adding thyme or marjoram.  The beef was very tender, and both kids loved that!

I have had this recipe as written several times, and my family absolutely loves it.  By itself, with biscuits over it, reheated, there is no way to eat this that isn't delicious!  I do definitely recommend cooking it the longer, low heat, way though.  I was late putting it in today so did it on high, and it didn't thicken up quite as well as I'm used to.  Still delicious, but I do like a thicker gravy in the stew, personally.

Floured the beef and browned it along with the onions and garlic. That's the only thing I did differently and it's only because I had the time and was home. My  husband loved it and he's not much on stew

This was ok, but was not something that I was pleased with...especially since I was taking it to a sick friend and her family. It only had ok flavor, and I had to add over double the amount of beef broth just to have some juice to it. Like others, I thought it had far too much meat and too few vegetables. This needs quite a bit of tweaking to be considered good.

I made this soup tonight exactly as it was written and it turned out TERRIFIC. This is the first time that I ever made soup so I was excited about the easy recipe. I must say that the next time, I will perhaps increase the salt/seasoning because it was a bit bland for my taste, but overall, GREAT! Thanks for sharing & I appreciate the other reviewers encouraging cooks to follow the recipe exactly as it is written and I read the reviews faithfully to see how I can 'tweak' and make a recipe better.

This recipe made an excellent stew.   I usually never rate a recipe unless I follow it exactly but I will in this case because I think you should know that you can play around with this one to suit your taste and end up with excellent results.  I browned the meat in oil first (because I like a "seared" look), used 1-1/2 cupes water with 1 extra large buillion cube (because I didn't have broth) and added 1 14.5 oz can stewed tomatoes and some fresh green beans (because I wanted to get rid of them).  This was excellent.  It could have used more gravy (because I did add the extra veggies) and would consider using more broth/water&bouillon/wine the next time.

Good, basic recipe. I add extra veggies (whatever I have on hand) and if there's time, brown the meat and deglaze the pan with red wine. Otherwise, just throw it all into the crock pot and add a splash of wine. I was out of Worcestershire sauce, but it was fine without. The wine does the trick.

Wow, best I ever made!  I modified like others by first coating the meat with the flour,salt, pepper mixture, then browning it and deglazing the pan with 1/2 C. red wine.  I also added pkg. of McCormick stew seasoning once it was in the crock pot.  I usually don't use packages of seasoning, but this was just so darned good I wouldn't want to leave it out.  The gravy was a rich, dark brown and looked as good as it tasted.

Excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe, but I increased the vegetables, and added 1/2 cup more beef broth and 1/2 cup of red wine.  I also added 2 packets of brown gravy.  Delicious!  My husband and kids loved it.

I wish I had browned the meat first.  This was probably the most boring stew I've ever had.  I definitely won't be making it again. The meat fell apart and was just mush.  Unfortunately there's enough for 5 more meals and I won't throw it out.  I'm too frugal.  I will finish it but won't make it again.

Excellent! My husband said that this was the best stew I have EVER made! I have been using a recipe similar to this for years, but for this recipe I used sirloin steak, fingerling potatoes cut in half and increased the celery to 3 stalks. It cooked for 12 hours while I was at work. It's a keeper! Thanks!

I bit the bullet and used some Angus beef instead of stew meat.  YUM!  But, we tried this recipe again with stew meat, too.  And, everyone loved it.  Great simple crowd-pleaser.  We will use this recipe over and over.  It's a good base recipe to tweak toward your own personal tastes.

This was a very homey stew.  I made a few minor changes based on personal taste.  The changes I made from the written recipe were: 1 1/4 lb of stew meat, more carrots, more potatoes and 1 1/2 c more broth.  Changes that I added (again based on personal taste): in the last hour of cooking I added a can of corn, a can of green beans and a can of mushrooms.  I also added a packet of brown gravy and a dash of Kitchen Bouquet.  I was concerned about not browning the meat but it turned out very tender.  I cooked on high for 5 hours and then left in on warm for a couple of hours to finish thickening up.  The stew was served with fresh bread.  With the extra broth there was plenty of gravy to sop out of the bowl.

This was good, although like most people said you do need to add cornstarch to thicken it up at the end.  I also found it a touch bland, so I added in some thyme, basil and parsley and that really kicked it up and made it pretty good!

This beef stew is wonderful.  I did however adjust it slightly.  I put the meat, flour, salt and pepper in a big baggie and shook it until all the meat was covered.  I then added about 1 tablespoon to a pan along with the onions and browned the meat.  There was a little of the mixture left in the baggie so I first dumped that into the crockpot and then added the meat and onion cooked mixture on top of that.  Then I followed the recipe.  About 1/2 way through cooking I thought it lacked a little something so I added 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary and 1 teaspoon of dried parsley.  That did it!  We LOVED this recipe and because it was so good, I made another batch just to share with others.

This recipe is excellent!! It came out GREAT!! but I did make a few changes.. I did brown the meat on all sides real quick after coating the meat with the flour/spice mixture.. Added 1/12 cups of water and 1 beef bouillon cube to the pan I browned the meat in until disolved and poured over the meat. I also used 1 package of Onion soup mix And chopped up 1/2 onion and added to the crockpot. 2 celery stalks chopped about 1/4 inch pieces. added 1 teaspoon of chopped garlic, and used a small bag of baby carrots whole.. I didn't have any potatoes but canned whole potatoes and didn't want them to get mushy so I waited until the last 3 1/2 to 4hrs to add them since they were a little softer then fresh cut potatoes. I let it simmer the whole 9-10hrs and added a micture of 1/4 cup of Wondra quick mixing flour with about 1/4/ to 1/2 cup of hot water to make almost a pancake consistency and mix it in to the crockpot until blended.. It was Wonderfull!! Cant wait until tomorrow for left overs!! :)

I tweaked the recipe by omitting the celery and adding thick sliced mushrooms.  I also added about a cup of Shiraz wine.  Unbelievable!  I had to keep myself from licking the bowl.

Absolutely the best beef stew I've ever made - and the easiest!  I will double next time, so we can enjoy it for another day - this winner was gone in one sitting!

Best stew ever! That's what my husband said tonight, his only complaint was that there wasn't more... The only thing that I changed was that I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic salt. Also, I only used one lb. of stew meat since that's all I had and it was perfect for us. More would've been too much, in our opinion. Still fantastic, this is now my beef stew recipe.

We liked this recipe, but it was a little bland and definitely needed more water.  Next time I will add at least 1 more cup of water/broth and more seasoning.

Good basic stew, quick and easy.  I used 2/3 C of flour, doubled the seasonings, and placed it in a ziplock bag with the meat and shook it, then dumped it into the crockpot.  I doubled the amount of broth used and also used 2T of worcestershire sauce.  The meat turned out very tender and the veggies were perfect.

Very good start to the recipe. 5 star with my updates.  I made better, IMO, by browning the beef cubes first. Put a tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium high heat until shimmering. In batches, brown cubes of beef (don't crowd the beef because you don't want them to steam), then place into the pot. In between batches deglaze the pan with wine (~1/4C), then add the residue into the pot. Continue the oil, beef, wine process until all the beef is done.  Further, I doubled the broth because we like more liquid, added more garlic, and put in a few sprigs of thyme.  I let it cook on low for 10 hours (that's how long I was away at work - it would probably be fine a couple hours less). I then added an 8oz package of button mushrooms, quartered, and 1C frozen peas for the last hour or so. If necessary, thicken the gravy with a cornstarch slurry. Unbelievably tender and delicious.

This is a very good recipe, it has not finished yet, it has about 3 hours to go, but the broth is awesome. A tip I would like to share to making your meat tender is to soaking the meat in red wine vinegar preparation. The red wine really gives the meat a kick and the vinegar breaks the meat down to be more tender. I guarantee you will have the best beef stew doing so.

Wonderful recipe!  I made a few changes to the base recipe.  I love a very flavorful stew and wanted to make sure it didn't come out bland at the end.  I added an envelope of lipton onion soup and an envelope of mccormick's beef stew seasoning.  I also upped the garlic to 3 large cloves and added string beans.  At the end of the cooking time as another reviewer suggested I mixed a quarter cup of merlot with some corn starch and added it in and let it cook with the lid off for 15 minutes to thicken up.  This added merlot gave the stew a wonderful rich flavor and the extra seasoning made it anything but bland...it was just perfect!  It was delicious!  I served it with a crusty multi grain baggett.  I will definitely be making this again!

A very easy beef stew recipe.  I followed the directions as written (I doubled the incredients though.)  For those of you who like a thicker gravy, take the lid of the crock pot for the last 45 minutes to an hour.  It seemed to thicken up just enough.

I have made this stew recipe three times now and have enjoyed it more each time.  My personal touches include adding a sweet potato and thickening the beef broth with 2 tbsp of instant gravy granules after the stew is finished cooking.   Simple and tasty comfort food.  Yum!

I made this recipe with the modifications compiled by Corrine.  While the flavor was good, I wasn't a fan of the flour coating on the stew meat.  It gave the meat a somewhat 'slimy' outside.  Also, I believe due to the flour cooking all day in the stew the thickened sauce burned to the sides of the crock pot.  Next time, I think I'll brown the stew meat without the flour, then add the flour to the broth the last hour of cooking.  Overall, still pretty good.

Easy, quick, & delicious ... I fed a whole campus police department with two double batches in two 6 quart crockpots at our last Big 10 football game. I did add some extra potatoes and carrots because the batch I made for the family earlier had too much meat leftover after the veggies were gone.  Everyone raved about the flavor.

I will only give this a 3 because it was a good base recipe but i doctored it up A LOT!! I took the advise of other reviewers and browned the meat in olive oil and i used seasoned salt before adding it to the slow cooker. I added extra garlic and an extra potato. I checked it half way through and it was just so bland i had to add something else! So then i added some garlic powder and onion powder and more pepper. I then used flour to thicken it up because we like it thick.

Good and easy!  I used one pound of "gourmet cut" stew meat (whatever that is!) instead of 2.  Next time I might add more Worcestershire.  I ended up adding some extra liquid, maybe 2 cups of water and beef broth combined.  I added about 1.5 cups of chopped cabbage because I love cabbage in beef stew.  Served with Honey Wheat Bread I formed into rolls.  So good together!

So easy and I didnt change a thing except I was out of beef broth, so I used Boullion and about a cup of water. Since potatoes cook so much faster than the other vegetables I just quartered them instead of dicing. Also cut the meat a bit larger then the one inch so it did not cook away.Put it on high for about 1hr or 2 hr. then to low for remaining. That night we came home to a wonderful  stew.

Hearty, basic, & easy! Leftovers reheated later in the week tasted great, too.
I made very minor changes:  I used 2 cans of beef broth, 2 stalks of celery, 1 Tbsp of Worchester, & 2 cloves of garlic.  S&P I added to taste.
I had some barley in the cabinet & I threw it in towards the end...it thickened it up to a nice "stew" consistancy.  
Great served with warm bread/rolls.

This came out very good...I too added a package of brown gravy, did not prebrown the beef, and upped the beef broth to 2 1/2 cups...slow cooked it all day and made the house smell great.  I like this recipe better than my original beef stew recipe, so my orginal recipe is going in the trash!

I come to this site to get true reviews on the original recipe as written.  Time and again I see. I tweeked it this way..When I see that, I go on to find the reviews of the recipe as written. Might as well get out my cook books (which does not include reviews). Give us new cooks a break. Some of us have limited spices etc. Stew is very good as written.

This beats moms home cooked recipe! So much yummy flavor and the meat gets really flavorful and tender. The recipe as is or adding your own touch just makes it better. Buy extra ingredients because when it's gone you'll wish there's more. Simple too all you have to do is chop and throw in and forget till it's done.

We did not see anything unusual or exciting about this stew. Basic stew recipe that in the end needed a lot of seasoning to give it any taste at all. And the extended cooking time seemed to break the meat down too much. The meat was far more tender than I like to have in stew. And forget about reheating it. We did that in a saucepan and it turned to mush.

I really love this recipe.  It can be done all in one pot with very  little mess to clean up.  The taste is amazing, especially for how simple it is.  I did add a half cup of wine for extra savoriness but otherwise followed the recipe.  No need to brown the meat before hand makes this one a keeper and repeater.  The only negative thing is there are not enough veggies for a family of four... I added way more than the recipe calls for and it still wasn't quite enough.  Everyone in our family enjoyed it and it will be a new staple in our house.

I made this recipe as is and it's fantastic! I love garlic and I added more than was called for and it was too much for this recipe but the flavor was amazing regardless. The very best part about this recipe is that you don't have to do anything fancy like some reviewers have suggested, just simply follow the instructions and enjoy the rest of the time you don't have to be in the kitchen cooking!

Made this as written except for adding some mushrooms I had on hand.  Turned out great.  You may want to add some spice if you like your stew with a bit more heat.

Not a fan. Heavy, salty and dull in flavor. I might have done something wrong but I followed the recipe to a tee. Sorry - I want to like it more.

I've reviewed all the other suggestions and I've made this a few times now. Trust me, FOLLOW THE ORIGINAL RECIPE! It's simple, it's easy to follow, and it's delicious! The ONLY change that I made to this was a added a bit more beef stock because I like a bit more "broth" to my beef stew....the original was just a bit to thick for me. I made a larger batch, with 3 lbs of stew beef so I adjusted the rest of the ingredients by 1/3. I also did double the amount of stock plus a little more flour to make up for it. That's it. This is a great recipe...don't mess with a good thing!

I made this exactly as written and have to say I was so disappointed.  The taste wasn't anything special, actually there wasn't much flavor to it at all.  I am now on the search for a great slow cooker beef stew again.

It looked and smelled good. But wasn't as flavorful like I thought it would be. Maybe I just got the wrong type of meat. first time a amateur cook ...

I think Canucky needs to mind her own... Corrine was right on the dot and her changes really finished out an already good stew. I think If Canucky Ever posts her own recipe she'll be Very Upset When people start telling about the changes they made that made the recipe BETTER...    Canucky; get a Real life... You'll feel better!

I have made this stew as written and it is excellent, although I have had a problem with the potatoes being cooked in the crockpot. They sometimes come out raw!! Everything else is hot and savoury but the potatoes are absolutely hard. Any thoughts? Did you add tomato paste? In my experience potatoes won't cook at all in a crockpot with tomato sauce or paste being used in the recipe.

Yummy beef stew without standing over the stove all day. I do add more celery, carrots and potatoes (personal preference), more beef broth to compensate for the extra ingredients as well as increasing spices. Lots of times I'll even toss in a can of hominy towards the end for hubby. This has been a regular staple at our house since I found this recipe a couple of months ago. If it doesn't have enough spice for ya experiment. Fool proof. Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this tonight. I was very skeptical about the meat being tender. I'm only used to flouring and then browning the pieces before cooking. I will NEVER have to do that again. It was soooo good! I let it cook on low for about 10 hours. I did thicken a little with cornstarch slurry. It was just sooo good and easy.

This is a great recipe. We can all make seasoning and vegetable adjustments to suit our taste, but the proportions and method are the key to this very easy recipe. Pan-frying this and sautéing that is missing the point of this rich, hearty, simple stew.

This is a wonderfully simple one dish slow cooker meal. You can complicate it by brazing the meat or sauteing things first but it certainly is not necessary. That is the beauty of a slow cooker. I find this recipe to be basic and contain everything a good basic beef stew should have. Of course individual tastes vary and this recipe can support additions of ingredients that you prefer in your stew. 
Many times I do not have time to spend on our main meal but this recipe allows me to prepare a healthy meal even though I had to be away from home most of the day.

Started a low carb diet so I didn't add the flour, but followed the recipe to a T...great flavor, love it!
Cause of the low carb, I cooked with potatoes but then just picked around them.  
Good for dinner and leftovers the next day, thanks for sharing!

It's basic, but it's good. You have to always add your own favorite touches to every recipe (well I have to) lol. Always always always braise your beef first, or meat in general then cook it low n slow for tenderness. This turned out great, too much sodium in the beef stew seasoning packet so I used my own spices of coarse. Great job :) I love experimenting.

Very nice with NO CHANGES. If you want tender beef, take the time to cook on low. I have made a zestier version by reducing the salt and adding 1 tsp. of Cabela's Hot and Spicy Seasoning Blend. However, I prefer the classic beef stew flavor, so most of the times that I make this stew, I don't mess with the recipe. Thanks for a simple, no fuss, no mess recipe!

I think this is a great stew as is for anyone wanting a simple crockpot stew! The only change I made was adding some frozen peas.  I just need peas in my stew to make it perfect, however I think next time.... And there will be a next time...I will just add thawed (and drained) peas at the end. I think the water from the frozen ones added too much liquid to the juice so it didn't thicken at all. But even with my juice being more watery it still tasted great!

Full disclosure, I added more broth (3 10 oz cans) because I prefer soup-like soup, as well as a packet of McCormick's beef stew seasoning.  Everything else I followed to the letter.  That being said, even with the extra spices I found this to be pretty bland.  The other reviews were right, this recipe lacks depth and layers.  I'm not sure what could have fixed it (more herbs and spices maybe) but it definitely needs some tweaks.  It is a good base to start with though if you're one of those cooks who can be creative in the kitchen.

Great flavor.  Increase liquids for soupier stew.  Don't bother browning meat next time even though some reviewers recommend it.

I followed, except I did not have a bay leaf.  I set it for 6 hours on high.  At 4 hours there was no liquid left at all, so I added 2 cups of beef broth and set for 1 1/2 hours.  My husband is very picky, and he loved it!  I was so excited to find something very easy to make that he and the kids devoured!

A home run with my family of 5! The beef is very tender and the flavor is so rich and satisfying! I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it and still had only one  serving leftover! I wouldn't change a thing!

I was walking into the grocery store trying to think of something.. just anything to make. Sometimes my problems with cooking stem from not knowing what to cook. Beef stew came into my mind and I realized the only thing I would have to buy would be beef. To make a long story short... I bought the food followed the exact recipe to a "T" and we were left with the best beef stew I've ever had. No changes need to be made. Once could change it but it would be a different meal. This is sooo easy to make. Try it!

Made this tonight for dinner its just like gramma used to make. Great recipe and as others have said you can add what you like, but this is great by the recipe. No need to brown the meat, it came out very tender and juicy. I cooked it in the slow cooker for 6 hours on high, excellent, thank you for a wonderful recipe!

You cannot go wrong with this recipe. It is amazing. The house smelled wonderful while it was simmering. And, the taste is spectacular. I made a double batch and something tells me it won't last long, between my husband and 3 sons:

I tried this recipe for the first time today but it will not be the last time! It was fabulous! I only made one substitution and added two extra ingredients but otherwise, followed the original recipe. I added parsnips and turnip because my husband wouldn't consider it a stew if it didn't contain those two veggies. Then, because I had a stewing bone (I always use one for extra flavour) to put in with the meat, I didn't use beef broth. I just used the equivalent in water and it was very flavourful. Using water instead of broth makes for a less salty stew, I'm sure, but you can always add salt at the end if need be. It was SO GOOD. We loved it. Thanks for the recipe, BUCHKO!

I usually purchase a brand name seasoning package when making stew in my crockpot but was out. Found this recipe and realized I had all the necessary ingredients already in my pantry. No need to purchase McCormick's seasoning package. I made it and my husband and I both agree this recipe came out so much better than when I use the McCormick's seasoning. I don't know why so many people are suggesting adding McCormick's. This is a simple recipe that for my family tasted better! No leftovers to throw out this time. Tweak it a little or post your own recipe. But please stop selling McCormicks. I've got nothing against McCormicks but go to their website and write a review of their product instead.

Really good! I really through the comments and decided that this would probably be good regardless of how I made it. There really is no need to brown the beef, though. I threw in a packet of seasoning just to make sure it would have a good stew flavor which I think really helped. My only issue is that although everything was totally cooked after 6 hours on high, my potatoes were still a bit crunchy. Next time I may need to pre-boil, but I will use this recipe again.

What an amazing stew! 

I'm usually a fussy eater, but this was absolutely amazing. I even went for seconds!

We left the recipe "as is" and did not brown the meat ahead.

It's headed for my recipe binder for sure!

I've made this recipe multiple times, and it is just delicious!! It may be basic, but it has a really nice flavor, and it's super easy to make. The only things I changed was I put a little more garlic and beef broth. :)

I added more celery and used baby carrots, adding more of those as well.  Mixed one packet of onion soup mix with flour because I didn't have any beef broth.  Perfect!  I really liked not having to brown the meat first. Tasted better than other recipes I have tried with browning first - nice to omit having a pan to clean.

WoW! This was spectacular.  I followed the recipe exactly, but because I was a little pressed for time, I started the crockpot on High from 12-2pm, then down to low until 6pm.  Perfect consistency of carrots and potatoes.  Just added a touch more salt >>> YUM, YUMMMMMEEE!  It's a keeper!

I have made this basic recipe for beef stew many times (receipe came with my crockpot years ago).  I like to add more garlic and onions for flavor, and substitute a little red wine for part of the beef broth.  Just made it this weekend and threw in a couple of parsnips (diced).  Added wonderful flavor to the stew.  Hard to mess this up whether you cook it on high for six hours or ten hours on low.  It is always a family favorite here.

I usually use that packet (shhhh!) that you get at the grocery store for beef stew.  

I used this recipe on the fly this morning and..... honestly, I will never use a packet AGAIN! 

Of course you have to adjust your veggies and meat to taste, as well as seasonings, but my honey went back to seconds and "asked" to take leftovers to work for lunch.  (not that he needs to ask!)

This is the 2nd beef stew recipe I tried and I'm very happy with this one.  The meat turned out super tender and the juice and flavoring of the stew was very tasty!  The only thing I didn't add was the bay leaf.... I didn't have any around.  And I did add half a packet of Beef Stew seasoning.

I cooked mine on low for 10 hours.

I haven't actually made this yet but I wanted to comment on Corinne's suggestions - the sole reason I searched for a recipe like this was so that I didn't have to do all the browning and sauteeing - I wanted a good stew that could be made by throwing ingredients in the slow cooker, and this is it.  The ingredients sound perfect and I'll be making it todday.

This turned out really well!!  Only thing omitted was the bay leaf and paprika (I was out of both).  Hubby filled his bread bowl up twice!!  Did I mention it was super easy?  Well, it was!  :)  Hubby has already requested I make this again in week after next.

Good stew.  It is a touch on the bland side, but you could doll it up however you want.  It is hardy and perfect for fall and winter. The directions don't say to remove the bay leaf before eating, but you should.

This was a really hearty stew with lots of flavor.  I pan fried the beef tips in flour.  I seasoned the flour with Tony Chachere's More Spice seasoning, garlic powder, and black pepper.  I pretty much followed the original recipe with the exception of one other addition.  An hour before it was finished cooking, my husband suggested adding a splash of vodka to the stew.  Crazy, right?!  So I added a big splash of Ketel One vodka.  This added a new layer of subtle richness to the stew.  Yum!

This is a good base for those who are new to making a stew or to the crockpot.  For those who like to tinker, it is a great stew to tinker with.  As written it is rather bland, but can be made much more flavorful.  My tweaks are similar to Corinne's.  I also coat the meat in spices and flour then brown the meat before putting in the pot.  I also add 1/2 alcohol and 1/2 broth instead of all broth.  I have done it with a good hot paprika, but I like it best as a more Provencal stew, using a good red wine and herbs de provence.  I've also done an irish stew using a dark stout and irish garden herbs.  Both give a nice depth of flavor.

This was my first time making a beef stew, I followed the exact recipe and it came out perfect!!  I did not use a bay leaf because I did not have one on hand and I also added a splash more beef broth.  I cooked it on high for 5 hours and my husband loved it!  I will definitely be making this more often!

This recipe is excellent.  I followed the directions, with only a few exceptions - we like a lot more vegetables in our stews, so I doubled all the vegetables and added a little more broth to compensate.  I can't give enough praise - my boyfriend has made this a regular meal.  We all love it!

Best recipe for beef stew I have found. Only I didn't need 12 hours, but it was done in 7 with my settings on low and had to stir every 1-3 hours otherwise gets a nasty black crust you have to scrape out. I think its the flour burning if not stired. Maybe because I have a newer crock pot and only used 1 pound of meat it was done sooner. Used 3-4 tablespoons of flour and a pinch of thyme. Used a bit more broth perhaps 2 cups?--until everything was covered. Usually use wine but found the recipe had a lot of flavor I didn't need it. Used yams instead because they are healthier. This stew gets salty after cooking so don't add extra salt until done. Bigger chunks of veggies might be better as they get smaller after cooking. Was very tasty when it came out so will be using this as my basic stew recipe from now on.

I make this regularly in the winter and my husband and I both love it.  I use a few tweaks-- I up the spices to suit our taste, use whole wheat flour, and make the potatoes into bigger chunks.  I also found that I needed to adjust the timing for my crock pot. My cheat timing is to do one hour on high and 4 hours on low.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

My boyfriend liked it, I thought it lacked flavour.  I followed Corinne's suggestions (most helpful).  I loved that when we came home from work dinner was ready but the dish seemed so one dimensional.  I think all day for the potatoes was a bit much too.  they were starting to fall apart and cover the rest of the ingredients, making every bite taste like potato.  I probably won't make this again.

Solid stew recipe. If you are creative and a good enough cook to know how to literally spice this up, you're fine. But I'm a novice and tend to like recipes that need no doctoring. This recipe lacked flavor but wasn't bad. And it was very easy to make.

This was FABULOUS!  I added some extra onions, mushrooms and peas.  Slow cooked on high five hours. Think I could eat the entire pot!

We wanted to follow the recipe pretty much exactly to see how it would come out, so for ease we would give it a 5, as for flavor - it's about a 3.

Made as written.  Cooked on high for 6 hours.  I love how there is no need to brown the beef first.  Definitely one of the best Slow Cooker beef stews I have ever made.

This was a good, basic stew, and it was certainly easy enough to throw it all in the crock pot and go.   I made this for a "soup night" dinner party, along with 3 other soup recipes from this site, and it filled the "good ole' reliable" spot quite nicely.

Made for the first time last night and it was excellent. I like a thick stew not beef soup so added a couple of tbsp instant potatoe flakes to thicken also approx a 1/4 cup red wine during last 1/2 hour

very good. will make again. I actually made with pork instead of beef- had leftovers, so decided to give it a try... added more worcestershire sauce, and a few more spices- but overall followed. VERY good!

Good stew.  Doesn't need a lot of ingredients, and is tasty.  Also makes it easy to tweak into your own versions using different spices, extra ingredients, more of the same.  I've varied it each time I've made it and been very pleased with the results.

Other than the addition of green beans and black-eye peas recipe to the letter. It turned out very bland. My husband liked it, and said to put it on the "make again" list. I'll give it another shot, but I'm going to play around with the oodles of spices in my pantry. I think this may be a decent "base recipe," and I think it will lend itself well to experimentation.

Fantastic recipe that turns out perfectly every time. I don't add the potatoes to the crock pot just because we prefer them mashed separately. Have used this recipe for pot roast as well with great results.  Kids love it and it's dead easy. Even my son, who is not big on foods with gravy,  eats it right up.  I have also used the left overs as a base for beef barley soup. Hope this helps.  Enjoy

We thought that this was really good. mine was done in about 7 hours on low and I even added extra veggies. Also at the end I added another 1 cup broth with 2T cornstarch and let that cook on low about 30 min to thicken up the sauce so make more of a gravy. The whole crockpot was eaten up.

My husband loves stews and I'm always looking for different ones. This one was a hit. It is just him and I and there were no leftovers. He had 2 servings and then had more later that night as a snack. He has already asked me when I'm going to make it again. Definitely a keeper.

This was pretty good.  It needed some extra seasoning but otherwise good and easy.  Liked how it didn't require any browning or deglazing.

This is the perfect beef stew recipe.  It's super easy and you can add your own spin on it if you like.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was incredible.  I would not suggest browning the stew meat prior to slow cooking--it could really dry it out.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out very thick and had a weird odor to it...very disappointed!  I think the potatoes sitting in the crock pot for that amount of time made the consistency very gelatinous.   I was surprised to see every review so sensational as our dinner tonight was very unsavory to say the least!  Maybe it was my particular slow cooker (I cooked it on high), but I would recommend putting the potatoes in later if you are going to cook on high for the suggested period of time.

This recipe is amazing. I added 1/2 cup red wine (cabernet sauvignon), 2 tbsp worcestershire, left out celery and replaced the salt with 1/4 tsp garlic powder and a quarter tsp of cayenne pepper. I also added 1 tsp. Goya Adobo powder to the flour (I used 1/3 cup) put them in a ziplock bag and shook meat up with it until covered. I then quickly browned the meat less than a minute on each side. Combined all ingredients in crockpot and let sit in fridge overnight. Next day after 10 hours on low, I came home to the most amazing beef stew I've ever made!

Yum! The only thing I changed was I added way more pepper and used 4-5 minced garlic, but that is a personal taste preference so I will keep the rating at 5 stars as the recipe itself is great! thanks for sharing!

Made the stew in anticipation of hurricane Irene. While easy to make, it was bland and nothing special. I wish I took others advice to add more interest and kick. It definitely needed more broth and more spices.

I have to say this is perfect the way it is!  Wow!  Being 7 months pregnant, beef stew sounded so good to me ... and I am so glad I tried this recipe! Yum is an understatement!  I followed the ingredients and directions exactly - I only doubled the recipe for my family of 6 (hoping there would be some leftovers - but we ate it all!!). Thank you BUCHKO for a great and easy beef stew recipe  :)

The recipe is delicious. I skip the flour altogether and use mealy potatoes, such as Idaho. The potatoes break down during cooking to thicken the gravy. I'm not on a gluten-free diet, I just make stew the way my mom did.

This was so good!! Instead of mixing the flour, salt and pepper I bought some beef stew seasoning mix and coated the meat with that. The seasoning already had worcestershire sauce in it, so I omitted my own, and I didn't have a bay leaf. When it was close to being done I put some flour in the bottom of an empty jar and added cold water. I put the lid on it and shook it up until the flour was mixed in with the water, and then poured a little in the stew and mixed it in to thicken the sauce some. I also used already peeled baby carrots...much easier. Thank you BUCHKO!!! I will be making this again!!

My family and I loved this stew. I did follow Corinne's advice as I am accustomed coating and browning the beef for stews. I never have a problem with the beef being dry and this was no exception. It almost melts in your mouth but isn't soggy either. I do need to brown it in 2 separate batches. My only issue was that I am not much of a wine drinker so I had no idea what kind to buy. I had heard that you should never cook with a wine that you wouldn't drink. I ended up buying Sutter Home Sweet Red Wine, not expensive but still good especially if you're not wanting to spend a fortune on something you might not use up.

This was my first time making beef stew in a crock pot (usually make it on the stove).  I followed Corinne's suggestions and it came out GREAT!  I added about a cup extra of the beef broth because I was worried it was going to burn up cooking for so many hours, but even with this addition it still turned out nice and thick.  I let it cook on low for 11 hours and the house smelled amazing when I came home!  I'll make this again.

I found this to be quite tasty!  The only made 3 changes 1-no onion 2-used seasoning salt instead of regular 3- used three cloves of garlic instead of one.  
Otherwise I followed the directions.  It was very simple and turned out wonderfully!

This has become one of my fav recipes. After reading all the reviews I have taken the advice of some. I used the beef stew seasoning pack once and it was awesome! The next time I didn't have in on hand so I put is about 1/4 cup red wine, also awesome! Beside that I followed the recipe directions.

Really nice recipe. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it. The only thing I changed was I tossed the meat in the flour mixture and browned it. Then I deglazed the pan w/ beef broth, worteshire sauce, and one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. I also kept my tempture on high for 3 hrs and then finished it off on slow. The meat was tender and well seasoned. Thanks!

This stew is excellent.  I received my first-ever slow cooker for Christmas last year, and have so far been unimpressed by the recipes in the booklet that came with it.  One of the problems is that most of them aren't slow enough . . . I'm not home in 6 hours, or even 8.  At 10-12 hours, this is perfect.  I followed a couple of the reviewers' recommendations, cutting the pepper in half and browning the meat first, and it came out just right on the first try.  I'll be enjoying my second try in about an hour.  Thanks for this recipe!

Yum, yum, yum! I like to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it and this was delish! The only things I did differently were: I didn't have celery, but I added some corn, peas and green beans (I like mine to be veggie heavy) and I didn't have beef stock, so I used chicken stock and added 2 beef bullion cubes. I cooked mine on low for about 6 hours, then high for 1 and it was soooo good! I just finished a bowl of leftovers and they were just as delish!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have to do much, it was cheap, and it cooked while I was at work. I left it in the crock pot for eight hours and when I returned the aroma was fantastic. I love garlic so I added more cloves as well as a bit of salt to taste, and from there it didn't last long in my house.

I brown the meat in the flour mixture before adding it to the crockpot and I only use about 1 pound of stew meat. Then I cook everything on low for about four hours. It's easy & tasty.

This is a good base recipe. The only thing I changed was I left out the celery (didn't have any) but otherwise I followed the recipe to a T (using the HIGH setting on my crockpot, I let is cook for about 5.5 hours). My boyfriend and I LOVE our food to have lots of flavor- sadly this stew was rather bland to us. I had some Zatarain's beef-flavored rice on hand that I ended up adding to our meal just for some flavor. But I gave it three stars because the TEXTURE of the beef was absolutely perfect! So tender and moist! I didn't brown it at all, as I was afraid browning it first would make it too dry. I'm glad I didn't! I'll make this again just for that alone, but I'll be adding a LOT more seasoning next time for my taste.

The best beef stew ever! It was really thick and hearty! We made it the night before camping, took it with us, and heated it up on the campfire grill. Perfect camping dish and soo flavorful! Will definitely make again. I did what others suggested and browned the meat before adding to the slow cooker. Followed Corrine's suggestions also.

I used 32 ounces of beef broth because I like it saucier, so I had to increase the flour to 1/3 cup.  I also used some more veggies, and left out the potatoes because I didn't have any.  Served with a french bagette.  This was so delicious!  I will be making this again.  It is very flavorful and the meat is very tender.  I wouldn't change one more thing!

This is a great recipe! I don't care for tomato based beef stews so this one is perfect.  I do dredge the meat in flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder and then brown prior to placing in the slow cooker.  I also cook the onions briefly and deglaze the pan with the broth before pouring the broth into the slow cooker.  I've also used this recipe to make a fantastic pot roast.  Follow the same ingredient list but replace the stew beef with a roast.  Same great taste!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was easy & pretty good, but just a little bland. Will add extra spices next time. Followed recipe exactly, except I added some cornstarch in the last 30 min to thicken (mixed 3 tbl with water and stirred into stew). The texture consistency was perfect.

I followed corinne's recommendations for this stew.Plus I a packet of brown gravy mix and 1Tbl flour to thicken at the end.Fabulous served in bread bowls.I brushed the inside of the bread bowls with olive oil and warmed them in the oven before adding the stew.This keeps the bread from becoming too soggy.Great combination!

I would add two tablespoons of (balsamico) vinegar. The vinegar makes the meat even more tender and therefore reduces cooking time. i would also add two small cubes of chocolate to get a lush brown sause/gravy. (the dish does not taste chocolaty if you only add a tiny bit)

Perfect - Just what I wanted!!!  I made a couple of changes based on what I had though..  My stew meat was frozen (less than 1.5 lb) and I just threw it in by itself for about 45 minutes before adding the flour, which I upped to 1/2 to 3/4 c.   I ended up adding about 4 cups water and a heaping T or more of "better than boullion".  I also used frozen chopped onions and way more worcestershire, salt and pepper.  TOTALLY forgot the bay leaf, and since I didn't have celery I used a few shakes of dried celery leaves.  During the last hour on high (cooked it for almost 6 hr total) I added 2 cans of diced potatoes and 1 can of whole carrots.  Came out amazing!!  Thanks for a simple recipe for this delish comfort food!

Easy to follow, easy prep.  My first slow cooker attempt.  I followed the recipe as written.  The flavor was bland.  I'd make it again and perhaps add more spices.

This was AWESOME!! My family devoured it! I used leftover steak I had cooked on the grill and Swanson's beef stock. I let the cubed up steak soak in the beef stock overnight and added the steak an hour before the soup was to be served. It was sooo tender!!

This was very flavorful but for some reason there was not much juice left! Still good though!

So good!  I took some advice and coated the meat in the flour and seasonings - browned them first and then added them to the pot.  I poured the remaining mixture in the pot (made the gravy a little thicker). I put 3 cups of beef broth.  I also added 1 beef bullion cube at the start and one about 30 minutes before it was done.  I doubled/tripled the veggies as well. AMAZING!

Super easy and very good.  I increased flour to 1/3 cup and added 1/2 cup of red wine.  Also, I added a pot roast seasoning packet - delicious but a little peppery.  Next time I'll skip the packet and season more on my own.

Super easy to make but I agree with other users that is it missing "something".  To try and give it a little more flavors I mixed some beef borth and red wine for the liquid portion.  I also added some spices, crushed red pepper flakes, rosemary, parsley.  I think next time I will add more liquid and try one of the pouch seasonings for stew.  Definately a keep and super easy though.

Found this recipe while looking for a way to use a 2lb cut of beef cheek (a notoriously tough cut of meat), and it was a great base recipe that gave me some great spice/herb combinations to work with. I used a few shakes of smoked paprika, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, basil, and upped the garlic to 3-4 cloves. Didn't measure the salt or pepper, but seasoned to taste. I used two bay leaves instead of one because I added more liquid than suggested. Substituted a green bell pepper for the onion because my boyfriend hates onions, also added an extra stalk of celery and omitted the carrots (didn't have any). Slow-cooked as directed, and after the four hours on medium heat, the meat can be easily cut with a spoon. Very nice, warm, brown color and hearty taste. Thank you!

I made this with two changes: I followed the advice of others and coated the raw beef with the flour and browned it, and, since I had a handful of cherry tomatoes on hand, I cut them up and added them halfway through. I've made plenty of stews and this one is a big winner!

Awesome!  I usually do not like beef stew that great unless it comes from a can, but this was so good.  Even my picky hubby told me it was good.  I followed recipe almost exactly except I used garlic powder in place of garlic clove, canned taters instead of peeling and cutting them up myself and left out celery b/c not a big fan of.  My meat was still half frozen so I cooked on high for about 3 hours and then cooked for another 5 hours on low.  Sauce was thickened perfectly.  Delish!

This is an excellent base recipe which can be modified easily depending on what's available in your fridge.  I like to add the following in addition to what's already listed: 2 T tomato paste, 1 can mushroom soup (and omit the beef broth), 2 cans water, 1 c mushrooms, 1 slice diced bacon, 3 extra cloves of garlic, handful of chopped fresh parsley (reserve some for the end as a garnish).  In the last 3 hours of cooking I add 1 c okra, 1 c multi-colored mini peppers, and 1 c french green beans.  This is a healthy recipe and a great way to get in your veggies... also your home will smell incredible all day!

Yes, this is a basic beef stew, but that doesn't mean it isn't good! I only used 1 1/2 lbs. meat. I had to sub vegetable broth for the beef broth and I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, celery, or bay leaf, so they got left out. Because of timing issues, I cooked on high for 2 hours, then low for 6 and everything was nice and tender.

I don't really get what all the hype is? I made this recipe according to directions and I found it bland and a bit tasteless. It tasted like beef and potatoes in gravy. Nothing exciting about it. Maybe next time, I'll add the Guiness, as one person suggested and a puff pastry top? There are much better stews out there...

A very good basic stew recipe.  I prepared the recipe exactly as written with only one addition, I increased the beef broth from 1 1/2 cups to 2 cups as was suggested by some other reviewers.  Also....and this is important....I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  That was enough.  The meat, potatoes and carrots were all done perfectly.  The cooking time as is written in the recipe is too long.

This stew was pretty good, however, the cooking time I think was too long. My meat ended up kind of falling apart, and some of it even burned a little bit! In general though, a really good stew

I did brown the beef coated with flour in oil on the stove, added McCormicks Beef Stew to the crockpot, & added cornstarch at the end, but followed the recipe other than that.  The beef was tender & gravy was thick & flavorful.  Am going to add a variety of fresh mushrooms to the leftovers tomorrow & bake in a pie crust for a delicious pot pie.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This turned out quite good. I used the flour, salt and pepper to coat the meat and browned them in a bit of oil. I sauteed the onions and garlic, then added about 1/2 cup red wine, a tsp. of dried thyme and the meat back to the pot. Added the broth, covered and simmered for about 70 minutes, then added the potatoes, carrots and about 1/2 cup of frozen corn. Simmered another 30 minutes or so. Next time I put put everything into the slowcooker after browning the meat -- I think browning gives a richer flavor.

Excellent recipe.  I have made this twice already since receiving my new slow cooker for Christmas.  The second time, I tweeked it a little by adding 1/2 lb. more beef, adjusted the beef broth to 2 cups, added 1 cup of sliced white mushrooms, and 1 cup of frozen peas within the last 1/2 hour of cooking.  It came out perfect.

Very good I sauteed the beef in olive oil before adding to the slow cooker to seal in the goodness of the meat.  I also sauteed the onions.  I used beef broth and a red wine mixture and extra Worcestershire sauce.  I also added some quartered mushrooms to it. This tasted just like a Julia Child recipe I once spent a bunch of time making.  I would suggest trying pearl onions in this next time.  It is probably excellent as it is written also.

Made the recipe as instructed but increased wocestershire sauce to 1 TABLEspoon and omitted the celery.  Was super good!  Next time I think I'll leave out the onion and add dry onion soup mix instead.

What I liked best about this recipe is that it's simple. Just throw everything into the slow cooker and let it do its thing. I did not follow the more advanced recipe, and it came out excellent. Made a few tiny changes, I used 2 cups of beef broth, and one packet of McCormick's Slow Cooker Hearty Beef Stew seasoning instead of having to add all the individual spices. Left out the bay leaf. Towards the end of cooking, I stirred in 1/4 cup of garlic mashed potato flakes, which helped thicken the sauce and give it a "kick." Delicious, will make again.

I like the idea of not having to brown the meat first.  I always hate crock pot recipes that seem to make just as many dishes as if you are cooking a meal on the stove.  Tasty and easy.

I did this as is except added a dry onion packet. Near the end I tasted it and it needed some extra flavor. I added some steak sauce, more worch,basil,hot sauce,mustard, garlic salt and some peas. Also used a beef chuck roast and cut it up. This will be the only type of meat I use for this stew. It was so very tender and the stew was thick, which I love. Also only took 7-8 hours on low. Im still giving this 5 stars bec this is the only beef stew I will use from now on. Thanks so much.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because that is what my husband gave it.  The first time I made this recipe, I was fairly new at cooking and I followed Corinne's suggestions. The stew turned out EXTREMELY strong and the I didn't enjoy it at all.  These days, I follow this recipe to the letter and it is delicious every single time.  I highly recommend.

I'm sorry to say that this did not turn out anywhere near what I expected.  The meat turned into mush and there was little flavor.  My 7 year old wouldn't even eat it.

My husband and I used this recipe to try out our slow cooker for the first time. It was a great stew for a cold winter day. The only change I made was to add a little more broth (I nearly finished off the second can of broth). The flavors were wonderful, and the consistency of the meat and veggies were perfect. We cooked it on high for about 5 1/2 hours. We will definitely make this again!

Very yummy and good on a cold day.  I made it throwing it all in the crockpot and not cooking the meat in advance- it was so easy and very good.

Probably will try again. I was afraid it might be bland, so I added half a packet of McCormick's Beef Stew seasoning and increased the worc. sauce to 1T, as suggested by some of the others. This was a mistake; the stew came out way too salty. I also substituted 4 medium to large unpeeled red potatoes (which are about half the size of regular potatoes) cut into bite-size chunks. Their waxy texture means they hold up well in slow cooking and I thought the quantity turned out pretty much just right. Also I think my stew meat (which was lean) might have been overcooked at just over nine hours. Next time I will follow the recipe as written, except for substituting red potatoes, adding an extra carrot, and checking for doneness around seven or eight hours. If it is still salty, I'll know to switch to lower sodium broth.

Quick, easy, delicious.  Didn't brown meat. Cooked on High, done in 4 hours, as promised.  Thanks for a great easy meal! (Did add more liquid, but that's a personal preference.)

This turned out really well.  Good healthy, hearty meal.  Husband and I really liked it.  Just your basic beef stew.  Will try with organic beef broth if I can find it next time since I'm trying to cook to avoid the MSG and other hidden "goodies."

The best stew recipe I've been able to find here.  I always season the meat first then coat in flour before searing for a couple of minutes on each side.  This really helps lock in the moisture and makes for a super tender end result.

This is the exact recipe from my crock pot recipe book. Since I only give it 4 stars I was looking for the next best thing. It's made it through two marriages...I guess don't mess with it.  Sometimes I add corn and green beans or mess with the thickness.  Otherwise, take the credit and run!  :)

Scaled to 6 serving and it made a true 6. 

I listened to Corrine and added a packet of McCormick beef stew seasoning, Next time I will just leave it out, it made it thick and overly seasoned (until I added water). I couldnt see the reasoning behind making her other changes and over complicating things when the pot of crock pot recipes are to make quick and easy meals.

I did use beef broth in leiu of water for the original recipe, I think thats all I would change. And maybe add a splash of red wine. Great hearty, its cold outside kinda recipe.

I made this with Corrine's (10/2006) suggestions and my fiance' said "This is how beef stew should be...this blow's my mom's away!" So..it HAD to be good. 
Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make again.  Would have givin 5 stars, but since I didn't follow the recipe exactly I didn't think that would be a fiar representation. Served with 'JP's Big Daddy biscutis' from this site.

Fantastic base. I used a little less beef, loads of carrots, celery, potatoes, and onion. I really piled on the spices and added alot more garlic. Instead of black pepper I used cayenne, our fav. I also increased the flour to 3/4 cup because I wanted to make sure it was thicker. It was perfect. I thought I had beef broth and it was chix broth so I said to heck with it and used 2 cans of chix broth and a little water (bout a cup). This turned out perfect actually. The kind of recipe you can add or remove things easily and make it your own. We will have this again after the frozen leftovers run out. ;)

I used the auto calculator to double this recipe to serve 12 and followed it exactly using the 12-hr. on low heat option.  I like my stew juices gravy-like but this came out watery like soup. The liquid didn't even cover the meat & veges on top and lead them to become a little dry.  I also didn't like the flavor...it didn't taste like stew.  Perhaps doubling the recipe was the problem but I wasted quite a bit of time and money on this recipe that got flushed.  Will try another one.

Really great!!  I was hesitant to try because it looked so simple so i thought it would just be okay.  Well it was better than okay... it was really yummy!!  Because of the other reviews saying that it was a bit bland.... I tripled the garlic... added more salt and pepper.  it was great.  thanks!!

I was born and raised most of my young adult life in maine and I have been looking for a Beef Stew Recipe that was similar to what my Great Grandmother used to make (Very thick). The ones where, there was nothing written down and the stew always turned out great, and let me tell you this was the best one that I have ever came across and it was the closest to what my great grandmother used make.

I don't understand why everyone loves this recipe. I made it as is and it came out very boring and flat tasting. I had to add lots of salt/pepper afterwards to make up for the lack of flavor. I would follow Corrine's suggestions next time-coat the beef in flour, brown it and add seasoning- which probably gives it a nice richer flavor. I wanted to see if just throwing things in a pot would produce the same result as taking special preparations to enhance flavor, not surprisingly it doesn't. I'll be looking for a different recipe.

Finally a crock pot recipe for beef stew that tastes like what I make on the stove!  If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would do so!  My picky, picky DS even liked it!
  
I left out the celery as I don't like celery cooked with beef but did add an extra potato and extra onion.  I also coarsely cut the vegetables so they wouldn't over cook.  Near the last hour or so, I added 10 oz. frozen peas since I love peas in my beef stew.

Perfect crock pot beef stew recipe!

I read the reviews on this one, made the stew, and I have to say the reviews are pretty accurate. This is a good stew, but not the best. I added about a cup more broth and mushrooms. I am eating it right now a day after I made it, and it still needs more depth of flavor. Red wine, more spices...not sure what else. It's worth eating, but I'll try a different recipe next time.

Fantastic for stew.  I followed another review and added some red cooking wine and worcheshire sauce.  I also browned the meat with the flour mixture prior to adding it to the crockpot.  I think I will add some rice next time.

AWESOME!!!! We all loved this, including my toddler. Yum. I did brown the meat and deglaze the pan with beef broth and red wine before putting it in the slow cooker as some reviewers suggested, but other than that, I didn't change a thing. This was fantastic! Tender beef and a rich hearty flavor. Yum yum. This will become a staple around our house.

My edit after making a couple more times:  After a couple of hours in the slow cooker, I ladled out about 1/2 cup of the liquid into a measuring cup, stirred in a heaping Tbsp of cornstarch, and then stirred this mixture into the stew.  I've made this recipe twice now, once following Corrine's suggestions and once following the recipe exactly (except for doubling the Worcestershire sauce).  We MUCH prefer the original recipe, both for the taste and the convenience.  If you are looking for a great TRUE BEEF STEW recipe, this is the one!!

Stir well before serving if you haven't opened it all day. It changed my dinner from a soup to a real stew. :)
Also, don't trim too much fat off of your meat or you'll end up with a very dry stew. Two days later: This reheats well--I've eaten two days in a row for lunch. 3 stars for the first day, 4 stars for the leftovers.

Very tasty!  I added to the basic recipe with some of the suggestions other reviewers made.  My only tip is to add enough liquid to cover the ingredients (I have a large slow cooker and everything seems to dry out before the end of cooking time unless the food is covered in liquid).  A keeper, thanks!

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I used diced sirloin and omitted the celery because I was out (I can't imagine this would have saved this dish).  The sauce was very thin, so I added 1/4 cup of cooking Burgundy wine with 1 Tbsp of cornstarch disolved in it.  The sauce thickened beautifully.  I also added a few shakes of rosemary near the end.  The stew was SO bland!  My husband didn't think the sauce was dark enough (but I think that's because of all his Dinty Moore experience).  Anyway, I think it needed some serious tweeking to get a really rich flavor - I just thought it was lacking.  Sorry!

This was good, but make sure to add your spices at the very end.  Otherwise, they cook out and leave it pretty tasteless.

Absolutely phenomenal.  One of the best dishes I've made.  I added double the amt of worcestshire and paprika and added a little more broth.  The sauce came out nice and thick and the flavor was very intense.  Wonderful.

My husband said it was even better than his mom's beef stew!!  I used chili powder instead of paprika and I threw in some frozen mixed veggies toward the end which prettied it up a bit.  Yum yum yum.

I was really disappointed with this stew.  Maybe I goofed up, but there was so much oil in the broth.  It was floating on the top and very unappetizing.  The stew was rather bland as well.

4 stars because of the changes I made.  As others suggested, I browned the meat coated with a flour, salt & pepper, onion & garlic powder mix.  Added red wine, rosemary, thyme, and parsley, plus I added leftover baked sweet potatoe. I used beef bouillon instead of beef broth.  And I thickened with cornstarh.  Simmered on stove all day.  I used too much oil to brown my meat. I removed the excess oil with spoon as stew simmered during the day.  We ate the stew for supper the following day. It was delicious! A great comfort food we enjoyed after a day spent outside on a cool fall day.

This was so easy to do and so delicious.    I followed the recipe exactly - no changes.   The gravy became a bit thicker as it set and my other half told me that "this recipe is a keeper".

This is a good recipe to start your stew with but as others did, I added a lot to it in order to give it more flavor (cheated and used a stew mix). Before doing so I thought it was very bland. I also added green beans and corn and would have added peas if I had had them in my pantry. I left out the paprika since I don't care for it. I imagine this will be tastier as leftovers after the flavors have soaked in. :-)

This was an extremely good beef stew.  I added a 14 oz. can of stewed tomatoes for added flavor.  And, after it had cooked for about 5 hours, I noticed that the gravy was thinner than I wanted it, so I added 3 T. tapioca.  By the time I was able to serve dinner, it had cooked for a total of 12 hours....the meat was so tender that it was beginning to shred when I was dishing it out.  My husband had 2 large bowls.  Will definitely make this again.

This stew turned out wonderful! I put everything in my slow cooker and went out for the whole day, when I got back 11 hours later it was cooked perfectly. My husband isn't normally a fan of stews but he really enjoyed this. It tasted even better in toasted sandwiches the next day!

Everything was cooked thoroughly and the gravy turned out thick after I thickened it, but it was very bland. It was missing something, I'm not sure what. I think it I amde it next time i would add some HP sauce and maybe some tomato sauce, just to liven it up. Good base though.

Very tasty!I was out of potatoes and carrots,so I used a little Yankee Ingenuity and substituted summer squash and 2 cups of bread crumbs (unseasoned).Red meat upsets my gout so I used 2 cans of tuna(packed in water,not oil)and chicken broth.I would have given you 5 stars,but the stew was a little mushy.Maybe I used too much broth?! I hope this review helps.Keep up the good work!!

Made this for the first time, essentially as written, and am still stunned by how good it is.  Agree with a number of other reviewers that the recipe needs no tweaking at all to result in a rich and satisfying stew.  As a caveat, and to repeat others’ comments, this is a BASIC STEW, and succeeds at that spectacularly.  If you want to futz with technique and adding this, substituting that, go right ahead, but the glory of this is its simplicity.  Definitely a keeper.

This stew is old time classic comfort food and is delish just as written and the best part of this recipe is that you do not have to brown the beef first, that is a huge time saver and the beef turns out full of flavor and melt in your mouth tender without the fuss and extra mess of having to brown it first (I did choose to cook it on low for the longer time, I think that the long slow method rather than less time on high for things like stews makes a big difference and allows the flavors to fully develop). I like to make recipes exactly as written the first time and when I made this stew the first time it was excellent as is.  Subsequent times I have made this recipe I  added a can of diced tomatoes and used more black pepper and garlic than suggested but that is just a personal thing because I love tomatoes, black pepper and garlic.  In my opinion the sauce is thick enough as written, but if anyone wants the sauce a bit thicker, there are two simple ways to thicken the sauce, either use more flour to dredge the meat before cooking or about an hour before the end of the cooking time,  scoop out about 1/4 cup of the broth and  mix a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch into the broth until it is smooth and slowly stir the cornstarch/broth mixture back into the stew and continue cooking for the rest of the suggested time.  This is my go to beef stew recipe and I have been using it for years and everyone I have served it to loves it.

I made this stew tonight and it got a definite two thumbs up from my husband.   I used the method of flouring the meat first, browning it and then putting in the crock pot.  I added the leftover flour to the crock pot.   I also used a bit of the beef broth and 1/4 cup red wine to deglaze the pan and added it to the meat in the crock pot.  I added one additional garlic clove and used smoked paprika.  I only had one pound of the stew meat and used 2 potatoes and 4 carrots.  Towards the end of the cooking time I decided it needed a little more salt and pepper and approx. 1/2 tsp dried thyme.  I served it with freshly baked ciabatta rolls.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing.   (As a side note, rather than criticize when others tweak a recipe, I appreciate hearing different suggestions that other cooks make who have made about the recipe before I take a stab at it.)

After reading the reviews, I followed the recipe exactly as written ( except for the salt, which I omitted). My husband and son loved it and said it was absolutely delicious. I thought so too. Great weeknight dinner you can put in the crock pot and forget about. I’ll be making this again and again!

Followed the instructions as written, tempted by the ease of preparation and looking forward to a savory experience after work...what resulted was a watery, bland-tasting mess. After 10 hours on low, the meat had thoroughly cooked but since the recipe contains so little liquid added to the crockpot, not all of the potatoes or carrots cooked all the way. (Lesson learned, you need to make sure the veggies are covered in liquid too). However, had I added more liquid, I think the result would have been even MORE bland and watery. I tried to save it by picking out the par-cooked carrots and potatoes, and adding more seasonings and cornstarch to thicken up the watery consistency. I managed to get it somewhat edible, but still not great, or even passable.  If you even attempt this recipe, I suggest you follow the advice of some previous reviewers (I wish I had!) and brown the meat/saute the onion, garlic, and celery first, deglaze, and create some flavor. Also, this recipe needs more flour or some cornstarch or something so it doesn't come out so darn watery.  Stew is supposed to be thick and hearty, not watery and tasteless. Definitely could use some boullion,  seasonings, and more salt and pepper. Basically, you would need to make a whole new recipe to get this to work.

I made it just the way it is originally stated in the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing! I also did not brown the meat as some would suggest and the meat was tender and yummmmy! If you are going to tweak it then post as a new recipe  and many of us will probably try that one too :)

There seems to be a debate over Corrine's suggestions, so lets settle it.  Any experienced cook will tell you  browning the meat before it goes into the slow cooker caramelizes the proteins and adds a depth to the flavor that you simply can’t get just by letting it boil away in the cooker. It also toasts the flour so you don’t get that gluey flour flavor in the final thickened stew.  Also, deglazing  with port, wine, or ale adds so much flavor. Deglazing is a fancy word that means to pour  cold liquid into a very hot pan to get up all the brown bits stuck to the bottom. Those brown bits are where all the flavors are.  The extra prep time is worth it.  Good basic recipe--much improved with some work.

Delicious! I loved this recipe although I wish I had watched the video first.  There are some variations in preparation between the video and the written instructions. If I had seen the video, the consistency of my stew would have been better.

I made small tweeks by adding a small can of tomato paste, a tablespoon of Worcestershire, 1 tablespoon of dried parsley and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  (I'm not a pepper loving person.) I also put flour, salt, pepper, paprika in a baggie and threw the meat in to flour, as suggested by others.  I don't really know if my tweeks made a difference, the recipe is probably delicious on it's own.  NO BROWNING NEEDED, AT ALL! Love that part!  Oops, I also added 1 cup of frozen corn and 1 cup of frozen peas at the very end.

Since we need to follow Gluten Free cooking I made similar adjustments - came out great.  I used 2.5 lbs of chuck stew beef; kept the spice amounts the same; used 5 med potatoes; 8 med carrots.  used GF flour (King Arthur) approx 1 C; mixed with chicken/meat seasoning and garlic pepper - to taste - in a gallon plastic bag.  Added the beef to coat; browned in olive oil.  Added the beef broth (would increase amount to 2.5 C due to GF flour's high absorption tendency), minced garlic, paprika, Worcestershire sauce etc. to deglaze the pan beef was browned in.  Cook for approx. 2-3 min. - or enough time to loosen/scrape up all the browned beef bits.  Add to the crockpot and follow cooking times for either low or high temp cooking.

I love this recipe. It is so easy to make. I used to use a pre made mix, but this is so much better, and very easy to put together!

Very easy to make- very yummy to eat!  Prep did not take long at all, only required basic ingredients.  Makes a TON of stew- great for leftovers!  Would definitely make this again!

So easy to make.... I did not change a thing other than using 3 cloves of garlic and tossed them in whole.  I did not have 2LB of meat used what I had 1.6LB and also used 15 or more of the whole small baby carrots leaving only the potatoes and celery to dice.  I was going to add a splash of red wine but didn't have any.  Hubby said the "sauce was very tasty".  Made this before heading off to work.  Cooked on low for 11 hours and was wonderful.

This is a great base recipe for beef stew. My issue with the recipe is in the instructions.  If you makes it exactly as written, the stew will not thicken much since there will not be enough fat in the stew to make a proper roux.  I sauteed the beef and flour mixture in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and then added the onions to the mix, let them cook down a bit and added the garlic.  I then used some wine to deglaze the pan before adding the veggies, bay leaf, Worcestershire sauce and broth.  I also added a homemade stew seasoning to suit my family's tastes.  Since I don't have room for a slow cooker on my counters, I tossed the stew into a dutch oven and let it sit in the oven at 250 degrees for 8 hours.  It came out fantastic!

It was good but I felt it came out bland as written and so did my husband. We never salt our food after cooking but we had to with this recipe. I used a half bag of frozen mixed vegetables so maybe that diluted it somewhat...it was also kind of watery to me-more like a soup so I thickened it with 1/4 cup cornstarch. A decent basic recipe.

This is an excellent recipe being followed exactly as written. As most reviewers have stated, there is no need to brown the meat in a skillet first, it is excellent as is. Don't take chances on trying to tweak it and act like some professional chef like some of the others on here, it's outstanding just as written.

I didn't change anything. This is a nice recipe to have on hand to toss in the slow cooker and let do its own thing on a busy day. I prefer my mom's, but this is serviceable.

I tried to keep this receipt the same up until the end. It was too watery for my taste so I had to add 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it up. I also added frozen peas at the last 15 minutes. Not bad though, Will keep this for a base receipe and touch it up.

Just tried this & it's a winner with my family. I followed it exactly other than adding an extra 1/2 cup of beef broth because I had it. It was good as was but my husband loves a gravy base so put in a gravy mix after blending it with some of the broth. The beef was tender and didn't need pre-cooking which makes this recipe so easy. Will definitely make it again.

Loved this on a cold winter evening. Should have used a medium onion instead of a small one. Might try adding flavours others have suggested but it's great comfort food just as it is.

Fantastic! Perfect comfort food for a cold day here in upstate NY! Even the skeptical 13 year loved it and asked for more. I made this as the recipe said, no changes. Well, wait, I did dredge and pan fry the beef before I put it in the crock pot, old habit I guess. Next time I may add a little corn for a change.

I had to omit the celery but I added half a diced swede - magnificent stew; I'm so proud! For extra credit I added dumplings too. My wife had tears in her eyes as she licked the bowl clean.  Her smelly dog was denied the leftovers. Thank you so much!

I thought this stew was way to bland.  It needed more salt for sure but it also needed something else too. I gave it three stars because it was very easy to prepare but I don't think I will make it again.

Good, homey beef stew...not fancy.  Jack and I both enjoyed it but thought it could use more salt and a bit more flavoring such as garlic and maybe another spice like basil or thyme.  I did add one more potato and 1/2 cup more broth as some reviewers suggested.  Next time I'll add 1/2 cup red wine instead of the additional broth.

Very good! Super easy. I added three cloves garlic instead of 1, extra salt and pepper, and three total cups of broth instead of 1.5. I could have even put four cups and would been ok. 1.5 cups isn't enough unless you like the stew extremely thick. Thanks!

The only change I made was browning the beef first (personal preference, not necessary) and I used veggie broth because that's what was in the pantry.

I did what Corinne suggested, however could not find the "McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning". The red wine was the key, thanks Corinne!

Really easy and really good! I didn't use celery as the celery in my fridge looked too old and sad, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I will make this one again.

Delicious!!!! And easy! I've made this 2 ways. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. The second time I added 3 turnips because that's what I had in my fridge and omitted celery only because I didn't have any-again amazing. My husband and my 2 year old gobbled it up so much there is barely any leftovers.

We haven't technically eaten this yet, but I did a taste-test when I got home from work.  Yup!  Delicious!  I feel sorry that my dogs had to be home all day smelling this cooking; when I walked in the door the wonderful aroma hit me immediately.  I can not wait for dinner!  Some crusty rolls and this stew is going to be such a comfort on this chilly, rainy evening.

Just made this stew today and didn't change a thing.  Was a little nervous after reading some reviews about browning meat first but it came out great!  Everybody complimented me on it:O)  I just started to cook in my new Ninja slow cooker (which by the way is great) and this recipe is a keepsake.  You can't go wrong.

Some may not like this but I substituted moose for beef and..... Wow!!!!  Turned out great .  When I make this again I may try a few little tweaks of my own but it turned out great just the way it was written.

Loved the "throw it in the crock pot and forget it" thinking on this recipe.  The beef stew meat was tender and the sauce with the potatoes , carrots, green beans, and celery was thick. and creamy.   Not much of it left, now.  Friend came over, she sampled it and she loved it too.  Will save to cook again, but might have to make two pots.

This is my go to recipe for hectic days. I love that I do not need to brown the meat! I usually have it on low for 10 hrs. because of our schedule but it is always delicious.  We use less meat and more veg now to save money. I add 1 lb. stew beef, 3 lbs. potatoes, 2 lbs. carrots, 2 large onions, 5 stalks celery and 2 tsp. Worcestershire, plus a little more broth. This recipe freezes wonderfully. Thank you very much for this recipe!

This is very, very good. I had never made beef stew before seeing this recipe. This is now my go-to recipe! I like dumplings, though, so I mixed together Magpie's crockpot dumpling recipe and cooked them on top of the stew. Fantastic1

My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe...Just finished licking the crock pot! Even the anti-beef children ate it. I didn't have beef broth so used chicken and you couldn't even tell! I also only had a pound of beef so I used more carrots and potatoes and this was good for our veggie-lovin' family. I may cut down on the pepper or paprika next time as it was a little "hot," but even with that it was a definite keeper!! Thank you! Oh, and when I started I was tempted to add more broth, but I am glad that I didn't because when it cooked down it was just perfect!

Really Great Recipe! I added Mushrooms and peas (put the peas in closer to the end- abt 1 hr before finishing). I also just quartered about 6 or 7 baby red potatoes. Cooked on high for 4 hrs and it was delish!

I have been trying stew recipes for years and this one is best in my opinion. It is simple and quick, and you ONLY use the slow cooker. The only addition I make is a 15oz can of dieced tomatoes, hubbies preference.

I like that there is no browning of the meat no extra mess to clean up less fat ( no oil) this recipe tastes great all on its own. If you like more veggies add some more and a little extra water. I did substitute the beef broth (didn't have any) for 1 tsp chicken base to 1 cup water and it tasted divine.

I followed this recipe almost exactly and I liked it. I added 1 1/2 cup more beef broth to it because I like my stew a little on the soupier side and added an extra potato. I also had about 4 oz of low sodium V8 in the fridge that I added to it to give it some other flavor. (My dad always used to make it with tomatoes so I felt this was proper and it gave it just a tad bit of tomato flavor. not too much though. I did not peel the potatoes either as I like the skin. This made about 6-8 man sized bowls of stew and we had a whole wheat sweet roll on the side. I've also always found that putting close to a TB of A1 steak sauce goes a long way. I didn't do that with this one, but I will next time and maybe a 1/4 ts of celery salt or some MORE celery! :)

I live this recipe and make it almost every week for my family! I have tried many variations and suggestions such as browning the meat and adding red wine etc. I must say the simple recipe as is makes a delicious stew!! I always have to double my broth otherwise it is too dry, bit that May be due to my cheap slow cooker

I have always enjoyed this recipe for its simplicity. It's great to put everything together before work and have a wonderful stew at the end of the day. It's also versatile enough to withstand whatever changes you want to make. (As an aside, the problems I have with this site are: cooks who rate a recipe they have never made (except with a million variations) and recipes made with prepackaged additives and seasoning mixes aka not homemade.)

I used Corinne's suggestions, and this was AMAZING!  I found the time to be a little off; it was ready after 7 1/2 hrs on low.  I let it sit for another 4 hrs on "warm" and most of the beef was shredded by time we ate it, but it was still great!

Made for the first time tonight and it was great. Put in a 1/2 cup red wine and a couple extra TBSP Worcestershire. Was great and very easy will be making again. :)

Delicious just as written.  You can tweak this recipe to your own preferences, but it is also delicious if you follow the recipe as it is written.  And very simple to make!  Great for my family.  My husband loves it.  He was even raving about it to his coworker. I did add some peas when it was finished for added color. (so I guess I didn't do it exactly as written)

This was a huge hit with my family. I had prepped this the day before my son came home from college. Turned it on in the morning and so glad I did. By evening I had come down with a cold and was in no condition to cook. My husband brought me a bowl in bed (just what the doctor ordered), while he and my son served themselves. When he went for a second helping he found an empty slow cooker. My 19 year old son had eaten 4 helpings. Only thing I changed in the future was to reduce the amount of salt I added.

Delicious. Next time I'll use red potatoes with the peel still on, I'll use 2 cloves of garlic, & I'll cook it on low for at least 8 hrs.

I'm using this site more often and have been reading reviews that are critical of people's "adjustments" to the original recipe. Please - for people like Corinne, keep them coming! I would much rather have positive, critical feedback and suggestions on improving the dish instead of just rating the recipe saying that "it's dull or didn't have flavor." 

I'm not a big fan of stew to begin with, but this turned out well and if you like stew, those few suggestions would be my way to go.

This is my favorite ever beef stew, and one I have made repeatedly. In fact, I've made it so often that friends will request it. I have got this down to a science: 1) I always just buy the cheapest meat at the cheapest store. This adds some more prep work, as I cover it with tenderizer and flour and then brown it, but I'm okay with that because it means I save money and the meat is still deliciously tender. 2) I like to add a few more spices (generally just some basil/oregano) 3) Also, this is the perfect place to use your left over veggies. My fave is to add zucchini or yellow squash when it's available and I got some left. I cut 'em into crescents. So good!

I loved LOVED this recipe. I made half of the portions and it all turned out amazingly. The only thing I would change is that I would add a bit more salt (then again, I used reduced sodium beef broth). I didn't brown it or anything and I felt it was perfect as is. The meat was really tender and all the flavors worked so well together. I am excited to keep using my crock pot! I added the same amount of flour and it did thicken near the end when I let it cool a bit. Simply delicious--and the smell was amazing! Fantastic with fresh baked rolls.

It's great.  I kept it exactly as written.  I don't get it why people rate a recipe after they've made a million changes to it.  This recipe is wonderful because of it's simplicity.  If you're adding wine, a packaged stew mix, etc., etc, it's NOT the same recipe.

Really good, really easy. No need to brown the meat. I added potatoes and carrots. The potatoes were still undercooked 12 hours later (????) so next time I am going to serve with mashed instead. Carrots were yummy!

This Beef Stew was OUTSTANDING and deserves more than 5 stars.  I followed recipe as is, but added extra garlic (we love garlic).  The aroma filled the house.   I used 3 lbs of stew meat increasing the other ingredients and cooked on low for 8 hours and then on high for 2 hours.  My husband raved about it and I cannot wait to have the leftovers.

I think this recipe is well written as is. Sure you can brown the meat and yadda, yadda yadda. For me, the point is slow cooker, put in the ingredients, turn on, walk away. I have three children mind you. I could see adding a splash (half a cup or so) of red wine if I had a bottle open but other than that I'm sticking to this yummy, hearty, comforting stew recipe. I cut back to a half stock of celery for personal preference. Left overs were wonderful too!

GREAT BASIC RECIPE!  I have been making it consistently for 4 years, adding in vegetables that I have on hand.  It is always delicious.  This is the only stew recipe I know of with good results without browning he meat first, a huge plus and time saver.

Great stew for a cool evening. I serve with garlic bread and put shredded cheese over the top, as well as a little tabasco sauce. Rather than diced potatoes, I just cut them in bite-sized pieces. Diced suggests a breakfast cut. Great flavors!

This was really good as-is. I may add red wine for depth of flavor next time. I will use more broth as well as there was very little liquid when it was done.

Very nice recipe, thank you for sharing. Simple instructions,and I enjoyed making this stew in little time..Sure, at one point I had to include my own ingredients because I threw in a bit too much salt, which I fixed by adding an entire can of peas- with the liquid. Good balance.. I thought this was just delicious and filling. A must have.

I have attempted stews over and over.. Browning the beef, adding fancy schmancy ingredients and wine. I always end up unsatisfied with a sink FULL of dishes! This recipe was PERFECT!! It literally look my 15 minutes to prep! One dish (belng the crock pot bowl), measuring spoon, and measuring cups! Clean up was a breeze, beef was so tender, and the flavour was oh so yummy! I added a few squirts of ketchup about an hour before eating and it was a hit! Super easy and delicious for even a terrible cook like me :)

Solid base recipe. I did all the chopping the night before, so all I had to do in the morning before work was combine and stir. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to tailor to individual tastes, but it is very simple and good as is.

The recipe is wonderful! I made this beef stew for the first time tonight, and my husband loved it. I put the stew meat in a bowl, and coated it with flour. Since we like lots of vegetables, I added two stalks of celery instead of one. Instead of garlic cloves, I added two tsp of granulated garlic. I also added 1 1/2 can beef broth, which was just enough to cover all the ingredients in the crock pot. I saved the rest of the beef broth, and I'm glad I did, as I needed more liquid for the leftovers. i just added the rest of the broth to the remaining stew. We also had a salad and corn muffins to complete the meal. I'll be making this stew over and over again! THANKS!

I was looking forward to making this for days, and when I finally made it, I was super disappointed! It was so bland and it was not a stew at all! It definitely needs a huge southern touch to save this recipe.

Fantastic. I took some advice from other reviewers (but I did not brown the meat or deglaze). 

I used 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce (instead of 1 teaspoon), used a whole can of swanson's beef broth (which is a little more than 1.5 cups), added mccormick's beef stew seasoning mix, used 2 bay leaves instead of 1, added a couple of cloves of garlic, and threw in the rest of a good bottle of red wine I had (probably 5 oz or so) that I wanted to use before it got vinegary. 

I cooked it on high for 2 hours and low for 5 hours (just because I didn't have time to wait 10 hours on this particular day). 

Served with Grandma VanDoren's bread, from this site.

Exceptionally delicious and tons of compliments. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Made this today, and it was delicious!  Only changes made were adding 1/3 cup red wine, and about 1/4 tsp salt.  Added these about 1 hour before serving, and added both to taste (after 5 hours with slow cooker on hi).

Mmm, eating leftovers now for lunch and it tastes even better....I followed the recipe as written except I doubled the spices per the reviews and served over egg noodles.  Even my kids gobbled it up!!  I picked this recipe because of the pure simplicity of it, no browning, no extra pans to clean and I had most of the ingredients already.  As much as I love reading the reviews, I don't get how reviewers can give this 5 stars when they are practically changing the recipe-browning, adding wine, beer, buying a packet of beef stew mix???   I thought this was Beef Stew by Buchko not by Corrine and it's a great simple stew recipe without all those additional ingredients/steps...Thanks Buchko, this will be a new staple at our house!

Simple and yummy, but add some salt for more flavor (or maybe it was not salty enough because I used reduced-sodium broth). Great comfort food for a cold day, great with cheddar biscuits (recipe from this site). Preschoolers thought it was "OK", my hubby and I liked it.

Stew was good, but I truly think it needs a packet of Mc Cormicks
beef stew seasoning. the meat & vegies are great. The Broth is bland
and I made it as written.

Followed Corinne's version exactly and stew was excellent.  I find most basic slow-cooker recipes to be bland, so the additions were just right.  Our only problem was there was barely enough to serve six really hungry adults after a day of skiing.  I'll double it next time.

This was simple and delicious!!  Only made two small changes, I don't eat red meat so I used pork butt and I was out of Worcestershire so I used soy sauce. I used baby yukon gold potatoes and added more celery then the recipe calls for.  Cooked in the crockpot on high for 5 1/2 hours and it was perfect!

Was looking for a beef stew recipe, and this one was pretty fantastic!  Followed the recipe exactly as written, but threw in some mushrooms as well.  Even with all the spices, I personally found it a little bland.  I just added a little bit of pepper and garlic salt into my own bowl, and let others season to their own preference!

Huge success. Made this tonight - as written except I didn't use two pounds of the beef because I only had three people eating dinner. The biggest complaint I got was that I didn't make enough. They ate it all and used bread to wipe the gravy off their plates.

This was a great recipe.  Now, I didn't have bay leaves so I didn't add that and I don't do celery, cooked anyways.  I added more potatoes and added just a bit more broth.  Turned out great.  What I liked is that I didn't have to cook my meat ahead of time.  Just bought stew meat and tossed it in.  Yay!  Ha.

We really liked this.  Just changed a couple things.  Followed others' recommendations and used 1 tablespoon Worcestershire and Lawry's instead of regular salt.  Then I added 1 cup of beer as some said it was too think.  A bit too much pepper for our taste - will reduce next time.

This is incredibly delicious beef stew. I made it for my entire family and we all loved it. The only thing I will warn about is that the pepper is strong, so if you aren't a fan of pepper, put in less. 

I will be making this again this fall. Can't wait!

The meat was flavorful but overcooked. The potatoes and carrots were a pasty, mushy mess. Next time I shortened the cooking time to 8 hours and added the potatoes and carrots at the 6 hour point. Much better!

This has become a family favorite.  The flavor is great.  We like to add extra veggies.  After cooking so long the meat is perfectly tender creates a thick sauce to coat it.

put two frozen 2.5 pound pot roasts in the slow cooker this morning before work - threw all the ingredients on top (forgot the onion) and it was perfect after 7 hours on low. The meat held its form, but was pulled easily apart with a fork. It was very tender and juicy. The veggies were cooked perfectly - not mushy or overly cooked. Will cook again and again! Awesome recipe!

I love using my slow cooker, particularly because I like to make my lunches for the whole week on Sunday.  This is a great one - also consider adding fresh parsley and throw in a splash of red wine into the broth.  Makes a filling yummy lunch.

Excellent recipe made a couple small changes...
Decreased paprika to 1/2tsp - kids found it too spicy, sometimes I leave it out all together. Followed other suggestions of seasoned salt vs. regular salt, 2-3 garlic cloves (fresh), 2 bay leaves - I omit celery and use 2 regular potatoes and 2 sweet potatoes, I add in a packet of brown gravy mix and just eyeball the beef broth probably use about a 1/2 carton...kids love it!

This is AMAZING stew! It is going in the regular rotation in our family, especially in the colder months. And who doesn't love the ease of a crock pot meal? I also followed Corinne's suggestions (thanks Corinne!) with two minor changes. I didn't have any stew seasoning packets on hand so if you find yourself in the same predicament use the spices in your cupboard. I did 2-3 shakes of each of these, garlic powder, onion powder, rosemary (one shake cuz it's not my favorite), celery seed, oregano, basil, and more generously on the paprika (smoked) since the original recipe called for it. I also added the juice of half a lemon, increased the salt to 1tsp, and used more celery because I particularly like it in a stew. Make this today! Pretty sure that you won't be disappointed.

This recipe was amazing! It was my first time making stew of any kind, so for newbies, the slow cooker is definately the way to go. I followed the recipe as it is and only made one change, I added a can of diced tomatoes. It turned out lovely!

Made this the other night after searching for a good stew recipe and loved it! Will definantly put this in the keep pile and make it again. Very easy and loved how it was in the crock pot. Think 10 hours was just enough.

Yum! We made just a few adjustments. We left out the bay leaf, added oregano, half a can of peas, half of a jalapeno (without seeds), 2 beef bouillon cubes, a 8 oz can of tomato sauce and a 14.5 oz can of garlic and basil diced tomatoes. It came out great! We will add the whole jalapeno next time as we like spicy!

First time I made this I used suggestions from the comments... not very happy with those results. Second time and further on I followed the recipe as listed and it came out delicious.

Very bland. This required some serious seasoning to actually taste like anything. It was decent base for beef stew I guess, but there are better recipes.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought this was just okay. I ended up having to add a lot of seasoning because as it was, it was too bland. I threw in some leftover corn, too. It was easy, so I might revisit the recipe and make some tweaks if I have some stew meat that needs to be used up.

I enjoyed it but in terms of flavor I wouldn't say it was dead on. I improvised with considerably more Worcestershire sauce7-8 TBSPs and creole seasoning and red pepper at the end. Next time I will add more celery and carrots

I give it 5 stars for taste and comfort, but since I'm lazy, it gets 41/2 stars for ease of prep.  I hate cutting vegetables.  However, I was given the suggestion of substituting frozen gnocchi for the potatoes to save time.

Very tasty.  Mine was a little more thin than thick.  In addition to adding more than the suggested amount of veggies, I also added one large sweet potato.  Mine was done in six 1/2 hours on low.

Very good and hearty beef stew. The broth came out nice and thick and the meat was very tender along with the vegetables. Lots of flavor. Great meal for a cold winter day!

My family really enjoyed this. They said it was the closest thing I've made called stew that was actually a down home real beef stew. Guess they don't like my twists on stew, but I'm glad they like this one. I will increase the pepper a bit next time and omit the bay leaf as they didn't like the taste (I did add a couple, so maybe it was too much.) I did mix the flour, salt and pepper with the beef and browned the beef a little first. I will also increase the broth to maybe 3-4 cups next time as the meat and veggies really soaked it up and we like at least a little broth. Also, it may just be my crock pot, but I think 7-8 hours would do the trick because after 9, everything was very cooked and the meat was falling apart.  So a few tweaks and this will be my go to Beef Stew recipe.

This was ok, nothing outstanding.  Could have used some tweaking.  I added a cornstarch slurry and it was til a bit soupy rather than stewy.

This stew has great flavor and the meat was so tender from being in the slow cooker all day.  It was a bit thick for my taste and wasn't heavy enough on the veggies.  Next time I'll use more broth, veggies and potatoes, but I will definitely make again!

Yum. I used a roast that I dredged in flour and browned in a skillet first.  Deglazed the pan and added that in too.  I also used a packet of McCormick beef stew seasoning.  Used red potatoes with the skin on, carrots and no celery since I didn't have it. At the end, I sauteed mushrooms in a little butter and added them to the crock pot.  Then, shredded the meat.

Very good and much better than the stew I usually make with the seasoning packet.  I did brown my meat first and, unfortunately, didn't have Worcestershire sauce on hand.  My family has asked that this become a regular in meal rotation.

This recipe was PERFECT! I like more juices, so I used 3 c. beef broth and 1 c. water. However, you really don't need to change anything - it's easy, like a slow cooker recipe SHOULD be! No precooking, just throw it in the pot and go!

I thought this was a wonderful beef stew, and so easy. The only thing I did differently was add some peas and corn for color and a tablespoon of worchester sauce. Flavorful, easy, what could be better?

This was the best stew I've ever had.  I don't like food with alot of stuff going on it it.  So having this was really good.  My husband made it and it was done by the time I got home and when I walked in the door it smelt so good.  We didn't have any celery so that didn't get added, but it's ok cause my kids probably wouldn't of ate it with the celery.  This will for sure be another make in my house.

I made the stew using Corinne's tweaks with the exception of browning the meat.  I just put the meat straight from the ziploc bag into the slow cooker.  I  also used an eye of round roast which happened to be on sale at my grocery store.  It was phenomenal.         The meat was so tender.  I will be making this
 again!!

Excellent! I used 2 lbs. cubed sirloin beef covered with 1/2-3/4 cup of flour, 1 medium onion-sliced and slivered, 2 cups baby carrots, ~2 cups chicken broth (I didn't have beef broth), 1 large sweet potato sliced thinnned & diced, 1 cup diced peppers, ~ 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce, ~2 tablespoons of garlic powder, 1/2-3/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, ~2 teaspoons of of dry mustard, ~2  tablespoons of yellow mustard, ~1/2-3/4 cup of brown sugar, salt and pepper dashes, I probably would have added some celery, rosemary or bay leaves if I had some (next time!)...mix it all together in the  pot, and turn on high for 4-5 hours, or let it simmer longer for ~12 hours. Strange combination of ingredients, but it works! It's really very good and low carb too! Freezes well!

I made this recipe as written. It was very thin. I like stew to be thick. My mother-in-law actually had two bowls, which she usually only eats one helping of anything I make! She obviously enjoyed the flavor. I thought it had a nice flavor, hence 4 stars, but I either will keep looking or attempt to tweak this a bit more. The meat was perfect.

Tweaked this recipe by adding Gravy Master until the gravy was a rich brown, also used a electric chopper for the onions and celery. Didn't have fresh garlic so used granulated garlic - 2 tspns. and used frozen mixed vegetables in place of the carrots. Smelled delicious and my husband did a taste test, oh he that doesn't eat beef stew, because it smelled so good..now after 30 years, repeat 30 years he is going to eat beef stew...so thank you Buchko!

Excellent!  I made a gluten-free version by replacing the Worchestershire sauce with cider vinegar and sugar, and using GF flour instead of regular.  Turned out wonderful.

I find the stewing beef in my town to be tough, regardless of how long or slowly it's cooked. So I use higher quality beef. I also use beer for 1/2 the liquid. Also use 1/2 tsp. Dried thyme. Great!

Great stew recipe! I followed others' recommendations and browned the beef and the onions before placing in the slow cooker. I used  double the amount of beef stock (I guess I like my stew kind of soupy) and lots of Worcestershire sauce. I doubled the bay leaf and fresh garlic, and added some garlic power, onion powder and dried basil.

I have made several recipes of beef stew, but this is the first one my husband liked. He usually turns up his nose at beef stew. But this time he was actually a bit put out when there werent any leftovers! I made it exactly as submitted with only one minor exception: I had to add a cup of water to it or it would have been entirely too dry. The smell of it cooking all day was divine!

This recipe was so easy, and turned out well.  I needed to lower the sodium content, so I omitted the salt and used low-sodium Worcestershire sauce, and it still tasted good!

This was good, but there was way too much meat in it for my taste, and I used closer to 1.5lbs rather than 2.  Next time I would use absolutely no more than 1, if not less.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added red wine; I would probably add more next time to give more liquid to the stew.

This was delicious & oh so easy!! I made it exactly as written. I put the flour, salt & pepper in a zip lock bag & shook the meat up in it so it was evenly coated. Then put it in the slow cooker with the veggies (left out celery cause my hubby hates it & we didn't have any) I used way more garlic than called for cause I love it & used 1 TBSP worcestershire sauce & added 1/2-1 cup of red wine....also used a full 32oz beef broth cause it seemed like it needed it. An easy great dinner cooked on low for 6 hours! Great meal with salad & fresh bread!!!

This is really a good recipe...easy to make and very flavorful. If you're on a gluten-free diet, substitute Gluten-Free Bisquick for the all-purpose flour. You might want to use a little more liquid...next time I make it I'll increase the total liquid to 2 cups. This time it was delicious!

I made this last night with some changes and it was so yummy. I added 1/4 cup of red wine and increased the worchester to 4 tsp. Also added the pkg of McCormicks Beef Stew Seasonings.  My husband said it was very good and will go in the keep recipe box. The meat was so tender and fell  apart. Thank you for a great recipe and my first attempt at Beef Stew was a success!!!

YUMMY!! husband who refers to beef stew as dog food actually loved it and the leftovers!!! I knew I could cure him!!  Only suggestion is next time I'll add more carrots,onions, and celery, everyone said there wasn't enough. And I did use more beef broth and an extra potatoe (due to their size)than listed. Will definitely make it again and it was the first time I used a slow cooker!!!!!

I was quite disappointed in this recipe given the high rating.  The flavour is too bland, definitely lacking  spices.  I doubled all of the spices towards the end and it was still lacking something.  There are some much better stew recipes out there.  I wouldn't recommend trying this one.

Followed the recipe perfectly but made it in the pressure cooker instead of a slow cooker. Worked perfectly. We used a shoulder steak cut up which turned out very tender. Husband LOVED it and we will definitely be making this again.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I didn't give it a 5 because I am always looking for that recipe that gives it a little bit of a twist on flavor. Something I might not have thought of. Overall this recipe was great. Both my daughter and husband had 2nd and 3rds! Nothing beats a slow cooker meal on a winter work night!!! I will make again

I seared the beef first (seasoned with salt and pepper) then sauted a cup full of diced onions, celery and carrots in the same pan (after meat was taken out and put in the crock pot).  Added this to the  crock pot. Deglazed the pan with some of the beef stock.  Added that to the crock pot.  Then I added the rested of the ingredients to the crock pot.  (I didn't flour the meat, I added some flour at the end (mixed with some cold water - used about a teaspoon to thicken it).

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I had to add more beef broth and water. But other than that it was amazing.

Good, simple.  I browned the meat with the garlic first and then added everything to the slow cooker.  I found the sauce to be a bit thin.  Other then that, nice recipe.  Thank you.

This is a wonderful old fashioned tasting, non-tomato based stew which is even better the next day.  It is good as written, but can be tweaked to suit various tastes.  Some cooks like adding a tsp. of sugar and a pinch of allspice to stews with additional broth. Thanks for sharing.

This is a wonderful stew, just as directed. My family loves it. Now that I've made it a few times, I've added more garlic cloves, to our taste, and I coat the meat in 2 tablespoons of kitchen bouquet, before dusting it with flour, and add more beef stock or water with beef boullion. I've also made it with 2 white potatoes and 1 sweet potato, but honestly, the recipe is wonderful as written. Thanks for sharing.

The missing thing that people mention is spice, specifically salt.  The potatos soak up all the seasoning, and leave the broth 'limp'  I fixed it by throwing in 3 beef bullion cubes in the last half hour.

12/10.. Increase flour to 1/3 cup,add some paprika too,used 3 lbs beef. Put flour mixture into bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 2 tablespoons olive oil and a little butter until browned. Near the end Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker or tupperware. Mix beef broth with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker.Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning. I did it on a friday(except veg), put in fridge until sat. am(add veg and a can of tom. soup)...very tender.  30 min high and then 6 hrs. low, i added mushrooms in last hour and needed to turn the hear up to high.

I'm a little confused about how to rate this recipe. It wasn't quite as good as my normal stove top recipe, HOWEVER, it took me a total of 11 minutes to put together.  So if I could give it a 4.5, I would. Followed the recipe except I left out the celery because we don't like cooked celery. Will definitely make again.

Great comfort meal for cold night!  Although some reviews recommend browning the beef before this is unnecessary - part of the great thing about the recipe is the simplicity, the no pre-cooking part!  I added half a package of dry onion soup mix but I don't think it really added anything so would make again just as is.  Also added some green peas.

Delicious and super easy!!  I put my beef in the Crock Pot still frozen, omitted the bay leaf, did half the beef and double the veggies, and used a little bit more chicken stock than what it called for and this turned fabulous!!  The flavor was wonderful and coming home from work and smelling this was the perfect way to end my day.  It literally took me under 10 minutes in the morning to make this and then once I got home I popped a few frozen dinner rolls in the oven and dinner was finished!  I can't recommend this recipe enough.

Excellent meal!  I prepared exactly the way suggested and it was great.  Its very easy just putting in the meat without cooking and it still came out very tender.  I cooked on high for 5-6 hrs.  If you cook for that long, I would suggest checking it often so it doesn't dry out.  This is a definate keeper for the menu.

Some things don't have to be unusual or fancy to be great. This is a comfort food, a hearty one that I grew up on. The only thing I did different was I added a packet of McCormick beef stew seasoning.

My favourite!  This is one we make often.  I follow the recipe for the most part, but add one tablespoon of Bisto right at the beginning.   I also omit the potatoes, and serve it on top of mashed potatoes.  This way you can add more meat and veggies if you want to, or make it in a small crock pot, which we used to have, and not worry about running out of room.  Enjoy!  Thanks for sharing Buchko!

We enjoyed this.  Based on other reviewers I was going to add a package of Beef Stew seasoning and didn't have it so I jused a package of Lipton Onion soup mix instead.  I also doubled the Worcestershire, added 1/2 tsp. each of garlic powder and onion powder and added 1 tsp. of kitchen boquet.  I mixed 1 Tbsp. cornstarch and 2 Tbsp. water together and stirred into the stew before the last hour of cooking to let it thicken up.  We will make this again as it the meat was very tender and tasty.

Excellent and EASY!  Loved it!  I added sweet potatoes in addition to the white potatoes and it gave the stew a very nice rich buttery flavor.  If you like your stew with lots of kick/spice add more than the recipe calls for, but if you like a nice smooth stew this is fantastic as it is.  Best Stew I have made in Years!

Total Yum! I was a tad surprised how much this hit the spot! Perfect and tasty! Made exactly as written. I personally thought it needed a little more salt but I also believe that salt is a personal preference thing and should be added to ones meal and not the whole dish! So good! I can't wait to have it again! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly except for adding 1 can of French Onion soup (liquid) in the last half of cooking.    It was delicious!    I did not mess up any pots (except the crock pot itself) and I love that.    I just eyed the spices/flour but my gravy was thick and brown and just perfect.    So easy to make and forget!

I prepared Beef Stew tonight, and it was fantastic. I did not change a thing, and my husband wanted seconds.

Update 10/5/11
This was great stew; my husband gave me thumbs up, which means it good. I did changes thing around though.  I floured the cut up meat, and brown the meat in olive oil. I placed all the vegetables in the bottom of the slow cooker and added the browned meat on top. I used 1 ½ cups of water, instead of beef broth, turn it on high and cooked it for five hrs. Oh one other thing I omitted the Worcestershire sauce.

Great recipe! I increased the garlic to 3 cloves and worcestershire to 1/4 cup.... it turned out fantastic. I would recommend using fresh carrots and not frozen... I usually use frozen carrots in recipes like this for convenience, but using fresh this time was a good move! The flavors really came out, and the dish was very homey and comforting.  The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I would say that this is a great basic recipe, but it wasn't Extraordinary to me and didn't have something that made it over-the-top. But this is a recipe I will make again, it was very easy and pleased everyone!

Fantastic! The flour/salt mixture for the stew meat really did the trick, the meat browned quite nicely. -We ate it in bread bowls... Delicious!

This was very tasty but it needed to be a little thicker.  Next time I will use more cornstarch to remedy that problem.  I used season all salt, used 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, added 1/2 cup red wine per other reviewers, frozen peas and added a dash of Kitchen Bouquet.  Cooked on HI for 4 hours and turned to LOW until ready to eat.  Great meal for a cold rainy or wintry day.

I doubled this for an American Legion county meeting tonight. It was a big hit, and didn't last long. I served it with fresh Italian bread from the grocery store. I only made minor substitutions. I used baby red potatoes and pearl onions whole instead of chopping larger ones. The only thing I will do different next time is add more meat.

The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup of red wine. Why mess with perfection? My family loved this savory dish that tasted like a good home cooked meal from back home in Ireland. I made whole wheat soda bread to complete this wonderful dish. You could sub Guinness for the broth and really transport yourself to the Emerald Isle!

I made this stew as written with the exception of dried onion instead of fresh (I hate chopping onions). Because of this, the stew was dry but I think regardless it could use a bit more liquid as I prepared the stew late in the evening and by morning, half the stew was stuck to the crockpot! : ( Would add and extra half cup of beef stock and half cup of water next time. Was still edible and in fact delicious so the recipe's a keeper - just be sure to add more liquid if making overnight (note: was on low for 12 hrs).

I think the key is having the time to cook this as suggested--I realized that 10 hours was not going to do it (I rarely have luck w/ potatoes in my crock pot, no matter how diced they are) so I put mine in my dutch oven on the stove.  Perhaps next time I will start this before going to bed, and it should be good and ready by afternoon the next day!

Great base recipe.  My wife and kids love it!  Here's what I did differently:  Beef - Covered a 3.5 lb roast in Kosher salt for 1 hour.  Washed off salt, sprinkled with garlic powder and pepper and broiled the beef at 500 degrees for 25 minutes, then shut the oven off and left the beef in there for another 2 hours.  Unbeatable for tenderness and juicyness.  We had this for dinner.  The next day I used the remaining beef (about 2 lbs) for the stew.  I used the base recipe but doubled the ingredients and removed the celery (can't stand the stuff).  I also added mushrooms, diced tomatoes, and a packet of brown gravy.    I have done this before using pork instead of beef (prepared the same way) and I was amazed at the tenderness of the pork.  It literally melts in your mouth.  Give it a shot one of these days!

We really enjoyed this!  It was a lot better than any beef stew we have made in the past.  One great thing about it (to us) is the recipe does not call for tomatoes!  I added one extra potato & an extra carrot for good measure. I may add an extra couple of carrots and more celery the next time as well because it was still very meaty.  (However my husband did not complain ;)  I also added a pack of McCormicks Stew seasoning and maybe 1/4-1/2 cup more of the beef broth.  We will be making this again!  ::::UPDATE:::: I made this recipe again and instead of using the McCormicks Stew Seasoning (I was out) I used a pouch of dry onion soup- big mistake the onion flavor was WAY overpowering and you couldn't taste any of the other vegetables or seasoning!  I have seen alot of the reviews for this recipe saying it has a lack of flavor and the first time I made this recipe (when I used the McCormicks) I couldn't believe that!  After trying this recipe with out it I now know that's where all the good flavor is coming from (NOT from the original recipe's seasoning).  So using the McCormicks Stew Seasoning IS A MUST!  Also I was out or worcestershire and used 2 tbs of A1 steak sauce (didn't quite like it as much but it worked in a bind).  I am only giving it 4 stars for the original recipe as written but with these changes it is definately 5 stars!

Made this for dinner tonite.  I followed Corinne's suggestions in her review and it turned out great.  I browned the beef, cut up potatoes and carrots used the McCormick beef stew seasoning and threw everything in the crockpot at 9:30pm last nite and this morning it was ready.  I put the stew in a corningware dish and refridgerated and at dinner time heated it up by the bowlful in the microwave.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I scaled this down to 3 servings since I had just over 1 lb of stew meat.  I did as one reviewer suggested by adding the flour and seasoned salt in a bag, toss the meat, then brown before adding to crock pot.  I used homemade veggie stock (instead of beef) and a little sherry to the sauce.  Kept everything the same and turned out good.  I felt like there was something missing from the dish but my husband and I were very satisfied with the dish.  My kids wouldn't eat it though.

This was wonderful. I made it exactly as written (minus the celery because I can't stand it, and I used 1/4 tsp of steak sauce with a dash of soy sauce because I didn't have worcestershire sauce). I added too much liquid at the beginning because 1.5 cups just did not look like enough. I'm glad I did though because I was able to add some potato flakes about 20 minutes before we ate and the stew got thicker and creamy, which I think made this dish. We thought this was wonderful. We both had seconds and only have a bit left over - even though I made the entire recipe! Thanks!

I loved this recipe. I am looking for good slow cooker recipes right now to make while I am working and thought I would try this one. I haven't ever found a beef stew recipe I liked but the ratings and reviews made me curious.  I left out the paprika, since I didn't have it in my pantry, but otherwise made it exactly as written. It was a hit with everyone in our house...all seven of us! I will make this one again. Thank you for sharing :)

This is my go to stew. In fact, I cant believe I have never reviewed it. I have made this stew many times. The only part I change is I use water and beef bouillon and red wine (eye) for the broth. This soup hits the spot on those chilly winter day/evenings.

This stew turned out well.  It has a good flavor.  But it was a bit low on broth/gravy for me.  So I added an extra cup of beef broth with a teaspoon of flour mixed in and it was just right.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I don't actually have a slow cooker, so instead I simmered it on the stove on low heat. I didn't bother to flour the meat and since I used water instead of stock, I had to add some additional salt. Also, sometimes I will use sweet potatoes in place of white ones because I like the sweetness that it give the whole dish, and the extra nutrients are a plus.

This was sooooo yummy.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and dredged the beef in flour, browned it, and then deglazed the pan with the broth and a cup of red wine.  WOW!  Both of my picky eater kids loved it.

Not impressed with flavor.  Also, too many potatoes.  But... you can easily modify spices and ingredient ratios to your taste.

I followed the advice to use beef stew seasoning instead of individually adding spices, and I skipped the garlic, only because I didn't want to smell like garlic at work.  It was SO easy and SO fabulous!  Absolutely perfect stew with very little effort.

Fantastic stew! I made it with a packet of McCormik beef stew mix and some red wine. But other than that I followed the recipe. I will make this again.

Quick and easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe very closely, except made things even easier by shaking up all dry ingredients with meat in plastic bag, and then combining the "wet" ingredients and pouring over the veggies and meat in pot.  Might add additional spices next time for a bit more flavor, but fine as is... Great for a cool fall evening!!

We made some of the other suggested changes (added extra flour, 1/2 cup red cooking wine, an extra bay leaf, and a little extra Worcestershire) & really enjoyed the stew.

This was the first time I ever used my slow cooker AND the first time I ever made stew!  I was very impressed with the results I got from this simple recipe!  It tasted delicious, and although I made a few subtle changes, I kept the spices the same and I was surprised at the amout of flavour I got! The only change I made was substituting some of the potato for some sweet potato... I like to use them whenever I can!  And I cooked the onions and beef a little before putting it into the slow cooker, JUST to be on the safe side!  Other than that, perfect recipe for a cold blustery day!

Awesome beef stew!  I didn't change the recipe much.  I added a couple splashes of red wine and some rosemary (yum!).  I used red potatoes so they would keep their shape.  So easy to just throw it all in the slow cooker and 6 hours later, you have a warm and comforting dinner!  I served these with French Bread Rolls To Die For from this site and it was an incredible meal.

What a great stew for those cold evenings!  YUM!  The meat turned out moist, tender and flavorful.  My family couldn't stay out of it!  I have already been asked to make it again!!  I chose to use a roast and shred it before serving.  I coated the meat with a mix of flour, garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper.  I browned it on all sides prior to placing in crock pot.  I used 2 cans of Swanson's beef broth and then water to cover the meat.  Along with the spices listed, I used a McCormick's Beef Stew seasoning packet as mentioned from another reviewer... WOW wonderful!  30 minutes before it was done I added a brown gravy mix packet.  It thickened up the broth nicely.  I served with toasted french bread... SUPERB!!!

Disappointed. Both the meat and veggies had no flavor - I even added cumin and used less meat than specified with the called-for measurements on spices. I thought, "At least the meat will be tender..." and I ended up with tough, flavorless meat.

Very surprised how good it was in spite of not pre-browning meat.  I added 2 tablespoons tomato paste and pkg of McCormicks beef/mushroom grave mix.  Used good homemade chicken stock rather than beefstock.

This was a great basic recipe. I also added my own touches to it. I added a small pkg of button mushrooms, a can of cream of mushroom soup and a tsp of dried basil and oregano. I also cooked on high for 6 hours.

Excellent base recipe. I made some changes and it turned out perfect! I didn't have beef broth so I added half  a can of beer and 1 cup of water (we find that meat cooked in beer is quite yummy) then I added a 1.5 tsp of montreal steak spice for extra flavor. I also added more celery - 3 stocks  My husband loved it and said he will definately request it again.

Based on ease of recipe - this came out great!  I was really expecting it to just taste like beef, but it had a good flavor.  I made it exactly according the recipe.  (I didn't have beef broth, but used a beef bullion) Give this a try before you go braising the beef - if you want a simple dish.  It was really easy and quick.  I used the crock pot on high and it was done in 4 hours!

DEFINITELY much better than just using McCormick's packet alone! My husband thought it was too strong though, and I can agree, so next time the ONLY thing I'll change is just adding about an extra cup of water to the mixture...which could only better the recipe by making extra gravy :-).

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making stew and I was quite pleased, its simple enough to make, and has a very nice flavor to it. I've made it twice so far, once without celery since I didn't have it on hand and it still came out very good. Thank you! :D

This was soooo delich! I made it with soy sauce and cider vinegar for the Worcestershire sauce, and substituted chicken broth for the beef broth, cause I didn't have either or hand. I also added 2 med sweet potatoes cause dh loves them more than white potatoes. We loved how it tasted! Will definitely be making again!

Just great, makes a decent amount of gravy but not soupy. Easy to modify with more or fewer vegetables.

I love that this is so simple. It was also pretty tasty. I think I'd like to add more vegetables next time and perhaps more liquid as well.

This was a big hit with the boys!  I will cut my vegtables thicker and use reduced sodium broth next time.  I used the McCormick seasoning and added extra water.  I also threw in green beans during the last hour. Great with Sirloin steak.  Was ready in five hours!

I followed the recipe exactly (did not have much time) and it turned out to be the best beef stew I ever had! Sooo easy and with lots of gravy. I had read somewhere that recipes turn out better in the slow-cooker if you brown the beef first but I think in this case it is not necessary. Definitely a favorite!

This was a great recipe. I did follow the advice of some of the reviews. I used 2 cloves of garlic, 2 bay leaves and 1/3 cup of wine. I was surprised how good it came out, the meat fell apart. With no doubt I will make this again

I made the modifications that another reviewer had made and it was the best stew I have ever made.  I gave this four stars because the recipe had been modified.  With modifications, it is definitely a 5 star recipe or better.

I made this stew today in my slow cooker. I debated about how to do it because of the comments provided. However, I stuck to the recipe EXACTLY. Oh my goodness! I am at the 5.5 hour mark on "High" on my crockpot. I took a big spoonful and it is so tremendous, I cannot explain fully. All I can say is "I WANT MORE!" Thank you!
LOVE IT!!!!!!!

Perfect and easy!  I followed the recipe without changes and it was just right!  I love that you don't have to brown the meat before you put it in the crock pot.  Just right for a cold winter night.

The stew wasnt at all what I was expecing. It tasted more like my pot roast than beef stew. It wasn't thick like beef stew normally is, but more like a beef soup...This one isnt going into my recipe box. Sorry

I followed the recipe fairly closely but added more garlic, spices, 1/2 cup red wine and other vegies like zuchini and green beans. Omitted the celery. And added more stock. I also added barley cos I love barley.
My hubby and I liked it but didn't LOVE it. It wasn't flavorful enough for us...

I made it exactly as written and while it was good it wasn't great.  It was definitely missing something in the flavor department.  If I make it again I will use some of the suggestions.

I did think the recipe was really good. I did not give it a 5 star review for two reasons. The first is because I think it was a little thick and more broth could have been added. I added another cup of broth made with "Better than Bullion" because I found the stew a little bland and thick. If you like to serve stew over rice, add more water. If you serve it in a bread bowl just a bit more water will do (1/2 cup). Overall it is a good recipe.

The taste was great, but it needed more broth and celery and less meat and potatoes. After quadrupling the broth, there was still barely enough. I added a little bit of red cooking wine to the meat along with the Worcestershire sauce.

This was pretty good. It definitely needed more salt and pepper than what the recipe called for. But once we seasoned it to our liking it was pretty good.

It lacked flavor in my opinion.  I'll use more seasonings/spices next time I make it.  It did not thicken up too well either, but that was probably my fault. 

It WAS easy with very little clean up, which makes it top notch in my book (as soon as I work out the flavor issues).

This is a really good "Beef Stew." The only thing I did different is; doubled it, added 2 beef bouillon cubes ,about 2 Tbsp. of browning and seasoning sauce,{just to give it a richer look} and a half of a bag of frozen peas ,about the last 20 min.{They just need to be heated through.}It's a keeper.

This was really good.  I did follow Corrine's suggestions because I like a hearty broth.  The wine definitely gave it a richer flavor than just beef broth alone.  I cooked it in the crock pot for 10 hours.  I like my broth a little thicker, so, after cooking in the crock pot all day I transferred the broth to a pot on the stove and thickened with a mixture of 1-2 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in cold water.  I then added the vegetables and beef back to the broth.  It was really wonderful and I am sure it will be even better tomorrow.

This was very simple, and had a very tasty gravy. I think it needs to cook on low instead of high, the shorter time and higher temp do not give you the tenderness of the meat. Will make again.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe, but I did have to change a few things to get it closer to what I really wanted. I followed the recipe as written except for adding extra potatos, but when tasting it thought it was a little bland, so I added extra salt, pepper, and some garlic powder and onion powder as well as some lipton onion soup mix. I also thought it was a little too watery, so I took some of the potatoes out and mashed them up and stirred them back in. I thought the end product was great and so did my husband, though he would have preferred it even more thick than it was. My only gripe was the meat was so tender that it completely fell apart, but that could have been the kind of beef I used. Still tasted wonderful, anyway. I loved that this was so easy to prepare and it made the house smell fantastic all day. Thanks for a great recipe!

VERY DELICIOUS RECIPE!!! My kids loved the smell and taste of the stew. My husband couldn't eat enough! I followed the recipe exactly, but added garlic salt and a tad more beef broth. 
The cube meat was very, very tender and fell apart in our mouths. I will be making this a regular dish in our home!

Fantastic! The only change that I made was exchanging the beef broth for chicken broth (it was all I had). I added a tsp of beef gravy mix to the broth for some extra beefy flavour.

Pretty much followed the recipe, but browned the meat in a pan first and I used mixed frozen veggies instead of fresh.  Didn't have enough liquid, next time I will add at least 2 cups of broth.

I made this stew this weekend and I should have stuck with the recipe.  Instead I followed some of the suggestions of the other reviews.  My mistake... I added 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning the end result extremely salty... Advice stick with the recipe and the stew will come out beautifully....

I have made this recipe twice using Corrine's suggestions. I loved it.  I like the taste of the red wine in the stew.  I think I may try to make it with the original recipe next time since that way gets awesome reviews also.  I love this stew with the ultimate cornbread recipe also on this site.

This was great! I made some teeny changes.....I coated the beef in a mixture of flour and season salt, added 3 cloves garlic and a 1/2 cup of red wine and 1 tablespoon of aus jus seasoing. It was so good! My husband said it was the best stew he ever had! Definitely adding to our rotation! Thanks!

Traditional comfort food. I used whole wheat flour and a small butternut squash instead of potatoes (more fiber and nutrients and they cook up with exactly the same texture and more flavor). I will make this again.

I  prepared this stew on a snowy Monday morning and it was nice to come home to a yummy-smelling home with dinner ready and waiting for us! The only thing that I did differently was add a can of crushed tomatoes, as my husband prefers a tomato-based stew. It came out very good and I will definitely use his recipe again soon!

Ok.  I haven't tried this yet, but I am reposting Corinne's suggestions, because so many reviewers say her changes result in a fantastic stew. I'm putting this in my recipe box and will update when I whip it up.  

 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning.

This was very disappointing. The meat was gluey and grey. It is better to brown the beef first to give it some colour.

Simply delicious!  I used 2 cans of beef broth and 1 can of stewed tomatoes, omitted the celery, thickend the broth slightly at end of cooking time with some cornstarch.  Otherwise, I followed the original recipe- very easy to prepare!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

I was nervous to try this as written since most reviews appeared to really be based on Corinne's changes.  I'm sure her changes taste great, but I agree with other reviewers that it defeats the purpose of this easy recipe.  And the original was very tasty, good old fashioned beef stew that tastes homemade-- not like it came out of a can.  Only things I changed was I added an additional clove of minced garlic, and I used tapioca flour to make it gluten free.

Just made this today.  WAY too much pepper.  Normally I don't measure salt and pepper, just add what I think looks good, but for some reason I measured today.  Wish I hadn't.  Well I am warm now.  Other than that it was great.

I made this for our traditional Tuesday family dinner night with my brother and his family.  I made it Gluten Free by substituting equal parts of rice flour, corn starch and potato flour. The night before, I tossed the meat with the seasoned flour and then browned it skillet with some olive oil.  Then, put everything in the crockpot and placed in the fridge overnight.  Before I left for work I pulled the crock out of the fridge and set it on low for 10 hours.  When I returned home later that night the house was filled with the wonderful aroma of dinner!  I served this with corn muffins (gluten free of course).  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers!  This is really easy and very good.

Loved this stew! My mom always made the stuff out of the can, so I thought I would try it making it on my own and it turned out excellent. I used 2 cans of beef broth since I used more meat, potatoes and carrots than recipe calls for, I also added a little more Worchesire (sp?) sauce. It still turned out great! This recipe is a keeper!

Great stew!  I followed the recipe but made the following changes:  used 1 can low sodium beef broth, 1 c water, 2 cloves garlic, 1 tbsp Worcestershire, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 c red wine and 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning.  Turned out perfect - my boyfriend had seconds!  No need to brown the beef in my opinion.

Pretty good!  I made it as directed, only adding a little bit of broth and potatoes because we like ours to have a lot of potatoes.  I also cooked on low for 9 hrs and on high for 1 hr (the last half hour with the lid off to help thicken it up).  It needed a bit more seasoning, but otherwise it was excellent!

One of my least favorite recipes from this site. I made this stew based on the recipe without the corrections suggested (that was a mistake).  The stew turns out very thin, and I did not at all care for the worchestshire sauce flavor. My husband and I ate a few bites.  I will stick to my mother's recipe.

Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!  I love that it uses *real food, no cream of whatever soup, no onion soup mix, nothing artificially flavored, just like I like to cook.  It doesn't need any seasoning packet, that would ruin it IMO. The only changes I made were to brown the beef (I always do when I make stew) and up the liquid. Excellent old-fashioned beef stew recipe!

I absolutely loved this dish! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used 2 lbs of meat, added more potatoes and carrots along with celery, cabbage, onions and rutabegas. Instead of table salt I used seasoned salt and added some of my own spices as well. I also put in about 6 cups of beef broth as I have a large slow cooker and had many veggies! I cooked for 12 hours added some corn starch at about hour 11 to thicken up and it was perfect!! My boyfriend even loved this as much as I. Great recipe!!

My husband is a "meat and potatoes" type and he loved this stew.  I followed Corinne's suggestions, although I added a little more seasoning salt as well as a dash of garlic/onion salt.  Threw it all on low in the crock pot for 10 hours and served it with ciabbatta rolls.  Delicious!  Thanks!  Update:  This is the only beef stew recipe I'm allowed to make per husband.  Not even allowed to try others.  I don't brown the meat anymore - I don't find that it makes any difference.  I used a bag of baby carrots, almost always forget the celery (I never have it on hand), and its always out of this world!

DELICIOUS! The house smells WONDERFUL! I changed a few things in the recipe. 1.) I coated the beef with the flour mixture and browned it in a skillet first with the onions. 2.) I increased the garlic to 2 cloves. 3.) I increased the beef broth to 4 cups(it just wasnt enough liquid for me)....and 4.) I added 1/2 C of Red cooking wine. Otherwise, follow recipe exactly! SO SIMPLE... SO GOOD!!

This was great. I used carrots, onions and a can of mushooms for the veggies, left out the potatoes and celery and served with mashed potatoes. Cooked on high for 5 hours and it was sooo tender. Will definately make again

I made this recipe exactly as written (minus bay leaf) and it turned out beautifully.  My husband and I loved it and we will definitely make it again!

I only made the stew following Corinne's suggestions but I can tell you it's awesome!!  I cooked it for 10 hours and it was so tender... I do like to thicken the gravy a bit so I add cornstarch at the end of cooking.  Then, I pour it over Egg Noodles.  Wonderful!

This was excellent!  I followed some of the suggestions of browning the meat first after coating it w/ flour, seasoned salt, and pepper.  I also used a burgandy wine and added more beef broth as it was cooking.  I then added more Worstchester, pepper, and seasoned salt while it cooked.

Everyone loved it and I plan on making it again this weekend for the Super Bowl!

Very good recipe. I made this just this evening.  I did double the recipe, used 3 cans of beef broth and added mushrooms, 1 can of corn drained, 1 can of green beans drained, 3/4 C lima beans. I did add a little extra garlic and salt for flavor and it turned out great!!! Will definitely make again. I also took previous advice and browned the meat first. I don't think it matters either way, I'm just use to doing that way myself.

Excellent,  the liquid thickened up    to a nice gravy at the end with the addition on a 2 tbl of flour mixed with 1/3 c water and set on hi for a few minutes.

with the revisions from corinne (minus the red wine) I thought this came out better than any stew I've ever tried! very full of rich flavor.  I did high heat for 6 hours, then it warmed for an hour till my husband got home--he lit up at the taste of it.

After reading all the changes made to this recipe I wanted to figure out a more simpler change to enhance the flavor and I just added a package of Knorr's Vegetable Soup Mix at the beginning of cooking time and added the vegetables the last third of cooking time so they would hold their texture better.

I'm not a beef person, chicken is my thing, but this stew was DELICIOUS! I just bought a slow cooker and this was my first go at it. Came out perfect, I wouldn't change a thing! I let it cook for 10 hours. This might be a stupid question, but can I double the recipe without increasing the time? THANK YOU!

Great stew! I made this as written except I added more flour, a packet of stew seasoning and some steak sauce. It came out very hearty and thick..just how I like a stew! In my opinion there is no need to brown the meat first..it came out so tender. Will definitely make again!

This was very good. I left out the bay leaf (not a fan) and I added 1 8oz can of tomato sauce (just to sneak in more veggies).  I also never chop/slice onions for soups/stews....I put in one whole onion to cook for flavor, then remove it before serving (my kids hate the onion texture) Flavor was great! Perfectly seasoned for my family. We all loved it.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Very simple and heart beef stew.  I would recommend that the 4 potatoes be large ones or use 5-6 small ones, but that is my family's preference.  Overall this is a great recipe!

This was my first attempt at making Beef Stew and I was very happy with it.  My husband and my stepson loved it.  My 3 1/2 year old not so much, but what do you expect, lol :)  It had a very good flavor and was awesome for left-overs the next day.  I did use Wondra Gravy Thickner at the end to thicken up the juices, but everything else was by the recipe.  Next time I will throw in more beef broth and mushrooms!  Awesome Recipe!!

Well I put this together, but made a few adjustment.... I seasoned my flour with pepper, adobo and garlic powder, and then did the same to my meat. I then tossed the meat with the flour mixture and browned in olive oil. I then used the beef broth to deglaze the pan. I added more garlic and celery then the recipe called for and added baby carrots. It was very good for a "basic" beef stew.  It definitely needed salt for our liking, but we loved it.  Next time I will definitely add more vegetables.

This was my first crock pot recipe and I thought it was great.  I didn't have beef stock, so I used beef bullion instead (3 cubes). Also I used canned potatoes and added them later in the cooking process.  The cook time I had to alter a lot.  It was ready in 4 and a half hours instead of 10 and I cooked it on low.  I will use this recipe again.

I think this needs to be cooked for 8 hours on low, rather than 4-6 hours on high.  I added cornstarch to thicken the gravy but I don't think it was necessary.  I will add more veggies next time and cook on low.

Very good basic recipe.  I also dredged meat in seasoned flour and quickly seared in olive oil.  I then used some of the beef stock to deglaze the pan and added to the slow cooker. Didn't use any additional flour, but I did add a can of Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup along with fresh button mushrooms. I also  used about 1/2 pkg of Birds Eye small whole frozen onions instead of chopped onion and baby carrots.  This really turned out great.  I was very pleased that the gravy wasn't real thick like some stews.

This is a keeper!  First time making stew in a crock pot..I was skeptical about the broth getting thick enough.  It turned out wonderful!  I used a very large round steak (cut into chunks).  Then I doubled the beef broth and seasonings, added more flour and red wine as another reviewer suggested  and ended up with plenty of thickened broth for the amount of beef I used.  Also added the last hour frozen corn and peas.  The sweetness of the corn made a nice contrast to the spicyness of the stew.  I was also skeptical about cooking the potatoes all day....I thought they might come out mushy.  To my surprise they didn't and it was a great meal!

This is excellent beef stew! I added more potatoes and carrots just because we like it that way. I did add 1/2 cup of red wine and 1/3 cup of flour. My husband said, this is the best beef stew he has ever eaten. Served with warm bread. Yum, Yum!

WOW! This stew was wonderful. I added a can of stewed tomatoes and a little more beef broth (2 cups) and this stew came out delicious. I also seasoned the meat as I normally would before coating with flower (seasoned salt, garlic powder, salt and pepper) It was not too soupy (potatoes added thickness). I will definately cook this stew again.

4 stars for taste, but just 2 for consistency - the runniest gravy I've had in a stew.  Took another 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it up

I wouldn't say i love this, but i did like it. Some people said it's to 'brothy' I didn't think it was. I thought it kind-of had a bland taste. I just doubled on the seasoning and it turned out better. This is just my opinion. I will make this again.

My husband had requested some beef stew - so, as I usually do...I head to look in my favorite web site --allrecipes.com. Found this recipe and was very pleased. I used beef broth w/onion and added more than the recipe called for. My husband stated -- where ever you got this recipe, it's a good one! Thanks for sharing!

I love eating this stew. I must say, that if you don't like your stew thick and meaty, this not be the stew for you. It does not come out soupy, when you follow this receipe to a T. I would say that if you want this a little bit more soupy add a 1/4 cup of more liquid.

This is the best stew I've made and I made some changes:  added 1 can of diced tomatoes, and 1/2 a can of tomato paste, used boiler onions cut in half (about 15 of them) and used a bag of baby carrots.  We loved it!

it was pretty good, but more bland than i would have liked. i even up'd the seasonings by at least double, in some cases tripple.

Very tasty! However, next time I'll probably add about a cup more liquid.

Awesome!  I cut the beef amount in half, and it wasn't even missed.  I used 2 russet potatoes, and 3 cups baby carrots (I like a lot of carrots!).  Be sure and serve with bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this stew for dinner tonight...house smells wonderful! The taste is perfect. I did transfer it to the stove and thicken with a little cornstarch. Served with yeast rolls and a salad and yummy apple crisp for dessert. A perfect fall dinner!!

I thought this stew was good and my husband did too, but our kids, 10 & 13, thought it was too spicey.  But they ate it!  I baked a fresh loaf of bread and they scooped up the broth with their bread, then at the veggies and beef.  Maybe cut down on some of the spices, otherwise, it was good.

Wonderful, quick and easy recipe!!   I substituted A-1 sauce because I did not have worcestershire and it was great. My husband works second shift and he loved coming home to this hearty hot meal at the end of a long day.

Delicious!  For the gravy I added a can of cream of celery soup and reduced the broth to 1 cup.  I also added a can of corn and a can of peas.  I've finally found 'my' beef stew recipe!

This was great for a base recipe.  Wound up adding tomato sauce, tomato wedges, peas & corn & simmered in dutch oven on the stove for last hour.  Also added a chopped jalapeno pepper.  Since i usually overdo the spices, this one kept me in line!  Turned out very good - comment at the table was "this is better than mom's!"

I was very skeptical after reading the ingredients and seeing how little it had in the way of seasoning -- BUT, this was really, really good! Simple, hearty and full of flavor!

I made this per Corinne’s recipe, with the exception of the McCormick’s seasoning packet.  Added fresh sliced mushrooms as well.  I hesitated to add only 2 cups of liquids and ended up having to add another cup of beef broth at the end.  The resulting stew, however, was thick, beefy and absolutely delicious.  These leftovers won’t go to waste!

Made today with very few variations. It tasted great! Here's what I changed:  first off I started with only 1 pound of beef since that's all I had. The spices, flour mixture and vegetables were just about perfect, but I added a little more of the potato/ celery/carrot combo because we love the veggies. And even though I only used 1 pound of meat, there was by far too little broth. So I added another cup and a half.  And I'm learning by trial and error that the crock pot I'm using cooks very quickly even on low... so it was done in 6 hours on low with tender veggies and melt in your mouth beef. Lastly, at the very end (last 10 minutes) I added an extra bit of flour/broth thickening.  It is well worth the effort and definitely a candidate for a repeat performance!

A good basic stew recipe, would be excellent for someone making stew for the first timer.  A very meaty stew. You could add 4-6 cups more of veggies and I don’t think it would be too much. 
Personally, I found it needed more flavour and wasn’t quite thick enough. I added a splash of wine as a quick fix. 
Next time I will add a few seasonings and maybe go so far as to double the flour.

Omg I have made this a bunch of times and I love it! I double the broth and double the flour (but I use bisto ) only because I put more veggies in.  I didn't have a bayleaf or Worchester sauce so I used soy sauce instead. Delicious! Thankyou

Simple ingredients and instructions.  Added a bit more veggies (beans close to the end of cooking) and a sprinkle of Montreal steak seasoning.   Kids gobbled it up.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this  as written with these two.exceptions:  I added two cloves of garlic, minced.    And I put the seasoning on the meat, stirring to get all the meat covered before adding the flour.   I cooked it for about 6 hours and it turned out really good.

It is incredibly easy.  I liked having only the cutting board and a knife to clean up.  The gravy is delicious.  I'll make some noodles tomorrow and serve the leftovers that way.

Like some others said, I hate it when people drastically change the recipe and rate it with their changes.  Yes, we all like to tailor a recipe to suit our own tastes, but then don't rate the one you're using as a base!  Make your own, and submit it!

I made this for a group and everyone loved it! Some in the group are vegetarian so I put in lentils instead of the meat and added a few more of the veggies and it was great.

Didn't change anything and my wife made cornbread to go with it. Tasted great and was enough for two hungry people and to share with our  neighbor.

1.) Used Boneless English Beef [in lieu of the stew meat in the recipe] and made this as more of my definition of a "pot roast."
2.) Omitted the flour, bay leaf, and paprika. 

Economical, ten minute prep time, healthy, and DELICIOUS. 
Thank-you for this recipe  :-)

As is, a pretty darned good and very convenient stew and we were more than happy with it. Next time I'll add mushrooms and possibly a glug of red wine. As an aside, others have reviewed this recipe based on dredging the meat and browning it and the onions prior to adding to the slow cooker.  To those I say, you have simply removed the convenience of the slow cooker from the recipe.  Please rate the recipe as it is posted.

Followed the recipe, there is not enough broth to cover the potatoes, after 4 hrs on high, potatoes and carrots still hard, cannot eat this. What a waste!!! I should have followed my instinct, if the broth does not cover the potatoes, how are they to get done????

Followed recipe as originally written. It was very bland. I wish people wouldn't give recipes 5 stars and then put all their "tweaks" in the reviews. One of them actually said to add McCormack's beef stew seasoning. Seriously?

Turned out great! Added more veggies just because I like more in my stew. I also added more broth to account but other than that, followed the recipe. I will make this again!

It was a little weak in flavor.  I think the beef should be seared first before adding all of the ingredients.  It definitely needed more salt and Worchester sauce, and I added about a tablespoon of olive oil to smooth out the sauce.  Two cans of beef consommé in place of beef broth would have been more flavorful.  Add peas for the last 20 minutes as a flavor enhancer.

It was delicious and great to put everything in the crock pot and forget about it. I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to the flour mixture. There wasn’t very much broth. I like my beef stew with more gravy since I serve it over rice and the rice absorbs the broth. I added another 1-1/2 cup of broth using a beef base with hot water. Was perfect.

I made it on the high setting and let it cook for 4 and a half hours...wasn't thrilled about it because I wanted to smell it all day but I made a time crunch decision. Either it wasn't enough time to develop the flavors, or there just wasn't enough seasoning. When I reheated it for lunch the next day I added salt, pepper, oregano, garlic powder, parsley, and thyme. It tastes like it is seasoned now, but still bland underneath it all. Pretty simple recipe but not worth the trouble, it needs quite a bit of help to get any flavor.

Because I had 2 1/2 pds. meat, I threw in a bag and 1/2 of baby carrots, and even more potatoes.  Used all the other items but I also put 2 jars Heinz Savory Beef Gravy in it.  I have big eaters in family.  Cooked 2 hrs on high and 4 on low.  Oh I par boiled the potatoes for 10 min. then put in cooker last hour.  It was delicious, hubby ate 3 Helpings. He really pigged out.

The best beef stew I've ever made.  I followed Corinne's additions and added a slow cooker beef stew packet instead of the original spices, also a couple large mushrooms.   Next time I will add  fresh beans or a can of beans & other vegetables. This is a keeper recipe.

I have used the same stew recipe for over 35 years .  I tried this recipe and my husband said this was sooo much better than the stew  I've been making all these years! 
The recipe is great and much easier than I've been making.  I added parsnips and  swapped some of the white potatoes for sweet potatoes because I wanted to use them up.I also added Seasoned Italian green beans.  ...but it is the basic recipe that work!  We will eat this all through fall and winter.

I absolutely love this recipe! It’s quick, easy, healthy, not too expensive and it’s freaking tasty! I have been making this recipe for years now and it’s always a hit! The only changes I made is I add a few extra carrots and an extra potato! 10/10 recommend!

Good stew, but I had to "doctor" it up a bit. After 4 hours in the slow cooker, I taste-tested and it was lacking flavor. I added about 1/4 cup of tomato paste, 1-2 more tsp of  Worcestershire sauce, and about 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper.

This recipe has been a staple in my family's collection of cold month dishes for the last two years and we love it! My review is definitely late, but I wanted to also give it 5 stars anyways because it's just that great. I followed Corinne's alterations and she has it right on the money!

Made it almost completely unchanged. Eyeballed some ingredients, increased the garlic to 3 cloves, added an extra half-stalk of celery, etc. Needed salt but that's a matter of personal taste and easy to adjust in the bowl! I added half a can of peas, as well. :) It was absolutely delicious and I made two batches. Going to freeze some!

I loved this recipe. Simple and delicious. Only thing I did was add an extra potato and a bit of corn starch at the end to thicken it up a bit. I'm going to make this again and again.

Im not a big cook but I found the recipe and had to try it. I made this without the carrots and celery just because was out. Added canned corn and olive oil instead of Worcester sauce. I also added butternut squash. I used the same spices. Added 2 more cloves of freshly baked minced garlic. It was freaking amazing.

Already made it thrice. For the most recent, I hand-diced 2.25 lb. of chuck roast, coated with flour only and lightly browned in a Dutch oven prior to adding everything else. I did omit the onion (by request) and this time I think the browning added a delightful finish. I did opt for the 6-hour high setting...was nice.

For future reference: My grocer since had chuck roast on sale for U$ 2.99/lb., so I already diced about 4.5 lb., then froze equally split in two freezer bags for the next two times I make this. This may be a serious go-to recipe for me.

My family loved this! Husband said it’s the best beef stew I’ve made. This is a nice winter dish that is easy to prep. I tenderized the meat with seasoned meat tenderizer while I was prepping my vegetables. I put the meat in a ziploc bag and added the flour mixture and  a package of McCormicks Beef Stew seasoning and shook to coat. I used one can of beef broth, doubled the garlic, omitted salt & pepper bc the meat tenderizer and seasoning pack have plenty of salt. Cooked  on low for 6 hrs. Served with hot, buttery corn muffins. Delicious! TY

I made some of the changes suggested by Corinne.   Using the bag to coat the meat is not as messy doing it in the slow cooker by hand.  I love a great stew, soup, casserole, especially when I can make it with one or both of my boys, when home for college break or on leave.

Simple classic beef stew recipe. It's even better as left overs. I make this for my family regularly, and it is one of the few recipes that my crew of picky eaters will all wolf down. I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great! I have also used diced up grass fed sirloin and it turns out wonderful with that adjustment as well. I pair it with a load of freshly baked sourdough bread for an easy meal.

This recipe was amazing!  The only thing I did differently was add more veggies and potatoes bc I knew it wasn't enough for me. And since I did that I added more broth and worcestershire sauce.   I will be making this alot more this winter

Very bland. Will try to spice up the stew next time.  This is what I did and it was incredible. First seared chunks of chuck  after coating with whole wheat flour, paprika and salt/pepper. Then added cooking sherry and scraped the entire thing out of pot. In slow cooker added olive oil and anchovies and onion finely diced first. Then also added some tomato paste, basil, red pepper flakes, oregano and used diced butternut squash. Otherwise the same recipe..

I been making a stew like this for a while but has herbs in it yours doesn't like a dash of basil, marjoram, dried parsley and thyme. I skip the Bay Leaf because I always find that the bay leaf cancels the rest of the flavors of seasonings in the stew and all I taste is bay leaf. I might try it again and go in the soup and find it 15 minutes after starting cooking it and take it out. Maybe that will be better. And the other thing I do is cook the veggies separate then add them when stew is done or stew seems to taste like celery and carrots than the beef flavor that I want. Yours tastes very good the way it is, not trying to say it doesn't. Just telling my experiences with other stews I made. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my simple go to recipe. Longer you cook the more tender the meat - I usually try and get a good 10-11 hours on low if I can. I added one can beef broth and one can chicken broth - it gives a nice flavour. I added more potatoes.

This recipe is probably perfect as written, but I made a few minor changes and the family (3 adults and a 10 y.o.) said it was the best beef stew ever!  
I had a packet of McCormick's Slow Cookers Hearty Beef Stew mix on hand and stirred that into the beef broth before adding it to the crockpot.  I also poured in a small (8 oz.) can of  tomato sauce and a splash of red wine.  The tomato sauce blends in and just compliments the flavor.  Stepson doesn't like the texture of onions and celery, so I used a half cup of diced onions and they cooked down, just adding flavor.  I threw in 2 stalks of celery, broken in half for the stock, and removed them at the end. The stew came out nice and thick, the way they like it. 

No need to brown the meat first! The beef was tender and falling apart the way it should (I used small cuts of round).  This recipe is so easy and the cleanup is a cinch.  Spraying the crockpot first with Pam makes it super easy to clean afterwards.

...BTW - some reviewers mentioned that they don't like reviews that include recipe changes. But the review box asks you to write about the changes you made, and I love this site for the recipes and also for the reviewers' tweaks!

Super Easy... instead of S&P ...added Montreal Steak Seasoning instead into the flour...yum! I like more "gravy-like stew" so included a can of beef gravy. Layered fresh mushrooms on top and a sprig of Rosemary... put it in the slow cooker over night x 12hrs....this is a keeper...

I was  skeptical about not browning the meat first, but after reading the reviews I decided to follow the recipe as written. Sure enough, it turned out great! The only thing I changed was to use less meat and more veggies. This recipe is a keeper.

This was good, not great and I'm talking about the smell and the flavor. I used only the ingredients and spices that the recipe asked for. I didn't add others or delete any. It had a weird smell while cooking and the taste took some acquiring. It didn't have the same taste that I am used to in a stew but after a few bites, I liked it. I used a 3 lb piece of round roast and cut it into cubes. 2 lbs just seem like enough. I didn't change any of the ingredients but I did double the quantity for gravy ingredients as we like to make dumplings on top and they soak up a lot of the liquid. Doubling the gravy ingredients gave it just the right amount. The meat was soooo tender. I will make this again but I will try to add other spices to give it that more classic stew flavor that I'm used to.

I have more than a couple of beef stew recipes that I have utilized in the past, but this one will be at the top of the pile! The only changes I made were to use sliced onions and baby carrots. The aroma while the stew was cooking was wonderful!! My husband and I enjoyed the hearty flavor on a cold autumn night recently with a slice of warm bread and butter and a side fruit salad. Yum!

I loved this recipe. Stew should be thick and hearty and this was it. I did follow the top commentator’s recommendstions and it was incredible. No leftovers.

Great, easy recipe, wonderful flavor. I always add 3 tablespoons of tomato paste for awesomeness.  Also, I found 6 hours is perfect, tried 4 and 8 hours, stew did not result as expected.

As is, the recipe is ok and serves as a good base but written as is it does need some tweaks. When I made it again I upped the liquid by 1/2 cup (I used beef bone broth), upped the Worcestershire to 2TB, added more potatoes, added peas and added more garlic and other herbs (thyme, parsley, bay leaf etc.) My tweaks made it perfect for my family.

The first time I made this my wife commented that it was good but a little bland. Subsequent times I've seasoned to taste adding more pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Last time out I added green beans. This recipe couldn't be easier and has become a staple in our rotation of rainy day meals.

I love veggies, so I added 16 oz of sliced portobello mushrooms at the beginning,  and then small bags of frozen corn and frozen peas 1 hour before the end. Also substituted 1/2 cup of broth with red wine. Delicious!

This is a nice and simple stew recipe. I added some Montreal Steak Spice as I didn't have bay leaves or Worcestershire sauce on hand. I also used low sodium beef broth as I am not a fan of super salty broth.

Very good beef stew, although I wouldn't say it was the BEST I've ever had. Make sure to cut your potatoes into fairly large pieces otherwise they will turn to mush (my own mistake!) I also added some peas which were nice in the stew.

I love this recipe. I made it for dinner today and it tastes great. Just like stew should taste like, I only added more salt and threw this in a crock pot all day. Will recommend. I didn't have any beef broth so I used the directions on the better than bullion container and used that it works great.

This is the best tasting beef stew I've ever made.  Did add some additional potatoes,  carrots, garlic, and broth, (have to make it stretch a bit) but the flavor that comes through on this is outstanding.  Really beefy and flavorful.  Loved it!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe and approach, but used the following seasonings (Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Season Salt, Paprika, Black Pepper, Bay Leaf) mixed in with the flower.  Was done and ready after 7 hours on low. Definitely a keeper.

The only changes  I made was to use just 1 cup of beef broth & an envelope of Lipton Beefy Onion Soup mix. 
Did not have celery so I substituted about 1/2 cup of frozen flat Italian green beans. ( I keep these on hand for my minestrone soup). We loved the beef stew recipe!

I made this pretty much according to the recipie. I didn't have Worcester sauce and dumped in a half package of onion soup... when I put the 1 1/2 cup of beef broth in, it looked like way too little so I put in a half cup of red wine!     I am very aware that slow cooker recipies have less liquid so I was a bit wary but this thickened up nicely and was delicious.

I am not a cook.  I need to have detailed instructions for anything that I cook.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out just great.  Nice tasty, thick gravy with tender beef with just the right spices. I set my slow cooker to High and it was done in four hours with the vegetables done to just the right texture.  Next time, I will try the "low" setting on my slow cooker, because it began to stick to the bottom as it reached 4 hours on "high". It was a hit with my wife so I will be making again.....soon I hope.

I have made this recipe quite a few times and I've loved it each time. I use it every time I make beef stew! We love it so much, I've had guests request it. This recipe has a strong flavor and it's nice and thick, just as beef stew should be. :) The vegetables are always perfectly soft and the meat is exquisitely tender. I haven't needed to change anything when making this recipe, I highly recommend it and I have actually linked some of my friends to it. :) Thanks so much for sharing this!

I'd love a way to turn it into a stove top recipe, that way I can use it for leftover roast, haha.

Ok, I made this as the recipe states except added one fresh minced garlic clove. I added cornstarch to the crockpot towards the end, and the consistency was perfect.  The whole stew smelled and looked gorgeous.  However, it was a little bland, and most of all, the meat was NOT tender, which I was very disappointed about. Next time,  I will try adding more salt or a seasoning packet of something in order to "brine" the meat and tenderize it.

I added a little more flour  as I like a thick sauce.  Other than that, it was great.  My Mom really enjoyed it!  If you like your stew on the spicy side, you might want to add crushed red pepper flakes or some kind of diced pepper.

Good flavor, but too much liquid. Had to take out the juices in a pan and reduce it over the stove. I think it needs a bit more salt too.

This was awesome. Loved the fact u did not have to brown the meat.  The only thing I did differently was I didn't add the potatoes as my husband loves mashed potatoes. I mashed up potatoes and ladled the stew over them. Great comfort food on a cold winter night.  Thanks.

Wonderful stew for a cold winter's day. Follow the recipe, or tweak it a little, and it should still come out like Mom used to make.  I am not particularly fond of carrots, but love the flavor the lend food. And I added sliced mushrooms, because I like them. I do brown the meat before putting in the cooker. That is the only variation that I would always do.

Thank you BUCHKO for posting this recipe! Now I can save it in my favorites and not worry about losing it. This beef stew is a crock pot classic and therefore the simplicity of this recipe should not be altered in my opinion. Sure, one can take an extra 30 minutes to brown the meat and then clean your stovetop, counters and more dishes.....but then you're missing the whole point of enjoying an easy to prepare and delicious meal! As is, I am happy to rate this recipe a 4 due to the tasty results with such little work. I like to prep everything the night before and throw it together in the morning, go on with my life and not worry about what's for dinner. The saying work smarter, not harder comes to mind. I'm a well seasoned cook and enjoy preparing complex and elaborate meals for my family, when I'm in the mood to spend hours in the kitchen. But when I'm not, I reach for my trusty crock pot and search for the simplest recipes that taste like I've been in my kitchen all day. And this recipe exceeds expectations every single time. I've made it as written and then tweaked it many times and it's always delivered great results. You may find that you need to season it to your tastes. Play around with some herbs or a spoonful of tomato paste to create depth. But save yourself the hassle and don't worry about searing your meat.

Do yourself a favor, and don't change a thing on this recipe -- it truly is excellent as-is. Yes, you can brown the beef, saute the garlic and onions, etc., but isn't the point of using a slow cooker to save time and clean-up? I'm always a bit put-out by slow cooker recipes that request otherwise ;)

This is excellent.. I made it last night and it turned out great. I made the following changes:
* In bowl, mixed flour, salt and pepper. Added beef chunks and coated. Added to crockpot. 
* Added chopped vegetables to crockpot. 
* I didn't have canned/boxed beef broth so used beef bouillon granules mixed with water. I stirred in paprika and Worchestershire Sauce. Pour over vegetables and stir. 
* Just before the stew was done I added frozen peas.

This is a great base recipe. I made it pretty consistent to the directions, just without actually measuring anything because I tend to eyeball/cook to my own taste unless I'm baking. With that said, I think this stew could have been better with some additions. Next time I will definitely add a half a bag or so of frozen peas, and might even go for mushrooms. I'd also likely throw in the onions and/or celery a bit later down the line - I prefer my onions cooked but not totally disintegrated. As is the recipe earned the seal of approval from my boyfriend and his work friend - and I've taken it to work several times and enjoyed my lunch each day. Great job!

I've made beef stew a couple dozen times over the years and this is the best I've had. I knew I'd want more Worcestershire so I used 1 tablespoon and may add a bit more next time. I thickened the gravy with a small amount of a corn starch/cold water slurry. Next time I'll add half a teaspoon of dried thyme about halfway through the cooking. Delicious!

Awesome!  You can swap in French onion soup broth instead of beef broth, or half beef broth/half French onion soup like I did. Big hit in our house!

Came out good. I did it on high for about 7 hours. I wish I had done it on low. The potatoes and carrots were a little too soft. Additionally I added a package of Lipton onion beef soup mix and it really did need the extra seasoning.

This was tasty and easy to make.  A very basic beef stew.  Probably why it is so popular.  Leaves a lot of room to adjust to personal taste.  The gravy was a bit grainy, perhaps it was due to the whole wheat flour I used.  Taste and texture was fine.    I also overcooked it.  I have a new crockpot and still getting used to the settings.  Mine was done in 3 hours on high.

Suggestions for my taste:
Brown the beef first along with the flour. 
Deglaze the pan with some 1/2 cup of red wine and 8 ounces of mushrooms of your choice.   

A bit more broth can be added near the end as needed.   Mine was a bit dry per the recipe but I may have added more potatos than usual.

adjust any ingredient as needed after you put everything in crock.   

I like to make the recipe exactly as listed the first time then make notes.   If you like it a bit more complex toss in some herb de provence or whatever else you like.

I found out the night before that  I had guest coming for dinner and I had to be gone all day. So I needed something easy to put together and with everything I had on hand. This was perfect! I made it exactly as stated, with one small addition (that I think was a plus). I added 4-5 whole hot pepperoncini peppers. I often add them to beef dishes and they add just a little "kick" to the recipe. Also, I usually don't do stews in the summer but being able to use the crockpot without heating the kitchen up and come into a beautiful fragrance was such a plus..... EXCELLENT!

I copied the other reviewers changes and it was excellent. Made it 2 times in one week based on family demand! SUPERB beef stew! I took the great base recipe, and tweaked it with a compilation of reviewer recommendations. The end result is a winner, to be sure. Here is what I did (and I won't change a thing the next time I make it): 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth (I used Swanson's Certified Organic in aseptic carton) with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning. Your home will smell wonderful all day, and your meal will be a savory feast! I served the stew in bowls, accompanied by slices of fresh, crusty bread.

Very easy and tastes great.  I did add additional flour throughout cooking to thicken the broth, I pretty much doubled it.  I only used half an onion since I don't love onion and reduced the onion and garlic in a 1/4c of red wine.   I browned the meat before placing in crock pot, next time I make this I think I will do as suggested and place it in uncooked I think browning lost some of the flavor and slightly overcome it.  Overall fantastic, simple, delish!

Only change I made was to mix salt and pepper and flour, dreaded the beef through flour mixture and brown in olive oil.  I did this the night before  and place the browned stew meat in fridge.  The next morning I put the rest together, put the meat into the crock pot and return home from work later in the day to a wonderful dinner.

Great recipe! I added more potatoes, carrots and celery because it seems that there is more meat in the recipe than veggies and I added more liquid (2cups) because I like more gravy. I did not have beef broth, so I used just water, but it still turned out great.

It was okay as is, but definitely using Corinne's changes made all the difference! Browning the beef beforehand and deglazing the pan with wine and broth REALLY enhances the flavor of this dish.

This was an amazing beef stew.   The spices were perfect and the smell was heavenly.  The only thing I did differently was after shaking the beef in the flour mixture in a Ziploc bag, I added 1/4 more cup of flour to the bag along with the rest of the spices and the garlic and beef broth and mixed them together in the bag and then poured over everything in the slow cooker.  Much easier.  I also placed the potatoes, veggies etc on the bottom of the slow cooker to cook for a while first before stirring together.  It makes a great gravy for the stew too.

This was really nice. I tasted it after about 4 hrs on high and felt it did need something so I added a couple of heaped teaspoons tomato paste, decent sprinkle of dried thyme and half a beef stock cube. Cooked for a further 2.5 hrs on high. Served with rice. Delicious.

I followed all the suggestions of the last post from 10/2006, only I didn't have Mc Cormick Stew packet so I used Lipton Onion Soup packet and it was amazing! I have two finicky parents who hate beef stew and for the first time they cleaned their plates! I went heavy on the seasoning salt and yes I threw that back in because I know that's what we like but I would imagine if u don't want a bunch of seasoning just stick to the original recipe; otherwise I would definitely follow the suggestions!! Came out tender and with a decent amount of gravy, again did add the 1/2 cup of red wine suggested by previous reviews. Lovely, recipe everyone, thanks so much for all the input n suggestions! I couldn't have pulled it off without them.

My family loves this. I do not put celery in it. I found that if I forget to start it in the morning, it will cook on the stove top on low for 2 1/2 hours.

Used the original recipe - except that I add a small dash of red pepper (maybe half of a teaspoon).  I like my food with a little kick.  Other than that, very easy recipe

I browned the meat first, used a very rich flavored Spanish paprika, and added tomato paste, so I didn't end up with a flavorless dish like others have reviewed, just one with too little of interest going on flavor wise. My suspicion that there was way too little liquid added turned out to be correct, the final product was something like meat paste. I fully expected the meat to fall apart, a la pulled pork, after ten hours in a slow cooker.  But points off for way too much meat for the Mount of vegetables, even after bumping up the veg a bit.

Followed the recipe exactly the first time.  It was a little bland for my taste.  Currently making it again with 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1 large onion, 5 carrots, 2 stalks of celery, mushrooms, and will be adding peas about 30 min before it's done.

There is a lot going on here that simply didn't work, and it was pretty obvious that it wasn't going to once I started into it. Needs salt in the broth as well as in the flour, needs 3x as much broth than called for, and I used less beef (1.3 lbs) and more veggies. I cut back on flour by half a cup as well. Also 12 hours is WAY too long. I cooked for 10 and even then it was so cooked down that after having to add more salt and other spices to give it any kind of flavor, and stirring a few times, it was basically meat paste. The end result tasted good, but it looked nothing like the photo. 1 star because without significant modifications, this is likely borderline inedible.

Made as is with two exceptions...out of bay leaves...added about 10 boiling/pearl onions as I love them in stew.  Bought a very good 2 lb chuckroast & cut my own meat.  Absolutely delicious!!!  Will add some peas when I reheat the leftovers.

This recipe made for a fantastic stew. I had read some of the other reviews before making it and agreed that it needed more veggies to it. I put in red potatoes and sweet potatoes, double the carrots and some baby Bella mushrooms. I also caramelized the onion before putting that in the pot.  Turns out I could've put even more veggies  in. I may add basil to the spices next time.

This was definitely the best thing to come out of my kitchen since I'm on my own again.  I made a few changes to make it healthier.  I used all organic ingredients, coconut aminos instead of Worcestershire sauce, low sodium beef broth instead of regular, and  sprouted wheat flour instead of regular flour.  I will definitely make it again.

This is a rich, comforting stew that is very good, even without the meat browning that many reviewers are recommending. My only change was to up the veggies , by adding couple more carrots, 1 more stalk of celery and small package of mushrooms. But I should have known better, by adding more veggies I made the sauce/gravy on the runny side ( for the less experienced cooks, vegetables release water during cooking ). I had 2 options to fix this, either adding a slurry to the stew or ladle the sauce in a saucepan and reduce it on the stove. I chose to reduce the sauce to intensify the beefy flavor.
I will still add more vegetable next time, but will cut down the broth to 1 cup.

MMMMMM... That's all my guests could say. I did add fresh mushrooms to the mix but other than that it was exactly as instructed. Considering my moto used to be "If you can't nuke it, don't buy it!” I find this one to be easy to prepare and excellent to eat.

Great as written!  Any tweaks people make are to suit their personal tastes and use items on hand but, Corinne, you need to submit your own recipe with all the changes you made. The whole idea of a slow cooker meal is to combine the ingredients and let the cooker do the work.

This recipe is a great start to a fabulous beef stew! I used the basics from this recipe only pumped up the veggies, my family likes a lot of veggies. I seasoned and floured the beef then browned it well in a sauté pan before adding it to the slow cooker with the carrots and potatoes. In the sauté pan add the garlic, celery, onion and minced mushrooms (adds to the beefy flavor), stir to soften then add 1 packet Beef Stew Mix, 1/2 cp red wine & Worcestershire sauce to deglaze pan, add to slow cooker with 3-4 cps beef broth & cover. Serve with a crusty bread. Best stew ever!

I made this recipe on my son's first birthday and it was a hit. Everybody loved it. I liked it better whenever I marinade the beef with the flour and the spices and brown it in oil first on all sides before dumping it in the slow cooker with the vegetables. It is really simple and easy to make and yet a really good one. The beef just melts in your mouth. And the best part is, my kids love it too. Thanks for sharing the recipe ??

I've made this stew a number of times and I always precooked the meat. I thought it would be better if I browned the meat before throwing it together. I was wrong. It tastes better following the recipe exactly as written. I cooked it on low for 10 hours and it may be my slow cooker but it was a bit dry so next time I will either adjust my cooking time or add a bit of extra broth. This is so simple to make and save yourself the time and mess,  I recommend you don't change the recipe at all.

I followed this recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  For ease of prep, use of fresh ingredients and end result, it's a 5 star.  I suggest that any other reviewer tempted to "tweak" this recipe, 1st check your ego, 2nd try the original 1st and 3rd, explain how your tweaks were an improvement.

I've made this three times.  The first two, I followed Corinne's recommendations and it was very good.  I had less time this morning and so actually made it exactly as presented in the original recipe with one small modification - I didn't have broth so used a large Knorr's beef bouillon cube and 2 cups of water.  I thought it was delicious and my husband said that it was my best batch ever.  So very easy!  If you haven't tried it as it is written, you owe it to yourself because it is so very easy and you don't give up flavor!

Love this recipe. I prep the veg before bed then stick it all in the crock pot in the morning before I leave for work. It is delicious and the apartment smells amazing when I get home!!

The only thing I add is a drop of red wine. I also used a beef bullion once as I did not have stock and it tasted fine. Enjoy!!!!

Amazing! My family's new favourite! I will be making this many times in the future. I added some beef gravy I had on hand which increased the richness and flavour. I also added. a touch of Montreal Steak Spice to give it a bit more of a kick. Instead of 3 regular potatoes, I used 2 small yellow potatoes and 2 small sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes especially were awesome in this dish.

This recipe doubles perfectly. The only change I made was adding more Worcestershire and a lot more minced garlic. It is the classic beef stew. My British husband and our adult children love it anytime and the leftovers (what leftovers?) are delish.

Easy stew recipe! Tastes great, but the best thing about the recipe is the simplicity. Add the meat, chop the vegetables and add the spices and the broth.  No browning, sauteing, etc.

Great stew. I get a bit more heavy handed with the salt, pepper, paprika, and sauce. I also used a beef bullion cube dissolved in water instead of a pre-made stalk I've used in the past. I think this gave nice flavor. Also lots more celery. I was feeling creative and topped my bowl of stew with some grated parmesan cheese and it complemented nicely.

I absolutely love the simplicity of this recipe, not to mention the flavour!  I also tweaked like many to more beef broth and fresh mushrooms halved and frozen peas! Otherwise it's still perfect as it stands because i tried it the original recipe way first! A big hit in this house with my hungry eaters! Thank you!

Made this many times.  I've just thrown everything in like the recipe suggest or browned the beef first.  My family loves it either way!  As a busy, working mom, this is a go-to winter staple for me!  Thank you!

It turned out pretty good, but nothing spectacular - when I make it again, I will probably only use half as much stew meat and add more potatoes and carrots. Was very heavy on meat. I think I will also brown the meat before adding to the slow cooker and add more worcestershire sauce and paprika to give it more of a kick.

I've made this at least 2 dozen times. First time I followed the recipe. Then I made a few very minor changes. Mix flour and spices in plastic bag. Instead of regular paprika I use 1 teaspoon smoked paprika and 1 teaspoon hot Hungarian paprika. Add beef to bag and shake to coat. Leave beef in bag while prepping veggies. When veggies are prepped shake bag once more. Dump beef in crockpot. Toss in veggies and additional ingredients. Stir once and cook on high for 2 hrs. After 2 hrs stir and continue cooking on low. Usually 6-7 hrs. I normally serve with small tossed green salad and hunks of toasted garlic bread. Have a pot cooking right now and house smells great.

4 Stars for ease, 3.5 for taste.  Can't beat how simple it was to throw together.  I peeled potatoes the evening before and submerged in water in fridge. Cut up the onion ahead of time too and then just dumped it all in the slow cooker in the morning.  Nice easy dinner for a snowy workday.

Adding flour & seasonings directly to the meat in the crock pot and skipping the whole pre-browning step resulted in an amazing broth - only other difference: I didn't have beef broth, so I added a packet of brown gravy mix. Superb stew.

Made this today.  No changes, adjustments, or extras were added to the recipe.  The gravy was fantastic.  I wish I had also made mashed potatoes, just to enjoy more gravy.  For the stew meat, just for preference, I cut up a 2lb Chuck Roast, into 1 inch cubes.  Just makes for better stew meat.  Thanks for the recipe.  This one made the book.

It turns out great every time.  This time I added 1/2 sweet potatoes for a healthy option.  The sweet potatoes did not hold shape, but they almost pureed into a broth.  Personally...I love it!

This recipe is great!  Bought a power pressure cooker was in a hurry to try a recipe and this came out great.  I doubled paprika, garlic and worcheshire, added more potatoes and parsnips.  Everyone loves it.  Then I tried swapping chicken for beef and chicken broth for the beef broth,everything else basically the same, that came out fabulous to, actually Even better.  My daughter keeps asking for recipe chicken version and my husband is eating it out of the pot before its served - I made it today for tomoro and I had to hide the whole pot or he would eat it in the middle of the nite---never any leftovers.  This recipe is especially good if your on a budget and you just need to scrounge stuff from the fridge for a meal.  BTW dont like the power pressure cooker, probably a better one out there but i own it now so I have to use it, does it in 30 minutes when it works. and BTW I made it exactly before I tweaked anything, great!  Now I just tweak according to what meat I have on hand.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was regular old beef stew.  Today I decided throw some other stuff in there for some more flavor. Whatever I had in the house. No browning, but I added onion powder to the flour, then added some red wine in with the broth, 2 fresh bay leaves and some added salt and pepper. I had a parsnip and some fresh parsley in the house and threw those in, and then added some sciracha on a whim. It was so much more flavorful! Served it over whole wheat egg noodles. A terrific dinner.

I made this recipe pretty much as it was written.  I liked that I didn't have to brown the meat and camarlize the onions before adding to the crockpot.  I considered it, but glad I didn't.   The meat had pretty good flavor and was moist and I didn't have to dirty more dishes or take more time to prep. The only things I did differently was add the paprika to the flour/salt/pepper and add some thyme.   Next time,  I will add a little more salt and pepper, maybe a full tsp, a little more worchestershire sauce plus some tomato paste.

This was so good and really easy. Only 2 things I tweaked were that I did not add celery (don't like it) and I sauted the onion in a pan with a little canola oil (to ensure they would be soft). Really loved the taste. Everything was tender and perfect imo. :-)

This was my first time using my crock pot and I decided to try beef stew. This recipe is excellent and simple. I followed the recipe exactly as it was and every one in my family was pleased!

Excellent and easy.  I never like the way fresh potatoes come out in beef stew in the slow cooker. So I used a can of "whole potatoes" - let me tell you, these were amazing in this delicious stew even after cooking all day they kept their shape and didn't soak in the liquids. I would highly recommend using canned potatoes as I did. Used more celery than the recipe called for, since I like it :) - otherwise basically used the recipe as written, very delicious.

I thought it was very tastey & easy to make. I also add about a cup of peas, 1 can of petite diced tomatoes & 1 envelope of lipton onion soup mix. I also use more than 3 of the smaller redskin potatoes whole. Maybe about 10 - 12.

Excellent! I am allergic to tomatoes, so was very happy to find a stew recipe that didn't have them. I took some to school and heated up in the teachers lounge; people kept commenting on how good it smelled.

Excellent recipe. I'm getting rather bored of the same meals so came across this. It was loved by all the family including my fussy kids who woke up the next morning asking if we could have beef stew again for dinner!!!! I didn't have any paprika, so left it out. I will be making it again next week!!!!

My boys loved it!  A good option for non tomato lovers.  Succulent and beefy!  Nice gravy sauce needs some good crusty bread to accompany it.

This is a great, simple recipe that you can add to or modify according to your tastes. I loved that I could throw it all in together and let it cook all day. I was a bit leery that the beef would turn out dry but it was very tender and moist - I cut up a blade steak which may have had more marbled fat than the usual stewing beef. I added more celery as I like it, and shook up the flour with the broth and 1T Worchestershire, otherwise I stuck to the recipe, stirring every couple of hours. Even my husband, who usually grumbles if I make stew loved this.

While this was easy to make, it lacked anything special to make it noteworthy, and was even somewhat bland. I definitely won't be making this again!

Perfect as is!  Easy to improvise if you are out of ingredients, but no need to alter if you don't want to.  Served best with crusty bread and family :)

This is a good basic beef stew recipe. I omit the Worcestershire sauce and bay leaf and add rutabaga. I also dredged the beef in flour, salt and pepper and browned it before adding it to the slow cooker. I also make dumplings and add them to the top of the stew in the last 30 minutes. This recipe is fool proof

I made this recipe for dinner this evening. It was a hit with my family. I did double the beef broth in the recipe and added a bit of cornstarch in the final half hour of cook time to thicken it a bit. Also, I had no bay leaves, so I did not include that. This will definitely be a repeat recipe in my home!

Very good beef stew, but not amazing. I'm comparing it to the beef stew with Guiness beer which IS amazing. But nonetheless it is good. Followed recipe as written, easy to throw together.

I broke one of my big rules ..... I "enhanced' this recipe based on a number of reviews before making it...... but, in my defense .... every change made sense ...... including: swapping reg. salt for seasoned; increasing flour to 1/3 C & putting the seasoned flour in a bag with the meat to coat then sautéing the beef in EVOO until browned. I added the onion then put it in the slow cooker. Next I mixed the beef broth with the worchestershire sauce & 1/2 C red wine to deglaze the browning pan. added that to the beef and ran it on "high" for 2 hours.
Then I cut up and added the potatoes & onions, added 2 cloves of garlic, 2 bay leaves, the remaining ingredients, a packet of McCormicks Beef Stew Seasoning, a C of water and dropped the temp to "low" for the next 4 hours ..... oh and the paprika I used was Hot Hungarian.
It was AWESOME. A slight "bite in the back of the throat, TENDER TENDER beef, thick gravy, tender veggies, and a great meal. I served it with crusty French bread ........... a REALLY good meal .... TRY IT!!!
UPDATE: It's even better the next day!!!

This is absolutely the best beef stew recipe I have ever tried.  I made a note to first dissolve the flour in the beef broth the next time I make it.  I also like to use the little frozen pearl onions in my beef stew.

I made the recipe exactly as written, and while it smelled amazing while it was cooking, it turned out really bland. It needed a lot of salt and pepper to make it palatable. I really want to avoid sauteing the meat (what's the point of using a slow cooker if you're going to fry your food first?), but next time I will absolutely try adding some rosemary or some other spices to try and perk up the flavor. I'd also agree with some others that more veggies are needed; the beef to veggie ratio was pretty lopsided.

Great recipe and very easy. I followed the suggestion of using a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and doubled the amount of garlic. I accidentally made another modification which turned out to be excellent! When adding the black pepper, the top fell off the pepper shaker so i got a TON of pepper in there. I removed what I could but was still afraid it would be ruined. Best cooking accident I've had! It tasted great. I also doubled the amount of potatoes since 3 didn't seem like enough.

Pretty much standard and how I do it except for two things. One, you need to brown the meat. It will NOT make it dry but will actually help keep the juices inside and avoid any possible food borne illnesses. And secondly, I am guessing the author did not mean to write one STALK of celery. This is WAY too much. I am guessing he meant one RIB of celery. I use 2 or three. Bon Apetit! Chef Cosmo

SO delicious! This was the first recipe I made in my new crockpot. I followed it exactly and left it on low for almost 12 hours. The leftovers were even better! My picky boyfriend loves his mom's beef stew and I was nervous mine wouldn't't measure up, but it absolutely did :)

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written [actually doubled it].  While the flavor was outstanding, it didn't thicken-up like a stew, more like a soup.  Possibly because the recipe was doubled?  Anyway, I'd sure recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a delicious and easy beef stew.

This was ready to prepared but I wasn't blown away with it.  I found the need to add a little bit of red wine and a beef bouillon but it was no doubt worth making.

This is a great recipe. I made it a couple of weeks ago, and my family loved it! They have been asking me to make it again ever since. Of course everyone will add their own touches to suit their taste, but this recipe is great all on it's own!

Followed this recipe to a T. Good, but it was missing something - and meat seemed rather chewy (even on low, 12 hours). So, I tweaked...

Cheated. Used McCormick beef stew seasoning packet for base, as well as 2 cans of beef broth. Prior to placing in crock pot, floured beef > browned. HATE celery - axed it. Left potato, onion and "baby" carrots (1 full bag instead of having to slice). And now, for the "secret ingredient" (or so my husband has referred to it as) - PARSNIPS! While similar to carrot, imo, they're spicier and have a mild sweetness, which takes away from the dish being too savory. Overall, adds a different kick/bite.

Meat was "As tender as a maiden's prayer", and cooked 4 on high,  2 on low.

Excellent base stew.  I'm incapable of not messing with the basic recipe, so I did make some changes based on things I know we like.  I added an extra garlic clove, replaced 1/2 cup of the broth with red wine, and left out the celery (because I didn't have any).  Cooked on High for 4 hours and was pleased with the results. 4 stars because for my personal taste, it would have been lacking just a bit of extra flavor without the changes that I could tell I wanted to make.  Will definitely keep this one around as a basic launching point for future stew days.

Really good and super easy.. Made it while getting kids to school and getting ready for work. I did have any celery and I used closer to 3lbs of meat which is what came in the package I had. I used 1 tablespoon of garlic instead of 1 teaspoon and increased broth to 2 cups. My husband and kids actually complimented the meal which is really rare with my cooking!

Perfect basic stew recipe. Makes me regret googling all of these years for stews that use stout or wine for the cooking liquid. The broth alone was spot on. Sure, anyone could add their own little flair to this (I'm sure I will add a thing or to next time Im make it), but it'll turn out great if you follow the recipe Buchko posted to the letter.

What a bland, unhealthy way to eat. Stews need to be enriched with a tomato base and be herbed. Also wouldn't mind a few different roots. Try parsnip, rutabaga, or turnip. Also, 10-12 hours is too long for stew.

I've got this in the cooker now! And I cannot wait to try this when it gets done! The only thing I did differently was I used corn instead of celery.  I've been wanting a good beef stew for a while now,  so I hope this does the trick!

This was an easy recipe but the taste was very plain and bland.  The meat came out very tender but it definitely needs something else.  I made it as written but would definitely cook the onions before adding and add spices for flavor.

It didn't meet the thick, hearty stew criteria. It was more watery and I felt it was more like a glorified pot roast with beef cubes instead of a hunk of meat. The texture of meat, veggies, potatoes all came out really tender without being mushy but I had my crock pot on high heat for about 4 hours and then turned to low heat for the last 2 hours, because everything was chopped smaller than what I use to make a pot roast. My whole family felt it tasted bland. My husband broke out the ketchup and I added horseradish!

First, I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. Came out great. Some of these reviews are ridiculous by lowering the stars because they added 20 new ingredients. This is a crock pot recipe, so I think reviewers should take into consideration that this is a convenient recipe to throw in a crock pot and disappear for a while. Naturally, potatoes in a crock pot will get a little mushy cooking for 5-10 hours. 

I used a brisket and the meat fell apart!! Also, my slow cooker is the Kitchen Ninja. I would make this recipe again.

This was my first time making beef stew and it
turned out really good.Since I like tomatoes and
barley in beef stew,I added both.One half cup of pearled barley and one 28oz. can of stewed tomatoes,diced and not drained.I added more broth(1 QT instead 1 1/2 cups) because I knew
the barley would require more liquid.I also added 1 T. of sugar.This is an easy,delicious slow cooker recipe and I will definitely be making it again.I realize there are other recipes that already include barley and
tomatoes, but this one looked so simple and good that I decided to just
add to it.Everyone loved it!

I used Corine's tips and also boiled the carrots and potatoes for 30 minutes before adding them to the crock pot. By the time everything was done it just melted in your mouth it was so tender and delicious. I love it!

This was an excellent fast slow cooker recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and me and my 10 month old loved it! I did not make any of the suggested changes. I cooked on high for 4 hours and the meat ( I used deer) was very tender and delicious. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was pretty sweet, I like a little more kick but that can be easily remedied next time. Thank you for this recipe!

Don't change!  This is an awesome tasting stew!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a lot more potatoes and carrots, along with more broth to cook properly.  Made this several times and all the extra work of pre coating, shaking, and browning, is not necessary.

I did not care for this recipe.  It's way too simple and bland.  It ended up like curry.   I even did a lot of the suggestions but still wasn't quite fixable.  What's with all the 5 stars???

So awesome,  my kids loved it and it was ultra simple and relatively low cost. 
I followed the advice of one of the other people and did the coating of the meat in a freezer bag. 
An awesome addition was putting packet coleslaw (cabbage,  carrots etc) really made the stew delicious.. At the end,  left the cooker on without the lid to solidify the sauce into gravy..  Delicious

This is a perfect recipe straight from the webpage! I didn't have to alter a thing; and even better, it's one of those dump-it-all-into-the-crockpot-and-go recipes! It was perfectly cooked after 10 hours on low. Between mouthfuls, the husband have it a two thumbs up!

The base is great. Very tasty! WAY too much meat, though. I decreased the meat to 1.3 lbs. and kinda eyeballed the vegetables--probably a little more than this recipe calls for. Next time I will add more beef broth and more vegetables. Two pounds of beef is just overpowering. I did coat the beef in a ziplock bag, but I didn't brown it before putting it in the slow cooker. I also put all the vegetables, especially the potatoes, on the bottom of the slow cooker. The meat cooked just fine sitting on top!

Very good! I cooked it on the high setting for 6 hours and I would say that (at least for my crock pot) it needed another half hour or so to soften the potatoes a bit more. I also added some more broth to make it a bit more soupy. The only changes I would make would be to add some more onion and celery :)

This recipe is great for working moms. I luv Corinne's recipe but the beauty of the original recipe is there was minimal work involved.  To make things even easier I got the precut meat and baby carrots from the store. I put all ingredients in the slow cooker right before dropping off the kids to head to work. By the time we all got home, the stew was reddy to be served and the family loved it!

Best stew I have ever had!!! Only difference I made was added two cans of beef broth, and added a can of  peas a few hours before serving. If too thin I add a bit of flour at the end to thicken but usually doesn't need it.  :)

An enjoyable base for a beef stew. I change it up a bit each time I make it (fresh thyme sometimes, a bit of smoked bacon added the next.) Never fails to deliver.

I used 1 lb ground turkey and didn't measure, but followed it as written without reviewer recommendations.  The timing is probably right, too- ended up being a late dinner b/c I kept opening it and messing with the heat.

Almost immediately my house started to smell amazing! I almost couldn't wait for my boyfriend to get home to dig in! The only tweaking I did was add an envelope of dry beef-onion soup mix, and a couple of my favorite spices, but those spices I add to just about anything! And boy was it a winner!

It was my first recipe and though I appreciate the simplicity of the recipe, I think the stew can benefit from more salt and spices. This would help develop a richer flavor. Anyways, nice base recipe.

I made this recipe as is with no alterations. I liked how tender the beef was after cooking on high for 6hrs.  But this recipe lacked flavor- The hearty flavor you want when your craving a good stew on a cold day.  I will make it again, but I'll use suggestions found here in the reviews by Corinee.  Definitely more garlic, salt, pepper. I will also add a lil red wine next time too.

A delicious stew recipe exactly as it is.  I added a little garlic salt to my bowl because of preference (but I wouldn't be against not having added it), and my boyfriend ate it with nothing added, so it all depends on the person's taste.  The watery juice threw me off at first, but it thickened up after it had the chance to sit for a few minutes.  Because of time, but because I prefer slow-cooker recipes cooked on low, I cooked it for 5.5 hours on low, then 2 hours on high (about halved both cooking times), and it turned out perfectly.  I'm saving this recipe to make again.

Of course like everyone I changed this a little used bite size pieces of cube steak instead of meat and cooked it in the crock pot.

I was impressed by the simplicity and ease of this recipe... I was doubtful, but this is a classic beef stew.  I left out the flour due to a gluten allergy, so the gravy was thin, but I just added 1 tsp. arrowroot starch to give it some body.  I also added more salt at the end, just to my taste.  This made a fantastic breakfast with a fried egg on top.  Thank you, I'm done looking for beef stew recipes!

Very good flavor.  I did not brown the beef as some reviewers had said and it still came out great.  I love the Worcestershire flavor in it.  I did eliminate the potatoes though, cutting back on starches.

This was my first attempt at cooking crock pot stew (or stew of any kind for that matter), since I am a beginner cook I followed the recipe to a T (since I didn't have any idea what I was doing in the first place). I am a VERY picky eater and I found the recipe delicious as is. I cooked on HIGH for 5 hours and let set for 30 minutes. The only thing I would do differently is probably let it cook for an hour first before adding the potatoes next time as I like my potatoes more firm than mushy . As I become a more experienced cook I may play around with adding different seasonings simply because I prefer my food spicy.  But again, I want to emphasize that the recipe is pretty good as is and I agree with what others have recommended...TRY IT FIRST BEFORE tweaking.

I made this recipe just as directed, even though after reading reviews I had been prepared to make some adjustments, until one reviewer noted it was a great basic stew as is; She was correct. It is a tasty stew, makes lots and is easy to prepare in the morning before heading out to work. When I have more time in the morning I might try some of the other reviewers suggestions, including browning the stew beef, but I'd second the advice of others, try it as is first.

Just what we needed on a cold winter night! I took the advice of a few of the others and added the beef stew seasoning packet, red wine and increased the garlic, bay leaves and Worcestershire. I also threw in mushrooms and green peas. Delicious!!!

The recipe as given, produces a wonderful, perfectly seasoned stew. I love the fact that I do not have to pre-brown the beef. I have made this several times now and it always comes out just right. Yummy!

I followed the recipe as written and it was excellent.  I thought it had a great flavor and the beef was super tender.  I have a 7 yr old and 3 yr old twins and they gobbled it up which is a rare event at our house!  Thank you for a great recipe as I am not big on the McCormick mixes.

I made this tonight and followed the recipe to a T!!! All my friends liked it. I made it with a side of Mashed potatoes and some sliced Italian bread. I think I might add a little more flower next time as to make it a little thicker. If anyone knows how else to add thickness to it I would greatly appreciate the advice.

This is an awesome recipe!  I have made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was outstanding!  since we like more veggies, the second time I added twice as much, added more beef broth, 1/2 cup of wine and a 4 oz can of hot Hatch green chilis!  We live in NM and like chili in everything, except ice cream!

My husband loves this, and he is very picky. It's not a liquidy stew, but that could be the shape of our crock pot. I don't think anything should be changed.

I made this with Corinne's suggestions and was very pleased.  My ingredients weren't submerged in the beginning, so I added more beef broth.  As the beef cooked and let out water, I ended up with a pretty watery stew.  Not to worry: I added an extra half tblsp of flour and simmered on high for a few minutes with the lid off the crockpot.  It turned out excellent.

I know that some of you don't want to brown your meat before putting it in the crockpot, but it takes an extra ten minutes (most of which is spent staring at your delicous beef) and is so worth it.  My stew literally melted in my mouth.  I kind of want to make it again before the week is over.

Delicious as written. I DID make more gravy by pulling some broth out of the crock pot and putting it in a pan with the remaining beef broth from the carton along with some flour. Other than that, it was perfectly fine just as written. Thanks! Perfect for a snowy day!

My husband loves beef stew and I like it too. There has never been a recipe with too much meat as far as we're concerned, so I think the critic who wrote that must have been having a bad day. This recipe is great!

I made this for supper today.  I tweaked the recipe a bit and took some advice from other reviews.  I floured an browned the beef first, then deglazed the pan and cooked down the onions.  I upped the amount of vegetables and used 3 tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce and added a tad more garlic and pepper. I used 3 cups of organic chicken broth and let it cook on high about 5 hours. It came out wonderful and there was plenty for everyone.

Made per recipe, except: increased flour to 1/2C, put meat & flour mix into baggie first then into crockpot, cooked for 5 hours on low.

I made this beef stew AS IS with no changes and it was outstanding. After 5 hours on high, the meat and vegetables were tender and the gravy was delicious. Gravy was also the perfect consistency for dipping fresh bread or adding dumplings. YUM!! Will definitely be making this again and again.

YUM!  isn't even any leftovers.  I tossed the meat in floor and paprika and browned it first. Then browned the onions with Worcestershire sauce. Placed it all in slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients and went to work. (Didn't use wine....had none)

I followed the recipe as described and find the end result had no flavor to speak of, its boring food and we like beef stew.  Even my hubby is at a loss with this one, I guess I should have read more reviews prior to making it as then I would have seen that a large number of people made so many changes to the basic recipe that it became something completely different but probably more pleasing to the palate.  Sorry but I would never make this again.

Does just what it says it will:  it is beef stew made in the slow cooker.  Tastes good, filling, delicious.  I use chuck roast (cheaper than stew beef) and it came out very tender and flavored the whole stew.  Needs something to elevate it that one extra star, but it is a very nice stew, and I will make it again.

I didn't have time to read any of the reviews prior to assembly.  Although I didn't have quite as much beef as called for, nor did I have celery, loved this recipe.  I considered mixing the meat into the flour prior to putting it in the slow cooker but chose to follow the recipe.  I will make this again and again, quick, easy and very tasty.

Corrine's recipe makes this really special - much better than written.
   I don't understand why some people get so upset when a reviewer makes suggestions. This is why I read the reviews. I love to read how others make the recipes even better.

This meal is great. Everyone in my family ate it up really fast. It's a wonderful hot ready to go dinner for those cold winter days. For my personal taste I use less salt, but other than that, I think it's perfect.

I made this recipe yesterday morning and came home to a crockpot full of nice hearty beef stew - it was delicious!! - maybe on the plain side as someone pointed out - but that's all I wanted to serve my family was plain ole beef stew. PERFECTO!!  Next time I will double the recipe so there is lots leftover!!

Tried this recipe for the first time yesterday. My whole family loved it. I had to do some last minute substitutions, but it still came out awesome. I thought I had celery, but alas was out, so put in some sliced radishes instead. Also discovered I was out of Worcestershire, so I mixed some steak sauce a little soy sauce, little red wine and brown sugar. It all worked out. Will definitely make again.

Good recipe but I added two extra ingredients. I added 1/2 tsp of Ainse seed and 2 tsp of balsamic vinegar. The ainse seed adds a fuller flavour.

I won't make it again.  I used Corinne's suggestion of browning the meat and using seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  Did not use the Stew Flavoring.  It was an average stew.

Oh. My. Goodness!  This is THE best crock pot beef stew EVER.  I followed Corinne's additions from her October 10, 2006 post and you will absolutely never have to use another recipe again for beef stew.  

It's not, however, a dish I'd try to throw together before walking out the door in the morning - a little pre-prep would be needed if you're planning to do that.  But I browned the beef and got everything into the crock pot within about 40-minutes from start to finish (including cleaning veggies and cutting them up)  I didn't think 40-minutes was all that bad.  In the original recipe you don't have to brown the beef and I'll probably try that the next time just to see if there's a difference in taste - but this recipe with Corinne's corrections is absolutely guest-ready ... including those who knit-pick at what you serve (we all have 'those' people in our families)  I'd give this six stars if I could.

Did this recipe today and just gorgeous. I didn't cut my meat into chunks I put the whole pieces of stewing beef into the bottom of the dish and it separated beautifully during cooking.  I should have made double the quantity too lol Whole family just loved it - not even a chunk of carrot left :)

Great recipe! Although I do love the comment suggestions I believe this recipe is great just like it is and I enjoy the simplicity of it. With such busy lives this recipe makes it easy to have a good easy dinner. I always serve with a crusty bread this is def a household favorite.

This recipe was just OK.  I made a couple modifications per suggestions - added a bit more flour and bit of red wine.  It really needed more flavor.  More spices or something.  I'm not a good enough cook to know what it needed, but it needed something!

Very Easy and Tasty!  My 14 year old son made dinner for the family using this recipe.  It was simple and delicious comfort food.

I followed the recipe and directions as written except used a packet of onion soup mixed in 1 1/2 cups water in place of the beef broth. Corrine's suggestions sound good, but I didn't have time for that. My husband and I both loved the flavor and the stew gravy was just right. It cooked on low for 10 hours and on warm for another hour. I wished I had a good fresh, crusty bread to soak up the gravy! Next time I will~

I thought this was a great recipe. I followed some advice from the other raters and what came of it was wonderful. The only issue I had is how thick it came out. Next time I will use a little less flour and a little more beef broth. Overall it is great and I will cook it again.

We really enjoyed this.  The only change I made was to use the whole can of beef broth, didn't want to waste it, and I added some extra vegetables.  This will be my beef stew recipe from now on.

This is close to being very, very good. I would suggest sauteing the onions first -- not a big fan of the raw onion taste in stews.

Really good.  I did add a package of slow cooker roast beef seasoning.  I also coated the meat in flour and pre-cooked before adding to the crock pot.  The only thing that I had to do at the end was drain off some liquid and mix with a flour slurry as the broth didn't thicken up enough.  However, still really tasty and served with Cheddar Bay Biscuits.

I made this on the stove (had no time for the crock pot).  After reading other reviewers I doubled the carrots and celery and used about 5 cups of beef broth since I needed extra to allow it to simmer on the stove.  My family enjoyed it however there was a taste in it I just didn't care for.  Worchestershire I'm thinking.  Minus that it is a good base recipe to use and tweak as you like.  Thanks  :-)

Followed recipe but increased garlic and added two bay leaves. It was just ok. The meat, potatoes and veggies were great but the broth was very bland...definitely needs spicing up...one reviewer suggested adding mccormicks beef stew seasoning.  Good call

This was exactly what I was looking for.  I think it needed a bit more salt, other than that it was perfect!  I didn't have beef stock and used chicken stock instead and it was fine.  You couldn't tell the difference.

I have made this recipe several times and just realized I have never rated/reviewed it.  I always double everything but the meat and sometimes I will add additional beef broth.  Today, I did not have worcestershire sauce on hand, so I omitted it and it still came out very, very good.  Thanks so much for sharing this super recipe, BUCHKO!

This was a great meal.  Next time I will use a whole teaspoon of salt instead of half, though.  When the kids ask for seconds, that's confirmation that it's a winner!

I thought this recipe was very tasty. Actually, I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, so I used some tiger sauce, soy sauce and vinegar instead. It worked really well and gave it a little kick. Not bad for my first recipe with my new Christmas crock pot :)

I've tried this recipe twice now. First time cooking on high heat, second time on low heat. The first time, the meat was pretty tough. The second time, the potatoes were practically raw. Both times, the broth was super thin and had weird bits of brown stuff floating around in it. Not very appetizing. To soften up the raw potatoes in my second try, I boiled the soup for about 30 minutes after it had cooked for 12 hours on low heat. This thickened the broth and softened the potatoes, and actually made the soup much better. However, given my woes of making the stew, I will not use this recipe again!

Love this recipe.  Didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so subbed in HP sauce, which works beautifully.  Have made this recipe a few times and it's really delish.  Also subbed in sweet potato for 2 of the 3 potatoes to make it healthier. Perfect!

I made this beef stew with most of Corinne's tweakings and it was excellent.  I forgot to peel the potatoes and I added frozen peas and coriander to mine. BF and I liked it a lot.  I will make this again but next time I will add a little more pepper and a little less wine.  May even make it with beer instead.  This one is a keeper!

This was a very bland and boring stew when made following the recipe.  First there was not enough beef broth , this needs to be at least doubled.  I made this per the recipe and was disappointed.  Not bad tasting, just very plain and bland.  Let it sit in the fridge for two days, then heated it up but added 16 oz. of beef broth, 3 shakes of garlic powder, 5 shakes of cayenne pepper, 3 shakes of paprika and 4 grinds of sea salt.  It had some flavor at last.  My wife always tells me to not follow the recipes but make them my own, and this was an excellent example of that.    You may have noticed, I don't cook with "precise" measurements, and for good reason, personal taste.  This stew can be made much better.  And the second go round in our was just that, much better.

My 91-year-old dad said this was the best stew he had ever eaten. Used 2 cans of beef broth, one packet of Kroger's Beef Stew seasoning. Lots of potatoes, carrots,whole mushrooms, onion chunks and celery until it filled my large crock pot to the top.

This is a wonderful beef stew!! It really makes the house smell so good.  I followed the recipe, except i did not have celery. The meat was very tender, it just melted in your mouth. I will be making this again-soon.

A wonderful mouth watering, winter rib sticking recipe.  I'm glad I read Corinne's review before I made this because she had some excellent recommendations.  I also saluted the beef and onions and deglazed the pan with red wine.  I seasoned the beef with a red meat seasoning before saluting and thickened the liquid with corn starch.  Beyond that, cooking everything on low for 8 hours was sufficient for me.  This dish is amazing!  Excellent recipe!

This is an excellent slow cooker recipe. The only thing I changed was I omitted the bay leaf because I didn't have on hand.

This is a fine basic recipe that can easily be tailored or improved for your taste and preference. While it is tempting to throw everything in the crock pot before rushing out the door on busy days, the stew will benefit tremendously from browning the meat and deglazing the bits with wine or broth. Two more cloves of garlic wouldn't hurt, either. :)

I made this stew with Corinne's suggestions, except I sprinkled the seasoning packet on the meat during the browning process.  I also added more beef broth, as I love gravy.  Stew is a recipe you can tweak any way you like.  This is the first time I did not add canned tomatoes.  It is simmering in the slow cooker right now and smells heavenly.  I snuck a taste and it is delicious.

Very good!  The meat was so tender that it just about melted in my mouth! The only thing I omitted was the celery as I don't care for it.

This was fabulous! I didn't change too much except I used 4 rib-eye steaks that I had in my freezer, thawed and trimmed of fat. I also added a can of corn after I had the rest of the ingredients in the crock pot.  The recipe was great as stands. We had unexpected guests for dinner and they loved it too.  It smelled amazing as we were sitting on the lanai with the windows open. I served it with red and white wine and crusty rolls and it was a big hit. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the keeper recipe!!!

I made this stew last night and we loved it. I pretty much followed the recipe except I didn't have celery but I had fresh mushrooms so used them instead. I put in a little extra pepper & sprinkled in some fines herbs. I used red skinned potatoes. It was done after 8 hours on high. I served it over thin Spatzle. As good as it was last night, it was even better today for lunch. I will definitely make it again.

Delicious! I didn't have any beef broth, so I used chicken bullion with water and added a bit of soy sauce to richen up the flavor. I also just used a smidge more worchestershire. It was perfect with buttermilk biscuits!

Great base recipe, but here's some suggestions: I deglaze the pan used for browning the beef with a little hoppy IPA, use a few skinned romas from the garden, and finally just a dash of fish sauce, which really rounds out the flavor.

This turned out really good.  I made no changes, it doesn't need any for my taste.  The house smelled so good when I came home.

Thank you for a recipe that I will make for years to come.

I can't recommend this. I followed the recipe without any changes and the meat is so dry and has a near sandy texture to it. If you're headstrong on trying this you need to use chuck meat because the cubed stuff marked "stew beef" on the supermarket isn't going to give you predictable results. I think I'm going to let it cool off completely and then refrigerate it overnight so the meat pulls some moisture back into it.

This was absolutely amazing! The only things I changed was I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, I increased the Worcestershire sauce to 1Tablespoon and used a 1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic(which is roughly equivalent to 2 cloves of garlic.  I will definitely be making this again. My whole family loved it.

Family really liked it, but requested less pepper next time.  I made it with 2 c. broth (to use up the can), no worchestire sauce (had none), frozen onions and celery, and added a can of carrots and green beans near the end (no time to cut them up in the morning).  About 8 hours into it I increased the heat to high for an hour and a half because it looked like the meat wasn't going to finish.  It's a keeper!

Porportions are off. Needs more meat and hence will need more broth. Adequate vegetables even with the addition of meat and broth.

I agree with another reviewer that this did taste like regular old fashioned beef stew. I knew there would be too much meat by looking at the recipe, so I added 2 extra celery stalks and a lot more carrots. It still had a lot of meat in and it was a bit bland. Nothing special about it.

Made this recipe exactly as stated.  It turned out not so good.  It was dry with very little broth and was lacking flavour.  My family was not excited about this recipe.  Will not be making it again, sorry.

Mmm mmm mmm. I threw this together this morning before I left for work (I work 10 hour days, so anything simple and easy and *long* is good for me!). I left it in for about 12hrs, and had the husband turn my crock to warm until I could get home for some, and this is *amazing*. Super simple, super tasty. I might add a touch more broth/water next time, or leave it in a little less, because the meat was just a touch dry, but that is an easy fix.

I've made this recipe many times and always make little changes, but no matter what, it turns out great. I normally flour and pan sear the beef first to bring out the juices. I always end up adding a little more liquid, enough to almost cover the ingredients. I've been out of beef broth before and used water instead and it still turned out great.

This was the first stew I've ever made and I've no complaints. I didn't have all the vegetables so I used potatoes, carrots, and threw peas in during the last hour. Heating it up at work, I had an ex-carnivore co-worker tell me the stew was setting off memories and how great it smelled.

I made this last weekend and LOVED it! I did make some modifications as it was not thick enough for me. At the end I added some instant potato flakes and used Mrs. Dash Garlic Seasoning instead of the pepper. I also left out the celery, which could be why it was a little thinner than I would like but we all hate cooked celery. Rave Reviews. Great recipe!

Made this for a dinner on a cold autumn evening when we had a bunch of people over and it was a huge success. Only thing is, I had to add a little more flour to thicken it up, and I added a 1/2 cup of red wine that I reduced to it as well towards the end (I wish I added it in the beginning though). Otherwise, very tasty!

Loved it! Easy to prepare, though chopping the vegetables took some time, and tasted great. Will definitely make this one a lot as the weather starts to get colder. It is nice to find a recipe that I didn't have to change one bit! Thanks!

Made this tonight because I had some beef that needed used. Turned out awesome! I didn't have any garlic on hand, so I made it without and it tasted fine. I will definitely make this again, but I think I will increase the broth a bit, as I prefer a bit more liquid in my stew. I served this with egg noodles and my family loved it!

This recipes isn't amazing but it is pretty good.  I will make this again and look through the other reviews for some modification ideas.  It was a little bland for our taste so I added more salt and pepper and some butter - everything's better with butter.  All in all though a solid recipe.

Followed this with the one change as suggested by others - I seared the beef (after shaking in the flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder) and then added the chopped onions (I did this in two batches) and added to the slow cooker.  Kept everything else the same - and cooked for 6 hours on high.  It was delicious - just the right thickness (and I was worried as it didn't look to be enough liquid when I started out).  Have subsequently frozen a batch of meat, that has been seasoned and seared in order to quickly put this together another time - just have to add the rest of the veggies, broth and W. sauce!  A keeper!

Definitely a home run in our house. I followed recipe exactly, except for paprika since I had none. I used a spice mix that had paprika in it. Anyway, turned out great. Two thumbs up.

It was good but it's missing something.  Next time either more worcestershire sauce, salt, and maybe water.

Five stars for easy and three for taste, so my average is 4 stars.  The only thing I did differently was to add a few springs of Italian parsley.  The taste was acceptable, but if I try it again, I will brown the meat before putting it in the crockpot for more depth of flavor.

This is great!  Even my picky kids ate it.  I would add a bit more salt, and maybe even 1/4c Worcestershire sauce.  A few dashes of hot pepper sauce would add good flavor without making it too hot.  I'll make this again!

Huge disappointment. I had read so many stellar reviews I was excited to make this. It is really nothing to write home about. It lacks any real flavor, frankly. A very basic recipe, and the meat was tough to boot, no pun intended. Don't expect a rich, flavorful sauce, but if you are happy with just meat, potatoes and carrots, very lightly seasoned, then this will satisfy you.

Excellent stew.  I incorporated a few of the suggestions made by others but next time I think I'll follow the recipe exactly as written.  Towards the last 30 minutes I mixed 1/4 c. flour and 1/4 c. cold water to make the gravy a bit thicker.  I'll also only cook for 9 hours on low next time as my meat was a tad overcooked.  But overall, FANTASTIC.

I found the stew a bit bland, and felt it needed quite a bit more liquid. In the end I added some powdered gravy mix, mixed with another 2 cups of hot water, which helped to both thicken and add flavour. I also added a 1/2 cup of red wine and more pepper. Then it was yummy (worth 4 or 5 stars), served with crusty bread.

great basic recipe - i coated meat in flour and spice mixture and browned it first, then swished out pan with red wine, then added that to stew.

This is AMAZING!  I just made it today, it's the first stew I've ever made, and I love it!  I made it with all of Corrine's suggestions, and it's PERFECT!

Delicious tender beef.  I did double the beef broth so that the meat & vegetables would be submerged.  I cooked on Low for 10 hours.  Next time I'll try doubling the flour as well.

This was delicious! Personal preferences -- left out the celery and added some red wine and mushrooms, which were a great combination that added depth of flavor. I will definitely make again!

I have been making this stew for over 35 years. When my children were little I added a few hot dogs and they loved it. I still do that and they also make their own adding a few hot dogs. The only addition I make is a little ground clove. Its all about kids learning to enjoy food!

Was very good; my husband really liked it.  I did flour and brown stew meat first which did help thicken up stew.  Also added more celery, carrots and potatoes than called for.  Will make again and serve over rice.

I made this just about exactly as written. I did halve it (I live by myself) so that may make a difference. I also added a tiny bit of red wine and a small amount of rosemary. To be honest, there's nothing special about this recipe. Even with the additions, it didn't do anything for me. I think it needs more liquid and more spices.

This recipe is great.  I love recipes like this where you can basically dump everything in the crockpot as is and go.  My house smelled amazing, the stew meat had amazing flavor and my husband loved it, picky and honest eater.  I didn't change anything. Adding this to my regular rotation of recipes, definitely suggest trying it out.

I was so excited to try this recipe as I love my version but wanted to try something different. Blech- it was so bland, even after I added some parsley,thyme, rosemary and red wine. I'm going back to my own recipe for Beef Stew.

3 stars because it was easy.  But it was so bland and mushy.  I cooked 3 hours on high and 3 on low.  Doubled salt, pepper, and Worcestershire plus added 2 tsps beef bouillon crumbles.  Then it was ok.  Definitely will not make again, though.

Made this beef stew today.  It was a hit.  Even my 5 year old grand-daughter liked it!  The only thing I added was a little Wondra to thicken the juices towards the end of the cooking time and a splash of Gravy Master for added flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe as is and really liked it.  However, it was somewhat bland for our taste.  I added an additional clove of garlic, as well as basil and oregano to taste and everyone enjoyed it.

Loved this stew! I used cut up chuck steak which I sprinkled with the Worcestershire sauce to marinate while I prepared the rest of the ingredients.  I boiled quartered red potatoes prior to adding them to the slow cooker to give them a head start.  I added some cornstarch to thicken up the gravy just before serving.  Served it over Creamy Polenta, yum! Thanks for the recipe.

Great stew.  I also compiled other reviews and tweaked a couple things.  I coated the beef in flour and seared first.  I added 1/4 cup red wine to the stew and an extra clove of garlic.  20 minutes before serving I added a couple of tbsp of flour to desired consistency.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe with 1 very minor change.  I left out the potatoes, and made home made mashed potatoes instead (to help use all that scrumptious gravy!).  Very delicious, and we didn't have any left overs (with a 7 & 8 year old loving it).  House smelled great all day.  Stew meat was so tender it melted in your mouth!  Voted by all in our house to make again and again!

Excellent stew recipe!  The BEST thing about it is NO BROWNING THE BEEF first which saves so much time and the stew is still excellent!  The only minor changes I made was to increase the flour to 1/3 cup as we like a thicker broth and I reduced the paprika to 1/2 tsp as my husband is not a fan.  Delicious!

A good basic beef stew recipe. I made a few changes to it to make it to my taste. I just add the meat and flour into the slow cooker without sauteing it. I don't add celery (just don't like it). Then I also add a can of Hunt's petite diced tomatoes. I then add a can of corn at the end just to heat it (depending on the mood, it's either a small or a large can). Comes out delicious with these changes/additions.

Made this beef stew for my family. Started the stew in the AM and served for dinner.  Love how slow cooker meals make your home sell so good. My family loved it!  The beef was so tender it fell off the fork.  Will definitely make this again.

I agree with other reviewers who said this stew is missing something.  I decided to make it because I could just put it in the crock pot, but I really prefer Baked Beef Stew, with my revisions.  I should have stuck with the tried and true.

Okay so I made this last night at 5pmm and let it cook all the way until today at 6 pm on low. I put a slow cooker slip in my croc pot so there was no clean up! You can buy them at stop and shop. I didn't tweak this recipe much instead of chopping up onions I peeled the onion and put it right in the stew, my family doesn't like onion just the flavor. When the stew was done I took it out. I added the mccormick stew seasoning. This stew was AWESOME esp.if youu use golden gourmet baby potatoes! DELISH. I recommend this to anyone and let it cook for a long time trust me its worth the wait. Put some pillsbury flakey biscuits with it and you'll be all set !!

This is a wonderful stew!  I was skeptical about putting the meat and then the flour mixture into the crock - but it turns out great!  I too, love the simplicity and I also don't miss having a bunch of dishes to wash!  I'm glad Susanna suggested trying the recipe as is.  I AGREE!  Thanks Buchko & Susanna!

SO good and easy just the way it is! Mine was ready after only 8 hours on low. The meat just fell apart and the veggies were perfect! There is more meat than veggies so next time I may add more potatoes and carrots. This is a keeper for sure!!!

Great stew, only changes were increasing the meat to 4 pounds along with 2/3 cup seasoned flour and a few extra potatoes and carrots. It is a really GREAT recipe. Thanks

It was just ok. Turned out more like a soup than a stew. It needed more richness/thickness

Followed the recipe and was amazed at how good it was. The meat was nicely cooked and was surprised at how thick the gravy tured out. Yes its a simple recipe and is perfect for tweeking if thats something you like to do.

This is a great standard stew recipe. I added a bit more garlic and an extra bay leaf. Make sure the potatoes aren't so big that they take too long to cook. Delicious with crusty french bread. All who were fed this loved me for making it!

Very good beef stew.  An hour before it was done, I mixed 1 tbsp. cornstarch with 2 tbsp. water and added it to the crock pot. Also, I will half the pepper.  It was way too peppery for us.  Will make again.

Excellent base recipe- I followed Corrine's review almost exactly on this with just a few differences.  I used 3 cloves of garlic, and half of a big Walla Walla sweet onion.  I also used 2-14 oz cans of beef broth instead of just 1.5 cups, there was SO little liquid in the pot that the dry seasoning was just sitting on top of the veggies.  It still thickened up nicely.  I let it simmer for about 11 hours and it was delicious!  I only cook for two people so I'll be putting the rest in the freezer for another meal.

I followed the instructions in the review by Corinne on 10/10/06 and the stew turned out wonderful!  A couple of hints of my own:  If you have beef broth left over save it to thin the stew if needed but don't use too much.  Serve the stew the day after making it.  The difference is amazing when you let the flavors marry. Happy Fall!

We loved it! House smelled amazing for long time and couldn't wait to eat this one! I read reviews and made some changes, but very minor ones: 1. I used cubes and water instead of broth (this is what I had) 2. I added 1/2 cup of red wine but I did not brown the meat 2. I increased garlic, because we love it 3. i was almost out of paprika so I added hot paprika and cayenne pepper - it turned out with a tiny bit of spicy flavor - which is perfect for us.   Overall - we absolutely loved it! Very recommended...

I am newly retired and just started cooking. I joke with friends and say I am like a new bride learning to cook. This was my first time using a crock-pot. With the help of this recipe, it could not have been more simple. The best part is that the resulting stew was outstanding. My wife came home from work, and there it was. I also had skillet corn from another Allrecipes recipe, and a nice big salad. MMMMM. Heck, I even took the leftovers over to the in-laws, so I got some got some good points there. For anyone who wants to cook an amazing meal that is easy, I strongly recommend this one.

This couldn't have been easier to make and my family devoured it.  Next time I will make a few changes because I thought 3 potatoes was too many.  We have a lot of potatoes left over. I also didn't have a bay leaf on hand and I was out of paprika so I can't wait to try that next time.  I will also add a few more carrots and celery. We served this with warm yeast roll! Great Meal!

This recipe is excellent.  The only thing that I did differently was double the recipe and left out the flour.  I used cornstarch after cooking completed to thicken to my desire.

This Stew is amazing! I followed Corrine's review almost exactly except I didn't us the red wine. I also doubled the veggies because we love lots of veggies in our soups/stews. I prepared it at night and left it in low for 8 hours, and my house smelled amazing in the morning! It was delicious and thick and full of flavor! Thanks for the great recipe!!

So bummed.  I made this for a dinner for friends and after 6 hours of cooking in crock pot on high (recipe says it should be done in 4 to 6 hours on high), it is not even close to being done.  Now I need to go out and buy take out.  As far as I can tell at this point also, the flavor isn't all that special.  Not very rich.  I would have love to give this a good rating but now I'll have all this stew (doubled the recipe), that only my husband and I will eat.  I am so dissapointed!

This was great. The only thing I did a little different was I used stock instead of broth and I added a little more garlic, onions and carrots. I also added some Cajun seasoning. Great dinner with garlic cheese drop biscuits.

Great recipe. I'm sure its perfect as is, and can be done with chicken instead of beef. (I don't eat beef)  I used chicken broth instead of beef, and I needed to add extra salt. It was delicious!

I used Corinne's suggestions to make this.  The stew turned out amazing.  I added extra garlic, but I usually do that.  Amazing!!

So good and perfect on a chilly day. In the flour mixture I added Old Bay seasoning, garlic and paprika. I shook the meat in the bag of flour/seasoning and threw it in the pot. It was so delish and I will definantly use this recipe again! Thanks!

This was terrific. Made it last night, using most of the "Corinne" suggestions.  It was the best beef stew I've ever made.  In fact, my husband said it was the best beef stew he's ever eaten.  As I said, I followed all of Corinne's suggestions, except instead of 1/2 c wine, I used 3/4 c. Boddington's Pub Ale.  I also used new red potatoes, halved.  It was phenomenal.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will be using again and again!  With the changes, it certainly merits 5 stars!

This was absolutely fantastic! I only changed one thing about the recipe, because I didn't have any paprika. Instead I substituted half a teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper and half a teaspoon of sugar. It's excellent for those people who like a little kick to their food!

This was just OK for me.  Good base recipe, but not extremely flavorful.  Next time I will try adding onion soup mix and see how that works.

Good basic recipe but  definitely needed tweaking. I browned the beef very well before transferring to a crock pot. I deglazed saute pan with the beef broth, 1/2 cup good red wine and some water. Also threw in 2-3 medium minced shittake mushrooms (dried is better), and a packet of lipton onion soup. Let it simmer for 6-7 hours and served with mashed potatoes. There was NO leftovers!

I thought this was a very good recipe for slow cooker beef stew. I added a bit of my favorite necessities to it. Red wine with cut green beans, chopped parsley. I also served it over asian white rice. Its a must when i eat stews :].

Followed the recipe to a tee.  I shook stew meat in a plastic .baggy to coast before adding to pot.  I was in a hurry so I cooked on high 3 hours and 3-4 hours on low.  I left the remaining to cook and we all enjoyed a second helping later in the evening at which time was even better.

This turned out pretty good. I made a few changes to suite our tastes. I marinated it overnight in the onion soup mix along with red wine, garlic, and French herbs. This really added a lot of flavor. I also subbed a rutabega for the potatoes because I plan to make Shepherd's Pie with the leftovers. Wonderful with homemade wheat bread.

Great combination and smelled so good while cooking.  I added about 1/2 C of Lambrusco wine but kept everything else the same.

Next time I think I will add more pepper...also I think it would be good to wait to add the veggies so they aren't so mushy.  Hubby said he'd eat it again, but I think I will check it earlier in the cooking time tso it won't be overdone.

I followed the recipe as is and found it really bland.  I think I might have added 1 too many potatoes though.  I'll make it again but this time add more seasonings and more broth.

Wow! big hit at my place tonight!! I would suggest doubling the carrots and celery but perhaps the ones I used were tiny lol This was positively amazing and my only regret was that I didn't double the recipe!! Also- I did all my chopping the night before and left the beef to marinate in the broth, and spices overnight :)

THANK YOU CORINNE AND BUCHKO!!!!!! I have been trying for months to perfect my beef stew. My mother passed away 2 years ago and I have been trying to replicate her beef stew. I don't know if she led me to you guys, but between you two, IT CAME OUT JUST LIKE MOM'S!! Of course, no stew will ever taste as good as mom's..Thank you very much for submitting!!!

WOW! This is a great, easy recipe. My husband, my brother and my nephews ate every bite and wanted more. I made this exactly as written, except for the fact I was out of Worcestershire sauce, and I used A-1 steak sauce instead. They said the flavor was excellent!

this was as easy as it says. Really yummy, the only change I made was to add a can of crushed tomatoes. The meat became so tender that it fell apart. I didn't have time to watch it cook so it may have been overcooked. It tasted great though

The meat and veggies were cooked well, but the flavor definitely lacked depth. As others have suggested, this recipe could really use some red wine. I'd also throw in a dollop of horseradish and more garlic to punch it up. Very disappointing, one-dimensional flavor as written.

My boyfriend and I thought this beef stew was only okay.  I doubled the Worcestershire sauce and the garlic, and I'm glad I did.  I also used celery salt instead of regular salt and added peas at the end instead of using celery.  It just seemed to need a little something else...more Worcestershire?  Red wine?  Not sure.  It was also pretty thick, but we were okay with that.

A good basic stew.  Made no changes--other then waiting about half a thru to add the potatoes, carrots & celery.  Took about 5 1/2 hours on high for the meat to get fork tender.  I thought it lacked some flavor, but, the men in my life loved it!

This is a great beef stew! It is great as is and can be altered to fit your needs. I use half red wine and half beef broth for mine, and I add fresh rosemary and thyme. Sometimes I substitute sliced mushrooms for the celery, just depends on whats in the fridge. Everyone loves it here!

I thought this was tasty.  I made mostly as is.  I set up the night before, covered my slow cooker with plastic wrap, and kept in the fridge overnight.  I didn't have any beef broth so I threw 3 boullion cubes and 1.5 cups of water into the pot.  Used ~2 tbsp of Worcheshire sauce.  I think that the cooking temps need to be adjusted.  I had it on high and when I came back 6 hours later most of the liquid had evaporated out so I needed to add another 0.5 cup of water to it, and continued to heat on warm setting until ready for dinner.  I think next time I'm going to just cook on low for about 8 to 9 hours.

The flavor of this was good and it was easy to make. I added a lot of extra vegetables. If you make the recipe as is, I do not think it would have nearly enough

If I could give this more stars I would! I made this on the stove top as I have no Slow cooker and it took about 3 hours simmering on low, stiring very frequently.Preparation was very easy & fast!What a keeper

13/03/2014
In the meantime I have invested in a slow cooker and this is a "go-to" recipe for busy days! We still love it as much as on day one!

I made this with a few changes. I added more salt & pepper to the flour mix.  5 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, 2 stalks of celeries. It was a huge success! My fiance says he has never tasted such delicious Beef Stew before! Im definitely gonna make it again!

Yummy!!! I used a large gallon ziploc bag to coat the beef with the flour mixture. I love celery, so one stalk wasn't enough for me. I used about 2 1/2 stalks total. The only other change I made was using Better Than Bouillon Beef mixed with water, instead of broth (I never seem to have broth on hand). I admit I was nervous about not browning the beef first, but I was feeling lazy and followed the recipe instructions because I didn't want to have another dirty dish. It was AWESOME!!! The meat was so tender and the stew was delicious! I will be making this again for sure!

Yum!  We loved this stew!  I did sear my meat first and add a half cup of red wine to some beef broth to deglaze (more out of personal habit) and it was amazing!  I'll be making this all winter long.  Delicious!

I have made this several times now and as is I would give 4 stars but it is a little bland.  I now brown my meat in a little olive oil after coating with the flour, salt, pepper and paprika(I doubled the spices).  I then double the garlic and Wordestershire.  This is a good basic recipe that my family enjoys with some type of bread or biscuit.

I pretty much followed the recipe including not browning the meat first.  I did add a packet of McCormicks Beef Stew mix and a bit more worcestershire sauce.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours and the Beef was PERFECT.  However, the potatoes needed more time.  Need to figure that one out but other than that we LOVED it.  2nd time I cut up the potatoes and nuked them for 3 minutes and they came out perfect.  Didn't use beef stew mix second time but went heavy or double on all spices.

Everyone has pretty already said it - yum! I don't even like beef that much, but I will definitely be making this all winter long.  I make an extra batch on the weekends sometimes, then freeze it and take it to lunch or reheat it for dinner later on.  It's simple, but amazing. Wouldn't change a thing.

This is an easy, fun recipe!  It leaves a lot of room to add and mess with things, which is great for me, since I'm still learning how to cook.  I added red wine, and upped the Worcestershire sauce, because I like tangy flavors.  Delicious!

Following the advice left by "Corinnes" on 10/20/06, my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! I did add 10oz. of sauteed mushroom to the mix, approx. 3 teaspoons of Worcester and used an extra bay leaf for more flavor. Did seem a little too thick after 6 hours on low setting, so I added 8oz. more of the beef broth for the remaining 6 hours of crock pot time.

I really liked this stew.  I added flour, seasoned salt and flour to a bag and shook the beef up in it and browned in olive oil, then added some onions until softened and added to slow cooker.  I also added more garlic and some mushrooms, very good.

If I could, I would give it a 3.5 stars.  It's pretty good - but not fantastic.  I liked the ease of it without browning the meat, and I like the fact that it has a reasonably thick base to it (my stews usually are more like 'au jus').  But it needs just a bit more UMPH flavour-wise.  Maybe a gravy base, or perhaps the onion soup idea I read.  Good basic recipe that just needs a little more flavour.

YUM!  This is comfort food at its best!  I made a few changes and additions.  I used only one pound of stew meat.  Anymore would be too much.  My additions were to use 1/3 C Flour, two cloves of garlic, two bay leaves, 1/2 C Red Wine, 3 stalks of celery, and chopped mushrooms.  I used another reviewers suggestion to put the flour, salt, pepper, and beef in a zip lock to coat them meat.  Then browned the beef in a skillet, then add the onions until soft.  Then poured in the liquids and cooked on med for 5-7 mins.  Combined everything in crock pot and cooked on HIGH for 4 hours.  So GOOD!!

Thought the flavor was just ok.  Next time I would add some wine to boost the flavor.

Very good, especially considering how easy it was to put together!  (It took less than 10 minutes to assemble.)  The crockpot was full when all the ingredients were put in and I was worried there was going to be too much stew.  It cooked down nicely, though and was just the right amount for my husband, me and my toddler with some leftover for lunch tomorrow.  The only change I made was to add 4 T. of cooking sherry and I also used some fresh mushrooms.  Will make again!

I followed the recipe even though my gut told me I should sear the beef first. I should have listened to my gut. Nothing spectacular - I won't be making it again.

We just made this for the first time today and it's absolutely delicious. We used venison stew meat instead of beef and omitted the celery (because I don't like it and don't buy it), but otherwise followed the recipe as it's written. We cooked it on high for 6 hours and it's perfect. This recipe is a keeper. No more buying beef stew seasoning packets at the store for this family.

Simple and awesome just the way it is written! The beef was sooo tender and the flavor was perfect! I did add just a splash of red wine, but that was the only change I made. Thanks for such a fantastic recipe!

This beef stew is so tasty, and the perfect solution to a cold, winter day. Because I prefer to have more broth in my stew, I used 2 cups of beef broth (1 Swanson's can). Also, after the stew had been cooking for about an hour, I added 1 cup of water. This created more broth, and helped soften vegetables. I used skin-on red potatoes as well- YUM!

I made this last Saturday night for company, with Gluehwein (hot mulled wine from this site) and homemade apple pie.  Comfort food on a cold night!  The stew turned out delicious.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  A super easy keeper!

Basically followed the recipe but added some soy sauce and doubled the broth. Turned out more like a soup but was tasty.

OK, we ate this yesterday, YUM!  I WILL double or even triple the veggies next time though, it was 9/10s meat!  LOL  it seemed to be missing a tad flavor, next time i will double w. sauce too and add perhaps a T of red wine...  smells great while cooking.  wanted to note,  i too carmelized one onion and two garlic cloves, then added boiling water and beef stock.  then poured into crock on top of meat with flour toss and veggies chopped.  also added a packet of onion soup mix to the flour mix.

This was very good.  I browned the meat before adding it to the crock pot.  I doubled the beef broth and added some red wine to enhance the flavor.  I will probably add the potatoes half way through cooking so that they don't mush next time.  This was a very tasty basic stew.

Made this just as written, tasted yummy and the house smelled great all day long while it was simmering in the crockpot!  Next time I make this I may double the broth and add more potatoes and veggies - I like to make LOTS when I make soups/stews and freeze the leftovers for work lunches and this recipe didn't make a ton of stew.

This was great! I have to say that beef stew has been a staple with me, I make it quite often during the fall and winter. I have always followed my Mom's lead and browned the beef before hand. This time I didn't. I pretty much followed the recipe exact, except added more carrots, no celery or bay leaf, a bit of extra seasoning and used 3 lbs of beef. I like this so much better than the way I have always done it! Plus, it makes it much healthier when you don't pre-cook the meat in any kind of oil. It thickened up nicely. I am very, very happy with this!

I added many more vegetables because when I looked in my crockpot it looked veggie-barren. Doubled the veggies listed and next time I would add 1 more pound of stew meat to make it the perfect combination. Really good taste though-my husband hates veggies/stew and even he liked this one.

We loved this dish overall. I was quite distressed because I followed the 10-12 cooking hour suggestion even though I added an extra cup of water thinking 10-12 hours needed more water not like the recipe suggested.  I left the slow cooker unattended (that is the beauty of slow cookers...) and when I came back to check on it around hour 7 must of the meat was not in cubes but kind of melted in to the dish.   The taste was fabulous and easy to make but beware of the time or add more water and adjust the seasonings to the dish.  I am pretty experienced cooking  with  slow cookers. I will make this recipe again like suggested but only 6 hours in low.  That is the reason I will give it 4 rather than 5 stars

I changed only a couple of things.  I, also used 1/3 cup of flour and brown the meat before putting in the slow cooker.  After 9.5 hours of cooking I added some mushrooms and wine.  It was absolutely delish.  Next time I am thinking of adding some peas to it.  I have tried many stew recipes and did not care for them.  This is a great recipe.

Very tasty! As recommended I added 1/2 cup of red wine and that was a great idea, it helped with the thickness. Thank you!

Turned out excellent, got lots of good reviews. Put meat in slow cooker, sprinkled flour, seasoned salt, pepper on it, mixed it up.  Added vegetables (including frozen corn) and a packet of beef stew seasoning.  3 cups of beef stock 1/2 cup red wine, 1T worcesershire. About 9 to 9.5 hrs on low and it was chow time, served with thick slices of crusty bread.

My family loves this! I brown the meat in a skillet first then pour the meat and the juice in the pot. I also use more beef broth. It's great!

My husband really enjoyed this dish. I added a little extra liquid and spices because my crock pot is a very large one and I didn't want things to burn. I let this cook for 6 hours on low (my pot is also very powerful!) and then I added the flour when I got home from work (still 1/4 cup even though I added more liquid). and it turned out very well! My husband said it's worthy to be made again.

An excellent, rich stew.  I did add more flour as others had done - I didn't bother to brown the meat, just put everything in the crock and let her roll.  Perfect!

We did NOT like this. At All. I was excited about this because of the good reviews and easy prep but ended up sorely dissapointed. Followed the recipe exactly and it was bland and boring. There was no depth to this recipe, no layers of flavors.  My mom and grandma's stew was so flavorful and rich and so above and beyond what I got from this recipe.  I'll be sticking to my mom and grandma's recipe going forward.  Thanks anyways.

This was delicious!  The only change I made was I added cornstarch when it was done to make it thick.  I thought the whole point of stew was for it to be thick, not thin like a soup.  After that, it was fabulous!!

I made this stew last week and my husband and I agree that it is definitely becoming a staple in our repitoire. The flavors are wonderful (even better the next day) and it is EASY.  i put it all together before i left for work in the morning (took approx 20 min)and came home to the house smelling delicious and the stew ready to go.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I loved it, and so did my family!  It was very simple to prepare and very tasty and filling.  I substituted the onions for turnips...I love onions but my family are not fans.  The biggest compliment I got for this dish was how tender the meat was!

I agree with Michelle about this being a great base recipe. I also used Corinne's advice in her review and my two guys loved it. A definite keeper, especially for fall and winter. Next time, I am going to use this recipe as a base for pot pie, I think it will be yummy!

Followed the exact recipe without any modifications and it came out great. I live with 2 20 something boys and they loved it too. Mt only gripe was that there did not seem to be enough liquid so next time I will add more beef broth.

This stew was good, but could have been better. The only reason I tried this recipe is because it was a lot like one I had used before. I couldn't find that recipe though in the midst of moving. This was a good substitute though.

This was my first slow cooker recipe ever and it came out great!  I did have to take some of the sauce out and whisk in some flour to add back in and thicken the sauce but that's really my personal preference.  I had to also tweak the seasonings but... hey, who doesn't?  The meat was very tender and all the flavors just went so well together.

Love this recipe! It is really simple and has a traditional taste. I was searching for something easy and good, and I found it! I had all of the ingredients at hand and threw it all together in about 5 minutes. Very easy to make and delicious to eat! Thanks a lot!

This is a wonderful recipe. I would suggestion would be to cook this recipe as written, for the first try. It's that good. One serving suggestion, I always add peas to my stew, by adding  room temperature frozen peas just prior to serving. They keep that fresh color that way. If some people in your family don't like peas, just put them in the indvidual bowl and stir, before serving.

It didn't thicken up for me - I even cooked it longer. I ended up straining out the liquid and thickening it on the stove. The flavour was good, but it just didn't work for me.

This was an ok stew. I usually make stew with V8 so I felt it was lacking a little bit, but my husband loved it with the beef broth.  The meat wasn't quite as tender as I thought it would be.  My favorite part was that you didn't have to fry the beef in oil before putting in.  Not greasy at all.  Served it with store-brought biscuit.

Exactly what I was looking for.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours.  The only thing I changed was that I used whole wheat flour.  It turned out beautifully and my husband absolutely loved it.

This is excellent for a stew made in the crockpot. I prefer mine made on the stove, but being a working mom I needed a quick way to put together a hearty meal. I made exactly as written and may make some minor adjustments next time I make it just to experiment. Some people made time consuming changes and that's fine, but the point of using the crockpot during the week to me is ease of preparation and cleanup. This is a keeper.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars simply because it's so easy, but it also required a little bit of adjusting. Added one more can of beef broth to give it enough liquid. Then it also needed to be thickened up at the end for a more stew-like consistency. I also added seasonings, and next time might just add in a packet of beef stew seasonings to keep it simple.

This stew was a smash hit with my family. I followed Corinne's suggestions however only used 1/2 packet of McCormick seasoning. I used two onions when browning the meat. I would add at least another stalk of celery as well. I cooked for 4 hours on high and then 3.5 hours on low. Great flavor, great recipe!

The beef stew always turns out great. Of course, I had to make a few changes. I use 6 new potatoes, baby carrots and a little more broth. I also use the McCormick Beef Stew seasoning and add 1 tsp of sugar. Never any leftovers!!

I came to allrecipes to see if I could find a good rated recipe different than the one in my old crockpot cookbook. I found this one and then compared its the exact same but it had such great reviews I decided to make it.  My father was visiting and he really enjoyed it as well as my husband. I thought it was ok. It needed more seasonings for me and I thought it could use a tad more broth, I think it still would of been thick had I added another 1/2-1 cup of liquid. I think next time I will add some red wine to the broth.  Its a good basic stew recipe.

I made this recipe for the first time the other day, and I must say it turned out awesome! My fiance loved it! The only thing that I really changed was that I added more beef broth than the recipe called for. I added enough so that all the ingredients were covered. I put in on my crock pot's 8 hour setting and let it go all day. When it was almost done, I added some corn starch to thicken it up a bit and it turned out perfect! The meet was so tender that it was falling apart! I will continue to make this stew for years to come! Great recipe!

This stew came out great with the suggestions made by reviewers.  When I do it next time, however, I will not put in the packet of Beef Stew Seasoning.  The seasoning that the recipe calls for should be more then enough, and the packet just make things just a touch stronger then I would have liked.  With that one change, I plan on making this stew recipe for years to come!!

I really loved how this turned out!! I followed Corinne's instructions and it gave it a great flavor! The meat I used turned out more shredded than cubed which I thought was a great variation. I also did not add the potatoes, as I made Yukon Gold mashed potatoes and served the stew over it. YUM!!!!

In lieu of beef broth I added a can of Campbell's beef soup (which is the can of soup + a can of water). I assume most students (like me) are more likely to have this around than broth (which can be expensive).  Very easy to do, and as per usual I love just throwing whatever veggies, etc. I have in the fridge that need to be used before it goes bad.

The great thing about stews, especially in the crock pot, is that you can fiddle around with the ingredients and throw in what you like. Since I did not have all of the ingredients this recipe called for on-hand, my review is based mostly on the cooking technique. We left out the celery and threw in some different spices, which worked out just fine. I think it needs a bit of a kick, though. Either way, the stew turned out well and made for a good, no-hassle dinner.

This was a very good stew. It was my first time making stew but my husband, who love stew and grew up on that kind of thing, thought it was great. I've never been a big stew fan but I really liked it.  I gave it four stars because my final product, after taste testing the original which my husband still really liked, I added the brown gravy packet for extra thickness and flavor. Next time I might try a little wine for another layer of flavor like another reviewer suggested.  Other posters suggested browning the meat first and sauteing the onions etc. but it's not necessary.  By itself it is a great base and very easy and good in and of itself.

Absolutely delicious! This was my first attempt at any kind of stew, or any kind of crock pot recipe, but I followed the recipe as close as I could (I had to trim the ingredients down a bit as I have a small crock pot). I let it stew for a little more than 12 hours and as soon as I came home the most delicious aroma greeted my senses. When I removed the lid it smelled faintly of beef teriyaki but man oh man, this is seriously a delicious stew! Very nice and hearty, everything nice and tender. My boyfriend loves it and I think even our cat wants some. Will definitely be making it again!

Like many people here I rate this one only four stars as it really does have to be tweaked to be more than basic.  That said, on its own it's a terrific option for low-budget meals that go far--I filled my seven quart crock-pot before leaving for work and came home to a beautiful, thick stew that hadn't reduced a whole lot in volume.    I did not brown the meat before putting it in (I don't have much time in the mornings before work); I did add more paprika, more black pepper, more garlic, and much more salt than called-for; as well I added some basil and some white wine.  The meat is perfectly cooked, melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the vegetables are tasty and cooked but not mushy.    As has been noted in previous reviews, even on low this stew needs only about 8-9 hours in the crock pot.  Yum!

This stew only gets a four because I used many of the tweaks that other reviewers suggested. But it still made my husband say "Wow!" (not an easy thing to do). I browned the beef first (because that's just the way I make stew) and deglazed the pan with the broth. I added the packet of stew seasoning, more broth and more garlic per our tastes. In the end it might've  been a bit too much broth because it had to be thickened with corn starch. Still tasted good though. Served it with a loaf of crusty sourdough and it was the perfect meal!

This recipe left a lot to be desired.  My 1 year old wouldn't even eat it.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was just too bland.  Added extra salt and pepper after it was completed hoping it would help but it didn't fix it.

Your basic beef stew. No more, no less. Good on a cold winter's day and no mess, virtually, because it's in the slow cooker. My kind of recipe.

This was a good easy stew, however we like alot of gravy to dip our bread in or when we serve over biscuits so if you like alot of gravy also I suggest upping the beef broth to 4 cups because I was left with no gravy in pot after cooking for 9 hours.

It was okay, defiantly tasted like a beef stew, but was missing something.  Needs some extra kick or flavor.

Turned out PERRRfecto! It was so good! I only made a few changes. I used onion soup mix instead of broth, added more garlic, used a couple teaspoons of gourmet red wine vinegar & garlic mustard, a little soya sauce and a can of peas. My husband loved it and it was the best stew I have ever made!

I enjoyed this recipe alot. I made it for my husband's birthday dinner with some Cheddar Drop Bicuits. 

I love garlic, so I added 2 cloves. And instead of the beef broth, I used the McCormick's beef stew mix.

Next time I think I would add more celery, but that is my preference. 

What really counted was my husband's take on this dish: he said it was Very Good. Thanks for the recipe!

Simple, tasty, delicious, exactly as is, and easy to adjust to personal tastes. Browning the beef is unnecessary work and mess. I usually double this and increase the veggies, because it freezes great for weekday lunches.

I'm giving it 4 stars after I added Lipton Golden Onion soup mix for more flavor as well as stewed tomatoes and fresh mushrooms.  Turned out good after the additions.  Also had to add some water to decrease the thickness.

Very simple and delicious stew. I did add an extra cup of beef broth (I like "brothy" soups) and waited until an hour before stew was done to add the celery (this was a good recommendation someone else had made.)  In the future, I may play a bit and add some spices to give it a little more kick.

I followed this recipe exactly how it was originally written. My only problem was that it didn't fit in my small crock pot, so I had to cook it on the stove on very low heat. Regardless, the stew came out delicious and I received lots of complements. Great recipe!!

So good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly with only a few changes to the ingredients.  I'm not big on celery so I used mushrooms and I used 1/2cup red wine and 1cup broth.  It was really good.  Best slow cooker recipe I've ever tried.

Generic, but satisfying and easy.  I did sear the meat before putting it into the crock, then sauteed the onions in the drippings before deglazing with a little bit of the broth.  I used one tbsp Worcestershire instead of one tsp and added a little extra salt.

It's pretty okay.  I was a bit encouraged in that this recipe called for some more ingredients than some of the other slow-cooker recipes...however, it seems like all slow-cooker recipes for beef taste the same.  Hmmm...  It certainly was easy, though, and pretty edible.

This is pretty good, took the advice of others.  I placed the flour into a plastic bag with the meat and shook.  Then browned the floured meat in a pan with some olive oil til brown...turned out pretty good.

This recipe is exactly what you'd expect from a good beef stew - nothing out of the ordinary, but great flavor.  We made 7 pots of it for a church supper, and I made it again at home, all to great reviews.  I do love that you don't have to brown the beef.

Wonderful stew ! Very tasty...very easy : ) Tried several stew recipes and this is the first my husband and I both truly enjoyed . My only suggestion based strictly on personal taste would be to increase the veggies as we found it was a little too meaty . I did add a stew seasoning packet and increase the garlic the second time I made it just to compare . Gives it a much richer flavor but I recommend trying just as written before futzing...it's really very pleasant . Thanks !

Excellent! I made this for dinner the other night and it was so good. I was looking forward to leftovers the next day but by the time I got home I discovered that my husband and finished off the entire pot!

This is a great recipe.  I make it later in the evening and let it simmer on low or keep warm all night and may kids take it to school for lunch.

This is a delicious and forgiving stew recipe!  I made this the other night and instead of using beef I used elk meat.  I know it sounds a little weird, but my dad is a hunter so I try to find recipes that allow me to use game meats.  In addition to that substitute I used water instead of beef broth, I added extra garlic, spices, and a package of slow cooker stew spices.  I cooked it all day and it turned out great!  Thanks for an excellent recipe!  :-)

So Good!!  Everyone ate this. (in varying amounts!!)  I substituted soy sauce for the worcestershire because I was out and used Campbell's Beefy mushroom condensed soup.  It was wonderful!!! Great for those busy soccer practice nights!!!

I made this recipe using Corrine's suggestions and I thought it came out bland. I added onion soup seasoning, some beef broth cubes, and more seasoning salt. I think next time I want stew, I'll make the Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast but chop it up and add veggies. This was a nice recipe to try though. Thanks for posting.

Really good and easy beef stew. I usually flour and brown my stew meat before I put it in the pot, but this was a nice and easy change of pace. I added a touch of red wine to my beef broth for flavor, but followed the rest of the recipe to a T. It came out great and my hubby loved it!

I can't say that I normally make stew on the last day of April, but it's been a cold and chilly year so far!  I made it as the recipe stated, and this was quite good.  It reminded my husband of the stew that his mom made for him growing up.  The only thing his mom did differently was to finish the stew in the oven with some drop biscuits on top of it.  I guess I'll be trying that the next time I make this, which hopefully will not be until fall!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was okay.  Nothing to rave about.  I floured the beef first, sauteed and then added to the pot.  The meat was tender, but I had to add more salt and some beef gravy to make it taste like anything but potatoes and onions.

VERY tasty, quick and easy recipe!

I flour coated the beef then sauteed in olive oil until nicely browned. I also added a cup of peas.

My husband said this was the best beef stew he ever had!!  I used recommendations from other reviewers to coat the beef in the flour mixture 1st, then brown in pan.  Then I put all ingredients in the crock pot for 10 hours - delicious!

I'd been looking for a tasty, easy, crock pot beef stew recipe for a long time, and this one is it! I've been using this recipe for about a year now, and it is a family favorite.  I follow the recipe exactly, and it always turns out perfectly.

First of all, thanks BUCHKO for the posting.  I enjoyed the outcome, but my guests & DH were thrilled with the results.  Here's what I did differently: used only 2 Tbsp. flour, no additional salt (didn't think it would need it, and it didn't), used 14.5oz. can beef broth, added 15oz. can diced tomatoes w/ their juice, added 8oz. can tomato sauce (we like a tomato based stew), added a 15oz. can drained Italian style green beans, 15oz. can drained great northern beans, 1 c. frozen baby lima beans & 1 c. frozen sweet corn.  The additional beans and corn I added during the last 45 mins. of cooking time.  I would probably make it next time with either chicken broth or water instead of beef broth for myself, as I don't like that rich of a beef flavor (former vegetarian).  It was very well received by my company though.  I would definitely make again.

This recipe was great! Simple and easy. I added more vegetables like zucchini, green beans and some turnip. I also don't have a slow cooker so I simmered it in a pot on the stove for a couple hours.

I make this using Corrine's suggestion except that we usually don't have red wine on hand in our house so I use 2 cups total of the beef broth.  We love the taste and it's so easy to throw together.  In fact, it's cooking away in my slow cooker right now waiting for me when I get home from work tonight!

I've made this twice. Use Corrine's suggestions for improvement, but even after that it's still just a slightly above average recipe (why I gave four stars).  I'm still looking for something better, though...

This is excellent.  Sometimes I'll prepare everything on Saturday using some of the suggestions, and refrigerate.  Early Sunday a.m. I plug it in; later I take it to the church kitchen, plug it in again.  At noon we take it to shut-ins for lunch. They enjoy it so much!

Great flavor! It definitely was more of a broth than thicker like the beef stew I am used to having.  I will keep this one and try to thicken it up next time with some cornstarch?/, but other than that no problems!  Family enjoyed it! Thanks!!!

Good base recipe for beef stew.  I added a half cup more beef broth, a heaping tablespoon of flour and an envelope of onion soup mix and I still thought it needed a little something.  Will make again though and just add some more spices!

I made this recipe this weekend, but I put my own spin on it.  I subsituted one can of cream of chicken for cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic, added a packet beef onion dried soup mix, added a can of low fat/low sodium beef broth, a box of frozen peas and carrots, and served with brown rice.  Yum-o!

Excellent stick to your ribs beef stew.  No need to pre-cook the meat as some have suggested.  It turns out perfectly delicious without.  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of just mixing together enough flour with the meat (I didn't measure it).  I also added tomato juice because we prefer a tomato based stew.  Will make this again.

Hmmm... Just read the recipe over again to make sure I didn't make any errors while making this. I thought this was really bland as written. It smelled fantastic while cooking, but it didn't taste anything like how it smelled. I ended up adding a 1/2 cup of red wine which helped but it still was seriously lacking any sort of flavor.

this was an excellent beef stew--it looked too simple to be so. i really liked the ease of the gravy thickening--just throw the flour in with the beef! no browning and total perfection in the end! the worcestershire sauce was an added bonus and scented the kitchen nicely!

Following a few recommendations, I increased the flour to 1/3 C and also added a 1/2 C wine.  I wasn't blown away by the taste and maybe that had to do with the 1/2 Tspn of salt. I ended up adding extra to improve the taste.  I also think next time, I will eliminate the wine and go for a tomato paste addition.  But I definitely stayed away from browning meat as the slow cooker is made to keep things easy and the meat turned out perfect.

Delicious traditional "no frills" recipe.  I followed directions as stated, except I did add a good bit of seasoned salt to boost the flavor.

I used the "tweaked" version that so many people have talked about, and I'm sorry that I did. It really did defeat the whole purpose of it being a quick and easy crock pot meal, and I did not like the way it turned out. My fault...next time I will follow the recipe exactly!

This stew turned out fantastic.  I followed all of Corinne's suggestions except the red wine and McMcCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning. It was a great hearty comfort stew and I will definetely be making this over and over again (especially throughout the winter).

This was really good, however I needed more broth than what was called for.  I think Corrine's suggestions are good, but that takes away COMPLETELY the point of being able to just throw ingredients in a crock pot, turning it on, and walking away.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  I added the following: 2 cups of beef broth, 1/2 cup water, and package of beef stew spices (McCormick). I also added okra, green beans, and mushrooms (my favorite!!!).  And I seasoned the meat with pepper and garlic salt before I put the flour substance on it.

Loved it!!  Took a couple of minutes to throw together in the A.M., and didn't even make me late for work.  I'm not even a Beef Stew fan and I'm stuffed!  Only alteration I made was an extra clove of garlic because I love it, and I added a tablespoon or two of flour just before I turned it off to sit for a little while to thicken it up.

I did this recipe the way it is written and the way it was suggested by another reviewer  (brown the beef, 1/2 c flour, wine).  Both ways were fine, so in the future if I do this again, I will just do the way it is written and save the extra steps.  This was just OK for me, family enjoyed it.

I followed Corinne's modifications as I saw it would lend more flavor to the original recipe, and it was great! I used 2 cups beef broth and next time I will up it to 2 1/2 - 3 cups so the stew is a little more saucy (love to soak up the sauce with some crusty bread). This beef stew really hit the spot now that the weather's cooling off. My hubbie loved it too.

The only reason I did not give it a 5 was beacuase I made some changes- I didn't really measure how many potatoes I thew in, and it must have been alot becuase I used three cans of beef broth. Flavor was great, made great leftovers.

excellent recipe! a HIT with the entire family. there wasn't a drop left in the crockpot by the time i was done! followed recommendations and they were perfect. i didnt have any beef, so i used pork and it was still delish! i bought a loaf of french bread to go with this and placed a piece at the bottom of the bowl of stew. the juices made the bread so good when we got to the bottom of the bowl. will definitely make this again and will definitely recommend!

This was really really good! I was not sure I would really care for this recipe because it did not seem like it would have much flavor. It did need more salt and pepper after it had finished cooking. This is an excellent recipe and make excellent leftovers!

This was amazing beef stew! My husband raved about it. The only changes I made were I added a bit more flour for a thicker stew and I didn't have worcestershire so I used a splash of A1, and I skipped the celery because I had none.

This stew was excellent... throw a loaf in the bread machine to soak up the broth!

I have made this recipe several times now and everyone who has had it has raved about it!
I did change a couple things though!  I did not add any celery and I use baby carrots!  I like my beef stew hearty so I added more Meat, Potatoes and Carrots but when I originally made it following the original recipe without the celery again it was still excellent!  Definately a keeper

I couldn't access my old hard drive and was making my recipe from memory and checked on-line to see if I forgot anythin obvious. Found this recipe which is very similiar to mine, and yep, forgot the bay leaves. I follow very closely the recommended modifications. I brown the meat in olive oil. I add about 1/3-1/2 cup wine. I triple the worchestire sauce to 3 tbsp, add fresh green beans, and I add 1 tbsp basil, and sometimes a sweet hot sauce called tiger sauce to deepen the flavor. 1- 2 tbsp. When it is within an hour or so of done I make a roux with butter and flour to do any thickening up I desire. Very hearty and yummy! My recipe is so close I imagine I likely got it from here in the first place.

The recipes was great...but even better with the suggested additions by other users. You definitely want to brown the meat before you add to the crockpot.

I was hoping for a recipe with thicker sauce.  The sauce for this recipe is more soup like.  It tasted decent but nothing out of the ordinary.

It was pretty good and I did what someone mentioned about thickening it up, but we still thought it should be thicker.....next time I'm going to try tapioca to thicken it!

My pregnant, vegetarian wife surprised me with a request for something with meat, potatoes and gravy the other day! I couldn’t find my old recipe for beef stew, one I used to LOVE, so I came here and found this one. Basically, it’s the same as my old one. I just added some peeled and diced turnips, used a Vidalia onion and added about 20 white, pearl onions to the mix. I used to brown the meat after coating it with flour but tired the method described here. It worked PERFECTLY! My pregnant, vegetarian wife is not a vegetarian any longer… LOL  She LOVED it!

This stew was fantastic and easy to prepare.   I doubled the beef broth to 3 cups then lefted out the salt because my broth was commercially prepared and had enough in it already.    I will definately serve this again.

This was wonderful. The only changes I made were doubling the flour/s&p and coating the beef with it in a bag. Also I used half beef broth/half wine. It was a bit peppery (I won't double it next time), but the consistency was perfect.

This is a great recipe.  Regarding Corrine's suggestions, I just thought that was way too much work.  I use a slow cooker so I can do things fast and I did not want to invest that much time.  Having said that, I did flour the meat and saute it, but then I just dumped everything in the slow cooker as the recipe said.  I added 1/2 cup red wine, thyme, and rosemary, and I used HOT paprika.  It really was delicious.  I think next time I will use a can of golden mushroom soup too.  I might have liked a little more juice.  Even with the added spice, my 2 year old twins really liked it.

This stew was pretty good. Both my husband & I liked it. Half way through the cooking, though, I noticed there wasn't enough liquid. It also was very thin. I ended up adding more stock & 30 min before serving I added cornstarch to thicken it more. Then it was fab. I would do this recipe again.

I scaled down the recipe to make 3 servings - but didn't scale down the quantity of broth since there would not have been enough liquid. This was very easy to prepare and tasted great! Will try adding some parsnips next time.

Pretty good recipe.  I'm not a big fan of beef stew myself, but my husband enjoyed it.  I used the tips from previous reviews (browning the meat, McCormicks seasoning, etc.) and it turned out good. I used more celery than called for, 2 onions, and as many baby carrots I could fit into the crockpot! I only had to cook it 4 hours on high.

I've always been so-so about beef stew, but this is really wonderful WITH the alterations suggested in previous posts, namely: using seasoning salt in with the flour for dredging, increasing the garlic (3 cloves for me), and adding wine and 1 T. Worcestershire sauce to the beef broth.  I also have to give a shout out to the McCormick stew seasoning.  I usually avoid packaged seasoning mixes, but here it is essential and really makes for a tasty stew.  I added another onion, coarsly chopped, and added more potatoes (Yukon golds and fingerlings work great, plus no need to peel them).  Finally, I put the veggies in first with the meat on top since they are a little slower to cook and benefit from getting more of the heat.  This is the only crockpot stew I've ever made that did NOT have to be thickened before serving; the consistency was perfect after eight hours.  Truly a keeper!

This was a good stew recipe.  I enjoyed it a lot!  I also took the advice of Corrine, which JLSpahn was kind enough to re-list just a few reviews down.  I think the red wine really adds a great flavor!

I thought that this recipe was really good (so did the hubby).  We usually eat Dinty Moore, so this was a nice change.  As many others did, I followed Corrine's cooking instructions to the T.  The only thing that I did in addition to Corrine's instructions was add a pack of Lipton's Beefy Onion Soup mix.  I did this in addition to adding the McCormick Beef Stew seasoning.

I'm rating this low because of the fact that there are hardly any veggies, I thought I was reading the 2 lbs. of meat wrong but I went ahead and made it the way the recipe read.  It turned out to be almost all beef with a tiny smattering of vegetables.  I've never seen beef stew made that way, and the picture by the way is not representational.  When you scoop a bowl of this stew, you will find 99% meat and a couple pieces of carrot/potoatoe.  A few easy modifications, such as cut the meat in half, would make all the difference.  The flavor itself was good and I like how simple the recipe is.  Just way too much beef.

Wowww.. this is good stuff.  I followed Corrines suggestions such as searing the beef and glazing the pan with the broth, onions, and garlic.  I didn't have fresh garlic as usual so I just used the minced garlic in a jar, 2 tsps. Used 4 small red potatoes, quartered. This had the perfect flavor.. everyone loved it.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours then on high for almost two hours.  That turned out to be just right.   Does not need any "stew seasoning packet" or onion soup mix. Definitely recommend this recipe.  THANK YOU

I followed this recipe to a tee, except I added a 1/2 bulb of garlic(we like!)and instead of potatoes I added 1/2 butternut squash, parsnip, turnip and green pepper with carrots and celery. With these extra vegies I needed to add another 1/2 cup broth and also added a tin of Italian chopped tomates and a can of ocra...
Very tasty indeed!!

I have to say I found this recipe dissapointing.  I followed some other suggestions that people made and I think it was a mistake.  Adding 2 bay leaves added too much flavor, it was overpowering.  My husband is very sensitive to pepper and it was so strong in this recipe that he couldn't eat it.  I think it may have been strong because of the length of time I let it cook.  It was ok, but I will definately make changes to fit our tastes next time.

However, it seemed like it needed a little more seasoning, which surprised me since the recipe called for so many ingredients. We just added table salt and that seemed to do the trick. I will probably use this recipe again but next time i will have to Doctor it up just a bit.

The meat came out nice and tender but I found I needed to add a second can of beef broth, along with a little cornstarch to help thicken it.  I also added a little green beans and green peas.  It was good but not quite the hearty beef stew I was looking for.

My boyfriend and sister enjoyed this dish on a cold snowy day! It was absolutely perfect! Paired with some artisan french bread and you have some really cozy comfort food. The only thing was I had to add more beef broth to ensure the contents was covered! All in all great recipe!

This is a very good basic stew - made it yesterday and loved it.  If you are looking for a good start to build a classic stew upon, this is it.

Excellent recipe for crock pot stew! My husband loved it! I made a few changes.  I did brown the  meat in oil after dredging in flour.  And I also did not have beef broth, so I used water added a dash of browning sauce.  Cooking time for me in 5qt crock was 9 hrs on low.  Thank you for such a easy and delish recipe!

I wanted to do a second review, but the site won't let me.  My first review follows this one.

I tried making this exactly as written, except I used 1 1/4 lbs of beef and upped the flour to 1/3 cup because I like a thick broth.  But I doubled the veggies and one can of beef broth (about 1 3/4 cups) didn't make enough liquid after it had cooked.  So I added another can of broth and doubled the salt and pepper too.  (Also added a small drained can of peas and mushrooms but that doesn't really change the taste.)  It is a very good recipe as written!  A basic and plain beef stew, but quite good.  I'm leaving my five star rating firmly in place.

(old review) I don't normally review by telling how I changed a recipe, but I did this one quite a bit.  I added two cans diced tomatoes and used frozen stew veggies instead of fresh.  It was very good and I'm sure it would be delish as-is, but I needed a bigger pot of stew than I was getting with the recipe so I did the tomatoes and frozen veggies to "stretch" it.

I made the changes recommended by other reviewers (increased the flour, browned the meat, added red wine) and this stew was delicious. My husband particularly liked it.

this was the first thing i made in my slow cooker and i was very happy at how it turned out! i cooked it on high for 5 hours and low on 1 hour and it turned out great. had to add some cornstarch at the end to thicken it up a bit. i also cut back on the paprika and added oregano, thyme, rosemary and parsley... it tastes even better the next day as leftovers because the flavours have mellowed and merged! great recipe!

I have used this receipe a couple of times. Did not add wine but I do add a tablespoone or two of Ketchup. It adds color and some flavor. I made this for my son and daughter-in-law and she is a picky eater but had seconds. It is great for company and I make at least 2 lbs of stew.

This is the first time I have ever made stew, and I was very happy with the outcome.  I cut the potatoes small and added carrots a little later and cooked it on high for 5 hours, and I couldn't believe how fast it cooked so I put it on low for another hour or so. I also had fresh baked bread to go with it.  My husband and I really liked this recipe.  Thank you.

This was very good.  I did make a few changes.  I added fresh green beans, 1/2 cup red wine, 1/2 pkg. dry onion soup mix, 1/2 pkg. beef stew seasoning, a little thyme, seasoned salt and parsley, and added frozen peas the last hour.  My husband loved it!  It was a great fall meal.

I am eating this as I type and I love it! A bit spicy for me, but I don't like anything with a zing... but this is exactly what I was thinking when I think of beef stew! I added peas and corn. I would add more veggies if I had them, only because I like lots of veggies! Oh, and we added 1/2 cup beef broth in addition to what it asked for. Thanks for the recipie!

This was good. My son loved it. I however, prefer more of a beef vegetable soup to the classic beef stew. I'll keep the recipe and make again. I added tomatoes,A-1 and red wine at the suggestion of another reviewer. Gave it a good flavor!

Great!  I skipped the celery, and used venison instead of beef cause that's what I had on hand, but this recipe turned out awesome!  I added more spices (thyme, parsley, rosemary) and used low fat/salt beef broth.  It wasn't "brothy" at all,  just the opposite.  I cooked it on low for about 10 hours, though.  Will definitely make again.

A good basic recipe.  I added a lot to it because it was so plain.  I added more liquid (beef/vegi broth), beefy onion condensed soup and powdered soup mix, far more garlic, and worcestershire, red wine, and italian seasoning.  This recipe does give a good start though.

I liked this recipe.  I did add another half a cup of beef broth, and half a cup of red wine.  I did not find it too "brothy", it really needs to be cooked long enough so that it is not "brothy".  Overall, I thought it was a very good recipe!

We loved this stew! I made a few changes based on other reviews though. I used 2-inch pieces of beef because one inch sounded way too small. I used 2c broth and 1/2c red wine, doubled the garlic and bay leaves and used 1T Worcestershire sauce. I also added mushrooms and a shallot (I think the mushrooms made a big difference!). I also browned the meat first, then rolled it in the flour which I had put into the bottom of the slow cooker. The meat left some good juice and brown bits in the pan so I sauteed the veggies in that for about 5 minutes before adding. I cooked it for about 5 hours and it was perfect - about medium thickness and with lots of broth which we loved.

This stew was really good!  I did make a few modifications to suit personal taste: I doubled the garlic and the Worcestershire sauce, added 1 cup of beer, an extra 2 teaspoons of fluor, & skipped the celery and onion.  I will definitely be making this again:)  Thank you!

A good basic starter recipe but I am glad that I had a packet of McCormick Stew seasoning. I had to use the whole packet to give the stew any flavor and to thicken the gravy. Won't use this one again.

This was a good base stew but as the other reviewers stated it made more of a broth than gravy.  Instead of using flour I coated my stew beef with a package of brown gravy mix followed the rest of the ingredients exactly, about 15 minutes before serving I thickened it with flour and water because we like stew with more gravy than broth.  Next time I will leave out the garlic the smell of it simmering all day just didn't smell like stew.  I served this with buttermilk biscuits, thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I really loved this Beef Stew. It had really good flavor.
The only thing I would do, is add more carrots, and celery. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!!

I am only giving this 4 stars because I tweaked with it. When adding as directed it didn't look like enough water so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to it and it came out great. I forgot to add garlic and didn't have bay leaf and it still was wonderful the whole family loved it. thanks!

NOT A BAD STEW BUT A LITTLE TOO BROTHY FOR ME.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT A BIT THICKER, MORE LIKE A GRAVY THAN A BROTH.  LOTS OF FLAVOR AND WAS NICE AND EASY TO PREPARE IN THE CROCK POT.

This stew is great!  I tweaked it only a little adding a small can of V-8 juice and a packet of onion soup mix.  I eventually used only enough flour to coat the meat (otherwise it was way too thick) and left out the Worcestershire sauce cause it was too spicy in conjunction with the V-8 juice.  Also, I've done with and without the celery and found no difference so it's your personal preference!  Enjoy!!!

I liked the meat and potatoes.  The gravy gets nice and thick.  I'm not sure what gave it the different flavor, maybe it was the worchestershire sauce or paprika.  I feel like I need to change something but I don't know what.  I ate the left overs for two days so I must have liked it.

Very good.  I browned the meat prior to adding it to the crock pot as some have suggested and added a splash of port wine to the crockpot.

I have made this recipe three times now.  The first time it was way to peppery and hot so I cut the ground black pepper in half.  I also added a 1/4 cup of ketchup and a 1/2 cup of peas to the recipe.  Very tasty, quick and easy to make.  A staple in our house. Thanks Nancy!

I made this the other night.  It was good but I'm wondering if all meat cooked in the slow cooker comes out with the same "slow cooker" flavor.  It seems that no matter how many spices I add, all the meats taste the same.  Am I doing something wrong?

Great Stew!!  I did add a packet of brown gravy mix to the flour, and I used one can of beef broth.  The last hour, I checked it, the taste was a little bland so I added Mrs. Dash garlic seasoning and M.D. "tomato, basil, oregano" seasoning.  That made it so yummy!  The only problem I had was that the potatoes never did get completely done.  Maybe I'll put them in the crock first next time and put everything else on top.

What I like about this recipe is that it's very quick and simple to make. And the beauty of it is that you're not limited to the vegetables listed in the ingredients. However I held back on the spices a little bit. A couple hours before it was finished I found it to be bland so I simply added a bit more spices. It was ok at first but was a perfect leftover. Goes well with white rice and bread can be used to "clean" your dish!

This is a fantastic recipe! I omitted the onion, as it tends to get a little "slimy" after being cooked so long. I took others suggestions and added the brown gravy packet to thicken. Perfect! My husband eats this spooned over Wonder Bread - a childhood comfort food favorite!

This one was OK.  My mom's is still better.  It tasted too much like celery.  Overpowering!
But.We all ate it.  I would not make it again.

Super.  The gravy was rather thin so I thickened it at the end, but very tasty.  The meat is so tender and tasty.

Some of the best beef stew I've ever had.  It is a bit spicy, but overall, it's a wonderful dish that was extremely easy to prepare.

this was so easy!!  could use a little more seasoning and 1 hour before done cooking I added a package of brown gravy prepared according to package directions, this really helped thicken the sauce.

This is really good. I did add three large cloves garlic, mixed the flour with salt, pepper, rosemary and thyme, tossed the meat in it, browned the meat and then tossed the remaining flour with the browned meat. I did have to add more broth halfway through since it got really dry. Good recipe though.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  While myt husband did seem to enjoy it, I found it quite tasteless.  It needs more salt and spices to give it a better flavour.

The recipe was easy to make and the fact that it was put into the slow cooker was great.  I had to add more liquid to the stew after a few hours though because it was to dry. Overall it was a god meal and leftovers are a good thing.

Pretty good stew, but a little bit bland. But most stews are pretty bland anyhow.
Needed a little more spice or something to give it a kick.

This stew was wonderful.  My husband and I loved it.  Browning the stew meat before putting it in the crockpot is a definite must.  I doubled all the ingredients to make a double portion and put some in my freezer.  I was thinking of making beef pot pies by putting a crust on the top and baking until done.  It would be great on a cold, winter evening.

I liked this, but next time I'll only use 1/2 as much paprika, and add more veggies. Very easy, lovely to come home to hot, bubbling stew on a frigid day.

Good recipe, I would cut the salt in half and use low-sodium beef broth.  The celery gave it a great aroma but, if you are low-temp cooking I suggest adding the celery halfway through so it doesn't get too soggy.

Very good stew.  I took some of the broth out of the stew and added flour to thicken and returned it to the crock pot for the last 1/2 hour.  It came out wonderful - thick and flavorful.

This recipe is perfect as written. I've made it many times, sometimes making additions or subtractions, depending on what I have on hand. No need to brown the beef or coat it with flour in a bag, defeats the  purpose of a quick, easy crock pot meal.

I did not like this at all.  It was very sweet and didn't have that rich beef flavor that I like.  The only thing I did differently was from a suggestion of shaking the meat in a plastic bag with the flour mixture and browning the meat first in a skillet with olive oil.  I'm not sure why the addition of paprika either.  I think this affected the overall taste as well.

It was a little heavy on potatoes for me. The taste was delicious. The next time I will cut back on potatoes, increase carrots and reduce the cooking time. Overall it was very food. Still delicious reheated in the microwave.

Love this beef stew!  I use a chuck roast and cut up myself.  I add more Worcestershire because I like the added flavor.  If I am using more than 2 lbs of meat for a bigger crowd,  will add more potatoes and carrots.  Fantastic!
I have also used a package of slow cooker beef stew seasonings mix instead of the flour and it was just as good.  Tried it as well is parsnips vs. potatoes.  Pretty good, but potatoes are better!  Everyone who has had my beef stew  raves about it.

Absolutely delicious! Made it last week and making it again. I added a  1/2 cup of flour instead of a 1/4c and an extra potato and carrot.  For the picky eaters I diced the celery and onion super small. (they had no idea that they were in it) I added a can of peas too after it was done cooking.  Easy to make.  Yum all the way. =O}

I have made it 3 times. My wife loves it, that's all that matter to me. Great flavor! Added a 1/2 lb more meat, browned and 1 teaspoon of cumin. Great leftovers for a winters lunch!

Came out really tasty. Next time I make it, I'll omit the salt since I'm trying to reduce my intake.

I did add a tbsp of crushed red pepper flakes, and that added some heat without it being overwhelming.

Family favorite. I started making this a year ago and my entire family absolutely loves it and looks forward to the days I make it for them. Super easy. Just throw it all in and go to work. Have a delicious hot pot of stew when you get home. Sometimes I even make it over night so that my husband can have it for lunch on a weekend I’m away. Best stew I’ve ever made.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was good but I felt that it was just missing something.... maybe a seasoning or tomato paste or maybe just a touch more pepper. But overall it was a good jumping off point and the house smelled delicious when I got home from work

I made this last night for dinner, and it was a big hit! I didn't have any beef broth, so I substituted an envelope of dry gravy mix in 1 1/2 cups of water. I also seared the meat before adding it to the slow cooker.

Great hearty stew!   The whole family enjoyed it.   Definitely a keeper!!  My daughter doesn't like celery, so I omitted the celery and added celery seed for flavor.  Added cubed up turnip just because I love it.  The rest is exactly as listed.

The only change I made was season the beef cubes, dredge them in flour, and brown them in oil prior to putting them in the slow cooker.

I made it according to the recipe and it was pretty good but even though it was done before the cooking time it was more like a glob of stuff on the spoon and the potatoes were way too done. Every thing was kind of mushy.

Better if you brown the beef after coating in herbed flour on the bottom of the stew pot before adding the vegetables and broth.

Also I added tomatoes (and sometimes other ’soft’ vegetables (usually capsicum)) for the last 30 minutes of cooking.

A great recipe for a simple and hearty winter meal.

This was yummy and very easy, thank you! I've made this twice now. This time, I added some extra spices to suit our family's taste buds (extra garlic, extra Worcestershire sauce, turmeric, Chicago steak seasoning & chicken bouillon) and used chicken broth instead of beef broth and potatoes instead of celery because it's what I had on hand. Cooked on high in Crock-Pot for 6 hours. Served it over white rice and it was very hearty, yummy and the meat was very tender. This served dinner for 4 with enough leftovers for everyone for lunch the next day. Liked by all, even the 3 yr old and the picky husband :).

Wow!  Mouth watering and delicious!  The meat is so tender and it's a family favorite.  Giving it 5 stars based on making the recipe exactly as written.  Over time, though, I've adjusted based on our family's taste: I've taken to using 1 can of beef broth because otherwise, there's a tiny bit left in the can that I always threw away.  Increased flour to 1/3 cup to accommodate the extra liquid.  I also use 2 bay leaves and 2 cloves of garlic.  Lately, I've also been adding 1 packet of slow cooker beef stew seasoning to give some extra flavor.  Delicious!  We're a family of four and it lasts us a couple of days.  I always serve with biscuits.  :)

Amazing beef stew as is. Not sure why people are making drastic unnecessary changes  to a delicious easy meal. Do people just want to spend extra time in the kitchen? Not me! Tasty, flavorful, hearty. Perfect for a fall or winter meal with a crusty bread on the side. Mm mm mmmmmm

I made this recipe and it was really good. I used veg broth bc I didn't have beef and I also didn't have bay leaves or Worchester sauce. I did add a beef oxo package though. I would recommend this recipe.

Like many other of the half wits commenting here, I am reviewing what I actually made which like all the other pointless offerings here wasn't this recipe at all.  In fact it turned out to be rice pudding which didn't use ANY of these ingredients and turned out nothing like beef stew. Unlike the other dim bulbs who place their recipes in this review space, I will post my rice pudding recipe in the rice pudding recipe section. You're welcome.

Used about 3 lbs. of meat but  kept the rest as written.  Entire family loved it and we had no left overs which is almost unheard of in my house.  It is a bit bland but that works for us.

It was easy and pretty good.  My only compliant was it was a little bland.  I needed to add more seasonings after it finished cooking.  I would make it again and add extra garlic, pepper, salt, onion, etc.  oh, and I did use 2 medium onions to start.

This was delicious!  The only thing I modified was to add more liquid and flour because we like more gravy.

I've actually made this twice before, just forget to mark it. We love it just the way it is. It's a great meal to cook on a cold day where you can smell it cooking.

This is by far the best beef stew recipe I have ever made, and it is so easy to make. I made the recipe as written except used a little more Worcestershire sauce. Awesome! My family and I love it.

Made a double batch of this beef stew. Had several friends try in and they all really liked it so it goes in my favor file. I enjoyed it also.
No left over. Yummy

I made this recipe and it turned out great!!!  The only thing that I changed, is that I did not add celery, (hate the stuff) and I added more garlic.

The meat was tender and the potatoes and carrots were just right.  Ate it with some bolillo's and it was a great meal.

First time making beef stew, cut recipe in half.  Did coat cubes in a bag, sauté in olive oil with onions.  Added beef and onions to crock pot.  Deglazed pan with beef broth, and 1/2 cup of red wine.  Followed recipe  adding all ingredients, turned out very good!

Healthy, hearty meal, budget friendly meal.  I didn't make any changes.  I let it cook on high for five hours. The meat was super tender. Light, homestyle flavors. I will make it again.

I add a table spoon of tomato paste, string beans and some other veggies I have on hand, this is a great starting point!  Experiment with flavors you’ll love it!

I’m so happy to have found this and have a great beef stew that can be literally thrown in the crockpot in minutes.  It’s delicious. Definitely do not need to brown the meat and x,y and z like some others suggested.

I made it in an oven roaster and it required about 2 extra cups of water at 250°F. It was great, used left overs to make a pot pie/shepherds pie.

Fabulous beef stew! I increased the recipe to 2.5 lbs of stew meat and nixed the garlic and bay leaf. I cooked on high for 6 hours, then low for 2. I bought some mini ciabatta rolls to go with this stew.  Will definitely be a go-to meal this winter!

Just a hot mess! Flavorless meat juice with mush for vegetables. I followed the recipe step by step. Don’t waste your time or money. Shredded the meat and made tacos.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. It was delicious!  Will definitely make this again. I let it cook overnight, put it in the fridge in the morning, and then reheated it when we were ready to eat. It was so pleasant waking up to the scent of cooking stew!

I just tried this out, and I think it turned out very well!  I probably did add more potatoes than what this calls for, but I love potatoes.  Nice and flavorful, and so easy to prep and make!

Delicious as is (except omitting celery, we don’t eat celery)!  Followed recipe & it turned out great.  Sure it could be modified to suit tastes, but it’s great as is.  Simple, quick & efficient for a come home to meal after a day @ work.

Really good beef stew. I will make it again. I forgot to buy onions at the store so I added a little onion salt and it was still very good. I will add onions next time. Very good comfort food.

This was pretty bland. I used 3 cloves of garlic, a teaspoon more of Worcestershire sauce and an extra onion. At the end i had to tweak it and add more seasoning.

Fabulous! I rarely leave reviews on anything. But after making this yesterday, I have to leave a review to say that I followed Corinne’s tweaks to this recipe and this is the  BEST beef stew I have ever had! Follow her tweaks. Only 1/2 cup of red wine and no more. This recipe is perfection

I used filet as my meat (expensive, but exquisite), and I used stock instead of broth. Stock has about 1/2 the sodium, so you may want to add some salt to taste. It was exactly what I was looking for- classic beef stew! Delicious!

Yummy! Good flavors! Light fat! House smells amazing! I used Yukon gold potatoes & they held up well for 4.5 hour on high in my crock pot! I will make again for chilly fall night!

Big hit at campground potluck. I added a small amount of cornstarch the last few minutes to make an even heartier gravy.

nowhere in the instructions does it say to braise the meat or prebrown it in any fashion. I have a slow cooker full of pink beef stew.

Tastes almost as good as my favorite non-slower cooker recipe but with almost zero work.  I followed the recipe to a T and the results are very good.   

I have a favorite beef stew recipe that produces more complex flavors but calls for browning the beef, making a tomato paste/flour/wine mixture, simmering a beef/broth/onion mixture, adding vegetables and simmering a second time.   Say 1.5 hours compared with 5 minutes.

I would recommend using very lean beef.  Since there isn't a browning step all the fat ends up in the finished stew.

22 years of marriage and this was the first stew I have ever made. It was delicious!!  I followed the instructions as listed, only increased amounts a bit since I had over 2 lbs of beef. I loved it. My family loved it. It was quick and simple - will definitely make it again!!

Very good taste but meat was done is in about 6-7 hours. I had to leave out the potatoes because of a low-carb diet but added more carrots and celery. Maybe that influenced the cook time? 10-12 hours seems excessive to me anyway.

This turned out really good. I put the flour, salt and pepper in a bowl with a lid and shook the meat up in it, then poured it all in the crockpot. I did add more beef broth to make it a little bit more soupy. Instead of chopping onions, next time I would probably use pearl onions. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I like veggies and a rich flavor so I doubled the seasonings, produce and broth. I added 1 packet of McCormicks Beef Stew Seasoning, 1/2 packet of dry ranch seasoning, and splashed in 1/2 glass cabernet wine. This dinner turned out amazing! The meat melted in your mouth without all the extra browning/sautéing  steps. You can tell this type of recipe is perfect WITHOUT any changes as well and very easy to follow. Excited and impressed on my first pot roast thanks to this recipe!! The house smelled delicious and my roommates loved it. I made cheesy Texas toast and a side salad to put everyone in a food coma. Can't wait to make this again for the holidays and cold weather!

I was looking for a recipe so that I could make fast.  This was it.  I flowered the beef in a bowl because I was having trouble getting it even in the slow cooker.  I doubled the paprika because I thought mine had no flavouring but it turned out that it did because it was spicy. We had two serving each it was that good.  Loved this

This was amazing!  Followed the recipe as written.  Wouldn't change a thing. I cut up a chuck roast because that's what I had on hand.  The meat was super tender.  Will always use that cut for stews now. Thank you for this recipe.

SO.GOOD. Didn't change a thing aside from using beef broth base with water because I didn't have any broth on hand. Definitely keeping this one!!

Two small changes. I left the skins on the potatoes and used baby carrots instead of regular carrots.
I will most certainly make this dish again!

This was amazing and not to mention some good mother daughter time making this. Once finished we had no left overs, so this will be made again.

This tasted rich and comforting on a cool night a couple weeks ago.  I usually make stew on the stove, but I loved the ease of my slow cooker and the smells permeating the house.  The flavor was wonderful.  I didn't change a thing and my husband loved it.

This was good - followed recipe and added about 1/2 cup dry red wine.  Smelled great, needs a little something else - maybe a tad more salt or some other herbs?  Was good but not awesome - maybe the leftovers will be better tomorrow?  LOL

It was a great “base” but pretty flavorless in my opinion. I had to add quite a bit of seasoning to make it something my family would actually eat. Mostly salt, ground pepper since by the time I taste tested it it was too late for cracked, and a few dashes of cajun seasoning (weird, I know, but it was amazing!) to give it a little personality and kick.

Basic stew recipe. Doctored it up a bit with more veggies, garlic, rosemary & thyme. Increased liquid to approximately 4 cups,  which included 1/2 cup of red wine. Thickened gravy with corn starch at the end.

simple and delicious!  I actually put it in the instant pot.  Cooked the meat and broth for a few hours on slow.  Then popped the veggies in and turned the pressure on for a while.  I also thicken it with gravy master and cornstarch.

I added the Worcestershire sauce, garlic, paprika, and a bay leaf and slow cooked the stew my mom made the night before that had all the other ingredients in this recipe but also canned green beans, corns, and tomatoes. I'm not huge on stew, but it wasn't bad.

Best beef stew I have ever made!  I used chuck roast and it was outstanding. This is one of our favorites now. Followed the recipe but increased broth and added package of beef stew seasonings, which thickened the liquid, making a gravy. Fantastic!!!

Nice, but I ended doing (2) crockpots (6 pounds of meat), whole pack of celery, one pound of carrots,  6 onions, 5 cloves of garlic, 8 potatoes, and 32 oz of stock.  I added parsley, and some chopped fresh tomatoes that needed a home.  Served with homemade bread; everyone wanted the leftovers.  I used chuck roast.

Great taste, easy recipe (I made it at 6 am this morning, half asleep). I wish the gravy were a touch thicker; next time I'll increase the flour to 1/3 c, but this is a great 'beginner' recipe.

Followed everything to the T. Turned out very tasteless... like no...taste...at...all.... added a beef stew packet and more salt, but that didn't help. Would have had more flavor and less sodium from a can of beef stew soup. 
 Who knows, maybe it will taste better tomorrow.

I followed the recipe as written. It was just alright. Mostly it made everyone's noses run. too spicy for some. 
I used hot Hungarian paprika, the only kind I had.

I just put it all together in my slow cooker and couldn't even see the broth. Slightly over 2 lbs of meat was used, 3 red potatoes, a small bag of baby carrots, 1 yellow onion and half a stalk of celery. The meat was coated just fine on the measurements given but I had to use 2 whole cartons of beef broth (Swanson less sodium) to get it to where I know a beef stew should be at. So then I added 2 more tsp of minced garlic (3 total), another 1/4 tsp of paprika, substituted the bay leaf for ground thyme (1/2 tsp total), and added a couple more dashes of Worcestershire sauce. I taught myself to cook by smell so I gave it a whiff and it smells how a beef stew should. Right on target. So if you use the measurements on this recipe I'd say cut the meat and veggies in half or double the liquids and herbs.

I have made this stew so many times and I love it. Sometimes I do it just as the recipe says, other times I add other veggies that I have in my fridge that need to be used stat. Tonight I used sweet potato instead or normal, and I tossed in some mushrooms. Yummmmm. It's a favourite for cold winter nights like this.
(Also, I sometimes strain the liquid into a jug when everything is cooked, make a roux of flour and butter in a pot on the stove and then slowly whisk the stew liquid in so it makes a nice thick gravy/sauce which I then add back to the stew)

Simple to make and delicious. I used small red potatoes in place of regular potatoes and added a little cocoa and Guinness.

Flavour was "up there" like we get when using a pressure cooker from the 1980's.

Love this one! Super simple to make, and perfect in my smaller slow cooker if I cut the recipe in half. Works for several meals for just me! Also works great with bone broth as a swap in. Did that on accident once, and have always done it since. Simple, easy, filling, hard to screw up!

This is the third time I made this stew and it was great every time. I wanted leftovers this time since my family loved it, so I doubled the recipe. I made a little extra gravy and added frozen peas this time, but that was my only change. Why mess with perfection? Thanks for such a great recipe. So easy to throw together in the morning and have a fantastic meal in the evening.

Love love love this recipe! I had been craving a hearty meal with enough vegetables to bring me the nourishment I had been lacking. This recipe did the trick, and much more.  Tender tender meat, an array of veggies, enlivening and savory flavors. I will definitely be using this deeelicious recipe more often.

I will make it again but I did make some changes and it came out great.  I added 1.5 tsp of "Better than Bouillion" that was dissolved in boiling water along w/ a Lipton soup mix packet. I added beef broth as well to cover the stew.  I guess we enjoy salt in our family. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was very flavorful.

Make as directed! Browning the meat ruins it, I've tried both ways. Literally dump the ingredients in turn your crockpot on and leave it alone all day! You won't be disappointed.

I made this as one other reviewer did by browning the meat, deglazing the pan with red wine, and some additional spices. One of the best crockpot meals I've made in a while. Use a wine you would drink for the deglazing. Look up wine types that are suggested for steak or beef stew. I used a 6 year old red blend.

Awesome flavor using a tri-tip as the beef; a little more garlic than a clove and used tiny new potatoes with organic carrots closed for a wonderful flavor with Wegman's organic beef broth.

This stew is fantastic, I make it all the time.  I love the fact that you don't have to brown the beef first - it's a real time saver and I cannot taste any difference between the two methods.  The only things I change is that I add about a tsp of dried rosemary, and about 2 hours before the stew is finished I add  a cup of quartered button mushrooms.

It was good. Made as is. Would recommend adding some extra spices as it was just a tad bland. But easy to make and the kids ate it so winner by those standards.

This is an excellent recipe, and tastes even better the day after, if that’s possible.  I did add 3 TBS of tomato paste to the beef broth (whisked it in), as I’ve done that with other recipes to give it an enhanced flavor.

Oh my goodness!!  This was easy to prepare and delicious for a cold winter evening!  It's not fussy!  I did add a healthy portion of a good cabernet to the recipe.  Other than that, I followed it to the letter. I will make this again!!

I added some thyme and cooking sherry and it really enhanced the flavor of the broth. Very thick and hearty. Great recipe for a below zero day here in the Midwest.....Yummy!!

I followed the recipe exactly hoping it would be good enough to bring to an upcoming potluck. Everything just tasted like mush.

Followed the recipe as written.  I did add mushrooms because I had some in the frig.  The stew was easy and awesome.  Will be making it again soon for my son and his wife as they welcome their first baby into our family.

I can't believe this has such good reviews! I made this tonight, followed the directions perfectly and it's the most bland stew I've ever had! Nothing special at all. Actually mad after trying it.

I made the recipe as written. We prefer our stews thicker, this one is very watery. I added cornstarch to thicken it up some. It really didn't have much flavor. It's nice to have as a base recipe that you can add different things to depending on your mood.

Followed the recipe exactly and cooked it on high for 4 hours. Potatoes, meat and flour burned on to the bottom of the crockpot and there was no liquid left. Ended up adding another 3/4 cup of beef broth and cooking for another 30 minutes. 
Edible but bland. Won’t make again.

I made this on the stovetop and tweaked it just a little.  I browned the meat and onions together then doubled the broth (we like it with lots of liquid so we can make Bisquick dumplings on top at the end).  I added the spices/seasonings to the broth and let it simmer covered for a couple hours, added veggies and let it go another hour.  Then we finish with the dumplings.  It was a beautiful, rich and savory stew.

Overall the flavors blended well, but I didn’t like the taste of the flour to brown the beef before putting it into the crock pot as the suggested alternative.  I will try it next time just as the original recipe suggests.  I will also see if I can cut the recipe in half because I’ll never get around to eating all of this even with freezing it.

I made a few changes as others had.  I dredged the meat (only one pound instead of 2 as I'd rather have more veg) in flour  (with salt and pepper), pan fried it in olive oil to seal in the juices and transferred it to the slow cooker.  Also, I was out while it was nearly cooked. Upon arriving back and checking the crock pot, I noticed there was not nearly enough broth as the meat was burning and everything was stuck to the bottom.  I added a lot more of the broth until it was the consistency I desired.  Delish!!!

I made this the other day & it was delicious. The only change I made was to leave out the bay leaf because I don't care for them. I also added a dash of wine & a little more thickening at the end of the cooking time because I like a thicker gravy. I will be making this again!

No more browning meat before adding to crock pot. This was very easy to make. I did adjust the quantity I made as it is only my husband and I. Cooked about 4 hours then added potatoes and carrots, cooking another 2 hours. Meat was very tender and it made its own gravy. I love that.

I made the recipe as stated.  It was easy to put together and I was pleased with the result.  I am not a picky eater though.  We used stew meat from Aldi, red potatoes that I chopped up, a yellow onion, beef broth from Aldi, and some carrots that I peeled and cut. No celery.  Cooked on high for 4 ours, then it sat on warm for another 2. The gravy was a nice consistency.  I also liked the texture of the meat, even though it wasn't browned beforehand. Next time I would salt the meat a little bit before tossing it in the flour.  This was great to throw together fast and end up with a great end result :)  Thank you!

I would not change a thing. Perfectly seasoned. 
I cooked on high for 4 hours and that was enough.

Very good and easy to make. Only change I made is a lot more garlic and added whole bag of baby carrots. It is very mild in spice.  I prefer a lot more salt but that’s easily added.

This is incredibly easy to make and comes out amazing. You can improvise and add more veggies if desired. I've passed this recipe along to others who've also raved about how easy and how good it comes out. Perfect meal in the winter.

It was the first time I made beef stew in a slow cooker and this recipe was delicious.  I did have to add another cup of beef broth and one half cup of water to make it more soupy because it literally boiled down to hardly no broth by hour 3.

I've made this a few times now with the following mods:
- browned meat in cast iron in beef tallow
- cooked onions in tallow and beef juices until soft
- deglaze pan with red wine and added deglaze sauce
- used 1tbsp Worcestershire instead of 1tsp
- 2 Bay leaves
- 2 cup bone broth instead of 1.5c beef broth

30 min on high in InstaPot

IMO, it's the best stew I've ever made.

Both teens and parents enjoyed this stew, and it was easy to make!  Changes for next time: I will probably add another potato, and 2 more carrots or so, as I didn't feel like there was a good enough balance of vegetables, compared to meat.  The recipe could use some more!  Also, instead of only using 1-1/2 cups of broth, I would go ahead and use 2 cups.....  The meat cubes that were on the top got browned and dried, because there was not enough broth to cover it all.  Other than that, it worked for me.....  a good, hearty meal that warms the house, on a chilly winter day!

Pretty good, a little bland. I added some beef bullion, and about a teas each  rosemary and thyme.  I'm sure I could have done more tweaking but I was making it for a kids sleepover and it was yummy for them.

I think it should have said to add water as it sure didn't go very far, but hubby loved it.  There's only two of us and there was only one serving left for him to take for his lunch the next day.

I applied the Corinne mods and it tasted great.  I started cooking too late, though, and my carrots and spuds were slightly under-done.  I cooked for 8 hours, but it really needed 10, I think.

The ONLY Beef Stew I’ll ever make!!

The one and only thing I added was a packet of Crockery Gourmet Seasoning Mix for Beef...everything else is to the T of the recipe.   Adding the packet just intensified the flavor to a melt in your mouth tasty stew.

This was the simplest yet one of the most delicious crockpot meals I've ever made. I used some left over steak we had sitting around in our freezer and added a little more salt than prescribed. Other than that I stuck to the recipe to the T and it's really tasty. I served it over rice to bulk up the meal, definitely will add this to the cook book.

I started out by following the recipe almost exactly - but ended up having to make some adjustments. I’m giving the original recipe 4-stars. I found this to need significantly more liquid - I added an extra 1-cup of beef broth towards the end of the cooking time. I also found the flavor to be seriously lacking and so I used a lot more Worcestershire sauce (2 Tbsp vs the originally called for 1 tsp) and also added about 1/4 cup of tomato paste and 1 tsp of dried herbes de Provence. Additionally, I bulked up the veggies to 4 potatoes, 4 carrots and 3 stalks of celery and added the veggies about halfway through the cooking time so they didn’t turn to mush. We were very happy with the way this turned out after the adjustments made (my 18-month old daughter even ate it!) but as is it was pretty bland.

Best stew I ever made in crockpot!  Only adjustment was to add a packet of dried French Onion Mix.  Next time will add less potatoes and more carrots/celery.  Thanks for sharing this easy and tasty stew recipe!

ps.  To those complaining about reviews - the "rate and review" section asks for adjustments and suggestions.  That's why there is a rate and review.  Please stop being so critical.

Easiest beef stew I ever made. The basic flavors were good, just a little on the bland side for my taste.   After cooking for several hours, I adjusted the salt and pepper and added one envelope of Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix and about 2 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning.  I'll make this again but next time will up the amount of onions and spices at the beginning and probably omit the soup mix.

I followed Corinne's browning of meat & deglazing with wine.
I will definitely add more salt or packet of McCormack Stew Seasoning, or dried onion soup. Perhaps can of crushed tomatoes.

Very good recipe!  Like some others, I did brown the meat first because I like a little crust on my meat, and it's easy enough to do because my crock pot has a sautee feature so I don't need to dirty another pan.  I used pearl onions, added red wine, mushrooms, and some additional herbs and spices just to zest it up a little.  Good and hearty!

I made the recipe as written and it turned out great! For my taste, I added seasoning salt but it’s fine either way. Next time I think I may added mushrooms, but again, it’s a great beef stew and pretty forgiving of whatever cut of beef you use. Be mindful of YOUR crockpot though. Mine cooks pretty fast so it was done in about 3 ½ hours on high. Next time I will make my family some delicious cornbread to go with it! Yum!

I did follow the recommendation of other reviewers to increase the flour and coated meat prior to sautéing, as well as adding Worcestershire, red wine and about a tablespoon of tomato paste. It was excellent and I will definitely make it again.

Amazing, I cooked it for the 4 to 6 hours on high because my time management wasn't very good.  Turned out great, will definitely make it again

November-December kinda stew, I add jalapeños, tomatoes, and lots of garlic and peppers in addition to what they recommend and some Arabian spices to give it some more flavor. House smells amazing when this is cooking up and it’ll last us a few days.

I didn't make any changes; i followed the recipe, but I found it to be quite bland. A good punch of flavor, and it would likely be fanastic.

I made this beef stew and it was my husbands favorite! I actually  don't even eat meat, so I didn't try it, but I will definitely be making this again soon! It's super easy. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I used balsamic vinaigrette instead. Make sure to season the beef.

Delicious!!!! It is a keeper!!! Simple!!! Tasty!!! I have to admit that I added a couple of extra ingredients because I want the Sabor Boricua in my stew. So this is what I did! I Seasoned the meat with Adobo and Sazón with culantro and achiote for color. Browned the meat,  add Sofrito with the rest of the ingredients and a large can of stew tomatoes. I left the broth for last to be able to control the amount of liquid in my stew. I didn’t want it to be too runny!

I made this last night fo company, and we all liked it...a lot. I made it  just like the recipe without the celery: just my preference, but I don't like celery in stew, just in soups. No need to brown meat first. Based on one other review, I added 1/2 extra cup (2 total ) of the beef broth, cooked it on low for 5 1/2 hours,adding a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the gravy. I felt like that was a mistake, it was too thick for my taste. I also added 4 oz. of sliced mushrooms towards the end. They really don't change the taste, just add another texture. I feel like this is a great stew, especially if you have children. You can add or omit any veg you like,according to your family's taste . Beefy, comforting, delicious.  It made 4 generous servings. This is very similar to the beef stew I grew up on.

TODAY....I made again, omitting celery, added 1/2 cup red wine, increased Worchestershire to 1 TBSP, 2 bay leaves. Added mushrooms the last 1 1/2 hours, and frozen peas, the last 1/2 hour. I did not make a slurry,and the sauce is perfect, as is the taste. It is a little more rustic, a little more seasoned and rich with the addition of the wine and Worchetershire. I gave a five based on the original recipe, as it is delicious, and a perfect family meal. All good cooks know that you cook, taste, and adjust to your  taste. If I had TOTALLY turned it around, like many reviewers, I would submit my own recipe. It does a disservice to the original recipe, and is not helpful to t

Followed recipe exactly and it was very good but I like my stew more thick, so I added more flour to the broth on the stovetop and added it back in to make it thicker.  I think next time I will add the stew seasoning mix as well.  Very good base recipe and it’s good as written but I’d make my own changes next time.

I made this yesterday for dinner and it was wonderful! I only bought a pound of stew meat, so I halved the recipe. I also didn’t have an onion or celery, so I added some more dried spices. It was delicious! I will absolutely make it again, it was so easy.

Delicious easy meal!  I left out potatoes and made mashed instead... since they're were so many vegetables I didn't want it to be soupy so I added 1 tbsp of plain tapioca to thicken the sauce.  Absolutely delicious and easy. I'll be making again.

I caramelized the onions in olive oil and butter then browned the floured and seasoned beef cubes in the same pan. Put that and veggies and rest of ingredients in slow cooker. It was delicious and my kids and grandkids loved it.

I omitted the onion, garlic and celery, yet these ingredients were not missed.  For beef broth, I used beef stock. Served over rice, the recipe was delicious, and I would definitely make this again.

I used a large can of tomatoes and about 1 cup of red wine as I did not have any beef broth. I also used some celery seed as I did not have any celery. Otherwise I made it as written and it was easy and delicious.

This is a terrific basic stew but like all crockpot dishes, it needs "finishing" at the end. I made it exactly as written, with the small exception of using 2 cloves of garlic rather than one. To finish it, I added a splash of dry red wine 30 minutes before serving and then sprinkled a small handful of shredded Colby-Jack cheese on top to serve. It was very good, very hearty. It could be finished with plenty of other things too, maybe sour cream, chives, fresh chopped onions, etc.

Tasted and found it bland.  For those like Lee L who knock those who post ''adaptations'' ...some of us love them as in Corrine's version.  I ALSO ADDED THE PACKET OF STEW SEASONING.  100% improvement.  Worth the few additives to me and thickens a bit....cut salt tho.

I felt it needed more flavor.
I added some Better tha N Boullion and a few sliced mushrooms.
I may make this again , but it didn’t really stand out any better than many other beef stew recipes.

OMG! This turned out so delicious! Only change I made was to add 2 cloves of garlic just because I love garlic and it tastes so good especially since it was so super easy to make! Thanks so much, I will be making this a lot!

My changes after making this a few times were to brown my meat in bacon grease ( like my Grandmother  did )and add a can of petite diced tomatoes just because it made the flavor more like my Grandmother's beef stew.  This is better the next day so I always make it a day ahead.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!!!!

Made exactly as written and we loved it. So happy not to have to brown meat first, just toss into the slow cooker..what could be easier?! Next time, if there is room left in the pot, I will add a chopped up turnip..just because we love turnip in beef stew. Thank you for sharing this!

Make it gluten free by substituting 2 TBSP of Tapioca Pearls for the flour. This is a great stew and it really is as tasty and easy as the recipe says.

Rather than to use beef we used baby calf hearts and prepared it as suggested except we left the potatoes whole. We also added turnips and whole mushrooms and a small bottle of Merlot wine.  Wonderful.  Not a spoonful left over.

I grabbed the smoked paprika, it was excellent!  I would absolutely add more, maybe even twice the beef broth. This my new “go to” recipe for beef stew.

Easy and delicious?! Yes is was. I used baby red skinned potatoes and added peas instead of green beans. My favorite part was how tender the meat got. Will definitely make again.

It’s delicious and simple but, it only took 5 hours on low for mine to be done. I think it depends on the crock you have.

Meh. I found this to be okay, but the flavour was seriously boring and I followed this recipe to a T (I did double it though).

If you like super mild tastes then this is not bad, but you can tell how little flavour it has from the near non-existant amount of spices in the recipe.

First try: followed the basic recipe, just added some quantity -- 2.5 lbs bottom round, 1 lb sliced baby bella mushrooms, an extra potato, about 2 cloves' worth of minced garlic, and a total 1 lb of baby carrots. Upped the beef stock to 2.5 cups to account for the extra quantity, and left out the bay leaf because I don't keep them on hand. 

- About 5 hours into cooking (on high), I added a roux of 1/4c butter and 1/2c flour, because the liquid was more souplike than stewlike, and that thickened it up beautifully. Served it up after 6 hours on high, and the texture was wonderful, both of the ingredients and the stew liquid. It ended up a bit bland for my taste, but I look forward to trying to remedy that on future tries by altering spices.

--- Second try: 2lbs meat, 1 large baking potato, 1lb carrots, 1/2lb mushrooms, 3 ribs celery, 2 cups broth, 2 cloves garlic, extra salt + pepper + Worcestershire, fresher paprika. cooked on high for first hour, then low for about 6. near end of cooking time, added small amounts (less than 1/4 tsp each) of thyme, cinnamon, and soy sauce to punch up the flavor, plus a beurre manie of 3tbsp flour + 2tbsp butter to thicken the sauce. really deepened the flavor, and turned out purely lovely

This is a wonderful basic beef stew recipe. I’ve made it several times but with a few of my own personal tweaks (more beef, less potatoes, no celery, etc.). I don’t feel it’s necessary to sauté anything, why make work? Just season the beef with the flour and seasonings in a big plastic bag and then plunk it in the crockpot, adding your own personal touches. It’s so easy. I also add a pack of McCormick's beef stew seasoning. 

During the last 45 minutes or so of cooking I add a 16oz. bag of frozen peas, which makes it colorful and even more nutritious. Fabulous!

Fantastic! Make a double batch for leftovers. You’ll wish you had. I used 2 teaspoons of maple balsamic vinegar ( had on hand) in place of worcestershire sauce.

I only used one pound of beef and it was more than enough. I also added more liquid because I didn't want it super thick, I like having a bit of liquid to dip bread or buns or something in. Though over all very delicious!

FOR RICHER FLAVOR ADD: 1 can diced tomatoes and 3 oz (1/2 small can) tomato paste.
Reduce beef broth to 1 1/4 c.
Add seasoning salt to taste (I prefer liberal amounts of Johnny's).
Step 1: Mix flour, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper into a gallon Ziploc bag then add stew meat and shake well.
Step 2: Combine meat with all other ingredients in crock pot on High for 4 hrs.
Good simple crockpot stew!

I followed the recipe exactly (except I cut it in half for my small slow cooker) and I think this is a great tasting stew. I did add a little more salt and some corn starch after it was done cooking to thicken it but those are just personal preferences.  I will definitely make this stew again!

I thought overall the recipe was good, however I cooked it for 10 hours on low and there was no liquid and while the meat was nice and tender, it had completely fallen apart. I also thought it needed more seasoning.

EXcellent starter recipe, I added peas and mushrooms, but who needs a cleanup tip when you have only used one pot? Crockpot liners are dumb and wasteful, plus adding plastic to your food is unwise.

Easy to make but not enough flavor. Base recipe needs more spice and vegetables. I added additional carrots and celery. I will try a different recipe next time.

I browned the meat in a skillet before adding to the crock which wasnt listed. 
I added an extra celery stock, potatoes, and stock to it. Easy dish to prepare. I also added more of the seasonings and sauce than requested. Could use some other herbs like rosemary or thyme to help add a little more flavor and aroma to the dish. 
It did taste good, and was easy to do. I like to use cooking recipees as just ideas, inspirations, and how tos for how to prepare certain types of dishes, then move away and make it to taste. 
Great recipee to teach how to make beef stew though.

It doesn't get any easier than this and it was delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I may add other veggies in the future but it was delightful as written.

I'll start off by saying I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  It was extremely easy and I was skeptical because you did not brown the beef first.  However, it turned out very well.  I did not give it 5 stars as I did have to add some more spices (I added kitchen bouquet after the stew was all cooked and we tasted it).  What i really liked about this recipe was the fact that it was quick and while not exactly with the same depth of flavor a "traditional" stew has, very good. I will definitely make it again, especially if I need a good flavorful hearty meal in a hurry

Super easy and tastes great. I follow the directions and don't brown the meat. Changes I make: A bit more garlic and celery, a large sweet onion, one more bay leaf, 14.5 oz can of reduced-sodium beef broth.

I save the carrots to go in after 2/3 cooking time (using 12 oz of mini baby carrots), and add them with 12 oz snapped fresh green beans and 8 oz fresh sliced mushrooms.

The extra fluid makes for a slightly thinner sauce, but since I use lean meat, add more vegetables, and freeze in portions as whole meals, that helps moisturize the meat.

Great recipe! I made it several times "as is" without any modifications other than occasionally using chicken broth instead of beef, and excluding celery (not a fan). I tried browning the meat one time. But quite frankly I wouldn't say it tasted much different, especially after 8 hours of slow cooking. All it really does is just giving your meat a nice color, but other than and I think it's just an unnecessary extra step that takes more time.

Although Corinne's version sounds good too. Maybe I'll try that next time.

Made this dish again today.  Grandchildren didn't want onions in it, so I replaced them with half of an envelope of Lipton Onion soup mix. No leftovers, the family loved it ! Will definitely be making this again!

I used cornstarch instead of flour since I am sensitive to gluten and I used almost 2 cups of broth, everything else as directed by the recipe.  It was fabulous!  The whole family loved it. 
This is now my go-to beef stew recipe.

Followed the recipe by the note and turned out great. Had to add a little bit more salt overall but not too much because I was trying to make it healthy anyway. Kids loved it!!! Made white rice on the side and was a tasty combo.

I didn't like it. It was barely okay. Some improvements might be adding peas, and changing the seasonings. Also, I would not add the vegetables at the beginning.

I had to give this recipe 5 stars as it is a good basic beef stew as written. I doubled the recipe, added extra on the veggies, and added 1/2 cup red wine. For the beef broth, I used homemade beef broth that I always keep on hand. Broth from the store has less food value and less taste. After I put in the 3 cups of broth for a double recipe, it didn't look like enough, so I added another 3 cups to almost cover everything. At this point, it didn't fit in my 6-quart slow cooker, so I poured it all into a stock pot, and cooked it on my NuWave cook top at 195 degrees for 12 hours. I did have to add a corn starch/water mixture (3 T. corn starch and 3 T. water) to thicken the gravy. Next time, I will cut back on the broth quantity so there isn't so much gravy, although more gravy would be better over mashed potatoes or noodles. One suggestion I would have for other trying this stew is to cut the meat into 2" x 2" squares since it shrinks to half during the cook time.

Delicious. Exactly what you expect stew to be. I made this according to the recipe (minus the celery - not a fan) and it is delicious. You don't need to change a thing. Let this recipe be as simple as it was intended and you will get a great beef stew.

This recipe was super easy to make and was delicious! I added a little more broth because I like more gravy. Oh and I added more Worcester sauce.I didn't have any celery or paprika but the next time I make it I'll try the paprika. It was super yummy deliciousness! Will definitely make it again.

Awesome stew, followed Corinne’s additions to the recipe and was not disappointed. I basically doubled the recipe with all ingredients... ok the wine bottle might have slipped and a little extra went in... but it turned out great. Surely to be a mainstay in this house from now on!

This was awesome!!!  Cooked it 5 hours on Low.  Had left over mashed potatoes; used them as a side and left the potatoes out of the stew.  Also, added string beans.

Best stew I've ever had!!

It was a little dry and the meat was a little too plain for my family. If I make this again, I will season the meat a little before putting it in the crock pot, add another clove of garlic or a shallot or two and I will probably add another can of Beef Broth or a can of Cream of Onion soup.

This stew is  simple and delicious. I threw everything into the slower cooker and served it 8 hours later.  No need to make dinner harder than it needs to be. Everyone loved it.

I didn't change much bc I wanted to try the recipe as is.  I loved the simplicity of the prep and ingredients. Everyone liked it at our house so I'll be making it again. The only thing I changed was I highly recommend using "better than bullion" roasted beef base  sooo much more flavor than even the broth you can buy in a container. Also, I added peas at the end and more garlic bc I love garlic :)

If you feel the need to change the recipe then post your own recipe, "superb recipe but here is what I did"... after 20 changes.... nobody cares about your adaptation. Get a life people. The recipe is fine as is.

This stew was really good. I tweaked it a little as follows since I am on a low sodium diet.  I added two more carrots, one more potato, McCormick Herb Gravy Mix, two small cans no salt tomato sauce and omitted the salt, garlic and bay leaf. The gravy was really good. I cooked for 4-1/2 hours on high - carrots and meat could have cooked longer. Would do 6 hours next time

Very bland, there is a definite lack of seasoning here.The sauce was extremely thin and not gravy like in a traditional stew. Also we only used 2 (not 3 like the recipe called for) potatoes and it was too much and one stalk of celery was definitely not enough.

I like adding a little more garlic myself, but it's great the way it is!

like some of the other reviewers, I wonder why people don't  just submit their own recipe.  I made this stew exactly as written, it was excellent.  my hubby said it was the best stew I've ever made!  it was super easy as well, I got everything ready the night before, put my crock pot in the fridge and plugged it in the next morning.  I love that you don't need to brown the meat first. (who has time for that?)  very good recipe, it's a keeper.  thanks

Easy and good, but not spectacular. A little too watery. I thought it needed a bit more salt.  A keeper bc of the ease and the family likes meat. One of my go-to meals when boneless beef stew meat cubes are on sale.

I made this recipe exactly as written with quality, organic ingredients. I found it to be quite bland. It is very under salted. I ended up adding a fair amount more salt, along with garlic powder and onion powder to it after having a bowl of it as is. It improved to mediocre. I don't plan on making this again and wouldn't recommend it.

The only changes that  I made were adding broccoli, cauliflower,fresh green beans and turnip( the only leftover in my fridge).  It turned out to be the tastiest stew I ever made.  I did add a bit of Mrs. Dash garlic and herb spice and some minced onion( My husband doesn't like the texture of chopped onions. I did grate some fresh onion.  I will  make this  again.   A very  healthy dish.

My entire family loved this recipe as Is! Bought some bread bowls and served the beef stew in the bread bowls. Making the same recipe for two households that I manage and serving it the same way, in bread bowls ( I buy my bowls from Panera), can't wait to see how they like it :)
I add just a bit more broth so you have a side of broth for dunking the cut bread out of the bread bowls. SUPER YUMMY!

I’m going to make this recipe for my dads 88th Birthday dinner tomorrow night .  All/Recipe is my GoTo for delicious meals! I’m going to make the 1st One, the original posted recipe. Which is same as video. I have been using AR for several yrs now. It saddened me tonight to see all the pettiness & disrespect on this board. I believe it’s for reviewing recipes of FOOD Not each other’s post ! I’m praying AR is not the new Twitter ! It’s a disgrace the way ppl talk to each other. Thank you technology A way for humans to tear each other up & down, provoke each other for no good reason. Other than to give an opinion bc every one that has One thinks they are Right ! Lord Pray for us All

This came out great. The only changes I made was adding Italian seasoning to the flour  and a parmagiano reggiano rind.  I also cut it in 1/2 but used a whole can of broth.

While the flavor was good, there was almost no liquid. I double checked the recipe and there is only the 1 and 1/2 cups of broth for liquid. Not much "stew" in the stew.

This was so bland - I have no idea why it has such rave reviews. I made the recipe exactly as stated with the addition of red wine and extra Worcestershire sauce. It came out watery and bland AF. Definitely won't be making this again.

I followed Corinne's review of more flour (I prefer a richer sauce), more garlic and bay leaf etc. and browned meat and onion etc. etc. BUT it came out on the salty side.  Perhaps it was the addition of the McCormick Beef Stew package?  I dunno.  Only put in 2 potatoes as I like my stew on noodles.  Next time I'll use reduced sodium beef broth just in case.  I do love my sodium!  But my lips got pruned :)  I figure I can always ADD salt if needed.  It's harder to get it out, right?  Might also toss in frozen peas just for kicks and color.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it is my go-to  beef stew.  On different days I have had to make changes depending on what I had available in the kitchen, but it is a great recipe as written!  Today when I made it I realized I had no potatoes so I made it without and poured it over mashed potatoes.  Perfect!

This is a KEEPER! My whole family LOVED it. I did add more cornstarch, I like stew a littler thicker.  I also cheated and used frozen pre cut potatoes and added them in the last 10 minutes. Just to add another veggie, I added green beans to the mix.  YUM!

I copied the recipe suggestion from Miss Corinne. It’s my first time making Beef Stew, and first perfectly made dish in my slow cooker. I totally suggest following her recipe, it really is like your moms kitchen.

Only changed the amount of meat to1 lb. I will definitely  make again for the ease of it . After  i had it as is . I added a can of corn . If i wanted to go thru the trouble of browning and deglazing i would of just made in a pot. Growing up corn was always in stew . But I agree with Susanna.

I made this stew based on the 4.5/5 star ratings from over 4K reviewers. Unfortunately, I fail to understand how it is rated so highly. It was the first and last time I’ll use this recipe. Like many others, I had to make modifications such as doubling the beef broth (the amount in the recipe wasn’t nearly enough to accommodate the other ingredients) and doubling the amount of carrots and celery (the amount called for just did not look like much at all, unless you don’t like veggies). In the end, it turned out extremely bland. I do like the fact that the recipe was simple to follow as well as it taking nearly no time at all to prep. My 9yr old picky eater wouldn’t touch it (no surprise); my husband and I had one bowl and saved the remaining stew hoping it might have more flavor the next day- it didn’t. I was really looking forward to this recipe, but it’s just not something that tastes very good. If this was a dish at your favorite restaurant, you wouldn’t be ordering this more than once.

Came out great, I wanted a stew for the crock pot without a lot of prep. This worked I cut up all of the vegetables the night before and left them in a big measuring cup in the broth, except the potatoes. Put everything in the crock before going to work and added the potatoes when I got home and let them cook on high until done. I did use parsnip instead of carrot because we had a fresh bag. It was great and we will do this again! Thanks Steve

Turned out pretty good. I would recommend leaving out the garlic though, it can be a bit overpowering. I also added more veggies and doubled the beef stock.

It's an OK recipe, but needs tweaks.
1) I sub'd Celery for Asparagus.
2) I used Smoked Paprika, and more of it.
3) I used more Spuds and Veggies w/ the specified amount of beef or more. You will have a 'beefier' stew and more of it.
4) The beef should be lightly browned in a pan before going into the pot, because you may have too much saturated fat in your stew otherwise, even if you trimmed your beef. Unless sat fat is your thing, then drop it in. There won't be that much of a difference in texture and/or taste.

I enjoyed this recipe above most others.  It's much simpler to put everything in the slow cooker and for the most part leave it untouched.   I'd recommend if you want to pan fry your meat in oil.. use  a different recipe since this recipe is based on a one dish meal. I added a little more potato and carrots,  and used 1/3 cup flour instead of 1/4. The only notable difference I made though to the recipe, is I put the flour in the stew as a thickening agent instead of coating the meat with it. I like a flavorful sauce... otherwise I wouldn't be using  a slow cooker. My wife and family all love din and I plan to keep this recipe in my kitchen.

I adjusted the recipe to be gluten-free, using GF Bisquick with  1 Tbsp arrowroot.  Used 1/2 C of that mixture to toss the meat using gallon plastic bag.  No need to saute' the meat separately.  Turned out tender and succulent.  I replaced Worcestershire sauce with A-1 steak sauce due to availability and added a Tbsp of Merlot.  The flavor pop was fabulous.  Made a large batch to make freezer meals!  Even better rewarmed!

Fantastic Find!!  Superb flavor, this is by far the best recipe for Beef Stew and I've been making it for years.  Following some of the comments I also made some changes...  I added a packet of  Beef Stew Seasoning Mix and a 14.5 oz can of beef broth and since I didn't have paprika I substituted with Sriacha Seasoning (which gave it a little too much bite) I also put in a dash of celery seed and a some fresh parsley.  I then added all the other ingredients, although I did add more of the carrots and potatoes.  I cooked the stew on high for 5 hours, stirring every 40 minutes.

So easy, so good. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I omitted it. Still very good.

My husband and kids love this beef stew. It’s one of our go to recipes. I recently got an Instant Pot and tried making this using the slow cooker function but it doesn’t taste the same as it does in my crock pot. Does anyone have any recommendations on making this in the instant pot using slow cooker function? I really do want to set this in the morning and leave for 8 hrs -  not looking to use the pressure cooking method to speed up the process at all.

Easy to assemble and make.  It took less time than I anticipated to get everything together.  The result was delicious, I will definitely make it again.

I added two tablespoons of tomato paste and subbed in some of the water for red wine.  Doubled the garlic, celery, and added 50% more pepper.  Delicious!

I have made this recipe Buchko's way and acc to Corinne's review. I was thrilled that it worked out just fine w/o pre-browning beef. (Browning the beef cubes on as many sides as possible as Beef Institute recommends renders a very dark, rich gravy so if you have the time it can't hurt, of course.) I have a 6 quart crockpot so to fill the crock with stew I used the 2 lbs of beef, 1 onion, and 1/2 tsp pepper but I tripled the flour to 3/4 cup and poured in the full 32 oz vacuum-packed box of beef broth at the end. Made plenty of gravy!  I had added plenty of those small roasting potatoes, whole; an extra carrot or two and additional celery. The liquid then covered the ingredients almost completely which I understand is important when braising meat. The seasonings I played with, too. I didn't want to triple all the herbs necessarily but trying to make a flavorful stew is a challenge. I added a small kick of heat with 1/2 teaspoon of Spicely Organic Rib Eye Seasoning. That's the small economical boxes of organic herbs you can find most anywhere now.  I'll definitely be making again and again.

I combined the original with some of Corinne's ideas. I increased the flour to 1/3 cup, worchestershire sauce to 1 Tb and added 1/2 cup red wine that I had reduced down to about 1/4 cup. I did not saute the meat first or anything though. As the recipe is written I put the meat in the bottom raw and stirred the flour/seasonings in. I had to use the high setting, and it was done in 6 hours, truly it would have been done in 4.5 hours. Will make again!

I made this, although I only had a bit over a pound of stew meat, A1 sauce (and added extra), no bay leaves.... I also added about 3 cups more water. Cooked on high for about 7 hours and it turned out amazing: the beef was flavorful and tender and the veggies were cooked to perfection. The little bit is kick from spice it had made me enjoy the bread I had with it. 10/10, will make again!!

I made this recipe as is and honestly I don't know why it receives such good ratings. It was very bland with no depth of flavor and was quite thin. I tasted it about 3 hours into cooking on high and decided to add more Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper and it was still bland. I also added some frozen sweet corn and cornstarch to thicken. I won't make this exact recipe again. It could definitely benefit from some more herbs and spices like thyme, rosemary, onion powder, and more garlic. I would also probably add a bullion cube in addition to beef broth to help deepen the beef flavor.

This is the best and easiest no brainer for beef stew I’ve ever done. Everyone raved about this dish.  We added more potatoes and carrots than what was called for because we all like our veggies.  Be sure to watch your cooker because our stew was ready much sooner than indicated by the recipe.

I made it using Corinne's modifications  because they reminded me of how I usually cook myself, and also the browning of the beef is something I love with Ina Garten's company pot roast recipe. This was okay, not great. If I make it again I'll follow the directions exactly and see if maybe less is more.

Mouth watering beef stew.  Simple to prepare, great flavor as is.  Sure, the recipe can be changed to suit the cook's style, but I'm reviewing the recipe as it's given here, and it's a grand one.

This recipe is terrible! It has NO flavor. And the cook time is way off, everything had turned to a complete mush by hour 9 on low. I don't understand why anybody thinks this is good, I added more garlic, soy sauce, mustard,  SALT, and beef boullion HOPING to save this recipe but nothing could be done. What an absolute waste of food!

This is a great everyone loves beef stew recipe.  Good old fashioned cooking that pleases children to adults.  Not too spicy, not too bland, just right.  So to all you people who want to change it please post your own recipe.  Just rate this one and go.  Your rating has been diluted or enhanced because of your Tweeking.  Thanks

If you want bland boiled beef from a Siberian work camp, then this is the recipe for you! Seriously, don’t use standard beef broth, and certainly not 2.5 cups. Make a reduced beef broth or stock before (I know, adds time - but you can let it simmer on the stove while you do other things). Use your own stock as a base (1.5 - 2 cups Max) and get rewarded with a rich, rub hugging, dense beef stew that you were longing for when this journey began.

It was okay. I did forget the Worcestershire sauce, that may have been the reason for a lack of taste, but I imagine even with it, it would be slightly bland. Also, for a stew it had little liquid. Not sure if I did something wrong, but it turned out to be more of a roast than a stew.

Great recipe to have added sautéed mushrooms to it brought the flavour to a whole new level a dish to savour during the winter months

Super easy and super yummy!  Only thing I did was add a few dashes of thyme in with the other seasonings.

This stew was pretty good!! The only change I made was to coat the meat with the flour and salt and then I fried it on the stovetop before putting it into the crockpot. I also added alittle more worcestershire sauce. I would make it again!

This recipe is wonderful - replaces the stew recipe I've used for about 50 years! I didn't change a thing. It is peppery so if you don't like that, put less than the 1/2 tsp. the recipe calls for.

There was not a lot of flavor and my meat came out dry. the broth was not quite a gravy nor was it a broth - just kinda muddy and blah. I wouldn't make it this way again honestly and would stick to browning the meat and making in on the stove top.

I also referred to Corinne’s notes. Wine great addition. I doubled recipe. I added no salt or pepper as the McCormick’s beef stew mix had more than enough.  Added mushrooms, and will probably added turnip next time.  It’s a great starting point for a basic stew recipe and allows you to be creative based on your personal preferences (or not if you so choose).  Will omit sautéing beef and onions in advance and see if that makes a difference.

The only change I made was adding a garlic herb dry soup mix packet, hoping to boost the flavor.  It was good, but not a really rich flavor.  I think browning the meat before putting everything into the slow cooker would help.

My husband absolutely loved it. I used frozen stew veggies and in place of all the spices, I used Mrs. Dashes seasoning. Also I used 3 cups water and doubled the flour also.  Consistency was perfect as well as the flavor.
Thank you.

I have made a similar version of this beef stew for years. It is an excellent recipe. Like others, I prefer to brown my meat first (learned that from my mother). I also will then saute the veggies as well. I usually use onions, celery, carrots and mushrooms. Sometimes I will throw in a parsnip and or a turnip as well. I also deglaze the pan after sauteing . I use small red potatoes instead of dicing larger ones, that is just my preference and I don't think it matters either way.  If I have some herbs in my garden I will add them to the stew as well e.g. fresh rosemary and/or thyme. The house smells great and it is an easy meal to put together.  An easy way to thicken the stew is to add instant potatoes rather than cornstarch. It gives it a nice flavor and texture.

Such a perfect stew recipe.  Elegant and filling.  I didn't change a thing...just had to cut the recipe in half since I only had one pound of meat.  Just threw it in the crock pot and cooked for 3-4 hours.  

Good gracious, how easy and tasty can a stew be?

Just made this today and it was amazing! I only had red potatoes and did add peas at the end. I will defiantly make this every time. So much easier than browning the meat. Just throw it all in the crock pot.

Question:  How will this do if I freeze the leftovers and reheat next week? This is in the crock pot now.  Although I halved the recipe., there is still too much for the two of us.  It  filled up my  2 1/2  qt. pot.  So I am cooking it on high for 6 hours to be sure the potato's are done. ( I assume a full pot takes longer to cook?)
I made this last year in a 4 qt. slow cooker  (1/2 recipe) and thought it lacked flavor.  So this time I put in a yellow onion instead of a sweet onion, and increased the Worcester sauce.  Celery seed instead of celery also. And I am using the smaller pot for the half recipe.

This was excellent - I LOVE that you don't have to brown the beef first, and it still turns out tender and delicious. I followed recipe exactly but did add 1 cup of red wine, just because it was sitting there (I'm sure it would have been just a good if I did not add it!) Highly recommend for a quick but hearty weeknight meal!!

I attempted to make this for Rosh Hashanah. The meat was as hard as a rock as were all the vegetables and there was no gravy at all. I followed all the directions to a t. The watery broth didn't even taste good. I ended up throwing the whole thing away.

I am not a stew lover, my husband is.  This is excellent.  We both enjoyed it.  The only change I made was adding a teaspoon of garlic powder since I only had Elephant Garlic which is very mild.  It was so easy, I used a liner in the crockpot so clean up was easy as well.  Thanks so much for this excellent recipe.  Definitely will add this to my regular recipe rotation.

Delicious and easy to make. Made as written except without celery because we didn't have any.

Delicious!  Only change was I browned the beef and saluted the onions before putting it in the pot. The whole family lived it!  Unfortunately there are no leftovers!!

I made it as written but cut up a chuck roast, as I didn't have any stew meat. It turned out great. My husband loved it and when we had leftovers the next day it was even better.

I stayed pretty true to the recipe ingredients, but I did flour the meat and brown in olive oil prior to putting in the crock.  I also deglazed the pan with the beef broth and added a half cup of red wine for flavor.  The meat was so tender and it was so easy to do.  Coming home  from work to a great meal is such a blessing - thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe, especially the part where you don't have to brown the meat first.  The first time I did it, the potatoes were still a little hard for our liking.  I resolved that by boiling them for a few minutes and tossing them in.

I was never a cook of any kind and am still not one. However I tried the slow cooker recipe for beef stew 1 and was completely amazed at how good it turned out. It was delicious. My next attempt will be the slow cooker pepper steak. I hope it turns out as good.

Not  Bad! I felt it was lacking some in flavor. I  will say that, we didn't have 2  pounds of beef.  It was only 1.5 pounds. This may be why it wasn't a five star. I would make the meal again, but will be searching for something with more flavor. Looking for the 5 star meal.

Found it to be a little light on flavor and slightly sweet. Needed more of a beefy flavor for us bit maybe with a little tweaking would have more depth.

I'm new to cooking and I tried this for myself and my brother. We both loved it and had second helpings the next day. I plan on trying a few different tweaks, but will definitely be making this in colder months.

I really liked this recipe. The beef stew turned out great, however too thick for my tastes. It would make for a great pot pie filling. I will double the broth used next time.

I added 2 additional stalks of celery. Also to save a little money I purchased a beef roast and cut it into cubes  myself.

I had left over beef from the grill, so I just used that.. couple old carrots that needed eating before they could go bad, a red onion, vegetable broth, you get the idea...I just substituted the best I could and I still quite enjoyed it. I'll definitely make this again and try it the way it's supposed to actually be done. Along with other suggestions, great recipe.

Fantastic recipe. I also follow Corrine's changes but add a small bag of frozen baby peas shortly before serving. They only need to be heated thru, otherwise turn mushy.

I've been using those premade seasoning packets for years in order to 'save time'. I forgot to get one this week  so I had to resort to this homemade version. It was SO MUCH BETTER! Just the right amount of salt and spice. The packets are much saltier in comparison. And super easy! I was able to do all the prep in 15 mins. I'll never use a premade packet again. 

Notes: I was out of Worstechire sauce, so I swapped in soy sauce this time. And my family doesn't eat potatoes, but I had some mushrooms handy and added those. So yummy.

This recipe is good and very simple, but I thought it could use more thickening, even though I used 1/3 c flour, so I added some bread crumbs.  I think it would also be fine to add more herbs/spices to your liking.

Easy--makes stew meat taste like roast. But needs more salt in both our opinions.

My family loves this! Even my 4 year old! I changed a few things so my kids would eat it.  Pureeing the onion, celery and garlic (I add 3 cloves instead of 1) and I do 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.

I have made this recipe many times with and without the suggestions. The recipe as is works well but I also appreciate the addition of wine, parsley, and increased bay leaves and Worcester sauce. These are ingredients I love and they add to the flavor. One of the reasons I like this site is to see how people add to the dish to modify it to their own taste. It is helpful.

I'm very happy with how this recipe turned out! I added peas instead of the celery cause I didn't have any around. Still delicious! I cooked it for 9.5 hours on low. Tender soft beef with delicious hearty veggies. Yum!

First time I made it I followed it to the letter. It was really good. This time I added 4 cloves of garlic and 900ml of beef broth. It was so good.

Made as to the recipe..ok taste but meat just became mushy. I Was expecting chunks of meat. Bought already cubed stew meat and it was smaller than one inch cubed.  Cooked for 10 hours..maybe too long? Maybe the meatsize of cubes? Would like to try again if any suggestions.  Thanks!

This was delicious! It was the perfect meat to vegetable ratio, and the paprika gave it the perfect flavor. The difference is I browned the meat, which is a feature my pressure/slow cooker has, and still was fast and simple to prepare.

I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception: since I have a Ninja System, I used the "stovetop" setting to brown the meat first, then switched it over to the "slow cook" setting and set it on low for 10 hours. The stew was absolutely amazing, meat super tender, and full of flavor!  This is how I will cook beef stew all the time from now on!

I've tried regular stew meat, stir fry meat, and top sirloin, and the meat always is dry. Also I found that less broth made better gravy. The recipe is easy though and I would love suggestions on how to have moist meat. 

I tried the 4  hours on high and 8 hours on low same results.

Interesting to note: my very honest, four-star review I left for this recipe several months ago was recently deleted. Another honest review that I left for a different, high-rated recipe was deleted THREE TIMES in the past month. I don't know who's doing it but Allrecipes is certainly allowing it. I'll be sure to keep that in mind when declining the renewal for their magazine next month. At any rate, I made this recipe as-is and found it lacking flavor, so I suggest you try reading the other 3,000 reviews left for this recipe where people gave five stars for a concoction that barely resembles the one they're leaving a review for. Good luck.

very good recipe for an easy beef stew.  Only things I do differently: add more meat and potatoes (because why not) and the flower mixture you pour on the meat, I also add any dry spices to that (not sure it changes anything but I like it) Oh I also put a  bit more garlic in, but I really enjoy garlic.

Sprinkle some parmesan cheese, perhaps a splash of red wine - delicious! I also added green beans and peas to the finished pot.

I substituted a large tin of diced, unsalted tomatoes for the beef broth and played around with spices(cannot remember which ones)and was pleased with the result. It tasted better on Day 2. I would make it again and add more veggies like turns and peas.

I doubled everything except the meat and veggies so I could get more of the gravy. Left out the garlic and used chicken broth instead of beef broth. I actually tried beef broth the second time and preferred the chicken broth.  I also used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of regular salt and substituted bulldog tonkatsu sauce for the Worcestershire sauce. I also put all the powdered seasonings with the flour and meat in a Ziploc bag and shook it as previously mentioned.

This is a great stew that satisfied a craving I'd had for a while. I followed the recipe exactly but doubled everything except the meat (only had 3 pounds) and it turned out perfectly. If youre going to double it, put in on high for the first half (5 hours) and then low for the rest of the time (5 hours). The only thing I would change next time, out of preference, is add cabbage (used to having it when I was younger) and maybe add some more broth part way through (by the time the liquid thicknened there wasnt really anything for the bread to soak up).

I did brown meat before putting in crockpot, added red wine and packet of McCormick's Beef Stew packet.  It was a hit and will definitely make again.

This was delicious!  The only thing I did different was mess up my cooking time... I hit the warm button on my crock pot instead of the high, so this was a dinner for the next night!  But, after warming for 6 hours, then on slow cook for 10 hours, the beef (I used a roast) was melting in our mouths.  Just a little extra water and vegetables (this is a personal choice for anyone and should not affect the review based on how many carrots you like) for more gravy and that was it, great recipe and easy.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  It was really easy and came out perfect.   All of my instincts told me to brown the meat, but I decided to follow the recipe to the letter, and brown next time if I needed to. 
Wow! There really is no need.  The stew was thick and rich.  I wouldn't change anything.

***Update.   I made this again but discovered that I was out of celery half way through.   Omitting the celery produced a very bland mediocre stew.  I went out and bought  celery the following day, added it to the stew and cooked it in the slow cooker for another couple of hours.  The stew was saved!

We really enjoy this recipe for the simplicity!  Have made it twice.  Only notes I will add to my copy is to coat the stew meat in a bowl to really get it coated (otherwise the coating falls to the bottom and sides and sticks there) and maybe add some tomato paste when it all goes in or, as my husband suggested, some corn starch to thicken the broth.

I love to make this in the winter. It's actually cooking in  the crock pot as I write this! I always add extra herbs and garlic, maybe a little red wine but it's a wonderful recipe as is. It's definitely become one of my staple recipes!

I followed the directions almost exactly.  Strangely I didn't have beef broth. I subbed veggie broth with 1 bullion cube.  Still came out really great!  

I even made it at the same time as  "Beef Stew VI" because I thawed 4 lbs of meat. Both recipes were equally awesome if anyone was wondering.

Did Corinne's version. Used cube steak instead of stew meat. Only 1/2 onion. Used 1T dried parsley instead of bay leaves, added 1T oregano at end. Note to self: try cornstarch instead of flour next time.

Oh my god so delicious and the meat was so so tender.. I did add 1 onion soup mix and  doubled the amount of beef broth and I didn't use celery because I don't care for it. After 6 hours on high in the slow cooker it was a perfect stew. Thanks so much this is now my go to recipe for stew. Yummy

Excellent recipe!!!  I put the beef stew meat (mine was in larger chunks) in a bag with flour, salt and pepper and then browned it in olive oil in batches.  Once that was transferred to the cooker, I added onion + garlic (I used 2 cloves) to the same pan, and once that became fragrant I added the celery and carrots.  When that softened, I put the beef broth and the 1 t worcestershire in the pan to deglaze it before dumping in the cooker.  I also added 1/2 cup red wine, and used 2 fresh bay leaves and really good paprika.  Amazing flavor.  What I loved is that the liquid hardly needed any stovetop reduction at the end, just a little seasoning, and there was only a tiny bit of fat (I used a fat separator anyway out of habit!)  The house smelled SOOOO good all day!

Followed Corinne's suggestions. It really wasn't a lot of extra work. Did 5 hours on high and the beef was tender and delicious. Added pearl onions during last half hour of cooking. A great recipe you can tailor to suit your tastes! Super fast and easy, I will eventually try it with no adjustments - I'm sure it will come together in a matter of minutes.

I made it with pork as my mum doesn't like beef. So instead of beef stock, I used pork stock. I increased the Worcestershire sauce to 1 tablespoon as suggested by many and was quite liberal with the paprika. 

I did make the mistake of adding some strong tasting mushrooms which altered the taste. 

Will try this again leaving out the mushrooms. 

For someone who struggles with cooking, this was doable and pork worked too!

6 hours on the high setting was not enough. My beef was just cooked and very tender, but my potatoes and Brussel sprouts were still hard. It took another hour for me to save it by transferring to a pot to simmer on the stove. The combination of ingredients however, was very good, but I would recommend doing the traditional 12 hours. Following reviews I added cream of mushroom soup for a personal touch. It turned out very well but dinner was much later than originally planned

I made this dish yesterday for dinner and I was very disappointed. I followed the exact recipe and in my opinion it was flavorless. This would need to be tweaked a bit for it to have been better. The food was just ok. I will make beef stew again but I'm gonna try another recipe and see how that one turns out.

Wasn't fantastic. It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure I'll make it again. Should also get consistency in this recipe. The video says cook for 8 hours, but the written recipe says 10-12 hours.

Added red wine...upped all veggie amounts.  Used regular yellow onions.   It's quite good.   I can't imagine if we had made it "as is".  Then again, I never make anything "as is".  Quite good.  Will use even more veggies, next time.

Surprisingly I found it to be on blander side. It smelled fantastic while cooking so this was disappointing. I may make again and double the seasonings . Or might just try a different stew.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! I put the slow cooker on in the morning and put it on for 6hrs. The house smelled so good when I came home. My family loved it so much I didn't have any leftovers. I've made other stew recipes before but this is by far the best. Meat came out nice & tender. Carrots and potatoes came out perfect.

It was a delightful stew. I toyed with browning the meat first, but decided against it, and the beef was very tender. The only change was that I didn't have celery,so I substituted fresh mushrooms which i sauteed along with the onions and added some red wine to the broth mixture. Cooked it on high for 2hours ,then switched to low for 3.

This was amazing!  Just for my own reference...I used this recipe which is somewhat like the one I use (which is my Mom's).  However, this also uses celery, paprika, garlic and onions.  I replaced the beef broth with 1/2 can tomato sauce and water (to taste) so it remained similar to my Mom's.  Added a touch of Robledo Barbera red wine as well.  This was SOOO good.  Thank You....you just upped the game of my stew I've been making for years and is already well loved...now it's over the top.  I've also never made ina slow cooker and this just rocks...so easy and the delicious flavor is maintained.  Cooked about 4 1/2 hours on high.

I made and cooked this a day in advance of the night I planned on serving it and simply warmed on high in the crockpot - it was awesome! My picky boys liked it and one had two servings which is unheard of unless we're talking fast food.  My husband loved it as well. It's a winner and I will definitely make it again.

great base recipe! i omitted celery and added celery seed. needed to add more salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders after it had been cooking a few hours. also subbed a 1/2 cup of stock with 1/2 can of dark beer. could also use red wine. needed some additional thickening with an arrowroot slurry, but overall, good stuff!

Great recipe for beef stew! I will agree with some reviewers that the vegetables did not retain a lot of their taste after 10 hours of cooking (I wouldn't recommend any longer!) but the meat was tender, the broth flavorful, and overall a great, warm meal for the cold winter months!

Simple dinner for busy days. We liked this meal but found it a little bland. Will definitely make again but throw some additional seasoning to it.

This was a great base recipe. The only thing I added this time was about 1/2 cup of red wine in place of some of the beef broth. We found that the flavour was good but could have been more full, so next time I will put more seasoning on the meat or in the broth. But definitely an easy, quick, throw in the pot dinner.

I made this exactly as shown and it came out perfect and my family loved it!  So much easier than browning the meat first.  No need to!  :-)

I made it exactly as written and it turned out perfectly!  Will definitely make it again - and often.  The only thing I recommend is putting the flour mixture in a Ziploc bag and then add the stew meat - shake vigorously until pieces are coated.

I followed someone's advice and seared the beef after shaking it in the flour mixture and added a half cup of red wine and extra garlic.  It only took 5 hours on high and I thickened the gravy with cornstarch/water.  It was a winner.

Super easy but it's currently cooking so I'll let you know how it tastes later (wish this site allowed us to write down notes first)...
I combined this recipe and another recipe because this recipe is for a crockpot while the other isn't... so we'll see how it turns out.
I used Beef round tip roast and cut it into cubes (cheaper by almost half instead of buying the "beef stew cubes" and looks the same.)
I used 2 cans of beef broth (didn't measure out 1.5cups)
1tsp. parsley
1tsp. rosemary
and the rest was the recipe.

If I had time, i'd sauté them before putting them into the crockpot... seals in the favor.

Mine wound up cooking closer to the 12 hour mark and that was a bit too long.  The meat totally fell apart.  It still tasted very good!

While very tender, this recipe "as is" is very bland. After serving, we needed to add a lot of salt of pepper to give it some flavor. I may try it again using the amount of meat, potatoes, carrots and timing as a baseline, but this needs a bit of work to make it flavorful. Maybe some red wine and thyme.  Certainly more Worcestershire, as I was surprised it only used a teaspoon. Something, anyway. Mustard?

I will use this cooking method again (I loved not having to brown the meat first) but not these ingredients.  I thought the celery was weird, but I'm never a fan of beef and celery together.  Too many potatoes, not enough other vegetables.  And not enough color!  Needed more carrots, peas or green beans, and maybe some corn.  Doubling Worcestershire as some others proposed would be overpowering, in my opinion.

My family loved it so much I ended up making a second batch. The first time I cooked it for approximately 5 hours on high and the second time about 7 to 8 hours on low. Very easy recipe.

I've made this several times and the whole family loves it! I made it twice exactly as written and it was great. The only change I make now is I add a healthy splash of red wine (I'm Italian, it's in my DNA) and a bay leaf. Even better the next day, I always double, so I have easy lunches for a few days.

I did not find this very savory.  I prefer a more seasoned stew so I will probably not make this again.  Even with all the flour in it, the broth was not as thick as I would like.

I would say, this is a good recipe... My rating is based on my growing up on a farm and having roast beef a lot! So its not my favorite thing, but it was good for beef stew.  I'm also rating it on behalf of my husband, who is Asian, so for him it is kind of bland. I think for both of us, maybe we want a bit more flavor and kick.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY as directed. The stew was okay. Just okay. It was underflavored in my opinion. I could have tweaked the recipe but I wanted to give the original a fair shot. I agree with top reviews, this stew needs more flavor. I took a pic of my finished stew. I hope it uploads.

I coated the beef first, by shaking it in a ziploc bag with the flour mixture, and then browned before putting in slow cooker.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It was well received and we had no leftovers, much to my disappointment!

Great base for beef stew. I added a tlb of balsamic vinegar, 1/2 a bottle of angry orchard honey beer, extra garlic, okra, a large jalapeno, and more Worcestershire sauce. Turned out great.

Didn't make any tweaks to the recipe. It was good, but a little bland for my taste. Wasn't the "stew" I was going for; might have been a bit too much meat.

Fabulous Winter meal. Very rich in flavor and the stew meat I used came out so  tender it actually melted, yes melted, in your mouth. I will be making this at least twice a month during the winter time. I feel nothing has to be changed about this.  Perfect seasoning and there are only two of us so this lasted us for two days..... about 6 nice size bowls I got out of it.  KUDOS!!!!

This was wonderful. I only made some additions, added mushrooms, red wine and I browned the meat before I added to the crock pot. Smelled and tasted amazing.

OK so honestly, this stew needs to be doctored up. I followed the exact directions and got a very bland stew. I agree with not browning the meat, this is the first time I didn't brown the meat and the stew meat turned out much tender than usual. However, once completely done I found that the flavor was very bland! I would definitely add more seasoning.

Love this stew, one of the things that I love about it is that it tastes like regular old beef stew. That's what I was going for.  I did leave out the Worcestershire sauce because I was out, but it was really yummy and I will absolutely make it again.

I liked the look of this recipe so a made this yesterday. I followed the recipe as written, but I was disappointed in the outcome... Not a favorable as I hoped. The jury is still out how this will taste as a leftover.  Will try recipe again with some adjustments to add flavor

Great exactly as is. Next time I will try Corinne's suggestions to see the difference.
Corinne's suggestions:
1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning.

Did not use the bay leaf because I didn't have any. I do recommend browning the meat first, I didn't this time but I will next time I make it. The meat was a bit dry.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Then I tasted it.  It seemed to lack depth of flavor to me, but was a good base.  I added half a jar of my favorite pasta sauce, stirred and waited half an hour.  It was so yummy.

Kids suggested I add more meat and cut back on the potatoes, and I added an extra 1/2 stalk of celery, but other than those small changes,  I made it as originally published and it was really great.  My fussy 16 year old girl gobbled it up!

Delicious! I've made several times and always get rave reviews from those eating it. I do toss the beef with the flour, salt, pepper and garlic and sear it before putting in the crockpot, only because that's how my mom would do it - but otherwise follow the recipe to a T and it's great!

Great recipe. I didn't have potatoes so I substituted in 1/2 cup of barley. I also added some oregano and sage. I recommend adding a little more broth since the barley soaks a lot of it up. 

Get some good quality stewing beef!

I made this exactly according to the directions, and my husband loved it! I used 2 pounds of chuck roast instead of the stew meat, and it turned out very savory and moist. I did have to add an extra carrot and potato to get the right balance, as well as about 1/2 tsp garlic salt near the end. Cooked on low for 10 hours. Very good comfort food!

I didn't know that I needed beef broth until after I started the stew so I used water. It didn't have the flavor from the broth but it still taste great. I plan to make it again and make sure I have all the ingredients before I start this time ??

This is such an easy recipe. I go a little heavy on the garlic and pepper but otherwise followed  the recipe. I've made it three times already and am very happy with it. I'm a mushroom freak so I threw in a couple of varieties of mushrooms on one batch. My daughter doesn't care for mushrooms so this is perfect as-is for her.

No changes to the original recipe.  It was ok but I don't think I would make it again.  I can see how people would like it if you want to put it in the crock and eat it later.  I thought the flavor was just fine but not outstanding.  Seems to me  that there is something missing, I just don't know what.

It was by far the best beef stew I've made.  I added 1/2 rutabaga because of my love of them.  Easy to made and a reward to eat.

I always had a difficult time making beef stew because I just couldn't get the liquid thick enough.  I would keep adding flour and then you know what happens when you do that.  :)

This recipe took care of my problem and was easy to make and quite flavorful and tasty.

We had some crusty Italian bread with it.  I actually put my bread on the bottom of the bowl and poured the stew over the bread.  YUM!!

The recipe is perfect the way it is.

Thanks.

According to my husband, this recipe is "make again" good -and I agree. However I only gave the recipe 4 stars because I made a few changes. I used one pound of beef instead of two, I (accidentally) added two cups of beef broth instead of the one and a half, and I added a beef bullion cube towards the end because the broth tasted bland otherwise. All that aside, we will definitely make this again!

I don't understand why people review a recipe with a lot of changes to it. If you don't like the recipe as is, post your own. We like the recipe - maybe we will add or subtract some things the next time we make it. All in all, we were greatly satisfied - serve with some homemade bread (my 10 year old son eats as much as my 50 year old husband).

I first placed the beef into a ziploc bag containing 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon of Montreal Steak Spice, tossed it to coat; then seared the beef in a pan. While it was cooking I added 8 ounces of chopped Shitake mushrooms and let them soak up the beef flavour before placing it all into my crockpot. Added 1 1/2 cups beef broth, 1/4 cup Marsala wine, 3 cloves garlic, 2 whole bay leaves (remove at end), 2 tablespoons paprika, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, chopped/diced 3 onions, 3 potatoes, 7 sweet carrots, 2 stalks celery. 5 hours on high, 2 hours on low. Beef was melt in your mouth delicious.

This was a definite favorite with my wife and I.  I used a nice pinot noir for the wine and the aroma filled the house almost immediately.  Because of time, I had to cook it on high, but it was still great.

My teenage daughter said this was the best beef stew by far that I've made.  I added frozen peas after about 4 hours.  I matched it up with some biscuits on the side and Yorkshire pudding http://allrecipes.com/recipe/22539/quick-and-easy-yorkshire-pudding/

I made it as recipe states.  It looked watery so I added 1/2 of a small can of tomato paste and a envelope of dry onion soup mix.  It was great!  I'm not sure if it would of thickened on it's own or not.  My husband loved it!

I'm not a huge beef stew guy. However this was great. My only changes were made due to having a smaller crock pot. I only used two potatoes. And I also used 2 stalks of celery. I will make it again. I'm an Rv commuter. This lasted me all week and the leftovers were great as well.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was add a splash of good red wine only because I love the depth it gives to beef dishes.  I am also one that normally browns the meat before putting it on the slow cooker, but so many reviewers said you didn't need to, and they were right!  This recipe will no doubt be made several times over the next  cold winter months!

The only things I changed were I added 1/3 cup of flour,  2 bay leaves, and about 1/4 cup of grape juice fore tenderness.  Very good, simple recipe.

I used this recipe as a guide and doubled it. I also tweaked it and braised my meat with onions in a fry pan before adding to the crock pot and used Better Than Bouillon for my beef broth and added a cap of Kitchen Bouquet to my base.  When it was finished I added frozen peas. OMG it was delicious!!!

Just regular beef stew. The second time I made it, I scratched the bay leaf and added a handful of brown sugar on top.

Just made it tonight.  I would give it an OK rating.   After 11 1/2 hours, the meat and vegetables were tender, but the potatoes were not fully cooked.  Also, the stew was very bland.  We had to add a lot more salt and pepper while eating.  Even after adding more salt and pepper, something was still missing. However,  it passes and still meets the general requirements for beef stew.

It was very good.  I had modified it based on some other comments - 1/3 cup flour instead of 1/4, lightly searing meat before adding to pan, 2 garlic instead of 1, 1 tbsp of Worcestershire instead of 1 tsp - so the review isn't true of the exact recipe.  Besides the changes I already made, the only thing I'd like to change for next time is that there wasn't quite enough liquid at the bottom - I may try adding a little more broth next time.  But overall, very tasty!

Definitely will make again. May add hominy just because my mom always has it in hers. No worchestershire  sauce due to allergy but will entertain alternate recommendations. Good for my 1st slow cooker beef stew. :)

Excellent stew.  This was just what I was looking for.  The only change I made, was that I doubled the amount of Worchester sauce.  Next time, I think that I will add frozen peas in the last hour of cooking.

Loved this!  Just what we want a classic beef stew to be.  I, also, was hesitant about not browning the meat.   But I decided to follow the recipe this first time and pass on that extra step.  I noticed no difference!  The only little things I added (I know, I know . . . not supposed to rate a recipe if you make changes, but I'm going to anyhow!) were a couple things I used to always add in to my stovetop recipes. . . some red wine, and a little tomato paste (maybe 1/3 c.) to thicken it just a little more.   Delicious!

Delicious!  Exactly what I am looking for in a stew.
Historically, I would shake the beef in the flour mixture, and sear it in frying pan, prior to putting in the crockpot.  As I read through reviews, I saw people saying to do this, but I also said reviews saying not to, as its not needed.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great.  
I assume its the pepper, but it was pretty spicy.  My husband and I loved that, but I would def adjust that if I plan to serve to kids again.  Too much for them.  My dad likes pepper too, but he suggested putting less in future, and let people add as they desire.

Delicious! Added a can of beef broth to cover in crock pot completely. A little too salty and peppery for me so next time I'll use half the salt and pepper. I love the Italian type seasonings so I also added a tsp of rosemary, tsp basil, tsp Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp parsley. We loved it! The broth tastes amazing and would make a great gravy for another dish as well if preserved.

I added herbs de Provence and Bragg's liquid aminos (similar to soy sauce), but it was still bland. Also, the potatoes did not get soft enough, even with the maximum cooking time. I refrigerated most of this dish overnight. It tasted much better the second day because the potatoes had softened in the gravy. If I cooked it again, I'd microwave the potatoes first; I find that vegetables often fail to cook thoroughly in slow-cooker stew recipes even if layered under the faster-cooking meat.

I loved how easy this recipe was.  The beef, which I didn't brown first, turned out so tender!  I personally like the potatoes really soft, which wasn't the case, but I didn't have more time to cook it - everyone was hungry.  I'll cut them smaller next time.   I added 1/2 c of red wine and some thyme and rosemary.  I also doubled the "broth" - I use water, salt and pepper.  I also added a tomato and then some mushrooms about an hour before eating.  We eat this some Italian bread.  Great recipe for the slow cooker!

I liked it and was given compliments on it, but I didn't like how the flour texture seemed to remain on the meat. I tried this recipe to see if it came out about the same as when I brown the meat before putting it in the crock pot. I think I prefer browning the meat before putting it in the crock pot. But, I do want to clarify that this recipe still turned out good!

Don't get nervous about the broth looking too thin; once it's done cooking some of the beef will fall apart and the broth will thicken. Serve with some egg noodles or just enjoy it on a cold day with a little butter bread. I'll definitely make this again

Delish...although as I remember as a child we never had celery in the stew.  Next time I make it I will most likely leave the celery out.  Very tasty and easy recipe.  Will definitely make again and again.

Switched out the flour with gluten free all purpose flour. Then replaced the garlic and onions with shallots (greens only) to make it gluten free and FODMAP friendly. Delicious!

Love this recipe. This is my third time. I always use all the recommendations from Corrine's post. This time I put the stew seasoning (only half package) and directly in with the meat and flour in the plastic bag. Also, I still wanted more depth so I added 1tsp rosemary and thyme, each. I added

I rate it a 4. It was hearty and colorful with carrots, however I did not love the flavor. I'm not sure if it was paprika or  something else. I would try it again but leave out paprika.

Wonderful recipe. I surprised my wife having it for dinner...TWO evenings! and 2 lunches. I recommend adding considerably more beef broth than the recipe calls for.

I used deer meat (venison hind quarrter) for my stew.  It was outstanding.  I had cooked the venison on my Green Egg and saved the majority of it for the stew.  I cut it into small cube and followed the recipe; just added a little more garlic and cummin.

Increased flour to 1/3 C; decreased pepper to 1/4 teaspoon, used season salt instead of regular salt, added 1 package of McCormick Beef Stew seasoning.  I mixed the flour, seasoned salt, paprika, and pepper together, dredged the chunks of meat in flour mixture, heated up 1 Tablespoon of oil in a pan and browned the meat with the chunks of onions.  Mixed a can of beef broth with McCormick mix along with other seasoning ingredients.  Added meat to crockpot, poured in liquid mixture and added veggies in order of the recipe.  SO GOOD!

This is definitely a keeper! I forwarded my "work at home husband" the recipe and told him to just follow the directions.  The only ingredient we did not have was the paprika, so instead he used Montreal steak seasoning and lemon pepper seasoning. It turned out great! Our two daughters who are picky eaters had no complaints!

I did not make any changes. It took a little while to chop the vegetables, but then it was just put them in the crock pot, turn it on, and wait. We thought it was delicious!

This is a great recipe for all day in the crockpot!  It wasn't overdone even after 10 hrs. in the crockpot.  It had plenty of flavor and I will probably use only half of the paprika and pepper next time.  I used 2 more potatoes and a few more carrots as we really like them and I was glad I did.

I make this frequently. Halve the taters and add turnips and parsnips. Instead of beef broth, a large bottle of Guinness Stout. Of course, I have to take a couple of swallows first, just for quality control. Sometimes cabbage wedges are added for the last hour.

Very good and easy to assemble as written.  Any stew can have veggie variations per taste and what is on hand.
And all slow cooker recipe users can choose to brown the meat first or not based on experimentation.
While I do agree with Canucky and Lindsey B about rating the recipe as given or post your own version as a separate recipe - think of all the individual recipes you would have to look at instead of just reading a few reviews for some ideas that might appeal for modifications.  I personally like reading a few reviews that describe alterations and really don't pay attention to the rating as much.

This is how I first made my beef stew. I have changed it here and there to suit my taste or for what I have available. I've read many reviews that have changed it so much that it's not the same recipe. That may be annoying to some, maybe even the author of the original recipe. But I for one love to try different ways of making recipes. So I like reading the reviews with the changes in case I see something to add that makes it taste better or go farther or cost less. No one is changing it on the original page. Just for their own particular liking. I always welcome remarks that will make my meals good.
By the way I've always loved this recipe it is quick, easy and very tasty.

i was missing some ingredients so I had to make some adjustments but it still turned out delicious! I only had 1 lb of beef so i doubled the carrots, threw in half a bag of frozen peas, and added a couple extra potatoes. I didn't have any beef stock so I doubled the amount of water and used 1.5 beef bouillon cubes instead. I didn't have any celery so I sprinkled in some celery seed,  and  threw in some basil and a thing of rosemary. tasted great, will make again!

I made this with about a pound of leftover roast. Used 2 cups water & a knorebeef bullion cube. Threw in about a cup of peas. Delicious, the seasonings are spot on.For those who think there's too much meat, just don't add so much. I followed the exact measurements for the seasoning and it was GREAT. Would use the 2lbs only if I doubled everything else. Everybody has different preference on meat/veggies and a recipe is just a guideline.

I made this following the recipe as written.  It was a very easy stew to make. I made it for company and they raved about how delicious it was and asked for the recipe. It was a thick stew but that is what I and apparently my company like.  I will definitely make this again!

Use chuck roast for the meat, use an all purpose gluten free flour to make it gluten free, you won't know the difference.

Great stew!  I used 1.75 pounds of sirloin steak, red new potatoes, multi colored carrots , celery and 3 onions.  I coated the cubed steak in Gluten free flour with salt and pepper, browned in vegetable oil and I added 4 cups of beef broth 
(from bouillon) to the crock pot.  I also sauteed the onion in the skillet before adding to the crock pot.  My family loved it!

I made this according to the directions but added a pack of McCormick brown Gravy mix.  This may have messed it up because the flavor was lacking.  It needed an extra boost of something.  But overall a pretty good recipe.

Love this recipe! easy and delicious. The one thing my husband and I don't like are the extra fat juices that come from cooking the meat so we're going to experiment to try to find a way to make the recipes a little less greasy.

Have made this twice now and it's a big hit in our family. The gravy is super yummy and it's really easy to make exactly as is.  The only thing I change is the root veggies - depends on what's in the fridge. Add the root veggies you like to make it your own.

I made this for the first time .. Yesterday  .. And it filled my home with an amazing  delicious aroma!!  .. I followed the recipe to the T.. And it truly is delicious !! Even my kids loved it and they dislike any kind of vegetable ! I didn't even have to hide the fact that there were  vegetables ! Lol. They ate it up !! I served it in big soup cups .. With a nice garlic butter crusty bread .. And let me tell u .. Everyone went back for seconds .. And my husband even had a third cup in the middle of the night ! Lol. He woke up and literally ate more ! Great and simple recipe that my whole family loved ! I will definitely be making this again and again. If people choose to make changes .. Great. But this recipe for my family and I tastes .. Is simply perfect ! No changes necessary for us ! Thanks for the good eats!!

This was so delicious! I made it exactly as written, including not browning the beef. I really don't think you need to brown the beef as it is going to be cooking for a long time which will be getting it tender anyway. Also you're saving yourselves some calories from oil if you don't pre-brown the meat. One thing that I will say is that I did end up adding a little extra flour and water for thickening. At the time that I was going to serve it, I opened the lid and it looked a little too liquidy to me, so I mixed about a tbsp of flour with some water and threw it in there and came back in 10 mins. It did the trick. I cooked mine on high for about 4.5 hours and it was perfect. I wouldn't recommend cooking it any longer as the meat will get too tender and start breaking apart. Also, I used bottom round roast and it worked great.

I love this recipe! It is so easy and tastes so good!! I added more broth and I didn't have fresh carrots or celery but had rutabaga!  Added great flavor...then added frozen mixed veggies last few hours to get more colour and variety.

4 to 6 hrs. is too long to cook the stew on high. More like 2 to 4 hours on high. At 3 1/2 hrs. , my vegetables were pretty mushy. My advice is to check it within two and a half hours.

I made this recipe using stew cubes I bought from my Butcher. Unfortunately it had no flavor ,I tried to improve the flavor by adding onion dry soup mix , little improvement ,I am going to try beef bouillon and gravy master.  I just did not get that beefy flavoring I wanted . I followed the recipe except for the bay leaf .
Soooo  disappointed

This is very good beef stew. I used 1Tbl of worchestershire and added some wine (lower quality cuts of mean need either some tomato paste or red wine to break down the fibers in the meat). It was very good and it is easy.

Great for my very first slow cooker recipe!  I really appreciated the simplicity of it.  The original is great and so are the different versions!  I loved that there were so many people with their personal twists and comments.  I started with Corinne's suggestions which gave me the courage to try and be creative on my own.  I like using pomegranate juice instead of wine...I'm also lazy so I love the Trader Joe's pre-cut onions, garlic cloves and paste (I always toss in extra cloves into the mix), baby carrots, mini potatoes (wash and toss in cooker), pre-cut stew meat.  (Homer Simpson: "so lazy....") Also, I think the Trader Joe's beer bread goes great with this. I don't work for Trader Joe's but they were sampling these and they are so easy to make--just add beer (or soda water) and butter on top and bake.  Super fast if you make them in small muffin tins (10-15 minutes!)  YUMMY!!!! ok i think i am going to have to have this for dinner tonight.

This was kind of bland, and there was too much meat. It did cook beautifully in my slow cooker though, so I'll make it again but cut the meat to 1.5 lbs and add more seasonings.

Update:
I've made this three times now and have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars with the following minor changes: Reduce beef to 1.5 lbs, and double the garlic, bay leaf, paprika, and Worcestershire. Optionally, add a teaspoon or two of your favorite herbs and/or spices. The flavor is SO much better, as is the ratio of meat to veggies.

I also increased the flour to 1/3 cup and substituted season salt for regular salt. I coated the meat in the flour mixture and browned the meat in oil. I also cooked the onions in the pan and then deglazed it with the beef broth, worcestershire sauce and 1/2 cup red wine. I also doubled the garlic and 2 bay leaves and 1 packet McCormick's beef stew seasoning packet.

When I make a new recipe, I usually do not change it, if I do it is just to add some herbs. When I made this recipe, I made it as is, and it was great!!!!! Will stick to this recipe going forward. I just cannot understand people who decide to try a recipe and basically make it completey diffferent.  They are probably missing some good recipes.

I set up my account just to leave this review. I made this stew, but I want to warn you that it is extremely bland if you do not season it properly!

First, make sure that you DO NOT use low sodium beef broth, I found it bland even with the regular full sodium beef broth

Second, increase the spices. You need more flavour in this dish, trust me! I strongly recommend increasing the Worcestershire sauce, at least double it. Add a couple extra bay leaves. Triple the black pepper and salt. I don't really notice the paprika but it seemed to be enough. Honestly I suck at spices so look them up or combine from different recipes, all I know is that the flavour is lacking.

Third, salt salt salt. I believe the most lacking thing in this dish was the salt content. I did add more ingredients than recommended (extra celery, extra meat) but not much more. If you prefer low-sodium then don't add more, but if not the dish would go from OK to AMAZING with just some extra salt and spices.

My kids have some new food allergies they don't like bay so I left that out didn't have that worchestire to put in it, but other than that looks like the picture only sad thing is it won't be ready till tomorrow the fun of slow cooking but fast eating when it is done.I did coat the meat with flour then browned it in skillet w/o oil is non-stick then transferred going to try to make a thin gravy to mix in with the stew since I didn't  have any beef bouillon. Did you know beef bouillon actually has dairy in it  is an unknown surprise allergen. So no oil included in this at all.

the only change i made was that i added  1 chopped  parsnip and after it had cooked on low for about 12 hours i added peas and cooked for another hr. on hi.To thicken the gravy i used some cornstarch.Very hearty and the parsnip gave it just a bit of an edge.I would make it again for sure.

I liked it, as did my neighbor. Next time I'll add green beans and a few more carrots. It's mostly meat and tatoes. Which is great, but I enjoy more veggies. More garlic too... And I tripled what the recipe called for.

I'll definitely be making this again! I added a little more flour for thickness and I put on low for 10 hours! It was so delicious! My husband had 2 full bowls! I also made croissants for us to dip in the broth!!

I added a little more garlic & carrots. I also placed the flour & seasoning along with the meat in a bag it coated the meat better than just sprinkling over.  I think I over cooked it in high next time will check the after 3/1/2 hours.

This was my first time trying out the recipe. An hour into cooking I felt that it was quite bland do I added salt and garlic powder and continued to cook.. 3 hours in I still felt a bit bland so I added a boullion cube, Italian seasoning and rosemary. The end flavor was amazing. I wish I would have used a less fatty piece of beef but will definitely try this again

Perfect!!  Didn't make any additions and my hard- to-please family rated it "awesome" and "delicious."  I only had one pound of stew meat  and didn't have any celery, next time I'll be sure to have what I need!  This recipe is a keeper!

I had just over 2 lbs of stew meat....made it as written, did not brown the meat.  I served it to 5 adults and a small child.  Everyone loved it. It was delicious. I served it with bulger, hot dinner rolls and a salad.  I have enough left for a meal for 2 or 3.  Will definitely make this again!

We made it in the crock put and left it on low for 10 hours while we were at work.  I added an extra half cup of water, and it was still a little dry.  I think 7 or 8 hours would have been better.  The flavor was still really good.  We will probably make this again, it was easy!

Ugh. I made the recipe exactly as written, and it turned out horribly.  The potatoes overwhelmed all the other ingredients, and it was incredibly bland.  Next time I'll look at the reader recommendations.

Very good recipe with easy steps.  The hardest part is cutting up the vegetables.  My husband who rarely comments on my dishes, said "you need to make this all the time".  
For myself, I would like a bit more salt or spices? But honestly, it was good just as the recipe is written.

I upped the portions on the broth and added a bit more flour because I prefer my stew a bit thicker. All in all I loved this recipe.

We like a stew with more gravy, so I used about 3 cups of low sodium beef broth, so I doubled up on the spices with the exception of paprika (I ran out).  I also left out the garlic for personal preference.  Like most, I doubled up on the carrots and potatoes, but wish I hadn't as we like a meatier stew.  I cooked for 1 hr on high, then 8 on low and my meat was more shredded consistency than stew cubes (my fault for cutting to small of cubes).   I should have added more flour to the meat (since I increased the beef stock), so at the end I removed a good portion of the liquid from the slow cooker and thickened in up with corn starch on the stovetop.    This way we had a ton of thick gravy.  Next time I will cut back on the potatoes and carrots, but add peas and mushrooms (and maybe green beans too).  Spice wise though, this is a very nice, traditional stew that is a great base recipe and easy to customize to your family's preferences.  We will definitely have at a family meal this fall.

This is a really good recipe in my opinion. It's a good base so you can adjust or add things if you want. The only thing I adjusted was that I used 1.7 lbs of meat and probably had too much potatoes. It was tasty though. I recommend it.

Added 1 15 oz can stewed tomatoes and 1 8 oz can tomato sauce.  About an hour before the end of the cooking cycle, added a cornstarch mixed with water to thicken.  Winner!

Really good recipe!! My 22 year old son gave it an 8/10 because he likes his foods spicy. My husband liked it. I made the recipe as written, which I always do the first time I make a new recipe. If I make it again, I would perhaps tweek it then; being an onion lover, may add more onions.  The meat was tender, the broth made a nice (thin) gravy. Lots of heartiness with the potatoes, carrots and onions. The house smelled really good, too!!  Would make this again.

Decided to make recipe as is. One reviewer said it is awesome the way it is written. I find adding the browning of meat as one reviewer suggested,  takes away from the simplicity of crock pot cooking.

The stew was indeed very bland, You may want to consider adding additional seasonings. It took a long time for the meat to get tender, so I did chops my spuds larger. That is good idea, they didn't turn to mush.

Simple and lovely stew which is a staple in our house. I add a splash of red wine because of reasons.

So this was ok. Smelled good and tasted fine, but the veggies got too mushy in the crock pot. Maybe wait til later in the cooking to add the potatoes and carrots .

Love the simplicity and the flavor.  I did make two minor tweaks, due to my celiac disease.  I did not use flour, and yes while the consistency end up a bit watery, I added extra potatoes and mashed them up a bit to thicken the stew a little.  Anyways, delish, will be making again!!

Works well in a smaller 2 person pot with the meat, potatoes and carrots halved. Cooked it on High for the six hours recommended and it turned out very tasty.

We enjoy this one when it is a lazy day about the house and need something simple and quick to prepare.

2nd time I am making this recipe, comes out as good-ol'-beef stew. No weird obscure ingredients, no fancy flavors, just simply good wholesome cooking. Super easy, breaks into about 5 lunches, transportable in thermos. Perfect.

Just made it, definite 5 star. Kept the basic concept of the beef and spices. I like vegetables. Reduced the carrots to two, celery to two, 8 oz. button mushrooms, mini potatoes halved and diced tomatoes (drained). Started late, 3 hours on high and 5 hours on low. We don't make stews, but this was as good as all ratings, a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was not that great.  There wasn't enough flavor and I expected the broth to be gravy-like but it wasn't.  I may try again using other reviewers suggestions.

This was a great base recipe for easy beef stew!! I've got a 6 month old and a 2 year old, so any recipe I can throw together in a few minutes is a win!
 It's currently in the slow cooker with about an hour left til it's done. I tried a few bites already, though, and it was pretty yummy! But I personally think it needs more flavor. I added 4 beef boullion cubes, thyme, parsley, and Adobo seasoning to hopefully kick the flavor up a notch. I'm so excited to try the finished product, and I'll definitely be making it again!

If you want credit for a recipe, list one! But don't tell me the changes you made to someone else's recipe. Because, then it is a different recipe. Rate the recipe as written, to show respect for the person who submitted it. I actually like that BUCHKO made it as easy as possible as a crock pot recipe should be. If you want to dirty up pots and pans browning first etc, as others have suggested, then you might as well cook it on the stove. And, of course one can add extra ingredients as a matter of taste - doesn't everyone?  For a slow cooker recipe, this is aces for convenience and taste! I thank you, BUCHKO.

This was a nice simple recipe. Totally forgot the tomato juice but it turned out good anyway. Substituted some stock for 1/4 cup red wine and added some red pepper for color and to vary the taste. Cooked for 4.5 hrs on high in slow cooker and it was just right. It is a good idea to cut the potatoes bite-size so they cook faster.

This is an easy and very basic stew recipe. I skipped the celery (since my husband hates it), and just upped the onion by about half. I brown the beef in a skillet, poured that on top of the potatoes and carrots, reduced a little red wine in the skillet (to get all the nummy beef bits and flavor), and poured that into the crock pot with the beef broth. 

If you like a thicker stew, I recommend scooping some of the hot broth into a measuring cup, adding a little bit or cornstarch or flour, whisking until blended, and pouring back into the slow cooker.

I also do a "stroganoff" variation by thickening the broth, and stirring in some sour cream just before serving!

This is a great recipe as is!   I didn't make changes to the recipe except to double it!  We like lots of veggies. I liked not having to brown the beef, less dishes to wash.   Putting the meat in a ziplock bag would be a little easier to coat.   The only change I made was making beef broth with bullion cubes that I got from this site because I didn't have any on hand.   My family loved it. Thank you for a great, easy recipe??

Excellent base recipe. I have a stovetop stew I love but it's so much work and babysitting, so what I did was port over differences in the seasonings ( 1/2 tsp each of ground thyme and rosemary) and I cooked a rue on the stovetop instead of just throwing raw flour in. So delicious and easy.

I admit that is easy this way and I had plenty of everything because I just put in whatever I want and as much as I want. However, Normally I brown the beef to keep the meat tasting good. This time without browning the meat was bland. I also use Chicken stock because beef stock is not to my liking. Also I would add more flour or cornstarch etc to make the gravy thicker. I do not like watery gravy. But I will do this again with my own tweaking!

Turns out great! I've made this one a few times. Pairs really well with homemade biscuits. I usually only use 2/3 of an onion cause I don't like onion all that much.

Loved it and it was so easy!  None of that searing the meat beforehand, etc, etc.  I will make this again for sure.  The great thing about stew is that it's so versatile.  I followed the recipe as closely as I could but had to make the following changes: I used gluten-free flour instead of wheat flour.  I reduced the amount of sodium by using low sodium beef broth and 1/4 tsp of sea salt instead of 1/2 tsp regular salt.  I didn't have carrots or celery, so I used parsnips (?) and fennel (??) instead (I don't know why I had the more obscure ingredients).  Since I wasn't using an orange coloured veggie (as in the carrots), I swapped out one of the potatoes for a sweet potato.  It was excellent.  So, feel free to mix and match the veggies to change things up or suit whatever you have on hand!

The meat fell apart in my slow cooker, making this recipe that much better, as if that were possible. It is quick (once the veggies are cut up) and easy and the crock pot does all the work. Such a comfort food!

Hearty but lacks flavor. After 10 hours in the slow cooker I decided to add some spice to give it some flavor. I put in more paprika and added chili and cayenne pepper. It helped. This is a good base recipe, but definitely needs some improvisation on your part to make it better.

I used low sodium beef broth, added 3 crushed cloves garlic, didn’t add celery or salt. I will probably use half the recommended paprika next time, it wasn’t too spicy but it didn’t make it feel like beef stew.  I did add a little more potatoes and carrots since I didn’t add celery.  I tried to remove as much fat from the beef and cooked on high for 4.5 hours, this was enough time for potatoes and beef to be tender.  I’ll definitely keep making this recipe over and over.

After following this recipe countless times, I thought I should finally give it a well-deserved 5-star review! So easy to prepare in the morning and so delicious to eat in the evening. Sometimes in the last hour, I'll throw in some frozen peas or a can of corn for some extra veggies.

Great recipe to make....I prepared everything the night before and in the morning started my slow cooker...It was very easy to prepare...

The only changes I made were I used prepared garlic in a jar and I added some fresh mushrooms..

It was very delicious and will definitely prepare again...

Basic recipe...tastes good. But, I would coat the meat and brown first before adding to slow cooker. All the original way did was the flour washed off when putting the liquid in.

Oh ~~SO~~ good.  I made it "AS-IS" and the stew is the best I have ever made and the best I have ever eaten!  

I doubled the recipe.  I mixed the dry ingredients together and then dropped the beef chunks into that seasoned mix.  Then, I browned the meat.  While it was browning, I dissolved 2 cubes of Beef Bullion (Knoll's) in  2 cups of hot water.  

Then, I added the dry ingredients to the beef bullion liquid and blended them thoroughly (I used a large quart container, and shook the daylights out of it).  

I used bay leaves from our own tree.  

WOW!!  I cannot wait to make this again, and again, and again!

We went for the basic recipe listed here and everyone was really pleased with this very tasteful stew. Due to no option of delayed start on our crock pot we went for 6 hrs on High.

I thought it was pretty good. I would add a bit more salt to it and also, I wish the gravy was a tad bit thicker. Anybody has any suggestions on how to thicken the juices?

LOVE and so did my family. Easy and very flavourful. The beef turns out very moist and all vegetables are cooked.  The amount of stock with no call for water didn't add enough moisture. I doubled the beef stock and with slow cooker on high (following recipe) it was done well before the time this calls for.

I found it a bit bland as well.  I unfortunately over cooked mine. High for 6 hours was way too much. Maybe low for that long would have been ok.

I followed the recipe without any changes or additions and it was delicious.  I contemplated adding more Worcestershire sauce, but ended up using the specified amount, then put the bottle on the table in case anyone that wanted to kick it up a notch - just 1 (out of 3) of us added more.

Love, Love this!  I didn't have celery or Worcestershire sauce.... but it came out great.  Made it last week, and now just made it again, with the above ingredients!  (I did add just a tad of McCormick's slow cooker vegetable beef seasoning mix the first time and today).  My mother in law loved it too!!

I added 2 tsp of beef bolllion, 1 1/2 brown gravy packs, and 32 Oz of beef stock instead of 1 1/2 cups.  Next time I'll add some more carrots. It was amazing!

Watery broth. I was expecting a much heartier, flavorful broth.

The recipe was simple and good; I believe if you use good ingredients, your meal will taste good. I braised the beef chunks first.  I wanted to find a recipe to use my slow cooker and it was perfect.

The recipe is simple, yet so good!

I put salt, pepper and flour on the meat, and browned it before putting in the slow cooker. Used way more Worcestershire sauce than indicated. I added some red wine and chili powder too, and it tasted really good :)

I love this recipe. It was absolutely delicious and SO easy! I slow cooked it for 12 hours and had it with dumplings and a piece of fresh bread and butter. Perfection.

I have made this many times. I don't like to measure so it always turns out different, but always amazing. If you believe that crock pot means should be a dump and go meal then this is for you. I even mix the flour and the beef right in crock pot, no browning needed.

I made this last night and it was amazing.  I changed 4 things.  Added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, skipped the celery, added Vidalia onions and put enough beef stock into the pot to almost cover everything.  Don't overstuff the pot.   

Everyone was raving about it.  Made a homemade italian bread loaf to go with it.  There was a lot of sauce and the bread help soak it all up.

The best stew recipe I've ever used. Even my non-met and potatoes hubby likes it!  I omitted the flour to make it gluten free and just threw everything in the pot instead of pre-coating the meat. It was great!

Very flavorful and easy to make.  Considered searing the meat before putting in the crockpot but was too lazy.  Fortunately, it turned out great even going the easy route. Would make it again.

I only gave it 4 stars because the written directions are slightly different than the video. The video instructs you to add the paprika with the flour mixture, and the written directions do not. And, the written directions tell you to slow cook for 10-12 hours (which is what I followed), but the video tells you 8. So needless to say, it was overly tender and the potatoes were a little on the over-done side. 

That said, I would definitely make it again (following the video instructions of course).  Very flavorful and easy to make!!

I've been looking for the perfect beef stew recipe, and I've finally found it!  Only thing I will change next time is to double the beef broth... there was not enough "gravy" in it for us.

Disappointing. The meat was delicious, the smell was wonderful. I put a lot more seasoning, more potatoes and more celery, it was a little dry. I think I will try again with twice the amount of broth

I made this  stew according to the exact recipe. It was very good. I made it a second time. I added approx a third pound more meat and used a 1/3 to 1/2 cup of flour. Used beef stock instead of broth. I wish my slow cooker was 4 gallons not 4 qt.  Incredible!!!

I added 1/4 cup of quinoa, 2 tbsp ground flax, extra potatoes (5-6 small red potatoes), carrots (1-2 cups), and celery (3 stalks), and 1 cup of frozen peas.  I had to up the beef broth (3 cups I think) since I added so many extra veggies, but the whole family loved it.

My husband claims he does not like beef stew, but I have now made this Beef Stew for him twice and both times he has gone back for seconds. I did use some of the changes noted by other reviewers and with those changes, this recipe is the best stew.

I followed this recipe exactly.  The beef stew lacks flavor...very bland.  I was hoping it would have a little thicker consistency, but it was pretty watery.  The meat dried out as well.  Maybe I should have browned the meat before putting it in the slow cooker.  I don't think I'll be trying this one again.

My kids and I loved this! It was my very 1st time making Beef Stew! I tweaked it and added an extra teaspoon of all seasonings also added Onion Powder, Seasoning Salt and Adobo. Used crushed bay leaves instead of one single bay leaf. Turned out very flavorful and hearty!

We used my Wildtree on this recipe and changed a few things. First patted meat dry and browned sides in Wildtree Tuscan Oil then tossed in 1/4 cup flour with 1tsp Wildtree Java Rub and and a bit of salt before adding to crock pot. Then minced an onion and sweat it out in left over oil to add to the pot. Added diced carotts and red potatoes then mixed in 1 tsp Wildtree worcestershire into 1 1/2 cups of water along with 1 cup tomato sauce to pour over beef. Dropped in a bay leaf and cooked 6hrs on low. KIDS LOVED IT! THANKS for a GREAT base recipe!

I made this stew and it was just okay.  The stew cooked just fine in the crockpot for the allotted time.  I followed this recipe and dumped the meat in the pot and dumped the flour and seasonings and stirred it around.  Added all the seasonings in the required amount except for the amount of broth.  That was a lot of liquid for a crock pot.  The stew cooked for a full 12 hrs and was very tender.  Veggies were perfect.  However, the stew was way too bland.  There needed to be something added.  The hubby was seasoning with salt and pepper but even then....still was bland in flavor.  It was also too watery... I let it sit but it did not thicken up so I had to scoop some liquid and veggies and I put them in a blender and pureed it and added it back to the stew.  It thickened up right away after that.  I would make this again but I would put in A LOT more of seasoning.s.

I took Corinnes suggestions, it was terrific. Instead of buying the beef stew cubes ,I purchased the meat like a london broil. I cut the meat in strips and tenderized it with a metal mallet . Then I cubed it in bite size pieces. I have always found stew meat tough ,but by tenderizing it & then cutting it myself made it VERY tender. I will never buy pre-cut stew meat again.

Excellent beef stew recipe.  I added some additional Worcestershire sauce and used red potatoes. I also used 1.5 pounds of stew beef and added a chopped shallot to the onion. My Dad said it was the best he's had in many years.

This is a good base recipe to make your own.  I have made this twice and both times I made a flour dredge using Montreal steak seasoning, paprika and season-all.  I also added a cup of cabernet.  This all went into the oven in my dutch oven at 325° for 2.5 hrs.   The second time I used some leftover bacon grease in addition to veggie oil to brown the meat.  Added a whole extra dimension of flavor.  Either way it was excellent.

I absolutely love this recipe and so does my hungry teenager who eats half the batch. I've had to increase the meat and all the veggies to make a bigger batch. This recipe is easy to follow and make, it is a big hit with my entire family.

I made it the way it was posted by the original poste and it was good, but just a tiny bit bland, so I added a little bit of selery salt and it was great. We really liked it, will definately make it again :-)(

Yes it is bland.  It needs probably double the seasonings.  And if you want more sauce/broth, use at least 2C beef broth.  Add more at the end if you want more soupy consistancy.  Once I added a TON of seasoning, it was good.  My variations are: 2 celery, 3 large carrots, 2 red potatoes.  In my seasonings, I included: Seasoning Salt, Garlic Salt & Onion Salt.

I made this as written, except for adding celery seeds in place of celery, only because I had no celery on hand... Excellent beef stew!  Will definitely make again as it's healthy, easy to prepare, and tasty!

Compare with five-hour-stew oven recipes.  I make seasoned flour (flour, salt, pepper) and coat the beef chunks in it, then lightly brown them before putting in slow cooker.  I know it's an extra step, but I feel better about it, and it thickens without the floury lumps seen in  the  recipe photo.  I also add a couple of whole cloves; just be careful not to serve them.

Good flavor, but needed more salt and possibly parsley or oregano. Also needs more flour so that it's not runny.   I will make it again with these adjustments.

It was one of the best slow cooker roast beef recipes I have used. I recommend adding the McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning and 1 Tbs of Worcestershire as Corinne suggested.

I made the recipe as directed and found myself with a good base for customizing the stew for our preferences later down the road. I will probably be more aggressive with the seasoning next time and use only two potatoes (as the potatoes we have in the Pacific Northwest are usually pretty huge), as well as add a bit more broth to the recipe because the liquid did not cover the entire mass, leaving the stew with some patchy/dry pieces of meat and potato. Not perfect, but exactly what I was looking for - a recipe I can adapt for my slow cooking needs!

I've made this many times. I live alone and this makes about 10 meals for me, so it's good for busy weeks. It keeps in the refrigerator well, but it doesn't freeze well. The meat was ok, but the vegetables got mushy. This is my favorite recipe and is delicious every time

Not impressed. I'm convinced the bay leaf ruined it. The aroma and taste was a distraction from this hearty classic. Next time I will follow this recipe minus that.

The absolute worst meal I've ever made. I followed the directions and didn't make any adjustments. Was just a pile of bland mush.

Great recipe. I used onion and garlic powder instead of the real thing because of an allergy to the oils, but it didn't affect the flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! I only gave it 4 stars because I've tried it with browning the meat first and adding 1 tsp salt and it was 5 stars that way.

I substituted Arrowroot in the place of the flour, because I don't eat grains.  This turned out beautifully, just the right amount of thickening and very flavorful!

This recipe tasted just like my dad's. I took the basic recipe and tweaked it some though. I browned off the meat on the stove and softened the potatoes a little on the stove as well. I also threw in carrots and broccoli. For me I also doubled the seasonings as well. I prefer seasoning salt over regular salt as well more flavor in my opinion. I also just used water simply because the beef will make it's own broth and I used a beef cube just for extra beefy flavor.

(I made the recipe using reviewer Corinne's additional suggestions.  I used Merlot for the red wine. )  Excellent recipe with simple ingredients you may actually have on hand.  (I might throw some home canned greenbeans in next time I make it.)  Thanks so much for sharing.  This would be one I would be proud to share with guests and I think this recipe might go camping with us this fall.  Very hearty and thick, truly a stew.

Best beef stew I ever made!  I usually make mine on the stove top, but have a new crock pot, so thought I'd try this recipe out.  It was awesome and so easy- no searing of the beef,  just toss everything in and turn it on- couldn't be easier.  Only change I made was to add a packet of onion soup mix as one reviewer had mentioned-really made it zing!  I'll never do stove top stew again...

Incredibly easy to make and a huge success with the boyfriend and roommate. Everyone wanted a second bowl. Recommend purchasing or making a nice crusty loaf of bread to cut and cover with butter for dunking in the stew. Will definitely make again. Perfect for cold winter days.

Very good stew recipe, perfect for colder weather. I did saute the beef and onions first as well as deglaze the broth with some cooking sherry before adding it to the crock pot. I also thickened it up towards the end of cooking with some cornstarch. Great as is but very easy to tweak to your liking's.

I made this as written except I used my Lodge enameled dutch oven, sauteed the vegetables and browned the floured meat and doubled the beef broth. When it was nearly done I tasted and felt there was just something missing. I added a small can of low sodium tomato sauce, perfection! We actually had this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. Thanks for a super recipe.

Decent beef stew, but a little heavy on garlic.  I think if I make it again, I'll reduce the garlic and let the beef take more of the center stage.

Absolutely delicious beef stew! Perfect cold weather food! I love the fact that there is no searing the meat involved; makes it so easy to prepare. I liked mine topped with Cholula hot sauce and served alongside Mexican corn bread.

Use good filet, 6 instead of 4 carrots, and add green beans. Also add few spoonfuls of canned corn (drained).  Add  Italian parsley and herbs to flour mixture.  

Add additional flour to thicken broth as needed.  After tasting, as needed add salt, worcheshire sauce, lowry's, pepper.  Serve with sourdough rolls.  Heated on high for 4 - 4-1/2 hours.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was passable, but not particularly good and the beef was chewy. To be fair, I think I've concluded there is no way to make good beef (or chicken) in a slow cooker,  much as I REALLY want there to be. That said, this recipe is somewhat bland and watery, so if you're expecting a rich, hearty stew you won't find it with this recipe. Some of the tweaks might get you there but I think the only way to do is to do it properly in a dutch oven or something similar.

Absolutely loved this recipe and made it as the recipe calls for.  Family loved it too.  Just a good old fashioned Beef Stew but in a crock pot.  I used 2.5 lbs of meat so there was a little extra left overs.  So, I just increased all the ingredients slightly.  I used a little more broth so it wasn't dry and plenty of stew.

I made it with Corinne's suggestions.  It was great, but I did need to add a Rue to thicken the broth.

I let it slow cook the whole entire night and woke up the mouth-watering scent of stew. I ate it with bread before heading off to class and when I got back, I ate it with rice. I also made it for my family and they loved it!

I made this as per the recipe. So very delicious! Kids loved it and I loved how fast and easy it is to make. Kids came home after sports, said it smelled so good they gobbled it on the spot.

This was an OK dish.  I followed the recipe as written.  The stew did not have much flavor.  I do not think I will make this recipe again.

QUICK and EASY!!!! I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. I make it exactly as written. The ease of this recipe is what is so wonderful about it, I can throw it together before work and am on my way in a short time and no extra mess or fuss.
Corinne needs to write hers up as a different recipe because it only contains the ingredients but is totally different, which is OK but it is not this recipe.

Maybe I didn't use high quality enough beef, but I didn't love the way the stew turned out (neither did the kids...).  Meat was dry, and overall stew seemed a little boring. Probably won't make again.

I add chopped turnip.  Instead  of using regular potatoes, i put in the mini potatoes, not cut in half. I add 1 cup of frozen peas 20 minutes before the end cook time. I also brown my meat using the flour recommended and add the remaining flour as directed. At the end, I drain the stew and thicken the gravy, adjust the seasonning and return evreything to the crockpot to keep warm until serving. Hearty and delicious!

I tweaked this recipe just a bit. Left out the worchestershire sauce, used a package of herb and garlic seasoning from epicure, then at the very end, thickened the gravy with bisto.  I always tweak the kinds of veggies I use. This time I left out mushrooms and put in sweet potato.  Next time might throw in butternut squash.

I made one small change ... I added 1/4 cup Cabernet souvingnon and 1/2 cup of water. We like our stew with a bit more gravy. With those small additions the stew was delicious!!!! I'm sure it's just as good as written too. Thanks for posting it.

Flavour was good, beef was very tender.
Timing was such that I cooked it 5 and half hours on high. (Recipe says 4-6.) The recipe doesn't have enough water to support this cooking time, and some of the beef and veggies at the outside of the pot ended up slightly burnt. If you choose to use one of the longer cooking times add additional liquids, either more broth or simply water.

This was my first time making beef stew, and this recipe made it pretty easy. The only two things I did differently:
1. I browned the meat before I put it into the crock pot. 2.I used about 1/3 cup more of beef broth. All in all this was a great recipe, and I'll def. make it again.

I made this almost exactly as written, I didn't have garlic  and only a little onion. I put it in slow cooker for 5 hours on high and it was more than done. I had added a little more broth, almost 2 cups. I cut the potato in chunks of about an inch and they were well cooked, I might make them a little larger next time. I am also going to add frozen peas toward the last 20 minutes or so. 
This version was much easier than the one I did on the stove, browning the meat, etc. 
It was tasty and got the "thumb's up" for a second round.

Delicious and so easy. I added an extra can of broth because I like my stew more on the soupy side. This is maybe not as umami as some of the fancier beef recipes out there, but it is hearty, comforting, and really just yummy without requiring much in the way of cost or effort. You just chop a few of things, toss some stuff into a crock pot, and you're done. You get a pretty big payoff for such a small effort. Perfect recipe for busy weekdays in cold weather. I will make this again and again. (However ... if you're looking to cook something for a special occasion, I'd recommend Cooking Light's Provencal Beef Daube instead -- it will cost more to make, dirty more dishes, and take more time to prep, but the result is absolutely wonderful).

I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves it. My daughter, who is very picky, has been begging for it for the past couple of weeks so I am making it today with a fresh supply of potatoes, carrots, and garlic from the garden and fresh stew beef from the half a side we just picked up last week (I love fall)! I follow the directions to the 'T' with one exception: I add an extra half cup or so of beef broth only because my crock loses liquids on long cooks and I noticed my potatoes dried and burned on my first attempt. After the change, it has turned out excellent each time! Bon Appétit!

A little more vegetables, and some extra black pepper. I loved how easy it was. It's perfect for those winter nights, since I don't get home till 7 and WAYYYYY more satisfying then a can of soup. I'll be making this a weekly dinner thank you!

I make this before i leave for work at 6AM it cooks all day and tastes wonderful fir dinner.  Once, when i ran out of beef broth i substituted 1 1/2 XL beef bullion cubes, my family really liked it that time i made it for dinner. Also, to be quicker in the morning, i mix the beef and the flour mixture together and put it in the fridge. This stew is AWESOME and i recommend it to everyone.

I thought this was a great, easy recipe! I made this pretty much as-is (like another reviewer, I think that when you make a zillion tweaks, you might as well post your own version as your own recipe). I threw everything in the crock pot according to the recipe -- with 4 kids, I don't have time for all that pre-browning nonsense. I think I threw in a little extra flour just to make the sauce thicker. I think this would be so easy to add more or different vegetables (some sliced mushrooms would be delicious, or add some sweet potato for something unusual and healthy). One thing I will do differently next time, just for my own taste, is to make more sauce by adding more broth. In any case, this is a winner recipe for my family!

I used this recipe with Corinne's suggestions and my husband, who has previously been very critical of other beef stews I've made, absolutely loved this one. The only thing mine was missing was the bay leaves as I discovered I didn't have any once I'd gotten home from the grocery store, but it still turned out delicious!

So much YUM! I made this hoping it would last me 4-5 days. I'm single so it should have right?  Well I ended up having it for lunch and dinner each day and it only lasted  2 1/2 days. :)
This will stay as a favorite recipe!

Excellent!  I doubled this for my family of 5 (+ love leftovers).  I added an extra bay leaf, and extra potato and a splash of red wine.  I thickened up the sauce at the end with a flour/water mixture, turned out great!!!  Served with some homemade biscuits from this site.

This Beef Stew is very delicious , I cut the recipe in half and cooked it on the stove. I like to sautee my vegetables before I add them to the broth. Instead of the celery ,  I added fresh mushrooms . This Stew has a delicious  and hearty flavour. Thank you for sharing..

Made it just like the recipe.  Found it to need more seasoning, but perfect otherwise and did not pre-cook beef.  We had Penzey's Beef Roast Seasoning on hand, and it did the trick.  Would think fresh herbs could add flavor too.  We have an extremely hot slow cooker and did 2 hrs on high with 6 hours on low.  Almost over-cooked.  If we had cooked any longer, it may have been bad.

I love this recipe! been making it for years. I didn't have ground pepper one time so I used cracked pepper instead and the flavor of the stew definitely changed for the better. I always add more potatoes and carrots since everyone seems to hoard them when I make this. 
it's for sure a perfect stew to top a bowl of rice too 

a friend of mine suggested adding a few short ribs on the bone to it. something about the bone and fat adding more flavor too.

I followed everything to a t and I must say I wasn't a fan of the taste. To doctor it up to make it edible after preparing it the original way I add a packet of beefy onion soup mix to it and a cup of red wine. That helped a lot and even gave me the gravy taste I was looking for. I don't think I'll make this again if so I'll have to adjust a few things.

Just wondering if anyone else had a problem with the stew being runny? I followed the recipie exact and double and tripled checked to make sure i did everything right and i did. :( i ended up adding over double the flour then what the recipie called for and i did get very thick creamy stew. Did anyone have success  with adding just 1/4 cup of flour and yeild a thick creamy stew? And did i do something wrong? Thanks :)

Recipe is great! Only thing you MUST do is brown the beef for a quick sear before throwing it in to the slow cooker and add a half cup or so of red wine. Searing the beef will lock the flavours in.

I loved this recipe as a base. I added fresh corn off the cob, extra potatoes and increased the onion and Worcestershire sauce by 1/2 teaspoon. I added 2 Bay leaves instead of 1. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of Johnny's seasoning salt, a packet of McCormick au jus, and at the end, 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream. It was AMAZING! Best I've ever made. We like to top our stew with sauerkraut and horseradish. My children don't like those things so they opted for ketchup. Surprisingly the ketchup added a sweet tangy flavor. All around amazing and can't wait to make it again. Next time I will brown the stew meat in canola oil (couple tablespoons) before adding to the slow cooker.

Very easy to make ant it's just as good as anything I ate while I was in the Army! LOL

I read some of the suggestions and sautayed the beef coated with the flour and added the onyions and celery to the beef in the frying pan. I also added 1/2 cup red wine.
It was great and my family loved it!

I followed the recipe to the tee and I was satisfied, but not impressed. I like to try recipes to their strict ingredients the first time and then tweak them later. The stew came out tender and juicy, but lacked in the flavor department. I feel it was bland and needed more seasonings, spices and salt. Overall I would recommend this recipe again with a few minor changes.

This is nice and easy to make! Several other recipes called to brown the meat in a skillet first. To me, that defeats the purpose of using a slow cooker. 

I made it just as the recipe outlines. I served it over rice and it was delicious. It would get a 5 star but it still needed some additional seasoning once it was done.

Delicious! Exactly what beef stew should taste like! I made the recipe as is except I omitted celery b/c I don’t like cooked celery and I substituted a sweet potato for one regular potato.

can use sirloin tip roast or boneless chuck pot roast,  (chuck roast will shred)

his recipe was not a favourite. I found it pretty bland. I will tweek it up next time as it is a great starting point for the adventurous chefs/cookers.

Absolutely the best beef stew I've ever had. With this great recipe along with @Corinne's tweaks, this turned out perfectly (this was actually the first time I've made beef stew for myself & family). 
Next time I may omit the McCormick's beef stew seasoning as suggested by Corinne, because I think this recipe has enough flavor on it's own & would like to see the difference without it. 
Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. My family loved it & couldn't get enough! This is the type of stew I'd want to make a double batch of to share with friends & neighbors, it's that good. :)

I've made this recipe several time and my family request it often. I like it because you can throw all the ingredients in the crockpot and don't have to brown the meat first. Over time, I've added and adjusted ingredients based on the availability of my pantry. One of my favorite substitutes is replacing the beef broth with tomato soup.

One of the easiest slow cooker beef stew recipes I've found and the final product was GREAT! The only two changes I made to the recipe was that 1) I used 3/4 cup beef broth and 3/4 cup red cooking wine and 2) I added mushrooms. I served mine over mashed cauliflower with garlic and butter (a low-carb alternative to mashed potatoes) & it was a big hit!

Easy enough to get started but the recipe lacked complexity.  
Easy upgrades without adding stuff to wash in the sink:

Add up to 2-4 table spoons of ketchup or even better, tomato paste.  Taste for balance.
Add 2 tb of sugar.
To add oomph to the beef, marinate it for 15-20 min in 2 tb of soy sauce and coat with the flour (as the recipe directs).  
If you wanna be fancy, add some orange peel and remove after slow cooking.  I also would swap out some of the broth with a can of beer instead.  =)

These steps to me, add a bit of sweetness and acidity to play off the mushy saltiness of the broth.

Made a nice thick stew that was very easy to prep. It just needs something but I'm not sure what. It just had very little flavor.

I tried this recipe as stated, and while it was filling and hearty, the flavor just wasn't full-bodied enough. I would probably try some tweaks like adding red wine, gravy, more garlic etc as others have suggested, and see how we go. I used a high setting for 6 hours and thought the beef was very tender and the vegetables were cooked just-right.

Thank you for this recipe and to Corinne for her recommended changes! This is the first real thing I have ever cooked. I've decided to cook a meal every weekend and this was my first one! I followed Corinne's recipe to a T and it was perfect! I decided to also add tomato paste (on my mum's suggestion) and it was so delicious! Dinners and lunches for the next couple of days, taken care of :D

I loved it and so did my family, I did make a few tweeks to the recipe though. I used more meat for a meatier stew. I used a lot more Worcestershire sauce than stated. I used Smoked Paprika. My husband is not a fan of Beef Stew. After he tried it he had 2 servings and said he would eat this again!

I love the idea of this, and it was easy. The problem was it didn't have any flavor. My family hasn't impressed. It needs a lot of added flavoring to make this recipe work.

There is a dominant flavour in this recipe that my family hated.  First time the only change I made was added a few sprigs of thyme so I thought that might be it.  Second time didn't change anything and it was still there (a little less so though)...pretty sure it's the bay leaf.  Totally ruins the flavour IMO.  I do like the texture of the meat though.

I also followed Corinne's changes and it turned out fantastic. I used about 2 lbs of Costco "Stew Meat" which contains a lot of smaller pieces of tenderloin. Delicious!

Thanks BUCHKO - Surprisingly good considering minimal seasonings. I use liners, so I shake up the beef, flour and seasonings in that before adding vegetables. I cook the mixture on low for about 3 hours before adding liquid (usually Better-than-Bullion low-sodium beef) - to me it's better than cooking beef submerged, especially on low, and maybe similar effect to pre-browning in a skillet, which to me doesn't count as a slow-ccoker recipe. For the last hour I add whole mushrooms and another clove or two of garlic.

I've also turned it into a topnotch soup with finer chopping, more broth and barley (last hour) instead of the potatos...

Edit 5Dec2016> I refer to this recipe for seasoning when making beef stew, but I skip potatoes now and add other lower-carb vegetables so not really the same recipe. Cabbage, fresh green beans, asparagus and kale are all good if added toward the end. I'm strongly tempted to try cauliflower since I love it roasted.  I'm not big on cooked carrots but in this  whole baby carrots are delicious. Also, when boneless short ribs are on sale I use those along with extra lean, sirloin, or organic stew beef. I also hit the seasonings much harder, except salt and bay leaf (one seems to be plenty).

I would have given this 5 stars as the taste was delicious and the sauce it created was the perfect consistency. The meat nearly disintegrated, but may have been my fault as the pieces were small and I perhaps cooked it too long.

I was looking for an easy recipe! This is so easy!  Although I didn't have carrots and celery I wanted to try it anyway!   It was delicious! I increased the potatoes and onions just to have more veges because that's all I had!  Turned out great!

Needs a little more crushed garlic, apple cider vinegar and horseradish.  Otherwise OK.  I also use Heinz 57 steak sauce - brightens up the flavor for autumn winter.

Loved it. Did some tweaking. I had only about 5 hrs, so I cooked the meat on the stove top before adding to crock pot and cooked on high temperature. Added a little more seasonings but came out great! Will definitely be using this again. My 5 year old suggested rice! Will try it with rice next time! :) 
Thanks!

This recipe is great! Next time I think I will do a little less meat and more veggies, the ratio is a little off. The only thing I did different was add oregano and rosemary and a little more Worcestershire. As for Corinne's suggestion, she needs to make her own recipe, as it is not this recipe at all!

I prepped this recipe the night before so I could just throw it all in the crock pot in the morning. I dredged the beef in flour in a ziplock bag w pepper and salt, only difference to the recipe is I used chicken broth instead of beef (less salty) and forgot the carrots  and Worcester. It still turned out beautifully, cooked it 12 hours slow. Meat was so tender and flavorful, it was incredible.

Awesome & Easy!! I used Corinnes seasoning suggestions and added a dash of hot sauce for a little kick. Delicious! I did brown the meat before putting in the slow cooker. The seasoned salt and extra garlic with the hot sauce gives this beef stew the extra flavor to keep it from being the boring and bland stew I grew up with.

I have to say that I agree with canucky. Of course, I know that beef stew is traditionally dredged with flour and browned in oil. Reviews based on corinne's "adjusted" recipe are not reviews of this non fat recipe. I am looking for a tasty non-fat recipe. Haven't made this yet, but it looks good.

I followed the recipe exactly. No need to rate it if many changes are made. I found it to be very good but a bit bland. After it was cooked, I added 1T of Italian seasoning. I like heat and probably would have added red pepper flakes but I really made this for my dog to add on top of her food to intice her to eat. She loved it and so did I.

I'm glad I resisted making this more complicated.  I didn't brown the meat, as some suggested,  and it worked fine, with less mess.  I did add 1/2 cup of wine, 2 pinches of italian seasoning, a small turnip, and mushrooms.  Great flavor and so easy.  Was done on high in 3.5 hours, and still great even though I rushed it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Started out by making this the way it is written-let it cook on high for 5 hours and tasted it.  Super bland!  I had to add another 1 1/ teaspoons of salt, several big dashes of Worcestershire sauce, more garlic, more pepper, some tomato sauce. The one thing I will say is that the consistency was good-not too thick and not too thin.  But overall, very disappointing.  With beef being fairly expensive these days, I'll stick with my dutch oven recipe.  It's more work, but it pays off!

Prepared as OP said but used 4 cups warm water with aprox 3 TBS beef bullion as I didn't have any broth. Added mushrooms that I sliced about 2hrs before finished. Also, 1hr before finish used 1/2 cup cool water mixed with beef bullion and 2TBS AP flower to thicken. Total cook time...first 4hrs low...last 3hrs high.

A big hit with my family!  I added an extra clove of garlic, a couple of extra potatoes (my potatoes were small to medium sized) and a brown gravy packet (as I always have when making beef stew).  Great flavor and very easy!

I used way more vegetables than the recipe called for which required water but it was fantastic!!!! I like my food to be about the veggies and I did add some flour to thicken the mixture. Crock pot for 12 hours and everyone loved it. A new recipe favorite.

I also followed Corinne's suggestions although I don't doubt the base recipe is also terrific. It was very good. I also added in red and yellow pepper and more celery as I love veggies. I added a bit more beef broth as well. All around it was fabulous!

Meat was really tender. No need to tweak for very good stew. Next time I will make adjusts because we prefer a little more peppery spice in my house.

Great recipe, so easy, no browning of the meat! I added 2 cups of red wine and 1 cup of  mushroom slices, and thickened the gravy with corn starch.
Superb! good enough to serve company with a salad and bagette.

The flavors were nice and well rounded. Disappointed by the lack of liquid which left the meal feeling very un-stew like.  I will probably try it again, but I may add more liquid, either as more broth or red wine as others have suggested.

This stew is very tasty indeed, but I found that it needs a bit more salt (maybe another 1/4 tsp.? Or perhaps a little more Worcestershire?) and I would have liked a thicker sauce - mine came out very soupy. But still quite tasty. Note that I followed the recipe as indicated in the video, which differed in some respects from the written recipe.

I thought the recipe was excellent. I Did it almost exactly was written. I didn't have Beef broth however, I did boil 2 cups of water and dissolved 1 1/2 cubes of beef buillon. I added no additional salt. It came out perfect!

Made this last night and followed the directions exactly...except I haven't been feeling well and accidentally used 2 tsp of pepper instead of 1/2!! Yikes it was peppery! At dinner time when I finally tasted it, I went back to look at the measure spoon that I had used still in the dishwasher and realized my mistake. Oop! Other than that it was great. My family all loved it. I thought it was pretty easy to prep in the morning before I left for work so will definitely be making again...just with a little less pepper next time. Will re-review at that time to see if I give it the full five stars when its true non-peppery flavor can come through. As it is, I would have given it 4.5 stars.

I made this recipe last night and thought it turned out great. I did not change one thing about it. I love how easy it is and makes a ton. Baguette bread is good to dip in the stew . Thank you for the recipe :)

Almost Perfect!  Quick and easy with only a handful of ingredients. The whole family loved it. I added 1.5 cups of water because the broth was VERY thick- other than that it was perfect.

This recipe is great! I followed the recipe as is(didnt brown the meat first). I added a little extra beef broth and added some water because I like it with a little more broth. I went a little heavy on the veggies and added some chunks of fresh jersey tomato and sweet peas!

We loved it! I ended up cooking it on the stovetop but it was still good and the meat got very tender with the potatoes staying a little firm, which we like! I cooked it on low for about 4 hours, our stove runs pretty high, and it came out great!

I made this just as directed and the flavor was good, a little bland. Needed lots of spicing up. I was disappointed in how thin the consistency was. I like a bit thicker stew. I'll have to tweak it next time.

This was absolutely delicious.  The meat was so tender!  I doubled the recipe but followed the ingredients exactly.  I cooked it on low for 7 hours and high for the last 2 hours.  I made this for me and my boyfriend and served it with Italian bread for dipping.  I also added more black pepper to mine, but my boyfriend left it as is and we both really enjoyed it.  It was so easy to make, and it was my first time using my slow cooker.  I didn't do any of the extra steps, like browning the meat first, like other reviewers suggested.  I think it is unnecessary and recipe is good as is.

This is a great simple, easy, basic stew recipe. It does not need a complete overhaul like Corinne gave it. Its excellent AS IS. I double the recipe, since my crock pot is big, and it tastes just as yummy.

Really really good as is. I did brown the meat first, otherwise left it as written. Good thick juice, although I thought at first that there wasn't enough liquid when I turned it on. I will add peas next time.

Very good stew. My only problem was while set on high due to the flour the meat seemed to stick a bit to the pot. Would I make it again? Sure would. Next time on low. Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved this recipe! Easy to just set aside and forget, if made in the morning. Then bam! You've got a delicious hearty meal for every one in the evening. My only recommendation is to substitute V8 for half the beef broth to tenderize the beef bits. Overall: fun easy recipe.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I first made it for my toddler's lunches. I would make a batch and freeze them in muffin cups for his lunches. My husband likes it so much that now I make it a double-batch so that we can have it for supper and still have some left over to freeze. I like that it's so fast and easy to make, otherwise I probably wouldn't have time.

So simple!  I love that you don't have brown the meat first!  I used more vegetables & less beef, but my husband still ate 3 bowls.  He put hot sauce on the last helping.  He liked it even better with a little afterburn!  Delicious!

I have made this recipe a few times now. Each time I have used the exact ingredients. I did not make any changes and it is a HUGE hit! I'm lucky if there are any leftovers... Thank you so much :) I can't wait to make it again!

Had to make a lot of last minute adjustments to make this worth serving for dinner. Too many dollops, pinches, handfuls to record.

This recipe is perfect as written.  If you want a more complicated recipe like you can find them.  This is a great down home, authentic beef stew - easy and delicious as the author stated.  Thanks so much - we Americans have a hard time admitting something simple can be amazing.

I was going to make this recipe according to others suggestions, but decided to just follow the recipe as is. The only thing that I did was add more veggies. 4 potatoes just wasn't enough and I added a bit more celery as well. Even with the flour this seemed very watery to me. I ended up stirring in a 4oz can of tomato puree and a little sugar. This helped thicken up the broth and added a richer flavor to the stew. It turned out delicious. 

It was very tasty before my additions and probably would have been just as good minus the puree. I just prefer a thicker stew.

This stew was delic!  I doubled the amount of beef broth because we like extra juice. I also added a beef stew seasoning packet based off some of the other reviews. Yummy!!!! I would say the prep time is more like an hour not 20 min.

Excellent recipe and very easy.  Followed exactly except I used venison instead of beef because it was what I had on hand, and added a little extra beef broth.  I will make this one again!

This is a great basic recipe.  I use a dark beer with the beef broth for better flavor.  We have made stew with Guinness, Pecan ale and Nut Brown Ale as well.  I think the beer or ale makes the meat more tender.

Not bad... but not great either. I thought this had VERY little flavor. Also, a lot of meat and not a lot of vegetables. I plan to play with the recipe and try the suggestions of others to spice this up a bit.

EDIT: Tried this again using Corinne's suggestions, plus I added some fresh mushrooms, a can of corn, and a handful of green beans... DELICIOUS! MUCH more flavorful with the extra seasonings. I would say this is 3 stars as is, 5 stars with Corrine/my changes.

Great recipe and easy to make.  I followed the recipe as is and found that it needed just a touch more seasoning.  Next time I will use some of the suggestions for adding a little more flavoring.  But I will definitely be making this one again.  So yummy for a cold wintery day and the house smells great!

This recipe was really good.  The only change I made was to add more liquid.  The amount of broth did not nearly cover all the ingredients, I ended up more than doubling the amount of broth to make sure all the vegetables would be covered and not dry out.

Nothing fancy with the taste.   Was a little disappointed that there wasn't any sauce.  Actually the veggies got stuck to the slow cooker, which was set to eight hours.   I don't think I'll be trying again.

I cooked this for 10 hours on low, which I think was too long because all the meat shredded way more than I'm used to with beef stew.  There weren't any large chunks left.  I am going to try again and do the 4 hours on high to see how it turns out.  Other than that, it was delicious - very hearty and lasted for days!  I personally thought it needed more salt, but my boyfriend thought it was just right.

This was excellent as is - I just added a little red wine as one reviewer suggested.  I did add 2T cornstarch mixed in 1/4 cup of cold water to thicken.  I will make this again!

AWESOME!  I only had 1lb of meat but I added green beans and peas and a few of the HEBH's tricks... so tasty!  It was my first slow cooker stew and it was great!  Thanks for posting.

Awesome dish, particularly since I'm not a fan of stew in the first place. Followed Corinne's review and coated the beef with flour and sautéed with onions first, added wine, broth Worcester to deglaze, then a packet of McCormick's beef stew seasoning, garlic on top,.. but only cooked 4 hours on high in slow cooker… meat was very tender, veggies and gravy (perfect thickness) … delicious! Thank you for sharing.

Made this recipe this evening for dinner. I tried several stew recipes in this ones the best AND easy to prepare! I didn't have to brown the meat prior to putting in the crockpot like other reviews said. I followed the directions to the T and cook on high for four hours. Meat was tender. Even my picky son ate it up!

Tasted great! I made it a second time and I added a bit more beef and a packet of beef stew seasoning and it came out a little bit more to my taste. The original recipe was really good too though.

I loved it! But...my family did not. Hubby says the wine gave it an off taste :-( I used Pinot Noir. We aren't huge wine drinkers but it's a wine we typically like. Too bad for me. It was a very easy recipe even with browning the meat first!

For me, the point of choosing a slow cooker recipe is to limit the dishes I have to wash and steps I have to take. I'm a busy mom living in an apartment. Our dishwasher's name is Me and Hubby. So this recipe is perfect for us. It's easy. It is tasty. It may not be as rich in flavour as Corinne's version, but it tastes good to us. I use Better than Boullion instead of canned broth. That's the only thing I do differently.

Made the recipe per instructions.  Meat was very tender, vegetables were great, but there was not enough flavor for us.  Will probably try again with some of the other reviewer's suggestions to punch up the flavor.

I tried it as is. I found it to be too salty. Next time I will use 2 boullion cubes. The meat was very moist and falling apart. I will double it next time as it fed 3 adults and 2 kids with no leftovers.

I made this stew yesterday.  I did not add the bayleaf and used 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh.  Also added one extra potato.  It was outstanding!  The smell was divine as it cooked, and it really was the best crock pot stew I've ever made.   So simple with no meat browning first and I'll never make any other recipe after trying this one!

I followed the rexipe except to brown the flour- coated beef first , then tossed everything in the slow cooker on low for 12 hours. Good flavor but meat was a liitle dry. Next time I'll not brown the meat and will stir more often. All the liquid soaked in,  too, so I'll probably add some water or broth midway.

Maaaaaaann, there's nothing wrong with this recipe as is!  I just had my first bowl.  I say try it that way first before putting in suggestions.  I cooked mine on low for 8 hours.  Meat DEFINITELY didn't need to be seared first.  If that's your requirement, you might as well use a dutch oven and scrap the whole slow cooker idea.  My beef turned out brown and tender without that.  In the future, I MIGHT play around with the amount of garlic or onions or seasonings added, but this is a very good recipe.....AS IS.

I appreciate when any given receive has tweaks! It customizes the base and enhances the base to the individual. Corinne's additions were AMAZING! Not only does my house smell great, my family is trying to rush the slow cooker and the red wine made my prep much more fun!! This recipe is definitely saved for future use!!

I work night shift and needed something to cook while everyone was gone ti work and school. I made it to recipe standards. It turned out awesome and plan on making it again. By the way there was no leftovers for me to take to work.

One of the things I really about this site is reading the revisions & changes other cooks have made. I understand that in a sense you are rating a different recipe but if everyone posted their own recipes instead of posting their changes, this would be a very different site. What I do agree with is NOT giving a recipe low stars when you didn't follow the recipe as written.
I'm giving this recipe five stars even though I have not yet made it because you can't post without rating.

Amazing! As a college student I don't have a lot of time to cook. This recipe is amazing for putting on in the morning and then heading out the door. Followed the recipe to a tee and didn't make any adjustments. Tastes just like my Mom makes at home. I will be saving this and making again.

This is just how I make my beef stew (or lamb stew) except I don't use garlic or bay leaf.  I sometimes use half a can of beer along with the beef broth, and sometimes throw some frozen peas in when it's almost done.  The flour added before hand makes it thick and delicious which is wonderful to come home to after a long work day!

This is a totally solid recipe for beef stew.  I changed nothing. But had to leave out a potato and a carrot because my pot was too small or my potatoes were too big. I still loved it and will cook it again!  Thanks!

Made this recipe as is and was excellent! The only addition was during the last hour of cooking added one additional cup of beef broth thickened with a little cornstarch because our family likes more gravy in our stew. Thanks for posting!

The great thing about this dish is you can make it Gluten-Free!!! Trying to cook meals for a child with Diabetes and Celiac's is tough.  This meal was tasty and filling using all Gluten Free ingredients.  Definitely recommend coating the meat with flour and browning in a skillet with olive oil, garlic and onions before putting in the slow cooker! Excellent dish!!

This is a great recipe. I also covered the stew meat in the flour/salt/pepper mix, and then browned in a pan prior to throwing everything in a pot. Took about 5 hours on simmer. Great recipe!

It's very tasty & traditional! I skipped out on the celery & added a 1/2 cup more of broth (because I like more juice). It was fantastic!

This is the best beef stew I ever made, and even the best I've ever eaten.  I used all of the recommendations made by Corrine.  I was away most of the day, when I came home I did have to add more liquid (I used about a quarter cup of broth) and stir frequently once I got home.  It was done before the 10hours, and it did stick to the sides of the pot while unattended.  I'd definitely recommend greasing the pot ahead of time to speed clean-up if you won't be home to stir it.  I LOVE this stew!!!!!!  I do agree that Corrine should submit her own recipe, it's different enough from the original to warrant a new one.  I've written all of the changes on my copy and will make it again soon.  What wonderful food.

I'd give it 4.5 stars for ease of preparation. However, I thought it undersalted (not a big deal), and the flavor to be a little too bland for my taste. I'd add some other dried herbs (thyme, basil, or oregano?). Also, is it just me, but in the video for this recipe, it looks like the person is adding more the one clove of garlic.

I based my rating on the recipe made exactly as written. It was okay. I think if I make it again, I will omit the Worcestershire sauce (it added a weird hint of sweetness (?) to it), add a cup of frozen peas in the last 15 minutes, and increase the salt to 1 to 1-1/2 teaspoons.

That was really good. Even my picky toddler loved it. It was wayyy done after only 8 hours, but I suspect my slow cooker is running hot. I love how simple this recipe was; no need to sear or deglaze anything, it's delicious as is.

Well I followed this recipe to the letter and it was blah!! The meat was nice and tender but it just created this oily bland flavorless gravy. I wouldn't even know what modification to suggest to improve this other than trying another recipe. Blah!!!

Really nice flavour.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except I added more potatoes as we really like them in a stew.  I also added more beef broth and slow cooked it all day.  I also added peas in the last half hour.  Very yummy and I will make it again.

I didn't like this recipe at all....  Maybe I'm so used to a Japanese style beef stew...  I ended up adding some red wine, more Worcestershire sauce and some tomato sauce.  Then it tasted pretty good.  Not making it again.

We didn't like the reheated version as much. It was too thick, maybe because of the flour.  Does anybody have a suggestion?

Simply Perfect !

I'm a busy full time student/wife/full time worker.. Slow cooker meals are God-sent... I tried this today and it had the most amazing flavor. I used Cabernet for the  red wine and I did not have the flavor packet that Corrine suggested so I threw in a  beef bouillon cube.  Amazing soup... and the house smells terrific..

Wonderful, simple, Delicious! I dont know what kind of beef "stew" meat is but I bought Beef Chuck and cut it myself, I added a diced tomato, corn kernels from a left over corn on the cob and 1 beef bouillon cube. I was skeptical of not browning the meat first but this is the PERFECT 1 step dish. Simply Delicious!

I swapped out the Worcestershire sauce and used a capful of Kitchen Bouquet and a couple of squirts of ketchup. I used Wondra flour on 2 lbs of chuck roast I cut into cubes. Last hour added summer squash and cut up eggplant. I didn't use any wine, very flavorful . Took ideas from previous beef meals and created this. Really good!

Fantastic! I used Corinne's recommended changes and used sweet potatoes instead (sliced thinly to ensure they cooked). When it was finished I sprinkled on some quinoa and sliced avocado. This is my favourite slow cooker recipe so far.

I almost made according to directions.  I left my vegetables in large pieces, rather than dicing.  I added a few additional herbs including, basil, thyme, and herbes de provence, which made for a tasty stew. My husband was very impressed.

Easy to make exactly as stated and pretty good tasting, but could definitely use some more spices/flavor. Will make again and throw in some user suggestions.

Hey fellow crockpotians,
I found this recipe to be somewhat dried out.
I used 1 2/3 cups of beef broth (campbells).
However, I also used 4 potatoes and 5 carrots as well as about 4 or 5 stalks of celery. I stirred everything together so it was mixed, is that where i went wrong? The potatoes seemed to not be soft and ... yeah - 
I have a 'crockpot' 6qt i picked up from sears, this was my 1st run at it.

at the end of the day it was pretty good.
however, i would like to know if anyone else found it to be somewhat lacking in terms of 'softness'

cheers.

This was good, but not as good as Slow Cooker Beef Stew IV. That recipe is more work than this one, but it also tastes better in the end. It has a lot to do with flouring and browning the meat first.

I was very excited to try this recipe because it had received so many positive reviews however, I thought that it was very bland. I was a little disappointed. I also agree that there weren't enough vegetables in proportion to the meet. Next, I will add more vegetables, herbs, and spices.

OK...here's the thing.  It was easy to make.  However, there isn't enough liquid in it!  I woke up to a crock pot full of MUSHY GOOP.  I'm sure I'll make beef stew again in the crock pot, but I'll be adding much much more beef stock to it!

Everyone  really liked it. Although I doubled the salt, (used sea salt) it still it needed more. Other then that I followed the recipe. Really easy to make and none was leftover.

I gave this 4 stars although my boyfriend gave it 3 stars.  He kept saying that there was a flavor that was keeping it from being really good and when we reviewed the ingredients, he said it was the Worcestershire Sauce.  If I made this again, I will remove that sauce and perhaps add a little red wine or something.

Made this recipe tonight following some of the other reviewers advice. I used steak seasoning with the flour instead of just salt and pepper and tossed the steak in it first before pan searing it in oil. I also tripled the garlic and added italian seasoning. Followed everything else and it turned out great! Will be making it again. Might add a 1/4 cup of red wine and stewed tomatoes to mix it up a bit. Oh....I also added about a teaspoon of sugar.

Turned out great!  I used elk instead of the beef and doubled the recipe.  It turned out delicious and the meat was tender.

We did not care for this.  Lacked flavor.  So we added curry and chopped apples to add some flavor and make it eatable.

The stew turned out fantastic! I browned the meat in olive oil and used 1/3 c flour as recommended by other reviews. I cooked mine in a crockpot and used a stew seasoning packet that I happened to have on hand. Using the extra flour really made the consistency perfect, better than other recipes I've tried. I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was OK but not the best one I have ever had.  We actually prefer the oven baked stew recipe that I have been making for 25 years.  It is made with tomato juice,  which we believe gives stew a better taste.

I added the stew seasoning pack and a half can of tomato sauce. I used more beef broth to cover the veggies. I like green beans in my stew, so i threw in a bag on italian cut green beans. The broth soaked into the green beans and tasted fantastic! Will definitely make this again.

This stew was absolutely drop dead delicious!  I followed Corrine's advice and added red wine plus tweaked other ingredients to her suggestion.  HOWEVER, I had been reading some of the reviews (more than 1700, so can't hit them all) and someone had suggested adding a little tabasco.  Does anyone know who that was and how much I added?  For some reason, I didn't save the printed recipe (probably had stew all over it ;) so I'm wondering how much tabasco I added.  Hubby said "Don't change a thing!" and he's been asking for it ever since, so I want to include that tabasco.  Just don't know how much!

One of my favorites from allrecipes.  This has become a trusted staple in my recipe box.  It's an all-around reliable, tasty stew, perfect for a rainy weekend day (we get a lot of those in Seattle!)

I'm typing this as the smell of beef stew in the kitchen wafts in through the living room.  Making me hungry!  Almost time to cook up some cornbread!

I followed Corrine's advice and made all the same adjustments, except used only 1/2 a pack of Club House stew seasoning. I generally don't eat beef, and made this more for my husband, but I loved it so much I had seconds, plus leftovers for lunch. This will be my go to beef stew recipe from now on!

Flouring and browning the meat is essential for flavor..I cooked on high for 2 hours then reduced to low for several more hours (or over night)..I also add extra potatoes, as the smaller pieces break down they help to thicken the stew...the last hour I added frozen green beans and corn...the stew thickens on its own ... I'll be using the leftovers for a potpie!

Great recipe. I followed the recipe for the most part. I prefer to brown the meat before putting in the slow cooker. I think it gives better flavor and presentation. Also sauted the onions before putting in the cooker. Then deglazed the pan with some of the broth to get all the great flavors bits out of the pan. I also added some peas and corn to the stew. Will definately make again.

Not awful, but nothing that anyone in my family would request a 2nd time.  Everyone said it was blah & needed something, more spices or seasonings or something.  I followed the recipe as is, which is what I always try to do the first time around.  Maybe with some tweaks it would be better.

I made this just like the recipe but left out the celery and used a few less carrots. Everyone loved it! I've made it twice now and both times it was a huge hit. One thing I love about it is that I don't have to mess with browning the meat first.

It was good enough to make again, but with a little more seasoning. Was really easy to prepare, and went great with our homemade bread.

I made this recipe and my wife and I liked it a lot.  We'll definitely make it again.  One thing, though.  I think a stalk of celery would have been way too much.  I used 2 ribs and that was plenty.  Next time I'll probably just use one rib.

I think I could probably find a better recipe out there. The stew was good, but I had to add more water to the recipe than suggested, as it was slightly on the dry side. It definitely needed more seasoning (salt) as well.

The reason we brown meat in flour is to accomplish the Maillard reaction.  This will produce a profusion of various flavor molecules.

I made this the other day with chicken broth because I didn't have any beef broth and it was still delicious! The changes I made...I added 1 more potato, and tripled the carrots and celery (it didn't have enough veggies IMO), about a cup more broth, and a few more cloves of garlic (we love garlic). I will be making this again with the beef broth for tomorrow nights dinner and I'm sure it can only be better :) We will definitely be keeping this recipe in rotation!!! Thank you.

Per another reviewer; Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth  with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick's Beef Stew Seasoning.

I've done this both in the slow-cooker and on the stove-top (faster). I sauteed the mushrooms and onions first, and probably increased the veggies more than what is posted. Last night (2/1/11), I used steak that had been in the freezer for awhile and my husband thought it would be too tough on the grill, but it was great in this stew! I also used whole wheat flour, instead of white flour.

Very easy to make.  I added a little red wine as suggested by other people and added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken a little.  I like a thicker stew.   With a side salad and some bread, we had a great meal.  I will keep this recipe and make again!

Great recipie, we like our stew with a little extra sauce so I increased the broth to 2 cups.  Also added a few extra carrots (I used baby carrots), and 1 extra potato, and a can of green chili's and an envelope of beef stew mix.  I served it on top of steamed rice in order to stretch it for my large family.

I'm making this stew for the second time in two weeks.  It was delicious the first time around!  I love not having to brown the beef.  I made a few substitutions, which were great, and easy to do thanks to the simplicity.  I recommend trying it with sweet potatoes, as it adds a nice element to the flavor.  I also threw in some mushrooms, since I had them lying around.  Some fresh bread added to this would be amazing!

I think I didn't love this because of a mistake I made.  So my advice - adhere to the cooking time suggested!  I over cooked it and it was so bland and one textured I didn't eat it.  I think it would be great if I cut the cooking time down to what is advised.

FAMILY FAVOURITE!   The first time I made this using some leftover BBQ steak, my family was fighting over the last bowl.   I brown the meat whe making from scratch as they prefer the texture and colour.

This was really good! Cooked it on high for about 6 hours and no burning at all. We substituted 1/2 cup of beef broth with red wine, but I think it needs a little more flavor in general, maybe some more spices. I ended up having to add salt. I served it with place-and-bake crescents and they were awesome with the gravy. Overall, good comfort food for a chilly autumn day.

Very tasy and pretty easy once you do the prep work. I doubled the recipe and I followed others suggestions to use some wine. I did not do the dredging in flour and slight frying of meat( no flour!!). I did use about 4 TBLs of cornstarch, seasoned well whisked in some broth at the end (last 15-20 minutes)and it turned out great. And my power went out for 2 hours!! but it was still delish.

Very good stew!  My kids really liked it - my 10 yr old son ate 3 bowls!  I didn't use my slow cooker.  Instead, I browned the flour-dredged meat in my cast iron dutch oven then added all the veggies and broth and popped it in 250 degree oven and let it cook all morning and while we were at church.  The house smelled amazing when we got home.  Cook time was about 5 hours.  Next time I would add more liquid as I like more broth in my stew.  With homemade cornbread it was a great meal!

This recipe is amazing, even my picky dad and kids eat it all.  I added zucchini and put 3 tbl of worcestershire instead of 1 tsp and put in enough beef broth to cover.  I also added a packet of beef stew seasoning which gave it wonderful flavor.  I also love it because it's very healthy and good for my family. I will make this for many years to come

I made exactly as written and it was good, but I thought it was a little bland.  After reading Corinne's comments, I will try again and ad the McCormick's Stew Seasoning and see if I can get it to taste like 5 stars.

Cooked on high for 10 hours and it was not done.  Can't get the carrots and potatos to soften next time I will use very small pieces. Added a lot to the stew per member comments.

This recipe came out great.  My husband loved how meaty it was.  But I did make a few changes.  I cubed the potatoes and had to add a little more seasoning.

I thought this recipe was great! I did add about 7 oz of red wine because I just happened to have it laying around, and I added a bit more garlic, paprika, & Worc sacue. I turned out awesome and I will for sure be making it again.

Bland, lacks flavor. Add seasoning such as Lawry's Seasoning Salt. Good base to build from though to suit your taste!

Made the following alterations to the original recipe. I used 1/2 cup flour for the flour mixture. I also pan fried the meat after dredging in flour mixture in olive oil until browned. I used baby carrots instead of sliced regular. I also used 2 15 oz cans of beef broth, two packets of brown gravy mix, 3 tbsp corn starch to thicken and 1/2 cup red cooking wine. I also added 1 tsp of thyme.  delicious!

Made as written.  Excellent.  I am making again today without the veggies and will add Rotini noodles instead toward the end to make beef and noodles.

I browned the meat in EVOO. Add the onions the last two minutes to the meat. Move meat and onion to the crock pot and use about 1/2 c. red wine to deglaze the pan. I also added 1/2 tsp dried thyme and oregano for flavor.

This was great! I made it for my parents and the loved it! I followed the instructions pretty much but used 2 beef boullion cubes with 2 cups water because that's what I had. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so I skipped that but I did add a 1/2 cup of Pinot Noir! Oh, and when it was all ready I poured some boiling water in to make sure I had enough for 5 people. The recipe says it serves 6 and I'm sure it does but it was very thick and I wanted it to last longer so I just added the extra hot water. Didn't dilute the taste at all! I'll be making this again for sure.

This stew is absolutely delicious! The only thing I did was add extra beef broth as I didn't find 1 1/2 cups to be enough. I will make this recipe again as my family loved it.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I did differently was leave out the potatoes and added 1 1/2 cups beef broth.  We like to eat ours over rice and this has more of a soup quality.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!   I followed the modifications including the red wine, extra worcestershire, extra water, extra garlic and the McCormick's seasoning... I actually found it almost too "savoury".  Next time, I'm going to delete the beef broth and maybe not use the whole packet of McCormick's seasoning.  Still, the beef was super tender and moist.  Will definitely do this again!

This is a very nice recipe - the flavor grew on us the more we ate of it.  The only change I made was to double the Worcestershire sauce. When I make it again I will probably add some pearl onions & peas, per my husband's request.  This is an excellent recipe as written, a definite keeper.  I wanted something simple and this was perfect.

As Always, I made this recipe exactly as written. When it was done, it seemed too watery, so I added some flour mixture to thicken it up. That was fine. Once I tried it, it def. needed some salt. The flavour was kind of bland, I would have liked more flavour for sure. Next time I will try mixing in some lipton onion soup mix for added flavour.  I did not brown the meat before and it turned out perfect, very very tender, so dont waste your time browning the meat as others suggested.  I think this is a good base recipe for Stew, but needs more flavour!

LOVE this recipe....although there are many suggestions regarding "tweaking" it - the recipe doesn't need tweaking! - The beauty of the recipe is the a minimal prep time...previously I've used  the "brown the beef" method so I was a little hesitant about not doing that...but the results were wonderful...tender, moist and delicious. The only adjustment I will make next time is to double the recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing.

All my boys (and Dad!) love this recipe, and I think it's just like "Mom used to make". Sincerely, it's a trip down memory lane for me every time we have it. No modifications needed for us. Excellent!

This is quite easy to make and hard to make a mistake which is great for beginner cooks like myself. I added mushrooms and left out the paprika and bay leaf. Also, I added about twice the amount of beef broth because I wanted a bit more of a soup. I will make this again! I only cook for one and this was a wonderful warm dish to come home to!

definately needed more salt, but that may have been due to the low sodium broth that I used. Easy prep though, and it was great coming home to a ready to eat dinner.

This was really good, but I've had better stew a few times before.  Served it with cornbread muffins crumbled on top, and followed the custom recipe that seems so popular.  I also had the random thought as I was smelling it throughout the day, and then while eating it, "A hint of rosemary would make this dish to DIE for."  Next time, I'll probably add that hint of rosemary, as well as use red potatoes, just for kicks.  Was definitely popular with the room mates though.

This was ok.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  The flavors were ok but nothing to get excited about.  My 3 year old son ate a huge plate of it for dinner but I wasn't crazy about it.  Not sure if I will be making this dish again.

We followed the recipe as is and it came out great, but needed a little bit of seasoning afterwards.  all in all, it tasted great and had so many vegetables that we loved it.  cooked for about 5 hrs on high and the whole apartment was full of that wonderful aroma!  next time will definitely try to cook the meat and sauté the onions first.

Easy to assemble, and the crock pot does the rest of the work for you.  Great for a busy night when you don't have time to cook.  Tastes even better the second day, so make extra for leftovers!

I am really surprised at the number of 5 star reviews. This recipe is far from special as far as beef stew goes. Don't get me wrong, it is okay, but it needs a lot of doctoring to make it special. My husband and I found it to be pretty bland as it is. If your looking for a beef stew to wow people with, this is not it.

I adjusted this recipe a little because I wanted to use less meat and more veggies, but I prepared it as written.  I don't think any changes are necessary; in fact, I used this recipe because I wanted to throw it all in the crockpot and forget it.  That said, after having it the first night, I did add more salt and pepper for the leftovers, but that's personal preference.

A very good stew. Family loved it. Next time I will omit the celery. My 7 year old wasn't a fan of the celery, but loved the rest. Will use this recipe again!

The recipe was cool but i tweeked it a bit. First what i didnt use: Worcestershire. What i did added cilantro, and garlic clove while i was browning the meat (no flour) and i added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and tsp of cayenne to even out the 2 flavors (it really and the right kick to it. I also added a small bag of green giant broccolli (a aquired taste with it) It turned out great!!!

I made this recipe and took the leftovers for my 7 month son, and pureed it with more beef broth.  It was a complete hit, one of his favorite meals!  I didn't change much, just added some tomato paste and more beef broth.  I can't even look at babyfood meat meals, so making this was great, so he gets meat in the form of actual food.

I sauted the onions in olive oil, then browned the beef after dredging with flour before adding to the crock pot. Also used chicken broth instead of beef broth. Served with a bagette and yum yum, it was delicious.

It was good, but a little bland and tasted just like a "typical stew".  It was easy to throw in the crock pot before work and was cooked well, just could have used more flavor.

Perfect as written. Even non-stew eaters when back for seconds. Unfortunately, there were no leftovers.

I have made this stew dozens of times, and it never disappoints.  It is great with venison, as well.  The only thing I add to it is a small amount of Gravy Master (for color mostly, but it does impart a little more salt) and some cornstarch at the end of the cooking time to thicken it up a bit.  Delicious!

WAY too much onion!  Garlic, bay leaves and the other spices involved can enhance the flavor of something without overwhelming it. Onions on the other hand will dominate the flavor of anything unless used sparingly.  Also the celery comes out squishy if cooked from the very beginning, and the carrots come out squishy and bitter tasting.  I would add the celery and carrots near the very end, so that thy are cooked just enough to make them palatable.

I cooked this in our slow cooker for around 14 hours.  The beef was tender, not tough at all.  A definate stick to your ribs hearty meal.  Also, it took nothing to prepare.  I had it from fridge/freezer to crockpot in around 30 minutes.  Not bad, considering having to wash and cut the veggies.

Delicious and simple. Instead of cutting up carrots, I just bought the already tiny ones and threw them in with it. Yummy. Will make again.

I had something else in my crockpot so I used my dutch over. I pretty much follow directions. I used a piece of chuck which I cut up and pounded...to insure tenderness, I also added about 1/4 of dry vermouth it adds so much flavor. Rather than chopping the onion I halved it and then cut it in the oppo directions you'd cut if you wanted rings (easier to eat and the small chop is too small for me). I vacuum sealed this for my son in college. He loved it.  I tried a small bowl and it was really flavorful, the meat tender. I added 2+ cups of beef broth.

Made this for dinner two nights ago... my family are big beef stew eaters, and we ran out of the pre-purchased seasoning packets we like, so I said I would make it from scratch with a high-rated recipe. I upped the flour to 1/3 cup as suggested, then added a little water based on one review that it was "very thick" -- it came out so thin, like a soup. My brothers were upset, but whatever. The biggest problem I had was the lack of flavor. It was so mild my youngest brother was reaching for the Old Bay before he even finished swallowing the first bite. If I made again, I'll try to double the seasonings and see if it gives it some flavor. Otherwise, the meat and veggies all came out tender - easy prep, but too mild and thin a broth for my family's taste.

Good stew! It was really easy. I just threw my favorite veggies in the pot, sliced up some italian bread and it was ready when I got home. I even used new potatoes so I didn't have to peel. I threw in baby carrots, corn, mushrooms and stewed tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe, I'll definately make this again!

I added a lot of wine and beer.  And towards the end of the 6 hrs I added tandori rice - the meat was very dry and the rice killed all the moisture - basically I killed it - I will try it again though.

Very good.  I think I may add some mushrooms next time and maybe a bit of red wine.

This is a very good recipe if you're looking for a simple and easy to prepare slow cooker beef stew! It's not very salty so just add salt, each to their own taste, and everyone's happy!

Made this exactly as described. I cooked it for four hours and then switched to low for two hours to accommodate my schedule. I did not change ingredient ratio. The result is a simple beef stew with the beef flavor kicked up a notch. This is what we like!

I made this stew and I took Corinne's suggestions into consideration.  I swapped out the wine with beer and I added 2 chicken bouillons.  It was really deliscious!  I have never made stew before and I will definitely make this again, and again, and again!

Not my favorite stew result.  I don't seem to have much luck with the crock pot.  Veggies were tender, but meat was overcooked.

I made this recipe with some changes and it came out fantastic...I used certified angus chuck roast.  I cut off all the visible fat and made into cubes.  I did take the meat and put in a bag added flour and shook to coat.  Then I browned the meat.  While that was going on, I parboiled the potatoes (not sure if that is needed)  Then I put the meat, potatoes, carrots, celery, diced onions and some frozen pearl onions, in the crockpot.  I added a package of McCormick's Stew seasoning and mixed it with 1 can of beef broth and a 1/2c of red wine.  Also added worcestershire sauce...put on the lid and went to bed.  Woke up to a phenomenal aroma...oh, I also added frozen peas and corn just now. It will be served later this afternoon.

I love this recipe.  I have made it over and over again and it is always perfect.  I needed something to put on in the morning before work and be able to dish out as soon as I got home.  This is the perfect find especially for a working mom with 2 children under 4.  Thanks.

FANTASTIC as written!  By far the best slowcooker stew I've ever made.  I only changed some of the veggies because of what I had on hand, and used 2 potatoes, 2 stalks of celery, and about 1 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms.  Amazing!  This is now my beef stew recipe for life.  I also added dumplings in the last 30 minutes - delicious!

This recipe was ok nothing special. I think it was a little runny also. The meat was very tender though. I added mushrooms, peas, and green beans. I also added some beef gravy powder to it. Was great then.

Fantastic! I used london broil for the beef and added about 2 cups of water so it wouldn't dry out while I was at work. Came home to a wonderful aroma and the beef was so tender it melted in my mouth.

LOVE this recipe. I made it exactly as written (no browning or additing anything else) and it's FAB ! I didn't have enough onion but added half and its really really great. I did add a bit more water towards the end as it did thicken up quite a bit but otherwise, perfect! Stew as Stew should be :-)

Made this recipe as is - just a regular beef stew. I was hoping it would be more flavorful with the worcestershire and breading the meat, but i wasn't impressed.

I was extremely happy with how this beef stew turned out. I basically followed the recipe exactly except I did things a little differently because I made it on the stovetop. I boiled the meat in about 6 cups of water with a little salt and pepper for about 1 1/2 hrs. first (you can put this on and watch tv while it's boiling). Once the meat was tender I took it out of the stock and let it sit for a couple of min. to dry a little. I followed the recipe and threw the meat, then flour into the pot stirred it around and threw everything else in except the potatoes and beef stock.  I ended up using about 4 cups of beef stock (from the boiled meat) and a cup or 2 of water. In the last 20 min. I put the potatoes in so that they would not be too mushy. I served it over rice and couldn't keep my family out of it. We had enough left over for another night.

I just made this today.  I had some cheap steaks that I was going to marinate and grill but the weather didn't cooperate...freezing rain yuck!  So I pulled out my trusty slow cooker and began. Cubed the steaks and followed the recipe.  Unfortunately I didn't have beef broth so I used chicken broth and added 2 beef bouillon cubes.  Otherwise followed the recipe except for a few shakes of cayenne pepper, we like it zippy.  Cooked on high for 5 hours then removed the lid for about 45 to thicken an bit more, served over egg noodles and yummy.   I plan to stir a little sour cream into the left overs and server over noodle again for a little different twist.  I think this would be good with the addition of mushrooms also, enjoy

LOVE this recipe. The crockpot is a hit at my house because its so EASY and makes the best food. I added 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar and a 1/4 teaspoon of allspice. Came out great! Will definitely make again!

I made this for my husband, son, and my parents.  It turned out TERRIFIC!  I did NOT change anything, but made extra to feed everybody (my men love their meat and potatoes!).  This was the first time I used my slow cooker and I couldn't believe what a great success it was.  I find it amusing that others commented on this recipe, but dramtically changed it.  I almost browned the meat, but decided to stick with the simplicity of this recipe.  And there were no leftovers.

I followed the recipe for the most part.  I added the flour during the last 15 minutes on HIGH and some cornstarch, came out nice and thick.  I will not use a bay leaf next time.  My family did not like the flavor of it.  Go with your taste buds with the spices you use.  Over all, a great and easy meal that taste wonderful.

This was definitely an easy stew recipe but needed a couple of additions in the end to suit my taste.  I added a splash of red wine and extra salt to taste.  I still didn't find it to be anything special and will keep looking for a stew recipe to love.

As is the recipe is just alright, but if you follow the advice of many of the reviewers it's a fantastic recipe.  I've tried making it in the slow cooker, and on the stove, and personally, I think this tastes better NOT slow cooked.

Very good basic stew. It's tastey just as the recipe goes, and leaves a lot of room for not very experienced cooks to play around with. My suggestion would be to have fun and get a bit creative with it.

This was really good.  I'm not one that jumps up and down for beef stew, but this was great!  I will make it again for the family.  I did make a few adjustments though.  I was out of beef stock, so used a package of dried beef onion soup.  I also used frozen mixed veggies, just added in the last hour or so of cooking.  Wonderful on a chilly day!

I have never made beef stew before, but my husband has been begging for it, so i tried this recipe and he absolutely loved it. Said it was the best stew he as ever had. The only thing i did different was added an extra 1/2 lb of beef, cause he likes alot of meet.

This is so easy and delicious.  I was making this to freeze and I ended up making two batches because my husband loved it so much that he ate the first batch up before I could get it to the freezer.  I look forward to thawing out batch 2 on a cold day!

The whole family liked this but wasn't wow'd.  I added 1/2 cup red wine as suggested.  I also added a bit of italian seasoning. Still didn't seem seasoned enough.  I think that 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp of worcestershire is not enough salt for 2 lbs of meat and vegetables.

i've been wanting to make a classic beef stew like my mom made when i was a kid and this recipe was perfect! i only made a few small changes: i added only 2 potatoes and 2 carrots and left out the celery. i also added 1 tsp of allspice. next time, i might go heavier on the spices, because i like lots of flavor, otherwise, the recipe comes out perfectly as written. i will definitely be making this again!

Really good as is...did not find bland at all like previous reviews.  I doubled the recipe and it worked great, but next time I would definitely not  use as much pepper.  AND...I stuck to one onion.  I think 2 would be too overpowering.

What an easy, delicious recipe!  I made it as written except instead of 3 diced potatoes I used a pound and a half of baby red potatoes rinsed and cut in half, and instead of one chopped onion I used six little boiler onions skinned and cut in half.  I also increased the broth to 2 cups (1 14.5 oz can).

This turned out great! I followed the recipe pretty closely (I like a little more vegetables) and it was well seasoned and very tasty! I don't have a slow cooker, so I cooked it for about an hour and a half on the stovetop. It was fantastic! This was my first time making beef stew, and I was very impressed with the results. I will be making this again!

We deemed this "Daddy/Hubby Appreciation Day". We chose this recipe for the main course. Everyone loved it...especially my husband! We had smoked some beef, which I cubed and used for the stew meat. I added more worcestershire sauce, and beef broth. I also added a bit of dry sherry, 1 package onion soup mix, and replaced the bay leaf with dried sweet basil. You know when your kids are saying MMMM during the whole meal, you've hit a gold mine! Thanks for sharing!

Tried this dish the other day when it was cold and rainy out.  It was wonderful to come home to dinner made and smelling wonderful!  The only thing that would make it slightly better is to let it sit for a minute before eating because it's very hot and it allows for the juice to thicken up slightly.

I love this! It used to be so time consuming to make beef stew the traditional way and this slow cooker recipe gives the same great results without all the work. I like tomatos in my stew so added a large can of chopped diced tomatos at the start of cooking...along with a little more flour to ensure a thicker gravy. An hour before serving I also added a can of peas. Delicious!

Simple & delicious. The meat is so tender it breaks apart in the stew. Great left over as well.

this was good, but not thick at all. It had more of a vegetable beef soup recipe, but all in all it was simple and pretty tasty.

I doubled the amount of beef broth because I like a little more liquid.  Other than that, it was perfect!

This was melt in your mouth delicious! Perfect for a cold day...with some french bread to soak up all the gravy. Stew meat came out so tender. The only difference I made was adding 1 packet of dry soup mix and 1 & 1/2 cups of water in place of the beef broth and added frozen peas. Didn't brown the meat first, didn't need to! Will make again for sure!

Ummmm....hmmmmm....well, growing up, I never really liked beef stew, it was bland. But I thought that it was just my mothers recipe (sorry mom). It was cold and I thought a good beef stew was in order. I found this recipe and was very excited to try it. Followed it as written. Bland. Maybe i'm just not a beef stew person, but since my husband didn't want the leftovers (true indicator of whether he liked it), i'm only giving it a 3.

This was a great stew! It was easy to put together in the slower cooker and cooked perfectly after 6-7 hours on high. We kept the ingredients in larger pieces, so if you cut them smaller, cook for 5-6 hours on high. The spices were a nice start but we thought it needed a boost so we added more Worcestershire, some cajun and a little hot sauce.  This gave it the delicious, rich flavor it needed. Also, we didn't have any bay leaves so they were left out.  I would definitely make this again- it's even better the next day!

Fabulous beef stew, I did use Corinne's suggestions (with red wine, yum!) and I will be using this as THE beef stew recipe. I had always used the McCormick packet recipe but all of the other additions really makes it company worthy! Enjoy.

This is exactly what i had in mind when I thought of making stew yesterday.  I'm not a big beef eater, so I'd never made beef stew before, but for whatever reason, I was craving it.  I followed recipe exactly, and because it was not going to be thick enough, I added about 2 teaspoons of corn meal the last few minutes.  After that, it thickend up right away.    Delicious!

Good recipe, nothing outstanding.  I was out of onion, but I did have french onion soup that I subbed for the broth (I left out the salt too since the soup was so salty).

Very tasty! The only change I made was that I added a packet of MCcormick stew seasoning because all the other slow cooker stew recipes I had tried tasted bland.  With just adding the seasoning the stew was delicious and I will continue to make it.

I thought this stew turned out really well.  I will make a few changes next time, I think, like possibly add some cornstarch so it's thicker, and make sure to cook it as long as possible so your potatoes get soft!

Very good stew. I used 1/3 cup flour, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 3/4 teaspoon pepper, 5 potatoes, 2 stalks of celery, 2 cups of beef broth. I also made a 33% less sodium brown gravy packet and added that. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I would add more salt and pepper next time.

Ok so this is a great start to a great stew. I like some of you went ahead and added my own extra's and gave it my own different little flavor. It is good without the extra's but we like it a little hot around here.

I made this stew yesterday and it came out wonderful! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but added a bit more broth, and more seasonings. My fiancee and 16 month old son gobbled it up!  I also noticed that this morning, the leftovers gained a lot of flavor from sitting in the fridge overnight! We used some of the leftovers in some scrambled eggs, with some extra sharp cheddar cheese and it was an AMAZING breakfast!

I've always made beef stew for my husband, even though I'd never eat it.  I didn't care for the taste.  However, this beef stew we shared!  I'm even looking forward to cooking again!!

I found it is best if you brown the stew meat first in seasonings then add beef stock about 3 cups. Then add rest of seasonings in broth and meat in slow cooker. My family loves this and so do i because it can cook all day and is ready when you are.Add all your veggies 60 minutes before eating.

I agree with others who've said this is a good base. I followed the recipe as written and let it cook 3 hours on high then 3 hours on low in the crock pot. I checked it and found the taste bland, it wasn't thick enough and there wasn't enough liquid. I tweaked by fixing a packet of brown gravy on the stove and adding that, along with a dash of thyme, rosemary, garlic powder and several shakes of seasoned salt. For personal preference, I added about 1 cup of fresh grean beans and a can of mushrooms too. With the changes it is very yummy and the right consistency I was looking for. The meat cooked up nice and tender (I used pre-cut stew meat).

It was a bit too bland for my taste until I "added " french onion soup mix and a 1/4 tsp bit more flour to give it flavor. I threw in some canned corn too...Kids loved it.

I made this using some of the suggestions in the reviews. A bit more flour, a bit more worchestshire sauce. I browned the onions first, then removed those and browned the floury beef, deglazed the pan with the broth.   Overall, VERY yummy! I tasted it early on and was concerned about how salty it was, but that faded after cooking for six hours. Still somewhat salty for us though, we don't use much salt usually so maybe we're more sensitive to it. I'll reduce the salt next time.   Also, I made dumplings and cooked them on the stove using some of the liquid from the pot. So there wasn't enough liquid left in the end, next time I might add a bit more water if dumplings are in the plan.  Overall though, VERY yummy! Very flavourful and tasty. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!   Z

This was a great beef stew but yes add more worcestershire sauce to sirloin after you braise it and add garlic, beef broth, wine, onion and beef stew seasoning. I simmered beef with a little corn starch for about 1/2 hour till thick.  Then put potatoes and carrots in the crock pot with the meat.  I added peas and muchrooms at the last just to heat.  Make or buy home made bread of any flavor to go with yum.

My boyfriend was able to make this (he only had to call me twice, bless him) and it turned out really great. Would be 5 stars, but we found the seasoning a bit bland and had to add some after we started to eat. Really yummy.

This seems like it would be a good starting point for a beef stew, but it is very bland on its own. Next time I will follow Corinne's suggestions and see if it turns out better.

Excellent.  I made this as written, except that I did leave out the celery (didn't have any) and just eye-balled the amount of potatoes and carrots until it looked right.  I will make this again.

I loved this recipe. I didn't have onions, so I omitted them. I added a can of potatoes and carrots(both drained) in the last hour of cooking. It was delicious. Even my picky roommate loved it. I served it over white rice. Leftovers are delicious, too.

We thought this was really good--the meat was soo tender.  The only change I made was to brown the stew meat in oil (seasoned w/salt and pepper) first.  And I didn't have any celery or carrots.  I served with corn on the cobb and biscuits.

Fantastic just the way it is...although the 2nd time I did make a few alterations:  Cut the meat back to 1 pound Add: 1 extra potato 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 1/4 tsp rosemary 1/4 tsp tyme 1/2 tsp parsley increase Worchestershire sauce to 1 Tbsp  Did not brown the meat, but did shake the beef and flour in a ziploc bag rather than mix in the slow cooker. Will defnitely make again!

I loved it. All I did different was add a bit of green onions, a packet of mushroom gravy mix, and some beef seasoning. I really enjoyed it with Texas toast and then I tried it with Velveeta Shells and Cheese. Yummy!

I loved this recipe.  It was so simple.  I was asked to make beef stew for a backpacking trip, and this was the easiest recipe on here.  It's absolutely delicious.  I added cornstarch to thicken it up, and cooked the potatoes seperately (a double batch barely fit into my crockpot), and added them before serving so they didn't fall apart.  Delicious, thanks so much for the recipe!!

I made this with pork as I have a beef sensitivity. It turned out quite well, just a little too liquid-y and not incredibly flavorful. I'll have to add some other spices next time. Great basic recipe.

I was not overly impressed with this. It turned out very very thick. There was more meat than anything else. It wasn't proportioned very well. I probably won't make this ever again.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. I have a recipe that is my favorite, which I found on a bloggy friends site...but I couldn't get it to load, so I found this one to use instead. It was not good. I don't know if it was the spices or what, but this was basically a glorified potato soup. I will not make this again!

We thought this recipes was very bland and had little flavor.  After 9 hours on low my beef had turned to mush also.  There was not enough juice in my opinion either.  I like a soupy type stew.  I may try again to make with alot of modifications.

This recipe was OK in my opinion. There wasn't anything exceptional about it.  I pretty much followed the recipe except that I didn't have any celery. I did brown the beef beforehand like some reviewers suggested, but I thought that this stew was still kind of bland.

I have made this many times for large groups (30) and small (4) - I'm a very busy working gal and I follow the recipe exactly - can't be bothered with browning, etc.  Everyone always loves it!  I usually buy a loaf of fresh bread to accompany.  Thank you!

This was my first time making stew, and it turned out great.  My family loved it.  Even my husband, who is an extremely picky eater and hates stew, loved it.  The only change I made was to add some minced garlic!

I made the stew exactly how it was written in the recipe.  This is definitely quite edible but alas, I feel like there was a lot of wasted potential.  There is nowhere near enough salt in the recipe.  The stew was just bland in flavor.  However, I do think this recipe provides a nice base to work from.  I will make this again but will certainly need to add to the recipe.

This stew was pretty good but I just feel it needed a little extra something. A bit more flavor/seasonings. Its a good base recipe that needs some adding onto. Update: Made this recipe again and just added a packet of onion soup mix. Definitely added some goodness to this recipe! Also added an extra clove of garlic and used a 14.5 oz can of broth instead of 1.5 cups. So good. With the onion soup mix though I think it thickened it too much so will add extra liquid next time.

This was pretty good.  The beef turned out really tender and the soup part had a good taste.  I would have liked it to be a little bit thicker though.

VERY easy, but not extremely flavorful. We needed to use alot of salt when serving. Next time I will add some crushed red pepper or maybe some beef boullion to give it a kick.

I made this with pre-cut stew meat from the grocery store, two beef boullion cubes (with 1.5 cups water for the broth), mini-carrots, frozen chopped onion, and some leftover boiled red potatoes (I added them right at the end).  I like this recipe b/c I like the saucey/soupy stuff that is GREAT to sop up with homemade rolls!  Mmm!

I followed this recipe almost exactly as written. The one change I made was to use water instead of beef broth in order to control the sodium content. For this reason, it needed a little extra salt at the end, but was otherwise quite toothsome. My husband was very pleased.

This recipe turned out really good.  It was super simple.  I added mushrooms, thyme and parsley, but otherwise kept it pretty much the same.  As far as stews go, this was very tasty.

This is the best beef stew I've tasted.  I followed the recipe, except used beef broth in place of the water.  The taste is perfect and I love it did not have heavy soup as an ingredient, so the sodium was low.  Adding the flour is perfect to thicken up the sauce. My whole family love this one!

This stew was pretty good and I really liked the simplicity of it.  My house smelled wonderful when I got home!  I made it as the recipe states with the exception of the celery (because by the time I got to that part I realized I didn't have any).  I would have changed, as one other reviewer recommended, the regular salt to seasoning salt.  The only thing I was dissapointed in is the "gravy".  I guess I was expecting more of an actual gravy like consistency.  And I didn't cook it for any longer than 8 hours because by that time the meat was ready to fall apart.

I added 4 oz sliced mushrooms and substituted the worcestershire sauce with 1/4 C red wine, as we don't care for worcestershire sauce. I also didn't have an onion, so I just used onion powder. My husband said it was the best he's ever had - he's not EASY either! A keeper and one to share!

I have the same recipe I got from a slow cooker cookbook. It is exactly the same expect for my recipe called for 1/2 garlic clove istead of a full one and 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of salt intead of 1/2 teaspoon. This recipe I use is perfect and I can't see it to be tasting much different from this one. It's a easy recipe with fantastic results. The best beef stew.

Perfect after a cold day.  Here's my mods: decreased meat to 1 pkg (1.34 lbs), increased potatoes to 5 small, increased carrots to 6, increased celery to 2 stalks, used 1 can (12 oz) of beef broth.  Mine turned out very thick and hearty.  If you like yours more like a soup I'd recommend an extra can of broth.  Served mine with a few dashes of Tabasco.  Yum!

My Grandmother passed away before I could get her delicious beef stew recipe.  This was so close to hers, it almost made me cry.  Delicious!  The only thing I did differently was add cornstarch close to the end to thicken it a little and make it even more like hers.

This was amazing.  My friends were wowed by it.  My only issue was that I thought it was a bit bland, but that may have been because I used low sodium beef broth.  So, I seasoned it up a bit more and it was a smash hit!  Also, I didn't add the potatoes. I cooked wide egg noodles separately and added them at the last minute instead.

This was great! I made it twice in 24 hours - once for us, and once for friends of ours. The second time, I added about 1/2 a cup of water to help cut down on the sodium and make it a little less thick. That seemed to help quite a bit.

Now this is the right way to cook stew!! This is exactly the way I make it except I add a can of corn. It seems, from reading the different recipes, that people have different ideas of what stew is supposed to taste like. And this recipes is my idea of how it should taste. You can also use a litte Kitchen Bouquet. I always cook a big ol pan of cornbread to go with it (but I think thats just a southern thing since my yankee husband doesnt prefer it. He would rather have crackers.) GREAT RECIPE!! THANKS!!

This is the only stew I will make from now on.  I don't like celery so I skipped it and didn't use a bay leaf (didn't have one).  Meant to put green beans in, just for color, but forgot to pick them up.  Got the potatoes, carrots and onion ready the night before, got up in the morning, threw everything in the crock pot and that night, awesome stew!  I can hardly wait to have it again!  Thanks!  Kim

This is an excellent stew recipe.  I followed most of Corinne's modifications, except I added more broth--essentially the entire 15 oz can--plus a generous splash of cabernet sauvignon.  I did that because I don't like a really thick stew.  It turned out perfectly.  It is so good.  If I wasn't so full right now, I'd have more.  I will definitely make this again with the same changes.

Five stars with additions, four as     is. I added a can of vegetable broth and a packet of lipton onion soup mix. No need to brown meat in pan before     adding to crockpot. Thanks for a great base recipe.

Fabulous flavor and extremely easy to make! My 5 yr old son and husband both loved this stew. I did make a few changes based on flavor preferences. I added peas and my son does not like celery so I omitted that.I also served the stew over mashed potatoes so I didn't add potatoes to the pot. Excellent and will make again and again (by request).

This was a great starter recipe for me. I needed something to set me on the way to making great beef stew and this was it. I added some red wine, thyme, whole garlic cloves, and some turmeric for color. I also did what someone else said and added some flour to make it a little thicker. It came out amazing and I served it in a sourdough bread bowl, with muenster cheese slices on the side to make it look perfect!! thank you for the starter recipe i will make this again and again.

good not great, I feel like it was missing something although I don't know quite what that was, an herb perhaps but I can't put my finger on it.  the cooking method is ideal for stew though, the beef was perfectly tender, I used one and two thirds pounds of stew meat.  it was a little too much, if I experiment again, I'd use only 1 lb.  worth a try, I'd use it as a starting point next time.

We loved this!  I left out the potatoes and served over egg noodles; also, added a teaspoon of flour towards the end of cooking to thicken. I also added some steak sauce I had on hand (a relatively sweet one)

I made this for my family exactly as the recipe said and they loved it!

Everything came out perfectly cooked, and although I couldn't taste it (I'm vegetarian) the other 9 people in my family kept commenting on how good it was! This is a first because usually at least 1 or 2 of the picker ones complain. The slow cooker helped a lot too.

Thanks!

Great recipe overall, though needs a little kick. Next time I will try more black pepper, or perhaps some chili. I made it by the recipe, but added frozen green beans an hour before it was finished. I prefer to have something green in it too.

This recipe wasn't what I expected.  My slow cooker cooks very very fast, so normally I estimate about 1/2 the cook time of the recipe.  I ended up cooking this stew forever and the vegetables never did get cooked all the way through.  The meat, however, overcooked and became very dry.  The broth was thin - not what I would expect from a stew.  The stew tasted okay, but I wouldn't make this again.

the meat and veges came out perfect, but not much flavor...I agree with one reviewer that it is a good base recipe to add some of your own spices to...i served with rice, which worked nicely and doubled the boullion and water for more sauce

I have never had my family rave so much about a meal than this one!!! It was fantastic!!! I changed a few things. Instead of paprika, pepper, & onion, I used a package of onion soup mix. and instead of stew meat, I used left over prime rib (chunked up) and only cooked it in the crockpot for about 4-5 hours. Fabulous and easy!!!  I will definately make this again!

VERY good and VERY easy! I only gave it 4 stars because as good as it was, it could have used a little more flavor. I'm making it again tonight, but this time I'm going to add a stew seasoning packet to it. ** Made it last night and added a stew seasoning packet ~ FANTASTIC!!!!!

A great recipe although I made some changes - I added basil and oregano, used two bay leaves, used more Worcestershire sauce, and added some red wine. Excellent over sticky rice!

I made this recipe as written and I'm giving it four stars. This is a very good base recipe but kinda bland for my taste. Definitely add what you think would made this stew better and the other reviewer's recommendations are great!

Very good and flavorful beef stew.  I did brown my meat like suggested and had it great flavor.  I also deglazed the pan with red wine and it gave the stew a really great flavor.

Yummy! This was the perfect meal on those raining days like today. I only added 1/4 cup of red wine and omitted the mushrooms since my husband hates them. Also, I recommend that you fry the floured beef before adding the vegetables and broth. Other than that, I did not stray too much from the recipe.

I was very impressed with this stew.  So quick and easy.  The meat was very tender, no need to brown on the stove.  I added a tin of stewed tomatoes and thickened it with corn starch.  This will be a regular meal in our home for sure.

For my first review, I'm sorry I couldn't give this recipe a higher score.  Like many others, I found it to be lacking in flavor as written.  Also, on low, it only needs about 9 hours to cook through.  It is however, a good base recipe to add your own touch to.  Will keep it on file and spice it up a bit next time.

This stew was very flavorful. I did follow a few recommendations from other reviewers. I added 1/2 cup of red wine, increased the worcestershire to 1 tablespoon, and added a package of McCormick beef stew seasoning. I had also planned on cooking the beef first to seal it, but ended up not having time. It didn't need it. It tasted great and I loved the simplicity. I left out the potatoes and served it over mashed. Delicious! The stew is very thick.

on its own, perhaps could use a little kick, but the recipe is solid and reliable. I followed as directed but at different times have also added a 1/4 red wine, a couple of potatoes, adjusted spices and still comes out great. fast to throw together b/c you dont have to brown the beef and it's great every time!

I wasn't too impressed. The meat was very tender, but the "gravy" was greasy and there wasn't much flavor. I think in the future I'll just stick to doing a Pot Roast in the slow-cooker and then making my own stew on the stovetop with the leftovers. Maybe I'll try it with browning the meat first and adding herbs. I do love how easy the recipe is.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. After reading other reviews, I added an envelope of brown gravy mix to the flour (did not have beef). I also had to omit the onions and celery due to a picky eater. My husband proclaimed this recipe better than the other stew I often make : Baked Beef Stew.

This was absolutely delicious, just like the beef stew my Mom used to make. I did make a few adjustments....I added about a half a tsp. more of the paprika. Halway through, I added an additional tsp. of salt and an additonal tsp of minced garlic( I tasted it and thought it needed it.)I also added fresh string beans about an hour before it was ready. I cooked on high for 6 hours. The beef was tender and the vegetables perfect! This is a wonderful meal. Thank you so much for this recipe. I looked at other beef stew recipes and finally chose this one to try. I'm glad I did!

I made this recipe with only a few modifications: I used a little over 1lb of meat and it was still plenty! I also added the beef stew seasoning packet and browned the meat just a bit before adding it to the mix. It had great flavor, but was a little too thick. If I make it again, I'll add more broth and probably water too.

The taste of this dish was 3-3.5 stars, but it looked like a gross 1 star dish.  I accidentally poured the broth in before the dry ingredients/spices so maybe the flour made the broth thicken, but when I came home my apt smelled delicious, but looked AWFUL.  Anyways, I followed the recipe exactly except I also added a pack of Mccormick beef stew seasoning.  And while this was a really easy dish, I'm not sure if it tastes that much better than the recipe on the back of the Mccormick seasoning package.

just okay in my book.  I know when I am salivating for something and Im disappointed...its has not worked out.  I do think I added too many onions- never thinking it could hurt the flavor.  Also, I used seasoning salt on the meat as well as the "beef stew packet" that many stated added great flavor-but both must have too much.  I will say that it was soooo easy and may try again following directions......

Flavour of stew was great.  It did need more broth than called for though and I did brown the meat and lightly browned the veggies.  I will be making this again.
Thanks

Very flavorful and easy to make stew.  I would've given 5 stars but I felt that it needed to be thickened in the end and this wasn't mentioned in the original recipe.  I'll definately make again.

I think this is an awesome recipe, I did use Corinne's recommendations also. I served with Sheepherder's bread. I cooked it a little longer then called for but that did not hurt it at all. I will do this a few more times this winter.

My first beef stew and it came out great! I took most of Corinne's advice; I browned the beef first,  and added Beef Stew seasoning packet. It was slightly more labor intensive than I thought a slow cooker meal should be but the result was some incredibly tasty stew. I will probably try not browning the beef next time. If it comes out just as good, I will change my rating to 5 stars!

This was a great recipe with the modifications.  I followed what others said and added the red wine.  Next time I will not brown the meat as it did dry it out a bit.  Overall very tasty.

Loved this recipe! I added about 1/4 cup of water to make it saucier and 1/4 cup of red wine for more flavor...not that it needed it, I'm just a fan of the wine flavor.  Thanks, this is a keeper!

I just served this recipe in the Italian Bread Bowls from this site. It was well received, and I think will become my go-to Stew recipe. My only change might be a bit more salt. I usually do not like a lot of salt, but it definitely needed more. That's the only reason for the 4 stars. And I put in the potatoes much later in the cooking process with the Crock Pot.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  It's very easy to throw together and I love that you don't have to brown the meat first!  I omitted the bay leaf, paprika, and celery and added a package of dry onion soup mix (just personal preference).  Also added a can of peas at the very end.  We had this with some freshly baked biscuits and it was a wonderful meal, very yummy!

This was a very good pot of stew...well, crock of stew!  I actually didn't make any changes (I didn't?)...well, except adding more garlic, but I ALWAYS add more garlic, so I don't really consider it a change!  Could have been a little thicker, but I could have easily remedied that...I was just lazy tonight!  Good stew!

I added a lot more veggies, which means I should have increased the spices, but I didn't.  So after it was all done cooking I added a packet of onoin soup mix.  That made a world of difference!

I ask the family to rate without judgement to me, because it's not my recipe. Our 3 stars are a combined rating of our family. The 12-year-old girl said too much meat, the 16-year-old was not impressed.  My husband rated it a 4 and me a 3.5.  I like my beef stew with tomatoe paste and I thought my family wouldn't like that as much as I do. I did have to thicken this up.

This recipe was sooo good.  I used Corinne's recipe.  The only change was add garlic powder to the flour with the pepper and seasoned salt.  My extremely picky family loved it!!! I will add this recipe to my collection.

I added a bit of rosemary and thyme and followed Corinne's suggestions exactly; it was delicious. The meat was tender and wonderful. My boyfriend and I loved it.

Since almost everyone is following Corinne's modification, someone should re-write this recipe. It's excellent.

This was a very good, very simple crockpot meal.  It took me all of 5 minutes to throw together in the crockpot, and dinner was ready when I got home.  I added frozen peas and a little more cornstarch to thicken it up about 10 minutes before serving.  This is a working mother's best friend!

Made this for my husband. I am not a huge stew fan. I actually made this thicker for him by adding more flour. I took suggestions on precooking meat and adding McCormicks Seasoning. Skipped the wine idea though. He loved it so I am giving it 4 stars.

This was great my man likes alot of meat and potatoes so I put in aprox 8-10 red potatoes and 3/4 bag of mini carrots. I did put 2 full cans of beef broth in and for extra flavor added a lipton onion packet. Turned out great will make again
I could have done without the bay leaf though

This stew was very yummy and satisfying. I did add more broth than suggested, but I may have added more potatoes too. I just like it brothier, I guess. Very good, even the next day for lunch.

This is a great recipe. First I marinated the meat in Worcestire sauce for a few hours, and I browned the meat. Instead of fresh veggies, I used McKenzies frozen stew vegetables,1/2 cup of red wine, fresh parsley and cooked it on high for 4 hours. It came out delicious!!

I love this recipe for 2 reasons.  First, it tastes awesome.  Hearty and flavorful.  The second reason is that it is so simple!  Mix a few things in the very pot I am cooking in and I only have one thing to wash after dinner!  What more could I ask for.  I did however, double the broth and spices because we like more broth to dip our bread in.  Other than that, this recipe was just perfect!

tastes great and it's easy! it was my first time cooking in my slow cooker and it came out perfect. the second time i tried it i substituted some broth for red wine, but it actually didn't taste as good as the original. the only i'd do differently is add a bit more ground pepper. Yummy!

Will make again, soon.

Tips: Choose an extremely lean mean.  I bought some pre-cut "beef stew" meat, as it was labeled, and it had a lot of marbling.  When the stew was ready, there was a big layer of grease on top that I had to scoop away once the stew was cooled in the fridge.  Once the oil/fat was gone though, this stew went really well with a dash of Bob's Habanero Hot Sauce.

This was fantastic. I made two changes: cut white potato amount in half and added sweet potatoes, added mushrooms. Boyfriend ate it for days. One suggestion would be to add some more pepper or something to spice it up a bit more. Goes well with brown rice or whole-wheat noodles. Yummy. :)

Good Stew! The only change is I add an extra clove of garlic, since we like garlic, added onions and I brown the stew meat in a skillet w/1 tbsp oil before putting in the crock!

Yummy!!! 
I just doubled the recipe and added garlic powder to the s&p w/flour.  This was so fragrant I opened the garage and smelled it as I pulled in from a long cold day.  Perfect ending.  Hearty and Healthy.  Thanks so much for a wonderful addition.

VERY GOOD!  Browned meat and deglazed with red wine like the others. I usually am too impatient to let it cook on low 10-12 hours, but this time I did it and am amazed at the difference.  Meat is very tender and everything came out beautifully. Will make this again.

Wonderful recipe...simmered on top of the stove for 4 hrs.  Used Herb de Provence (available in any grocery store) and of course a little bit of red wine.  What a treat...the house smelled so welcoming.

Really, really good & easy!  I brown the stew meat first and it was so tender.  The only think I didn't do was add the celery.  I served with warm bread.  My husband loved it.  It was even better the next day for left overs!

I followed this recipe as it was originally written and it was wonderful. I chopped all the veggies the night before and spent 10 min throwing everything into the slow cooker before work the next morning.  It was nice to come home to a wonderful smelling home that evening.

Followed recipe exactly except did not have any celery so I replaced it with a green pepper.  This was real good and easy to make.  Will be making this stew again.

this is a good basic stew recipe. I add stew seasoning packet, and use baby carrots instead, 1 clove of garlic. the rest is season to taste as everyones taste differs. great with crusty loaf of fresh bread.

This was excellent. I followed recipe exactly except for substituting the celery with a box of peas towards the end of cooking.  I will make this again, I was delighted that the meat came out just as good as when browned on the stove prior to stewing!

I never have had any success making a stew. Every recipe that I had tried the meat would be tough, the flavor just wasn't there, it just wasn't right. My friend sent this to me, and right away my family loved it, asked for me to make it over and over. I have finally found a recipe that is not only delicious, but also easy to make. And importantly, a repeat meal! Thank you!

Everyone loved this stew. I thought it needed a tad more salt and pepper... Also, I didn't have celery, so I just left it out.

This is my hubby's new favorite recipe!!  I followed Corinne's recipe to a tee.  The only thing I added was a package of whole button mushrooms and red potatoes instead of regular potatoes.  I have made this recipe twice in the past two weeks.  It is one I will make again and again!!  Great recipe!

This was the best stew I have ever made!  I changed it a little.  I added 1 packet of stew seasoning, left out the bay leaf and paprika, and used minced garlic in the jar instead of a clove.  I also added several more potatoes.

I followed the recipe (I did add a little extra broth, but other than that I followed it to the dot) and it turned out fabulous. Everything was perfect! The vegetables were just right and the seasoning was great. I will definitely be making this again and again!

My  husband and i made this for dinner tonight, we used the 12+ hour cook time.  The meat and vegetables were VERY tender and Excellent!!! Although the recipe does need some spicing up... we used about a cup more beef broth, 1/3 cup flour, 2 tbs of garlic, and 2 bay leaves... While it was a little bland it is a very good recipe to work with!!!

Add your own spices!  About an hour before the stew was finished I tasted it and realized it was pretty bland.  I added extra spices (garlic, steak spice) and it turned out great. My husband finished the whole batch in one night.

I made this recipe exactly as stated because I wanted to see if it would turn out to be a tastey alternative to browning the meat and than adding the ingrediants (if I'm going to that I'll do it in the dutch oven what is the point of dirting up another pan?)  I thought this was very good and easy.  It made servings for 4 people with a little bit of leftovers.  I only used 2 potatos because mine were large and I added another carrot because it is an approved veggie for my kids.  I'll have to remember this one for those busy days.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Good recipe.

I used 4/5 of the beef recommended, and added about 3 cloves of garlic, zucchini, red bell pepper, mushrooms and cauliflower.  I also threw in a tin of diced tomatoes and substituded half a cup of water for some merlot.

It turned out great, the vegetables were perfect and the meat was near falling apart. I cooked it on high for about 5 hours. I did find I needed to add alot more pepper than suggested.

My husband and I enjoyed this stew. I made it according to Corine's suggestions, but had no wine at the time, so left that out. I couldn't find any reviews that said how long it was actually cooked. I cooked mine on high for 5 1/2 hours. I also put the vegetables on the bottom from a suggestion on another website that veggies always take longer. The only problem I had was that I could have added more liquid. I used 1 can beef stock. Next time I think I would add 1/2 cup water or maybe the wine would do it...

Quite bland as written. Maybe I'll try again with some changes. Family didn't care for it at all.
Update 2/8/2012.  4.5 stars Started making this before realizing I made it before so took a quick look at reviews. First shake the stew meat in seasoned flour (pepper, garlic powder, onion powder) and sautee in olive oil until browned on all sides, remove to crockpot, then sautee onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Next deglaze the pan with 1 can beef broth (14.5 oz) and 1 cup of red wine. Let reduce a little then add a couple of dashes worcesthire, onion soup mix. Add to the crockpot with 2 bay leaves, quartered potatoes and carrots. I cooked mine on high for 5 hours, adding peas 1 hour before done. It was delicious.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe for beef stew. I did have a few changes due to lack of ingredients. I didn't have any bay leaves (or just couldn't find them), but I added dried thyme to it. I used frozen carrots and definitely suggest using fresh if you put them in at the beginning.

This stew turned out excellent my husband loved it too.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I added more broth because my large crock-pot seems to dry out if I don't.  Also at the last 30 minutes of cooking time I added some thawed frozen green beans, one small can of tomato sauce and extra (1/4 cup)flour to thicken it.  I left the lid half off and cooked it on high for 30 minutes.

Together with Corrine's suggestions this is a great recipe. The only change I would make is reduce the pepper since the seasoning packet has some also.  I have never made beef stew before and the end result was exactly what I wanted. Plus I liked that it used real ingridients and not cream of something soup, et.  I did end up adding a little more beef stock too because we like a lot of sauce.

I thought this was very good but the kids only thought it was okay and they said that they prefer other beef stew recipes from this site.  My only change was to add some peas.

Without a doubt this rates 5 stars.  I did add two cans of beef broth and 2 bay leaves.  This is the second time making it and will make it many more times.
Thank you!

My family loved this and inhaled it.  In my book, that's a success! 
Prep took a lot of time, but the end result was worth it.  Will make again.

Absolutely spectacular recipe. My husband and I both really enjoyed this! 
I did do a couple of things differently, however! Instead of just beef broth, I used condensed beef broth and then refilled the can, once with water and once with half water half red wine. I also added several sprigs of fresh rosemary and an extra bay leaf, and used a McCormicks Slow Cooker Beef Stew packet. I added extra celery and carrots, and used baby red potatoes. It was AMAZING.

Amazing.  I added 2 cups water for more of that gravy-soupy goodness.  I also used fingerling potatoes once and regular another time and they're both great.

Great!! I followed this recipe, mostly - I added some x-tra veggie (cuz I love them) so I had to up the liquids a little but it turned out great, no browning or de-glazing needed. I did find the 1 gal bag w/the flour shake suggestion helpful. Will add to my fall/winter favorites.

We all enjoyed this very much.  However, next time I think I will cut back a little on the pepper or paprika.  However, it's because we don't like anything hot to the taste.  Will be making this again.

This turned out good and meat was pretty tender but really I was sad that it seemed to lack alot of flavor. Next timed will experament with some more seasonings. But I will say that this smelled AMAZING when I walking through the door after work. :)

Good, but not exceptional. Used Yukon Gold potatoes and added a cup of frozen peas the last hour or so. I increased the spices - two bay leaves, an extra clove of garlic, and upped the worcestershire to 1 T. Still, it needed more flavor somehow. A good meal, but I'll keep looking.

Anytime a recipe has my family and I going back for seconds (and thirds), most defintely deserves a five star rating.
This is really great beef stew. No need for all the changes...made this exactly as the recipe calls for.

I followed the recipe to the "T" and it came out pretty bland.  I was kind of disappointed because I was looking for a good comfort food of beef stew.  I had to doctor it up with sage and thyme at the end because it didn't have enough flavor.

Big hit with the entire family, young and old! Served with warm rosemary artisan bread, it made an awesome dinner and was even better as leftovers during the next few days. So. Freakin. Good.

This is very good beef stew, exactly the consistency I was looking for (other beef stews are too watery at times for me).  I was concerned that it did not have enough liquid to cook for 10 hours in the crockpot but it turned out wonderfully!  I do think that next time I will add more spices than the original recipe calls for -- I added salt and pepper before serving but I think next time I will add garlic salt or an additional clove of garlic and some more Worchestshire sauce as well.

This is simply a fabulous beef stew recipe.  I made it one time incorporating Corinne's revisions, and a second time, exactly as written.  I have to say I liked both versions, but I preferred the original recipe submitted by the author more, because it goes together more quickly and you don't have to get another pan dirty.  After all, slow-cooker meals are supposed to be timesavers!  Thanks, Buchko, for a delicious and very easy stew recipe!

I thought the taste was just o-k at best.  Whenever I make these types of stews in my crock pot, either the onion or garlic tastes foul to me.  However, my family loved it.  The same day (so I could do a side by side test) I also made the Beef Stew VI and found it to be wonderful!

This was great just as written.  The only change I made was to put in whole, unpeeled baby red potatoes instead of chopped russet potatoes (one less thing to chop!).  This turned out delicious, was easy and quick to prepare, and my kids loved it!

Excellent recipe - thank you so much Nancy for sharing this with the world.  It is the best - I did use Corinne's suggestions - plus added a small (orange size) turnip.  Perfect meal for an autumn day - relaxing and just taking in the aroma, sitting by the fireplace reading a good book.  An . . . this is indeed the life!

This stew was OK to me.  I followed some of the reviewer's recommendations, but probably shouldn't have.  I thought it had a "canned" taste.  I could not get over that odd taste like it wasn't homemade or had too much of something in it that I can't put my finger on. It was a little too salty too. Maybe it was the seasoning packet I used.  I will try this recipe again without that.  I still like my homemade recipe better, but I'm always trying new things to see if I can improve on my recipe!  I would not use the Beef Stew Seasoning packet like someone recommended.  I think that was the weird taste. Otherwise I would follow the other recommendations.

I swear I have reviewed this recipe before.....could my review have been deleted?  I guess I won't give a brand name this time.  :)  This is a really good recipe - add 1/2 cup red wine and a package of Beef Stew Seasoning mix and you have yourself a masterpiece.

I made all the changes suggested by Corinne and added a little rosemary. The only thing I will do different next time is add more carrots and some more celery. But this turned out really amazing and flavorful!!

This was so easy and for me that's always a big plus.  Had never made beef stew before or used my slow cooker (late blooming cook) but made this for my brother's visit and he loved it.  I also made revisions: 1)Used 1 can (14 oz.) of beef broth and 2)added 1/2 cup of red cooking wine.  Will definitely make it again.

Great tasting stew. I tripled the amount of broth and added a few more potatoes and small turnip to feed family of 4. Will make this again.

I only needed to make enough for two people, but saw that others said that there wasn't enough sauce/gravy, so here's what I did: I only used 1 lb of beef, 2 small potatoes, 2 carrots and 1 stalk of celery.  However, I kept the same amount of everything else that the recipe mentions except I doubled the amount of paprika, garlic, Worchester and used a whole can of beef broth (around 2.5 cups).  End result? Plenty of sauce and pretty tasty.  My husband really liked it, but I thought it could have used a little more spices - hence the 4 stars.  I didn't bother to brown the meat either - just threw everything in the crock pot and let it go for 11 hours.  This was super-easy and pretty good!

This recipe turned out fantastic, I let it cook in the slow cooker all day long and it was excellent, the meat was so tender. The only thing I did differently was add more beef broth (about a cup more) when I put in the 2 cups ask for in the recipe it didn't seem like the that was enough. Other than that I made the recipe exactly as it was. It was great beef stew, will definately make again.

Would be five except I followed Corinne's recommendations (look for her review!!).  Cooked beef, then added onions and garlic to saute, then deglazed with one tablespoon W. sauce, 1/2 cup red wine (just cheap box wine), and beef broth.  Smelled amazing and tasted great.  Served in bread bowls also off this site.

ok so I must confess that I totally went dumb when I was was reading this recipe.  I used the recomedations of other reviews and added 1/2 cup red wine to the recipe.  But My mistake was that I thought is said red wine vinegar so thats what I used.  I was totally stressed about it all day.  Dinner time came and I was pleasantly surprised that It had a woderful tangy flavor.  Next time I'll try the red wine but I was very happy with the way this turned out and will probably make it this way again as well.

This was a very good stew, the only thing I did was I only added 1 pound of beef because that was all I had. It still turned out great! I only gave it 4 out of 5 because I'm not a beef fan, but everyone else loved it!

This is a great beef stew recipe!  However, I did make a couple of changes.  I think it tasted better when I browned the beef cubes before adding them to the pot.  I also almost doubled the amount of broth and when it was done the consistency was perfect.  I will make this recipe again.

Good solid stew with great flavor.  I did double some the seasoning (garlic/worshester sause).  I would use a little less salt.  I used a poor cut of beef and it tasted very good. My family said I need to double the recipe next time.

This recipe was very easy to prepare and make.  I needed a good recipe to get rid of the london broil that had been sitting in our freezer.  I didn't want to broil it so this recipe was a really good way to cook cheaper cuts of meat while still making it flavorful and delicious.  I have made this recipe twice now and both times it turned out perfectly.  It's a very warm comfort food. I will definitely cook this again.

This was fantastic!  We ate it all up in less than one day, it was so good!  I made the "corinne" changes except I didn't use the red wine, plus I blended my own seasoning to it.  It turned out great.  Thanks, I'll be making this again and again.

I liked this stew because of it's simplicity, nothing fancy just good old fashioned beef stew. I did brown the meat first and used more worchestchire sauce, but other than that followed the recipe. This is a keeper.

One glance at the ingredient list will let you know that this recipe is simple and easy.  One taste and you'll know it's good!  I followed recipe exactly.....but had to omit the celery, only because I didn't have any on hand.  If you're looking for a solid basic beef stew recipe for the crock-pot this is it -- nothing jazzy, but it's GOOD.

This was great, but since I played with the recipe to get a better flavour, I'm only giving it 4 stars. I added a sachet of lipton dry onion soup, and increased the amount of broth. I used 3 garlic cloves and thickened it at the end using some beef gravy granules (bisto).  My husband loved it, and it was an excellent and easy recipe, I loved that you didn't need to brown the beef. The beef was still delicious and tender.

Excellent!  I have made this several times also.  Once in a while I add extra garlic because we love it.  I've made this today and had some other veggies I had some turnip and cabbage to use up so I threw that in too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Like previous posters have commented, thank you Corinne for a wonderful adaptation of this recipe.  Both my husband and I loved this and will probably make it again.  However, my children were not big fans. . .maybe the color?  Who knows?!!?

made this with corrine's suggestions and thought it was great but way too peppery.  I also used more potatoes, carrots and added green beans.  Thought it would be perfect if I did not use so much black pepper.

This was a good recipe.  I did however, brown the stew meat before putting it in the crockpot.  Other than that, this is the only change I made.  The meat turned out really tender with a good overall flavor.  Thank you.

This was a fantastic stew!  I will say that you might want to think about adding a little salt or garlic seasoning for a little added flavor, but otherwise, it was fantastic.  A great, old fashioned stew.

Good, hubby thought meat was too tough. I was disappointed after smelling it all day, and it tasted rather bland. Sorry, but I will keep looking. :-(

Really awesome recipe!  I actually used Corrine's "tweaked" version - she was your most recent reviewer and I have to say - RIGHT ON THE MONEY!!!  This was so good.  I got nothing but rave reviews from my family.  Thank you for a terrific recipe!!

Took the advice of Corinne and my husband LOVED it! He even said that it blew his mother's out of the water and that she needed to try this! Next time I think I may cut down on the beef stock and red wine, though...then again, i didnt use as much beef as it called for, but I used a lot more potatos and carrots...will probably end up making it over and over again!

This was very, very good.  I made minor changes, such as adding the McCormick Beef Stew seasoning, more potatoes, and a little more garlic.  It was so delicious.  Perfect for a chilly day.

Excellent stew, a success with guests. I made modifications as follows:  I browned the beef as suggested by the previous reviewer, and deglazed the pan with a can of low sodium beef broth and about half a cup of dark beer.  I added more garlic and Worcestershire sauce than in the original recipe.  For veggies, I used three large potatoes, three large carrots, a large parsnip, four smallish turnips, and about half an acorn squash.  I cooked it for about six hours on high.  Near the end of the cooking time, I threw in, on a whim, about 1/3 of a jar of cornichons (chopped up) and pickled onions.  The pickles lost their flavor, but the onions added a nice touch.  If I ever do that again, I may add a bit of mustard and a little more beer. I finished it off with about half a cup minced parsley.  It was a perfect do-ahead meal for a rainy November day.

It was VERY easy to put together and it used simple ingedients.  It filled the house with a fabulous aroma of stew all day.  I couldn't wait to eat it based on the aroma alone.  I was NOT dissappointed.  It tasted great!! I can't wait to eat the leftovers now.  I called my friend who is going to make it today.

Very good stew recipe.  Made a few changes per other reviews.  First, dredged meat in flower, pepper & season salt.  Used 1 TBS Worchestire sauce & 2 cans beef broth.  Also added corn, diced tomatoes & 1 package of stew seasoning.

An excellent recipe for a basic but delicious classic meal. I made the recipe exactly as is and don't feel any changes are necessary.

This is a perfect meal for a winter evening.

Thanks for great easy recipe. Keep lid on crockpot beginners like myself! Its key to cooking right. I didnt have W- sauce but made no difference for us. I also used a few tsp minute tapioca to thicken sauce it makes plenty great sauce for dipping crusty Italian bread in! I browned meat first also. Put Vegs on bottom, some Italian seasoning and liquid overall. Yum Thanks again.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I have modified a few ingredients!  I added yellow beans and peppers!  Also reduced a bit of the liquids.  It was done cooking in 9 hours on low.  10 to 12 hours on low is too much IMO.

Good basic recipe; After reading other postings, I added more Worcestershire sauce and garlic from the get-go. The only other thing I added was frozen peas 1 hour before eating. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe Nancy!

I made this recipe for my husband last week.  The stew came out good - although I needed to add a little more liquid to the pot because it started to get a little sticky.  In the end - the stew was good and could have used a bit of red wine or more Worcestershire.  I ended up pouring the stew into small crocks and added puffed pastry.  My husband thought that was great!
