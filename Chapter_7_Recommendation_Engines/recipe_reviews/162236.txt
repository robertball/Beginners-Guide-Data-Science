We love beets, and at only 167 calories per serving, I couldn't pass this up.  I added garlic, salt and pepper, but it still could have used some more flavor.  Also, the presentation is sort of strange.  Everything is pink, that's for sure.  And, since the chicken is cut up into pieces, I actually couldn't tell the difference between the chicken and the mushrooms on my plate.  Next time I make this (and I will make it again, for sure), I'll leave the chicken breasts whole and saute the chicken, mushrooms, and onions with the spices before adding the beets, and maybe skip the juice.  Overall, tasty recipe!  Four stars for creativeness and taste, three stars for presentation.

This was an awesome recipe.  I also didn't cut the chicken up small.  I cut the chicken in chunks and added the beets last so the entire dish did not go pink.  For more flavor, I added ginger, dill, basil a bit of coconut powder and a can of cream of mushroom soup for a more saucier dish (to serve with rice).  It was a big hit.

Quite tasty but needed a little more kick.  I added 2 tbsp. of minced garlic and some black pepper.   I also threw in some extra veggies (carrots, snow peas).

I would give this a 3.5 if I could.  It is very healthy but needs more flavor.  I have made this twice but haven't quite decided the flavor it needs-I like beets so I still enjoyed it and so did the rest of the family-I added garlic, salt and pepper.

after reading the comments by others, I made a few additions.  I used yellow beets, carrots, onion, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper.  I paired it with couscous.  yummy!
