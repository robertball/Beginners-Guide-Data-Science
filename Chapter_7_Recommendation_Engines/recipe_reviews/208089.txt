What a great recipe... a few changes due to the ingredients I had available in the kitchen: Used Cider Vinegar instead of Balsamic; White Onion vs Red; Garlic Salt vs Celery Salt; Omitted Parsley; topped with a sprinkle of paprika.  Fantastic Results!  They were a big hit at the dinner party...although, needed to whip up a second batch half-way through the dinner party...everyone wanted more!  Hint for preparing ... put stuffing ingredients in a small ziploc bag (sandwich size).  Nip a small corner off the bottom and squeeze the stuffing into the egg whites!

This a great recipe for gourmet deviled eggs. The additional of the bacon is a wonderful idea. However, I think they would have tasted better without the red onion. It seemed to overpower the other ingredients.         REVISION: 5 stars when I halved the amount of red onion and grated it like another reviewer suggested. I have made this recipe 3 times since my original review and found that using quality real bacon bits tastes as good as the pan-fried bacon and takes a lot less time.

We loved these.  Husband said they were the best deviled eggs he has ever eaten.  That means a lot because deviled eggs are probably one of his favorite foods.  One suggestion I have is to grate the onion instead of mincing.  Makes it much easier, and you don't have to worry about accidentally biting into a too large chunk of onion.  Thanks for the recipe!!!  Something extra:  Today I turned this recipe into egg salad because my husband had bought some baconnaise and these eggs popped into my mind.  Super good!  Just added about a tablespoon of dijon to it.

Outstanding.  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.  Comments were "most flavorful deviled eggs they ever had".  Was a little leary of the balsamic vinegar but followed the direction anyway - glad I did.  Added a little spicy mustard (1 or 2 tsp).  Mixture appeared drier than traditonal deviled eggs but that's ok.  Will definitely make again.

These were delicious!  My husband doesn't normally like deviled eggs, but he liked these.  I didn't have the red onion on hand so I substituted a bit of onion powder.  I think the red onion would have made them even better.

I normally do not like deviled eggs, but these were absolutely amazing!  Took it to a pot luck and it was gobbled up in a matter of minutes.  Kind of regret only making 1 1/2 batches.  Next time I will triple the recipe... it was that good!

We love deviled eggs and were looking for a little change in the recipe.  This was just the ticket!  I took the advice of another and grated the onion rather than minced (use much less onion when it is grated).  It was just perfect after an hour and the ingredients had a chance to meld together.  I took these to a New Years party. They sold out within minutes and I was asked for the recipe. Great job.  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made these for yesterday's  4th of July picnic and heard nothing but complaints which I think were justified. I managed to eat two halves, but the bacon turned too chewy in the mayo and the deviled eggs filling itself was way too sweet. I thought it seemed strange putting sugar with balsamic vinegar and it didn't get any better with refrigeration. I'm sorry but I didn't like these at all and was disappointed that I hadn't stuck with the traditional recipe with mayo, mustard and egg yolks. My husband and kids all disliked them.

I have made this recipe for a few special events.  The consumption of the eggs are always followed by rave reviews and usually with the request for the recipe.  Replace your old mayo, egg, salt and pepper recipe with this one!

Hey Stephanie V! You're da man, er, I mean, you're da woman. Finally, seriously good tasting deviled eggs. I made some for a small gathering of friends last night, and I thought I was going to have to call for police protection when I ran out before that party was over. I used smoked, thick-cut bacon, so the eggs were a little chunky, but what a dynamite taste. Thanks for posting the recipe.

Excellent ingredients and excellent texture!  The bacon is awesome mixed into this.  The only thing I'd do differently the second time 'round is to omit the sugar and double the balsamic vinegar.  I still can't figure out why'd you want to add sugar to this!

These are absolutely the best deviled eggs I've ever tasted.  They are so different from the average recipe.  The combination of balsamic vinegar, bacon, and sugar is delicious.  I always add a bit more balsamic vinegar than called for to make that flavor stand out more, and also to make them a bit more tangy.  It contrasts perfectly with the addition of sugar.  Every time I take them to a function, I'm always asked for the recipe.  You'll never want to make plain deviled eggs again.

These are good when served right away, but not so good the next day. I will only make these again when I know they will all be eaten.

These were the best. I followed everyone's recommendation and halved the red onion portion and grated it. I didn't have any bacon on hand but it was great even without it. I cant imagine how much better it would be with it. I compensated by adding a tiny pinch of salt. I also used a small sandwich bag to fill the egg whites. It made is so easy and it made those pretty swirls. I topped with a sprinkle of paprika. Next time I will make these using those real bacon bits and someone has mentioned. Thanks for the great recipe!

FANTASTIC!!! 10 stars dude. I was looking for a unique Deviled Egg recipe and this was a GREAT find! If you don't want it as sweet - add less sugar...If you want it less salty - you know the drill, modify and make it your own. This is a keeper and the deviled eggs I will be bringing to parties. Thank you Stephanie, you rock!

Made these for Easter for the first time.  It was a last minute change of recipes, and I hit a home run.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand, so I garnished with very light sprinkle of paprika.  Next time, I will be sure I have parsley, because I think it would only add to the deliciousness.  The other  deviation I made was to follow some of the other suggestions and grate the red onion rather than mince it.  And that became my only "issue" with these eggs.  First of all, I used our home grown chicken eggs, so the yolks are much more yellow than store bought eggs.  Then, when I grated the red onion, it turned into a slurry of greyish looking yuck. In spite of my better judgement, I added that to the bright orange yolks,  and the result was just what I should have expected - not a very appetizing color.  Next time, and there will be many next times, because everyone loved these, I will mince the onions as the recipe calls for - that will eliminate some the the juicing I got when I grated the the onion.  If I decide that I like the grated onion better, I will experiment with a non-red onion.  I have been looking for the "perfect" deviled egg recipie, and I think I found it.  Thank you for sharing this Stephanie V!

Received rave reviews and were gone in a flash.  The mix didnt seem to completely fill all of the whites, but a couple of my whites fell apart so it still worked ok.  Great taste!

This was my very first attempt at making deviled eggs -- a childhood favorite of both mine and my boyfriend's.  These were delicious!  Not quite what I was expecting (neither the bacon nor the balsamic prevailed), but very good!  Perhaps my tastes were "off" that day, but will definitely try these again!

These are fantastic! We've made a few batches now that have been great sides for lunch one day, and breakfast the next. There is a Hoosier part of me that misses some element of pickle juice in this recipe (easy enough to add), but these are a huge hit in my house.

I tried this for my Independence Day cook out and I have to say they were so good, I don't think I can go back to my standard deviled eggs ever again.

Tried these today for a 4th of July party.  This is the first time I have used sugar in deviled eggs and didn't really like the taste.  They were ok but I didn't really like the texture of the bacon in the filling.  Am a huge deviled egg fan and also love both vinegar and bacon so was really hoping to love these but didn't.

Amazingly good. My brother-in-law is a professional chef and he thought these were delicious. Make sure to mince the onion and bacon really well to avoid big chunks of either. Best when the flavors have a chance to blend. Will make these again.

I made these for the first time for my own house-warming and they were such a big hit that the next three parties I went to served them! I didn't change a thing from the recipe except that I mixed everything in a gallon size ziplock bag, snipped off the corner, and piped it into the eggs directly from there!

These were pretty delicious however I altered the recipe, I omitted the onions and used onion powder instead - didn't have any bacon either. I added a dash of garlic powder, 1 tbls of relish, a couple drops of worcestire sauce and hot sauce, 2 tsp ground mustard, and a dash of salt. I put the filling in a sandwich bag and cut a tiny hole in the tip and squeezed to fill the egg halves which turns out much neater than spooning. I also garnished with paprika instead of parsley.

Not your normal run of the mill deviled egg recipe, they are awesome!  Very addicting.  I used my "special" balsamic for this recipe and I think I used a whole teaspoon+.  How can you go wrong with the age old combination of bacon and eggs?  I did mince the onion very fine as others have suggested.  I'm going to make it again for New Years.

Delicious!  My guests raved about these eggs. They do have a funny color but just sprinkling the top with sweet paprika fixed that.  Only thing is my husband thought it had a bit too much onion, although I didn't.  I only wish I had crumbled the bacon into smaller pieces (used fresh smoked bacon). I will make these again but will mince my bacon more and put in just a bit less onion for Hubby

To cut down on time I put all the ingredients into a food processor. These were not creamy like we are used to, and the family did not care for them. I thought the flavor was good, but definitely needed more mayo and or some mustard

I liked this recipe, and so did most of our guests, but the reason I didn't give it a better review is because they tasted awfully sweet to me.  I like the crunch of the onion, and bacon makes everything better, but the celery salt is very strong, and, like i said, just too sweet.  I will be making some changes next time.

We LOVED these! and they were simple. My husband would like these more with more vinegar, that's how he likes his deviled eggs - and now I know - but they sure disappeared quickly! By sons both loved them too :)

I made a half batch, didn't have quite enough mayo, but added in a bit of ranch dressing and it was still fine. I omitted the red onion and parsely, and used regular table salt instead of celery salt. Still very good and I will make again!

I -- and the rest of the Easter dinner guests -- liked this take on deviled eggs. I used a hardwood-smoked bacon (what I had on hand) and was afraid the smoke flavor would be overpowering, but the balsamic vinegar cut that taste. I realized only *after* I had filled all of my egg whites that I had left out the celery salt, so perhaps that will improve the taste even more next time. These were still very egg-y, but they were better than any deviled eggs I'd had before. If called upon to make deviled eggs, I'll go with this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

These were good, but I didn't think they were fantastic.  For my taste, they were too sweet.  However, I took these to church, and others liked them alright. One note: they're better after sitting in the fridge for a few hours.  I thought they were terrible right after making them, but ok after they hung out overnight.

Definitely the best deviled eggs ever.  Zesty, flavorful, bacony goodness.  I followed the recipe exactly, except used turkey bacon and reduced-fat mayo.  ('Cuz that's how I roll, dawg.)  Oh, and I did add a splash of milk to the yolk mixture to thin it a bit.

All I can say is OMG!! these are by far the best deviled eggs ever.  I just made them for Easter and they were gone in seconds.  One of my guests arrived 1/2 hr late and only got to eat 1.  I will be making these again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are by far the best deviled eggs I have tasted. I made the recipe and couln't stop eating. I gave some to my neighbor and she said the same. 2 days later, I made them again. My mom said I'll die from a protein overdose LOL. I didn't have any Celery Salt, so I substituted with Garlic Powder and instead of the red Onion, I used green Onions. Very, very good.

These turned out great! I read the review to grate the red onion but like a crunch so I was just sure to finely mince.  The bacon added great flavor,

This is an awesome recipe! I make these for pot lucks and always get rave reviews. I avoid chewy bacon by using them as a topping that gets sprinkled on just before serving. The onion will help keep crunch, also. And you can cut down on the sugar if you are afraid it will be too sweet but DON'T cut by much. The sugar is needed to balance the acidity of the balsamic

These eggs were a great change-up from the usual deviled eggs.  They were a bit sweet for my taste, but the rest of my family loved them as the recipe was written.  The next time I will deviate and try it with half of the sugar.

The consistency was perfect. Deviled eggs often fall into too dry or too mayo-ey. The bacon was a very nice touch as well.

I think I might be the odd one, but I thought these eggs were just so-so.  They seemed to lack a bit of "tang" - I think a more vinegar or some hot sauce would have been a nice addition.

My friends love deviled eggs but I wanted to try something different then the classic version. They loved it! Everyone kept asking what was in it.   I didnt have celery salt but did have celery. So I threw in the veggies and parsley into a food processor. Then combined the rest in a bowl. This made prepping a snap!

Okay, wow!  These were absolutely awesome!  The only thing I didn't have was red onion, so I substituted with sweet yellow onion.  My husband, who grew up with a mom making deviled eggs almost weekly, had outgrown the taste for deviled eggs, but was absolutely going on and on about these.  He said they were the best he'd ever had.  I just made them on the spur of the moment when a few eggs cracked while boiling them for my son to take to daycare.  It was very simple to make and since we liked it so much, I'll definitely be making these again.

These are delicious! My husband won't touch mayonnaise so I used Miracle Whip and after the fact realized I should have either used a lot less sugar or omitted it altogether. They are still great though and I will be making these again. Bacon makes EVERYTHING better! :)

They turned out sweet. It could have been the mayo we used though. I might try this again and just omit the sugar, and use a different mayo.

These where excellent! I did not have red onion so I used white onion that I chopped in the food processor.  I also had to replace the celery salt with table salt. Thanks for a 5 star recipe!

These eggs keep a 5 star. These are awesome and we can't wait till the holidays. People request my deviled eggs. Wait till they try these! These make my deviled eggs,as great as they are, seem like chopped liver. I didn,t have celery salt so I left it out however these eggs are plenty salty and if I had added celery salt they would have been to salty. I am a salt person too. Also I used double the bacon and I only had 10 eggs. we all ate eggs till we were pop eyed!!! LOL

I was afraid of the combination of vinegar and bacon too, but these were great. I left out the onion and substituted onion powder since that's what I had.

Great recipe.  I added a teaspoon of mustard and extra pepper. I used the rest of the  parsley as garnish on the tray.

These deviled eggs were fantastic!  My 5yo daughter helped me make these and the whole family (husband and older daughter) loved them.  I did add about 1 1/2 tsp of spicy brown mustard and also sprinkled with paprika.  Will be making these again soon

I just made these and I thought the sugar ruined the recipe. I had a very sweet onion which I chopped fine in the mini processor so I didn't have the problem with the onion some of the other reviewers said. I halved the recipe since I only wanted to make 6 eggs. I did not halve the spices or the Balsamic because I love bright flavors. I am hoping the flavors will develop after they chill for awhile. I will try again without the sugar. So disappointed after the other positive reviews. Update 3 hours later. Recipe was definitely better after chilling & sitting. I only had fresh cilantro for topping instead of parsley and this was a great addition. I will make these again without the sugar I still couldn't taste the Balsamic.

AWESOME!! I brought them to a party and they quickly disappeared. I made these with white onion instead of red.  I left out the celery salt as I felt it was salty enough with the bacon.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe last weekend for a BBQ. I halved the sugar and forgot the onion altogether but overall I think the recipe was pretty good. I like the fact that it is an untraditional deviled egg recipe. I definitely make this again, hopefully remembering to add the onion this time.

Not my thing.  I miss the zing that mustard adds, and the balsamic vinegar didn't add enough punch to compensate for the missing mustard.  I also didn't like the sweetness that the sugar added.

These were very good.  I didn't have bacon, but they tasted great without.  I was a little scared of the onion, but they gave the eggs a great crunch.  I followed other reviewers and grated the onion and I think that definitely helped.

I liked it. Somewhat different texture with bacon crunch in it. And the sweet and savory makes it unique. Not the best I've tasted but it's a nice flavor.

Good stuff, Maynard!  I cut back on the mayo a bit, & added some horseradish sauce for a little extra kick, sometimes I garnish with salad olive slices, or even jalapeno slices.  I could eat these all day!

This is now my go to deviled egg recipe but then it's hard to go wrong with bacon and balsamic! I use bacon bits and dried minced onion and substitute a smoked bacon salt for the celery salt. This also makes a great egg salad.

I made this with half the onion, grated as others have suggested, and half the sugar.  They were wolfed down before dinner was served.  They were amazing, even with turkey bacon.  The basalmic vinegar really does the trick.  I also topped it with smoked paprika, a must!

This is a great recipe.  I did make some changes, however. I made these for a baby shower over the weekend, so I doubled the recipe. After reading the other reviews, I omitted the onion altogether and used a little less sugar than called for.  I used all the other spices as directed, and added a tablespoon of Grey Poupon. I made the eggs the and yolk filling the night before the shower, leaving the bacon out of the filling. The next morning, I assembled the eggs, using a pastry bag, sprinkled with paprika, then made the bacon extra crispy, and crumbled the bacon as a topping over the finished eggs - more like a garnish.  These eggs were the first thing to go at the party, and EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  Success!

This was nice. Recommend tasting a lot in prep of filling, since eggs vary in size. I used mostly duck eggs. Also dusted some with smoked paprika. Nice. I think I should have added a touch more balsamic. I also used less bacon, since the bacon I used was home-smoked, and sliced pretty thick. I will use this as go-to recipe in future. For me, practice and tweaking will take it  from great to spectacular. This is a chef's recipe, more than a cook's recipe.

This recipe sounded great and with a few changes it was good.  I decreased the amount of sugar by half, still thought it was to sweet, so I added 1-2 tbsp. of yellow mustard.  Turned out very yummy!

The bacon makes is so very tasty! Other minor changes: I eliminated the onion, and added 2 tsp. onion powder instead, and also didn't have fresh parsley, so I added 2 tsp. of dried parsley. 
For a fun twist, we tried adding a little ketchup! To give it a little pizzazz, stir in an extra 1/4 cup of ketchup, too!

I made the bacon and forgot to add it to the ingredients until I had filled the eggs.  I added the bacon to the remaining yolk and put a second layer of bacon topper on and it turned out as a two layer deviled egg.  Tastes great.  I also used sweet onion instead of red onion and it had a nice sweet and sour tang because of the balsamic vinegar.

I've never made deviled eggs before but I wanted to try some for a holiday party this year. I didn't want to do traditional deviled eggs so I went for this. And I absolutely adore this recipe. So easy to make and absolutely delicious. After reading some of the other reviews I did substitute bacon for real bacon bits to save a bit of time. I also left out the red onion and replaced parsley with a sprinkling of paprika on top, just because I love paprika. I would absolutely make this recipe again and again.

I made these for a massive Thanksgiving party, we had to go get more eggs because we ate half of them while cooking! I did use green onion instead of the red, and omitted the celery salt (only because the store was out of it). I also used the Hormel pre-cooked bacon, much easier to prepare and chop. I suggest adding sugar to taste, your quality of Balsamic Vinegar will alter how sweet it will turn out. These were a huge hit, we were sad there were no left-overs!

These were a huge HIT the only change that I made was to only add about 1/2 a teaspoon (or less) sugar since I don't like sweet deviled eggs. Several people asked for the recipe.

Not bad, made a half batch as written only substituting yellow onion for the red onion because that's what I had on hand.  Hubby and I thought they could use a bit more flavor, maybe a bit more balsamic or some Worcestershire sauce.

These did not taste like a traditional deviled egg, but omg they were totally amazing!  I could not stop eating them.  Made them for a girl get together, and had to transfer the batch of eggs to a smaller bowl to transport, because I ate so many!!!!!!  Amazing, delish and easy!  LOVE these!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Agree with most reviewers on the onion overpowering these eggs.  I'll try cutting down and/or grating them next time.  Otherwise, was a hit at our Superbowl party.  I even sprinkled some with paprika.

These were great but I did cut back on the sugar and used garlic mayo instead of regular. I'm not a fan of red onion so I used vadalia's instead. Would definitely make them again.  Kelly Ft. Laud

I thought I would try something different for a bbq I was having but ended up wishing I had gone traditional.  I didn't like the texture of the bacon in the yolk mixture.  It's unexpected and not in a good way.  And the onion and sugar made it too sweet in my opinion.

So, my Allrecipes pet peeve is when a person highly rates a recipe and then proceeds to list the 12 changes they made to the ingredient list and how their preparation vastly differed from the original submission. So, I am going to be a bit of a hypocrite and tell you that I made this with a few changes BUT all I did was change the amounts of the ingredients that were already listed. I doubled the vinegar to one teaspoon because I felt like I could hardly taste it. I halved the sugar to one teaspoon because I was concerned that it would be too sweet, And I halved the red onion, making sure to mince it as fine as possible. 

Also, I think it is best to cool hard-boiled eggs in an ice bath rather than just cool water before peeling.

I have made these a couple of times and they are always a hit.  The only things I do differently are that I use a balsamic reduction instead of just balsamic vinegar (Aceto Balsamico di Modena).  It's a touch richer than regular vinegar and I use it for everything!  The other is that I garnish with a little bacon instead of the parsley for a little more crunch and saltiness.  Otherwise, all my ingredient proportions are exact to the recipe and they are SO tasty!  My friend's husband told me I am only allowed to visit if I bring these with me.  :D

I added garlic salt instead of celery salt. also bacon bits instead of making bacon especially for the recipe. I doubled it.  It’s delicious. I used a pastry bag to make nice deviled eggs for New Years.

This is a great recipe. I started always sprinkling the bacon crumbles on top. That works well. I also add mayo until just a gloppy consistency. It makes it easier to daub onto the egg-white halves. An eighth teaspoon of turmeric also adds a little zing, and I use shallots in place of the onion for a slightly more delicate flavor.

Love these! The only changes: put bacon on top of the eggs, then top with parsley, a few drops of olive oil, and a sprinkle of Parmesan/Romano cheese.

Turned out great! I made these for an office party and they were gone in seconds! The one thing I changed however was instead of garnishing the parsley I combined it into the mixture, which I found easier.

These are our favorite deviled eggs ever! I make them all the time and my husband and I usually fight over the last one. I do make a few small changes, I do not add celery salt  but instead I use About 1/4 teaspoon salt and a dash of minced garlic. I also double the balsamic  vinegar.  Oh, and I use green onions, the red onions would seem a little too strong to me.

Made a variation of these for Thanksgiving - used bacon bits instead of bacon, and onion powder instead of onion (4 children who wouldn't eat onion, otherwise I would have included it!)
I gave 4 stars because I didn't try the exact recipe, but I wasn't a fan myself. However everyone else loved them so much, that I now find myself sitting down for an everyday, weekday dinner, with those exact same deviled eggs on the side. lol. My 8yr old is fussy and hates trying new food... but she asks for these all the time now!
So, I am personally not stunned with this deviled egg concept, but I am majority outvoted (and I'm not a fussy eater - I will eat them when they're here). Thanks for the new twist! Friends and fam would definitely give 5 stars.

Don't be mislead by the teensy amount of balsamic vinegar in this recipe! A little goes a long way. After mixing everything, I was thinking this would not be that great, but it is absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to bring them to Thanksgiving lunch tomorrow!

I made them according to the recipe because it was my first time. I think I'd cut the sugar in half because they were very sweet, but then again, they were awfully good just the way they were.

OMG!  These were the best eggs I've ever eaten.  I brought them to my husband's reunion and they were gone in a flash.  I sprinkled extra bacon over the top, used a shallot instead of a red onion but everything else was the same.

I followed the recipe exactly (but I made 6 servings instead of 24) and my family loved it! They were delicious and not too hard to make. I will definitely make these again! :)

I rate things according to what my kids think. They are VERY picky and LOVED these. Even my boyfriend said he doesn't like deviled eggs and he liked them.  I used very high quality balsamic vinegar which is sweeter.  I love sugar but could have cut it down a tad. I didn't wait long enough to cool the eggs completely so they were hard to peel. I also didn't have bacon on hand which would have made them even better but I'm glad I cut out those calories. I also topped it with cilantro instead of parsley.  Next time I think I will mix it all together to make an egg salad and maybe even serve it on bread for dinner for the kids

Really delicious version of deviled eggs!  Diced up onions, extra fine, and did not add any sugar.  They were a hit!

Great recipe! I followed all instructions but as I used super jumbo size eggs I added a touch more of vinegar and sugar. The guests at our get together basically stood around the egg platter eating them until they were gone.

Loved this!!  Used real bacon pieces instead of cooking bacon, used half the amount of onion and finely finely chopped based on other reviews. This will be a go to recipe!

These deviled eggs are ridiculous!  You can get away with a little less mayo and sugar and they would still be amazing.  I used applewood smoked bacon which was a nice compliment to the balsamic vinegar.

5.11.16   Really liked the addition of the celery salt and the balsamic (ended up adding a little more of each), made them taste a little special.  I have a number of deviled egg recipes that I make, and this one will be added to my rotation.

It was ridiculously hard to make these look appetizing, as the eggs mostly crumbled when I tried to peel and halve them. However, they tasted delicious! I wouldn't make for guests because of the presentation, but my bf liked them!

I love AR for the
recipes, but more for the reviews. Thank you all for your "take" and little alterations. Now don't get me wrong, this sounded great as is, but I'm not an "as is" kind of guy. So here's my take... halved the sugar and no balsamic, serving italian butter (extra virgin olive oil & balsamic w/ cracked peper) w/ dinner and didnt want to be redundant. Substituted the brine from Tabasco's sweet and hot pickles.  Added a splash or three or Sriracha and substituted cilantro for parsley.
P.S. Don't throw out your brine once the pickles etc. are gone, it can add amazing flavor to so many dishes.

So good! I used white balsamic to avoid making the yolk mixture too brown. Plus I added a bit of turmeric to brighten up the color. These always go quick.

Just finished making a half batch of this recipe. The filling is good but a bit too sweet for me. I also added a pinch of salt to level that out. I love the idea of bacon but I think I will look a little further for a recipe more suited to my tastes.

Believe the reviews! This is the Best recipe for deviled eggs... ever! I was very skeptical about using the sugar, but I followed the recipe to the letter. The flavor of these eggs is so delicious, you better double the recipe.
