This recipe is fantastic! My husband and I had it for dinner tonight and it became an instant favorite. I omitted the olives, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Arrdub hit the nail on the head, perfect blend of flavors and needs nothing more. Thanks for an excellent posting :)

This was a great dish and even better the next day for lunch. I did a few things differently based on what I had on hand. Left out the heirloom tomatoes and just used cherry, vidalia onion for the red, and added some diced yellow and red bell pepper. I also subbed dried parsley and dried thyme. This had a really good flavor not to vinegar-y but enough to give it a nice bite.

Delicious. I used dried basil, time and oregano and it still turned out well. I'd recommend less olive oil in the recipe, or more couscous - it ends up being a little oily. Still delicious!

I used half the amount of olive oil and it still turned out great.  Good leftover dish the next day too.

The raw onion and garlic was a bit overpowering. I would definitely use less than called for, or perhaps throw the garlic in with the couscous when toasting it. I did use less olive oil than called for to make it less greasy and I would probably use about half the amount of feta next time, I don't think it needs that much. Despite all that, this is a really good recipe with good flavors and I will definitely make it again with some alterations!

My husband made this last night with the black bean quinoa burgers (also from this site).  Delicious!!!! Our market did not have heirloom tomatoes this week, so I bought 2 pints of mixed tomatoes (cherry, yellow, grape) and used those instead.  We also used dried thyme since we didn't have that one in our herb garden.  This will be a " go to" salad.  It works for side dishes, lunch main dishes, potlucks, etc.  so glad we tried this recipe!!!

Fantastic recipe - enjoyed by everyone! I didn't actually have all the herbs so I just threw in what I had. Loved the taste of the olives through it too.

OMG-best dish ever! I used a bit less olive oil than called for and used rice vinegar since that was all I had. I skipped the cherry tomatoes and just cut up some larger ones since I had no cherry tomatoes, but it was still so good!

Delicious!  I used less oil than it called for and didn't some of the fresh herbs, so I used dried.

I love this recipe! I make a bigger batch so I toasted 2 cups of the pearl couscous and added 2 1/4 cups of broth, covered it and simmered on low for 10min.  No liquid was left and the couscous was perfect.  No need to add too much extra of all the other ingredients, just test it and add accordingly.  I also like to add 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes along with fresh ones- makes it doubly good!

This dish is amazing and a great way to use your heirlooms. I didn’t use Thyme because we don’t like it, even without it this was great. Using leftovers for a light lunch.

This salad is delicious! I did not add the olives because I did not have any and we still loved it.

No changes necessary, and I will make it again, but will cut the recipe in half as I'm cooking for one. I did warm it up slightly the 3rd time around and put it on a bed of butter lettuce, yummy.

This is one seriously amazing salad!  Definitely let it chill before serving.  I'll definitely be making this one again and again- the number of fresh herbs called for has me close to planting an herb garden just to keep myself stocked!

Excellent taste.  Love Israeli {pearl) couscous as it gives the dish a little more texture than regular couscous.  Easy to make, just a little more involved time wise than most regular couscous recipes.  My partner who doesn't care for couscous (texture problem I think) was asking for seconds on this meal.

Just absolutely delicious fresh and flavorful!! The heirloom tomatoes and fresh herbs are what makes this dish pop. I use regular balsamic instead of white only because I misread the recipe. I also left out the olives and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Aside from that I kept the recipe as is and was more than pleased. It is a bit time consuming chopping everything but well worth it. Definitely will make this again.

I used goat cheese instead of feta and cherry or grape tomatoes.  I also doubled the recipe and used sorghum as well as the couscous. Delicious!
