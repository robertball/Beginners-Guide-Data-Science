Completely excellent. I made this as directed except for using more mango and avocado - and I layered instead of tossed because I like the way it looks. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made it with white balsamic vinegar (I've only just recently discovered it - I like it much more than the dark - and also a Romaine/iceberg mix. I was really surprised how well the fruits and avocado went together. The dressing is also really good. Thanks!

This isn't just a side salad, as yes, it could be. It can also be a hot summer day meal, a desert, or a tasty snack. When canding almonds always stir through the whole cooking time, then they won't burn. I thought this was good enough to put on my new resturant menu. Koodoo's to the cook!

This was very healthy and light and decent, but not spectacular.  I figure that the salad is only as good as the ripeness of the fruits.  Unusual combination of fruits though, considering avocado season is in the winter, so I couldn't get all my fruits ripe at the same time.  I candied almonds using only white sugar and heating them in a NONSTICK pan (very important). Then I let them cool on GREASED wax paper.  Not sure I'll make this salad again.

I really wanted to like this.  And it was good.  However, "sugaring" the almonds was tricky, burnt them on the first try. watch the amount of butter.  also the dressing, though good, is heavy. do NOT put on until just before serving. after that, doesn't take long for the fruits to turn into mush. also the prep time on this has got to be wrong. 15 minutes? took me that long to do the mango and papaya and get them in the blender for the dressing.  55 minutes, although I did use an extra mango. still way off. I gave it 3 stars because it took too long, was expensive and not a light summer salad as I thought.

This was a really tasty salad and perfect for what I had in mind.  I did use less vinegar and butter but that is just a personal preference.

This was so refreshing.  We had this as a side salad for dinner, but I could see this with a sandwich at lunch.  The "dressing" was an unexpected surprise.  I was concerned that it would have a strange taste, but the balsamic vinegar added just the right tartness to balance out sweetness of the fruit. 

I forgot to add the almond brittle when I served this, but we noshed on that after dinner making it a wonderful dessert.

Fantastic! I'm not a huge fan of either mango or papaya, but this blew me away!

The first time I made it, I was in a hurry so I didn't candy the almonds. I was a great lunch salad. The second time, I did candy the almonds, and it does add to the salad. I decided it needed something else, so I added some chopped red onion and grape tomatoes. These additions made it even better.

The flavors of this salad were amazing!  Great textures, especially enjoyed the candied almonds.  This will be a great accompaniment to grilled chicken in the future.   Thanks for sharing!
