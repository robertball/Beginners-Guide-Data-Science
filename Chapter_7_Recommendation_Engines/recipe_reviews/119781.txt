I made this many times last summer and lost the recipe I can't tell you how relieved I am to find it again. My husband asked for this pie almost every day it is absolutely wonderful. Simple to make & inexpensive I can't wait for my tomatoes to come in to make it again

Very Good. I sliced the tomatoes and let them drain while  I prepared the rest. I layered onion , tomatoes, bacon, cheese and repeated  the layer. I spread mayo on top and then sprinkled parmesan cheese. I have made it with just mozzarella cheese or just Cheddar or combination of both.

This was a mess, which was a huge bummer. I've wanted to make this since I first saw it in either Quick Cooking or Taste of Home years ago. I did follow some of the other reviewer's advice and put the bacon on the bottom and I used half mayo/half sour cream and added spices to the topping as others had. This was a pain to get out of the pie pan and it just fell apart. And we weren't all that hot on the flavors together, either. Sorry. I wanted this to work so badly. It just failed. I'm quite confused because the reviews speak so well.

I didn't like the taste of this all that well.  The only things I did differently were to chop up my tomatoes instead of slice them.  I also put them in a strainer while the piecrust baked/cooled.  Due to this and the baking, the tomato taste was really concentrated which meant it was pretty acidic.  I wonder if I would like it with a couple of teaspoons of sugar or a thick white sauce thrown in.  I do have to say that it was quite pretty, though

This pie was very good, but we adjusted for our tastes.  I roasted the tomatoes on a rack over a cookie sheet for 40 min at 375 then 400 (20 min each) and only switched to 400 bc bf wanted to make something at 400.  I prebaked the pie shell, then layered as directed.  I can't handle that much mayo, so I used half mayo, half greek yogurt, and added garlic powder and oregano to the mixture along with the cheese.  I then topped with snips of fresh basil.  I intended this to be dinner tonight, but I made it yesterday.  When I took it out to reheat, there was no juice or soggy crust from the tomatoes, and the combination of flavors was wonderful.  I definitely would not make this frequently bc of the calorie and fat content but it was a nice indulgent dinner with salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

We thought this pie had great flavor! However, it was VERY watery, like to the point that the crust was mush, and I even patted the slices of tomatoes dry before assembling. I added some shredded mozzarella along with the cheddar in the mayo mixture and also added about 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the mix. I also used a little more bacon than called for. After putting the mayo topping on, I sprinkled it with some strands of fresh basil and a little sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese. I may try this again sometime, as I said, we liked the flavor A LOT, it was just that the crust was waaaay soggy! Thanks for posting. :)

The mayonnaise layer was just too heavy for us.  Hubby and I both agreed that the pie tasted good overall, but was overpowered by the thick mayo topping.  I might try it again, putting only half the mayo it calls for on the bottom, with spinach mixed in - letting the tomatoes and bacon get nice and toasty on top.

I reversed the order I filled the pie shell, bacon first, then tomato, in an effort to avoid soggy crust.  I also added some fresh basil and a sprinkle of garlic.  I used light mayo and extra sharp cheddar.  The flavor was good but I felt it was too heavy for my taste and certainly not good for anyone's cholesterol levels.

It's so simple, but so good! I've made it twice now. The second time, I did let the tomatoes drain for awhile before laying them in the crust. I also ground some black pepper over them before putting on the bacon (I love black pepper on my BLTs, so I figured it would work here, too). All I have around is light mayo, but the pie came out fine.  It's not the healthiest dish, but it's a nice treat.

Very good, & I'm not even a tomato lover.  My family really liked it.  I added some fresh basil & used a homemade pie crust that made it even better.  I would defintely make it again :-)
