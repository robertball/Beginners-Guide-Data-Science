My entire family loved this dish.  It was really tasty and the texture was great.  I increased the eggs to a total of 9, and used 1/3 cup of half and half.  I used 2 medium zucchini, a whole red bell pepper, 8 oz of mushrooms, 2 cloves of garlic and a whole yellow onion.  I didn't do the measurments stated in the recipe.  I chopped all of the veggies quite fine in the food processor, and I was very happy with the result.  Make sure you cook the veggies very well, until all of the water is cooked off.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again and again.

Great recipe cold or hot although a bit more flavorful hot.  Cutting the cream cheese in half also cuts the baking time a bit.  Watch carefully.  For more flavor I added 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil, eliminated the salt and pepper and substituted 1 tsp. Mrs. Dash and 1-2 tsp. Spike.  This recipe got raves from a very picky brunch guest!

another rave review! I made this for mothers day, a big crowd.  As hostess, I LOVE these mix and dump recipes. This one has the added benefit of looking really pretty if you thinly slice a large tomato and embed it into the wet mixture and bake. Looks party and shower pretty but so easy. 

I used asparagus and canned artichoke hearts. 9 eggs as earlier posters suggested. Asparagus were steamed until crisp before baking.

This is always a hit at office parties, as well as my house.  I use red bell pepper instead of green; red onion; a package of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained; and WAY more garlic.  I love cremini (also called baby portabella) mushrooms in this.  I believe I've used fresh tomatoes in this, and it was awesome.  Make sure to drain the sautéed veggies before and after cooling before mixing with egg and cheese mixture so your end product isn’t watery.  You can up the number of eggs if there appears to be too little to hold it all together, just eyeball it after mixing.  I can't eat wheat, so I skip the bread altogether.  I’ve made it with the 2 blocks of cream cheese, and just one, it was good both ways but VERY cheesy with both.  Adding herbs is always tasty, but for those merely looking for more kick, it’s all-about the hot sauce at the table so everyone can alter exactly to their taste.  Personally, I love chipotle Tabasco on any and all eggs.

This was excellent hot (and later, cold!). I served this to guests, and it flew off the platter! Next time, I won't add oil, and just saute in my nonstick pan (or spritz with Pam). I used chopped mushrooms, and with those and the oil, I ended up with a soggy mess in the saute pan. I had to drain/press out the liquid. If I hadn't, this would have been too soggy to eat. Next time I will add meat and/or veggies to this: sausage, chopped ham, crab, asparagus, broccoli, Swiss cheese, etc., would be some wonderful additions. I used one brick of reg cream cheese, and one of fat free. Next time, I'll try this with Egg Beaters. Also, be sure to butter the 9x13 pan well, to help get these out. I took them out when they were just out of the oven; if I had waited much longer, maybe they would have stuck a little more to the pan.

This is excellent *when* served cold. It's so much better the next day! It was just ok hot out of the oven, and that's why I gave it 4 stars. I topped it  with sliced tomatoes and parmesan cheese after 50 mins in the oven. Also, I increased the amount of eggs like suggested by other reviewers (to 10). I used fat free cream cheese and grated my own white cheddar Wisconsin Private Reserve. Additionally, I used freshly ground pepper, sea salt, and red, yellow, and green peppers for color.

Great flavor! Very popular= served it to the PTA and they loved it. Added broccoli and substituted two small cooked potatoes for the bread. Have made it a couple of times. Once you get on to it, it is easy to change vegetables/quantities. Cream cheese is a nice touch. Will print it out and cover it in plastic this time!

I made this for my sisters bridal shower and it was a huge hit.  It was really easy to prepare and I didn't have to worry about the timing.  I did make some changes.  I used 1 pkg of cream cheese, as suggested, and added 3 extra eggs.  I also roasted the vegetables the day before at 400 for about 1 1/2 hours.  I added about 4 cloves of garlic to the veggies and used red onion.  This gave the frittata a great flavor and left little to do the next day.  I can't wait to make this as a mexican frittata, a roasted red pepper and artichoke heart frittata, etc... YUM.

I made this dish to serve cold at a picnic dinner date with my husband at a local winery.  My son got to it first right out of the oven and pronounced it "bangin’."  While he preferred it hot rather than cold, that didn't stop him from eating more cold for breakfast the next morning.  I was glad it is a generous recipe because he put a serious dent in this and there was still plenty for us.  
As far as prep mods, I was not stingy with the veggies and cubed a low carb onion bagel instead of the wheat bread making this recipe lower carb and more Atkins friendly.  It’s truly bangin' er . . . delicious and, with the help of a food processor, easy.

This recipe takes a lot of time to make, and it's awfully high in fat, but when you want a hearty, flavorful brunch item (or breakfast or dinner, for that matter), this one is great.  Everyone in our family loved it.

following changes (due to what i had in the house): 1 zucchini, 1 8 oz package chopped frozen spinach, 1 onion, 3 cloves garlic. I sauteed all these together, also added a cup of diced tomatoes after sauteeing, before baking. Like others suggested, also used 9 eggs, cut cheese down to 1 cup, left out cream cheese and bread entirely.

I doubled this recipe this recipe and made it for over 25 people in about an hour, using muffin tins instead of a large pan. Cooking time: 25 minutes @ 350F (sealevel). I used yellow squash and broccoli from my garden for the vegetables. Modifications: 1/2 the cream cheese and 1/2again as many eggs (9 for a single recipe), whipping cream instead of half&half. I left out the bread cubes, and layered the bottom of the muffin tins with about 1,1/2 tsp Italian style seasoned bread crumbs, then added about 1"-1,1/2" frittata mix to each muffin form.   I like spice but some guests don't so I put out a small bottle of hot sauce as a garnish for those who enjoy.  This was a smash hit with a sophisticated group of gourmands and will certainly be in our recipe book for many years to come.

I've been looking for a recipe like this for awhile, but I balked at the high level of fat in this one.  I finally decided to try lightening it.  It was really good!  I imagine the lightened version is less creamy and less eggy in taste, but it was still very good. Next time I will use white bread because I didn't care for the texture of the wheat.  Here are my substitions: -1/2c Veggie Broth for 3 tbsp Vegetable Oil -3 whole eggs, 3 egg whites for 6 eggs -1/4c skim milk for 1/4c half and half -1 8oz Fat Free Cream Cheese and 1 8oz 1/3 Less Fat Cream Cheese for regular Cream Cheese -2 cups 2% shredded Cheddar instead of regular cheddar - added 1 slice of bread to make serving bigger  These substitutions allowed 1 serving to be 270 calories and 14g of fat while keeping most of the protein and taste.  Cooking time was reduced by 10-15 minutes as well.

A terrific recipe for a crowd with one small problem. NEVER ANY LEFT OVERS! I have made this dish for many guests. It makes an excellent make-ahead meal leaving the host or hostess time to socialize.  I cut up the veggies very small, almost mincing them. When I saute' the veggies, I make sure to cook them long enough producing and extracting as much liquid from the veggies, which is then drained off before adding the veggies to the eggs. If not the excess liquid ends up coming out in the eggs during the baking process. ...not cool!  Buon e cibo felice!

This is an excellent recipe!  I only used half of the cream cheese and that was perfect...any more and it might have been too overwhelming - at least for my family.  Overall, the flavors blend well.  A great way to use some veggies from our garden.

This dish is delish! I left out the mushrooms because I have family members who don't like them and used fresh from the garden chopped tomato instead. I too only used 1 pkg of cream cheese.

This recipe is the best!  I've made it once a week for a month now and each time I use different vegetables.  It's great with zucchini, spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, anything! I just use whatever I have in hand and it always comes out delicious.  I've used different cheeses, but chedder tastes the best.  I leave out the cream cheese and use a small amount of plain yogurt for a low fat version and it's still very good.

I made this in a 1/2 batch for a brunch and it was delicious and well received. I added a cup of fresh spinach. I also used Plain Greek Yogurt instead of the 1/2 & 1/2. When I took it out of the oven, I sprinkled cheese and diced green onions on top. Delicious and EASY!

Very nice dish. I made some substitutions (whipped cream cheese, 2% cheddar, egg beaters), as well as using no oil, instead using a little bit of Pam, to cut fat and some calories.  I added a red pepper, an extra 1/2 cup of cheese and a couple extra eggs, as well as seasoning salt, and it turned out great. I liked it better warm but it was almost as good cold the next day.

This is an excellent dish.  I had to make a breakfast dish for a coaches hospitality room at a high school swim meet.  I wanted to bring something that didn't have to be kept warm. I came across this recipe and it was perfect.  It was served room temperature and everyone loved it. I made one for myself a couple days later and I like it either cold or warmed slightly.   Broccoli is a very nice addition to the veggie list. I also added a can of green chilis to the veggies after they were sauted. And I added a teaspoon of chili powder and a teaspoon of garlic powder.  I used 1 1/2 packages of low fat cream cheese and that was plenty.

Awesome recipe. I added crumbled bacon and mushrooms. No cream, so I used skim milk.  Used 9 eggs and only 1 block of cream cheese. Even my little kids liked it.

I made this for Father's Day brunch and needless to say, it went over very well.  The frittata is rich and very versatile. I used 7 eggs instead of 6 and thought the mixture was a bit too firm for our preference.  Next time I will use 8 eggs.

made this a number of times with minumal adjustments.  just couldn't do it with the cream cheese, but great recipe without it!  Also did balsamic oven-roasted vegetables (on this sight) for extra flavor.  I love serving it at room temp after keeping it in the fridge.  flavors really open up.  also added sliced tomatoes on top the last bit of cooking.  it was so good!

After reading reviews, I increased the eggs to 10, added some seasoning (1 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp Mrs Dash onion & herb), increased garlic, and added sliced tomatoes on top--I'd recommend all of those changes.  My son really did not like the little white spots of cream cheese in this recipe and I only used 1 8 oz package...make sure you dice the cream cheese as small as possible.  Overall, this was a nice change of pace from sweet breakfasts like waffles and coffeecakes.

This was good, but not great. I used the food processor to process all the veggies (zucchini, yellow squash, red and yellow peppers, mushrooms, and onion) If I do this again, will add more herbs to liven up the flavor.

I made this for my son's birthday brunch.  I meant to double the recipe, but in my usual last minute frenzy, only doubled the amount of eggs and veggies.  The dish turned out fantastic and tasted super creamy with half the amount of dairy.  Everyone asked for the recipe and it's now a brunch staple!

I think if you omitted the cream cheese, it would have been okay.  I did not care for this recipe.

great way to get those veggies into the kiddies! i like chunky veggies but it is easy to "hide" them by using the food processor if your kids are picky. this is also a very adjustment-friendly recipe; i simply use what ever veggies i have on hand. i also used 9 eggs as suggested by others.

I thought this was decent, but not great as it was a bit bland.  I would make it again, but next time I will add some extra garlic and chop up some fresh herbs and see if that improves the flavor.

This was so easy, and a HIT at work! I made it even easier by using egg-beaters, even though I've never used them before.  Actually, I used the entire "quart" for the 9x13 pan. It did rise-but not too much. Subbed green onions, red for green bell pepper, only used (1) package of cream cheese, and added some cubed ham. DON'T skip the cream cheese!

I used different vegetables in my version; red pepper, onions, zuchini, mushrooms, garlic, brocolli (would be good w/carrott or tomato), also I used 1 1/2 bars of cream cheese and 9 eggs instead of six. Also added a little dill on top. I took it over to a brunch at my friends house and everyone loved it.

I was looking for something to put some of my Mom's garden tomatoes in.  Oh boy, did this ever do the trick.  Even though I used egg beaters, fat free cream and only tomato and onion--which I did not saute first, it was awesome.  I think part of the great flavor came from the cream cheese I used---green onion and chive which was also the light brand.  This was delicious!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!  I took it to a ladies' brunch, and everyone absolutely loved it.  I made it again for a baby shower, and again got many requests for the recipe.  It's a definite keeper!

I did make a few changes.  I used red bell pepper instead of green, just to add a bit more color.  I used fat free half and half instead of cream, and fat free cream cheese.  I don't think anyone even realized the difference.  I also used multigrain bread instead of wheat, and I cubed it very, very small.  Everyone was surprised that there was even bread in the mixture.

Overall, a very flavorful frittata.  Great served with a spinach salad!  Thanks so much for this one!

This was easy to make and very good.  I substituted the cream cheese for feta and used 1/2 as much.  Also left out the salt because feta is salty. Mushrooms would be a nice addition to the veggies.  I would make again for sure.

My children and I did not care for this.  We couldn't tell what it was at all.  Was it bread or vegetables or eggs?  Will not make again.  My husband was very disappointed in me and his reaction scared the ghosties out of me!

I made this for a cold lunch. My boyfriend thought it was delicious. He's on a low-carb diet and won't eat rice, pasta etc. and he really misses his junk food - and he said this was just as good as pizza and much lighter :) I made his with bacon, red pepper, mushrooms and tomato on top. I did as other reviewers suggested - added extra eggs and cut the cream cheese in half. I, personally, was sceptical to try the frittata coz it seemed a little rubbery but it tasted great. Will make again!

I found that you do not have to use the cream cheese, bread crumbs or half-and-half cream in this recipe. I used 9 eggs (as other reviewers suggested), no cream cheese and just skim milk in place of the half-and-half. I sprinkled a thin layer of Panko breadcrumbs on the bottom of the pan before adding the egg/vegetable mixture. As for the veggies, my kids love broccoli so I used a whole head of broccoli as my one and only vegetable (the first time I made this) and it worked out great. Actually, it tasted better the next day. Love this quick and nutritious meal.

Made this for Christmas morning. Mixed up the ingredients seperately the day before(sauted the vegies, mixed the egg and cream cheese, etc). I omitted the mushroom as one person didn't eat them. I increased the eggs as suggested and used 1 block of cream cheese. The 3 remaining pieces were reheated the next day and were delicious(I managed to get a bite!). This may be our new Christmas breakfast!

Based on other reviews, I added some extra spices to get a bit more flavor.  I made them for a work meeting and cooked individual frittatas in muffin pans.  They got compliments from everyone and no leftovers!

i love this recipe. You can put whatever you like in it & it always turns out delicious.  Fresh herbs always make a big difference too. I've learned through several variations that 9 eggs and 1/2 cup half & half Plus one cup  frozen shredded hashed browns create a wonderful texture.  I only use 1 package of cream cheese as well.  Plus it tastes better with every day passing.  Good comforting fare!

Made this for a brunch for work along with other egg casseroles.  This was the first to go even though it was the only "veggie" entree. I couldn't find zucchini so I made it with asparagus and only put in one package of cream cheese.  Very, very good.

My family and I enjoyed this Frittata very much. I did add 8 eggs, one pkg cream cheese, extra garlic and spices, roasted red peppers and our favorite wheat bread. It only took 45 minutes for cooking time.  I will make this again.

Great, but even better with a red pepper and much more garlic.  I also use baby bellas for the 'rooms.  On the top, I put some sliced tomatoes so that they broil into the frittata.  If you want to fancy it up, add some tiny pieces of cubes ham.  For the shredded cheese, I use mexican or taco...uum,uum good!!

This is really good!  I added another egg and it could have used a couple more.  Plus took other reviewers suggestions and only used 1 pkg. of Low fat cream cheese.  I'm sure 2 would have been just fine.  Also only used 3 slices of bread because thats all I had left! Also, try adding a tsp of dry mustard powder, or a TBS of prepared dijon mustard for that missing zip. I used dry mustard and it had a wonderful flavor.  Hubby finished it off at lunch!

This was excellent warm or room temperature.  A big hit at a buffet dinner party and for leftovers the night after.  Another time I would make it with only one package of cream cheese.  With two it was a bit overwhelming and over-rich.  Generally, an excellent recipe!

This dish was incredible. I'm not a particularly good cook and I don't like eggs, yet I made this dish for company and not only did it get rave reviews, I ate it, too! Don't worry that it seems like there'll be too much cream cheese -- once it's cooked, it's the perfect amount.

This was pretty good! Make sure you use a good whole wheat bread, and cube your bread pretty small so it mixes in well with the whole recipe.  My husband is a vegetarian, and he really enjoyed this.  I used all reduced fat and fat free ingredients and it turned out splendid!

I made this last night and found that it took no time at all to make.  I only used 4 oz of cream cheese and found it to be plenty, added tabasco for zip and used only 3 slices of bread because I was unsure about how it would all come together -- and my family loved it.  I cooked it in a square baking dish and found it to be done after only 35 minutes.  I've now added it to my recipe box so I'll never loose it and have already recommended it to a couple of people  :)

This was pretty good but I expected the cream cheese to melt into the casserole more. It stayed in big chunks, and it was too rich when you happened to get a whole mouthful of cream cheese.

The first time I made this recipe, I ended up with big chunks of cream cheese which tasted weird biting into.  I ended up throwing half of it out.  The second time, I beat the cream cheese until soft, then added the eggs and half-and-half so that it was more like a runny batter. I found that trick made for a more uniform taste, and there are never any leftovers anymore.

I generally use green pepper, mushrooms, onion and zucchini, but this recipe allows for a lot of flexibility.  I've subbed with red pepper, broccoli, tomatoes and spinach, all with great results.  I do make sure to dice whatever I'm using finely, using a little mini-processor.

Oh, and if I'm short on time, I skip the sauté.  Still tastes great.

I doubled this for a large group and it was devoured in no time.  The only change I made was I did not use any onion.

This is a fantastic brunch dish.  I converted the recipe for 12 people and it still fit in the 13x9 dish.  I mixed it the night before.  I added 12 eggs and only 2 pkgs of cream cheese.  I had trouble dicing the cream cheese so firming it in the freezer first might help.  I kept the oil for frying to the original amount.  I think feta cheese  would be delicious in it as well.

Delicious, but a fair amount of prep work. I left out the mushrooms, because my daughter will not eat anything with mushrooms in it. I have been eating the leftovers for luch cold, between two pieces of toast, and they are very good that way too. Thanks!

Yum! Loved this! Haven't tried it cold yet, but it was definately good served hot. I did as others suggested and used only one package cream cheese and increased the eggs to 9. I also added some tabasco sauce to the egg mixture. Turned out wonderful!

Tried this tonight for dinner.Served it with hash browns. I liked it, but would make some changes off the bat.. Too much cream cheese for my family. One 8oz brick is plenty. 7 eggs instead of 6. Adding bacon into the mixture would've made this a 5-star..Next time I will do that..But..very good..economical..Makes a big pan full!

I made it as instructed but added some tomatoes and a little ham.  It is a great base recipe though--I would think it would work w/anyt meats/veggies.  Many reviews said it lacked kick.  I don't think it is intended to be spicy, and you should sure be able to tell from the ingreds that it won't be. Anyway, really great, incredibly easy recipe.

EXCELLENT! Served this as part of a family brunch yesterday & it was delicious. I added a jar (about 1 cup) of chopped marinated artichoke hearts, & increased the amount of garlic to 3 large cloves & eggs to 9. I used only 1 & 1/2 packs of cream cheese.  Also I added some basil & dry mustard.  You could get very creative with this recipe & add just about any kind of veggie, meat, or seasoning & it would be delicious. A great way to use leftovers! It is equally good today, cold, for lunch!  :)

Completely bland. I followed the recipe exactly and had big globs of unmelted cream cheese. To save it, it would need more kick to it, some spices, less cheese, more eggs.

Made this for a brunch. Great vegetarian recipe but not much "zip". If I make it again I'll add some jalapenoes or something spicey.

This was a great recipe, although the description states "Hot or Cold."  I tried it right out of the oven and it was great.  I took it to a class at church cold and they hated it cold.  Everyone had to heat up their serving.  I added potatoes and chili powder (about 1/4 tsp. to the egg mixture).  I prepared the potatoes by boiling a large baking potato for 15 minutes.  I cooled the potato, sliced it and lightly browned the potato in olive oil.  I seasoned the potato with seasoned salt, pepper and chili powder.  Since I added the potato, I cut the bread cubes in half and only used two slices.  This was a great addition.  Again, this is a great recipe, but ...it was not good cold.

This was fantastic!  Served it for Christmas brunch and it was enjoyed by all.  The best parts were the little pockets of cream cheese.  Can't wait to reheat the leftovers!

Edit: My inlaws have appointed me the holiday chef from now on, so you know this one's a keeper!

Very good and satisfying.  Nice looking too.  I didn't have green bell pepper so used yellow instead.  I also didn't have zucchini, but added Italian sausage instead.  I also cut the cream cheese down to 1 8 oz package, but will try it with the full amount of cream cheese at some point, since it wasn't really strong.  I used a really herby bread, which went along with the other flavors really well.

This is good basic recipe and is much easier to serve for a large crowd than quiche as it cuts into nice solid squares.  I sauteed the veggies in a bit of cooking sherry instead of oil and ommitted the garlic.  As was suggested by another reviewer I cut back to 1-8 ounce package of cream cheese and that seemed plenty.  The cream cheese adds a surprisingly good flavor and texture.  I might try this again, but add ham or sausage and play with the veggies a bit.  It might be great with green chiles or salsa!  Also instead of the wheat bread I used 3 generous slices of Challah bread (which I cubed and left out overnight to dry a bit).  I sauteed the veggies the night before which maked this dish very quick to throw together the next morning.  Certainly a good staple for a brunch buffet.

This got rave reviews from our guests, most went back for a second helping!  I cut back on the veggies a little bit and added a pound of pork sausage cooked with a teaspoon of rubbed sage; cooked the veggies in the sausage drippings.

The flavor was good. I added about 5 oz. turkey sausage crumbles (Jimmy Dean) that come cooked. I swapped the cream for milk and cut back on the cheddar cheese. It was rich enough with all the cream cheese.

EXCELLENT!
I made a couple of adjustments and it turned out awesome. I used 8 Eggs instead of 6, only 1/2 as much cream because Zucchini and Mushrooms are “wet” vegetables, and only 1/2 as much Cream Cheese (and it was plenty).
I also chose to experiment with 1 tsp. Mrs. Dash + 1/2 tsp. Accent instead of Salt and Pepper.
And I only baked it for 45-50 min. at 350F.
AWESOME!

This is very good, especially with the cream cheese. The only thing I changed is adding some extra vegetables.  Baby spinach and extra peppers as in red, yellow and orange.  
Thank you for the recipe.  Will make it again.

It was good-took it to a potluck.  Recommend dicing cream cheese into small squares.  My cream cheese had softened and I wasn't careful about really dicing it.  Ended up looking  like toasted marshmallows!  Still very tasty - will make again.

This is my GOTO recipe to wow my friends, co-workers as well as bringing the STAR dish at every pot luck!   Camping, picnics have been a staple as well.   I've made this recipe dozens of times, and always start with  the base ingredients.  What I've changed are the veggie combinations as well as adding bacon to my creations.   Cheese...I've also mashed up different cheeses as well.    Examples:

Spinach, artichoke and mushroom.  
Bacon, spinach and red-pepper.  
Gruyere and/or Swiss cheese 2/3 - 1C additional to the cheddar and cream cheese (incredibly decadent and loved by everyone!).   
Different cheddar cheeses as well, just make sure they melt well.  
I also use a power mixer to blend cream cheese and eggs, never worrying about over-mixing.   
Sourdough bread, lightly toasted adds another level of flavor.  
Since I don't aways follow recipes 100%, the egg mixture's moisture content needs to be taken into account on how much cubed bread I add as well as how long I leave in the oven.  
My snobby French friends, who are fabulous cooks, have been blown away with my creations.   Don't throw the babby out with the bathwater - this is a brilliant, forgiving recipe to play around with!!

I made it for a brunch meeting and added two T. Mediterranean seasoning as I was sauteeing the vegetables, added some fresh asparagus I had and also cut the cream cheese in half, but added some leftover Boursin cheese pieces which gave some more flavor. Served with sour cream and fresh salsa toppings, it was a hit!

Very wholesome and a great way to use different types of veggies and adding the good protein of cheese and eggs. I followed the advice of adding fresh basil, turned really nice. One other change was the cream cheese...didn't have any, but still was good without it.

This was very good though too salty. The mix of vegetables as a general matter was terrific.  I did make some changes:  I quadrupled the garlic (a good call), increased the number of eggs, and used half the cream cheese, which seemed like plenty.  I really liked using bread in the frittata rather than my normal potatoes.  The casserole was good hot or cold but not nearly as good at room temperature.  

Dicing the cream cheese, even after time in the freezer, was incredibly frustrating. I finally wet my hands and pinched off tiny pieces. The pieces were too small and added nothing to the dish; larger ones might have been more interesting. 

I did make minor changes, but they didn't really change the recipe much.  I added some basil but could hardly taste it, and between the vegetables and the cheddar, the frittata is pretty tasty as it is, at least with a lot more garlic.  I used red pepper instead of green (don't like green pepper) and also added some chopped tomato to the vegetable mixture.  Next time I will try less cheese and more herbs -- and may skip the salt entirely.  I might also omit the cream cheese.

Made this yesterday as a last-minute addition to a summer family dinner. I have lots of garden zucchini so this was just the right dish. I made it as directed except substituted red pepper for the green for added color. I also added about 4 slices of chopped bacon. I halved the recipe and baked in a glass pie plate. Added some sliced garden tomatoes on top for more color. Baked about 35 minutes. Well received! Leftovers were good for breakfast too.

I read through the reviews and took other people's advice. Only added one package of cream cheese and used 9 eggs.  Took it to Easter brunch with a side of link sausages and everyone loved it!

Made it a 2nd time following the ingredients and instructions and it actually tasted even better!   Only because I didn't have any more than the recipe called for but still only used 1 package of cream cheese.

Substituted broccoli stalks for the green pepper, increased the eggs to 9 and cut the cream cheese in half. It was great hot and cold!

This was hit! Everyone loved it at a birthday brunch party. I halfed the cream cheese as well &  I placed it in the freezer for a couple minutes so it would cube easier. I made it with cooked, diced potatoes instead of bread & it was wonderful with the cream cheese...like a sour cream & baked potato taste.  I used 10 eggs and 1/3 cup half & half as another reviewer suggested. I will definitely make this again!

Yum! Modifications based on what I had on hand: 9 eggs, spinach instead of zucchini, sweet yellow & red peppers instead of green pepper, leeks instead of onions, only 1 8 oz. package of cream cheese, swiss instead of cheddar. Added basil and tarragon. A great vegetarian dish, even for those non-vegetarians. The cubed bread helped bulk it up; my hubby didn't even realize it was in there!

Excellent recipe, though I made a few changes. I used 10 eggs, only 1 package of 1/3 fat cream cheese, added spinach, and added a bit of italian seasoning. I'm sure it would be excellent as is, but I didn't want so much cream cheese to keep it healthier. This would be awesome with any veggies!

Amazing recipe. Adapted it so I could use what I had on hand. No mushrooms, used one large log of goat cheese instead of cream cheese and pepper jack instead of cheddar. Used gluten free bread ^_^. Thinly sliced zucchini and tomato rounds with some reserved goat cheese on top with a bit of s&p & evoo before baking made for a lovely presentation. Boyfriend was totally impressed. p.s. didn't add more eggs or garlic like some others did.

I thought this was great.  Instead of using mushrooms I used asparagus and I used no garlic, because I had very little on hand.  It was very easy to make and is one of the best meals I have ever made.

This is a great recipe! I served this with a Caesar's salad last night for dinner and it was a hit (except with my teenage son, who doesn't like anything that's egg-y or mushroom-y, so that kind of leaves this dish out) I upped the garlic a bit, but that's just a personal preference.  This would also definitely work as a brunch dish served with bacon or sausage and fresh fruit.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch for my mom and my boyfriend's mom (and my boyfriend) and it was a really bit hit. It's great as it is but next time I will probably add more vegetables because I love them and there's definitely room for them. I highly recommend this.  My boyfriend's mom already asked me for the recipe.

This turned out great, even with substantial substitutions.  I only used 8 oz cream cheese (all I had), used broccoli and carrots in lieu of all other veggies, added ham, added 3 eggs based on other reviews, used seasoned salt in place of plain and a few shakes of dry mustard.  I also used extra sharp cheddar for the cheese.  Cooked in 8x11 glass dish for 40 min.  Was very sceptical when I put in dish since it didn't look "eggy" enough to hold together, but it turned out great.  Even my husband, who has hated every frittata I've ever made, loved this.  I also loved it,and it was easy since I did the veggies in the microwave.  What a great recipe, easy to "dress up" or "dress down" for any occasion by selecting different vegetables and meat!

I followed everything except the vegetables. Used: red pepper, carrot, asparagus, onion, and green chilli pepper. Very good. I think this would work with most any veggies.

This Frittata was outstanding.  I only added one package of cream cheese, and added 2 garlic and onion bagels cut up instead of the 4 piece of bread.  It was really good, and turned out light and fluffy.  I also added 2 extra eggs and used skim evaporated milk.  Wonderful!!

Excellent recipe. Very tasty. Next time I make it I will try to lighten it up a little by using low fat alternatives to the cheese & cream. I thought it was very easy to put together.  I chopped all the veggies the night before and threw it all together the next morning before work.
