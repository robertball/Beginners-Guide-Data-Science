This variation on a spice cake is moist and delicious and bursting with flavor. My picky husband was ready to write off anything with tomato soup as an ingredient but declared it absolutely wonderful after the first bite. If you like spice cake you must give this a try!

Baked this cake yesterday and it really was very good. Moist and flavoursome and quite economical. This is certainly one I will make again and again as my husband says it is his sort of cake!

I cut this recipe in half so I could make muffins for a outing I had planned for today. Instead of shortening I used half melted butter and half homemade organic applesauce. I used whole wheat white flour instead of AP flour. I had a feeling that this might need a little more liquid than it called for--I ended up adding an egg and a quarter cup buttermilk. These turned out quite well--though way too heavy on the cloves. I've made tomato soup cake before so it's a favorite of mine (and almost anyone else who knows me) and the smell of this recipe while baking? Wow! I really don't notice the tomatoey taste but again I've made tomato soup cake before. It's no different than any other spice cake really. It's just got a twang that really makes you say "That's different!" Great way to use up tomato soup! Just watch the amount of cloves you use. A sprinkle is plenty. NOTE: I got 12 muffins out of a half recipe. 350 for 20 minutes was the perfect baking time for me.

Funny My husband could hardly wait for me to make this cake. He said his great grandmother used to make it all the time. It is one of his favorites.

very heavy cake. Not hard to tell it is a depression era recipe. I liked the spices to give it some other taste other than tomato soup. I like it but my husband refuses to eat it.

I found this cake to be quite dry. Followed the recipe a given but seems to need more liquid. I was surprised that there were no eggs in recipe.

Surprisingly wonderful! Tomato soup is an odd item for a cake ingredient in fact I didn't tell anyone until after they raved about it. I substituted milk for the water and used yogurt covered raisins (didn't have plain)- they added an extra little sweetness to it. I also glazed it using the same spices with confectioners sugar adding flavored coffee as the liquid. I would suggest using a 12 cup bundt pan.

I haven't had tomato soup cake since I was a kid. Mine turned out moist and quite tasty I didn't notice any obvious tomato soup taste and the spices are perfect. I used butter-flavoured shortening. I'd definitely make it again.

Really good. No tomato taste at all. I took it to work and it was quite popular. A little dry considering the amount of butter and soup and water but that's not a big deal. The raisins help. I will be making this again. And again.

This cake has a nice texture and I really liked the spices but be warned if you have sensitive taste buds you WILL taste the tomato soup. To me it had a strong aftertaste and the tomato-y taste did not complement the other flavors very well.
