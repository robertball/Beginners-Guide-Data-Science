These are about to go in the oven, so I can't comment on the taste quite yet.  However, I learned a few things about the prep work.  First of all, do NOT let the peanut butter/jam mixture cool even a little before you add the pork to it.  You want it pretty runny, and the peanut butter will firm up fast, making it really hard to coat the pork (and, in turn, hard to coat with the crumb mixture.)  Use a big enough pan that you can add all the pork right away.  Also, I think it would be much easier to put the crumb mixture into a pie pan or something similar instead of in a zip-lock bag.  When I tried to toss the pork pieces in the bag, they stuck together and to themselves, so not all sides got coated evenly. Edit: These turned out pretty good, taste-wise.  A lot of the peanut butter and crumb mixture fell off, but what we did get tasted good.

I agree this recipe was a bit more work than I had anticipated. I skipped the coconut since I didn't have and am not a huge fan but the overall taste was great--very similar to dishes I have gotten at Thai restaurants.

Little more labor than I was expecting.  I did like the end product.  The combination of flavors sound odd, but taste great.  He doesn't like coconut and liked these.   Actually just served them with barbecue sauce mixed with perserves as a dip.
