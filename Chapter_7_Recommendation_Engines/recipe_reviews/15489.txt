These cookies were great!  I didn't change a thing, and they were just perfect.  I got about 36 average-sized cookies out of this recipe, and each one was delectable.  I have tried other recipes which include brown sugar, and have determined that brown sugar has too bold a flavor for the delicate white chocolate and macadamia nuts.  Trust me-- this recipe is absolutely fabulous.

UPDATE:  My husband and I love these cookies so much that we make the dough, freeze the uncooked dough balls on a cookie sheet, put them in a zip-lock bag, and keep a supply handy at all times.  Whenever we crave them, we'll pop a few out of the bag and bake at 350 for about 15-18 minutes.  Awesome.

Great base recipe - I only made minor adjustments to make them delicious. First, I doubled the recipe excep kept the chocolate/nuts measurements the same. Second, I made it 1 tbsp vanilla. Third, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Then I chilled the dough for about 10-15 min before scooping. I baked at 350 for 10 min in my oven until the edges were just brown. They didn't spread much at all, weren't too cakey, and were absolutely devine the next day.

Very good cookies. I tested two different cookie sheets and they turned out soft and moist on the airbake cookie sheet, and on the dark metal cookie sheet they didn't spread at all and turned out crunchy.

HOLY 5 STARS!!!!!!  Yum!!  I doubled the recipe- but used 12oz of white chips and about 10oz of macadamia nuts!  This is the best white chocolate macadamia nut cookie recipe I've ever used- and I've tried many because these are my husband's favorite kind of cookie!  Thanks so much!!

I didn't try these because they're not really my thing--white chocolate is just too sweet for me. But I did notice when making these that there seemed to be very little dough for the amount of white chocolate and nuts.  Sure enough, hubs loved 'em, but said the amount of chocolate is just right but there were too many nuts, and he could see only using half the amount called for. In spite of too many nuts, however, he deemed these moist, yet chewy, and very, very good. (And then he held his two thumbs up)

My son was looking for the "Subway" cookies for his birthday.  He made them himself and they are just what he was looking for - his classmates agreed.  We followed the other comments and doubled the recipe but not the nuts and chocolate.  MMMMM.  Thank you for sharing. Only 8 minutes is all they need.

The hubby dislikes nuts in his cookies, so I added chocolate raspberry morsels along with the white chocolate chips, and then at the last minute stuck in 1/4 cup cocoa powder.  Suddenly we have a new favorite cookie to make.  The chocolate raspberry mixed with creamy white chocolate is like.. wicked good.  Beyond the fact that I added to the recipe, the recipe itself is very good.  Made puffy, crisp on the outside, chewy tender on the inside cookies.  The batter seems too dry - but trust me, it works!  Awesome!

These were great. I made bigger cookies (I got 19 out of the recipe) and had to cook them an extra 3 minutes. I have no idea how anyone could get 4 dozen cookies from this recipe. Also, I used slightly less nuts then the recipe called for and white chocolate chips instead of chopped chunks. I had my first cookie when it was warm but it was much better the next day when it had completely cooled. It seemed to have a better flavor and texture. The only thing I didn't like was that the chips browned on the bottom of the cookie so they didn't look too pretty looking at them from the bottom.

Nice light color that I was looking for.  I like these better than the recipe with brown sugar.  It is great with premium white chocolate.  These cookies are just about perfect. Makes about 24 medium cookies.

These are very good.  Will look no further.  I like that there is no brown sugar so the cookies stay white.

OH my word these are amazing! These cookies made me person of the month at my house. They never even made it to the cooling rack! The first time I made them 3 yrs ago nobody seemed impressed so I made some changes according others' suggestions: used unsalted butter, doubled the measurements for the dough keeping the white chocolate and nuts measurements as is, chilled dough for 45 min before baking and allowed cookies to cool on pan after baking for 8 min. They were perfect, crispy on edges and chewy all throughout.

My husband was bellyaching about how I never make him anything with white sugar/white flour anymore just for him. I rooted around in my freezer/cupboards and came up with the ingredients for this. I followed exact only doubling the amount of white chocolate (I used chips) because I wanted to finish up a package I had in my freezer. 9 minutes at 375* made a perfect cookie. He loved them. Ate half in one sitting. Got sick. Serves him right.

Simply spectacular cookies. I gave these as a gift at Christmas time and they were gobbled up in a matter of hours! I didn't change a thing; used Ghiradelli white chocolate and chopped the macadamia nuts by hand. Be careful not to over cook these! Great recipe, a new family favorite.

These were very good! They had the nicest lightest crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. I doubled this recipe with a couple of adjustments. I used less salt since the nuts were salted, I used a 12 oz bag of white chips, an 8oz bag of chopped macadamia nuts and added 1 C. of lightly toasted coconut. I chilled the dough for about 1/2 hour, used a small cookie scooper and baked them for about 9-10 minutes at 325'. I garnished the tops before baking with coconut/chips/nuts I had set aside. They are a rich cookie and very sweet. Even my Husband won't stop eating them, and he's not a huge fan of coconut!

First batch spread WAY to much.  After refrigerating they were ok, but not the best I've tasted.  Another recipe I've tried has butter and shortening,, I prefer that one.

I followed the recipe only leaving the white chocolate as is. I baked each batch for 8 minutes ending with 25 perfect cookies. These cookies are moist, chewy, and very tasty. I can taste the rich white chocolate and macadamia nuts in every bite..Mmmm.  Best of all they have the nice light color that I was looking for! These lovely, decadent cookies would be nice to give as gifts!

I have made a wide variety of cookies from here before, but this is by far the best! The cookies are not flat and they come out perfect! I baked at 350 and I added 1/8 cup more flour as someone else recommended. This time I used a regular cookie sheet instead of an insulated one. Perfection with this one!

I made these vegan for my son who is egg and dairy intolerant. I subbed Earth Balance Margarine for the butter and egg replacer (EnerG) for the egg. I also followed the advice of others and used half the amount of nuts and white chocolate chips and the result was super!

These were wonderful cookies.  As others have said, though, there were way too many nuts and chips.  I doubled my batch but used the same number of nuts and chips and it was *still* a bit much, though not nearly as much as if I had used the amount stated!  Other than that, I will definitely use this recipe again.

These cookies are just as good as the Subway white chocolate cookies, if not better (homemade). I use a full 16 oz bag of white chocolate, and 4-6 oz macadamia nuts. Super easy, and always a hit! They are usually gone in a matter of days at our house!!

I followed this recipe exactly. Cookies were too dry, didn't spread in the oven and were rock hard next week. I will not use this recipe again.  :(

Very tasty! I made a few batches and experimented each time with getting it just right. They've quickly become legendary. As suggested by other reviewers, I halved the amount of chocolate and nuts. It is still perfectly sweet. I also added an eighth of a cup more flour (just used half of a quarter cup) to give it more form so the edges don't get so thin and to keep the cookies from being floppy and fragile. With this recipe, I created about 14 cookies. I also chill the dough, shape the balls and pack them really tightly, re-chill them, then bake them on my baking stone for about 15 minutes. the chilling and packing with the extra flour too seems to prevent the spreading and create a perfect cookie shape. and i love to freeze the dough and bake fresh ones as needed.

These were wonderful.  I agree with the other reviews who said to cut the nuts and the chocolate in half, though - I only used about 3 oz. chopped macadamia nuts and 1 cup of white chocolate chips, and this was more than enough.  The dough is fabulous and I'm sure I'll be making these again.

Five stars just doesn't do this recipe justice!  As fast as these were made, they were gone!  My cookies didn't look like the picture, but actually looked just like the ones you'd find at Subway.  And tasted just as good, if not better!  I didn't change much, just omitted the salt and used unsalted butter.  I'm also not sure if I used the same amount of chips and nuts, because I just used an 8 ounce bag mix of the two from Hershey's, which was perfect.  Otherwise, I did everything as the recipe calls for.  I agree to take them out when they become slightly golden brown on the edges.  When I took them out of the oven after 9 minutes, I let the heat from the cookie sheet cook it the rest of the way and they finished cooking perfectly.  Absolutely divine and definitely a keeper!  Yummy!

Very good!  I was worried that they wouldn't be chewy, because of the lack of brown sugar, but they had a perfect texture- lightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Baked for 8 minutes.  I used a big 8oz. hunk of Ghiradeli white chocolate that I chopped and 1 cup of macadamia nuts, chopped.  I cut the salt in half.  Used mostly whole wheat pastry flour.  So good!

These were great!  Tasted just like the white chocolate macadamia nut cookies you get at the malls.  I used white chocolate chips and they didn't melt much at all, so next time I'll use the solid type, and chop it. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful! Hubby is a happy man! lol Only change I made was add a whole TBS of Vanilla extract (I always add more than the recipe calls for- just a personal preference for our home). Thank you so much for sharing!

These cookies are amazing!  I even love eating the cookie dough.  I refrigerated my dough for half an hour.  They didn't spread very much or puff up, so I recommend making tablespoon size balls (the size of a ping pong ball) and flatten them with a spoon or even your fingers.  

I recommend adding coconut.  I took the half the batter and added shredded coconuts.  It ended up taking delicious!

Made these cookies as a part of Christmas cookie give away.  Everyone loved these cookies.  I may try to make them with margarine next time so cookies won't be so thin.

This has become a favourite to make for friends etc.  I use whole wheat flour and only 1/2 cup of sugar.  I used dark chocolate chunks so it was not very sweet.  Just right and not all that bad for you with a small amount of sugar and whole wheat flour.  Less guilt to endulge!  Thanks.  Very easy.

First, this really is not a true cookie in my opinion. It's very cakey in texture, dry and they do not spread. My husband did not mind the way they turned out but this is not what I was looking for.

We really liked these. I only had 3 oz of Macadamia Nuts, but it was still good. The only problem I had was the middle was not quite cooked when the bottoms were almost burnt. I would probably decrease the oven temperature to 350 next time?

It wasn't clear whether the macadamia nuts should be salted or not, so I washed and dried the salted ones I had on hand and skimped on the salt just in case (best not to over do on salt!).  They turned out great!  I served them at an after dinner party with friends with pineapple margaritas and they were a hit!  Thanks!

All I can say is WOW! I followed the recipe except used white chocolate chips instead of a bar and the only thing I can suggest is doubling this recipe because it is amazing and this is coming from the most picky of eaters. This is a must try recipe!!!

These are very, very good!  One piece of advice is to watch the salt.  The nuts I used were salted, so it was a bit too much with the teaspoon of salt in the recipe.  The next time I make these I will omit the salt if I use salted nuts.   Love the texture - nice!

These are by far the best cookies I have ever made. That is saying a lot too because I bake about once a week.  I followed the recipe exactly and had none of the "texture" issues that the other reviewers have mentioned.  These cookies were just a little crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside. I got about 40 cookies and I baked them for about 9 minutes. Use room temperature butter(do not melt before creaming with the sugar).  Also, the nut/chocolate amounts were perfect for our tastes. My husband will not leave them alone, and my co-workers say it is the best cookie they've ever tasted. Make these cookies, you will not regret it! They are better than subway or any other commercial cookie out there.

My brother's fiancé asked me to bake his and hers favorite cookies for their wedding.  Her favorite was white chocolate macadamia nut, which I had never made before.  After reading through different recipes on this site I chose this recipe and the "White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies III" recipe to try.  This was a very good cookie but still didn't beat the other one in multiple taste tests.  Ultimately, the fiancé choose the other one.  For this recipe I cut the chocolate and nuts and chilled the batter as other reviews had advised.  They still spread a little.  I thought that they were awfully rich with a strong taste of salt.  I undercooked this just a bit to keep them chewy.  Still a great recipe but I’d suggest trying recipe number III.

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and followed it exactly - the cookies came out wonderfully! Everyone in my family really enjoyed them and is clamoring for more. I'll be making these again really soon...might play around with the proportion of white chocolate (adding less), but other than that, this recipe comes out perfectly without doing anything to it - great for people like me, who only have time to bake once in a while but still want it to come out well right away!

This recipe was pretty good, but I found that the dough did better after being refrigerated for a little while and making normal Tbsp. sized cookies over making larger cookies.

The first time I made these they were fabulous. Everyone at work raved about them. The second time they came out very flat, browned and undercooked. I realized that I had used 1 cup of butter, which most cookie recipes call for, by mistake. Made them correctly the next time and....FABULOUS.

Figured since I was sitting here in heaven eating a cookie, I should write my review!  Followed the directions completely, except substituted walnuts for the macadamia nuts ($2.59 vs $7.99) and I must say, I like them even better with the walnuts!

Not sure what I did wrong (or right lol) but my cookies didn't spread at all.  I rolled them into balls before putting them on the cookie sheet and 10 minutes was PERFECT for them!

Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Yummy! Made this exactly to recipe and they were a hit with hubby. Personal preference would have us tinker with the amounts of white chocolate and nuts next time, but this is a great recipe as is. Thanks!

These cookies turned out GREAT!  Only thing I changed was 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.

2 statements...SOOOOO EASY and SOOOO Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They came out chewy and gooey and lasted that way until they were all gone. I made them for my Boyfriend to take on a trip, and he just loved them.

I made these for a friend's birthday -- a special request. They were a huge hit! I was surprised that there seemed to be so little batter compared to the amount of nuts/chocolate, but it made sense after they were baked to seven stages of delicious! I didn't change a thing in the recipe -- good stuff!

Honestly I have to give this recipe a 10 star review because I have made these several times in different variations but it's the base recipe that scores so well!!  thank you so much for this recipe. :) my daughter is anaphylactic to macadamia nuts so we never use them in the recipe, however we follow exactly other than that. We have, on one occasion replaced the white chocolate chips with peppermint chips from Andes and those cookies are amazing too.  Thanks again!!

I made these for an awards ceremony for some of my students (grades 7-12) and they devoured them. There wasn't a single one left. My husband and I ate the few that broke when I moved them to the rack (they were very soft when hot), and we thought they were great. I made the recipe exactly as written.

Really really yummy. I triple the recipe and it works well! I made the following changes:
1. Cut down sugar by about 1-2 TBSP
2. Cut down the White Choc (only put about 6 OZ) and Macadamia nuts (only put about 5 OZ)

These cookies are really chunky. Because of the high fat content, they tend to spread out a lot so refrigerating the dough is a must.

Not a great cookie IMO. I followed the reviewers who cut the chocolate and nuts in half. I would say that gives about the right amount of nuts, but not nearly enough chocolate. So if I did this again, I'd use 8oz chocolate, 4 oz nuts. But next time I'll try a recipe with brown sugar and almond extract; this cookies just tasted like butter to me, no other flavor.

spread out a little too much - next time try chilling the dough, and maybe a little more vanilla or some cinnamon

Soooo yummy!  Flavor & texture is great, slightly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  But I found the recipe to need a little tweeking.  Like many others I doubled the recipe but kept the choc chip & nut amounts the same.  The first batch I pulled out after 8 minutes because they were starting to brown, but they were still gooey in the center.  So I lowered the temp to 350 and baked for 10 minutes...perfection!

I make this as one big cookie and give it to my mother-in-law for her birthday every year.  She certainly doesn't share, seriously she eats the entire thing.  I like to add more white chocolate chips than the recipe calls for.  This is buttery and tasty! Best cookie I've ever made.

This cookie is very flavorful, moist and delicious. Per other reviews, I double everything except the nuts(had 7oz jar) and white chcolate(had 12oz). I had no problem with the cookie flattening, I made mine in balls and slightly flattened before putting in oven. I did put the dough in the refrig while making them. These cookies are so delicious!!! This will be my go to cookie! Thanks Maureen for sharing!

The BEST white chocolate macadamia nut cookie I have EVER ate in my life!!!!!  The only thing I did different is add 1/4 cup of brickle to the batter because I have had other gourmet cookies that were made that way.  I will NEVER make another recipe for white chocolate macadamia cookies ever again!  I cooked mine for about 13 minutes and they were perfect!!!

this cookie was pretty good. i did like many others and doubled the recipe and eyeballed the nuts and white chocolate. i also wanted a chewier cookie so i melted the butter. i did 1/4 c scoops baked at room temperature and got 14 large cookies. probably could've gotten a couple more if you add in the dough i ate raw.(-___-) the cookies looked fantastic. slightly golden around the edge, nice white top. i found the dough a little salty so ill probably cut back on some of the salt/baking soda and add a little more vanilla for flavor next time.

These were pretty good. I did the recipe for the most part as written except I added a splash more vanilla extract. I also used walnuts instead of macadamia nuts because it's what I had on hand. I also did like someone else and put the dough in the refrigerator for about 20 mins before going on the cookie sheet. These made 15 big cookies for me. I'm looking forward to making these again except with the macadamia nuts, although the walnuts tasted great :-)

I try to make recipes exactly as written, but used 1/2 margarine and 1/2 butter because that is what I had available. They turned out awesome, cannot imagine being any better with all butter.  Will be adding these to my regular Christmas cookie platter!

I like my cookies a little less cakey, but I still loved the soft texture. They melt in your mouth. I doubled the recipe and used unsalted macadamia nuts. I love big chunks so I only cut them in half.

I halved the chips and nuts, and used a mix of plain roasted and honey roasted macadamias, but followed the rest. Taste wise these are 5 stars, but i rated a 4 because i had some problems with the textures. I put my first batch in for about 11 minutes or so, and they came out looking too dark, although the texture was soft and chewy, most of the white chocolate chips had sunk to the bottom and caramelized, so it tasted like little crunchy bits of burnt sugar instead of milky white chocolate.  My second batch i baked for about 8-9 minutes, which resulted in golden brown cookies but were again too soft: they broke apart at the slightest pressure. The taste was awesome though, so it's worth trying again. Next time: i like crispier cookies so i will try either replacing the egg with milk, or bake 10-11 mins at a  lower temp to see if i can get a crispier cookie. I will increase the nuts to around three quarters of the original but keep the white chocolate chips at the halved amount, and even then it was slightly too sweet, so i might reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup. Also, the cookies will spread, i got about 20 roughly 3" diameter cookies out of mine using about a tablespn of dough each, next time i will do them half the size to get bite sized cookies.
*edited 16/8/10- changed to 5 stars because my cousin just paid me twenty bucks to make a new batch for him.

Just finished making a batch of these cookies...they are soooo good!  They baked really big on my airbake sheet; the few I put on a regular baking sheet didn't get as big and burned a little on the bottoms.  I used Ghirardelli white chocolate bars.  Also, I used a stick of unsalted butter that I did not bother to bring to room temperature since it appears a lot of people had trouble with spreading.  I was able to get 40 cookies with the recipe as written; using a medium cookie dough scoop, and got a generous size cookie out of it.  A keeper recipe...thank you.

I made these cookies on the large side, for a special event.  I used the "large scoop" from Pamp Chef and I cooked them for 20 minutes on 350.  They were perfect.  This is a fantastic recipe.  One thing I did, which I won't do again, is I purchased a large chunk of Ghiridelli white chocolate from Trader Joe's.  I ran it through my food processor to chop it (to save time).  Well... it doesn't work well and chopped everything too small.  It would have been better if I just chopped with a kitchen knife instead.  I DEFINITELY recommend buying this chunk of chocolate/white chocolate though.  Its all good... they taste fantastic with a little bit of chocolate in every bite.  I will defintely make this recipe again!

I only gave it 4 stars because I did not follow the recipe exact.  I basically doubled all the ingredients except the white chocolate and the macadamia nuts. I baked at 375 for 9 minutes.  I am not a fan of white chocolate, but wanted to get rid of my white chocolate chips.  I took these to a family reunion (130 people) and I was amazed at how many people were raving about them.  Those Iowa wives can really bake good stuff, so when they love something you have baked, you know it has to be good.  I was asked by several for the recipe.

I love love these cookies!  People complained about having too many nuts or white chocolate chips, I just poured in how much i wanted based on the texture and they turned out perfect! My husband has asked me many times to make these again.  They came out perfect!

These were a HUGE hit! Perfectly chewy and delicious, well-written recipe, pretty quick and easy to prep. I doubled the recipe and used an 11 oz bag of Ghiradelli white chocolate chips and a few handfuls of chopped macadamia nuts and it was good. Would recommend keeping the chunks of nuts a little larger (mine got a little small so there wasn't as much noticeable crunch). Great recipe!

They turned out really flat, and the ratio between dough and chocolate chips/nuts was off. I ended up doubling the dough part of the recipe, but they still didn't turn out all that hot.

I gave this recipe only three stars because there is another recipe on here "White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies II" that I feel are much better.  These were not as satisfying as the other cookies.  I think I tend to prefer brown sugar in my cookies, these didn't call for it - the other ones do, I think the other ones had a much better result.  I would definately NOT make this recipe again.

WOW...these were great.  I used Mauna Loa Macadamia nuts from Wal-mart so these had sea salt on them....so cut back on salt in recipe.  To make them like Subway's scoop and bake right away, but to make them thicker, add 1/2 cup coconut and refridgerate for at least 30 miniutes before scooping and baking.  Either way they were great!  Thanks for the best macadamia nut cookies

Um, maybe my nuts weren't very good, but I didn't like these.  I wanted something like subway makes and this wasn't it.  Doubled the ingredients, except for chips and nuts. My husband said they were ok, so that's why I gave 3 stars instead of 2.

These cookies were great.  I doubled everything except for the nuts and the white chocolate chips.  I thought there was plenty of each in my double batch and wouldn't have wanted more.   They were cooked for 7 minutes which darkened the bottom, crisped the edges and left the middle soft and chewy.  These cookies are very sweet!  I am a fan of sweet but they were almost too sweet.  That's a good thing though because I wasn't able to eat a dozen in one sitting!

You could easily half the chocolate and nuts in this recipe... I also found the dough was way too dry, but I'm also in Edmonton in the middle of the coldest, driest winter in the past couple of years.  I wasn't impressed with the flavour however, so I think I'll keep looking for another recipe.  Sorry!

These turned out pretty good - I'm going to look for a better recipe, but these did the trick, my husband liked them (that's all that matters).  I couldn't find unsalted macadamia nuts, so I got the salted ones & rinsed them in cold water - sounds kinda silly, but it worked.

These were perfect!!! Macadamia nuts are extremely expensive here, it would have cost me $20 so I used just under half the amount. I experimented with different sized cookies and they were all awesome. Definately comparable to Subway. Everyone who tried them said they were terribly addictive! Thanks so much!!

These cookies came out wonderfully!  And I am very very bad at baking cookies.  Thanks for the suggestions on pulling them out as soon as the edges turn golden.

Also, definitely make sure your butter is not melted, but rather just room temperature.  

I also put the dough in the fridge between batches.

I used an airbake pan with a silpat on top.

These were absolutely delicious. There is a little deli near us that bakes these fresh everyday. This recipe was just as good as theirs. I enjoy a crispy outside and chewey inside. I accomplished this by baking for 12 minutes.I didn't give the recipe a 5 because I prefer my cookies to become golden brown and these didn't.

These are just superb.  I had lots of pecans on hand, and used lots of those instead of macadamia nuts.   They didn't spread out too much, and were perfect.  Don't overbake.

I followed the recipe exactly the way it said, except for that I got a little greedy and put 12 scoops on a medium cookies sheet and that smooshed everything.  The next round, I only put 6 on the sheet and they still turned out pretty flat.  They didn't look like the picture.  But after all that, they tasted good.  They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It sucks that the presentation wasn't nicer because I'm making these for someone else.

A big hit every time I make them; also, don't try to fiddle with the amount of nuts or chocolate-- the recipe truly is just right.

These cookies are a real treat for white chocolate lovers. Containing only white sugar, they are a bit on the crispy side (like I love them). I usually don't like nuts in my cookies, but I had macadamia that I had to use, and now that I tasted them this way, I'll never cut back on nuts in this recipe. I used good quality white chocolate that I chopped by myself to be sure I'll get large chunks in the cookies. I like my cookies to be large, so I drop heaping tablespoons and baked them for about 15 minutes.

What a great recipe!  I loved how soft they came out.  I used heaping spoonfulls of dough and this recipe only made 2 dozen cookies.   I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract and it really added to the flavor.

These were ok. The "missing" brown sugar made these taste more like a sugar cookie with macadamias and white chocolate pieces. I did reduce the heat to 325 and then increased the heat to 375 to reduce scorching of the white chocolate pieces. Not quite what I was looking for....thanks anyway!

Omg amazing!!!  These are so great I had to hide them from the husband so he wouldn't demolish them. Only thing I changed was made them a little bigger (1/4 cup each) as my family likes bigger cookies but other than that, PERFECT!! Thank you so much...

The cookies burned on the bottom before cooking thoroughly and I like them soft.  Overall, expensive to make and the family did not care for them.

Was looking for a Holiday cookie to make for my family and this was the one!  It was delicious but I added dried cranberries to add a little holiday color and tartness, then sprinkled the top of the cookies lightly with green, white & red fine sugar while warm. Everyone was curious to try them because they looked so pretty and they tasted even better!!!

This was my first attempt at white choc. mac. nut cookies. I made the recipe as written, and they were too sweet for my taste. Plus, I don't know how you can get 4 dozen cookies out of 1 1/4 cups of flour; but maybe we just like our cookies bigger than the average person! :)

No way this makes 4 dozen, but they are very good. As written, there is way too much chocolate/nuts for the dough. Either double the dough or half the choc. and nuts. Also, keep a close eye on them while baking.  They seem to go from underbaked to burnt on the bottom vey quickly. Mine took 8 minutes at 350.

I loved these cookies! I didn't change a thing. After the first batch came out, I decided to make a second batch but I was running too low on macadamia nuts so I just used the same cookie batter and added bacon and dark chocolate chips into it. I find that the cookies didn't spread at all when I put them onto the tray as balls, so I flattened the rest out with my hands. They taste just like the Subway cookies!!

These proportions really did not work for me. The dough was way too soft and buttery - despite refrigerating it for several hours. the cookies spread everywhere, and there was too much macadamia nut/white chocolate for the amount of dough this recipe creates.

These cookies were great.  They were mostly chocolate and nuts, with very little "cookie batter".  I enjoyed the chunks of flavor, but I missed the chewy cookie part.  On the second time making this recipe, I the advice of other reviewers and doubled the amount of every ingredient with the exception of the chocolate and nuts.  This provided the chewy cookie part I was missing that would have increased my rating to 5 stars.  Everyone loves these!

STOP! You found it! I have been making white chocolate macadamia nut cookies for years, but I've always just put them in regular chocolate chip cookies and omitted the milk or semi sweet chips. Holy cow had I been missing out! I made a double batch but did not double the nuts (didn't have enough) and still tastes amazing. I never would have thought to find a recipe without the brown sugar to find the desired result. No longer will I purchase my favorite cookie - now I can make them! Now to not eat them all before company arrives tomorrow....

Oh my gosh.  These things are just amazing.  I made them with mac nuts that I purchased on vacation in Hawaii.  These helped to ease the pain of not being in Hawaii anymore!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Mine took a few more minutes to cook. I've made them twice now, one time was for an Easter party.  Everyone loved them!

I actually don't like white choc macadamia nut cookies usually, but they are my husband's favorite type of cookie, and i found this recipe and made him these for a valentine's day dessert and he absolutely loved them, and i have to admit i actually liked them too. first macadamia nut cookie recipe i've come across that i liked too. the only thing i changed was i put just a teensy bit more vanilla extract in and that was it. they were awesome :)

These are fabulous... I made them to give away as gifts and my DH was seriously upset with me as he wanted them all to himself!  I made exactly as written, but my newer electric stove tends to run hot so I took them out at 8 minutes... Highly recommend!

These are good, but way too many nuts for my taste. The large amount of macadamias make it so the dough doesn't spread much at all while cooking, which also makes it really difficult to tell if the cookies are done yet.  If you like a soft, chewy cookie, I highly recommend using about half as many nuts in the recipe.

Other than cutting the amount of nuts and chocolate chips in half, I followed the recipe as listed and made these at my bakery today.   I loved the taste and the customers said the recipe was a keeper.  I only wish the cookies didn't spread so much.  I will try and chill the cookie dough next time to see if it helps with the spreading.

These were yummy. I added 2oz of chopped semi-sweet chocolate. Also, I used salted nutts? They were what I had, and I didn't realize until after the cookies were baked. I'm not so sure that you should use salted nuts, because these cookies did not taste like "Subway cookies" They were good though.

Incredible cookies!  Follow as is.  May want to reduce the sweets a bit if you're sweet tooth is sensitive.

I haven't tasted the baked cookies yet, but I made a double batch with a few modifications.  I doubled everything except for the vanilla (did 1 TB), white chocolate (12 oz bag of white chocolate chips), and nuts (10 oz chopped).  The dough is quite tasty and made 7.5 dozen cookies (I portioned the raw dough out and froze it, to bake later).  I will update this review when we have tried the baked cookies!
UPDATE: Maybe it's because I was baking the dough from a frozen state, but they didn't spread much at all.  The flavor was okay, but not amazing.  I like the dough better than the cooked cookies!  My husband says the cookies are a hit at work though.

Awesome cookie! I doubled the batter and increased the white chocolate to 12 ounces and the macadamia nuts to 10 ounces. Baked for exactly 9 minutes - they came out perfectly! Made approximately 35 cookies based on dropping by rounded tablespoon (I like my cookies big). Definitely another keeper.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it was DEEEELICIOUS!  But it was a little on the sweet side.  Yum Yum!  I had to kind of eyeball the nuts because I didn't get them in the jar (here in Canada macadamia nuts are hard to come by - of course they are my favorite!) - I only had a baking of pre-chopped nuts that a friend brought me from the States, so I used 1/2 a cup.  Thank you!

Excellent!!! I doubled the recipe but did not have enough nuts, so I used 6oz of nuts and 1/2 a bag of white chocolate chips. The best WCMN cookies I've ever had! 
Everyone that tried them loved them.

My mother-in-law said this was one of the best cookies she had ever had.  The 375F was the best cooking temp. Tried 350F but it wasn't high enough.

I made these cookies today, and it only took a short time, and my cookies turned out perfect. Delicious. I rarely cook/bake but these were super easy to make. I did reduce the number of nuts, but that's the only change I made.

very tasty! i love the3 subway cookies and was hoping to try to duplicate for christmas (with red and green sugar sprinkle before baking) this recipe is great but i didn't read your reviews until i was baking. double the recipe except for the choc/nuts. if not you will have over stuffed cookies that have a hard time staying together.  i made mine bigger and they seemed to also need to cook a it longer than suggested maybe 1-2 minutes.

Really good...and easy too. I used white chocolate chips (1 cup) instead of chopping my own. Chopped my own macadamia nuts too and then saw them at Walmart already chopped up! I don't really like white chocolate and even I ate several.

i thought that these cookies, were just okay. My husband loved them, but i thought they a bit cakey...my idea of a chip and nut cookie should be more dense, and more chewy.

I used 1/2c of white chocolate chips and 1/2c of chopped macadamias, which was the perfect portions for me.  This is a naturally rich and creamy cookie with the white chocolate and all, but I wouldn't try to change it.

This recipe does live up to its hype.  I was impressed with how accurate this recipe was even after experimenting with the recipe a bit.  Like others say I think using a little over half the nuts that the recipe calls for is perfect but other than that I didn't change a thing.  A teaspoon was a little too small for the size of cookies I wanted so I used a tablespoon. Also, refrigerating the batter for a few minutes before popping them in the oven prevented them from running.  Very good cookies.  I can't wait to hear what my guests will think of them too!

Perfect.... boyfriend says this is the best recipe for white chocolate macadamia nut cookies I have found thus far!  I used a little extra white chocolate (I just used Tollhouse chips rather than chopped).  The most important thing is not to over-bake these.  Makes all the difference in the world.

I made this recipe the other day and they were wonderful.  My kids rated them a 9 and 9.5.  My husband loved them as well.    I did follow other reviewers' suggestions of doubling the batter portion while keeping the amount of nuts and chips the same.  I felt this change was perfect.  Had the batter not been doubled I think the amount of chips and nuts is waaayyy too much.  So that's why 4 out of 5 stars.    This recipe is a definite keeper for my family.  Easy and delicious!!!

Have you ever eaten something so incredibly good that it almost makes you cry?  OMG...  absolutely to die for.   One batch I made I added 1/2 cup Craisins. One recommendation:  Divide the dough in batches and roll into logs.  Bake them as you need them...  Otherwise you might be tempted to eat a huge pile for supper.   Baaad idea!  Also when you bake them cold they don't spread as much and are nice and chewy.  I baked at 350 for 8 minutes, rotated the pan and baked 2 more minutes.

These turned out great.  I made as directed, using chopped Nestle white chocolate bars.  I made 18 larger cookies, and they were perfect after baking 10 minutes.  Cooled them for about 2 minutes on the cookie sheet before transferring them to a rack.  They did turn out exactly like "subway" cookies!

Doubled the dough, but not the chips and nuts like other raters suggested. Light, delicate, perfectly flavor-balanced, almost shortbread-like sugar cookie. The best. Would highly recommend.

Excellent cookie! I changed the receipe up a little. I didn't want my cookies so chunky...so I made a double batch with just one 12oz bag of vanilla chips and 8oz of macadamia nuts, chopped. I turned the oven down a little because the edges were browning and left them in approx. 11 minutes. Would definately make them again, my hubby loves them. Her favorite is a white macadamia cookie and this is the best ever made.

The is a wonderful recipe, but I, like others, did make some changes.  I doubled the recipe, except the nuts and white chocolate. Instead of 1 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup Crisco.  If too salty for you, either use unsalted nuts or use salted nuts and do not add any salt. I did not chop the chocolate and roughly chopped the nuts (almost like cutting the nuts in 1/4s).  I baked 1 heaping tablespoon that I rolled in a ball on parchment paper for approx 8 min.  until lightly browned.  Let cool on pan 2-3 min., then move to a cooling rack.  Perfect! By putting in to a ball, it doesn't run at all.  Hint:  when making that ball, keep the nuts inside the dough so that the nuts don't get too dark on the bottom.

These are so tasty!  I live overseas where it's impossible to find macadamia nuts, so I used chopped Brazil nuts instead.  Even at high altitude with no adjustments, they were delicious!

Great match to Subway or Tim Horton's white chocolate macadamia cookies only fresher! You probably could get away with just 4oz of nuts though. Thanks Maureen!

In a word? Yum-o!!! These cookies were extremely awesome! The only change that I made is that I doubled the recipe but kept the white chocolate and macadamia amount the same, didn't want to overwhelm my guests with too much chocolate and way too many nuts. Overall, a way delicious cookie. This one's a keeper!!!

These were so good!  I was looking for a White Chocolate Macadamia recipie and it seemed like almost all of them had brown sugar in them- which I really don't think goes with this kind of cookie!  This is exactly what I was looking for and they turned out great!

This recipe made excellent cookies. Exactly what I wanted. I doubled everything and used a 12 oz bag white chocolate chips and a 6 oz bag macadamia nut pieces. I chilled the dough slightly before forming small balls to make cookies.

A great recipe with minor alterations. I did double the recipe, and used 12 oz. of white chocolate chips and 5 oz. of sliced almonds, as I didn't have macadamia nuts on hand. I got about 40 cookies out of the doubled recipe. I love the light color of these, and they are perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside. Will make again!

These are awesome!  I followed the directions except I used 2 cups white chocolate chips in place of the chopped white chocolate.  This is the first homemade white chocolate macadamia nut cookie that I have tried and actually thought it a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I doubled the batch. I used one bag of white chocolate chips (12 oz.) and 1 bag (6 oz.) of macadamia nuts. Baked for about 10 minutes until lightly golden all over and they were great. I like mine a little doughey and they were!

A good recipe to start with but way too many macadamia nuts. I like Macadamia nuts but they took over the cookies. These were leftover on my Christmas cookie trays after all the other cookies were gone. With fewer nuts this would be a 5 star recipe.

These cookies are surprisingly *delicious*!!  They are kind of cake-like, but my family loved them anyways.  The only thing I did differently was to use pecans instead of macadamias (that was all I had) and put the cookie sheets in the fridge for 1 hour before putting them in the oven for 12 minutes at 350 degree F.

These tasted good but were on the cakey side. My dough came out like cake batter, so I added extra flour till it seemed more like cookie dough. Maybe this was because I melted the butter? Anyway I chilled the dough first, then baked as directed. Like I said, they tasted good, but were cakey and soft. I prefer this type of cookie crisp around the edges and dense and chewy in the center. I will keep looking. I do however, like the absence of brown sugar in this recipe. I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who said that brown sugar tends to overpower the delicate flavor of the white chocolate. Thanks anyway.

This is such a simple recipe for a very good cookie.  My husband HATES it when I make these because he can't keep his hand out of the cookie jar.  I only gave it 4 stars because I can never get it to yield 4 dozen.  When I make a variety of cookies, these are always the first to go.

This recipe is not as good as a recipe that uses brown sugar in addition to the white.  The cookies were not as dense as I would have liked.  My boyfriend is not picky when it comes to sweets and he even made a comment about how they were  not as good as my last batch.  I do not recommend this recipe.

These are amazing!!  So simple, yet so much taste.  I used 8 oz. white chocolate chips, 2.5 oz. macadamia nuts (accidentally left out the other package) and "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter."  One batch I baked on a regular cookie sheet (10 min.) and the other on stoneware (13-14 min.).  I smoothed the dough balls with water on the tips of my fingers in order to get a rounded cookie.

Good cookie.  I also put 1/2 the amount of chips/nuts.  I loved them, but my boyfriend who loves these kind of cookies, said "something was missing" and that they were bland.

If there was a way to give this six stars, I would!  The lack of brown sugar in this recipe makes it lighter and much brighter in flavor.  I've made it with chopped macadamias and whole macadamias.  Both are just great!  Follow the recipe exactly, unless you want to up the white chocolate some. haha!  Yum!

Delicious and so quick and easy. I used white chocolate chips and increased the vanilla to 2 tsp. My macadamia nuts were salted, so I omitted the additional salt. After scooping and forming the dough on the trays, I chilled the whole tray in the refrigerator. We ate a bunch of the dough (it was supurb), so ended up with 2 1/2 dozen cookies. Thanks for the recipe, Maureen!

This is a definite crowd pleaser and easy to make. With as many macadamia lovers there were chowing down on these scrumptious eats, I didn't expect to hear any complaints.

The only surprise was guest feedback stating that the amount of macadamia used could have been lessend and still not take away from the sweet experience.

When making this, you might want to save a little money and cut back on the macadamia by a smidgen or so.

I dont know what I did wrong, but my cookies came out hard and with little to no flavor. 
I followed the recipe correctly. Will do over until I get it right.

Wonderful recipe.  I substituted 1/2 of white sugar with brown sugar.  Very, very good.

These are good but don't knock your socks off.  I found that it called for too much white chocolate and nuts and ended up using about 1/2.

This recipe was awesome...although I did make some changes: I doubled all the ingredients, minus the nuts and chocolate.  I used half white and half brown sugar.  I baked each batch for 14 minutes.  They turned out soooo good.  They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  One thing I did learn is (and this is probably because I am a novice cookie baker) is that you have to let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet before you transfer them to the wire racks.  I mangled a couple because I wasn't aware of that....other than that, I will definately be making these again!!!

These cookies were perfect.  You need do nothing more than follow the directions, and make sure you do not over cook them. I read some of the reviews that said they were cakey or flat.  I found neither to be true.

These did not turn out very good for me. They were very "fluffy" and cake-like. Pretty dry too. Not at all like the Subway cookies that I was hoping for! The only reason I give them 3 stars is because the flavor is good, otherwise they would get 1 or 2 stars. Sorry.

Theses cookies are delicious.  I will be making them again.  They are similar to the ones found at Subway.  I did not find that they were puffy at all.  They also do taste the best on the second day.

I loved making these cookies..not only were they easy to make but everyone in my family loved them. I didn't have any macademia nuts so instead I used salted mixed nuts(walnut,pecan,brazalian nut, hazel nut) and only half the amount of white chocolate. since there were plenty of salt from the nuts I didn't add any salt to my recipe. i baked them on middle rack of the oven for 9 min. when you cream the butter make sure it's not melted...room temp. is just fine. thanks so much for this recipe. what a great recipe.!!!!

Very tasty cookie!  I used King Arthur organic whole wheat white flour, which worked quite nicely.  We thought that the cookies tasted much better after sitting overnight.  The white chocolate got very dark on the cookie bottoms of the first batch I made, so I reduced the oven temp to 350 degrees and nested one cookie sheet on top of another.  The remainder came out great!

I lost my favorite macadamia nut cookie recipe and found this one!! I did change a few things. I used unsalted butter, omitted the salt and baked them at 325 degrees. I also double the recipe and used 3 eggs. Awesome cookies!! Just like the ones from the recipe that I lost.  :^)

If you are looking to impress, this is NOT the recipe. This recipe contains expensive ingredients to have them turn out looking so awful. They run all over, are flat and I threw them away. You guaranteed I'd love them Maureen; I guarantee YOU that I did NOT.

The flavor here was good, but they looked NOTHING liket the photo. Mine spread out a lot and got very thin.  I tried refrigerating the dough and that helped but I think that next time I will sub shortening for 1/2 the butter.

**Edit** I went back and checked my ingredients and I had doubled the butter.  I tried again and they turned out great.  My bad.  Sorry for the confusion

These cookies had an amazing taste, but I found that they needed a little more cookie for the amount of nuts & white chocolate.  These are my fiance's favorite kind of cookie and he couldn't keep his hands off of this batch.  I even used light butter and 2 parts Splenda to 1 part sugar.  Would definitely make again but would increase the batter.

Absolutely delicious--tastes just like the Mrs. Fields cookie! I only used 1 cup of macadamia nuts because 6.5 oz seemed like quite a bit. To be honest, the cookies don't look that pretty (a little problem with the nuts over-browning and general lumpiness), but they are soooo scrumptious!

These are the best white choc/macadamia cookies I have ever had!  I did cut down on the nuts and white chips, as it seems that amounts in the recipe are for a double batch.  GREAT cookie!

These turned out great.   I used a mixed bag of macademia nuts and white chocolate chips in the recipe which turned out great.  Half of the dough I left exactly has the recipe stated.  The other half I add 1/3 cup of cocoa.  The cocoa was an excellent addition for all those chocolate lovers out there!

These were great!  Beat out a lot of other macadamia recipes from over the years.  Don't add in extra chocolate; they're plenty sweet with what's in them as is.  I do like mine a little flatter, so I put in a tablesoon of water.  Also, if you don't have macadamia nuts, subbing 1 c. craisins is fantastic.  Great recipe!

These cookies did not turn out well for me at all. I even added only 3/4 of the called for chips and 1/2 the nuts and it still did not have enough dough to hold them!

Terrific!  Made just as described in the recipe, and they tasted wonderful - so good that I made them for church choir.  They were a hit! :)  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Finally the perfect macadamia white choc. cookie. I wanted to make it exactly as stated but turns out I only had 3 ounces white chocolate and 2.5 ounces of macadamia nuts. So I searched for something to add  for the texture and flavor. I found a bag of brown sugar/maple instant oatmeal and had about 1/4 cup regular oats. I knew when I tasted the dough that it was a winner. I really loved the oats in it and  really it was so good made like this. I'll bet it  is excellent as submitted also. Thank you for this recipe .

This was my first crack at making macadamia nut cookies and they came out great.  My first batch came out on the thick side. I flattened out my second batch and they melted beautifully. I also used Hershey's white chocolate bar with almonds which is far superior to any white chocolate chip I've ever tasted. I mixed some of the macadamia nuts & chocolate in with the dough. I saved chunks of each for topping each cookie while on the cookie sheet. Expensive but yummy.

This is the BEST cookie recipe I've found for a textured cookie with nuts and chocolate. I used walnuts and pecans in it along with chipped white chocolate. I only had a 6-ounce bar but that was plenty for these cookies. My husband told me not to lose this recipe! I highly recommend it.

I noticed they were runny when putting them on the pan. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out of the oven looking like a cookie sheet. Won’t use this recipe again. Maybe it’s an altitude thing? We are in the mountains.

I made this recipe exactly boy the directions.  They were way too crisp and crunchy.  My I baked them 15 minutes, edges were beginning to brown lightly.   I used Macadamia nuts that were lightly salted.  I wondered if that caused my problem.  I am thinking about using a base that has worked well for me prior and adding the nuts and white chocolate chips.

These are great cookies. The only change I made is to only use about 2-3 oz of nuts; 6 oz is a lot. And in my oven, they only need to cook for 7-8 minutes. They come out soft in the middle and a little crunchy on the outside. And I get about 20 cookies, not 24. 

And useful hint, I put them in the fridge for a few minutes after scooping them onto the baking tray. This keeps them from spreading when they cook. Also, I use an ice cream scooper for more uniform-sized cookies.

I accidentally added 1 tbsp of vanilla extract instead of the 1 tsp and I didn't have any nuts so I added 1/4 cup of coconut flakes and I knew they weren't going to turn out right so I put them in a muffin pan instead and oh my gosh they were amazing white chocolate, coconut muffins! My family loved them. I always have a hard time making cookies lol. Next time I'll pay more attention to the tsp vs the tbsp.

I followed recommendation and double recipe but used about 9 0z nuts and one bag white chocolate chips. Also, each batch I tried different timing- definitely that soft chewy cookie if you only bake for 9 minute let rest in tray briefly and then to cooking rack. Even when cooked just over 10 minutes they are still very soft and delicious!

These cookies are amazing!!! I make white chocolate macadamia nut cookies every year to include in my Christmas Goody Tins, but my old recipe always came out just a little under my standards. I took a chance on this recipe and it’s a keeper!! I made one change- I used almond extract instead of vanilla and they were delicious! This recipe will remain in rotation in my kitchen!!!

I’ve made these many times. I always use a small cookie scooper to make them mini cookies. Make sure to use fresh baking soda, though, or else they’ll just flatten out into pancakes.

These taste amazing but I think I must have added a bit too much salt. Also, I did end up over-baking them so they were a lot crunchier than I expected. Otherwise a fairly simple, straightforward recipe! I would make these again with some adjustments.

I used  white chocolate chips, but only had about 6 oz; I had about 8 oz of Macadamia nuts, so used them all.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I did not chill before baking or add any extra flour.  I used a cookie scoop rather than a spoon, and did not have a problem with them spreading too much. 8 minutes @ 375 in my RV convection oven gave me 45 beautiful, yummy cookies.

They  turned out great!  I doubled the recipe and used a 12oz bag of Nestle'swhite chocolate morsels.  Plenty of white chocolate.  I used a small 1 inch scoop and it made 99 cookies instead of 48.

I'm an American living in NZ .  I've used this recipe and another for WC Mac nut cookies and both came out cakey.  I followed this recipe to the T but it wasn't as great as others review.  I was quite disappointed because I was hoping this recipe would be the winner.  The only thing I can think of is the flour maybe the cause.

update October 10, 2016:  I used cut down on the flour.  I used 1 and 1/8 cup of flour and it turned out perfectly delicious!

I added 1 cup of coconut as well as doubling the basic cookie recipe, but keeping the nuts & chips amount as listed here.  I made extra-large cookies using a 1/4 cup scoop, baking them at 350 degrees for 12 - 13 minutes.  I also found that rolling the dough balls in sugar and refrigerating them for at least 30 minutes before baking made slightly-crisp cookies on the outside, and soft, chewy cookies on the inside.  In a taste test of two, we both greatly preferred those cookies rolled in sugar and refrigerated to the standard preparation.

These cookies were fantastic.  I actually turned them into ice cream sandwiches, which were a HUGE hit.   I already have several requests to make more.  1st time venturing into this realm.  Definite success.

Made the recipe exactly as follows.  Definite keys to success:
- butter must be ever so slightly softened, does not need to be left out overnight for example
- chopping the macadamia nuts and white chocolate into small pieces is key because the amount of nuts and chocolate to batter is overwhelming - the smaller the nuts and chocolate are, the easier it is to incorporate into the small amount of batter
- oven temperature must be 375 - so use your oven thermometer if needed (my oven runs 25 degrees on the hot side!)
- if your kitchen feels too warm, refrigerate the dough

I used white chocolate chips - that yes, I chopped up.  Again, glad I did because it makes sure that every bite of your cookie has chocolate and nuts.  As everything is small, you don't get gaping holes in the cookies, or uneven baking.

Delicious,  moist and slightly crispy on the outside.  I cooked them for 12 minutes using a stone cooking sheet. I used dry roasted macadamia nuts, which added enough salt to make the white chocolate less potent. My new favorite cookie! Thank you for the easy and yummy recipe!

These were amazing. I used chopped up almond bark, which melted into the cookies and chilled them before baking. My husband, who is not partial to sweets, forbid me to bring them in to work!

These get a 5 for taste but a lower score overall because of the directions.  The recipe says yield is 5 dozen but I got half that.  My cookies were a normal size, not jumbo.  I also cut the nuts and white chocolate in half and that was plenty.  Will definitely make again, though, they are delicious!!!

Made these for my husband. He was flabbergasted that this cookie was so yummy. Chewy on the inside and nice crisp edge. Only thing I did was add a splash of almond extract which brings out the macadamia nut flavor a little bit more. Its a keeper, getting ready to make them again as soon as my butter is to room temp!

This is a great recipe.  The cookie came out nice and chewy, not crunchy.  I cut the amount of chocolate chips and Nuts in half because it seemed like too much. Please note, this recipe only makes about two dozen cookies not four dozen.

Very good recipe, will definitely make these again. I put my dough in the fridge for 15 minutes before putting the balls on the baking sheet, and then baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.

Easy to make and I doubled. Amazing it's the same recipe used for basic chocolate chip cookies when doubles and the brown sugar is missing, however the white sugar makes up for the brown. It's the vanilla that makes the cookie. Place dough in bowl, covered with plastic wrap in fridge (hour) and then use wax paper (parchment) and formed a roll. then refrigerate an hour, cut roll in half and put one half in freezer in zip lock and sliced cookie size wanted from other half and baked. With summer coming up, would rather the toaster over used for 4 cookies then the stove (no A/C here).

A very sweet cookie.  I also doubled the recipe, used a bag of white chocolate chips, and 6 oz macadamia nuts.  My double batch made 4 dozen "medium" OXO cookie scoop size, which is 2 TBLS I believe, cooked for about 10 minutes.

These cookies are scrumptious!  I followed the recipe but refrigerated the dough overnight and baked the next morning.  The cookies were too fat so I turned the oven higher and then they were just right!

These are quite good. I made them for a Christmas cookie contest- so if I win I will update to 5 stars :-)
UPDATE: these won second place, but more importantly, I like them more and more each time I eat one. I am adding these to the regular rotation- I love them!

I loved it.  I only put half the nuts and chocolate. Baked them at 350 for 12-13 minutes. They did not come out cakey or mushy. They came out with a pretty color top and bottom.

I also doubled the ingredients except for the nuts and chocolate.  Chewy and delicious, but greasy.  Just like the Subway version.

I have to admit, I started out not liking this cookie before it was baked. I truly don't understand how anyone can get 4 dozen from this recipe.  I think the cookies are dry, but the flavor was good. I will look for another recipe for now.

YUM! These cookies turned out awesome! I ended up getting both the macadamia nuts and white chocolate in bulk and the recipe called for almost half a pound of nuts and a little over half of white chocolate. It was the perfect ratio!!! I baked the cookies for 9 minutes, which was perfect!

this was the tastiest thing I've ever made.  White choc/ macadamian nut cookies have always been my favorite but I'm not into macadamian nuts so I took them out and these cookies were even more "awesomER"! The 2nd time I made them they tasted like sugar cookies though and I can't figure out what I did that second time to change the flavor.  The next times they were great again so, whatever.  Overall, best things ever!

These were very good - but mine puffed up a bit more than I liked.  Next time I will refrig. the dough and flatten with a spoon before baking.

I made these and the first batch spread out really thin and sort of melted all over the parchment paper.  Because of this, they burned of course, and mostly had to be thrown away.  On subsequent batches I was careful to press the dough very firmly into a ball shape, and that seemed to help although they still cooked pretty irregularly which surprised me because I don't usually have that problem.  I think refrigerating the dough before cooking would have helped but I didn't have time for that this afternoon.  I got several that came out perfectly, but many of them didn't.  I probably wouldn't make these again.  For the expense of the ingredients, I don't really feel that they were worth the result.

Sadly, I couldn't find macadamia nuts at my grocery store.  So, I used pecans.  Like other reviews suggested, I doubled the ingredients, but kept the chocolate and nuts the same.  Perfect!  I put my dough in the fridge for a while and baked mine at 375 degrees for 8 minutes.  I let them cool on the baking sheet.  Again, perfect!

This recipe was absolutely fantastic! My family doesn't like their baked goods too sweet, so the only change I made was to drop the sugar down to slightly more than 1/3 cup - the white chocolate was quite sweet enough to keep this a very tasty cookie.

I added 1/3 cup of brown sugar, an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and instead of using butter I used Crisco butter flavored oil. Now I cannot stop baking these cookies :) Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and they taste great. My only problem was with the timing, I left them in too long so they came out a bit hard. I took the second batch out sooner and let them harden on the cooling rack...much better!

Awesome. Soft and chewy. I put 1 oz less chocolate chips and only 1/2 oz less of the nuts and I thought they turned out great!

I won a bakeoff with this recipe!  Everyone loved these cookies.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the recipe except for the nuts and white chocolate.  Also, make sure to watch these cookies closely when they are baking to prevent them from getting too brown/crispy.

They have great flavor, but they dont really get much color when baking and they turn out kind of cakey. I will be making them again for sure! I doubled the recipe but left the chocolate and nuts the same and this time I am going decrease the flour by 1/4 cup again this is for the double batch that everyone says to do!

My fiance absolutely LOVED these cookies.  I did make a few alterations though...  I decreased the amount of nuts/white chocolate and increased the vanilla and extended the cooking time to get them to a perfect golden brown.  I will definitely make these again!

When my 16 year-old daughter came downstairs today and saw the bag of macadamia nuts on the counter, she said this was one of her favorite days.  These are her favorite kind of cookies, but I have never made them before because of the expense of the nuts.  I found some on sale, so she finally got her cookies.  Personally, I think that they spread a little too much and turned out kind of thin.  Next time, I will probably chill the dough a little before baking.  But, the fact that my daughter loved them so much and the only reason that she didn't eat them all was because I took them away, is enough for me to give them a 5 star rating.

I was tempted to change a couple things (it sounded like to much white chocolate for my taste) but I'm glad I didn't. They turned out perfect!

Excellent recipe, and a forgiving recipe too. I only had a 3.5 oz. bag of macadamia nuts, and I didn't measure out the chocolate very carefully, but the cookies were awesome anyway. Very rich and nutty. Considering how good they were and how pricey macadamia nuts are, next time I will use the smaller bag again.

these were great!  I had no macadamias so I added dried cherries and walnuts.  Walnuts were a bit too bitter but cherries were fantastic.  I will use this recipe as a base for many a goodie!

This is the best cookie I have tasted in a very long time! I followed the other advice to double the dough but not the chocolate or nuts. I used 12oz white chocolate chips instead of chunked white chocolate. My husband picked up the macadamia nuts for me on his way home from work, and accidentally picked up dry roasted nuts. I didn't notice it either (mainly bc I have never seen dry roasted macadamia nuts before) until I had added them to the mix and sampled one. ;0) I was very nervous as to how they would turn out with all the added salt of being dry roasted...but it wasn't bad! If they were so good with being a little salty due to the nuts, I am sure they are amazing with regular macadamia nuts as well! I am going to the store to buy some plain ones today to make another batch. :0)

This recipe is good with a few changes. 3/4 cup of sugar is WAY too much.  I only used 1/2 cup and found this cookie to be very sweet because of the white chips. I also used 100% whole wheat flour and had great results. The amount of nuts could also be cut back to half the amount if you don't want to spend that much money on making cookies.  Peanuts would also work as well.

DELICIOUS.  I am in the process of baking these for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, and have just sampled one of the first out of the oven. I'm in heaven.  I didn't alter the recipe at all. I thought about cutting back on the nuts and chips, but now I'm glad I didn't! I love that the dough looks to be almost more nuts and chips than actual dough, but they still hold together amazingly well. They're light, sweet, nutty...in a word, perfect.  They'll be a hit tomorrow afternoon, I'm sure.  I'll definitely be baking these again. :-)

I made these for my husband since his store brand version was discontinued. Really easy to make,we ate them warm out of the oven and thought they were good. I only put a little salt since the nuts were salted. Put them away in a tupperware bowl and called it a night. We ate them the next day. WOW they were awesome the next day! Much better than warm and fresh from the oven. Amazing recipe a keeper!

These taste just a great as the ones at Subway! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white and baked at 350 for 12 min and they always turn out perfect! A little crispy on the edges with a nice chewy center, you can't go wrong with that!

Very delicious! i didn't change a thing, except for the oven temp. i wanted the chocolate to be extra melty and the nuts to soften so i put it on 325. They were excellent! Favorite cookie ever!

YUM! Made them exactly as directed minus salt due to slightly salted macadamias. Everyone loved them, don't overbake! Delicious warm!

YUMMY! They did spread out more than I had anticipated, so I ended up with a sheet cookie. But very tasty.

These are great cookies; soft, chewy, and sweet. I upped the serving number to 36 to accommodate the 12oz bag of white chocolate chips I had and adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly. That made me about 45 medium-sized cookies-not too big, not too small. I'm giving these 5 stars because they were easy to make, quick baking time, and the texture, taste and appearance were just right.

I made these for a christmas party and was suprised about how delicious they were. I got quite a few comments on how good they were and they were really easy to make, only a few ingredients needed. I felt like the cooking time was accurate, but the cookies were a little crunchier than I would like. Next time I may try adding a package of vanilla instant pudding to keep them soft. Definitely a keeper!

Perfect cookie.  Followed directions exactly.  My boyfriend who thought he didn't like these ate about 10 already. The combination of chewy and crunchy is exactly how it should be.  Will be adding these to my Xmas cookie baking list. I baked them for 10 minutes.

Excellent cookies! My boyfriend's favorite cookie.  I agree with another poster that using only whilte sugar is perfect for the white chocolate to really shine. I eyed the amount of chocolate and nuts but that is only to my taste cause I like more cookie.

I read on here that someone had a runny dough? I don't know how this is possible because this dough was just perfect to work with for me. The cookies turned out amazing and I didn't change a thing! There were a lot of nuts and chocolate, but my boyfriend likes them this way anyways! Thanks for a great recipe!

DELICIOUS! I doubled the recipe and used a whole bag of white choc chips, and one 5 oz. jar of mac. nuts (those nuts are expensive! so I only bought one jar, and I chopped them in my chopper so there were plenty of nuts pieces in the cookies). I'm not a cookie dough eater, but I tasted it and had a hard time stopping :)

Great flavor!  I added 1/4 cup more flour b/c  my cookies were flat when they came out of the oven and cooled.  I believe I didn't put the correct amount of flour in to begin with.  This is a very good recipe, you should try it.

I've never really been a fan of the whole white chocolate and macadamia nut thing.  These cookies have converted me.  I doubled the recipe, but kept the chocolate/nuts the same.  I used a 12 oz bag of white chocolate chips.  I also only added 1/2 tsp of salt because the nuts were salted.  I had to cook them for 12-14 minutes at 375.  But they were soooooo worth it.  I could sell these if I wanted to.

These tasted delicious! I regrettably only used half the nuts and I missed them when all was said and done, so will be using the full amount next time.. I also only used half the white chocolate, but I think that worked just fine - So next time will use all the nuts, half the chocolate :) I guess it all depends on your tastes :)

I always bring cookies in to the office and this batch got rave reviews from everyone.  I bring different kids all the time and this by far has been the favourite! I followed the others recommendations and added cinnamon, more vanilla and doubled the batch leaving the normal white choc and nut amount.  All day long my co-workers told me how good they were!

I used a 12oz. bags of white choc. chips and it seemed like I had way too much chocolate and nuts for the little amount of batter.. so I ended up doubling the recipe for the batter and they turned out great! SO delicious!

These looked and tasted like I'd bought them from a bakery. White chocolate and macadamia nuts one of my favorite combinations, and I'm glad I finally found a recipe that showcases both of them so well.

GREAT cookie.  I did use white chocolate chips........I followed the advice of another review and used 12 oz chips & 10 oz of the macadamia nuts...I do think it was too much.  For me it wasn't enough dough and the cookie didn't stick together so next time I will probably follow the recipe amounts still using White Chocolate chips.  Flavor was delicious.

I'm actually making these right now. First of all I can't stop eating the dough and now the first cooked batch is almost gone. My boyfriend says these are his favorite cookies ever. I also doubled the dough and put 6 oz of nuts and 12 oz of white choc chips.

This is my mom and brothers favourite cookie so I decided to give it a try, and the turned out fabulously! I ground the nuts because neither my dad or myself like nuts in our cookies but it produced the same taste. I also added about a tablespoon of milk because I felt that the batter was too dry. Other than that they turned out perfectly, two thumbs up from the cookie lovers in the house!

For me there was a little too much salt. Next time we're going to double the recipe but do a 1/4 tsp less salt. This was a great find. It's my hubby's favorite cookie.

These were really good cookies. Not too sweet,and easy to make. I couldn't find macadamia nuts that wern't salted, so I bought the salted ones and rinsed off the salt. It worked fine, but I would cut the salt back in the recpie though, maybe to a 1/4 tsp. Also, I doubled the recpie but didn't even use a full bag of white chips because that would have been too many (although I never use the full amount of chips in any recpie because I don't like a lot)

These are great! I followed the recipe exactly.  I left the cookies on the cookie sheet to cool so they were nice and cruchy around the edges, but chewey in the cetner.  Perfect!

White chocolate macadamia nut cookies are my favourite, and this cookie was pretty close to perfection. I made them slightly larger, and served fresh from the oven with a round scoop of ice cream, caramel sauce drizzled on top, and grated chocolate curls sprinkled on top. It made for a beautiful dessert that got lots of compliments from our company! Be sure not to bake the cookies until they're very golden so they'll be more chewy than crunchy. You also might want to half the macadamia nuts so they're not too large.

This is my husband's favorite cookie. So when I made a deal to make him 1 batch a cookies for 6 months in order to get a Kitchenaid mixer, I had to make this first. He said these are the best cookies he has ever had. Thanks!

This recipe is great. The 'white sugar only' batter really made the cookies perfect. However, I will need to scale it up in the future.

Very good recipe.  Easy to make and was a hit with my friends.  My personal preference was to add just a bit more of the Macadamia nut and vanilla extract, and it came out perfectly.

These cookies are so good!!! I doubled this recipe but kept the chocolate and nuts the same and they turned out great. I baked mine for 11 minutes and they spread out nicely. They were chewy on the inside with a nice crunch on the outside. I will defiantly make these again.

Delicious!  The only thing I changed was I added about 1/8 t of almond extract to the recipe and a little more macadamia nut chunks.  The macadamia nuts I used happened to be honey roasted, and it added a little zip to the cookies!

These cookies were good, but not exactly what i was looking for. I doubled the ingredients, but kept the amount of white chocolate and nuts the same. They turned out more cakey than I would have liked, but otherwise they were delicious.

Yummy!  These were very good.  I followed another reviewer's advice by doubling the recipe, but keeping the nut/chocolate amounts the same. The cookies didn't spread well, and weren't quite the consistency we normally like, so next time I will add more butter and lower the temp to 350.

These were awesome! I made them and brought half to my boyfriend's apartment where all of his room mates devoured them agreeing they were "the best while chocolate macadamia nut cookies they'd ever had". The only change I made was to double the ingredients except for the chocolate and nuts- they were perfect!

These are some of the best cookies EVER!  I took them to a cookie exchange at our church and was told by 3 different people that mine were "the best".  I actually used butter flavored Crisco for half of the butter called for to keep them softer, and I used white baking chips instead of chopped white chocolate and they turned out fabulous!  Thanks Maureen for posting this recipe, I will be using it again and again!

These were very easy to make. I gave it 4 stars because they were a little crispier than I would have liked. I made two batches, and in modifying the cooking time, they were either crunchy or raw in the middle. Having said that, everyone who I gave them to as Christmas presents asked for the recipe! My husband absolutely loved them as well, and has requested that I do as another member, and keep some frozen for a cookie or 2 at a whack in the toaster oven. :D
Thank you so much for the recipe! It is now a part of my Christmas cookie collection.

After a few changes these were pretty good. I doubled all the ingredients except for the white chocolate and nuts. I used 1 package white chocolate chips (about 1 1/2 cups) and 1 1/2 cups chopped macadamia nuts. I baked them at 350 degrees for about 12 min.

A little too salty for my taste.  A little less salt and I think it would have the perfect balance of sweet and salty.

These were very tasty. I doubled the recipe but not the chocolate or nuts as suggested. I think that next time I will toast the nuts, as I think that this would help to bring out their buttery flavor and compliment the cookie better.

I made this recipe for the first time today. I bought macadamia  nuts that did not say "salted". However, it turned out they were slightly salted. I corrected the recipe by not adding the 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and by adding 1/4 cup of brown sugar flavored corn syrup (I had to add this at the end, because it was still a little too salty). 

The addition of the corn syrup made the cookies a little crispier on the edges, and very gooey in the middle.

I cooked them for 8 minutes each. 

Over all the recipe is decent, but I wouldn't call it 5 stars.

Definitely one of my holiday favorites, these are one of ones people demand I include in my holiday cookie trays, lol. I've tried several macadamia recipes and this is my favorite.

I'm not a good baker, but these turned out fantastic and it's a very easy recipe! I did chill my dough on the cookie sheet while the oven was heating up and I think this kept them from flattening out too much. Great recipe...thanks

What a great recipe!!!  Had to make a few batches for a party and saw the reviews of this recipe.  And I'm a very beginning baker.

The only thing I changed was the amount of flour.  I took out 1/2 cup.  I also added more white chocolate chips, for my taste.  Every cookie must have mounds of chips.

I thought I'd be cookie'd out, but we're still loving these a couple of days later.  A definite keeper.  Thank you so much.

I made a batch of these for work yesterday. Everyone raved about them and wanted the recipe. This is the closest you will Ever get for a Subway cookie. Very very good! I used my Air Bake cookie sheet and they baked wonderfully.
I suggest you watch the baking time carefully. When the timer on my oven alarmed for 8 mins, I peeked at them and they needed a little more baking time. I took them out at 8 min's and 45 seconds. 
Very slighty brown, and I do mean slighty. Easy, fast recipe. This one is a KEEPER! :)

Eh.  Made these and they turned out pretty flat and a bit too crunchy/crumbly- might be due to the fact that i softened the butter a bit too much, but still.  Good flavour though.

I was really let down. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a handful of dried cranberries for festive color. The cookies look perfect and they were very easy to make but, they are just bland. They aren't the worst but, seem to be less sweet than they should e. I'm melting white chocolate to drizzle over them to "save" the cookie. I really don't think the handful of cranberries could have altered the flavor that much, not the subway cookie I was hoping for but, pretty and easy.

I am sorry but it took 2 batches to get them right. 375 was just too hot and I even have a temp gauge in my oven to test the temp. They were burnt on the bottoms after 6 min. I turned down the heat to 350 so the second batch was better although the flavor was nothing spectacular. I will keep searching. The only reason these were pretty good is because they were loaded with choc. chips. I can buy a candy bar and get that sensation with alot less trouble. Sorry.

They are really good cookies.  I thought I messed them up because the dough is very crumbly.  They turned out good.  I also will use less nuts and chocolate next time.  Thank you!

Great recipe! Good choice to go with all white sugar - these aren't Toll House cookies with white for dark chocolate and macadamia nuts for walnuts. They're a jumble cookie.

I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great. Might be a little salty for some, but I love them that way.

My husband asked me to make White Choc Macadamia Nut Cookies one night, something I haven't tried before. I chose this recipe and it was fantastic!  I've made them twice in the last month and they got rave reveiws and disappeared quickly both times. Very simple to make and I didn't change a single thing to the original recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic. My new favorite cookie.  I did double the recipe.  I didn't double the nuts due to the cost, but cut them in 1/2 to 1/4 depending on the size - it still gives you the great macadamia flavor in every bite. I also used white chocolate chips intead of chunks.

I did add a couple extras: a little bit of strawberry preserves and some coconut. Sooooooo good.

Very good, almost addicting cookie. Not too sweet at all. For those who do not like nuts, I have made this recipe before without them and it still tastes great. I did not modify the recipe at all...I made a little bit larger of a cookie and cooked them for 10 minutes and they came out wonderful.

I used white chocolate chips instead of chopped white chocolate, and I increased the baking time by 4 minutes because I made 12 large cookies.  They were delicious with crisp edges and chewy centers.  The cookies may look under-cooked at first, but after cooling, they have the perfect texture.  This recipe is a keeper!

Cookies were perfect!  Crispy outside, soft and chewy inside.  Although, first tray had burnt bottoms but fixed that by placing the same size pan (double-panning) underneath to create an air pocket.  Delicious!

These were better than I expected! I followed other reviewers advice and used one (overflowing!) cup of white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of chopped macadamia nuts. Also added a handful of shredded coconut. I chilled the dough for a few hours and scooped and baked. This kept them from spreading and they came out beautifully!

Love, love, LOVE this recipe!  Like others I used 1/2 c chopped macadamia nuts and about 1 c of chocolate chips.  Bake them until just lightly browned around the edges, remove from oven, cool for a few minutes on the pan as stated in the recipe then transfer to wire rack.  I agree that they're better the next day, the sweetness is more pronounced.  A new keeper!

I just made these tonight and they are fabulous! I did what others suggest and used 3oz of the chopped macadamia nuts and about 5oz of white choclate chips. It was just perfect. However, I only got 18 decent-sized cookies from the dough. I will make these again and again.

Needs more vanilla, the dough was a little bland. I would cut back on the butter too as they were to oily.

These were fabulous! The only thing I changed was I halved the amount of chocolate chips & macadamia nuts.

These cookies are amazing! At first I was hesitant to use the recipe since it doesn't call for brown sugar. I'm so glad that I gave it a try because these are some of the best cookies I've ever made. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter and the cookies taste wonderful.  The only change i would make is to double the recipe and make much bigger cookies.  The teaspoon size is very small and when i thin of these cookies, i picture nice big ones.  Other than that these are delicious and get a very pretty golden brown...just don't leave in a minute too long or they get too brown!

Delicious basic cookie recipe!
I did it with white chocolate and drained and chopped maraschino cherries instead of the macadamias.
Oh my, so yummy. Perfect!! My girls loved it and so did my husband.

I used 1/2 and 1/2 of white sugar and brown sugar.I felt like they were a little too buttery or greasy. I also think they probubly need more baking soda, they were a little flat. If I do use this recipe again I will probubly makje changes.They were also really sweet for me.

Excellent recipe! Easy, with great results. I made these with my boyfriend, who hasn't baked cookies since he was a little kid, and he had a great time. :)  I think the fact that they were so easy and had such awesome results really helped turn him on to baking!  The cookies just melt in your mouth. It made exactly 36 for me, too, and they were gone in a couple of days!

I wish I had read through more reviews before trying these.  Although they tasted good, mine turned out very thin, crumbly, and flat, and I was hoping to give these as a gift.  I agree with doubling the batter since there were too many nuts/chocolate and it didn't yield many cookies.  Also I would probably reduce the temp. to 350.

These were REALLY good.  Tasted just like the Mrs. Field's kind that was my favorite as a kid.  I froze most of the dough, but the few that I baked turned out perfectly.  I only wish that this recipe made a larger batch.

I really liked this recipe. It did not look like the picture. At first they were waaayyy too thin so I added a little flour. I had no white chocolate so I used almond bark, and it was very good. 
Most people who tried these cookies would bite into one then look up and say, "Wow these are good."

This is THE BEST cookie ever!!!  I doubled the recipe for the dough.  I used 1 6 oz can of macadamias and 12 oz white chocolate chips.  They turned out beautifully golden brown and PERFECT!  Everyone raved about them.  I am making more today!

Since I couldn't find any cheap macadamias, I subbed them with cashewnuts and groundnuts. A friend said the groundnuts drown out the other tastes, so maybe I should've used 'softer' nuts, like walnuts.
Also, they turned out flat, so maybe I should omit the baking soda?

They turned out ok, but they tasted much like ordinary cookies to me.

Nice, but not worth the cost of the nuts, in my opinion. But perhaps I should have used the salted macadamia's?

What can I say except excellent cookies!  Didn't change a thing except used a whole bag of white chocolate chips.  Everybody loved them.

These cookies were very good - I, myself, DID expect a little more flavor though -  I made these for desert last Christmas - and they were a hit -

these cookies were great!  i cut the sugar in half and they still turned out fine.  my only complaint (if you can complain about such a thing) is that i doubled the recipe, and found the amount of chocolate chips a bit excessive - and i only used a 12 oz bag.

This is really a good recipe. Took a few of them to work with me and they loved them. I plan to one day go into buisness for myself and this recipe I will surely use. I think it will be a good seller.

These were good but after they cooled they were a little hard.  Maybe I made them too big?  I like cookies that are rather cake-like so maybe this isn't the best recipe for me.  Will try again.

These are very tasty cookies. I doubled the recipe, and substituted half of the sugar with the new splenda bake sugar.  Turned out great!  Nice dough to work with, very soft and not crumbly at all.  Even doubling it, I only ended up with 4 dozen plus 3 more cookies... so 51 cookies in all.  I used my cookie scoop too.  So I"M not sure how anyone could get 4 dozen out of a single recipe?  I used Nestles white chocolate chips, a bag and a can of Macadamia nuts.  I will definitely make these again, thanks for the recipe!

great cookies!  i regret not doubling the batch.  they were gone in no time.  just be careful not to burn on the bottoms as they darken fairly quickly.

I made these cookies last night for my Bunco group of 12 & everyone raved over them. They tasted very good & everyone asked for the recipe.

These cookies were a good but a bit soggy.  I usually use REAL butter for every recipe but this time I used "I can't Believe it's not Butter". I feel that this recipe would have turned out better had I used the real butter.  But they were still VERY good and didn't last long!
