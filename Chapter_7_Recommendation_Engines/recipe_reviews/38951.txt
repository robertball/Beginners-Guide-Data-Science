This was too easy and quick!  I added candy corn when I broke it up to serve to add a festive touch.  Next time I will cut the carmels into quarters.  They were just a little too much of a mouthful.  This would make a nice holiday gift!

It's a good idea to cut caramel squares into smaller pieces.  I thought this snack was okay but I will not make it again.

I have made this recipe a few times now and always leave with the first empty bowl.  You have to cut the caramels in to 8ths, they would be too large otherwise.  I am trying the new Kraft caramel bits this week.  Hopefully that will save time unwrapping and cutting the caramels.

This recipe was OK. Seemed too chewy to me and others.

I made this for my teenage daughters New Years Eve party.  Not only did the girls adore it, but my husband went nuts over it as well!  I did cut the carmels into thirds - otherwise it would have been too much!  I don't know what cereal everyone is using, I used Corn Chex.  I'm making this again for a BBQ this weekend (at hubbie's request), and won't be changing a thing.  Very addictive.
