I used Hot sausage instead of hamburger. Turned out great.  Definitely in the rotation.

i shredded the zucchini in the morning and let it air dry for a few hours. I still ended up following the footnotes tip of spooning the excess (~1/2 cup) after the first serving was cut and some minutes later. could've been cottage cheese liquid though too. 
I would make it again. hubby really liked it.

I made this for a dinner with friends and they loved it. It would have been even better if I could have dried the zucchini noodles more but overall it was a favorite.
