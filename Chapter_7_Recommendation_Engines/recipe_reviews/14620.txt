this recipe has been such a joy! i have a lot to say...
1. it is not that spicy even tho it's called "spicy shredded beef" so if you want spicy add hot sauce
2. definately don't over use the cumin...the called for amount is plenty.
3. i added 1/3 cup of sugar when i added the tomato sauce. this gave a hint of sweetness to the meat that was just divine
4. do be sure to add water as it cooks so it never gets dry.
5. cook for at least 2 hours...the longer the better and make sure you have a very tight fitting lid to keep moisture in

i use this beef for so many things but a favorite in our home is the mexican dish machaca con huevo

first i heat up a few tbsp of veg. oil then add sliced onion. cook this for a few minutes then add the shredded beef. simmer for 10 minutes. then add scrambled egg (the ratio of egg to beef is up to you but usually 1 egg per serving of beef is good) cook the scrambled egg with the beef for at least 10 minutes until the egg is fully cooked. serve with warm corn tortillas. this is to die for delicious!

i highly recommend this recipe for so many things (tacos/enchiladas/machaca/burritos) it's just divine and so so simple

I loved this shredded beef! I could tell it wasn't going to be that spicy, so I added powdered cayenne pepper and chili powder along with the cumin. I used 4 garlic cloves instead of one, and I used diced tomatoes with green chiles. I only needed an hour and a half for the meat to become so tender that I almost didn't even need to shred it with forks. I served this on corn tortillas with all of the taco fixings. I love that this recipe only used a pound of meat, rather than the 3 or 4 pound roasts others use (with only two people eating, it makes it hard to finish what one of those recipes yields). This is so much better than ground beef!

I had trouble shredding the beef after it was cooked, however I think I used the wrong cut of beef. Overall this recipe made a delicious filling for my beef enchiladas -- a huge improvement over the usual ground beef.

Super!!!! This will be one of my favorites from now on. I add one chopped onion and one can of green chilles to this recipe. I don't have to add more liquid but I have to stir it often to prevent sticking. The beef was so tender! My husband loves it! We made burritos but I will make it again for other stuff. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Excellent! I doubled the cumin and used diced tomatoes with green chilies. I browned the meat, added the spices, then dumped everything in my slow cooker. Cooked on low for 4 hours and the meat was cooked perfectly. I took the cover off for a little while after that and let the liquid evaporate. Loved it, thank you! :)

Man, this is fabulous !!  I can't list the number of different things you can do with this.  We loved it so much after trying it the first time, that the next time I did 5 pounds of beef, shredded it and froze it. Every time I wanted to make tacos, chimis, sloppy joes...anything...I'd just grab a bag out of the freezer.  It's really versatile and my family (5 teenagers) loves it !!

My husband loved it!
I did everything the original recipe directed. I served it with Baja Tortilla wraps, shredded lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and Kraft shredded mexican cheese. Reminded me of those really good tacos we had during our vacation in Mexico! Thanks for the recipe!

I quadrupled this recipe and cut up a roast, cooking it in an electric skillet. I also used some salsa verde in it. My sisters and their families came over and we made soft tacos with the meat, adding our favorite ingredients. Most of it was eaten, leaving me with just enough for lunch the next day out of the 4 lbs that I cooked! I've been looking for a recipe like this, and I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe is state of the art! there is room to work with the taste and I agree with the amount of cummin
used to spice the beef. I did make three changes 1. used 6 oz. of Pacifico
imported beer,2. Caned mexican style tomatoes And 3. choose to grill this in the back yard (because its so hot). 
Bottom line,I would give this a thumbs up for any gathering.
                      Happy Cooking America!

Awesome recipe! First time I made it, it was kinda bland. So, i waited till the 2nd time I made it and doctored it up a bit. I added 1/4 cup korean chili flakes, 2 beef bouillion, 3 serrano peppers,1 roasted poblano pepper ( we like it spicy) and 7 finely grated fresh garlic,6 cups of water gradually added to the cooking process to ensure it didnt get dry. Took 2 1/2 hrs and I served it over white rice... We loved it and definetly will make again. Also, it made the house smell so dang good lol.

I used canned tomatoes with green chiles, 1 tsp chopped garlic, 1 chopped onion, 1 cup beef broth and put it in the crockpot. It was so easy to shred it while still in the pot just using one fork. It came out great.

This was very good, but I did find it a tad bland...it just was missing something, haven't yet figured what that might be.

You can make this work free by taking a beef chuck roast and pouring a pint of salsa (I use spicy) over the meat and cooking on low for 4-6 hrs. Shred in juices and enjoy.

I made this for the first time this evening. But rather than babysitting it on the stove for two hours, I opted to attempt it in the crock pot.  I am so glad I did, because it saved me a lot of time and trouble!  First off, I didn't have to cut it into 1-inch pieces.  I just browned the whole roast in a little olive oil and popped the whole thing into the crock pot.  I then covered it with the canned tomatoes and spices, threw in a tiny bit of red wine and some beef broth for a little extra liquid, and cooked it on low for 10 hours.  When we were ready to eat, the roast was practically falling apart and shred very easily.  My first taste after shredding it was really quite bland and dry, so I spooned quite a bit of the liquid back over it and stirred it as the beef sucked it right up.  I then tasted again, and wow, what a difference!  Moist and flavorful!  Next time I make this, I will likely do the same thing with the crock pot for cooking it, but not omit simmering on the stove in the liquid after shredding it.  I have a feeling that step makes all the difference in the flavor for this dish.  I served it with homemade whole wheat tortillas and all your usual taco fixings.  If you are looking for a little extra heat or more flavor, try adding a little oregano, cilantro, chili powder or cayenne pepper, and/or a little more cumin (I wound up needing a full teaspoon).  Really, this is one of those recipes that leaves a lot of room for customization.

Soooo awesome!.. I think a better name would be "seasoned shredded beef" since I wouldn't call it spicy!  It was perfect in my soft tacos; served with rice, beans, guacamole, cheese... :)  My only change was to add a tablespoon of sugar as another reviewer suggested when adding the tomatoes and an extra clove of garlic.  The meat was so tender I just used one fork and it broke apart but wasn't at all stringy.

This was ok, but I think it lacked flavor and there wasn't anything in it that was spicy as the title would have you believe. If I make this again I would probably use rotel in place of the diced tomatoes since I think it would give it more flavor.

This is a GREAT start-up for any mexician dish; you can also use chicken instead.  I also add other mexician spices; chilli powder, garlic, and then make chimmi's out of it. You can also cook up in a crock pot.  Really, really good.

Yummy! I added a can of corn, a little sugar, and some grated onion (that's how I hide it from the kiddos). It made excellent burritos that I made for company with very picky kids and they ate it up!

The recipe came out very tasty, but I did add one minced jalapeno pepper for flavor.  I never did shred the beef, but cooked it a little less time and just served it on hot rice.  In addition, I used diced, fresh tomatoes from my garden instead of canned tomatoes.  At the very end, I just added a tiny bit of water to keep it from burning.  The sauce was nice!

This was not very tasty to me at all.  I added green chiles to spice it up but it still didn't have enough flavor.  I will keep looking for a good spicy beef recipe.

Yum, yum, YUM! Okay so I hate when people completely recreate the recipe and then rate for good or bad. With that said I did make a few changes but I feel that they were slight enough that they did not alter the integrity of the recipe so I'll still rate. First of all I turn anything I can into a slow cooker meal. So I browned the meat just for a few minutes and then tossed it and all the ingredients in the slow cooker and cooked for several hours on low. I used a can of tomatoes with green chilies (instead of just tomatoes) and added a small amount (probably 1 tsp) of beef broth and around 2 tsps white sugar.  I think those small changes augmented the flavor beautifully. I used a chuck roast cut up and I the slow cooker really helped get the meat to a nice tender state that shredded well. I mostly put in the sugar to neutralize the acidity of the tomatoes but it actually gave it just the slightest sweet taste which was so good! We used the meat for tacos with diced fresh tomatoes, cilantro and sour cream. Wow! My husband loved these and my almost 4 year old adored them. A winner for our family.

Tasty and a quick meal! I had some leftover roast beef already shredded, so it was a quick meal. We made burritos and shredded aged cheddar to wrap with it. Very fresh and juicy!

Yum! I used an 1-lb beef arm roast, and added a lot more garlic, cayenne pepper, a small can of diced jalapenos, and used Rotel instead of plain tomatoes as someone else suggested. I also shredded it with forks while still hot in the pan instead of waiting for it to cool. It was fabulous! This recipe is going to become a staple at our house! I plan to try it again tomorrow with pork and BBQ seasonings.

I thought this was pretty good.  I think next time I will throw the whole steak in the crock pot and let it cook all day with all the required ingredients.  Made good burritos.

I found this was a good foundation to some Tex Mex type tacos. I added an entire onion, sliced and sauteed that. I doubled the garlic. And I added a chipotle pepper to bring it more to the spicy. It was great served with flour tortillas and one of the Southwest slaw recipes on this site. Using the purple cabbage gave it color and great texture when paired with the meat inside the shell.

I give it 4 stars as written, mostly because the name is very misleading.  There is nothing spicy in the recipe.  I had 3 lbs of round roast that I used, increasing the cumin and garlic accordingly.  Instead of plain tomatoes, I substituted about 2 cups (for 3 lbs) of medium salsa.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I think that if you like milder flavor, it would be good as written.

This shredded beef is really very good.  Made it first exactly as written, wasnt very spicy so second batch I added a few things. 

 I used a 4 lb chuck roast, added all the ingrediants in the original recipe then added, a medium chopped onion, 1/2 tablespoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 tablespoon chili powder, two-10 ounce cans diced tomatoes with green chilis, 2 cloves of crushed garlic, few dashes of salt and pepper, a few dashes tobasco sauce and then 1/4 cup water.  I put the whole thing in my crock pot and let it cook on low for 9 hours.  Shredded the beef and served it on warmed flour tortilla shells with sour cream, shredded lettuce, cheese and black olives.  It was a great dinner.  Like I said as written it was very good but just needed a little more spice in my opinion, if you are not a fan of a lot of spice make this as written, if you like to kick up the spice try adding what I did.  Thank You for sharing !!!!

An outstanding recipe and so easy to prepare! The only downside, if downside there be, is that it took three hours of simmering to reach the desired state of doneness to make for easy shredding. But that is a small price to pay for this excellent dish. I used double the diced tomatoes specified and saved the superb excess gravy at the end for serving with the beef over rice or couscous. Doing this also solves the problem of possibly running out of liquid during cooking; no need to lift the lid and periodically check. As others suggested, I added sugar (actually it was Xylitol, 2 Tbs) to cut down on the acidity and also a small tin of chilies.  Also added 1 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce and a bay leaf. After shredding the beef and putting it back in the skillet, I added 1 Tbs of taco seasoning mix - Bill Echols's wonderful recipe on this site - to kick up the spiciness a notch.  This recipe is very much a keeper.  Thank you kindly Teresa!

I feel like this recipe was lacking flavor so I added a packet of taco seasoning and some red peppers. Which made it alot better. The meat was very tender as I did it in the crockpot. Also alot healthier than ground beef but the old man didnt care for this. Luckly I had alot of topping to enhance the flavors.

This was a little wetter than we liked, so I would drain the tomatoes.  I also added a burrito flavor packet and some hot sauce for a little more kick.

Sooooo good!  I didn't think it was going to turn out spicy as written so I used two 10 oz cans of Rotel with chilies and 2 more cloves of garlic.  No water was needed. I used lean stew meat to cut down on prep and it fell apart in the pan and didn't need shredding. Fantastic for shredded beef tacos!

I made this for dinner tonight. I get tired of the same old things but my kids don't always like to have me monkey with the tried and true. This was excellent. I used stewed tomatoes so they had bell peppers and onions in them or I would have added them. I prefer spicey to hot, but I did add a healthy dose of black pepper and I thought this was excellent as is. Rotel would add nice heat. I used an eye of round roast that I cubed. It is very lean and can be tough, but after a couple of hours simmering, I didn't need a fork to shred it. Used the back of a wooden spoon and it broke apart. Allowed it to simmer with the lid off for a few minutes and I had a multipurpose filling. Delish!

SOOOOO Good!  Here in Southern-California, there are quite a few good, family recipes people swear by.  The only change I made to this recipe is using beef broth instead of water when cooking the beef to tenderize.  I finally found a recipe I can proudly share with my friends!

This receipe is so good!  I've made it many times since discovering it a few months ago.  I made some changes after reading other reviews.  I usually double the amount of garlic, chop up a fresh (seeded) jalapeno and add it with the can of tomatoes (I use tomatoes canned with diced jalapenos), I add about 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder and red pepper flakes when adding the cumin and salt.  We like it spicy, and this recipe certainly is!

This was a huge hit!!!  I upped the heat by adding about 1/2 tsp cheyanne and substituted the canned tomatoes with canned tomatoes with green chilis.  One more tip you don't need to cut the meat down into 1" cubes I'd go with about 2 - 3 inches it will make shredding easier!

Very good ! The night before I had BBQ  a pork loin roast with a dry rub of brown sugar and red pepper flakes and such. I pulled the pork and used it in the recipe instead of the beef.  It was awesome !

I ended up cooking the meat for 5 hours total and because of it did not come out tender at all. I'll try again with a better cut of meet. This recipe has good potential.

Loved this easy recipe, we used it in burritos with the "refried beans without the refry recipe " on this site. I added jalapeño peppers as we like our food "muy piquante" but that's our personal taste, not a criticism of the recipe! I'll definitely make this again.

I just don't think this recipe has the gusto to be called spicy. First, I had difficulty shredding it, if you want to shred meat, use a rump roast cooked about 8 hrs in a crock pot. The ratio of tomato vs. meat was too high, I ended up removing all the tomatoes and adding  chili powder, onion salt, more cumin, smoked paprika and cayenne pepper after taste- test and  realizing the recipe was not going to be spicy at all. Dinner was delayed until I was done" rescuing" it, much to the chagrin of my family. Next time, I think I will use a rump roast and spicy rotel.

Fantastic!  Not spicy as written, but I used a can of "hot" rotel and a can of garlic diced tomatoes, along with a little more meat and it was perfect.  I'll make this again and again.  Thanks so much!

It was good but not great. It was definitely NOT spicy at all I actually felt like the tomatoes made it a little sweet. The tomato taste was a little overwhelming and it needed a little "something", don't know what but something. I might try it again but I'll make some adjustments next time. But overall not bad and my kids liked it.

This is a great base from which to add your personal favorites.  I followed the recipe exactly and it worked well.  You will want to add some cayenne or possibly tomatoes with green chiles if you want more of a kick.  Next time I'll increase the garlic and make more so I can freeze some.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good but surprised that it wasn’t more “spicy” which is ok.  Adults added more kick.  We enjoyed on warm soft corn tortillas, topped with sliced avacado, chopped cilantro, white onions, sour cream and diced tomatoes.  Will be making again for sure to put in enchiladas.  Thanks for the recipe :D

This was so easy and tasted like it was a lot of effort.  I omitted the oil and stuck everything in the crockpot on high for 4 hours.  It shredded up just perfect.

I liked this recipe but I did add some other spices to it since it didn't sound like it would be very spicy 'as is'. I added 1/2 teas. crushed red pepper flakes and later sprinkled cayenne pepper for a bit more bite. I also sprinkled a little bit of sugar on it to counter the tang of the tomatoes, per another reviewer's suggestion. LOVED it! I bought tortillas for it but next time will use taco shells or chips. Great recipe.

Very good and easy to prepare.  As others have pointed out, a garlic clove and a little cumin don't make this recipe "spicy". I added some hot sauce to the mix and that helped. Served this over rice.

This is an excellent recipe for a base shred beef. You should notice there is not one ingredient to make it spicy. I suggest adding any spicy ingredient to your liking and this recipe will work for you.

I used extra garlic, 2 cans Rotel with chilis and added onion and a jalapeno to punch it up. Pretty good, but once you add toppings to the taco, husband & I couldn't tell much difference between this & regular ground beef...and the ground beef is 10x easier & faster. Will stick with the ground beef for now.

I altered the recipe because I'm allergic to tomatoes. I used a jar of salsa verde, a can of green chilies and added two sliced onions. After two hours the meat just fell apart! I would definitely recommend this recipe as a starting point for spicy shredded beef.

Great flavor!  Make a lot and once and freeze the leftovers for easy dinners another night.  Tacos, burritos, enchiladas... this shredded beef is good for anything.  I recommend using the Frys/Kroger brand Fire Roasted Salsa Style canned tomatoes.  They add some kick to any mexican dish.

This has got to be my favoritest recipe ever. It was delicious. I followed it almost exactly except that I added Jalapeno peppers and Serrano peppers right at the end after I shredded the beef. I serve it with white rice. There are never any leftovers.

Yummy!  I had 2 lb of beef, so I doubled everything.  At 2 hours, there was way too much liquid, so I removed the lid and simmered for another hour.  While hot, it was still too juicy for tacos, but as it cooled, it turned into the perfect taco.  However, it was almost gone by then because my guests and I had been picking at it all afternoon.  The only change I made was the addition of green chilis.  If you like cumin, don't be shy.  The cumin smell is overpowering initially, but is delightful in the end. I'll be making this again soon.

Excellent recipe! Easy and delicious. I used a can of stewed tomatoes and cooked it 1 1/2 hours. Next time I'll try adding fresh garlic and chilies.

This was very good. I wanted tacos, but didn't feel like the ground beef, so decided to try using another cut of beef. I tried this recipe and it tasted great. I did make some modifications. I added 3 cloves of garlic, sauted white onions, a pack of taco seasoning, cayenne pepper, a couple of diced adobe peppers. I topped the tacos with sour cream, refried beans, green onions, shredded cheese, and salsa verde. These were awesome and I will be making this again!

We enjoyed this beef.  It really isn't that spicy at all.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with chile peppers.  I think i will add something to spice it up a bit next time.  Maybe some green chiles.

This was outrageous !!!  It was the first time I have made pulled beef.  My husband loved it.  He said he will not eat burritos out anymore.  I do what some others recommended.  I added cayenne pepper and Chili Powder.  It was excellent and soooooo easy.  Great Recipe !!!!!

I actually made this in the crockpot so I cut back on canned tomatoes. It turned out really good. Next time I will add jalapeno to give it more heat.

Have probably made this 15 or 20 times now.  It is my standard base for a variety of Tex-Mex dishes, from burritos to nacho's to salads.  

I like things fairly spicy though, so I do modify the bsaic recipe a bit.  I use a small can of Rotel & a small can of salsa.  Often I will throw in 2-4 chopped   chipolte peppers.  It even works good with a little beer splashed in.

All in all a good base for experimentation.  As long as you don;t let it totaly dry out, its hard to mess up.

very good and tender, but not quite 5 stars. I added some chrushed red peppers to the mix. It was not as spicy as I like, but still yummy.

My husband and I had this for dinner the other night. It was very good and exactly what I expected it to be: tasty taco filling. I had no problems with the beef drying out while it was simmering. I made no changes to the recipe. I think my cubes might have been too small, because I had trouble putting two forks in to shred. I ended up using my fingers and that was fine. I had a bunch of tomato stuff left at the end, and I just pitched it. The meat was the yummy part, although I should note that it wasn't spicy.

Per another, I added a can of mild green chiles and threw this in this in the crockpot with a little beef broth after the frying part.  Came home a few hours later and viola! The meat was ready for tacos! Not the best beef tacos I've ever had but they were pretty tasty and my family ate them all! Thanks Teresa!

I added a can of mild green chilies, omitted the browning step and the oil from the recipe, then cooked it in the crock pot.  Terrific with flour tortillas and shredded cheese!  Each family member gave it 5 stars!

It didn't turn out very spicy, I added more spices (like some chile powder that helped it out) and it seems that the tomatoes made it too saucy.  It did turn out tender, I am not sure if I will make this again

Super easy to make! I only cook for 1 so keep in mind this recipe does take 2 hours if you want the beef tender and shreddable. It wasn’t spicy, and I added red pepper flakes and it still lacked spicy-ness  ... but I did add hot sauce to my taco. I also diced up a little bit of onion, doubled the cumin and eyeballed the rest. DELICIOUSNESS ! I think a can of Rotel instead of diced tomatoes would work well in this recipe too.

I consider all recipes just a guide, so I made this with Rotel tomatoes instead of traditional and it was fabulous!  My daughter and I are big fans of southwest food and we will make this time and again!  I even kept the left over broth to have with rice.

The meat was fantastic!  The only changes I made was that I used a can of mild Ro- tel and added 1/2 tsp of onion powder and a teaspoon of lime juice you the meat after it was shredded and returned to the pan.  Otherwise I followed it exactly and the cooking method was spot on!

I'm using it tonight in combination with another recipe from this site for enchiladas so will post a follow up after we eat!  All by itself tho, the meat was so tender and flavorful.
Thanks for sharing!

Followed another reviewer's notes (Melissa) and it's awesome when adding juice back to the shredded beef.  This is really delicious.

WOW this is delicious! Instead of regular diced tomatoes I used 2 10oz cans of my two favorite ROTEL diced tomatoes flavors. Was great fresh, and maybe even better after being in the fridge overnight!

Very good basic recipe! As mentioned by others, it is not exactly spicy. In addition to the tomato, I added a 1/2 C of salsa & half of a red bell pepper & half of a green bell pepper. Very yummy in burritos! I will make extra to freeze next time.

Love this recipe!  I will never use ground beef again for Mexican food.  Instead of the salt and cumin, I used half a packet of taco seasoning.  I also used two 10 oz. cans of Rotel.  Let it simmer for about 2 1/2 - 3 hours.  Absolutely delicious!  So so easy!

Shredding the beef is excellent idea! I use fresh tomatoes from the garden (peeled them and cubed them) also added one small onion... The only thing I did wrong was to add to much sugar because I tried to cut down the accidity from the tomatoes...

My whole family loves this stuff! Sometimes I mix in a can of drained black beans if the kids have friends over and we make EASY soft tacos with it.

This was an awesome way to use up chuck steak!  I read the reviews about it not being spicy, so I used some cayenne and 3 chipotle peppers-I had never used them before, and they didn't smell spicy, but boy did it spice it up!  Whew!!
I cooked the meat for about 3-4 hours and I was skeptical about it being tender, because it still seemed tough when I tried to break it apart with the spoon, but after I cooled it, it was completely fork tender and shredded perfectly!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe is the best ever!  We have it all the time.  A lot of times I double it, and save half in the freezer.  Sometimes I don't actually shred the beef, and I keep it chunks, its good that way too.  I have also once used ground beef, because I didn't have the roast on hand.  It was just as good...but you still have to cook it just as long, for that good yummy flavor.

This was super yummy!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  I did add a cup of water when I added the tomatoes and had to add more water towards the end.  I put the mixture on top of Indian Flat Bread and it was so tasty even the 2 year old liked it!

This was so delicious.  Whereas some reviewers say to not over-do the cumin, I tripled it and then added a dash or two more.  I would suggest some kind of hot sauce - or maybe some cayenne pepper.  This is a great recipe to make in bulk (5 lbs +) and freeze the extras.  I was a little concerned during the cooking, as it didn't "look" how I thought it was going to.  But by the time the two hours was up - it looked and smelled perfect!  Thanks for this recipe!

Good stuff...I also added Rotel, we all like spice. I cooked it the full 2 hours, on low. I had NO problems with drying out, and never added liquid. Could be the seal on my pan and lid, or could be that the lid is glass, so I didn't have to keep opening to check. Anyway, will be a staple. Thanks for a great recipe!

I cooked this in my slow cooker.  Since I was cooking two pounds of meat, I added one can diced tomatoes and on can Rotel.  This was absolutely delicious.  I had some home made refried beans in the freezer that I used with this to make burritos.  My husband really liked it too.  He's taking leftovers for his lunch.  That's when I know he really likes something.  I will be making this again for enchildas.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I have served it to company many times and everyone loves it.  I made a 3 pound roast and used two cans of tomatoes and doubled the other ingredients and it was just right.  I never had to add water to it either, it didn't dry out!

This was really good! I prefer shredded beef to ground beef in my mexican dishes.  Since I didn't have diced tomatoes I used tomato sauce. Yes, it freezes excellent!
