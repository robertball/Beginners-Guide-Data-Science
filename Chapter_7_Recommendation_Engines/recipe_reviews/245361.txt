Even if you just use the recipe a basic guide you can't go wrong. These ingredients just work well together. The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the letter. It is very tasty. I've made it several times since but I follow the recipe more loosely. I like to add more of the liquids and use the more fatty portion of a whole pork loin instead of shoulder. I sometimes add a diced potato or serve it over mashed potatoes and/or a buttermilk biscuit.
As Chef John always says "This is you cooking"
I say, don't be afraid to change things up a bit, but  always follow the recipe first if you rate. The ratings become meaningless otherwise.

Amazing!  I've made this a couple of times now:  first for just my family, and then because we loved it so much, we made it for guests when they came over. Everyone absolutely loved it. This is definitely one of my favorite stew recipes, ever. What I loved best about it is that it actually pleases a wide variety of tastes. My father loves things to be well seasoned. My mother does not like things to be spicy. My husband is quite picky. This was perfect for everyone (the horseradish in this dish is enough to give a good flavor, but isn't enough to make it hot). This recipe is perfect as is. Thank you!

One of the best stew recipes I’ve ever tried, incredibly forgiving and versatile. Chef: please throw up some variations you’ve had success with.For my part, I’ve tried adding fennel, potatoes (recommend roasting the spuds separately until browned, and stirring them in before service) mushrooms, even celery root... I double the cream and stock, because the broth is scant in the original, and it’s delicious sopped with a crusty, rustic bread.Beautiful recipe base. My family begs for th

I had pork steaks to use so I used them but otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  The sauce is AMAZING.  This is a wonderful dish. I served it over pasta, and while that was good, I felt like it diluted the flavors.  I think I should treat it like a stew and up the vegies and enjoy it without the pasta.  This is really going on the list.  Pork shoulder...and crusty bread.    Simple and amazing.  thanks Chef.

loved this recipe, we live in a rural community so don't have access to fresh herbs this time of year so I used dried ones. Followed recipe up until last cooking stage and finished it in my oven 350F. with cover on pot. served with mashed potatoes and biscuits.

This was a definite hit -- I'll make it again. The only change I made was to use half & half instead of the heavy cream. And I tied the sprigs of herbs together so they'd be easier to remove before serving.

Very nice stew, I enjoyed the contrasting flavors.  I didn't have horseradish so I omitted it.  I put 2 small apples into the stew and let the stew simmer for 3 hours on low heat 130 C in the oven in a dutch oven.  Didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used one cup of apple juice and a tablespoon of regular vinegar.  This is a very tasty and budget friendly week night dish.

Delicious. I did use a few substitutions (eg. grated ginger root for the horseradish, and edamame beans for the peas), but I loved how the flavours came together in this dish. My wife loved it too.

Very nice.  Served with mashed potatoes and only the addition of mushrooms.  I'm anxious to start changing it up and seeing what more I can accomplish with this recipe.  Thank you for offering it.

Oh my, this was delicious! It takes a genius to combine the cheapest cut of meat with the cheapest produce and come up with an outstanding dinner. The only thing I did differently was when I tasted the broth about half an hour before serving, I decided to add some red pepper flakes. Don't skip the apple on top, it adds a lot. In keeping with the fabulous frugal theme, I served with a basic corn bread. Next time I'll double the carrots and celery.

Really loved the flavors, will make this again for sure. I found cooking the peas for 10 min was too long, I'd throw them in 1 min before serving. Carrots got a bit mushy, again, I'd throw them in later. Pork was a bit dry, probably because I trimmed it a lot and cooked it extra to reduce the sauce. Really loved the apples on top. A winner, inexpensive and simple to make.

Fabulous and so different!  One can use most any veggies.  I did increase the sauce a bit based on others' comments.  A HUGE hit for a dinner party last night!

This was one of those recipes that sort of seems like it might be good and turns out to be knock your socks off good - at least that's what we thought.  I had a pork tenderloin that I cut into bite sized pieces, pan fried.  I added that to a slow cooker rather than a pan and threw in broccoli, yam, turnip, acorn squash, carrots, brussel sprouts and potatos.   I threw in some chicken stock and then made the sauce with the cream and poured it over the ingredients in the slow cooker. I cooked that on high for about 5 hours and it was excellent.  We'll definitely make this again

Used as a base recipe with changes based on what I had available.  3.5 lb pork loin instead of shoulder, 5 celery stalks, 4 large carrots, large yellow onion... used an extra 1/4 cup of cream and 2 total cups of chicken broth... all other ingredients were straight from recipe in quantity...  Made 2 very large bowls and 4 normal to large bowls, all very hearty...  let simmer for 2.5 hours on low to ensure tender pork and carrots...  Served with some cornbread muffins that really popped when they soaked up the liquid.  Family has added this to our monthly menu due to overwhelming response.  Chef John is a household name for us.

Have made this several times. Great recipe! Only tweak I made was to add a bit more apple cider vinegar... We love the tang and how it balances the deliciously creamy sauce - YUMMY:)

I made it exactly like it was written. My husband and I really liked it well. It had a little too much meat for us, I'm going to use a little less next time and add chunked potatoes. I did add mushrooms like Chef John suggested. The taste was really amazing, can't wait to have it again!

This was divine. I was a little short on meat but made the full recipe otherwise.  I put it over rice & the extra sauce was scrumptious. I added a parsnip & decided a zucchini was necessary for color enhancement. That turned out to be a wise choice & was added later than the other veggies. Actually cooked it about 20 minutes less as everything was tender, but I had to wait for the rice to finish. (I did add extra broth & juice to keep it from sticking.)
