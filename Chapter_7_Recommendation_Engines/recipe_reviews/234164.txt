Followed the directions exactly, the "dough" turned out more like batter, runny and sticky and in no way possible to roll into balls... I ended up adding more flour and dropping by spoonful onto the cookie sheet and just sprinkling with sugar.

These cookies are delicious, but the batter is too runny to roll into balls.  I just dropped by the spoonful onto the cookie sheet and didn't put sugar.  I made a glaze of powdered sugar, water, ginger, cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  Then drizzled the glaze over the cookies.

Not good. I made the batter according to the recipe  and it was a sticky mess. Not able to shape at all. Looked like muffin or cake mix. I added another cup of flour and it still wasn't able to shape. I spooned onto the cookie sheet and sprinkled with sugar. They came out like a cake/bread type cookie. My kids don't like cake so they tried and wont eat. Bummer.

I read some reviews saying that the recipe was too runny, so I left out the applesauce. Other then that, I followed the recipe as directed (although I think I baked them for a few minutes longer). They turned out great!

way too runny.  added some more flour, but got nervous. ended up like muffin tops but couldn't taste the ginger.  Instead, served like muffins/cakes with applesauce - but not a gingersnap.  Think i'll just buy the molasses next time!

My daughter loved making these. But instead of flattening them like it said, she left them like balls. They still turned out fine and delicious! :)

To salvage the recipe I had to add 1 cup of flour, 1/3 cup of sugar, and a dash more cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to ensure the flavor still came out right. The dough was still too soft and sticky to roll in sugar, so I divided it out onto the pan using a small cookie scoop, sprinkled the blobs with sugar, and pressed down lightly with a fork. The cookies came out soft and cake-like. They're fine, but not what I was going for.
