I'm one of the few who did NOT find this recipe bland, however, I did make a few alterations - used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta. Added basil & oregano to the cheese. In addition to the shredded mozzarella I also used a little shredded cheddar & monterey jack. Would probably be good with added corn, too. My husband loved it, and my toddler ate a little bit of it.

Awesome vegetarian dish, and I'm a meat eater!  I accidentally bought one can of black bean soup and one can of regular, and it still came out wonderfully.  I also added some oregano, basil and garlic powder (I was out of minced garlic) to the cheese mixture, and the spices were subtle but tasty.  I think if you add spices, this dish is great.

This lasagne is EXCELLENT.  I live in a dorm and find that the leftovers are as good, if not better than the first meal!  I add cumin and chili powder to the sauce as well as extra onion and green pepper to give it a southwestern flair.  I highly recommend this as a great alternative to standard lasagne!

I think that this recipe had definate potential. However, for my taste it was far far too dry and bland. Next time I will add much more pepper and hot sauce and at least another can of tomato sauce! Otherwise it just gets too crumbly and dry!

I prepared this for a vegetarian potluck and had rave reviews 
with requests for the recipe.  It has an interesting blend of 
flavors which can be adjusted to one's own taste (hot & spicy or
mild to suit you).  Any time the world's pickiest eater will have
seconds, you know it has to be good.

This was made a head and placed in a Nesco 18 Qt roaster
oven, then reheated.  It actually taste better reheated and is
excellent for leftovers.

Pure comfort food! Of course I made a lot of changes based on what I had, personal preferences, and previous reviews: 1) Add cumin, sweet spanish paprika, and italian seasoning to the cheese mix, 2) Used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans, 3) Added 1/2 can of corn, 4) Used one large tomato instead of tomato sauce, 5) Made half a box of rotini and just mixed everything together before baking, 6) Used 2 cups shredded mexican cheese blend. Mmmmmm....

This recipe is excellent! My husband and friends all enjoyed it! The black beans really add a great flavor. I did use about a half-cup extra tomato sauce (actually, pureed canned tomatoes), and will use a bit more next time. I also made it with no-boil lasagna noodles, covered with tin foil, and baked about 10 minutes extra. Worked great. Thanks again!

This was good. It was not saucy enough for my tastes, but everyone liked it. Next time I will add more sauce to each layer.

My husband has become a vegetarian so I tried making this recipe.  It was OK, but very dry and sort of bland.  I added cayenne pepper and chili powder which helped the flavor, but it needed something to moisten it up.  Maybe more cheese?

This dish was very tasty and very easy to prepare.  I used the no bake lasagna noodles and made the prep time even shorter.

This is a really good recipe. I did modify it based on my own taste and what I had in the frig. I didn't have green pepper so I used red. I also used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and I seasoned it with basil and garlic powder. I noticed from other reviews that people said it was dry I only have one can of tomato sauce so I used tomato soup which added a tanginess to it.

I'm vegetarian and I like this lasagne better than ones that are overloaded with veggies to compensate for no meat.

This was really great.  I used some modifications that other suggested.  I used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans.  I use 8oz of tomato sauce and 8 oz-ish of salsa.  I used chedder and Montery Jack cheese.  It was great.

Normally, I try to make things exactly as written the first time, but I couldn't on this one.  I knew the lack of seasoning would be a problem, so I replaced the plain black beans with well-seasoned refried ones.  Also, I added just a bit of sauce to the bottom of the pan before starting to layer, so the noodles wouldn't stick, and covered the lasagna for the first half of cooking so it wouldn't dry out -- both tips I've taken from other lasagna recipes, and ones I would definitely recommend.  I added a can of chopped green chilis to the sauce and a few shakes of red chili flake to the ricotta, but those changes ended up being pretty negligible.  I did need more cheese, but I think I also ended up with one more layer, so that could be why.  The end result was tasty, but I have to give the recipe as written three stars, because of the lack of seasoning and questionable lasagna-building instructions.  Still, I'm pretty sure I'll make this again and I'm looking forward to the leftovers, so thanks!

Surprisingly good--and this is coming from someone who loves meat lasagna. :) I'll definitely make this again. I followed the recipe exactly and really liked it.

My veggie husband who eats anything.. requested that I not EVER make this again.  He said it had an odd taste.  He likes black beans and he likes lasagna but he says they don't belong together.  I've made other veggie lasagnas and he loves them, but this is a no go.  I don't see any other negative reviews but wanted to share our experience. I would not have selected any stars but that was not an option.  It made me choose at least one star.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Instead of the canned tomato sauce, I just used a jar of pasta sauce to give it a little more flavor (since people had said that it was a little bland) and it worked out perfectly.

Yummy but needs more pasta sauce than listed in the recipe... tends to be a little dry. Tomato-basil sauce works well.

This was a very good recipe, though I am with those who said it was a little bland.  I added cumin, oregano, basil, and fresh cilantro to the cheese mixture, and added a can off diced tomatoes "Italian style" (drained) to the black bean mixture.  It was definitely not dry, but needed some more salt and pepper, maybe more garlic.  Really good though! Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe, though I did use vegetarian refried beans in place of mashing 1 can of black beans.  And since a few people thought the dish was bland, I used an entire of roasted garlic pasta sauce instead of the 15 ounces of tomato sauce.  Even though, I tasted this while I was heating the mixture and still had to adjust the seasonings (I mean, add more), so I'm knocking off a star.  But it was delicious!

Wonderful recipe, I didn't change a thing! My husband loves black beans, but I was skeptical....then I tasted it and yum! This will become one of my new favorite recipes. You don't miss the meat at all. We used Veggie Shreds (fake cheese) for all the cheese except the ricotta, I couldn't find a substitute for that, and it still tasted amazing. This is really worth making!

This was pretty good.  I ate 2 pieces easily.  A good idea is to add 1/2 teaspoon each chili powder and coarse pepper to the cheese mix, and 2 dashes hot sauce to the tomato mixture.

I've never had black bean lasagna and I thought this was pretty good.  I added oregano, cumin, chili powder and garlic powder to the dish and tripled the amount of minced garlic.  Instead of ricotta cheese, I substituted in cottage cheese to lower the fat content.  For the sake of my meat loving husband, I used pasta sauce that had some ground beef in it.

I added some ground turkey to this receipe but otherwise followed it as written - it was wonderful.  I think some tofu chunks would be good added in also.  I good new twist on veggie or close to veggie lasagne.

I also found that this recipe did not have a lot of flavour.  I used a 28oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and if I made it again, I would use that as well as a can of tomato sauce, it was a little dry.  I added some spices and a jalapeno pepper to the black bean/tomato mixture for more flavour.  Next time I would also mash both cans of black beans.

Great recipe!  Inspired a few changes here as well- I used one can black beans (didn't mash), one can corn... added chicken (YUMMY!), changed the tomato sauce to diced tomatoes and salsa, added mexican cheeses as well- turned out super yummy- my 3 year old loved it too. Next time I'll add in cilantro - definitely a keeper.

This was okay, but a bit bland, and that's even despite the fact that I added hot sauce and some cheese.  It required a bit of effort -- and I'd put my effort elsewhere next time.

this is fabulous! i added some extra spices to the bean mixture because it was a little bland initially, but it turned out great. better than the meat version. :)

Loved it!  I'm a vegetarian and really enjoyed it.  My husband is a meat and potatoes kind of man and he really liked it as well.  I did add chili powder and pepper to the cheese mixture and tabasco sauce to the bean mixture as one of the reviews suggested...yum!

Excellent recipe - served it to four die-hard meat-eaters and two vegetarians, and all of them loved it. I added more tomato sauce than recommended, but it was still a little drier than I would have liked. All the same it is definitely something I will make again!

This is such a good lasagna!  What a change, not your typical sit down meal.  I had this lasagna a couple years back at a party and never got the recipe and found it here!  I was so happy.  Everybody has got to give this a try.  It has nothing to do with being a vegetarian, I am not, it is just something new and different!!

A great recipe! I made a few changes and it was a hit! I used 4 garlic cloves, a 29 ounce can of tomato sauce and 16 ounces of mozzerella cheese.

This recipe was excellent!  I made some modifications, but the basic concept was still the same.  I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, 1 can of black beans instead of two (no mashing), and 2 C. frozen corn.  Next time, I think I'll use salsa instead of tomatoes.  Add some chopped fresh cilantro on top and it's the best!

Very good for adults and quite filling. It takes a little longer to make when the kids are running wild. They really didn't take to it, so I gave it three stars.

It's times like these I'm glad my husband is strictly a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy so I get all the leftovers!  I followed the recipe to a "T", except I used oven-ready lasagna noodles, which worked just fine.  I used Kuner's brand black beans with cumin for added flavor.  Next time I make this I will skip the tomato sauce and use a jar of marinara instead so it has more of an Italian taste, but that's just my own preference. 
 Also, I had never used the oven-ready noodles before, but next time I use them I might consider wrapping the dish in foil to bake, so the edges of the noodles soften up more.

LOVE IT! This is a hit at my house I've made it at least a dozen times! I do add Italian seasoning to the sauce and layer in spinach and sliced mushrooms. This is by far the best lasagna I've ever had!

A family favorite! Great for a pot-luck, IF your family doesn't inhale it first. My picky eaters can't get enough. We make this every week or so. IF you're lucky enough to have leftovers, they keep well for a few days.
