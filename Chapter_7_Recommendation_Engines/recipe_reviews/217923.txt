I used Truvia sweetener in this recipe--I made no other changes or subsitutions. This was one of the easiest jams I've ever made nevermind tastiest. I loved the addition of lemon zest. I'm so tickled that I was able to make "sugar-free" jam at home because processed sugar-free jam very expensive and the quality is not as good. Very happy with this recipe.

When I normally want to make jam I just cook down some strawberries and sugar pretty much, until they get thick. I was at the store the other day and seen something called instant pectin in the canning isle. I bought it just to try it. I did a search on here, for instant pectin, and found this recipe. I cut the recipe in half and used all strawberries, because I didn't want to have to worry about raspberry seeds. I don't care to much for lemon rind, so I just used a small squeeze of lemon juice. Although, I wish I would have used some zest, just cut back, as I think it may have made it more liquidy. When I at first tasted it with the sugar added it didn't really taste like jam. Then I stirred in the pectin and it had the flavor of jam instantly, strangely. Although, I did have chunks of strawberries that still needed to be mashed. It may have been better to let it sit with the sugar for some time to release some of the strawberries natural juices. Half the recipe did easily fit though in a 1 cup container with a twist on lid to store for later.

Really good jam!  Strawberries are so flavorful right now so the jam was delicious.  I used granulated sugar, I don't care for splenda.  I also like that the recipe doesn't make a ton.

Simple and tasty. You can adjust the quantity of strawberries to raspberries depending on what you want to notice more. Yes, pretty sweet. Cut back on sugar, added more fruit. Plan to continue to use this super simple recipe for our raspberry harvest each fall.

This is a very good recipe, I sub'd in real sugar for the artificial because I cant eat any artificial sweetners, and it turned out great!
