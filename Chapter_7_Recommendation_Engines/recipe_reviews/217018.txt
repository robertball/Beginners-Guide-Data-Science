OH MY! This is awesome.  Im not a great cook, but Im very picky with taste!  I try lots of recipes off here and most are ok-good.  This is YUMMY.  Its perfectly hot, great texture- I am on a diet and had to have a second plate.  Only suggestion is if you like a little crispy cheese cook a little longer.  Great JOB BON BON!

SO good!  I actually made this with fresh chilis instead of canned and there was no problem.  It was great!

This casserole was amazing!!!  I already bought the ingredients to make it again.  I did cut the cheese in 1/2 though, and it was very cheesy and delicious!

Absolutely delicious!!  My Mom and I made this for my Dad.  He loves Chili Rellenos.  We did a few things differently.  We used 12 fresh Anaheim chilis that we sliced, roasted and skinned.  I also seasoned the milk mixture with a  little onion powder, garlic powder and a pinch of salt and pepper.   
Dad said it was the best he's had!  It was delicious.

7/7 of my family members that tried this loved it. I did make a few changes to the recipe, so I can't say that I would have given it 5 stars as written. Instead of canned, I used 8 average-sized poblano peppers that were roasted, peeled, stems and seeds removed, and cut into wide strips. I also used about 1.5 lbs of  pepper jack instead of the 2 lbs of cheddar, which I'm sure lent itself to a more authentic Mexican flavor, and probably made it seem less overwhelmingly cheesy. I also added an extra 2 TBSP of flour and about 1 tsp of baking powder to the batter to make it a little more fluffy and less custardy. If I had used canned sauce, which I didn't because I always make my own, I think 1 can would have been plenty! This was as close as you'll get to chili rellenos without actually making chili rellenos. I'll definitely be making it again!

Very yummy and easy! I added shredded rotisserie chicken to make it more of a complete meal. Serve with salsa, sour cream and guacamole for toppings. The measurements weren't right...needed more green chiles.

I cut this recipe in 1/2, baked in an 8 inch square glass pan but otherwise made it exactly like published. Delicious! Cut in 9 squares and, using restraint, my husband & I ate 6 of them!

I made this exactly as the receipe read and took it for a pot luck at the end of a meeting.  Everyone love it and and many went back for seconds and thirds.  It was delicious.  There was one serving left which I ate the next day and it was even better.  Next time I will make this a day ahead so the flavors can mingle together more and then reheat the next day

I found that it needed to cook longer before I added the sauce.  Also I added one additional can of whole green chilies.  The 2- 10 ounce can of sauce is WAY too much.  Part of one can is more than enough.  Next time I'll bake until cooked then add sauce and cheese and broil at the end.  Quite tasty.

Wow, this was so very good, I increased mine a bit to accommodate a 10X15 pan since I needed 15 servings. Used three 10 oz. cans of chilies, about a 1 1/2 pounds of Colby-jack cheese(2 pounds is a lot of cheese). Both cans of the canned milk and added enough regular milk to make 2 cups, and increased the flour by one more tablespoon. I did add in some paprika, black pepper, garlic and onion powder shakes for added flavor. Still baked for 30 minutes to a perfectly golden brown fluffy casserole. I know I changed a bit, but wanted to let those that need a larger amount know how easy it is to increase the ingredients a bit and still come out with a great. Every body raved about this one at our party.

Really good & easy recipe. I halved the cheeses and the enchilada sauce and it was perfect. I also used fat free evaporated milk which worked just fine! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was afraid my arteries might harden with the original recipe. It could definitely be lightened up but still yummy!

Very easy and delicious! I made it with fresh chilis,  a little less cheese, and I used 1 1/2 cans of the enchilada sauce.  I think next time I will only use one can of sauce so it wont be quite so runny. Super easy!

Bon Bon, I'm going to try this, because it sounds great! Sounds like all of the flavors of the classic Mexican dish (chili rellenos - basically, stuffed peppers), but without the work. THAT'S the part I'm kinda worried about - but I'm still gonna give it 5 stars. Why? Well, because I'm planning on adding 1 sauteed bell pepper (in some olive oil), some sauteed sweet onions, and pressed garlic, to 1 (28 ounce) can of whole, peeled, plum tomatoes (undrained), and then I'm going to use THAT mixture as my salsa! Thanks a LOT for the idea!!

In relation to the amount of chiles and enchilada sauce, 2 pounds of cheese is unnecessary and nutritionally undesirable given our personal preferences. I elected to cut the cheese in half while other reviewers compensated by upping the chiles used in the dish . . . either way works. Another issue surfacing in the reviews is too much enchilada sauce. I stayed with the recipe but added 2, 10" flour tortillas over top of casserole at step 3, and then added the second layer of cheese and enchilada sauce. This absorbed the ‘liquid’ some had concerns about and gave the casserole a little more substance. Also added personal seasonings since no seasonings were in the ingredients list. Removing from the oven and allowing the casserole to rest for about 10 minutes, the enchilada sauce was a bit runny but firmed up significantly after waiting another 15 minutes. With these modifications, it was close to 5* but the next day leftovers were even better with the ingredients further binding together along with more in-depth flavor. A big bonus is the ease of making this casserole with minimal prep time involved so that other things can be done while the dish bakes in the oven. A definite make again. Thanks, BonBon.

This was EASY and DELICIOUS!  I used roasted peppers from the market which I deseeded.  My boyfriend said he would prefer a chili relleno with more of a carb base (rather than an egg base).  I will probably layer it with some home made tortillas next time.

Very, very good, and easy!  There was no spicyness, just the flavor of the green chiles which I liked.  Could easily use other types of peppers if you want some heat.  After reading reviews I didn't add all 20 ounces of the enchilada sauce.  I agree that it would have been too runny.  I also added another tablespoon of flour since the liquid mix seemed really thin, but it probably would have been fine without it.

This recipes was delicious! I had a hard time finding the right ingredients because I live in Canada and wasn't sure which were the right green chiles but now that I found a place to get them I will definitely be making it again! My boyfriend loved it too and it was so easy. Thanks Bon Bon

Hands down best chili relleno casserole!! I always use this website for dinner ideas and usually tweak recipes, like I usually see in the reviews. This is the first recipe that I have seen that had great reviews on the original posted. Because of that, for the first time, I didn't change anything... And wow! Thank you for sharing this crowd pleasing, awesome recipe!

My husband and I really enjoy this recipe. I omit the enchilada sauce; but once it's done, I pour a little green taco sauce over mine. I chop up olives and green onions and put a layer of that over the cheese. I always make more than this recipe does so I make a bigger batch of the milk/egg/flour mixture. I put all my layers down before putting it into the oven, so it winds up being: chili's, cheese, mixture of olives and green onions, chili's, cheese, mixture of olives and green onions, then the milk/flour/eggs mixture. I set the timer for 40 minutes and then once the timer goes off, I check for doneness and cook longer if needed (since I make a larger batch.) Someday I may try adding roasted, red bell peppers to the olive, green onion mixture. I like to serve this with Refried Beans. Ole'

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe! We used fresh roasted green chilis in it and other than that followed the recipe exactly. It needed no additional seasoning what-so-ever. Unlike myself, my family does not like spicy food, but they ate the entire casserole! I will definitely be making this again!!!

Very Delicious! I used fresh pablano chiles, blistered them on the griddle and peeled them.  Also, I substituted pepper jack cheese for the monterey jack cheese. I read the reviews and added the garlic and onion salt to my milk & egg mixture. As others before me, I baked the casserole a little longer after adding the sauce.  It was very good and there were no leftovers!

Really easy.  I used 2 roasted poblanos (skin off) instead of canned green chilis, 2 chorizo sausages (oil drained), 3 eggs for 4 servings, and finely sliced green onions.  Next time I will spray the pan with non-stick spray.

I used roasted fresh hatch or pasilla chilis and it was amazing. I also like to use what ever cheese I have on hand. Last time I made these I used a mexican blend. sometimes I add grilled chicken, too.  Love this recipes.

Super easy and delicious. My grandmother made a similar version of this and I think I might actually like this recipe better! My husband said I can make this every week. Thank you!

I LOVE Chile Rellenos but can rarely have them because of the wheat most restaurants use (NOT authentic).  I was so excited to try this and it was awesome!!  I also ended up using more peppers (there was just room in the pan.)  I had a hard time finding the right peppers and salsa and I live in Arizona!  But when I figured it out it was GREAT!  Even my picky boyfriend loved it!  It holds up well as leftovers too, though it's tough to leave any!  My thanks and compliments to the chef!

A definite winner and very easy to make.  it fits the bill perfectly when I want something  with a little Mexican Flair!  I add chicken and black beans  drained to this and makes it a real hearty meal.  I also serve it with guacamole sour cream and some hot sauce.

I did a trial run at the house before making this for the local senior center. I needed to make sure it wasn't too spicy for them. I came out wonderful. I added some chopped green onions, diced tomatoes, some sour cream & minced cliantro as we plated to give it some color "bling". Served this with some Mexican rice & homemade refried beans. It was a hit! Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy & very good.  I used 8oz cheese within, 8oz on top, 4 4oz cans chopped chiles & 1 10oz can sauce just to cut a few calories.  Turned out great.  Thanks for a wonderful tasting recipe that takes minutes to put together.

My husband loved it. I roasted fresh peppers, which took longer to prepare & used 1 less of a can of green enchilada sauce cause there was already a lot of liquid. But overall great taste.

I'm generally in-line with highly rated recipes, but this one just didn't do it for me. It wasn't great out of the oven, and was really a spongy mess as leftovers. Clearly a fan favorite, but just not for me.

Made exactly as written, except I couldn't find 7 ounce cans of chiles. I ended up using six 4 oz. cans of whole chiles to make the two layers of chiles.

The taste was amazing, but the top was soupy and made the texture of the jack cheese weird. I will definitely decrease the enchilada sauce next time.

I have made this recipe many times.   Have had folks say they didn't like chili rellenos but they sure did like this.  Never had any left to take home.  Tastes just like the chili rellenos you spenda lot of time making.

This turned out great. The vegetarians (and non vegetarians) really loved it. The next time I make it I will add one more can of chiles and a can of diced chiles to the top of the casserole. I believe I might add some bell peppers as well. It was a big hit. Could be served for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner.

I have made this several times and every time it turns out perfect. My husband isn't the crazy about spicy Mexican food like I am, but he loves this and ask for it at least once a week.  It also good the next day for brunch or breakfast. I did add garlic powder and crushed red peppers.

The recipe lists green enchilada sauce in the ingredients but mentions green chili salsa in the instructions. Might be why some turn out soupy. 

I used six eggs instead of four, one can of evaporated milk, and reduced the cheese by half. Did not add flour to the eggs but added cornstarch to the enchilada sauce to thicken it up. Also added garlic powder, onion powder, and a dash of cumin.

Made this the other night.  Did not use the enchilada sauce because my hubby has problems with spicy.  Found the 9x13 pan too large for the amount of ingredients but we both liked the combination.  Will definitely make it again.

We cooked this recipe and loved it! We love Chili Rellenos and this was just delicious! We used 1 27 ou can of whole green chilies and 1 15 ou can of green chilie enchilada sauce at the end. Also 3 7 ou packages of shredded Mexican cheese. 4 eggs and cooked it for 375 for 30 minutes. Then poured the enchilada sauce over it and sprinkled the remaining 3.5 ou of cheese. Cooked it for another 18 minutes. We used a pan a little bigger than 8 x 8 but not 13 x 9. We will cook this again.

This was a quick and easy casserole to put together.  I only changed the sauce from Enchilada sauce to making my own.

1 medium onion chopped
1 clove of garlic chopped
1 can of chicken broth
1 can S&W stewed tomatoes (Mexican recipe label)
dash of cumin

Combine all ingredients and simmer. Then pour over the casserole (that has been baking for 25 min) and bake an additional 10 min.

Se hacen muy Sabroso!

I loved it and so did my husband. Leftovers were great with smoked pulled pork. Next time we are going to make extra so we can use the leftovers in burritos.

This would have five stars except that I seriously cut back the cheese from the recipe. I used a little more than 1/3 the cheese that was called for. It was FANTASTIC! But seriously, 2 lbs of cheese? If I had made it with that much cheese, I think I would have given it a 2.

These were excellent!  I  fried. The poblano a in  about 3. Inches of oil to blister them.  The skins came off so quickly! I beat the egg whites into peaks and folded in the rest of the stuff as someone else recommended.  For the sauce I used about a tablespoon of oil from the peppers and fried tomato sauce like I learned to make the real chili  rellenos.  So good and a lot less time!.

So easy, yet so good!  I didn't have any green enchilada sauce on hand, so used one can of Ro-Tel instead -- just the right amount of "heat".

This is a really good recipe.  I've made it several times, and everyone loves it.  I follow the recipe as written except I use more chiles and a little less sauce. Next time I make this, I am going to use jalapeno jack cheese for extra heat.

Fast and simple.  It's an "eggier" version than another I've used.  Could be used as a breakfast dish.

This recipe is awesome! It is delicious, easy to prepare, and easy to adjust the number of servings. I've gotten many compliments. The second time I made it I cheated and got blended cheddar and Monterey jack cheese already grated, I just put half in the layer and the remaining half on top. It was still wonderful. I baked it in my chafing dish pan and set it right in my chafing dish for our Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners. Love it!

I made no changes.
It was too hot for me & I thought there was too much enchilada sauce & not enough egg. Very runny...
My guests liked it better for breakfast the next morning.

Amazing flavor! I used fresh roasted hatch chili instead of canned green chilies. Also, 5 ounces of green enchilada sauce is plenty! So easy to make too.

Really good Casserole.. Used 3 eggs instead of 4, a cup of Queso Fresco, a cup of food processed tomatos, 4 jalapenos and 2 orange sweet peppers. Garnished with sour cream, green onions, cilantro and black olives.

I’ve made this many times. The first time I made it exactly as written., because I don’t believe you should rate a recipe that you have changed. Then I started tweaking  it to our tastes or to what I had on hand. It’s excellent as written! You don't have to change a thing.

the amount of cheese should be reduced to one quarter of amount used. there is no flour necessary. we are not trying to encase a whole poblano in the egg/ evaporated milk coating. making authentic Chili rellenos is much easier than this contrivance.

This was so delicious. I made it for some friends and my husband - they loved it! I served it with the Mexican Rice II recipe.

Tips:

I found that I needed an additional can of whole green chiles.

I incorporated some of the tips in the reviews. I poached a chicken breast, shredded the chicken, and added it on top of the first layer of cheese. I sprinkled salt and pepper, cumin, and garlic powder over the chicken.

For the egg mixture, I added 3T of flour and 1t of baking soda to make if fluffy based on the suggestion of another reviewer.

I also found I only needed 1lb of cheese. I mixed pepperjack and a mexican cheese blend.

this is delicious! I have way too many Anaheim peppers in the garden so i used them, roasting them in the oven. Since it is just the two of us in my house, I halved the recipe and put it in a pie plate. I did bake it about 10 more minutes than it needed because I was concerned about how liquidy it looked on top, but upon cooling it firmed up.  I also used about half the cheese that it called for, plus I used low-fat. This is a keeper!

I loved this... easy and simple ingredients.  I did make it gluten free by substituting the flour with GF Bisquick (because it was what I had on hand.)  I also used buttermilk instead of the canned milk.  Taking my cue from others comments, only used 1/2 can of the green chile sauce.  It turned out great.  I may be more adventurous  in the future by adding other ingred's.  :)

This casserole was pretty good, though next time I would make a few changes.  I would double the egg batter to make it fluffier and perhaps even add some tortillas or something.  It is basically green chilies and cheese, which is good, but I was wanting something more substantial.  Overall, a good meal & easy to heat left overs.

I have never reviewed any recipe before. I whipped this up for a quick brunch and served it with a salad.  My husband wanted me to make it again for tomorrow night. That's a first! I will be making this again and again. Thanks for a great recipe.

As I usually do I prepared it exactly per the directions and recipe.
I guess if you can't get to a decent Mexican restaurant this will be an OK fix for your Relleno need. Chili Rellenos are typically the "signature" offering for quality Mexican Restaurants. This is really bland and sloppy.
I won't try it again.

I made this recipe except using fresh green chiles from Hatch,NM. It was excellent and my husband loved it. He is very particular about his chile rellenos.

I added chuncks of cream cheese to the recipe. My family LOVED it. I will decently be cooking this again. It's a really easy recipe for a busy mom.

I used 3 fresh pasilla chiles. I scorched them (not burned) on the grill, put them in a bowl covered with saran wrap for 20 minutes , then peeled the skin off and took out the seeds. I chopped them and mixed them with the jack cheese and egg mixture. I found that on 400 you only need to cook the casserole for 20 minutes or 350 for 30 minutes. Added 1 small can of tomato sauce on top and sprinkled a handful of cheddar cheese and cooked it for 10 additional minutes at 375. I also cooked it in a slightly smaller pan. My husband who doesn't even care for chili relleno loved it!

I made this last night for my picky boyfriend and he liked it. That's a big win for me. I bought what was labeled simply as "green chiles" and showed peppers on the can, but had a bunch of sliced carrots mixed with tiny jalapeños. I picked the carrots out and lined the jalapeños on the bottom of the pan as best I could. This only made one layer, so I can't comment on the exact recipe. What I was able to do ended up delicious though.

Made this using 1 lb. of sausage and 8 eggs.  I used canned chillies but added some Chipotle peppers in Adobe  sauce.  I also added some cheese to the egg mixture as well as over the top.  it was incredible and definitely something I can eat on the Adkins diet.  Great for dinner with a salad and leftovers for breakfast.

This is one of our family's favorite meals. I don't use the enchilada sauce, however, as the original recipe I use said to put salsa on after you take it out of the oven. I also sprinkle the cheese on top prior to baking and then add a bit of fresh on top of the salsa. Looks and tastes fantastic!!!!!

This is such a good recipe!  I made it as written with only one change.  Several reviews stated it was runny so I took the advice of one reviewer and added 2 flour tortillas cut in strips before adding the second layer.  It turned out great although I'm not convinced it would have been runny without the tortillas.  I also used fresh roasted chile peppers.  We'll be having this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

I have tried making this dish twice doing everything the recipe says.  Both times the dish has been very soupy. We had to bake an additional hour to get it to solidfy.  So would like to know what the trick is to make it turn out without having to bake for almost 2 hours.

We have had it before and loved it. It's a great alternative to frying, which we try to avoid. We grow our own chiles and love using fresh from the garden veggies.
