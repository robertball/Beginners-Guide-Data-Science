Great chewy, fudgy brownie IF you eliminate one egg, and add more cocoa (1/4 cup).  No baking powder, or else it will rise too much like a cake.  Not really deep dish, but just  regular size thickness. And make it easy on yourself folks, this can be a one-bowl recipe. I just add all the dry ingredients into the wet mixture and slowly stir until it's all incorporated.  Definitely increase cocoa and add 3 tablespoons sugar to compensate.  I also used just 1/2 stick of butter and 1/4 cup applesauce and it was super moist and hopefully a smidge healthier.  This is a really easy recipe and quick and fun to do with kids.  Why use stuff from a box with all those preservatives when this is soooo easy. Bake no longer than 35 min in 8x8 square pan.  Tip for all brownie recipes: grease only the bottom of your pan, not the sides to avoid burning or turning too crisp or dark on the sides of the brownies.  With a few changes, this one is my master recipe.

I was pleased with these deep, dark, chocolatey, moist, fudgy brownies. Just for something fun and different I added quartered Oreos to the batter. When the brownies were nearly done I topped them with more crumbled Oreos and miniature marshmallows and popped them under the broiler for a minute or two until the marshmallows were melted and a light golden brown. To gild the lily even further I finished them with a drizzle of melted chocolate chips. It takes a good, reliable recipe to mess with it that much!

I love how none of the rave reviewers actually followed the recipe. Really people, if you have to change a recipe that much, it hardly warrants a stellar rating. As is, these are not brownies, they're cake.

LOVE these brownies with my modifications: I only used 2 eggs and omitted the baking powder and I sprinkled chocolate chips on the top. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13. These were everything a brownie should be - chewy, fudgy, wonderful! I will make these again and again! Thanks !  ***Update*** Just wanted to let you all know that I made these with baking Splenda and they did beautifully and tasted delicious! *Another Update* - It's been a longtime since I found this recipe, I make it all the time. The only thing I have changed is that we don't use choc chips anymore. This is still a major hit!

Like other reviewers, I left out the baking powder and used 2 eggs instead of 3. I also used just a tad more unsweetened cocoa than called for...these revisions should give you the "dense, fudgy" result as opposed to the "cakey, light" variety.  Otherwise, great recipe!!

With the advice of other reviewers.... and how many could go wrong?.... I took and doubled the recipe, used half the eggs called for, increased the cocoa, omited the baking powder and salt, added a hanful of chocolate chips (that did not sink to the bottom) and chopped walnuts, poured it in a metal 9x13 pan, and baked it for 35 minutes after toothpick test rated it done. The results were Deep Dish Brownies to Die for! They were even better the next day! All my family enjoyed them, and this recipe is just as fast preparing as a box mix but the finished product is MUCH better then ANY box mix! Try it, you'll be glad you did!

These brownies tasted great! They even get the nice little flaky layer on top! I waited until they completely cooled before cutting. I also only used 2 eggs and omitted the baking powder, but you shouldn't listen to other reviewers when they say it only needs to baked for half an hour. The recipe says to bake 40 to 45 minutes, I did 40, and even after they cooled, the middle brownies were still battery in the center, and you could taste the rawness. My friend liked it because she likes gooey things but I myself prefer the taste of doneness. So if you know that you have an oven that usually bakes things a bit faster than others, decrease the baking time, by all means. But if you usually have to bake things for a longer time than the recipe calls for (like me) then stick to the suggested baking time and maybe even extend it a little. Not all ovens are the same, so basically just know what type of oven you have.

I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup pecans and they were wonderful!  This is absolutely the best brownie I have ever eaten in my life (actually those were my husband's EXACT words).  Someone below compared them to another recipe on this site, The Best Brownies, but I think they are 100 times better than those!

We had searched and tried to find the perfect brownie on allrecipes.com and the search has officially ended. These are fudgey and dense brownies and have a unique and marvelous flavor! We added lots of chocolate shavings (about a cup).
These brownies rock and if you are searching for THE PERFECT BROWNIE......your search is over!!!!!

HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: So many reviews complained about the brownies sticking that I did what I do with my other recipes & that's line with nonstick foil & then lightly spray PAM on bottom (the regular foil is fine too but I do think you have to lightly spray sides of foil!!).  That way when it cools COMPLETELY, you just pull up, and slide the entire brownie out & cut!  No more issues w/trying to pull brownie out w/o it falling apart!  This recipe is the only one I've tried on this site that fits my definition of the perfect brownie "rich, dense, fudgey, and holds together!"  Here's how to achieve that: Double the recipe b/c you're kidding yourself if you think the original amounts will last more than a day! Use a 9X13 baking pan (not glass), omit the baking powder, so it won't turn cakey, BUT DO include the salt.  It's greasy w/the amount of butter stated (like I've had toss outs), but when I use 1 1/4C (when doubled) ...it comes out perfect with a 35 min bake time (fast oven). Use 4 eggs (again, if you're doubling) and 1.5C of unsweetened cocoa.  When tops looked done and toothpick came out clear..it was done!  I had to bake mine about 10 min. longer in my older oven, but just insert a toothpick and if batter is on it, stick it back in for another 5 minutes! UPDATE: This time I tried it in a cupcake pan like another reviewer (350 for 13 min), and they were so cute! Just be sure to include the PAM!

I took these to a potluck, and everyone loved them, even people who normally don't like brownies.  The half cup of chocolate chips makes it extra fudgey.  Put them in!  I substituted 1/4 cup butter with applesauce, and the brownies were still really buttery.  To make a more fudgey, uncakelike brownie, I had to make these adjustments: add an extra tbsp of cocoa powder, leave out baking powder, and put in only two eggs.  Also, don't cut the brownies too small, or else they will fall apart.

I was in a hurry to make "something" chocolatey one night and saw this recipe.  I made it exactly as recipe stated, except I doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan.  While they were in the oven I read the reviews. I decided to post this review because no one has seemed to do so that actually made them exactly as stated.  

My husband and 2 teenage sons absolutely LOVED them. My husband's exact comment was "If this is all you ever made for dessert, I'd be happy" and "These are amazing for something you just on a whim decided to make for a quick "chocolate" fix".

These are not a chewy, thin brownie. All the reviews seemed to want to modify the recipe to make them as such. Double recipe in glass 13 x 9 glass pan yeilded about 1 1/4" thick brownie. Very moist. 

These brownies would be perfect in a brownie sundae.

Next time I make them, I will probably try to add a handful of chocolate chips.

I rated these 4 stars because I would have rated them a 3 because they weren't heavy chocolate like a chocolate addict would want (me). However, since the 3 men in the house LOVED them so much, I threw in an extra star.

I would recommend to anyone to make them per the recipe once before any modifications.

Im guilty of rating this recipe AFTER making these modifications: 2 eggs, no baking powder, 1 1/4C. sugar and 1 C. cocoa powder. It makes a rich, chewy, brownie. I also add 3/4 C. chopped, toasted walnuts. For an extra special occasional treat frost with a chocolate ganache. Yum

I just made this exact recipe from the Hershey's web site! I cooked them for 40 minutes and they came out perfect. I also substituted 1/2 stick of light margarine for the butter. I used 1 cup sugar w/half cup of Splenda. Very good!

This is a really good brownie recipe.  I've been searching for something that I can make from scratch without chocolate syrup or candy bars but still comes out fudgy and this is it.  I took the other reviewers' suggestions of using one less egg and no baking powder and they were beautifully fudgy!  This is now my alternative to boxed mix!

I made this recipe yesterday and took some to work today. Everyone who tasted them said they were fantastique!  I used the scaling available at the bottom of every recipe to double the batch and made a 9X13 pan.  Man, am I glad I did.
I opted to use only 4 of the 6 eggs and just about 1/2 of the baking powder (you can leave it out altogether I'm sure) which made a nice fudgy brownie. I added some chopped pecans and chopped chocolate chips to the batter, roughly 1/2 cup of each.  I think that any chip would be wonderful.  Even people who said they preferred cake type brownies said these were good because they were not too dense. P.S. Watch the timing I think mine were only in about 35 minutes.

These were by far the best brownies I have tried so far. I used two eggs and sprinkled about 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips on top and they came out great. The chips stayed in the top 1/2 of the brownies and didn't burn on the bottom of the pan. Perfect!!!

Oh yeah baby!  With some minor adjustments gleaned from several other reviewers, these turned out perfect!  I mean perfect!!  Adjustments:  Skipped the baking soda, added 1 cup of cocoa instead of only 3/4 a cup, used only 2 eggs, added 3 tablespoons of light corn syrup AND added a chopped semi-sweet chocolate cube to the batter just before cooking and baked for 45 minutes.  These will not last long.

Although I prefer a more cake-like Brownie, these were really delicious and I got rave reviews from my husband who is my worst critic and my best friend who is an outrageous baker.  You really have to grease up the pan good, however, I used Pam and it still stuck to the bottom.  I added a few chocolate chips which gave them an extra yummy taste.

I took MommyFromSeattle's suggestions and increased the baking cocoa by an additional 1/4 cup, added 3 extra tablespoons of sugar, eliminated one egg and the baking powder, and cut the butter back to a half cup. Just under 35 minutes in a 350 degree oven in an 8x8 pan. Not exactly the same recipe but I appreciated her tips. I frosted this with the Brownie "CRAAAAAAACK" Frosting, which is also from this site. I thank MommyFromSeattle for her review.

Great texture, great taste. There is no reason to omit the baking powder. I made a batch with and without and the baking powder gave them a slightly lighter texture. It made enough of a difference to make it worth putting it in.

Wanted to bring brownies to work - these were a big hit and gone before I left.  As suggested, only used two eggs and left out the baking powder for a more fudgey brownie.  So good I made them a few days later for my dad's birthday.  For the first batch I sprinkled with a lot of chocolate chips before baking and that turned out really well.  In the second batch, I melted chocolate chips on the stove top and spread them only icing.  That was even better.

I originally rated these a 5 ( with only 30 minutes cooking time) because the first time I made them, they were AMAZING.  Absolutely perfect brownies.  BUT....I have not been able to replicate the recipe since.  I cannot figure out what I am doing differently, so I figure its just a fickle recipe.  My last two attempts at making these resulted in dried out cake....they were gross.  But, like I said, they were perfect the first time, so maybe its my oven?  But in order to keep the 5 star rating, I need to be able to have the same results every time I make a dish.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were great!  My husband isn't big on sweets and he ate as many as I did.  They stayed moist in the foil-covered pan for days, which made it easier to not eat 4 at a time.  They are a cross between fudgy and cake brownies, nice and dense but not so rich they make my teeth hurt.  I still want fudgy brownies now and then but this is my new go-to brownie recipe.  As I continue making this recipe I'll start fiddling with things, like subbing part whole wheat pastry flour and subbing applesauce for a bit of the butter.

I am so often disappointed when I make brownies from scratch. I usually end up liking the box kind better. But not with this recipe! This is delicious! I also preferred it over the 'Best Brownies' recipe from this site. More chocolatey! I recently made this recipe into mini cupcakes and added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. It yielded about 30. I baked them at 350 degrees for 12-13 minutes. Looks just like the brownie bites you can get from the supermarket!

Not that this recipe needs any more reviews, but after trying it, I won't be using box recipes any more!  It was easy and delicious.  I followed other reviewers' tips and used extra cocoa (3/4 cup cocoa total), two eggs, and a very scant 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.  Plus half a bag of chocolate chips.  Wonderfully decadent--they were gone in no time.

These are by FAR the best brownies I have ever made or eaten. The 8 X 8 dish I used was glass instead of metal and they turned out perfectly. I added 1 cup of semi-sweat chochloate chips before putting into the oven and the 45 min bake time was just right. These also stayed moist and fresh for the few days that they lasted. Will be making these frequently!! Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  This is how a brownie is supposed to be, and it's incredible how this can be accomplished with so few ingredients.  I didn't make many changes, but here goes:  2 eggs instead of 3, no baking powder, 2/3 cup cocoa, added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1 tsp instant espresso powder.  I baked these for a half hour and they were done.  The top was beautiful - no frosting required.  These are so fudgey.  And thicker than your average brownie but not too thick.  I will be cutting them small (if I share any) because they are so decadent.  So far, this is the top brownie recipe I've found on this site.  You should definitely give these a try!

These are SO good. You're not kidding when you say *deep dish*. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13, and went with 2 less eggs, and I thought they might cook over! They looked a little stiff as dough, so I added 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup. These were wonderful, and quickly gone!

TO DIE FOR!  I used 2 eggs, 1/4 tsp baking powder (like most other reviewers suggested), and also only baked them for 25-30 minutes.  I used an espresso, semisweet chocolate, light corn syrup etc. frosting for the top, and they were heavenly.  (I will try to remember to add the frosting recipe to All Recipes...I will call it Espresso Chocolate brownie frosting).  They were very dark, fudgy, and chewy.  My husband kept saying, "incredible" as he gobbled them all up!

Loved these, they were easy to make, and they tasted great.  My only complaint is that the times were misleading, it only took 25 min in my oven so i would suggest that you start there and check it every 5 mins after 25.

Awesome!  Made a couple of modifications; only had two eggs so used those and added a little cinnamon applesauce.  Added a small package of chocolate chips, some chopped walnuts, and a little chopped coconut. Only had a larger 8 1/2 by 11 pan so used that and baked for about 30 minutes.  Delicious!  Fudgey and moist, rich and flavorful!

This is essentially the same recipe as "Best Brownies" and one I've been baking for years (same proportions - just different amounts of ingredients)  I make it with 4 eggs, 1 c. butter/flour, 2 c. sugar, 2/3 c. cocoa in a 9x13 pan.  Bake only 20-25 min.  Variations include stirring in  1-2 cups choc. chunks or M&Ms or white choc or pb chips.  Also try spreading raspberry jam over 3/4 batter, then put remaining batter over jam.

Nice brownies, but nothing special. I followed the recipe exactly and did not find these different from any other brownies I have made before. I was hoping for a cake-ier brownie, but I had a hard time getting the center to completely set without burning the edges, which is my problem with most brownies. Even cooked them about an hour, but still no dice. I don't like fudge-y brownies, and this recipe did make less fudge-ier than most, but still...nothing special. I give three stars because they ARE good brownies, but I may not make this again since I have slightly better recipes.

1 WORD=CHOCOLICIOUS! Very good, I eliminated 1 egg but kept everything else exactly...wonderful and quick. They cooked for about 30 minutes. I added a few walnuts and chocolate chips to the mix for extra chocolately-ness. Hope you enjoy!

This recipe is excellent. The only change that we made was to add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter and we sprinkled additional chips on top of the batter before baking.

I've tried this recipe a couple of times and really love it. I've been searching for a good brownie recipe for years and I've finally found it! I will try adding some choc. chips next time and maybe some pecans too. ****Made brownies again last night and decreased butter to 1/2 cup and decreased baking powder to 1/4 tsp and added a bit extra cocoa as suggested by others. I baked them for 30 min. but might bake for a bit less next time. I did add 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chunks too, they are soooo good!!

I made this recipe twice this week: first time the only variation was to cut the eggs back to 2, instead of 3... also used a glass baking dish. The result was gooey brownies that literally fell in the middle. I decided there were too many positive reviews for this recipe not to be any better than that, so I tried it again with 3 eggs and a METAL baking pan. I also cut the baking time to 25-29 minutes. The result: PERFECT brownies! We prefer our brownies with a cake-like texture and so the original recipe worked very well for that. As others have said, if you prefer the chewy texture, cut the eggs back to 2. All in all, a very good recipe!
Edited to add that I have baked these brownies with only 1/2 cup butter, instead of 3/4 & I actually like them better. Not near as greasy & didn't affect the texture at all. I also use the DARK cocoa & use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. I think I have finally found THE PERFECT brownie recipe... thank you Biz McMahon!

These were very good brownies.  I always add 3 Tablespoons of light corn syrup to make my brownies gooier and I am glad I did this time because I think they would have been too cake-like for my taste.  I also sprinkled some toffee bits on top before I baked them...yummy!

I agree with other reviews, the recipe should have less sugar.  The pan size and the cooking time was perfect if you want a chewy fudgy brownie.  I will try this recipe again with some different changes and hope for the best

This is almost identical to the brownie recipe I always use (which, in my opinion, is really outstanding). You should add 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips, though. The chocolate chips are what takes it to the next level.

I decided to venture out and make homemade brownies for the first time & these turned out Amazing! I used 1 cup of white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar, left out the baking powder, used 2 eggs instead of 3 & cut the salt in half. I added 1/4 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of walnuts, then baked for 35 minutes. They were sooooo good! I was a little hesitant about making these because the recipe looked too easy to actually be delicious, but boy was I wrong! Try it! :D

I followed the original recipe exactly and I think the taste and texture came out just about perfect.  Mine did fall during baking, but the brownie I got out of the pan was very cake like, and yet still somewhat chewy in the middle.  A perfect compromise for those who like the "cake" brownie, and the spouse who likes the "chewy" brownie.

I like this recipe.  I make it as directed.  My brownies come out good every time.  They are chewy on the edges and very moist.  I am still looking for a more cake-like, higher-rise brownie but this is my favorite so far.  It is also very easy.

I am crazy for these brownies!!!  Soooo much better than the "best brownies" on this website.  However - I did cut to 2 eggs and omit the baking powder... chewy, fudgy, delicious!  I will reduce the better next time because they were slightly greasy.  Edit:  I made this again and reduced butter to 1/2c.  Much better!  Less oily/greasy feeling and tasting.  I also added some chocolate syrup to the batter and it gave it a nice fudgy taste!

Delish!.. I also only used 2 eggs and did not use the baking powder.  But for a twist I used one cup of marshmallows and 1/2 a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Used a 9 x 13 pan at 350 for 30mins.  Came out fantastic, will keep this recipe for years to come!

Yummy and chocolaty!  These are good brownies.  Better than the recipe I've been using for years!  I was concerned about how runny the batter was before I added the flour.  I thought it was more of a cake batter than a brownie one, but it worked out great.  Because I left out and changed ingredients, I'm only giving this 4 1/2 stars instead of 5.  I "tweeked" it a little bit.  I've never used baking powder in a brownie recipe before so I left it out and reduced the salt by half.  I also replaced 1/2 cup of the butter w/ applesauce to reduce fat content.  I used and 9x9" pan.  I baked it for 13 minutes at 350 then reduced temp. to 300 for 20 min.  When it was cooling I placed chocolate chips on it to melt for a little glaze.  I will definately make these again. UPDATE:  Made the same changes as before but used only 2 eggs.  It was more brownie like in texture and lost it's deep dish affect.  I like it both ways.  Changed my rating to 5 stars.  It's a great brownie.

I must have done something really really wrong because I thought these brownies were . They were way to dry and bland and now I get what "cake-like" means. I am by no means a baker but brownies are my favourite treat to eat whether they are made for me, bought or from a box (mmm Ms. Crocker) and these were by far the worst I've ever had. I fear it is just to simplistic. Good thing I know a friend has a recipe to die for!

I doubled the recipe, used a 13x9 metal pan, only 3 eggs, used a few tbs more cocoa and folded in crushed high quality chocolate bars before baking. They came out INCREDIBLE. Absolutely perfect, moist, fudgy and chocolatey. I highly recomend this to anyone, and such a simple recipe! Thank you Biz!!

I tried the Mmm-Mmm Better brownies from this site and liked this recipe SO much better.  This one definitely came out more fudgy, and much more brownie-like.  As per other's suggestions I only used 2 eggs and omitted the baking powder.  I'm still searching for a seriously rich, chewy, yet solid brownie so I'll keep trying, but this recipe is definitely worth making at least once.

All I have to say is yummy!  These didn't even last 1 day.  These are our new favorate brownies along with Mmm Mmm better better brownies (also from this site).  I did make a few changes, I only used 2 eggs and I didn't add baking powder.  Next time I will add chocolate chips.  Thanks Biz for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I have to say these were really great!  We had them with friends the other night and everyone raved about them.

Similiar to the other reviews I also did 2 eggs (instead of 3) and I omitted the baking powder.

In addition, I added 1/2 c. semi-sweet choc chips.  Great touch!  Another time I also did 1/2 c. peanut butter chips -- yummy!!!

Lastly, once I let them cool, I cut them into about 2 inch squares.  I pile them on a plate and dust with confectionary sugar.  Very pretty, and yummy too!

Enjoy!!!

Followed the recipe, and I didn't like these at all.  They were way too cake-like in texture, and they didn't have enough chocolatey flavor.  I think next time I will follow the suggestions to use only 2 eggs, omit baking powder, and add chocolate chips.  The original recipe was not a keeper, though.

This is THE keeper brownies recipe for me. Changes I did: margarine instead of butter, 2 eggs instead of 3, 1 cup of sugar instead of 1.5 cups, used a combo of 1/4cup whole wheat flour + 1/2 cup all purpose flour. With my changes, I thought the brownies were perfectly chocolaty and not too sweet, and even with the baking powder, mine didn't rise that much anyway. Baked for 35mins and were perfectly done. I think next time I'll try using all whole wheat flour to make it even healthier.

This recipe tasted fine but it is definitely not chewy brownies. When made following the recipe 100%, they are spongy and cake-y. 

Don't be fooled by the high rating, most of the 5 star reviews have drastically modified the recipe to give it that rating.

Not a fan of making homemade brownies since they are usually a little tedious to make. This went quick with a FANTASTIC result. I did use a dark pan and reduced the temp to 325 for 26 mins. Great recipe.

After reading other reviews I decided to make this with 2 eggs, little bit more coco powder and I did 1/2 the baking powder that it called for, instead of omiting it entrily. I also used 1/4c apple sauce with 1/2c butter instead of 3/4c butter. AFTER those changes, I do say these are great from-scratch brownies! I rate 3 stars for the fact that I DID alter the recipie due to reviews, but I'm glad I found this recipe. I will most likely make again, adding chocolate chips and/or nuts.

Very good!!!!!!! I read a few reviews and decided I would only use 2 eggs and no baking powder. I accidentally took it out of the oven a little too early and it was really fudgey. But it tasted better that way.......... ( I think so, I haven't tried it cooked all the way. )

This recipe is fantastic, my husband and son devoured these (they were only out of the oven for a few minutes). Way better than boxed brownies. They didn't take much more time to mix together and make than boxed brownies either! Will make again! :o)

Yeah, this is totally cake.  Followed the recipe almost exactly.  I like chocolate chips, so I threw a few in there.  Baked 40 minutes and got a nicely done product with very nice flavor, but I wouldn't classify these as brownies.  Brownies should be chewy and super chocolaty.  This recipe yields a very nice chocolate cake flavor that kids would be major fans of.  Its sweet and buttery, and goes fantastically with a glass of milk... but yeah, its cake.

These were tasty and I adjusted them to fit my exacting gooey tastes.  I substituted one egg with 1T ground flax seed and 3T water.  Then, once all mixed up and in the pan I swirled on chocolate sauce and sweetened coconut flakes. Finally, once out of the oven I sprinkled the top with chocolate chips and marshmallows.  Warm and gooey these were delicious and no box mix was necessary!

Hands-down best brownie recipe. I have used this for years, and for a special treat, use Dutch-processed cocoa and the very best of each ingredient, like Plugra instead of butter. Outstanding!

I woke up Sunday morning forgetting I had volunteered to bring brownies to the kids church - jumped online and found this recipe! I modified the recipe as suggested to using 2 eggs, no baking powder, used 3/4th cup of cocoa powder, and added 3 add'l tablespoons of sugar. These are awesome brownies! Better than the box...highly recommended!

As it is written I didnt like them, and I am a choco-freak.  I did what others did, omitted an egg, added 1/4 cup more cocoa, less sugar, and I used 1 /3 c of oil, no butter, no baking powder..  Then, they were straight out of Willy Wonka heaven! So, three stars as it is written, and 5 stars doing what most cooks on here suggested.

Awesome, wonderful, and delicious! I did take a couple people's advice and only added 2 eggs since and they turned out perfect consistency. I used 1/4 tsp. baking powder so it would rise slightly and but not be too cakey. I also added about 1/4 cup chocolate chips, and used 3/4 c. cocoa because I tasted the batter and wanted it a little more chocolaty. I finally have that perfect recipe with the couple changes I made. I'm sure they would be amazing without my changes too. I almost always tweak a recipe for my tastes, and this recipe was completely forgiving and let me change it with no problems! I think I'm going to go have another one now :)

outstanding!  these will satisfy any chocolate lover, or PMS crazed woman.  A very easy brownie to make, too.  Watch your oven temp/time.  ovens vary so if it takes less or more time than stated, watch carefully.  I have also turned these into turtle brownies by adding chopped pecans and drizzling with caramel ice cream topping on top. this is the best brownie recipe I've found to date.  I'm sure it'll go in my permanent recipe box on the counter.

After trying this recipe, I threw out my other 2 brownie recipes.  Whoever it was that called these "life-changing" was not exaggerating.  I only used 2 eggs and left out the baking powder, per the prior reviews.  I will make these again and again.

THE BEST BROWNIES! This is definitely a keeper! Look no further. I did change a few things as some other reviewers suggested:
I used 2 eggs, 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa, added 1 cup semisweet baking chips, and omitted the baking powder completely. The brownies came out dense, very chocolatey rich mmmm, and stayed moist for days! Great reviews from co-workers too.

I, too, used only 2 eggs and omitted the baking podwer as suggested before.  Great texture. Good fudgey taste. My only criticism is that it is a bit too sweet.

The best brownie recipe EVER! I have tried the others but these are the best. If you don't like these brownies there's something wrong with you.  Martha Stewart be damned!

The only brownie recipe I ever use. It's the best. I only add 2 eggs, cut sugar down to 1 1/4 cups, omit baking powder and add 3/4 chocolate chips. They are super chewy and super chocolatey. I have to make these for my family at least once a week.

did two eggs, no baking powder and about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. my mom who does not like brownies or anything chocolatey said they were to die for. She kept raving about them. My dad said they were possibly the best brownies he's ever had! That is a major compliment from him. Thanks for the great recipe!

Let me start by saying that I used other reviews and altered the recipe.  I only used 2 eggs and 3/4c. chocolate.  They definitely tasted like boxed brownies, so I won't ever buy another box.  My husband and my son LOVED them, however I thought they should have been called death by chocolate brownies the way I altered the recipe!  I will most definitely make these again, but next time I will surely use the original recipie.  Great brownies and super simple to make.  This was my first attempt at home made brownies and it won't be the last.

i love the fact that this recipe only calls for so much ingredients, and it makes a good product.  however, just a note, this "brownie" is very much like a moist cake (i was hoping for something more chewy).

What a great recipe!! Try this with Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting, or vanilla frosting is the best as well!! I made these for my daughter and her friend for their sleepover and they ate the whole thing and my daughter wanted me to make some more the next day!! I love finding recipes like this that are winners!! I only rate it when it's five stars!! This is one of them!! Go ahead and try it! You won't be wrong!!

I have made two batches of these brownies, the second time i only had two eggs on hand, and they turned out much more moist, less cakelike, which was more to my liking. Either way, these are the best brownies I've ever made.

I tend to like a fudgier brownie, so I might add an extra egg next time, but the flavor of these is perfect!  Highly recommended!  Also tried this:  warm 1/2 cup peanut butter in the microwave, add a couple of tsps of confectioners sugar and beat until smooth; drop by spoonfuls on top of brownie batter...then swirl with knife and bake as usual.  So good!

Pretty good, added extra cocoa and also found cooking time a little long...  Even at 40mins I found the edges slightly dried out.  If you don't like really sweet things, try frosting them with vanilla not chocolate frosting.

Oh My Goodness These Brownies Are Great!!!  I cut the eggs back to two and omitted the baking powder.  I also added chunks of chocolate.  They were chewy and delicious.  I can't wait to make them again.

We are a group of students from Sault Ste. Marie, ON, Canada, writing this review for a Grade 10 Foods and Nutrition course.

This recipe was very easy to follow. The batter was fairly liquidy, but easy to transfer to the pan. The texture is really smooth and cake-like. A suggestion for improvement in this recipe would be to add chocolate chips if you wanted more chocolate or sweetness. The only downside is the length of time these brownies take to bake. Well worth the time though!

This is the BEST brownie recipe!!  Perfectly chocolatey and fudgey.  I made it for a bake sale once and now I make at least a double batch for every event.  For regular brownies, I always add about a cup of chocolate chips to the batter.  These taste great topped with peanut butter fosting too.  I've also added some carmel topping right before baking to make carmel brownies.  As I said, this is the best brownie recipe I've found!!

My all time favorite brownie recipe.  I used to have a similar one from Hershey's but lost it a while back.  Be very careful not to overbake- best indicator of doneness is when brownies SLIGHTLY start to pull away from side of pan.  Adding choc. chips is the only way to go!  Thanks Biz!

I made these brownies and took them to work.  My coworkers gobbled them down and wanted me to bring more in. I have not changed anything about this recipe anytime I've made it and the brownies are still dense and not cakey.

Love this recipe!!  This has been my go to brownie for years now!!  If you;re looking for an gooey brownie, this is not it, but nice fudgey/cake consistency.  I often double this and bake in a 9x13 pan for 40 min, or for party-perfect size I use a mini muffin tin and bake for about 18 min each, a double recipe made approx 5 dozen.

The flavor of these was right on - deep, dark, rich chocolate.  But, the appearance after baking left much to be desired.  As the brownies baked, a hard crust formed on the top that proceeded to crack and fall as the brownies cooled.  So the top did not look nice, nor did the browies cut nicely.  After a quick taste, I decided that these were worth keeping and making some sort of frosting to cover up the top.  It worked very well and the brownies disappeared.  Worth giving another try to see if it happens again.

These Brownies are fabulous!  I made then just as submitted.  Used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder.  Very easy, very delicious!  I iced them with cream cheese frosting because I had some left over from a cake I baked.  But would be great plain too.  Just a great basic brownie recipe that you could do so much with.  Thanks Biz for sharing it.

Excellent! Mine seemed to take quite a while to bake, but still came out wonderful tasting. I like the cakey brownies so I left the recipe the as is. But for the family they like em chewy, I followed other reviews, and did 2 eggs, added 1/4 of baking powder, and added a tad more cocoa. Yummy, great either way! Thank you for the recipe my new favorite!

These are very tasty.  I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder (which I'm having trouble finding more of now) and although they turned black from the dark chocolate, they were the most delicious brownies I've ever eaten.

These were good but the sugar gave kind of a grainy texture.  I left out one egg, increased the cocoa and used almond extract insted of vanilla.  I love the flavor the almond gave.  I'd make them again in a pinch but they probably wouldn't be my first choice.

I increased the cocoa and the sugar as some reviewers had suggested but the sugar should not have been increased because these were WAY too sweet. When I bit into a brownie, I could literally feel the sugar crystals in my mouth, that's how heavy the sugar was.  I wouldn't risk making these again.

Must be one of the few that has not rewrote this recipe (I will not rate a recipe unless I make it as submitted). We happen to like cake line Brownies and, also, these are very good for bake sale purposes because they hold their shape and cut easily. Thanks for submitting

I can only give 3 stars because I don't really care for the original recipe. They aren't brownies by ANY means - it turns out to be cake. Like some other reviewers, I made some revisions and they turned out AMAZING. I only used 1/2 c. butter, added 1/4 c. applesauce, upped the cocoa to 3/4 c, omitted the baking powder completely, and added about 3/4 c. chocolate chips. With these, they're absolutely amazing, and the perfect fix for any chocoholic!

I took other reviewers advice and only used 2 eggs, substituted 1/4 C apple sauce for butter, reduced baking powder to 1/4 tsp, used a heaping 1/2 C unsweetened cocoa powder, added 1/4 C coarsely chopped dark chocolate pieces, and 1/4 C chopped walnuts.  I kept it everything else the same.  I cannot believe how good these turned out.  I will never buy another boxed brownie mix.  I have tried various recipes, but they always came out "cakey".  I cannot express how good this recipe is.  Thank you so much for the recipe, and the ideas from other reviewers.

This brownie recipe is easy and delicious.  Note: they are better the second day; their flavor develops, and they become softer.

These were great! I followed Mommy from Seattle's advice and they were sooo chewy, rich and fudgey. I used 2 large eggs, no baking powder, added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of walnuts just crumbled up by hand. I frosted them with chocolate frosting from this site. They are so rich with this added, but droooooooolllllll..mmmmm.....lol

These are just as easy as a mix and taste five times better.  They are the perfect mix of cake-like, fudge-like, and have the perfect amount of chocolate.  I was looking for this as a little smaller of a recipe (I was afraid I would eat the whole pan alone in just a couple of days- a fear that turned to reality!) and I wasn't disappointed!  I make these every time I want brownies now, and if I'm really ambitious, I eat them out of the oven with vanilla ice cream.

I LOVE this recipe!  I have been in search of an amazing, incredibly fudgey brownie and this is it!  As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan.  The first time I made these, I omitted the baking powder and I reduced the eggs from 6 to 5, as suggested.  I also always use salted butter for baking, so I omitted the salt as well.  The brownies came out very well, but they were still a bit on the cakey side for me.  So I tried it again the following week, only this time I used only 4 eggs.  I omitted the salt and baking powder again as well.  I also added probably a cup full of chocolate chips, a must.  I baked them for only 35 minutes and the second batch was PERFECT!!  I will never go back to mix brownies again!

These brownies are absolutely to die for! Because they only baked for 35 minutes, I let them cool for 15-20 minutes to let everything set before cutting.  I plan to make them for Valentine’s Day and for many birthdays in the next few months.  I highly recommend these brownies.  Thank you for this lovely recipe.  p.s.-the aroma of these brownies baking is irresistible!

If I could give this 10 STARS I would!! This is the first recipe on this site (and I've tried hundreds) that I felt that kind of rating for.   I followed this recipe as stated.. Let cool completely then covered half with raspberry jam and sprinkled with chopped pecans and left the other half plain. Loved them both ways! If you love a fudge-type brownie, this is it! My family could NOT stop eating these! **Update..since my family enjoyed these last time and we were craving chocolate I made again.  This time I took the warm brownie and spooned in dessert glass topped with sweetened condensed milk and sliced fresh strawberries!! Sooo Good!

I didn't think these were very good.  I followed others suggestions and only used 2 eggs and no baking powder.  They weren't very chocolatey.  They were very dry and tasteless. I will try and find another brownie recipe.

This recipe is the best!! I followed a lot of the other reviews and made a double batch using a 9x13 pan(36 servings). I only used 4 eggs instead of the 6 and omited the baking powder so they would be less cake like and more fudge like. I sprinkled chocolate chips on top before I stuck in the oven and I baked them for 45 minutes. They were so chewy and rich!! It was almost like dark fudge with that extra little crunch with the chocolate chips. 

My family actually prefered them cold too the next day out of the fridge and my coworkers begged me for the recipe!!

Based off of the suggestion of others, I omitted the baking powder and used one less egg... Made them this evening for my husband who loves brownies.  I can never make his mom's recipe right and I think I outdid even her.  THIS WAS WONDERFUL!!! My husband had nearly half the pan that is how good they were.  They were fudgy and chocolaty.... Everything a brownie should be.  Five stars for sure!!!!

These were my first attempt at from scratch brownies. Almost everything I make is from scratch so I thought I'd give it a try. I was a little worried while they were baking it looked a little more like cake than brownies. I let them cool and couldn't believe how good they were. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. As long as you take them out when the toothpick test says they're almost done, they'll be nice and fudgey. We finished off half the pan last night alone. I recommend trying these exactly as they are before you see what else you can do with them. But definitely a great base for many variations.

These were delicious!  I cut down the eggs- I doubled the recipe and used 4 instead of 6.  I also froze one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips the night before, added 3/4 a cup to the mixture, and sprinkled the remaining 1/4 on top after about 15 minutes baking in the oven.  Once again, delicious!

These were very good. I omitted the baking powder also and left out an egg. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar. These are quite chewy and have a good fudgy flavor. 
I iced these brownies with the Peanut butter fudge frosting also found on this site and I thought they were excellent together! :)

Flavor was OK; I like mine with more deep chocolate flavor but I was looking for a recipe with cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate (I was out) and this fit the bill. The cooking time is too long! I set the timer for 40 minutes and fortunately looked at 35 because they were already a little overdone. They're OK in a pinch. For those looking for a REALLY fudgy brownie (granted with a little more effort, but if you're going to do it, do it right!) go to Baking with Julia. I have made those and became a legend for it.

This recipe is fantastic! I made a few changes to accomodate the ingredients I had though. I used 1/2 cup of margarine, 1 and 1/2 cups of brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1/4 cup applesauce, 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup cocoa and I didn't use any baking powder. At the end I tossed in a handful of chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. I had to increase the baking time to 55 minutes at 350 degrees. These were moist yet still melt in your mouth. I've made them twice this week already because they keep disappearing!

If I could give this recipe 100 stars I would!  It is by far the BEST from scratch brownie recipe I have ever tried.  I did read the reviews before making it & made the following changes as suggested by other reviewers: 1. reduced the eggs to 2 vs. 3; 2. ommited the baking powder; 3. Added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also used 1/4 cup special dark unsweetened cocoa powder & 1/4 regular unsweetened cocoa powder.  They were to die for & they didn't have that eggy taste to them at all.  Loved them!!!

I am through with mixes thanks to this recipe!  I followed this recipe using others suggestions and I only used 2 eggs and omited the baking powder.  These were so fudgy and chewy.  I made these last night and thought they were a bit too buttery.  I tried one this morning after they cooled off nd the flavor went through and they are to die for! As good as the ones you buy at the expensive bakerys.  I am going to make up several batches to freeze so that I will always have some on hand for get-togethers or simply if I just want to indulge.  Thanks for a great recipe

Very good, especially the next day. Definitely cook the entire time the recipe states! I took mine out early based on some reviews, and I had to throw the middle away because it was not done enough to keep. I also think you should only use mini chocolate chips if you choose to throw those in there. My large chips didn't melt and did nothing more than stick to the bottom of the pan. Very nice taste to these brownies. I'd like to know what kind of frosting is on the brownies in the picture though. Yum! Ally

As far as my family is concerned this is a slice of heaven.  I followed advise of others and used 2 eggs, no baking powder and added chocolate chips.  I also bake them for about 8 minutes less as we like ours a bit less done.

These brownies tasted really good, however they weren't much different from the stuff out of the box.  I really enjoy cooking so I much prefer doing them from scratch, but if you don't like to cook you would be just as good off with the box.  With that said I still loved these brownies.  I only used 2 eggs and I left out the baking powder.  I cooked it in a 9x13x2 pan.  I only cooked it for half the time it said.  Overall I think this is a great recipe.

This is the worst brownies I have tasted in my life. If possible, I will give it zero stars. There was to much butter, it was bitter and hard and crunchy which should be quite the opposite. I followed the recipe to every detail, and it was horrible. I followed others suggestion also to eliminate baking powder and use more cocoa and use only two eggs, and it was inedible. i will stick with boxed brownies from now on. That is my opinion. Totally waste of ingredients and time. I wonder why it it rated five stars. Oh well.

I've made this recipe three times already before finally hitting on a winner.  The first time I made it, following the recipe but omitting one egg, decreasing the amount of baking powder by half and adding chocolate chips.  The result was okay but it was too buttery and the brownies get hard once they cool.     Attempt #2: Cut recipe in half and used 1/2 cup of oil instead of butter.  The result was no better than the first and not as moist but they weren't as hard.    Attempt #3: Went back to butter but only used 1/2 cup instead of 3/4.  Used 3 eggs, but reduced baking powder to 1/8 tsp.  Added Nutella (chocolate hazelnut spread) instead of chocolate chips.  The result was fantastic!!  Everyone loved them.  They were moist and soft and the Nutella gave the brownies a delicious nutty taste without actually having to add nuts!  I'm definitely sticking with this recipe from now on and next time will probably use even less butter.  (I really don't think you need that much.)

I'm sorry that I had to rate this so low, but I actually had to throw these out.  I followed some reviews by omitting an egg and the baking powder and adding baking soda.  I also added the peanut butter swirl. I recommend you follow the recipe as is since mine was a bust by using the added comments.  Good luck with it!

I've always preferred boxed brownie mix to homemade because with homemade, I could never get the fudgy/chewiness I like in a brownie. Like others, I reduced the eggs to two and reduced the baking powder to 1/4 teaspoon. This is
now my standard brownie recipe. I've made these countless times with great success. I don't even bother with
boxed mixes anymore.

My daughter loved these brownies. She liked them better than the box brownies. I thought they were good also but I would like chocolate chips in them. I read the other reviews while they were in the oven so I didn't make any changes the first time I made them. I think they were inbetween cakey and chewy, which is perfect. I only cooked them 35 minutes. They started to get dark around the edges. I will definitely make them again!

This brownies are a mix between a cake and a brownie, and they didn't have enough chocolatey flavor. I think next time I will follow the suggestions to use only 2 eggs, omit baking powder, and add chocolate chips to give it more flavor

I have made these twice now.  Both times excellent.  I did take the suggestions of other reviewers to make a less cake like brownie and only used two eggs and 1/4 tsp baking powder.  And they only needed to cook 30-35 minutes.  I also added 1/2 cup choc chips.  These made a super moist, dense chocolatey brownie.  I will definitely make them again!

I also found these brownies to be cake-like, but they were still good. I probably cooked them a bit too long becasue the edges were quite crispy, when I tested them the center was still really gooey so I kept them in for 2 more minutes and it was too long, they're a bit on the dry side so next time I'll take them out of the oven when the center is still gooey. If you want a chewy brownie try chewy cocoa brownies (on this site)!!

The winning recipe if you like chewy brownies!  After trying a few other recipes, made this one with two eggs instead of three and no baking powder as suggested.  I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  I would definitely recommend checking after 30 minutes to make sure the edges don't get too hard.  Otherwise, YUMMMY!!!

Now THESE are brownies!  Rich and chewy chocolately goodness!  I followed the advice of a few others and used only 2 eggs, and omitted the baking powder (as I did NOT want a cake-like brownie), threw in a handful of extras-butterscotch chips, semi-sweet chocolate chunks and some walnuts and VOILA! Brownie heaven.

These brownies were only so-so.  Definately not enought chocolate flavor and the texture wasn't tops either.  I will not make these again - brownies from a mix are much better than these.

These brownies were absolutely delicious, especially sprinkled with white chocolate chips!  Thick and chocolatey, with a crisp crust and chewy middle.  I gave some to a friend and she couldn't stop raving about them.

I have had better brownies, I thought these tasted eggy out of the oven.  Also I thought that there was not enough chocolate flavor.  I will try one tonight to see if I have a different opinion.  Thanks for the recipe though, I love this website.

These were SO EASY to make.  My husband suggested
splitting the batter and putting chocolate syrup in between the layers (he's a chocoholic).  I will be making these again.

These brownies were terrific!!! Don't be fooled though!! When these brownies come out of the oven, they look kind of cakey and dry, but cut them up, and they are moist, chewy and very chocolatey.... delicious!!!  I also added a real thin layer of chocolate fudge frosting right when they came out of the oven which just made them even better!!!

Hands down the very best brownie recipe!!!! Ok...here is what I did.....FIRST...I doubled the recipe....trust me on this one...you will be glad you did...they are addicting!!!  I used real butter....Land O Lakes is the best...but really any real stick butter will do..(don't use margarine)....then I added 4 eggs instead of 6. Then I added an extra 1/2 cup of cocoa to the mix, which would equal 1 1/2 cups of cocoa....OMIT the baking soda AND salt..... and I added 1 cup of chocolate chips (hey..I'm a girlie girl who loves chocolate). I also baked it for 50 minutes......in a 9 X 13 pan. YUM...YUM....YUMMY!!!!! You will want to grab the milk OR top it with some vanilla ice cream!!!  A real treat....and TRUST ME....hide it in view or you will be nibbling on this EVERY TIME you walk into your kitchen!!!!!

I've made this recipe on multiple occasions (usually for work events when we're supposed to bring in a dish).  It's become my go-to option, mostly because it always turns out so well.

I found that if the brownies are a BIT underbaked when out of the oven, they cool to a nice gooey consistency when they're done.  Also, adding in chips (toffee chips, mint chips, etc) adds an extra good flavor.

4.5 stars.  I followed some of the reviewers and made some adjustments:  1/2 c butter, 1 c sugar, 2 eggs, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, no baking powder.  Well, I dunno if it was b/c I cut out a significant part of the liquid, but there just seemed like too much dry ingredients in the end.  I moistened it with a minimal amount of milk, but then there was not enough batter to fill the 8x8 pan.  So I made these in cupcake tins, and it worked out fine.  I did over-cook a little...they firm up very quickly in the end when you do it in cupcakes, so I'd rec really watching them.  I don't remember if other reviewers had problems with not enough batter, but I will double the recipe next time.   They tasted great.

Used one less egg and took out the baking powder, but still too cakelike. I also tried gentle mixing so that it wouldn't fluff up. The recipe is easy and tastes ok, but I guess I'll keep looking. Try adding some OJ, orange marmalade, and/or orange oil to taste - it made a pretty good orange brownie.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I used a brownie recipe on cocoa powder container and the brownies were dry and crumbled.  I didn't change a thing and they are absolutely delicious!  My husband is already warning me that these are almost gone and he is ready for more.

Wish I'd reminded myself of the other reviewers' comments before I made a double batch of this recipe exactly as written. OKay! It's not BAD. They're yummy dark chocolatey CAKE. Not Brownies, though. My children will love them, all the same, but it wasn't the dense chewy consistency brownie that I imagined.

I followed some of the recommendations and altered the recipe because I did not want cakey brownies. I used 2 eggs, used no baking powder, doubled the cocoa powder, used 8x8 metal pan, 35min - no convection fan. The brownies came out chewy and rich. My rating is based upon my alterations, not really fairr to the original. I will make this again according to the recipe.

This is the same recipe that my mom used to make homemade brownies when I was a kid.  I think it is just as easy as the boxed brownies but without all the preservatives.  I have made these with 2 and 3 eggs and I do prefer using only the 2 eggs for a chewier brownie.

I made the recipe in a 9x13 pan without doubling, and the brownies turned out great.  I like thinner, fudgy brownies so I incorporated changes described by other reviewers.  I used 2 eggs, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 stick of butter, 1/4 unsweetened applesauce, 3/4 cup of flour, and 1/2 cup of dutch process cocoa.  Lining the pan with parchment paper was very important as it prevented the brownies from sticking without adding calories.  I also baked for 20 minutes, which left the brownies just a touch overdone. For a 9x13 pan, I probably should have baked for 15-18 minutes.  The recipe was delicious, I am just not sure if it is better than store mixes.

These are awesome!  I love cake-like brownies and these are the best.  I definitely encourage adding a little more unsweetened cocoa powder... probably more like 2/3 or close to 3/4 cup.

It was very bitter if you follow the recipe. However, adding chocolate chips and more cocoa powder made them wonderful! I love how deep they are. So, this is the rating for the original recipe. I would rate the updated recipe much higher!

If you like deep chocolatey brownies, this brownie recipe does NOT need a lot of vanilla!  I've been making it with the suggestions listed (2 eggs, omit baking powder, increase cocoa) and only 1 tsp vanilla because of the expense... but yesterday I ran out of vanilla and made them without.  They were, if possible, even more delicious than they were before.

I'm a diabetic, and have been looking for a brownie recipe I could use with a sugar substitute. Adding only two eggs instead of three, and cutting out the baking powder completely, I ended up with a great solution to my sweet tooth without using sugar at all!! YAY!! I will definitely continue to use this recipe. It's both quick and delicious!!!!

I like the other reviewer, am rating it for the actual recipe, not based on other suggested ingredients or changes, which would then entirely be another recipe all together :)  Anyway, I love this recipe.  Just finished scarfing down two chunks, plus my three boys scarfed theirs down immediately.  Having unhooked myself from the false Duncan Hines and other boxed brands of ingredient gunk that is not good for our bodies, this was perfect.  The only difference is I used was unsalted butter and sea salt (fine texture) due to researching the unhealthy and cruel benefits of consuming table salt that is used cheaply here in the USA.  This was my first time baking with sea salt and I assumed it would be 'too salty' or something, but it turned out wonderful.  Upon the first bite, I thought, hmmm needs a bit more sugar though it already has a good amount of it in there, but after the third bite then my reaction was 'hey this is really good!',  When I first made this recipe tonight, I beat the butter and eggs till fluffy and the whole texture of the batter threw me off, it was really light weight, not heavy, like boxed brands, so I was not sure at all about the end result.  Plus 25 minutes of baking, I thought it was burning, but it was not, nor was it finished in the middle, so I turned the temp down due to it being baked in a dark nonstick 9 1/2 x 9 1/2 inch pan, so the last temperature change was at 310 on the electric oven for the duration of the timed baking in this recipe.

I omitted the baking powder and used only 2 eggs, as the previous reviewer suggested--with these modifications, the brownies turned out wonderfully.

Without these modifications, the brownie was more like cake. That's why I am giving it 2-stars. The original recipe isn't very good without omitting ingredients.

Yes, these are excellent. With the omission of 1 egg and half the baking powder, they were soft and fudgy. I had read a couple review about them not being chocolatey enough and also the butter being too overwhelming. As far as the chocolateyness-i melted about1/3 cup of chocolate chips with the butter, plus added chocolate chips to batter. They were VERY chocolatey-probably too much so for me. Next time i wont add choc. chips. Also, about the butter-they are very greasy. My lips were coated with grease after eating, but hey, who eats brownies when they are worried about eating something healthy? I substituted part melted vegetable shortening for some of the butter so butter flavor wouldnt be too much, also because i live in a tropical climate and baking with butter doesnt work out well here--always turns out a wierd texture. Shortenign works better. Give these a try, you'll like them.

I did not like these brownies at all!  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were EXTREMELY dry and bitter!  I've never had anything turn out this bad and I cook very frequently.  Since it's chocolate, and I have such a sweet tooth, normally I'll just eat it!  Not this time!

This is my first attempt to make brownies from scratch and I thought this recipe was easy and delicious!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9"x13" pan.  As per other reviewers for making these brownies more "fudg-y", I used less eggs and added a little extra cocoa.

I also used the recommendations of 2 eggs, omitting baking powder, and adding choc chips.  These are VERY GOOD and rich.  However, if for some reason they last more then 2 days or so, they tend to dry up and become crumbly.  So best eaten right away, which I'm sure won't be a problem!!!

Doubled recipe and cooked in a 9 x 13 glass dish for 38 minutes at 350.  Used 5 eggs instead of 6, otherwise made exactly as written.  They were fudgy and delicious.

I don't like cakey brownies. I wanted a recipe for brownies that taste soft and dense and fudgey. This is the ONE if you like brownies like I just described! I left out 1 egg, and didn't put any baking powder in. Turned out just right!!! YUM! Will never use boxed again!

these are devine! i have had so much trouble trying to find the perfect brownie recipe and these are a keeper for sure! i used 2 eggs as recommended by other reviewers and a 1/4 tsp baking powder, instead of 1/2. also, they were done at 25 minutes, not 40-45... i just checked them when that heavenly chocolatey-vanilla scent started to fill up the house and voila! all done! amazing and delicious and SO incredibly easy. i topped them off with the Chocolate Ganache recipe on this site for additional oomph.

These are AWESOME!  I will never buy a boxed brownie mix again!!  One thing to note, I was making these so often that I tried using oil instead of butter to make them a little cheaper...HORRIBLE!  Real brownies need real butter!!  But that was my bad, this recipe is absolutely wonderful, try it!  I make them exactly as stated, except doubled the recipe and left out the vanilla because I hate vanilla extract, but they were amazing!  I've used regular cocoa powder and dutch process, both were good, so it's up to personal preference.  These brownies stay nice and moist for at least 4 days (I've never had any left after that:) I think these could also be used as a base, adding nuts/dried fruit or making the crust of dessert pizza or cheesecake.  Very very good recipe!

OMG!!!!  Ok, I've never made "home made" brownies before, but now I'll only make these!  I did, however, leave out the baking powder and decrease the eggs, and I added chocolate chips and walnuts.  So awesome!!!!!  No more boxed brownie mixes for me!  Thanks  :)

These were really good.  I used dutch process cocoa because of the baking powder in the recipe. They were nice and chocolaty without the bitter aftertaste of natural cocoa.  I only used 2 eggs, cuz that's all I had, and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. They were perfect.  I baked for only 37 mins so they stayed fudgy but with the rise of the cake type brownie.  They were chewy, fudgy and had that shiny top that brownies should have. Perfect, I loved them!

This is a great recipe! The first time I tried it I took the advice of some reviewers and exclude the baking powder & use only 2 eggs. They turned out out great but today, I follow the original recipe and they turned out better. So follow the original recipe. I love these brownies!

These are the from scratch brownies that I have been looking for! They're fudgy and chewy, and the taste is phenomenal. I made them yesterday, and between my Dad, my youngest brother and myself, there are only 6 left! I did up the cocoa powder to 3/4 a cup because I like super chocolaty brownies, but that's the only thing that I changed. I plan on making a double batch later this week, so I can send some to my husband in Iraq.

Wow! I made this recipe after reading the reviews and did as was told (used 2 eggs instead of 3, omitted the baking powder and used 3/4 cups cocoa insted of only half).  They are the best! Crunchy on the outside with soft and chewy centers. Definitely worth trying! My French husband asks for them ALL the time. Thanks for the recipie!

This recipe rocks!! These are the best brownies I've ever made. I did use only 2 eggs and 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1 cup white sugar instead of all white sugar. The brownies were dense, chewy and yummmyyyyy!!! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

These are BY FAR the BEST brownies you can make from scratch. They are rich, chewy, fudgy, and absolutely delicious.  I add chocolate chips to the batter to make them extra chocolatey. Don't bother searching for other recipes - this is the one to try!

I was trying to think of something quick and easy to make for dessert and I came across this recipe.  It was not only very easy and quick to make, but they were delicious.  My family couldn't believe how good they were.  I have always used a box mix in the past, but I will now never make that mistake again.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.

Excellent with just a couple changes.  I doubled the recipe (to make in a 9x13 pan), used only 4 eggs and 1 1/4 c. butter.  The result was rich, dense with a wonderful chocolate flavor.  They were devoured at work.

Overall not a bad cocoa-powder based brownie.  I made it with slight changes - less 2 tbsp butter and only 1 cup sugar (1/2 white, 1/2 packed brown) and added 1/3 cup mini choc chips. Turned out still delicious but too cake-like for me. There is def potential in this recipe and believe it wld be better with further tweaking.  I wld prob reduce flour by 2 tbsp in future.

These were not what we expected.  Mine came out real thin, made them both ways.  With 2 eggs and no baking powder, then w/3 eggs and baking powder.  Maybe I did something wrong.  Not what my family prefers, still looking...

I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup and sugar to 1 1/4, per other's suggestions.  Also used parchment paper to line pan -- for easier pull-out.  Was more of a cake-like consistency rather than a brownie.  Added chocolate frosting -- definite plus in taste factor.  Was a hit at a picnic I took to -- they went quickly.  Will try two eggs next time to get that brownie texture.

These were just right. I have a problem with all of my brownies (and maybe it's the altitude) having a crust that's too hard and dry and an undercooked center. So when I saw the edges of this batch getting high I took it out of the oven, which was a mistake.  Next time I'll let the center get puffed, too, before I get all worried.  The edges were fine: thick and moist and chewy.  This is a good recipe, and I'm going to try again letting it go the full 45 minutes, maybe even 50. It's still perfectly fudgy.

I'm a beginner so don't laugh at this...

I made two batches.  One normal and one with splenda.  

The normal one came out perfect.  I used  only 2 eggs and no baking powder as suggested.  Also, sprinkled a handful of chocolate chips on top.  The bottom line is that you'll have to experiment with the baking time.  At 40 minutes, they were about 5 minutes too done for my oven.

The splenda batch was a huge crash and burn!!  I used the regular splenda that is cup-for-cup to sugar.  My mistake may have been using marg. instead of real butter.  It came out as thick as a pancake and as hard as a hockey puck.  I guess the dieters at my office are just out of luck today.

Been looking for a moist chocolate cake & interested to note how some said this brownies recipe is moist, cake-like. So, I did as per recipe but since others mentioned the 'need' for a more chocolaty taste I couldn't resist trying 2 suggestions - added more cocoa (up to 1c) and melted 1/2c choc chips with the butter; I doubled the batch so baked in 9"x13" metal pan for 40 minutes. My own add-in was 1/4c milk (for 2 batches) since the batter was a bit thick; and I used brown sugar. End result: a moist choc 'cake' but, a bit too cocoa-y so next time,will reduce cocoa to 2/3c and increase choc chip to 1 1/4c per batch and will bake for 35 minutes (convection oven) since the edges started to crust, not that it's a bad thing ;) .. I served this frosted with whipped cream. Sorry I couldn't resist playing around with this recipe but it is gooood. Might be good as cupcakes 2, since the cake baked with hardly a 'dome' - makes for easy frosting. Thanks Biz. Update: after an 'overnight' stay in fridge, my 'cake' turned out so fine, mellowed cocoa/choc flavour.Love it warmed a bit in the mw oven w whipped cream.Initial taste testers who hesitated over the '2 much cocoa' has since refused 2 share w others.

These are so yummy!  I used splenda baking blend to cut the calories, added chocolate chips too.  Cut them into small 2-bite brownies, everyone enjoyed them.  These freeze nicely!  Can't wait to make again.

I added Reese's peanut butter and milk chocolate chips to the batter this time.  Let me put it this way - I can only make these brownies every once in awhile because they are too tempting!

These brownies are so good. I did make the changes others suggested, and they turned out great. IE 1/2 cup of butter, 2 eggs, 1/4 tsp of baking powder and adding chocolate chips. Also the trick for fuggy brownies is to cook them for only 20 to 25 minutes

As recommended, I took out the baking powder bit n reduced my eggs by 1 qty. I added half a cup of walnuts into my batter, used the "Chocolate Frosting I" recipe for my frosting, and topped it with a toasted walnut (per slice). Simply Awesome!! MOIST and FUDGY.. its fantabulously yummy even at room temp! Yum Yum!

I made these the other day.  I doubled the recipe (used 3 eggs and no baking powder) and baked them for about 30 minutes and they came out perfect!  Nice and fudgy.  I brought them to work with me and they all loved it.  The sides of the corner pieces for me came out a bit hard, but I think it was the pan I used.  It tends to heat up faster than I expect it to.  I was a little bit short on the butter and cocoa powder and it still came out perfect.

Not impressed.  Tastes like it's from a box.  Why spend the time making them yourself when you can go buy a Duncan Hines box?  Pass on this one.  It's missing something.

These are excellent! I cooked them in a regular 7x11 inch baking pan, so they weren't exactly deep dish, but still tasty! I also added chocolate chips once, and that made them even better!

I did not like these brownies.  They were too cake-like and  bland. Maybe adding chococlate chips or something would help.  They also burnt  around the edges easily.

Oh my these are good.  I tried them 2 different ways: with no baking powder, 2 eggs, extra cocoa powder and adding the karo syrup and found that batch to be very rich, but just a little too gooey and fudgy for (hard to believe that's possible!).  The second batch I stuck to the recipe and just added a glob of karo syrup, and only 2 eggs and they were perfect.  My 2 young boys love this recipe.

These are THE BEST BROWNIES!!!! I also used only two eggs, and left out the baking powder. When I melted the butter in the microwave, I added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. They were chewy, rich and FABULOUS!!! I love how they "crackle" on top, it adds a little texture. Favorite recipe.

These were everything I wanted in a brownie! They were fudgy enough with a great flavor. I only used 2 eggs and omitted the baking powder. I then added some chocolate chips to the mixture. I brought this to a BBQ so I doubled the recipe. I will use again and again! Thank you!!

This is a larger version of Best Brownies that I have made before.  They should only be baked 20-25 minutes or else they will be dry.  The timing is written wrong in this recipe.  If baked the appropriate time, they are excellent.

I was only lukewarm about these the first time I made them, but for some reason I made them again...and again and again!  I am hooked on these brownies now!  I follow the recipe exactly and am always pleased with the outcome.  The chocolate flavor is nice but not overly fudgy;  I actually think the brownies have a nice buttery flavor.  Although I think you may have to try this recipe to understand what I mean by that!

This is a very good brownie recipe but I think I am too used to the boxed version.  It is missing a certain chocolate/fudge taste.  However, it is still very good.  I used what I had--so butter was only 1/2 c. (1 stick), and I used 3/4 c. cocoa powder.  We prefer cake-y brownies, so the three eggs and the baking powder were used.  Upon suggestions from other reviewers, I chopped up a good handful of Hershey's Kisses and mixed it in with the batter.  Even with three eggs the texture and taste was very rich and moist and not at all dry.  Grease your pan well and check after 30 min.  Mine were slightly overdone at 38 min.  Overall, a very rich, nicely textured brownie, but only 4 stars because it is missing that certain chocolate something...

These brownies are delicious - and the texture inside is great.  I followed the reviews of others and used just 2 eggs, and omitted the baking powder.  I made a variation on these brownies - I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla extract, and I sprinkled Guittard mint chips on top of the brownies, before baking.  They were wonderfully minty and a huge hit.  The only things I was displeased with were the facts that the top was very crumbly, and the brownies became higher (when cooking) around the edges of the pan.  For this reason, I will continue to look for another brownie recipe.

This was an o.k. brownie recipe. They were not as chocolaty as I was hoping. Brownies should be moist, which they were but they should be full of chocolate flavor. These just were not what I was looking for. Will not be making again. They were easy to make and tasted fine. I will keep looking for a better recipe to make from scratch.

These are so yummy! I was amazed at how much better they taste than boxed mix brownies! Only changes I made was I used self rising flour, ommited the baking powder and salt and I added 1 cup choc chips. AMAZING, chewy and could taste the rich butter flavor. Best ever. THANK YOU!

I thought these were a little too cakey for my liking. If you like them fudgey then I suggest that you add only 2 eggs instead of 3 and I am sure that should help. I wouldn't suggest making these again

I made these brownies one afternoon and shared them with my neighbor -- they were a big hit, even for her sister who swears by boxed brownie mixes!  They stayed moist for almost a week -- unlike other brownie recipes I've tried.  Add the 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter - it's well worth it!

Nothing super special about these. They were cake-like, which was what I was looking for, yet they still retained a bit of fudgey-ness. They didn't turn out as thick as I had hoped though.

Not my favorite but ok.  More cakey than chewy (personal preference).  I'll stick to the boxed version.

These brownies were super-easy to make, and had a good texture--just chewy enough.  As a confirmed super-chocoholic, though, I think I will need to add chocolate chips or fudgy frosting to make them a little richer.  Certainly better than using a mix!

Got on the internet for a good brownie recipe for a dessert for Thanksgiving dinner at mom and dad's house and guess what??  It went over so well and they were gone so fast.  I made them the morning of Thanksgiving.  It was so easy.  I have made them twice after and they were great like the first time

Excellent brownies!  My own mother declared them the best she ever had.  Of course, I did mess with the recipe a little.  Instead of vanilla I used almond, and instead of an 8 inch pan I used a 9 inch, but also used self-rising flour and not all-purpose.  Even altered they are fabulous!

These brownies were really good. Slightly crispy at the corners and edges and chewy in the middle--the true sign of a great brownie.

Okay so although I generally read reviews before making a recipe, I didn't with this one until it was baking. I was so worried it wouldn't be good! The only difference I did was to substitute 1/3 a cup of oil for the butter because I was a bit short on butter. Other than that, followed the recipe to a T, including that 3rd egg that everyone wants to leave out. THESE WERE INCREDIBLE!!! I've literally tried so many homemade brownies, trying to be as good as the boxed version over the years. THIS recipe is BOMB!!!! And it wasn't just me, I got SO many compliments on these brownies! Amazing, thick, dense, delicious brownies. This is like a dense cake brownie, which is what the original recipe intends and it was divine. Most reviews are literally making a different brownie from the original recipe. Anyways, I'd like to HIGHLY recommend trying this recipe AS IS then deciding, though I will continue with doing partial oil since the end result was so, so good.

Very quick and easy recipe! But since I always read the reviews, I also omitted the baking powder & added 1/4 cup more of cocoa plus 1/4 cup more of sugar to balance. Also cut eggs down to 2....BUT I DOUBLED the recipe...so I used 4 eggs & went on to dbl each other ingredient. I used the one-bowl method, so I mixed all dry ingredients together first, then added melted butter and vanilla, then added eggs one at a time...I used a Pyrex 13x9 glass dish & only greased the bottom, baked @ 350* for 35 mins. Very moist brownies & they taste out of this world!! Great for chocoholics ;)

My daughter requests these brownies every chance she gets. Whenever she brings them in for her class to share, I'm asked for the recipe. I've probably made them 20-30 times and as far as I'm concerned the recipe requires no modifications whatsoever. Occasionally we'll sprinkle in some chocolate chips. Perfect!

The three-star rating is a rounded average from our family. The individual ratings were from 2, 2, 3, and 4 with the rating of 4 coming from the baby who tends to eat anything chocolate without much discrimination. I was looking for a brownie recipe. This one sounded good ("deep dish") and had a 4.5 star rating. I decided to try it without looking much at the reviews. Our batch came out notably dry. It tasted too floury and not enough chocolatey. The texture was more like a heavy cake than a fudgy, chewy brownie. I decided to read the reviews. (Yes, I also read instructions AFTER assembling my children's toys.) Well, then I see review after review saying basically, "Oh, these were wonderful. I just changed (followed by three to five recipe adjustments)." Jiminy! People, there are only 8 ingredients! Changing the amounts of three or more, or adding one or two new ones, amounts to some significant recipe changes. We followed the recipe as written. Collectively, our family rated it 2+ stars and then found another recipe to try.

These were just okay. I followed the recipe, and they were a little on the salty side. Like another reviewer said, these are more like chocolate cake; not even a good chocolate cake. Didn't taste like a brownie at all. Don't think I'll make these again.

Finally!  Have tried some 10 odd brownie recipes with no success and was getting frustrated.  Gave this one a shot and it was exactly what I was looking for!  Made as directed (using the full 3 eggs) - only change was to add 1/2 cup chocolate chips and baked in a 9x9" pan instead of 8x8".  Perfectly cooked in 33 minutes with flakey top and nice, moist and chewy underneath.  I *love* this recipe!

It was ok, but more like cake than brownie. Too dry and fluffy. Apparently I should have read the reviews that said to change the recipe, but now I've used up all my ingredients >:( Very upset that this recipe had such a good rating if there were such drastic changes that needed to be made.

These came out soooo good! I've finally found the recipe that will stick. I doubled it and stuck it in a big baking pan and they came out thick, not cakey and not fudgy but inbetween which is the way I like it. I followed the recipe but omitted the baking powder and added choc chips for some extra flavor. DELISH

These came out great! I used 2 eggs and left out the baking soda...I cooked them for the full 45 min. and they were perfect! Next time, I might try adding some walnuts or chocolate chips...

I made these brownies twice yesterday; once exactly as written and next adding 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. Ohhh yeah, this is my new brownie recipie. They are chewy, moist, fudgey, chocolatey delishousnes. The only way to make them better would be a big scoop of ice cream.  So my advice is add the cocolate chips but don't change anything else! If you want fudgey brownies, find a different recipe because this one is perfect!

I loved how simple it is and how flexible the recipe is (many alterations suggested!).  I made with two eggs, 1/4 tsp baking powder and 3/4 cup cocoa.  It was perfect for my daughter's birthday 'cake'.  They had just enough substance to stack nice and high!

Help!!!! I am a Brownie Lover and these Brownies were not even close to a great Brownie. The crappy box version was far better. I made this recipe 3 times using The orignal then the two other suggestions from the reviews including adding the special dark chocolate unsweetned with a less than favorable result. The one bowl Brownies came out better and I so wanted to taste the decadence that was raved about...Just wasn't there.

Like other reviewers, I also eliminate one egg and the baking powder. These brownies are especially good if you add something like chocolate chips, nuts, or a cream cheese marble topping. Yum.

These were wonderful and very moist! I used 2 eggs and added some semi sweet chocolate chips and pecans. I also made a batch with 5th avenue toffee chips and that was so yummy :-P This recipe is good by itself but if i had to pick a fave from all the batches I have made I would say use toffee chips you will be amazed at how sinful and delicious it is!

I've been looking for a good brownie recipe, something rich and soft. After trying several, this is the best I've found. I cover mine so that they don't get crusty on top, and they come out great. I've even used yogurt instead of butter, it doesn't come out as rich, but it I like to think it's a little healthier that way.

Good overall, esp if you like more of heavy cake like quality.  Added walnuts are good.  I found that 40-45 minutes was too much.  My brownies were done all the way through at about 30-35 min.

These had a very cakey texture to them. But the overall flavor wasn't terrible. Maybe next time I will add some cinnamon and leave out an egg and the baking powder.

These brownies are good, but not the best that I have ever had. I made the recipe-get ready for this-without changing anything! I wanted to see how they would turn out without changes. Very good, a bit cakey but overall a good brownie recipe. Maybe if I make again, I will take advice of other reviewers.

i omitted the baking soda and added an extra egg & 1/4 c extra cocoa.  it took about 40 minutes to get the middle done, but the top got really hard.  the next day they were even harder on top!  great flavor, but i'm disappointed with how hard the top was....i'll have to figure out how to fix that!

Exceptionally good chocolate flavour in these brownies. I followed this quick and easy recipe as stated. The texture on top had that wonderful chewyness enjoyed by most brownie lovers. I did find the rest to be cakelike which is good but I would prefer a denser quality. I see some reviewers changed the eggs and baking powder to achieve this texture. I may try doing that when I make them again. Cheers to Biz McMahon for a good recipe.

These brownies taste AMAZING!!!  My only complaint is that they are too hard on the outside and too crumbly on the inside...and not fudgey-crumbly but dry-crumbly.  I'm only used to brownies being that way if it's time to throw them out.  Even fresh out the oven they're a little hard, but once they cool, they're pretty deceiving because you wouldn't expect a seemingly stale brownie to taste so good.  Not really sure what needs to be done to keep them from hardening so much.  I've baked them at various time intervals, and they always turn out the same.  Maybe a more experienced chef could figure this one out???

These were pretty good. They sort of tasted like box brownies. I followed the recipe and maybe they weren't sweet enough for me. I tend to like iced brownies so that could have been it. May try again with adding the extra cocoa powder suggested. I like the Best Brownie  better, which is actually a Hershey recipe (go check out Hershey.com for the exact recipe, she modified the icing).

These were good, but not as thick as I like my brownies. in fact, I would double the recipe if you like thick brownies.  A box recipe is just as good as these were with a lot less hassle.  I'm giving 2 stars because I won't make these again, but they weren't awful.  :)

Would give these 5 stars, but I made some modifications: 2 eggs instead of 3 and omitted the baking powder per other reviewers suggestions.  Didn't have any vanilla on hand, so I didn't use any.  Baked in a 8x8 pan lined with foil and greased. Didn't come out to be 'deep dish', but still delicious! These were gone in one day!  Making a double batch today.

I made these as written instead of decreasing the eggs and omitting the baking powder. I gave it a shot because my father prefers cake like brownies vs. fudgey. I also used an 11X7 baking dish. So the final result was cakier on the outskirts and a little fudgier for the middle pieces. So I guess I got the best of both worlds to satisfy the cakey and fudgy brownie lovers. The taste was very good. Nice and chocolatey. May add mini choco chips next time or some choco icing! Thanks!

I give these brownies five stars with the adjustments made by other reviewers:  omit baking powder and use two eggs instead of three.  Makes very dense, intensely flavored chocolate brownies, just what I was looking for.

Made this last night for 10 people and everyone loved them!  I made the same changes mentioned in the reviews (less egg, no baking powder, more cocoa), and they came out perfect.  Took about 50 minutes to cook a double batch of them in a 9x13 pan.

Awesome!!!  My 6 year and I made these brownies and we will not make brownies from a box again.  We did like others suggested. We doubled the recipe using only 4 eggs, and omitted the baking powder and added chocolate chips.  Put them in a 9x13 glass dish spayed with olive oil. Moist and chewy brownies. Next time we'll try adding peanut butter chips.

It's too bad there aren't more stars! This recipe is THAT good. All my friends are crazy about these brownies and I can't get enough of them. These are like Duncan Hines brownies in texture but they're way tastier. I've tried this recipe with canola oil instead of butter/margarine and it comes out just fine, though slightly less tasty--that is to say that only I noticed the difference and my friends/family didn't.

Beats boxed mix any day!  I followed the 2 egg, no baking powder suggestion and they were so fudgy and delicious!  I think they may be even better with a really good quality vanilla.

Wow! These were so decadent. I followed the recommendations of using only 2 eggs and 1/4 tsp of baking powder. I also added a little over a cup of c chips to the batter. Once out of the oven, I added a few more c chips and it was oh so good! Next time I might try using a touch less sugar. great recipe though.

These are the best!  I made a batch and took them to work, my edges were a tad overdone but the rest was wonderful.  I just cut off the edges and I made 16 brownies out of it.  They were so rich and fudgy I don't think I could have made them bigger.  The first words I heard were "Oh my god," and "This is better than ***."  LOL, they went over perfectly and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks Biz!!!
Also, I did take other reviewers' suggestions by using 2 eggs and 1/4 tsp of baking powder.  All else was exactly the same.

These were really great.  Per other reviewer's suggestions, I only used two eggs and halved the baking powder and added maybe a cup of chocolate chips.  I also used a cream cheese and egg combination to swirl over the top to make them marbled cream cheese brownies.  These were probably the best brownies I ever tasted!

This was the first "homemade" brownie I have ever made....I will never make out of the box again!
I doubled the recipe, left out the baking soda,salt and used only 2 eggs(after reading other reviews)
My family was impressed!

Hands down the best brownie recipe ever! I followed other users suggestions & used only two eggs & omitted the baking powder. They turned out wonderfully! Super rich, moist, & chewy. I sprinkled chocolate chips on mine before baking & made it even more delicious. Definitely try this recipe, you won't regret it =)

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13.  Took a little longer to bake. I did do as others suggested and added more cocoa & less baking powder.  Also used 1/2 Smart Balance & 1/2 butter.  One of the best made from scratch brownies I've ever had.

Wonderful recipe!

I'm so glad I made this...I added 1/2 cp semi-sweet chocolate morsels and 1/2 cp walnuts as other readers suggested, and really is the best brownie recipe I've ever made!

Thanks so much for posting!  :)

The perfect chewy and fudgy brownie. Just right warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. I omitted the baking powder and one egg and sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top. I lined the pan with foil and greased with butter before baking.  After letting the brownies cool, I just lifted them out with the foil and used a big knife to cut into 12 small squares because these are so rich. No mess!

not bad...i also omitted the baking pwdr and only used 2 eggs.  i will stress to not eat them right after they get out of the oven...i like warm, fresh brownies right from the oven, so if you're tempted DON'T do it!  the longer you wait, the better they firm up and taste!!!

This is the 3rd brownie recipe I've tried from this sight. The first, not enough chocolate, the second too much sugar. This one is close to perfect! These brownies melt in your mouth. I did leave out an egg, just so they wouldn't be too "cakey." YUM

Hmmm! Death by chocolate when I added Guittard chocolate chips to mix.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions for a thick, fudgy brownie.  When they were still warm, I wasn't too sure that this was the right recipe for us, but once the brownies were completely cool, wow!

Wow, I'm impressed!  I chose the "deep dish" brownies because I don't have an 8"X 8" pan and had to use an 8"X 11" dish.  I was skeptical about not using baking powder (who's ever heard of such a thing?!), but I did what everyone else suggested and used one stick of butter and no baking powder.  They were awesome!  They have the perfect chewy edges and super soft center.  I think next time I will add some frozen dark sweet cherries. ;)

These definatly were my favorite brownie to make! I just made them this morning. I took the others advice and omitted the baking powder, and one egg. I doubled the recipe [used 4 eggs] and put in 2/3 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, they were perfect! Just the right amount of chocolate! I also frosted them with peanut butter frosting [found from this site] and drizzled melted chocolate over them! They looked amazing and tasted even better! Thank you!

Definitely a GREAT recipe.  
The first batch I used 2 eggs and no baking powder and 3/4 c cocoa.  GREAT perfect consistancy, but maybe too much chocolate.  
The second batch, I omitted 1 egg and the baking powder again and it was perfect.  The recipe is easy, quick and doubles nicely.

I wanted a recipe for a small batch of thick tasty brownies and this is it. I followed the  recipe exactly and loved the outcome.  I put a few brownies in the freezer for later.  I shall continue to use this recipe as I always have these ingredients on hand.  Thanks for sharing.

I made a pan for some b-days at work and ended up eating about half of it myself afterwards (I'm five months pregnant, so I have a good excuse!!!) - yum!  I did cut down the eggs to 2 rather than 3, doubled the recipe for a whole 9x13 pan and increased the cocoa powder.  I also topped with cream cheese frosting (turned in chocolate though) from this site -- these were wonderful and I wish I still had some.  They are soft and not at all cakey, but not super gooey like they've been undercooked or anything.  I can't wait for an excuse to make them again!

I made the suggested version (minus one egg and the baking powder) and they were incredible. My roommate called them "life changing." Yes, they were that good.

These were very fudgy and pretty good...I listened to other reviews and omitted the baking powder, only used two eggs and added a cup of mini chocolate chips, although if I made them again, I think I would try following the recipe as is. I like them almost underdone and I think I left these in too long, but that's my fault! This is a good recipe.

This brownies are delicious!  I'm giving it  four stars because I followed the advice of the others who tweaked the recipe a bit. I didn't stay true to the recipe, so I can't give it a perfect five stars. Anyway, these are definitely the best homemade brownies I've tried.  They made the entire house smell like chocolate.  It was incredible.  I sprinkled some chocolate chips, as well, and it just perfected it.  I also used the Cream Cheese frosting II recipe on here.  It wasn't too sweet and was the perfect compliment.

I really like this recipe. Very easy to make..I was actually looking for a Blondie and could not find one I liked..But I remembered how much I like this one, I converted this recipe into what I like to call a deep dish blondie. I took out the coco and replaced it with flour. Added some nuts and white choc chips and surprise..blondies..They were moist and delicious. Same cook time. Depending on the size of the pan..If you decide to do this your pan needs to larger than 8x8 so the edges won't burn. Overall I like this recipe as a brownie and a Blondie.

My husband begs for these brownies. They are a little cakey for my tastes, but I love the crispy edges they have right when they come out of the oven.

These are FABULOUS.  SO moist and delicious.  We made exactly as the recipe stated, and I'm glad!  It really tasted like we'd added choc. chips, but we didn't!  So, that's obviously not necessary!  Whipped cream on top is a must!  So rich and yummy!

Pretty good brownies!  I took other suggestions and just added 2 eggs and left out the baking soda.  Also added some semi-sweet choc chips.

These are such good brownies!  And they are also very easy to make.  For a lower fat version, I substitute half of the butter with applesauce.  You can't even tell that they're low fat!  I also only use 2 eggs and omit the baking powder.

I have made this recipe twice and both times I did not like it.  The brownies were cake like and dry.  After the first time, I wanted to try them again to make sure I didnt do something wrong.  But got the same result.  My husband still managed to eat them.

Like other reviewers, I omitted the baking powder and one egg.  The brownies were very moist and have stayed moist in my pyrex dish for about 4 days now!  If you are looking for a really, really chocolatey brownie, this recipe is not it, but it is VERY easy and convenient as it calls for ingredients that everyone already has on hand.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great despite my oven being too hot and cooking the brownies in half the time. I don't like a dense  brownie and this was the perfect for me.

Best brownies ever. I added some mint chocolate chips and they were even better. I caught people sneaking more pieces when nobody was looking and had to hide a piece for later. 

Very yummy.

these are a very easy, good brownie.  I followed the recipe they way it was written, except I only used about a half cup of butter(because I did not have enough)  and, they are a bit  too sweet.  I do, however like a fudgy brownie, so next time I will lessen the sugar and onit the baking powder, and use the proper amount of butter.  I think that those few changes will satisfy my tastebuds.

Ok but not great. It may have been because I followed the suggestions of others by doubling the recipe, using 3 eggs instead of 6, 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce, 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1/2 cup of Splenda, and I omitted the baking powder.
Don't get me wrong it was a good brownie, but not the brownie I was looking for. So while for others this may be the perfect brownie recipe, but for me I'll have to keep on lookin.

This recipe was delicious, with a few adjustments. Instead of 3 eggs, I added 2. Also, I added 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/6 cup  dark hot chocolate mix. The flavor was wonderful! I will definitely use this recipe again!

Wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews.  I think two eggs would work best with this recipe.  It was good, but more like cake to us.  Good recipe though, thanks for sharing.

These were amazing! I'm not for the super-sweet brownie so I used dark chocolate cocoa and reduced the sugar by about 1/4 cup. I followed the advice to use only two eggs and also added 2 oz. of chopped semi-sweet chocolate to the top. Delish! I will definitely be making these again.

Yum!  As suggested by other reviewers, I eliminated the baking powder and used only 2 eggs.  I also couldn't resist stirring in a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips (there's no such thing as too much chocolate!)  I'll definitely make these again - they're just as easy as boxed, but taste even better!

I love these brownies IF I cook them for a shorter amount of time. If I leave them in the oven for the whole time they are dry and very cake like. If you take them out early they seem to continue to cook on their own enough to be wonderful. They were also better when I tried taking one egg out of the recipe and adding about 1/4 cup more butter. There is just a fine line between awesume brownies and dry brownies so you really need to watch.

These are excellent!  I used 2 eggs instead of 3 and reduced the baking powder by half.  You also need to be sure to use unsalted butter since there is already salt in the recipe. I also use really good vanilla and the Hershey Dutch Processed cocoa, which is richer.   I have made these every week for 3 weeks now!! I never knew homemade brownies were so easy.

WOW!  I usually use a recipe from a Hershey's booklet but they're flat and only don't do well doubled.  I doubled these, baked in a 9x13 pan for 40 min and also reduced the eggs to 4, added 1/4 c. extra cocoa and excluded baking powder.  These were amazing and are my new "from scratch" brownie recipe for sure!!!

Ah la la. Left out the baking soda, added 1/4 more cocoa, and found I had to substitute brown sugar for half of the sugar. Wonderful brownies! Awesome texture- somewhere in between dense/fudgy and cakey. Yum. Definitely keeping this recipe!

These will do if I don't have a Duncan Hines mix in the house.  I really didn't care for the taste, and decreasing the egg, as suggested by others made them a little too cake-like for me.  However they did cook nicely and came out of the pan better than any brownie I have ever baked!  Definately no need for the baking powder.

Great recipe. I actually had a hard time choosing which brownie recipe to take up. I am glad I choose this one. Reading some of the reviews helped alot. I followed as some suggested, only use 2 eggs and ommited the baking powder. I baked the first 15mins at 175C and then 25mins at 150C. This kind of avoided the edges from getting burned and the entire brownie had the same moist and fudgy consistency. The next time I make them, will double the recipe coz they dissapear really fast.

Used 2 eggs, omitted baking powder, and cut sugar by 1/4 cup as suggested.  Happy with results!  Other changes I'll make next time - cook 40 min.  I took them out at 35 min. when toothpick came out clean and edges appeared to harden (they were still soft).  Also, a little too salty.  Will use unsalted butter or omit salt.  Still, these were GREAT, and I will make again & again!!

Followed other suggestions and used two eggs and sugar to 1 1/4 cup.  I did not omit the baking powder just reduced it. My husband and I love these.  Strong chocolate and butter flavor!

i think these were very nice, fudgy but not too fugdy, chewy but not too chewy, just right! but its awfully similar to 'best brownies' but can be easily tweaked to be more fudgy n chewy: use 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar and add more cocoa powder. i did that with 'best brownies' and they came out nice and i did this recipe as it is, i liked these better. however, i think they'd turn out the same if i followed both exactly as it is! but author still deserves 2 thumbs up for this recipe!

I made these like several of you suggested, with 2 eggs and only a tiny  bit of baking powder.  I used 3/4 cup cocoa instead of 1/2, and I also added a thin layer of frosting and some mini-chips to the top.  They were GREAT!  Not too cakey, and just the right amount of sweetness.

This recipe is so good! I made it for my son's class and they loved it, his teacher loved it (and asked for the recipe), and all the techers she shared it with loved it and also want the recipe. This is a great brownie recipe and I think anyone who tries it and likes brownies will like this recipe.

Delicious, but a little too rich and sweet for my taste.  Everyone in my family loved it, though so I'll give it a five stars.  Very easy to make.  I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of the brownies at the middle of baking.

AMAZING brownies.  I used to make boxed brownies, but after making this easy, yet delicious recipe, I won't make boxed brownies ever again.  I listened to suggestions of others and this is what made the recipe so excellent: 1) use just 1/2 cup butter, 2) use just 1 1/4 cup sugar, 3) use just 2 eggs and 4) no baking powder.  Even better with vanilla ice cream.

Not even like store bought (which I love)& I even followed suggestions for chewy: 2 eggs, no baking powder, add choc. mini chips.  Way too much choc, so gooey had to scrape out of pan.  I think there needs to be atleast  a little baking powder to help them somewhat. Unlike many other dishes, homemade brownies have never been my thing though.

AWESOME!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!  I was little worried at first because the batter looked and tasted different then what I was used to with my other brownie recipe, but they were wonderful.  They were gone literally within a matter of minutes.

Like the other reivewers said, the brownie was more of a cake than a brownie. It was good, kind of dry, and very chocolately and easy to make. I would probably continue to look for a chewy brownie.

Wow!  These are the first brownies I ever made from scratch.  I made them earlier today, and they are already nearly half gone - everyone here just loves them!  Serve with a dollop of whipped topping, and it made for a very nice cool dessert on a hot evening.  This recipe is certainly going to be made again and again here - well done!

These are definitely way better than the Best Brownie from this site. I tried both recipes a few times. I'm always getting requests to make this that now I'm charging them. I doubled the all the ingredients and baked in a 12"x12" pan. I made some adjustments with 1/2C melted butter, 1/2C vegetable oil, 2C sugar and spread 1/2C roasted walnuts on top the brownie just before baking. Baked 30 ~ 35 min.
Topped the brownies with a chocolate glaze. Melt a bar(220g) of your favorite chocolate, 50g butter and 4 tblsp milk. Sometimes I sell them as a whole cake and and at other times in small squares.
I totally forgot to thank Biz McMahon for this recipe :). TQssss

If I could give this four and a half stars I would.  It was a huge hit with my friends (the entire batch was devoured in less than five minutes), so I made a second batch for work the next day (same thing happened).  These are very fudgy brownies, so what I did was I added about a half-cup of crushed Oreo crumbs I had leftover from another recipe and added it to the cocoa mixture.  What a hit!  It added texture but also a wonderful dark, creamy taste.  I bet you could do the same with any other kind of chocolate cookie...

Like the reviewer right before me said, realize that the recipe is more of a moist chocolate cake than a brownie.    It's good, but if you're looking for something chewy and fudgey (like I was), this isn't the recipe for you. Probably will not make again - I'm still searching for that perfect, chewy recipe!

These brownies were thick, chewy, and delicious. Even came with that wonderful crust! Watch the baking time carefully, as the sides have an easier tendency to burn. This will officially become THE brownie recipie to replace all others!

I did the whole 2 eggs 1/4 tsp of powder variations. I baked them for 45 minutes and they are burnt on the edges, and not cooked in the middle. Won't be making these again. Glad to see other people had better luck though.

This was the first brownie recipe I did off of allrecipies.com and the brownies came out so wonderful that I do not need to look any farther than this recipe.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to it (1/3 cup) and the brownies were wonderful!

Very good brownies. Brownies are my favorite dessert so I have tried many. These seemed a little sweet. I might cut to sugar to 1 1/2 cups next time. No one else seemed to notice though.

These were not high altitude friendly, but I think these would have been good at a lower altitude (or if I knew how to adjust the recipe).

These brownies are sooo good. Based on other reviews, i only used two eggs, omitted the baking powder, and only cooked for 30 minutes. I also used a round 8 inch cake pan because i didn't have a square pan. They came out wonderful; chocolately and chewy, just like i like 'em. My fiance loved them too. I didn't have any chocolate chips or else i would have added them. I did make up a peanut butter cream cheese icing to put on top. YUMMY!! I'm eating some right now. If they didn't have so many calories, i could eat them all day long.

These brownies were a cinch to make and so DELICIOUS!! I brought them to a baby shower and got rave reviews. I will definitely make them again soon. It is not even worth the money buying the boxed version anymore.

This recipe is great, but I thought it was too sweet and oily. So I would suggest using just 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup or even less of white sugar. I've made some changes also after reviewing other users suggestions: 2 eggs instead of 3; baking for 30 minutes instead of 40. Otherwise, this is a recipe that I'll definitely keep. Thanks Biz!

Very Easy to make and definetly better than store bought and in a box!  I just made these brownies again and still delicious.  If you like cake like brownies these are it.  I cooked mine for 37 mins and seemed done at 35 mins.

SO GOOD!!!  However, they were much much much much better 24 hours later.  They're very fudgy until they sit for a day, then they are perfect.  Best brownies EVER.

oh, these are the best, if I could rate them 6 stars I would.  I have made them twice in one week.  The first time I made them with a few alterations, I doubled the cocoa, only used 2 eggs, and added choc chips and walnuts, also added 3 tbs of corn syrup, as another reviewer suggested, and omitted the baking powder.  The second time, I didn't add choc chips or walnuts, but made otherwise made them the same way.  I liked them better without the choc chip and walnuts.  I love walnuts, but these brownies are so flavroful and fudgey, that they are so good as traditional brownies, without all the extras.  You DON'T need frosting on these browines!!  Last night I served them with ice cream and hot fudge, it was the BEST!

These brownies were so good warm from the oven. I didn't give it 5 stars though, because once they cooled, they were just okay, and they don't reheat really well.

Like everyone else says, this is a keeper!  At 47% calories from fat, it had better be.  You can't eat just one.  I baked mine for 40 minutes and they were still moist all of the way to the edges.  At 30 minutes, still jiggly in the middle.   If you don't use a 8-inch square, it's possible you don't need to bake them that long.

TO DIE FOR...these brownies were simply the best.  My boyfriend and I ate them warm with a scoop of vanilla icecream and it was heavenly to say the least.  SO much flavor, which for some reason I wasn't really expecting.  40 minutes was plenty baking time for me, because I don't care for cake-like brownies and this gave me the perfect consistency.  No more box brownies for me!

These were absolutely delicious--chewy & chocolaty!  I didn't have any cocoa on hand so I used a conversion table for substituting semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I substituted 1-1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chunks instead of cocoa, decreased the butter (I used Blue Bonnet tub margarine with no trans fats) to 1/4 cup + 2 Tsp, and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave with the margarine.  I used only 2 eggs (3 just seemed like a lot, especially since all of the box brownies I've used only call for one).  I also added a half cup of walnuts.  I cooked in a glass 9-inch pie dish for about 35 minutes.  This was my first time making brownies from scratch, and I simply cannot get over how fabulous they were!!  Try this recipe!

When I first made these I was hoping for something similar to  my ideal brownie, the Betty Crocker Chocolate Chunk Supreme brownies from a box, but I was disappointed. Even with the adjustments that others had made, 2 eggs and no baking powder, I ended up with a cake-like textured brownie with only a light chocolate taste. Although I did find a review that completely transformed this recipe for me, Nikki J (9/03), as written this recipe was not for me.

I followed the baking ingredients to a T but ended up only baking for 25 minutes and they were still done too much.  They tasted more like cake than brownies. My eldest son took one bite and asked if anyone wanted his.  This did not go over well.  Will keep looking....sorry

I have to admit, I use this brownie recipe all the time. These brownies are so simple to make, very quick. I used other people suggestions by adding chocolate chips and it was tasty. I like nuts added also. I also cut down on the sugar and oil and they were still delicious. I found that the cooking time was way too long for my liking, 30 min worked better for me.

Very good! followed recipe exactly... but added some chopped pecans to half the pan. Also put in a 9x13...we like them thin. Cooked for only about 20-22 minutes in a 9x13 and were perfect :)

These are good, but 40 minutes in the oven was way too long (I even turned the temp down a little) and they ended up burnt on the sides.  Would make again but change cooking time.

Great brownie recipe.  I followed another reviewers suggestion by eliminating one of the eggs and the baking powder.  Since Im a chocolate lover, I also added 2-3 more Tablespoons of cocoa and 1 Tablespoon of Hershey's Syrup.  The brownies were ready in 25 minutes.  Very Yummy!!   Thanks

These brownies are awesome!  I dusted them with powdered sugar and served them warm.  They were a hit! I just started baking from scratch and these were simple and wonderful.  Very light and moist!

I have made this recipe several times and each time they come out just the right moistness and crispness on top, the way I like them.  The recipes is so simple.  The only change I made was to add walnuts.  I use this brownie recipe for the brownie in the chocolate trifle recipe found on this site.

this recipe was phenomenal!
the first time I made it I thought it came out greasy from all the butter in it but the second time I made it instead of taking out some of the butter I added about 2 tbsp. more cocoa powder and that did the trick for me!
but over all this is an awesome recipe!

These brownies were a hit at home and at work. The only deviation I made from the recipe as written was to add some chopped walnuts. I did have some difficulty with the time. After 45 minutes they were pulling away from the sides of the dish so I took them out, but the center was not quite cooked completely. I'm afraid if I left them in longer the edges may have been over cooked. It may have been the glass dish so next time I'll try a different pan. Thanks for the recipe.

These were just wonderful. So yummy. I also did not add the baking powder like others suggested and only used 2 eggs also. I sprinkled chocolate chips on the bottom of my baking pan before I put the batter in the pan. I also put about 3/4 of a cup of chocolate chips in the batter and mixed them in. I will be making these alot. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent!!!!! I made them with two eggs and no baking powder, and they are wonderful.(They've also convinced me that that the pan I got for christmas last year may be great for some but I've decided it's best left for others.)

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan.  I only used 4 eggs and sprinkled mini chocolate chips on the batter before placing in the oven and baking for approximately 35 minutes.  My family could barely wait for them to cool and they were delicious.  But they were even better the next day.  We will be making these often.

Excellent recipe! I went with two eggs/no baking powder and they came out great! Start watching it after 25-30 min. Mine didn't pull away from the pan like it said it would, and I ended up burning the edges. I'm going to add chocolate chips next time!

This recipe comes out perfectly EVERY time.  It's just a fantastic brownie.  I tend to shorten the cooking time so they are particularly fudgy.  People always want the recipe.

OH YEAH!! This recipe is amazing. I have been searching for a while for great homemade brownies and this is it. I took the advice of previous reviews and only used 2 eggs and omitted the baking powder. I added chocolate chips. PERFECTION!! I was thinking about maybe next time adding nuts or toffee chips to it as well.

Wonderful, chocolatey brownies.  I don't mix after each egg because it makes the top a little weird.  Still, a fantastic recipe.

I love this recipe.  It's quick, easy, and delicious.  I reduce the number of eggs to two (2) for more fudgy brownies.  I also add pecans or walnuts (1/2 cup to 1 cup).

I just received my All Recipes cookbook and tried this recipe.  The whole house smelled wonderful while the brownies baked.  I used Dutch processed cocoa which I think makes them taste better. I think next time, I will use only two eggs so they are not so cake-like as suggested by other reviewers.

WOW! This is a great brownie recipe.  I have never made them from scratch before, and these were fantastic.  Moist and fudgey with a crunchy top! I am converted from the boxed kind.  I also added only 2 eggs, an extra Tbsp of cocoa, 1/4 cup of cinnamon applesauce (1/2 cup butter) and chocolate chips.  Yum! Yum! Thanks for the recipe.

Great easy brownie recipe! I frosted them using the peanut butter frosting recipe I found here (submitted by Suzanne Stull), and they were awesome! I especially like the fact that no special ingredients are needed. (I always try to use the Dutch processed (also called alkalai processed) cocoa, though, because I think the flavor is better. I froze a few of these (after they were frosted), and they were just as good when I thawed them out a few days later.

Next week I'll be moving to the States from Holland for three years. I've been making these brownies for my friends and family for some time now, and they think my stay in the States will be great, especially cookie-wise!
These brownies taste great and are very easy to make, even for a simple Dutch-woman. Several people have asked me for the recipe, and I have happily directed them to this site.

This is by far the best brownie I have ever eaten...and eaten...and eaten. The only thing wrong with this brownie is that it is impossible to stay away from.  I added toasted walnuts, and iced it with a light coating of chocolate frosting.  TO DIE FOR!!!!!

I added marshmellows and chocolate chips to this surprisingly easy recipe. This recipe is better than store bought any time! Next time I'll try nuts as well.

These are quick and good.  Everyone liked them.  Using real butter gives these a unique flavor from most brownies.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on top but chocolate frosting would be a double-chocolate treat.

Curiosity caught the best of me, and so I peeked into the oven after only 20 minutes to see how these brownies were faring.  To my horror, they were cooking over the sides of the pan!  But I decided to simply poke a few holes in the top and the mixture subsided.  I thought for sure I would have to throw these away, but I'm so glad I dont go solely on appearance, because these were without a doubt the best brownies I've ever had!  The bonus was that I got to eat all the "crust" that had cooked outside the pan, and no one missed it.  LOL  These were gone in less than 3 hours, and I am baking 3 more batches today.  Thanks for the recipe!  Its magical!

These are great brownies--especially great when you want something home made but don't have a lot of time.  Once I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the recipe, and those turned out great, too!

Great and chewy, these were so easy to make and the perfect consistency.  Love 'em.  They're much better if you use dutch processed cocoa (Hershey's Dark Chocolate).  They come out soooo chocolatey.

I made these almost to recipe. I had to replace regular sugar with turbinado sugar, other than that, exact. The brownies turned out good. they are definitely not fudge brownies. they are substantial and tasty. I could see how these could be considered cakey when overcooked. Mine we're cooked properly. They had the tell tale Brownies top crunch. They definitely passed the taste test. I will enjoy these babies again!

These are good brownies !  No need to modify them unless u had Choc chips & whatever type of nuts you prefer.  Only problem I find if u do not eat soon enough they tend to get a bit dry .  But from my years of baking all brownies do.   I use this recipe all the time for my go to brownies.

I used a 9 inch pan and increased the baking powder to 1 tsp (I hadn't read the reviews). I used dutch processed cocoa and I added 1 cup toasted pecans and decreased the baking time to 25 minutes. They came out quite good. I will make them again.

These brownies have a unique texture.  They are light but chewy, and have a rich chocolate flavor.  I attribute the rich flavor to using "Special Dark" cocoa.  I also used 1t. coffee extract and 1/2t. vanilla.  I added a dash of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  I love this recipe.  It will become a staple dessert for sure!

Best brownies ever! Chocolatey and chewy, no adjustments needed at all. Other reviews say this is cake or it sticks to the pan, not true. TIPS: use a glass baking dish, grease pan with butter not cooking spray, WAIT until completey cooled before cutting. If you don't have a glass baking dish try dusting your greased pan with cocoa. Every oven is different so I baked these at 325 for 40 min, they were perfect. Saying this is a bad recipe is like saying a book is bad because there are too many big words, if you don't know baking 101 then any recipe might be difficult.

It’s got a buttery flavor with a cake texture! Super easy recipe to throw together and I was pleasantly surprised with it’s the outcome! I would say it’s a cross between brownie and chocolate cake! YUM

I completely agree with StephanieM and other reviewers that it is misleading to change a recipe then give it a high rating. I followed the recipe to a "T". I would not describe the end result as a "brownie". It was more like a cake. Note that MommyFromSeattle who rated it a "4" changed @ least 2 ingredients. With those changes, she was able to say it was a "chewy brownie." The original recipe is not. While it was okay, I would not make this again. I wanted brownie, not cake!!!

I added 1/4 cup of applesauce and only 1/2 cup butter like other readers wrote.  I didn't have any baking powder so added 1/4 t. baking soda.  My family loved them.  Only negative is I should of doubled the recipe.  One thing, is always remember to cut them with a plastic knife.

Followed everyone else's suggestions regarding the egg, baking powder and salt.  But to me they were a basic fudgy brownie, nothing spectacular at all.

This is now my GO-TO brownie recipe!. I eliminated 1 egg and it's the perfect texture brownie that you can hold in your hand and eat without it crumbling. Chocolate flavor is just enough.

They work really well in a Pampered Chef brownie pan where every brownie has crust.

These were good brownies, but they turned out more cakey and drier, rather than fudgey how I like them.  I also love crackly tops and these had a more drier crunchy top.  I should of read the other reviews that mentioned to add 1 less egg and minus the baking powder.  I think if you do those steps, it will come out more like a fudgey brownie, rather than a brownie cake.  I also did have to add more cocoa powder to get a richer chocolate taste.  Overall it was good and we still ate them.  For the recipe as written, I have to give 3 stars.  But I am sure if you tweaked it like others have, it would be a 5 star recipe.  Thank you for the recipe!

Amazing, and if you like mushy and soft brownies these are your type! Definitely try them but do be aware they go stale within 3 days to a week

5/5! Great Brownies!

So easy and tastes great!  The only thing I would recommend is watching it closely at the 30 minute mark.  I pulled mine out of the oven at 40 minutes, but it would have been better at 35 mins.

Incredible!!! Very delicious! These brownies were so rich in flavor and color and the amounts were perfect as well! However, I added in about 4-5 tablespoons of semi-sweet chocolate chips and this just enhanced the flavor a lot. Definitely making again!

3 29 17 ... 'http://allrecipes.com/recipe/11063/deep-dish-brownies/ ... Liked these, but even with changes to make more fudgylesscakey, they weren't "it."  Sorry, if you're one to say "Don't change it, then rate it."  I can figure things out sometimes before actually doing it to know the outcome & if I don't want that outcome ... well, you know.  :D  As is, this would be cakelike.  My changes:  one less egg, an additional quarter cup cocoa & no baking powder.  These were a shade or two less than dark, not ridiculously dark, but I'd go with the half cup listed.  The top had a firm enough crust to crack like pavement when it's being destroyed, meaning uneven - so cut from the top down, not horizontally.  I tried these & Uncle Drew's (also with changes) & I liked Uncle Drew's modified recipe better.  No haters.  ;) ... K & S liked these, deepdish, better.  They look more cakelike than they are; taste slightly cakelike.  Three from me; four from KK.

These brownies were absolutely delicious. I think I'm more of a gooey brownie recipe kind of lady though. My oven tends to overcook, so possibility is that my oven cooked them to a more cake like consistency at no fault of the recipe.

Best brownies ever.  Moist, chocolatey, gooey but not greasy. Pay attention so you don't overbake or they might wind up too cakey. Mine only went 44 minutes and they were perfect.

Made these twice in one week. Followed recipe exactly and added one cup chopped walnuts. They were rich, chewy, chocolately, with a nice crust. It was not cake-like. I will never search for a brownie recipe again. I have found mine!

Followed this recipe exactly - it lived up to its name - it was a deep dish, with a nice dense texture, delicious taste.  I used a good quality cocoa powder that may have helped intensify the flavour.  Very simple recipe, very easy to put together.  It took a lot longer to cook, however.    Served it with a black cherry sauce (from elsewhere) for a great finish to an Oktoberfest lunch

Great fluffy uncomplicated brownies!  I was discouraged by all the changes that were made in the other reviews.  Yet still I didn't change a thing and they turned out great!

These are only brownies if you change the recipe and omit the baking powder. Unfortunately, people rated this recipe 5 stars even though they changed the recipe. I made as-is after seeing high reviews (even doubled the recipe) and now have a 9x13 pan of fluffy cake--not the dense brownies like pictured!

Love the chewy bits. It was a great treat when you want to make brownies but don't have a mix. I don't know that we will use a mix now.

I have been making this recipe for a few years. I do omit the baking powder and one of the eggs as other reviews suggest. I also reduce the sugar to 1 cup.

This was delicious to make! However, if you want to make the brownies almost like a cookie, but at the same time still hold its brownie features, I made a few changes:

1) Only use 2 eggs instead of 3 
2) Only use 1 cup of sugar 
3) Only use 1/3 cup of cocoa powder 
4) Don't bother measuring out the salt, just take a pinch 
5) Bake for around 43 or 45 minutes to make it crunchy on the outside

After that, enjoy!

Now I normally read the reviews before doing a recipe on this site and I didn't with this recipe.  I should have done what others have suggested and that's to increase the cocoa and not put any baking powder or salt in it.  I found it way too "cakey" and not chocolatey enough.

These were pretty bad. I followed the recipe exactly and they hardly had any flavor and tasted like some poor quality chocolate cake. Brownies aren't difficult to make but this recipe found a way to mess up brownies.

These brownies are so delicious. Blending the  eggs individually gives an airiness to them and the baking powder
 makes them even more airy. One of my favorite treats.

I made this just as described, and I'm glad I did.  They are more cake-like than chewy ... exactly as I prefer my brownies!  I read some other reviews that indicated a 35 min bake time, but MINE needed the FULL 45 minutes of baking.  I also added a hand full of Kraft Premium Caramel Bits to the top before baking and pushed them into the batter before baking.  They added another lovely layer of flavor.  Otherwise, this was super easy to make just as is. Never need a box mix again!

Excellent.  Very moist and fudgy. Used a 8x8 glass pan. Cooked 45 min.  Made as written except added chopped milk chocolate bars. 

Next time I might cook in a 9x9 pan to see if center is a little more cooked.

these were just what I was craving :) I followed recipe accept for the salt, I used pink Himalayan salt. I also used truvia baking blend,and baked in cupcake liners for 12-15 mins. I'm diabetic, and couldn't taste the difference. By using the cupcake liners I got 16 servings. Very delicious thanks for posting the recipe.

Made these for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and had to force myself not to eat them all, lol. Very chocolatey and chewy and just delicious! Tastes like the two bite brownies you buy at the store. Definitely will make again!

I followed another member's suggestion and doubled the recipe and changed the following, used a 9x13 inch pan, 1 1/2 cups cocoa, 4 eggs. I was low on butter so I used 1/2 cup margarine and half a cup of vegetable oil. I didn't use baking powder, and  I also used half cup of sugar and half cup brown sugar.  My oven is a little on the quicker side, for me it took about 25-30 mins.  Brownies were delicious, chewy and chocolaty!

The only changes I made were  3 drops of rootbeer extract, and extra powder. The rootbeer gives a deliciously interesting twist, and I put it in everything. Needless to say, these brownies were very good

I made these according to the directions. They are a good recipe if you want brownies that are not quite as rich or sweet. I've made some brownie recipes that contained way too much sugar. They would also be good with some ice cream on top.

I followed the recipe to a t and the brownies came out perfectly! the only thing I changed was the pan I used. I couldn't find a square pan, although I could have sworn we had one, and because of that the cooking time was off.  Without a doubt these brownies are one of the best I've had and I plan on using this recipe again!

I'm pretty fussy about my brownies. I'm a purist and don't like any extra frou frou stuff in them --  not even nuts.  And I also like cakey brownies as opposed to fudgey. Sometimes fudgey is so fudgey that you might as well eat the batter.  I did make one change to the recipe and cut the amount of the sugar by 1/4 cup and I think it can be cut by another 1/4 cup so that it's a total of one cup of sugar. This recipe met all my expectations for a great brownie and I'll make it again.

I made exactly as written and they were excellent. Don't feel like you have to reduce eggs or leave out the baking powder. These were not cake like, just a thick moist brownie. I started receiving not so subtle hints the next day that it was already time to make another batch (or another bucket of them brownies per one requester).

I wish I would have read the reviews for the changes before I made them. I followed the directions perfectly and it's basically chocolate cake. They are good, if you like cake type brownies. I just prefer them to be dense and chewy.

These are now my go-to recipe for brownies. I did add just a little more cocoa powder to mine, maybe 1 tbsp. Perfectly moist.

When following advice to reduce eggs to 2, remove baking powder, and increase cocoa to 3/4 cup, this recipe becomes better than boxed! Didn't try the original form as it would be too cakey for me.

Oh my gosh these are delicious! I'll never make the box varieties again. They are very chocolately but not too rich. They are the perfect texture. Not too cakey and not like dense fudge. My husband and I ate the entire pan in less than 2 days (yes, we are pigs!). This recipe is highly recommended. I did not alter the recipe in any way.

Me and my whole family fell in love with these, cake like, brownies! I stuck to the recipe because it's not fair to say you made these, or any other person's recipes, if you don't follow THEIR recipe. I'm making them again this weekend for a dinner party. Yummy. Ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce on top...a chocolate lovers dream come true!

I did the recipe mostly as written, with two changes necessitated by ingredient availability: replaced the butter with coconut oil, and used dark chocolate cocoa powder.  The batter seemed very thick (more than other brownies I made), but when it cooked up, it was very tasty - definitely chocolatey enough for us.  The center was a bit more flat and traditional brownie, but the edges had risen and gotten a good measure of that crispness that both my wife and I enjoy on the edges.  Our boys asked for seconds, and got more whenever they had an opportunity.  I will agree that if you're looking for the soft, fudgey, over the top chocolate brownie, this recipe (at least as written) isn't it, but it is a good brownie in its own right.

I was hoping it wouldn't turn out dry and stuff like other brownies and when I made them it did look like that but when I took a bite the brownie combines in your mouth and it feels so gooey and tastes SO GOOD!

The flavor is amazing, very rich with a moist, gooey texture. I liked the beautiful crispy crust, but would have liked it if they were more chewy.

Normally, I would follow a recipe exactly. However, I really wanted a fudgy brownie, so after reading the reviews, I tried this recipe with the modifications (2 eggs, no baking powder) everyone suggested. My brownies still came out rather cakey and I found all the butter made them greasy.

I used two eggs, 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, included the baking powder, and added walnuts & chocolate chips. 40 minutes was enough time in the oven.  It was a good tasting brownie and had great consistency throughout (wasn't too cake-like), but it was too chocolately.

The only thing I did differently was doubled the recipe.  They have that nice crusty layer on top but are super moist inside.  I will for sure be doing these again in the future!!

This is my go to quick dessert! We all love this in our house. Tastes exactly like a brownie from a box but better and you know what is in it. It's just as easy as a box brownie as well to make. I usually add some peanut butter chips as an added something. Very very good brownie!

The chocolate flavor in these is so rich, without being overbearing!  Better than any box mix. I followed the recipe as listed, but I did use my KitchenAid paddle attachment for all stages. Doing this, rather than stirring in the dry ingredients by hand, made these brownies more cake-like.  I actually prefer cake-like, so I'm really happy!
  
Modification and results: I baked these in a 9 slot silicone pan, giving perfect individual sized brownies. I softened some Dulche de Leche (caramel sauce) and swirled a small amount in each brownie.  Because the batter came out cake-like, and with the heaviness of the caramel, just before the brownies were done, they collapsed!  They are still very delicious, just not so pretty!)

I will try these again without the Dulche de Leche, and mixing in the dry ingredients by hand, to see the difference.  Otherwise, I think these are the best tasting brownies ever and I will make them again!

I usually make Mmmm-mmm better brownies from this site and have been using that recipe for chewy brownies for a while now, and it's fantastic for chewy brownies. I had company over who love the opposite, they love cake style brownies, and from the reviews, I figured I'd give these a try. I was pretty sure I would not like them, but these were fantastic! Not as cakey or dry as I thought they'd be, and I loved them and my guests loved them too! I used margarine as I didn't have butter($5.99 a lb at walmart!) and Hershey's dark cocoa powder. The rest I left as is, and added instant coffee powder and chocolate chips, which I add in any brownie recipe. They came out not overpoweringly sweet like some recipes which was nice since we added ice cream! They were not as chewy as some other brownies, but they still had a slight chewiness to them, don't know if that had to do with the margarine, but I'll continue to use it in this recipe. It was a nice change of pace from my regular brownie recipe, and even the chewy brownie lovers, loved this recipe! Will definitely make again! Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

I don't know how so many people have has success with this recipe. I've been cooking and baking all my life and his turned out so poorly. It tastes like a cheap box mix.  It was very very dry and crumbly. I'm not trying to knock his recipe but just tell you how mine turned out. I was hoping for something more chocolatey and chewier. Don't know what happen end here.

This was probably one of the better recipes that I have tried. Like others suggested, I only use 2 eggs instead of 3. Using 3 eggs would make for brownies that are more cake like.  I  added about a half cup or so of chocolate chips. For a little extra depth of flavor, I divided the sugar into half brown and half white.

Tried the recipe with the below review, less egg more cocoa. Kept butter rather than applesauce. Very good, mine were really chewy and not that moist. Make sure you cook it less than 40 minutes. I did around 35

I had a hard time looking for a brownie recipe that was NOT fudgy, since my husband only likes cakey brownies. Up until now, I've been buying the Duncan Hines fudgy brownies mix and making the cakey version on the back using one more egg. These are perfect exactly the way they are, staying true to the recipe. My husband likes them better than the Duncan Hines and I don't have to use a pre-made chemical mix. Finally!

A made these brownies and they were great! They tasted way better than brownies out of a box:). It was also very easy and it didn't take long to make the batter. Me and my family always take the brownies out a few minutes before they are done. So we took them our about 5 minutes before they were done let them cool and enjoyed with a cup of milk.

I made these last night. I doubled the recipe which worked well and used a 9x13 pyrex to bake them in. I had them in for about 43 minutes. I added 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips, 1/2 cup toffee bits, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I also sptinkled the top with nuts and toffee before baking them. My boyfriend brought them to school and he was asked if I ever thought about selling my products! Great recipe! Perfect thickness and texture in a brownie hands down! (with a little help from my imagination of course)

I tried this recipe as it is written. The time was way too long for baking. I would check them after 20 minutes. These make very cake style brownies which is not what I was looking for at all and really it was not to my taste one bit. After alterations I made my own and am happy.

These turned out rich, buttery and chewy. I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I'm not certain how other reviewers have found them to be cake-like.  Of course the type of pan and oven used can alter the results.  They came out perfect in 40 minutes.

Very good, 2 eggs, one stick butter, 1/4 brewed coffee, and bisquick for the flour ( it has the salt and baking soda needed) with 1 1/2C sugar.  I used 9 x13 pryex pan and cooked it for 25 mins

this is a great brownie recipe and i don't really like chocolate. i took the advice of some reviews and used only 2 eggs. i also baked these in an 8x8 dish and they were a good size. they are rather rich so a little goes a long way. they are a super easy one bowl dessert.

It's okay. Very rich,but definitely different from any other type of brownie i've tasted. I'm not sure if it's because I  made it from scratch and could see everything going into it, but at times it seemed to taste too rich to the point of tasting the pure sugar/butter that went into it.

It's very possible that I somehow screwed up but my brownies turned out quite flat, but ok tasting. The icing was really not a necessity nor did it make them better. If I made this again I would leave out the honey of the icing.

This was my first attempt at homemade brownies and they were extremely fudgy and rich!  According to all the other reviews, I also used only 2 eggs and left out the baking powder.  I didn't necessarily LOVE these brownies, I personally thought they tasted very buttery how I made them. (Living in Australia, I'm trying to get used to all the different ingredients here too!) I'm giving them 4 stars though because my husband took them to a work function and came home with a completely empty plate and said that everyone RAVED over them!  I plan to keep looking around for a perfect homemade brownie recipe.

Without a doubt the best brownies I have ever had.  We sell these at bake sales and charge double what we are charging for other brownies and these always sell out first!  Double the recipe and make in a large pan.

I omitted the baking powder, added only 2 eggs and 1/4 cup more cocoa like others suggested... and they were AMAZING!!! I'm ADDICTED!! By far the best from scratch recipe! This is one I'll continue to make from here on out.

I went ahead and made all the changes, 2 eggs, xtra cocoa and sugar, no baking powder, and they were amazing! I even put chocolate chips on top. I'm sad- I'll never be able to eat a boxed brownie again :(

Very good!  I didn't have enough cocoa so I only ended up using 1/3 cup about...and they still turned out great.  I added chocolte chips to mine..and probably won't next time considering they floated to the bottom b/c the batter wasn't thick enough.  Still great tasting though!

Delicious. Delightful chocolate taste, texture is moist and brownie is firm and rich.  Did not require the icing that I added.  It is wonderful without.  Will add this one to my favorites.  Thank you Biz for sharing.

These are probably the best brownies I've ever had!  I sprinkled some milk chocolate chips on top.  They are so easy and I always have everything on hand.  I will probably never buy box brownies ever again.

These tasted good but had a pretty crunchy crust. I don't know if that is normal or not but I think that they would be better if the top wasn't as crusty.

I would not only grease, but also flour the pan these go into. They came out a little hard. I doubled the recipe, and put into a 9x13x2 pan. I like frosted brownies, so made chocolate cream cheese frosting from this site,(1/2 of the recipe) and put on top once cool. Very, very good recipe!!!

Followed others advice and cut the egg down by 1 and left out the baking soda. I also shorted the time by 5 min as I like my brownies slightly undercooked for a gooey middle. I ended up throwing some chocolate icing I had left in the fridge from another dessert on top. This was a HUGE hit at the office and will definitely be making it again. Pretty easy to put together, but uses LOTS of cocoa so make sure you have it before you start...I just had enough!

I did this brownies today, for the first time. As other reviwers suggested, I omitted 1 egg and the baking powder. I used 24g of Vanilla Sugar (I ran out of the essance) and had reduced the white sugar as well as the butter. In the beginning I melted the butter, but was little worried if I mixed the eggs (and the flour) into the warm melted butter (I heated the butter) would somehow alter the texture, so I let it chilled until it reached the room temparature and then blended everything together. I think next time I will just use out-from-the-fridge butter, it worked fine in my previous baking experience.

It was baked for 40 mins, heavenly smell and and tasted very rich in chocolate! I added some banana slices on top of the brownies, for some extra sweet and fruity taste. They were finished just in a few minutes once were out from the oven. Totally NOT enough for a family of 4!

I don't have to buy from the supermarkets anymore since I can bake such delicious brownies so fast and easily! Perfect for high-tea!

Omitted one egg and only used 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda.  Added walnuts and mini chocolate chips.  Turned out too sweet and had to bake longer than 45 minutes.  Family said it was just ok.  Not the best.  Will try another recipe.

This is really a spectacular recipe! I threw out all my other brownie recipes after trying this one. It's easy to modify (adding things on top like marshmallows, jam or little candies) and always turn out great. I've tried the recipe using only 2 eggs and no baking powder or salt and every time they're awesome!

What an awesome, easy recipe.  I utilized the same changes as other reviewers (eggs, baking powder and more cocoa).  I made the 8x8 recipe and baked for 35 minutes.  During last 5 minutes I topped with mini chocolate chips, toasted chopped pecans, sea salt & caramel sauce I made (Trader Joe's Fleur de Sel caramels melted with a splash of whipping cream).  They cut like a dream when cooled.  A gourmet dessert in under an hour; how can you beat that?!  Thanks for sharing this gem!

I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 eggs instead of 3, omitted the baking powder, and added extra cocoa + walnuts + chocolate chips to produce a chewy, fudgy brownie.  They came out just like that, but even better than I could have hoped!

A definite crowd-pleaser. I doubled it and used 5 eggs instead of 6, and special dark chocolate cocoa. I also added one cup each semi-sweet chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and peanut butter chips. I bake a lot for my co-workers (in an office of 60) and these were raved about!

One day when I had only one egg available, I made these brownies.  They turned out with the same great test.  I am so pleased with this wonderful, but easy recipe.  Thanks Biz.

These are the best brownies I have ever made.  I did make adjustments to the recipe ... I only used 1/2 cup of butter because otherwise the butter taste is overwhelming.  I omitted the baking powder and only used 2 eggs as others suggested because I prefer fudgy brownies to cakelike brownies.  I put M&Ms on top of one batch.  I will definitely make these again and again!

This is the best brownie recipe I have found. I did only put 2 eggs and left out the baking powder as others had said because we wanted chewy brownies not cake like. Texture was perfect, chocolate flavor was perfect.

I added chocolate chips to the batter. These are by far the best homemade brownies I've ever had. They're not cakey at all and have that from-the-box flaky stuff on top.

Maybe I did a wrong combo: I added in the baking powder but I used only 2 eggs, as suggested for fudgier brownies. They were a yummy fudgy in the middle of the dish, but a weird dry & spongy border. They tasted good, though!

These were good, but not really deep dish. I did as others suggested an omitted one egg and didn't use baking powder. Before putting the brownies into the oven, I cut some Hershey's Kisses in half and pressed them into the batter. This added some great chocolatey-ness to them. While I LOVE fudgy and chewy browines (and these are) - I was hoping they would be a bit thicker. Next time, I think I'll add a but of baking powder, maybe 1/4 tsp. and still uses just 2 eggs.

I started out this recipe by doubling it for a 13x9 pan.

I got the butter melted and added the sugar.  Went to add the eggs and realized I was 1 short (4 instead of 5) so I tossed in a Tbls. and a half of mayo.

Got it all mixed up (hint for people who don't want "cakey" brownies...mix by hand with a spoon until JUST combined...if you overmix, you get cakey, not fudgy).

Started putting in pan and realized that I forgot to add the chocolate chips *sighs*...so I put half the batter in the pan, tossed about 2 cups of chocolate chips on top of batter and then, topped with the rest of the batter.  I baked at 350 for 35 minutes (probably could have done 30).

These turned out GREAT!!  The only home-made recipe that I've ever found that I liked.

Very nice crisp top. Trim edges. Nice texture between chewy and cake like.
Used 2 eggs. Reduced sugar by 1/4C. Reduced baking powder by 1/4t. Added toasted pecan pieces done in brown sugar w/ hint of cin. & sugar.Bake at suggested temp. Check before full time is up

Motivated by all the great reviews, I tried this tonight only to be disappointed.  Followed the recommendations to use 2 eggs and omit the baking powder,they wound up turning out like a dry cake.  I even reduced baking time to 30 minutes, hoping for some chocolatey gooeyness.  Oh well.  Thanks for letting me try!

PERFECT. Exactly what I was looking for. I followed other's advice and used only one egg and no baking powder. I also added a bit of dark chocolate syrup. Awesome brownies; they were chewy yet moist at the same time.

Wow....I use this site a lot and always target recipes with good ratings from a lot of different cooks...and until now I have never been so impressed that i was compelled to review a recipe myself.  These brownies are AMAZING.  I doubled the recipe but used 5 eggs rather than 6 and I used natural process cocoa powder from Penzeys (it's twice as chocolatey as the stuff you get in the grocery store).  The only trouble I had was that the edges of the brownies got a little more well done than I would have liked before the center was cooked...

These were okay. I omited 1 egg.  Texture was great, but they were greasy tasting to me - as I noted others commented.  I will try another recipe next time - or maybe try and reduce the butter.

I feel these were a little more greasy than necessary. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added one less egg. Worked magically (other than the grease factor). And the grease didn't necessarily ruin the flavor or anything. They just felt greasy. maybe less pam next time. Good all the same, worth the efforts.

Unanimously voted best brownies ever. Used only two eggs, omitted the baking powder and added a generous handful of special dark chocolate chips. SOOOO Good!

I only give this 4 stars because I took everyone's suggestions and made an almost completely different recipe.But, all in all, They still came out absolutely delicious and this recipe was a good start for a great brownie!

Very tasty brownies! I also followed other reviewers and made some changes to the recipe. I only used 2 eggs and halved the sugar to 3/4 cup. I also omitted the baking powder and reduced the butter to 1/2 cup. I used a fan oven, so I reduced the heat to 165 degrees and baked the brownies for 35 minutes. Still, the brownies were really nice. Definitely use this recipe again!!

These were delicious! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did not follow the recipe as written and took others' advice and omitted one egg and the baking powder.

I am very particular about my brownies and have yet to find a recipe to meet my high standards.  This is the one!!!  I followed other's advice and left out one egg and the baking soda.  Betty Crocker eat your heart out.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

These were okay. I followed the recipe exactly as stated but just weren't exactly what I was looking for. May try again and follow others suggestions. **Make sure no one runs, jumps, slams the oven door while cooking these or they may fall down in the middle as my first batch did**

I changed this recipe A LOT - but since it's where I started I wanted to at least give credit where credit is due.  I have made them twice this week for different groups of people and they have been a HUGE success.

My changes:  slightly less butter, 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar, only 2 eggs, no baking soda, 1tsp instant coffee crystals, 1cp semisweet chocolate chips, 1/2 c chopped walnuts.  Like I said - I modified sooooo much.

And then I made a cream cheese and raspberry jam frosting with a chocolate glaze.

Really, really, really tasty.  Not quite fudge, not quite cake - chewy, moist, and a great blend with the frosting.

I changed the cocoa powder to 2/3 cup, used 2 eggs, and omitted the baking powder. With those changes, this recipe  is FANTASTIC. Perfect chocolate brownies, and for a different taste, change the type of extract you use (try mint or orange instead of vanilla, for example). This is now my standard brownie recipe!

5 stars if you alter the recipe to 2 eggs and no baking powder.  I tried using 3 small eggs and adding some coarse graham crumbs and it turned out great!

Made these several times-- each time there was a slightly burnt taste to the brownies, even though they were not overcooked. Not exactly what I was looking for... Teenaged son still asks for them regularly...

Thank you so much for this recipe. So far, this is the best brownies recipe I have ever attempted. I used only 2 eggs and omitted the baking powder to get chewy brownies, as other reviewers suggested. So scrumptious!

These are pretty good. I baked them a little too long so they came out cakey, but they were still delicious. Next time I will time them better (20 minutes instead of 30).

My wife and I just made these.... We were very pleased. They had just the right texture and were topped off with that made from scratch taste! Excellent!  A perfect companion to the home made chocolate frosting we tossed up as well.

I made the same changes recommended by other reviewers... only 2 eggs, ommitted the baking powder, and added more cocoa (almost 3/4c). I baked them exactly 40 minutes. The texture of these was perfect, but I think they didn't taste as good as I was expecting. My husband kept saying he could taste the salt and I agree-they could have been a bit sweeter. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't care for the chocolate flavor. I thought it wasn't very chocolate-y. I think the boxed mixes are better in flavor. If I make this again I think I will add chocolate syrup to the mix and add more sugar. I think this will help the flavor. But the texture is AWESOME as is!

I made the recipe the 1st time with the suggested changes - only 2 eggs and no baking soda.  I also added a little over 1/2 a bag of chocolate chips and a bag of pecan pieces.  I LOVED it, and so did my 5 year old!!!  It was rich and gooey - just what I wanted at the moment.  My husband prefers more cakey brownies; I'm sure that if I change the recipe back to the original, it'll still be wonderful.

We had people over for take out and needed a quick delicious something chocolate to top it off.  I literally whipped these up in minutes and about 40 minutes later... chewy, fudgey, eat-the-whole-pan-delicious.  I followed other reviewers advice and cut the recipe to 2 eggs and added a cup of chocolate chips.  My guests raved and gobbled them up simultaneously. This is officially my go-to brownie recipe.

I can give this recipe 10 stars.  It's an easy recipe to do and it has terrific results.  Most and yummy. I can attest that 2 eggs will suffice.  I also put coarsely chopped cashew nuts on top. Just watch out because the nuts might get too dark.  I'll look for a light frosting recipe so I could also put mini marshmallows on top. I found my perfect brownie.

These were absolutely delicious! I followed some reviewers instructions(only put in 2 eggs and omitted the baking powder) and it was really fudgy and everyone loved it! Next time i would follow the recipe to the T because even after they seemed done the bottom was kinda sticky and it was hard to take it out of the pan which is why i gave it 4 statrs but other than that the brownies were great!

Sheer perfection! I used a gluten-free all purpose flour instead of the normal flour and I used only 2 eggs omitted the baking powder and added 1 cup of semi- sweet chocolate chips and they turned out fudgy and great! This has become my new brownie recipe!

I just made these today.  I only used 2 of the eggs and omitted the baking soda.  I still found that this brownie is more like chocolate cake.  I did add some chocolate chips to the top, as I was really, really craving chocolate.  I'm hoping to try another recipe next time that is more like a brownie.

PERFECT for a chocolate fix! Very decadent. As others suggested I used only two eggs and omitted the baking powder.  Baked in muffin tins for about 18 minutes - so so so yummy!

It was delicious! I made them into mini brownie bites using my muffin pans. Put chocolate frosting on top. Everyone loved the brownie bites!

I made these for my fiance and he absolutely loved them. Like many others, I left out the baking powder and used only 2 eggs.  I also added walnuts.  The texture was perfect: not too cakey and not gooey.  Also very easy to make!

A simple and delicious brownie recipe.  No frosting is needed in my opinion, but I might add walnuts the next time i make this.  I took this to a trivia night with a group of about 10.  They were gone within 30 minutes.

This brownies are probably one of the easiest and most delicious brownies I've ever made. I was in a mood for a rich choclately dessert that could be made easily and cheaply and this certainly fit the bill! I did as the other reviewers did and decreased the eggs and omitted the baking soda. Will try again!

These brownies were good; cakey but I prefer a fudgy brownie.  Also could have used a little more chocolate flavor. The only thing I did was add a handful of mini marshmallows and sprinkled a cup of peanut butter chips over the top before baking which was a nice addition.  Think I'll keep looking for a fudgier brownie.

I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and used only 2 eggs. Next time I will add a touch more flour.

* Used 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup apple sauce.  Strong buttery taste:  recommend 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup apple sauce.
* Baking recommended 45 minutes, mine was raw, except the edges (and failed toothpick test).  Maybe the rack was too low in the oven?  Used round pyrex.
* Recommended 1 1/12 cups sugar was fine, even though I also used sweetened cocoa powder.
* Reduced eggs to 2.
* Eliminated baking powder.

good flavor, but it was missing something, and it was so cakey....and even more-so the day after.  I might play around with the measurements as others did next time....but the flavor was good :)

This was a classic, delicious brownie recipe.  Very easy to mix up and they bake up beautifully in about 45 minutes.  The only thing that would make these more perfect would be chocolate chunks.

Yummmm! These brownies are delicious! I too only used 3 eggs and didn't add the baking powder and they were absolutely perfect. I have got some in the oven right now with chunks of chocolate and mars bars in them. They smell so good!!

Made it for my work and it got rave reviews!  I didn't change the recipe and actually liked that it was a little more cakey than brownies are normally.  I sprinkled mini chocolate chips all over the top instead of using icing and it turned out fantastic.  Will definitely make it again.

Fantastic!  The best brownies I've ever made!  I used 3 extra large egg whites & light butter (due to health problems, I can not eat a lot of high fat foods). They came out great!  Will make again and again!

I covered mine with icing and dbl. stuffed Oreos and served them at a Pampered Chef party! Flavor is excellent, but it has more of a cake like texture than a traditional brownie. It isn't as dense.

Fantastic! I've made these twice with some of the modifications suggested here, plus I added a total of 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter (1/2c semi-sweet, 1/4c each of white and dark), and they were a hit! I am gradually reducing the baking time because I have found the edges are a little over cooked. I am a big brownie fan and these were delicious!

I have made these brownies repeatedly for my family and friends and everyone absolutely loves them.  For those chocoholics that can't get enough chocolate, i started adding half a block of dark chocolate to the recipe at the end, by breaking it into pieces and sprinkling it over the batter before it goes into the oven.  We really like to eat this as a dessert, and when it is warm the chocolate is nice and melted :)

Great Recipe! I only used two eggs (as was recommended by the other reviewers), plus I substituted margarine for the butter, and added 1/2 cup of walnut peices. Really good, they didn't even last the night! Will definately be using this recipe again.

I made these brownies as is and also with the modifications the reviwers recommend (one less egg and no baking powder).  I also reduced the sugar to only 1 cup.  As is the brownies are cake-like, but taste very good.  I still much prefer the modified recipe, which creates more traditional brownies.

These really were great brownies!!! I also put in 3/4 cup cocoa but kept sugar same as original. I omitted one egg also (so 2 in brownies). Even better, I stirred in about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. SOOOO good!! Came out of pan perfectly - I will definitely make these again!

Loved these!  I ate half the pan by myself in the first couple of hours!  I changed a couple things, too, as I'm in a little higher altitude.  I omitted the baking powder, increased the temp by 25 degrees, and they only took 25 mins.

These are the best homemade brownies I have ever had.  I did make the changes suggested by the other reviewers and used 2 eggs, no baking powder, and an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa powder.  I only baked them for 40 min.  Next time I will add the chocolate chips and see how it turns out.

After trying probably 8 different brownnie recipes I finally hit the jackpot.  Fantastic, chewy and great taste.  My daughter said they taste as good as a box mix with I have to agree with.  I had just about given up until I made these.  Superb!  Didn't change anything.  What I also like is that there is enough batter in 1 batch that they are fairly thick.  No need to double, except if you don't want to run out!  Update:  The only thing I did different in the second batch was reduce the oven time by 25 degrees for the first 15 minutes.  It did help the brownies from getting too hard on the edges.

DO NOT MAKE THESE -- unless you can afford the calories because you will want to eat the whole batch the minute they come out of the oven. These are the best brownies EVER!

These are great and easy.  They are very soft and cake-like.  They were gone in a house of three in two days.  I might try putting chocolate chips in for fun but it doesn't need anything.  I will be making these again this weekend.

I would have given these 3 stars, but my family thought they were very good.  You need powdered sugar or frosting on these in my opinion.  My edges came out hard 5 full minutes before the timer was up.

I didn't think they were done enough when the timer went off ... I should have taken them out then. I burnt the edges :-( The middle was delicious!

These brownies are awesome! I took a huge risk in making this unknown recipe for a lot of people, and everyone liked them! Thanks for the awesome recipe! I will be sure to cook it again! Meanwhile, I am going to go finish off the leftovers...

Very good! Not how I picture a brownie but will definitely make again. I didn't make any alterations. Looks like they would be easy to overbake, I took mine out a couple minutes early.

This is really chocolatey and fudgy. Like others, I only added 2 eggs and omitted the baking powder. I also added 1/3 C of special dark chocolate chips and divided into the batter and also on top of it. Baked it no longer than 30 min and it came out purrrfect!. No burned edges or uncooked middle. I have to say that this one is A LOT BETTER than the "Best Brownies" recipe from this site. Okay I made it last night and followed the recipe exactly. With 3 eggs and the baking powder the texture is more cake like and a little bit drier. My husband seems to enjoy this one while I am more into the fudgy one that I made before. Anyway both are really good, just depends on how you like it.

These are wonderful! I also used 2 eggs and about 1/4 tsp baking powder. I baked them in an 11 x 7 pan because I was taking them to a function and needed more than an 8 x 8 pan would make. They were still plenty "deep" and turned out perfect. Everyone loved them. Thanks!

obnoxiously chocolate? isn't that an oxymoron? these brownies haven't come out of the oven yet, but i'm licking the bowl and they are GOOD. i used 2 eggs and no baking powder like other reviewers; also used dutch-process cocoa to make it EXTRA chocolately. cause let's face it, if you don't like chocolate, you don't like brownies.

These brownies were fantastic!  They looked more cake-like than the mixes you can get, but they were very moist and fudgy.  Will definitely make again, and almost as easy as out of the box!

These were OK, I even tweaked as other reviewers had mentioned. Tried again with recipe "as is" and still thought they were just OK. As they were very moist and baked well they were lagging in the chocolate"y" department. Maybe nect time I will add more cocoa than I did and more chips. I have to be honest I have tried many a brownie recipe and consider myself an experienced baker, this just didn't cut it for me. If you want an amazingly tasty and quite dreamy dessert, bake the "Zucchini Brownies" by Marian on this website!! Even if you are not a fan of zucchini you will be absolutely amazed by this recipe. I promise! Great texture, super moist and fudgy. I made them in an 8x8 pan and they were thick and scrumptious. Use a 13x9 for a thinner brownie...I Added choc. chips to top-You can't even tell there is a healthy treat inside...A must try for those who are searching for a decadent brownie!!

I prefer a Brownie made with melted unsweetened chocolate, as it just seems to have a different texture, but for a cocoa based brownie these were quite delicious

These were not as great as I expected.  I thought the top was a bit crunchy, but the inside was moist.However, I did take them to a cook-out and they were devoured within minutes! Maybe it was just me.

These are great. I now have 2 brownie recipes from this site that are standards in my kitchen (the other is the Best Brownies recipe). I like to add either a cup of semi-sweet choc chips or peanut butter chips to this recipe.  I've never had any problem with the texture, but I guess it depends on what you're used to/looking for. These rise during baking and stay somewhat airy after cooling. Definitely moist and delicious.

These brownies are awesome!  Very chewy, only change I made was using 1 tsp salt instead of 1/2.  Made it for a picnic and both adults and kids couldn't stop eating them.

These were great. Not cake-like at all...very thick and chewy. The only thing I would change is it needs about double the salt.

This has replaced my from scratch brownie recipe that I've used for years. My family loved them, the recipe was VERY simple. AND they are not too sweet like the box variety.

These arn't so bad. I've had better, though - the chocolate flavor is a bit too strong, and with all three eggs it's very dry. Two eggs improves the texture, but I've had better scratch brownies. Thanks for sharing.

I'll never buy the boxed stuff again. Takes about the same amount of time to prepare anyway. My hubby thought they were a bit rich with the chocolate chip addition, but I enjoyed them anyway.

Okay, the flavor got this a 5 stars. I think I must have messed something up along the way, because they were pretty mushy and fall apart even the next day. I will try these again and watch how I cook them, to try and get the whole to be like the edges. The edges were perfect. Husband gave them a 3 and said he thinks he likes box better.

Just made these last night and they were really yummy!! added choc chips and had them warm with ice cream. I think i left them in too long though because the edges became crunchy, i like it like that though. chewy and dense, thanks for sharing a great reciepe.

These were really, really good.  The only change I made were increasing cocoa powder to 2/3 cup and adding 1 cup chocolate chips.  Will make this recipe again!

YUMMY!!!!!! I added a little more cocoa than it called for, but these were great in a pinch! I think next time I will only use 2 eggs and probably add some chocolate chips. Very tasty! Thanks!!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used only 2 eggs.  I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter.  They were yummy!  Good basic brownie recipe.

I didn't change any of the ingredients, and they turned out perfect.  Yum!  Very fudgy, with a perfect brownie texture.  I only cooked them for 35 minutes, but my oven runs hot.

This description of "deep dish" certainly suits these brownies - these babies are big.  And it's a very simple recipe.  However, I found the flavor to be "just OK."  Nothing to rave about but definitely edible.

Very good for a quick treat.  Could be a bit moister.  Might be remedied with the addition of a bit of melted chocolate.

Good, but I prefer the ones made with real chocolate and the texture is a bit cakey.  But it's still a nice treat nonetheless.

Took a little longer to cook, but were worth the extra 10 minutes!  Seemed like there was too much batter, but came out great!  I put some packaged frosting on top after taking out of the oven and my husband loved them!  This is my new favorite brownie recipe!

Great!! The only changes I made were using two eggs instead of three and adding half a bag of chocolate chips. Delicious!

These brownies really are fabulous. I made them for Father's Day to go with our hot fudge brownie sundaes, and they were a big hit! I can finally stop looking for the perfect brownie recipe.

Great brownies.  I don't know if it was because of a previous message that said to watch the time or the recipe itself, but these turned out great.  The only alteration I made was to use 2 eggs.  After they were cool I sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  They are AWESOME.  I can't stop eating them.  I think what some people may not like about the flavor is that it is cocoa flavor not chocolate and there is a difference.  I am thinking of trying the chocolate chips because that sounds good.

The original recipe should probably be modified using other user's suggestions - I followed it exactly and wish I had increased the cocoa and slightly decreased the eggs and the butter.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips which made it much better.  I also used a 8x12 long pan; since the pan was dark metal I decreased the oven temp to 325 and cooked for 30 minutes - turned out just perfect.

I wanted to give it a 4, but I figured the little things that were not so good were my doing. I used a shallower dish, so I assume the heat came up quicker, and made it bubble too much, making it unsightly (well not unsightly, just not typical brownie like). Aside from that, the texture was awesome, just how I like brownies. I threw in some kahlua about 3-4 tablespoons and everything was great, it tasted wonderful. this recipe's a keeper, even if it doesn't look so pretty.

Very Very good. I have made this over and over again and it is the only brownies my picky daughter will eat. Update:  The last time I cut out 1 egg and didn't use baking powder as suggested by some here.   Well,  it came out greasy and flat.  Will stick to original recipe from now on.

YAY!  I just made these for my dad for father's day and he LOVED them.  I baked them a until the middle was just set so they would be fudgey rather than cakelike.  They are huge too, just like the name of the recipe suggests.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and then added a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. They were the best brownies my husband, his coworkers and I ever put in our mouths! This is a definite replacement for the prepackaged brownie mix! Thank you Biz!

These looked so simple, I decided to give it a try to take to a neighbor who had just come home from the hospital.  They WERE very simple; I mixed the entire thing by hand and only cooked for 30 minutes, as previous reviewers had suggested for a more chewy brownie.  I then frosted with a chocolate buttercream frosting.  They were very good, and the neighbor loved them!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Made these yesterday for dessert. I have tried many brownie recipes and never had much success. This one was the best. Texture was perfect. I ate about 5 pieces which totally messed up my plans of not eating any more junk food. I just could not resist. My 7 year old daughter gave it a 5 star also. Thanks for an easy and great tasting brownie, Biz.

Amazing brownies.  And very easy to make, especially because there are no fancy ingredients.  You really don't need to ice these because top is all crackled and gooey.

I followed the recipe to a T, and my boyfriend said they were the best he had ever had-moist and chewy.  The next time I substituted margarine for the butter and they weren't as good but they were good.  Still stayed moist.  Will use this recipe over and over. Thanks

These brownies turned out great. I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 eggs, no baking powder and chocolate chips. Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best brownies ever.  I just made the recipe from Cook's Illustrated and this recipe is even better.  I used only 2 eggs, but kept the amount of baking powder the same.  The brownies were dense, moist, and delicious.

Good flavor, but I thought they came out a little dry.  Maybe next time I'll add a tablespoon of oil to see if that helps.  These weer good with ice cream on top.

I love these brownies!  I have made them several times and everyone always loves them.  They are especially good when served as a dessert in a bowl with a scoop of vanilla and some chocolate syrup! mmmmm!  It feels so good to make brownies from scratch than from a bag, and they are so easy!

This brownies are too cake-like to my taste. Also the flavour isn't very good; I think I prefer to use real chocolate instead of cocoa powder in a brownie-recipe. I'll keep searching for a better recipe for me.

These were excellent, although not quite what I expected. The edges are rather crunchy, but the centre and bottom are wonderfully moist and chewy. I had them in the oven for about 40 minutes.  I'd make them again, but not before trying a few other recipes.

I, along with many others, have tested many different brownie recipes. This one finally had what I was looking for- fudgy and thick brownies with the glossy top and the taste is 10 times better than from a box! I also only use 2 eggs, omit the baking powder, and I use a tad less butter and sugar. Then I add peanut butter and milk chocolate chips for added flavor. Even my husband, who hates most desserts, will eat these gladly!

My husbands in the Army and I sent these with him on a training exercise that was supposed to last 2 weeks. They didn't even last the first night, once his buddies caught a wiff of chocolate it was all over. They were a hit, guess I'll have to send more next time.

The flavor of these were pretty good. I used a glass baking dish and ended up with hard edges and a way too gooey middle. I literally had to eat my brownie with a spoon, and it would hardly come off of it. The texture also wasn't what I had hoped for. I like a chewy browny, and I think I'll just stick to the recipe that I already had.

These were incredibly easy to make!  I tried these the fudgy way without the baking powder and 2 eggs as other reviewers had suggested. I tried one warm and it was really, really good..very thick and fudgy. I wanted to try one at room temp to get the max impact but unfortunately for me they did not last that long as my husband woke up and my son came home from school and they devoured them..guess that says it all! I will make these again regularly..thanks for sharing!

I'm reviewing this recipe again because, after testing it once, I doubled it and served it at my birthday party. I used only 4 eggs and substituted some of the butter with cream cheese. I think in this case the cocoa gets to be too much, so dark and intense. The result, anyway, was fantastic. All my friends wanted the recipe! Thanks for this one!

Yummy!!! I also used only 2 eggs and no baking powder. I added walnuts and I found that for me, the cook time was best at 40 minutes. BUT..I did bake it in a corningware dish, so that may have had alot to do with it because the brownies weren't spread as thin and the dish is thicker. But I just think you need to watch it the first time you make it and find out your perfect time.

I can't really say anything about these brownies that hasn't already been said...They're wonderful, I loved them!  I omitted one of the eggs as well as the baking powder as I (like many others) prefer a fudgy brownie.  They were oh so moist and chewy, and sinfully chocolaty.  I'll definately make these again.  Beware, these won't last long!

These were okay.  I too used only two eggs.  They were chewy in the middle, but "powdery/crumbly" on top.  I added more cocoa, but they still were not all that flavorful.  The "mmmm-mmmm better brownies" on this site are waaaay better if you looking for a soft, fudgy browny.

This is the first brownie recipe I've test tried as a low cholestrol recipe for my bf :) :) I substituted egg beater for real eggs, I can't believe it's butter for real butter, swirled in a few tablespoons of nonfat caramel and added some chocolate chips.  The result was great - Next time I might swirl in some more caramel after I pour in the mixture into the pan and also sprinkle some walnuts :) Now it's guiltfree sinfully good mmmmm :)

came out great! very simple and good.  if you do any baking you probably already have all the ingredients already in your pantry!  i did have a pouch of choco syrup (left over from a box of brownies that i used in a doctor'd recipe) so i tossed the syrup into the batter b4 i baked it.  the result was a sweet chewy crust!  this is a keeper!

Very good, very easy.  Just spinkle a little powdered sugar on top & you're ready to go!

This is such a yummy recipe!  I added toasted walnut pieces, but I'm sure it would be good without it too.  This is just as easy as a boxed mix, and much much tastier.  These are the best brownies I have ever had!
