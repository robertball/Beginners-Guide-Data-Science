A real no-fail lemony cream pie! Had to whip up half the filling cuz my pie plate doesn’t hold so much. Then I ran out of fresh lemon juice, so ended up using some Real Lemon too.  I went ahead and only added half the sweetner in pie crust, and I used sugar. (Made a whole recipe of the pie crust, tho’.) I added just teaspoon of sparkling water to crust & replaced half cup of almond flour with GF pancake mix. The crust is so flakey, but also sturdy enough to dish-up pie slces. Thank you for this amazing recipe!!!
