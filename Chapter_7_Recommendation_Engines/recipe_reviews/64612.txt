I am going to earmark this to serve during the holidays.  This is really a nice dish.  I used a lb. of fresh boiling onions which I braised for 20 min.  When the rest of dinner was almost ready I sauteed the onions in the butter and boullion until heated through and then added remaining ingredients.  The 1 lb. of onions only served the 2 of us.  This is easy and a keeper.
