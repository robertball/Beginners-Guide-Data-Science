1 simple change.... Do not make patties.  Change this to a "loose meat" burger and it's perfect.  Just saute the onions and bell pepper with the meat and mix the other ingredients in a separate bowl and once the meat is cooked, add the remaining ingrediants and simmer for about 5 minutes.

By using other viewer's suggestions of additional ingredients (honey, brown sugar)plus making this into a loose sloppy-joe type mixture made this recipe out of sight! My whole family loved it! Most of my kids wouldn't eat Manwich anymore so I was really hoping that they would like this. For 2 1/3 lbs. ground beef, I used 6-7 Tbsp ketchup, 3 Tbsp mustard, 1 1/2 Tbsp worcestershire, 2 Tbsp vinegar, 3 Tbsp honey, 3 Tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 cp finely chopped onion, 1/2 cp finely chopped green pepper. Seasoned with approx. 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and black pepper to taste. In skillet, brown hamburger and drain. In seperate bowl, mix all wet ingredients & brown sugar until blended. Put onion and gr. pepper in skillet, add mixture and drained hamburger and mix well. Heat on med-hi until hot (about 5 min) then turn down and simmer for about 20 min. Stir occasionally.

I used this recipe but made a few changes, first it was to cold outside to grill, so i boiled my ground beef and drained, then put it in a large saucepan with all other ingredients and made a loose bbq sandwich, it was'nt messy and boiling the beef gets rid of ALOT of the grease. Everyone loved it!

I tried this and had to make a few adjustments to taste. I had to cut back on the worcestershire to 1/2 a tbsp and then added 1 Tbsp honey,1 Tbsp brown sugar,and 1 1/2Tbsp prepared bbq sauce. It seemed dry to me so I added double everything except the meat. Very tasty!

I doubled the serving to 8 and used 2 lbs. ground beef. The flavor was great but the burgers were very crumbly and a bit hard to keep together on the grill. Overall I would recommend this recipe!

This recipe tasted good, but was a big mess in the end. They wouldn't stay together at all. We even tried to add eggs and bread crumbs. But I do have to say I will make it again but I won't even try to make a patty out of it.

YUCK!!! IF YOU MAKE THIS AS IT IS GIVEN YOU HAVE A MEAT SOUP! WE ADDED AN EXTRA POUND OF BEEF AND STILL ADDED CRACKER CRUMBS TO TRY AND THICKEN. NO DICE!! I THINK IF YOU CUT THE CATSUP DOWN AND ADD SOME SAUSAGE IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT MEATBALL BUT BURGERS, NO WAY!

I really liked the flavor and they were very juicy and easy to do but the hamburgers kept falling apart.  I added an egg to the mix and that seemed to help a little.

A little messy to make, it was almost too soupy for the burgers to hold together.  I think you need to cut back on ketchup, dice the onion instead of grating it.

Fit a quick, inexpensive meal to the tee!  I made this loose meat and changed it according to what I had on hand (no peppers so I omitted them altogether, red wine instead of white vinegar). I also took others' suggestions and added garlic, honey, and brown sugar along with a dash of garlic and onion seasoning, but I really don't think you could mess this one up.  It was very versatile.  It could easily be more sweet or more spicy according to your taste.  Thank you.  I'll definately be doing this one again.

Very tasty when served as a meat patty, however putting it on a bun with toppings wasn't so good.  My husband thought red bell pepper rather than green would improve the flavor.  I think this might be better baked into a meatloaf rather than grilled as a burger.

This burger was good as burgers go, I used dijon for the prepared mustard. I left out the green pepper (personal preference).  I added some Montreal Steak seasoning and some minced garlic because it seemed to be lacking a bit in terms of flavor.

I used ground turkey instead of beef, and left out the onion and bell pepper ( I would have included them if I had the ingredients). I used 1 tbs ketchup, 1 tbs yellow mustard, 1 tbs bbq sauce, 1 tbs worcestershire, 1 tbs brown sugar and a sprinkle of garlic and onion powder. The kids loved it. I also made it more like 'sloppy joes' instead of patties. I will make this again!!

I made the "loose meat" version as somebody suggested and added roughly one and a half times the recommended quantity of the condiments - it came out quite delicious! I would start by browning the onions for a bit on their own before adding the ground beef. I also added some Sriracha hot sauce in the end for a kick and added some chicken stock to give it a nice flavorful thin gravy.

After reading the reviews and how people said their patties fell apart, I decided to try this recipe as a meatloaf instead.  It too fell apart. My family wasn't crazy about the flavor.

I made these as loose hamburgers as other reviewers did.  I never really cared too much for sloppy joes, but this is a great alternative.  Both of my kids loved it, so I guess it's keeper!  Very quick and very easy!

Made as a loose burger (Manwich-style). Substituted soy sauce for worsh. Added garlic powder. Served to kids over rice. Served for myself over chopped, raw spinach. Even my picky eater cleaned her bowl!

Needs a little kick (probably would have come from the worch, but was out). Next time will add a little pepper or try doing with bbq sauce instead of ketchup. 

Otherwise, fast and so easy to do. Has been added to my recipe box!

This was really good and easy!  I made it as a loose meat sandwhich with ground turkey.  I found that I wanted to double the sauce but when I did that it was too vinegary so I ended up adding some honey and brown sugar.  Will definitely make again and again!

Took suggestions from others and made this as sloppy joes. My family loved it and oh-so easy! We used a red pepper, just our preference. Simple, fast and delicious! We all went back for seconds, which makes it 5 stars no matter how you cook it. Thanks!

I don't know. This just didn't turn out very well. My husband seemed to like it, but it wasn't really up to my tastes. Also, I did it loose meat, and it was really really dry.

I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before attempting to make patties for the grill.  I asked my husband if he knew how to make smoke signals! Ha!  Good flavor, but a mess to deal with in grilling. I'll use the recipe again, but try it as sloppy joes or meatloaf as suggested.  Thanks!
