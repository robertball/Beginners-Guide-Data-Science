It all is correct in ingrediants, per se; HOWEVER --- how it is assembled is incorrect and the result is dense.  They won't rise correctly and, if the originator does not have this problem, they need to look at these instructions and make corrections.

Firstly, the starter had too much flour and no sugar, which the yeast needs to activate.

Mine were edible, but lumpy looking and dense.  I shall return to my British cookbook next year.  Sad, really, as most of the recipes I have used on this site are cook-tested and do turn out, even if I don't prefer some of them.

I made these, with a few alterations, as a Christmas treat for an elderly gentleman who has been asking for something he remembers his mother making around the holidays in the early 1900s.  After much discussion and looking at pictures, we settled on this recipe.  (I really think he has his holidays confused, but it's ok with me if he's happy.).  I changed my method, proofing the yeast without the flour and adding ingredients liquids first, but I stayed with the paddle instead of switching to the dough hook.  I think I would have gotten a better rise if I had kneaded the dough. I also adjusted the spices, cutting the cloves to a scant 1/8 tsp and being a bit more generous with the nutmeg.  I skipped making the crosses and the sugar glaze and just used the icing to skim the tops.  Oh, and I found the buns I baked in my 9" square pan rose better than the 3 I baked individually on a sheet pan.  Nice recipe, I will play with it a bit and have it ready for Easter.  Thanks for sharing.

Followed the instructions, and they didn't rise and were too dense. Edible w/ lots of icing I guess.

Taste is very good. I made these as directed except for exchanging 1/2 of the currants for sultanas.  Like many, I had problems with rising. It took 3 hours for each rise to not quite double. I thought I'd "killed" my yeast until reading others had rising problems. The buns were still more dense than I would have liked. I will definitely make this recipe again but, proof the yeast with sugar and warmed milk.

I loved this a lot, and the only change I made was I didn't have any vanilla pudding so I used chocolate. Still great and I will definitely make it again!

We all loved these! they were UNBELIEVABLY delicious.  I made two changes: I used homemade candied lemon peel rather than mixed citrus peel and I dried dates instead of currants.  They did not rise a ton buth they were still light enough.  The spice is perfect and so wonderful.  Thank so much for a awesome recipe and new family tradition!

The flavor is great, but the texture is poor.  I wish I would have read other comments before I tried to proof the yeast.  The yeast mixture bubbled, but the dough barely rose.  My advice would be to follow the other raters suggestions and proof the yeast using another method!

These are very tasty. In fact, my mother said they were best hot cross buns she had ever had. I had some difficulty making them; I scrapped my first batch because the dough was really tough and didn't rise at all even though the yeast seemed to activate when I mixed it with the milk and flour. The flavour was nice though so I tried again. I activated the yeast only with the milk adding more flour as needed later. The second time I also mixed and kneaded by hand. The second batch turned out well.

They did not work out for me. Although I've never activated yeast like this before, I did heat the milk to 110. It seemed to work OK initially (the flour/yeast/milk did become active), but then the dough had trouble rising the first time and did not rise at all the second time before baking. Thus, I didn't get buns so much as compact little scones! I'll try it again with a different method for activating the yeast as the problem obviously lay somewhere with the yeast (which was brand new). I used raisins and candied mandarins which were very tasty but would've been much tastier if they turned out.

I found this to be a very tasty recipe and worth the time.  I did not have currants or candied citron, so I used dried cranberries and some orange zest instead.  I did not heat the milk to 110 degrees and instead used lukewarm milk with the yeast.  Next time, I will try the other way to see if there is any improvement. The buns came out nicely and it will be interesting to see if they last until Good Friday!  Thank you!

I made the dough in my usual manner, skipping the letting it rest for ten minutes after mixing.  This makes a wonderful bun, but the ground cloves was a little too aggressive for me, so next time Iâ€™d cut that by half.
