Terrific recipe! I made it once exactly as written and it came out beautifully. The second time, I rinsed the rice before cooking, which really didnâ€™t change the outcome. The grains stay separated and intact; fluffy, not mushy. The lime and cilantro are delicious. I doubled the recipe. I suggest reducing the liquid by 25 percent in that case.

Very tasty, but this can easily be made on the stovetop, and it (rice) comes out better.  I'm  not a huge fan of my instant pot.  I find it more trouble than it's worth, unless you need to quickly soften-up a tough cut of meat.

I have made this a couple of times. It turns out great in the instant pot.  I love cilantro,  so I add extra.
