I just enjoyed one of the most delicious pieces of toast I've ever had. The ginger and lemon were subtle but really added something special. I heeded the comment of another reviewer who wanted more lemon flavor so I added a few drops of lemon oil. Otherwise I followed the recipe using the dough setting on my bread machine and adding the crystallized ginger early in the first kneading process. Can't wait to try a PB&J on this yummy bread.

Delicious bread! This has been lost somewhere in the depths of the Allrecipes archives! Besides the method of preparing the only change I made was to add the zest of the lemon I used for the teaspoon of lemon juice. I don't have a bread maker so I did this the old fashioned way. I proofed the yeast in half the water with a little of the sugar. I mixed the dry ingredients with a cup of the flour and then I added that and the remaining ingredients to the yeast and mixed it well with my handmixer. I added the next cup of flour and mixed it with the mixer and then with the last cup of flour I kneaded that in by hand until it was smooth and elastic. I let it rest in the oven with only the light on for about half an hour. Now this next part is what I SHOULD have done! I should have rolled the dough out in a size that would fit the length of the 9x5 loaf pan but triple the width sprinkle over it the very finely cut crystallized ginger and push it into the dough and then fold it in thirds to put into the loaf pan to rise the final time. What I DID do didn't work well and that was to try to add the ginger to the ball of dough and then make it the size for the pan. The ginger didn't get well distributed. But no matter! It makes the BEST toast to have with morning coffee! Thank you for this recipe!

I do not use a bread machine. So I put the dry ingredients together then added the yeast proofed in the sugar and water. Mixed a bit then added the other wet ingredients. Kneaded until it was right and followed the rest of the recipe. It came out fantastic. Delicious flavor light as air great flavor soft as a feather pillow.
