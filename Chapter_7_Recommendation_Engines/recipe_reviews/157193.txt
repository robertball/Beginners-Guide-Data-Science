I'm giving this a 4 star with just one small change that I hope will bring it to a 5 star fot most people trying this delicious snak. I put the yams slices in a 1 gal. size ziplock bag and added the oil and shook the bag until evenly coated with oil. Then sprinkled on the salt and pepper after arranging on the cookie sheet. Also, for those trying to cut down on sodium, a sprinkle of salt substitute with any Mrs. Dash seaonings or similar "zero sodium" seasonings gives fantastic flavoring.

I really enjoyed this recipe. As one of those individuals who often times wants something simple and tasty without adding sugar or sweetener this is the perfect thing. I ended up using two yams and about a tablespoon extra oil and they turned out perfect! I ended up leaving them in the oven about 15 minutes longer as I like them extra soft and sweet. Not only healthy but also looks charming as an addition to any meal.

Absolutely love this recipe!  Delicious flavour.  Simple in-house ingredients (used coarse sea salt rather than kosher salt).  Quick to fix.  Have made it for my family and also for dinner guests.  It was a hit with all!

I have been making this for years. So easy, healthy and yummy! I usually leave the peels on cut the yams into one inch chunks. Then toss with olive oil and montreal steak seasoning (it has garlic and red pepper as well as salt and black pepper). Delish!

These are one of my favorite things.  I could eat them as a meal anytime.  I let them cook for at least 45 minutes - I like them well done, and oddly enough the little burnt pieces are the tastiest! Yummy!

Thank you for giving me a recipe that will FINALLY get my fiance to eat yams!! This recipe is fantastic because you can use whatever herbs and spices you'd like to spice it up! My personal favourite is 2 tsp Montreal Steak Seasoning, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp dried basil, 1/2 tsp dried dill, 1/2 tsp seasoning salt, 1/2 tsp pepper. I toss my yam slices in a mixing bowl with seasonings and oil, then spread flat on an oiled and tin-foil lined baking sheet. Bake at 350 F for 30 mins, flipping halfway through.

Nice & simple.  Loved it.  Pretty side dish and a great way to make yams without all the butter & sugar.  Definitely shake up your slices in a ziploc bag with the olive oil to make things even easier.  :)  These yams look gorgeous on a plate next to sauteed spinach and a steak.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious but I will reduce the salt next time. Easy to cook, easy to clean up. I also added some cayenne pepper.

This is a delicious, simple recipe. It's hearty, and looks lovely on a plate. I spiced it up a little by adding potato slices, and mixing in some minced garlic.

My mother is spending the weekend and I wanted to make something special that she had never had. I tried this as a side dish and it was great. I live alone and don't make good healthy meals for myself, I usually end up just making a PBJ but this is so simple and tasty I may add a chicken breast, turkey or fish. I think I would starve if not for Allrecipes. I have 59 recipes in my recipe box and making them all.

What a treat!  This was the first time I've ever tried bakeing a yam and was surprised just what a tasty treat they made.  After slicing, I put them in a bag with the olive oil so they would be coated evenly.  Highly recomended....

delicious!! An easy healthy way to prepare yams and a nice twist on a standard roasted potato. I sliced them a bit thinner and they cooked perfectly in just over 20 minutes

Absolutely wonderful!!  I don't like yams or sweet potatoes with sugar on them--they are sweet enough but most recipes are  'candied'.  I've experimented with different seasonings and all have been amazing!  This is the best recipe I've ever found for yams and/or sweet potatoes!!

I love how versatile this recipe is! I have made it exactly as the recipe state and with a million variations. I've added basil, dill, Montreal steak seasoning, Emril's essence... pretty much anything I can find in my spice rack I'll add it. It so simple but so amazing!

So very easy.  I made it even easier by simply tossing the slices, oil and seasonings together in a big bowl until evenly coated.  I will definitely make these again.

Delicious! I used two large yams but kept the EVOO at 2 tbsp and it was perfect. I shook it up in a ziploc like other reviewers recommended and then seasoned with S&P. It would be great with other seasonings, too! And, I think the calorie count on here is off. I put it into My Fitness Pal's calorie counter and it came back with 138 cal and 7.1 g of fat for a quarter of the recipe.

These were delicious! They took a little longer to get soft, and I did add garlic powder and a little bit of grated Reggiano parmesan. Perfect addition to Thanksgiving!

I normally do not eat Yams, but I thought I would give this a try since they are more healthier  than potatoes.  I listened to the other reviewers and used a freezer bag to coat the yams with EVOO.  I did add some minced garlic and they turned out perfect with the exception that everyone thought they were too salty.  Next time I will cut down the salt.  Thanks for the recipe.  We are now YAM fans!

Great, easy recipe!  For some reason I thought I could get by without flipping the yammies, but I learned when I took them out of the oven and flipped them onto my plate that yes, indeed, in the future I need to flip them halfway through baking.  It would be really easy to dress this recipe up, which makes it so great.

FANTABULOUS! I wanted something other than mashed yams to go with dinner tonight, and these were perfect! The only thing I did different was to use a ziploc bag to evenly coat the yams. These were an amazing side dish for dinner. (seared pork chops with plum sauce and green beans) My husband loved these! Thank you!!

This is not the best recipe of its kind that I've tried but I did like that the flavour was simple so you could serve it with almost anything. I would make this recipe again if I needed a side for a dish that's hard to compliment.

I wanted something different than sweet potatoes again. I have a 2 yr old and 5 yr old who wouldn't stop eating these! My husband and 15 yr old loved them too. They are easy and wonderful tasting! This is going to become a new family favorite.

Great way to add a little fun to your meal!  I've made these exactly as stated, and I've also spiced them up a bit with various seasonings - garlic, seasoned salt, spinach & herb, etc.  This is one that you can really have fun with!  Thanks for sharing!

Even my 2.5 year old liked this! We got some yams in a produce box delivery that I had no idea what  to do with, but I will make this again if the opportunity presents itself. 1 large yam made a decent side dish for my family of four with two young children.
I tossed 3/8" slices with EVOO I'd heated with a smashed garlic clove, plus salt, pepper and a dash of smoked paprika, in a 1 gal Ziploc per others' suggestion. 40 mins at 350 did it for my thicker slices. I served drizzle with honey, but would also try adding dabs of goat cheese during baking and perhaps then top with arugula.

We prepared the yams as described but they took more than twice as long to roast in the oven so were not ready with the rest of the meal. They were delicious - I will just allow more time or pre-cook next time.

I agree that this was easy to prepare and tasty. As suggested by another reviewer, I used a plastic bag to coat the slices with olive oil. I also added some minced garlic and soy sauce with the salt and pepper. I will definitely make this again!

Not a huge fan of this. I thought it would be crunchier but came out more like a cooked squash texture. Seasoning was good just not for me

Really enjoyed these. suggest tossing the yams in the olive oil rather than drizzling...as mine stuck to the foil. My hubby liked them too...he doesn't like anything sweet in his dinner...so was suspect...but no maple syrup or marshmallows in this one, and he really liked it!

I cut them a bit thinner. My hubby and kids - even the fussy 9 yr old - liked them. Me, not so much, but they were edible. Will slice thicker next time. Worth making again sinve 3/4 of the fam enjoyed them.

I absolutely loved this recipe and so did my family... especially my dad. He’s a picky eater. I followed the cooking instructions to the letter; however, I deviated from the seasonings. I brushed the potatoes with butter and seasoned them with cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar. It was delicious!!!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe

I love the idea of cutting them into 1/4 slices. I sprayed my glass 9X13 dish with Pam and baked them without having to use tin foil. SO delicious. An easy and fast way to do sweet potatoes.

I added 1 teaspoonful of chili powder to make it a bit more spicy. Good. I will try it again to find my perfect combo. I am looking for more of a savory flavor...

I love this recipe and just eat it as the entrée.  One difference I use is coconut oil.  What a difference in taste and coconut oil is also very healthy in moderation.

Yes very nice but if you like garlic, add a little garlic powder and I use coconut oil, that is healthy and can take more heat.

I will use less salt next time and maybe add a pinch of brown sugar. But how nice to have an easy recipe for yams!

These were great & easy. I thought it would be too much pepper but it was great.
