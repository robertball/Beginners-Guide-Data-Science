I've made this before (from another recipe) with two additions that make it awesome - a can of drained corn and sliced black olives.  The sweetness of the corn is a nice contrast to the salsa.

I used a fresh fire roasted salsa that leaked through the cheese and made the crust soggy. Should have drained off some of the liquid. I recommend a Mexcian cheese blend over just the cheddar. I added corn and black beans, which made for a colorful pizza. We love pizza and love Mexican food so this was a happy medium for us.

My family loves this. First time I used it I made it as written. Made it tonight for my daughter's birthday and used taco cheese ad some leftover grilled chicken. A success both ways.

I tweaked this recipe just a bit to use what I had on hand and to make it a little tastier. I cut corners a bit and used one canister of crescent roll dough instead of pizza crust dough. I just baked the dough beforehand and let it cool. To make a creamier "sauce", I mixed the salsa with half of an 8 oz. package of cream cheese as well as a half batch of taco seasoning. I just spread that on the cooled dough, then sprinkled with the cubed chicken and sprinkled it with the cheese. I only needed about half the cheese. What was great about this recipe is that I could make this a cold pizza. I assembled it this morning and let it set in the fridge all day so it would be ready at dinnertime and I wouldn't have to cook during the hottest time of the day. This was really good and bent well to small changes to make it more personal. I'll make this again with my changes.

Tasty pizza!  My family enjoyed. I'd use less salsa as a topping, but that's just my taste. This came out great :)

I'd give it 5 stars because I promised to make a meal for my fiance' and our guests and being the guy that I am I waited til the last minute! This dish took only 20 mins plus everyone loved it. So this dish definitely saved me! I made it quite a few times since then. Use your imagination you can add pretty much anything you like to it. I cooked the chicken in a skillet in strips. Then I slice the chicken as thin as I could get it. After that simply pick your favorite salsa and cheese. This is a dish even a guy can't mess up!

Quick and easy, the family loved it. I used my own homemade salsa and I also used a Mexican blend of shredded  cheese. Serving again for dinner tonight!

Yummy, used hot salsa and drizzled with ranch dressing after pulling out of the oven.

This was very good however I could only eat so much. My husband loved it and finished the whole thing. One change I made which I probably wouldn't suggest was I ground the salsa in the blender because I don't like the chunks but the crust got very soggy and I think it was because of this. Next time I might try using taco sauce instead of salsa. I use that to make Taco Pizza and it turns out great.

Unfortunately, this pizza didn't go over well with my husband.  I didn't think it was too bad and neither did my eleven month old daughter who had a few bites.  I added some corn and olives and used a Mexican cheese blend.

Needed a fast and easy prep - this was perfect!  I used my own pizza dough instead of the prebaked crust, and tossed the cubes of chicken with some homemade taco seasoning for extra flavor.  Added some mushrooms and sliced zucchini for vegetables.  Surprisingly good!  Nice change from the usual for us.

This is a keeper for sure!  I make pizza at least once a week, sometimes more and am always looking for something new.  I made my own dough using Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day Olive Oil Dough recipe.  I added about 1 T of finely chopped red onion to jazz it up a little, and fresh cilantro when it came out of the oven.  Next time I would like to substitute chives for the red onion and saute the chicken in cumin, coriander, and garlic.  I love the simplicity of this meal and my kids gobbled it up.

Very good. A nice, easy, and delicious twist on a pizzza.  I used Bread Machine Pizza Dough instead of a prebaked crust, so I baked the dough by itself for about 15 minutes, then added these toppings.  I drained my salsa as I didn't want the pizza soggy and it worked just fine.  Very nice dinner to use up some of the salsa we have.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe.  Used my own crust and instead of cheddar (which kind of tastes a little wrong with salsa) I used pepper jack.  With my changes, it's a 5, without them - only 4.

Talk about very simple to make! This was my sisters favorite on Pizza night. This would have been my hubby's favorite, but I didn't use his favorite brand of salsa (how dare I...lol). I will definately make this again

turned out good. I made my own crust, baked the crust first (12 minutes). After I took it out of the oven I then added the salsa, cooked chicken, and cheese. Then baked 12-15 minutes more until the cheese was hot and melted.

This was a big hit, I substituted the store bought crust with dough from Publix's bakery and some fresh salsa from there as well.  As far as cooking it I highly suggest getting a pizza stone, it makes the crust come out perfect.  If you do get a stone and don't have a pizza peel (board to slide pizza on to the stone) you can just (very carefully) take the stone out of the oven on to a stone holder and assemble the pizza directly on the stone.

Tasty!! I've made this in a pinch as I usually have the ingredients on hand.
