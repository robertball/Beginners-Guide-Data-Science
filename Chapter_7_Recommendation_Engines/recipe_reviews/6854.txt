Look no further-if I could give this a 10, I would!  But please do this: double the lemon zest and add 1/4 c. brown sugar.  I bake these for a local farm and art market, they go fast!  Yum!

We loved this muffin recipe! They didn't last long! I used frozen blueberries and they came out really nicely. Will definitely make these again! Thank you!

Quick and simple to mix up, these are beautiful muffins, plump and rounded with a delicate, light golden streusel top. They're moist and delicious with just a hint of fresh lemon that complements the blueberries well. For those who believe these to be bland or tasteless, muffins are by their nature not as rich or sweet as cakes, or muffins described as muffins but really ARE cakes.  This is a perfect blueberry MUFFIN recipe!

These were fabulous--even with my healthier changes!

I used whole wheat flour, half splenda and half white sugar, egg substitute, and apple sauce in place of the butter.  I added 1/2 cup more blueberries and used half brown and half white sugars in the crumble on top.  These are amazing--we can't keep ourselves away!!

Thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe is great!!! Really tasty. I substituted brown sugar for the white in the streusel topping and added 1/4 tsp vanilla to it too. I also put 2 cups of blueberries into the muffins instead of 1 1/2. The muffins turned out wonderful, really moist and delicious.

Eh. Lots of extra work for average muffins, in my opinion. I think the muffins would come out nicer if you just add the milk to the butter mixture and then add the flour mixture all at once; the way the recipe is written, it's difficult to NOT overwork the batter. I probably won't try it again, though; it just wasn't anything exciting. Nice, predictable, okay muffins. Frankly, I liked the batter more than the muffins. And just in case you're considering it: These do NOT ship well. I baked them, let them cool, and shipped them two-day express all in the same day, and they were rancid when they arrived.

This is a really great muffin. People love the topping which makes it sweet enough. I think it needs more lemon zest or lemon juice. Orange extract also gives it good additional flavor.
To make large muffins increase bake time to 40-45min.

Great blueberry muffins, even though I left out the lemon zest.  The topping was wonderful, next time I'll use brown sugar instead of white as other reviewers have suggested.  I made a few without the topping and they turned out great as well.  These muffins are filled with blueberries and have a nice consistency.

i added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the mix, used 2 cups frozen blueberries and replaced lemon zest w 1/2 tsp of orange zest.  i had half a bag of apple crisp & fruit topping mix from country gourmet sitting in my pantry so i used that in place of the  streusel topping. they were great!

Okay, so I followed this recipe exact. I made no changes or substitutions. (I'm one of those people who think that most blueberry muffins should be kept as is, not lightened or made healthier.) At 350*, my muffins were done at almost 22 minutes. My one issue with this muffin is my streusel went everywhere. It ran down the muffins, onto the muffin pan and the bottom of my muffins. The flavor of these muffins was very good but the streusel part just.......we'll.......it irked me. I don't know WHY it did that, but it did. I'd make these muffins again but I'd use a different topping or omit the topping all together. The flavor and texture of these muffins is wonderful--one of the best blueberry muffins I've ever had.

Perfect!!!! They were amazingly perfect . . . well after I used some of the other reviewers tips. I used frozen blueberries, orange zest (and I doubled it). I also added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the mix. I mixed the milk (2%) in with the wet ingriedents. I also used 2 1/2 tbs white sugar and 2 1/2 tbs brown sugar for the streusel. I spayed the entire muffin pan with cooking spray and they came out "Magazine Perfect." Starbucks Blueberry muffins no longer have a fan!!

My five year old helped me make these and we had a lot of fun.  She decided that instead of the streusel topping they needed to have sprinkles.  I gave her some artistic leeway and we now have some very colorful and very tasty muffins in our house!  Since we didn't use the streusel I put the cinnamon in the batter.  Can't wait to try them with the topping next time!

Delicious, and they pack and travel well too! For the topping, I used a mixture of brown and white sugar. I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of some of the all-purpose and the muffins were still very light and fluffy. Love these!

Superb muffin here! I prepared this recipe with minor changes based on what I had in the house.  Foremost was that I didn't have milk, but had some half n half.  I used 1/2 cup of that.  Also, in the streusel topping, I used 3 T raw sugar crystals with 2 T table sugar (in place of 5 T sugar)...just cuz I've done it before and love the lil crunch it gives.  For my blueberries, I used 1 cup frozen.  I put them on a plate for a bit and they got sweaty on the outside.  Then I put them in a paper lunch bag with 2 T flour, gently tossed and poured back onto the plate.  When it was time to add them to the very thick batter, I was VERY careful to not grab any extra flour and ever so carefully foldeded them in.  Turned out the 1 cup of berries was too much, so the few that remained on the plate I just poked into the top of each muffin (very pretty).  Topped with streudel, baked at 375 for 17 min exactly, cooled in pan about 10 minutes and they came out lovely (I never use papers).  The key to successful muffins truly is preparation; never over mix, room temp ingredients, etc.  Flour coating the berries is important, they didn't turn my batter blue at all!!  They were perfect! and for this recipe, the lemon zest is da bomb!  Enjoy!  (might add a scrape or two of fresh nutmeg next time??)

Sweet and moist with a tender crumb.  I didn't change the muffin recipe a bit.  As other reviewers have suggested, the batter seemed thick...but they turned out perfect.  I left off the streusel and simply sprinkled with turbinado sugar.  Sweet crunchy topping with much less work.  These are great muffins!

This is a very delicious muffin. My family loved them. I followed the recipe exact except I used 1 tsp lemon juice for the zest. Next time I will double the topping.

Excellent recipe!  I added a generous amount of lemon extract, in addition to the vanilla, a cup extra blueberries (I had some frozen ones we had picked fresh this last summer, let them thaw over-night) and I opted for the brown sugar streusel
***since there wasn't a mention as to how full the muffin cup should be (and some batters differ) I will tell you that 3/4 full is NOT full enough. Heap it in.***

These muffins are quite a bit heavier than I'd have liked.   This is the second recipe that I've tried that called for creaming the butter and sugar...both came out heavy like pound cake.   Will probably try again and melt the butter and see if that makes any difference.

My son raved over these muffins! As usual, I used half whole wheat flour and half unbleached flour, and the muffins were quite moist. A good way to use those fresh blueberries that recently appeared in the grocery!

Excellent recipe! I just made them and they rose beautifully. I also didn't use muffin cups and instead oiled the muffin pan and they came out very easily, no sticking whatsoever. Instead of just plain milk, I used "buttermilk" by mixing 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and 1/2 cup of milk and leaving it for 5 minutes, and I used frozen instead of fresh blueberries ( either work great ). I didn't add the topping because I didn't have any cinnamon on hand, but they were still wonderful. Not too sweet, just perfect. Thanks for sharing!

These are the BEST muffins I've ever had! I could eat the entire pan. I tried this and another recipe on this site and the others didn't even come close. I think it's the lemon zest that seals the deal (I used twice than what's called for).  I doubled the topping and used half brown sugar half white sugar but other than that made them as written. YUMMERS!

I didn't use the lemon zest or topping (my husband wouldn't eat them if I did).  They were good & I'll make them again, but I'm still looking for the ultimate muffin recipe.  I assume they are better with the lemon & topping.

Made 2 different blueberry muffin recipes for this web site for a volunteer day, these were gone first!! People loved the hint of lemon with the blueberries and the topping. Definitely a keeper!! Will add a bit more lemon zest next time i think.

This was very easy to make.  I used frozen blueberries as I didn't have fresh.  I also used a little extra lemon zest.  These are great.  My husband says "excellent"

Just made these for brunch this morning since my daughter wanted something with blueberries.  I just mixed all the wet ingredients and added the dry all at once, used frozen blueberries, and brown sugar in the crumb topping instead of white.  Delicious for a quick muffin recipe.  Some of the batter did turn purple, but there's nothing that can be done to change that when using frozen berries.  I'll definitely make these more often, and the sugar could probably be reduced a bit without much change in taste if you're trying to cut down.  ( I added slightly less and they were plenty sweet, so I may cut more next time.)

Was looking for a recipe for blueberry almond muffins and when I couldn't find one, decided to adapt this one. It worked out great; just subbed almond extract for the vanilla and left the cinnamon out of the topping, adding sliced almonds instead. The muffins were delicious; the almond and lemon flavors really compliment each other, and the muffin itself was moist, just sweet enough and delicious!

These muffins are great!  Just follow the directions:)  So far this is the best recipe I've found.  Just one thing to add.  When making the struesel put a little vanilla in it and it will be even more amazing.  Family and friends love it.  Remember to put lots of love or it won't taste as good.

Very good,  I used brown sugar instead of the white sugar on the topping.  also double the topping because we like lots of crumbs, I waited till the llast 10 mins. Of the muffins in oven then I added the crumb topping to it would be crunchy and not over cooked.yummy. its a keeper.

I followed the recipe and changed a few things. Since I love lemon, I added about 3 tablespoons of zest. I also added a splash of orange juice to the recipe to give a little more zing. The outcome was PERFECT! My husband ate 4 muffins for breakfast! I'm never going to buy box mix for muffins again! 

Thank you Heather!

The recipe worked out pretty good.  They were easy to make and turned out okay.  I was a little disappointed though.  These muffins were not as moist as I usually prefer.  I did not make any changes.  The strusel topping was good.

I thought the streusel would be a crunchy crumble but it turned out more like a sugar coating & I think that's what made the pool of butter between the foil liner & the pan.

I've made this recipe exactly before and they are great! However I wanted to try a healthier version. Instead of using the 1/2C butter in the batter, I used 1/2C Natural applesauce. Worked great! I still used the butter in the crumb topping though. It cuts about 130+ calories out!!

These are the BEST muffins I've ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT added almost a TABLESPOON of ORANGE ZEST and used half brown, half white sugar as another person had suggested. Also added 2 cups of blueberries.  I thought I was doing the streusel part wrong, it wasn't very crumbly, but it tastes wonderful.  The prep is a bit much, but really worth it.  Will definitely make again and again.  My husband is on his 3rd one already.  This may not be good!  :-)

By far the best muffins I have ever tasted!  They are so moist and light.  I used frozen wild blueberries and floured them before adding to the batter to keep them from sinking to the bottom.  Don't over mix the batter.

I love making these! I like going overboard on blueberries--about 1-3/4 cups, and I always replace the white sugar with brown. Also, I've found no issues with adding all the dry ingredients and milk to the creamed sugar/butter at the same time. I used to make these with the streusel, and no lemon zest, but now I make them w/o streusel to cut back on sugar, and I discovered jarred dry lemon peel.

These came out fairly well.  I did cut the recipe in half, because I was short on blueberries for a full recipe and I also used half lemon and half vanilla extracts to up the lemon flavor a bit.  The taste was great, but the batter was very thick, and even after adding a bit of extra milk, it was still tough to get these to 'fall' into the muffin cups.  They did bake up light, not a dense muffin, but I still think I would play with the consistency of these, although the flavor was spot on!  Thanks for a tasty muffin treat!

MMM Perfection!  I subbed 1/2 a cup of the white flour for whole wheat and didn't have a lemon on hand so used orange zest (closer to two tbs. worth) and a splash of lemon juice instead.  The result was fresh and not too sweet.  I was a bit alarmed when mixing the batter - it was far more solid than muffin batter usually is - but resist the temptation to add more milk - the texture was divine.  Overall - lovely, easy recipe, thanks!

Very good. I substituted soy milk for dairy milk, and tangelo zest instead of lemon. I also dumped the dry ingredients and milk all at once, and then mixed a little; that's the way my mom taught me to make muffins, thrown everything in and then mix until it's almost all wet. Leave some dry parts. They crowned well and are SO good!

I've been searching for "the" blueberry muffin recipe and this is it!  I did not use lemon as I think it drowns out the vanilla flavor and I added chopped walnuts to the topping.  Scrumptious!!!

I used "canned blueberries", I know...I know...it may have changed the integrity of the batter because of course, the batter was bluer than they would have been with fresh or frozen but I'm giving the recipe 5 stars because even with the canned blueberries, I really liked them.

These are fine muffins! I made them with my 6 year old niece. It's a great recipe to make with kids because each step is easy to follow and they are delicious, so it's very rewarding!They rise well, and are moist with good flavor. Addendum 9/5/2009 Just made these again using whole wheat flour and fresh cherries. Still wonderful.

Wow! These were the best blueberry muffins ever!  My blueberry bushes are overwhelming me and we are tired of pies, cheesecakes, etc. so I tried this muffin recipe.  Only made 2 small adjustments.  Used half butter and half Smart Balance and added about half cup of chopped pecans.  The recipe made more than 12 Large muffins....maybe because I loaded them with huge blueberries?  YUM  will make these again.

I read through the reviews and it seems there was a common theme that some people thought these were too bland. I used 1/2 tsp lemon zest, and I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar to the batter. I think they came out very well, and I don't feel that the batter turned out bland at all. I will be making these again in the future.

This recipe is so simple yet soooo good.  I used 3 egg whites instead of 2 eggs and I used 1/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 butter instead of 1/2 cup butter.

Really great!

The batter was so thick, I could hardly get them in the muffin tin.  I agree that this batter is on the tasteless side, however I found them to be good.  Next time I will make more streusel topping and layer it in between the batter.  I'm still undecided as to what to add to this batter to make it shine.

This were wonderful muffins! The lemon zest and streusel topping are great additions to these blueberry muffins. Just enough extra flavor to make these muffins stand out. I also made the "Best of the Best Blueberry Muffins (from this site) to see which I liked better. They were good, but just didn't look or taste quite as good as these. This recipe is going into my permanent recipe box!

These were YUMMY. :) My 16 month old gobbled one down. I didn't have any lemon to zest but I'm sure that would have made them even better. I didn't alter the recipe at all except instead of 5 tablespoons of white sugar for the topping, I did 3 white and 2 brown.

This is one of our favorite blueberry muffin recipes because we prefer the use of butter rather than oil. This method gives more of a cake like muffin, keep well and do not dry out.  Also, which is a pleasant change, they are not oversweet.  Agree with the reviewer that suggested extra lemon zest......better with blueberries for our taste than vanilla.  No changes or substitutions necessary in this recipe. Thanks for a reliable recipe that always receives compliments.

this recipe was amazing! i would recommend baking for 20 minutes and then taking them out, i found that when i did them for 25 they were a little dry. what i also did was squeeze a little lemon juice into the batter(when adding lemon zest), added 1-2 tablespoon(s) of maple syrup, and substituted butter for vegetable shortening and eggs for applesauce! super moist and super delicious. try it!

They tasted good but next time I'm going to use 'I can't believe its not butter' just to make it a little richer.
The streusel was perfect!

This recipe is great! These are the best blueberry muffins that I have ever made and tasted! I made a few minor alterations: 3/4 c. heavy cream and a splash of milk in place of milk, and a few spoonfuls of 2% greek yogurt. I also used lemon juice in place of lemon zest. This will be my blueberry muffin recipe from now on.

Excellent! They're soft and just the right amount of sweet. My only complaint is that the streusel turns out a little bit too thin for my tastes. It's more grainy than crumbly. I think I'll add a little more butter to the streusel next time. But that doesn't affect the flavor, which is flawless!  Blueberry + vanilla + lemon = heaven!

These were worth all the effort!  I used a suggestion made previously and made the topping using brown sugar instead of white sugar and it made all the difference!  Also the lemon zest added a great kick!

Very good muffins as far as taste goes and the recipe worked beautifully so 4 stars for that.  I would give 3 stars (based on personal preference) because it is still not the moist, dense muffins I am looking for.   These are a step above the corn muffin texture I am frequently finding but not quite what we are aiming for.  Only changes made were substituting soy milk for the dairy.

REALLY REALLY good!

Light and delicate muffin with a good texture and flavor.  Batter starts out thicker than you might expect, and it doesn't rise much - so feel free to fill the muffin cups to the top.  I exchanged white sugar for dark brown in the struessel topping, delicious.

I was very satisfied with this recipe! I did not have enough butter to do the struesel topping, so I put some brown sugar on them before baking and it was delicious. The sugar gave a nice extra hint of sweetness and a little crunch on top. I did not put in the lemon zest  and used fresh berries and they still had a nice bright taste to them.

I'm making these muffins AGAIN--by request, they never last!  They are that good!

These muffins were gobbled up within minutes!
I followed Mrs. Houston's suggestions--doubling lemon zest and adding 1/4 c brown sugar.  You may want to double the recipe...so you have some left for the next day!

Wow - these were excellent!  I didn't change a thing except to sub lemon juice for the zest (since that's all I had) and they were great.  I usually try three or four versions of a recipe to find "the one" that we like best, but this is it - I won't need to try another blueberry muffin recipe.  Yay!

I make these all the time, with frozen and fresh blueberries, and they are gone within the next three days. Very nice consistency and flavor, but i sometimes find the batter needs more milk than is called for. Besides that a great muffin recipe.

Muffins turned out very good.  I wouldn't call them my best ever, but definitely would make them again.  The streusel, however, I've made twice, exactly as described, and end up with a gooey sticky mess on top of the muffin.  It tastes good, but but it's ugly.  Not like the picture here next to the recipe.  From now on I'll use my own streusel recipe or leave it off.

Made about 4 dozen mini muffins - I kept adding flour and the sugar mix until it was like course crumbs because it was too thick and pasty at first but I'm glad I did keep working with it - there was enough for all the mini muffins. I used frozen blueberries and the four mix but they sat for a while until I mixed them up and the flour was negated. The batter still turned grayish purple! Oh well! Added lemon juice instead of lemon zest (just a generous splash). These were worth the effort, thanks!

These are delicious! I used a mix of brown sugar/white sugar and wheat/white flour to change it up a bit. We had some strawberries near end of life, so I tossed them in as well. Used orange zest instead of lemon. Would also recommend drizzling with some milk/powdered sugar glaze.

I used almond extract instead of vanilla and doubled the lemon zest amount. Delicious. A big hit at home. Verified by my personal taste tester!

I've been looking for a staple blueberry muffin recipe. This one's a keeper. The lemon zest really adds a nice flavor and the flour on the blueberries is a neat trick! Perfect amount of steusel, it balances well with the muffin batter, which isn't overly sweet. I wouldn't change a thing.

These are good. Not real pretty and kind of messy with the steusel. Not sure if I like the streusel topping, but that is just a preference of mine.

These muffins turned out great! The dietitian in me could not resist making a few changes: 1. Used whole wheat white flour, 2. used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup no sugar added apple sauce, 3. used 2 cups wild blueberries, 4. took others advice and put 2-3 times the lemon zest. My husband LOVED them. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

AMAZING! TO DIE FOR! These were amazing muffins! They look great - and taste wonderful.  Made these at my mother's house and she said they were the best blueberry muffins she has ever had.  Easy recipe - fantastic results! (I added extra blueberries...)

My son requested Blueberry muffins. I didn't have enough paper cups, so I dumped the batter into an oval  corning ware dish. I doubled the topping and it took an hour to cook. It turned out great. A light and tender coffee  cake. Thank You for a keeper

So good, they do take some time though. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar for topping, and pressed a little into batter so it wouldn't fall off the top like others stated. Hubby loved.

These turned out amazing! They are extremely moist with just the perfect amount of sweetness. The streusel topping created a lovely crisp top. They are quite rich though; no dry, diet muffin here. I did take the advice of other reviews and just added the milk in with the wet ingredients and it was much easier to not overwork the batter.

I thought I had the ultimate blueberry muffin recipe in my box until I tried this one.  I followed the recipe but for 2 things: I put my streusel together before I mixed my wet and dry ingredients so the muffins wouldn't be sitting there before I popped them in the oven, and  I added 3/4 teaspoon lemon extract.  I'm slightly ashamed to say that I ate 6 of the 12 muffins I made for my family, but I don't regret it!  They really are outstanding.    One great point...this recipe made exactly enough batter for 12 muffins.  So often, I have enough for 11, or for 14, but this was just right.  Thank you for a great recipe!

These were good.  The batter is pretty thick, since it uses butter instead of oil. So, while it was tempting to add a little extra milk to thin it, I didn't. There was too much batter- the recipe didn't specify how full to fill the muffin  cups, I filled the cups too full of batter and most of the streusel topping slid off onto the  the muffin pan. Next time I will only fill them 1/2 way before putting on the streusel. This recipe could really make 18 muffins, or more, especially if you add extra berries.   I'll try it again.

These were fabulous!!!  They were pretty easy to make, and tasted delicious!  The streusel was out of this world!  My only very minor complaints are that the streusel stuck to the cupcake wrapper, and my blueberries got really mushy in baking and the muffins got a tad soggy.  But nevertheless, these muffins tasted great and didn't last long in my house!

Love these!  The recipe doesn't specify what percent milk to use, and I only had 1% which worked well.  I also didn't have a lemon on hand so I used orange zest which turned out very nicely.  And since I can't get enough fruit, ever, I used a full 2 cups (the entire carton) of blueberries.  Yum!

These overflowed a little into the bottom of my oven. I couldn't figure out what happened to the topping until my husband cut one open to butter it. The muffins had pockets of hot cinnamon at the bottom- they were upside down!! The topping fell through somehow...

This is a great recipe!  Perfect for an ex-patriot craving a little bit of home. These came out just like the muffins I used to get at my favorite coffee shop in my hometown.  The only thing I did was add a little extra lemon zest and a tiny bit of lemon juice to the muffin batter and I doubled the flour called for the streusel to make it easier to crumble.

Turned out great!! I used applesauce in place of butter (or oil), and honey in place of white sugar. And didn't really split up the mixtures...just added the wet ingredients to the dry and and added blueberries and mixed!...Much easier and turned out fantastic!

Delicous!  Just made these this morning and they were a great success.  I did add some extra milk to the batter and substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping.  Also I used frozen blueberries.  Can't wait to try this one again.

I halved the recipe. Took other reviewers advice and used brown sugar in the streusel mixture, and frozen blueberries.  The batter did seem a little thick, but the end result was delicious. The topping gives these muffins a sweet crunch.

Wow!  What a great recipe!  I usually keep frozen blueberries in the house and found this recipe this morning when searching for a good muffin recipe.  They were very easy to make and the results were very yummy, moist muffins.  I read some of the previous reviews and will be inspired to try different add-ins to this recipe (banannas, etc).  Definitely try this one - you'll be glad you did!

The muffins were delicious and my family of 6 thinks they could live off of them.  The only changes we made were, when it called for white sugar we used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  In the topping we used 2 TBSP brown sugar and 3 TBSP white sugar.  They were very good.  The lemon zest made the muffins have a very unique taste.  YUMMY will make again as soon as I get 2 cups of FRESH blueberries again. THANKS for sharing this recipe.

I am usually a boxed muffin kind of girl but this morning I really wanted to make blueberry muffins and I didn't have a box.  I am always nervous to try a muffin recipe because in the past they have never turned out great.  This recipe did, though.  The lemon really does add something to it- I used 1/2 tsp. lemon juice instead of the zest.  I also used a different streusel since I like brown sugar streusel.  I am definitely saving this recipe and maybe even giving up boxed muffins!

Very moist, though a tad dense. Not bad though. The batter doesn't have much flavor to it, but the streusel topping was excellent. The trick with the flour on the blueberries worked great as well!
I'll definitely try this one again, but maybe with 1/2 brown sugar in the batter., and some cinnamon.

Very disappointing. I've had better store bought muffins. They were heavy and bland. The streusel top was pretty good, but that and the only other real flavor came from the blueberries. I will not make these again.

These were delicious, but a little greasy. I used skim milk but instead of 1/2 cup I used 3/4 cup. I think next time I would try applesauce instead of butter or maybe use 3/4 stick butter and less streusel topping to save calories. Other than that, I really like the flavor and they hold up well in the freezer. I got 21 small muffins out of the batter and have been eating 2 a day for breakfast!

Definitely the best blueberry muffins I've ever made and possibly the best I've ever had.  I wish I would have doubled the recipe. :-)

This is a favorite in my house.  I usually make it as a coffee cake rather than muffins.  I have also made it with raspberries, quite tastey!  I love it because it is so fast and simple to make.  I always add a few extra berries.

The topping on these muffins is very good!  The only negative is that the topping loses it's crispness once the muffins have been stored.

This recipe doesn't indicate when the milk should be added... they where rather heavy and dense.  The topping was not as crumbly as I would have liked.  I do like the lemon zest and cinnamon flavors.

These were pretty good.  I would make them again but I would probably add more blueberries.  The streusel topping was good but I was expecting more of a crumble.  This seemed more like a crunchy candy coating.  I did not find the muffins cakey as others have suggested.  I used buttermilk rather than plain milk and I think that added more flavor to the muffin.  I am going to keep this recipe on hand but will keep looking for something that suites my tastes better.  This one isn't bad, it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

My husband really liked these; I thought they were good as far as muffins go, but perhaps not orgasmic. I used up the last of our own homegrown blueberries from last summer (they were in the freezer) and I wish I had more!

I made these because they sounded delicious but was very disappointed by the flavors.  They look beautiful and seemed to be a success till I test tasted one before serving to company.  I'm glad I did!!  Very odd flavors - lemon zest, vanilla, blueberries and sugar?  Somehow it didn't come together to make a pleasing taste.  I followed the directions and think I will have to throw these out.  If my husband likes them then I'll save them for him to have with his coffee but otherwise, heave-ho!

I added the cinnamon to the batter (accident) and used lime zest instead of lemon. In the topping I added finely chopped walnuts and finely chopped half of a peach. I added only a sprinkle of cinnamon to the topping since I put it in the batter. We shall see...

The muffins are better with these minor modifications.  Add at least 2 more tablespoons of sugar, a touch more vanilla, and the least 3/4 teaspoons of lemon zest.  I may try using buttermilk to moisten the muffin more.

These are truly the best moist muffins I personally have ever made. I followed reviews and as suggested I replaced the sugar in the struesel topping with brown sugar and also used 2 cups of blueberries. I have been searching for the moistest blueberry muffins and this is it. Its all about the folding in of the ingredients. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

I thought these were pretty tasty.  I followed the recipe except I didn't measure the lemon zest I just grated it right in there.  I also didn't do the streusel topping.  I wasn't feeling streuselly that day.  My family and friends really liked them.

I was surprised how good this was...I wasn't hungry but I wanted to try it after it cooled...I ended up eating about 3/4 of the muffin.  Oh, I made the giant muffins!  So I only made 6, and baked for about 31 minutes.  And the only other thing different was I used 2 cups of frozen (thawed) blueberries.  I will defintely make this again, and maybe add in a little bit more blueberries.

Hats off to you, Heather!  This recipe is the best ever and is now my favorite "go to" recipe for blueberry muffins.  I am blessed to have wild native high-bush blueberries growing right in our backyard (New Hampshire, USA).  My husband picked 2 cups and asked me to make some muffins.  My only change was to increase the lemon zest to 1/2 tsp.  We love the lemon flavor with our blueberry muffins and I increased the amount of blueberries to 2 cups.  The topping was delicious (didn't change a thing).  My only suggestion is to either spray the top of metal muffin pan with nonstick spay or grease/flour top of pan BEFORE adding the paper muffin cups.  Because of the topping, it was somewhat difficult to remove the cooked muffins from the pan because the top was a bit stuck.  I baked the full 25 minutes and they came out so delicious!  Maybe I'll invest in a new nonstick muffin pan!  :)  Thank you!

Delicious – light with great texture.  I added twice as much lemon zest only because I love the flavor or lemon zest and blueberries.  The streusel topping was a little too sweet for me, so I would change it out for another, but it was still very good.

Read some of the reviews before making. Lined oven with aluminum foil beforehand as crumble topping did go all over. Well worth it, as hubby devoured 3 immediately. Great recipe, will be making again!

My family is savoring these muffins as I write this. This is the best blueberry muffin I have ever made!  I did not have lemon zest but am sure that would be a wonderful addition. This is a keeper and one to pass on to others.

great texture, thick batter so they didn't spread out but puffed up high. I used  2 cups blueberries and omitted the topping just because I think topping is messy and I don't care for overly sweet muffins. loved it!

My picky eaters love these muffins.  I use buttermilk instead and they are a little moister, and I use the zest of one whole lemon. I skip the topping they really don't need it.  I have drizzled them with some lemon glaze.

These muffins came out just as they were supposed to with the recipe as is.  However, the streusel really made the muffins.  It was DELICIOUS.  However, the rest of the muffin was just... meh.  They were just ok.  nothing over the top about the muffins themselves.  

I think next time, I will keep the streusel recipe but find another for the muffins themselves.

I made these last night and I think they are the best blueberry muffins I ever tasted. I did add some lemon juice to the milk to make a buttermilk substitute that amped up the lemon flavor in these. They are delicious!

I just made these muffins and they are great! I gave them 4 stars because I felt that the streusel topping was a little bit too sweet. I felt that it kinda took away from the already sweet muffin. I probably will not add the topping and just make the muffins. Also, I noticed that when I made the muffins I had to use 3/4 cup milk instead of the 1/2 cup in order to loosen up the batter. I didn't have a lemon hand but without it the muffins still tasted pretty good! I will add in the lemon zest the next time I make these! ****UPDATE*** July 31, 2012*** I made these again this morning! I didn't have milk but guess what... water worked out perfectly! I used about 3/4 cup to 1 full cup of water. I didn't make the streusel topping this time around so i just added the cinnamon to the muffin batter along with the lemon zest I was finally able to get my hands on! My family loved them and my mom thought that they tasted even better with water instead of milk!

These are the perfect texture and sweetness is just right. I used lemon extract, instead of vanilla along with the lemon zest.

A++++. It Wasn't a fast recipe but muffins from scratch rarely are. The kids loved them. Don't skimp on the streusel. It's a must!

Great recipe.  I made minor changes to make them healthier and they turned out amazing.  I used 11/4 white flour and 3/4 wheat flour, 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce, and slightly less butter in the topping. Also added the lemon juice from a lemon.

Great recipe! I used the zest of a whole lemon instead of 1/4 a tsp (which is not enough lemon in my opinion) and I also used 1 cup of white wheat flour instead of 2 cups AP. Fantastic!!!!!

Easy and YUMMY!  My family loves them!  These are nice and moist, not like the kind you get at those famous coffee houses.  Theirs are very dry.  I did double the topping and left out the lemon zest.  I made these two days ago and have to make more today.  Gave one to my mother in law and she wants me to make her a batch. Headed to the store now to get more blueberries.   Not sure what sprinkling the flour did over the blueberries, because my batter turned out purple, which is fine, it's a Blueberry Muffin!!! :)

Wonderful muffins, brought it to a church function with dozens of other items and no one could stop taking about them. I did a healthier version and this version and it tastes the same... Replace butter with applesauce same ratio and use half wheat flour half all purpose, use non fat milk and only use 1 tale spoon unsalted butter for crumble. Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

This recipe produced a moist and not too sweet blueberry muffin ever!  I agree with Heather, I will nevre go back to "boxed mixes" again!  With the "crown jewel" streusel topping, this is my go to muffin recipe.  Thank You!!

I made these for breakfast yesterday and they were a big hit.  Very moist, and not overly sweet. The only thing I changed is that I used brown sugar for the streusel instead of white. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter and they were perfect.

It took us about 1 hour to make the muffins (not including baking time), but we had some trouble when it came to the crumble we concluded that it needs a lot more sugar, flour and cinnamon then the recipe says. Other than that great muffins.

I thought that the muffins needed more sugar in the batter. I will increase it by an additional 1/2 cup, when I make them again. I will also double the lemon zest and  use brown sugar in the streusel. Coating the berries with the flour really was an excellent idea! Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

EXCELLENT! would have given it four stars but i felt that the streusel top was a bit light and should have been heavier. Maybe some brown sugar will give it some maple taste. The lemon zest really brought out the flavor in the cake part of the muffin. Picking sweeter blueberries will result in a better tasting muffin. Without the streusel top the muffin itself is not overly sweet. But the streusel topping really gives it a kick. When i was makign the mix i thought it was overly heavy so i added a touch more of the milk to thin out the dough and it turned out to be perfection!!!! LOVE this. next time i'm trying brown sugar for the topping though and MORE OF IT! since the mix itself is mildly sweet :)

Muffin LOVE!  Added 1/4 cup brown sugar and doubled the lemon zest at the advice of another reviewer and they were eaten up within hours of making them (12 muffins - 5 people!).  Delish!  Never need another blueberry muffin recipe!

Granted, I am a newly wed and it is true that I've not tried a lot of other blueberry muffin recipes, but these were phenomenal! And quite easy to make!! So moist and delicious that I chose not to put butter on them before eating! 

I think, perhaps, where some people run into trouble with baking these is that they are inpatient and either muddle the ingredients, the time to bake, or the mixing (which is actually quite important for texture and density).

I agree with another reviewer on here, I'd give them more stars if I could. Two thumbs up for a great recipe!

These are the best blueberry scratch muffins I have made and my girls loved them.  Took them to school for a special breakfast that they had for the kids.

1.Delicious! This was the first homemade muffin I made, and after trying several recipes, I will always come back to this one!
2. Decided to try these as gluten-free.  Used Krusteez gluten-free flour. Recipe requires 2x the milk. I used a good mixer and it was very fluffy, and the end result was a delicious, not-too-sweet, muffin! 3. Still loving it, 5 years later! Always beat sugar and butter, add eggs, wet ingredients, then finally flour and soda/powder.

Good, the streusel worked quite well. Need to be eaten while hot! These don't keep well. But they're quite easy, and do taste much better than a box mix. I think making this recipe with a cinnamon swirl rather than blueberries would be really yummy, will try it out and add an edit.

I didn't have fresh lemons at home, but had some lemon oil flavoring - so added 1/2 tsp.  These were by far the best blueberry muffins I have EVER made. I also used the large muffin pan, so it made 6 large muffins.  Sell these at your next bake sale - they are AWESOME!

I used Red Mill Gluten-Free All Purpose Baking Flour instead of regular flour. They were fantastic! I have  several very picky eaters to please and every one of them went crazy for these muffins. Thank you for the great recipe!

I made these the other night and am not overly impressed. If I do decide to make them again, I will add more sugar to the batter and cut back on the blueberries.  I used frozen fresh blueberries and maybe they were bigger than normal, but there are more berries than muffin.   I didn't have lemon zest so I used extract instead and they are too lemony.  The streusel top was great, but I did substitute 4 of the tablespoons of white sugar for brown sugar.

Sooo delicious. I have to make just half a recipe though, or my boyfriend and I would eat them ALL! I have also found that they taste better when you don't use muffin cup liners...just butter the muffin cups instead.

These are delicious and really easy. I sometimes leave out the lemon zest if I don't have a lemon, and they are still great.  Also using raw sugar in the topping really adds a good crunch

these are good muffins and I enjoyed the subtle lemon flavor.  But I think there might be a better recipe out there.  This one was lacking a little something else for me.  Would consider making again but still searching for that awesome blueberry muffin recipe

Made the recipe exactly as stated and they were very tasty! I think it would make a great base muffin recipe to add whichever kind of fruit you'd like. I wasn't a huge fan of the streusel topping however, I will keep searching for the "perfect streusel".

Update: I tried brown sugar in place of the white sugar in the streusel topping - MUCH better! Would give them 5 stars with this sub.

These are one of the best muffins I have ever had.  Don't bother with making the topping though.  It never comes out right and trust me, these muffins can stand alone.  Great trick with putting the flour over the blueberries first.  It works great.

Really good.  As others suggested I added extra lemon zest.  Next time I will add even more - plus some juice.  Nice cakey texture.  A lot of dirty dishes (3 bowls!), but not a lot of work.

They were quite good.  The topping was yummy, but does need more butter added to it.  The batter was very thick, kind of like chocolate chip cookie dough.  The liquid mixture wasn't light and fluffy, just thick. But, I also added the 1/4 cup brown sugar as someone suggested.  I added the milk to that and then added the flour mixture.  They made a dozen and then a small bread pan.  They didn't rise much.  I will make these again.

Excellent muffin recipe!  Followed the directions to the letter, except used orange zest instead of lemon (because I didn't have a lemon handy) nd an extra tablespoon of butter in the streusel topping (two tbsp didn't seem to be enough to make crumbs out off all the flour and sugar).  Made this on a lark today for a picnic - just happened to have all of the ingredients on hand.  Relatively quick and simple to whip up.  Thought I had made too much, because the 12 muffin cups were very full... but the batter expanded less than I had expected, which made the muffin heavy and cake-like.  Delicious.

Yummyy. I did feel as if they were missing 'something' but I'm not quite sure what it was. I also had trouble with the crumb topping, so I just added some butter, and it came together a little more. I'll make these again though, maybe with a few tweaks. Good Muffin!

These were amazing!! Blueberry muffins are my favorite, but I'm allergic to artificial blueberries. That makes it hard to find any pre-made muffins or muffin mixes that I can eat. I was hoping to find the perfect recipe to make from scratch, and THIS IS IT! The only changed I made were that I used frozen blueberries (instead of frozen) and lemon juice (instead of zest) because that was all I had on hand and I added the milk in with the other wet ingredients. I also sprinkled some additional white sugar on top of the streusel topping before baking. These were so great. My boyfriend was super impressed. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

These are wonderful! I even made them %100 whole wheat and cut back on the sugar. They were still quite sweet enough, moist, and wonderfully light. Try them!!!

Wonderful! I used frozen blueberries, they worked fine. I skipped the streusel topping to spare the calories and because I was feeling lazy ... they were fantastic, even without the streusel. The batter filled the cups pretty high, maybe 3/4 or more. Bake time was 20 min for my batch.

I have never made a successful batch of muffins in my life.. I have always resorted to shop bought muffin mix.  Well today, with no time to go to the supermarket,  I needed a recipe to make smoko for some workers and these turned out brilliantly.. I didnt change a single thing in the recipe and they turned out like shop bought ones.

Wonderful!! I made it lactose-free by using lactose-free milk and coconut oil in place of the butter and they were really great! I did not have any lemons on hand so I zested an orange and the substitution was fine

Moist, flavorful muffin - a winner.  I substituted lemon extract for the vanilla and added extra lemon zest.  Next time, I"ll leave the streusal off.  It made the muffins practically impossible to get out of the pan in one piece because the sugar melted across the top of the pan into a crust.  Otherwise, superb recipe.

my co workers thought these were awesome, but I thought they were pretty good.  i followed the recipe exactly and my batter was very thick.  They baked up nice and moist though.  One time i used orange zest instead of lemon and they still tasted great.

Yum! I used the zest from an entire lemon, and wish I'd added more, or added a bit of lemon juice. I can't get enough of the combination of lemon and blueberry.   Also, not sure if it's because I made these vegan, but it took me about 50 minutes of cooking rather than 20-25.

very delicious muffins! I used brown sugar in the streusel topping because for me it gies it a richer taste, also the browning looks so pretty. I made them as part of a Christmas brunch and my husband and father -in-law (both huge blueberry muffin lovers) thought they were fantastic! thanks!!!

Pretty! I didn't have fresh berries, so I used a frozen mix of rasp/black/buleberries. I left them frozen til the very end and tried the flour coating trick-worked! I think I over folded the batter but hope that I get better with practice, as I'll be making these again.  I used applesauce in place of butter and egg beaters in place of eggs, and honey in place of sugar. Oh, and 1 c. WW & 1 c. AP flour. Also, left off the streusel topping, but would try that on an indulgence batch.  Yum.

I made these muffins today -- they were pretty good!  They weren't as sweet as the muffins that I've purchased at the store, but I think I read a review saying that muffins aren't supposed to be sweet like cupcakes.  I guess I prefer mine just a bit sweeter, so next time I might try using 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup.  Mine took 30 minutes to be done, and they were very moist.  Thanks for the tip/trick about sprinkling flour over the blueberries to prevent a purple batter!  I learned something new. :)

I used non-fat milk, frozen blueberries (thawed overnight in the refrigerator), and instead of butter for the struedel, I used Land O'Lakes spreadable butter with canola in it.  These were perfect, my substitutions didn't hurt the muffins at all.  They were delicious. Only thing I would do different is grease my pan better. I used the spray and a few places stuck, shortening would be better or spray could have been done better!

These were okay.  The topping was too sweet.  The cinnamon in the topping and the lemon zest in the muffin did not blend well together.  They are both bold tasting ingredients and tasting them together along with the super sweet topping were all just too much for me.  I tried a different recipe, "Blueberry Muffins II", much better.  These are the best tasting blueberry muffins!  Simple, not too sweet, very moist and just really tasty.  The only things I changed were switching the milk for fat free half and half and I didn't smash the 1/2 cup of blueberries.

A great blueberry muffin that exceeded my expectations.  The only thing I changed was to use half brown sugar and half white sugar for the streusel topping.  My baking time was also adjusted as well: 10min for mini muffins and 15min for regular-sized muffins.

I have never made blueberry muffins in my life.  These were excellent!!! They were a little time consuming for me - but I think because I have never made them.  They did take 40 min. to bake - as one reviewer had said it took longer. Used lemon juice (2tsp.) as in the other reviews and also brown sugar instead of white for the topping! Otherwise followed the recipe. They are the best!  My husband had four of them last night and took 2 in the morning for work.  Wil definately make them again! I'm definatley sold on the recipe!  Thank you!

These were some of the best muffins I've ever had!  My husband thought that they were amazing, and he is usually very critical of most recipes.  I followed this recipe almost exactly, but I did add some brown sugar to the topping.  I will definitely make these again!

These are by far the best muffins i have ever made. I have tried at least ten different recipes and this one beats all others by a long shot. I didn't have the lemon zest or lemon juice and they came out just fine. But i think i might try it next time though. I did add brown sugar in with the batter and the topping. I will be making these again soon.

My whole family thought these were the best blueberry muffins they had ever had after I made a couple of changes to it.  I put the zest one whole lemon instead of 1/4 tsp and then changed the cinnamon to a cinnamon spice blend that I had that contains nutmeg, allspice, ground orange peel, cloves, and ginger in addition to the cinnamon.  Great recipe and one I will make forever!!!

This is a great recipe and deserves ****** we can't get enough of them, I didn't have lemon zest so substituted lemon juice 2 1/4 tsp and a pint of blueberrys, instead of white sugar for the streusel I used light brown sugar...yum,yum, I make these every week now, my hubby loves them for breakfast with his coffee. I will never go back to box muffins again.   Linda Zielinski/Park Ridge, IL

Excellen recipe! I am always looking for a good blueberry muffin-and this is probably the best yet.I did make a couple of small changes-as others had suggested: 2 cups of blueberries, brown sugar in the crunch topping, and used about 2 tbs. of lemon juice(did not have any lemons) and they turned out great!! Very moist. Thanks for the great muffin recipe!!

Thank you for a great recipe!  These came out great!  I did also add 1/4 C brown sugar as suggested by someone else, and added a splash of lemon juice rather than the zest.  Also omitted the struesel topping only because I was too impatient to get them in the oven.  Will add the topping next time.

Very yummy muffins!  I did make a few changes to the recipe, though - I too did brown sugar (3Tbs) and 2Tbs of white sugar.  I also added a little more cinnamin, and added some nutmeg and ginger to the streussel topping.  Turned out delicious and moist!  Thank you for sharing!

I didn't have lemon zest and I used half white sugar and half brown sugar at other readers recommendations. I also used 2 cups blueberries. These were fantastic and my family had a hard time leaving some for breakfast the next day, everyone called them 'the bomb!' thank you for the excellent recipe heather walker!

Wowser, Bowser!  These are FANTASTIC muffins.  The streusel top is grand and the muffins themselves have the perfect level of sweetness.  I made these in July when blueberries are really cheap, but they are worth the regular price of blueberries year around!

I make 48 mini-muffins out of this recipe and cook for 15 minutes in two batches and they turn out perfect every time.  The streusel + not overly sweet batter + hint of lemon make this my absolute favorite muffin recipe, and a huge hit with everyone who tries them.

the muffins were great except I substituted applesauce for oil/butter and they were kinda sticky.  I just wouldn't use as much subsitution.

Very nice muffin, a little crumbly, but the streusel topping added a nice crunch and pleasant sweetness. This recipe made 12 large muffins. I used 2 cups of fresh blueberries.

Love this recipe. I doubled the recipe for my daughter's pre-school snack day. I am still a practicing baker and hit a few niches in the recipe. However, the muffins still turned out moist and wonderful. I will always use this recipe!

I'm a muffin snob too and this recipe is wonderfull!!  They are moist and cakey.  Heed the warning of gently folding, it's really easy to overwork.  Other than that warning, this is one of the best muffin recipes I've ever made and it is definetly the best blueberry muffin recipe!  The tip on coating the berries with flour worked great!

made this for breakfast and it was pretty easy. I had frozen blueberries so that is what I used. The topping kind of melted everywhere so Im not sure I would use that again. It was good though :)

Super tasty! Hard to eat just one. I followed the recipe and ended up with 9 muffins. Guess I filled each one more than I should've? Ah well, I like my muffins big!

This is one of those "perfect" recipes that made it into my personal recipe collection.  No need to look for another!  Unless you want to find one with lower fat, which is the only drawback to these...

Absolutely amazing recipe!  I was dumb and didn't remember to buy a lemon for zesting when I went shopping for ingredients, but I used 1/2tsp of orange juice instead and they came out amazing.  And i used frozen blueberries.

My "only" change was using maraschino cherries in place of blueberries: about 15 cherries were sliced in 1/8s, combined with flour, and mixed into the dough. In addition, 3 whole cherries were inserted into the dough in the mold before putting the streusel top and baking. I dried the cherries with paper towel before using. The best flavor came out of the ones I froze and thawed in a microwave (about 1min, high power) after a couple of days. Great stuff. Inserting 3 cherries in each muffin was indeed an excellent choice... but feel free to include 1 more if you have available.

To die for.  Just made them as Christmas gifts and while they weren't beautiful, the taste made up for it.  Very sweet, but aren't they supposed to be?  Loved the streusel topping.  I'll never make Baking Mix muffins again, even if I am in a hurry.

These were just OK.  I know muffin batter is thick, but this was entirely too thick to be usable. Half cup of milk is just not enough.  I had to add quite a bit more to get to "thick".  These just weren't as good as I was expecting them to be.  The streusel melted right into the muffins, and there wasn't enough of it.  I doubled the mix and could have tripled it.  The muffin itself is kind of bland.  But they baked up soft and the kids at pre-school really liked them. But, I'll be looking for another recipe to try.

O M G!  I was only looking to find one without oil since I ran out for something before.  I didn't have any lemon zest, but used this one anyway.  I was even down 1/2 a cup of fresh blueberries.  These are sooo good that I must finish this review now to have another.

Great Recipe!  I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and cinnimon to batter.  Plus, I added 1 tsp. lemon zest. Also, I substituted buttermilk for the milk and really liked it...It added richness.

I loved these muffins and so did my boyfriend.  The streusal topping is yummy!  We made a big batch so we'd have them for breakfast during the workweek and they stayed nice and moist (in tupperware) for about a week.

Absolutely wonderful. I agree one has to be careful not to top with too much of the streusel as the muffins get weighed down and lose their blueberry flavor.  Also good with apples versus blueberries!

These were absolutely delicious muffins! I'm surprised at the comments saying these were a lot of work for muffins. I really didn't think they were a lot of work, so I guess it just depends on whether or not you enjoy baking. I did add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 cup brown sugar to the batter, as another reviewer suggested. I do think that really gave the muffins a little extra flavor. We love these, and I'll definitely be making them again. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!!

I hate to bake, so I thought they were a little time consuming.  (I think making cake mix out of a box is time consuming!) But they were so good and worth it. I didn't change a thing.

Great recipe!  These muffins are delicious!  I used cake flour (what I had on hand) and the muffins turned out light and scrumptious.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing:)  My husband said it's the best blueberry muffin he's ever tasted.

These certainly do not taste like bakery muffins. I must not be a home baked muffin kinda girl. The product was good, but definitely not the best. The blueberries cause some hastle, and didn't even taste great in the batter. They were really easy though and my mom loved them. I gave these muffins a 3 the first time, because I had tried them that same night I baked them. I found out that they are deliciouse however, the next day, and I had to give these a 4! they were great muffins, and easy if your a starting baker like myself, and they were good.

Straight from my oldest daughter..."I'm full, this is gross." While nobody else in the house shared her exact feeling for these, we all admit these just weren't the best. Not much flavor at all. I think all the flavor is in the topping.

I made these for a sick friend.  He has not smiled in weeks, but these muffins brought a big grin to his face.  My whole family gave this recipe a huge thumbs up.  The only change I made was to throw in a little extra lemon zest (why waste it?)  Otherwise, it is perfect!

These muffins are beautiful & absolutely delicious. Simply follow the recipe & they are quite simple. I had some trouble getting them out of my greased muffin pan b/c they were so soft...so I might suggest using liners.

The best ever!!! I'm what you might call a "Blueberry Muffin Conneseuir" and this is the most outstanding recipe!! I also liked how the measurements were repeated in the directions, this prevented me from having to look back and forth from the ingredients list and the directions. Great job!

These were good.  It was hard to try not to overmix so I used the advice of other cooks and dumped the flour and milk in at the same time and mixed.  It was definitely a lot of work for some muffins.  I felt like I was making a cake.

These were good, but I don't know if they were worth the effort to make since I prefer the ones at my local bakery.  But if you like to bake, these are pretty good.

Wonderfully moist and delicious. The streusel topping is a nice addition to the blueberry flavor. I'm going to bake another dozen right now.

I made these mufins this morning for my brothes birthday- and I agree with the previous comment that keeping all the ingredients seperate makes you have to mix more, not less. They were okay, but a little dense.

Oh my!  They smell amazing when they come out of the oven!  They're best served warm and if they sit in the pan too long, the crumb topping sticks.  It's so good, you don't want any of it to go to waste.  My husband and son LOVED these!

I was a little nervous when I first mixed up the dough because it was so dense! I added a little milk to make it easy to scoop into the muffin cups. The muffins came out wonderfully! They were a big hit with all the breakfast guests!!! The hint of lemon and the streusal topping really make the muffin! I will definetly use this recipe again!

Amount of blueberries in recipe is sufficient, but more would be better.  2 cups would be just about right for my taste.

These were really good and easy to make. This was my first time making home made blueberry muffins and thanks to this recipe, I will definitely continue to make more muffins and cakes homemade. I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh and it turned out perfectly fine.

This recipe was great...and I don't like blueberry muffins!!  I've made it at least a half dozen times and only once was the texture not "falling apart" wonderful.  The time the muffins were more dense was my fault as I'd overworked the batter.  I love the struesel topping and all who've tried them rave.

Great recipe!  The only thing different that I did was replace the butter with olive oil.  As was written in the description it was really moist and had just the right amount of blueberries.  I also used an 8x8 instead of muffin pans (they're still in boxes somewhere), which took an extra 20-25 minutes to cook.  The only thing I would do different is add a little cinnamon to the batter.

YUM....I have a passion for muffins. This one caught my eye. I made a few changes this morning. I had no blueberries or strawberries so I cubed a large banana instead. I also used 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup half and half instead of all milk! Made 6 Jumbo muffins and I am in love! LOL! Great muffins, can't wait to do it with blueberries! Thanks for the recipe!

tastes a bit more like cake than anything else. I added some lemon juice, I think that was good.  I think it could have used more blueberries, though.  I made mini muffins and that was a fun alternative.  I don't know that I would go to the effort to make these again, though.... I liked them better the 2nd day, hubby liked them better the first.  Who knows. I am still on the quest for the ultimate muffin recipe.

An awesome recipe! Of all the blueberry muffin recipes I've had in the past, this one "takes the cake"! Absolutely delicious, light, and moist. The tip about "flouring" the blueberries is a must. Also, the lemon zest gave it a yummy flavor! Definitely in my recipe box.

Very good, but pretty moist so best if eaten right away because they become "soggy" later.

Wow, this is great! I made it as a 'coffee cake' in a bundt pan (increase cooking time to 50-60 min) and took it to work. I was gone in no time!
Thanks for a great recipe!

My child loves the muffins.  They are moist and yummy!  I don't use the streusel topping and add some whole wheat flour and rice flour. Actually, I have tried them both ways. I they are great each time.

I made them with some frozen strawberries that I had.  I also substituted all of the butter (except the topping) with a fat-free spread (I used Promise Ultra).  They were excellent, and you would never know that they were low fat.

This is easily the best blueberry muffin recipe that I have ever made. At big chain coffee places (not mentioning any names, but one is based in Seattle lol)  they have blueberry muffins that look amazing, but they are flavorless and don't even taste like blueberries. This recipe reminded me exactly why I used to love them.

I really didn't have to change much, i added extra milk to the batter because when i used the amount called for, the heavinese of the batter would have crushed the berries. i also increased the lemon zest to roughly two teaspoons. 

Overall, these muffins taste like they could have been delivered from a high-end bakery. I already know that friends and family are going to request these a lot!

Didn’t come out so great, kinda bland. Couldn’t get consistency of batter good for muffins and had trouble getting right consistency of streusel topping and used a pastry cutter. I’ll try making them again because reviews were so good. Been waiting weeks to make them. Maybe it was my butter not softened enough.

My dad is picky about food now days. So I made these muffins. He can't get enough of them. he eats one in the morning with breakfast and then one before bed with hot cocoa or milk. So these are a winner.

Made no changes.  These muffins are wonderful.  Shared them with a neighbor.  She LOVES them.
I have made 4 batches!!!!!  Gave some away and froze some.  They are so good to pull out of the freezer, zap for 15 to 20 seconds and eat....don't burn your mouth.

I LOVE these muffins!   just make sure when you add batter to muffin tins you don:t pack it down too much...they come out denser...If you like them fluffier...they will come over the tip of the rims before baking!   S Yummy!!

Perfect recipe. The only change I make is extra vanilla and cinnamon and next time I’ll make extra topping. The ratios in this recipe are perfect though

These were so  delicious! Loved the lemon in them. Make sure you crumble up the topping small enough, because it doesn’t melt down much.

Turned out perfectly! All the ingredients are well thought through and the proportions work out really well in this recipe. The only thing I would add is to over fill the muffin cups if you want that pretty rounded shape in the picture. Also, next time I make this I’m going to double the amount of streusel topping - it’s so good and I wish each muffin had had more!

I really do like this recipe. One thing I am going to try is adding fresh lemon juice to the milk and reduce it by the amount of juice I add. I love lemon and I want more taste of lemon, good with blueberries!

Pretty good, but I thought the batter was way too thick, so I added some water as well. I used fresh lemon zest, a 1/4 tsp, (like it said); but felt it was too lemony. Maybe dried  lemon zest would have less zing? !! I also used paper liners, and the muffins stuck to the paper as well. The flavor was ok, maybe I’ll use more vanilla extract than lemon zest next time and grease the muffin tins instead ! Thank you!

I made these last night for this mornings breakfast.  They came out awesome. Firm and moist.  I loved the idea of creaming the butter and sugar.  It really seems to have helped the muffins to be light and fluffy.  The recipe reads that it yields 12 muffins but I think most of us know better.  lol  I prefer a human-sized muffin not a cupcake.  I put about a 1/4c of batter into each cup of a large six cup tin.  I then added a tablespoon of cream cheese to each cup and topped with the rest of the batter.   I will be going to the store today for more blueberries so I can make some more.

I made this as a Mother's Day breakfast and everyone loved it!
One change I did make was doubling the lemon zest. I think it could probably be increased to 1tsp for an even better more prominent taste.

We loved it!  Followed recipe, with an adjustment in sugar as I was almost out of white.  We love lemon and used more, the zest of one lemon.   I found the streusel topping to be too much, I would cut it in half next time.  I baked 12 regular size, took 22 min.   Terrific flavor, light and airy.  definitely a keeper!

The lemon was key. It was too dense and heavy for a muffin. Followed recipe to a "t" and have made better ones in the past. I did love the lemon flavour tho.

Great muffins with a tasty crumb topping. I used fresh blueberries and suggest more lemon zest. Makes enough for freezing.

This is my go-to blueberry muffin recipe. Put the beaters away after mixing in the egg and vanilla. Fold in the rest. Do not overmix.  This makes too much batter for only 12 muffins so if you use it all it makes muffin tops. Make sure you spray the top of the muffin tin before filling the cups. .

Great recipe! Easy to make, all ingredients on hand, takes about 1/2 hour to prepare--- uses about a pint of blueberries. Yummy!

Made these today and they are very very good. I realized I was out of eggs so used applesauce as an egg replacer (per egg replaced- 1/4 cup homemade applesauce + 1/2  teaspoon baking powder).

Followed the recipe to the last detail - even floured the blueberries to avoid "purple batter".  Better yet, I had all the ingredients already in the pantry.  Couldn't be happier with the results.  This will be my go-to recipe for blueberry muffins.  You have to try these!!

Love this recipe! My boys like em. Pretty straightforward directions. Have made these a few times and they are always a success. One thing though is that i make sure the streusel topping is sprinkled on the top loosely and i add turbinado/raw sugar to give it a shiny sugar-y top. Thanks for the recipe!

The best blueberry muffins to ever enter my mouth. The next time I make it I might cut the sugar back just a little bit maybe 1/2 cup instead of 3/4. Maybe...! Lol

Best blueberry muffins ever! I made one change. I did not have any fresh lemons, so I used a mandarin orange rind for the zest. I made mini muffins with them, and the flavor simply bursts from the muffins. Kids and husband just popped them in their mouths, one after another. A bit more work, but worth it!

So I checked out what others were saying in their reviews.  I doubled the lemon zest in my muffins and used brown sugar on the streusel topping . All of these changes made what I'm sure was a great recipe into an even better "tweaked" version.   Really delicious!

I made these for my husband.  He loves them.  I left out the lemon zest and subbed almond flavoring instead.  Also sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar before baking.

I subbed butter for  homemade applesauce, used half white and half white & half wheat flour, reduced sugar to only 1/4 cups of brown sugar. For topping, Increased cinnamon to 1teaspoon, added 1/4 tsp of salt to give a twang and reduced sugar by 1tsp. Excellent batter texture! Love the lemon in it! Really great recipe!

First time with this recipe. Although they turned out good the batter was exceptionally thick which did not translate to a light and fluffy muffin.  But I would make these again.

I didn't add the lemon zest, just because I did not have a  a lemon on hand, and I used a carton nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt instead of milk because I had that on hand, and I did not add the streusel topping but even with my substitutions they turned out great! While they were hot from oven I topped then with a bit of honey melt spread just to add an extra bit of sweetness, they would also be good with a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top before baking. They are full of blueberry deliciousness!

The muffins were good but way too sweet. I cut the sugar in half and they came out much better.

I made these with our own fresh blueberries - the only thing I did differently was use 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup of milk (instead of 1/2 cup milk).   Friends and family are raving about them and say I should "market" them..  lol   They are delish!

These turned out fantastically I might go easier on the blueberries next time, but everything else turned out great! I used 2 cups of blueberries, brown sugar instead of white in the topping, and butter milk instead of regular milk.

This is the first time I have ever "successfully" made anything from scratch! They turned out so yummy that I barely understood my husband mumbling something like "oh yeah" while he was stuffing one in his mouth. I will never use a store bought mix again .

I agree with Mrs Houston. Look no further! :) This are amazing. I halved the recipe, but otherwise made really limited changes. I didn't have any lemon (in either juice or zest form) so I used the same amount of OJ. It made no difference flavor wise, so it isn't the end of the world if you don't have lemon zest. Just skip it if you need to. Lemon and blueberry do go great together, so I'll try to remember to get a lemon next time.  

Fresh blueberries this time of year (fall/winter) are expensive, and imported, so I used frozen blueberries from Columbia River Organics. They are big and beautiful. Use them quickly as to not allow them to thaw out and get squishy. Coating them with flour, as the recipe states, is absolutely critical.

Be sure to fill the muffin cups up to the top. You'll get a nice pyramid shape. 

These were so moist and the crumble topping was perfect. Note that it may feel like you are adding too much topping, but definitely use it all. Surface area grows when these bake, so it will spread out. 

This is my go-to blueberry muffin recipe and the family agrees! I had previously tried the "To Die for Blueberry Muffins" and was very disappointed. If you are torn between the two, try this one first.

These are good muffins but the streusel topping ratios are off.  The streusel was too greasy and therefore melted away.  It needs a few more tablespoons of flour to mix up correctly.   The batter was light and cake like.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of increasing the lemon zest to about 1.5 tsp. 
These babies are moist and not too sweet with a perfect crumb. Even though I liberally sprayed the muffin tin I had a tough time getting them out of the pan as the sugar caramelized and acted like glue. I read online that the trick to releasing "stuck" muffins is to pop the whole pan in the freezer for a bit. Of course I read this after I freed mine, but I will for sure try it in the future. Thank you for a great recipe. You must know The Muffin Man!

I usually don't write reviews but these muffins more than deserved a review! Made a few small adjustments to the topping and lemon zest but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written! Amazing and everyone begs for more!!

Made these beauties today for Easter brunch and they turned out fantastic. The only change I made was adding a splash of lemon juice to the batter because I didn't have a whole lemon to zest. The streusel topping makes it so the tops don't turn golden brown when they are done. I kept my first batch in a little longer trying to brown them and the tops ending up quite crunchy but the rest of the muffin was still soft and moist. Excellent recipe!

We make these all the time.  They are exceptionally good!  I agreed with the other folks who suggested adding brown sugar, so I kept the same amount of sugar overall (3/4 cup) and replaced 1/4 cup of sugar with brown and left the other 1/2 cup sugar as white.  I used the zest of a whole lemon without measuring which added more zing but I love it that way!  Thanks so much for a household favorite!

Thank You!! The "muffin snob" hooked me. I have struggled to find an easy delicious recipe and this is the ONE! The topping, the texture of its body. I even forgot one egg and had to add it before the milk and flour mix additions, was very worried it would mess with the texture (the handle as little as possible tip)but all was fine. Super quick to make too. My fruit was a mix of frozen raspberries and blueberries and I left out the lemon zest as I did not have a lemon :) SO yummy

This recipe is sooo good that when I wanted cranberry muffins I used it with few variations, since cranberries are tart I used more sugar, substitued orange juice for milk plus a bit more, used 1 T orange zest and the topping I used brown sugar and I always one and a half my topping. So freaking good!

Just a word of advice. I made a double batch- One batch made in paper cups was perfect.  The 2nd batch was made in silicone cups. They were good but flatter than the others. I seem to have issues with using those types of cups in things i bake.   Id go all paper next time but they are fantastic muffins and easy to make

This is a good recipe. I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. I also used egg whites instead of whole eggs. In all it was a good muffin.

The muffins were too sweet, and not moist.  If I were to make these again I might add sour cream, less sugar and more lemon zest.

I made two batches of this recipe tonight. I used less sugar (2/3c vs. 3/4c) and added 1/4c oats to topping. Topping is nice and crunchy, but does melt, unlike a crumble-type topping. Unlike some other reviews, I did not have any trouble with pools of melted butter or with the muffins being dry. I did not use muffin cups, just oiled muffin tins. Used 2t orange zest instead of 1/4t lemon zest.

The cinnamon in the topping really didn't work with the blueberries.  The muffins were pretty good but I would omit the cinnamon.

I took these to a party at my son's daycare, and both the kids and adults really liked them. I used brown sugar in the batter but used only white sugar in the streusel topping because I know that brown sugar burns quickly. Still, though, I wasn't too impressed with the streusel topping, because it just kind of spread out and melted onto the tops of the muffins and formed a hard coating. Also, I added one heaping tablespoon of yogurt to the batter because I thought it might help them be moist (often when I make blueberry muffins, they're a bit dry, but these weren't so, so maybe the yogurt helped). I would give them 5 stars if the streusel part was better. Next time, I might just leave off the streusel entirely.

This is my new go-to recipe for blueberry muffins!  They are so light and tasty.  The muffins are not too sweet.  The streusel makes the perfect bite!!  The only thing I changed was using 2 cups of blueberries.

I really like these muffins and will make them again. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I did not care for the streusel topping. I just didn't like the cinnamon with the blueberries.  Next time I will not add the topping, or maybe just dust the muffins with sugar. I also suggest doubling the lemon zest.

Fantastic! These muffins cane out so light, soft and flavorful. Not too sweet, so the strusel compliments them perfectly. I did substitute a frozen triple berry blend (raspberry, blueberry, blackberry). The mixed berries made the muffins perfect for a quick breakfast grab. Highly recommended!

Yum!  I did make some substitutions--1/2 whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 AP flour and used vegetable oil instead of butter in the batter. (I've been lactose intolerant lately so I wanted them as dairy-free as possible.) These were VERY tasty--even my husband, who is not fond of blueberries, really enjoyed them.  They're a great way to provide a quick breakfast as we get up & out the door on weekday mornings.  I have quite the stash of frozen blueberries thanks to my mother's blueberry bushes, so I'll be making these often!  :-)

I have made these delicious muffins many times and they always go too fast. Moist, delicious, and lemon zest is the way to go to perk up those berries.

Didn't have any lemons, so I used a little bit of lemon juice. The muffins turned out great and will definitely make again. Might try the brown sugar in the topping next time.

I made three different blueberry muffin recipes in one day to find the best recipe. This recipe was my favorite. The others were too sweet. This one calls for vanilla and the others did not and we preferred the muffins flavor on this one much better. The topping was good. Only complaint was one recipe called for slightly more blueberries than this one did and I liked the larger amount (just a half cup more). This recipe will be my go to recipe for blueberry muffins! Thanks!!

Muffins were good, especially the crumb topping.  Batter seemed very dry and thick as I put in to he muffin tins...muffins came out a bit dry, think I'll add more milk next time.  Also recommend softening the butter and chopping the lemon zest for better disto throught the muffins.

I made these tonight to satisfy my a sweet tooth and boy did they do that. These muffins are amazing!I rarely write a review right after trying a new recipe but these muffins exceeded my expectations. The only change I made was to use 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of oatbran just to kick up the fiber content. When I finished mixing them I thought they may not turn out right but thankfully I was wrong. The lemon zest is a must. The flavor it offers is fabulous Do not skip it. I also used frozen blueberries and it was still terrific.

I've made these twice and my husband loves them.  For the streusel topping I substituted brown sugar for the white.  Excellent!  I also made these into jumbo muffins (6 large cups).  Around 28 minutes baking time.

Great recipe!  Slight changes I made:  increased sugar from 3/4 cup to 1 cup; substituted 1/2 milk with 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream + 1/4 cup 1% milk; substituted 5 tablespoons of white sugar in the streusel topping with 2-1/2 tablespoons white sugar + 3 tablespoons of packed brown sugar.  The result was a succulent, smooth, rich blueberry muffin.  My family gobbled these up!

These were delicious despite the changes I had to make! I didn't have lemon zest so I just left it out and I only had about a hald a cup of fresh blueberries. Since I had some "need to use" strawberries in the fridge I just cut them up into pieces about the same size as the blueberries. Mmmm Mmmm GOOD! The Blueberries were a little tart and the strawberries were sweet! I perfect combination that I will use again! I did use 1 cup of suger instead of the 3/4 cup the recipe called for and I thought the muffins were just right as far as sweetness goes.

One thing the recipe didn't mention is how high to fill the muffin cups. I filled mine almost to the top. They didn't rise a whole lot so you don't really need to worry about overfilling :)

Absolutely THE BEST blueberry muffins EVER!  Made exactly per recipe.  Turn out Picture Perfect, moist every time.  Put Xtras in freezer and they were perfect for breakfast!  This is my NEW muffin recipe!  Sometimes i use brown sugar for streusel instead of white.  Great either way!

I actually made a different recipe for the muffins that was almost the same, and just used the streusel.  The recipe turned out great, and the streusel made it even better!

These are really good.  I wish I would have read the other suggestions to increase the lemon zest, I love the subtle lemon flavor and wish there was more!  Packed full of blueberries, puffed up nice and full, looks great!  I used brown sugar for the struesel because I ran out of white sugar...it's yummy!

These are by far the best muffins I have ever had and I've eaten a lot of muffins in my life! I did everything according to the recipe except instead of milk I used plain, nonfat yogurt. They were fairly large muffins but I still only made 12 and they took 28 minutes to cook completely. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

these were a wonderful treat this morning for breakfast!  We all enjoyed them very much and I'm not usually one for the giant blueberries in my food... my streusel didn't turn out as crumbly as it was supposed to and the batter made a lot more than 12 muffins, but perhaps I over did it on something or as I mentioned the giant blueberries may have taken up more room than expected. Whatever the case these were delicious and I recommend whipping up a batch for your own breakfast treat.

I just got done cooking this tonight with my VERY picky kid brother. We really enjoyed the process of making them. The only changes I made was to use all brown sugar plus an extra 1/4 cup, and add an extra 1/2 cup blueberries. Personally, I think the amount of blueberries the recipe calls for is perfect. Ours are just a little too blueberry-heavy.  Still, my extremely picky brother absolutely loves them. He even grabbed another one and ran off with it! Everyone else in my family who has tried them likes them, too. I seriously doubt they'll make it through the day tomorrow, which is great. I love this recipe and will definitely be making it again.

Very nice recipe! I made them with my four year old nephew and we had fun. All I had was frozen wild blueberries, so that's what we used, and they turned out tender and flavorful!

I love the tender crumb of the muffin, which was more cake-like than I expected due to the fact that the recipe called for butter instead of oil.  I loved the trick of mixing the blueberries with a little bit of flour; the muffins didn't "bleed" blue or anything!  Next time I'll try the streusel topping; I didn't have enough time, so I just sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar and popped them in the oven.  They turned out great regardless!  I can't wait to use the base for different flavors, like chocolate chips and/or strawberry muffins.  Love this recipe!

I'd give 4.5 satrs if I could, but only because I did add 1/4C brown sugar, extra lemon zest to the batter and 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar to the topping. This is an AMAZING muffin recipe! The extra work folding ingredients into the batter is completely worth it. They were moist and velvet like perfection!

Absolutely delicious! I added about a whole teaspoon of lemon zest - which I love, and it really complemented the blueberry flavor! I wasn't aware I would need a large muffin tin, but you really do. Mine were overflowing out of my regular size tin.  All in all, a delicious recipe! Will definitely make again!

These are great! I actually made mini muffins out of these and they turned out super cute. I used brown and white sugar for the topping and I also didn't have any lemon zest but I don't think it needed it! I will be making these again.

Delish. Sadly, I had to remove the lemon zest because 2 of my family members are not fans of lemons. I had no butter on hand and substituted with margrine. They turned out well, the crumble ontop is a nice touch.

I omitted the lemon zest but it didn't seem like it mattered, I also used frozen blueberries and the muffins were great. I think these would be good without the streusel.

This recipe is a keeper.  I didn't like the idea of having to use my mixer to make a muffin, but it turned out to be worth it.  I forgot to cut the butter in for the streusel top because I was getting hungry and trying to hurry and they still tasted amazing.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely amazing! These are perhaps the best muffins I have ever had and probably the best recipe I have every tried from this site. My husband even liked them and he's not one to like sweet things. The only thing I didn't do is add the lemon zest because I didn't have any lemons but eh. The only problem is that they were eaten too fast

I made my muffins from this recipe. I only did two things different.1) used fresh strawberries,blueberries,blackberries  2) sprinkle raw cane sugar on top of streusel and 3) 3 drops of lemon juice instead of lemon zest. It  turned out moist and fruitful. Warning: Doesn't taste that great warm. Perfered without toppings.ok recipe

These were excellent.  I was dubious when the batter turned out so thick, and actually added a dab more milk because I was using whole wheat flour; but they baked up amazingly.  I used frozen wild Alaskan blueberries, which are much tarter than the ones you buy in the store, so I added an extra 1/4 cup sugar and they came out delicious.

These were delicious. I just made them for the first time two nights ago and am making them again tonight. GREAT recipe. I used non-fat milk, substituted some of the white sugar for brown sugar, and it didn't hurt them at all, still delicious!

AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!  I just made a dozen this afternoon and they're already gone!  When I first saw the recipe, I thought, a box mix would just be so much easier, but I dont' think I will ever do a box mix again.  2 changes I made:  I didn't have any lemons to zest, so I added a couple tablespoons of lemon juice.  I also used half regular flour & half whole wheat flour.  Y U M M Y !!

I just made this an hour ago for the first time using blueberries picked fresh today, and I tasted it hot out of the oven.  Very good.  I too doubled the lemon zest, and did part brown sugar, part white in the streusel topping.  Otherwise, followed recipe exactly.  I might consider adding some toasted walnuts in the topping at a future time.

I don't bake, because me and the oven have a love/hate relationship, but I tried these anyway to get rid of some blueberries I had....and I'm not a huge fan of blueberry muffins...these are delish!  And I used someone else's suggestion and doubled the lemon zest and added 1/4 cup brown sugar....yummmmmy!

Fantastic recipe! The streusel on top really makes this recipe stand out from others that I have tried and way better than a box. I really like blueberries so I added more than the recipe called for. Wouldn't recommend doing this as some of the muffins turned out a little bit more like blueberry pie than muffins! Stick to the recipe and you'll be in good shape.

HOORAY FOR MUFFIN SNOBS!  THANK YOU for a superb recipe!  I followed it exactly except for using frozen blueberries (ones that I had flash frozen--they are like little marbles) and not bothering to flour them.  My only "complaint" is that despite using a non-stick muffin pan and greasing it generously (Crisco) they stuck to the pan more than I'd like and they were difficult to remove.  Ah so I had to eat those two that broke apart.  Next time (and there will be many many times to come) I will simply use paper liners. :)

I just made a dozen of these and half of them have disappeared in 30 minutes!  They were delicious!  I subbed lemon extract for the zest and used brown sugar in the topping (as others have suggested).  By far, my favorite blueberry muffin recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  My only problem was my streussel top melted right off some of my muffins and stuck to the pan (I'm assuming I had too much butter on some).  But even if some weren't the prettiest, they were super yummy! :-)

Very very good muffins... my favorite blueberry muffin recipe yet. The only thing was they seemed to take forever to cook all the way through. I pulled them out of the oven a few times only to find that the bottoms of the muffins weren't done yet. So, just plan on them taking longer than 25 minutes (at least for me they did!)

The recipe is excellent!  I used lime zest instead of lemon zest as that is all I had in my fridge.  I've made this recipe two separate times and both times they turned out tasting and looking great!  I put them in the fridge to keep for a few days and microwave each muffin for about 10 seconds to get it warmed up to have with coffee in the mornings.

This is THE BEST recipe for blueberry muffins with the crumb topping.  I have tried 2 others from this site and by far this is my favorite.  The extra tip about adding a bit of flower to the blueberries prior to mixing was very helpful.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Yummy! I liked the crunchy topping.  I followed the recipe, and added 2 cups of blueberries.  They turned out berry good!

The taste is fabulous...I added a little brown sugar and oatmeal to the streusal topping but it did run off the top of the muffins and made some really yummy crunchy butter candy that my kids loved to pick off the muffin tin and eat! I also used cake flour instead of all-purpose and they are really light and fluffy. What a great recipe!

These really were fabulous! I used some suggestions from other reviews, like adding spices, using lemon juice instead of zest and adding the brown sugar. They were a lot of work, though. My 5-year old, who helped (and his Dad) said it was all worth it, though! Yum.

These muffins turned out moist and delicious. I didn't have lemon juice so I'm sure they're even better with that. The topping is good because it stayed on the muffins. Sometimes the brown-sugar topping falls off as the muffins rise. Definitely follow the directions about how to mix and fold the batter.

I loved this recipe. The muffins are great and very easy to make. They turned out so well, by boyfriend thought I used a box mix, he didn't believe I make them until I showed him the recipe.

These were amazing!  They left me wanting more.  I have been searching for a streusel Blueberry Muffin recipe for a while and I finally found it!  I took the suggestion and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the batter. YUM!  These were so good my dog stole some off the counter!

Very good muffins!  I used fresh blueberries, and tossed them in a little flour fist to keep them from running all over the batter.  I did not use Lemon only because I was out.  It was still YUMMY!  Blueberries are really cheap right now, so I will make them again for sure!

Pretty darn good!  I doubled up on the topping....my daughter said that was the best part!  I made a double batch 2 days ago, sent some with my daughter for one function, and took some to another function.  The requested 2nd double batch is in the oven now, and the vultures are in formation!

GREAT recipe!  Worth the little extra work over a box mix!!  Last time I made these I used left over strawberries instead of the blueberries and I think they were even better that way.  I also use half white and half brown sugar in the topping for a little extra flavor.  Yummy!

These were really easy to throw together and delicious.  I didn't have any lemons so I added a few drops of lemon juice.  I made 16 muffins and they came out great.  I might make a little more streusal topping next time.

Very good recipe. I added the flowers from 2 small stems of lavender. Lavender and blueberry compliment each other well. Yummmy. In the crumble topping portion of the recipe, the flour to butter ratio was a little off it needed a couple Tbs more flour. I also suggest doubling the crumble topping. Happy baking!

I didn't have lemon zest on hand, so I omitted that, but they were still really good! I love the streusel topping on top. Adds a nice sweetness. :) YUM.

I agree it's hard to not overwork with alternating dry ingredients and milk. My muffins turned out very dense and tough. I also think it needs more lemon zest to be noticeable. They sure smell good while baking, though!  I prefer the "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" recipe.

I made these, loved the batter but had trouble with the streusel. I ended up sprinkling sugar on top as my Mother did. Loved them. Thanks, will use this as my basic recipe.

My sons loved these and usually they shy away from something with "real" blueberries in it.  I did drizzle on a glaze and I didn't have lemons, so just put in about 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract!

Just made thise muffins early this morning  and thought they were great! I never use butter or oil, only applesauce but didn't have any so the fat in them isnt good for me, but, I used egg whites and non-fat, non-dairy milk. I was only able to make 6 for some reason. The next time I am making them in a cake pan, they tasted more like blueberry cake instead of muffins. And of course next time I will use applesauce in place of butter. Actually looking forward to having them again!!

I've used this recipe twice now. Both times my husband asked if he could eat more than one. He normally takes whatever I bake to work and he doesn't have to beg anyone to take them off his hands. The muffins themselves are pretty basic. I think it's the topping that makes it oh so good.

Delicious! Great as is. I've also made then with 1 1/2 cups chopped apples (skins on!), up the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and no lemon. Bake beautifully in 23 minutes in my oven.

Great recipe! (Much better than the "To Die For..." one). The lemon really brings out the blueberries. I took Mrs. Houston's advice and added the brown sugar and a little more lemon - didn't have zest so used extract. Wonderful! The streusel was just right. They were gone immediately after coming out of the oven.

I was skeptical of this recipe when I mixed everything together and the muffin batter was quite thick.  BUT it turned out super tasty and yummy.    Great recipe!

This was an easy recipe to follow.  I actually cut the recipe in half to use up leftover blueberries and they came out good.

I like to reduce calories by using Splenda sugar. I buy it by the bag for baking.I also reduce the amount of sugar. Other than that it was GREAT!

converting the recipe was confusing and hard to follow. The time it took to bake was not sufficient and required more time...the topping is tricky, especially if you add too much butter and not enough of the other ingredients. The dough tasted really good.

Everyone gobbled these up quickly.  Though we all agreed that they were too sweet, we still managed to eat every crumb.   We used berries we picked in the morning and had the muffins for mid-day snack.

These were wonderful.  I used frozen blackberries instead and added a tablespoon of vegtable oil, since the batter semed a little thick. An hour after coming out of the oven all of them were gone!

I followed this recipe exactly and did the folding very genty as suggested. They were okay, nothing to write home about. I always use foil baking cups for muffins because of the butter leakage factor but it didn't help with this recipe! The butter from the streusel topping ran everywhere so the bottom of every muffin was a greasy mess. I can't say I won't make these again because they weren't horrible, but I will continue my search for the perfect blueberry muffin recipe.

MMMM!!! I made these this morning, and what a good muffin! Very easy to make. Made 2 simple changes: added 2 T. more milk, and used frozen blueberries. Other than that, followed to a T! Very moist and great muffin texture! Will definitely be my only recipe for muffins from now on!

I followed this recipe to the T but was disappointed with how messy the streusel topping was.  When I took the muffins out of the pan there was butter literally floating at the bottom.  On the other side, they were tasty, but they were not cooked completely after the recommended cooking time.  I won't make these again.  I'd prefer a more healthier muffin.

These were wonderful - best homemade blueberry muffins I've ever made! The batter came out extra thick, so I'm wondering if adding a little extra milk would be a good idea. Otherwise, everything is perfect. Oh, and they are plenty sweet!

These have got to be THE BEST ever!!

I tripled the recipe as a special treat for my students in reading class.

I used a bag of frozen blueberries so save money.  Beautiful !!!

Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  It's a real keeper!

I made a double batch of this and froze them.  WOW!  They are just as good, if not better, microwaved!  They also turned out moist and a little "cakey"- which was wonderful.  They are a real treat and I'll be making this again and again!

Used 1-2/3C. dried blueberries soaked overnight in 1C water. Drained and used the approx 1/2C liquid in place of the milk.(Batter will be darker but looks good).1 tsp fresh lemon zest.Added 1/4C brown sugar to batter but really not needed. Used brown sugar in streusel and doubled the recipe. This made 18 regular sized muffins. The texture and taste was fantastic !

Pretty good blueberry muffin I might say. I followed my doctors advice to eliminate salt as much as I can so I did with this one. It was a little bland without the salt (my first batch) but it's still good. The second batch I added salt, it's DELICIOUS! I used my muffin top pan and it was great. Boy toy love it!

These muffins are divine. I probably added a few more blueberries than called for, and I definitely increased the lemon zest to nearly 1/2 tsp because I love the way the citrus really brings out the complex flavor of the blueberries. These take a bit longer to make than most other blueberry muffin recipes, but are absolutely worth the extra effort. My family loves them as mini muffins - they're perfect for breakfast and lunch boxes!

These are the best!  One of my daughters said, "Mom, they taste like vanilla ice cream with blueberries in it."  Just delicious.  If you think the streusel topping is too much work, leave it off!  They'll still be great muffins.

I was very upset with this recipe.  I followed it to a T but I used frozen blueberries and was upset that I wasted $5.00 on the blueberries for this recipe when I could have made better ones from a box and they would have turned out better.  They were kinda rubbery.

These were the best muffins that I have ever made. I substituted blackberries for the blueberries and increased the sugar to 1 cup. I didn't have lemon zest, so I substituted lemon juice (1/2 tsp.) like another reviewer suggested. The recipe ended up making 24 muffins so I doubled the streusel ingredients. Yum! I will make these again and again. My kids loved them. Great recipe!

These are awesome muffins. I've made them twice now, and they are gone within a couple days. Really easy too. I've used both fresh and frozen berries, and both work great.

the streusel was a bit runny/buttery the first time i made these... they ran all the way into the middle of the muffin which made it seem as if it was uncooked.  but, they taste really awesome!

These were good muffins the first day, however by the next day they were pretty dry. I doubled the strusel topping which was the best part of the muffin. Overall it's a good muffin if you eat it on the first day.

These muffins are the best!  I stopped looking for muffin recipes after I tried this one.  I make them with breakfast/brunch item.  Simply wonderful.  They are beautiful, moist, and everyone loves the crunchy top.

I used some of the variations others suggested in the reviews. I used lemon flavoring for the zest, I used brown sugar for the white ,and I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla flavoring to the topping. I also melted my butter in the mix and I used self-rising flour instead of plain because I was out of plain and left out the salt and baking powder. My only complaint is that folding the flour and milk in left little lumps of flour in my batter which did not cook in the batter so I had a few pieces of white flour in my muffins. Also my topping melted and went to the bottom of my muffins so we could not eat the bottom. I think this was because my butter was not cold enough. I also used smart balance for the butter. And I used frozen blueberries. Next time I will use my hand mixer when when alternating flour and milk on low speed and I will sift my flour. Other wise a pretty good muffln. will give another try.

I really enjoyed these muffins. They were moist and the topping was delicious. They were a lot of work to make, but worth the effort. I will make them again. I subsituted lemon juice for lemon zest and mixed brown and white sugars in the topping.

Overall good flavor - I wasn't a fan of the texture though.  Seemed like a dense cake instead of a fluffy muffin.  The batter was really thick - like a cookie dough - I added a bit more milk to make it spoon-able.  My boyfriend liked them, maybe I'm just being picky.  But probably won't try again.

Thanks to this recipe my friends now think that I am a GREAT baker. These muffins are so simple to make yet so tasty. They are also fantastic with apple and cinamon. People refer to these as my apple crumble muffins and always request them when I attend a BBQ/ dinner etc. Thanks for the great recipe!

These muffins were good, but nothing spectacular. I'm still looking for "the" blueberry muffin recipe--especially since this one has so much butter in it. Also, I'm glad I only used 1/2 a cup sugar.

I'm not a muffin person usually. I was looking for a blueberry muffin recipe that was like one I've had at Whole Foods Market for years. Success! & now I'm hooked.
Maybe it is that the recipe stressed not to OVERWORK batter.
I replaced one egg with egg whte. always tring to reduce- was perfect.

Very moist muffins. I added more blueberries, and will add more lemon next time as well. The topping seemed more of a glaze as opposed to crumbly, but we liked it that way better.

WOW!  These are right up there with the best muffins from the most famed bakeries!  I added more blueberries.  I also melted the butter for the batter and used a spoon (not a mixer)to mix with the sugar, egg, etc....  Also, I used a lot of extra butter for the topping.  I think if someone didn't like the results, it is probably due to overbaking.  Mine were just slightly underbaked - YUM!

Wow! These are amazing muffins.  My whole family loved them.  They say it's the best thing I baked since the time I started cooking which hasn't been long.  I can't really criticize this recipe except that I used a considerable amount of more butter to make the streusel topping.  It won't be long till I make them again!

This is a good muffin recipe if you like "cakey" muffins.  They are rich and sweet with a nice hint of lemon.  I prefer a less "cakey" muffin. Also, these muffins take a while to make.

The muffins were ok. The topping was terrible; it topping melted and made a mess. I was expecting it to stay somewhat crumbly. I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

Sorry, but did not enjoy this recipe.  The streusel that was for the top of the recipe was too soft and basically turned into a cinnamon sugar topping.  It was not enjoyable.  The topping took away the enjoyable taste of the blueberries.  Also the bread portion was on the dry side.  The mention of flouring the blueberries prior to mixing with the dough was good.

Great recipe!  Will definitely make again. All of the batter wouldn't fit in my 12 pack cupcake pan (I didn't have a muffin pan) so I put the extra in a small foil baking dish (like you would use for a pot pie) and cooked it for 5 extra minutes.  It tasted like blueberry coffee cake!

Huge hit at my house. Made them and shared with the teenage lifeguards at the pool my son takes lessons at. Served them with honey butter. They LOVED them too.

Great Recipe.  I used liquid Honey (about)
1/4 cup less than the amount of sugar
called for.  Also baked in my convection
oven at 345 degrees for 20 minutes.  
Very nice and moist and very tasty.

 Thanks
